Junk,*[a] Yvonne Lorenz,[a][‡‡] and Aron Urbatsch[a] Keywords: Lanthanides / Alkali metals / Quinolinolates / Heterometallic complexes / Metal–organic frameworks The heterobimetallic 1D-polymeric alkali metal/lanthanoid [AMLn(Q)4]n [Q = OQ (8-quinolinolate): AM = Li, Ln = Tb, Ho, Er; AM = K, Ln = Er; Q = MQ (2-methyl-8-quinolinolate): AM = Rb; Ln = Tb, Er] complexes were obtained after re- arrangement reactions between AM(Q) and Ln(Q)3 in a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene flux at elevated temperatures. In these compounds, the eight-coordinate lanthanoid ion is sur- rounded by four (O, N) chelating Q ligands, which bridge to the adjacent alkali metal through their oxygen atoms to form the linear polymers. Dimeric [Cs2(MQ)2(HMQ)2] was ob- tained from an attempt to prepare [CsEr(MQ)4]n, and the cae- sium atoms are each ligated by one terminal HMQ and one chelating-bridging MQ ligand. In addition, the chelating- bridging ligands in [Cs2(MQ)2(HMQ)2] and in the rubidium Introduction The insolubility of lanthanoid derivatives of 8-quinolinol (HOQ) and 2-methyl-8-quinolinol/8-quinaldinol (HMQ) is an advantage for their use in gravimetric and volumetric analysis of the Ln elements,[1,2] but is a major disadvantage for obtaining crystals for structure determination. Besides being of intrinsic interest, the structures provide a basis for understanding physical properties. Erbium 8-quinolinolate shows luminescence in the near infrared region,[3–5] making it of interest for telecommunication and optical amplifier applications [also see the prominent electroluminescent Al(OQ)3[6]]. The luminescence was initially interpreted on the basis of a monomeric six-coordinate structure,[3,4] whereas it was subsequently shown that the compound has a trinuclear arrangement, as shown by crystallisation as [Er3(OQ)9]·MeCN.[5] This and the analogous [Ho3(OQ)9]· HOQ[7] are the sole crystallographically characterised homoleptic lanthanoid 8-quinolinolate or 8-quinaldinolate complexes, illustrating the difficulty in accessing single crys- [a] School of Chemistry, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia [‡] On exchange from: Fachbereich Chemieingenieurwesen, Fachhochschule Münster, Stegerwaldstrasse 39, 48565 Steinfurt, Germany [‡‡]On exchange from: Fachgruppe Chemie, Rheinische Friedrich- Wilhelms-Universität, Gerhard-Domagk-Str.1, 53121 Bonn, Germany © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The reaction of Yb(MQ)3 in the presence of K2C2O4·H2O afforded the monomeric heterobimetallic [KYb2(MQ)7] complex in which the three metal atoms are ar- ranged in a triangular fashion. They are surrounded by seven MQ ligands, which display the previously encountered che- lating (O, N) and the chelating-bridging μ-κ2(N,O):κ1(O) and μ3-κ2(N,O):κ1(O):κ1(O) ligation modes. Heating K(OQ) in 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene gave crystals of 8-hydroxyquinol- inium chloride. The structure of [Na4(OQ)4(H2O)8]n, obtained by neutralisation, has sodium ions coordinated by one chelat- ing OQ and four aqua ligands, the latter bridge to adjacent sodium ions to give a double stranded 2D-polymer. tals. Enhancement of solubility has been achieved by halo- gen[8a] or nitro[8b] substitution in OQ, by introduction of co-ligands,[8a,9] by formation of anionic complexes (and halogen substitution)[8a,8b] and by coordination of union- ised MQ, leading to determination of the structures of [Ln3Q8(OAc)] (Ln = Yb, Q = OQ;[9] Ln = Er, Q = 5-chloro- 8-quinolinolate[8a]) as chloroform solvates, [La3(MQ)8- (NO3)HMQ]·4MeOH,[10] [ErQ3(H2O)2]2 (Q = 5,7-dibromo- and 5,7-dichloro-8-quinolinolate),[5b] {[NH4][ErQ4]} (Q = 5,7-dibromo-8-quinolinolate)[8a] and [Sc(MQ)3(HMQ)]· (H2O).[11] More elaborate functionalisation has both en- hanced solubility and synthesis and also gives rise to lumi- nescent and light-emitting materials, including heterobi- metallic compounds,[12] for example, alkali metal/lan- thanoid complexes of highly functionalised (partly to achieve solubility) OQ ligands have recently been reported and show bright near-infrared luminescence.[13] The rare earth/alkaline earth[14–16] and rare earth/transition metal heterobimetallic complexes [Ln2AE(MQ or OQ)8] and [LnTM2(OQ)7][15,17] are also highly insoluble, posing sim- ilar synthesis and crystallisation problems to homometallic lanthanoid OQ and MQ complexes. We have, however, de- veloped pseudo-solid-state syntheses, for example, reactions of the mixed metals[14] or alloys,[17] with HOQ and rearrangement reactions of Ln(OQ or MQ)3 and AE(OQ or MQ)2[15,16] or TM(OQ)2[15] species at elevated temperatures (150–300 °C), alone or in a 1,2,4,5-tetrameth- Alkali Metal/Lanthanoid Heterobimetallic Complexes of 8-Hydroxyquinolines ylbenzene (TMB) flux, to obtain single crystals of these compounds, particularly [Ln2AE(MQ)8] and [Eu3Ba- (MQ)11] complexes.[16] Although the yields of single crystals are generally low (a not unfamiliar problem in solid-state chemistry), the bulk powder also can contain the heterobi- metallic complexes, as revealed by powder X-ray diffrac- tion. We have now developed these syntheses to yield het- erobimetallic lanthanoid/alkali metal coordination poly- mers of the type [AMLn(Q)4]n (Q = OQ or MQ) and the monomeric [KYb2(MQ)7] and report their preparations and structures. A feature of the structures of [RbLn- (MQ)4]n complexes is π-interactions between the MQ li- gands and Rb. Structures of a NaOQ and a CsMQ complex are also reported. Relatively few structures of alkali metal OQ or MQ complexes are known, but see [Li6(OQ)6],[18a] [Li6(MQ)6][18b] and [K(OQ)(HOQ)][19] for some examples. Results and Discussion Rearrangement reactions between alkali (AM) and lan- thanoid (Ln) quinolinolates, “AM(Q)” and “Ln(Q)3”, [Q = 8-quinolinolate (OQ) or 2-methyl-8-quinolinolate (MQ)], the latter obtained from the reaction of stoichiometric amounts of lanthanoid salt and sodium quinolinolate, in a TMB flux at elevated temperatures (150–270 °C) led to the isolation of a series of 1D-polymeric heterobimetallic [AMLn(Q)4]n [(Q = OQ: AM = Li, Ln = Tb (1), Ho (2), Er (3); AM = K, Ln = Er (4); Q = MQ: AM = Rb, Ln = Tb (5), Er (6)] complexes (Scheme 1). Crystalline material was handpicked from the bulk residual powder after the reac- tion. The low yield of crystalline material (a typical problem with solid-state syntheses) was prohibitive of characterisa- tions other than single-crystal X-ray crystallography and IR spectroscopy in most cases, but powder diffraction X-ray crystallography was conducted for the [AMLn(OQ)4]n series of complexes and demonstrated that the heterobimetallic complexes were present in the bulk powders. Decomposi- tion of the bulk material in the MQ cases prohibited any similar approach. Obtaining samples suitable for elemental analysis was difficult because of the adherence of powder to the single crystals, which could not be recrystallised ow- ing to insolubility arising from their polymeric structures. In some cases visually suitable samples were separated from suspensions in X-ray mounting oil (see the Experimental Section), although the analytical results were rather vari- able. Functionalisation of OQ provides access to soluble AM/Ln/Q derivatives, see for example ref.[13] but the chal- lenges posed by parent OQ and MQ complexes and the novel structures obtained warrant their exploration. Scheme 1. Reaction between “AM(Q)” and “Ln(Q)3” in 1,2,4,5- tetramethylbenzene (TMB) in an evacuated tube at elevated tem- perature. An attempted reaction between Er(MQ)3 and Cs(MQ) afforded the crystalline homometallic dimer [Cs2(MQ)2- (HMQ)2] (7). Another attempted reaction between Eu- Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 4338–4348 © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 4339 (OQ)3 and Li(OQ) produced single crystals of the known hexameric [Li6(OQ)6][18a] in low yield. As was demonstrated by the isolation of [Eu3(MQ)7- CO3][16] from a reaction involving Eu(MQ)3 and CaCO3, the elevated-temperature, pseudo-solid-state syntheses have potential to give heteroleptic lanthanoid 8-quinaldinolates. The reaction between Yb(MQ)3 and K2C2O4·H2O, in a 1:2 ratio, however, did not give a mixed MQ/C2O4 complex, but instead yielded the tri-nuclear homoleptic heterobimetallic complex [KYb2(MQ)7] (8). This monomeric complex is structurally very different from the polymeric alkali/lan- thanoid [AMLn(Q)4]n complexes (below). A plausible for- mation reaction is proposed in Scheme 2. Powder XRD measurements on the bulk material suggested the presence of complex (8), but lines of residual potassium oxalate were dominant. Scheme 2. The incorporation of potassium rather than oxalate led to examination of the Yb(MQ)3/CaCO3 reaction. Only sin- gle crystals of HMQ were obtained but the bulk powder showed an X-ray diffractogram with features similar to those of [Er3(MQ)7CO3] {prepared from Er(MQ)3 and Ca(MQ)2[16]}, hence [Yb3(MQ)7CO3] was possibly formed. Yellow single crystals of the new [Na4(OQ)4(H2O)8]n (9) were isolated upon concentrating a combined solution of HOQ and NaOH in ethanol. Previously, only the above- mentioned hexakislithium OQ complex [Li6(OQ)6][18] and [K(OQ)(HOQ)][19] were known for unsubstituted OQ. (For alkali metal complexes of functionalised derivatives of OQ, see for example refs.[18b,20–23]) In an attempt to obtain crys- tals of K(OQ) by heating the compound in a 1,2,3,4-tetra- chlorobenzene flux, only crystalline 8-hydroxyquinolinium chloride (10) was obtained and in very low yield. Structural Discussion The complexes [AMLn(OQ)4]n [AM = Li; Ln = Tb (1), Ho (2), Er (3)] crystallise in the tetragonal space group P4/ncc, whilst [KEr(OQ)4]n (4) crystallises in the monoclinic space group P2/n. In 1–4, the lanthanoid atom is sur- rounded by four chelating (N, O) OQ ligands forming eight coordinate [Ln(OQ)4]– moieties, with pairs of the 8-quinol- inolate ligands bridging through their oxygen atoms to ad- jacent alkali metals to form the [AMLn(OQ)4] units. These heterobimetallic units connect to adjacent units to form the polymeric 1D chains, which propagate along the c-axis (1 and 3) and the b-axis (4) of the unit cell (Figure 1). The formation and structure of 2 was indicated by unit cell com- parison and microanalysis. The analogous MQ derivatives [RbLn(MQ)4]n [Ln = Tb (5), Er (6)] are different from these in that they crystallise in the orthorhombic space group Pccn. Furthermore, each [RbLn(MQ)4] unit is rotated around the Rb–Ln axis by 90° with respect to the adjacent G. B. Deacon, P. C. Junk et al. FULL PAPER unit within the polymeric strands (Figure 2). The other major difference from the OQ derivatives is that the larger alkali metal rubidium has a higher coordination number (CN) than the corresponding four-coordinate alkali metal in the OQ derivatives in which they have a distorted tetrahe- dral stereochemistry. The higher coordination number is achieved by involvement of the π-system of the ligands [C(8 and 9)–Rb  3.5 Å] and bridging by nitrogen atoms (see below; Figure 2). This cut-off is supported by ranges for π-bonding of arenes to potassium[24] adjusted by the differences between the ionic radii of K+ and Rb+.[25,26] The average distance between carbon atoms of π-bonded arenes and potassium is 3.14 Å, and for rubidium this distance is 3.35 Å.[25] Complexes 5 and 6 have structures reminiscent of the [AMLn(tBu2pz)4]n class of complex (AM = Na, Ln = La, Tb, Ho, Er, Yb; AM = K, Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Tb, Ho, Er, Yb, Lu; tBu2pz = 3,5-di-tert-butylpyrazolate), which were synthesised by metathesis, solventless or in an inert flux, at elevated temperatures (200–300 °C).[24] Figure 1. (a) Structure of [LiEr(OQ)4]n (3) (left), which is representative of [LiTb(OQ)4]n (1) and [LiHo(OQ)4]n (2); and (b) the crystal structure of [KEr(OQ)4]n (4) (left), and their corresponding packing diagrams (right), viewed along the metal–metal axis of the polymeric strands. Clearly visible are the differences in the packing and the symmetry of the crystal structures. [Ln(OQ)4] units in 4 are eclipsed when viewed along the metal–metal axis (b; right), whereas in 3, every second [Ln(OQ)4] unit is rotated by 45° with respect to the preceding one (a; right). All hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity. Figure 2.

Chem. 2011, 4338–4348 4340 The high symmetry of complexes 1–4 leads to the small number of unique bond lengths (Table 1). In the lithium derivatives, Ln–O bond lengths are 0.018 Å shorter in 3 than in 1; in the potassium derivative 4, the bond lengths are 0.037 Å shorter than in 1, with the difference being close to that expected from the lanthanoid contraction when changing from terbium to erbium.[26] The larger size of the potassium ion in [KEr(OQ)4]n (4) leads to shorter Ln–O (by 0.025 Å) and elongated Ln–N (by 0.036 Å) bond lengths, when compared with [LiEr(OQ)4]n (3). The Ln–N bond lengths in 4 (Table 1) are equal to that in 1 [2.558(3) Å]. The larger size of the potassium ion compared with lithium leads to the [Ln(OQ)4] units being eclipsed when viewed along the metal–metal axis of the polymeric strand [Figure 1(b) right]; they do not interdigitate with ad- jacent units. The metal–metal distance in [KEr(OQ)4]n (4) is 0.50 Å longer than in 1 and 3, which in the last two cases remains little affected by the change of the lanthanoid metal (0.016 Å difference). As a consequence of the shorter Alkali Metal/Lanthanoid Heterobimetallic Complexes of 8-Hydroxyquinolines metal–metal distances in 1–3, the adjacent [Ln(OQ)4]– units adopt a staggered arrangement [Figure 1(a) right]. Li–O bond lengths in 1 and 3 are little affected by the change of the lanthanoid and are 0.57 Å shorter than the correspond- ing K–O distances in 4. Relative short K···C distances be- tween K(1) and carbon atoms C(8A) and C(8B) (carbon atoms bound to the oxygen atom) are observed (3.48 and 3.52 Å, respectively), but are near the limit for significant bonding (see below). It appears the steric bulk of the OQ ligands in this case is sufficient to block an increase in the coordination sphere of the four-coordinate potassium metal (cf. Figure 2). Table 1.

The Ln–N distances in 5 and 6 also follow the lan- thanoid contraction between eight-coordinate terbium and erbium (Δ ≈0.04 Å), but the Ln(1)–N(1A/B) and Rb(1)#– N(1A/B) distances in 5 and 6 are unsymmetrical and differ by 0.03 and 0.07 Å, respectively. This leads to unsymmetri- cal metal–metal distances for Ln(1)–Rb(1) and Ln(1)– Rb(1)#, with a difference of about 0.05 Å in both com- plexes. The steric effect of the methyl group in the 2-posi- tion causes the MQ ligand to rotate resulting in longer M– N and shorter M–O bond lengths when compared with un- substituted OQ, as has been shown in [Ln2AE(Q)8] com- plexes (AE = Mg, Ca; Q = OQ, MQ).[16] Rb–C distances below 3.50 Å (Table 2) indicate interaction of the ligand π- electron system (see data in ref.[25]) as do close to perpendic- ular Ln(1)–N(1A/B)–Rb(1) angles in 5 and 6 (Table 2) lead- ing to an overall η3-N,C,C-binding interaction. A recent survey of the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) showed that there are no bridging quinoline μ-N motifs known, but there is precedent for pyridine moieties containing σ–π-arene μ-M–N–M interactions. In the alkali metal coordination compound {[Rb2(μ2-phen)4]I2}n·MeOH (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline),[27] the phenanthroline li- gands bridge (μ2) through both their nitrogen atoms to form polymeric 1D chains. Close Rb–C distances (≈3.5 Å) involving the C atoms of the phen ligand and similar M– N–M angles (≈75°) are also observed. When considering all appropriate Rb–C interactions and Rb–N, and regard- ing the η3-NCC–Rb unit as occupying two coordination sites, the rubidium ions in 5 and 6 possesses a formal coor- Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 4338–4348 © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 4341 dination number of twelve, as in the above phen com- plex.[27] By contrast to the Rb–N interaction, p-C–N–Ln angles are near 180°, consistent with a σ-N–Ln interaction. The packing diagram of 6 [Figure 2(b)] also demonstrates the realignment of the MQ ligands, when compared with their OQ analogues (1–4), to account for the larger ionic radius of rubidium. Unlike the ligands in 1–4, which align parallel to the metal–metal axis, the ligands in 5 and 6 have a non-parallel arrangement. Table 2.

Weak offset π-π face-to-face interac- tions can be found in 1, 3 and 4. The mean planes of ligand A and its symmetry-related counterpart are parallel, as dic- tated by symmetry, at a distance of 3.49 Å (in 1 and 3) and 3.45 Å in 4. Also in 4, a CH···π edge-to-face interaction is observed between H(5A) (a hydrogen atom in a calculated position) and C(9B)#. They are 2.68 Å apart. The canals that run along the c-axis in 1 and 3 are approximately 4.5 Å in diameter and thus too small to fit the flux molecules used in the syntheses (i.e., TMB). The tilting of the MQ ligands towards the metal–metal axis in 4 prevents analogous ca- nals being observed. Crystallographic and refinement data for 1, 3 and 4 are in Table 3 and for 5 and 6 in Table 5. The novel homometallic dimeric caesium derivative [Cs2(μ-MQ)2(HMQ)2] (7) (Figure 3), the product of the ele- vated temperature reaction between Cs(MQ) and Er(MQ)3 in TMB, comprises one unique caesium atom, one unique deprotonated chelating bridging 8-quinaldinolate (MQ) li- gand and one unique chelating bridging neutral terminal 8- hydroxyquinaldine (HMQ) ligand in the asymmetric unit. Dimerisation occurs through the deprotonated bridging MQ ligand (and its symmetry equivalent) by both its oxy- gen and nitrogen donor atoms. Two additional methyl-car- bon/methyl-hydrogen–Cs interactions saturate the coordi- nation sphere. The centrosymmetric structure (its inversion centre is sit- uated halfway along the Cs–Cs vector) exhibits asymmetric Cs–N bonding of the chelating-bridging ligand B. The dif- ference is a large 0.345 Å between Cs(1)–N(1B) and Cs(1)– N(1B)# [3.561(2) and 3.216(3) Å, respectively] (Table 4). Bond lengths and angles do not suggest a simple division into σ and π interactions. For comparison, the Cs(1)–N(1A) distance of the terminal ligand is 3.111(3) Å. The Cs–N distances fall within the range of earlier reported structures, see, for example, the pyridine-bridged [Cs{P(H)tBu3- G. B. Deacon, P. C. Junk et al. FULL PAPER Table 3.

Chem. 2011, 4338–4348 4342 ing methyl-carbon Cs(1)–C(10A/B) distances are 3.789(4) and 4.035(4) Å, which fall near the range of Cs–C bond lengths in the literature. A survey of the CCDC showed that reported Cs–C values range between 3.198 to 3.921 Å.[25] In the 1D polymeric [Cs(C6H2tBu3-2,4,6)(dme)]n[29] there is an agostic C–Cs interaction from one of the methyl-carbon atoms of the tBu-groups (3.596 Å), and in the dimeric bo- rane-stabilised phosphane carbanion [Cs{(Me3Si)2{Me2P- (BH3)}C}pmdta]2[30] (pmdta = pentamethyldiethylentriam- ine), the caesium pmdta-methyl carbon agostic bond lengths range from 3.629(6)–3.881(5) Å. Thus, in the pres- ent case, one methyl-carbon–Cs interaction falls within this range whilst the other is slightly longer. The apparent naked face of the caesium cation (Figure 3) is occupied by neigh- bouring dimers, blocking access to the coordination sphere. If each C(H)–Cs interaction is viewed as occupying a single coordination site, the overall coordination number is eight. The dimeric complexes are connected in a 1D-chain polymeric network along the crystallographic b-axis through very strong hydrogen bonds (hydrogen atoms were located on the difference map) between phenolic H(1) and the adjacent phenolate oxygen O(1B)#; the distance is only 1.63 Å (Figure 4).

Crystallographic and refinement data for 7 are given in Table 5. [KYb2(MQ)7] (8) is very different from the polymeric Ln/ Group I heterobimetallics (1–6) presented above and has a much more complex binding pattern of the MQ ligands. Complex 8 is a monomeric trinuclear complex (space group P21/c), in which the three metal atoms are arranged triangu- larly. Eight-coordinate Yb(1) and seven-coordinate Yb(2) each are ligated by one terminal N,O chelating MQ ligand (ligands A and C, respectively) and one chelating bridging ligand (B) that connects these two metals together, N(1B) being bound to Yb(1). Chelating bridging ligands (D and F) are κ1(N)-μ-κ1:κ1(O) bonded to the potassium metal and Yb(2) and Yb(1), respectively. Two κ1(N)-μ3-κ1:κ1:κ1(O) li- gands (E and G) are attached to all of Yb(1), Yb(2) and K(1) through O(1E) or O(1G) with N(1E) and N(1G) bound to Yb(2) and Yb(1), respectively. The coordination environments of Yb(1) and Yb(2) are similar but ligand B, the sole ligand to bridge only Yb(1,2), coordinates through its nitrogen atom to Yb(1), but not to Yb(2). In summary, there are two terminal chelating ligands, three that bridge two metals and two that bridge all metals. Yb(1) is coordi- nated by O(1A,B,E,F,G) and N(1A,B,G), Yb(2) by O(1B,C,D,E,G) and N(1C,E), and K(1) by O(1D,E,F,G) and N(1D,F). Generally, the average M–O bond length increases in the sequence terminal M–O(κ1)  bridging bidentate M– O(κ1:κ1)  bridging tridentate M–O(κ1:κ1:κ1) demonstrat- ing the use of one, two and three electron lone pairs in bonding (Table 6). Eight-coordinate Yb(1)–O distances fol- low this sequence strictly. They increase from 2.183(6) Å for terminal Yb(1)–O(1A) over 2.354(6) Å for bridging Yb(1)– O(1B) to 2.451(6) Å for tridentate bridging Yb(1)–O(1E), an increase of 0.268 Å (Table 6). This increase is less for bridging bidentate Yb(1)–O(1F) [2.198(6) Å] and bridging tridentate Yb(1)–O(1G) [2.274(6) Å], an overall increase of only 0.091 Å. The Yb(1)–O(1F) distance is effectively the Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 4338–4348 © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 4343 same as for the terminal Yb(1)–O(1A) [2.183(6) Å] (al- lowing for 3 e.s.d.). The disparity in bond lengths between Yb(1)–(O1B) and Yb(1)–(O1F) can be explained by the charge size effect of Yb(2) and potassium, respectively, as the other bridging atom. In the case of ligands (E,G), in which oxygen is bound to all three metals, the former has a much longer bond to eight coordinate Yb(1) (ca. 0.15 Å) whilst the latter has a long Yb(1)–N(1G) bond. Cumulative bond length differences show that Yb–O and Yb–N dis- tances are 0.05 and 0.11 Å longer for Yb(1), respectively, than for Yb(2), compared with 0.06 Å difference in ionic radii between seven- and eight-coordinate Yb3+.[26] The steric effect of the 2-methyl group is more pronounced on the Yb–N bond length with the higher coordination number Yb atom.

Similar observations made for the Yb–O G. B. Deacon, P. C. Junk et al. FULL PAPER bond lengths can be made for the corresponding K–O dis- tances in that K–O bond lengths involving μ-κ1:κ1(O) oxygen atoms are 0.15 Å shorter than the respective K– O distances involving tridentate μ3-κ1:κ1:κ1(O) oxygen atoms (2.72 and 2.87 Å, respectively). The longer bond lengths involving the potassium atom are also reflected in unequal metal–metal bond lengths [K(1)–Yb(1,2) ca. 0.2 Å longer than Yb(1)–Yb(2)] distorting the trimetallic triangle from equilateral. Donation of π-electron density from MQ ligands to the coordinatively unsaturated potassium metal is achieved by the tilting of the ligands resulting in short distances between the potassium metal and various carbon atoms of the MQ ligands (Table 6). They mainly involve ipso carbon atoms and in two cases also an adjacent carbon atom (Figure 5 shows some as bonds). These contacts pro- Figure 5. Molecular structure of [KYb2(MQ)7] (8).

Similar K–C bond lengths (3.09–3.41 Å) have been reported for [K(PhMe)(Ln(tBu2pz)4)]·2PhMe.[24] In ad- dition, interaction distances between the ipso carbon atoms of the aryloxide and potassium in [KY(OAr)4(thf)5][31] (OAr = 2,6-dimethylphenolate; thf = tetrahydrofuran) range be- tween 3.288(9)–3.400(10) Å, similar to the analogous K[Nd(Odip)4][32] (Odip = 2,6-bis(isopropyl)phenolate) [3.256(9) Å] and [KSm(OAr)3]n[33] (OAr = 2,6-di-tert-but- yl-4-methylphenolate) [3.310(10) and 3.534(13) Å]. Crystal- lographic and refinement data for 8 are given in Table 8. Spontaneous crystallisation from a supersaturated solu- tion of HOQ and NaOH in ethanol led to the isolation of the 2D sheet polymer [Na4(OQ)4(H2O)8]n (9). The two crystallographically unique sodium atoms are each sur- rounded by one chelating (N, O) OQ ligand and four water molecules in a distorted octahedral fashion. All four water molecules bridge to adjacent sodium ions to form a double- stranded polymer, which propagates on the ab-plane (Fig- ure 6). Within each layer, an extensive hydrogen-bonding network holds the structure together (see Table 7 for bond lengths; crystal and refinement data are given in Table 8). Table 7.

The quinolinium and hy- droxy hydrogen atoms were located on the difference map. Compound 10 crystallises as a hydrogen-bonded step- shaped dimer in which both the hydroxy and the quinolin- ium hydrogen atoms bind to a near chlorine atom (Fig- ure 7); the H···Cl distances are 2.08(3) and 2.27(2) Å, respectively. Crystal packing shows intermolecular offset π- π face-to-face interactions in a sheet arrangement of the OQ molecules, the sheets being 3.30 Å apart. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first hydroxy- quinolinium structure involving the unsubstituted OQ li- gand without the inclusion of lattice solvent. Previously, many quinolinium structures (including Q derivatives) included lattice molecules or ions such as water[34] or nitrate.[35] Figure 7.

From an attempt to synthesise [CsEr(MQ)4]n, the homometallic, dimeric complex [Cs2(MQ)2(HMQ)2] (7) was isolated. The compounds 4–7 represent the first examples of homo- and heterobimetallic lanthanoid OQ/MQ complexes involving alkali metals heavier than lithium. Previously, only [Li6(OQ)6][18a] and [Li6(MQ)6][18b] were known and some sodium and potassium complexes of Q derivatives (in- troduction). A sealed-tube reaction between Yb(MQ)3 and K2C2O4 yielded the structurally novel heterobimetallic [KYb2(MQ)7] (8) complex. It represents the first example of a monomeric heterobimetallic homoleptic MQ complex- comprising an alkali metal, a departure from the polymeric alkali metal lanthanoid complexes 1–6. The crystallisation of a simple but previously elusive hydrated sodium 8-quin- olinolate complex (9) was also achieved. Experimental Section The precursor metal 8-quinolinolate and 8-quinaldinolate com- plexes were prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of the metal chloride (either as purchased or from dissolution of the metal oxide in hydrochloric acid) and a stoichiometric amount of Na(OQ) or Na(MQ) (prepared by a stoichiometric reaction of HOQ/HMQ with NaOH in EtOH and subsequent concentration of the solu- tion). The precipitated product was filtered and dried. Alterna- G. B. Deacon, P. C. Junk et al. FULL PAPER tively, MQ precursors were also prepared by treatment of the same aqueous Ln3+ solution (pH ≈5) with a stoichiometric amount of an ethanolic solution of HMQ and NH3 (molar ratio 1:1), followed by filtration, washing and drying of the precipitated complex. IR spectra were obtained with a Perkin–Elmer Spectrum RX1 spec- trometer and with a Specac ATR with a diamond anvil linked to a Bruker Equinox 55a spectrometer fitted with an MCT detector. Powder XRD experiments were conducted using a Bruker AXS D8 and a Philips 1140 diffractometer with a Cu anode at λ = 1.5418 Å and a graphite monochromator. Powdered samples were thor- oughly ground in an agate mortar prior to measurement. Micro- analyses were carried out by the Campbell Microanalytical Labora- tory, University of Otago, NZ. General Procedure: Reactions were performed by heating the finely ground reaction mixture (ca. 0.50 g) with the desired stoichiometry of the reactants and a flux [1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (TMB)] (1.5 g) in a sealed and evacuated thick-walled glass tube at 210 or 270 °C for several days. After visual examination confirmed that a reaction had occurred, the flux was removed from the reaction mix- ture by sublimation in an open-end oven at 150 °C for 2–4 h. The cooled tubes were opened in air and crystalline material was hand- picked from the bulk residual powder and characterised by single- crystal X-ray crystallography. For compounds 1, 5–7, samples of crystals in viscous hydrocarbon oil, following selection of crystals for X-ray examination, were manually separated from powders, worked with hexane to remove the oil, dried and sent for elemental analysis. [Li6(OQ)6]: Eu(OQ)3 (0.15 g, 0.26 mmol), LiOQ (0.15 g, 0.99 mmol) and TMB (1.00 g, 7.45 mmol) were initially heated to 120 °C for 14 d and then the temperature was increased to 210 °C and held for 21 d.

Crystallography: Low-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were performed with a Bruker Apex II KAPPA CCD (1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10) or an Enraf Nonius Kappa CCD (8) with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and equipped with an Oxford Instru- ments nitrogen gas cryostream. Measurements for 5 and 6 were made on the MX1 beam-line at the Australian Synchrotron. The beamline operated at ≈1.60 keV (λ = 0.77369 Å). Single crystals were mounted on a glass fibre in viscous hydrocarbon oil. Crystals were quench-cooled to 123(2) K (3, 4, 7, 9, 10), 173(2) K (8) or 100(2) K (5 and 6). Analysis of diffraction data collected with the Bruker Apex II KAPPA CCD was performed by using SAINT+ within the APEX2[36] software package. Empirical absorption cor- rections were applied to all data by using SADABS.[37] Analysis of diffraction data collected with the Enraf Nonius Kappa CCD was performed by using DENZO.[38] Empirical absorption corrections were applied to all data using SORTAV[39] within WINGX.[40] Data collection with the Australian Synchrotron was carried out using Blue Ice[41] and initial data processing was carried out using the XDS[42] package. The structures were solved using SHELXS[43] and refined using SHELXL-97[43] within the graphical interface X- SEED.[44] Acknowledgments We are grateful to the Australian Research Council (grant DP0984775) and to the Faculty of Science for support and to Mon- ash University for a Postgraduate Publications Award to A.
