Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/chem.201204632 Luminescent Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs) as a Chemopalette: Tuning the Thermochromic Behavior of Dual-Emissive Phosphorescence by Adjusting the Supramolecular Microenvironments Shun-Ze Zhan,[a] Mian Li,[a] Seik Weng Ng,[b, c] and Dan Li*[a] Introduction The borders of chemical and material sciences have been vastly expanded since the introduction of the concept of su- pramolecular chemistry that brought a continual increase in interest in “the chemistry beyond the molecule”.[1,2] Yet this classical definition of supramolecular chemistry, which speci- fies “the association of two or more chemical species held together by intermolecular forces”, triggered a controversy about whether some certain multicomponent systems, in which the components are linked by chemical bonds of vari- ous natures, can be considered supramolecular systems, es- pecially in the field of supramolecular photochemistry.[3–6] Thus, from a functional viewpoint, the operational definition of supramolecular species assesses the degree of intercom- ponent electron and/or energy transfer when stimulated by electron or photon inputs.[4a] Along with the increasing complexity of the focusing enti- ties (from molecules to molecular assemblies or multicom- ponent systems) in supramolecular photochemistry, the bur- geoning, and already fruitful, field of luminescent metal–or- ganic framework (MOF) materials[7] provides a new plat- form for the design and construction of supramolecular sys- tems that are capable of performing light-induced functions, such as chemical sensors, light-emitting devices, and optical biomedicines.[7b] These multicomponent photofunctional ma- terials are usually highly crystalline supramolecular solids that consist of strong bonding, thereby enabling structural predictability and robustness, and organic linkages available for synthetic modification.[7a] Given the various origins of MOF luminescence (mostly ligand-based, lanthanide-based, charge-transfer, and guest-induced luminescence),[7] it is pos- sible to achieve dual emissions[8] by simultaneously incorpo- rating diverse luminophores into one matrix by means of su- pramolecular interactions. This is an advantage relative to those of molecule-based dual emissions,[8a–d] which are usual- ly bounded by Kashas rule[9] that permits only the lowest excited state to emit. In our previous work,[10] a supramolecular dual-emissive MOF, namely, [Cu4I4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NH3)Cu3(L1)3]n (hereafter denoted as 1·NH3, L1=3-(4-pyridyl)-5-(p-tolyl)pyrazolate), which con- tains two classical copper(I)-cluster-based luminophores, Cu4I4 and [Cu3Pz3]2 (Scheme 1; Pz=pyrazolate), was report- ed. The tetrahedral Cu4I4 cluster is the most documented member in the copper(I) halide family,[11] but it is still of considerable research interest because of its structural ap- plicability to act as the secondary building unit of MOFs,[12] and its well-studied, yet still developing, photophysical func- tionality.[13] Compared with the luminescence origin of Cu4I4 that is a triplet cluster-centered excited state (3CC, coupled Abstract: Two classical copper(I)-clus- ter-based luminophores, namely, Cu4I4 and [Cu3Pz3]2 (Pz=pyrazolate), are im- mobilized in a supramolecular system through the formation of metal–organ- ic framework (MOF) materials. This series of luminescent MOF materials, namely, [Cu4I4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NH3)Cu3(L1)3]n, [Cu4I4- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NH2CH3)Cu3(L1)3]n, and [Cu4I4- ACHTUNGTRENUNGCu3(L2)3]n (L1=3-(4-pyridyl)-5-(p-tol- yl)pyrazolate; L2=3-(4-pyridyl)-5-(2,4- dimethylphenyl)pyrazolate), exhibit di- verse thermochromism attributed to the relative functioning efficacy of the two coordination luminophores. Such an intriguing chemopalette effect is regulated by the different supramolec- ular microenvironments between the two-dimensional layers of these MOFs, and in particular, by the fine-tuned Cu–Cu distances in the excimeric [Cu3Pz3]2 luminophore. The structure– property elucidation of the thermo- chromic behavior allows one to under- stand these optical materials with un- usual dual-emissive properties.

KGaA, Weinheim 10217 FULL PAPER with halide-to-ligand charge-transfer excited state, 3XLCT),[13a,b] the bright phosphorescence of the [Cu3Pz3]2 cluster (Scheme 1) is attributed to the excimer formation of the dimer of trimers.[14] This excimer regulated by means of intertrimeric Cu–Cu contacts (which vary from approxi- mately 2.9 to 4.6 [15a,e]) are subject to the influences of sub- stituent effects[15c] and supramolecular microenvironments (e.g., stacking effects in the crystalline state) in both dis- crete[15] and polymeric[10,16] forms, thus triggering several in- teresting photophysical types of behavior, especially lumi- nescence thermochromism.[10,15b] A merit of this supramolecular system that incorporates both Cu4I4 and [Cu3Pz3]2 is their well-resolved emissions that can be excited under different wavelengths (Cu4I4: lex=350– 400, lem=540–580 nm; [Cu3Pz3]2: lex=270–320, lem=630– 720 nm).[10] This provides the possibility that 1·NH3 can be populated to its two stable excited states under different ir- radiations, and then give two distinguishable emission maxima (i.e., dual emissions) through electron/energy trans- fer in the thermal equilibrium process. In an attempt to ac- quire more sophisticated manipulation of the luminescent and thermochromic behaviors, one can consider tuning the relative functioning efficacy of the two coordination lumino- phores, which can contribute cooperatively to the visual color of the phosphorescent MOF material. This strategy is termed the “chemopalette” effect, and it can be achieved by means of adjusting the supramolecular microenvironment while maintaining the overall host framework (by taking ad- vantage of the predictable structures of MOFs[7b]). In this regard, relative to the configurationally more rigid Cu4I4 cluster, the ligand-unsupported excimeric [Cu3Pz3]2 cluster (Scheme 1) is more sensitive (reflected by its various packing modes and varying Cu–Cu distances[15e]) to the var- iation in the supramolecular microenvironment that involves host–host and host–guest interactions, and crystal-stacking effects.[15,16] Interestingly, 1·NH3 exhibits a double-layer stacking pattern,[10] in which every two adjacent layers are connected by multiple interlayer Cu–Cu interactions in the [Cu3Pz3]2 cluster. Herein, the “chemopalette” strategy is re- alized by modifying two chemically inactive sites (see below) in the host framework to adjust the supramolecular microenvironment, and to fine-tune the interlayer Cu–Cu distances in the [Cu3Pz3]2 luminophore, thus manipulating the thermochromic behavior of the dual emissive MOF ma- terials. Experimental Section Materials and physical measurements: Commercially available chemicals were used without further purification. Infrared spectra were obtained in KBr disks using a Nicolet Avatar 360 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm1. 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed using a Bruker DPX 400 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as internal standard. All d values are given in ppm. Elemental analyses of C, H, and N were deter- mined using an Elementar Vario EL cube CHNS analyzer. Thermogravi- metric (TG) analyses were performed using a TA Instruments Q50 ther- mogravimetric analyzer under nitrogen flow (40 mLmin1) at a typical heating rate of 108Cmin1. X-ray power diffraction (XRPD) experiments were performed using a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. Steady-state photoluminescence spectra and lifetime measurements were measured by a single-photon counting spectrometer using an Edinburgh FLS920 spectrometer equipped with a continuous Xe900 xenon lamp, a mF900 microsecond flash lamp, a red-sensitive Peltier-cooled Hamamatsu R928P photomultiplier tube (PMT), and a closed cycle cryostat (Ad- vanced Research Systems). The corrections of excitation and emission for the detector response were performed ranging from 200 to 900 nm. The data were analyzed by iterative convolution of the luminescence decay profile with the instrument response function using the software package provided by Edinburgh Instruments. Lifetime data were fitted with triple-exponential-decay functions. The goodness of the nonlinear least-squares fit was judged by the reduced c2 value (<1.3 in most of the cases), the randomness of the residuals, and the autocorrelation function (Table S4 and Figures S14–S16 in the Supporting Information). In all cases, the crystalline samples were selected under microscope with 40 amplification after being washed by ethanol and acetonitrile and then dried. The purity of the samples was assured by elemental analysis and X-ray powder diffraction measurement (Figure S19 in the Supporting In- formation). Synthesis: Two ligands, 3-(4-pyridyl)-5-p-tolyl-1H-pyrazole (HL1) and 3- (4-pyridyl)-5-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1H-pyrazole (HL2), were used in this work. HL1 was reported in our previous work,[10] and HL2 was prepared by using a similar procedure as described previously by our group with modifications.[16f,17] 1-(4-Pyridyl)-3-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3-propanedione: Methyl isonicoti- nate (3.5 mL, 3.5 g, 0.025 mol) was added to a suspension of newly pre- pared C2H5ONa (3.4 g, 0.05 mol) in anhydrous THF (100 mL). The mix- ture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min and then 2,4-dimethyla- cetophenone (3.7 mL, 3.7 g, 0.025 mol) was slowly added to the mixture. After completing the addition, the mixture was kept with stirring for about 10 h while equipped with a drying tube. Then the solvent was evaporated completely under reduced pressure. The residual was dis- solved in diluted acetic acid solution (100 mL, 3 molL1), left in a refrig- erator at 0–48C for about 5 h, then filtered. Yellow solids were obtained and dried under vacuum to give the product (3.50 g, 55.3%).

Ligand HL2: 1-(4-Pyridyl)-3-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3-propanedione (2.53 g, 0.01 mol) was added to ethanol (50 mL). Then the mixture was treated with an excess amount of hydrazine (80%, 3 mL) and heated to reflux for 10 h. The solution was kept standing in air to allow the ethanol solvent to evaporate. After several days, nearly colorless crystalline solids were obtained and dried under vacuum (1.62 g, 65.0%).

Results and Discussion Realization of the chemopalette strategy: As stated above, the chemopalette strategy can be realized through fine- tuning the intertrimeric Cu–Cu distances in the [Cu3Pz3]2 lu- minophore to regulate its functioning efficacy. In previous reports, several examples to adjust intertrimeric Cu–Cu con- tacts were documented, including physical manipulation (temperature[15b,c,21a] or pressure[21b]) and/or chemical manip- ulation (host–host[16b–d] or host–guest[22] interactions). In this work, a different chemical-manipulation approach that con- siders the crystal-stacking effects is utilized. As known,[7b] MOFs structures are, to some extent, predictable and availa- Table 1.

The extended structure of 1·NH3 is a two-dimensional layer,[10] and thus the interlayer supramolecular microenvironment and the overall crystal-stacking pattern can be easily influenced by the chemically inactive sites (steric effects) in the MOF structure. As shown in Figure 1a, two chemically inactive sites (I and II) in 1·NH3 are pre-synthetically modified through ligand replacement (site I) and decoration (site II). In site I, the replacement of NH3 with NH2CH3, though subtle, would lead to the Cu4I4L4 (L=three pyridyl and one NH2CH3) cluster losing the C3v point symmetry, thus lower- ing the overall crystal symmetry. As a result, 1·NH2CH3 crystallized in the triclinic P1¯ space group (Table 1) relative to the trigonal R3¯ of 1·NH3. In site II, the additional decora- tion of a meta-methyl (from 4-methylphenyl in HL1 to 2,4- dimethylphenyl in HL2; Figure S2–S5 in the Supporting In- formation) would increase the steric hindrance, thus influ- encing the interlayer stacking pattern. Such steric effects are evidenced by the larger dihedral angles between the pyra- zole ring and phenyl ring (52.16 and 49.228) than those be- tween pyrazole ring and pyridyl ring (7.02 and 15.568) in the crystal structure of HL2 (Figure S3 in the Supporting Infor- mation). Although 2 also crystallized in trigonal R3¯ space group, the stacking mode is significantly different from those of 1·NH3 and 1·NH2CH3 (see below). It is notable that one Cu site in the Cu4I4 unit of 2 is three-coordinated, unlike the situations in 1·NH3 and 1·NH2CH3. This is reflected by the small residual peak (less than 1.0) around the vacant Cu site in the crystal refinement of 2, and further supported by IR and elemental analyses. Similar synthetic procedures that involve HL2 and aqueous methylamine or ethylamine resulted in the same product, 2. Such an unusual coordination mode in Cu4I4-related com- plexes has been rarely reported,[12c,g] but can be observed in our other unpublished works.

KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2013, 19, 10217 – 10225 10220 D. Li et al. in this supramolecular system. The first set concerns the [Cu3Pz3]2 clusters that involve Cu–Cu contacts that link two adjacent layers to form a double-layer motif (Figure 1b). If one omits the two chemically inactive sites (I and II), the stacking patterns of the double-layer motif are similar in all three structures (Figure 1b, left; see Ref. [10] for the de- tailed structural description of 1·NH3). The major distinctions are made by analyzing the interlay- er Cu–Cu distances (at 100 K; see Figure 1b right and Table 1). For 1·NH2CH3, the lower symmetry (triclinic P1¯ versus trigonal R3¯ of 1·NH3) is responsible for the distorted configuration of the [Cu3Pz3]2 core, which exhibits three types of intertrimeric Cu–Cu distances, with the shortest one being 3.422(8)  (shorter than 3.595(2)  in 1·NH3). These values are even shorter than those (3.628 ) of the opti- mized geometry of the staggered mode of [Cu3Pz3]2 in the ground state.[14b] For 2, the steric effects of the dimethyl sub- stituent lead to a longer intertrimeric Cu–Cu distance of 3.699(7) . This steric hindrance is also reflected in the di- hedral angles between the phenyl and pyrazolate planes (1·NH3: 41.08; 1·NH2CH3: 37.3, 35.3, and 51.68; 2: 52.88), with 2 being the largest. The planarity of the Cu3Pz3 trimers, reflected in the dihedral angles between the Cu3 and pyrazo- late planes (1·NH3: 19.98; 1·NH2CH3: 22.5, 19.3, and 15.48; 2: 16.18), consists of intertrimeric Cu–Cu distances, with the smallest dihedral angle corresponding to the longest intertri- meric Cu–Cu distances in 2. These data are shown in Table 1. This is consistent with the finding that shorter Cu– Cu distances (and hence stronger Cu–Cu contacts) would affect and reduce the Cu3Pz3 ring planarity.[14a,15e] The second set of variations results in the relative sliding between two double-layer motifs (Figure 1c,d, and Figur- es S6 and S7 in the Supporting Information), which also con- tributes to the overall crystal-stacking effects in the three MOFs. The outer double-layer stacking pattern of 1·NH2CH3 is similar to that of 1·NH3, which shows a packing arrangement of Cu4I4–Cu4I4, Cu3Pz3–void, and void–Cu3Pz3 (the void represents the triangular space surrounded by three Cu3Pz3 units) along the [111] direction (Figure 1c, left). A detailed structural analysis reveals the steric effects and supramolecular interactions in this microenvironment (Figure 1c, right). Although not valid for a single contact (typical I···I interactions should range from 2.93 to 3.52 ), the structure of 1·NH2CH3 experiences cooperative, multiple I···I contacts (3.930 , compared with 3.879  in 1·NH3) in the Cu4I4–Cu4I4 zones. The arrangement is also stabilized by sets of CH···I contacts (C···I distances: 3.916–4.285 ). Note that the void in the orange layer (Figure 1c, left) allows the Cu4I4 cluster with a methylamine hook from the upper blue layer to plug in and make contact with the Cu3Pz3 unit (N···Cu distances: 3.489, 3.852, and 3.982 , compared with 3.419  in 1·NH3) in the void–Cu3Pz3 zone (Figure 1c, right). Unlike the case of 1·NH2CH3, compound 2 exhibits an outer double-layer stacking pattern of Cu4I4–Cu3Pz3, Cu3Pz3–Cu4I4, and void–void along the c axis (Figure 1d, left). This packing pattern can be viewed as the relatively vertical sliding of the orange and green layers in the two complexes. A vital factor for this sliding is the steric hin- drance of the meta-methyl decorations, which prevent the Cu4I4 cluster in the blue layer from approaching the Cu3Pz3 unit in the green layer (Figure 1d, right). This creates the void–void zones in the structure, and hence there is an ap- proximately 415 3 (4.82%, calculated by PLATON) vacan- cy within one unit cell. For this reason, the crystal density of 2 (1.967 gcm3) is also smaller than those of 1·NH3 and 1·NH2CH3 (2.225 and 2.216 gcm3, respectively). In the Cu4I4–Cu3Pz3 and Cu3Pz3–Cu4I4 zones, there exist sets of CH···I contacts (C···I distances: 4.035–4.081 ). Figure 2.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 10221 FULL PAPER Metal–Organic Frameworks Thermochromic behaviors of luminescent MOFs: As com- municated in our previous work,[10] 1·NH3 exhibited interest- ing reversible luminescence thermochromism from green (77 K) to yellow (293 K). In the high-temperature range (293–413 K), the luminescence changed from bright yellow to dark orange-red upon heating, and this chromic process was also reversible upon cooling. It was suggested that such thermochromic behavior is the consequence of a thermal equilibrium that involves the energy transfer between two competitive excited states that originate from the Cu4I4 and [Cu3Pz3]2 (more precisely, the triplet acceptor of the exci- mer) luminophores, respectively (see Figure S17 in the Sup- porting Information for proposed potential-energy dia- gram).[10] This hypothesis is the foundation of the chemopa- lette strategy, for which the tunability of the visual lumines- cent color is attributed to the relative functioning efficacy of the Cu4I4 and [Cu3Pz3]2 clusters in this supramolecular system. In this work, the subtle adjustments of the supramo- lecular microenvironments in 1·NH2CH3 and 2, especially for the fine-tuned Cu–Cu distances (Table 1), do affect the luminescence efficacy of [Cu3Pz3]2 and the subsequent ther- mochromic behavior, thus again verifying the above hypoth- esis. As shown in Figure 2a–c, when treated with a liquid-ni- trogen bath and exposed under UV lamp (365 nm), the ther- mochromic behaviors of the three luminescent MOFs are different. Under cryogenic conditions (77 K), all three MOFs show intense green luminescence. In contrast, when recovering to room temperature, the sample of 1·NH3 changes its emissive color from green to yellow with its brightness weakening; 1·NH2CH3 undergoes more marked color changes from blue-green to yellow and then to dark orange; the sample of 2 experiences bright green-yellow to fading yellow within the 60 s period. These observations verify the effectiveness of the chemopalette strategy, which can be further supported by the emission and lifetime meas- urements. Phosphorescence with tunable dual emissions: The lumines- cence spectra and lifetimes of 1·NH3 were reported else- where.[10] Two emission bands with the peaks at approxi- mately 540 (higher energy, or HE) and 680 nm (lower energy, or LE) occurred at room temperature (see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information for Gaussian fits), and the triplet-excited *Cu4I4 (*Cu4) and triplet excimeric *ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Cu3Pz3]2 (*Cu6) were responsible for the HE and LE emissions, re- spectively. The molar ratio of the two luminophores (*Cu4:*Cu6) is 2:1 in all three MOFs. The lower-energy exci- tation (370 nm) would first populate the *Cu4 triplet state, followed by the subsequent energy transfer that could sensi- tize the [Cu3Pz3] trimer to its triplet excited state (triplet ac- ceptor), and then the excimer formation of the dimer-of- trimers *Cu6 triplet state through one excited trimer react- ing with another ground-state trimer. In short, the [Cu3Pz3] triplet acceptor is involved in the energy-transfer process, whereas the *ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Cu3Pz3]2 excimer is responsible for the LE emission. Herein, the adjustments of the supramolecular mi- croenvironments in 1·NH2CH3 and 2 that lead to the subtle variation in the Cu–Cu distances in [Cu3Pz3]2 are supposed to affect the relative intensity of the LE bands in the emis- sion spectra. The thermochromic behaviors are believed to involve a thermally activated energy transfer,[10] but a more complex photophysical process that involves the generation of new excited states under cryogenic conditions is highly possible (see below). According to the temperature-dependent emission spectra of 1·NH2CH3 (Figure 2d), the LE bands with the peaks at approximately 630–650 nm are prevailing (compared with the HE bands that peaked at approximately 520–530 nm) over the whole temperature range, unlike the situation of 1·NH3 in which the HE bands dominate.[10] This is consistent with the structural feature of the shortest intertrimeric Cu–Cu distances in 1·NH2CH3 (Figure 1b and Table 1). The HE and LE bands are partly overlapped, which can be per- fectly fitted to two Gaussian peaks, for example, at 298 K, with maxima at 524 nm (19083 cm1) and 641 nm (15600 cm1) and full width at half-maximum (fwhm) values of approximately 3477 cm1 and approximately 2808 cm1, respectively (R2=0.9949; c2=0.56103; Fig- ure S8 in the Supporting Information). The same procedure was applied to the emission spectra of 1·NH3, thus giving two peaks at 538 nm (18587 cm1) and 676 nm (14793 cm1) and fwhm values of approximately 4154 cm1 and approximately 2765 cm1, respectively, at 298 K (R2= 0.9879; c2=1.02103; Figure S9 in the Supporting Informa- tion). Careful examination of the fitted Gaussian peaks at vari- ous temperatures reveals that the intensity of the two emis- sion bands in 1·NH2CH3 increased simultaneously upon cooling, consistent with the much brighter luminescence under lower temperature, which is probably due to the re- duced nonradiative transition. However, the increment rates of the HE and LE bands are different. The relative intensity ratio (IHE:ILE) of 1·NH2CH3 increases more than twice from 0.16 to 0.4 (Figure 2f and Table S3 in the Supporting Infor- mation), thus indicating a faster increment speed of the HE band upon cooling. Such different increment rates led to the emission color change from orange to green, which is re- sponsible for the thermochromism. In comparison, for 1·NH3, the relative intensity of the LE band decreases dras- tically upon cooling, whereas the HE band intensity increas- es steadily, thereby giving rise to the changes of IHE/ILE from 1.0 to 3.3 (Figure 2f and Table S3 in the Supporting Infor- mation). Commonly, upon cooling, the emission intensity should in- crease due to reduced nonradiative transition. However, for 1·NH3, the unusual decrease in the LE band at lower tem- peratures can be assigned to the reduced efficiency of ther- mally activated energy transfer from the HE to LE bands,[10] given that the lower-energy excitation (370 not 270 nm) does not match with the *Cu6 LE band. In contrast, for 1·NH2CH3, the HE-to-LE energy transfer seems efficient given the prevailing LE bands at all temperatures (Fig- ure 2d) despite being excited at 370 nm. This should be re- lated to the strongest intertrimeric Cu–Cu interactions in www.chemeurj.org  2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2013, 19, 10217 – 10225 10222 D. Li et al. 1·NH2CH3, which would reduce the energy level of the [Cu3Pz3] triplet acceptor (mediated by Cu–Cu contacts), and thus bring down the overall potential-energy curve for *Cu6 (Figure S17 in the Supporting Information)[10] and its cross- ing point with the *Cu4 potential-energy curve. Accordingly, the energy barrier (DE1 in Figure S17 in the Supporting In- formation)[10] of the HE-to-LE transition can be reduced to populate a larger number of [Cu3Pz3] triplet acceptor, there- by yielding more *Cu6 excimers. These results suggest that the populations of the *Cu6 excited states in 1·NH2CH3 and 1·NH3 are not equal, and can be regulated by the fine-tuned Cu–Cu contacts that are extremely sensitive to distance var- iation. Note that for 1·NH2CH3 the shortening of the Cu–Cu distance to 3.4228  (compared with the theoretically opti- mized value of 3.628 [14b]) is considered significant because the Cu–Cu interaction dies off rapidly as a function of dis- tance (approximately r6 dependence[14b]). It is noteworthy that the crystal structures of the MOFs are measured at 100 K, and it would be expected that, for 1·NH2CH3, the shortening of intertrimeric Cu–Cu distances in 1·NH2CH3 will result in the redshift of the LE band at 100 K, in addition to the increase in intensity as discussed above. However, a slight blueshift (LE bands peak at 631 nm for 1·NH2CH3 and 639 nm for 1·NH3, respectively; Figures S8 and S9 in the Supporting Information) is ob- served. This indicates that a more complex process is occur- ring, in which the electronic structure is modified by the change in temperature. If such an excited-state adjustment does not interrupt the energy-transfer process, one would expect an identical isoluminescent point[23] (the counterpart of the isosbestic point[23a] in absorption spectra) between the HE and LE bands. Yet the isoluminescent points in the emission spectra of 1·NH3 alter from 630 to 650 nm upon progressive cooling (Figure S11 in the Supporting Informa- tion). Such a shift means that a new excited species formed, further evidenced by the blueshift of the LE emission band and supported by the literature.[21a] By carefully examining the emission spectra upon cooling, we found that the HE band remains almost unaltered, but the LE band shows an apparent blueshift from 676 nm at 298 K to 613 nm at 50 K (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). Such a blueshift phenomenon in trinuclear pyrazolate systems was reported by Omary et al.[21a] through combined experimental and computational research. They offered insights into the gen- erality of this interesting counterintuitive spectral shift: It concerns the generation of multiple *ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Cu3Pz3]2 excited states, rather than a mere blueshift of one band. The singlet- to-triplet intersystem crossing can give rise to multiple phos- phorescent *ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Cu3Pz3]2 states, and this relaxation might be hindered at low temperatures to populate higher-energy triplet states. The internal conversion between different trip- let states is possible upon progressive heating, and thus lu- minescence thermochromism is observed. This rationale is valid for the LE band of this MOF system, and might be re- sponsible for the isoluminescent point shift. The photoluminescence decay profiles of 1·NH2CH3 at all measured temperatures monitored by 530 (HE) and 630 nm (LE) under excitation at 370 nm were fitted with triexpo- nential curves, with the lifetimes of approximately 2, 5–10, and 10–15 ms (Figures S14 and S15, and Table S4 in the Sup- porting Information), consistent with the results and assign- ment of the lifetimes of 1·NH3.[10] The microsecond-scale lifetimes indicate phosphorescence, and the slight increase in the lifetime values upon cooling is due to the reduction of the nonradiative decay rate. For 2, the temperature-dependent emission spectra (Fig- ure 2e) depict predominant HE bands with peaks at 556 nm at all temperatures, accompanied by broad tailings in the LE regions. The structural feature of the longest intertrimer- ic Cu–Cu distances in 2 (Figure 1b and Table 1) supports this luminescence profile. With temperature cooling, the in- tensity of the HE band increases gradually, thereby leading to the emission color changes. The Gaussian fitting applied to these spectral bands (Figure S10 in the Supporting Infor- mation) gives, for example, at 298 K, two Gaussian peaks at 556 (HE) and 646 nm (LE) with the IHE/ILE ratio of 2.8 (R2=0.9899; c2=1.04103), which are ascribed to *Cu4 and *Cu6 luminophores, respectively. The relative intensity of the HE and LE bands under different temperatures does not vary remarkably (Figure 2f and Table S3 in the Support- ing Information), thus indicating that the thermally activat- ed energy transfer from the HE to LE bands in 2 is ineffi- cient, probably due to the longer Cu–Cu distances (and hence weaker Cu–Cu contacts) that raise the energy level of the [Cu3Pz3]2 cluster at both the ground and excited states, and that generate a higher barrier for energy transfer. The very weak intensity of the LE bands does not rule out the possibility of partial population of the *Cu6 state directly from the 370 nm irradiation. The photoluminescence decay profile of 2 (Figure S16 and Table S4 in the Supporting In- formation) is similar to those of 1·NH2CH3 and 1·NH3, but it is noted that for 2 the fractional contribution of t3 is much smaller, sometimes even trivial by comparison, than the cases of 1·NH2CH3 and 1·NH3. This is consistent with the as- signment of t1 and t2 to *Cu4 and t3 to *Cu6.[10] The effect of the excitation wavelength in this system was also examined. According to the excitation spectra (Fig- ure S12 in the Supporting Information), the emission bands of 1·NH2CH3 and 2 excited at 270 nm under different tem- peratures are measured (Figure S20 in the Supporting Infor- mation). Relative to those excited at 370 nm (Figure S21 in the Supporting Information), it was found that the relative intensity of the HE and LE bands both decrease. Note that this is unusual for the LE emissions, given that the 270 nm excitation matches better with the *Cu6 excited state, but this is another piece of direct spectral evidence for the pro- posed HE-to-LE energy-transfer process in this supramolec- ular MOF system. Another striking feature in the luminescent profile of this MOF system is the absence of the even-higher energy band (450–500 nm) that accounts for the 3XLCT of Cu4I4, which was commonly observed in those discrete Cu4I4 complexes, such as Cu4I4Py4 [13a] and Cu4I4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(PPh3)4.[13c,d] But it is also noted that the 3XLCT band has been reported rarely for Chem.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 10223 FULL PAPER Metal–Organic Frameworks Cu4I4 cluster-based coordination polymers.[11] This mystery deserves to be explored in future research efforts. Conclusion In this work, a chemopalette strategy based on a supramo- lecular luminescent MOF system that involves Cu4I4 and [Cu3Pz3]2 luminophores has been developed. The three com- plexes discussed in this context, namely, 1·NH3, 1·NH2CH3, and 2, exhibit different interesting thermochromic behaviors regulated by the modification of two chemically inactive sites in the MOFs and the subsequent adjustments of the su- pramolecular microenvironments, particularly the fine-tuned Cu–Cu distances in [Cu3Pz3]2. Several pieces of structural and spectral evidence point to the origin of an HE-to-LE energy-transfer process coupled with an internal conversion between multiple triplet states of the LE band. This elec- tron/energy transfer is responsible for the MOF dual emis- sions and thermochromism. Such an investigation sheds light on how one might apply the operational definition of supramolecular species to lumi- nescent MOF materials, and is a good example of the eluci- dation of the structure–luminescence relationship in the MOF realm. The control of the thermochromic behavior en- ables one to understand these optical materials with unusual dual-emissive properties. This finding might find practical use for making thermometer-like phosphorescence-emitting devices. The chemopalette strategy[24] will be utilized in our further work by considering not only the tunable functional- ity of [Cu3Pz3]2, but also that of Cu4I4 and other effects.
