A novel three-dimensional (3D) lanthanide-organic frame- work [Pr3(NTP)3(H2O)6]·10H2O (1), (H3NTP = 3,3',3'-nitrilotripro- pionic acid) was synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, IR spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analyses. The results show that complex 1 is connected through NTP ligands to form a 3D network with microchannels. The coordination mode of the NTP ligand was found for the first time. In order to investigate the temperature effects Introduction The construction of coordination polymers, in which not only diverse structures but also multifunctional frameworks are generated, has been a field of rapid growth in supramolecular and material chemistry [1–4]. Over the past few years, a vari- ety of coordination polymers with organic linkers have been prepared through different synthesis routes, such as: slow evaporation of the filtrate [5], recrystallization [6], diffusion [7], the sol-gel method [8], and hydrothermal reaction [9]. Consequently, it is of great importance to take external factors such as pH, temperature, solvent, and reaction time into ac- count, which govern the crystallization process and overall sta- bility of the crystals. From this point of view, we focus our attention on the construction of novel coordination frameworks with tripodal ligands under different external conditions. It is known that flexible tripodal ligands, which may exhibit inter- esting conformation and coordination versatility, are widely used in the construction of supramolecular structures [10–15]. As such, over the years a great deal of interest has been fo- cused on the coordination chemistry, where H3NTA (H3NTA = 3,3',3'-nitrilotriacetic acid), as one of the important derivatives of glycine acid, acts as bridging ligand with a very high struc- * Prof. Dr. Y.-H.

Notably, in complex 3, the NTP ligand lost its two arms because of the high temperature. Furthermore, the thermogravi- metric analyses of the three complexes are discussed in detail. tural versatility, especially in complexation of one-, two- or three-dimensional systems [16–19]. H3NTP, similar to H3NTA, is also a good bridging ligand for the construction of metal- organic coordination polymers. However, to the best of our knowledge, few examples of H3NTP ligands were reported in coordination chemistry [20–22]. Therefore, in this paper, we report three interesting coordina- tion polymers [Pr3(NTP)3(H2O)6]·10H2O (1) [Nd(NTP)- (H2O)2]·H2O·HBr (2) and [Pr(H2O)][+NH3(CH2CH2COO–)]- [OOCCOO]1.5 (3). Besides, the thermogravimetric analyses of three complexes have been investigated. Results and Discussion Complexes 1–3 were obtained by the reaction of Ln(NO3)3·6H2O and H3NTP in aqueous solution at different temperatures. It was found that suitable crystals of 1–3 were obtained in temperature ranges of 25–80 °C, 80–100 °C, and 100–180 °C, respectively. Additionally, the compositions of 1– 3 were confirmed by elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy. The phase purities of the bulk samples were identified by X- ray powder diffraction (Figure S1a, b, c). The IR spectral shapes of complexes 1–3 are similar in some scales. The char- acteristic bands of the COO– vibration of the complexes are shown in the range of 1644–1525 cm–1 for asymmetric stretch- ing and 1311–1456 cm–1 for symmetric stretching. The bands at 2852 to 2923 cm–1 are characteristic for the νC–H vibration modes of –CH2– groups within the carbon chain of the NTP ligand. There are wide ν(OH) bands of H2O from 3375 to 3478 cm–1, which show the existence of H2O in three com- plexes. (Figure S2). The structures of the complexes were de- termined by X-ray diffraction and solved by direct methods [23]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All Y.-H. Xing et al. ARTICLE Table 1.

All calculations were performed using the program SHELX-97. Crystallographic data for the three complexes are summarized in Table 1. Single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed that complex 1 has an asymmetric unit containing three PrIII ions (Figure 1). Pr1 is coordinated to seven oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3, O4, O7, O8, and O8A) from five NTP ligands and two oxygen atoms (O5, O6) from two water molecules. Pr2 has an PrO9 environment composed of nine oxygen atoms from five NTP ligands, seven oxygen atoms (O9, O10, O11, O13, O15, O25, and O9C) from five different NTP ligands and two oxygen atoms (O14, O16) from two water molecules. Pr3 is also coordinated to seven oxygen atoms (O17, O18, O19, O20, O22, O24, and O24D) from five NTP ligands and two oxygen atoms (O21, O23) from two water molecules. The Pr–Ocarboxylate bond lengths are in the range of 2.390(6)–2.689(6) Å and 2.492(7)–2.546(7) Å for Pr–Owater, which are similar to those of the reported complex (H3NTA)Ln(NTA)(H2O)]n [24]. In complex 1, the three carboxylate groups of the NTP ligand coordinate to PrIII ions in different coordination modes (Fig- ure 2): (i) syn–syn-bridging bidentate [O7A–C6–O2]. (ii) syn– anti-bridging bidentate [O1–C1–O18E]. (iii) syn–syn-bridging tridentate [O9–C9–O13C]. The latter coordination mode of the NTP ligand is characterized as an extending mode and was found for the first time, which indicates that the NTP ligand is able to construct a flexible extended framework of complexes. The carboxylate groups of the NTP ligands coordinate to PrIII ions along three different directions to form a [Pr3(NTP)3] unit. As shown in Figure 3, the basic hole consists of 12 PrIII ions and 12 carboxylate groups of the six [Pr3(NTP)3] units. The 3D network with microchannels (along the a axis) is further constructed by these basic holes through six extending carbox- ylate groups of the [Pr3(NTP)3] units. 1586 www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2010, 1585–1590 There are one NdIII ion, one NTP ligand, two coordinated water molecules, and one lattice water molecule in the asym- metric unit of complex 2. The NdIII ion is coordinated by seven oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3, O4, O5, O5A, and O7) from five NTP ligands and two oxygen atoms (O6, O8) from two coordi- nated water molecules (Figure 4). The coordination modes of the NTP ligand in complexes 1 and 2 are the same. The Nd– Ocarboxylate bond lengths are in the range of 2.397(7)– 2.541(7) Å and 2.488(8)–2.537(9) Å for Nd–Owater. The aver- age distances of Nd–Ocarboxylate and Nd–Owater are shorter than those of complex 1. There is one PrIII ion, one [+NH3(CH2CH2COO–)] group, one coordinated water molecule, and 1.5 oxalate ligands in the asymmetric unit of complex 3. The PrIII ion is coordinated by six oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3, O7, O8, and O9) from three oxalate ligands, one oxygen atom (O4) from one coordinated water molecule, and two oxygen atoms (O5, O6) from two [+NH3(CH2CH2COO–)] groups (Figure 5). The [+NH3(CH2CH2COO–)] group acts in a μ2-η1:η1-bridging coor- dination mode. The oxalate ligand is coordinated to two PrIII ions in a μ2-η2:η2-bridging mode. As shown in Figure S3, the PrIII ions are interconnected through oxalate ligands and [+NH3(CH2CH2COO–)] anions to generate a 2D architecture. The Pr–Ocarboxylate bond lengths are in the range of 2.443(4)– 2.557(4) Å and 2.520(4) Å for Pr–Owater. The average distan- ces of Pr–Ocarboxylate and the distance of Pr–Owater are shorter than those of complex 1. The reactions of the complexes showed the effects of temper- ature on controlling the dimensionality of the structures. Com- plexes 1, 2, and 3 were obtained under different reaction condi- tions (Scheme 1), in which the reaction of ligand NTP with lanthanides provide complexes 1, 2 and 3 in temperature ran- ges of 25–80 °C, 80–100 °C, and 100–180 °C, respectively. Complexes 1 and 2 have intricate 3D architectures with nano- channels. The overall structures of 1 and 2 are similar; the Novel Coordination Polymers with Nitrilotripropionic Acid Figure 1.

Moreover, different to complex 1, the nitrogen atom of NTP ligand in complex 3 is protonated. Furthermore, it is interesting to see that the NTP ligand in 3 lost two arms, which leads to a less complicated 2D framework relative to that of 1. The results show that the effects of temperature on controlling the dimen- sionality of the complexes are topics of considerable impor- tance [25, 26].

In the second stage it experiences a 16.33 % weight loss in the temperature range of 157–346 °C, which is attributed to the release of six lattice water molecules and six coordinated water molecules (15.82 % theoretical weight loss). The last weight loss of 20.23 % was observed in the tempera- ture range of 355–686 °C, which is attributed to the release of six CO2 molecules (19.33 % theoretical weight loss) and after 686 °C, the remaining residues begin to decompose. As shown in Figure S5, the thermal decomposition process of complex 2 can also be divided into three stages. The first weight loss of 6.13 % between 64 and 195 °C corresponds to the release of two H2O (one lattice water and one coordination water) molecules (7.20 % theoretical weight loss). In the sec- ond stage it experiences a 20.05 % weight loss in the tempera- ture range of 201–378 °C, which is attributed to the release of one HBr and one coordination H2O molecule (19.79 % theo- retical weight loss). The last weight loss of 17.30 % was ob- served in the temperature range of 390–856 °C, which is attrib- uted to the release of two CO2 molecules (17.59 % theoretical weight loss) and after 856 °C, the remaining residues begin to decompose. As shown in Figure S6, thermal decomposition process of complex 3 can be divided into two stages. The first weight loss of 5.26 % between 206 and 271 °C corresponds to the release of one coordination H2O molecule (4.80 % theoretical weight loss). In the second stage, in the temperature range of 348– 798 °C, it experiences a 48.52 % weight loss, which is attrib- uted to the release of one oxalate group and one [+NH3(CH2CH2COO–)] group (48.74 % theoretical weight loss) and after 798 °C, the remaining residues begin to decom- pose.
