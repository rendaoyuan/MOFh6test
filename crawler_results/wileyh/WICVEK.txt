Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/chem.200601246 Synthesis, Structure, and Characterization of Three Series of 3d–4f Metal- Organic Frameworks Based on Rod-Shaped and (6,3)-Sheet Metal Carboxylate Substructures Feng Luo,[a] Stuart R. Batten,[b] Yunxia Che,[a] and Ji-Min Zheng*[a] Introduction There has been growing interest in recent years in the design and synthesis of heterometallic complexes, such as 3d–4f or 4d–4f polymeric metal systems, motivated by their fascinating structural topology and the exploitable applica- tions in magnetism, luminescent materials, molecular ad- sorption and bimetallic catalysis.[1] In a recent review by Shore and co-workers, existing Ln–M coordination polymers were summarized and a rational classification was proposed according to the different types of interactions between Ln M: 1) LnM direct bonds, 2) ionic associations, 3) Ln–link- ers–M.[1] For the Ln–linkers–M system in particular a large number of examples have been assembled from aggregation of Ln–M hetrometallic ions and diverse N-/O-donor ligands, which not only have attractive topologies but also interest- ing magnetic and luminescent behavior.[2] To target Ln–M coordination polymers by design, a reasonable choice of li- gands is important. In general, multidentate ligands contain- ing both N- and O-donor atoms are usually employed in the construction of Ln–M coordination polymers, in keeping with the typical coordination behaviors of Ln and M ions. For example, Hong and co-workers pioneered the study of the assembly of the suitable pyridine carboxylate ligands containing both N- and O-donor (such as pyridine-2,5-dicar- boxylic acid, pyrazine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid and several amino acids) with lanthanide and transition metal ions, and isolated a series of Ln–M coordination polymers with intri- guing structural motifs, magnetic and luminescent proper- ties. Yang and co-workers employed the rigid isonicotinic acid to construct the consecutive multinuclear Ln14Cu6 poly- mers.[3] Further research, however, is needed in this area. Thus, we report herein the investigations of the assembly of mixed 2,2’-bipyridine (bpy) (N-donor) and isophthalic acid (H2ip) (O-donor) ligands with Ln–Cu heterometallic ions as anoth- er route to Ln–Cu polymers. Abstract: Three series of porous lan- thanide metal-organic coordination polymers, namely [CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy)Ln3(ip)5- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(Hip)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)] [Ln = Er (1a), Y (1b), Eu (1c); bpy = 2,2’-bipyridine, H2ip= isophthalic acid], [Cu3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy)2Ln2(ip)6- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)5] [Ln = Yb (2a), Gd (2b), Tb (2c)], and [Cu3Ln2(ip)6] [Ln = Eu (3a), Gd (3b)] have been synthesized hydrothermally by the reaction of the combination of 3d–4f metal centers and N-/O-donor ligands. X-ray diffrac- tion analyses reveal that polymers 1a–c and 2a–c, as well as 3a,b are isomor- phous in structure. Polymers 1a–c con- sist of 3D a-Po networks based on a in- organic rod-shaped secondary building units (SBUs) of {Er6Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bipy)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2C)11} which are 27.03 @ in length. Polymers 2a–c also contain 3D a-Po networks, constructed from shorter (14.79 @) but similarly rod-shaped SBUs of {Yb2Cu3- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2C)12}. The structure also con- tains hydrogen-bonded (H2O)6 chains which can be reversibly dehydrated/re- hydrated. Polymers 3a,b contain metal carboxylate substructures which have 2D (6,3) topologies; these layers are bridged by the ip2 ligands to give an overall 3D network which contains two sorts of cavities. This series of Ln–Cu coordination polymers are further char- acterized by antiferromagnetic behav- ior.

K 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2007, 13, 4948 – 4955 4948 Results and Discussion Description of structures: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that polymers 1a–c, 2a–c and 3a,b are isomorphous. Thus, only the representative complexes 1a, 2a, and 3a are discussed in more detail. Crystal structure of complex 1a: The asymmetric unit of [CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy)Er3(ip)5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(Hip)]·H2O (1a) contains one CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy)2+ moiety, three ErIII ions, five ip2 ions, one Hip ion, and one intercalated water molecule. The Cu2+ atom is five-coordi- nate and coordinated to one bpy ligand and three ip2 li- gands, with pyramidal CuO3N2 geometry (the metal atom is displaced from the plane de- fined by N1, N2, O4 and O11 by 0.275 @). The Er1 atom has eight-coordinated, distorted bi- capped trigonal prismatic ge- ometry and coordinates to one Hip and five ip2 ligands. The Er3 and Er2 atoms both have seven-coordinated, monocap- ped trigonal prismatic geome- tries, coordinating to six ip2 li- gands, or one Hip/six ip2 li- gands, respectively. The ErO bond lengths (Table 2) range from 2.223(4) to 2.492(3) @. The ip2 and Hip ligands in turn show a variety of bonding modes, with ip2 adopting a range of tetradentate modes, and Hip bidentate, as shown in Figure 1. The ligands bridge the metal atoms into a complicated 3D network that can be simplified by considering the metal car- boxylate substructure. Long 27.03 @ octanuclear “rods” are formed which are composed of chains of six ErIII atoms terminated at either end by CuII- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy) groups. The rods lie across inversion centers, relating one half to the other, and the metals are bridged by carbox- ylate groups and m2-Ocarboxylate atoms to give the Er-O-C-O- Er, Er-O-C-O-Cu, Er-O-Er, and Er-O-Cu linkages (Figure 2). The metal carboxylate Er6Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2C)11 moi- eties can be considered as secondary building units (SBUs), with each rod connected to six others via the ip2 bridges (four rods are connected by four bridges each, while the other two are connected by pairs of ip2 bridges). Thus the SBUs act as six-connecting nodes, and a 3D a-Po network is formed (Figure 3). Figure 1. Schematic description of the coordinated modes for Hip/ip2 ligands in 1a–c, 2a–c, 3a,b.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 4949 FULL PAPER The long rod-shaped SBUs are unique and very different to other reported metal carboxylate SBUs, which include M2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2C)3, M2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2C)4, M3OACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2C)6 and M4OACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2C)6 globular cluster topologies.[4] One rod-shaped SBU has been report- ed: the structure of [Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdc)3]· 6MeOH (BDC = benzene- 1,4-dicarboxylate) contains trimeric Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2C)6 clusters acting as six-connecting SBUs; an a-Po network is also formed.[5] Crystal structure of complex 2a: The structure of [Cu3- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy)2Yb2(ip)6]·5H2O (2a) is similarly complicated, with the asymmetric unit containing two unique CuII atoms (one of which (Cu2) lies on an inversion center), one Yb atom, one bpy ligand, three ip2 ligands and five intercalated water molecules. The copper atoms have square planar geometries, with Cu1 coordinated to one bpy chelate and two carboxyl- ate anions (ignoring the weak Cu1–O7 interaction (2.675 @); the corresponding distances in 2b and c are 2.982 and 2.819 @, respectively). Cu1 lies 0.206 @ out of the plane of the donor atoms (0.172 and 0.182 @, respectively, for 2b and c). The Cu2 atom coordinates to four ip2 ligands. The Yb atom coordinates to six ip2 ligands with eight-coordinat- ed, distorted bicapped trigonal prismatic geometry. The three different ip2 ligands show two distinct coordination modes (Figure 1). The YbO bond lengths range from 2.228 to2.445 @ (Table 2). Like 1a, the carboxylate ligands bridge the metal atoms into rod-shaped motifs (Figure 4). In this case, the rods are pentanuclear, containing three Cu atoms and two Yb atoms. As before, the ends are terminated by CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy)2+ moieties (Cu···Cu 14.79 @), and the rods lie across inversion centers (upon which the central Cu2 ion lies). Remarkably, as for the octanuclear SBUs in 1a, the pentanuclear Yb2Cu3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy)2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2C)12 SBUs in 2a are each connected to six others (by pairs of ip2 ligands; Figure 5) to again generate the six-con- nected a-Po network. Another interesting feature of 2a are the 1D channels with approximate dimensions 10.7R13.3 @. These channels contain hydrogen bonded (H2O)6 chains (O13–O14 2.853, O13–O15 2.728, O15–O15A 2.986 @) and the larger Cu- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy) fragments (Figure 6).

KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2007, 13, 4948 – 4955 4950 J.-M. Zheng et al. Crystal structure of complex 3a: The structure of [Cu3Eu2(ip)6] (3a) is less complicated than the two previous structures in that it contains only one type of Cu atom, one unique Eu atom, and one unique ip2 ligand. The Cu atom is coordinated to four ip2 ligands in a square-planar ar- rangement, while the Eu atoms are coordinated to six ip2 ligands in an nine-coordinate distorted tricapped trigonal prismatic fashion. The ip2 ligand shows a tetradentane bridging mode to link Eu and Cu atoms in the Eu-O-C-O- Cu and Eu-O-Cu fashions (Figure 1.) Despite the simple asymmetric unit, the structure is nonetheless complicated, due to the high symmetry (rhombohedral space group R3¯c). Examination of the metal carboxylate substructure reveals that, unlike 1a and 2a, a 2D hexagonal network is formed rather than discrete rods, with Eu centers acting as nodes (Eu···Eu 7.60 @), and Cu atoms lying midway along an edge (Figure 7). These layers stack in an ABC fashion, and are connected by the ip2 pillars into an overall 3D network (Figure 8). Two different cavities are created, as shown in Figure 9. The smaller cavity (Figure 9a) lies between two ad- joining sheets and is composed of two EuCu3 groups bridged by six ip2 pillars (Eu···Eu 8.45 @). The larger cavity (Fig- ure 9b) also contains six ip2 pillars, but is defined by the hexagonal window of one sheet capped above and below by Eu nodes of the adjoining sheets, and thus spans across three sheets. The Eu···Eu distance from sheet 1 to sheet 3 is 15.02 @, while the Eu···Eu diameter across the hexagonal window of sheet 2 is 15.15 @. From the structures of the three series of 3d–4f polymers reported here, it is obvious that the bpy ligands play an im- portant template role in the formation of these products: i) if the Cu/bpy ratio is 1:1, polymers 1a–c will be the prod- ucts, in which each CuII atom is ligated by one bpy ligands; ii) when the Cu/bpy ratio is 2:1, polymers 2a–c are the only Figure 5.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 4951 FULL PAPER Metal-Organic Frameworks products with only one half of CuII atoms coordinated by bpy ligands; iii) if the bpy ligands are removed, obviously different polymers 3a,b are obtained. As mentioned above, in polymers 1a–c, the ip2 ligands adopt six-coordinated modes, especially the tridentate bridge from one carboxylate group, that is the key factor for the formation of the high metal nuclearity (octanuclear), rather than the pentanuclear in polymers 2a–c. Interestingly, through self-assembly, the two different SBUs (octanuclear, and pentanuclear) would like to give rise to the same struc- ture(a-Po nets). However, in the three series of porous lanthanide metal- organic coordination polymers, the average bridging LnO bond lengths mainly show a regular order: upon the increas- ing atomic number, the average bridging LnO bond lengths will gradually decrease; the reason may be the lan- thanide contraction. Magnetic properties: The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility data of compounds 1a,c, 2a–c and 3a,b were measured for crystal samples at an applied magnetic field of 1000–500 Oe in the temperature range of 5-/or 2–300 K. The plots of cMT versus T of these compounds are shown in Figure 10 and Supporting Information. As illustrated in these plots of cMT versus T, the observed cMT value for each compound is very close to the theoretical value at room temperature, expected for a coupling-free system of isolated LnIII and CuII ions, which confirms the as- signment of oxidation states as judged by the neutrality re- quirement (in polymers 1c and 3a, the EuIII ions with lower excited state of 7FJ are considered; at low temperature, the EuIII ions own the J=0 ground state (7F0)).[6] Upon the cool- ing temperature, the corrected cMT value decreases for all Figure 8.

The nature of such antiferromagnetic-like be- havior remains to be clarified for 4f–3d compounds, but it may be related to the progressive thermal depopulation of the LnIII Stark components and a possible the LnIII–CuII in- teraction. Because of the large separation between the LnIII ions and the well-shielded 4f orbitals by the outer shells of 5s and 5p orbitals as well as relatively low covalence of the lanthanide-to-ligand bonds, the Ln–Ln interactions are ex- pected to be negligibly small.[7] Thermogravity (TG) and powder X-ray diffraction analysis: Due to the structural similarities of all the compounds, only polymers 1a, 2a, and 3a were studied by using TG analysis to confirm the thermal stability of the present framework structure (see Supporting Information). In particular, for po- lymer 2a, a combination of IR, TG and corresponding powder X-ray diffraction analysis was undertaken to evalu- ate the reversibility of dehydration and rehydration of the chain-like (H2O)6 molecules. The thermal stability of 1a has been studied by TG. The TG, performed from 30 to 6008C with ratio of 108Cmin1, shows that the first weight loss of 1.2% from 80 to 1208C, corresponds to the loss of the one free water molecule (calcd for 1.22%). The decomposition of complex starts about 4208C. Under the same conditions, the TG of polymer 2a showed two major weight loss: the first weight loss of 5.3% from 80 to 1008C corresponds to the loss of the free water molecules (calcd for 4.7% for [H2O]2.5), and the second was due to chemical decomposition after 4008C. According to the IR bands at 3467 cm1, the encapsulated water mole- cules can be ascribed to the liquid water.[2] The powder XRD studies were performed on the crystal samples and heated at 30 and 1508C. Comparing the powder XRD pat- terns of 2a at 1508C with those of the samples at 308C, we found that the departure of the guest molecules does not lead to any phase transformation. However, the existence of guest molecules in this framework and the thermal stability encouraged us to remove the guest molecules and try to create the micropores (if the capsulated water molecules are removed, the volume of the cavities will be up to 215.2 @3 per unit cell, or 12.8% of the cell volume, centered on the position (0.500, 0.500 0.000)).[9] Thus we performed the fol- lowing additional experiments: i) dehydration: the crystal samples of 2a were heated at 1508C until there was no more weight loss, and in order to confirm the full weight loss of guest molecules, IR and powder XRD were mea- sured (IR without the 3467 cm1 band, XRD pattern without the water peak), and the result shows that the process of de- hydration was completed; ii) rehydration: the dehydrated sample was exposed to water vapor for about 24 h, and then IR and powder XRD measurements were repeated (IR with the 3467 cm1 band, XRD pattern with the water peak), which suggested that the rehydration had been completed (Figure 11). For polymer 3a, there exist no guest molecules in the per- manent, hydrophobic microvoids, which is consistent with the TG analysis: at 30–4008C, there is no weight loss, and decomposition occurs after 4008C. Conclusion Three series of 3D 3d–4f frameworks have been synthesized hydrothermally, based on the assembly of mixed 2,2’-bipyri- dine (bpy) (N-donor) and isophthalic acid (H2ip) (O-donor) ligands with Ln–Cu heterometallic ions. Topological analy- ses of the three series of complexes indicate that polymers 1a–c and 2a–c feature the same topology (a-Po nets) con- structed from different rod-shaped SBUs, and polymers 3a,b are characterized by the 2D (6,3) nets pillared by ip2 ligands. In addition, some other properties, such as the hy- drogen bonded (H2O)6 chains which can be reversibly dehy- drated/rehydrated, as well as the pillared (6,3) nets with two sorts of cavities, are also attractive for the potential applica- tion as porous materials.[11] The investigations of the mag- netic behavior of this system deserve further attention not only for the fundamental nature of Ln–Cu complexes but also for understanding the chemistry of such compounds al- ready in use and for future applications. It is believed that the preliminary results presented here may also provide a promising pathway to rational design of diversely 3d–4f frameworks, a goal that we are pursuing actively. Experimental Section Materials and instruments: All reagents were bought from commercial sources without further purification. IR (KBr pellets) spectra were re- corded in the 400–4000 cm1 range using a Perkin–Elmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrometer. The elemental analysis was carried out on Elementar Vario ELIII microanalyzer; TG analysis was performed with a heating rate of 108Cmin1 using a Netzsch STA 449C simultaneous TG-DSC in- strument. Magnetic measurements were carried out with a Quantum Design (SQUID) magnetometer MPMS-XL-5. Figure 11.

X-ray crystallography: Intensity data were collected on a Bruker SMART 1000 CCD bidimensional detector with MoKa monochromated radiation (l=0.71073 @) at room temperature. Empirical absorption cor- rection was applied. The structures of these polymers were solved by the direct method and refined by the full- matrix least squares on F 2 using the SHELXL-97 software.[10] All of the non-hydrogen atoms were refined ani- sotropically. The organic hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically; the aqua hydrogen atoms were located from difference maps and refined with isotropic temperature factors.
