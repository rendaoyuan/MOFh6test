Catalytic amounts of mercury activate the met- als and induce a C–S bond cleavage that in situ forms 2,2- bibenzimidazole.

Therefore a rational synthesis planning in form of crystal engineering attracts a lot of attention.[2] Rare earth chemistry places some new emphasis as it introduces a large bandwidth of coordination modes and numbers (between 3 and 16) with regard to the relatively low oxidation states.[3] This renders a large variety of different linkage types and topologies accessible for coor- dination polymers, that mainly consist of oxygen-containing ligands because of the high oxophilicity of the rare earth elements.[4] We invented a solvent free synthesis strategy for coordination polymers as an alternate option to solvent treatments. Self consuming ligand melts of suitable amines can oxidize lanthanide metals to give corresponding amides.[5] It is essential for the formation of coordination polymers that the ligands are sterically less demanding to avoid small molecular complexes.[6] Especially multi-N aro- matic heterocycles give Ln–N coordination polymers and [a] Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ludwig-Maximil- ians-Universität München, Butenandtstr. 5–13 (D), 81377 München, Germany Fax: +49-89-2180-77851 E-mail: Klaus.Mueller-Buschbaum@cup.uni-muenchen.de Supporting information for this article is available on the WWW under http://www.eurjic.org or from the author. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Instead of thiolate coordination polymers the reaction then yields sul- fur-free monomeric bibenzimidazolate complexes (BimH2)+- [Ln(BbimH)4]–, (BimH2)+ = C7H6N2+, BbimH– = C14N4H9–. Thus the amount of Hg also controls the dimensionality of the products by defining the reaction path. (© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The products contain mono-anionic 2-mercaptobenzimidazolate and di-anionic bibenzimidazolate ligands (see Schemes 1 and 2) and could be isolated as single-crystalline material for Ln = Ho (1) and Yb (2). The bibenzimidazolate ligand derives from an in situ ligand synthesis by C–S bond cleav- age and subsequent recombination as well as redox reaction with the metals (see Figure 1).[9] MbimH is also reduced by the rare earth metals with formation of H2 and LnIII ions. The C–S bond cleavage is promoted by the amount of mer- cury that is added as an activator for the rare earth metals. Hg is quantitatively transformed to α-HgS (cinnabar, 4, see Figure 2), which is formed as dark red crystals in the cooler parts of the reaction ampoule.[10] We believe that the high affinity of mercury to sulfur together with the Ln/Hg amal- gam formation is responsible for this double activator prop- erty. Formation of Hg-Mbim complexes[11a,11b] or hetero- metallic Ln/Hg thiolate complexes[11c] was not observed. Formation of Rare Earth Thiolate Amide Coordination Polymers Scheme 1. 2-Mercapto-1H-benzimidazole, 1H-benzimidazole, 2,2- bibenzimidazole. To the best of our knowledge this is the first example of an activator-controlled in situ ligand synthesis by C–S bond cleavage in the field of coordination polymers; C–S bond cleavage leads to oxygen-free products. This kind of bond cleavage was only rarely used for the synthesis of coordina- tion polymers before.[12] For none of the two ligands were rare earth compounds previously described.[13] We also proved that the in-situ-formed ligand 2,2-bi- benzimidazole cannot successfully be utilized in a melt syn- thesis itself as it decomposes around its melting point (395– 400 °C). Syntheses of comparable transition metal com- plexes show that the solubility enforces strongly coordinat- ing and mainly oxygen-containing solvents.[13] Considering the oxo philicity of the lanthanides this would lead to un- wanted solvent co-coordination and hence is not useful for our purpose. The in situ synthesis prevents both problems. Scheme 2. Reaction paths of the in situ syntheses. The activator Hg controls if thiolate containing coordination polymers or homoleptic monomeric anions of the referring LnIII ions are formed. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2009, 2482–2486 © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 2483 In addition, 1 and 2 can also not be obtained from 1H- benzimidazole as the in situ synthesis cannot take place in the absence of a C–S bond. 1H-Benzimidazole is instead transformed into a new high-temperature β-form 5 of the molecule.[14] For existence and formation of the coordination poly- mers 1 and 2 the presence of both sorts of ligands (Mbim– und Bbim2–) is essential as completion of the in situ synthe- ses of 2,2-bibenzimidazole by larger amounts of mercury does not lead to coordination polymers anymore. Homolep- tic monomeric ate complexes of the formula (BimH2)+- [Ln(BbimH)4]– are formed instead [single crystalline: Ln = La (3)].[15] The rare earth cations are surrounded by four mono-anionic 1,4-chelating bibenzimidazolate ligands (BbimH–) to give a square antiprismatic coordination of ni- trogen atoms (see Figure 3).[16] Constitution and structure of 3 correspond to other 1,4-chelating ligands in amides of the lanthanides like 2,2-pyridylbenzimidazolates.[6b,c,17] In contrast to the coordination polymers 1[Ln2(Mbim)4- (Bbim)] (1, 2) double deprotonation and back-side coordi- nation of BbimH– are missing in 3. For the first time S- coordination of 2-mercaptobenzimidazolate to rare earth ions is observed in 1[Ln2(Mbim)4(Bbim)] (1, 2).[19] The Ln ions are coordinated by a distorted pentagonal bipyramid of S and N atoms with short Ln–N and longer Ln–S dis- tances (Table 1). The bipyramids are linked via µ2-coordi- nating S atoms.[8] The di-anionic character of the Bbim2– ligands essentially adds to the polymeric character enabling front and backside coordination through all N atoms.

The synthesis is ac- companied by an activator-controlled in situ ligand synthe- sis of 2,2-bibenzimidazole that is essential for the forma- tion of the coordination polymers which are S-linked and O-free. Large amounts of the activator mercury lead the reaction path away from strand-like thiolates to homoleptic bibenzimidazolate complexes. The in situ synthesis can thus be controlled by the amount of mercury (see Scheme 2) and used for crystal engineering. It can thus be of interest for other multifunctional thioles, too.

It forms on the surface of the lanthanide metals. We also determined the crystal structure of this β-1-H-benzimidazole (5). It can be distinguished from the room temperature α-form by a closer overall packing (see Supporting Information and CCDC-716038). www.eurjic.org © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

[16] The negative charges of the square antiprismatic ions of 3 are compensated by benzimidazolium cations in a ratio of 1:1 re- sulting in the overall formula (BimH2)+ [La(BbimH)4]– for this salt like compound. As no benzimidazole was added to the reaction, the cations also derive from the C–S bond cleavage but with subsequent protonation instead of recombination to bibenzimidazole. The benzimidazolium cations are non-coordi- nating. Anionic benzimidazolates are not known for lantha- nides today. The cationic character is evident in a reduction of the aromatic character of the ring system by elongating C– N distances in the imidazole part. This behaviour resembles pyridylbenzimidazolium cations that also compensate the charges of corresponding square antiprismatic Ln-pyridyl- benzimidazolate anions.[6c] Further information on the crystal structure of 3 can be deduced from the Supporting Infor- mation.

No.: I200900208 Experimental 1 ∞[Ln2(Mbim)4(Bbim)] (Ln = Ho (1), Yb (2); Mbim- = 2-Mercaptobenzimidazolate, Bbim2- = 2,2´-Bis-benzimidazolate dianion) and (BimH2)+[Ln(BbimH)4]– (La (3), (BimH2)+ = Benzimidazolium cation, BbimH- = 2,2´-Bis-benzimidazolate anion)are obtained via a high-temperature oxidation of rare earth metals with 2-Mercaptobenzimidazole and varying amounts of mercury. The latter both functions as an activator for the metals as well as for a C-S bond cleavage. Hg getters the sulphur atoms from the bond cleavage and forms α-HgS (4). The reactions are carried out in the melt of the oxidizing thiole amine ligand without additional solvents and further produce hydrogen gas. The reaction mixtures were filled in Duran glass ampoules and sealed under vacuum. After the reaction, the products were obtained as single crystals together with S as well as C containing decomposition products. 1 – 4 were investigated by single crystal diffraction using a STOE IPDS and a Kappa-CCD (Bruker-AXS / Nonius) and electron dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDX) using an electron microscope JSM-6500F (JEOL). The decomposition products were also investigated with electron dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDX). All manipulations and measurements were carried out under inert atmospheric conditions using glove box (LABmaster sp, MBRAUN), ampoules as well as vacuum line techniques.
