Manuscript & Sensors Highly Selective Detection of 2,4,6-Trinitrophenol and Cu2+ Ions Based on a Fluorescent Cadmium–Pamoate Metal–Organic Framework Junwei Ye, Limei Zhao, Raji Feyisa Bogale, Yuan Gao, Xiaoxiao Wang, Xiaomin Qian, Song Guo, Jianzhang Zhao, and Guiling Ning*[a] Abstract: A luminescent cadmium–pamoate metal–organic framework, [Cd2(PAM)2(dpe)2(H2O)2]·0.5(dpe) (1), has been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions by using p-elec- tron-rich ligands 4,4’-methylenebis(3-hydroxy-2-naphthalene- carboxylic acid) (H2PAM) and 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene (dpe). Its structure is composed of both mononuclear and dinu- clear CdII building units, which are linked by the PAM and dpe ligands, resulting in a (4,8)-connected 3D framework. The p-conjugated dpe guests are located in a 1D channel of 1. The strong emission of 1 could be quenched efficiently by trace amounts of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), even in the pres- ence of other competing analogues such as 4-nitrophenol, 2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, nitrobenzene, 1,3-dini- trobenzene, hydroquinone, dimethylbenzene, and bromo- benzene. The high sensitivity and selectivity of the fluores- cence response of 1 to TNP shows that this framework could be used as an excellent sensor for identifying and quantifying TNP. In the same manner, 1 also exhibits superi- or selectivity and sensitivity towards Cu2+ compared with other metal ions such as Zn2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Ca2+. This is the first MOF that can serve as a dual functional fluorescent sensor for selectively detecting trace amounts of TNP and Cu2+. Introduction Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs), such as 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), are primary ingredients of industrial explosives, environ- mentally deleterious substances, and many unexploded land mines.[1] Rapid detection of these nitroaromatic explosives is attracting increasing attention due to their broad range of ap- plications in security, military operations, environmental man- agement, mine-field analysis, and in forensic and criminal in- vestigations.[2] Among such NACs, TNP is an extremely hazard- ous chemical with strong explosive capacity and a low safety coefficient. The compound is widely used in dyes, explosives, leather, fireworks, matches, and pharmaceutical industries,[3] and it can directly contaminate the soil and aquatic systems if it is released to the surrounding environment by some indus- trial processes. Furthermore, the leakage of TNP can also trig- ger skin irritation, anemia, abnormal liver functions, and male infertility.[4] Curiously, less effort has focused on detecting TNP than other hazardous substances,[5] so it is highly desirable to develop rapid, convenient and specific analytical methods for detecting this compound. On the other hand, as an essential biological metal ion, Cu2+ plays a critical role in a variety of fundamental processes in living biological systems.[6] However, at higher concentrations, Cu2+ can become toxic, leading to metabolism disorders such as Wilson’s disease and neurodege- nerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.[7] Therefore, the efficient detection of trace amounts of Cu2+ is also very impor- tant for assessing human health. Until now, various analytical and spectroscopic methods have been employed to detect NACs and metal ions,[8] but high cost, intricate operation, low sensitivity, and high levels of interference by other analytes associated with these methods have restricted their widespread use.[9] Recently, fluorescence- based detection of NACs or metal ions by using luminescent polymers, small organic molecules, and nanomaterials has at- tracted much attention because of the sensitivity, selectivity, portability, short response time, and convenient visual detec- tion.[10] In our continuing research on luminescent metal–or- ganic frameworks (MOFs),[11] we focused our study on the de- velopment of MOF-based fluorescent sensors for the detection of NACs or metal ions. MOFs are a novel class of inorganic-or- ganic hybrid materials that show structural diversity and po- tential applications for gas storage, separation, catalysis, mo- lecular magnets, and sensors.[12] Tunable porosity, functional [a] Dr. J.

KGaA, Weinheim 2029 Full Paper DOI: 10.1002/chem.201405267 surfaces, and the bulk conjugated backbone of MOFs can induce transduction of host-guest chemistry leading to detect- able changes in light-emitting color or luminescent characteris- tics, which can make them promising candidates for sensing applications.[13] In fact, some luminescent MOFs have been re- ported for detecting NACs or metal ions based on fluorescence quenching process,[14,15] but details of the mechanism are not clear. In particular, the rapid and selective detection of trace amounts of TNP or Cu2+ remains limited.[16] Herein, we report a new three-dimensional (3D) MOF, [Cd2(PAM)2(dpe)2(H2O)2]·0.5(dpe) (1) constructed from p-elec- tron-rich rigid-flexible ligand pamoic acid (H2PAM, 4,4’-methyl- ene bis(3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid)) and rigid ligand 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene (dpe) under hydrothermal con- ditions. The strong emission of 1 could be quenched efficiently by trace amounts of TNP or Cu2+ at room temperature, even in the presence of other competing analogues, which indicat- ed that 1 can serve as an excellent sensor for specific selective identification and quantification of TNP and Cu2+ through a fluorescence quenching process. Results and Discussion Description of crystal structure Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed that 1 is com- posed of a 3D framework crystallizing in the triclinic space group P1¯, with two CdII ions, two PAM ligands, two dpe li- gands, two coordinated water molecules, and half dpe guest molecule in the asymmetric unit. Two crystallographic inde- pendent CdII centers possess different coordination environ- ments, as depicted in Figure 1A. The Cd1 center adopts a seven-coordinate mode (CdO5N2) by bonding to four oxygen atoms from two PAM ligands, two nitrogen atoms from two dpe ligands, and one oxygen atom from a coordinated water molecule, forming a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. The Cd2 shows a distorted octahedral geometry [CdO4N2] by coor- dinating to three carboxyl oxygen atoms from three different PAM ligands, two nitrogen atoms from two dpe ligands, and one oxygen atom from a coordinated water molecule. The CdO and CdN bond lengths are in the range of 2.194(2)– 2.684(2)  and 2.292(2)–2.451(2) , respectively, which are com- parable to those found in the related CdII-pamoate coordina- tion polymers.[17–20] Two crystallographic equivalent Cd2 atoms are bridged by four carboxylate groups in bis-monodentate fashion to give a dinuclear cadmium molecular building block (MBB), [Cd2N4(CO2)4], with a separation Cd···Cd distance of 4.375 . Each mononuclear [CdO5N2] MBB serves as a four-con- nected node and dinuclear [Cd2N4(CO2)4] MBB acts as an eight- connected node, which are linked to each other by PAM and dpe ligands, forming a (4,8)-connected 3D network with the Schlfli symbol of {4.52.63}2{46.55.615.82} (Figure 1B and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). It should be noted that 1 has a small 1D channel along the c-axis, which is lined with p-elec- tron-rich naphthyl moieties of bent PAM ligands. The guest dpe ligand with coplanar p-conjugated structures is located in channels (Figure 1C). The p-p interactions (distance of the closest carbon atoms is 3.489 ) occur between naphthyl rings of PAM and guest dpe ligands (Figure 1D). This supramolecular wire-like arrangement and rich p-electron aggregated struc- tures are considered to be a beneficial feature because they lead to additional luminescent properties for fluorescence- based detection of NACs.[21,22] Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated framework 1 has excellent stability. As shown in Figure S2 (in the Supporting In- formation), the first weight loss of 2.19% from 30 to 1788C corresponds to the loss of coordinating water molecules (calcd: 2.42%). Then it is stable to approximately 2968C, when a second weight loss starts with the decomposition of dpe and PAM ligands. Luminescent sensing of nitroaromatic compounds The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of compound 1 in di- methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) exhibits a strong emission peak at 502 nm upon excitation at 371 nm at room temperature, which is redshifted (34 nm) in comparison with that of 1 in the solid state (Figures S3 and S4). A possible explanation for this redshift involves guest-dependent interactions between the framework and solvent molecules.[23] However, in solution, in- termolecular rotation and nonradiative relaxation pathways are increased through the collision between framework and guest molecules.[24] The fluorescence quantum yield of 1 (FMOF= 0.463) is higher than that of free H2PAM ligand (FL=0.063), which is probably due to the electronic coupling between neighboring ligands through the CdII centers, reducing the nonradiative decay of ligands.[24c] To explore the potential application of 1 in the detection of TNP, fluorescence-quenching titrations were performed by gradual addition of TNP (1 mm in DMSO) to a solution of 1 in DMSO. Very high levels of fluorescence quenching were ob- served upon incremental addition of TNP (Figure 2). The quenching efficiencies were estimated by using the formula Figure 1. a) View of the coordination environments of Cd2+ centers. b) View of the (4,8)-connected topological net. c) 3D framework showing the guest dpe ligands with space-filling representation of 1. d) The p–p interaction be- tween naphthyl rings of PAM and guest dpe ligand.

KGaA, Weinheim 2030 Full Paper (I0I)/I0100%, where I0 is the maximum fluorescence intensity of 1 and I is the intensity of 1 containing TNP solution. The ini- tial fluorescence intensity of 1 decreased by 98.4% when only 11.5 ppm TNP was added. The fluorescence quenching phe- nomenon could be easily detected even at very low concentra- tion of TNP (0.76 ppm). Good linear dependencies (R2=0.9945) of luminescence quenching efficiencies on the TNP concentra- tion were obtained, as shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. It is noticeable that the calibration curve plot of 1 toward TNP showed a detection limit of 1.76108 gL1. This system therefore represents a rare case of luminescent MOF materials that can be used to determine the concentra- tion of TNP quantitatively.[16,25] The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples before and after immersing in TNP solution are shown in Figure 3. Most peak positions of both samples were in good agreement with those of a simulat- ed pattern generated from the single-crystal structure analysis, suggesting that the framework remains intact even immersed in TNP solution. To compare the sensing selectivity of 1 toward TNP, the emission spectra of 1 were also recorded upon addition of other NACs, including 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), 1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB), 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4- DNT), nitrobenzene (NB), dimethylbenzene (DMB), bromoben- zene (BB), and hydroquinone (h-DQ), with the same concentra- tion (1 mm) (Figure 4 and Figures S6–S9). The quenching effi- ciencies (%) and corresponding Stern–Volmer (S–V) plots of dif- ferent NACs are plotted in Figure 5 and Figure S10 (in the Sup- porting Information), respectively. The electron-deficient 4-NP, 1,3-DNB, 2,6-DNT, 2,4-DNT, and NB showed little effect on the fluorescence intensity, with 14.8, 8.05, 8.30, 5.80, and 4.41% of the quenching ability, respectively. Interestingly, a slight fluo- rescence enhancement of 1 was observed when electron-rich DMB, BB, and h-DQ were used as analytes. Such luminescence quenching or enhancement response may be attributed to electron donor-acceptor transfer between 1 and the analytes. Similar change in the fluorescence intensity of MOFs towards guest molecules was detected previously.[14a,26] To examine the potential of the selective detection by 1 of TNP in the presence of other interfering NACs, a series of com- petition experiments were performed by gradual addition of a solution of different nitroaromatic analogues followed by TNP into 1, and the corresponding fluorescence spectra were monitored (Figure 6 and Figure S11–S15 in the Supporting In- formation). Taking addition of electron-deficient 1,3-DNB as an example (Figure 6A), initially, the addition of 1,3-DNB showed negligible effect on the luminescent intensity of 1, but a signifi- cant fluorescence quenching occurred after the addition of TNP to a mixed solution of 1 and 1,3-DNB. A similar quenching phenomenon was observed when electron-rich DMB and BB were taken as interfering substance, respectively. The stepwise decrease in luminescent intensity (Figure 6d) demonstrates the high ability of 1 for selectively detecting TNP even in the pres- ence of other nitroaromatic compounds. In addition, the fluorescence quenching of 1 dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was observed upon incremental addition of TNP (Figure S16 in the Supporting Information). The effect of water as a solvent on the detection of TNP was also monitored for practical applications. Due to poor solubility of 1 in pure aqueous solution, compound 1 was dissolved in H2O–DMSO mixed solvents and then its fluorescence spectrum was recorded by the dropwise addition of an aqueous solution of TNP. Compared with that of 1 in only DMSO, the fluorescent intensity of 1 in H2O–DMSO was slightly lowered with a slight redshift (Figure S17 in the Supporting Information), which may be attributed the effect of water polarity on charge transfer;[16a] nevertheless, significant quenching of the fluorescent intensity could be observed upon addition of TNP. These experimental results demonstrate that 1 constitutes a reliable and efficient fluorescence sensor for TNP with high sensitivity and selectivity compared with the response to other small nitroaromatic ana- logues.

KGaA, Weinheim 2031 Full Paper To date, although molecule recognition derives from the in- teraction between host and specific guest substrates,[27] the mechanism of selective sensing of explosives based on MOFs is not very clear. From the crystal structure (Figure 1) and ad- sorption isotherm (Figure S18 in the Supporting Information) of 1, it is confirmed that the lower porosity and small pore size of 1 reduces its ability to encapsulate analytes, so the fluores- cence response mechanism in our experiments might be at- tributed to light absorption and an electron transfer from elec- tron-donor to electron-withdrawer adsorbed on the surface of 1. This sensing mechanism differs from most of the known guest-induced fluorescence quenching or enhancement mech- anisms,[28] in which the analytes act as guest molecules that occupy the channels or cages of MOFs. To better understand the mechanism of detection, the ab- sorption spectra of 1 upon incremental addition of TNP were recorded (Figure 7A and Figure S19 in the Supporting Informa- tion). Two distinct absorption bands of UV/Vis spectra of 1 were observed at 291 and 366 nm. The absorption band in- tensity at 291 nm reduced rapidly with increased TNP concen- tration, indicating a strong interaction between the MOF and the TNP at ground state. Notably, the absorption band of 1 at 366 nm is buried in the strong absorption band at 379 nm of TNP, which indicated the light absorption by TNP is the main source for the observed fluorescence quenching. The spectral overlap between the absorption spectra of analytes and the emission spectrum of 1 were also checked. Figure 7B shows that the absorption spectrum of only TNP has a weak overlap with the emission spectrum of 1. So the resonance energy transfer between 1 and TNP should be negligible. The variation of the fluorescence lifetime of compound 1 was checked in the absence and presence of TNP. The emission lifetime of compound 1 showed a biexponential feature with t1=2.70 ns (3.01%) and t2=12.12 ns (96.99%) and this remained essential- ly unchanged in the presence of TNP (Figure 7C and 8D), which supports the previously indicated absence of significant levels of electron transfer.

KGaA, Weinheim 2032 Full Paper Luminescent sensing of metal ions To investigate the sensing properties of 1 toward Cu2+, PL spectra of 1 were recorded upon addition of different volumes of CuCl2 aqueous solution (1102 molL1) into a solution of 1 in DMSO (5104 molL1). Figure 8 shows the relationship between the luminescence quenching of 1 and the amount of Cu2+. The maximum fluorescence intensity of 1 was reduced by 77.6% at a Cu2+ concentration of 372 ppm. The emitted visible green light of 1 under UV-light was becoming signifi- cantly darker due to the incorporation of Cu2+ in 1. As depict- ed in Figure S20 (in the Supporting Information), a good linear dependency of luminescence quenching efficiencies on the Cu2+ concentration was obtained. The absorption spectra re- corded upon addition of metal ions to 1 is shown in Figure S21 (in the Supporting Information). The absorption band intensity at 366 nm decreased rapidly upon addition of only Cu2+ among other metal ions, which implied an interaction between the MOF and Cu2+. Other metal ions such as Zn2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Ca2+ as their chloride salts were used to further es- tablish the selectivity of 1 by fluorescence spectra. The fluores- cent intensity of 1 with different metal ions is plotted in Fig- ure 9a. Upon the addition of ten equivalents of each metal ion, only Cu2+ induced a clear fluorescence quenching; other metal ions had no significant effect on the luminescence inten- sity. Furthermore, to determine effect of the counter anions on Cu2+ recognition based on 1, a range of aqueous solutions of Cu2+ salts containing the anions Cl, NO3 , SO4 2, and (OAc) were analyzed. Figure 9b shows that the luminescence intensi- ty of 1 decreased upon addition of Cu2+ salt solutions contain- ing different counter anions, which demonstrates that the nature of the anion had a negligible effect on the lumines- cence intensity of 1. This luminescence quenching mechanism of 1 towards Cu2+ might be similar to that observed in {Mg(DHT)(DMF)2} (DHT= 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalate),[29] the desolvated microporous framework of which was exploited for the binding and specific sensing of metal ions through Lewis acid-base interactions. In further experiments, 1 was immersed in an aqueous solution containing CuCl2 (1 mm), and the solution was continuously stirred for 10 h to prepare Cu2+-incorporated product Cu2+@1. The latter powder was filtered and washed with water until the washing was colorless. The XRD pattern of Cu2+@1 showed similar peaks to those of 1, suggesting the framework structure remains intact even after metal immobilization in aqueous solution (Figure S22 in the Supporting Information). ICP studies on Cu2+@1 indicated that a small amount (0.64%) of Cu loading was present on the framework. It is evident that the functional sites including pendent hydroxyl groups of PAM and pyridyl sites of dpe in 1 could have an effect on Cu2+ rec- ognition. The interaction between the Cu2+ and 1 may induce energy or charge transfer through the partially filled d-orbital based on ligand field transitions, which has been demonstrat- ed previously.[6,15,29] The differential quenching effects of metal ions on the luminescence intensity of 1 may be attributed to their electronic nature. For example, Mg2+, Na+, and K+, having a closed-shell electron configuration, display essentially no quenching effects. Only with Cu2+ is the quenching effect significant, which demonstrates that 1 could be regarded as a potential material for selective sensing of Cu2+. Conclusion We have successfully synthesized a novel 3D lumines- cent cadmium–pamoate metal–organic framework, [Cd2(PAM)2(dpe)2(H2O)2]·0.5(dpe) (1) by employing p-electron- rich rigid-flexible ligand 4,4’-methylenebis(3-hydroxy-2-naph- thalenecarboxylic acid) and rigid ligand 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)eth- ylene. The material exhibits unique fluorescence quenching be- havior upon addition of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) or Cu2+. The high sensitivity and selectivity to TNP and Cu2+ shows that 1 could be used as an excellent sensor for detecting these ana- lytes, even in the presence of other competing analogues. This work presents a promising approach for preparing luminescent MOFs for detecting nitroaromatic explosives and metal ions by assembled p-electron-rich organic ligands and d10 metal ions.

The struc- ture was solved by direct methods and further refined by full- matrix least-square refinements on the basis of F2 using SHELXTL program. The heaviest atoms were found first, and O, N, and C atoms were subsequently located in difference Fourier maps. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms of 1 were calculated by geometrical models. Experimental details for the structural analysis of 1 are given in Table 1.
