Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/chem.200600730 Structural Variation from 1D to 3D: Effects of Ligands and Solvents on the Construction of Lead(II)–Organic Coordination Polymers Jin Yang, Guo-Dong Li, Jun-Jun Cao, Qi Yue, Guang-Hua Li, and Jie-Sheng Chen*[a] Introduction The design and synthesis of coordination polymers with un- usual structures and properties are attracting increasing at- tention, not only for their interesting molecular topologies, but also for their potential applications as functional materi- als.[1,2] Until recently, research on coordination polymers has focused on incorporation of s-, d-, and even f-block metal ions as coordination centers, while less consideration has been given to the metals of the p block, despite their impor- tance in electroluminescence, photovoltaic conversion, fluo- rescent sensors, and organic light-emitting diodes.[3] As a heavy p-block metal ion, lead(II), with its large radius, flexi- ble coordination environment, and variable stereochemical activity, provides unique opportunities for formation of un- usual network topologies with interesting properties.[4] Nevertheless, it is still a great challenge to predict the exact structures and compositions of polymeric compounds assembled by coordination bonds and/or p–p interactions.[5] The factors affecting packing of molecules and structure for- mation in crystallization are intricate and need to be further understood. The coordination environment of metal nodes, solvent, the nature of ligands used to connect the metal nodes, metal/ligand ratio, and noncovalent interactions such as aromatic–aromatic interactions that help stabilize certain architectures can all play a role in determining the network structure of a coordination polymer.[6] Systematic elucida- Abstract: A series of PbII coordination polymers [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dpp)] (1), [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ptcp)]·0.5H2O (2), [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dppz)] (3), [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(tcpn)2] (4), [Pb2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(tcpp)] (5), [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(Hndc)2]·H2O (6), [Pb- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dma)] (7), [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dma)] (8), [Pb(trans-chdc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)] (9), and [Pb2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(cis-chdc)2]·NHACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH3)2 (10), where ndc=1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate, dpp=4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, ptcp=2-phenyl-1H-1,3,7,8-tetraazacy- clopenta[l]phenanthrene, dppz=dipyri- do[3,2-a:2’,3’-c]phenazine, tcpn=2- (1H-1,3,7,8-tetraazacyclopenta[l]phen- ACHTUNGTRENUNGanthren-2-yl)naphthol, tcpp=4-(1H- 1,3,7,8-tetraazacyclopenta[l]phenanth- ren-2-yl)phenol, dma=N,N-dimethyl- ACHTUNGTRENUNGacetamide, bdc=1,4-benzenedicarboxy- late, and chdc=1,4-cyclohexanedicar- boxylate, have been synthesized from a hydrothermal or solvothermal reaction system by varying the ligands or the solvents. Compounds 1–5 crystallize with an N-donor chelating ligand and an aromatic dicarboxylate linker. Com- pounds 1–4 are 1D polymers with dif- ferent p–p stacking interactions, where- as compound 5 consists of 2D layers. The structures of compounds 7, 8, and 10 are 3D frameworks formed by con- nection of the PbII centers by organic acid ligands. Compound 7 is chiral al- though the ndc ligand is achiral, while the framework of 8 is a typical 3D (3,4)-connected net. Compound 10 is the first example of PbII wheel cluster [Pb8O8] units bridged by carboxylate groups. Compound 6 contains 1D chains which are further extended to a 3D structure by p–p interactions. Com- pound 9 consists of a 2D network con- structed by PbII centers and trans-chdc ligands. The structural differences be- tween 7 and 8 and between 9 and 10 indicate the importance of solvents for framework formation of the coordina- tion polymers. By varying the solvent the cis and trans conformations of H2chdc in 9 and 10 were separated completely. The photoluminescence and nonlinear optical properties of the coordination polymers have also been investigated.

Here we report represen- tative lead(II) dicarboxylate coordination polymers with or without N-donor chelating ligand: [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dpp)] (1), [Pb- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ptcp)]·0.5H2O (2), [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dppz)] (3), [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(tcpn)2] (4), [Pb2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(tcpp)] (5), [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(Hndc)2]·H2O (6), [Pb- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dma)] (7), [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dma)] (8), [Pb(trans-chdc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)] (9), and [Pb2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(cis-chdc)2]·NHACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH3)2 (10), where ndc=1,4- naphthalenedicarboxylate, dpp=4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenan- throline, ptcp=2-phenyl-1H-1,3,7,8-tetraazacyclopenta[l]- phenanthrene, dppz=dipyrido[3,2-a:2’,3’-c]phenazine, tcpn=2-(1H-1,3,7,8-tetraazacyclopenta[l]phenanthren-2-yl)- naphthol, tcpp=4-(1H-1,3,7,8-tetraazacyclopenta[l]phen- ACHTUNGTRENUNGanthren-2-yl)phenol, dma=N,N-dimethylacetamide, bdc= 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, and chdc=1,4-cyclohexanedicar- boxylate On the basis of synthesis and structural characteri- zation, the effects of ligands and solvents on the construc- tion of the coordination polymers are unraveled. In addi- tion, the photoluminescence and nonlinear optical proper- ties of the obtained compounds have also been investigated in detail. Results and Discussion Structures of 1–10: Compounds 1–3 have a PbII/ N-donor chelating ligand ratio of 1. Although we varied the PbII/N- donor chelating ligand ratio (1/1, 1/1.5, 1/2, 1.5/1 and 2/1) in the reaction mixtures, the same compounds 1–3 were ob- tained. Investigation of the structures of 1–6 reveals signifi- cant p–p interactions which guide the formation and stabi- lize the final structures. Selected bond lengths and angles for compounds 1–10 are listed in Tables S1–S10. As shown in Figure 1a,the asymmetric unit of 1 contains two ndc ligands, two dpp ligands, and two crystallographical- ly independent PbII centers. Each PbII center adopts a dis- torted DPbN2O3 tetragonal-bipyramid geometry by coordinat- ing to two nitrogen atoms from a chelating dpp and three oxygen atoms from two distinct ndc ligands, and the sixth coordination site is occupied by the lone pair of electrons.[8] Scheme 1.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 3249 FULL PAPER Atoms N1, N2, O1, and O7 constitute the base of the pyra- mid, whereas O8 and the lone pair of electrons occupy the axial positions with a Pb1O8 distance of 2.408(5) I. The PbO distances in 1 range from 2.391(6) to 2.519(5) I, and the O-Pb-O angles from 51.53(17) to 116.43(19)8. The car- boxyl groups of H2ndc are all deprotonated in 1, and they exhibit different coordination modes. In mode I, the two car- boxylate moieties of ndc chelate two PbII ions, while in mode II, each carboxylate moiety of ndc is bonded to one PbII ion (Scheme 2).[9] As illustrated in Figure 1b, each ndc ligand connects two PbII centers in mode I or mode II, lead- ing to zigzag chains with pitches of 11.399 and 11.646 I, re- spectively, where the Pb-Pb-Pb angle, defined by the orien- tation of the ndc ligands in the chain, is 98.58. The dpp li- gands are alternately attached to both sides of a single- stranded zigzag chain. More interestingly, the lateral dpp li- gands from adjacent chains are paired to furnish moderately strong CH–p interactions (ca. 3.646 and 3.657 I; see Fig- ure S1). When these interactions are taken into account, the 1D chain becomes a 2D network (Figure 1c). To investigate the influence of NCLs on the complex frameworks, two bulkier ligands ptcp and dppz were used under the same reaction conditions as for 1, and two new coordination polymers [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ptcp)]·0.5H2O (2) and [Pb- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dppz)] (3) were obtained. When ptcp is used instead of dpp, structurally different chains are formed in 2. The asymmetric unit of 2 contains one PbII ion, one ndc ligand, and one ptcp ligand (Figure 2a). The PbII ion is coordinated by four oxygen atoms of two ndc ligands and two nitrogen atoms of one chelating ptcp ligand to furnish a distorted CPbN2O4 pentagonal-bipyramidal geometry.[10] The O1, O2, O3A, O4A, and N2 atoms comprise the basal plane, while the N4 atom and the lone pair of electrons occupy the axial positions. The average PbO bond lengths are 2.568 I, and the O-Pb-O bond angles, which vary from 50.50(14) to 151.90(16)8, are very close to those of 1. The PbN bond lengths lie in the range of 2.462(5)–2.544(6) I (PbN1 and PbN2), slightly shorter than the corresponding bond lengths in 1. Each pair of adjacent PbII ions is bridged by one ndc ligand (mode I) to form an arm-shaped chain struc- ture running along the b axis with a pitch of 11.571 I, in which the Pb-Pb-Pb angle, defined by the orientation of the ndc ligands in the chain, is 138.58. Differing from the dpp molecules in 1, the ptcp ligands in 2 extend solely on one side of the chain in a slanted fashion (Figure 2b). The ptcp ligands of each chain are stacked with those of an adjacent chain through p–p interactions (Figure S2), generating a lad- derlike double-chain structure (Figure 2c).[11] The effective length of each ptcp ligand of about 9.951 I, thus provides Scheme 2.

The double chains recognize each other through another type of aromatic p–p stacking interaction of the ptcp ligands (Figure S2), which results in a wavy layer (Figure 2d) different from that found in 1, be- cause in 2 all the ptcp ligands are arranged on one side of each single chain. For compound 3, the asymmetric unit is composed of two PbII ions, two ndc ions, and two dppz ligands. Figure 3a illus- trates the coordination environments of the two crystallo- graphically independent PbII ions, which have similar dis- torted tetragonal-bipyramidal geometries. The Pb2 atom is coordinated by three oxygen atoms (O2, O5, and O8A) of ndc ions and two nitrogen atoms (N3 and N4) from one che- lating dppz ligand. The O2, O5, O8A, and N3 atoms com- prise the basal plane, while the N4 atom and the lone pair of electrons occupy the axial positions. The PbN and PbO bond lengths in 3 are near to those in 1 and 2. In contrast to those in 1 and 2, the carboxylate groups of the two ndc li- gands in 3 adopt different coordination modes (III and IV). In mode III, one carboxylate moiety of ndc chelates one PbII ion, while the other is coordinated to PbII in a mono- dentate fashion (Scheme 2). In mode IV, one carboxylate moiety of ndc bridges two PbII ions, while the other is con- nected to a PbII ion in a monodentate mode (Scheme 2). Compound 3 consists of interesting 1D ladder chains (Fig- ure 3b), the repeating unit of which is formed by three ndc ligands and four PbII centers. Two crystallographically dis- tinct dppz ligands (dihedral angle ca. 3.48) are attached to both sides of the 1D ladder. In addition, the neighboring 1D ladders interact by p–p stacking between the dppz ligands, which leads to interesting 2D supramolecular layers in the bc plane (Figure 3c). There are two types of p–p interac- tions between the dppz ligands: parallel dppz interaction (ca. 3.592 I) in the same ladder, and dppz interaction (ca. 3.601 I) between two different ladders (see Figure S3). In contrast to compounds 1–3, compound 4 has a PbII/N- donor chelating ligand ratio of 1/2. Although we changed the PbII/N-donor chelating ligand molar ratio (1/1, 1/1.5, 1/2, 1.5/1, and 2/1) in the reaction mixtures, the same compound 4 was obtained. Compound 4 also features an arm-shaped chain structure constructed from one PbII ion, two tcpn li- gands, and one ndc ligand. As depicted in Figure 4a, each PbII ion in 4 is surrounded by four oxygen atoms from three ndc ligands, and four nitrogen atoms from two tcpn ligands. To the best of our knowledge, a coordination number as high as 8 (excluding the lone pair of electrons) has rarely been observed in PbII complexes.[4] It is known that the two possible ground-state geometries for a nine-vertex poly- hedron are the symmetrical tricapped trigonal prism with D3h symmetry and the monocapped square antiprism with C4v symmetry.[12] The polyhedron of the PbII coordination sphere for compound 4 is best described as a distorted tri- capped trigonal prism with the ninth site occupied by its lone pair of electrons. The PbO distances ranging from 2.746(6) to 2.755(5) I are comparable to those observed in related PbII compounds.[4] Each carboxylate group of the ndc ligand chelates one PbII ion in mode I (Scheme 2), lead- ing to 1D arm-shaped chains (Figure 4b). The tcpn ligands extend on both sides of the chain, and the planes of adjacent tcpn ligands are nearly parallel. These parallel tcpn ligands are paired to furnish strong aromatic p–p stacking interac- tions with a face-to-face distance of about 3.455 I (see Fig- ure S4), which extend the arm-shaped chains into a wavy supramolecular layers in the bc plane (Figure 4c). Compound 5 has a PbII/NCL ratio of 2/1. Although we changed the PbII/tcpp molar ratio (1/1, 1/1.5, 1/2, 1.5/1 and 2/ 1) in the reaction mixtures, the same compound 5 was ob- tained. Single-crystal structure analysis revealed that 5 has a layered network structure built from interlinking of ndc li- gands with PbII ions. The asymmetric unit contains two crys- tallographically inequivalent PbII ions (Pb1 and Pb2), one tcpp ligand, and two ndc ligands (Figure 5a). The Pb1 center is located in a distorted tetragonal-bipyramidal coor- dination sphere, formed by three oxygen atoms from two different ndc ligands, two nitrogen atoms from one chelating tcpp ligand, and an electron lone pair. The carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O5, and O6) of the ndc ligands and one nitrogen atom (N2) from the tcpp ligand make up the basal Figure 3.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 3251 FULL PAPER Lead(II)–Organic Coordination Polymers plane, while the axial positions are occupied by one nitrogen atom (N1) and the lone pair of electrons. In the structure of 5 one ndc ligand is coordinated to the PbII centers in coordi- nation mode I, while the carboxylate moiety of the other bridges two PbII ions through one oxygen atom, while the other chelates one PbII ion (mode V in Scheme 2). The coor- dination modes in compound 5 generate a novel 2D layer structure with (4,4) grids (Figure 5b). Each corner of the (4,4) grids is occupied by a binuclear PbII subunit. In addi- tion, the interplanar distance between two neighboring tcpp ligands of adjacent layers of about 3.566 I (see Figure S5) indicates the presence of face- to-face p–p interactions that further stabilize the crystal structure and extend the layers into a unique double-layer structure (Figure 5c). Although double-layer coordination poly- mers have been reported,[13] s2 metal complexes with a double layer formed by p–p interac- tions have not been document- ed. On the basis of the results presented above, we conclude that variation of the N-donor chelating ligand leads to struc- tural changes, and sometimes is the dominant factor determin- ing the supramolecular structur- al features of the coordination polymers. To investigate effect of the solvent on structure formation, we synthesized single crystals of 6 in aqueous solution and of 7 in dma solution. The influence of solvent on the final network is demonstrated by the resulting structures of the compounds. The reaction of PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 and H2ndc under hydrothermal con- ditions at a temperature of 1858C gave rise to the coordi- nation polymer [Pb- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(Hndc)2]·H2O (6) as colorless prismatic crystals. As shown in Figure 6a, each PbII center in 6 is coordinated to six carboxyl- ate oxygen atoms from four dif- ferent Hndc ligands. The coor- dination geometry of the PbII ion can be described as a dis- torted pentagonal bipyramid with the seventh site occupied by the lone pair of electrons. The PbIIO distances of 2.456(13)–2.713(14) I are simi- lar to those around the PbII centers in compounds 1–5. The Hndc ligands in the asymmetric unit of 6 adopt a new coor- dination mode (mode VI in Scheme 2): only one carboxyl group is deprotonated and coordinates to two adjacent PbII centers, whereas the other carboxyl group is free. Planar centrosymmetric Pb2O2 ring units are formed (Figure 6b) and these units are bridged with a PbPb distance of 4.16 I in the same ring to generate a 1D chain.[14] Careful inspec- tion of the structure of 6 reveals that the ndc ligands are al- ternately attached to both sides of the chain, and are orien- tated either approximately parallel or perpendicular to the Figure 4.

Furthermore, the 2D supramolecular structures are held together through approximately perpendicular ndc p–p stacking interactions to form a 3D supramolecular structure (Figure 6d). Unlike compound 6, compound 7 was synthesized in dma solution. A single-crystal X-ray diffraction study revealed an extended 3D coordination framework that crystallizes in the chiral space group P212121 (no. 19).[15] The asymmetric unit of 7 consists of one PbII center, one ndc ion, and one coordi- nating dma molecule. As shown in Figure 7a, each PbII ion is six-coordinate, surrounded by five oxygen atoms from four ndc ligands (O1, O2A, O3A, O4A, and O4B) and one terminal dma molecule (O5) in a distorted pentagonal-bipyr- amidal coordination sphere, in which four oxygen atoms (O1, O5, O2A and O4B) and the lone pair of electrons make up the basal plane, while the axial positions are occu- pied by two oxygen atoms (O3A and O4A) from ndc mole- Figure 5.

The PbO distances range from 2.379(5) to 2.702(4) I, and the O-Pb-O angles from 69.42(15) to 168.24(13) I. Furthermore, the DPbO6 polyhedra are edge- shared through the O4 atom of ndc ligand to form a 1D in- organic PbO chain running along the [001] direction (Fig- ure 7b and c). The ndc ligand adopts an unusual coordina- tion mode in 7 (mode VII in Scheme 2): four carboxylate oxygen atoms coordinate to five metal ions, whereby one carboxylate is tridentate, and the other bidentate. In 7 neighboring O-Pb-O chains are bridged by the ndc ligands in all four directions to form a rare 3D chiral open frame- work (Figure 7d). Whereas chiral coordination compounds reported so far usually involved d-block transition metals and 4f lanthanide elements, p-block metal–organic com- pounds with a chiral structure are rare.[16] Compound 7 is an additional example of a chiral p-block metal–organic poly- mer obtained by use of achiral ligands. To investigate the influence of the organic acid ligand (ndc and bdc) on the structure, an analogous rigid bdc ligand was used under the same reaction conditions as for 7, and a completely different coordination polymer [PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdc)- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dma)] (8) was obtained. X-ray structure determination re- vealed that 8 has a unique 3D structure. As shown in Fig- ure 8a, the central PbII ion is coordinated by five oxygen atoms of three bdc ligands and one dma molecule in a tet- ragonal-bipyramid coordination sphere, in which the three carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O2A, and O4) and one dma oxygen atom (O5) make up the basal plane, while the axial positions are occupied by one oxygen atom (O3) from a bdc ligand and the lone pair of electrons. The carboxylate PbO bond lengths and O-Pb-O bond angles are in the ranges 2.440(4)–2.699(4) I and 53.02(11)–150.66(16)8, all of which are comparable to those found in 7. Interestingly, in 8 one of the two bdc linkers coordinates to two PbII ions in a bis- chelating coordination mode, while the other bdc ligand connects four PbII centers in a bis-bidentate mode (modes VIII and IX in Scheme 2). The bdc linkers in the bis-biden- tate mode bridge the PbII centers and generate a 2D extend- ed layer network (Figure 8b). Furthermore, all of the bdc linkers in the bis-chelating coordination mode connect the PbII ions from adjacent layers to form an interesting 3D open framework structure (Figure 8c). Topological analysis of the framework was performed by considering each bis-bi- dentate bdc ligand as a 4-connected node (Figure 8c) and each PbII ion as a 3-connected node because each bis-biden- tate bdc ligand bridges four equivalent PbII ions and each PbII ion is connected to three bdc ligands. In addition, the ratio of 3-connected to 4-connected nodes is 2/1. Thus, this structure is a typical 3D (3,4)-connected net with an unusual AB2 (A=4-connected vertices, B=3-connected vertices) composition in contrast to the usual A3B4 nets constructed by the Catalan or Archimedean types (Figure 8d).[17] Compounds 9 and 10 also exhibit solvent effects, as dem- onstrated by the corresponding structures. Compound 9 was synthesized by hydrothermal reaction of PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 and 1,4- cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (H2chdc, mixture of cis and trans forms in a ratio of 3/2) in a molar ratio of 1/1. The H2chdc ligand has three possible conformations: a,a-trans-, e,e-trans-, and e,a-cis-H2chdc. The e,e-trans form is thermo- dynamically more stable than the e,a-cis form because of the presence of two equatorial substituents in the latter, and the a,a-trans form is the least stable due to 1,3-diaxial hin- drance.[18] Single-crystal structure analysis shows that the central PbII ion of 9 is coordinated by five oxygen atoms from three different carboxylate groups and one water mol- ecule in a distorted DPbO5 tetragonal-bipyramidal coordina- tion sphere (Figure 9a). The carboxylate PbO bond lengths and O-Pb-O bond angles are in the ranges 2.285(4)– Figure 7.

More interestingly, the H2chdc ligands are deprotonated and only e,e-trans form of the chdc ligand is present in 9. In addition, the trans-chdc ligands show two coordination modes (modes X and XI in Scheme 2): in mode X, one e,e-trans-chdc ligand links two PbII ions by its two monodentate carboxylate groups, while in mode XI e,e-trans-chdc links four PbII ions with its two chelating/bridging carboxylate groups to form an infinite ladder structure. Adjacent ladders are further connected to- gether by the bridging oxygen atoms of the carboxylate groups (mode X) into a layer (Figure 9b). Compound 10 was synthesized from the solvothermal re- action of PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2, H2chdc, and dma. Single-crystal struc- ture analysis revealed that 10 is a rare 3D body-centered cubic (bcc) framework with the formula [Pb2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(cis-chdc)2] [NHACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH3)2].[19] Surprisingly, only cis-chdc ligands are pres- ent in 10. The asymmetric unit of 10 consists of two PbII cen- ters, two cis-chdc (modes XI and XII in Scheme 2), and one NHACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH3)2 guest molecule formed by decomposition of the dma molecule (Figure 10a).[20] The Pb1 atom is bound to six cis-chdc oxygen atoms, and Pb2 is bound to four cis-chdc oxygen atoms. The two nonequivalent PbII ions adopt dis- torted DPbO6 pentagonal-bipyramid and DPbO4 tetragonal- pyramidal coordination geometries, respectively. The PbO distances range from 2.372(10) to 2.737(8) I, comparable to those observed in the related compounds 6–9. A unique fea- ture of 10 is the presence of eight-connected [Pb8ACHTUNGTRENUNG(cis-chdc)8] wheel clusters (Figure 10b and c). The PbII ions are linked by m2-O atoms of cis-chdc bridges to give an unprecedented nanosized [Pb8ACHTUNGTRENUNG(cis-chdc)8] neutral wheel cluster and, to the best of our knowledge, this is currently the largest PbII wheel with bridging oxygen atoms.[21] Wheel clusters have attracted intense interest, not only because of their fascinat- ing physical properties, but also because of the architectural beauty of their structures.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 3255 FULL PAPER Lead(II)–Organic Coordination Polymers area has focused on the assembly of transition metal and lanthanide wheels, and the analogous chemistry of p-block elements such as Pb has hardly been investigated.[21] The metal wheels in 10 are further linked to each other to gener- ate a rare 3D bcc-type net (also called CsCl net) based on [Pb8O8] clusters as the eight-connected nodes (Figure 10d and e). Although the bcc-type net is commonly described in textbooks, such topologies with eight-connected nodes have only appeared in a few examples.[19] Effects of ligand and solvent: The role of the N-donor che- lating ligand in determining the supramolecular structures of coordination polymers 1–5 have been clearly demonstrat- ed. By varying the N-donor chelating ligand under the same synthesis conditions, we obtained five related compounds with three different PbII/ N-donor chelating ligand ratios. The compounds show great discrepancy in supramolecular structure because of the presence of the different N-donor chelating ligands. The nature (size and shape) of the N- donor chelating ligand is the underlying factor behind the discrepancy in structure and type of p–p interaction.[7] The two phenyl rings of dpp deviate slightly from the phenan- throline plane, while the ptcp, dppz, tcpp, and tcpn mole- cules are planar. The bulky phenyl groups in the backbone significantly increase the steric hindrance of the dpp ligand. In contrast to ptcp, the additional hydroxyl group present in the tcpp ligand results in different PbII/ N-donor chelating ligand ratios in the formed coordination compounds. These geometrical differences in the NCLs lead to the formation of 1–5 with quite distinct supramolecular structures under similar synthetic conditions. Compounds 1–4 have a 1D chain structure with PbII/ N-donor chelating ligand ratios of 1/1 and 1/2, while 5 displays a 2D network structure with a PbII/NCL ratio of 2/1. However, although the PbII ions have different coordination spheres and various coordination numbers, the final products do not depend on the metal-to- neutral ligand ratio in the reaction mixtures. Various metal- to-neutral ligand ratios were used in the reactions, but only compounds 1–5 were isolated as products. Clearly, for 1–5, the structure of the N-donor chelating ligand is the domi- nant factor determining the final supramolecular structure of the coordination polymer. The effects of the organic acid ligand were demonstrated by the formation of compounds 7, 8,and 10 under the same synthesis conditions. The rodlike ndc, bdc, and the relatively flexible chdc molecules have interesting features that are conducive to formation of versatile coordination structures. Both bdc and ndc are rigid rodlike ligands, while the ndc has a larger conjugated p system owing to the additional phenyl ring.[9] In comparison with ndc and bdc, the nonaro- matic chdc is a relatively flexible ligand having three possi- ble conformations.[18] Although compounds 7, 8, and 10 were synthesized under the same conditions, the structures of the compounds are completely different from one anoth- er. Thus, it is clear that the role played by organic acids with different ring structures (ndc, bdc, and chdc) is crucial in de- termining the network topology of the resultant coordina- tion polymers. Additionally, in contrast to the formation of 7 and 8, during the formation of 10 the dma molecule de- composes to a neutral dimethylamine molecule, which acts as a template[20] in the crystallization of the compound. This may be another factor that leads to the structural differen- ces among these compounds. The solvent is also an important factor in determining the structures of 6 and 7, and 9 and 10. The solvothermal reac- tion of H2ndc or H2chdc and PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 in dma solution pro- duces blocklike crystals of 7 or 10, whereas needlelike crys- tals of 6 or 9 are formed under hydrothermal conditions. In general, the effects of solvents can be explained in terms of their difference in size, shape, and coordination ability.[22] As dma and H2O molecules have different steric structures the resultant networks of compounds 6 and 7 also differ. In compound 10 the dma molecule decomposes to a neutral di- methylamine molecule, whereas the water molecule coordi- nates to the PbII ion in 9, and naturally these two com- Figure 10.

Chen et al. pounds have different network structures as well. The sol- vent is also an important factor for formation of the final structures of 6 and 7. Compound 6 with a 1D chain structure was synthesized by mixing PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 and H2ndc under a hy- drothermal conditions, while 7 with a rare 3D chiral frame- work was obtained under solvothermal conditions. Notably, the solvents also play crucial roles in conformational separa- tion of chdc ligands during the formation of 9 and 10. Al- though the separation of cis and trans conformations of H2chdc was successfully realized by careful adjustment of pH value,[23] there is no report on complete separation of cis and trans conformations of H2chdc by means of solvent ef- fects, especially by complexation of p-block metals. Com- pound 10 is the first example of coordination polymers con- structed with heavy metals such as Pb in which the cis and trans conformations of H2chdc are separated by changing solvent. Thus, the structural differences among compounds 7 and 8, and 9 and 10 show the importance of solvent in framework formation of the coordination polymers. Photoluminescence properties: Luminescence is of great im- portance in photochemistry and photophysics.[24] With regard to coordination compounds, studies have been essen- tially restricted to d10 and 4f metals, and little attention has been paid to the luminescence of coordination polymers of main group metals such as Pb.[8] The PbII compounds are a potential class of functional materials and ideal systems for investigation of structure–property relationships. The photo- luminescence spectra of 1–10 and the free ligands were ex- amined in the solid state at room temperature (Table 1). The ligands exhibit emissions at 472 nm for H2ndc (excita- tion at 392 nm),[9] at 390 nm for H2bdc (excitation at 347 nm),[20] at 387 and 404 nm for dpp (excitation at 347 nm), at 475 nm for ptcp (excitation at 393 nm), at 444 nm for dppz (excitation at 328 nm), at 381 and 424 nm for tcpn (excitation at 255 nm), at 430 nm for tcpp (excita- tion at 267 nm), and at 325 nm for H2chdc (excitation at 252 nm); see Figure S7. The emission bands for these free li- gands are probably attributable to the p*!n transitions.[9,20] On complexation of these ligands with PbII ions, the emis- sions arising from the free ligands were not observable. Compounds 1–10 each show an emission peak located in the red region (Table 1 and Figure S8). The emission peak varies slightly with ligand, as evidenced by a slight shift in emission from 605 to 621 nm (Table 1). Generally, the emis- sion of s2 compounds in the solid state originates from the 3P1 level (3P1!1S0, 3P2!1S0, and 1P1!1S0).[25] The energy of these transitions depends on the metal and is slightly modi- fied by the organic ligands, but the essential features of the spectra do not change.[26] The low-energy emissions of 1–10 have been commonly observed for other s2 metal complexes, and these emissions can be assigned to a metal-centered transition involving the s and p metal orbitals, as proposed by Vogler et al.[27] These results imply that the coordination of the organic ligands to PbII ions, although it yields differ- ent topological structures, has no significant influence on the emission mechanism of the metal coordination poly- mers. Nevertheless, the photoluminescent intensity of the coor- dination polymers is affected by the aromaticity of the ligand. On excitation, 9 and 10 emit red light significantly more weakly than 1–8. Energy transfer may be involved in the luminescent process of the compounds. In 1–8, it is pos- sible for the delocalized p bonds of the dicarboxylate ligand to interact effectively with the p orbitals of the PbII center, and this results in easier energy transfer from the ligand, which absorbs the energy of the excitation light, to the metal center.[28] In other words, the metal center in 1–8 is more easily excited in the presence of the aromatic ligand, and the resulting luminescence is stronger for these com- pounds. In contrast, 9 and 10 contain a nonaromatic ligand, and the interaction between the p-orbitals of the carboxyl- ate groups and the p orbitals of the lead(II) ion may be weaker in the absence of an aromatic ring in the ligand. As a result, energy transfer from the ligand to the metal center is less effective[20] for 9 and 10 during photoluminescence, and this leads to weaker emissions for these two compounds. The ligand in 6 and 7 has a naphthalene ring, whereas that in 8 contains a benzene ring. The photoluminescence of the first two compounds is more intense than that of the third. This further demonstrates that aromaticity plays a role in emission intensity of the coordination compounds. However, other factors, such as ligand rigidity, may also influence emission intensity, as the ligands in 6–8 are more rigid than that in 9 and 10. Compounds 1–5 contain both ndc and NCL, but their luminescence intensities are comparable to those for 6 and 7, that is, the N-donor chelating ligand plays a less important role in emission intensity of the com- pounds. Nonlinear optical properties: Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is only found in noncentrosymmetric materials.[29] Due to the practical importance of second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties in many technological applica- tions, there has been intense interest in employing crystal- engineering strategies to generate desirable materials.[30] A chiral framework is itself noncentrosymmetric, and therefore 7 is an acentric compound that has potential application as an NLO-active material. A powder sample of 7 was investi- gated by optical SHG at room temperature to confirm its Table 1. Luminescence data for organic ligands and complexes 1–10 in the solid state.

The intensity of the green light (frequency-doubled output: l=532 nm) produced by 7 is about 0.9 times that produced by potassium dihydrogenphosphate (KDP) powder, that is, the SHG effect is slightly weaker than that of KDP. The of SHG effect of 7 is consistent with its chiral space group. Solid 7 is totally transparent in the visible region and insolu- ble in common solvents because of its neutral 3D polymeric structure. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an NLO PbII coordination polymer constructed from achiral components.[31] Conclusion A variety of PbII coordination polymers with dicarboxylate ligands (ndc, bdc and chdc) have been prepared under hydroACHTUNGTRENUNG(solvo)thermal conditions. The N-donor chelating ligand, the organic acid, and the solvent all affect the net- work structure of the coordination polymer products. The crystal structures of 1–5 indicate that the geometry and size of the N-donor chelating ligand, which provides potential supramolecular recognition sites for p–p stacking interac- tions, are essential in determining the structure of the final assembly. The structural differences among 7, 8 and 10 high- light the effects of organic acid ligands on framework forma- tion of the complexes. The solvents used in the preparation of 6 and 7 and 9 and 10 also have significant effects on structure formation because of the difference in steric hin- drance. By changing the solvent the cis and trans conforma- tions of H2chdc in 9 and 10 are separated completely, and large PbII wheels [Pb8ACHTUNGTRENUNG(cis-chdc)8] with bridging carboxylate oxygen atoms were isolated. The photoluminescence and nonlinear optical properties of the compounds indicate that they may be good candidates for luminescent materials. This work greatly enriches the chemistry of self-assembly of PbII- based coordination polymers. Experimental Section Materials and physical measurements: The ligands dpp (Aldrich), H2chdc (Aldrich), H2ndc, H2bdc and other reagents of analytical grade (Huifeng Chemical Factory, China) were purchased and used without further pu- rification. The ligands ptcp, dppz, tcpn, and tcpp were synthesized by fol- lowing the procedures described previously.[32] CHN elemental analysis was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer 240C element analyzer, and inductive- ly coupled plasma (ICP) analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Optima 3300DV ICP spectrometer. The photoluminescent properties of the compounds were measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS55 spectrometer. Second-harmonic generation was tested on a powder sample by the Kurtz and Perry method.[33] Second-harmonic intensity data were ob- tained by placing a powder sample in an intense fundamental beam from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser of wavelength 1064 nm.

Crystal structure determination: Crystallographic data of compounds 1 and 5 were collected at room temperature on a Bruker-AXS Smart CCD diffractometer equipped with a normal-focus, 2.4 kW X-ray source (graphite-monochromated MoKa radiation with l=0.71073 I) operating at 50 kV and 40 mA with increasing w (width of 0.38 and exposure time 30 s per frame). Crystallographic data of compounds 2–4 and 6–10 were collected on a Rigaku RAXIS-RAPID single-crystal diffractometer equipped with a narrow-focus, 5.4 kW sealed tube X-ray source (graph- ite-monochromated MoKa radiation, l=0.71073 I) at a temperature of 2028C.
