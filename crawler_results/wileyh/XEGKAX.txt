Sharma, Prem Lama, and Parimal K. Bharadwaj*[a] Introduction Porous coordination polymers (PCPs) are a group of com- pounds that feature pores of desired shape and size as mo- lecular reactors, thereby allowing the encapsulation of spe- cific molecules. PCPs have found several promising applica- tions, such as in gas sorption,[1] sensing,[2] drug delivery,[3] and heterogeneous catalysis.[4] Compared to discrete molec- ular containers, the use of PCPs as heterogeneous catalysts have several advantages, such as high thermal stability, easy crystallization in high yields, insolubility in common organic solvents, fine tuning of the pores by ligand design, etc. One of the most-important discoveries in the area of PCPs is their flexible and dynamic properties that are characteristic of the cooperative action of a metal–ligand ensemble.[5,6] Flexible coordination polymers can reversibly change the shape and size of their pores in response to the penetration of guest molecules.[7] Moreover, the dynamic guest accom- modation of these soft structures would enable the uniform arrangement and orientation of guest molecules. This flexi- ble nature would be essential for producing molecular rec- ognition and efficient conversion, such as that found in en- zymes. It is now clear that molecules can behave quite dif- ferently when they are isolated from the bulk solvent and are restrained within a molecular reactor of defined shape, volume, and chemical environment.[8] Cyanosilylation and Knoevenagel condensation reactions are important CC bond-forming reactions that are cata- lyzed by Lewis acids and Lewis acids/bases, respectively.[9,10] In PCPs, vacant coordination site(s) on the metal and/or functional organic sites for possible interactions with reac- tants have been reported to catalyze these reactions.[11,12] Herein, we report the synthesis of a flexible porous GdIII- based coordination polymer, {[Gd2(L)3- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)4]·4DMF·3H2O}n (1), that showed reversible guest-ex- change in the cavities as well as in the metal-coordination sites. Compound 1 was an excellent heterogeneous catalyst for the cyanosilylation and Knoevenagel condensation reac- tions. When the reactants were put inside the pores of this PCP, they spontaneously underwent both of these reactions at room temperature and atmospheric pressure owing to iso- lation from the surroundings and being in close proximity to one another. This reaction was directly observed by X-ray crystallography because the host crystallinity was main- tained throughout. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the single-crystal to single-crystal (SC-SC) observation of cyanosilylation and Knoevenagel condensa- tion reactions inside the pores of a flexible coordination polymer. Abstract: A new flexible porous coor- dination polymer (PCP), {[Gd2(L)3- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)4]·4DMF·3H2O}n (1), was synthe- sized under solvothermal condition by reacting [GdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)3]·6H2O with the ligand 2,6,2’,6’-tetranitro-biphenyl-4,4’- dicarboxylic acid (H2L). Compound 1 had a 3D coordination polymeric struc- ture with two types of 1D channels (A and B) that were occupied by DMF and water molecules. When crystals of 1 were separately exposed to vapors of various aromatic aldehydes, either the lattice or both the lattice and metal- bound solvent molecules were replaced by aldehyde molecules. The aldehyde molecules inside the pores spontane- ously underwent cyanosilylation and Knoevenagel condensation reactions upon exposure to vapors of trimethyl- silyl cyanide and malononitrile, respec- tively. These reactions took place at ambient temperature and pressure. Moreover, both the reactants and the products translocated from one cavity to another. The products that occupied the cavity were expunged upon expo- sure to the vapors of an aldehyde. Be- cause crystallinity was maintained during these chemical transformations, direct crystallographic observation was possible. Herein, we showed that con- finement of the reactants inside the void spaces of the PCP led to the prod- ucts; we also assessed catalytic activi- ties of this PCP in bulk quantities.

J. 2012, 18, 6866 – 6872 6866 Results and Discussion The reaction of [GdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)3·6H2O] with H2L under solvo- thermal conditions formed block-shaped yellow crystals of {[Gd2(L)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)4]·4DMF·3H2O}n (1) in 55% yield. The ligand was chosen to afford restricted rotation about the CC bond that joined the two dinitrobenzoic acid moieties so as to impart a number of topological variations. More- over, the presence of nitro groups hindered the formation of interpenetrated structures. The crystalline product, once formed, was insoluble in most organic solvents and water, thereby making it possible to study the substitution reac- tions in a number of solvents. Compound 1 crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/c with a 3D coordination polymeric structure. The core structure consisted of a Gd2 dimer (Figure 1) that was constructed from two bridging car- boxylates, two chelating carboxylates, and two (syn, anti) carACHTUNGTRENUNGboxylates from six different L2 units. These dimeric Gd2 units were further connected to other similar units through L2 linkers to generate an infinite 3D structure (Figure 2). Each metal ion was also coordinated to one DMF molecule, thus giving a total coordination number of nine. The coordi- nation geometry could be described as distorted tri-capped trigonal prismatic (see the Supporting Information, Fig- ure S1). The GdO distances were in the range 2.350(4)– 2.712(4) ,[13] within normal statistical errors. Two phenyl rings of the ligand were not planar; rather, they were highly twisted (dihedral angle: 77.082 (10)8) owing to the steric hindrance of the NO2 groups. The 3D structure showed two types of 1D channels (A and B) running along the crystallographic a axis (Figure 3). The dimensions of the channels were 3.338.65 2 for chan- nel A and 2.408.24 2 for channel B (channel sizes were measured by considering the van der Waals radii of the con- stituting atoms); these channels provided a void space of 51.7% of the total crystal volume, as estimated by PLATON.[14] The overall 3D structure (Figure 2) was stabi- lized by an array of H-bonding interactions that involved lattice molecules as well as metal-bound solvent molecules. The larger size of channel A versus channel B resulted from the different relative orientations of the phenyl rings. Chan- nel A was occupied by six water molecules and six DMF molecules whilst channel B contained two DMF molecules. When single crystals of compound 1 were exposed to ben- zaldehyde vapor at ambient temperature for 5 days, {[Gd2(L)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)4]·2PhCHO·4H2O}n (2) was formed without a loss in crystallinity and preservation of the coordination environment of the Gd2 dimeric unit and of the overall framework structure (Figure 4), although the space group changed to C2/c (see the Supporting Information, Table S1). During this process, all of the lattice guests molecules in Figure 1. Coordination environment around the Gd2 dimer in compound 1. Figure 2. 3D packing in the crystal structure of compound 1.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 6867 FULL PAPER channel A were replaced by four benzaldehyde molecules (Figure 5; also see the Supporting Information, Figure S2), whilst all of the DMF molecules in channel B were replaced by eight water molecules. When a single crystal of com- pound 2 was exposed to trimethylsilyl cyanide vapor for 2 h at ambient temperature, {[Gd2(L)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)4]·(2-hydroxylphenyl acetonitrile)·3H2O}n (3) was formed without a loss in crys- tallinity. The coordination ge- ometry around each metal center remained intact (see the Supporting Information, Fig- ure S3), whilst four trimethyl- silyl cyanide molecules reacted with the four benzaldehyde molecules in channel A to form cyanohydrin trimethylsilyl ether. As all four cyanohydrin trimethylsilyl ether molecules could not be accommodated in channel A because of their bulkier size, so two of them came out from this channel. After that, two guest water molecules translocated from channel B to channel A and hy- drolyzed two lattice cyanohy- drin trimethylsilyl ether mole- cules to form cyanohydrin (Fig- ure 6a; also see the Supporting Information, Figure S4). As a result, only six water mole- cules remained in channel B. It is interesting to note that, when these two reactants were al- lowed to react in bulk quanti- ties in the presence of a catalytic amount of compound 1 (10 wt.%), we observed the formation of cyanohydrin tri- methylsilyl ether, which was further hydrolyzed into the cyanohydrin by acidic work-up. From the crystallographic investigation of compound 2, we found that, once benzaldehyde had entered into the cavity, it remained there through H-bonding interactions between its aromatic hydrogen atoms and the framework. To better understand the possible mechanism for substrate activation, IR spectroscopy was performed. The IR spectrum of com- pound 2 showed a C=O stretching frequency of benzalde- hyde at 1674 cm1, which was red-shifted by about 26 cm1 with respect to neat benzaldehyde (see the Supporting Infor- mation, Figures S5 and S6). This result suggested that non- bonding interactions between benzaldehyde and the frame- work led to activation of the encapsulated benzaldehyde molecules. Next, we investigated the Knoevenagel condensation re- actions in a similar manner. The exposure of a single crystal of compound 2 to malononitrile vapor for 2 h afforded {[Gd2(L)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)4]·2(2-benzylidinemalononitrile)·3(malononi- trile)·5H2O}n (4) without a loss in crystallinity. As above, the coordination environment around the Gd center re- mained intact (see the Supporting Information, Figure S7). Out of the four benzaldehyde molecules, two translocated from channel A to channel B and all of them reacted with malononitrile to yield the Knoevenagel condensation prod- Figure 5.

Channel A also contained ten water molecules and channel B contains six unreacted malononitrile molecules. This result suggested that eight malononitrile molecules en- tered into channel B and two entered into channel A. The pore-size of the initially empty channel B expanded owing to rotation of the phenyl rings on the ligand to accommo- date the malononitrile molecules. The increase in the number of water molecules was a by-product of the conden- sation reaction. Moreover, all eight of the water molecules from channel B moved to channel A. Therefore, the mole- cules translocated from one channel to the other as and when required. When crystals of compound 3 were exposed to benzaldehyde vapor for 5 days at room temperature, {[Gd2(L)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)4]·2PhCHO·6H2O}n (2’) was formed, which was structurally similar to that of compound 2. The only dif- ference was that channel B contained a few more water mol- ecules. However, when compound 4 was exposed to benzal- dehyde vapor for 5 days, the crystallinity of the product became extensively deteriorated and no structural data was obtained. To probe the catalytic activity of compound 1 in the cya- nosilylation reactions in bulk, an aromatic aldehyde and tri- methylsilyl cyanide were added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a sus- pension of powdered compound 1 (10 wt.%) in dry CH2Cl2 under a nitrogen atmosphere. In the case of benzaldehyde and 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2-PyCHO), the reactions proceeded to completion within 1 hour (Table 1 and Table 2). In each case, the conversion was monitored by GCMS (Figure 7 and Figure 8). The rate and the yield of the indi- vidual reactions depended upon the size as well as the nature of the reactants. For both CC bond-forming reactions, 2-pyridinealdehyde behaved like benzaldehyde, whereas 3-pyridinealdehyde and 4-pyridinealdehyde showed lower conversion at much slower rates. The separate exposure of a single crystal of compound 1 to the vapor of each aldehyde afforded {[Gd2(L)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)4]·2(2-PyCHO) ·6H2O}n (5), {[Gd2(L)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(3-PyCHO)2]·3(3-PyCHO)·3H2O}n (6), and {[Gd2(L)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(4-PyCHO)2]·6(4-PyCHO)·DMF}n (7) without any loss in crystallinity. In compound 5, four 2-pyridinealdehyde mole- cules occupied channel A (Figure 9a; also see the Support- ing Information, Figure S9) and twelve water molecules oc- cupied channel B. In both compounds 6 and 7, four corresponding pyridine aldehyde molecules occupied channel A and two occupied channel B. However, unlike in compound 5, in compounds 6 and 7, half of the metal-bound DMF molecules were re- placed by pyridine aldehyde molecules, with the pyridine ni- trogen atom coordinating to the metal ion (Figure 10 and Figure 11). In both compounds 6 and 7, the channels were Table 1. Cyanosilylation reactions catalyzed by compound 1.

The transparency and morphology of the crystals were re- tained during all of the single-crystal to single-crystal trans- formations (see the Supporting Information, Figure S12), which ruled out the initial dissolution of crystals in succes- sive vapors of the reagents followed by crystallization of re- nucleation at the surface and growth of the new phases. During the course of all single-crystal to single-crystal trans- formations, the nitro groups moved with respect to one an- other, which led to changes in the space and shape of the voids. These changes were induced by the introduction of guest molecules inside the cavity. The phase purity of all of the compounds was confirmed by powder XRD (see the Supporting Information, Figur- es S13–S19). TGA showed a gradual weight loss, owing to the expulsion of the lattice guest molecules as well as metal- bound DMF molecules in the temperature range 45–2508C and the framework remained stable up to about 3208C in each case (see the Supporting Information, Figures S20– S26). To test the heterogeneous nature of the catalyst in both the cyanosilylation and Knoevenagel condensation reactions, we performed control experiments. Removal of the catalyst from the reaction mixtures by filtration resulted in no fur- ther conversion, even after a long time (see the Supporting Information, Figures S27 and S28), which suggested that there was no dissolution of the catalyst during the reaction. Also, [GdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)3], as well as ligand L, were unable to cata- lyze the reaction, even at higher loading and over a long period of time. The powder XRD pattern of the recovered catalyst revealed that it had maintained its crystallinity during the course of the reactions (Figure 12). We also tested the recyclability of the catalyst by using the recovered catalyst in up to 3 cycles of the cyanosilylation and Knoeve- nagel condensation reactions of benzaldehyde. In each case, the catalytic activity remained unchanged (see the Support- ing Information, Figures S29 and S30). Conclusion It is well-known that both cyanosilylation and Knoevenagel condensation reactions are Lewis acid and/or Lewis base catalyzed. Herein, we have shown, for the first time, that both of these reactions could take place in the confined space that was provided by the pores of the flexible coordi- nation polymer. All of the catalytic reactions were moni- tored in a single-crystal to single-crystal manner. This study may have applications in observing many other chemically and biologically important reactions inside the pores of crys- talline hosts and should facilitate investigations of their mechanisms.

Experimental Section Materials: 4-Chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (97%), 2-pyridinecarboxalde- hyde (99%), 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (98%), 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (97%), trimethylsilyl cyanide (95%), malononitrile (99%), benzaldehyde (99%), and [GdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)3]·6H2O (99.99%) were purchased from Sigma– Aldrich and used as received. All of the solvents and copper powder (electrolytic grade) were purchased from S.D. Fine Chemicals, India, and purified prior to use following standard procedures. Physical measurements: IR spectra (KBr disk, 400–4000 cm1) were re- corded on a PerkinElmer Model 1320 spectrometer. Powder X-ray dif- fraction (Cu Ka radiation, scan rate 38min1, 293 K) was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance Series 2 powder X-ray diffractometer. Thermogra- vimetric analysis (TGA; heating rate 58Cmin1 under normal atmos- phere) was performed on a Mettler Toledo Star System. 1H NMR (500 MHz) and 13C NMR (125 MHz) spectra were recorded on a JEOL JNM-LA500 FT instrument in [D6]DMSO. Elemental analysis was car- ried out on a CE-440 elemental analyzer (Exeter Analytical Inc.). X-ray structural studies: Single-crystal X-ray data were collected at 100 K on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer by using graph- ite-monochromated Mo Ka radiation (l=0.71073 ). The linear absorp- tion coefficients, scattering factors for the atoms, and the anomalous dis- persion corrections were taken from the international tables for X-ray crystallography. Data integration and reduction were processed with the SAINT[15] software. An empirical absorption correction was applied to the collected reflections with SADABS[16] by using XPREP.[17] The struc- ture was solved by direct methods using SHELXTL[18] and was refined on F2 by the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXL-97[19] program package. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically (except as noted). The H atoms of the coordinated water molecule of compound 1 were located by difference Fourier synthesis. The H atoms of the uncoordinated water molecules in compound 1 and all of the water molecules of the regenerated crystals were not found on a differ- ence Fourier map. All other H atoms were placed at calculated positions by using idealized geometries (riding model) and were assigned fixed iso- tropic displacement parameters. Several DFIX commands were used to fix the distances of solvent molecules. The crystal and refinement data are collected in the Supporting Information, Table S1.

Synthetic procedure for the cyanosilylation reactions: A solution of aro- matic aldehyde (1.5 mmol) and trimethylsilyl cyanide (3.0 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (10 mL) was stirred for 5 min under an argon atmosphere and then catalyst 1 (10 wt.%) was added whilst maintaining the temperature at 58C. The suspension was stirred under ice-cold conditions for 30 min; the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. Once the reaction was complete, the catalyst was removed by filtration, washed with CH2Cl2, and dried in air for reuse. The organic layer was washed with 10% HCl solution. On evaporation of the organic layer under reduced pressure, a crude product was obtained that was purified by column chro- matography on silica gel (EtOAc/n-hexane). All of the products were characterized by standard methods and the data were correlated with lit- erature data.

Com- pound 1 (10 wt.%) was added to the solution and the suspension was stirred at RT. The reaction was monitored by TLC. On completion of the reaction, the catalyst was removed by filtration, washed with CH2Cl2, and dried in air for reuse. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness under re- Scheme 1. Ligand H2L. Chem.
