It is the first example of a 3D framework con- Introduction Extended solids containing manganese and bridging li- gands have been investigated widely in the past decades, mainly for use as molecule-based magnets in both funda- mental and potential applications, especially those that ex- hibit spontaneous magnetization,[1,2] and in the synthesis of manganese metalloenzyme mimics in some biological re- dox-active systems,[3] as well as the intriguing varieties of architectures and topologies displayed by these com- pounds.[4,5] In the research area of metalloenzyme mimics, carboxylate-bridged systems are the focus of investigation. To date, many manganese complexes of carboxylic acids with six-membered heterocycles, such as 2,3-pyrazinedicar- boxylic acid,[6] 2-pyrazinecarboxylic acid,[7] pyridine-2,6-di- carboxylic acid,[4,5] and pyridine-3,4-dicarboxylic acid[8] have been reported. However, the coordination chemistry of manganese and carboxylic acids with five-membered het- erocycle is less developed. 4,5-Imidazoledicarboxylic acid (H3IMDC) exhibits several interesting characteristics: a) it can be partially or completely deprotonated to generate H2IMDC–, HIMDC2–, and IMDC3– by controlling the pH carefully, which allows 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylate anions to display various coordination modes;[9] b) the departure of carboxyl groups from the plane of the imidazole ring may allow 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylate to be used for the [a] State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002, China [b] Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China E-mail: ygy@fjirsm.ac.cn Supporting information for this article is available on the WWW under http://www.eurjic.org or from the author.

To the best of our knowledge, transi- tion metal complexes of 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylate are usually either mononuclear,[10,11] dinuclear,[12] a 1D chain,[13,14] or a 2D layered network;[15] no 3D open frame- work is known. The typical coordination modes of 4,5-im- idazoledicarboxylate anions are summarized in Scheme 1 (a–i). Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and magnetic properties of the first 3D coordination polymer of manganese with multidentate IMDC as ligand and linker, namely [Mn3(IMDC)2(H2O)4] (1). Results and Discussion Synthesis and Structure As a few high dimensional coordination polymers of 4,5- imidazoledicarboxylic acid (H3IMDC) have already been documented, we aimed to assemble the IMDC ligands and manganese ions into polymers with an open framework. In general, H3IMDC is insoluble in water under neutral or acidic conditions at room temperature and is difficult to deprotonate under acidic conditions, which makes the con- struction of high-dimensional complexes difficult. In ad- dition, although the sodium salt of 4,5-imidazoledicarbox- ylate is soluble in water, it easily forms precipitates, rather than crystals, in the presence of manganese ions. Taking into account the above two aspects, we chose the insoluble manganese salt MnCO3 as starting material, with an H3IMDC/MnCO3 molar ratio of 2:1, and heated the mix- ture hydrothermally at 175 °C for 15 days, expecting that the insoluble MnCO3 should slow the reaction down and allow the H3IMDC time to deprotonate. We also carried M.-B. Zhang, Y.-M. Chen, S.-T. Zheng, G.-Y. Yang FULL PAPER Scheme 1. Typical coordination modes of the IMDC ligand. out the same reaction in a period shorter than 10 days, but no crystals were obtained. Thus, the slower rate and longer time may be crucial factors for the crystallization of 1. X-ray analysis revealed that the asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically independent Mn2+ centers, one IMDC ligand, and two coordinated water molecules (Fig- ure S1, see Supporting Information). The coordination mode of the IMDC in 1 is illustrated in Scheme 1 (h) and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. The coordination environments of the Mn(1) and Mn(2) atoms and the IMDC ligand in the symmetric unit are presented in Fig- ure 1. Both Mn(1) and Mn(2) are six coordinated to form two octahedra, Mn(1)NO4(H2O) and Mn(2)N2O2(H2O)2. In the Mn(1)NO4(H2O) moiety the six donors are one N atom of an imidazole ring, one water molecule, and four O atoms of four carboxylate groups, with one in mode A, two in mode B, and one in mode C (Scheme 1), while in Mn(2)- N2O2(H2O)2 the donors are two N atoms from two IMDC ligands, two water molecules, and two O atoms of two car- boxylate groups (mode A). As for the IMDC ligand, the carboxyl groups bonds to four Mn atoms in four different coordination modes:[16] a µ2-carboxylato-syn-anti mode for Mn(1)–O(1)–C(1)–O(2)–Mn(1d), a µ2-carboxylato-anti-anti mode for Mn(1)–O(1)–C(1)–O(2)–Mn(1e), a µ2-carboxyl- ato-anti-anti mode for Mn(2)–O(4)–C(4)–O(3)–Mn(1e), and a bis(µ2,η1-carboxylato) mode for Mn(1d)–O(2)–Mn(1e) (see Figure S2). www.eurjic.org © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The labels “a” or “b” refer to symmetry-generated atoms and the labels “A”, “B”, and “C” refer to the different binding modes of the car- boxylate groups of then IMDC ligand. Although both Mn(1) and Mn(2) are six-coordinate, the different coordination environments around them result in an Mn(1) dimer and Mn(2) monomer (Figure S3). In the dimer, the O(2) atom from a mode-B carboxylate group bonds two Mn(1) centers to form the dimeric unit Mn2(IMDC)2(H2O)2 [Mn(1)–O(2) = 2.169 Å] whose Mn···Mn distance is 3.477 Å; the O–Mn–O angle in the Mn2O2 ring is 75.46°, while the Mn–O–Mn angle is 104.54°. These values fall in the range of similar dinuclear manga- nese complexes.[17–19] In the structure, each Mn2(IMDC)2- (H2O)2 dimer further connects to adjacent dimeric units through O(1) from a mode-A carboxylate group and N(1) atoms to form a 2D layer in the ab plane (Figures 2 and 3). A 3D Manganese Coordination Polymer FULL PAPER It is worth noting the presence of left- and right-handed helical chains consisting of repeating –Mn(1)–O(2)–C(1)– O(1)– linkages in the layer along the [100] direction (Fig- ures 3 and S4). O(4) from a mode-A carboxylate group and the N(2) atoms coordinate to the Mn(2) center to give rise to the 3D open framework (Figures 4 and S5). In other words, the Mn(1) centers mainly contribute to constructing the layers together with IMDC ligand, while the Mn(2) cen- ters act as pillars between the layers. Figure 2. Layer containing Mn2(IMDC)2(H2O)2 dimers. Figure 3. View of the layer constructed by Mn2(IMDC)2(H2O)2 di- mers along the c and a axis; the imidazole rings of IMDC ligands have been omitted for clarity; L and R indicate the left- and right- handed helical chains. The thick, two-colored line represents the helical chains in the ab plane. The H3IMDC is completely deprotonated in compound 1, and all six potential donor atoms coordinate to four Mn centers through coordination mode h of Scheme 1, which plays a key role in constructing the 3D framework of 1 (Fig- ure S1). The previously reported coordination modes of the IMDC ligand, i.e. modes a and b of Scheme 1, can only coordinate to one metal center, thus monomers are the fa- vorable entity to accommodate them.[10,11] As for coordina- tion modes c, d, and e, they can link two metal centers through two chelating five-membered rings on the opposite side of the imidazole group to form a linear bridge. For example, if the IMDC ligands connect the metal centers along one direction, chain-like structures are formed as in [Mn(phen)(HIMDC)][13] and [Cd(HIMDC)(H2O)2][14] (Figure S6a), whereas if the ligands connect the metal Eur.

Mode f in Scheme 1 tends to yield a 2D layered network.[15] In the structures of a series of lan- thanide complexes [Ln2(IMDC)2(H2O)3]·nH2O,[9] the IMDC ligands displays modes g and i: in the g mode they connect three lanthanide atoms to form a 1D helical chan- nel, while in the i mode they contribute to connecting the helical channels to form a 3D framework. From the above discussion, we can conclude that multidentate modes of the IMDC ligand, such as g, h, and i, benefit the formation of higher-dimensional frameworks. IR Spectrum and Thermal Stability Analysis The absence of any strong bands around 1700 cm–1 in the IR spectrum of 1 indicates that 4,5-imidazoledicarb- oxylic acid has been completely deprotonated to generate IMDC3– anions. The sharp bands in the region 1581– 1541 cm–1 may be attributed to the COO– asymmetric stretching modes, and the bands at 1384 cm–1 are character- istic of the symmetric stretching modes of COO– (Fig- ure S7). The value of the difference ∆(νas – νs) between the two stretching modes is about 197 cm–1, which indicates strong coordination of the carboxylate oxygen to the man- ganese center. In contrast to 1, the presence of a medium intensity band in the region 1730–1710 cm–1 in the IR spec- trum of cis-[Ru(PPh3)2(L3H2)2] (L3H2 = H2IMDC) suggests that the 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylic acid is only partially de- protonated.[22] The TG curve shows that the structure is stable up to 210 °C, and the weight loss of complex 1 can be divided into three steps in the range 210–1000 °C (Figure S8). The weight loss of 13.5 % during the first step from 210 to 350 °C corresponds to the loss of four coordinated water molecules (calcd. 13.3 %). On further heating, the material loses weight continuously during the second and the third steps, with the combined weight loss of 47.3% (calcd. 47.5%) corresponding to decomposition of the IMDC li- gand. Assuming the residue is MnO, the observed weight M.-B. Zhang, Y.-M. Chen, S.-T. Zheng, G.-Y. Yang FULL PAPER (38.8%) is in good agreement with the calculated value (39.2%). Magnetic Properties Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measure- ments for complex 1 were performed over a temperature range from 5 to 300 K at 5 kOe. The magnetic susceptibility above 6 K obeys the Curie–Weiss law and gives a Curie con- stant, C, of 13.6cm3Kmol–1 and a Weiss constant, θ, of –14.1 K. The value of C is in agreement with that expected for three magnetically isolated Mn2+ ions with S = 5/2 (13.1cm3Kmol–1; g = 2). Upon cooling, the value of χMT decreases monotonically, attaining a value of 3.0cm3Kmol–1 at 5 K. Such behavior is characteristic of the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions be- tween the neighboring Mn2+ ions (Figure 5). Figure 5. Plot of the χMT product and χM versus T for complex 1. The solid lines represent the best fit to the model with inclusion of the ZFS term. From the known structural data, there are four types of Mn···Mn exchange pathways via the carboxylate groups in the structure (Figure S2). As the Mn···Mn distance of 3.477 Å within the bis(µ2,η1-carboxylato)-bridged bimetal- lic Mn2O2 core is much shorter than the Mn···Mn separa- tions of 5.60–6.52 Å through µ2-1,3-carboxylato modes (in anti-anti/syn-anti) or an IMDC bridge, and the latter is gen- erally less capable of transmitting magnetic interac- tions,[13,23–26] we can simplify the coupling interaction sys- tem as a doubly µ2,η1-carboxylato-bridged dimeric manga- nese combining an isolated Mn(2)2+ ion. The magnetic be- havior of the compound is therefore approximated by the sum of the contributions of one Mn2+ dimer (Bleaney– Bowers-like equation based on the isotropic Heisenberg model H = –2JS1·S2)[27] and one isolated Mn2+ ion, in which a Weiss constant, θ, is included to describe the inter- dimer interactions and the exchange coupling between Mn1 and Mn2 is neglected. The corresponding analytical expres- sion for the χMT product is given as follows [Equations (1), (2), and (3)]. χMT = χdimerT + χmonoT (1) where www.eurjic.org © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2006, 1423–1428 1426 and (3) in which N, g, k, and β have their usual meanings, and J is the exchange coupling constant between the doubly µ2,η1- carboxylato-bridged manganese ions. The fitting using Equation (1) gave a satisfactory result above 10 K with the superexchange parameters J = –1.34 cm–1, θ = –7.40 K, and g = 2.03. The agreement factor R, defined as Σ[(χMT) obs – (χMT)calc]2/Σ(χMT2obs) is equal to 1.85×10–3. These val- ues confirm the antiferromagnetic character of the magnetic interaction between the Mn2+ ions via double µ2,η1-carbox- ylato bridges. The deviation below 10 K may arise from the neglect of the coupling interactions involving the Mn(2) ion or its zero-field splitting (ZFS). When the zero-field splitting (D) of the Mn(2) ions is considered by using the theoretical expression[28] for an S = 5/2 spin instead of Equation (3), a better agreement be- tween the observed and calculated χMT value at low tem- perature is found with the four-parameter fits than with the three-parameter fit. However, the parameters D and θ are strongly dependent on each other, therefore it is difficult to calculate these values with reasonable accuracy. If the val- ues of J, g, and θ are constrained to the value obtained by the simplified expression based on Equations (2) and (3), the best fitting based on the model with inclusion of ZFS term yields D = 7.89 cm–1 with R = 5.4×10–4. The D value is obviously larger than those observed in similar sys- tems,[29,30] suggesting that there are still some disparities be- tween the present magnetic model and the actual magnetic interaction system. The small J value (–1.34 cm–1) indicates weak antiferromagnetic coupling in the dimeric units of complex 1, which is comparable to the values found in the doubly µ2,η1-carboxylato-bridged manganese complexes (–0.631 to –0.942 cm–1).[19,25] Due to a shorter Mn···Mn distance (3.477 Å), the J value of 1 is slightly larger than those of the above mentioned manganese complexes (3.67– 3.73 Å). Conclusion In summary, we have synthesized a novel 3D Mn-IMDC coordination polymer under hydrothermal conditions. The structure is constructed from [Mn(H2O)2] pillars and [Mn2(IMDC)2(H2O)2] layers containing left- and right-han- ded helical chains. The 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylic acids are completely deprotonated and adopt coordination mode h of Scheme 1. Compared with the coordination modes shown in this scheme, mode h allows the 4,5-imidazoled- icarboxylate ligand to form a high dimensional framework. The TG curve shows 1 is very stable below 210 °C and the magnetic measurement of 1 indicates the presence of weak antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. A 3D Manganese Coordination Polymer FULL PAPER Experimental Section General Remarks: 4,5-Imidazoledicarboxylic acid (H3IMDC) and MnCO3 were purchased from commercial sources and used as re- ceived. Elemental analysis (C,H,N) was carried out with a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. IR spectra (400–4000 cm–1) were re- corded from KBr pellets on an ABB Bomem IR MB102 series spec- trophotometer. The thermogravimetric analysis was performed with a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e analyzer in N2 with a heat- ing rate of 10 °Cmin–1 from 30 to 1000 °C. The variable-tempera- ture magnetic susceptibility measurement of a crystalline sample was performed in a field of 5 kOe with a Quantum Design MPMS- 7 magnetometer; the susceptibility of the sample holder and dia- magnetic contribution were subtracted from the raw data for the complexes. Synthesis and Initial Characterization: A mixture of H3IMDC (0.2341 g, 1.5 mmol), MnCO3 (0.0862 g, 0.75 mmol), and H2O (5 mL; MnCO3/H3IMDC/H2O molar ratio of 1:2:370) was stirred under ambient conditions. The resulting mixture with a pH of 4 was sealed in a 25-mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated at 175 °C for 15 d under autogenous pressure. After cooling to room temperature, the colorless prismatic crystals of 1 were filtered off, washed with distilled water, and dried at ambient temperature (39 mg, yield 28.7% based on MnCO3).

No.: I200500883 Figure S1. The ansymmetric unit of complex 1. The labels "a" or "b" refer to symmetry-generated atoms, and the purple labels "A", "B" and "C" refer to the different modes of carboxylate groups on IMDC Figure S2. Coordination mode of the IMDC in complex 1. The purple labels "A", "B" and "C" refer to the different modes of carboxylate groups on IMDC. The labels "a" or "b" refer to symmetry- generated atoms. The green folding line represents the Mn(1)-O(1)-C(1)-O(2)-Mn(1d) exchange pathway via µ2-carboxylato-syn-anti bridging mode; the red folding line represents the Mn(1)- O(1)-C(1)-O(2)-Mn(1e) pathway via µ2-carboxylato-anti-anti bridging mode; the red folding line represents the Mn(2)-O(4)-C(4)-O(3)-Mn(1e) pathway via µ2-carboxylato-anti-anti bridging mode; the blue folding line represents the Mn(1d)-O(2)-Mn(1e) pathway via the bis(µ2,η1-carboxylato) bridging mode. Figure S3. Linkage between Mn2(imdc)2(H2O)2 dimer and Mn(2) center. Figure S4. View of left- and right-hand helical chains linked through O(2) atoms. Figure S5. Polyhedron representation of the 3-D framework of complex 1. Figure S6. View of square, cubane-like and chain-like structure constructed by 4,5-imidazole- dicarboxylate in reported transition metal complexes. Figure S7. IR spectra of Mn3(IMDC)2(H2O)4(II) and 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylic acid (I). In the IR spectrum, sharp bands in the 1581–1541cm-1 ranges may be attributed to –COO- asymmetric stretching modes and the 1384cm-1 bands are characteristic symmetric stretching modes of –COO-. The broad bands at 3220–3443 cm-1 are attributed to the vibrations of the water ligand. 0 200 400 600 800 1000 40 60 80 100 weight% T/ oC Figure S8. TG curve of complex 1.
