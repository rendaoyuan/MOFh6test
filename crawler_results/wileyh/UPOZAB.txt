However, hydrogen storage is a dif- ficult problem that still has to be solved. Investigation of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as porous materials for hydrogen storage is currently an important research field.[1] Due to a recent requirement of the United States Depart- ment of Energy, a hydrogen storage tank must contain 6 wt% of hydrogen. Hydrogen uptake depends on several properties of porous material. At low pressure, hydrogen uptake correlates with the heat of adsorption. At intermedi- ate pressure (30 bar), uptake correlates with the surface area, and at high pressure (100 bar and more), uptake corre- lates with the free volume.[2] Uptake values up to 10 wt% H2 at 100 bar and 77 K were reported for MOF-5.[3] Howev- er, a material with a high surface area or free volume alone is not necessarily a good candidate for hydrogen storage. Abstract: A highly porous member of isoreticular MFU-4-type frameworks, [Zn5Cl4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(BTDD)3] (MFU-4lACHTUNGTRENUNG(arge)) (H2- BTDD=bis(1H-1,2,3-triazoloACHTUNGTRENUNG[4,5-b],- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[4’,5’-i])dibenzoACHTUNGTRENUNG[1,4]dioxin), has been synthesized using ZnCl2 and H2-BTDD in N,N-dimethylformamide as a sol- vent. MFU-4l represents the first ex- ample of MFU-4-type frameworks fea- turing large pore apertures of 9.1 . Here, MFU-4l serves as a reference compound to evaluate the origin of unique and specific gas-sorption prop- erties of MFU-4, reported previously. The latter framework features narrow- sized pores of 2.5  that allow passage of sufficiently small molecules only (such as hydrogen or water), whereas molecules with larger kinetic diameters (e.g., argon or nitrogen) are excluded from uptake. The crystal structure of MFU-4l has been solved ab initio by direct methods from 3D electron-dif- fraction data acquired from a single nanosized crystal through automated electron diffraction tomography (ADT) in combination with electron- beam precession. Independently, it has been solved using powder X-ray dif- fraction. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and variable-temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) experi- ments carried out on MFU-4l indicate that it is stable up to 5008C (N2 atmos- phere) and up to 3508C in air. The framework adsorbs 4 wt% hydrogen at 20 bar and 77 K, which is twice the amount compared to MFU-4. The iso- steric heat of adsorption starts for low surface coverage at 5 kJmol1 and de- creases to 3.5 kJmol1 at higher H2 uptake. In contrast, MFU-4 possesses a nearly constant isosteric heat of ad- sorption of ca. 7 kJmol1 over a wide range of surface coverage. Moreover, MFU-4 exhibits a H2 desorption maxi- mum at 71 K, which is the highest tem- perature ever measured for hydrogen physisorbed on metal–organic frame- works (MOFs).

Chem. Eur. J. 2011, 17, 1837 – 1848  2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1837 FULL PAPER Relatively high adsorption enthalpy is required for success- ful application. Calculations[4] show that the adsorption en- thalpy of 15 kJmol1 would be optimal for a reversible ad- sorption–desorption cycle at room temperature. However, due to very weak van der Waals interactions of H2 mole- cules, the heat of hydrogen physisorption typically ranges from 4 to 7 kJmol1. Metal–organic frameworks with unsa- turated metal sites can reach an adsorption enthalpy of over 10 kJmol1.[5] The pore-size distribution of a MOF strongly influences the heat of adsorption. Thus, frameworks with smaller pore sizes have higher heat of adsorption due to a stronger interaction between adsorbed hydrogen molecules and cavities.[6] The desorption temperature of hydrogen like- wise increases with decreasing pore size.[7] Monte Carlo cal- culations have been used to show that pores with a diameter of 7  should be optimal for hydrogen adsorption.[8] Howev- er, these calculations did not consider the important gating effects of very small apertures or narrow channels intercon- necting the internal voids of the storage material. Finally, the stability of a metal–organic framework plays a very im- portant role for its potential use as a hydrogen-storage ma- terial as well as for other applications. Thus, the perfor- mance of MOF-5 in hydrogen adsorption depends strongly on the preparation and handling conditions since this frame- work is not stable under ambient conditions owing to its sensitivity towards hydrolytic decomposition.[3] In a general sense, the success of inventing functional MOFs will rely on a systematic development of suitable sec- ondary building units (SBUs) from which a structurally and functionally diverse class of novel materials might evol- ve.[9a,b] Herein we present a unique “solid-state construction kit” that is based on novel pentanuclear SBUs, for which the term “Kuratowski-type” SBUs is proposed. We have re- cently developed two major lines of functional MOF com- pounds, termed MFU-1 and MFU-4, respectively. MFU-1 is a pyrazolate-based redox-active analogue of the famous MOF-5[9c] featuring four tetrahedrally coordinated CoII cen- ters that are connected by a central m4-bridging oxide anion (Figure 1, left). This compound shows enhanced stability against hydrolytic and oxidative decomposition and it can be employed as catalyst in a range of radical-centered oxida- tion reactions.[10] Since the particular SBU of MFU-1 seems to be limited to the presence of a {Co4O} core, we have de- veloped a modular MOF family (MFU-4),[11] which is based on Kuratowski-type pentanuclear SBUs of the general for- mula [MIIZn4X4(L6)] (Figure 1, right). These feature a cen- tral metal ion coordinated to six triazolate ligands (L) that span a Cartesian system and can either be assembled into discrete coordination compounds[12] or into porous cubic frameworks.[11] The central metal ion in the octahedral coor- dination environment can be varied[12] giving the opportuni- ty of potentially obtaining redox-active SBUs that are also Lewis acidic, with chemical properties that can be fine- tuned by selecting appropriate metal ions. Changing the Zn2+ ions in tetrahedral positions to other transition-metal ions could improve hydrogen-sorption properties.[5] The graph theoretical analysis proves that [MIIZn4X4(L6)] units contain the nonplanar K3,3 graph. According to a theo- rem of C. Kuratowski,[13] a finite graph is planar only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K3,3 (a complete bipar- tite graph on six vertices, three of which connect to each of the other three). As can be seen in Figure 2, the molecular graph of [MIIZn4X4(L6)] units in fact contains a subgraph of K3,3. Accordingly, there is no way to draw [MIIZn4X4(L6)] as a planar graph and thus we propose a pseudoperspective skeletal formula as derived in Figure 3 to represent Kura- towski-type coordination compounds in this paper and in the future. The first triazolate-based MOF featuring Kuratowsky- type secondary building units, MFU-4, was constructed from benzobistriazolate linkers and {Zn5Cl4}6+ cores featuring a very high thermal and hydrolytic stability. Due to its small pore apertures (2.5 ) it is highly selective for the adsorp- tion of atoms or small molecules such as H2 and it can there- fore be applied in molecular sieving applications, some of which are hard to achieve with other kinds of porous mate- rials. However, to separate mixtures of larger molecular ad- sorbates or for catalytic transformations a porous frame- Figure 1. Structural features of SBUs found in MFU-1 and MFU-4. Figure 2.

KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2011, 17, 1837 – 1848 1838 work featuring large pore apertures is required. Herein we describe MFU-4lACHTUNGTRENUNG(arge) constructed from bis(1H-1,2,3- triazoloACHTUNGTRENUNG[4,5-b],ACHTUNGTRENUNG[4’,5’-i])dibenzoACHTUNGTRENUNG[1,4]dioxin linkers (H2-BTDD, 2), which is a novel member of isoreticular MFU-4-type frameworks (Scheme 1). Comparing hydrogen-sorption properties of MFU-4 and MFU-4l featuring small and large pores, respectively, might help to improve present concepts about the influence of pore size on the potential of a porous material for hydrogen storage by means of physisorption. In the following we will demonstrate that small pore apertures are responsible for selective hydrogen adsorption in MFU-4. Its small pore di- ameters result in a higher heat of adsorption due to a stron- ger interaction between adsorbed molecules and the MOF. This desirable property of MFU-4, however, is compromised by a reduced void volume if compared with MFU-4l, which features larger pores and a higher surface area, which allow for uptake of a larger total amount of hydrogen at high pressure. Only a few studies with accurate determination of the isosteric heat of adsorption from isotherms have been reported so far.[6] A powerful tool that can help us to under- stand the mechanism of adsorption and diffusion of hydro- gen in MOFs is thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS).[7] Herein we present hydrogen-adsorption isotherms for MFU-4 and MFU-4l measured over a wide temperature range (77–298 K) as well as TDS studies at low tempera- tures between 20 and 120 K. Results and Discussion Synthesis and characterization: The bis(1H-1,2,3-triazolo- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[4,5-b],ACHTUNGTRENUNG[4’,5’-i])dibenzoACHTUNGTRENUNG[1,4]dioxin (H2-BTDD, 2) ligand was synthesized in three steps starting from dibenzoACHTUNGTRENUNG[1,4]dioxin (see Scheme 2). The nitration of dibenzoACHTUNGTRENUNG[1,4]dioxin de- scribed in the literature[14] gives a very low yield (17%) of the desired product and requires several purification steps. Therefore, we have developed an improved and simple pro- cedure that allowed us to obtain 2,3,7,8-tetranitrodibenzo- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[1,4]dioxin (3) in good yield. The reduction of the nitro com- pound was carried out according to the literature proce- dure.[15] MFU-4l can be synthesized in high yield using solvother- mal or microwave methods and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent (see Scheme 3). Different ratios of ZnCl2/2 (from 2:1 to 40:1) can be used for MOF synthesis. However, a large excess amount of zinc chloride is preferable to avoid the formation of amorphous byproducts that have been observed when using low metal/ ligand ratios. The ratio of 20:1 was found to be optimal. MFU-4l was obtained as a microcrystalline powder with typ- ical crystal sizes ranging from 1 to 5 mm (Figure 4). Crystals of this size are not suitable for single-crystal X-ray structure analysis, thus powder X-ray diffraction and single-crystal electron diffraction have been used for structural characteri- zation. The use of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent offers the advantage of a higher solubility of the linker. Also, some larger crystals, up to 40 mm, could be obtained in NMP under solvothermal conditions. However, the yield was very poor and the product contains a considerable amount of amorphous impurities. Structure solution by electron diffraction: Automated elec- tron diffraction tomography (ADT)[16–18] is a new technique in which the reciprocal space is sampled by tilting a nano- sized single crystal in small steps over the full tilt range ac- Scheme 1.

We used nanobeam electron diffraction to create a low-dose, small, semiparallel electron beam and scanning TEM to image and track the crystal; this technique is particularly suitable for beam-sensitive materials that are normally not accessible by conventional electron-diffraction techniques.[19] After recon- struction of the 3D reciprocal space, cell parameter determi- nation with a maximum error of 5% is possible. The intensi- ties that can be observed after indexing are already quasi- kinematical and cover most of the symmetrically independ- ent reciprocal space. ADT can be combined with precession electron diffraction (PED), thus integrating the space be- tween the tilts to enhance intensity quality further. Based on ADT data sets, the full structure can be found ab initio by direct methods in a pure kinematical approach. This tech- nique was able to solve complex nanoporous structures such as charoite.[20]A cubic face-centered cell (a=32.0(4) ) was automatically determined. No further extinction was detect- ed in the reconstructed three-dimensional reciprocal space (Figure 5). All independent reflections up to a resolution of 1.3  were sampled and integrated. Intensities collected in such a way were quasi-kinematical because they were inte- grated from nonoriented diffraction patterns. The amount and quality of the data obtained by ADT is remarkably su- perior to any previous electron-diffraction experiment per- formed on MOFs, for which cell parameters were deter- mined by single-oriented projections.[21] Ab initio structure solution delivered the complete structure directly except for one carbon atom. The structure was refined by imposing a rigid benzene ring and soft bond restraints. The final residu- al R value was 32.1%, which is in an acceptable range for electron-diffraction data. Crystal structure description: The crystal structure of MFU- 4l has been independently solved ab initio from powder X- ray diffraction data by direct methods. Both structure solu- tions—from powder X-ray and ADT diffraction data, re- spectively—deliver almost identical structures, which show small differences in bond lengths only. The maximum devia- tion in atom positions from the ADT solution is 0.2 . The crystal structure of MFU-4l is similar to that of MFU-4 (Figure 6) in that it possesses a cubic six-connected net. This can be described as follows: the nodes (vertices) are repre- sented by cationic pentanuclear {Zn5Cl4}6+ clusters and the links (edges) of the net are represented by finite rods of BTDD2 anions. There are two types of Zn ions: first, a tet- rahedrally coordinated zinc atom (Zn1) with 3m site sym- metry is surrounded by three N atoms from BTDD ligands (forming the base of the tetrahedron) and one Cl atom (con- stituting the apex of the tetrahedron); second, an octahe- drally coordinated zinc atom (Zn2), with 4¯3m site symmetry surrounded by six N atoms from six hexadentate-coordinat- ed BTDD ligands. All BTDD ligands are twisted around their coordinative bonds to the central Zn2 ions. In the solu- tion from the powder X-ray diffraction data, the distances ZnN for a tetrahedrally coordinated Zn atom are smaller (2.010(5) ) than those between octahedrally coordinated Zn atoms and nitrogen donors (2.0414(9) ). In the ADT solution, the distances ZnN for a tetrahedrally coordinated Zn atom are 2.09(3)  and for a octahedrally coordinated Zn atom are 2.12(4) , respectively. These values are in good agreement with other Zn–triazolate complexes (1.98– 2.05  for tetrahedral coordination and 2.14–2.22  for oc- tahedral coordination).[11] According to the results obtained by using the PLATON/ SQUEEZE[22] program, the total potentially accessible void volume is 23563.2 3, which is 78.7% of the unit-cell volume. Analogously to MFU-4, the framework of MFU-4l has two different types of cavities (the smaller and the larger ones are referred to as A and B cells, respectively) arranged in an alternating fashion (Figure 6). The A cells are repre- Figure 5. Projections of three-dimensional reconstructed reciprocal space by ADT data: a) [111] projection; b) [001] projection. Figure 6.

Taking the van der Waals radii of Cl atoms (1.75 ) into account, imaginary spheres with a diameter of 11.97  could fit into the A cells. Each of the larger B cells, on the other hand, is surrounded by twelve dioxin rings and an imaginary sphere with a diameter of 18.56  would fit into it, taking the van der Waals radii of the C atoms into account. The aperture between A and B cells would admit the passage of an imaginary sphere with a diameter of 9.13  (taking the van der Waals radii of Cl atoms into ac- count. Large pore apertures in MFU-4l allow the adsorption and free diffusion of larger molecules. Table 1 shows selected structural parameters of MFU-4 and MFU-4l for compari- son. Thermal analyses: Due to a larger pore size, MFU-4l loses solvent molecules much easier then MFU-4. Thus, MFU-4l heated in a vacuum at 1808C contains no solvent as ob- served by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and shows no weight loss up to 5008C (Figure 7). In contrast, MFU-4 must be heated at 2508C under vacuum to remove DMF mole- cules, which cannot pass through small apertures easily. By using more accurate TGA/MS measurements on the sample stored in air, traces of adsorbed molecules were de- tected (Figure 8). Weight loss below 2008C corresponds to water (m/z 18). The second peak with m/z 44 observed in the temperature range between 200 and 3008C corresponds to CO2, which was also identified by TGA/IR spectroscopy. The third peak is DMF (m/z 73 for the molecular ion and m/z 44 for (CH3)2N+). The presence of DMF was further confirmed by using a thermodesorption GC-MS trace of volatile products formed after heating MFU-4l at 2608C. Variable-temperature X-ray powder diffraction (VTXRPD) studies (Figure 9a) showed that MFU-4l is stable up to 3508C in air, which is similar to the stability of MFU-4. Small differences in the intensities of the reflections are observed at higher temperatures due to the removal of residual solvent molecules. At 4008C, zinc oxide (PDF no. 36-1451) appears as a new crystal phase that predominates Table 1. Selected structural features of MFU-4 and MFU-4l.

Under a nitrogen atmosphere it is stable even up to 5008C (Figure 9b), which is in agreement with TGA meas- urements. Physisorption results: MFU-4l exhibits permanent porosity, which was confirmed by argon gas sorption. Prior to mea- surement, the sample was suspended multiple times in di- chloromethane, which led to solvent exchange of less-vola- tile DMF molecules. The sorption isotherm of MFU-4l ob- tained with Ar gas reveals a type-I sorption behavior, which is characteristic of microporous solids (Figure 10). The pore volume obtained from the sorption isotherm at P/P0=0.9 is 1.26 cm3g1 (1.15 cm3g1 pore volume and 1.93 nm pore di- ameter determined by the Dubinin–Radushkevich equa- tion),[23] which is close to the value expected from the crys- tallographic data (1.42 cm3g1 for the solvent-free crystal and 1.86 nm pore diameter). The adsorption data was fitted to the BET equation to give a surface area of 2750 m2g1 for MFU-4l,[24] which is close to the theoretical values of the specific surface area of 2987 m2g1 as derived from the crys- tal structure by a Monte Carlo integration technique (in which a probe molecule, here argon, is “rolled” over the sur- face).[24] Experimental values of MFU-4 and MFU-4l are compared in Table 2. To evaluate the pore-size distribution of MFU-4l, the argon-sorption isotherms sampled at 77 K were analyzed using nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT)[25] imple- menting a carbon equilibrium transition kernel for argon ad- sorption at 77 K based on a slit-pore model.[26] The distribu- tions calculated by fitting the adsorption data (Figure 11) are indicative of micropores with average aperture diame- ters between 1.1–2.0 nm for MFU-4l. These values are in good agreement with the average pore diameters calculated from crystallographic data (1.2 nm for the pores in the A cell and 1.86 nm for pores in the B cell).[27] However, both the results of the pore geometries derived from NLDFT calculations and the Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR) equation have to be regarded with caution and should not be over-interpreted, since the available slit-pore model in the case of NLDFT is slightly erroneous due to wrong pore geometry assumptions, and DR suffers from the fact that is does not give a realistic description of micropore fill- ing because it is derived from classical, macroscopic theo- ries.[23] Hydrogen adsorption: Excess hydrogen-adsorption iso- therms of MFU-4l up to 20 bar for temperatures between 77 K and room temperature are shown in Figure 12. At 77 K, a typical type-I isotherm is observed but saturation is not reached up to 20 bar. At 20 bar the excess hydrogen uptake is 4 wt% for 77 K and decreases with rising tempera- ture. At room temperature the hydrogen uptake increases linearly with the pressure up to 0.1 wt%. The temperature and pressure dependence of the hydrogen uptake for MFU- 4l is very similar to MOF-5, which shows an uptake of 4.5 wt% at 77 K and also no saturation up to 20 bar.[6] The investigated MOF-5 reference sample had a specific surface area of 2360 m2g1 (nitrogen BET), which is comparable to the surface area of MFU-4l of 2750 m2g1 (argon BET). In Figure 13a the excess hydrogen uptake of MFU-4l and MFU-4 (all isotherms measured for MFU-4 are given in the Figure 10.

MFU-4 stores more hydrogen at pressures below 0.24 MPa, while at higher pres- sures MFU-4l does not reach saturation and stores up to twice as much hydrogen as MFU-4 (4 wt% at 20 bar). The temperature dependence of the maximum hydrogen uptake is different for MFU-4 and MFU-4l. This leads to a shift of the crossover to higher pressures at higher temperatures. For example, at 117 K the crossover is shifted from 0.24 to 1.2 MPa (Figure 13b). At 117 K and 20 bar, MFU-4 stores 1.3 wt% and MFU-4l just slightly more with 1.8 wt%. The difference in the shape of the isotherm is reflected in the heat of adsorption (Figure 14). The isosteric heat of ad- sorption is calculated from a variant of the Clausius–Cla- peyron equation from high pressures (0–2 MPa) isotherms for intermediate surface coverage. For MFU-4 the isosteric heat of adsorption is constant within the experimental un- certainty at 7 kJmol1, which is one of the highest heat of adsorption ever observed over such a wide range of surface coverage for hydrogen physisorption in porous materials.[6] For MFU-4l, the isosteric heat of adsorption at low surface coverage is approximately 5 kJmol1 and strongly decreases with hydrogen uptake. Above 30% surface coverage the heat of adsorption remains constant at 3.5 kJmol1. This dif- ference in the isosteric heat of adsorption is caused by the pore structure, as smaller pores lead to higher overlap of the van der Waals potentials of the wall and therefore higher heat of adsorption.[6] Thermal desorption spectroscopy: Figure 15 shows thermal desorption spectra of hydrogen for MFU-4 and MFU-4l for two different heating rates, 0.1 and 0.01 Ks1 in a tempera- ture range between 20 and 120 K. At higher temperatures no hydrogen was desorbed. The TDS spectra show distinct differences in the temperature profile and in the magnitude of the signal between MFU-4 and MFU-4l. Furthermore, the desorption spectra measured with a slower heating rate are slightly shifted toward lower temperatures, which indi- cates that the hydrogen release is thermally activated. For MFU-4l, the majority of the adsorbed hydrogen molecules were desorbed below 60 K, whereas for MFU-4 the major hydrogen desorption just began at this temperature. The Figure 12.

MFU-4l exhibits two hydrogen-desorption maxima, one broad and large maximum centered at approximately 32 K and a smaller maximum centered at 51 K (for a heating rate of 0.1 Ks1). During cooling under a hydrogen atmosphere a certain amount of gas is liquefied or adsorbed in multilayers giving rise to additional desorption in this low-temperature region.[7,28] For MFU-4l this effect gives rise to the low-tem- perature shoulder and the first large desorption peak for a heating rate of 0.1 and 0.01 Ks1, respectively. Nevertheless, the presence of two distinct desorption maxima for MFU-4l indicates clearly the presence of two hydrogen adsorption sites possessing different heats of adsorption. The larger first desorption peak at about 32 K can be assigned to hydrogen adsorbed in the cavities. The smaller maximum at about 51 K corresponds to stronger binding sites as already indi- cated by the higher heat of adsorption for low surface cover- age in the pressure–capacity–temperature (PCT) measure- ments (Figure 14). In contrast, for MFU-4 one dominant desorption maxi- mum is observed at 71 K and a smaller signal around 30 K. The desorption signal in the low-temperature region may be caused by gas liquefied or adsorbed in multilayers. Most of the hydrogen is desorbing at temperatures above 60 K, which is much higher than that of the other MOFs.[9] Indeed MFU-4 exhibits a desorption maximum with the highest temperature ever measured for physisorbed hydrogen on MOFs. The MFU-4 framework is constructed from smaller and larger cavities, arranged in an alternate fashion.[11] Owing to this structure, hydrogen molecules moving from one larger cavity to another must pass through a smaller cavity. Therefore, the diffusion of the hydrogen molecule through the aperture of the small cavities, with a diameter of approximately 2.52 , is the limiting factor for the de- gassing of hydrogen and gives rise to the high desorption temperature. The total hydrogen uptake was calculated to about 1 wt% for MFU-4, in comparison to 2.5 wt% for MFU-4l. These values are lower than the maximum excess adsorption at high pressures and 77 K, which typically, for MOFs are cor- related to the specific surface area and are independent of the compound.[7,29] The results obtained from TDS are sometimes lower, and especially if the heat of adsorption is low, part of the adsorbed hydrogen will be pumped away during evacuation already at 20 K. The lower value for MFU-4 may be caused by a partial filling of the cavities at 700 mbar and cooling down to 20 K, because the kinetics of the filling is limited by the diffusion through the small window of the smaller cavity. Conclusion We have successfully prepared and characterized a novel member of isoreticular MFU-4-type cubic frameworks, MFU-4l, constructed from BTDD2 dianions and {Zn5Cl4}6+ coordination units. The linker can be easily synthesized in three steps. Compared to solvothermal synthesis, the prepa- ration of MFU-4l by microwave irradiation leads to a large reduction in reaction time. Thermogravimetric and VTXRPD analyses indicate that MFU-4l possesses very high thermal stability (5008C under nitrogen). Large pore apertures of 9.1  allow adsorption and free diffusion of dif- ferent molecules. In contrast, MFU-4, with small pore aper- tures of 2.5 , is highly selective for the adsorption of atoms or small molecules such as He or H2 and it can therefore be applied in molecular sieving applications, some of which are hard to achieve with any other kinds of porous materials. MFU-4l, which has a much higher surface area, generally is able to adsorb more hydrogen than MFU-4. However, at higher temperatures and lower pressures MFU-4 adsorbs more hydrogen than MFU-4l. Moreover, the values of iso- steric heat of adsorption, which is constant over a wide range of surface coverage and of desorption temperature, belong to the highest ever observed for hydrogen physisorp- tion on porous materials. This makes MFU-4 more suitable for hydrogen adsorption than MFU-4l. These observations demonstrate the importance of pore size in designing new materials for hydrogen storage. Figure 16 shows a compari- son of MFU-4 and MFU-4l frameworks. The diffusion path Figure 15.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MFU-4-type frameworks have a huge potential for the development of functional materials for hydrogen storage, gas separation (MFU-4), and possible catalytic applications (MFU-4l). Fur- ther investigations of these frameworks are currently under- way in our laboratories. For structure solution and refine- ment of MFU-4l, three-dimensional electron-diffraction data acquired by using the ADT technique was used suc- cessfully. This is the first ab initio structure solution of an unknown MOF performed with electron-diffraction data. The new ADT method delivers intensity data superior in quality and quantity and has proven to be quick, reliable, and promising for future structural investigations on MOF compounds, in which single crystals of sufficient sizes are notoriously hard to obtain. Experimental Section Materials and general methods: All starting materials were of reagent grade and used as received from the commercial supplier. Fourier trans- form infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the range 4000–400 cm1 on a Bruker IFS FTIR spectrometer. The following indications are used to characterize absorption bands: very strong (vs), strong (s), medium (m), weak (w), shoulder (sh), and broad (br). Ele- mental analyses (C, H, N) were carried out on a Perkin–Elmer 2400 ele- mental analyzer. TGA was performed with a TGA/SDTA851 Mettler Toledo analyzer in the temperature range of 25–11008C under flowing ni- trogen at a heating rate of 10 Kmin1. TGA/MS analysis was carried out using Netsch thermoanalyzer STA 409 C connected to a Balzers QMG mass spectrometer by a Skimmer coupling system in the temperature range of 20–7008C under a N2 flow with a heating rate of 10 Kmin1. Thermodesorption GC–MS analysis was carried out using Perkin–Elmer ATD 400 inlet and a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph coupled with a Fin- nigan Mat ITS40 mass spectrometer. The sample was heated in a glass tube at 2608C for 15 min before measurement. SEM images were record- ed using a Zeiss DSM 962 scanning electron microscope. Argon-gas sorp- tion isotherms were measured with a Quantachrome Autosorb-I ASI-CP- 8 instrument. Prior to measurements, the samples of dichloromethane-ex- changed MFU-4l were heated at 1808C for 24 h under high vacuum to remove the occluded solvent molecules. Argon-sorption experiments were performed at 77.3 K in the range of 5.00105P/P01.00 with Ar. 2,3,7,8-TetranitrodibenzoACHTUNGTRENUNG[1,4]dioxin (3):[14] Fuming nitric acid (24 mL) was added to trifluoroacetic acid anhydride (16 mL) under cooling in an ice/water bath. DibenzoACHTUNGTRENUNG[1,4]dioxin (5 g, 27.2 mmol) was added in small portions to a well-stirred nitration mixture while keeping the temperature below 108C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1.5 h at 60–708C at reflux and then poured into ice/water (400 mL) with stirring. The precipi- tate was removed by filtration, washed well with water, and dried under vacuum over P4O10. Yield: 7.2 g (73%); 1H NMR (400 MHz, Figure 16.

ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Zn5Cl4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(BTDD)3] (MFU-4l) Solvothermal method: H2-BTDD (760 mg, 2.77 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (760 mL) under stirring and heating at 1458C for 30 min. Anhy- drous zinc chloride (7.78 g, 57.2 mmol) was added to a cooled (ca. 508C) solution of linker and the mixture was stirred until the zinc chloride was completely dissolved. The resulting solution was heated with stirring under reflux at 1458C for 18 h and then cooled down to room tempera- ture.

Microwave irradiation method: H2-BTDD (5 mg, 0.0188 mmol) was dis- solved in DMF (5 mL) under stirring and heating at 1458C for 10 min. A 1m solution of anhydrous zinc chloride in DMF (0.4 mL, 0.4 mmol) was added to a cooled (ca. 508C) solution and the mixture was placed in a Pyrex sample tube (10 mL). The tube was sealed and placed in a micro- wave synthesizer (CEM, Discover S). The resulting mixture was heated to 1558C at 300 W, kept under these conditions for 30 min, and then cooled down to room temperature. The precipitate was removed by fil- tration, washed slowly with DMF (5 mL), methanol (5 mL), and dichloro- methane (310 mL), and dried for 24 h at 1808C under vacuum (ca. 0.2 mbar). Yield 5.2 mg (73%) of an almost white microcrystalline powder. This material exhibited the same analytical results as those ob- tained by the solvothermal method and is phase-pure according to XRPD measurement. Crystal structure determination by ADT: ADT[16–18] was performed in a FEI F30 TEM. The sample was deposited as a dry powder on a carbon grid and cooled to 1608C inside the microscope. An area of around 300300 nm, on the edge of a crystal that was 1000600 nm large, was selected for data acquisition. To have a quasi-parallel electron beam of 70 nm in diameter and a low electron dose on the sample, a C2 condens- er aperture of 10 mm was inserted and a high gun lens current and spot size were used (respectively 8 and 8 for that microscope). During the tilt, the crystal position was tracked in STEM microprobe mode and the elec- tron-diffraction patterns were collected every 18 of tilt, with an exposure time of 5 s. Two tilt series were collected with and without precession of the beam.[30] The tilt without precession, sampling a range of 608, was used for cell-parameter determination. The tilt with precession, sampling a range of 668, was used for intensity extraction. All the possible 412 independent reflections up to a resolution of 1.3  were integrated (coverage of 100% of the reciprocal space). The internal Rsym was 28.63%. The isotropic thermal factor determined by a Wilson plot was 0.048 2. Ab initio structure solution was performed by direct methods implemented in SIR2008[31] with a fully kinematic approach (I= F2). The almost complete structure was delivered in one run. Inside the first 10 potentials, 9 corresponded to 9 atoms of the structure and 1 po- tential to a ghost close to a Zn atom. The missing carbon atom (potential 11) was placed in a wrong special position. The structure was refined by SHELXL.[32] The ghost disappeared during the refinement and the missing carbon atom was placed imposing a rigid benzene group. The final refinement, performed with soft restraints on bond lengths, resulted in a final residual R of 32.1%. Crystal structure determination by PXRD: For the PXRD study, a por- tion of the sample was powdered and placed between two sheets of foil. Intensity data were collected using a STOE STADI P powder diffractom- eter with germanium monochromator, operated at 40 kV, 40 mA, Cu target; transmission geometry, fixed divergence slit 1/48. The PXRD pat- tern was taken at room temperature in the 2q range from 2.8 to 708, step size 0.01, and time per step 596.6 s. Variable-temperature X-ray powder diffraction (VTXRPD) measure- ments were performed under air or nitrogen with a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer with a X’Celerator detector operated at 45 kV, 40 mA, with CuKa radiation, fixed divergence slit 1=28, equipped with an Anton Paar HTK 1200N reaction chamber. Measurements were per- formed at a temperature range from 30 to 6008C, by employing 2q ranges from 3.0 to 80.08, step size 0.0338 2q, time 98 s per step. The heat- ing rate was 58Cmin1. The sample was heated before measurement at each temperature for 15 min. Extractions of the peak positions, pattern indexing, and determination of the lattice parameters for MFU-4l were carried out with the PROSZKI package.[33] Independently, the indexing process was performed by the N- TREOR09 program implemented in the EXPO2009 package.[34] Space group determination by probabilistic approach was performed by using EXPO2009. The set of the most probable space groups was found: ex- tinction group F; space groups F23 (196), Fm3¯ (202), F432 (209), F4¯3m (216), Fm3¯m (225). The Fm3¯m (225) space group was chosen for further structure determination procedures. During pattern decomposition the lattice parameters were not refined. The positions of heavy atoms Zn and Cl were found by direct methods; missing light atoms O, C, and N were localized on difference Fourier maps. Hydrogen atoms were placed in idealized position in the SHELXL program.[32] The Rietveld refinement was carried out using the Jana2006 program.[35] Weak geometric restraints on bond lengths were used during the refine- ment process. No preferred orientation has been observed. Experimental details and crystal data for MFU-4l are listed in Table 3. The final Riet- veld refinement plots are presented in Figure 17.

(PCTPro2000, HY-Energy LLC, Setaram Inc.) and are described in detail elsewhere.[6] MFU-4l (115 mg) was evacuated at 1808C overnight prior to the measurements and between each isotherm for 2 h at 508C. Equilibri- um was reached for all pressures below 1 min. For MFU-4, two measure- ments were performed, first at temperatures between 77 and 117 K on a 180 mg sample and later at temperatures between 127 and 177 K on a 216 mg sample. In both experiments the sample was out-gassed overnight prior to the measurement at 250 (first sample) and 1808C (second sample). Between individual measurements of isotherms the sample was out-gassed at temperatures above 508C for more than 1 h. For further analysis, results from both samples were combined. In porous solids hydrogen is mainly adsorbed as a monolayer on inner surfaces. The amount of hydrogen that is in this adsorbed layer is called absolute adsorbed hydrogen.[36] Whereas, the excess adsorption, typically measured by taking into account the skeletal density of the material, rep- resents the amount of hydrogen that is stored in addition to the amount of hydrogen gas that would be present in the pore volume due to exter- nal pressure. The excess adsorption is therefore smaller than the absolute adsorption by the amount of hydrogen gas that would be in the adsorbed layer if no adsorption occurred. Hence the absolute adsorption is calcu- lated from the excess adsorption with the assumption that the adsorbed layer exhibits the density of liquid hydrogen (see the Supporting Infor- mation). The isosteric heat of adsorption is calculated from the absolute adsorbed hydrogen according to a variant of the Clausius–Clapeyron equation.[6] Thermal desorption spectroscopy: The degassing of hydrogen was studied by low-temperature thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) using a spe- cial apparatus described in detail elsewhere.[28] The typical mass used is about 3 mg and the samples were out-gassed at a temperature of 440 K under high vacuum for approximately 10 h prior to the first measurement and between the measurements for at least 1 h. Then the samples were exposed to a hydrogen atmosphere (purity 99.999%) of 700 mbar at room temperature and then cooled down to 20 K. After about 30 min at 20 K, the sample cell was evacuated. Following this, the temperature was increased with a linear heating rate (0.1 and 0.01 Ks1) from 20 to 370 K and the desorbed gases were analyzed by using a quadrupole mass spec- trometer. The total number of desorbed hydrogen atoms was derived for each TDS spectrum, since the spectrometer was previously calibrated with Pd.[28] Acknowledgements Financial Support by the DFG (Priority Program SPP 1362 “Porous Metal-organic Frameworks” and Sonderforschungsbereich 625 “Von ein- zelnen Moleklen zu nanoskopisch strukturierten Materialien”) is grate- fully acknowledged.

Excess hydrogen uptake of MFU-4 measured at temperatures between 77 K and 177 K. For calculation of the isosteric heat of adsorption isotherms between 97 K and 177 K are used. Calculation of absolute adsorption out of excess adsorption For estimating the absolute amount adsorbed the volume of the adsorbed layer (Vads) needs to be known. The density of the adsorbed hydrogen is close to the density of liquid hydrogen (?lq) and therefore the volume of the adsorbed layer is Vads = ?lq•nexcess•MH2 where MH2 is the molar mass of hydrogen. Owing to the external pressure, in the volume of the adsorbed layer would be the amount of gas (ngas) present if there was no adsorption. This can be calculated from the ideal gas equation including a compression factor Z which is calculated from virial expansion of the van der Waals equation: ngas = P•Vads/(Z•R•T) with Z = (1.000547-6.07•10-7T+(0.000912-1.0653•10-6T)•P+(7.373407-0.0901•10-7T)•P2 The absolute amount adsorbed nads is therefore nads = (nexcess+ngas) = nexcess•(1+P•?lq•MH2/(Z•R•T)) Structural parameters of MFU-4l from powder X-Ray diffraction data.
