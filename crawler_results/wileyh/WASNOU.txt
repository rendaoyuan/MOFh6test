Manuscript FULL PAPER Four Novel 3D Copper(II) Coordination Polymers with Different Topologies Jin Yang,[a] Jian-Fang Ma,*[a] Ying-Ying Liu,[a] Shun-Li Li,[a] and Guo-Li Zheng[a] Keywords: Coordination polymers / Copper / Self-assembly / Supramolecular chemistry / Topology A series of CuII coordination polymers with different topolo- gies, namely [CuL(L1)]·2H2O (1), [CuL1.5(L2)]·3H2O (2), [CuL(L3)]·3H2O (3) and [Cu2L2.5(L4)(H2O)]·10H2O (4) [L = 1,1-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole), H2L1 = fumaric acid, H2L2 = 1,1-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid, H2L3 = succinic acid, and H4L4 = pyromellitic acid], are presented. Different poly- meric frameworks are obtained by varying the polycarboxyl- ate anions. These include the threefold interpenetrated dia- mond structure of 1, the rare twofold interpenetrated 4664 Introduction The construction of coordination networks with novel topologies is of particular current interest due to their intri- guing structural diversity.[1] The analysis of network top- ology acts as an important role in the discussion and design of crystal structures. Wells has listed a large number of top- ologies in his classic monographs on networks.[2] Numerous reported fascinating archetypal structures, including dia- mond (66),[3] SrSi2 (103-a),[4] α-ThSi2 (103-b),[5] SiO2 (6482- b),[6] and PtS (4284),[7] have provided experimental examples of these theoretical topologies. All of these extraordinary structures are of fundamental importance in structural de- sign and in the understanding of structure–property corre- lations. In recent years many rational synthetic strategies have been proposed for the design of metal-based coordination supramolecular structures. Application of these strategies allows the assembly of a target compound with novel top- ology.[8] However, general and precise principles for con- trolling the structures of the target products still need to be further classified and improved. An understanding of the factors that govern the assembly process is therefore neces- sary for the development of the synthetic strategies. In mol- ecular self-assembly processes many factors influence the formation of the final architectures, such as the solvent sys- tem, template, central metal, and anion. We are particularly interested in the effects of anions on the architectures of the final complexes.[9] In an attempt to investigate the design and control of the preparation of coordination compounds, [a] Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, People’s Republic of China E-mail: jianfangma@yahoo.com.cn Supporting information for this article is available on the WWW under http://www.eurjic.org or from the author. © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of 1, 2, 3, and 4 exhibit three similar weight-loss stages. (© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2005) the first square-planar four-connected (86) or (8,4) nets have been rationally synthesized by Tong et al. and us.[10] As a continuation of our work, we present here four novel coor- dination polymers with different organic anions, namely [CuL(L1)]·2H2O (1), [CuL1.5(L2)]·3H2O (2), [CuL(L3)]· 3H2O (3), and [Cu2L2.5(L4)(H2O)]·10H2O (4) [L = 1,1- (1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole), H2L1 = fumaric acid, H2L2 = 1,1-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid,[11] H2L3 = succinic acid, and H4L4 = pyromellitic acid; see Scheme 1]. Single-crystal X-ray analyses show that the organic anions play an impor- tant role in directing the final structural motifs of the poly- mers. Scheme 1. Results and Discussion Syntheses and Characterization Complexes 1–4 are insoluble in water and common or- ganic solvents, and crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis cannot be obtained by evaporating an appropriate solution of 1–4. We found that they can be dissolved in a concentrated solution of ammonia by segregating the li- gands from CuII cations owing to the coordinating role of ammonia toward the CuII cation. Their crystals were there- Copper(ii) Coordination Polymers with Different Topologies FULL PAPER fore obtained by an unusual crystallization process by evap- orating an ammoniacal solution of 1–4. The elemental analysis data for the four compounds are in good agreement with the formulae [CuL(L1)]·2H2O (1), [CuL1.5(L2)]·3H2O (2), [CuL(L3)]·3H2O (3), and [Cu2L2.5(L4)(H2O)]·10H2O (4). In order to characterize the compounds 1–4 more fully in terms of thermal stability, we studied them by TGA. Compounds 1–4 were heated from 35 to 750 °C under N2. When crystals of 1–4 were removed from the mother liquor, they lost some of their water mole- cules. TGA was performed with these partially dehydrated samples. As expected, the TGA curves of compounds 1–4 exhibit three similar weight-loss stages. The first weight loss, corresponding to the remaining water molecules, is ob- served over the wide temperature ranges 35–96 °C, 35– 90 °C, 35–92 °C, and 35–89 °C for 1–4, respectively. The second weight loss is 46.2% (calculated 43.6%) for 1 in the range 237–477 °C, 43.4% (calculated 42.2%) for 2 in the range 232–340 °C, 45.9% (calculated 44.8%) for 3 in the range 233–468 °C, and 47.3% (calculated 45.2%) for 4 in the range 227–330 °C, assigned to the release of L mole- cules. Drastic weight losses corresponding to the removal of L1, L2, L3, and L4 were observed from 477 to 530 °C for 1, from 340 to 528 °C for 2, from 468 to 530 °C for 3, and from 400 to 505 °C for 4, respectively. Crystal Structures Selected bond lengths and angles for complexes 1–4 are listed in Table 1. In the crystal structure of 1 there is one unique four-coordinate CuII atom. Each CuII center has a square-planar coordination sphere, with two nitrogen atoms from two L and two oxygen atoms from two L1 ligands (see a in Figure 1), which provide the four-connected nodes resulting in an unsymmetrical adamantane-type 66 net (see b in Figure 1). Water molecules are found in the cage of the adamantane unit and distortions of the unit can arise from the application of different ligands (L and L1).[12] The dis- tance between the CuII centers is determined by the length of L (11.784 Å) or L1 (9.714 Å). Three-fold interpenetration occurs for the 66 nets of 1 to diminish the void volume of the structure. Figure 1 (see c) shows that three independent equivalent networks are interpenetrated within the structure of 1. Each pair of nets (I and II, II and III) display a nor- mal mode of interpenetration.[13] For example, four rods from the node of net II inside the cavity of one adamantane unit of net I penetrate one six-membered window of the adamantane unit of net I. The coordination environment of the CuII atom in 2 is shown in Figure 2 (see a). The copper(ii) center adopts a distorted square pyramidal geometry by coordinating to three nitrogen atoms (N1, N3, and N5) from three L li- gands and two oxygen atoms (O1 and O3A) from two L2 ligands. The N1, N3, N5, and O1 atoms constitute the base of the pyramid, whereas O3A occupies the apical position at a Cu–O3A distance of 2.268(3) Å. The CuII cations in 2 are bridged by L to form 2D (6,3) networks (see b in Figure 2). These 2D (6,3) networks are Eur. J. Inorg.

It is noteworthy that this 4664 net is topologically analogous to the inorganic network B2 in AlB2.[13] Interestingly, as shown in Figure 2 (see d), the identical 4664 networks are twofold interpenetrated to form an interlocked 3D struc- ture. To the best of our knowledge, this structural topology is very rare in coordination polymer chemistry.[14] The structure of 3 contains two crystallographically unique CuII cations, two unique L ligands, and one unique L3 ligand. As shown in part a of Figure 3, each CuII cation is four-coordinate in a square-planar four-connected geom- etry with two nitrogen atoms from two L molecules and two oxygen atoms from two L3 ligands. There exist some unique shortest six- and eight-membered circuits through CuII cations in 3 (see Figures S1–S4 in the Supporting In- formation). Figure 3 (see b) shows the unusual network dis- played by the structure of 3. This net contains two types of nodes (Cu1 and Cu2). For Cu1, each of four sets of cis links is contained in a six-membered ring (circuit II), and each of two sets of trans links is contained in an eight-membered J. Yang, J.-F. Ma, Y.-Y. Liu, S.-L.

KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2005, 2174–2180 2176 be used to construct a six-membered ring (circuits I and II), and the other set of trans links is contained in an eight- membered ring (circuit III). Thus, the Cu2 cation can be described as a CdSO4-like node (Schläfli symbol 658).[15] Structures based solely on rare NbO or CdSO4 have been explored, but networks containing both an NbO node and a CdSO4 node have not previously been reported in coordi- nation polymers.[15] The network of 3 based on Cu1 and Cu2 cations can be symbolized as an Archimedean-type (658)(6482) net with planar four-connected nodes.[2] In the structure of 4, there exist three crystallographically unique CuII cations (Cu1, Cu2, and Cu3), two unique L4 ligands, and three unique L molecules. As shown in Fig- ure 4a, each of the Cu1 and Cu3 cations is four-coordinate in a square-planar geometry with two nitrogen atoms from two L molecules and two oxygen atoms from two L4 anions, while the Cu2 cation center has a distorted square-pyramid coordination sphere defined by one carboxylate oxygen atom, one water molecule, and three nitrogen atoms from three L molecules. The two unique L4 anions display dif- ferent coordination modes: one coordinates to four CuII cations through four carboxylate groups, acting as a tetra- dentate ligand, while the other coordinates to two CuII cat- ions using two para-carboxylate groups and is a bidentate ligand. For complex 4, the benzene ring of the tetradentate L4 anion can be considered as a four-connected node, thus there exist four kinds of planar four-connected nodes in the framework (Cu1, Cu2, Cu3 and the benzene ring of the L4 anion). There exist some unique shortest five-, six-, eight-, and ten-membered circuits through nodes in 4 (see Fig- ures S5–S12 in the Supporting Information). For Cu1, each of four sets of cis links is contained in a six-membered ring (circuit II), while two sets of trans links are contained in a five-membered ring (circuit I) and an eight-membered ring (circuit III), respectively (see Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). Thus, the Cu1 cation has the Schläfli symbol 5648. For Cu2, each of two sets of cis links is contained in a five-membered ring (circuit I), while each of the other two sets of cis links is contained in a six-membered ring (circuit IV); each of two sets of trans links is contained in an eight- membered ring (circuit V and circuit VI; see Figure S14 in the Supporting Information). Thus, the Cu2 cation has the Schläfli symbol 526282. For Cu3, each of four sets of cis links is contained in an eight-membered ring (circuit VI), while two sets of trans links are contained in a six-mem- bered ring (circuit IV) and a 10-membered ring (circuit VII; see Figure S15 in the Supporting Information). Thus, Cu3 has the Schläfli symbol 68410. For the benzene ring of the tetradentate L4 ligand, each of four sets of cis links is con- tained in a five-membered ring (circuit I), while each of two sets of trans links is contained in a six-membered ring (cir- cuits II and VIII; see Figure S16 in the Supporting Infor- mation). Thus, the benzene ring of the tetradentate L4 anion has the Schläfli symbol 5462. The molar ratio of these four kinds of nodes is 1:2:1:1, thus the network of complex 4 can be described as an Archimedean-type net with four kinds of nonequivalent points: (5648)(526282)2(68410)(5462) Copper(ii) Coordination Polymers with Different Topologies FULL PAPER Figure 2.

To the best of our knowledge, complex 4 is the first example of a coordination polymer which dis- plays a (5648)(526282)2(68410)(5462) topology.[1] Role of the Anions in the Self-Assembly Processes From the above descriptions it is clear that the choice of anions is critical in determining the molecular structures of the resultant complexes. In this study, the nature of the anions such as rigidity, flexibility, and the length of the spacer is the underlying reason behind the differences in the structure of this series of copper(ii) complexes:·L1 possesses rigidity due to the presence of a –C=C– spacer between the two carboxylate moieties, whereas L3 possesses flexibility owing to the presence of a –CH2CH2– spacer between the two carboxylate moiety;·L2 is a ferrocene-based ligand, which can freely rotate around the organoferrocene “ball- joint” to meet the requirements of the coordination geome- tries of metal ions in the assembly process. Compared with Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2005, 2174–2180 www.eurjic.org © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2177 L1, L2, and L3, L4 is a planar multi-carboxylate anion, which can adopt various coordination modes. The ratios of Cu:Ln (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4) are determined by the negative charges of the anions. Thus, the ratios of Cu:Ln (n = 1, 2 and 3) are 1:1, and the ratio of Cu:L4 is 2:1. Since the compounds are isolated by evaporation of the corresponding solutions, the Cu:L ratios of 1:1 for 1 and 3, 1:1.5 for 2, and 1:1.25 for 4 may be affected by the solubility of the compounds. The different network topologies of the compounds are related to the Cu:L:Ln ratios (n = 1, 2, 3 and 4). The topological difference between 1 and 3 should result from the structural features of L1 and L3: L3 is more flexible than L1, and due to its flexibility L3 forms a (658)(6482) network with less void volume, and the rigid li- gand L1 forms a 66 network of 1 with large void volume, which is eliminated by the interpenetration. In addition, it should be pointed out that the change of copper(ii) and L compositions used in the preparations of these complexes cannot have an effect on their final structures. Thus, the formation of these different frameworks is due solely to the effects of the organic anions. J. Yang, J.-F. Ma, Y.-Y. Liu, S.-L. Li, G.-L. Zheng FULL PAPER Figure 3.

KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2005, 2174–2180 2178 Conclusions A series of CuII coordination polymers with different topologies has been synthesized due to the effect of the or- ganic anions on the formation of the final frameworks. When L1 was used as the bidentate carboxylate anion, a coordination polymer 1 with a threefold interpenetrated diamond structure was obtained. Coordination polymer 2, containing a CuII atom and L2, displays a rare twofold in- terpenetrated 4664 topology. Two planar, four-connected CuII coordination polymers 3 (with L3) and 4 (with L4) dis- play an interesting Archimedean-type (658)(6482) net con- taining two different types of square-planar nodes and a (5648)(526282)2(68 410)(5462) net containing four different types of square-planar nodes, respectively. Experimental Section Materials and Methods: All reagents and solvents for syntheses were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. A Perkin–Elmer 240 elemental analyzer was used to collect microana- lytical data. TGA was performed on a Perkin–Elmer TG-7 analyzer in nitrogen.

X-ray Crystallography: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for complexes 1–4 were recorded on a Rigaku RAXIS-RAPID image- plate diffractometer using the ω-scan technique with Mo-Kα radia- tion (λ = 0.71073Å). Absorption corrections were applied using the multi-scan technique. All structures were solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97[16] and refined by full-matrix least-squares tech- niques using the SHELXL-97 program.[17] All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic temperature parameters; the hydro- gen atoms of the ligands were refined as rigid groups. Further de- tails of the structural analysis are summarized in Table 2. CCDC-253915 (for 1), -228776 (for 2), -216566 (for 3), and -216568 (for 4) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crys- tallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. Powder X-ray Diffraction Analyses: The powder X-ray diffraction patterns for the polymers 1–4 agree well with those simulated. The diffraction peaks of both experimental and simulated patterns match well in position, thus indicating the phase purity of polymers 1–4. The difference in reflection intensities between the simulated and experimental patterns is due to the different orientation of the crystals in the powder samples.
