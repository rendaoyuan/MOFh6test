MOFs 1 and 2 feature 3D grid- type frameworks with a cds-type topology, which are com- prised of two mutually intersecting M(btec)-based and M(bpym)-based 44-sql layers. MOF 3 consists of an anionic 3D (4,4)-connected pts network that is intersected by cationic hydrogen-bonded 44-sql layers, [(H2O)3Zn(µ-anti-η2-bpym)- Zn(H2O)3]4+, thereby giving rise to a 3D network. The struc- Introduction Logical methodologies for the assembly of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) from selected molecular precursors with defined shape and connectivity have led to significant advances in materials science.[1] Thanks to effective design and synthesis strategies, MOF materials not only have use- ful properties for applications that range from gas storage to drug delivery, but they also show many intriguing topo- logical structures.[2,3] Conceptually, nothing is impossible in the realm of MOF materials, just as a notable dictum goes, “The limits are in our imagination.”[1c] Also inspired by na- ture, the greater the chemical versatility, the more compli- cated the framework.[4] Thus, to produce interesting MOF materials, more creative approaches to their preparation are critical and urgent.[5] The extent of those creative ap- proaches and how achievable their results currently remain a challenge and will require considerable imagination.[4,6] Herein we employ a useful net-to-net intersecting strate- gy[3i] for the assembly of three new MOFs from anionic benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylate (btec), neutral 5,5-bipyr- [a] Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei 106, Taiwan Fax: +886-2-2776-2383 E-mail: fl0403@ntut.edu.tw [b] Institute of Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan [c] Department of Chemistry, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan Supporting information for this article is available on the WWW under http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejic.201000291. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2010, 3750–3755 3750 tural diversities between the two types of MOF architectures can be attributed to the coordination geometry preference of the metal ions (square planar for CuII and NiII and tetrahedral for ZnII). In addition, temperature-controlled X-ray powder diffraction studies reveal that MOF 1 possesses reversible de- sorption/sorption properties upon the removal/uptake of water molecules. The magnetic behavior of 1 was investi- gated in the 2–300 K range. The data indicate the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the two CuII metal centers that are bridged by a pyrimidine ring. imidine (bpym) ligands, and divalent transition-metal ions (CuII, NiII, and ZnII) under mild self-assembly reaction conditions. Both of the btec and bpym ligands, in spite of their simplicity, are versatile organic scaffolds and are suit- able for use as variable linkers.[7–9] In particular, because btec is comparable to bpym in size, their combination will result in the formation of new MOF structures. As shown in Scheme 1, {[M2(btec)(bpym)(H2O)4]·4H2O}n [M = Cu (1), Ni (2)] belongs to a 44-sql-to-44-sql intersecting net- work, in which all of the building blocks serve as four-con- nected square-planar moieties, thereby giving rise to a neu- tral 3D network with a 65.8-cds-type topology.[10,11] The known cds-type MOFs are currently mainly constructed from flexible linear ligands, and their networks tend to be highly distorted.[12] To the best of our knowledge, such a cds-type network that consists of three distinct square nodes is rare.[11–14] [Zn4(btec)2(bpym)(H2O)6]n (3) is a novel case and similar to our earlier reported structure, [Zn4- (btec)2(H2O)6]n, which comprises a 3D (4,4)-connected pts network.[7] Interestingly, MOF 3 features the cationic hy- drogen-bonded 44-sql layer, [(H2O)3Zn(µ-anti-η2-bpym)- Zn(H2O)3]4+, which is connected to the prototypical pts net by means of a unique 3D-to-2D subnet-intersecting system. The diversities between the two types of MOF structures can be attributed to the preference of the coordination geo- metries of the metal ions. Although the btec and bpym li- gands have individually been applied in the MOF sys- tems,[7–9] since their inception, the use of these two compa- rably sized building blocks has not yet been fully explored. Surprisingly, the results of the present studies reveal that Three Net-to-Net Intersecting Metal–Organic Frameworks their combination results in a strong tendency to form a 3D network with a net-to-net intersecting system, which is a very suitable method for the realization of new and intri- guing MOF structures.[3i] Results and Discussion Synthesis Compound 1 was synthesized in high yield (78%) by re- action of copper chloride, K4btec, and bpym in a water/ THF/MeOH diffusion system at room temperature (Scheme 1). The reasons for combining btec, bpym, and CuII together are fourfold: (1) the anionic btec ligand is comparable to the ancillary neutral bpym moiety in both shape and size; (2) both the ligands are able to be coordi- nated in similar distorted square-planar geometries; (3) a neutral framework can be constructed from multiple aro- matic components; (4) all of the moieties tend to act as square building units, thereby leading to the target default nets, such as 44-sql, 64.82-nbo, and 65.8-cds nets.[3a,11] Blue- green crystals of {[Ni2(btec)(bpym)(H2O)4]·4H2O}n (2) and pale-yellow crystals of [Zn4(btec)2(bpym)(H2O)6]n (3) were also easily synthesized under similar reaction conditions using the same molar ratios of reactants, except that NiCl2·2H2O or ZnCl2 were used instead. Scheme 1. Schematic representation of the assembly of compounds 1–3 shows the characteristic 3D frameworks with the distinct net- to-net intersecting system. Structural Analysis Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that compounds 1 and 2 are isomorphous and crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2/c. Therefore, only the structure of 1 is discussed in detail. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of one copper(II) center, one-half of the btec ligand, one- half of the bpym ligand, and two coordinated water mole- cules; the others are disordered water molecules. The CuII center is bound to two oxygen atoms from two different Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2010, 3750–3755 © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 3751 btec ligands, two nitrogen atoms from the two bpym li- gands, and two water oxygen atoms in a slightly distorted octahedral trans,trans,trans-CuN2O2Ow2 coordination ge- ometry (Figure 1). The CuII center can be considered a four-connected square-planar node. The btec ligand coordi- nates to four CuII centers by means of a 1,2,4,5-coordina- tion mode and serves as a four-connecting node with a slightly distorted square-planar geometry. Moreover, the bpym ligand also connects to four CuII centers and adopts a four-connecting node in a more perfect square-planar mode (Figure 1). Figure 1. Coordination environments of the CuII center and the btec and bpym ligands. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity (Cu: green, C: gray, O: red, N: blue). Analysis using the TOPOS software package shows that the network of 1 has a 65.8-cds topology that is similar to the structure of CdSO4.[10] To better appreciate and obtain greater insight into this intriguing MOF, rather than analyz- ing the overall networks through the connectivity of the in- dividual nodes, a new strategy based on the consideration of the structures as combinations of intersected 2D sheets or subnet tectons has recently been proposed by Hill et al.[3i] Using the subnet tecton approach, the structure of 1 can be appropriately depicted. As shown in Figure 2, if only the connections of the CuII centers and the btec ligands are considered, a 2D Cu2(btec)-based sheet appears in the bc plane; similarly, a 2D Cu2(bpym)-based sheet is apparent in the ab plane. Both the Cu2(btec)- and Cu2(bpym)-based sheets adopt a gridlike 44-sql topology by utilizing the or- ganic ligands as four-connected nodes and the CuII centers as linear linkers. Unlike the four-connected nbo and eight-connected bcu nets that are a dual pair, the cds net is self-dual. It would be expected that the cds-type MOFs easily tend to be inter- penetrated.[11b] It is noteworthy that compound 1 is not only noninterpenetrated but also shows a distinct 1D chan- nel. This result may be attributed to the suitable combina- tion of the two square organic scaffolds. This framework can also be regarded as a structure that is constructed from two distinct 44-nets, which are mutually pillared to each other, thus giving rise to a porous and or- dered material.[3h] Unlike the body-centered cubic and α- polonium frameworks, the centers of each parallel 44-net in T.-W.

Compound 3 possesses an entirely different three-dimen- sional polymeric architecture compared with that of com- pounds 1 and 2. The asymmetric unit of 3 consists of crys- tallographically distinct ZnII centers, one btec ligand, one- half of the bpym ligand, and three coordinated water mole- cules. As shown in Figure 3, the tetrahedrally coordinated ZnII center has a ZnO4 core with Zn–OCOO– bond lengths of 1.958(10)–2.46(2) Å. The octahedrally coordinated ZnII center shows a fac-ZnNO2(OH2)3 core: one Nbpym [Zn–N, 2.171(13) Å], two OCOO– atoms [Zn–O, 2.075(10)– 2.109(10) Å] from two btec ligands, as well as three water molecules [Zn–O, 2.069(11)–2.153(11) Å]. The btec ligands exist in two types of µ6 bridging modes: one involves paired monodentate and paired bidentate carboxylate groups in para positions, respectively (Scheme 2, mode B), whereas the other has one pair of ortho-positioned monodentate and one pair of ortho-positioned bidentate carboxylate groups (Scheme 2, mode C). The btec ligands, both modes B and C, serve as elongated square-planar nodes to connect to the www.eurjic.org © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg.

Scheme 2. Coordination modes of the btec ligand in 1 and 2 (A) as well as in 3 (B and C). The bpym ligand is µ-anti-η2-bidentate to bridge two fac- Zn(H2O)3 cores (Scheme 3, mode II), thereby leading to a dinuclear [(H2O)3Zn(µ-anti-η2-bpym)Zn(H2O)3]4+ moiety, which extends to a cationic undulating supramolec- ular 2D sheet with a (4,4)-topology in the ab plane through hydrogen-bonded interactions between the coordinated water molecules and the pyrimidyl groups [O···N 2.749(19) Å] (Figure 3c). Through directed Zn–carboxylate donating bonds [Zn–O 2.075(10)–2.109(10) Å], the cationic sheets intersect with the anionic (4,4)-connected pts net, Scheme 3.

Three Net-to-Net Intersecting Metal–Organic Frameworks which is stabilized by water···carboxylate interactions [O···O 2.721(14)–2.999(16) Å], thereby resulting in a three-dimen- sional network (Figure 3d). The structure of compound 3 is similar to those of MOFs, {A2[Zn(btec)]·8H2O}n (A = K, NH4) and {K2[Co- (btec)]·7H2O}n,[7] prepared using [(H2O)3Zn(µ-anti-η2- bpym)Zn(H2O)3]4+ moieties instead of K+ or NH4+ ions as countercations. All of them exhibited a topological (4,4)- connected pts network that combined both tetrahedral (metal ions) and distorted square-planar (btec ligands) con- nectors. Thermal Stability and Removal of Guests A thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 shows that guest water molecules are readily eliminated from the net- work (calcd. 21.0%; found 20.1%) when the temperature is increased from room temperature to about 70 °C, and a wide plateau then appears up to a temperature of about 250 °C, beyond which the compound decomposes. A pow- der X-ray diffraction (PXRD) study shows that the simu- lated peaks of 1 are in good agreement with those of the as-synthesized sample. When the temperature was main- tained at 110 °C, even 200 °C, the PXRD patterns of the totally dehydrated crystalline samples are different from the original patterns. Moreover, when the dehydrated crystals were exposed to moist air, the original PXRD pattern of 1 was recovered. This indicates that the framework of 1 is bistable and can undergo a reversible crystal-to-crystal structural transformation upon the removal/uptake of water molecules (Figure 4).[3e,15] This phenomenon can be attrib- uted to the unique cds-type framework that can be tuned slightly by changing the sheet-to-sheet intersecting angles.

Magnetic Studies The magnetic susceptibility of 1 was determined as a function of temperature in the range 2–300 K. The plot of χM–1 versus T has a negative intercept, for which data be- Eur. J.

This permitted us to obtain the value for the Weiss con- stant, θ = –36.435 K. The slope of the curve corresponds to a Curie constant of C = 0.3069 emumol–1K, from which a magnetic moment of 1.47 µB per copper atom was calcu- lated after the subtraction of the Pascal diamagnetic contri- bution is 3.7110–4 emumol–1. The magnetic moment of 1 at room temperature for 1 is less than the spin-only value and suggests the presence of antiferromagnetic exchange. In this compound, µeff remains practically constant in the temperature range of 130–300 K and then falls rapidly with a further decrease in temperature (Figure 5), thereby show- ing paramagnetic behavior in the first zone and weak anti- ferromagnetic interactions at lower temperatures. As the temperature is lowered, χ increases until a maximum is reached at approximately 4.5 K, thereby indicating the exis- tence of antiferromagnetic interactions between the CuII centers. Figure 5. Inverse of molar susceptibility () and effective magnetic moment () per copper(II) ion versus temperature curves for 1. In the crystal packing, the tetranuclear moieties [Cu4- (bpym)4/4] are interconnected, and contain two dinuclear [Cu2(pym)] units bridged by two bpym ligands, and, in each dinuclear moiety, two copper(II) centers are bridged by the pyrimidine ring. As a result, in the case of 1, two different coupling constants must be taken into account. However, these two values cannot be determined separately by a fit- ting procedure.[15] Consequently, the tetranuclear moieties can be described magnetically as dimeric. The observed data for 1 were therefore fitted to the modified Bleaney– Bowers equation (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Infor- mation), which is used for copper dimers.[17] The good qual- ity of the fits to the dimer equation showed that the tetra- nuclear moieties can be considered as being composed of two weakly associated pairs of dimers. The fit for the data resulted in a J value of (–13.30.2) cm–1, which is indica- tive of weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the metal centers in 1. The small –J value observed for 1 is as pre- T.-W. Tseng, T.-T. Luo, C.-C. Tsai, J.-Y. Wu, H.-L. Tsai, K.-L. Lu FULL PAPER dicted, given the absence of a Cu–Cu bond or a direct sin- gle-atom bridge between the CuII metal centers.[18] In 1, the only connection between the CuII metal centers is through a five-atom π-conjugated bridge. Conclusion In conclusion, we successfully exploited an effective net- to-net intersecting methodology to prepare three novel metal–organic frameworks from two distinct square-planar building units under mild conditions. Using the subnet tec- tonic approach, these 3D MOFs can be appropriately de- scribed as 44-sql-to-44-sql and 64.82-nbo-to-44-sql net-to-net intersecting networks, respectively. In addition, as a result of the specific intersected network, compound 1 shows a crystal-to-crystal structural transformation upon the re- moval/uptake of water molecules. Magnetic measurements of 1 indicated the presence of weak antiferromagnetic inter- actions between two adjacent CuII centers bridged by the pyrimidine ring. Experimental Section General Remarks: All reagents were purchased commercially and were used as received without further purification. 5,5-Bipyrimid- ine (bpym) was prepared according to literature methods.[9c] TGA was performed under nitrogen with a Perkin–Elmer TGA-7 TG analyzer. Elemental analyses were conducted with a Perkin–Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data were recorded with a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer at 40 kV, 30 mA for Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å), with a step size of 0.02° in θ and a scan speed of 1 s per step size. Variable-temperature dc magnetic susceptibility data were collected for polycrystalline samples of 1 in an applied field of 1.0 T, and in the temperature range 2.0– 300.0 K, which were measured with a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS-7). The samples were embedded in eico- sane wax to prevent any torquing of the polycrystalline in the mag- netic field. Diamagnetic corrections were made with Pascal’s con- stants for all constituent atoms, and the magnetic moments were calculated using the equation µeff = 2.828 (χT)½. Synthesis of {[Cu2(btec)(bpym)(H2O)4]·4H2O}n (1): A solution of CuCl2·6H2O (0.40 mmol) in MeOH (5 mL) was carefully layered on top of a bilayer solution composed of a solution of tetrapotas- sium benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylate (K4btec, 0.10 mmol) and 5,5-bipyrimidine (bpym, 0.10 mmol) in water (5 mL) on the bot- tom and a buffer solvent of THF on the top. It was then allowed to stand at room temperature for a week, whereupon blue prismatic crystals of 1 were formed in 78% yield (53.0 mg, based on btec). C18H24Cu2N4O16 (679.49): calcd.

Synthesis of {[Ni2(btec)(bpym)(H2O)4]·4H2O}n (2): In a tube at am- bient temperature, a solution of NiCl2·2H2O (0.40 mmol) in MeOH (5 mL) was carefully layered on top of a bilayer solution comprised of an aqueous solution (5 mL) that contained tetrapotassium ben- zene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylate (0.10 mmol) and 5,5-bipyrimidine (0.10 mmol) on the bottom and a buffer solvent of THF on the top. Blue-green crystals of 2·7H2O were produced within a 7-day period; yield 32% (21.4 mg, based on btec).

Pale-yellow crystals of 3 were produced within a 7-day period; yield 68% (35.0 mg, based on btec). X-ray Crystallographic Studies: A suitable single crystal (0.280.250.20 mm3) of 1 was mounted on the tip of a glass fiber and placed onto the goniometer head for indexing and inten- sity data collection with a Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Ab- sorption correction was applied by SADABS. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined against F2 by the full-matrix least-squares technique, using the WINGX,[19] PLATON,[20] and SHELX[21] software packages. All non-hydrogen atoms were re- fined with anisotropic displacement parameters. The hydrogen atoms of the aromatic rings were calculated and refined as riding models. The hydrogen atoms of the coordinated water molecule and the assigned guest water molecules were located from differ- ence Fourier maps. Compounds 2 and 3 were also characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and their crystallographic details are also given in Table 1. Anisotropic thermal factors were assigned to non-hydrogen atoms, except the crystallographically disordered carboxylate group (C14, C14, O7, O7, O8, and O8) in 3. Table 1.
