Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/asia.200700152 A Two-Dimensional Coordination Compound as a Zinc Ion Selective Luminescent Probe for Biological Applications Koushik Dhara,[a] Santanu Karan,[b] Jagnyeswar Ratha,[c] Partha Roy,[a] Goutam Chandra,[d] Mario Manassero,[e] Biswanath Mallik,[b] and Pradyot Banerjee*[a] Introduction There is much current interest in elucidating the role of bi- valent zinc in neurobiology.[1] Although Zn2+ homeostasis is tightly regulated by a number of homologous Zn2+ trans- porter proteins (ZnTs)[2] and metallothioneins,[3] pools of loosely bound or “free” Zn2+ occur in the mossy fiber termi- nals of the hippocampus, the center of learning and memory in the brain.[4] Zinc concentrations of about 0.3 mm are ach- ieved in vesicles in the presynaptic terminals of the cells. It is the second-most-abundant metal ion in the human body: the total concentration in serum is in the micromolar range.[5] Zinc-containing enzymes (e.g., carbonic anhydrase) are well-known and play critical roles in maintaining the key structural features of zinc transcription proteins (e.g., zinc finger proteins).[1b,6] Apart from that, high concentra- tions of free or loosely bound Zn2+ are present in the pan- creas[7] and spermatozoa.[8] A number of biological functions are regulated by labile Zn2+, such as suppression of apopto- sis,[9] contribution to neuronal injury in certain critical states,[10] epilepsy,[11] and induction of the formation of b- amyloids[12] related to the etiology of Alzheimer1s disease. Although many reports describe the significance of chelata- ble Zn2+ in biological systems, its mechanisms of action are less understood[13] than those of other cations, such as Ca2+, Abstract: A 2D coordination com- pound {[Cu2(HL)(N3)]·ClO4}1 (1; H3L=2,6-bis(hydroxyethyliminoethyl)- 4-methyl phenol) was synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction to be a polymer in the crys- talline state. Each [Cu2(HL)(N3)]+ spe- cies is connected to its adjacent unit by a bridging alkoxide oxygen atom of the ligand to form a helical propagation along the crystallographic a axis. The adjacent helical frameworks are con- nected by a ligand alcoholic oxygen atom along the crystallographic b axis to produce pleated 2D sheets. In solu- tion, 1 dissociates into [Cu2(HL)2 ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H3L)]·2H2O (2); the monomer dis- plays high selectivity for Zn2+ and can be used in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) as a zinc ion selective luminescent probe for biological application. The system shows a nearly 19-fold Zn2+-selective chelation-enhanced fluorescence re- sponse in the working buffer. Applica- tion of 2 to cultured living cells (B16F10 mouse melanoma and A375 human melanoma) and rat hippocam- pal slices was also studied by fluores- cence microscopy.

A continued effort to detect chelatable or labile Zn2+ in biological systems is being made.[14] To elucidate the role of Zn2+ in such events, detection methods that exhibit selectivity and sensitivity toward Zn2+ and that are also suitable for use in biological fluids are re- quired.[14,15] Fluorescent zinc chemosensors have been devel- oped for imaging biological Zn2+.[16] These probes include aryl sulfonamide derivatives of 8-aminoquinoline, such as 6- methoxy-(8-p-toluenesulfonamido)quinoline (TSQ),[17] as well as Zinquin,[18] Zinbo-5,[19] the Zinpyr (ZP) family,[20] and the ZnAF molecules.[21] Besides these small-molecule sensors, synthetic peptides can also signal zinc by fluores- cence enhancement.[22] A variety of Zn2+-selective sensor molecules[23] were also reported based on f- or d–f (mixed)- block elements. These are discrete molecules or multidimen- sional porous coordination polymers.[23c,d] To our knowledge, there are no reports of any study of zinc ion selective lumi- nescent sensing property in a 3d-metal-based coordination compound. Herein we report a 2D coordination compound, {[Cu2(HL)(N3)]·ClO4}1 (1; H3L=2,6-bis(hydroxyethylimi- noethyl)-4-methylphenol), that dissociates in water to give [Cu2(HL)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H3L)]·2H2O (2), which acts as a selective lumi- nescent probe for zinc ion. The investigation into the lumi- nescent property in HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piper- ACHTUNGTRENUNGazineethanesulfonic acid) buffer (pH 7.4) showed that the emission intensity of 1 increased significantly (19-fold) upon addition of Zn2+, whereas the introduction of other metal ions caused the intensity to be either unchanged or weakened. These results imply that 1 can be used to monitor or recognize Zn2+ and, therefore, be considered as a selec- tive luminescent probe. By incubating cultured living cells or rat hippocampal slices with 1, both intracellular and free Zn2+ concentration in hippocampal slices can be monitored. Results and Discussion Structure of Complex 1 Complex 1 was structurally characterized by X-ray crystal- lography. The data collection and refinement parameters are given in Table 1. Single-crystal X-ray analysis shows that the infinite 2D coordination framework is generated by the cross-linking of {[Cu2(HL)(N3)]·ClO4}1 (1) chains into a sheet structure connected by the alcoholic oxygen atom (Figure 1). The asymmetric unit contains a dinuclear Cu2+ species [Cu2(HL)(N3)]+, in which the Cu2+ atoms are bridg- ed by the azide ion in an end-on fashion (Figure 2). One of the copper ions (Cu1) shows distorted square-planar geome- try with two oxygen (O1, O2) and one nitrogen atom (N1) of the ligand and N3 of the azide ion. The other copper ion, Cu2, displays distorted square-pyramidal geometry with two nitrogen atoms (N2, N3) of the ligand (HL) and azide ion, respectively, and three oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3); O2 and O3 are from the ligand of the other dinuclear unit. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. The long Cu2 O3 distance is 2.305(2) S. Here each [Cu2(HL)(N3)]+ spe- cies is connected to its adjacent unit by the bridging alkox- ide oxygen atom (O2) of the ligand to form a helical propa- gation along the crystallographic a axis.

Fluorescence Properties and Metal-Ion-Competition Studies The emission spectrum of 1 in 100 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 excited at 385 nm exhibits an emission maximum at 434 nm at room temperature. We measured the emission in- tensities of 1 in the presence of various concentrations of Zn2+ (0–1 mm; Figure 4). The emission intensity increased 19-fold upon addition of 2 equivalents of Zn2+, and the emission maximum underwent a red shift (20 nm) to 454 nm. To understand this phenomenon further, metal-ion- selectivity assays were performed for 1 while keeping the other experimental conditions unchanged (Figure 5). Emis- sion enhancement of 1 (50 mm) was not observed upon addi- tion of 5 equivalents (2.5T104m) of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, or various d-block metal ions M (M=Mn2+, Fe3+, Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Cd2+) except for Cd2+, which induced a Figure 2.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemasianj.org 1093 Zinc Ion Selective Luminescent Probe slight enhancement of the emission intensity. However, Cd2+ is rarely present in biological systems, so this enhancement would not present a difficulty in biological applications. In the presence of a large excess (1 mm) of Na+ together with Zn2+ (33.33 mm), almost no effect on the emission intensity of 1 was observed. Thus, Na+, K+, and so on, which exist at higher concentrations in biological systems, do not affect the luminescence intensity of 1. The emission intensity was weakened or quenched upon the addition of several cations, for example, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+. In the presence of 5 equivalents of Cu2+, Fe3+, or Mn2+ together with Zn2+ (33.33 mm), no effect on the emission intensity of 1 was noted. Additionally, we measured the emission intensities of 1 in the presence of various counteranions of Zn2+. There was no effect of counteranions (Cl, NO3 , CH3COO, SO4 2, and ClO4 ) on the intensities (see Supporting Infor- mation, Figure S1). Thus, Zn2+ can be distinguished from these metal ions. A question hangs over the exact nature of the complex species involved in Zn2+ binding. The diffused reflection spectrum of 1 at 645 nm differs from its electronic spectrum in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and shows a blue shift of about 35 nm (Figure 6). This is quite significant and indicates the modification of the coordination sphere of the metal ion in solution. In water, the ESI mass spectrum shows peaks at m/z=911 and 643 that can be assigned to [Cu2(HL)2 ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H3L)]·2H2O (2) and [Cu2(HL)2]·H2O, respectively (Figure 7). The isotopic distributions for the above molecu- lar species in water obtained experimentally correspond to the simulated patterns. Notably, the species do not contain any azide ions. No indication of the presence of the N3  moiety was obtained from FTIR spectra in solution. This may be due to the formation of the azide salt of copper ion, which was precipitated during the preparation of the solu- tion. The IR spectrum of the freshly precipitated mass indi- cates the presence of azide ion at 2105 cm1. Equation (1) shows the dissociation of 1 into 2 in aqueous solution.

The ESI mass spectrum of the Zn2+ -coordinated complex of 2 reveals the formation of [Cu2Zn2(HL)3(Cl)2] (Figure 8). A Job plot analysis reveals that the maximum emission is obtained at a 2/Zn2+ ratio of 1:2. These data suggest that 2 in solution should form a 1:2 Figure 5.

Further attempts to as- certain that complex 2 is responsible for Zn2+ binding were made by obtaining a further ESI mass spectrum with the ad- dition of Cd2+ in place of Zn2+, as Cd2+ induces a slight en- hancement of the emission intensity. In water, the mass spectrum shows a peak at m/z=648 that can be assigned to {[Cu2Cd2(HL)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2L)(Cl)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)4]·5H2O}2+. The isotopic dis- tributions for the above molecular species obtained experi- mentally (see Supporting Information, Figure S2) corre- spond to the simulated patterns. We also examined the effect of Zn2+ addition on the emission spectrum of the ligand (H3L) itself. Zn2+ does not change the emission in- tensity of the ligand (Figures 9 and S3). This means that the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) operating between the ligand receptor (R) (here O, N atoms of H3L) and the fluorophore (F) is not perturbed during Zn2+ binding with the receptor. But, in case of Zn2+ binding with 2, receptor sites can be simultaneously attached with different metal ions, in which case the PET of 2 is retarded. Thus, the en- hancement of fluorescence is attributed to the disruption of PET communication between the receptor and the fluoro- phore moiety.[24] Another possibility is that the coordination of Zn2+ would impose rigidity and, hence, decrease the non- radiative decay of the excited state. The coordination of 2 to Zn2+ caused a 20-nm Stokes shift of the emission band and an approximately 15-fold increase in fluorescence quantum yield (Ff) (Table 3). The Stokes shift of the fluorescence maximum of 1 is due to an enhanced separation of charge in the electron-donor–acceptor fluorophore 1 on complexation. It is known that the late first-row transition-metal ions have a preference for complexation with N and O donor ligands. However, in the present case, effective binding occurs only with Zn2+, which is reminiscent of the Job plot analysis. To Scheme 1. Zn2+ coordination of 2 at the unused binding site. Figure 8.

The binding constant, K (15%), was evaluated to be 5.0T104m1. We also studied the effect of Zn2+ addition on the fluorescence decay of 1. The fluorescence lifetime (t) of 1 in working buffer was 3.1 ns. In the presence of various concentrations of Zn2+, longer fluorescence lifetimes were detected, thus confirming the inhibition of PET upon Zn2+ binding (Figure 11). The radiative rate constant kr and total nonra- diative rate constant knr of 1 as well as 1 bound to Zn2+ were calculated according to Equation (3)[26] and listed in Table 3. The data suggest that knr was only slightly changed, and the factor that induces fluorescence enhancement is mainly ascribed to the increase in kr. t1 ¼ kr þ knr, kr ¼ Ff=t ð3Þ pH-Dependent Behavior Besides metal-ion selectivity, it is important for many bio- logical applications that the sensor does not respond to changes in pH.[23b] We measured the emission intensity of 1 at various pH values (Figure 12) in the presence and ab- sence of Zn2+ with excitation at 385 nm. There was almost no effect of H+ on the emission spectrum of 1 between pH 5.5 and 9 either in the presence or the absence of Zn2+. Thus, the luminescence emission intensity of 1 is stable at physiological pH. Biological Applications of 1 We examined the application of 1 to cultured living cells (B16F10 mouse melanoma and A375 human melanoma) by fluorescence microscopy (B16F10: Figure 13; A375: Figure 14). As 1 can be excited by light of a relatively long wavelength, this compound is suitable for cellular applica- tions, in contrast to the previously reported Zn2+-selective luminescent sensors.[23c] After incubation with 10 mm of 1 in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), the cells displayed modest intracellular staining, which suggests that 1 can be used in- tracellularly.[23b] Next, we examined whether the difference in affinity is related by fluorescence microscopic imaging of intracellular Zn2+. The intracellular concentration of Zn2+ was controlled with a Zn2+ ionophore, pyrithione (2-mer- captopyridine N-oxide), which brings extracellular Zn2+ into the cytoplasm. We added various concentrations of Zn2+ to Figure 11.

When the extracellu- lar Zn2+ concentration was increased from 50 to 150 mm, the saturation of fluorescence intensity of 1 was not achieved until 150 mm of Zn2+. The fluorescence was measured at 30-s intervals for various concentrations of ZnCl2 (Figures 13a and 14a). The cells became noticeably more fluorescent when 150 mm ZnCl2 and 100 mm pyrithione were added, which facilitated Zn2+ diffusion into the cells. The different response of 1 with various concentrations of added Zn2+ is clearly evident from Figures 13 and 14. Subsequent addition of the cell-permeable metal chelator N,N,N’,N’-tetrakis(2- pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) quenched the emis- sion, which is consistent with intracellular turn-on as a con- sequence of reversible zinc binding.[23b,c] These results sug- gest that 1 can be used to monitor the changes of intracellu- lar Zn2+, and should, therefore, be useful for clarifying the role of Zn2+ in biological processes in which the intracellu- lar concentration of Zn2+ is important, for example, in cell death induced by ischemia.[27] However, it is important to mention here that measurement of cell viability forms the basis for numerous in vitro assays of the response of a cell population to external factors. Thus, for biological applica- tion, 1 should not be cytotoxic at its applied dose and time of incubation. To test its cytotoxicity, we performed an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bro- mide) assay with both B16F10 and A375 cells treated with 10 mm of 1 for up to 12 h. The MTT assay, first described by Mosmann,[28] is based on the ability of the mitochondrial de- hydrogenase enzyme from viable cells to cleave the tetrazo- lium rings of yellow MTT and form dark-blue formazan crystals that are largely impermeable to cell membranes, thus resulting in its accumulation within metabolically active or so-called viable cells. The number of surviving viable cells is thus directly proportional to the level of the forma- zan product created. The resulting intracellular formazan can then be solubilized and quantified by spectrophotomet- ric means. The MTT assay thus measures cell proliferation rate and, conversely, when metabolic events lead to cell death because of cytotoxicity, reduction in cell viability. As shown in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information, 10 mm of 1 did not show significant cytotoxic effects on both B16F10 and A375 cells up to 6 h of its treatment, although there was significant cytotoxicity from 6 h onwards. This therefore sug- Figure 13.

Besides cultured living-cell systems, we applied 1 to rat hippocampal slices. The slices were incubated with 10 mm of 1 for 1 h in ACSF (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) at room temperature. The fluorescence was dense mainly in three re- gions: the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 (CA=cornu ammonis), which were indistinguishable (Figure 15). There- fore, no regional difference in released Zn2+ concentration was observed, probably because of high affinity for Zn2+. This distribution was also detected by other staining meth- ods.[23b] The fluorescence was quenched by incubation of the slices with 200 mm TPEN for 0.5 h. Thus, 1 can be used to detect intracellular free Zn2+ in hippocampal slices. Conclusions We have synthesized a luminescent 2D coordination com- pound based on a 3d-metal ion, {[Cu2(HL)(N3)]·ClO4}1 (1), which displayed high selectivity for Zn2+ and can be used as a zinc ion selective luminescent probe for biological applica- tion. Complex 1 dissociates in solution to produce [Cu2(HL)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H3L)]·2H2O (2), which acts as a metalloligand. The increase in emission in the presence of Zn2+ is account- ed for by Zn2+ coordination of 2 at the unused binding site to form [Cu2Zn2(HL)3(Cl)2]. An approximately 19-fold Zn2+- selective chelation-enhanced fluorescence response in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) was attributed possibly to the dis- ruption of PET communication between the receptor and fluorophore moieties or by structural rigidity through coor- dination with Zn2+. By incubating cultured living cells or rat hippocampal slices with 2, intracellular and free Zn2+ con- centrations in hippocampal slices could be monitored. These results provide an opening into the promising new field of luminescent probes with 3d-metal-based coordination com- pounds for studies on the biological functions of Zn2+. Experimental Section Materials and Physical Methods All reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. PBS buffer was prepared by using deionized and so- nicated triply distilled water. Solvents used for spectroscopic studies were purified and dried by standard procedures before use. FTIR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet MAGNA-IR 750 spectrometer with samples pre- pared as KBr pellets. Elemental analysis was carried out on a 2400 Series-II CHN analyzer (Perkin–Elmer, USA). Luminescence spec- tra were obtained on a Hitachi 4500 luminescence spectrometer. Fluores- cence lifetimes were determined from time-resolved intensity decay with the method of time-correlated single-photon counting by using a picosec- ond diode laser at 370 nm as the light source. ESI mass spectra were re- corded on a Qtof Micro YA263 mass spectrometer. Caution: Perchlorate salts of metal complexes with organic ligands are potentially explosive. Only a small amount of material should be pre- pared and handled with caution. Syntheses H3L: The ligand 2,6-bis(hydroxyethyliminoethyl)-4-methyl phenol was synthesized by following the published procedure.[29] 1: A methanolic solution (20 mL) of CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.30 g, 0.81 mmol) was added slowly to a magnetically stirred methanolic solution (15 mL) of H3L (0.09 g, 0.36 mmol). The mixture was stirred in air for 45 min while NEt3 (0.10 mL, 0.72 mmol) was added, whereby a deep-green solu- tion was formed. An aqueous solution (10 mL) of NaN3 (0.023 g, 0.36 mmol) was added, and the mixture was heated at reflux for 1 h. The solution was then cooled to ambient temperature, filtered, and kept under air. Single crystals of 1 (0.63 g, 75%) for X-ray crystallography were obtained upon slow evaporation of the filtrate at ambient tempera- ture for a few days. FTIR (KBr): 3361 (br), 2100 (vs), 1654 (vs), 1629 (vs), 1560 (vs), 1448 (m), 1330 (m), 1240 (w), 1117 (vs), 623 cm1 (s) (br=broad, w=weak, m=medium, s=strong, vs=very strong); elemen- tal analysis: calcd (%) for C13H16N5O7ClCu2: C 30.21, H 3.12, N 13.54; found: C 30.10, H 3.09, N 13.42. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination Crystal data are summarized in Table 1. The diffraction experiment was carried out on a Bruker SMART CCD area-detector diffractometer at 150 K. No crystal decay was observed, so no time-decay correction was needed. The collected frames were processed with the software SAINT,[30] and an empirical absorption correction was applied (SADABS)[31] to the collected reflections. The calculations were per- formed by using the Personal Structure Determination Package[32] and the physical constants tabulated therein.[33] The structure was solved by direct methods (SHELXS)[34] and refined by full-matrix least squares with all reflections and by minimizing the function SwACHTUNGTRENUNG(Fo 2kFc 2)2 (refine- ment on F2). All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic ther- mal factors. Hydrogen atoms H1–H4 were refined with a fixed isotropic thermal parameter. All the other hydrogen atoms were placed in their ideal positions (CH=0.97 S), with the thermal parameter B at 1.10 times that of the carbon atom to which they are attached, and were not refined. In the final Fourier map, the maximum residual was 1.45(28) eS3 at 1.10 S from N1. CCDC-626266 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

Fluorimetric Analysis Fluorescence spectroscopic studies were performed with a Hitachi 4500 luminescence spectrometer. The slit width was 2.5 nm for both excitation and emission. The photomultiplier voltage was 700 V. Emission quantum yields (F) were estimated by integrating the area under the fluorescence curves with the formula [Eq. (4)]: Fsample ¼ ODstandard  Asample ODsample  Astandard  Fstandard ð4Þ Figure 15. Fluorescence images of 1-loaded rat hippocampal slices.

Banerjee et al. in which A is the area under the emission spectral curve and OD is opti- cal density of the compound at the excitation wavelength.[35] The stan- dard used for the measurement of fluorescence quantum yield was cou- marin 343 (F=0.63 in ethanol).[36] Imaging System The imaging system comprised an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX- 70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), a digital compact camera (Olympus, model C-5060), and an image processor (Camedia Master, Olympus, Japan). The microscope was equipped with a halogen lamp, a mercury burner, an objective lens (T40 (B16F10 and A375) or T5 (hippocampal slice), and an excitation filter (330–385 nm). Preparation of Cells A375 human melanoma and B16F10 mouse melanoma cells procured from the National Center for Cell Science, Pune, India were cultured in Dulbecco1s modified Eagle1s medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL) supple- mented with fetal bovine serum (FBS; 10%, Gibco BRL) and an antibi- otic mixture (1%) containing penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin (PSN; Gibco BRL) at 378C in a humidified incubator with CO2 (5%). For experimental study, cells were grown to 80–90% confluence, harvest- ed with trypsin (0.025%, Gibco BRL) and EDTA (0.52 mm, Gibco BRL) in PBS (Sigma Diagnostics), and plated in a six-well culture plate (NUNC, Roskilde, Germany) at a density of 5T105 cells per mL. The cells were then rinsed with PBS, incubated with PBS containing 1 (10 mm) for 1 h at 378C, washed with PBS thrice, and mounted on a microscope stage. To test the cytotoxicity of 1, an MTT assay was performed by the proce- dure described earlier.[37] Briefly, cells (1T105 per well) grown in a 96- well culture plate (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) for 24 h were treated with DMEM supplemented with FBS (10%) and PSN (1%), both with and without 1 (10 mm), for different time intervals. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with a medium containing MTT (0.5 mgmL1) for a fur- ther 4 h. The intracellular formazan crystals formed were solubilized with acidic isopropanol (0.04n), and the absorbance of the solution was mea- sured at 595 nm by using an ELISA reader (Model: Emax, Molecular Device, USA). Preparation of Rat Hippocampal Slices The whole brains of Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight 200– 250 g) were removed quickly under diethyl ether anesthesia and placed in ice-cold ACSF, which was aerated with O2 (95%)/CO2 (5%). The composition of the ACSF was NaCl (124 mm), KCl (2.5 mm), NaHCO3 (26 mm), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mm), CaCl2 (2.0 mm), MgCl2 (1.0 mm), and glu- cose (10 mm). The hippocampus was isolated, placed on an agar plate, and sliced into 300-mm-thick slices with an oscillating microtome (Elec- tron Microscopy Sciences, Model OTS-4000). The fresh hippocampal slices were incubated in ACSF equilibrated with O2 (95%)/CO2 (5%) for more than 45 min at room temperature, then they were loaded with 1 (10 mm) for 1 h at room temperature. Postincubation with ACSF was car- ried out for 30 min to wash out the extracellular compound (1). A small flow-through chamber, whose base consisted of a thin glass cover slip, was placed on a microscope stage. A loaded slice was then held in place in the chamber by a metal wire ring with a stretched nylon net and con- tinuously perfused (2.5 mLmin1) with equilibrated ACSF at 33–348C. Effect of pH on Luminescence Intensity The following buffers were used: AcOH/AcONa buffer (100 mm, pH 4.0– 5.5), morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (100 mm, pH 5.5–6.5), HEPES buffer (100 mm, pH 7.0–8.0), and N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethane- sulfonic acid (CHES) buffer (100 mm, pH 8.5–9.0). Measurements of Metal-Ion Selectivity Metal ions were added as MnCl2, FeCl3, CrCl3, CoCl2, NiCl2, CuCl2, ZnCl2, CdCl2, NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2. The emission of 1 was mea- sured in HEPES buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) at room temperature (excita- tion 385 nm, emission 454 nm).
