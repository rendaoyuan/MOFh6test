Glatz,[a] Ciana M. Rogers,[a] Lestella D. Bell,[a] and Robert L. LaDuca*[a] Keywords: Antiferromagnetism; Cobalt; Nickel; Coordination polymer; Crystal structure Abstract. Hydrothermal reactions of nickel or cobalt nitrate with the dipyridylamide ligand bis(4-pyridylformyl)piperazine (4-bpfp) and either 5-methoxyisophthalate (H2omeip) or 5-methylisophthalate (H2mip) afforded a series of coordination polymers that were structur- ally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Different syn- thetic conditions afforded the 1D chain phase {[Ni(Homeip)2(H2o- meip)(bpfp)]·2H2O}n (1) or the mutually inclined interpenetrated (4,4) grid system in {[Ni(omeip)(bpfp)(H2O)]·2H2O}n (2). The analogous cobalt phase {[Co(omeip)(bpfp)]·3H2O}n (3) lacks bound water Introduction The synthesis, characterization, and properties analysis of coordination polymers remain very fertile areas of basic re- search. This class of solid state material has substantial merit in diverse applications such as hydrogen storage,[1] molecular separation,[2] CO2 sequestration,[3] catalysis,[4] frequency doubling,[5] drug delivery[6] and more recently as sensors for explosives residues.[7] Except in a few limited systems,[8] ad- vance structure prediction and deliberate tailoring aimed at op- timizing specific properties remains a long-term research goal. Aromatic dicarboxylate ligands, in tandem with neutral dipyr- idyl coligands, are especially effective choices for inducing the self-assembly of divalent metal coordination polymers with diverse topologies and multifunctional properties.[9] Anionic dicarboxylate component coordination polymers provide both the requisite charge balance and a rigid structural backbone. Different possible binding carboxylate modes and varied coor- dination environments, in conjunction with requirements im- posed by dipyridyl ligand donor disposition, can act syner- gistically to induce the divergent structural topologies during self-assembly. By way of example, the 3D primitive cubic de- solvated apohost of {[Zn2(terephthalate)2(bpy)]·H2O·DMF}n (bpy = 4,4-bipyridine) can separate industrially relevant mix- tures of low molecular weight alkanes.[10] * Dr. R.

KGaA, Weinheim 1357 molecules, which enforces a non-interpenetrated (4,4) grid structure based on {Co2(OCO)2} dinuclear clusters. Similar clusters are seen in {[Co(mip)(bpfp)(H2O)2]·3.5H2O}n (4), which manifests a 1D ribbon structural motif. Its nickel congener {[Ni(Hmip)2(bpfp)(H2O)2]· 2H2mip}n (5) also shows a 1D chain motif. A variable temperature magnetic susceptibility study indicates antiferromagnetic coupling within the dimeric units in 3 and 4 concomitant with single ion effects. Additionally, thermal degradation properties of these new materials are described. Another possible means of altering coordination polymer topology is the inclusion of sterically bulky substituents on the aromatic rings of the dicarboxylate components. Yang et al. have reported the series [Zn4(H2O)(ip)4(py)6]n (py = pyridine, ip = isophthalate), {[Zn2(hip)2(py)4]2·(py)}n (hip = 5-hydroxy- isophthalate), and [Zn(tbip)(py)2]n (tbip = 5-tert-butylisoph- thalate) in which increasing steric bulk resulted in a decrease in coordination polymer dimensionality from a 2D (4,4) grid for the parent ip ligand to one-dimensional (1D) double- stranded and single-stranded chains for the bulkier substituted ligands.[11] {[Cu(ip)(bpfp)]·2H2O}n [bpfp = bis(4-pyridylform- yl)piperazine, Scheme 1] has a (4,4) grid structure with an un- usual ABCD stacking pattern, while sterically bulky substitu- ents reduced the coordination polymer dimensionality, with [Cu2(tbip)2(bpfp)(H2O)2]n and {[Cu(omeip)(Homeip)2(bpfp)]· 3H2O}n displaying 1D polymeric ladder and chain motifs, respectively.[12] A more recent case illustrates that substituent inclusion may result in the same dimensionality, but with marked different topologies. {[Cu(ip)(3-pina)]·H2O}n (3-pina = 3-pyridylisonicotinamide) exhibits {Cu2(OCO)2} dimeric units connected into a non-interpenetrated 3D 4-connected 658 cds network. Both [Cu(mip)(3-pina)]n (mip = 5-methylisoph- thalate, Scheme 1) and [Cu(omeip)(3-pina)]n (omeip = 5-meth- oxyisophthalate, Scheme 1) display dimer-based 3D 6-con- nected 41263 pcu networks in contrast.[13] Synthetic conditions during self-assembly of substituted isophthalate coordination polymers can result in dramatically different topologies. {[Ni2(tbip)2(H2O)4(bpfp)]·2H2O}n displays an isostructural 1D ladder structural motif. Employing higher concentrations of reactants afforded {[Ni(tbip)(H2O)2(bpfp)]·2.25H2O}n (4), which manifests a vanishingly rare 658 4T10 4-connected self- Journal of Inorganic and General Chemistry Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie www.zaac.wiley-vch.de ARTICLE penetrated topology markedly distinct from the well known cds net.[14]. Scheme 1. Ligands used in this study. The conformationally flexible bpfp ligand has structure-di- recting advantages over its shorter rigid-rod bpy analog or its related congener bpmp. Different metal-metal distances are possible in bpfp, depending on possible syn, anti, or intermedi- ate twisted conformations. The carbonyl oxygen atoms of the amide groups of bpfp can act as either hydrogen bonding acceptors[15] or donor atoms.[16] We thus sought to extend our previous work in copper coordination polymers with substi- tuted isophthalate and bpfp ligands[14] into divalent cobalt and nickel systems, hoping that the strong preference for octahe- dral arrangement would provide different topologies in the re- sulting materials. In this contribution we report the synthesis, single-crystal structural characterization, and thermal degrada- tion behavior of five cobalt and nickel bpfp coordination polymers with diverse topologies based on omeip or mip ligands: {[Ni(Homeip)2(H2omeip)(bpfp)]·2H2O}n (1), {[Ni(omeip)(bpfp)(H2O)]·2H2O}n (2), {[Co(omeip)(bpfp)]· 3H2O}n (3), {[Co(mip)(bpfp)(H2O)2]·3.5H2O}n (4), and {[Ni(Hmip)2(bpfp)(H2O)2]·2H2mip}n (5). Experimental Section General Considerations: Metal nitrates and isophthalic acids were commercially obtained. The dipyridylamide ligand bis(4-pyridylform- yl)piperazine (bpfp) was prepared by a literature procedure.[17] Water was deionized above 3 MΩ·cm–1 in-house. Elemental analysis was carried out with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS/O Analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on powdered samples with a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One instrument. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed with a TA Instruments Q50 thermal analyzer in flowing nitrogen. Vari- able temperature magnetic susceptibility data for 3 and 4 (2 K to 300 K) were collected with a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID magne- tometer at an applied field of 0.1 T. After each temperature change the sample was kept at the new temperature for five minutes before magnetization measurement to ensure thermal equilibrium. The susceptibility data was corrected for diamagnetism using Pascal’s con- stants, and for the diamagnetism of the sample holder.

X-ray Crystallography: Diffraction data for 1–5 were collected with a Bruker-AXS SMART-CCD X-ray diffractometer using graphite-mo- nochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The data were pro- cessed via SAINT,[18] and subjected to Lorentz effect, polarization ef- fect and absorption corrections using SADABS.[19] The structures were solved by direct methods with SHELXTL[20] using the OLEX2 soft- ware suite.[21] All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and refined iso- tropically with a riding model. The bpfp ligand in 1 was disordered over two sets of positions in a 75:25 ratio. Crystallographic details for 1–5 are given in Table 1. The crystal of 3 diffracted poorly, resulting in a higher than usual Rint value and a lower than expected goodness of fit value. However, all other aspects of the solution and refinement were satisfactory.

Results and Discussion Synthesis and Infrared Spectroscopy Compounds 1–5 were prepared cleanly by hydrothermal re- action of the requisite metal nitrate, either 5-methoxyisoph- thalic acid or 5-methylisophthalic acid, and bpfp with the ad- dition of aqueous base. Infrared spectra were consistent with the structural components as determined by single-crystal X- ray diffraction. Broad, weak bands at 3300–3400 cm–1 signify the O–H bonds in the water molecules of crystallization. Weaker, high energy bands at 3000–3200 cm–1 are assigned to C–H bond stretching modes in all cases. Asymmetric and symmetric C–O stretching modes of the dicarboxylate ligands are marked by strong bands at 1540 cm–1 and 1366 cm–1 (1), 1549 cm–1 and 1369 cm–1 (2), 1542 cm–1 and 1393 cm–1 (3), 1549 cm–1 and 1372 cm–1 (4), and 1536 cm–1 and 1370 cm–1 (5). Sharp, medium intensity bands in the range of 1600 cm–1 to 1200 cm–1 are attributed to the stretching modes of the pyridyl rings of the 4-bpfp ligands. Features corresponding to pyridyl and aryl ring puckering are observed in the region be- tween 800 cm–1 and 600 cm–1. Sharp, moderate intensity bands at 1630 cm–1 (1, 2), 1619 cm–1 (3), 1611 cm–1 (4), and Journal of Inorganic and General Chemistry Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie www.zaac.wiley-vch.de ARTICLE 1620 cm–1 (5) mark the C=O stretching bands within the amide moieties of the bpfp ligands for 1–5, respectively. Protonated carboxylic acid groups in 1 and 5 were indicated by spectral features at 1640 cm–1 and 1635 cm–1, respectively. Structural Description of {[Ni(Homeip)2(H2omeip) (bpfp)]·2H2O}n (1) The asymmetric unit of compound 1 contains a divalent nickel atom, two singly protonated Homeip anionic ligands (Homeip-A, Homeip-B), a ligated doubly protonated H2omeip molecule, a bpfp ligand disordered over two sets of positions, and two water molecules of crystallization. A distorted octahe- dral {NiN2O4} coordination environment exists at nickel, wherein two trans positions are occupied by pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from two bpfp ligands. A chelating carboxylate group from a Homeip-A ligand fills two cis positions. The remaining two cis coordination sites are taken up by single oxygen atom donors from a Homeip-B ligand, and the ligated H2omeip carboxylic acid. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination environment are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information), and a thermal ellipsoid plot is depicted in Fig- ure 1a. Pendant carboxylate groups of the Homeip and H2omeip li- gands do not ligate. The anti conformation bpfp ligands act as dipodal tethers, thereby constructing [Ni(Homeip)2(H2omeip) (bpfp)]n coordination polymer chain motifs (Figure 1b) ar- ranged parallel to the c axis. The through-ligand Ni···Ni span of 15.739 Å matches the c lattice parameter. Within the chain motif, the bound protonated carboxylic acid groups of the H2omeip ligand engage in O–H···O hydrogen bonding do- nation to the deprotonated ligated carboxylate group of the Homeip-B ligands (Table S2, Supporting Information). Neigh- boring chain motifs aggregate by means of mutual O–H···O hydrogen bonding patterns involving the unligated, pendant carboxylic acid groups of the Homeip-B and H2omeip ligands, and by O–H···O hydrogen bonding donation from protonated Homeip-A and Homeip-B carboxylic acid groups to bpfp carb- onyl oxygen atoms (Figure S1). Water molecules of crystallization also assist in aggregation of chain motifs, via hydrogen bonding donation to bound Homeip-B carboxylate oxygen atoms, and bpfp carbonyl oxygen atoms. Pairs of water molecules of crystallization occupy small pockets between Figure 1. (a) Coordination environment in 1. Thermal ellipsoids are drawn at 50% probability.

KGaA, Weinheim 1360 chains, comprising 7.4% of the unit cell volume according to a calculation performed with PLATON.[22] Structural Description of {[Ni(omeip)(bpfp)(H2O)]·2H2O}n (2) The asymmetric unit of compound 2 contains two divalent nickel atoms (Ni1, Ni2), two crystallographically distinct omeip ligands (omeip-A, omeip-B), halves of four crystallo- graphically distinct bpfp ligands (bpfp-A, bpfp-B, bpfp-C, bpfp-D), two aqua ligands, and four water molecules of crystallization. All of the bpfp ligands adopt an anti conforma- tion that imposes a center of symmetry within each piperazinyl ring. Both Ni1 and Ni2 display distorted {NiN2O4} coordina- tion octahedra. The Ni1 atom has a bpfp-A pyridyl nitrogen donor atom and a bpfp-B pyridyl nitrogen donor atom in trans positions, and a chelating carboxylate group from an omeip-A ligand in two other cis positions. The remaining two cis posi- tions are taken up by an aqua ligand and a single carboxylate oxygen atom donor from a second omeip-A ligand. At Ni2, the coordination scheme is extremely similar, but with bpfp-C and bpfp-D pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms, chelating and mono- dentate carboxylate donors from omeip-B ligands, and another aqua ligand. Bond lengths and angles within the crystallo- graphically distinct coordination spheres are listed in Table S3. Thermal ellipsoid plots of the distinct Ni1 and Ni2 coordina- tion environments are shown in Figure 2. The Ni1 atoms are conjoined into [Ni(H2O)(omeip)]n chain motifs by chelating/monodentate omeip-A ligands, that bridge a Ni···Ni distance of 10.137 Å. Similarly, the Ni2 atoms are linked into crystallographically distinct [Ni(H2O)(omeip)]n chains by omeip-B ligands; the Ni···Ni distance is the same. Both of the distinct [Ni(H2O)(omeip)]n chains are arranged parallel to the a axis. The Ni1 atoms are further connected by dipodal bpfp-A and bpfp-B ligands, which span Ni···Ni distances of 16.488 and 16.926 Å, respectively. [Ni(omeip)(bpfp)(H2O)]n (4,4) grid layer motifs are thus formed by the dipyridyldiamide connectors (Figure 3a). Crys- tallographically distinct [Ni(omeip)(bpfp)(H2O)]n layers, with a similar (4,4) topology, are constructed by the pillaring of Ni2-containing [Ni(H2O)(omeip)]n chains by bpfp-C and bpfp- D ligands (Figure 3b). These bridge Ni···Ni distances of 16.736 and 16.692 Å, respectively.

The slightly different Ni···Ni distances, spanned by the bpfp ligands, result in alterations in the dimensions of the grid aper- tures in each distinct layer motif. For the Ni1-based layer, the through-space distances across the two grid types measure 18.71620.693 Å and 16.57421.784 Å. The two types of grid aperture in the Ni2-based layer measure 17.54821.395 Å and 19.38219.676 Å. Parallel sets of Ni1-based layers stack (Figure S2, Supporting Information) along the c axis by means of non-classical C–H···O interactions between the methoxy substitutents of the omeip-A ligands and bpfp-B carbonyl groups (C···O distance = 3.606 Å). In con- trast, Ni2-based layers stack along the b-axis (Figure S3) by means of stronger C–H···O interactions (C···O distance = 3.126 Å) between omeip-B ligands and bpfp-C carbonyl groups. Parallel sets of Ni1-based layers and Ni2-based layers en- gage in 2D + 2D  3D mutually inclined interpenetration at an angle of 76.9°, according to a calculation performed with TOPOS,[23] with bpfp ligands threading through the respective apertures in each layer type (Figure 4). Hydrogen bonding be- tween the aqua ligands in one parallel set of layers and bpfp carbonyl oxygen atoms in the other parallel set of layers serves to provide the supramolecular impetus for the mutually in- clined interpenetration (Table S2).

Journal of Inorganic and General Chemistry Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie www.zaac.wiley-vch.de ARTICLE Structural Description of {[Co(omeip)(bpfp)]·3H2O}n (3) The asymmetric unit of compound 3 contains a divalent co- balt atom, a fully deprotonated omeip ligand, a complete bpfp ligand, and three water molecules of crystallization. In contrast to 2, there are no bound water molecules. The coordination environment at cobalt is a rather distorted {CoN2O4} octahe- dron (Figure 5a), with trans pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms be- longing to two bpfp ligands. Single oxygen donor atoms from two omeip ligands fill two of the remaining coordination sites in a cis manner, whereas the coordination sphere is completed by a chelating carboxylate group from a third omeip ligand. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination environment are listed in Table S4 (Supporting Information). The exotridentate omeip ligands in 3 connect to three cobalt atoms in a μ3-κ4-O,O:O:O binding mode, with anti-syn bridging carboxylate groups forming dinuclear {Co2(OCO)2} units with a Co···Co distance of 4.155 Å. The full span of the omeip ligands conjoin the dinuclear units into [Co2(omeip)2]n ribbon motifs oriented parallel to the b axis (Figure 5b). Paral- lel [Co2(omeip)2]n ribbons are linked into [Co(omeip)(bpfp)]n coordination polymer layers (Figure 5c) by tethering anti con- formation bpfp ligands, which span a Co···Co distance of 16.425 Å. As each {Co2(OCO)2} dinuclear unit is connected to four others, the layer topology can be simplified as a (4,4) grid. This topology stands in marked contrast to that of its bpmp analog [Co(omeip)(bpmp)]n, which possesses similar di- nuclear units and ribbon motifs linked by bpmp tethers into a (3,6) triangular topology.[25] The difference in topology is apparently caused by differences in N···N···N···N torsion angles within the long dipyridyl tethers, in 3 this value is 166.7°, while in [Co(omeip)(bpmp)]n it is 177.7°. It is plausible that the less curled tether conformation in the latter phase promotes connection of each {Co2(OCO)2} dinuclear unit to four others via the dipyridyl ligands, resulting in a 6-connected topology when the omeip linkers are taken into account.

Supramolecular in- teractions between neighboring layers are provided by water molecule trimers that engage in hydrogen bonding donation to omeip carboxylate oxygen atoms and bpfp carbonyl oxygen atoms (Table S2).

Structural Description of {[Co(mip)(bpfp)(H2O)2]·3.5H2O}n (4) The asymmetric unit of compound 4 contains a divalent co- balt atom, a fully deprotonated mip ligand, a complete bpfp ligand, two bound water molecules, and net three and one half water molecules of crystallization. The oxygen atom of one of the unligated water molecules rests on a crystallographic inversion center. As in 3, the coordination environment at co- balt in 4 is a distorted {CoN2O4} octahedron (Figure 6a), with trans pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms belonging to two bpfp li- gands. Aqua ligands fill two cis coordination sites, while the remaining two cis positions are taken up by single carboxylate oxygen donor atoms from two mip ligands. Due to the pres- ence of the aqua ligands in lieu of a chelating carboxylate group, the coordination environment in 4 more closely re- sembles an idealized octahedron than that of 3. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination sphere of 4 are listed in Table S5 (Supporting Information). The mip ligands in 4 bridge two cobalt atoms in an anti-syn bridging mode, forming dinuclear [Co2(H2O)4(mip)2] clusters (Figure 6b) with embedded {Co2(OCO)2} units, featuring a Co···Co distance of 4.691 Å. This distance is over 0.5 Å longer than the corresponding distance within the {Co2(OCO)2} dinu- clear units in 3. One carboxylate terminus of each mip ligand in 4 remains unbound, because the presence of the bound water molecules prevents their ligation.

The [Co2(H2O)4(mip)2] clusters are linked into [Co(mip)(bpfp)(H2O)2]n 1D coordination polymer ribbon (Fig- ure 7a), wherein neighboring {Co2(OCO)2} dinuclear units are bridged by pairs of anti conformation bpfp tethering ligands. The Co···Co through-ligand distance measures 16.474 Å; the ribbon motifs are oriented parallel to [1 1 0]. Adjacent [Co(mip)(bpfp)(H2O)2]n 1D coordination polymer ribbons are organized into supramolecular layers parallel to the ab crystal planes via inter-ribbon hydrogen bonding donation from aqua ligands to bpfp carbonyl oxygen atoms (Figure S5). In turn these supramolecular layers stack along the c direction. Aggre- gation is assisted by bowtie shaped water clusters resembling spiro-joined cyclopropane rings containing seven molecules each (Figure 7b), which engage in hydrogen bonding patterns between unligated mip carboxylate groups in one layer and aqua ligands in another. Metrical parameters for the hydrogen bonding patterns in 4 are listed in Table S2. The bowtie shaped clusters occupy 16.0% of the unit cell volume.

Operation of the in- version center at nickel reveals a {NiO4N2} octahedral coordi- nation arrangement (Figure 8a), with trans aqua ligands, trans Hmip carboxylate oxygen donor atoms, and trans pyridyl ni- trogen donor atoms from two bpfp ligands. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination sphere are listed in Table S6 (Supporting Information). The pronated termini of the Hmip ligands do not bind to nickel, leaving these ligands as simple, pendant, monodentate donor atoms. Adjacent nickel atoms are connected into [Ni(Hmip)2(bpfp)(H2O)2]n coordination polymer chains (Fig- ure 8b) via tethering anti conformation bpfp ligands, which span a Ni···Ni distance of 16.286 Å. The bound water molecules engage in hydrogen bonding donation to unligated oxygen atoms belong to the monodentate Hmip carboxylate groups (Table S2). Neighboring [Ni(Hmip)2(bpfp)(H2O)2]n chains aggregate into supramolecular layers by means of hydrogen bonding donation from aqua ligands in one chain, to bpfp carbonyl oxygen atoms in other chains. In turn these supramolecular layers aggregate into the full crystal structure of 5 through hydrogen bonding patterns imparted by the unlig- ated H2mip carboxylic acid molecules entrained in the inter- lamellar regions (Figure S6). Journal of Inorganic and General Chemistry Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie www.zaac.wiley-vch.de ARTICLE Magnetic Properties of 3 and 4 Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility studies were performed to investigate the magnetic interactions within the syn-anti carboxylate bridged {Co2(OCO)2} dinuclear units in the 2D cobalt omeip derivative 3 and its 1D mip analog 4. For 3, the χmT product of 2.50 cm3·K·mol–1 at 300 K is higher than that expected for a spin-only S = 3/2 ion due to the spin-orbit coupling effect seen for octahedrally coordinated divalent co- balt ions.[26] A decrease in χmT product is evident between 300 K and 100 K, at which point it reaches 2.20 cm3·K·mol–1. Below 100 K the χmT product for 3 decreases more rapidly attaining a value of 1.47 cm3·K·mol–1 at 2 K. The shape of the χmT vs. T plot is attributed to a confluence of antiferromag- netic coupling and the population of Kramers doublet states.[26] The magnetic data were fit to Rueff’s phenomenological ex- pression [Equation (1)],[27] which treats simultaneously any magnetic superexchange (J) and single-ion effects such as zero-field splitting (D). The best fit values (Figure 9) were A = 0.95(1), B = 1.74(1), with C = 2.694(8) giving g = 2.447(3), D = 27.6(8) cm–1, and J = –0.26(2) cm–1 with R = {Σ[(χmT)obs–(χmT)calc]2}1/2 = 1.4610–4. The magnetic data for 4 was treated in a similar manner. The best fit to Equation (1) gave A = 0.88(1), B = 1.48(1), with C = 2.367(7) giving g = 2.293(3), D = 25.7 (7) cm–1, and J = –0.48(2) cm–1 with R = 1.7810–4 (Figure 10). The negative, small values of J corroborate the contention of weak antiferromagnetic cou- pling between the cobalt ions in the {Co2(OCO)2} dimeric units in both 3 and 4. Due to the very long Ni···Ni through- ligand distances in 1, 2, and 5, no magnetic susceptibility stud- ies were carried out on these compounds. χmT = A exp(–D/kT) + B exp(J/kT) (1) where A+ B = C = (5Ng2 β2 / 4k) Figure 9. χmT vs. T plot for 3.

Full ligand combustion occurred above 300 °C. Compound 2 underwent loss of unbound water molecules be- tween 30 and 80 °C (obsd. 5.4% mass loss, calcd. 6.0%). A loss of bound water molecules was observed between 80 and 300 °C (obsd. 2.4%, calcd. 3.0%). Ligand combustion oc- curred above 300 °C. For compound 3 there was a loss of un- bound water molecules between 25 and 100 °C (obsd. 6.4%, calcd. 9.0%). It is likely that some water was lost on long term storage (ca. 90 d). Full ligand combustion occurred above 305 °C. For compound 4 dehydration occurred between 20 and 110 °C (obsd. 9.5%, calcd. 10.0%). The mass was stable to 260 °C and full ligand combustion occurred above this tem- perature. The mass of compound 5 remained stable between 20 and 220 °C. Ejection of unbound H2mip and all ligands occurred above this temperature. TGA traces for 1–5 are shown in Figures S7–S11, respectively (Supporting Infor- mation). Conclusions Varying substituent and synthetic conditions has afforded access to a series of structurally diverse cobalt and nickel 5- substituted isophthalate coordination polymers with anti con- formation bis(4-pyridylformyl)piperazine tethering ligands. A higher concentration of methoxyisophthalate, employed at lower temperatures, afforded a chain phase with protonated omeip ligands serving as pendant ligands at nickel. Meanwhile higher temperature afforded a system of mutually inclined in- terpenetrated layer motifs in which fully deprotonated omeip ligands can serve as tethering linkages. Both of the new cobalt complexes possess antiferromagnetically coupled {Co2(OCO)2} dimeric units. However, the presence of aqua ligands in the methylisophthalate derivative precludes full binding of carboxylate groups, resulting in a reduction in coor- dination polymer topology from 2D layers to 1D ribbons.
