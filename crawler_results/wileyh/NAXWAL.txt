Abstract. Two novel two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymers of stoichiometry [{PhS(CH2)4SPh}Hg2X4]n (X  Cl, 2a; X  Br, 2b) have been prepared by treatment of HgX2 with PhS(CH2)4SPh 1, acting as bridging dithioether ligand. The extended 2D structu- res result from bridging coordination of 1 between two mercury atoms and intermolecular HgX interactions, thus linking the HgX2 units in two dimensions. As established for 2a,b by single- Introduction Although less basic than aliphatic dithioether ligands of the type RS(CH2)nSR (R  Me, i-Pr), several papers deal on the coordination abilities of phenyl-substituted dithioether ligands PhS(CH2)nSPh (n  1-5) towards various soft tran- sition metals [1, 2]. The coordination mode depends in a sensible manner from the number of methylene units in the (CH2)n spacer: Whereas in the case of Pd and Pt for n  1, a η1-bonding mode is encountered, formation of stable six- or seven-membered chelate complexes is preferred for n  2 or 3. Examples for these two coordination modes are trans- [PdCl2(η1-PhSCH2SPh)2], cis-[PtCl2(η1-PhSCH2SPh)2] or cis-[PtCl2(PhS(CH2)2SPh)2] and cis- [PtCl2(PhS(CH2)3SPh)2] [36]. A relationship between li- gand chain length and structure about a PdCl2 fragment has been established by Sanger et al. [7]. Based on IR data, the formation of ligand-bridged palladium complexes of trans-geometry have been proposed for n  4-6. Recently, an X-ray diffraction study on [Pd{PhS(CH2)5SPh}Cl2]n confirmed that 1,5-bis(phenylthio)pentane spans indeed the Pd-centers giving rise to a polymeric chain complex [8]. Bu et al. have demonstrated that complexation of bis(phenyl- thio)methane on AgNO3 leads to a 1D coordination poly- mer [9], crystal engineering with 1,4-bis(phenylthio)butane on Ag(I) salts under varied conditions (varying the solvent, metal-to ligand ratios, and counterions) gave rise to a num- ber of 2D frameworks with fascinating structural motifs * Prof. Dr. M.

Keywords: Coordination Polymers; Mercury; Dithioether comple- xes; Crystal structure [10]. The complexation of HgCl2 by PhS(CH2)nSPh (n  1- 4) in a 1:1 ratio in acetone has been studied by Sanger 20 years ago [11]. The whole series [HgCl2{PhS(CH2)nSPh}] (n  14) has been isolated in form of “soft crystals“; how- ever, apart from correct elemental analyses indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry for all derivatives, no complementary spec- troscopic or crystallographic information were reported. In the context of our interest on the coordination abilities of Si-based dithio- and tetrakis-thioether ligand of the type (PhSCH2)2SiPh2 and Si(CH2SPh)4 on platinum(II) and mercury(II) [1214], we reacted for comparison also HgX2 with the flexible 1,4-bis(phenylthio)butane ligand. We wish to present the crystal structures of the resulting 2D coordi- nation polymers and to comment Sanger’s interpretation of the dithioether adduct [HgCl2{PhS(CH2)4SPh}]. Results and Discussion Synthesis and crystal structure of [{PhS(CH2)4SPh}Hg2Cl4]n (2a) We first reacted HgCl2 with 1 in a 2:1 metal to ligand ratio in refluxing toluene for 15 min according to Scheme 1. The colorless monoclinic crystals isolated with 74 % yield crys- tallized with the space group P21/c. The asymmetric unit contains half a molecule of 2a, which forms the molecular subunit of 2a by inversion through the midpoint located between C8 and C8#. Scheme 1 H. N. Peindy, F. Guyon, M. Knorr, C. Strohmann Fig. 1 View of the monomeric motif of 2a. The hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. The crystal structure determination revealed that the HgCl2dithioether adduct 2a forms a two-dimensional coor- dination polymer, constructed by chloro-bridged HgCl2 units linked by the 1,4-bis(phenylthio)butane ligand. There- fore, the repeating monomeric motif consists formally of [{PhS(CH2)4SPh}Hg2Cl4] units. Figure 1 shows that the ge- ometry around each mercury atom is distorted tetrahedral. The coordination sphere is constituted by a terminal chloro ligand Cl(2), which forms a Cl(2)-Hg-Cl(1) angle of 114.85(9)° with the µ-chloro ligand Cl(1) and an angle of 98.47(7)° with the bridging chloro ligand Cl(1)#. The angle Cl(1)-Hg-Cl(1)# of 88.26(6)° between the two bridging chlorines deviates significantly from the ideal geometry. The Cl(2)-Hg-S and Cl(1)-Hg-S angles amount to 129.87(8) and 111.29(7)°, respectively. The Hg-S bond distance of 2a [2.4780(19) A˚ ] falls in the range of short Hg-S lengths, which vary from 2.40(2) A˚ in HgCl2C4H8S [15], 2.433(4) A˚ in HgCl2SMe{CH2(Ph)CHPhEt} [16], to 2.499(2) A˚ in di- meric HgCl2[{1,3-bis(ethylthio)methyl}benzene] [17, 18]. The bond length of 2.367(2) A˚ between the terminal Cl(2) atom and the Hg center is much shorter than that to the µ-Cl(1) ligand [2.582(2) A˚ ]. All terminal and bridging Hg-Cl bond length of 2a are quite close to those reported for the above mentioned dimeric compound HgCl2·[{1,3- bis(ethylthio)methyl}benzene] [17]. As illustrated in Figure 2, a meander-like infinite ribbon, which runs parallel to the b-axis, results from intermolecular dative bonding [2.785(2) A˚ ] with the µ-Cl(1)# ligand of an adjacent Hg#Cl2 unit. The angle Hg-Cl(1)-Hg# within this meander-motif amounts to 100.67(8)°, the torsion angle Hg-Cl(1)-Hg#- Cl(1)# being 0.585°. The Hg····Hg# separation of 4.134 A˚ along the ribbon excludes any bonding interactions between the two d10 centers, the shortest non-bonding Hg····Hg con- tact between two dithioether-linked ribbons is 7.866 A˚ .

Even after heating a mixture in a 1:1 metal to ligand ratio in toluene, only red HgI2 crystallized from the solution upon cooling. This finding is arguably a consequence of the lower Lewis basicity of the SPh vs. SMe or S-t-Bu groups. However, HgBr2 reacted readily with 0.5 equivalents of 1 to afford colorless crystals of [{PhS(CH2)4SPh}Hg2Br4]n (2b) accord- ing to Scheme 1. A single crystal X-ray diffraction study revealed that 2b is isomorphous (monoclinic, space group P21/c) with 2a. Table 1 and Figure 3 show that substitution of the chloro ligands by two bromo ligands does not affect the most pertinent structural features in a significant man- ner. Again, meander-like Br(1)-Hg-Br(1)#-Hg# ribbons are linked by 1, the torsion angle Hg-Br(1)-Hg#-Br(1)# being now 1.076°. It is interesting to compare the quite short Hg- S bond length of 2b [2.499(3) A˚ ] with the Hg-S bond dis- tances of dimeric [HgBr2{(PhSCH2)2SiPh2}] and 1D-poly- meric [{Si(CH2SPh)4}HgBr2] [13, 14].

At this point in time we cannot state, whether this significant divergence is due to the incorporation of an elec- tropositive Si-Atom or a consequence of the chelating coor- dination mode of the latter two ligand systems. In order to study the influence of the ligand to metal ratio on the molecular architecture, we also treated both HgCl2 and HgBr2 with an equimolar amount of 1 in tolu- ene. Surprisingly, X-ray data and elemental analysis indi- cated only the formation of 2a,b. At first glance, there seems to be a contradiction with Sanger’s elemental analysis (C 36.10; H 3.53 %) obtained for the “soft crystals” of [HgCl2{PhS(CH2)4SPh}], corresponding to a 1:1 metal to ligand ratio [11]. From a molecular weight determination (MWexp 403; MWtheo 546) performed in dibromomethane, the author concluded on a facile dissociation of the dithi- oether complex [HgCl2{PhS(CH2)4SPh}] in solution. In light of our results, we suggest that a “co-crystallisation” of Fig. 4 View in the b direction showing the arrangement of the layers of 2b along the a,c plane. Z. Anorg. Allg.

Conclusion We have shown that regardless of the metal to ligand ratio, both HgCl2 and HgBr2 form upon treatment with 1,4-bi- s(phenylthio)butane extended 2D-networks in the crystal- line state, assembled by repetition of the motif [{PhS(CH2)4SPh}Hg2X4]n. In a joint forthcoming paper, we and Rabinovich’s group will show that in the case of silicon- based thioethers Si(CH2SR)4 (R  Me, Ph), the architec- ture of the resulting HgX2 · L coordination polymers may also depend in sensible manner both (i) from the electronic effect of R and (ii) the HgX2 to ligand ratio. Experimental Part Elemental C, H analyses were performed on a Leco Elemental Analyser CHN 900.  The 1H NMR spectra were recorded in pure CDCl3 at 300.13 MHz on a Bruker Avance 300 instrument. Ligand 1 was prepared as described in the literature [22]. Preparation of [{PhS(CH2)4SPh}Hg2X4]n A mixture of 1 (137 mg, 0.5 mmol) and HgCl2 (272 mg, 1 mmol) was refluxed in toluene for 15 min, then the solution was allowed to reach room temperature. After two days colorless crystals of 2a suitable for X-ray diffraction were formed and collected by fil- tration. (379 mg, 93 % yield). Mp.  158 °C. Anal.

Crystal structure determinations Suitable crystals of 2a and 2b were covered with inert oil (per- fluoropoly-alkylether) and used for X-ray crystal structure determi- nations. Relevant crystallographic details are given in Table 2. Data were collected on a Stoe IPDS diffractometer, the intensities were determined and corrected by the program INTEGRATE in IPDS (Stoe & Cie, 1999). An empirical absorption correction was em- ployed using the FACEIT-program in IPDS (Stoe & Cie, 1999). All structures were solved applying direct and Fourier methods, using SHELXS-90 (G. M. Sheldrick, University of Göttingen 1990) and SHELXL-97 (G. M. Sheldrick, SHELXL97, University of Göttingen 1997). For each structure, the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All of the H-atoms were placed in geometri- cally calculated positions and each was assigned a fixed isotropic displacement parameter based on a riding-model. Refinement of the structures was carried out by full-matrix least-squares methods based on Fo2 using SHELXL-97. The figures were drawn using CrystalMaker for Mac 6.39. H. N. Peindy, F. Guyon, M.
