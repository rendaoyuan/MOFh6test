The respectively yellow and red coordination poly- mers 2 1[(CuCN)2(l-4,4'-bpy)] (1) and 3 1[{CuCN(l-4,4'- bpy)} ´ 2(4,4'-bpy)] (2) (4,4'-bpy = 4,4'-bipyridine) may be prepared by self-assembly of CuCN and 4,4'-bpy at the ap- propriate molar ratio in acetonitrile solution at 100 °C. In 1 infinite CuCN chains are linked by 4,4'-bpy ligands into lamellar polymers which exhibit short Cu ´ ´ ´ C(N) contacts of 2.41(1) AÊ between one of the crystallographically inde- pendent copper atoms and cyanide carbon atoms of a neigh- bouring corrugated sheet. At a molar ratio of CuCN : 4,4'- bpy below 2 : 3, the heteroaromatic ligands also adopt a structure-directing role to afford 3, in which 2 1[(CuCN)2(l- 4,4'-bpy)] sheets are now joined by additional bridging 4,4'- bpy spacer molecules to provide a three-dimensional frame- work, whose nanometer-sized channels (12.76 ´ 13.12 AÊ ) accomodate two noncoordinated 4,4'-bpy guest molecules. A DTA/TGA trace demonstrates that these can be removed in two steps at 150 and 176 °C.

Introduction Much recent effort in the expanding field of inorganic crystal engineering has been directed towards the ra- tional design of microporous coordination polymers. Most approaches to this goal have involved the em- ployment of rigid bidentate heteroaromatic N-donor ligands such as pyrazine (pyz) or 4,4'-bipyridine (4,4'- bpy) to connect Group 9±12 metal ions so as to afford cationic networks, whose connectivities and cavity shapes may also depend on the structure-directing properties of the necessary counter ions [1, 2]. How- ever, although many examples of one- and two-dimen- sional coordination polymers with organoamine spacer molecules are now known [3], surprisingly few reports have appeared of microporous frameworks that can clathrate larger guest molecules with a degree of shape or size specificity [4±12]. This failure can, in part, be ascribed to the characteristic phenomenon of Z. Anorg. Allg.

A number of two-dimensional quadratic 2 1[{M(4,4'- bpy)2}2+] nets with clathration ability have recently been described, for instance in [Cd(4,4'-bpy)2(NO3)2] ´ 2 C6H4Br2 [4], [M(4,4'-bpy)2(H2O)2] (ClO4)2 ´ 2(2,4'- bpy) ´ H2O (M = Cd, Zn) and [Cu(4,4'-bpy)2(H2O)2] (ClO4)4 ´ (4,4'-H2bpy) [9]. Self-interpenetration is pre- vented by the presence of large o-dibromobenzene or bipyridine molecules in the large nanometer-sized [M(4,4'-bpy)]4 squares. In contrast, all previously reported three-dimensional coordination polymers based on 4,4'-bpy spacer ligands exhibit network inter- weaving [3]. This prompted us to look at ways of avoiding this phenomenon by constructing composite phases in which 4,4'-bpy based open nets are joined into microporous frameworks by a second shorter bi- dentate ligand. Our decision to study CuCN-based co- ordination polymers was influenced by our recent characterisation of 3 1[CuCN(2 Mepyz)] (2 Mepyz = 2-methylpyrazine), which contains infinite CuCN chains as a supporting substructure [14]. Results and Discussion Reaction of CuCN with 4,4'-bipyridine at a 2 : 1 molar ratio in acetonitrile at 100 °C leads to formation of the yellow two-dimensional coordination polymer 2 1[(CuCN)2(4,4'-bpy)] (1), whose lamellar structure is depicted in Fig. 1. The yield of 1 can be improved by performing the reaction in the presence KCN as a mineraliser. An analogous connectivity pattern, in which infinite 1 1[CuCN] chains are bridged by biden- tate organoamine ligands, has also been recently re- ported for 2 1[(CuCN)2 (2 Mepyz)] [14]. A substantial pyramidal distortion of the essentially trigonal planar coordination sphere is apparent for Cu(1) and may best be gauged by the deviation of the sum of the bond angles (346.5°) at this copper atom from the ideal value of 360°. This loss of planarity results from close Cu(1) ´ ´ ´ C(20 a) contacts of 2.410(12) AÊ to the cyanide carbon atoms of a neighbouring sheet with the symmetry transformation ±x, 1 ± y, ±z. These inter- actions also lead to remarkably short non-bonded Cu(1) ´ ´ ´ Cu(1 a) distances of 2.492(3) AÊ in 1. Similar though significantly longer Cu ´ ´ ´ C(N) and Cu ´ ´ ´ Cu contacts of 2.490(8) and 2.588(2) AÊ are present in the analogous lamellar polymer 2 1[(CuCN)2 (2 Mepyz)] [14]. In contrast, the Cu(2) atoms of 1 are not in- volved in short intersheet interactions and exhibit a bond angle sum of 359.2° close to the expected value for a trigonal planar coordination sphere. The pro- nounced increase of 12.7° in the angular sum on going from Cu(1) to Cu(2) is accompanied by a concomitant widening of the N(C)±Cu±N(C) interchain angle from 127.3(4) to 140.4(4)°. When viewed from the side along [001] as illu- strated in Fig. 2, it is apparent that the short Cu(1) ´ ´ ´ C(20 a) contacts between neighbouring sheets lead to the adoption of a remarkable corru- gated structure by 2 1[(CuCN)2(4,4'-bpy)] (1). The wave- like appearance of the individual 1 1[CuCN] chains results not only from the wide N(C)±Cu±N(C) angles at both Cu(1) and Cu(2) but also from pronounced deviations from linearity for N(20)±C(20)±Cu(1) [164.0(11)°] and C(20)±N(20)±Cu(2) [169.7(10)°]. In contrast, the second cyanide ligand N(30)±C(30) exhi- bits bond angles of 174.0(11) and 177.3(10)° much clo- ser to the ideal value of 180°. Individual pyridine rings of the bridging 4,4'-bpy ligands are twisted relative to one another at a dihedral angle of 34.6(3)°. Inspection of Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that it should be possible to connect copper atoms of the type Cu(1)/ Cu(1 a) through additional 4,4'-bpy spacer ligands to O. Teichert, W. S. Sheldrick 1510 Z.

Such a microporous network 3 1[CuCN(4,4'-bpy)] can, of course, only be built in the presence of additional structure-directing template molecules, which subsequently fill the potential void space. We, therefore, chose to investigate the reaction of CuCN with 4,4'-bipyridine in the presence of a sig- nificant excess of the heteroaromatic ligand, in the hope that 4,4'-bpy molecules themselves might be of suitable size and shape to allow clathration by the re- Z.

At a CuCN : 4,4'-bpy ratio of 2 : 3 or below only red crystals of 2 were formed instead of the previous yellow 1. The yield of 3 1[{CuCN(4,4'- bpy)} ´ 2(4,4'-bpy)] (2) was subsequently optimised by employing a 1 : 3 stoichiometric ratio of the starting compounds in the accordance with the composition of the resulting product. As depicted in Fig. 3, the 44- membered rings in this three-dimensional coordina- tion polymer provide adequate space to accomodate two crystallographically independent 4,4'-bipyridine guest molecules. The microporous nature of 3 is clearly illustrated in the projections perpendicular to [100] and [001] shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Positional disordering of the nitrogen and carbon atoms is observed for the 1 1[CuCN] chains along [100] and the participating atoms N(40)/C(40) and N(50)/C(50) were therefore refined at common po- sitions with site occupation factors of 0.5. As previously discussed for 1, a wide N(40)±C(50)±Cu(1) interchain angle of 142.1(3)° is once again found within the 1 1[CuCN] substructures of 2. In contrast, the bridging 4,4'-bpy ligands in the latter coordination polymer exhi- bit a much smaller degree of twisting (2.2, 4.6°) at their central C±C bond, presumably so as to enable the par- allel stacking of neighbouring heteroaromatic mole- cules. Interplanar angles respectively, 3.3 and 40.3° are observed for the guest 4,4'-bipyridines. A TG/DTA trace of 2 performed at 10 °C ´ min±1 re- veals two discrete endothermic peaks at 150 and 176 °C, corresponding to the expected mass percent for the two guest 4,4'-bpy molecules (obs. 54%, calc. 55%). The resulting sample then loses one half of the 4,4'-bipyridine ligands at 240 °C to afford a solid of the nominal composition [(CuCN)2(4,4'-bpy)]. All co- ordinated 4,4'-bpy is finally lost as the temperature reaches 316 °C. On heating 2 for a period of 1 h in vacuum it is also possible to remove not only the two guest 4,4'-bipyridine molecules but also the bridging ligands between 2 1[(CuCN)2(4,4'-bpy)] sheets. The powder diffraction diagram of the resulting crystalline solid is closely similar to that of the lamellar coordina- tion polymer 1. Our present study provides to our knowledge the first example of a microporous CuCN based 3D framework with clathration potential, and adds at the same time a strikingly simple connectivity pattern to other recently reported networks with aliphatic [15] and aromatic diamines [14, 16±18]. Work is currently in progress to establish whether the 4,4'-bpy guests within the nanometer-sized channels of 2 can be re- placed by other suitable aromatic molecules.

Syntheses of 1 and 2 were performed in sealed glass tubes. 2 1[(CuCN)2(l-C10H8N2)] (1) (C10H8N2 = 4,4'-bpy) 89.6 mg CuCN (1 mmol), 32.6 mg KCN (0.5 mmol) and 78.1 mg 4,4'-bpy (0.5 mmol), were heated in a mixture of 2.5 ml acetonitrile with 0.1 ml H2O to 100 °C for 48 h. Slow cooling of the solution to room temperature over 80 h led to the growth of yellow crystals of 1 in 75% yield (125 mg). C12H8Cu2N4, M = 335.3; C 43.0 (found 43.1); H 2.4 (2.5); N 16.7 (16.9); Cu 37.1 (37.9)%. 3 1[{CuCN(l-C10H8N2)} ´ 2 C10H8N2] (2) 44.8 mg CuCN (0.5 mmol) and 234.3 mg 4,4'-bpy (1.5 mmol) were heated together in 2.5 ml CH3CN at 100 °C for 48 h. Slow cooling to room temperature afforded red crystals of 2 in 81% yield (226 mg). C31H24CuN7, M = 558.1; C 66.7 (found 66.5); H 4.3 (4.1); N 17.6 (17.5); Cu 11.1 (11.4)%. X-ray structural analyses of 1 and 2 Crystal and refinement data for compounds 1 and 2 are listed in Table 1. Unit cell constants were obtained from least-squares fits to the settings of 25 reflections centered on a Siemens P4 diffractometer. Three selected reflections were monitored at regular intervals for each of the compounds during the course of data collection; significant deviations in intensity were not observed. Semi-empirical absorption cor- rections were performed on the basis of w scans for 9 chosen reflections with high v values. Following structure solution with SHELXS 86, positional parameters and temperature factors were refined against F2 o with SHELXL 93 [19, 20]. Anisotropic displacement parameters were assigned to all Cu, N and C atoms; hydrogen atoms were included at calcu- lated sites with U values equal to 1.2 times the value of the equivalent isotropic temperature factor of the parent carbon atom. The bridging cyanide ligands N40/C40 and N50/C50 in 2 are disordered about crystallographic inversion centres at 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and 0.5, 0.0, 0.0. The relatively high value of R1 (but not wR2) for 2 results from the presence of a degree of (presumably) dynamic positional disorder for the guest 4,4'- bpy molecules, as reflected in the relatively high equivalent isotropic temperature factors Ueq in the range 82±187 (AÊ 2 ´ 103) for the nitrogen and adjacent carbon atoms. At- tempts to model this disorder remained unsuccessful. References [1] B. F. Hoskins, R. Robson, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990, 112, 1546. [2] R. Robson, B. F. Abrahams, S. R. Batten, R. W. Grable, B. F.
