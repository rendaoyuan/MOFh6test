Manuscript Porous Materials DOI: 10.1002/anie.200700537 Mesoporous Metal–Organic Framework with Rare etb Topology for Hydrogen Storage and Dye Assembly** Qian-Rong Fang, Guang-Shan Zhu,* Zhao Jin, Yan-Yan Ji, Jun-Wei Ye, Ming Xue, Hua Yang, Yue Wang, and Shi-Lun Qiu* Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention owing to their enormous variety of interesting molecular topologies and wide potential applications as functional materials.[1] Over the past decade, discrete clus- tered metal carboxylate secondary building units (SBUs) have been constructed to produce a new generation of highly porous MOFs.[2,3] Recently, infinite rod-shaped metal carbox- ylate SBUs have provided effective routes to obtain novel MOFs without interpenetration because of the intrinsic packing arrangement of the rods in the crystal structure.[4,5] As a typical example of an infinite rod-shaped metal carboxylate SBU, Riou, F-rey, and co-workers synthesized MIL-47, the structure of which consists of rigid organic linkers that connect chains of corner-sharing transition-metal octa- hedra.[4a] Furthermore, Yaghi, O3Keeffe, and co-workers have systematically studied such rod-shaped metal carboxylate SBUs and reported the preparation, characterization, and crystal structures of 14 new MOFs with 12 different structure types; they also demonstrated how their structures are related to basic nets.[5a] Concerning rare-earth rod-shaped MOFs, Devic, F-rey, and co-workers have, for the first time, synthesized the 3D lanthanide-based MOF MIL-103 with large one-dimensional tunnels and a high surface area.[6] In our previous studies, we have also successfully prepared a series of novel 3D rare-earth MOFs with rod-shaped SBUs by the reaction of rare-earth ions with 4,4’-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (H2bpdc).[7] However, such MOFs involving infinite rod- shaped metal carboxylate SBUs still remain largely unex- plored. Herein, our strategy for preparing non-interpenetrating large porous frameworks is to construct infinite rod-shaped cadmium carboxylate SBUs. To implement this design, we use a rigid, linear organic O-donor ligand, H2bpdc, as a linker, which has been shown to exhibit a variety of flexible coordination forms.[8] H2bpdc is longer (11.3 =) than common linear organic O-donor ligands, such as H2bdc (H2bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 7.7 =), and will have the potential to construct large porous MOFs. Herein, we describe the synthesis and structure of a novel metal–organic framework, [Cd3(bpdc)3(dmf)]·5dmf·18H2O (named JUC-48, JUC = Jilin University China), constructed from rod-shaped CdII carboxylate SBUs. Of particular interest is that these rod- shaped SBUs are interconnected through the biphenyl groups of bpdc to generate a 3D non-interpenetrating extended network with rare etb[5a] topology and 1D hexagonal nano- tube-like channels of 24.5 = @ 27.9 =. To our knowledge, JUC-48 is the MOF with the largest 1D nanotube-like channels reported to date.[6,9] The high-pressure hydrogen storage and fluorescence properties of JUC-48 have been examined. Additionally, for the first time, JUC-48 can be assembled with nanosized rhodamine 6G dye molecules (Rh6G), and the product (JUC-48·Rh6G) shows favorable temperature-dependent luminescent properties. X-ray crystallography reveals that JUC-48 crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, space group Pbcn (No. 60).[10] The fundamental building unit of JUC-48 contains three cadmium centers, three bpdc ligands, one coordinated dmf ligand, five guest dmf molecules, and eighteen guest H2O molecules. Two crystallographically distinct Cd atoms adopt distorted octa- hedral coordination geometries with six oxygen atoms from five carboxylate groups of bpdc. The third Cd center is coordinated by seven oxygen atoms from five carboxylate groups of bpdc and one terminal dmf ligand. Each bpdc ligand coordinates to five different CdII ions through two different coordination modes: bidentate and chelating/bisbridging bidentate. The six- and seven-coordinate CdII ions are linked together by carboxylate groups of bpdc to construct 1D Cd-O-C chains running along the [001] direction. These Cd-O-C chains, as rod-shaped SBUs, are interconnected through biphenyl groups of bpdc to generate a 3D non- interpenetrating extended network with 1D hexagonal chan- nels of 24.5 = @ 27.9 = (measured between opposite atoms) viewed along the [001] direction (Figures 1 and 2). When van der Waals radii of the atoms are taken into account, these channels are 21.1 = @ 24.9 =, in which the vacancies are filled with one coordinated dmf ligand, five guest dmf molecules, [*] Dr. Q.

Ed. 2007, 46, 6638 –6642 and eighteen guest H2O molecules per formula unit, as established by elemental analysis, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. Without guest molecules, the effective free volume of JUC-48 is calculated by PLATON analysis[12] to be 69.8% of the crystal volume (7085.1 =3 of the 10154.0-=3 unit cell volume). The permanent porosity of JUC-48 is confirmed by its N2 adsorption isotherm, which reveals a Langmuir surface area of 880 m2g1, pore volume of 0.19 cm3g1, and pore size of 18.8 =. It is notable that each hexagonal channel of JUC-48 can be viewed as a nanotube-like architecture. As shown in Figure 2, the distance between adjacent bpdc linkers is about 3.8 = (measured between carbon atoms of adjacent bpdc ligands), which indicates that strong CH···p interactions exist between them. Additionally, if van der Waals radii of the carbon atoms (1.7 =) and hydrogen atoms (1.2 =) are taken into account, these biphenyl rings of the bpdc ligands construct an impenetrable wall of bpdc units, and it is impossible for additional ligands to fill in between adjacent biphenyl groups.[5b] Thus, an interpenetration structure is prohibited, and a novel architecture with hexagonal nano- tube-like channels is formed. Futher insight into the structure of JUC-48 can be gained by reducing multidimensional structures to simple rod geo- metries and associated nets.[5] As shown in Figure 3, the carboxylate carbon atoms of the 1D Cd-O-C chain constitut- ing the rod-shaped SBU can be connected to construct a pseudo 31 or 32 helix. The helices are then linked by linear biphenyl groups of bpdc ligands to generate bnn[5a] parallel rod packing. Considering only the carboxylate carbon atoms as threefold connected nodes of extension and bpdc as bridged ligands, the resulting structure of JUC-48 is a three- fold connected 3D network, and its SchlLfli symbol is (83), which is a rare etb topology in MOFs.[13] The high-pressure hydrogen storage capability of JUC-48 was evaluated both at 77 K and at room temperature (298 K). Before the measurements, the sample of JUC-48 was soaked in CHCl3 for 48 h and then evacuated under dynamic vacuum at room temperature for 24 h to remove the included solvent molecules. The hydrogen adsorption isotherm (Figure 4) was recorded using a RUBOTHERM magnetic suspension bal- ance (Ankersmid B.V., Netherlands). At 77 K, the sorption Figure 1.

KGaA, Weinheim www.angewandte.org isotherm of JUC-48 has a type I profile which is saturated at 40 bar with a hydrogen uptake of about 2.8 wt%, which corresponds to a H2 storage capacity of 311.1 mLg1 and is equivalent to the adsorption of about 12 H2 molecules per formula unit. The room-temperature hydrogen storage capacity of JUC-48 is expected to be about 1.1 wt% at 100 bar, and the H2 uptake increases linearly with increasing hydrogen pressure. Although the hydrogen uptake of JUC-48 is lower than some reported MOFs with high hydrogen storage (such as MIL-101,[14] MOF-177[15] and [Zn3(bdt)3- (dmf)4(H2O)2]·3.5CH3OH[16]; bdt = 1,4-benzeneditetrazo- late), to our knowledge it is comparable with many MOFs and is higher than “active” carbon (CECA, France) and purified single-walled carbon nanotubes.[17,18] Encouraged by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction results, JUC-48 was assembled with nanosized Rh6G dye molecules (Figure 5a, inset) by adding Rh6G in ethanol (0.2 mL, 103 m) to the growth solution; the amount of Rh6G in the red- colored doped crystals was about 0.046%, as determined by TG, ICP, and elemental analysis (see the Supporting Infor- mation). Rh6G is a xanthene derivative used as a gain medium in dye lasers, and it exhibits strong absorption in the visible region and a very high fluorescence quantum yield.[19] Recently, an increasing number of studies have tried to incorporate Rh6G into hybrid organic–inorganic materials for applications in fields such as solid-state lasing, optical filters, and optoelectronics.[20] Figure 5a shows the fluores- cence spectra for JUC-48·Rh6G. Clearly, the strongest emission peak for JUC-48·Rh6G is at 563 nm with the excitation peak at 541 nm at room temperature, which is similar to the previous results obtained on Rh6G-doped mesostructured materials.[21] Furthermore, JUC-48·Rh6G can be also obtained by immersing JUC-48 for 36 h in solutions of Rh6G in ethanol with different concentrations (103, 104, and 105m). However, the emission peaks exhibit a blue shift (574 nm, 567 nm, and 555 nm, respectively) when the con- centration of the Rh6G solution used to prepare JUC- 48·Rh6G is decreased from 103 to 105m (see the Supporting Informationn), which implies that the Rh6G dye in the crystals is present as free monomer molecules and shows fine fluorescence properties.[22] The emission spectra of JUC- 48·Rh6G are also temperature-dependent. Figure 5b shows the emission spectra of JUC-48·Rh6G recorded at different temperatures (298–77 K). The peak location of JUC-48·Rh6G at 563 nm remains unchanged with decreasing temperature, while the intensity of the signal is enhanced linearly, which reveals that JUC-48·Rh6G will be a potential candidate for applications in temperature-sensing devices.[23] In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized a new MOF, [Cd3(bpdc)3(dmf)]·5dmf·18H2O (JUC-48), with the largest reported 1D hexagonal nanotube-like channels of 24.5 = @ 27.9 = and rare etb topology, constructed from rod- shaped cadmium carboxylate SBUs. JUC-48 exhibits good fluorescence properties and substantial hydrogen uptake. In addition, for the first time, JUC-48 was assembled with Rh6G dye molecules, and JUC-48·Rh6G shows favorable temper- ature-dependent luminescent properties. It is believed that these results will further facilitate the exploration of such MOFs as new types of functional materials for applications in fields such as optical materials, high-pressure hydrogen storage, and temperature-sensing materials.

Emission spectra of JUC-48 (black) and free H2bpdc (red) excited at 236 nm. The strongest emission peak of free bpdc is at 398 nm with the excitation peak at 236 nm. It is attributed to the π*→ n transitions. Compared with the free bpdc, the excitation peak for JUC-48 is also at 236 nm. However, its emission peak shows an obvious blue-shift, and exhibits the strong peak at 352 nm. The emission peak of JUC-48 can be assigned to the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) band. The result suggests that JUC-48 will be a potential photoactive material. 10 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 10 20 30 40 50 -0.005 0.000 0.005 0.010 0.015 0.020 0.025 0.030 0.035 0.040 dV/dW (cm 3g -1A -1) Pore width (angstrom) 18.8 Volume Adsorbed cm 3g -1 (STP) Ralative Pressure (P/PO) Figure S9.
