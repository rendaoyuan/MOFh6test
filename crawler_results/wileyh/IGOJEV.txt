In order to investigate the effect of the organic ligands on the structures of coordination polymers, two new cadmium(II) coordi- nation polymers based on the different dicarboxylate ligands, namely [Cd2(bpdc)2(DPNDI)2]·3H2O·NMF (1) and [Cd(obb)(DPNDI)] (2) [H2bpdc = biphenyl-4,4-dicarboxylate, H2obb = 4,4-oxybis(benzoic acid), DPNDI = N,N-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxy- Introduction The design and construction of coordination polymers (CPs) based on organic ligands and metal ions has attracted much interest for material chemists in recent years, due to not only their intriguing structure and impressive topology,[1–4] but also their potential applications as functional materials in the areas of magnetism, adsorption, separation, optics, electrics, cataly- sis and so on.[5–12] Although studies on the design and synthe- sis of CPs have been made rapid progress, many attempts have been made to synthesize functional crystalline material. The selection of appropriate organic ligands in the design and syn- thesis of CPs is a key step. The carboxylate ligands are versa- tile ligands, which can provide abundant coordination modes and generate various interesting structures and functional prop- erties.[13–16] On the other hand, the nitrogen-containing ligands have been proven the powerful precursor for the construction of diverse dimensional structures and topologies.[17–19] In this paper, we selected the biphenyl-4,4-dicarboxylate and 4,4-oxybis (benzoic acid) in the presence of Cd2+ ion and N,N-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxydiimide. The two carboxylate ligands possess different rigid/flexible properties, which may be lead to construct different structures. Fortunately, we successfully synthesized two new CdII CPs * Dr. X.

Complex 1 based on biphenyl-4,4-dicarboxylate features a three-dimensional (3D) framework with a 6-connected twofold interpenetrating pcu topology. Complex 2 based on 4,4-oxybis (benzoic acid) possesses a two-dimensional layer structure with –ABCD– stacking sequence. Results and Discussion Description of the Crystal Structures [Cd2(bpdc)2(DPNDI)2]·3H2O·NMF (1) Single X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that complex 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic system with Cmca space group. Each CdII is seven-coordinate with a pentagonal bipy- ramidal arrangement, completed by five carboxylate oxygen atoms [Cd(1)–O(1) = 2.327 (7) Å, Cd(1)–O(2) = 2.464 (5) Å, Cd(1)–O(3) = 2.476 (6) Å, and Cd(1)–O(4) = 2.293(6) Å] and two nitrogen atoms [Cd(1)–N(1) = 2.351(5) Å] . The two adjacent CdII atoms are linked together through chelating/bridging carboxylate groups, giving rise to a dinu- clear CdII units with the distance of 3.907 Å. The dinuclear CdII unit is bonded to four bpdc2– ligands and thus can be regarded as a 4-connected node to generate a 2D layer (Fig- ure 1), Figure 2). The 2D layers are further pillared by DPNDI to generate a 3D net (Figure 3). From a topological view, the dinuclear CdII units can be viewed as 6-connected nodes and the organic ligands can be treated as linkers, respectively, the 3D structure can be simplified as a pcu net. The potential voids in 1 are filled by mutual interpenetration of two identical 3D nets, which results in formation of a twofold interpenetrating Journal of Inorganic and General Chemistry Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie www.zaac.wiley-vch.de ARTICLE Figure 1.

Although the framework has interpen- etration, the structure contains oval nanotube channels, in which the free guest molecules fill the incipient voids (Fig- ure 5). Complexes constructed by DPNDI-dicarboxylate with twofold interpenetrated pcu topology have been reported, in which ZnII complexes are reported and the CdII complexes are less reported.[20,21] [Cd(obb)(DPNDI)] (2) The replacement of H2bpdc with H2obb leads to complex 2, which features a 2D layer structure. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 2 crystallizes in the triclinic system with P1¯ space group. Each CdII is six-coordi- nate by four carboxylate oxygen atoms [Cd(1)–O(5) = 2.477 (7) Å, Cd(1)–O(6) = 2.265(7) Å, Cd(1)–O(8) = 2.201 (7) Å, and Cd(1)–O(9) = 2.205 (7) Å] and two nitrogen atoms [Cd(1)–N(1) = 2.356 (9) Å and Cd(1)–N(3) = 2.326 (9) Å], showing an octahedral arrangement (Figure 6). Two CdII atoms, related by a twofold axis, are bridged by one pair of obb2– ligands to form a dinuclear unit with Cd–Cd distances of 4.2651 Å. The carboxylate groups connect dinuclear CdII Journal of Inorganic and General Chemistry Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie www.zaac.wiley-vch.de ARTICLE units to form a 1D chain (Figure 7). The 1D chains are further connected by DPNDI ligands to form a 2D layer (Figure 8). Interestingly, the 2D layers adopt –ABCD– stacking sequence and the distance of adjacent layers is 7.4414 Å (Figure 9). Figure 6. Local coordination arrangement of the central Cd2+ atoms. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Figure 7. The one-dimensional chain formed by Cd2+ ions and carb- oxylate ligands. Figure 8. The two-dimensional layer structure of complex 2. In complex 2, there exist intermolecular hydrogen bonds be- tween the C–H groups and oxygen atoms, which lead the 2D layer structure to form a 3D supramolecular structure (Fig- ure 10). The hydrogen bonds in the 3D supramolecular struc- ture are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

The 3D supramolecular structure for complex 2. were recorded at room temperature (Figure S1, Supporting In- formation). The peak positions of experimental and simulated PXRD patterns are in good agreement, which confirm their phase purity. Thermogravimetric experiments were performed on single- crystal samples of 1 and 2 in room temperature to 800 °C (Fig- ure S2, Supporting Information). Complex 1 first loses the lat- tice water and free NMF molecule in the 130–290 °C region (calcd. 6.80%, obsd. 6.82%), and then collapses. The final residual weight is attributed to CdO (calcd.15.44%, obsd. 15.47%). Complex 2 is thermally stable up to 385 °C, beyond which the framework begins to collapse, and the final residual weight is attributed to CdO (calcd. 16.28%, obsd. 16.30%). Photoluminescent Properties The luminescent properties of CPs with d10 metal atoms have attracted great interest because of their various applica- tions in photochemistry.[22,23] The main emission peaks of the free ligands H2bpdc, H2obb, and DPNDI were observed at 396 nm, 317 nm, and 430 nm, respectively, which can be as- signed to the π*–n or π*–π transitions.[24–26] The complexes 1 Journal of Inorganic and General Chemistry Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie www.zaac.wiley-vch.de ARTICLE and 2 show an emission peak at 354 nm and 400 nm, respec- tively (Figure 11). The emission spectra for complexes 1 and 2 show red shift compared with the carboxylate ligand emis- sion and blue shift compared with the DPNDI ligand emission, which may be attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge trans- fer.[27,28] In these complexes, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are presumably associated with the π-bond- ing orbitals from the pyridine group and/or aromatic rings, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are mainly associated with the Cd–N and Cd–O(carboxy) σ* antibonding orbitals, localized more on the metal atoms. Theoretically, the impact of the relativistic effect, the coordination structures, and electron correlation effects may induce the (n+1) s orbitals of the d10 metal contract, and therefore possessing lower energies. Thus, the LMCT can happen with enough excitation energy and lead to the emission in these complexes.[29,30] Figure 11. The emission spectra of complexes 1 and 2 in the solid state at room temperature. Conclusions Two new CdII coordination polymers were successfully syn- thesized under solvothermal conditions by reactions of DPNDI and CdII salt together with different auxiliary carboxylate li- gands. The diverse structures of complexes 1 and 2 are mainly caused by the different auxiliary carboxylate ligands. Experimental Section Materials and Physical Measurements: All the reagents were pur- chased commercially and used as received without further purification. The N,N-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxydiimide was synthesized as in the literature.[31] Elemental analysis was carried out with a Carlo Erba 1106 full-automatic trace organic elemental analyzer. FT-IR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Equinox 55 FT-IR spec- trometer as a dry KBr pellet in the 400–4000 cm–1 range. Luminescent spectra were recorded with a SHIMAZU VF-320 X-ray fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature. Syntheses of [Cd2(bpdc)2(DPNDI)2]·3H2O·NMF (1): A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (15.42 mg, 0.05 mmol), H2bpdc (12.1 mg, 0.05 mmol), DPNDI (20.6 mg, 0.05 mmol), and NMF(3 mL) was added to a 10mL vial. The vial was sealed, held at 90 °C for 48 h, and finally cooled to room temperature. Yellow crystals of 1 were obtained in 60% yield based on Cd (49.89 mg). C78H55Cd2N9O20: calcd.

Syntheses of [Cd(obb)(DPNDI)] (2): Yellow crystals of 2 were ob- tained in 55% yield based on Cd (21.70 mg) by a procedure similar to that used for 1 except that H2bpdc was replaced by H2obb (13.4 mg, 0.05 mmol).

X-ray Crystallography: Single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses of complexes 1 and 2 were carried out with a Bruker SMART APEXII CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) by using a ω-scan mode. Empirical absorp- tion correction was applied using the SADABS programs.[32] All the structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 using the program SHELXL 97.[33] All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were located by geometrically calculations, and their positions and thermal parameters were fixed during the structure refinement.
