Manuscript ARTICLE DOI: 10.1002/zaac.201000053 Utilising Metal Melts of Low-Melting Metals as a Novel Approach for MOF Synthesis: The 3D-Imidazolate 3∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] from Gallium and Imidazole Alexander Zurawski,[a] Frauke Hintze,[a] and Klaus Müller-Buschbaum*[a,b] Dedicated to Professor Rüdiger Kniep on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday Keywords: Metal-organic frameworks; Coordination polymers; Gallium; Imidazolates; Metal melts Abstract. Metals with low melting points like gallium (mp. 30 °C) prove a new approach for the synthesis of MOFs. As the melting point of gallium is even lower than of the linker ligand imidazole, formation of the MOF 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH], Im– = imidazolate anion, ImH = imida- zole, can be achieved by reaction of a melt of the referring metal with a melt of the ligand. Gallium is oxidised in the reaction, and hydrogen gas and the imidazolate amide as colourless single crystalline product are formed. At the melting point of imidazole (mp. 88–90 °C) two liquid phases are observed. Phase separation lasts until the reaction, Introduction Over the past years we developed a synthesis strategy for amide and amine coordination compounds and polymers of the rare earth elements [1–2]. It derives from the oxidation of non- noble metals with a melt of an amine R2–NH and includes the formation of hydrogen gas and amide ligands. No additional solvent is used, which proves an advantage for the oxophilic lanthanides [3–7], especially as oxygen-containing solvents are avoided. First shown for small molecular complexes from tert- butyl substituted pyrazole [8], the absence of unwanted co- ligands also proves a suitable strategy for unsubstituted aro- matic N-heterocyclic ligands to obtain 1D chain like coordina- tion polymers [9], 2D networks [10] and 3D frameworks [11]. Because of the high melting points of the rare earth metals all reaction occurs between solid metal and ligand melt. In order to elaborate our strategy further other non-noble metals in the periodic Table need to be utilised. Successful attempts were made with group 2 metals [12]. In the third main group the element gallium attracted our attention because of its low melt- ing point (mp. 30 °C). This renders a new option accessible: metal melts for solvent free syntheses of organic amides.

We consider this a reaction on the phase border between the liquid phases as no mixing is observed. 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] constitutes of a three-dimensional frame- work structure with a 3,6 topology that is built of two Kagome nets sharing common connectivity points. Each Ga3+ ion is octahedrally coordinated by six nitrogen atoms of imidazolate and imidazole li- gands. The framework exhibits a limited porosity of 8.5 % of accessi- ble space and a diameter of 376–509 pm for the pore windows. 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] we now present that low melting metal melts can indeed be used as a new approach to such compounds. It can even be utilised for the synthesis of MOFs [13] as the trend towards highly aggregated systems is not diminishing by the use of molten gallium. Experimental Section All manipulations were carried out under inert atmosphere using glove box, ampoule as well as vacuum line techniques. The IR spectra were recorded using a BRUKER FTIR-IS66V-S spectrometer. For the IR investigations KBr pellets were used under vacuum. The thermal prop- erties were studied using multiple simultaneous DTA/TG (SETARAM TG-DTA 92–16) on the reaction of gallium metal with imidazole and on single crystalline 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH]. Samples were heated from 20 °C up to 800 °C in a constant helium flow of 50 ml·min–1. Gallium (6.4 mg) was treated with ImH (19.8 mg) at a heating rate of 5 °C·min–1, crystalline 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] (19.0 mg) and “Ga(Im)3” (16.8 mg) were treated at a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1. The micro analysis was carried out on a ELEMENTAR Vario El analyser. Synthesis of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] Gallium (70 mg = 1 mmol) and imidazole (ImH, C3H3NNH; 204 mg = 3 mmol) were sealed in an evacuated DURAN glass ampoule. The reaction mixture was heated in 24 h to 120 °C and held at this tempera- ture for 1850 h. The melt was cooled to room temperature in 1 h. The reaction gave a colourless crystalline product of trapezoidal crystals of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH]. Yield (ImH): 181 mg (69 %). Shorter reaction times decrease the yield of the reaction. Higher reaction temperatures result in a different poorly crystalline product (see Discussion). A. Zurawski, F. Hintze, K.

Crystal Structure Determination A suitable crystal of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] was selected for the single-crys- tal X-ray analysis under glovebox conditions and sealed in a glass capillary. The data collection was carried out with a STOE IPDS-I diffractometer (Mo-Kα radiation λ = 0.7107 Å) at 140 K. The structure was determined using direct methods [14]. All non hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically by least-squares techniques [15]. The po- sitions of the hydrogen atoms were also derived from the differential Fourier card and refined isotropically. 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] crystallises in the monoclinic space group C2/c (No. 15). The integrity of symmetry and geometry were checked with the program PLATON [16]. Crystal- lographic data are summarised in Table 1. Further information was deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, CCDC, 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK (Fax: +44-1223336033 or E- Mail: deposit@ccdc.cam.ac.uk) and may be requested by citing the deposition number CCDC-774000, the names of the authors and the literature citation. 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] was also investigated on powder samples in sealed capillaries on a STOE Stadi P diffractometer with a focussed single crystal germanium monochromator (Cu-Kα1 radiation, λ = 1.540598 Å and Mo-Kα1 radiation, λ = 0.70930 Å).

The low crystalli- nity of this product does not allow a reasonable indexing of the pow- der, so that at the current stage it can only be stated that larger differen- ces in the d values of the main reflections between 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] and “[Ga(Im)3]” will have larger differences in their crystal structures [17]. Discussion Synthesis and Thermal Properties In order to study the products of the reaction of gallium metal with imidazole (ImH = C3H3NNH) a double strategy was followed. The reaction was carried out in glass ampoules in a glass tube oven (co. BÜCHI) that allows macroscopic ob- servation. First both reagents melt (Ga: mp. 30 °C, imidazole: mp: 88–90 °C. The two liquid phases do not mix but retain a clear phase border between the colourless melt of the ligand (top) and the metallic melt of gallium (bottom). At 120 °C first reaction is observed in the glass tube oven by the appearance of a white milky shade at the phase border and low bubbling of H2. During the reaction more and more of a white product is formed as colourless crystals of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] at the phase border up to yields of 70 %. Non-stoichiometric investigations The 3D-Imidazolate 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] retain the excess of the referring reagent. Higher temperatures lead to microcrystalline material and finally a powder product of “[Ga(Im)3]” (Scheme 1). Scheme 1. The amine imidazole = ImH (left) and the crucial M–li- gand–M angle of the imidzolate ligand = Im– (right). In addition the reaction was carried out on a thermal analyser (co. SETARAM) but is too slow to be followed by simultane- ous DTA/TG. Therefore DTA/TG investigations on 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] and “[Ga(Im)3]” were carried out (Figure 1). They exhibit four steps of thermal processes for 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] until complete decomposition, all endother- mic and all combined to a mass loss. The first two steps at 300 and 380 °C reveal the release of imidazole. Due to the results Figure 1. The thermal analysis of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] (top) and of “[Ga(Im)3]” (bottom). 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] undergoes transformation into a high-temperature phase that is assumed to be “[Ga(Im)3]” upon the two step release of imidazole [signals (1) and (2)]. The high tempera- ture phase decomposes at 485 °C. This is corroborated by the absence of signals (1) and (2) in the investigation of “[Ga(Im)3]”. Its decompo- sition is also a two step process that ends in an amorphous residue. Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2010, 1333–1338 © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 1335 from other aromatic amides [1–2, 9–11] we expect them to be identified with release of the neutral ligand prior to the release of anions from the system to give an assumed high temperature compound “[Ga(Im)3]”. Further heating to 485 °C leads to de- composition of this high temperature phase [485 °C signal (3), 560 °C signal (4)] and yields amorphous products. In order to prove the assumption of a high temperature phase the high temperature product initially from the glass oven ex- periment was also investigated by DTA/TG. It is in agreement with the previous identifications as it only displays signals (3) and (4). They do not derive from 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] itself (see Figure 1, bottom), as also the powder pattern of the product of signal (2) “[Ga(Im)3]” differs strongly from the pattern of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH], whereas the powder patterns of “[Ga(Im)3]” from the glass tube oven experiment and the DTA/TG experi- ment show the same pattern. Unfortunately, crystallinity of “[Ga(Im)3]” is too low allow a successful structure resolution from X-ray powder techniques, which prove successful only for a certain crystallinity and at best high symmetry [18]. To the best of our knowledge this is the first example in which a metal melt was utilised for a MOF synthesis. It enlar- ges the range of our rather “extreme” reaction conditions that includes high temperature reactions in ligand melts [1, 2, 9– 11], the use of microwaves [19], electrides [20] and ball mill synthesis [21]. Crystal Structure The crystal structure of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] is a three-dimen- sional framework structure in which imidazolate anions link gallium(III) ions by alternating μ2-η1:η1 N-coordinations. The structure contains two different gallium sites that are both octa- hedrally coordinated but exhibit different linkage orders to other gallium atoms. Ga(1) is coordinated by six nitrogen Figure 2. Depiction of the framework structure of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] as a view on the [110] plane and with coordination polyhedra of nitrogen atoms around the gallium atoms (top). N–N-connection lines mark only the coordination polyhedra and do not represent bonds. The framework exhibits voids with pore windows in the critical 4.5 Å re- gion. Paths for sorption cannot be not linear illustrated by transparent van-der-Waals spheres, as the overlay is only about half of the window diameters in a straight line along the c axis (bottom). A.

Four imidazolate anions are μ2-η1:η1 linking to four other gal- lium atoms in two dimensions. Top and bottom of the coordi- nation octahedron do not link to other gallium atoms, viz. one imidazolate anion and the imidazole molecule contribute as end-on ligands only. Ga(2) is coordinated by six nitrogen at- oms of six imidazolate anions, which all link μ2-η1:η1 with the other nitrogen atom to six other gallium atoms in all three dimensions. Figure 2 displays the coordination of the gallium atoms Figure 3 the framework structure of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH]. Figure 3.

With a Niggli formula of 3 ∞[Ga(Im)6/2Ga(Im)4/2(Im)1/1(ImH)1/1] and a metal:ligand ratio of 2:7, the structure does not adopt a simple known structure type. However a careful look into detail 1336 www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2010, 1333–1338 of the two-dimensional subnets of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] reveals that they can be derived from Kagome nets. They exhibit a network topology that consists of small three-membered rings and large six-membered rings consisting of two 2D nets, both having a (3,4) topology. Both Kagome nets have common connectivity centres in Ga2 (with Ga1 having a connectivity of four and Ga2 of six). 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] has an overall network topology of (3,6). The two 2D nets are not perpendicular. Instead they exhibit an inter plane angle of 144.6° and exactly corroborate the angle M–Im–– M of 145° that is typical for metal imidazolates [22]. This angle is typically used as an analogue to the Si-O-Si angle in silicates and thus the possibility for imidazolates to adopt zeolite structures (ZIFs) [22]. As this is further combined to tetrahedral coordina- tions, 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] cannot be a zeolite analogue. The topology and relation with a Kagome net are depicted in Figure 4. Figure 4. Topological drawings of the 3,6 framework structure of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] consisting of two (3,4) nets. Each of the two-dimen- sional nets adopts a Kagome net of triangles around a sixfold ring. Both Kagome nets have common connectivity points. The interatomic distances in 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] corroborate the expectations for octahedral GaIII–N [23]: They range from 204.7(2) to 209.8(3) pm. For comparison, in [Ga(pypepH)2]Cl·2H2O the GaIII–N distances observed range from 200.7(2) to 215.2(2) pm [24] and in [(5- mpyr)4GaCl2][GaCl4] they are 207(2) and 209(2) pm [25]. For cubic GaN (octahedral coordination sphere of gallium) the re- ferring distances are 199.2 and 199.3 [26], being shorter due to the high charge of the nitride ion. For a tetrahedral Ga–N coordination even shorter distances would be expected like 194.1 and 195.0 pm in the hexagonal GaN [27]. No gallium imidazolate was structurally characterised prior to this investigation. [GaCl(Im)2(H2O)] and [Ga(Im)4Cl2]Cl were reported but without any structure data [28, 25]. Further- more Ga2O3 reacted with imidazole by milling and reported to react slowly upon “intensive grinding” [29]. But the investiga- tion also does neither provide any structure determinations nor a product formula, only IR bands are given. For relevant inter- atomic distances and angles of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] presented here, see Table 2. The crystal structure of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] furthermore exhibits voids of 200 Å3 per unit cell equalling 8.5 % free space re- garding the size of a guest molecule like water and the van- der-Waals spheres of the framework atoms [16]. This should be sufficient for sorption processes of guest atoms and small molecules, so that the framework classifies as a MOF struc- The 3D-Imidazolate 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] Table 2.

Furthermore the network exhibits critical channel win- dows of 3.8–5.1 Å diameters as possible paths for sorption processes (see Figure 2, bottom). First BET investigations were carried out observing the adsorption of N2 gas at 77 K. They exhibit a low porosity of 12.5 cm3·g–1 N2 sorption for the micropores. Possible discrimination of adsorbents was reported with window sizes of the pores of the same dimension for Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bpe)0.5 (FMA = fumarate, 4,4'-Bpe = 4,4'- Bpe = trans-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene) [30], and nitrogen being the least favourable of the two to three atom molecules H2, N2, CO, CO2, H2O investigated. Therefore multiple gas BET investigations with different adsorbents are also planned for 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] to investigate if it is also an adsorbent select- ive MOF that shows higher porosity for other adsorbents. Conclusions With the synthesis of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] we present a frame- work that utilises a melt of the low melting gallium metal to- gether with molten imidazole as linker. To the best of our knowledge this is the first example in the literature that de- scribes the use of a metal melt for MOF synthesis. Furthermore this is also the first report of a crystal structure of a gallium imidazolate.
