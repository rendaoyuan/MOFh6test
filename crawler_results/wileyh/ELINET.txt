The reactions of transition metal salts or hydroxide with 1,4- phenylenediacetic acid (H2PDA) in the presence of ancillary ligands 4,4'-bipyridine (4,4'-bpy) or imidazole (Im) produced five coordination polymers with the empirical formula [M(PDA)(4,4'-bpy)(H2O)2]n [M = Mn (1), Ni (2)], [Cu(PDA)(4,4'-bpy)]n·2nH2O (3), [Ni(PDA)(Im)2(H2O)2]n·nH2O (4), and [Cu(PDA)(Im)2]n·2nH2O (5). Their structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. The isomorphous 1 and 2 present a two-dimensional sheet constructed by two kinds of one-dimensional chains of –NiII–PDA2–– NiII– and –NiII–4,4'-bpy–NiII–.

The studies about the dependence of their properties on the structures revealed that the key importance is to select proper linkers to control the structures and therefore their properties [6, 7]. To achieve the aimed structure and properties, rigid ligands are usually chosen as linkers prior to flexible ligands because it is much easier to control the structure [4, 7]. However, the coordination polymers assembled from flexible ligands may show some unusual advantages in structures and properties over those assembled from rigid ligands. Thus we set out to investi- gate the coordination behavior of the flexible aromatic carbox- ylic acids of 1,4-phenylenediacetic acid (H2PDA) in contrast to that of the rigid ligands such as 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid. In previous studies, we prepared two compounds [Ni3(PDA)3(phen)2]n·2nH2O [8] and [Mn3(PDA)3(2,2'-bpy)2]n [9] using 1,4-phenylenediacetate as the linker in the presence of chelating ancillary ligands of 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) or 2,2'- bipyridine (2,2'-bpy).

Both 4 and 5 show one-dimensional chain structure. The difference of compound 4 and 5 is that the two carboxylato groups of PDA2– in 4 adopt monodentate coordination modes, whereas the two carboxylato groups of PDA2– in 5 chelate to the metal ions. Magnetic susceptibility data of 1 were measured. Magnetically, 1 presents a one- dimensional chain with a weak antiferromagnetic interaction (J = –0.064 cm–1) between the intrachain MnII atoms mediated by 4,4'-bpy. sional structures constructed by trinuclear units. Other groups also reported some transition metal 1,4-phenylenediacetate com- plexes in the presence of ancillary ligands such as 2,2'-bpy, ami- nopyridine, phen, and 4,4'-bpy [10–17]. All published transition metal-PDA coordination polymers are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information) [8–21]. For further study, we set out to investigate the interactions of 1,4-phenylenediacetate with MnII, NiII, or CuII in the presence of 4,4'-bipyridine or imidazole as ancillary ligands. Therefore, we report herein the synthesis and structures of three two-dimen- sional coordination polymers [M(PDA)(4,4'-bpy)(H2O)2]n [M = Mn (1), Ni (2)], [Cu(PDA)(4,4'-bpy)]n·2nH2O (3) and two one- dimensional coordination polymers [Ni(PDA)(Im)2(H2O)2]n· nH2O (4) and [Cu(PDA)(Im)2]n·2nH2O (5). The magnetic prop- erties of 1 were also investigated. Results and Discussion Crystal Structure The PXRD patterns of the microcrystals of 1, 2, and 4 agree well with the simulated ones based on their crystal structures, respectively, confirming their phase purity, as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Furthermore, compounds 1 and 2 present similar PXRD pattern, indicating that 1 and 2 are isomorphous. Thus only the structure of 2 is discussed herein in detail. As shown in Figure 1, the NiII ion in 2 possesses a slightly distorted octahedral coordination environment formed by the coordination of two water molecules, two nitrogen at- oms from two 4,4'-bpy molecules, and another two oxygen atoms from two PDA2– ligands. The Ni–O and Ni–N bond lengths are comparable to those in related compounds [22–24]. Z. Chen, Q. Zhao, W. Xiong, Z. Zhang, F. Liang ARTICLE Each PDA2– ligand in 2 bridges two NiII ions with its two trans-located carboxylato groups in monodentate coordination modes, leading to the construction of one-dimensional –NiII– PDA2––NiII– chain. Each 4,4'-bpy molecule bridges also two NiII ions into another type of one-dimensional chain –NiII–4,4'- bpy–NiII–. The two kinds of one-dimensional chains weave into a two-dimensional sheet (Figure 2). Figure 1. Molecular structure of 2 with displacement ellipsoids drawn at the 30 % probability level.

Different from 1 and 2, each CuII ion of 3 is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from three PDA2– ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two 4,4'-bpy molecules to build a distorted octahe- dral coordination environment (Figure 3). The two nearest CuII ions are connected by two carboxylato groups from two PDA2– ligands to construct a dinuclear unit with a Cu···Cu distance of 4.290(2) Å. The remaining two carboxylato groups in the dinuclear unit chelate to two CuII ions from another two neigh- boring dinuclear units, respectively, leading to the formation of one-dimensional chains along (001) direction (Figure 4). Adjacent dinuclear units from neighboring chains are further bridged along (011) direction by two 4,4'-bpy molecules to form a two-dimensional sheet (Figure 5). This is similar to the reported structures [13]. 2692 www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2010, 2691–2697 Figure 3.

Two-dimensional structure of 3. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. From a topological view, compound 3 features a topological network as shown in Figure 6 with the Schläfli symbol (42.67.8)(42.6), which was calculated using the program OLEX [25]. In the topological network, each 4,4'-bpy acts as a simple bridge, whereas the PDA2– ligand acts as a 3-connecting node to coordinate to three CuII ions. The CuII ion in return acts as a 5-connecting node coordinating to three PDA2– ligands and two 4,4'-bpy ligands. Transition Metal Coordination Polymers Bearing 1,4-Phenylenediacetate Figure 6. Topological view of the structure of 3 viewed down the a axis. Green and red spheres represent CuII and PDA2–, respectively. Purple lines represent the μ2-4,4'-bpy ligands. As shown in Figure 7, both Ni1 and Ni2 atoms in 4 have distorted octahedral arrangements formed by two oxygen at- oms from two PDA2– ligands, two nitrogen atoms from two imidazole ligands and two water molecules. Each PDA2– li- gand links two NiII ions using its two carboxylato groups in monodentate coordination modes. Thus the adjacent Ni1 or Ni2 ions are connected by PDA2– ligands to form one dimen- sional chains along (101) and (001) directions as shown in Figure 7. In this compound the two carboxylato groups of PDA2– ligand are at trans positions. Figure 7. 1D chains of 4.

As shown in Figure 8, the CuII ion in 5 has a distorted octa- hedral arrangement completed by four oxygen atoms from two PDA2– ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two imidazole ligands. Each PDA2– ligand links two CuII ions using its two carboxylato groups in chelating coordination modes. This is similar to that of {[Cd(PDA)(Py)2(H2O)](H2O)}n, but different from that of [Cu(PDA)(Py)2(H2O)2]n [14]. Thus, the adjacent CuII ions are connected by PDA2– ligands to form one dimen- sional chain as shown in Figure 8. In this compound the two carboxylato groups of PDA2– ligand are at trans positions.

In these compounds, the two carboxylato groups of PDA2– are at cis positions in 3 and at trans positions in the other compounds. The PDA2– ligand in 1, 2, and 4 behaves as a μ2-bridge con- necting two neighboring metal ions with its two carboxyalato groups in monodentate coordination modes. The PDA2– ligand in 5 links also two metal ions, but its two carboxylato groups are in chelating coordination modes. In 3, the PDA2– ligand connects three metal ions with one of the carboxylato group in a syn–anti coordination mode and the other carboxylato group in a chelating mode. These bridging modes of PDA2– in this paper, together with those in the reported papers, are summa- rized in Figure 9. Figure 9. Schematic representation of coordination modes of PDA2–. Magnetic Properties Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed with polycrystalline samples of 1 at an applied field of 1 kOe in the temperature range of 2.0–300 K. The plots in the form of both χMT and χM versus T plots are shown in Figure 10. The χmT value of 1 at 300 K is 4.70 cm3·K·mol–1, which is close to that expected (4.38 cm3·K·mol–1) for one magnetically isolated high-spin MnII ion. The χMT values of 1 gradually decrease on cooling, reaching 3.62 cm3·K·mol–1 at 2 K. This reveals an overall antiferromagnetic coupling in 1. Fitting of the χm –1–T above 100 K using the Curie–Weiss law χm = C/(T–θ) gives the Curie constants C = 4.72 cm3·K·mol–1 and the Weiss constants θ = –0.63 K for 1. Magnetically, it shows a one-dimensional chain because the PDA2– ligand can not effectively transmit magnetic interac- tions between the MnII atoms. Thus the experimental magnetic behavior of 1 can be simulated using the analytical expression derived by Fisher for a 1D Heisenberg chain of classical spins (S = 5/2, H = –J ΣiSiSj) with a consideration of interchain magnetic exchange estimated by mean field model [26–29].

KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2010, 2691–2697 weak antiferromagnetic interaction between the MnII ions me- diated by 4,4'-bpy. Conclusions In this work we prepared five transition metal complexes by using the ligand of 1,4-phenylendiacetate, which has some ex- tent of flexibility. Their structures were tuned by ancillary li- gands. The presence of 4,4'-bpy in compounds 1–3 led to the construction of two-dimensional sheet. However, the presence of Im in compounds 4 and 5 helps to build one-dimensional structure. The magnetic property of 1 was investigated. It was found out that 1 presents a one-dimensional chain with a weak antiferromagnetic interaction between the intrachain MnII at- oms mediated by 4,4-bpy. Experimental Section Materials and Instrumentation All reagents were used without further purification. The infrared spec- tra were recorded from KBr pellets in the range 4000–400 cm–1 with a Perkin–Elmer spectrum one FT-IR spectrometer. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed with a Perkin–Elmer 2400II CHN elemental analyzer. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data were collected Transition Metal Coordination Polymers Bearing 1,4-Phenylenediacetate with a Rigaku D/max 2500v/pc diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Magnetic measurements were carried out with a Quan- tum Design MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer. The measurements were recorded at a magnetic field of 1 kOe in the temperature range 2–300 K.

To this solution was added MnCO3 (0.2 mmol, 0.0230 g). The resulted mixture was subsequently sealed and heated at 120 °C for 6 days.

X-ray Crystallographic Studies Crystallographic data for complexes 1–5 were collected with a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer with graphite momochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073Å). Absorption correction were applied by using the multi-scan program SADABS [30]. The structures were solved by direct methods of SHELXS-97 and were refined by full-matrix least- squares against F2 using the SHELXL-97 program [31] or the corre- sponding programs in the SHELXTL package [32]. After all of the non-hydrogen atoms were located, the model was refined again, ini- tially using isotropic and later anisotropic thermal displacement param- eters. Hydrogen atoms of water molecules were located in a difference Fourier map and refined isotropically in the final refinement cycles. Other hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and refined using a riding model. A summary of crystallographic and structural refinement data for compounds 1–5 is given in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles for compounds 1–5 are given in Table 2. CCDC-767435, -767436, -767437, -767438, and -767439 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for compounds 1–5.
