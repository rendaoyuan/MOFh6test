To investigate the coordination chemistry of 1-subsitituted tetrazole derivatives compared with the 5-subsitituted tetrazole deriva- tives and to get a better knowledge of the influence of the metal ions and co-ligand for the structures of the complexes, three complexes based upon tetrazolate groups were synthesized and structurally char- acterized by X-ray single-crystal diffraction: [CoLCl2] (1), [ZnLCl2] (2), and [Cu4L2(N3)8]n (3) [L = 2-(1-phenyl-1H-tetrazol-5-ylsulfanyl- menthyl)pyridine]. In complexes 1 and 2, the C–H···N and C–H···Cl intermolecular hydrogen bonds results in 2D supramolecular struc- Introduction Recently, many complexes with fascinating topologies and interesting properties were obtained in the fields of supra- molecular chemistry and engineering.[1–4] However, the ratio- nal design of complexes with special properties is still a chal- lenge for chemists because many factors play an important role in their self-assembly.[5–7] The selection of multidentate or- ganic ligands is a key point in the rational design of the ex- pected complexes. An application of five-membered polyazole rings as donor groups opens the possibility to tune the proper- ties of the ligand molecules by both the careful selection of the polyazole donors and the type and position of the substituent in the heterocycle ring[8–10] as well as six-membered rings substi- tuted with nitrogen atoms.[11] In the group of polyazoles, tetra- zole and its derivatives occupy particular positions.[12–15] In our previous studies, the 5-substituted tetrazole deriva- tives were employed for the construction of novel structures with diverse multidimensionalities and with useful properties such as luminescence, magnetic, and chiral properties.[16,17] In order to compare and expand our previous work, we focus our attention on the ligand of 1-substituted tetrazole and its derivatives, we synthesized one new ligand L [L = 2-(1- phenyl-1H-tetrazol-5-ylsulfanylmenthyl)pyridine] and its three complexes, namely, [CoLCl2] (1), [ZnLCl2] (2), and [Cu4L2(N3)8]n (3).

In 3, the μ-1,1 coordination modes of N3– and the bridging coordination mode of L build a 2D layer structure. In com- plexes 1 and 2, hydrogen bonding interactions play important roles in increasing the dimensionality of supramolecular assemblies. Mean- while, the electronic spectrum of complex 1 and the fluorescent prop- erties of complex 2 were also studied. tained complexes, their electronic spectra, and fluorescent properties. Further studies of this new functional ligand with other metal ions are currently in progress. Results and Discussion Description of Crystal Structures for Complexes 1–3 X-ray crystallography shows that [CoLCl2] (1) and [ZnLCl2] (2) are isomorphic, so we only describe the structure of complex 1. The structure of 1 consists of neutral molecular [CoLCl2], in which the CoII ion has a tetracoordinate environ- ment, as shown in Figure 1(a). The CoII is coordinated by one tetrazole nitrogen atom, one pyridine nitrogen atom, and two coordinated chloride anions. The Co–N and Co–Cl bond lengths are in the range 2.027(2)–2.2334(9) Å and are similar to those of other tetrahedral cobalt(II) complexes with a chro- mophore group [CoCl2N2]. The bond angles are in the range 104.64(9)–113.35(3)°, which suggests that the coordination ar- rangement around CoII is a slightly distorted tetrahedral con- figuration with the bond angles deviating from the expected value of 109.5° (the largest deviation being 4.86°). The ligand L acts as bidentate chelated ligand and coordinates to the CoII atom. Two Cl– anions are balancing the electric charge and acting as coordinating donors. It is obvious that two kinds of symmetry-independent inter- molecular hydrogen bonds exist in the crystal structure, One is between the chlorine atom from two intermolecular hydro- gen bonds and CH from the pyridine unit of the ligand L and the CH2 aliphatic group from the ligand L of another molecule, respectively: C(8A)–H(8A)···Cl(1) (C···Cl 3.812 Å, H···Cl 2.899, angle 165.10°, symmetry code: x, –y + 1/2, z + 1/2) and C(11)–H(11)···Cl(1) (C···Cl 3.732 Å, H···Cl 2.876, angle X.-L.

Chem. 2011, 2265–2272 2266 third intermolecular hydrogen bond and the carbon atom of benzene ring from the ligand L C(5)–H(5)···N(2) (C···N 3.369 Å, H···N 2.610 Å, angle 139.18°, symmetry code: x, –y + 1/2, z + 1/2). Besides, there also exists one intramolecular hydrogen bond C(6)–H(6)···S(1) (C···S 3.288 Å, H···S 2.793 Å, angle 116.72°, symmetry code: x, y, z), as shown in Fig- ure 1(b). These hydrogen bonds link the whole molecule into a 2D supramolecular structure in the bc plane, as shown in Figure 1(c). It is obvious that one molecule connects another three molecules through the above mentioned intermolecular hydrogen bonds as shown in Figure 1(b). The whole 2D frame- work was accordingly simplified as illustrated in Figure 1(c). It is a 3-connected net with its point (Schläfli) symbol (63), in which each molecule acts as a 3-connected node, see Fig- ure 1(d). In the crystal the combination of coordinative and hydrogen-bonding interactions results in the stabilization of a supramolecular solid-state architecture. X-ray crystallography shows that [Cu4L2(N3)8]n (3) has a 2D framework constructed by the ligand L and CuII ions asso- ciated with N3– anions. It crystallizes in space group P1¯. The asymmetric unit consists of four CuII ions, two L molecules, and eight N3– anions. As shown in Figure 2(a), the atoms Cu(1) and Cu(2) are both five-coordinate [CuN5], and are co- ordinated by four nitrogen atoms of μ-1,1 N3– anions and one pyridine nitrogen atom of the ligand L in a distorted tetragonal pyramidal arrangement. The Cu–N bond lengths are in the range 1.978(9)–2.273(8) Å and 1.993(9)–2.270(8) Å for Cu(1) and Cu(2), respectively. The atoms Cu(3) and Cu(4) are also five-coordinate [CuN5], and are coordinated by four nitrogen atoms of μ-1,1 N3– anions and one tetrazole nitrogen atom of the ligand L in a distorted tetragonal pyramidal arrangement. The Cu–N bond lengths are in the range 1.958(9)–2.331(9) Å and 1.959(9)–2.278(10) Å for Cu(3) and Cu(4), respectively. The bond angles are in the range 75.4(3)–168.6(4)°, 76.4(3)– 168.6(4)°, 78.2(3)–167.4(4)°, and 78.7(3)–168.9(4)° for Cu(1), Cu(2), Cu(3), and Cu(4), respectively. All N3– anions in com- plex 3 adopt μ-1,1 coordination modes, which link the CuII ion into 1D chains along the b axis (Figure 2(b)). The ligand L acts as bridge between two CuII ions and connects the 1D chains into a 2D sheet along the a axis (see Figure 2(c)). The Cu···Cu distances are 3.1146 Å, 3.086 Å, and 3.079 Å con- nected by the μ-1,1 coordinating N3– anions, whereas the Cu···Cu distances connected by the ligand L (nitrogen atoms from the pyridine and tetrazole of the ligand) are 8.234 Å and 8.255 Å. The N3– anions are balancing the electric charge and acting as coordinating donors. From the topological point of view, the whole 2D structure of the complex 3 is a 3-connected net with its point (Schläfli) symbol (63) with each CuII ion as a 3-connected node (see Figure 2 (d)). Summary of the Structures The tetrazole ring and the pyridine ring of L can either act as monodentate or multidentate ligands when coordinating to metal ions under different conditions. Two coordination modes were observed in the title complexes (Figure 3). Interestingly, in complexes 1 and 2, L adopts a chelating coordination mode Co, Zn, and Cu Complexes with a Tetrazole-based Ligand Figure 2.

KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 2267 (Figure 3(a)), whereas it adopts a bridging coordination mode in complex 3 with a rotation of the single bonds of C–S–C–C in L (Figure 3(b)). Herein, 1,5-substituted tetrazole acts as main ligand, compared with the homogeneous ligands in refer- ence[18], they displayed similar coordination modes with the nitrogen atoms of 3,4- or 4-positions. Obviously, they have much less coordination modes comparing with the 5-substi- tuted tetrazoles,[12a] because the nitrogen atoms of the tetrazole rings were replaced with other groups. Additionally, the N3– plays the important role in the construction of complex 3, and it only shows a μ-1,1 coordination mode compared to those species found in previous studies containing similar N3– co- ligands.[19] Figure 3.

Spectroscopic Studies Electronic Spectra The electronic spectra of the ligand L and complex 1 were measured in DMF solution with different concentrations as shown in Figure 4. In the UV region, the spectra show a sharp intense band centered at 268 nm for complex 1 with a concen- tration of 10–5 mol·L–1 (Figure 4a). The corresponding band at X.-L. Tong, J.-H.

Chem. 2011, 2265–2272 2268 268 nm can be assigned to an intra-ligand (IL) π–π* band and probably seems to be due to the metal d electrons being par- tially delocalized over the ligand L, which is slightly different from the ligand of the concentration of 10–5 mol·L–1 (Fig- ure 4b). The electronic spectrum of complex 1, also exhibits two low energy bands at ca. 609 and 675 nm at a concentration of 10–3 mol·L–1 (Figure 4c), which are assigned to the co- balt(II) ions d–d transitions in complex 1 and are similar to those for other reported cobalt(II) complexes.[20] Luminescence Properties Luminescent complexes are of great current interest due to the potential applications of visible light emitters in a number of technologically advanced fields.[21] The synthesis of metal- organic complexes by the judicious choice of conjugated or- ganic spacers and transition metal atoms can be an efficient method for obtaining new types of luminescence materials, es- pecially for d10 and the extended aromaticity of the polyhetero- substituded hexa- and pentaatomic ring system.[22] The luminescence spectra of the ligand L and complex 2 were recorded in the solid state at room temperature. As shown in Figure 5, complex 2 exhibits strong fluorescence with an emission maximum at 483 nm, whereas L exhibits strong fluo- rescence with an emission maximum at 498 nm. The emission is neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand- to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) because the ZnII ion is diffi- cult to oxidize or to reduce due to its d10 configuration and is thus not significantly contributive to the ligand-field effect when it is coordinated to a ligand.[22] Therefore, the emissions of 2 are preferably assigned to ligand-based π–π* and n–π* transitions rather than ligand metal charge transfer (LMCT).[24] Figure 5. Emission spectra of complex 2 and L at room temperature in the solid state. Conclusions The novel ligand L [L = 2-(1-phenyl-1H-tetrazol-5-ylsulfa- nylmenthyl)pyridine] was prepared under very mild conditions. In addition, three new complexes, [CoLCl2] (1), [ZnLCl2] (2), Co, Zn, and Cu Complexes with a Tetrazole-based Ligand and [Cu4L2(N3)8]n (3), in which the ligand L adopts either a chelating or bridging coordination mode, respectively, were prepared by conventional methods. When NaN3 is used as a second building block, complex 3, which displays a 2D frame- work compared with the mononuclear structures of complex 1 and 2, was obtained. Weak non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen-bonding, play key roles as crystal engineering tools because the supramolecular dimensionality of complex 1 and 2 is increased. Meanwhile, the electronic spectrum of complex 1 and the luminescent properties of complex 2 were also studied. Further efforts are focusing on the investigations of series of frameworks and different properties of complexes with tetrazole-based ligands and additional co-ligands. Experimental Section Caution! NaN3 and its metal complexes are potentially explosive. Only small amounts of materials should be cautiously handled. As complex 3 was explosive when we handled it, its properties were not further determined. Starting Materials and Physical Measurements: Solvents and rea- gents for syntheses were commercially available and were used as re- ceived. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were performed with a Model 240 Perkin–Elmer elemental analyzer. IR spectra were mea- sured with a Bruker Tensor 27 Spectrometer on KBr pellets in the region of 4000–400 cm–1. The melting points were determined with an X-4 digital melting-point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with a BRUKER AC-P500 Spectrometer in CDCl3 with TMS as internal standard, and chemical shift values (δ) were given in parts per million. Electronic spectra were obtained with a UV-3600 UV/Vis spectrometer at room temperature using dimethyl- formamide (DMF) as solvent. Emission spectra were taken with an F- 4500 spectrofluorometer.

All structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS program of the SHELXTL package and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods with SHELXL.[26] The metal atoms in each complex were located from the E-maps and other non-hydro- gen atoms were located in successive difference Fourier syntheses and refined with anisotropic thermal parameters on F2. The hydrogen atoms of the ligand were generated theoretically onto the specific atoms and refined isotropically with fixed thermal factors. Crystallo- graphic data and experimental details for structural analyses are sum- marized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4, respectively. Hydrogen bond lengths and bond angles of complex 1 are given in Table 5. Co, Zn, and Cu Complexes with a Tetrazole-based Ligand Table 5. Hydrogen bonds for complex 1.
