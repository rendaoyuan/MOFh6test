This is because the magnetic interaction between adjacent metal cations tends to abate while the porosity increases with increasing molecular length of the ligand.[2] In addition, the magnetism could also be affected by the coordination environment of the metal cations, including factors such as the coordination geometry and dimensions as well as the presence of oc- cluded guest molecules.[3] A subtle change in experimental kinetics, such as a change in reactant stoichiometry, tem- [a] State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Resource Utilization, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, Jilin 130022, P.

Furthermore, compound 1 shows a typical solvatomag- netic effect and its desolvated compound appears to be a hid- den weak ferromagnet with two field-induced magnetic tran- sitions. The structural variation between compounds 1 and 2 is ascribed to the different host–guest interactions within the two compounds and is believed to be responsible for the dif- ference in the magnetic properties. As a result of their iden- tical framework composition, compounds 1 and 2, after re- moval of the guest molecules, exhibited similar gas adsorp- tion behavior. perature, pH values, solvent, and so on, may exert dramatic effects on the assembly process in forming the MOF and thus causes variation in dimensionality, topology, and chemical and/or physical properties including magnetism.[4] In particular, the construction of magnetic frameworks with spontaneous magnetization, such as spin canting and meta- magnetic phase transitions, has been continuously pursued for their potential applications as sensing materials.[5] Since a pure 1D system cannot present long-range magnetic or- dering at T  0 K,[6] only interchain interactions can lead to ordering with spontaneous magnetization. Therefore, the “pillared-layer” motif is an important strategy to fulfil the coupling of magnetic ordering for the generation of 3D po- rous magnets while controlling their channel sizes. In ad- dition, as the conditions for noncompensating individual spin moment are difficult to achieve in homometallic sys- tems, synthesis of such 3D pillared layered compounds with blended magnetic features exhibiting both spin canting and metamagnetism is still a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of two 3D supramolecular isomeric compounds, [Co2(BDC)2(BPNO)]·H2BDC·2MeOH (1) and [Co2(BDC)2- (BPNO)]·2DMF (2) (BPNO = 4,4-bipyridyl N,N-dioxide, BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, DMF = N,N-di- methylformamide). Their magnetic and gas adsorption properties were investigated and correlated with their struc- tures. Their structural variation might be due to their dif- ferent host–guest interactions. Results and Discussion Compound 1 and 2 were prepared solvothermally by using similar starting materials and procedures but different D. Liu, Y. Liu, G. Xu, G. Li, Y. Yu, C. Wang SHORT COMMUNICATION solvents. The synthetic protocols are modified forms of that of our previously reported synthesis of Mn-based MIL- 53.[7] Typically, 1 was obtained by the reaction of Co- (NO3)2·6H2O, H2BDC, and BPNO in 1:1:1 mol ratio at 120 °C in MeOH, while 2 was synthesized in DMF. Both compounds are insoluble in common organic solvents. It was found that, when a mixture of DMF and MeOH was used, irrespective of the volume ratio of DMF to MeOH within our investigated range of 1 to 0.05, 2 was always the only product. We also used ethanol or propanol to replace MeOH in preparing 1. Tiny crystals, not suitable for single- crystal X-ray characterization, were obtained from the reac- tion systems with ethanol as solvent, even after varying the reaction conditions including the mol ratio of precursors and the reaction temperature. However, the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of 2 confirmed that its structure is sim- ilar to that of 1. On the other hand, no crystalline product could be obtained by using propanol as solvent. In ad- dition, the occluded guest molecules in compound 1, in- cluding H2BDC and MeOH, could be completely removed after heating the samples at 220 °C under high vacuum overnight followed by heating at reflux in DMF for about six hours to yield 1a. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that compounds 1 and 2 crystallize in the monoclinic C2/m and C2/c space group, respectively. These two compounds are built up from different infinite chains of corner-sharing CoO6 octahedra, and 2 is isostructural to Mn-based MIL- 53.[7] The connection modes for ligands BDC and BPNO are μ4-η1η1η1η1 (syn–syn coordination mode) and μ4-η2η2 (syn–syn coordination mode), respectively. For the CoO6 octahedra, four oxygen atoms come from the carboxylic groups of BDC while the remaining two come from BPNO. If the oxygen atoms are differentiated when taking the li- gands into consideration, a more appropriate form of the octahedra might be written as CoOB4ON2, in which super- scripts B and N correspond to BDC and BPNO, respec- tively. Therefore there are two isomeric CoOB4ON2, namely cis-CoOB4ON2 and trans-CoOB4ON2. In compound 1, higher symmetric trans-CoOB4ON2 is the only constituent to construct the infinite chains, in which the –Co–Co–Co– chains are linear (Figures 1a and 1b). The infinite chains are connected to two closest neighboring chains through BDC to form 2D Co–BDC layers in the ac plane. Along the b direction, the 2D layers are pillared by neutral BPDOs, which results in a 3D pillared layered framework containing two kinds of nanosized channels (Figure 1c and Figure S1, Supporting Information). The distorted hexago- nal channels along the a axis are 1D and have a limited channel size of 3.95.8 Å (Figure S2, Supporting Infor- mation). The larger rectangular channels are 2D and have dimensions of 9.86.9 Å when viewed along the a axis and 7.16.9 Å when viewed along the c axis. For 2, cis- and trans-CoOB4ON2 octahedra are alternatively joined to form the infinite chains. As a result of the incorporation of less symmetric cis-CoOB4ON2 into its cobalt oxide chains, the –Co–Co–Co– chains are no longer linear and appear to be zig-zag (Figures 1d and 1e). The interconnection between www.eurjic.org © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2012, 4413–4417 4414 the infinite chains and organic moieties lead to Co-based MIL-53 analogue containing 1D nanosized rhombic chan- nels running along the a axis as shown in Figure 1f. A sum- mary of crystallographic data for these two compounds is provided in Tables S1 and S2. Figure 1. Crystal structures of 1 and 2: the coordination environ- ments of the cobalt ions in 1 (a, b) and in 2 (d, e) (BDC ligands truncated for clarity); (c) 3D assembled system in 1 showing two kinds of channels along the a axis; the rectangular channel accom- modates one free H2BDC and two MeOH molecules, and the hex- agonal channel is empty; (f) 1D channel structure of 2 along the a axis occupied by DMF molecules (H atoms omitted for clarity). The encapsulated guests are different for 1 and 2. In 1, one BDC and two MeOH molecules were found to form two hydrogen-bonding cyclic dimers within the 2D channels (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Comparatively weaker hydrogen bonds of length 3.664 and 3.772 Å be- tween MeOH and BPNO were observed (Figure S4a, Sup- porting Information). Bearing this in mind, it is fairly easy to understand why either no crystals were obtained or only low-quality crystals could be synthesized by using ethanol or propanol: they would form hydrogen-bonding cyclic di- mers with higher steric hindrance. The guest molecule is DMF in 2. The encapsulated DMF molecules formed weak dimers[8] and had strong C–H···O hydrogen bonding with BPNO linkers of the framework (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). The strong hydrogen bonding helped to stabi- lize the structure of our Co-based MIL-53 as it would counteract the extra force exerted by the corrugated cobalt oxide chains due to the presence of cis-CoOB4ON2. It should be mentioned here that the π–π interaction among adjacent bi-μ2 BPNO ligands of 2, which spread throughout the whole crystal (Figure S5, Supporting Information), could be an advantage for decreasing the total energy of the crystal. This observation could be used to interpret the production of 2 in mixed solvent consisting of DMF and MeOH. As calculated by PLATON,[9] 15.2 and 36.2% of Two 3D Supramolecular Isomeric Mixed-Ligand CoII Frameworks the unit cells become accessible upon the removal of guest molecules for 1 and 2, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals that the guest molecules in 1 and 2 can be completely removed below 220 °C and 125 °C, respectively (Figure S6, Supporting In- formation). When 1 was heated at 220 °C under high vac- uum overnight and then heated at reflux in DMF for about six hours (to prepare 1a), we observed the loss of guest H2BDC and MeOH molecules. This was further confirmed by IR spectroscopy, as evidenced by the disappearance of the absorption peak around 1706 cm–1 for a protonated carb- oxylic group (Figure S7, Supporting Information), and by elemental analysis. Although it sustains loss of H2BDC and MeOH molecules, the 3D framework structure of 1a re- mains intact, as confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Magnetic properties for polycrystalline 1, 1a, and 2 were measured under an applied field of 1 kOe. As shown in Fig- ure 2a, the χmT value for 1 at 300 K was measured to be 5.721 cm3mol–1K, which is typical for an octahedral CoII complex. As the temperature decreases, χmT increases con- tinuously and then jumps up to a maximum value for an intradimer ferromagnetic coupling (the Weiss constant be- ing θ = +17.709 K, as obtained by a curve-fitting from 150 to 300 K), then rapidly decreases to 2 K, owing to weak interdimer antiferromagnetic interaction and/or zero-field splitting effects. To roughly estimate the magnetic interac- tion between CoII ions, a spin-only dimeric model of CoII is used with intradimer (J) and interchain interactions (zJ) (see the Supporting Information). The least-squares fit of the experimental data above 55 K for 1 leads to J = 14.29 cm–1, g = 2.49, zJ = –10.11 cm–1, and R = 6.2410–5. Furthermore, as shown in the inset of Fig- ure 2a, χm increases as the applied field decreases; this phe- nomenon could be due to spin canting. However, the χm value measured at 20 kOe does not show a maximum and tends to saturate at lower temperatures, indicating that the interlayer antiferromagnetic interaction is overcome by the external field. The divergence of the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and the field-cooled (FC) susceptibilities below about 8.0 K for 1 Figure 2.

KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 4415 indicates the irreversibility of the magnetization (Fig- ure S9a, Supporting Information). A critical temperature of about 6.5 K could be observed in the ZFC curve. This tem- perature was further estimated from the temperature depen- dence of the ac susceptibilities measured at frequencies 5, 50, and 100 Hz (Figure S9b, Supporting Information). The maximum of the real part (χm) observed at Tc = 6.5 K, in agreement with the above results, confirms the occurrence of a phase transition. However, the imaginary part (χm) presents a peak at 5.2 K, which is the signature of a mag- netized state, which also indicates that a partly canted anti- ferromagnetic structure exists below this temperature (Fig- ure S10, Supporting Information).[10] The isothermal magnetization of 1 at 2.0 K shows two obvious sigma transitions with increasing external fields (Figure 2b and Figure S11, Supporting Information). The magnetization displays a drastic rise at low field (H 10 kOe) and then increases at a slower rate in an almost linear fashion. The magnetization value of 3.89 Nβ at the highest field (50 kOe) is below the expected saturation value of 4.1–5.0 Nβ for two CoII ions in an octahedral environ- ment with Seff = 1/2 and g = 4.1–5.0,[11] but higher than that (2.1–2.5 Nβ) for an antiparallel arrangement of spins. The two field-induced magnetic transitions determined by the dM/dH derivative curve occur at about 0.018 and 12.1 kOe (Figure S12, Supporting Information). The iso- thermal magnetization shows a distorted sigmoidal curve at the first transition of 0.018 kOe, which is typical for a metamagnetic transition from the spin-canted antiferro- magnetic state to the ferromagnetic state. The second tran- sition, with a critical field of around 12.1 kOe, could be due to the occurrence of a field-induced magnetic phase transition from a ferromagnetic to a partially polarized state. A hysteresis loop was observed at 2 K with a coercive field (Hc) of 325 Oe and a remnant magnetization of 0.077 Nβ, as shown in the inset of Figure 2b. Taking all the above-mentioned aspects into account, it is concluded that 1 is a typical weak ferromagnet with two field-induced mag- netic transitions. As for 2, the magnetic behavior only shows an overall weak antiferromagnetic interaction be- tween the CoII ions (Figures S13–S18, Supporting Infor- D. Liu, Y. Liu, G. Xu, G. Li, Y. Yu, C. Wang SHORT COMMUNICATION mation). The difference in magnetic behavior between 1 and 2 can be explained on the basis of their corresponding structural frameworks. It is well known that the occurrence of spin canting is usually caused by single-ion magnetic an- isotropy and/or antisymmetric magnetic exchange. Al- though the double syn–syn carboxylate bridges dimer in 1 are centrosymmetric, there is no inversion center within the CoII–O chain. As for 2, the cobalt oxide infinite chains built up from alternative cis- and trans-CoOB4ON2 octahedra do have an inversion center within the infinite chains. Thus, spin canting can occur throughout the chain in 1.[12] The magnetic properties of desolvated 1a were also inves- tigated and found to differ dramatically from those of 1. Along with the decrease in temperature, the χmT decreases smoothly to a minimum at 65 K (with θ = –15.28 K), then increases abruptly to a rounded maximum, and finally de- creases more rapidly on further cooling (Figure S19, Sup- porting Information). The χm value of 1a is also dependent on the applied field at low temperatures; however, the mag- netic response of 1a arising from the competitive effect is much weaker than that of 1 under the same fields (Fig- ure S20, Supporting Information). Moreover, the real part (χm) of the alternating current magnetic susceptibility in 1a only has a maximum at 6.9 K, and the imaginary part (χm) is negligibly small (Figure S21, Supporting Infor- mation). The shape of the M–H plot of 1a at 2 K is similar to 1 (Figure S22, Supporting Information), but careful ex- amination reveals that only a very tiny detectable hysteresis loop can be observed. Thus, 1a is a hidden weak ferromag- net with two field-induced magnetic transitions. The signifi- cant solvatomagnetic effect described above, compared with those in [Co2(H0.67bdt)3]·20H2O,[13] could be also attributed to the suppression of antiferromagnetic superexchange be- tween adjacent cobalt oxide ferromagnetic chains by guest molecules in 1.[2a,3i] This could be supported by the dif- ferent shapes of the χmT vs. T curves and the different Weiss temperatures for 1 and 1a. We also studied the gas adsorption of the two desolvated compounds. As shown in Figure 3, the degree of N2 adsorp- tion (77 K) on 1a is only minimal, but higher amounts of CO2 (195 K) and H2 (77 K) are adsorbed, and both gases exhibit typical type-I isotherms. The amounts of CO2 and H2 adsorbed at 1.0 atm are 14 and 27 cm3g–1, respectively. It is noteworthy that the 2D channels along the a and c axes of 1 are larger than the kinetic diameter of N2. Ad- sorption of N2 on desolvated samples of 2 is also minimal, although the compound has larger 1D channels, and higher amounts of H2 are adsorbed under the same conditions (Figure S23, Supporting Information). This low adsorption of N2 on the desolvated samples might be due to the strong interaction between N2 and the pore windows at 77 K, which prevents N2 from penetrating into the pores. In fact, gas-selective adsorption by porous materials is not solely based on their pore size and shape but the “electronic fit” effect within the internal structure of the pore complex, as revealed by Kitagawa and co-workers.[14] The two supra- molecular isomers are identical in terms of framework com- position; therefore, their pores have close electronic nature www.eurjic.org © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2012, 4413–4417 4416 and thus show similar gas adsorption. In addition, the vapor sorption isotherms of 1a toward water, methanol, and toluene were also measured at 298 K (Figure S24, Sup- porting Information). Only water vapor was found to have strong affinity toward the internal surface of the pores, while only surface adsorption occurred for methanol and toluene, as revealed by their sorption profiles.

Conclusions In summary, two 3D supramolecular isomers were pre- pared by using similar starting materials and methods but different solvents. Structural analysis revealed that a weak host–guest interaction favored the formation of the 3D pil- lared layered framework of compound 1, while a stronger host–guest interaction helped to stabilize the structure of compound 2 by reducing the overall energy of the system. The energy difference between the two frameworks could be, at least partially, evidenced by the configurations of the constituent Co–O inorganic chains, which were linear and corrugated for compounds 1 and 2, respectively. In the lin- ear one the chains were composed of trans-CoOB4ON2 octa- hedra, while in the corrugated case the chains consisted of half trans- and half less symmetric cis-CoOB4ON2 octahedra connected alternatively. The two supramolecular isomers exhibited dramatically different magnetic properties due to the difference in the coordinative environment of Co and in the connection mode of the Co–O chains. Compound 1 is a typical weak ferromagnet with two field-induced magnetic transitions, while 2 displays antiferromagnetic interaction. Furthermore, compound 1 shows a solvatomagnetic effect, and desolvated compound 1a appears to be a hidden weak ferromagnet with two field-induced magnetic transitions. Due to their identical framework composition, compounds 1 and 2, after removal of the guest molecules, exhibit similar gas adsorption behavior. Experimental Section All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification except for pyridine N-oxide.

IR spectrum of the sample dispersed in KBr pellets was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR spectrometer (PE430). Elemental analysis was performed with a Pekin-Elmer 2400 elemental analyzer. Co was determined with a Leaman inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer. TG analysis was performed with a Perkin-Elmer TGA 7 instrument in flowing N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min-1. The hydrogen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm was obtained on a BET surface area analyzer (ASAP-2020). Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction: Suitable single crystals of 1 (0.27×0.12×0.09) and 2 (0.45×0.21×0.15) were collected on a Bruker Apex CCD area-detector diffractometer (MoKα, λ = 0.71073 Å) at a temperature of 296(2) K and 293(2) K, respectively. All intensity data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects, and empirical absorption corrections based on equivalent reflections were applied (SADABS). The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method on F2 with SHELXTL program package.S1 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. The H atoms were generated geometrically. Magnetic Measurements: The dc and ac magnetic susceptibilities of the powder sample were measured using a Quantum-Design MPMS-XL 7 SQUID magnetometer. For the dc measurements, the data were collected over the temperature range from 2 to 300 K, both after cooling in zero applied field (ZFC) under the measuring field 1 kOe (FC). The ac measurements were performed in an oscillating ac field of 3.0 Oe and a zero dc field. The oscillation frequencies were in the 5–1000 Hz range. The field dependence of the magnetization was measured at 2.0 K with changing the applied field up to 50 kOe. The diamagnetism of the sample and sample holder were taken into account. Magnetic Data Fitting: From the theoretical point of view, the quantitative description of the magnetic properties of CoII-containing complexes is not an easy task because of the relatively strong spin-orbit coupling of CoII. Usually axial distortion of the octahedral surrounding and anisotropic exchange make it more difficult. On the basis of the structural data, 1 was considered to be approximately a uniform rod-shaped infinite chain formed by the binuclear CoII units. There are two types of coupling pathway in 1: the intrachain cobalt atoms are linked by double tri-atom bridges (Co–O–C–O–Co) and the single atom µ-O bridge (Co–O–Co) with Co…Co distances of 3.583 Å and Co–O–Co bond angles of 117.554(2)°. Because of poor electronic transmission of σ-bonding carboxylates and larger interchain Co…Co distances, the interchain magnetic interaction is expected to be weaker than intrachain interaction. Therefore, for roughly estimating the magnetic interaction between CoII ions, we also attempted to simulate the magnetic behaviors of 1 with a simple model.S2 The spin-only Hamiltonian is H = -2J∑SiSi+1 (1) Then the theoretical expression of susceptibility is presented as: χdimer = 2 2 2 / 6 / 12 / 2 / 6 / 12 / 2 5 14 1 3 5 7 J kT J kT J kT J kT J kT J kT Ng e e e kT e e e       (2) and dimer ' 2 2 dimer 1 2 J / N g    (3) where J is the intradimer interaction parameter between the CoII ions, zJ' accounts for interchain interactions, N is Avogadro number, β is the Bohr magneton, g is Zeeman factor, and k is Boltzmann constant. The least-squares fit of the experimental data above 55 K leads to J = 14.29 cm-1, g = 2.49, zJ' = –10.11 cm-1, and R = 6.24 × 10-5. Table S1.

Figure S17. M versus H curve of 2 at 2 K. Figure S18. Temperature dependence of ac magnetic susceptibility for 2. The temperature dependence of χmT and χm values of complex 2 is displayed in Figure S13. The χmT value is 5.49 cm3mol–1K at 300 K, which is much higher than the spin-only to the theoretical spin-only value of 3.75 cm3mol–1K on the basis of two high-spin octahedral CoII ions (S = 3/2, g = 2.00). As the temperature decreases, χmT gradually decreases, reaching a value of 5.37 cm3mol–1K at 109 K. Upon further cooling, the χmT value abruptly decreases to a minimum value of 1.88 cm3mol–1K at 2.0 K. Magnetic studies show that complex 2 is a typical antiferromagnetic compound with the intrachain antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent CoII ions, even if a contribution from the spin-orbit coupling of CoII is also present. The susceptibility data above 80 K were well fitted to the Curie-Weiss law, with C = 5.688 cm3mol–1K and θ = –6.774 K (Figure S14). The negative θ value indicates an overall very weak antiferromagnetic interaction between the CoII ions. Field-cooled magnetic susceptibility at different fields (Figure S15) shows there is no peak in the plot. The field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetizations of 2 are identical and completely superimposed on each other (Figure S16), suggesting there is no spontaneous magnetization at 2 K. The magnetization versus field measurement (Figure S17) shows no steps and no hysteresis. Finally, the ac magnetic susceptibility (measured between 2 K and 25 K at 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 100 Hz and 1000 Hz) exhibited no peak in either the real part (χm') or imaginary part (χm'') curves (Figure S18).
