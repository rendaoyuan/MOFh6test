Ed. 2002, 41, No. 2 Infinite Secondary Building Units and Forbidden Catenation in Metal-Organic Frameworks** Nathaniel L. Rosi, Mohamed Eddaoudi, Jaheon Kim, Michael O×Keeffe, and Omar M. Yaghi* Catenation, in the form of interpenetrating and interweav- ing,[1] has been a major concern in the design of low-density (porous) structures due to the following widely held beliefs: a) the use of long links for the design of frameworks with large pores results in catenated structures and thus small pores, b) highly catenated frameworks typically have low porosity (20%), and c) catenation contributes negatively to the structural stability and porosity of open frameworks.[1, 2] We recently found in the chemistry of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that discrete secondary building units (SBUs) are important for designing structures with attributes that dis- prove the universality of b) and c); specifically, maximally interpenetrating MOFs have been shown to have highly porous (65%) structures, and interweaving in open frame- works has been recognized and used for the design of structures with reinforced walls and permanent porosity.[1c±d, 3] Herein, we introduce the use of infinite SBUs toward addressing the point presented in a). Specifically, we show that MOF-69A, [Zn3(OH)2(bpdc)2] ¥ 4DEF ¥ 2H2O (bpdc  4,4-bi- phenyldicarboxylate; DEF  N,N-diethylformamide), and its 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (ndc) analogue MOF-69B have three-dimensional (3D) structures constructed from infinite Zn-O-C SBUs and long bpdc or ndc links that expand the Al net in SrAl2 and provide a framework where catenation is forbidden. Infinite Zn-O-C SBUs were produced by subjecting reac- tion mixtures that typically give MOF-5 to increasing amounts of H2O2.[4] These solutions were monitored for the appear- ance of crystalline solids. A single-crystal X-ray diffraction study[5a] performed on a rodlike colorless crystal of MOF-69A delocalized electrons on the linkers between the chains, exhibit very low TN values (4 ± 10 K). The presence of these  electrons drastically enhances the magnetic characteristics of these solids above the strategic borderline of liquid nitrogen temperature. This renders porous solids magnetic with sufficiently high and available ordering temperatures which could now find applications, for example, in magnetic sorting.

Ed. 2002, 41, No. 2 ¹ WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2002 1433-7851/02/4102-0285 $ 17.50+.50/0 285 O- O -O O O- O bpdc ndc -O O revealed the presence of a 3D network that is constructed from columns of Zn-O-C units running along the [001] direction (Figure 1a). In the asymmetric unit there are three crystallographically unique Zn atoms that are bridged in a di- monodentate fashion by four carboxylate groups, each from a different bpdc link. The Zn atoms are also bound to two hydroxy groups to give two tetrahedral and one octahedral Zn centers arranged in a coplanar fashion. Assignment of the bridging oxygen atom as a 3-hydroxy group was confirmed by comparing the Zn-O(H)-Zn angles (93.7(3), 110.2(5), 110.3(5)) in MOF-69A to those typically found in the analogous molecular Zn complexes containing 3-hydroxy groups (103.3(1), 110.7(2), 112.2(2)), in which the angles are close to the expected tetrahedral geometry rather than the trigonal-planar one generally observed for 3-oxy groups.[6, 7] Interestingly, the Zn-O-C connectivity pattern observed in MOF-69A is identical to the one observed in the structure of discrete basic zinc crotonate, [Zn5(OH)2(O2CHCHCH3)8], in which similar 3-hydroxy groups are also present.[6b] The infinite Zn-O-C columns in MOF-69A are stacked in parallel and connected in the [110] direction by the biphenyl links to give one-dimensional (1D) rhombic channels of 12.2 ä along an edge and 16.6 ä along the diagonal[8] (Figure 1b) into which four DEF and two water molecules per formula unit reside as guests. Two DEF molecules were found hydrogen-bonded to 3-hydroxy groups (O ¥¥¥ H ¥¥¥ OC 2.81 ä for MOF-69A), while the remaining two DEF and two water guests are disordered in the crystal, an aspect that facilitates their liberation from the pores (vide infra). To fully appreciate the structure of MOF-69A and how its topology is a prototype for frameworks that will not catenate, it is instructive to connect all the points-of-extension (the carboxylate C atoms) in the structure. This gives a tetrahedral net with the C atoms at the vertices (Figure 1c). Closer examination of this net shows that the Zn-O-C columns become square ribbons, corresponding to the infinite SBUs, and the biphenyl units represent the lines that connect the SBUs together. This topology is identical to that of the Al net in SrAl2.[9] However, unlike SrAl2, MOF-69A has an open structure due to expansion of the Al net with ZnO links (within the SBUs) and C6H4C6H4 links (between the SBUs). Such an arrangement provides two important distances that impact catenation: a short distance between carboxylate C atoms along the [001] direction (5.839(3) ä and 6.237(3) ä), and a longer one in the [110] direction (between the SBUs) (10.069(4) ä). The first distance allows the long links to come closer together such that the phenyl rings of each bpdc linker have a torsion angle of 28.9(1) and, more signifi- cantly, form close mutual CH ¥¥¥  interac- tions (3.73 ä) to adjacent links resulting in an impenetrable wall of bpdc units (Fig- ure 1d). For this structure to catenate, an additional bpdc would have to fit between adjacent links which is metrically impossible and thus results in a structure that forbids catenation.[10] The implication of this finding is that linkers of longer lengths than bpdc and the same width (one benzene ring) can be employed in identical syntheses to produce the same framework but with correspond- ingly larger pores. As a first step in this direction, we have demonstrated that the infinite SBUs present in MOF-69A can be reproduced with ndc to give the isostructural compound formulated as [Zn3(OH)2- (ndc)2] ¥ 4DEF ¥ 2H2O (MOF-69B).[5b] Given that infinite SBUs heretofore have not been recognized and used in the context of design and construction of MOFs, we sought to probe the structural stability of MOF-69A and the mobility of the guests within its pores. Calculation of the pore Figure 1. The crystal structure of MOF-69A, [Zn3(OH)2(bpdc)2] ¥ 4DEF ¥ 2H2O, containing a) infinite Zn-O-C SBUs that are linked together by bpdc links to form b) a 3D network with large channels running along the [001] direction (as shown) where the four DEF and two water guests per formula unit reside. c) This framework has the topology of the Al net in SrAl2, which creates a structural arrangement where d) the walls of the channels are impenetrable as a result of close biphenyl ± biphenyl CH ¥¥¥  interactions leading to a structure motif that will not catenate regardless of the linker×s length. 15213773, 2002, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3773(20020118)41:2<284::AID-ANIE284>3.0.CO;2-M by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

Chem. Int. Ed. 2002, 41, No. 2 space in MOF-69A reveals that about 67% (66% for MOF- 69B) of the structure is occupied by guest molecules.[11] Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) performed on a sample of the as-synthesized MOF-69A showed one sharp weight loss of 37.1% in the range 25 ± 150C that continued slowly until 400C which is equivalent to the loss of four DEF and two water molecules per formula unit (calcd: 38.2%). For MOF- 69B, two distinct weight loss steps were observed: 21.2% in the range 40 ± 150C and an additional 19.1% in the range 150 ± 400C, which correspond to the consecutive loss of two DEF and two water (calcd: 21.7%), and two DEF (18.4%) molecules, respectively. Presumably, the latter weight loss is due to the two strongly hydrogen-bonded DEF guests in the crystal structure of MOF-69B. This was unobserved as a distinct weight loss in MOF-69A perhaps due to weaker hydrogen-bonded interactions. It appears that the hydrogen- bonded DEF molecules are crucial to the stability of MOF-69, as illustrated by a variable-temperature X-ray powder dif- fraction (XRPD) study performed on both MOF-69A or B between 50 and 300C in 50C increments. Comparison of the XRPD patterns at these temperatures to those of the as- synthesized samples of MOF-69A and B showed that MOF- 69A maintains its crystallinity up to 150C, while for MOF- 69B a more complex behavior is observed: a new phase begins to emerge at 150C, which results from the loss of the non- hydrogen-bonded DEF and water guests. The original phase can be regained by introduction of DEF into solids of MOF- 69B that have been heated up to 250C. For both MOF-69A and B heating above 150C and 250C, respectively, leads to an irreversible loss of crystallinity; specifically, attempts to regain crystallinity of the heated solids by reintroduction of DEF were unsuccessful, pointing to the importance of hydrogen-bonded DEF guests to the integrity of the structure. MOF-69A and B are quite stable to exchange of guests in solution. Immersion of as-synthesized samples into benzene, chloroform, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene, typi- cally overnight with three cycles of supernatant removal followed by fresh solvent addition, showed complete ex- change of DEF.[12] The exchange process does not result in destruction of the framework as evidenced by XRPD, where the exchanged solids showed sharp XRPD lines albeit some shifts of the lines from their original position were observed. Preliminary evidence suggests that the shifts can be related to slight contraction of the framework in the [100] direction accompanied by corresponding elongation in the [011] direction. Further work is underway to quantitatively charac- terize these distortions. Nevertheless, the exchange process is fully reversible in that reintroduction of DEF into the channels gives an XRPD pattern identical to that of the starting MOF-69 material. Encouraged by the solution ± guest exchange and thermal stability, we attempted to evaluate the rigidity of the MOF- 69A and MOF-69B frameworks. The samples were evacuated in a CAHN C1000 microbalance under reduced pressure (1  105 Torr) until no more weight loss was observed. The evacuated sample was exposed to different gas and organic vapor sorbates using published protocol.[13] No sorption of N2 or Ar was observed, possibly due to the flexibility of the framework. Nevertheless, we observed that benzene can be sorbed into the pores of MOF-69B: exposure of an evacuated sample to near saturated benzene vapor pressure (65.7 Torr) resulted in 1.04 benzene molecules sorbed per formula unit. We have demonstrated a strategy for realizing frameworks with large pores as exemplified by MOF-69 where a direct dependence is established between long links and the achievement of large pores, without the complications com- monly observed due to catenation. Consideration of infinite SBUs in MOF-69 as rods or cylinders points to establishing design strategies based on rod packing for the synthesis of mesoscopic MOFs.

[10] Other structures types such as the B net in CaB6 can be adapted to the same strategy. Here, linking octahedral SBUs with both short and long links, of the proper length ratio, that have been designed to lie along perpendicular planes would yield frameworks that do not catenate. This is well-represented in the structure of [Zn(4,4-bpy)2(SiF6)n]n ¥ xDMF (4,4-bpy  4,4-bipyridine: S. Subramanian, M. Zaworotko, Angew. Chem. 1995, 107, 2295 ± 2297; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.
