Ed. 1999, 38, No. 18 SMTP-1: The First Functionalized Metallo- porphyrin Molecular Sieves with Large Channels** Kuan-Jiuh Lin* In memory of Ta-shue Chou Zeolites have emerged as an exciting area of supramolec- ular chemistry. In particular, crystalline zeolites or zeotypes with uniform pore sizes of 10 ± 20  have diverse applications as catalysts, molecular sieves, and biosensors.[1±3] Recently, attention has turned toward organic and coordination zeolites to perform specific functions that are not available with inorganic zeolites. However, only a few examples of network structures with large cavities or channels have been demon- strated.[4] Moreover, the problems of fragility, acidity, and thermal stability of the host lattice have not been overcome.[5] Hence, the design and preparation of robust, air-stable, porous coordination zeolites provides a considerable chal- lenge in materials chemistry. We are exploring ways to construct new classes of coordination zeolites by hydrothermal synthesis,[6] a powerful technique often applied to the synthesis of zeolites. Encour- aged by our recent success in exploiting the symmetry and functionality of the dianionic squarate ligand C4O4 2ÿ as a robust and rigid tether for the construction under hydro- thermal conditions of coordination solids having open frame- works, we turned to the dianion tpyp (H2tpyp  5,10,15,20- tetrakis(4-pyridyl)porphyrin) as the molecular building block, as it has four equally spaced pyridyl groups linked to a porphyrin ring that gives it a rigid conformation. We surmised that the reaction of tpyp with a divalent first-row transition metal should yield a metalloporphyrinate material with nanometer-scale voids.[4c, 7] Porphyrin-based architectures have diverse potential applications as biomimetic models and as functional materials for the transport of energy, charge, molecules, and ions.[8] We synthesized one cobalt(ii) and two manganese(ii) porphyrinates, which we collectively named SMTP-1 (supra- molecular materials in Taiwan porphyrin, number 1), by employing hydro(solvent)thermal conditions. Crystals of all products were grown in a static autoclave at 2008C under autogenous pressure for 48 h. Most reactions yielded bunched aggregates of individual crystals, but single crystals large enough for X-ray diffraction studies were also obtained.[9] Crystalline SMTP-1 is stable in air and is insoluble in water.

The structure of SMTP-1 consists of a layered framework with large cavities (Figure 1). In each layer, the secondary building blocks consist of the cyclic metalloporphyrin hex- amer and spiropentamer.[10] Each metal center has local Figure 1.

The tpyp building block is engaged in a trans-m1,3 coordination mode. As is common in 5,10,15,20-tetraarylporphyrins, large dihedral angles between the planes of the pyridine rings and the porphyrin are observed (1108 for pyridine rings attached to metal centers, and 688 for the others). The compound SMTP-1 crystallizes in the rhombohedral space group R3Å and therefore lies around a crystallographic 3Å position. This represents the maximum D3d point group symmetry that can be attained by a [{M(tpyp)}6] species. Notable features of the SMTP-1 struc- ture are the hexameric cage, which has an extra-large cavity with an interior diameter of 20 , and the functional pyridine windows (Figure 2). Furthermore, owing to the natural tendency of p overlap in porphyrin molecules, adjacent layers are ªgluedº by noncovalent p ± p interactions, so that the cavities eclipse one another. This results in an infinite hexagonal channel along the crystallographic c axis (Fig- ure 1). As anticipated, the hexagonal channels have the dimensions of a/2  a/  3 p (17  20 ). The effective pore size of 13  16 [11] is comparable to that of the mineral phosphate cacoxenite.[12] Although the pendant pyridyl groups protrude into the window, this metalloporphyrinate has an extremely Figure 2. The hexameric cage has a polar cavity 17  20  across and 15  deep. a) ORTEP plot along the threefold c axis (50% probability ellipsoids). b) Skeletal representation in D3d point group symmetry. c) View perpendicular to the C3 axis.

The most intriguing feature of the SMTP-1 structure is the presence of the highly disordered solvent molecules trapped in the pores or channels. The pore solvent molecules could not be completely located in the structure analysis and are not discussed here. Further studies by other methods are required to characterize them. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals that the guest molecules are liberated below 2008C; however, the crystal lattice is thermally stable up to 4008C.[13] Moreover, powder X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the porous framework was retained after the loss of solvent molecules on heating the material at 2008C for 2 h, and even after immersion of the crystals in boiling crude oil for several hours. Given the structural and thermal stability of the SMTP-1 framework, three features of our new functional molecular sieve could potentially be exploited. The unusual windows with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties provide new possibilities for shape-selective molecular sieves. They can restrict the size and shape of molecules that are sorbed or desorbed, and large molecules may be flattened to pass through the window. Moreover, the extra-cage could provide space for the formation of bulky intermediates in a catalytic reaction, and the nitrogen atoms of the pendant pyridine rings might serve as coordination sites for intercalation.[14] This study suggests that a large family of metalloporphyrin- ate structures might exist that have yet to be synthesized. Some phases possessing unusual pore openings should be accessible by hydrothermal synthesis. Investigations of the organic-functionalized SMTP-1 as a shape-selective catalyst are in progress.[15] Experimental Section 1: A mixture of CoCl2 ´ 2H2O (0.2384 g), H2tpyp (0.1243 g), aqueous CsOH (0.3 mL, 50 wt%), CH3COOH (4 mL), and H2O (4 mL) was sealed in a 23- mLTeflon-lined stainless autoclave, heated to 2008C for 48 h, and cooled to 708C at 9Khÿ1.
