Singh-Wilmot,*[b] Christopher L. Cahill,[c] Michael Andrews,[c] and Richard Taylor[a] Keywords: Metal-organic frameworks / Lanthanides / Luminescence / Isoreticular synthesis Five isoreticular lanthanide (Ln) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) – Er(bdc)(HCOO) (1a), Dy(bdc)(HCOO) (1b), Tb(bpdc)(HCOO) (2a), Gd(bpdc)(HCOO) (2b) and Tb(bpydc)(HCOO) (3) (bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, bpdc = 4,4-biphenyldicarboxylate and bpydc = 2,2-bipyr- idine-5,5-dicarboxylate) – were synthesized under solvo- thermal conditions. The complexes were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, elemental analyses, infrared spec- troscopy and single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Each LnIII ion is eight-coordinated and forms a binuclear pseudo-pad- dlewheel secondary building unit (SBU), [Ln2(CO2)2(CO2)2]. The SBUs are interconnected into 2D Ln–carboxylate nets, Introduction The synthesis and characterization of metal-organic frameworks and coordination polymers based on lantha- nide(III) ions (LnMOFs) has attracted much attention re- cently.[1] This interest lies in the promise of new functional materials that take the unique opto-electronic and magnetic properties of LnIII ions and combine them with the well- defined network connectivities of MOFs. With 14 4f ele- ments (Ce–Lu), there are numerous possibilities for tailor- ing tunable MOFs not only by varying the network connec- tivity and bridging ligands but also by careful choice of LnIII ions in the nodes. For example, luminescent MOFs based on TbIII or EuIII [1h–1r] and magnetic MOFs based on DyIII or GdIII [1p–1r,2] have been synthesized. LnMOFs are therefore promising for the development of materials with tunable properties for solid-state lighting, sensing, separa- tion, catalysis, communication and imaging to name a few.

KGaA, Weinheim 4419 which act as tertiary building units (TBUs) that are linked by the rigid organic linkers to form 3D pillared frameworks. Preliminary luminescence studies reveal that energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ trace impurities is active in crystals of 2a and 3 and contributes to interesting temperature-dependent photoluminescence. At 298 K, under UV excitation, 2a is lilac and 3 glows bright red, whereas at 77 K both 2a and 3 emit green light. Together with the previously published Tb(bdc)(HCOO), Eu(bdc)(HCOO), Gd(bdc)(HCOO) and Ln(bpedc)(HCOO) (bpedc = biphenylethene-4,4-dicarboxyl- ate), these complexes form the first examples of isoreticular LnMOFs. The conceptual approach to the design and assembly of targeted MOFs is called reticular synthesis. It involves the linking of simple, structure-directing, geometric figures called secondary building units (SBUs) by organic linkers or struts into the desired framework topology. However, al- though reticular synthesis has explained the assembly of predesigned transition-metal MOFs in a logical and simple way,[3] the discovery of LnMOFs is still largely an inexact, discovery-based science. This is due to the stability of LnIII ions in a variety of high-coordination geometries and the absence of crystal-field effects, which leads to spherical geo- metries.[4] So although numerous studies show the relation- ship between structure and properties in a variety of LnMOFs,[3g,5] many more examples are needed to highlight useful trends and derive the principles that can instruct the tailoring of targeted frameworks. In studies so far, multifunctional carboxylates such as 1,4-benzenedicarbox- ylate (bdc)[1b,1m,1p,6] and 4,4-biphenyldicarboxylate (bpdc)[1m,1p,7] are very popular because they display mul- tiple coordination modes, form stable complexes with LnIII ions and display π-stacking effects that help to direct the formation of well-defined structures. Recently, a number of LnMOF papers have reported structures that contain the formate ion (HCOO–),[5g,8] the smallest carboxylate. In these LnMOFs, the formate (HCOO–) is generated in situ from the hydrolysis of DMF under solvothermal condi- tions. Deng et al.[8b] recently reported LnIII ions bridged by in situ formates into 2D covalent nets, which arrange into different 3D frameworks under different conditions. The M. A. Singh-Wilmot et al. FULL PAPER 2D covalent nets are built up from SBUs that feature two formates and two carboxylates [Ln2(CO2)2- (CO2)2] and that subsequently arrange into 3D frameworks by coordination with biphenylethene-4,4-dicarboxylate (bpedc). Even more recently, Huang et al.[8c] reported an- other example of the same 2D Ln carboxylate covalent net pillared by bdc. Indeed, there are many more examples of 3D LnMOFs built up from stable, recurring 1D or 2D infi- nite layers or extended building units.[1r,5g,8d,8e,9] Such ex- tended entities might be critical in the application of isoret- icular synthesis to LnMOFs since they can direct the self- assembly of the MOF by directionally limiting the points of extension available to the organic strut. We propose call- ing them tertiary building units (TBUs) because they are made up solely of interconnected SBUs. For example, the sharing of vertices of SBUs creates a metal–carboxylate TBU chain or sheet, which can then be linked into MOFs with various organic linkers. In this contribution we consider the Ln–carboxylate layer of Deng et al.[8b] and Huang et al.[8c] to be a TBU, which can be generated by a deliberate introduction of formic acid and can then be linked into a family of related phenylcarb- oxylate MOFs with 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2bdc), 4,4-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (H2bpdc), 2,2-bipyridine- 5,5-dicarboxylic acid (H2bpydc) and biphenylethene-4,4- dicarboxylic acid (H2bpedc). Herein we report the syntheses and structures of five new 3D pillared frameworks, Er(bdc)(HCOO) (1a), Dy(bdc)(HCOO) (1b), Tb(bpdc)- Table 1.

Taken together with Ln(bpedc)(HCOO),[2] this represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first exam- ple of a family of isoreticular LnMOFs. Results and Discussion Synthesis and Structure of Compounds Huang et al.[8c] recently reported the synthesis and struc- ture of Tb(bdc)(HCOO) (1c) and Eu(bdc)(HCOO) (1d) (see the Supporting Information). That method involves in situ generation of formate from the hydrolysis of DMF. In this report we deliberately introduce formate as formic acid and report the structure of Er(bdc)(HCOO) (1a) and Dy(bdc)(HCOO) (1b). Compounds in the series 1, 2 and 3 are isoreticular with the molecular formula Ln(HCOO)(L), in which L is a rigid aromatic linker (bdc in series 1, bpdc in series 2 and bpydc in compound 3). IR and elemental analyses data support the structures determined by single-crystal X-ray crystal- lography, whereas powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; Fig- ures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information) patterns confirm that the compounds have been successfully ob- tained as pure crystalline phases. Crystal structures are pre- sented for 1a, 2a and 3. Crystal refinement data are pre- sented in Table 1, whereas Tables 2, 3 and 4 show select bond angles and lengths for the three structures.

FULL PAPER The asymmetric units consist of one Ln3+ ion, one for- mate ion and one dianion rigid linker L (Figure 1, a, b and c). Each Ln3+ ion assumes a distorted trigonal dodecahe- dron coordination polyhedron by coordinating to eight oxy- gen atoms (Figure 2, a); four from three separate formates and four from four different rigid linkers L (Figure 2, b). Each formate chelates to one Ln3+ ion and bridges two others in a planar μ3:η4 binding mode, whereas each L co- ordinates to four Ln3+ ions in a μ4:η4 mode with two bridg- ing monodentate carboxylate groups at each end. This co- ordination leads to a binuclear pseudo-paddlewheel SBU (Figure 2, c), which, as previously reported by Dai et al.,[8e] consists of two Ln3+ ions linked by two bridging/chelating formates into a four-sided Ln2O2 ring with two carboxylate groups from L capping this dimeric core and forming an octagonal Ln2C2O4 ring. Within this unit, intra-SBU Ln– Ln distances range from 3.8827(3) Å in 1a to 3.9384(4) Å Figure 3. (a) View along the a axis showing interconnected SBUs forming a 2D TBU layer.

These distances are consistent with the intra-SBU distance of 3.9405(7) Å observed by Deng et al. for Ln(bpedc)(HCOO) (bpedc = biphenyl- ethene-4,4-dicarboxylate),[8b] a previously reported struc- ture in this isoreticular series. The Ln–OF (subscript F de- notes oxygen atoms from formate) bond lengths range from 2.322(2) to 2.518(2) Å in 1a, 2.371(3) to 2.591(3) Å in 2a and 2.364(3) to 2.571(3) Å in 3. Ln–OL (subscript L denotes oxygen atoms from L) bond lengths are, as expected, shorter than Ln–OF bond lengths and range from 2.228(3) to 2.299(2) Å in 1a, 2.265(3) to 2.332(3) Å in 2a and 2.272(3) to 2.340(3) Å in 3. The average O–C–OF bond an- gle is 120.73°, whereas the average O–C–OL bond angle is 123.86° at one end and 125.48° at the other. SBUs are linked by sharing two oxygen atoms from two distinct formates into an infinite 2D brick wall layer along the bc plane (Figure 3, a and b). We call these recurring Isoreticular Lanthanide MOFs brick wall layers tertiary building units (TBUs) since they are made up solely from the interconnection of SBUs. Each TBU therefore comprises a 2D metal–formate layer (Fig- ure S3 in the Supporting Information) and a perpendicular metal–carboxylate net with SrAl2 topology (Schläfli symbol 4·6·4·6·62·82) (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) formed from the continuous linkage of the Ln2C2O4 rings. This arrangement results in the TBU layers being pillared by rigid linkers L into complex 3D frameworks (Figure 3, c and d). Each linker caps an SBU at one end and bridges two SBUs at the other (Figure 4, a, b and c). Within the TBU, SBUs are evenly separated by Ln–Ln distances of 4.528(1) Å in 1a, 4.654(3) Å in 2a and 4.625(5) Å in 3. Be- tween the TBU layers, Ln–Ln distances are 10.601(3) Å in 1a, 14.744(1) Å in 2a, 14.586(2) Å in 3 (Figure 4, a, b and c) and 17.106(3) Å in Tb(HCOO)(bpedc).[8b] These are the first examples of isoreticular LnMOFs, and the Ln–carb- oxylate layer featured in them is evidence that LnIII ions can form stable and recurring TBUs that can be exploited in the rational design and synthesis of MOFs with tunabil- ity in both structure and properties. For example, inter- TBU Ln–Ln distances can be controlled by the choice of the linker and has implications for tuning LnIII–LnIII inter- actions[10] within the MOFs. Figure 4.

Luminescence Spectroscopy The solid-state luminescence properties of Tb(bdc)(HCOO) (1c), Tb(bpdc)(HCOO) (2a) and Tb(bpydc)(HCOO) (3) were investigated. Tb(bdc)(HCOO) (1c) emits intense green light after excitation into the ligand excitation band at 310 nm. The emission profile (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) is characteristic of sensi- tized Tb3+ (5D4  7FJ) (J = 6–3) and was previously report- ed.[8c] Emission from Tb(bpdc)(HCOO) (2a) after excitation at 350 nm is weakly lilac (Figure 5, a). The emission spec- trum (Figure 6, b) is dominated by strong ligand emission (λmax = 405 nm), and also features Tb3+(5D4  7FJ) and Eu3+(5D0  7FJ) bands. At 77 K the emission from 2a is green (Figure 5, b); Tb3+(5D4  7FJ) (J = 6, 5) emission dominates, ligand emission is partially quenched and Eu3+(5D0) emission is fully quenched (Figure 6, d).

KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 4423 citation spectra at both 298 and 77 K (Figure 6, a, c), ob- tained when λem = 614 nm, feature a broad ligand excitation band as well as sharp, direct Tb3+ absorptions. Figure 5. Temperature-dependent emission from 2a and 3 under UV excitation. (a) Lilac emission from 2a at 298 K, (b) green emis- sion from 2a at 77 K, (c) red-orange emission from 3 at 298 K and (d) green emission from 3 at 77 K. The photoluminescence of Tb(bpydc)(HCOO) (3) is even more exciting; at 298 K, after excitation at 350 nm, crystals of 3 emit intense red-orange light, but at 77 K the emission is green (Figure 5, c, d). The emission spectra (Figure 7, b, d) show both Tb3+(5D4  7FJ) and Eu3+(5D0  7FJ) transi- tions at both temperatures. However, at 298 K Eu3+(5D0  7F2) dominate the spectrum and there is significant presence of 5D0  7F3 at 651 nm and 5D0  7F4 at 697 nm. At 77 K, the Tb3+(5D4  7FJ) (J = 6, 5) peaks at 487 and 541 nm increase in intensity, whereas Eu3+ peaks are suppressed. In addition, the ligand emission that was present at 298 K is totally quenched. The excitation spectra at 298 and 77 K (Figure 7, a, c), λem = 614 nm, feature a broad ligand exci- tation band with weak direct Tb3+ excitation peaks. The profile is the same when λem = 697 nm (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). Furthermore, excitation into Tb3+(5D4  7F6) at 488 nm results in emission from Tb3+(5D4) as well as the Eu3+(5D0) state (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). Since the compounds were made with Tb4O7, the presence of Eu3+ in 2a and 3 might seem curious. However, Eu3+ impurities could originate from trace amounts in the 99.9% Tb4O7 used in the prepara- tion.[11] Indeed, neutron activation analysis (NAA) shows that 2a contains 0.00034% Eu3+, whereas 3 contains 0.15% Eu3+. The photoluminescence is also consistent with the behaviour of crystals obtained when 1% Eu3+ is deliber- ately introduced into 3 during the synthesis. These results indicate that whereas Tb3+(5D4) is being sensitized by li- gand-to-metal energy transfer, Eu3+(5D0) is strongly sensi- tized by ligand-to-metal as well as Tb3+-to-Eu3+ energy transfer, and this is responsible for the temperature-depend- ent emission observed in 3.[12] Nonresonant energy-transfer pathways such as Tb3+(5D4) + Eu3+(7F0) + ΔE1  Tb3+(7F4) + Eu3+(5D0) or Tb3+(5D4) + Eu3+(7F1)  Tb3+(7F4) + Eu3+(5D0) + ΔE2 are possibly involved.[13] However, luminescence decay dynamics of samples with varying fractional concentrations of Eu3+ and Tb3+, includ- ing temperature-evolution studies, are needed to elucidate the exact energy-transfer mechanism. These studies are in progress. M. A. Singh-Wilmot et al. FULL PAPER Figure 6. Excitation (λem = 614 nm) and emission (λex = 350 nm) spectra of Tb(bpdc)(HCOO) (2a) at 298 K (a and b) and 77 K (c and d). Figure 7. Excitation (λem = 614 nm) and emission (λex = 350 nm) spectra of Tb(bpydc)(HCOO) (3) at 298 K (a and b) and 77 K (c and d). Conclusion Five new 3D pillared LnMOFs, Er(bdc)(HCOO) (1a), Dy(bdc)(HCOO) (1b), Tb(bpdc)(HCOO) (2a), Gd(bpdc)(HCOO) (2b) and Tb(bpydc)(HCOO) (3) are re- ported. In preliminary experiments, Eu3+ impurities in crys- tals of 2a and 3 led to intriguing, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, which arose from efficient ligand-to- Eu3+ and nonresonant Tb3+-to-Eu3+ energy transfer. A de- tailed study of the temperature and concentration evolution of luminescence and decay dynamics is being conducted to determine the exact mechanism of energy transfer and to assess the potential of the mixed-lanthanide analogues to act as luminescent thermometers. Along with Tb(bdc)(HCOO) (1c), Eu(bdc)(HCOO) (1d), Gd(bdc)- (HCOO)[8c] and Ln(bpedc)(HCOO),[8b] which were pre- www.eurjic.org © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2012, 4419–4426 4424 viously reported, these constitute the first family of isoretic- ular LnMOFs. The 2D Ln–carboxylate net featured in series 1, 2 and 3 can be efficiently generated by in situ hy- drolysis of DMF or the deliberate introduction of formate as formic acid. It is considered a TBU, since it is built up solely from the interconnection of Ln2(CO2)2(CO2)2 SBUs and can form a variety of LnMOFs by careful selection of rigid linkers. Although more examples are needed to de- velop this concept, TBUs might be a critical design param- eter in the application of reticular synthesis to LnMOFs. Experimental Section Materials and Measurements: Lanthanide nitrates were prepared by neutralizing lanthanide oxides with 3 m nitric acid. All other rea- gents used are commercially available and were used as received. Isoreticular Lanthanide MOFs All C, H and N elemental analyses were carried out with a Perkin– Elmer Series II CHNS/O Analyzer 2400 at the University of the West Indies (U.W.I.) Mona Campus for all compounds except com- pounds 1a and 1b, which were carried out by Medac Ltd. Infrared analyses were carried out with a Bruker Tensor 37 FTIR spectrom- eter. Powder X-ray diffraction was carried out with a Bruker D5005 X-ray diffractometer using DIFFRAC plus and XRD Commander, v. 2.3.1. Single-crystal diffraction data for 1a were collected at the George Washington University with a Bruker SMART diffractometer with an APEXII CCD detector. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for 2a and 3 were collected with a Bruker AXS, P-4 diffractometer with XSCANS, and the crystal structures were solved and refined using the SHELXTL V5.1 package at the University of the West Indies Mona. Excitation and emission spectra were recorded with a Yvon Jobin FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer (wavelength accuracy and repeat- ability 0.5 and 0.3 nm, respectively, and signal-to-background noise ratio of 2000:1) interfaced to a 200 MHz computer by means of the Datamax version 2.2 software. Slit widths were ad- justed to simultaneously give the highest resolution and signal-to- noise ratio. Spectra were recorded after sealing the samples in 4 mm glass tubes and placing them in a 50 cm3 finger-type quartz EPR Dewar. Liquid nitrogen was added to the Dewar for 77 K measure- ments. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) was performed on solid sam- ples (for 2a and 3) with the SLOWPOKE-2 reactor at the Inter- national Center for Environmental and Nuclear Sciences (ICENS).[14] The improved relative comparative method[15] was used for quantification. All measurements were performed with an Ortec GEM70 plus (high-purity germanium) coaxial gamma pho- ton detector system, with a measured efficiency of 71%, resolution of 1.9 keV and peak-to-Compton ratio of 75:1. The Eu-152m iso- tope with gamma ray energy of 121.8 keV and half-life of 9.5 h was used to determine the total concentration Eu in the sample.
