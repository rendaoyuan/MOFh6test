Manuscript & Metal–Organic Frameworks Mechanical Downsizing of a Gadolinium(III)-based Metal–Organic Framework for Anticancer Drug Delivery Tanay Kundu,[a] Shouvik Mitra,[b] Prasun Patra,[b] Arunava Goswami,[b] David Daz Daz,[c] and Rahul Banerjee*[a] Abstract: A GdIII-based porous metal–organic framework (MOF), Gd-pDBI, has been synthesized using fluorescent linker pDBI (pDBI=(1,4-bis(5-carboxy-1H-benzimidazole-2- yl)benzene)), resulting in a three-dimensional interpenetrat- ed structure with a one-dimensional open channel (1.9 1.2 nm) filled with hydrogen-bonded water assemblies. Gd- pDBI exhibits high thermal stability, porosity, excellent water stability, along with organic-solvent and mild acid and base stability with retention of crystallinity. Gd-pDBI was trans- formed to the nanoscale regime (ca. 140 nm) by mechanical grinding to yield MG-Gd-pDBI with excellent water dispersi- bility (>90 min), maintaining its porosity and crystallinity. In vitro and in vivo studies on MG-Gd-pDBI revealed its low blood toxicity and highest drug loading (12 wt%) of anti- cancer drug doxorubicin in MOFs reported to date with pH- responsive cancer-cell-specific drug release. Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)[1] have established their effi- cacy in many challenging applications, such as sorption and separation,[2] catalysis,[3] and conductivity.[4] However, very limit- ed progress has been made in the field of drug delivery utiliz- ing MOFs.[5] It is noteworthy that several other porous materi- als, such as liposomes, mesoporous silica, and lipid and poly- mer-based nanocarriers[6] have been developed as a drug deliv- ery system (DDS). However, many of the host materials have inherent limitations (for example, a lack of stability in aqueous media, poor solubility, low drug loading capability, large di- mension, and high surface charge) to becoming a successful DDS.[7] In this respect, MOFs could be advantageous over other classical porous materials owing to their diverse architectures and tunable porosity, along with modifiable framework func- tionality. Moreover, in a MOF-based DDS, the drug payload and release could be controlled by changing the ligand length or the connectivity and functionality.[8] Nevertheless, MOF based DDS suffer a few drawbacks which require serious attention. These are: 1) the cytotoxicity of the MOF backbone; 2) instabil- ity of MOFs under physiological conditions; and 3) difficulty of loading large-sized drugs owing to inadequate pore size and accessibility of the framework voids. Only a few FeIII- and ZrIV- based terephthalate/trimesate MOFs (for example, Fe-MILs, UiO-66)[5a,b] can surpass these criteria to some extent. The problems become severe in the case of doxorubicin hydrochlo- ride (DOX), having kinetic diameter of about 1.51.00.7 nm. DOX is one among the most commonly prescribed anticancer drugs and is currently administered through intravenous injec- tion, which often causes secondary effects owing to cytotoxici- ty.[9] Therefore, efficient DDS for DOX are in high demand, which should ideally: 1) be non-toxic; 2) be injectable intrave- nously (with an effective diameter 200 nm);[7] 3) enhance the pharmacological properties of DOX; 4) bear a high DOX pay- load; and 5) be capable of releasing DOX in a controlled and site specific manner. To date, only two MOFs have been report- ed (that is, Fe-MIL-100[5a] and ZIF-8[10]) that exhibit a limited DOX loading efficiency (ca. 9 wt% and 5 wt%, respectively). Herein, we present a GdIII-based MOF, Gd-pDBI (pDBI= (1,4-bis(5-carboxy-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)benzene; Figure 1),[11] having a large pore (ca. 1.91.2 nm), as a potential DDS to overcome some of the aforementioned limitations. For the first time, the mechanical grinding route is presented to downsize large Gd-pDBI crystals (ca. 0.5 mm to 120 nm) for intravenous injection with good aqueous dispersibility. Gd-pDBI has proven to be a biocompatible nanocarrier for the controlled release of DOX. GdIII-based MOFs have been known to be thermochemi- cally stable owing to a high charge (3+) and high coordination number (9) of the Gd3+ cation. To date, GdIII-based MOFs have been investigated mostly for multimodal imaging.[12] These MOFs have been synthesized in the nanoscale regime by sur- factant-assisted microemulsion technique, using a large quanti- ty of harmful organic solvents. In contrast, mechanical grind- [a] T. Kundu, Dr. R.

KGaA, Weinheim 10514 Full Paper DOI: 10.1002/chem.201402244 ing[13] can impart added time efficiency owing to the ease of ambient temperature methodology, excluding toxic solvents during synthesis. Moreover, nanocrystals of desired size (pref- erably <200 nm) can be directly obtained for biomedically rel- evant applications,[7] an advantage demonstrated for the first time through our detailed investigations. We deliberately chose pDBI as a multifaceted linker for the Gd-pDBI synthesis. pDBI possesses a rotatable backbone that creates diverse binding angles (1808 for the elongated rotamer (1.95 nm) and 1508 for the bent rotamer (1.90 nm)) by rotation along the central benzene ring (Figure 1). Furthermore, two benzimidazole functionalities, apart from carboxylate moieties per linker, may act as H-bonding donor and acceptor sites, which can facilitate the formation of polar voids for the ad- sorption of hydrophilic drugs. Moreover, pDBI bears an elon- gated and conjugated backbone with intrinsic fluorescence property, which can be monitored for drug loading efficacy. In particular, the larger dimension of pDBI with respect to DOX motivated us to envisage the possibility of constructing a robust as well as porous Gd-pDBI for DOX delivery. Gd-pDBI crystallizes in the P2/c space group. The asymmetric unit contains one nine-coordinated GdIII, 3/2 pDBI ligand, one coordinated water and one DMF molecule, and twelve lattice water molecules. Interestingly, both the rotamers of pDBI con- tribute in the construction of the framework backbone. Each GdIII center is chelated by three carboxylate groups to form a Gd2(COO)6(H2O)2(C3H7O)2 dimer, where one elongated rota- mer bridges two dimers and the other two bent rotamers extend the framework. This results in a 3D architecture con- taining 1D open channels along the crystallographic a-axis (Figure 1). All of the benzimidazole moieties of the pDBI linker construct the wall of the cylindrical channels, providing a hy- drophilic environment. The non-interpenetrated framework was expected to form a 4.42.2 nm pore aperture (Supporting Information, Figure S4), which diminishes to 1.91.2 nm upon three-fold interpenetration. Twelve water molecules per asym- metric unit of Gd-pDBI constitute a complex hydrogen bonded assembly inside the tubular pore (Supporting Information, Fig- ure S6). Furthermore, the water molecules are further hydro- gen bonded with the benzimidazole moieties of the ligand backbone (N3···O18, 2.821(3) , N5···O12, 3.009(1) ).[14] Al- though water assemblies play a vital role in stabilizing the con- formation of soft materials (for example, proteins and biopoly- mers), such water assemblies were less-often reported within synthetic crystalline hosts and are particularly rare in MOFs.[15] This is because high-boiling solvents (for example, DMF, DMA, DEF, DMSO) used for synthesizing a majority of MOFs usually occupy the hydrophobic pore cavity instead of water. This in- teresting structural attribute of Gd-pDBI with a porous hydro- philic cavity encouraged us to attempt this MOF as DDS. Single crystals of as-synthesized Gd-pDBI were millimeter- sized and grown in H2O/DMF medium at 1108C for 72 h. As- synthesized Gd-pDBI (where pores are blocked by the solvent water molecules) underwent rapid precipitation in aqueous medium (Figure 2a). To produce a stable dispersion in terms of biological perspectives, we have used the simple mechanical grinding route to produce nanosized MG-Gd-pDBI. Interesting- ly, these materials maintain their structural integrity, crystallini- ty, and porosity in the nano regime, as demonstrated by PXRD, FTIR spectroscopy, and water sorption measurements. The aqueous dispersion was stable for more than 90 min after soni- cation. Moreover, excellent dispersion was obtained in a variety of solvents, including EtOH, and DMF. 120 nm-sized rod- shaped nanocrystals of MG-Gd-pDBI were characterized by TEM imaging, which was consistent with a hydrodynamic radius of 140 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S7). To date, reported nanosized MOFs are formed largely by the microe- mulsion technique[16] on a milligram scale using a bulk amount Figure 2. a) Millimeter-sized Gd-pDBI (left) was mechanically ground to form nanosized MG-Gd-pDBI (right).

Herein, we have demonstrated a simple yet effective method of producing MOF nanocrystals by the postsynthetic mechanical grinding route. UV/Vis absorbance spectra of aqueous dispersion of MG-Gd-pDBI showed a dif- fused peak centered at 347 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) meas- urements at different excitation wavelengths (l=300-380 nm) confirm maximum PL intensity at the l=340 nm excitation wavelength, while emission maxima was centered at 412 nm, giving rise to a blue fluorescence (Supporting Information, Fig- ure S16). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) performed on as-synthe- sized Gd-pDBI revealed a thermal stability up to about 4008C (Supporting Information, Figure S10). A gradual weight-loss step of 20% within the temperature range of 40–1008C was also observed, which corresponded to the escape of guest water molecules from the pores (12H2O; calcd 21%). During water evaporation, the framework remained intact, as demon- strated by VTPXRD experiments (Supporting Information, Fig- ure S9). As-synthesized Gd-pDBI exhibited chemical stability to- wards most common solvents (for example, H2O, DMF, DMSO, EtOH, MeOH, acetone, CHCl3), as evident from the powder XRD pattern compared to as-synthesized sample. Gd-pDBI was stable up to 72 h in boiling water and boiling methanol. Fur- thermore, it exhibited moderate acid (3n AcOH, 1n HCl) and base stability (0.1n NaOH) at RT for 24 h (Figure 2c). This high chemical stability of Gd-pDBI is presumed to have resulted from coordinatively saturated GdIII centers with high binding energy of the GdO bond. Surprisingly, Gd-pDBI does not show N2 adsorption upon thermal activation. Even supercritical CO2 activation fails to access the inner porosity of the Gd-pDBI. As a result, we have used water sorption isotherm as a mea- surement of the accessible pore space of Gd-pDBI materials. Gd-pDBI showed about 15 wt% water vapor uptake, while MG-Gd-pDBI exhibited 25 wt% in relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.9 at STP (Figure 2d). Higher water uptake in MG-Gd-pDBI signi- fies greater surface exposure and finally leads to higher drug payload than its non-grinded counterpart, which we have dis- cussed below. We have performed the loading of DOX in all type of Gd- pDBI materials. The as-synthesized Gd-pDBI showed negligible DOX uptake. This observation rules out the surface and inter- crystallite adsorption of DOX molecules. Gd-pDBI and MG-Gd- pDBI were capable of executing moderate drug loading effi- ciency. MG-Gd-pDBI showed increase in drug loading capacity over Gd-pDBI owing to enhanced surface exposure towards DOX upon mechanical grinding. A successful absorbance (Fig- ure 3a) and fluorescence quenching of DOX, along with change in color of Gd-pDBI (pale yellowish to purple) was ob- served after the DOX loading. Appearance of a characteristic peak of DOX in solid-state UV (maxima at 500 nm) and IR spec- tra (nNH 3442, nCO 1631 cm1)[10] of DOX loaded Gd-pDBI un- equivocally confirmed the successful loading of DOX within the porous framework, which supports the TGA and EDX analy- sis (Supporting Information, Section S7). The DOX@MG-Gd- pDBI shows a 20% reduction in pore accessibility towards water vapor than the MG-Gd-pDBI. This observation rules out the “pore-masking” phenomena as observed in the surface ad- sorption cases, where the pore entrances of the host frame- work are mostly blocked by the surface-adsorbed guest mole- cules. Moreover, DOX loading efficacy was varied from 5 to 12 wt% by increasing DOX concentration from 0.33 to 2 mgmL1, respectively (Supporting Information, Figure S15). To the best of our knowledge, a 12 wt% drug payload of DOX stands at a very high position among the DOX-loaded MOFs reported to date. Cumulative DOX release from Gd-pDBI materials were ob- served at two different pH values; at pH 7.4 and pH 5. A sus- tained release of about 44% of drug payload from 5 wt% DOX loaded MG-Gd-pDBI at pH 5 was observed for about 5 days, with a negligible release (ca. 2%) after 4 h. In contrast, only 22% of loaded DOX was released at pH 7.4 after 5 days under a similar environment (Figure 3b). For comparison, the re- leased amount of DOX from Gd-pDBI is higher than ZIF-8 (ca. 12%) but somewhat lower than Fe-MIL-100 (ca. 85%). Interest- ingly, DOX was preferentially released from MG-Gd-pDBI at cancer cells with minimum leaching under physiological condi- tions. Finally, almost complete release of the DOX from hydro- lyzed MG-Gd-pDBI was achieved after 15 days. We attempted both in vitro and in vivo experiments with MG-Gd-pDBI to evaluate its real potential as DDS. The non-toxic nature of MG- Gd-pDBI was confirmed by the MTT assay against the leukemia cancer cell line U 937. Three different concentrations (100 mgmL1, 200 mgmL1, and 300 mgmL1) of MG-Gd-pDBI were used for the assay, which showed that nearly 79% of viable cells were present at the maximum dosage of 300 mgmL1 with respect to the control with dose dependency (p<0.05; Figure 3c). On the other hand, DOX loaded MG-Gd- pDBI exhibited significant anticancer activity. Nearly 50% viable cells were present at 75 mgmL1 of 5 wt% DOX loaded MG-Gd-pDBI treatment while only 29% were present with 300 mgmL1 (Figure 3d). Furthermore, a Trypan blue assay (Supporting Information, Figure S20) verified that the IC50 value of 5 wt% DOX loaded MG-Gd-pDBI was reached at 75 mgmL1, Figure 3. a) Drug loading monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy. b) In vitro re- lease of DOX in PBS (pH 7.4) and Na2HPO4/citric acid (pH 5) buffers.

Notably, MG-Gd- pDBI bears two coordinated DMF molecule per Gd-cluster, which is undesirable in biomedical applications. However, our experimental evidences suggest stability and biocompatibility of MG-Gd-pDBI in blood fluid, with no significant Gd leaching determined by ICP-MS (Supporting Information, Figure S22). As a requirement for the design of a DDS, we also assessed the in vitro haemolysis experiments using human RBC at the three different aforementioned concentrations. Interestingly, no significant haemolysis was observed with respect to the control even at the highest concentration (300 mgmL1; Sup- porting Information, Figure S20). A detailed toxicological evalu- ation on lymphocytes including WST (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitro- phenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazoliu- m)), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), NO content, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also carried out (Support- ing Information, Section S7). No sharp rise in LDH level, NO, ROS content was observed with respect to the control. There- fore, in vitro blood toxicological assessments shed light on the potential blood biocompatibility of MG-Gd-pDBI for DDS. A comprehensive understanding of in vivo impact[17] of MG- Gd-pDBI is required at this stage for successful development of a DDS in the murine model system. No significant health dete- rioration, abnormal body weight loss and mortality were ob- served during the experiments. All the blood and serum bio- chemical parameters such as RBC, WBC, neutrophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and platelet levels were unchanged between the control and the injected mice. Liver functioning enzymes, such as ALP, LDH, SGOT, and SGPT levels, were almost normal. Kidney health regulators such as creati- nine, blood urea nitrogen, and uric acid levels were also unal- tered between the control and treated sets (Supporting Infor- mation, Table S2). General parameters, such as the total protein and phosphorous content, were also unaltered, as also seen by normal nutrition and bone metastasis. Thus, the normal blood biochemical parameters signified biodistribution of MG-Gd- pDBI and its subsequent excretion from mice body in due course. However, minor alterations in liver parameters were at- tributed to partial accumulation of MG-Gd-pDBI in the liver, which was supposed to be the major site for the deposition of foreign particles, owing to its abundant blood supply and the presence of reticuloendothelial system (RES) in this organ. All of the other major organs functions, including brain, heart, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen, were also normal in both the control and the treated sets (Figure 4). Conclusion The foregoing results demonstrated that pDBI constitutes a robust GdIII-based MOF with a hydrophilic environment where the hydrogen bonded water assembly is accommodated within large open channels (1.91.2 nm). Gd-pDBI exhibits si- multaneous water, acid and base stability, which is an out- standing feature and confers on it significant practical value. Remarkably, the structural integrity of the hybrid remains unal- tered even after mechanical grinding, with a narrow particle size distribution and good aqueous dispersion stability. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the biocompatibil- ity and allowed up to 12 wt% loading of the anticancer drug DOX within the hydrophilic channel. This value corresponds to the highest number reported for a MOF-based DDS with site- specific cancer cell drug release. We believe that our findings will inspire future prospects for the rational design of new MOF-based DDS. Bioimaging and MRI studies involving the in- trinsic blue fluorescence property of pDBI and GdIII ion are un- derway in our laboratories and will be reported in due course. Experimental Section Synthesis of Gd-pDBI pDBI (0.020 g, 0.05 mmol) dissolved in DMF (1.5 mL) was added to an aqueous solution (2.5 mL) of Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (0.023 g, 0.05 mmol) and was sonicated for 10 min. The turbid solution was kept in a tightly capped 5 mL vial for 72 h at 1108C to afford rod- shaped golden crystals (0.035 g, 70% yield).

Preperation of Gd-pDBI nanocrystals As-synthesized Gd-pDBI (50 mg) was ball-milled using a Retsch (MM400) operated at 30 Hz for 30 min to obtain a light yellow powder of mechanically ground Gd-pDBI (MG-Gd-pDBI). Loading of anticancer drug Doxorubicin (DOX) Each Gd-pDBI (Gd-pDBI or MG-Gd-pDBI) was dispersed in Milli-Q water (5 mL) by simple sonication in an ultrasound bath followed by addition of standard DOX solution (2 mg dissolved in 1 mL Milli-Q water). This mixture was further sonicated for 5 min and then kept under vigorous stirring overnight in the dark. Finally, Figure 4.

KGaA, Weinheim 10517 Full Paper DOX loaded Gd-pDBI was isolated by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 15 min and washed (2) with copious amount of Milli-Q water to eliminate surface adsorption. Interestingly, the as-synthesized Gd-pDBI exhibited negligible loading, suggesting that the entire payload is inside the pore. Cumulative drug release measurement Cumulative drug release from DOX loaded Gd-pDBI was studied at two different pH values: 1) at pH 5, which was comparable to intra- cellular lysomal pH of cancer cells; and 2) at pH 7.4, which corre- sponds to the extracellular pathophysical pH of normal cells. DOX loaded Gd-pDBI (5 mg) was dispersed in corresponding buffer solu- tion (3 mL) and sealed inside a dialysis bag (molecular cut off 50 kD), which was then subsequently immersed in 100 mL of external buffer medium kept in a bowl. Dialysis was continued at 378C and drug release was monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy at l=481 nm. The zero-order kinetics was corroborated from linear nature of the release profile.

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded on a Phillips PANalytical diffractometer for Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), with a scan speed of 2° min-1 and a step size of 0.02° in 2θ. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were taken on a Bruker Optics ALPHA-E spectrometer with a universal Zn-Se ATR (attenuated total reflection) accessory in the 600-4000 cm–1 region or using a Diamond ATR (Golden Gate). Thermo-gravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a TG50 analyzer (Mettler-Toledo) or a SDT Q600 TG-DTA analyzer under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 ºC min–1 within a temperature range of 40-900 °C. All low pressure water adsorption experiments (up to 1 bar) were performed on the Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ-MP automatic volumetric instrument. Leica M-80 optical microscope with hot stage and camera attachment was used for collecting photographs. SEM images were obtained with a FEI, QUANTA 200 3D Scanning Electron Microscope with tungsten filament as electron source operated at 10 kV. The samples were sputtered with Au (nano-sized film) prior to imaging by a SCD 040 Balzers Union as well as by sprinkling the powder on carbon tape. TEM images were recorded using FEI Tecnai G2 F20 X-TWIN transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The specimens were prepared by dropcasting a DMF solution of the sample (ca. 10-3 M) on copper grids TEM Window (TED PELLA, INC. 200 mesh). The materials were flash dried prior imaging. UV-vis absorbance studies were carried out with Varian Carry 50 instrument equipped with a single beam facility (with a spectral resolution of 0.5 nm). 3 S2: Synthesis of pDBI; NMR and IR spectroscopy Synthesis of 1,4-bis(5-carboxy-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)benzene (pDBI): In a 500 mL round- bottom-flask, a solution of terephthaldehyde (5.0 g, 0.037 mol) in aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfite (90 mL, 40% aqueous solution) was prepared by ultrasonication for 2 h. After this time, a suspension of 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid (11.2 g, 0.074 mol) in EtOH (200 mL) was added and stirred at RT for 30 min. The temperature was raised to reflux and maintained for 5 h. After cooling down to RT, the solid formed was filtered off, washed with EtOH and deionized water (×3) and dried under vacuum for 24 h at 100 °C. The ligand was recrystallized from a mixture water/DMF (1/9, v/v) and further dried for 24 h at 100 °C to afford the desired compound as a yellow powder (10.5 g, 70% yield). M.p. 378 °C.

The data collection was done at 100 K. The crystals were mounted on a Super Nova Dual source X-ray Diffractometer system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a CCD area detector and operated at 250 W power (50 kV, 0.8 mA) to generate Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). Initial scans of each specimen were performed to obtain preliminary unit cell parameters and to assess the mosaicity (breadth of spots between frames) of the crystal to select the required frame width for data collection. CrysAlisPro program software was used suite to carry out overlapping φ and ω scans at detector (2θ) settings (2θ = 28). Following data collection, reflections were sampled from all regions of the Ewald sphere to redetermine unit cell parameters for data integration. In no data collection was evidence for crystal decay encountered. Following exhaustive review of collected frames the resolution of the dataset was judged. Data were integrated using CrysAlisPro software with a narrow frame algorithm. Data were subsequently corrected for absorption by the program SCALE3 ABSPACK1 scaling algorithm. These structures were solved by direct method and refined using the SHELXTL 972 software suite. Atoms were located from iterative examination of difference F-maps following least squares refinements of the earlier models. Final model was refined anisotropically (if the number of data permitted) until full convergence was achieved. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions (C-H = 0.93 Å) and included as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters 1.2-1.5 times Ueq of the attached C atoms. The structure was examined using the ADSYM subroutine of PLATON3 to assure that no additional symmetry could be applied to the models. The ellipsoids in ORTEP diagrams are displayed at the 50% probability level unless noted otherwise. 6 Table S1: Crystal structure and refinement details of Gd-pDBI Empirical formula C72 H86 Gd2 N14 O29 Formula weight 1926.04 Temperature 100(2) K Wavelength 0.71073 Å Crystal system Monoclinic Space group P2/c Unit cell dimensions a = 8.2096(16) Å α = 90° b = 14.998(3) Å β = 101.710(4)° c = 37.652(7) Å γ = 90° Unit cell volume 4539.5(15)Å3 Z 2 Density (calculated) 1.519 mg mm-3 Absorption coefficient 1.543 mm-1 F(000) 2092 Crystal size 0.5× 0.2 × 0.2 mm3 Theta range for data collection 1.75 to 28.26 Index ranges -10 <= h <= 10, -19 <= k <= 19, -50<= l <= 47 Reflections collected 11237 Independent reflections 9351 Completeness to theta = 26.02° 99.9 % Absorption correction Multi-scan Refinement method Full-matrix least-squares on F2 Goodness-of-fit on F2 1.256 Final R indices [I ≥ 2sigma(I)] R1 = 0.0730, wR2 = 0.1558 R indices (all data) R1 = 0.0871, wR2 = 0.1611 Largest diff. peak and hole 1.694 and -3.099 e.Å-3 7 Figure S4.

S7: Detailed biological experiments for Gd-pDBI Loading of anticancer drug Doxorubicin (DOX): Each Gd-pDBI (Gd-pDBI or MG-Gd-pDBI) was dispersed in milli-Q water (5 mL) by simple sonication in an ultrasound bath followed by addition of standard DOX solution (2 mg dissolved in 1 mL milli-Q water). This mixture was further sonicated for 5 minutes and then kept under vigorous stirring overnight in dark. Finally, DOX loaded Gd-pDBI was isolated by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 15 minutes and washed (×2) with copious amount of milli-Q water to eliminate surface adsorption. Interestingly, the as- synthesized Gd-pDBI exhibited negligible loading, suggesting that the entire payload is inside the pore. Cumulative drug release measurement: Cumulative drug release from DOX loaded Gd-pDBI was studied at two different pH values: (1) at pH 5, which was comparable to intracellular lysomal pH of cancer cells and (2) at pH 7.4, which corresponds to the extracellular pathophysical pH of normal cells. DOX loaded Gd-pDBI (5 mg) was dispersed in correspondingbuffer solution (3 mL) and sealed inside a dialysis bag (molecular cut off 50 kD), which was then subsequently immersed in 100 mL of external buffer medium kept in a bowl. Dialysis was continued at 37 °C and drug release was monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy at λ= 481 nm. The zero order kinetics was corroborated from linear nature of the release profile. In vitro anticancer activity study of DOX loaded Gd-pDBI: Human leukemia cancer cell lines (U 937) were purchased from NCCS, Pune. These cells were accessed for in vitro toxicity study by MTT [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. All cultures were maintained in a phenol red free culture medium DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco's modified essential medium/Ham's 12 nutrient mixture, Gibco), supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (JS Bioscience, Australia), and 1% (v/v) antibiotic (2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL Penicillin and 0.1 13 mg/mL Streptomycin; Gibco). Cultured cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were seeded in a 96 well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h. After this time, they were incubated for 48 h with three different concentration of MG-Gd-pDBI (i.e., 100 µg/mL, 200 µg/mL, 300 µg/mL) followed by incubation in media containing 0.5 mg/mL of MTT for 34 h at 37 °C. The resulting formazan crystals were dissolved in an MTT solubilization buffer and the absorbance measured at λ = 570 nm by using a microplate reader (Biorad). The obtained values were compared to the control cells. Meanwhile five different concentrations of DOX loaded MG-Gd-pDBI were tested against U 937 cells using the above mentioned procedure to check the anticancer activity of DOX loaded MG-Gd-pDBI. These results were also cross- checked by using trypan blue assay. Evaluation of in vivo toxicity, blood biochemical parameters and histopathological analysis: In vivo toxicity was evaluated on healthy young, non pregnant, nulliparous swiss albino mice, weighing ca. 20–22 g (8-weeks old), were placed into clean polypropylene cages with feeding access. These cages were maintained in an air-conditioned animal house at 20 ± 28 °C, 50–70% relative humidity and 12 h light/dark cycle. The animals were provided with commercial mice pellet diet and deionized water. After one week of acclimation, the mices were randomly divided into 4 groups, each one consisting of five females and five males. They were kept separately in polypropylene cages. Doses of 100 µg/mL, 200 µg/mL, 300 µg/mL of MG-Gd-pDBI were suspended in water by sonication for 15 min before treatment. 100 µL of each suspension were intravenously injected through tail vein. One week later, the animals were sacrificed and blood was collected from the ophthalmic veins. Serum was obtained by centrifugation of whole blood at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Serum biochemical levels including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein (TP), total cholesterol, tri-glyceride (TG), uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum glutamic oxaloacetic acid (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and phosphorus were examined. 1 mL of blood sample was treated with aqueous EDTA-Na (0.1 mL from a 15 g/L solution) and immediately used for the blood element test [total count of red blood and white blood cells (TC), DC (Neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), and blood platelets] within 2 h. Major organs like brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, stomach, kidneys, testis or uterus were dissected out (ca. 5–6 mm thick), stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined under light microscopy. Haemolysis on RBC: Human erythrocyte enriched fraction was centrifuged twice (3000 rpm, 15 min) at ca. 4 °C to remove the residual plasma and buffy coat. RBCs were washed 3 times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and resuspended in same buffer to make packed cell volume of ca. 10% 14 (w/v) as stock. Then haemolysis was carried out by mixing 690 mL of the above RBC stock suspension with 10 mL of MG-Gd-PDBI at three different concentrations of 100µg/mL, 200µg/mL and 300µg/mL and making a total volume 1.5 mL by addition of PBS to maintain 5.5% cell volume for each and every set of experiment. Afterward, the erythrocyte cells were centrifuged (3000 rpm, 15 min) at 4 °C and washed thrice with PBS. Haemolysis was monitored UV-Vis spectrophotometrically at 540 nm. Isolation of mononuclear cells from blood: Human peripheral blood was obtained by venipuncture from healthy volunteers (20–25 year old male donors, non-smokers, non-alcohol consuming and not undergoing any medication) into heparinised vacutainers. Lymphocytes were isolated from fresh blood according to the method of Boyum (1976), using Histopaque. The cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in RPMI- 1640 media at a concentration of 106 cell mol-1 for further use. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines. Cell proliferation assay (WST): The assay is based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt to formazan by cellular mitochondrial dehydrogenase. The amount of the dye generated by the activity of dehydrogenase is directly proportional to the number of living cells. The formazan dye produced by the visible cells can be quantified by spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance of the dye solution at 440nm. NO content: NO plays an important role in neurotransmission, vascular regulation, immune response and apoptosis. NO is rapidly oxidized to nitrite and nitrate which are used to quantitate NO production. The first step converts nitrate to nitrite utilizing nitrate reductase. The second step uses Griess Reagents to convert nitrite to a deep purple azo compound. The amount of the azochromophore accurately reflects nitric oxide amount in samples. LDH cytotoxicity assay: Cell death can occur either by apoptosis or by necrosis. Necrosis is accompanied by mitochondrial swelling and increased plasma membrane permeability, whereas apoptosis involves an articulated breakdown of the cell into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies.1 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a soluble cytosolic enzyme that is released into the culture medium following loss of membrane integrity resulting from either apoptosis or necrosis. LDH activity, therefore, can be used as an indicator of cell membrane integrity and serves as a general means to assess cytotoxicity resulting from chemical compounds or environmental toxic factors. Cayman’s LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit measures LDH activity present in the culture medium using a coupled two-step reaction. In the first step, LDH catalyzes the reduction of NAD+ to NADH and H+ by oxidation of lactate to pyruvate. In the second step of the reaction, diaphorase 15 uses the newly-formed NADH and H+ to catalyze the reduction of a tetrazolium salt (INT) to highly-colored formazan which absorbs strongly at 490-520 nm. ROS/RNS assay: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are well established molecules responsible for the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. The assay employs a proprietary quenched fluorogenic probe, dichlorodihydrofluorescin DiOxyQ (DCFH-DiOxyQ), which is a specific ROS/RNS probe that is based on similar chemistry to the popular 2’,7’- dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. The DCFH-DiOxyQ probe is first primed with a quench removal reagent, and subsequently stabilized in the highly reactive DCFH form. In this reactive state, ROS and RNS species can react with DCFH, which isc rapidly ioxidized to the highly fluorescent 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF). Fluorescence intensity is proportional to the total ROS/RNS levels within the sample. The free radical content in unknown samples is determined by comparison with the predetermined DCF standard curve. 16 Figure S13. a) FT-IR spectra of Gd-pDBI and DOX loaded Gd-pDBI. b) Zoomed region showing DOX characteristic peaks in DOX loaded Gd-pDBI.

Stability of the MG-Gd-pDBI in biological fluid under mimicking environment Stability of the MG-Gd-pDBI in the blood fluid under mimicking environment was monitored by ICP-MS analysis; where no significant leaching of Gd(III) into the fluid was observed. Gd(III) release was noted only in ppb levels thereby signifying its stability in the subsequent medium. Therefore this result rules out the possibility of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) by unwanted Gd(III) leaching by the framework. This result also matched with the FT-IR spectroscopy which hints at the intact framework integrity of the Gd-pDBI materials. However, MG-Gd-pDBI exhibit loss of crystallinity upon treatment in blood fluid for 5 days. This phenomenon is in accordance with the base treated and DOX loaded MG-Gd-pDBI material, where diminished crystallinity was observed with respect to pristine materials.

Figure S24. a) WST assay b) LDH assay c) NO content and d) ROS content assay of MG-Gd- pDBI. 22 Lymphocytes are known to function as a regulator of immune system; introduction of a foreign matter within the system could alter its response. WST assay revealed that the cytotoxic response of MG-Gd-pDBI on lymphocytes was lower in contrast to control (Figure S23a). It was well documented that cell death could occur either by necrosis or by programmed cell death apoptosis. But in both ways cell death could lead to leaching of water soluble cytosolic enzyme within the medium. A sharp rise in LDH level would therefore signify the toxicity symptoms due to administration of MG-Gd-pDBI leading to cell death which was barely observed in treated sets when we compared the cellular viability (Figure S23b). NO content plays a pivotal role during neurotransmission and immune response. No significant alterations were observed in NO content measurement with respect to control (Figure S23c); similar gestures were reported in ROS determination (Figure S23d) thereby revealing that unnecessary oxidative stress was prevented in MG-Gd-pDBI treated sets. Therefore no significant toxic response was noted to lymphocytes which also corroborated with heamolysis data which demonstraed no significant toxicity in blood stream either. 23 Table S2: in vivo biochemical parameters in control and treated sets Parameters Control MOF 100 µg/mL 200 µg/mL 300 µg/mL Hemoglobin (g/dl) 14.2 ± 0.1 14.3 ±0.1 14.33 ±0.0577 14.6±0.1 TC RBC (million/ mm3) 4.66 ±0.0577 4.63 ±0.0577 4.66±0.057735 4.73±0.057735 WBC/ mm3 4220 ±20 4226.66±25.16 4227±28.09 4227.33±23.69 DC (%) Neutrophils 38.66±0.5777 39.66±0.577 40.66±0.577 41.33±0.577 Lymphocytes 55±1 58±1 57.66±0.577 57±1 Monocytes 02±0 02±0 02±0 02±0 Eosinophils 02±0 02±0 02±0 02±0 Basophils 0±0 0±0 0±0 0±0 Platelets (lakh/ mm3) 1.5±0.0057 1.51±0.01154 1.523±0.005 1.516±0.00577 LDH (IU/L) 217.33±1.1547 211.33±1.1547 212.66±1.1547 210.66±1.1547 Creatinine (mg/dl) 0.836±0.00577 0.856±0.00577 0.933±0.0115 0.826±0.01115 Alkaline Phosphate (U/L) 60±1 62.66±0.577 66.66±1.154 71±1 Total Protein (gm/dl) 6.53±0.0577 6.83±0.0577 6.93±0.0577 6.96±0.0577 Cholesterol (mg/dl) 122.66±0.577 128.33±0.577 128.66±0.577 133.66±0.577 Triglyceride (mg/dl) 138.33±0.577 143.33±0.577 145±1 146.66±0.577 Uric Acid (mg/dl) 4.56±0.0577 5.13±0.0577 5.16±0.0577 4.83±0.0577 BUN (mg/dl) 10±0 10.33±0.577 10.66±0.577 10.66±0.577 SGOT (Unit/L) 35.33±0.577 41.66±0.577 46±1 47.33±0.577 SGPT (Unit/L) 41.33±0.577 46.33±0.577 41.66±0.577 44.33±0.577 Phosphorous (mg/dl) 3.17±0.0115 3.17±0.01154 3.17±0.01154 3.086±0.0057 Table S3: MOFs used for DOX delivery MOF DOX loading DOX release (pH 7.4) Reference Fe-MIL-100 9.2 wt% ~85% (5 days) 5a ZIF-8 4.9 wt% ~12% (5 days) 10 Gd-pDBI 12 wt% ~22% (5 days) This work 24 S8: References 1.
