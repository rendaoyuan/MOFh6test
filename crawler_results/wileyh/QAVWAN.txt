Introduction Microporous metal-organic frameworks (MMOFs), as an important class of crystalline solids and a new type of porous materials, have received tremendous attention over the past decade [ 1 ] because of their potential in various applications, for example, gas and hydrocarbon adsorption and separation, [ 2 ] catalysis, [ 3 ] magnetism, [ 4 ] sensing, and detection. [ 5 ] Compared with other adsorbent materials currently used in industry, e.g., zeolites and activated carbons, MMOFs possess many intriguing features, including but not limited to: large surface area, high crystallinity with well-deﬁ ned pore properties (pore shape, size, and volume), easily tailorable structures, and chemical functionality. Among many on-going efforts to develop high-performance MMOF materials, ligand functionalization is considered to be one of the most effective strategies. [ 1b , 6 ] We and others have shown that such chemical functionalization within the frameworks may signiﬁ cantly enhance the adsorption property of the modiﬁ ed structures over that of their parent frameworks. Examples include manipulating pore size and shape while maintaining the structure topology, controlling the level of catenation to tune porosity, introducing new reactive sites to improve afﬁ nity towards certain guest spe- cies, and creating a particular environment to adjust hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity and/or acidity/basicity. [ 7 ] The Effect of Methyl Functionalization on Microporous Metal-Organic Frameworks’ Capacity and Binding Energy for Carbon Dioxide Adsorption DOI: 10.1002/adfm.201101479 The design, synthesis, and structural characterization of two new micro- porous metal-organic framework (MMOF) structures is reported; Zn(BDC) (DMBPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 0.5 (H 2 O) 0.5 ( 1 ; H 2 BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid; DMBPY = 2,2′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridine) and Zn(NDC)(DMBPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 2 ( 2; H 2 NDC = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, DMF = N,N,-dimethylformamide ), which are obtained by functionalizing a pillar ligand with methyl groups. Both compounds are 3D porous structures of the Zn 2 ( L ) 2 ( P ) type and are made of a paddle-wheel Zn 2 (COO) 4 secondary building unit (SBU), with the dicarbo- xylate and DMBPY as linker ( L ) and pillar ( P ) ligands, respectively. Compari- sons are made to the parent structures Zn(BDC)(BPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 0.5 (H 2 O) 0.5 ( 3; BPY = 4,4′-bipyridine ) and Zn(NDC)(BPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 1.575 ( 4 ) to analyze and understand the effect of methyl functionalization. CO 2 -adsorption studies indicate substantially enhanced isosteric heats of CO 2 adsorption ( Q st ) for both compounds, as a result of adding methyl groups to the BPY ligand. The CO 2 uptake capacity, however, is affected by two opposing and competing factors: the enhancement due to increased MMOF–CO 2 interactions (higher Q st values) and detraction due to the surface area and pore-volume reduction. For 1′ (the guest-free form of 1 ), the positive effect dominates, which leads to a signiﬁ cantly higher uptake of CO 2 than that of its parent structure 3′ (the guest-free form of 3 ). In 2′ (the guest-free form of 2 ), however, the negative effect rules, which results in a slightly lower CO 2 uptake with respect to 4′ (the guest-free form of 4 ). All four compounds exhibit a relatively high separa- tion capability for carbon dioxide over other small gases, including CH 4 , N 2 , and O 2 . The separation ratios of CO 2 to O 2 and N 2 (at 298 K and 1 atm) are 39.8 and 23.5 for compound 1′ , 57.7 and 40.2 for 2′ , 25.7 and 29.5 for 3′ , 89.7, and 20.3 for 4′ , respectively. IR and Raman spectroscopic characterization of CO 2 interactions with 1′ and 2′ provides indirect support of the importance of the methyl groups in the interaction of CO 2 within these systems. H.

Structural Characterization Compound 1 crystallizes in the tetragonal crystal system, space group P4 3 2 1 2 (No. 96). Its single crystal structure reveals a jungle-gym-type 3D framework ( Figure 1 ). The secondary building unit (SBU) in 1 is a commonly found paddle-wheel Zn 2 (COO) 4 cluster, in which two zinc atoms share eight oxygen atoms of four BDC ligands. The neighboring SBUs are interconnected through the BDC ligands to form 2D square grids, which are further extended to the 3D framework by the DMBPY pillars. The structure contains a 4 1 screw axis parallel to the c axis, which leads to a zig-zag 1D channel along the same direction within a single network. Two such identical networks interpenetrate to complete the overall structure. The inclusion of methyl groups results in a reduction of the channel opening, from 4.0 × 4.0 Å in the parent structure 3 to 3.8 Å × 3.8 Å in 1 (measured between the C–C atoms by excluding the van der Waals radius of carbon). Calculated from the PLATON pro- gram, 33% of unit cell volume is solvent-accessible in 1 , while this value is 38% in 3; both compounds have the same SBUs, similar connectivity, and twofold interpenetrated network. Structural analysis shows that the overall connectivity of compound 2 is similar to that of compound 4 ( Figure 2 ). Compound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system, space group C2/c (No. 15). The SBU of 2 is also a paddle- wheel Zn 2 (COO) 4 unit. The adjacent units are connected through the NDC ligands to form 2D nets, which are fur- ther linked by the DMBPY pillars to give rise to a twofold- interpenetrated 3D framework. Compound 2 also possesses a 1D open channel along the c direction, with pore dimensions Unlike amino [ 8 ] and hydroxy [ 9 ] groups, which have been extensively utilized in ligand functionalization of MMOFs, the methyl group has seldom been considered a real functional group, due mostly to its relatively “inactive” chemical nature. To date very few examples of methyl-functionalized MMOFs have been reported, with practically no information on the effect of this group on adsorption properties. However, a recent theoretical study suggests a positive effect of the methyl group in CO 2 adsorption, in which the CO 2 –aromatic interaction is strengthened by the introduction of an electron-donating methyl group, and the CO 2 -loaded complex can be stabilized by the hydrogen-bond-like interactions with methyl H atoms. [ 10 ] Therefore, the enhanced interaction between a methyl group and CO 2 may override the reduction of pore size caused by addition of CH 3 to the ligand, and thus facilitate the adsorption of CO 2 . Today, effective carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (CCS) is one of the most pressing missions to slow down the abnormal climate change and global warming induced by rapid CO 2 accumulation. To improve the performace of MMOFs as effective CCS materials, two general strategies may be envi- sioned in the design and construction of these structures. [ 11 ] The ﬁ rst is to tune the pore size, framework topology, and the surface area for selective sorption of CO 2 . [ 12 ] The second is to modify the internal surface chemistry by introducing functional groups into the MMOF structures for enhanced interaction with CO 2 . [ 8c , 9e , 13 ] Introduction of a –CH 3 functional group may bring about two additional advantages: the ﬁ rst being the possibility to prevent the occurrence of high-degree framework interpenetration and/or severe structure distortion upon guest removal; and the second that the introduction of hydrophobic functional groups may enhance the water/moisture stability of the frameworks. To better understand how the adsorption of CO 2 and other small gases are affected in the methyl-group-functionalized MMOFs, we carried out a systematic study on four related com- pounds ( Scheme 1 ); the two functionalized structures Zn(BDC) (DMBPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 0.5 (H 2 O) 0.5 ( 1 ), Zn(NDC)(DMBPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 2 ( 2 ) and two parent structures Zn(BDC)(BPY) 0.5 · (DMF) (H 2 O) 0.5 ( 3 ) and Zn(NDC)(BPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 1.575 ( 4 ) (H 2 BDC = Scheme 1 .

Mater. 2011, 21, 4754–4762 of 4.1 × 4.1 Å (measured between the C atoms by excluding the van der Waals radius of carbon), in comparison with the window size of 4.3 × 4.3 Å found in its parent structure, 4 . About 40% and 42% of the unit cell volumes in 2 and 4 are accessible to the guest molecules, as calculated by using PLATON. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of the crystalline samples of all four compounds reveals differences in their weight-loss proﬁ les. For compound 1 , the ﬁ rst continuous weight loss (14.3%) from room temperature to 180 ° C can be assigned to the loss of guest molecules, and the next steep weight loss occurring at 370 ° C corresponds to the decomposition of the structure. A similar two-step weight loss was found for compound 2 with the ﬁ rst weight loss around 16.4% and the collapse of the framework occurring at 360 ° C. For the parent compounds, the ﬁ rst weight losses are 15.5% for 3 and 21.3% for 4 , respectively. All experimental weight losses are consistent with the calculated values from structural data (12.6% for compound 1 , 16.7% for compound 2 , 21.1% for compound 3 , and 24.2% for compound 4 , respectively). The TG data indicate the high thermostability of all four struc- tures. A very recent report reveals enhanced water stability by –CH 3 functionalization at room temperature. [ 15 ] Here we also demonstrate that the water stability of both methyl- functionalized compounds 1 and 2 is signiﬁ cantly enhanced over that of their parent structures. As shown in Figure 3 , the frameworks of 1 and 2 remain intact after exposure to water at 40 ° C for 7 days, while noticeable changes are observed in the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of 3 and 4 after exposure to water for only 1 day. This result clearly suggests that the methyl group can effectively protect from the attack of water molecules. Compared with the similar weight losses found for BDC compounds 1 and 3 (14.3% vs. 15.5%), larger differences for NDC compounds 2 and 4 (16.4% vs. 21.3%) are observed. The crystallinity and purity of all as-synthesized samples were conﬁ rmed by PXRD analysis. Notably, changes in the PXRD patterns are observed for all samples without guest molecules, which suggests that these frameworks are Figure 1 . View of the crystal structure of compound 1 .

[ 16 ] Such a structural trans- formation between networks with different levels of inter- penetration has not been reported previously. To evaluate the pore characteristics of 1′ – 4′ (the desolvated form of 1-4 ), N 2 -adsorption experiments were conducted at 77 K and the results are summarized in Table 1 , along with the estimated Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Langmuir sur- face areas and the pore volumes as calculated by the Horvath– Kawazoe (HK) method. [ 17 ] Compared to the parent structure 3′ , a signiﬁ cant lowering of surface area and the pore volume ﬂ exible in nature upon heating or degassing. A closer look at these changes reveals some interesting aspects. Unlike the signiﬁ cant alternation found in 3′ , the PXRD pattern of 1′ is largely retained with only several minor new peaks after removal of the guest. This result is likely due to steric hinder- ance by the methyl groups in 1 which prevents the structure from distorting extensively. For 4 , it is surprising to note that the PXRD pattern of the guest-free sample ( 4′ ) matches almost perfectly with a different structure that has threefold inter- penetration, M 3 (NDC) 3 (BPY) 1.5 (M = Co, Ni; see Figure S6 Figure 3 .

Mater. 2011, 21, 4754–4762 in the functionalized compound 1′ is a direct consequence of space occupation by the methyl groups in the voids. For 2 and 4 , despite the fact that they are made of a longer linker (NDC) ligand and have high solvent-accessible volumes, the very small surface areas and pore volumes of empty 2′ and 4′ are a result of structural transformation that gives rise to frameworks of signiﬁ cantly reduced porosity. 2.2. Gas Adsorption and Separation 2.2.1. Hydrogen Adsorption Figure 4 shows the hydrogen absorption and desorption iso- therms of compounds 1′ , 2′ , 3′ , and 4′ measured at 77 K (data in Table 1 ). Apparently, compounds 3′ and 4′ show higher hydrogen-absorption capacity than the two methyl-function- alized compounds 1′ and 2′ , respectively. The result correlates well with the changes in surface area and pore volume for each set and agrees well with our previous study, which indicates that the pore properties (pore volume and surface area) play a domi- nating role in the amount of H 2 uptake when the adsorbate– adsorbent interactions are similar. [ 9e ] 2.2.2. Carbon Dioxide Adsorption The CO 2 adsorption isotherms for evacuated compounds 1′ – 4′ were collected at 273, 288, and 298 K, and are plotted in Figure 5 . An opposite trend from that seen in the H 2 adsorption is obtained for CO 2 uptake in the two BDC compounds 1′ (2.6 wt%) and 3′ (1.9 wt%) at 298 K and 1 atm, and at lower temperature (273 K and 1 atm) the CO 2 uptake amount for 1′ (11.4 wt%) is double that of its parent structure 3′ (5.0 wt%), regardless of the fact that surface area and pore volume in 1’ are signiﬁ cantly lower compared to 3′ . Note the hysteresis in the isotherms of 1′ at lower temperatures (273 and 288 K, Figure 4 and Figure S12a, left). This hysteresis is most likely a result of nonequilibration due to the slow diffusion process at low temperatures, and it indeed closes up at higher temperatures (Figure 4 and Figure S12a, right). The CO 2 adsorption in the NDC compounds 2′ and 4′ shows a similar order as that of H 2 adsorption. As seen from the plots, 4′ has a larger CO 2 uptake amount of 5.7 wt% and 3.2 wt% at 273 and 298 K (1 atm) respectively, in comparison with those of the methyl-functionalized compound 2′ (4.0 wt% and 1.4 wt%) under the same conditions. The extent of adsorbent–adsorbate interactions was estimated by the isosteric heats of CO 2 adsorption calculated based on the adsorption isotherms recorded at 298, 303, and 308 for 1′ , and 273, 288, and 298 K for 2′ – 4′ . As shown in the Q st plots ( Figure 6 ), the values are 33.2–45.2 kJ mol − 1 and 35.1–38.7 kJ mol − 1 for 1′ and 2′ , respectively, at a loading range up to ca. 2 wt%. Both values are considerably higher than those of compounds 3′ (10–37.2 kJ mol − 1 ) and 4′ (28.6–32.6 kJ mol − 1 ) for the same loading range, which is Figure 4 .

The isotherms of all gases taken at room temperature are plotted in Figure S13. The data clearly show that all four compounds adsorb essentially no N 2 and O 2 at room temperature and the experimental pressure range, and only a small amount of CH 4 is adsorbed by compounds 1′ (0.57 wt%), 2′ (0.05 wt%), 3′ (0.16 wt%), and 4′ (0.27 wt%) at 1 atm. The single component separa- tion ratios of the CO 2 /CH 4 , CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /O 2 , deﬁ ned as q 1 / q 2 at a speciﬁ ed pressure (where q is the adsorbed amount of a pure gas), are calculated for 1′ – 4′ and given in Table 2 . The CO 2 /N 2 separation ratios found in 1′, 2′ , and 4′ are signiﬁ cantly higher than those reported for zeolite and carbon adsorbents (e.g., zeolite 13X: 18 at 298 K and 1 atm), [ 18 ] which places them among a small group of MMOFs with the highest CO 2 /N 2 sepa- ration ratios (e.g., MOF-74-Mg: 12 at 1 atm, SNU-M10: 98 at 1 atm). [ 9c , 11g ] 2.3. IR and Raman Study To examine the interaction of the guest molecules within 1′ and 2′ , we performed in situ infrared (IR) absorption spec- troscopy measurements upon H 2 and CO 2 adsorption at 298K. Hydrogen-adsorption measurements performed at 48 bar in 1′ and 2′ are summarized in Figure 7 . There is a clear IR-absorp- tion band associated with the internal stretch vibration of H 2 adsorbed in 1′ and 2′ at 4121 and 4115 cm − 1 , respectively. These bands are red-shifted by ca. –34 cm − 1 and ca. –40 cm − 1 from the unperturbed stretch frequency of ortho -H 2 at 4155 cm − 1 . The larger IR shift observed for 2′ indicates that the adsorption environment is different from that for H 2 in 1′ . This larger shift is consistent with what was previously observed for MMOFs where H 2 interacts with several benzene rings. [ 19 ] Moreover, the IR shift of the H 2 stretch in 1′ is smaller than those previously observed in a similar system, Zn(BDC)(TED) 0.5 (TED = triethyl- enediamine) (ca. –37 cm − 1 ) but is similar to those observed in Ni(BODC)(TED) 0.5 (BODC = bicycle[2.2.2]octane-1,4-dicarboxy- late) (ca. –34 cm − 1 ), where an aliphatic ligand replaces the ben- zene ring. [ 19 ] This result suggests that the interaction of H 2 in 1′ is closer to the methyl groups than to the BDC ligand. As is often the case, the intensity of these IR absorption bands does not correlate with the concentration or the binding energy of H 2 in the MMOF. In this case, the integrated area of the H 2 stretch absorption in 2′ is twice that of H 2 in 1′ , even though the isotherms show a larger H 2 adsorption in 1′ . The details of the adsorption site (symmetry and interaction with benzene rings) have a strong inﬂ uence on the IR absorption intensity (through a dipole moment change), therefore information indicative of stronger interactions between CO 2 and the methyl- modiﬁ ed frameworks in these compounds. In fact, the Q st value at zero loading for 1′ (45.2 kJ mol − 1 ) is comparable to the highest number reported thus far. [ 9a ] The calculated Q st values can be con- sidered as solid experimental validation which supports the theo- retical computational results: before methyl functionalization is introduced, the main interaction of the MMOF framework with CO 2 is between the delocalized aromatic π system and the molec- ular quadrupole of CO 2 ; upon the introduction of a methyl group directly attached to the aromatic ring, the quadrupole- π electron interaction is signiﬁ cantly enhanced, due to the electron-donating effect of the methyl group with the injection of electronic charge into the aromatic system. In addition, weak hydrogen-bond-like interactions between H (CH 3 ) and O (CO 2 ) atoms may also con- tribute to the stabilization of the MMOF–CO 2 complex. As in the case of H 2 -uptake capacity, to evaluate the effect of methyl group in the CO 2 adsorption of the MMOFs, two opp- site factors must be taken into account: the positive effect of the enhancement of CO 2 afﬁ nity and the negative effect of pore space reduction, as a result of addition of the methyl group. The two effects are competitive during the CO 2 adsorption. When a strong increase in the CO 2 afﬁ nity is achieved and it overides the space-loss effect, the CO 2 -adsorption capacity will be enhanced considerably. On the other hand, if the increase of the CO 2 afﬁ nity is not sufﬁ ciently high to compete with the loss of pore volume, the CO 2 -adsorption capacity will be decreased. In the case of the BDC compounds 1′ and 3′ , the amount of CO 2 uptake is signiﬁ cantly enhanced through methyl function- alization, despite the reduction of surface area and pore volume of 1′ compared to 3′ , which exempliﬁ es a positive effect of CO 2 adsorption via ligand functionalization. For NDC compounds 2′ and 4′ , however, while decreasing pore size does correlate with higher Q st values obtained for 2’ , the negative effect is domi- nant in the competition and leads to a small overall decrease in the CO 2 uptake after the addition of methyl group. Compari- sons can also be made between 1′ and 2′ , as both are function- alized with a methyl group and have similar paddle-wheel 3D structures. The N 2 -adsorption study shows while 2′ is made of a longer linker ligand (NDC), it has a much smaller pore volume and surface area compared to 1′ , built on a smaller linker (BDC). This result is attributed to the structure transformation in 2 which gives rise to greatly reduced porosity as well as CO 2 uptake. 2.2.3. Adsorption of Other Small-Molecular Gases Furthermore, the adsorption studies of other small-molecular gases, including CH 4 , N 2 , and O 2, were also carried out to Table 2.

Mater. 2011, 21, 4754–4762 about uptake of H 2 molecules in the MMOF cannot be derived using the integrated areas of the H 2 IR absorption bands. In this case, there are more benzene rings in the NDC ligand than in the BDC leading to a stronger interaction of the H 2 in 2′ . The inﬂ uence of the symmetry of the adsorption site and of H 2 –H 2 interactions on the dipole moment of adsorbed H 2 was previously observed in MOF-74 and in Zn 2 (BPDC) 2 (BPEE), where BPDC = 4,4′- biphenyl dicarboxylate, BPEE = 1,2-bis(4- pyridyl)ethylene. [ 19 , 20 ] IR absorption spectroscopy was also performed to study the interaction of CO 2 within these two systems. Figure 8 shows that the IR frequency shifts of the asymmetric C = O stretch mode (ca. –14 cm − 1 ) of adsorbed CO 2 are similar for both cases. This result indicates that the position of the CO 2 within both of these systems is essentially the same, which may point to the interaction of CO 2 with the methyl groups of the bipyridine ligand that is common to both systems. To verify the interaction of the CO 2 with the methyl groups, we performed Raman spectroscopy on CO 2 adsorption in 1′ and the results are summarized in Figure 9 . A weak band (as compared to the MMOF vibrations) observed at 1379 cm − 1 is attributed to the symmetric stretch of adsorbed CO 2 , and is red-shifted by ca. –9 cm − 1 from the unperturbed CO 2 symmetric stretch at 1388 cm − 1 . After introducing CO 2 in this MMOF, the only framework vibration that is affected is a mode at 1416 cm − 1 that is associated with the pyridyl-ring-stretch mode. A blue shift to 1423 cm − 1 suggests that, by interacting with the CH 3 , the CO 2 molecules induce a constraint on the pyridyl ring. The Raman data therefore support the hypothesis that the adsorp- tion of the CO 2 is close to the methyl groups, pointing towards their important role in the enhanced CO 2 uptake. 3. Conclusions We have synthesized and structurally characterized two methyl-functionalized metal-organic frameworks, Zn(BDC)(DMBPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 0.5 (H 2 O) 0.5 ( 1 ) and Zn(NDC) (DMBPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 2 ( 2 ), and carried out a systematic study to investigate and understand the effect of ligand function- alization on the gas adsorption of these MMOFs. Two parent structures, Zn(BDC)(BPY) 0.5 · (DMF)(H 2 O) 0.5 ( 3 ) and Zn(NDC) (BPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 1.575 ( 4 ), were also prepared and investigated for comparison.

After cooling to room temperature, excess 2-methylpyridine was removed by use of high vacuum. The residue was chromatographed on a silica column with EtOAc to yield a yellow product, which was further puriﬁ ed by recrystallization from n-hexane/petroleum ether (10:2).

Zn(BDC)(DMBPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 0.5 (H 2 O) 0.5 (1): A mixture of Zn(NO 3 ) · 6H 2 O (147 mg, 0.5 mmol), H 2 BDC (83 mg, 0.5 mmol), and 2,2’-DMBPY (55 mg, 0.3 mmol) in DMF (12 mL) was sealed in a Parr pressure bomb and heated at 100 ° C for 2 days. After naturally cooling to room temperature, light-yellow block-shaped crystals were isolated by ﬁ ltration, then washed with DMF and dried in air. (Yield: 70% based on the metal).

The product was isolated by ﬁ ltration and washed with DMF three times, then dried in air. (Yield: 80% based on the metal).

Zn(NDC)(BPY) 0.5 · (DMF) 1.575 (4) : Compound 4 was prepared according to a literature procedure. [ 14b ] (Yield: 77% based on the metal). Crystal-Structure Determination : The single-crystal diffraction data of compound 2 was collected at 110 K on a Bruker Smart CCD diffractometer using a graphite-monochromated MoK α radiation ( λ = 0.71073 Å) source in a cold nitrogen stream. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁ ned by full-matrix least-squares on F 2 using the Bruker SHELXTL package. For 2 , a total of 10765 reﬂ ections were collected (3785 unique, R (int) = 0.0617) between a q value of 1.92–24.99 ° .

Crystallographic data for the structures reported in this paper have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as supplementary publication no. CCDC-829073. PXRD Analysis : Powder X-ray diffraction experiments were conducted using a D/M-2200T automated system (Ultima + , Rigaku) with Cu K α radiation ( λ = 1.5406 Å). The PXRD patterns were collected between 2 θ angles of 3 ° –50 ° at a scan rate of 5 ° · min − 1 . A graphite monochromator was used and the generator power settings were 40 kV and 40 mA. The PXRD patterns of the simulated, as-made and degassed samples of 1 – 4 are shown in Figures S3-S6, respectively. Thermogravimetric Analysis : The thermal properties of the compounds were evaluated using a TA Instruments Q50 TG unit. The samples (ca. 10 mg) were loaded onto a sample pan and heated from room temperature to 600 ° C at a rate of 10 ° C · min − 1 under N 2 (ﬂ ow and purge rates of 40 mL · min − 1 and 60 mL · min − 1 , respectively). The TG proﬁ les for all three compounds are given in Figures S7–S10. Gas-Adsorption Experiments : All gas-sorption experiments were performed on a volumetric gas-sorption analyzer (Autosorb-1-MP, Quantachrome Instruments). Liquid nitrogen was used as coolant to achieve cryogenic temperatures (77 K). Ultrahigh purity H 2 , N 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , and CH 4 were used in the adsorption study. The N 2 -sorption isotherms were collected in a relative pressure range from 10 − 6 to 1 atm at 77 K, respectively. The initial degassing process for each sample was carried out at 373 K under vacuum overnight. Degassed samples of ca. 85–90 mg were used for gas-sorption measurements and the weight of each sample was recorded before and after degassing to conﬁ rm the removal of guest molecules and to ensure the framework integrity. The degassing procedure was repeated on the same sample between experiments for ca. 0.5–1 hour. Pore properties (e.g. pore volume, pore size, and surface decrease in surface area and pore size upon the introduction of methyl group. Low-temperature H 2 -adsorption data show the uptake correlates with the values of surface area and pore volume. However, despite the decreased surface area and pore volume, the activated BDC compound 1′ demonstrates a greatly enhanced CO 2 adsorption capacity over its parent compound 3′ . Such an enhanced CO 2 afﬁ nity can be attributed primarily to the stronger interactions between the framework and CO 2 molecules induced by the methyl group, which is conﬁ rmed by the signiﬁ cantly increased isosteric heats of CO 2 adsorption cal- culated from adsorption isotherms and in agreement with the theoretical calculations. The low loading values are in the range of the highest Q st reported to date. For the NDC compounds, 2′ has higher heats of CO 2 adsorption over 4′ for the entire loading range, but the extent of enhancement is less than in the case of 1′ . The overall effect leads to a slightly reduced uptake amount of CO 2 in 2′ . This study presents an interesting case that reveals how two opposing and competitive factors caused by methyl addition may affect the overall CO 2 adsorption behavior. The IR data at low CO 2 loading show similar interactions of the CO 2 with 1′ and 2′ . Furthermore, at higher CO 2 loading, the Raman data present indirect evidence for the CO 2 interaction with the methyl groups in 1′ . All four compounds exhibit high CO 2 /N 2 separation ratios, based on their single-component isotherm data, which ranks them among the MMOFs with the highest reported values. 4. Experimental Section Materials : All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources (Alfa Aesar, Acros, Aldrich, or TCI) and used as received. The ligand DMBPY was synthesized according to the literature without modiﬁ cation. [ 21 ] Synthesis : 2,2′-Dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridine (DMBPY): Sodium (1 g, 44 mmol) was added to drying 2-methylpyridine (80 mL) in very small pieces under stirring and purged with N 2 . The reaction was kept at room temperature for 48 hours to dissolve the sodium, and the solution color turned to deep blue. Consumption of the sodium was completed Figure 9 .

The hydrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected in the pressure range from 10 − 4 to 1 atm at 77 K, respectively. Temperature-dependent adsorption–desorption isotherms of CO 2 (273 K, 288, and 298 K) on 1′ – 4′ were collected from 10 − 3 to 1 atm and are depicted in Figure S11. Plots in Figure S13 are isotherms of CO 2 in compounds 1′ – 4′ compared with those of other selected small gases (298 K and up to 1 atm). IR and Raman Experiment : IR-absorption-spectroscopy measurements were performed in transmission at room temperature using a liquid- N 2 -cooled InSb detector. Approximately 12 mg samples were pressed onto a KBr support and mounted into a high-temperature high-pressure cell (Specac P/NH 5850c). Raman-spectroscopy measurements were performed using a 532 nm solid-state laser. The activated sample was loaded into a Linkam FTIR600 cooling/heating stage. A laser power of ca. 10% was used to avoid degradation of the sample under the beam. Supporting Information Supporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author.
