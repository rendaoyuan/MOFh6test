Two one-dimensional (1D) germanium(IV) coordination polymers (CPs) containing macrocyclic tetraaza[14]annulene, [Ge(tmtaa)(L)] n [tmtaa=tetraaza[14]annulene, L=1,4-benezedicarboxylate 1; 2,5-dihydroxyl-1,4-benezedicarboxylate, 2], are synthesized and characterized. The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity (σ) for 1 or 2 indicates region of rising dσ/dT (the conductivity increases with increasing temperature), suggesting semiconductor-like charge transport in the stacking direction. The room temperature electrical conductivities for 1 and 2 are 1.52×10−8 Scm−1 and 1.18×10−5 Scm−1, respectively, which are obviously higher than those of most 1D metallophthalocyanine- and metalloporphyrine-containing CPs. Though the crystal structures of 1 and 2 are similar, 2 exhibits better electrical conductivity which is about three orders higher than that of 1. This may be due to the protonic conduction existing in 2. Furthermore, 1 and 2 show outstanding thermal stability. These results suggest the potential applications of 1 and 2 as semiconductive materials.

Keywords Germanium(IV) Tetraaza[14]annulene Coordination polymer Crystal structure Semiconductor Protonic conduction The property investigations of coordination polymer (CP) which is currently one of the hottest topics in inorganic and supramolecular chemistry are focused on the fields of catalysis [1,2], spin-crossover [3,4], luminescence [5,6], absorption [7,8], non-linear optics [9,10], as well as conductivity [11]. Electrical conductivity of polymers continues to be one of the most important research areas in materials science. However, being different from the classical covalent conducting polymers which have attracted many researching interests [12–14], the investigation of the electrical conductivity in CPs has not been carried out extensively. Nevertheless, with the development of nanotechnology and theoretical calculation in recent years, more and more electrical conductive CPs have been reported [11]. Though two- [15] and three-dimensional [16] (2D and 3D, respectively) electrical conductive CPs have also been presented, one-dimensional (1D) ones show greater investigating interest, because 1D electron–electron or electron–lattice correlated systems can be constructed more easily. Furthermore, the electronic structures of 1D electrical conductive CPs can be lightly controlled by varying their constituents, e.g. the metal ions or metal complex fragments, the organic or inorganic bridging ligands, and so on. 1D electrical conductive CPs containing the metallomacrocycles such as metallo-phthalocyanine (Pc) [17,18] and porphyrine (Por) [19] [MPc/Por(L)] n (M=metal, L=bridging ligand) have long been studied as potential electrical conductors. The conductivity of these 1D CPs depends on the stacked co-facial arrangement allowing electron delocalization by π–π overlapping. However, because of the poor π–π overlapping between the adjacent macrocycles [20], [MPc/Por(L)] n usually shows low electrical conductivities in the range of 10−11–10−13 Scm−1 [21,22]. Herein, as extension of the investigation on 1D electrical conductive CPs containing the metallomacrocycles, we present two new 1D germanium(IV) CPs [Ge(tmtaa)(L)] n [L=1,4-benezedicarboxylate (1,4-bdc), 1; 2,5-dihydroxyl-1,4-benezedicarboxylate (2,5-dh-1,4-bdc), 2] containing the well-known non-planar saddle-shaped macrocycle tmtaa (H2tmtaa=tetraaza[14]annulene ligand) [23,24]. The properties of the tmtaa's derivatives on which potential applications may be based have been widely investigated on the fields of catalyst, sensor, liquid crystal material, corrosive inhibitor and DNA/RNA binding agent [25–30] except electrical conductor. Nevertheless, 1 and 2 reported in this work show notable semiconducting property and outstanding thermal stability. Furthermore, 2 is expected to exhibit a scarce protonic conduction. CPs 1 and 2 were synthesized as described in Scheme 1 [31,32]. Because the conductivity of metallomacrocycle-containing 1D CPs depends on the stacked arrangement, it is greatly significative to determine the single crystal structures of these polymers for conductive property investigation. Regretfully, to our best knowledge, most of the linear and rod-like structures of 1D Pc and Por CPs are structurally characterized by the powder X-ray diffraction studies, whereas the single crystal structures of tmtaa-containing 1D CPs 1 and 2 are determined by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction in this work. The single crystals of 1 and 2 were obtained by a layering method and the bulk powders of them could be obtained faster by the direct stirring reactions of Ge(tmtaa)Cl2 [33] with disodium 1,4-benezedicarboxylate and disodium 2,5-dihydroxyl-1,4-benezedicarboxylate, respectively. For metallomacrocycle-containing 1D CPs, a variety of possible spatial stacked arrangements [20] are assumed as shown in Fig. 1 . Obviously, the π–π overlapping degrees of the arrangements should be in the order of a>b>c because a is most favorable for the formation of a conduction band by π–π overlap. Judging from the low electrical conductivities, [MPc/Por(L)] n is supposed to very rarely crystallize in the stacked arrangement illustrated in Fig. 1a. The packing diagrams of 1 and 2 are shown in Figs. 2 . 1 and 2 show similar stacked arrangements with the adjacent Ge(tmtaa) units being connected by the 1,4-bdc and 2,5-dh-1,4-bdc bridging ligands to form independent 1D stepwise chains. Some tmtaa dimers in which two tmtaa units rotate with respect to each other by about 90° and two benzenoid rings in two tmtaa units which are in the face-to-face configuration have been reported [34–36]. Because of the non-planar saddle-shaped conformation of tmtaa, these dimmers adopt the above-mentioned arrangement to overcome the steric hindrance existing between two tmtaa units. In 1 and 2, adjacent tmtaa units are also in the face-to-face or back-to-back configuration, while do not rotate with respect to each other and the benzenoid ring couples in the tmtaa units are almost in the same direction. This may be due to the long bridging ligands reducing the steric hindrance between two adjacent tmtaa units. Both 1 and 2 crystallize in the triclinic space group P [37] and the partial ORTEP drawings of them, containing two Ge(tmtaa) units, respectively, are illustrated in Fig. 3 . Being similar to in monomer and dimer, tmtaa unit in 1 or 2 also keeps the specific saddle-shaped configuration. The central metal is coordinated to four N atoms of the tmtaa ligand and two O atoms of the bridging ligands to form a six-coordinated conformation which makes the Ge atoms only displace 0.013 and 0.012Å from the N4 planes toward the benzenoid faces of tmtaa in 1 and 2, respectively. Two O atoms connecting with the Ge atoms are almost vertical to the N4 planes and all N4 planes are parallel to each other. The Ge―O1 and Ge―O3 bond distances range from 1.938 to 1.983Å in 1 and from 1.962 to 1.971Å in 2 with the O1―Ge―O3 bond angles of 172.54 and 173.21°, respectively. The interplanar spacings between two neighboring N4 planes are 10.952 and 11.092Å in 1 and 2, respectively. Because of these structural properties, 1 and 2 exhibit outstanding thermal stability with the decomposition temperatures of 356 and 334°C, respectively [SI], which are advantageous to the conducting ability of semiconductor. The extent of the through-space electronic interactions between macrocyclic rings within the CPs 1 and 2 have been analyzed indirectly by examination of discrete compounds using electrochemical measurements. Four-probe direct current electrical conductivity measurements were obtained for pressed-pellet powder compactions of 1 and 2 from 200 to 300K (Fig. 4 ). The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity (σ) for 1 or 2 indicates region of rising dσ/dT (the conductivity increases with increasing temperature), suggesting semiconductor-like charge transport in the stacking direction [38]. The room temperature (293K) electrical conductivities for 1 and 2 are 1.52×10−8 Scm−1 and 1.18×10−5 Scm−1, respectively, which are obviously higher than those of most 1D [MPc/Por(L)] n CPs without the external oxidative doping [39,40]. Although the π–π overlapping degrees of the adjacent tmtaa units in 1 and 2 are not as strict as the arrangement illustrated in Fig. 1a, they should be higher than that of the zigzag structure showed in Fig. 1b, leading to the notable conductivities of 1 and 2. Short bridging ligands being advantageous to the π-electron transfer between the adjacent macrocyclic units are required for a good conductivity in the metallomacrocycle-containing 1D CPs [11]. However, it is difficult to construct 1D tmtaa CPs containing short bridging ligand, such as oxalate. This may be due to the non-planar saddle-shaped structure of tmtaa which can cause the steric hindrance between the adjacent tmtaa units. Thus, overcoming this steric hindrance is the key point for construction of the 1D tmtaa CPs. Furthermore, the conductivity of 1D metallomacrocycle-containing CPs also depends on the interaction of the metal d-orbitals with the π* level of the bridging ligands. Better π-bonding metals and more π-acidic ligands lead to greater conductivity. In this work, 1,4-bdc and 2,5-dh-1,4-bdc, which have not been reported in the construction of 1D [MPc/Por(L)] n CPs, are selected to assemble 1D tmtaa CPs 1 and 2 showing remarkable semiconducting property. Interestingly, although 1 and 2 have the similar structures and the distance between two adjacent N4 planes in 2 is slightly longer than that in 1, the electrical conductivity of 2 (σ 2 ) at room temperature is about three orders higher than that of 1 (σ 1 ). This may be derived to the hydroxyl groups in the bridging ligands of 2. The protons in ―OH groups can move to result sequentially in proton polarizability, which can augment the conducting ability of 2. Thus, in 2, collective proton motion evidently raises the protonic conductive probability in the stacked arrangement. The σ 2 is in principle the sum of the protonic (σ p) and electronic (σ e) contributions. Judging from the onefold electronic σ 1 which is approximate to σ e of 2, σ p should be greatly higher than σ e in 2. Furthermore, σ p of 2 is comparable to those of some proton-conducting materials with carboxylic acid functional groups (10−5–10−6 Scm−1) [41]. Thus, 2 is a scarce, however, very forceful example of the proton conductivity in CPs. In summary, we have synthesized and characterized two 1D Ge(IV) CPs of tetraaza[14]annulene, expanding the researching field of metallomacrocycle-containing CPs. Both 1 and 2 show notable semiconducting property. Though the crystal structures of 1 and 2 are similar, 2 exhibits better electrical conductivity which is about three orders higher than that of 1. This may be due to the protonic conduction existing in 2. Furthermore, 1 and 2 show outstanding thermal stability. These results suggest the potential applications of 1 and 2 as semiconductive materials. Further investigations on preparing the tmtaa-containing CPs with higher electrical conductivity are currently in progress.
