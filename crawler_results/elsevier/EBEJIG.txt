Based on a strategy of introducing the inorganic SCN− group into CdX2-organoamine system, three organically modified Cd(II) compounds as 1-D [H2dmpip][CdCl3(SCN)] (dmpip= N,N´-Dimethylpiperazine) 1, 2-D [Cd(SCN)2(dach)] (dach=1,4-Diazacycloheptane) 2 and mononuclear [CdI3(Hdach)] 3 were obtained in H2O/C2H5OH solutions under ambient conditions. X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis revealed that compound 1 is diprotonated dmpip-templated chained cadmium-chloro thiocyanate, compound 2 is the first example of dach-extended layered cadmium-thiocyanato coordination polymer, and compound 3 is monoprotonated dach-coordinated mononuclear cadmium iodide. The photoluminescence analysis indicates that the title three compounds are the potential fluorescence materials. Graphical abstract By introducing inorganic anionic group SCN− into CdX2-organoamine system in H2O/C2H5OH solutions, three new organically modified Cd(II) compounds [H2dmpip][CdCl3(SCN)] 1, [Cd(SCN)2(dach)] 2 and [CdI3(Hdach)] 3 (dmpip= N,N'-Dimethylpiperazine, dach=1,4-Diazacycloheptane) were obtained by room-temperature self-assemblies.

Keywords Halocadmate Coordination polymer Self-assembly Organic amine Fluorescence The study on structure chemistry of organically modified metal halides has attracted considerable attention due to their fascinating structures [1–5] and the potential applications in optics [6–8], electrochemistry [9], electrical conductivity [10], magnetism [11] and catalysis [12]. By the simple self-assembles between metal halides and organic amines, lots of organically modified metal halides have been successfully obtained during the past three decades. According to the existing form of organic amines in the compounds, the obtained metal halides can be divided into two classes: organically templated halometallate and organically coordinated metal halide. In general, the former is synthesized in acidic environment, whereas the later is synthesized in neutral or alkalescent environment. The current investigation for our group is focused on the reactions of the incorporation of inorganic SCN− group into CdX2-organoamine system. The latest research results include the 1-D [H2pip][CdCl3(SCN)]⋅ 2H2O (pip=piperazine), [H2dabco]2[Cd3Cl8(SCN)2] H2O (dabco=1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane) [13], [H2pip]4[Cd3Br8(SCN)2(SO4)2(H2O)] 4H2O as well as [CdX(SCN)L] (X=Br−, I−; L=SC(OC2H5)=NH2) [14]. In this article, two organic amines as dmpip and dach were selected, and three new organically modified Cd(II) compounds [H2dmpip][CdCl3(SCN)] 1, [Cd(SCN)2(dach)] 2 and [CdI3(Hdach)] 3 were fortunately obtained at different pH levels. The title compounds were obtained by the room-temperature self-assemblies [15]. X-ray analysis [16] revealed that compound 1 is H2dmpip2+-templated chained cadmium-chloro thiocyanate. SCN− was successfully mixed into the framework of the chlorocadmate. Compound 1 crystallizes in space group Pnma. The asymmetric unit is found to be composed of 0.5 Cd(II) atom, two types of Cl− ions (occupancy ratio: 0.5 for Cl1, 1 for Cl2), 0.5 SCN− group and 0.5 H2dmpip2+ molecule. As shown in Fig. 1 , the 1-D chain structure of compound 1 can be described as an infinite extension of the Cd(II) octahedra via sharing the edges. The crystallographically unique Cd1 center in the chain lies in a distorted octahedral environment, coordinated by five Cl− ions and one thiocynato N atom. The equatorial plane for Cd octahedron is occupied by four symmetric related μ2-modes Cl2 ions (Cl2, Cl2a, Cl2b, Cl2c), whereas the axis is occupied by the terminal Cl1 ion and the SCN− N atom (N2). The Cd-N(CS) bond length of 2.240(6) Å is comparable with that found in reported compound [H2pip]4[Cd3Br8(SCN)2(SO4)2(H2O)] ⋅ 4H2O [14]. The Cd-Cl (μ2) distances from 2.7347(9) to 2.7636(9) Å are slightly longer than that of the Cd-Cl (terminal) (2.567(2) Å). The cis-angles from 84.68(3)o to 94.2(1)o indicate the octahedral Cd(II) is severely distorted. The terminal Cl ion and the SCN− group satisfy mainly the coordination of the Cd(II) center. The symmetric related μ2-mode Cl2 ions bi-bridge the Cd(II) centers into a 1-D endless chain based on the Cd2Cl2 dimers. Cl1 and SCN− adopt the trans-mode arrangement, so the chain is linear, not zigzag. The Cd2Cl2 ring is not planar with a dihedral angle of 165o(plane 1: Cd1, Cd1d, Cl2; plane 2: Cd1, Cd1d, Cl2a). The Cd⋅⋅⋅Cd separation in the dimer is 3.9491(7) Å. Through the intermolecular weak N⋅⋅⋅Cl interactions (N1⋅⋅⋅Cl1e=3.095Å; N1⋅⋅⋅Cl2f=3.433Å, e: x +0.5, y, z +0.5; f: x +1, y, z), the 1-D chains are propagated into the 3-D supramolecular network as shown in Fig. S1. The nearest S⋅⋅⋅S contact is 4.352Å, revealing no weak S⋅⋅⋅S interactions are found in compound 1. The title compounds were obtained by the room-temperature self-assemblies [15]. X-ray analysis [16] revealed that compound 1 is H2dmpip2+-templated chained cadmium-chloro thiocyanate. SCN− was successfully mixed into the framework of the chlorocadmate. Compound 1 crystallizes in space group Pnma. The asymmetric unit is found to be composed of 0.5 Cd(II) atom, two types of Cl− ions (occupancy ratio: 0.5 for Cl1, 1 for Cl2), 0.5 SCN− group and 0.5 H2dmpip2+ molecule. As shown in Fig. 1, the 1-D chain structure of compound 1 can be described as an infinite extension of the Cd(II) octahedra via sharing the edges. The crystallographically unique Cd1 center in the chain lies in a distorted octahedral environment, coordinated by five Cl− ions and one thiocynato N atom. The equatorial plane for Cd octahedron is occupied by four symmetric related μ2-mode Cl2 ions (Cl2, Cl2a, Cl2b, Cl2c), whereas the axis is occupied by the terminal Cl1 ion and the SCN− N atom (N2). The Cd-N(CS) bond length of 2.240(6) Å is comparable with that found in reported compound [H2pip]4[Cd3Br8(SCN)2(SO4)2(H2O)] 4H2O [14]. The Cd-Cl (μ2) distances from 2.7347(9) to 2.7636(9) Å are slightly longer than that of the Cd-Cl (terminal) (2.567(2) Å). The cis-angles from 84.68(3)o to 94.2(1)o indicate the octahedral Cd(II) is severely distorted. The terminal Cl ion and the SCN− group satisfy mainly the coordination of the Cd(II) center. The symmetric related μ2-mode Cl2 ions bi-bridge the Cd(II) centers into a 1-D endless chain based on the Cd2Cl2 dimers. Cl1 and SCN− adopt the trans-mode arrangement, so the chain is linear, not zigzag. The Cd2Cl2 ring is not planar with a dihedral angle of 165o(plane 1: Cd1, Cd1d, Cl2; plane 2: Cd1, Cd1d, Cl2a). The Cd⋅⋅⋅Cd separation in the dimer is 3.9491(7) Å. Through the intermolecular weak N⋅⋅⋅Cl interactions (N1⋅⋅⋅Cl1e=3.095Å; N1⋅⋅⋅Cl2f=3.433Å, e: x +0.5, y, z +0.5; f: x +1, y, z), the 1-D chains are propagated into the 3-D supramolecular network as shown in Fig. S1. The nearest S⋅⋅⋅S contact is 4.352Å, revealing no weak S⋅⋅⋅S interactions are found in compound 1. Compound 2 is the first example of dach-extended 2-D layered cadmium-thiocyanato coordination polymer. In previously reported complexes, dach generally acts as the chelating-type ligand [17,18]. Compound 2 crystallizes in space group P21/m, and the asymmetric unit is found to be composed of 0.5 Cd(II) atom, one SCN− group and 0.5 dach molecule. Fig. 2 illustrates the 2-D layer structure of compound 2. The crystallographically independent Cd(II) center with an octahedral geometry is coordinated by two thiocynato N atoms (N2a, N2b), two thiocynato S atom (S1, S1c) and two dach N atoms (N1, N1c). The Cd-N(CS) bond length of 2.327(5) Å is slightly shorter than that of the Cd-Ndach (2.382(6) Å). The Cd-S distance of 2.754(2) Å is comparable with that observed in reported compound [Cd(SCN)2(1,4-btzb)] (1,4-btzb=1,4-bis(tetrazol-1-yl)butane) [19]. The distortion of the octahedral Cd(II) characterized by the cis-angles of 87.7(1)–92.3(1)o is not severe, compared with the situation in compound 1. Co-bridged by SCN− and dach, compound 2 shows a 2-D layer structure. Along the a-axial direction, the symmetric related SCN− groups with the N and S donors bi-bridge the Cd(II) center into a 1-D infinite Cd(SCN)2 chain with 8-merbermed Cd2(SCN)2 loops. Along the b-axial direction, the dach molecules as the bridges further extend the inorganic Cd(SCN)2 chains into the title 2-D layer of compound 2. Although the Cd(SCN)2 chain have been found in some reported cadmium-thiocynato coordination polymers [19–21], the chain in compound 2 exhibits some differences. In reported compounds, the Cd2(SCN)2 rings generally adopt the chair-mode configuration, and the mean deviation from the least-squares plane is generally larger (ca. 0.7Å). But in compound 2, obviously, the configuration exhibited by Cd2(SCN)2 ring is not chair-mode, and eight atom is nearly co-planar with each other (the corresponding mean deviation of 0.0767Å) (see Fig. S2 for better understanding). The Cd⋅⋅⋅Cd contact in Cd2(SCN)2 ring is 5.974Å. Fig. S3 gives the projection plot of compound 2 in (100) direction. The 2-D sheet displays a wave-like pattern. This may be due to the special structure of the dach molecule. No weak molecular interactions as C-H⋅⋅⋅I and S⋅⋅⋅S interactions are observed between the layers. Compound 2 is the first example of dach-extended 2-D layered cadmium-thiocyanato coordination polymer. In previously reported complexes, dach generally acts as the chelating-type ligand [17,18]. Compound 2 crystallizes in space group P21/m, and the asymmetric unit is found to be composed of 0.5 Cd(II) atom, one SCN− group and 0.5 dach molecule. Fig. 2illustrates the 2-D layer structure of compound 2. The crystallographically independent Cd(II) center with an octahedral geometry is coordinated by two thiocynato N atoms (N2a, N2b), two thiocynato S atom (S1, S1c) and two dach N atoms (N1, N1c). The Cd-N(CS) bond length of 2.327(5) Å is slightly shorter than that of the Cd-Ndach (2.382(6) Å). The Cd-S distance of 2.754(2) Å is comparable with that observed in reported compound [Cd(SCN)2(1,4-btzb)] (1,4-btzb=1,4-bis(tetrazol-1-yl)butane) [19]. The distortion of the octahedral Cd(II) characterized by the cis-angles of 87.7(1)–92.3(1)o is not severe, compared with the situation in compound 1. Co-bridged by SCN− and dach, compound 2 shows a 2-D layer structure. Along the a-axial direction, the symmetric related SCN− groups with the N and S donors bi-bridge the Cd(II) center into a 1-D infinite Cd(SCN)2 chain with 8-merbermed Cd2(SCN)2 loops. Along the b-axial direction, the dach molecules as the bridges further extend the inorganic Cd(SCN)2 chains into the title 2-D layer of compound 2. Although the Cd(SCN)2 chain have been found in some reported cadmium-thiocynato coordination polymers [19–21], the chain in compound 2 exhibits some differences. In reported compounds, the Cd2(SCN)2 rings generally adopt the chair-mode configuration, and the mean deviation from the least-squares plane is generally larger (ca. 0.7Å). But in compound 2, obviously, the configuration exhibited by Cd2(SCN)2 ring is not chair-mode, and eight atom is nearly co-planar with each other (the corresponding mean deviation of 0.0767Å) (see Fig. S2 for better understanding). The Cd⋅⋅⋅Cd contact in Cd2(SCN)2 ring is 5.974Å. Fig. S3 gives the projection plot of compound 2 in (100) direction. The 2-D sheet displays a wave-like pattern. This may be due to the special structure of the dach molecule. No weak molecular interactions as C-H⋅⋅⋅I and S⋅⋅⋅S interactions are observed between the layers. Compound 3 is Hdach+-coordinated mononuclear cadmium(II) iodide. Compounds 2 and 3 were prepared under the similar reaction conditions except that the pH levels are different. However, the I− ions were completely replaced by SCN− in the reaction of compound 2, while no any I− ion was replaced by SCN− in the reaction of compound 3. This may be due to the templating effect of monoprotonated dach. As shown in Fig. 3 , the crystallographically unique Cd1 center in a tetrahedral site is surrounded by three I− ions (I1, I2, I3) and one dach N atom (N1). The Cd1-N1 distance of 2.331(4) Å is normal. The Cd1-I bond lengths of 2.7439(5)–2.7696(5) Ǻ are basically in agreement with those observed in reported compound [Cu(phen)2CdI4] [22]. The angles associated with the Cd1 center are 99.2(1)–116.86(2)o. As shown in Fig. S4, the I2 atom as the donor forms the hydrogen bond to the H atom attached to N1a (a: x −0.5, −y −0.5, −z +1) with the I2⋅⋅⋅N1a contact of 3.793Ǻ. Through this kind of weak interaction, the molecular units self-assemble into the 1-D castellated hydrogen-bonded chain, extending along the a-axial direction. Compound 3 is Hdach+-coordinated mononuclear cadmium(II) iodide. Compounds 2 and 3 were prepared under the similar reaction conditions except that the pH levels are different. However, the I− ions were completely replaced by SCN− in the reaction of compound 2, while no any I− ion was replaced by SCN− in the reaction of compound 3. This may be due to the templating effect of monoprotonated dach. As shown in Fig. 3, the crystallographically unique Cd1 center in a tetrahedral site is surrounded by three I− ions (I1, I2, I3) and one dach N atom (N1). The Cd1-N1 distance of 2.331(4) Å is normal. The Cd1-I bond lengths of 2.7439(5)–2.7696(5) Å are basically in agreement with those observed in reported compound [Cu(phen)2CdI4] (phen=1,10-phenanthroline). The angles associated with the Cd1 center are 99.2(1)–116.86(2)o. As shown in Fig. S4, the I2 atom as the donor forms the hydrogen bond to the H atom attached to N1a (a: x −0.5, −y −0.5, −z +1) with the I2⋅⋅⋅N1a contact of 3.793Å. Through this kind of weak interaction, the molecular units self-assemble into the 1-D castellated hydrogen-bonded chain, extending along the a-axial direction. By a comparison of the structure for dach molecule in compounds 2 and 3, we can find the reason that dach could act as the different roles upon coordination to the metal center. In compound 3, ∠N1-C1-C2, ∠C1-C2-C3 and ∠C2-C3-N2 are 115.8(5)o, 115.0(6)o and 117.9(5)o, respectively. The corresponding angles in compound 2 are basically comparable with those in compound 3: ∠N1-C1-C2=115.9(6)o, ∠C1-C2-C1e=114.2(7)o. However, the arrangement of the remaining two C atoms for dach molecule in both compounds is different. In compound 3, the N1-C5-C4 and C5-C4-N2 angles are 115.1(5)o and 114.0(5) o, respectively, whereas in compound 2, the N1-C3-C3e angle is 140.0(5)o. Obviously, the tetrahedra for these two C atoms are prone to be distorted. The increase of the angle from ca. 115oto ca. 140oleads to the increase of the N⋅⋅⋅N distance from 3.236Å to 3.352Å, so dach can act as the bridging role in the complex. The structure of dach in compound 3 should be similar to that of dach molecule. When dach acts as the chelating role in the complex, these two angles should be smaller than ca. 114 o, thus the N⋅⋅⋅N distance will shorten (see Figs. 2 and 3 for better understanding). The existing forms of dach and SCN− in the complexes could be preliminarily known by the Infrared (IR) spectrum. As shown in Fig. S5, the sharp peaks (νN–H) at 3264cm− for compound 2 and at 3227cm− for compound 3 indicate dach exists either in nonprotonated form or in monoprotonated form in the complexes. Once it is diprotonated, this peak will disappear. This conclusion has been discussion in previous report [13]. The sharp peak at 2090cm− for compound 1 suggests the SCN− group acts as the terminal ligand, while it is bridged in compound 2 with the sharp peak at 2112cm− [23,24]. The existing forms of dach and SCN− in the complexes could be preliminarily known by the Infrared (IR) spectrum. As shown in Fig. S5, the sharp peaks (νN–H) at 3264cm–1 for compound 2 and at 3227cm–1 for compound 3 indicate dach exists either in nonprotonated form or in monoprotonated form in the complexes. Once it is diprotonated, this peak will disappear. This conclusion has been discussed in previous report [13]. The sharp peak at 2090cm–1 for compound 1 suggests the SCN− group acts as the terminal ligand, while it is bridged in compound 2 with the sharp peak at 2112cm–1 [23,24]. Fig. S7 is the X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder patterns of compounds 1 and 2. The experimental XRD powder pattern for each compound is in accord with the simulated one generated on the basis of structural data, confirming that the as-synthesized products are pure phase. Fig. S7 is the X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder patterns of compounds 1 and 2. The experimental XRD powder pattern for each compound is in accord with the simulated one generated on the basis of structural data, confirming that the as-synthesized products are pure phase. The liquid-state photoluminescence properties of the title compounds in aqueous solutions are investigated. The liquid-state photoluminescence properties of CdCl2 and dach in aqueous solutions are also investigated in order to explain the emission mechanism of the title compounds. The corresponding emission spectra for all are given in Fig. 4 . Upon excitation, all of the title compounds exhibit the high-energy (HE) emissions with the maximum peaks at 358nm (λex =222nm) for compound 1, 385nm (λex =248nm) for compound 2 and 383nm (λex =260nm) for compound 3, respectively. The fluorescence emission of compound 1 should be attributed to Cl-to-Cd charge transfer, because the inorganic CdCl2 salt shows an identical emission (λex =222nm). The fluorescence emissions for compounds 2 and 3 should be assigned to the charge transfer of intra-dach ligand, since the organic dach molecule shows a similar emission at 390nm when excited at 260nm. In a word, we reported the structural characterization of three new organically modified Cd(II) compounds obtained by the room-temperature self-assemblies. It is noteworthy that compound 2 is the first example of dach-extended layered cadmium-thiocyanato coordination polymer. The photoluminescence analysis indicates that the title compounds are the potential fluorescence materials with the HE emissions.

The data were collected with Mo-Kα radiation (λ=0.71073 Å) on a Siemens SMART CCD diffractometer for compounds 1, 3 and on a RigakuR-AXIS RAPID IP diffractometer for compound 2. With SHELXTL program, compounds 1–3 were solved using direct methods, and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques. The non-hydrogen atoms were assigned anisotropic displacement parameters in the refinement, and the hydrogen atoms were treated using a riding model. The structure was then refined on F 2 using SHELXL-97. CCDC numbers are 824488–824490 for compounds 1–3, respectively. [17] S. Mukherjee P.S.
