Structural analysis indicates 1D zigzag chain for 1 while 2D grid network for 2. Magnetic investigation reveals that 1 behaves as a simple magnetic chain, while 2 is a ferrimagnet below 9K. Highlights ► Proving the importance of substituting group effect in the design of molecular magnets. ► Interesting 1D zigzag chain and 2D grid network. ► The long range ferrimagnetic ordering is observed. Two cyano-bridged dimetallic complexes derived from MnIII(Schiff-base) and [CrI(CN)5NO]3−, [Mn(3-CH3)salen]3[Cr(CN)5NO]·2.5H2O (1) and [Mn(5-CH3)salen]6[Cr(CN)5NO]2·2CH3OH·16H2O (2) [salen=N,N′-ethylenebis (salicylideneiminato)dianion] were synthesized and characterized. The reaction conditions of the two complexes are identical. The substituting group (CH3–) in the salen-type ligands gives different assembly styles for the two complexes, 1D zigzag chain for 1 while 2D grid network for 2. The magnetic investigation indicates the dominant antiferromagnetic interactions between the Mn(III) and Cr(I) mediated by the CN bridge. Due to the weak interchain antiferromagnetic interactions, no magnetic ordering phase was observed in complex 1. Interestingly, complex 2 showed the long range ferrimagnetic magnetic ordering with T c =9K, in contrast to 1. Furthermore, the hysteresis loop confirms the nature of complex 2 as soft ferrimagnet. Keywords Cyanido-bridged Ferrimagnet Magnetic properties Schiff-base 1 Introduction The constant attention paid on the molecular magnets in the past several decades is undoubtedly due to their potential applications in nano-devices such as molecular switches, high-density information storage, quantum computation and so on [1]. So far, enormous numbers of complexes having magnetic properties have been reported and various molecule-based magnets were discovered [2]. In magnetic complexes, the Prussian blue analogs have been shown to possess excellent magnetic properties ranging from low dimensional magnets [2g,3] to room-temperature bulk magnets [4]. Prussian blue building blocks [MIII(CN)6]3− (M=Cr, Fe) [5] have been used frequently; however, the paramagnetic building block [CrI(CN)5NO]3−, with a different electron configuration from [CrIII(CN)6]3− has been inactively explored to construct magnetic complexes [6]. Recently, several related complexes with different structures and interesting magnetic properties were reported by Kou and co-workers based on the [CrI(CN)5NO]3− and the well-known magnetic anisotropic precursors, MnIII(Schiff-base) [7] due to the change of the substituting group. Herein we report, by changing the position of CH3 in the salen-type ligands, two new structural styles of complexes, [Mn(3-CH3)salen]3[Cr(CN)5NO]2·5H2O (1) and [Mn(5-CH3)salen]6[Cr(CN)5NO]2·2CH3OH·16H2O (2), concerning MnIII(Schiff-base) and [CrI(CN)5NO]3− were obtained, in which complex 1 showed an 1D zigzag chain while complex 2 exhibited a 2D grid network. The magnetic investigation indicated the dominated antiferromagnetic interactions between the Mn(III) and Cr(I) mediated by the CN bridge. No magnetic ordering phase was observed in complex 1, due to the weak interchain antiferromagnetic interactions while complex 2 exhibited, the long range ferrimagnetic magnetic ordering with T c =9K. Additionally, the nature of the soft ferrimagnet for 2 was confirmed by hysteresis loop. These studies showed further evidence for the subtle effect caused by slight adjustment of the substituting group. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and physical measurement All experiments were carried out under air atmosphere in the dark. All chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade and used as purchased without any further purification. [Mn(3-CH3)salen·H2O]ClO4·H2O and [Mn(5-CH3)salen·H2O]ClO4·H2O were prepared according to the modified literature procedure [8]. K3[Cr(CN)5NO]·H2O was synthesized as described elsewhere [9]. Caution! KCN is toxic and hazardous while perchlorate salts of metal complexes are potentially explosive. So handling them carefully in small quantities is highly suggested for the safety consideration. Infrared spectra (400–4000cm−1) were obtained on a VECTOR 22 spectrometer using the KBr pellet. Elemental analyses of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen were carried out on a Perkin Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. Magnetic measurements on the microcrystalline sample were performed on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The corrections of measured susceptibilities were carried out considering both the sample holder as the background and the diamagnetism of the constituent atoms according to Pascal’s tables [10]. 2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 [Mn(3-CH3)salen]3[Cr(CN)5NO]·2.5H2O (1) A solution of K3[Cr(CN)5NO]·H2O (11.5mg, 0.033mmol) in 2.5mL water was added to a solution of [Mn(3-CH3)salen·H2O]ClO4·H2O (45.6mg, 0.1mmol) in 7.5mL 1:5 (v/v) methanol–acetonitrile with constant stirring, followed by the addition of 0.05mL triethylamine. The brown mixture was filtered and kept undisturbed in the dark. One week later, brown black block crystals of complex 1 suitable for X-ray diffraction were formed and collected carefully by filtration, washed with 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile–water, and dried at room temperature. Yield: 22.0mg, 51.8%. Anal. Calc. for C59H60CrMn3N12O9.5: C, 54.26; H, 4.63; N, 12.87. Found: C, 54.51; H, 4.89; N, 13.01%. Main IR bands (cm−1): 3418(s), 2111(m, υ CN), 1612(s, υ NO), 1554(m), 1481(w), 1290(m), 1142(s), 867(w). 2.2.2 [Mn(5-CH3)salen]6[Cr(CN)5NO]2·2CH3OH·16H2O (2) This complex was synthesized according to the procedure described for 1 with [Mn(5-CH3)salen·H2O]ClO4·H2O in place of [Mn(3-CH3)salen·H2O]ClO4·H2O. Brown rod shape crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were formed and collected carefully by filtration, washed with 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile–water, and dried at room temperature. Yield: 20.0mg, 42.1%. Anal. Calc. for C120H148Cr2Mn6N24O32: C, 50.18; H, 5.19; N, 11.70. Found: C, 50.48; H, 5.20; N, 11.90%. Main IR bands (cm−1): 3408(s), 2111(m, υ CN), 1627(s, υ NO), 1540(m), 1469(m), 1292(s), 1164(w), 809(m). 2.2.3 X-ray structure determination Single crystals with suitable dimensions for X-ray diffraction analyses were mounted on a glass fiber, the crystal data was collected with a Siemens (Bruker) SMART CCD diffractometer using monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073Å) at 293K. The method used to solve the structure was a direct method and the structure was further expanded using Fourier difference techniques with the shelxtl-97 program package [11]. Absorption corrections were carried out using the sadabs program [12]. The anisotropic refinement was applied for all non-hydrogen atoms while the hydrogen atoms were added geometrically and refined isotropically with fixed U values using a riding model. Details of the crystallographic data collection, structural determination and refinement are summarized in Table 1 . Selected bond distances and angles are collated in Tables 2 and 3 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization For the reaction of MnIII(Schiff-base) and [M(CN)6]3−, effects of the Schiff-base ligands as well as the subtle change in the reaction condition often result in completely different structural styles [13]. The phenomenon can be also observed when the paramagnetic building block [CrI(CN)5NO]3− was used [7]. Kou and co-workers reported four novel coordination complexes ranging from polynuclear to 1D and 2D based on MnIII(Schiff-base) and [CrI(CN)5NO]3− [7]. Interestingly, the synthetic procedure for all these complexes was the same except the different substituting group in the salen-type ligands. When [Mn(3-CH3)salen·H2O]ClO4·H2O and [Mn(5-CH3)salen·H2O]ClO4·H2O were allowed to react with [CrI(CN)5NO]3−, 1D zigzag neutral chain for 1 and 2D grid network for 2 were obtained. The subtle relationship of these reactions is illustrated in Scheme 1 . IR spectra of 1 and 2 (Fig. S1 in Supplementary data) exhibit characteristic absorptions at 2110–2130cm−1 for υ CN stretching vibration, which was slightly higher than the band of υ CN in K3[Cr(CN)5NO] (2095–2120cm−1) and was comparable to the reported analogs [7]. The shifting of the cyanide stretching to a higher wave number indicates the formation of M–CN–M′ bridging units. However, the υ NO stretching frequency of 1 and 2 (1612–1627cm−1) has not been significantly shifted to higher wave numbers compared with that of K3[Cr(CN)5NO] (1630cm−1), indicating the NO is terminal and not coordinated as a bridging group [6f]. 3.2 Crystal structures of 1 and 2 As shown in Fig. 1 , complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c, which consists of a neutral branched zigzag chain formed by repeated units of a [CrI(CN)5NO]3− and three [Mn(3-CH3)salen]+ motifs bridged by the cyanide ligands. One of three [Mn(3-CH3)salen]+ motifs (Mn1) makes up the main chain bridged by [CrI(CN)5NO]3− and the residual two motifs (Mn2 and Mn3) form the branch of the chain. Thus, [CrI(CN)5NO]3− provides four cyanide ligands coordinating to the [Mn(3-CH3)salen]+ units all along the axial direction of MnIII ions. In the chain, [CrI(CN)5NO]3− provides two neighboring cyanides coordinating to MnIII ions, which was different from the trans-coordination mode of cyanide groups found in [Mn3(salen)3(H2O)(CH3CN)Cr(CN)5(NO)]·0.5CH3CN·0.5MeOH·2H2O[7]. Mn1 was hexa-coordinated (MnN4O2) with an elongated octahedral environment due to the Jahn–Teller distortion [13], but the Mn2 and Mn3 metal centers were penta-coordinated (MnN3O2). The bond length of Mn1–Ncyano was from 2.258(5) to 2.323(5)Å, larger than that found for Mn2 [2.153(5)Å] and Mn3 [2.103(5)Å]. Different from the standard octahedral geometry of FeIII and CrIII ions in [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Cr(CN)6]3− [2g,3a], a shorter Cr1–N6 bond [1.686(6)Å] than the Cr–C distance [2.056(6)–2.094(7)Å] produces the compressed CrCN5 octahedral geometry [6]. The Cr–CN and Cr–NO bond angles are nearly linear [175.3(5)–178.6(5)°] while the Mn–NC bond angles exhibited significant deviations from the linearity (153.0(5)° for Mn1–N2–C1, 149.6(5)° for Mn1#–N4–C5 (symmetry operation #: 0.5− x, −0.5+ y, 0.5− z), 144.1(5)° for Mn2–C2–N3 and 143.4(5)° for Mn3–N1–C3), comparable to the reported literature [14]. The zigzag chain was running along b axis and significant interchain π–π stacking can be found for the short centroid distance (3.459(2)Å) between the nearest adjacent phenoxide rings of salen-type ligands (Fig. S2 in Supplementary data). The shortest intrachain metal–metal distance is 5.039(3)Å while the interchain metal–metal distance was even shorter, i.e. 4.207(4)Å. In comparison to complex 1, complex 2 has a 2D grid network as shown in Fig. 2 . Complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n and the asymmetric unit contains two [CrI(CN)5NO]3− and six [Mn(5-CH3)salen]+ units, in which Mn1, Mn2, Mn3 and Mn4 are axially coordinated to the cyanide ligands of [CrI(CN)5NO]3− to form the 2D grid network while Mn5 and Mn6 are axially coordinated by only water molecules acting as the counter cation between the anion layers. The structure of complex 2 was similar to that of [Mn(salen)]2[Fe(CN)5(NO)]3·H2O [15] but different from its 2D analog [{Mn(saltmen)}4Cr(CN)5(NO)]ClO4·3H2O [7]. Each MnIII ion in complex 2 was hexa-coordinated and has a distorted octahedral surrounding (MnN4O2 for Mn1, Mn2, Mn3 and Mn4, and MnN2O4 for Mn5 and Mn6) due to the Jahn–Teller effect for a high-spin d4 MnIII ion [13]. The bond length of Mn–Ncyano was from 2.238(5) to 2.391(5)Å. The shorter Cr–N bond [1.666(5)–1.692(5)Å] than the Cr–C distance (2.013(6)-2.115(7)Å) was in agreement with [Cr(CN)5(NO)]3− [6]. Similar to 1, the Cr–CN and Cr–NO bond angles were nearly linear (171.8(5)–178.7(6)°) while the Mn–NC bond angles exhibited significant deviation from linearity (132.2(5)–159.7(5)°). The formed 2D grid layers were parallel to the ab plane with the mononuclear [Mn(5-CH3)salen]+ unit located between the layers leading to their large separation with the shortest interlayer metal–metal distance of 19.09(1)Å. 3.3 Magnetic properties The magnetic data for complex 1 was collected in the range 1.8–300K under an applied magnetic field of 2kOe as plotted in Fig. 3 . The χ M T value per Mn3Cr for 1 at 300K is 8.71cm3 Kmol−1, which is smaller than the spin-only value (9.37cm3 Kmol−1) calculated from noncoupled three high-spin MnIII (S Mn =2) and one CrI (S Cr =1/2) ion assuming g =2. As temperature is lowered, the χ M T product decreases smoothly and reaches a minimum of 8.07cm3 Kmol−1 at about 50K. Below this temperature the χ M T value slightly increases to the maximum of 8.12cm3 Kmol−1 at about 28K, and then followed the sudden decrease to 2.12cm3 Kmol−1 at 1.8K. All the phenomena show the ferrimagnetic nature of complex 1, indicating that the dominant intrachain antiferromagnetic interaction takes place between MnIII and CrI mediated by cyanide bridges [6f,7,16]. From 50 to 28K the external field impacts on the net spins of Mn3Cr unit and overcomes the effect of kT leading to the spins aligning along the field, further to the slight increase of the χ M T value [10]. The decrease below 28K may be mainly ascribed to the antiferromagnetic interaction between chains, for which the further evidence can be found in the plot of χ M versus T (Fig. S3 in Supplementary data). A maximum was observed at around 2K, indicating the total ground state spin is zero for complex 1. The magnetic data of 1 between 50 and 300K obeys the Curie–Weiss law [χ M = C/(T − θ)], affording C =8.67cm3 Kmol−1, θ =−4.29K. The negative Weiss Constants are in agreement with the intrachain antiferromagnetic coupling for 1. To evaluate the exchange coupling between the MnIII and CrI ions, the modified magpack program [17] was used for the fitting of experimental χ M T value between 30 and 300K taking no account of zero-field splitting (ZFS) and the intermolecular interactions because they are relatively small in the high temperature region and can be neglected safely. As revealed by the structural analysis, the bond length of Mn1–Ncyano is the longest, so an approximate magnetic system is suggested regarding the chain as a repeating subunit of tetranuclear clusters (Mn3Cr) with the spin Hamiltonian Ĥ =−2(J 1 Ŝ Mn1 Ŝ Cr1 − J 2 Ŝ Mn2 Ŝ Cr1 − J 3 Ŝ Mn3 Ŝ Cr1) [18]. The intercluster interaction through Mn1–N4–C5–Cr1 is defined as J c in Scheme 2 . The best-fit parameters of complex 1 are J 1 =−1.22cm−1, J 2 =−0.92cm−1, J 3 =−0.72cm−1, J c =−0.01cm−1, g =1.99 and R = [ ( χ M T ) calcd - ( χ M T ) obsd ] 2 / ( χ M T ) obsd 2 = 5.18 × 10 - 4 . The fitting coupling constants indicate a weak antiferromagnetic interaction between MnIII and CrI mediated by cyanide bridges. It is worth mentioning that the large coupling constants (larger than −10cm−1) have been previously reported for the MnIII–NC–CrI systems [7]. The relatively weaker antiferromagnetic interaction for complex 1 may be due to the strong bending bonds of Mn–NC that diminishes the overlap of magnetic orbitals on adjacent metal ions and further weakens the antiferromagnetic contributions [7]. The field-dependent magnetization measured up to 70kOe at 1.8K has been depicted in the inset of Fig. 3. The experimental results lower than the calculated Brillouin curves based on three independent Mn(III) and one independent Cr(I) center point out the dominant antiferromagnetic nature of complex 1 [18b]. No obvious metamagnetic phenomenon [19] was observed in the low field, indicating that the interchain antiferromagnetic interaction is very weak, which is consistent with the maximum χ M ′ at very low temperature in Fig. S4. The magnetic properties of complex 2 are completely different from those of 1. The temperature dependence of magnetic data for complex 2 were collected in the range of 1.8–300K under an applied magnetic field of 2kOe as plotted in Fig. 4 . The χ M T value per Mn6Cr2 for 2 at 300K is 18.49cm3 Kmol−1, which is slightly smaller than the spin-only values (18.74cm3 Kmol−1) calculated from noncoupled six high-spin MnIII (S Mn =2) and two CrI (S Cr =1/2) ions assuming g =2. As temperature is lowed, the χ M T value of complex 2 decreases smoothly and reaches a minimum of 18.03cm3 Kmol−1 at about 90K. Below 90K the χ M T value increases rapidly to a maximum of 137.90cm3 Kmol−1 at about 9K, and then decreases to 35.64cm3 Kmol−1 at 1.8K. The magnetic behavior above is the ferrimagnetic nature with the antiferromagnetic coupling between metal ions, which is similar to the 2D analog [{Mn(saltmen)}4Cr(CN)5(NO)]ClO4·3H2O [7], {K[Mn(3-CH3Osalen)]2[Cr(CN)6]}3·1.5CH3CN·3CH3OH [20] and [{Mn(saltmen)}4{Fe(CN)6}]ClO4·H2O [14d]. The magnetic data of 2 between 90 and 300K obeys the Curie–Weiss law [χ M = C/(T − θ)], affording C =18.73cm3 Kmol−1 and θ =−3.86K, further providing the evidence of antiferromagnetic coupling between MnIII and CrI ions. The field-dependent magnetization measured up to 70kOe at 1.8K is shown in Fig. 5 .The magnetization increases rapidly with the increasing external field showing a plateau of about 7 Nμ B in 1.2-2kOe, and slowly increases until 15.40 Nμ B in 25kOe, and then increases rapidly once again to an unsaturated value of 20.42 Nμ B in 70kOe. All the phenomena indicate the ferrimagnetic nature of complex 2 (the theoretical value is 22 Nμ B calculated from M S = g(6S Mn −2S Cr) with g =2 for six high-spin MnIII (S Mn =2) and two CrI (S Cr =1/2) ions) and the strong magnetic anisotropy [21]. The abrupt increase of magnetization below 1.2kOe and the plateau indicate that there exists an easily magnetized axis and the magnetization along this direction reaches saturation below 2kOe, because the plateau value of 7Nμ B almost equals to the third of the total saturation value of 22Nμ B. The second increasing region of the curve at 2–20kOe corresponds to the magnetization of a second magnetic axis with 14.1Nμ B in 20kOe near two-third of 22Nμ B, which is relatively difficult to be magnetized. The final unsaturated value attained in 70kOe corresponds to the hard magnetic axis [2h]. Note the similar shape of M/H curves can be found in the recently reported work [22]. To confirm the magnetic phase transition, the AC magnetic susceptibility measurement in a 3.0Oe AC field oscillating at 10Hz with a zero DC field was measured for 2 (the inset of Fig. 4). A maximum in real part was observed at about 9K as well as the corresponding signal in the imaginary part. The result confirms the 3D magnetic ordering with the critical temperature (T c) at 9K [7]. Field-cooled (FC) and zero field-cooled (ZFC) magnetic properties were also measured for 2 (the inset of Fig. 5). The irreversibility of the FC and the ZFC magnetization in 9K further attests to the long-range magnetic order in complex 2 [23]. A hysteresis loop with a remnant magnetization of 6.29Nμ B mol−1 and a small coercive field of 0.5kOe was observed at 1.8K, indicating that 2 is a soft ferrimagnet [24]. 4 Conclusions Two cyano-bridged dimetallic complexes derived from MnIII(Schiff-base) and [CrI(CN)5NO]3− have been synthesized and characterized. The synthesis and structure analysis indicate that the substituting group in the salen-type ligands plays a crucial role in tuning the resulting structural styles. Magnetic investigation shows the strong correlation between structure and the magnetic properties. Both the complexes exhibit the ferrimagnetic nature due to the dominant antiferromagnetic coupling between MnIII and CrI ions. However, complex 1 behaves as a simple magnetic chain ascribed to the weak interchain antiferromagnetic interaction, while complex 2 is a ferrimagnet below 9K.
