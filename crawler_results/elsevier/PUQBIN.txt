Two new complexes [Cu(bpydc)(phen)]·3.25H2O (1), [Nd(bpydc)(Ac)(H2O)2]·H2O (2) (bpydc2− =2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylate, phen=1,10-phenantroline, Ac=acetate) have been hydrothermally synthesized and characterized by the elemental analyses, IR spectra, thermal analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The single-crystal X-ray analysis shows that complex 1 exhibits a 1-D chain bridged by bpydc2− ligands and it is further assembled into a supramolecular structure via π–π interactions while complex 2 constructed by Nd(III) ion with bpydc2− and acetate ligands shows a 3-D Nd(III)–organic framework. And the results of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and the thermogravimetric analysis show that the temperature of losing lattice water in the complex 2 is closely related with hydrogen bonds in its molecule. Keywords Hydrothermal synthesis Crystal structure Coordination polymer 2,2′-Bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid 1 Introduction The research on synthesis and applications of coordination polymers have become a popular field since the past 20 years because of the excellent properties, such as molecular recognition, ion exchange, catalysis, microelectronics, non-linear optics, porous materials, etc. [1–7]. Therefore, it is important to get an object with the expected structure and function through a reasonable choice and control of metal ions, organic ligands and other synthesis conditions. Transition metal ions are easy to coordinate with nitrogen and oxygen atoms, and the coordination numbers are mainly focus on 4 or 6, so it is relatively simple for their coordination geometries [8–14]. Compared with transition metal ions, lanthanide ions are prone to coordinate with oxygen atoms, and they have an incline to form higher coordination numbers of 8–12 because of the larger ionic radius, so the coordination geometries for them are more diverse, and it is difficult to predict and control the spatial structures of products, but the study on lanthanide complexes is still important for their characteristically optical and magnetic properties [15]. Nitrogen-containing pyridine carboxylic acids as one type of good bridge ligands can bind transition metal ions and/or lanthanide metal ions and play an important role in building coordination polymers with intriguing architectures and potential applications, so the study about the corresponding complexes becomes necessary and interesting [3,16–21]. 2,2′-Bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylate (bpydc2−) as a flexible ligand can rotate around the C–C bond, so it may offer a variety of coordination geometries. When it reacts with transition metal ions, it can not only provide oxygen atoms to form coordination bond but also offer two nitrogen atoms to chelate with transition metals ions, and the two pyridyl rings are present in a cis conformation along the C–C bond (see Scheme 1 a–f) [22–31]. However, the situation about lanthanide complexes is usually different from the transition metal complexes, because lanthanide ions have an instinctive of high oxophilicity, so the bpydc2− ligand is often in an anti conformation, providing the carboxylate oxygen atoms to coordinate with lanthanide ions (see Scheme 1i–l) [32–35]. Meanwhile, another situation has been reported by C.C. Wang that the bpydc2− ligand can also coordinate with La3+ providing two nitrogen atoms in a cis conformation (see Scheme 1h) [36]. Therefore, a variety of coordination modes can be provided by bpydc2− ligand in the process of constructing new complexes, and which is benefit for the development of new functional materials. In addition, the formation of hydrogen bonds via water molecules and the carboxyl groups, and π–π interactions among pyridyl rings when packed is helpful to the building and stabilizing of high-dimensional network structure. Many transition metal complexes and lanthanide metal complexes with bpydc2− ligand have been reported in recent years [22–36], but the complexes about them are mainly binary, and the solvents as it stands are water, DMF and DMSO. The ternary complexes with bpydc2− are largely unreported. In order to further expand the study about the complexes of bpydc2− ligand, we introduced the second ligand into the system and adopted buffer solution, and two new complexes [Cu(bpydc)(phen)]·3.25H2O (1), [Nd(bpydc)(Ac)(H2O)2]·H2O (2) were obtained, and their structures and thermal stabilities were also characterized and analyzed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods All chemicals employed were commercially available and used as received without further purification. The C, H, N microanalyses were carried out with a Vario EL elemental analyzer. The IR spectra were recorded with a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR spectrometer using the KBr pellet technique. Thermogravimetric analyses were conducted on a ZRY-2P thermal analyzer using a heating rate of 5°C/min from room temperature to 800°C. 2.2 Hydrothermal syntheses 2.2.1 [Cu(bpydc)(phen)]·3.25H2O (1) A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.024g, 0.10mmol), H2bpydc (0.024g, 0.10mmol), phen·H2O (0.030g, 0.15mmol), NaOH (0.32ml, 0.65mol/L), and H2O (12ml) was put into a 25ml stainless steel bomb and heated at 100°C for 4days, then cooled to room temperature slowly.

Semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied using the SADABS program [37]. The structures were solved by direct methods [38] and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F 2 using SHELXS 97 and SHELXL 97 programs, respectively [38,39]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically and hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions. Details of crystallographic data of complexes 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and angles of compounds 1 and 2 are listed in Table 2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural description 3.1.1 [Cu(bpydc)(phen)]·3.25H2O (1) Fig. 1 shows the coordination environment of Cu ion of complex 1, it can be seen that the asymmetric unit contains only one crystallographically independent Cu center, and the copper ion is surrounded by one phen molecule offering two nitrogen atoms, two different bpydc2− ligands providing two nitrogen atoms and two carboxylate oxygen atoms, respectively. Therefore, the Cu ion is six-coordinated, owning a distorted octahedral geometry. And the equatorial plane is located by N1, N2, N4, and O4A atoms, with a very small torsion angle of 0.054Å. Atoms N3 and O3A occupy the axial position, and the bond distance between them and Cu1 is about 2.227 and 2.758Å, respectively, which is much longer than the other coordination bond lengths. All of that may be ascribed to the Jahn–Teller effect. It can be extended from the researches of previous works that the bpydc2− ligand usually adopts a triangular fashion to coordinate with transition metals [22–28], which means that two nitrogen atoms and two carboxylate oxygen atoms of the bpydc2− ligand participate in the coordination with transition metals. And the bonding modes for carboxylate groups are mainly as follows: bis(syn, syn-bridging bidentate), bis(monodentate), or chelating-μ3-bridging bidentate (see Scheme 1a, b, and f). Therefore, both of the two carboxylate groups of the bpydc2− ligand often have a contribution to the construction of metal–organic frameworks. In addition, not all of the carboxylate groups of bpydc2− ligand will participate in the coordination, and which can be seen from Scheme 1c–e [29–31]. However, the coordination mode for bpydc2− ligand in 1 has a difference from the previously reported (see Scheme 1g). One of the two carboxylate groups adopts the mode of chelating bidentate, and another carboxylate group remains free. Meanwhile, the coordinated carboxylate group is nearly coplanar with the corresponding linked pyridyl ring (9.0°), but the angle for uncoordinated carboxylate group with its corresponding linked pyridyl ring is 29.3°. What’s more, the coordinated nitrogen atoms are present in a cis conformation with a dihedral angle of 13.9°. The complex 1 exhibits a 1-D chain due to the coordination mode of bpydc2− ligand and the terminal ligand phen (see Fig. 2 ). But through the π–π interactions it is further assembled into a supramolecular structure as is shown in Fig. 3 . The π–π interactions can be divided into two kinds: (1) the interaction between pyridyl rings of the bpydc2− ligands belonging to adjacent chains (the distance is 3.835Å); (2) the interaction between phen molecules belonging to adjacent chains (the distance is 3.328Å). Meanwhile, it can be seen from Fig. 3 that the two kinds of π–π interactions are arrayed alternately in the structure. Moreover, there is also hydrogen bonding interaction in complex 1. The uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms are involved in the hydrogen bonds with lattice water molecules. 3.1.2 [Nd(bpydc)(Ac)(H2O)2]·H2O (2) A single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 2 has a 3-D MOF, in which the asymmetric unit contains one Nd3+ ion, one bpydc2− anion, one acetate anion, two coordinated water molecules, and one lattice water molecule. As is shown in Fig. 4 , the Nd3+ ion is defined with nine oxygen atoms, and among which O1 O2 O3 O4 come from four different bpydc2− ligands in the mode of Scheme 1i, O5 O6 O6A stem from two acetate with the mode of Scheme 1m, and another two oxygen atoms O7 O8 are provided by two water molecules. The Nd2O18 dimeric building blocks are formed by two NdO9 units from the bpydc2− and acetate anions. The distance between the Nd(III) ions in the dimeric unit is 4.094Å, and a parallelogram (Nd1–O6–Nd1A–O6A) is formed among the two Nd(III) ions and two acetate anions, with 2.605 and 2.429Å are the length and the width of this parallelogram, and its two angles are 71.20° and 108.80°, respectively. What’s more, the dimeric building blocks are further linked by the bridging carboxylate oxygen atoms from two bpydc2− ligands, and the plane located by them is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the above parallelogram, with the dihedral angle 89.1°. Moreover, the Nd2O18 blocks will be further connected by bpydc2− ligands with bis-bridging bidentate mode into a chain (see Fig. 5 ). The bpydc2− ligands use four carboxylate oxygen atoms to coordinate with four Nd(III) ions, and the uncoordinated nitrogen atoms are present in an anti conformation with a dihedral angle of 17.3° between two pyridyl rings, and the two carboxylate groups are not coplanar with the corresponding linked pyridyl rings, with the twist angles 7.7° (O1,O2) and 17.4° (O3,O4), respectively. So the 1-D chain can be further built into a 3-D framework through the tetradentate coordination mode of bpydc2− ligands, and the structure is shown in Fig. 6 , with the coordinated water molecules and lattice water molecule presented in the space filling model, and these water molecules occupy the channel of the 3-D MOF. In addition, the formation of hydrogen bonds among lattice water molecule, coordinated water molecules, coordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms and uncoordinated nitrogen atom is helpful to stabilize the network, and the related hydrogen bonds data are listed in Table 3 . Meanwhile, it can be seen from Fig. 6 that there is a mirror between water molecules arrayed in every vertical line. In order to classify the topology of the network of 2, suitable nodes are defined. We see that there is only one type of Nd(III) ion and one type of bpydc2− ligand and one type of acetate anion in 2, while the coordinated water molecules and lattice water molecule are omitted. The Nd(III) ion is seven-connected with four bpydc2− ligands and two acetate anions with Schäfli symbol of (47,88), and the bpydc2− ligands are four-connected nodes with Schäfli symbol of (42,84), and the three-connected nodes of acetate anions obtain Schäfli symbol of (4). Therefore, the total Schäfli symbol of the topology of complex 2 can be best described as (42,84)(47,88)(4) (see Fig. 7 ), and the topological study for the title complex was done with TOPOS [40,41]. 3.2 Thermal analysis of 1 and 2 To examine the thermal stability of complexes 1 and 2, the thermogravimetric analyses of them were carried out, and the TG curves are shown in Fig. 8 . As was observed from the chart, the thermal decomposition process of 1 can be described in three steps. The first step has a mass loss of 11.10% from 47 to 121°C, which is corresponded to the release of 3.25 lattice water molecules (calcd 10.75%). The second step began at 244°C and ended at 426°C, about 40.66% weight loss was observed, which may correspond to the release of phen molecule and COO− (calcd 41.18%), and similar thermal decomposition process has been confirmed in our previous researches [42]. The last step occurred in the range of 426–627°C with the release of C11N2H7O and the final residual product was to be CuO (15.29%), supported by the theoretical value of 14.61%. For 2, the thermal decomposition process mainly be described in two steps. The first weight loss of 11.49% which occurred between 120 and 264°C, corresponds to the release of one lattice water molecule and two coordinated water molecules (calcd 10.82%). The second weight loss began at 332°C, and then occurred the continuous decomposition of the complex till to 570°C. Nd2O3 was to be the final residual product (33.66% retained, calcd 33.68%). From the above analyses of TG curves for 1 and 2, the different dehydration temperatures for the two complexes can be seen in Fig. 8. For 1, the loss of lattice water molecules began at 47°C and ended at 121°C, but that for 2 started at 120°C. The effect of hydrogen bond on the construction of supramolecular structure for 1 is not investigated due to the disordering of lattice water molecules, but complex 2 can give exact data for hydrogen bonds. In complex 2, the uncoordinated water molecule O9 forms extensive hydrogen bonds, it forms hydrogen bonds not only with coordinated water molecules O7 and O8, but also with the bpydc2− ligand and acetate, shown in Table 3. Thus, it shows higher lost temperature for lattice water in 2, and it keeps a bigger platform from room temperature to 120°C. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have obtained two new ternary complexes about 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid: [Cu(bpydc)(phen)]·3.25H2O and [Nd(bpydc)(Ac)(H2O)2]·H2O, and their structures show 1-D chain and 3-D MOF, respectively. The difference in their structures is mainly contributed to the properties of metal ion and the coordination mode of bpydc2− ligand. In addition, it is easy for bpydc2− ligand to form hydrogen bonds and π–π interactions, which is beneficial to the construction and the stability of high-dimensional structure. Therefore, more new complexes with bpydc2− ligand are expected to obtain and d–f heterometallic complexes of bpydc2− ligand is also a promising topic because of its O- and N-donor. 5 Supplementary data Crystallographic data for the structural analysis have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, CCDC Nos. 748880–748881 for complex 1 and 2, respectively.
