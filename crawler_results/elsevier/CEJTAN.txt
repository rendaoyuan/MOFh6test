The reactions of BaCl2·2H2O with NaHLa and K3Lb (H2La=4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, H3Lb=4-hydroxy-5-nitro-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid) gave two pillared layered coordination polymers: Ba(HLa)(Cl) 1 and KBaLb(H2O)3 2, respectively. The crystal structures were determined by X-ray diffraction method and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods to R=0.0509 and wR=0.1216 using 1455 reflections with I>2σ(I) for 1; and R=0.0288 and wR=0.0727 using 2661 reflections with I>2σ(I) for 2. The interesting feature of compound 1 is the coordination actions of chloride anions, which help to form the polymeric layers by bridging barium cations. In compound 2 the L b 3 − anion acts as an unusual dodecadente ligand to form a coordination polymer with pillared layered structure. Keywords Barium Sulfonate Pillared layered structures Coordination polymer 1 Introduction Inorganic–organic hybrid materials with layered or pillared layered structures have been of intense interest because of their potential applications in chemical separations and catalysis [1,2]. Much of the work in this field has involved organically functionalized metal phosphonates and clays [3,4]. It is well established that metal phosphonate compounds have been extensively studied as functional materials. Analogous to that in the metal phosphonate chemistry, metal sulfonates are a class of novel materials showing interesting functional properties, such as anion exchange, guest sorption [5]. However, in contrast to the phosphonate ligands, sulfonate groups are generally perceived as weaker ligands with respect to their coordinating ability. A considerable body of structural evidence supports this as, with most transition metal ions, sulfonate groups will not displace even solvent from the primary coordination sphere; this is particularly true for harder cations [6]. So suitable metal cations are prerequisite for the design of metal sulfonates. When softer cations, such as alkali or alkaline earth are employed, direct coordination of sulfonate ligands can be enabled [5]. In the guidance of this principle, layered or pillared layered sulfonate compounds with metal cations, such as silver(I) cation, alkali and alkaline earth metal cations as well as lanthanide(III) cations have been reported in recent papers [7]. The possible coordination modes of sulfonate group are outlined in Scheme 1 . Shimizu and Cai have reviewed recent progress in the solid-state coordination and structural chemistry of sulfonate complexes as well as their properties in the gas sorption and amine interaction [6,8]. Thus the studies on metal sulfonate materials attract increasing interests for chemists. Based on above consideration, alkaline earth metal such as barium cation is a coordinatively accessible cation for sulfonate groups. Recently Shimizu et al., reported the functional barium salt of 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate showing interesting gas sorption and versatile coordination chemistry [5]. In order to extend the study on functional barium sulfonate materials, the 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (H2La) and 4-hydroxy-5-nitro-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid (H3Lb) are selected as ligands (Scheme 2 ). H2La and H3Lb have potential coordinating groups –OH, and –SO3H. In this paper, we present two new barium sulfonate coordination polymers with pillared layered structures, namely Ba(HLa)(Cl) 1 and KBaLb(H2O)3 2. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and general methods All the solvents and reagents for synthesis were commercially available and used as received. The elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin–Elmer 240C analyzer. The FT-IR spectrum was recorded from KBr pellets in range 4000–400cm−1 on a Mattson Alpha-Centauri spectrometer. 2.2 Syntheses 2.2.1 Ba(HLa)(Cl) 1 A mixture of NaHLa (0.0784g, 0.4mmol) and BaCl2·2H2O (0.0489g, 0.2mmol) in water (10ml) was stirred at room temperature for 30min. Several days later, colorless crystals grew out of the saturated solution by slow evaporation. Anal. Calcd for Ba(HLa)(Cl): C 20.83, H 1.46. Found: C 20.79, H 1.48%. IR(cm−1): 3432s (–OH), 1034s (ν 3 S–O). 2.2.2 KBaLb(H2O)3 2 A solution of K3Lb (0.0763g, 0.2mmol) in water (5ml) was added into a solution of BaCl2·2H2O (0.0732, 0.3mmol) in water (5ml). After stirring for 20min, the precipitate was collected by filtration and dried in air. Then the product was added into 10ml DMF. After stirring for 30min, the insoluble substance was removed by filtration. Several days later, orange crystals were obtained by the slow diffusion of methanol to the filtrate. Anal. Calcd for KBaLb(H2O)3: C 13.68, H 1.53. Found: C 13.89, H 1.50%. IR(cm−1): 3408s (–OH), 1021s (ν 3 S–O). 2.3 Crystal structure determination and physical measurements Experimental details of the X-ray analyses are provided in Table 1 . Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were recorded on a Siemens P4 diffractometer for 1 and a Bruker-AXS SMART APEX CCD diffractometer for 2 with MoKα radiation (λ=0.71073Å). The structures were solved by Direct Method of SHELXS-97 [9] and refined with full-matrix least-squares techniques using the SHELXL-97 program [10] within WINGX [11]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and the positions of hydrogen atoms on carbon atoms were calculated theoretically. Hydrogen atoms of the water molecules were located from Fourier map. Analytical expression of neutral-atom scattering factors were employed, and anomalous dispersion corrections incorporated [12]. CCDC-241313 (compound 1) and CCDC-271589 (compound 2) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/conts/retrieving.html (or from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, 12, Union Road, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK; fax: +44 1223 336033). 3 Results and discussion Selected bond lengths and angles for compounds 1 and 2 are listed in Table 2 . Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that 1 and 2 are inorganic–organic hybrid materials with pillared layered structures. In 1, –SO3H group are deprotonated, but –OH groups are neutral. Ba(II) cation is nine-coordinated by five sulfonate oxygen atoms from four different HL a − anions (O1, O2, O1A, O2B and O3C), one hydroxyl oxygen atom (O4D) and three chloride anions (Cl1, Cl1A and Cl1B) (Fig. 1 a). The Ba–O (hydroxy) distance is 2.870Å. The Ba–O (sulfonate) distances ranging from 2.788 to 3.112Å are close to those in other barium sulfonates [13], and the Ba–Cl distances range from 3.113 to 3.253Å. The angles of O–Ba–O range from 47.53 to 148.93°, the angles of O–Ba–Cl rang from 59.11 to 149.96°, and the angles of Cl–Ba–Cl rang from 73.70 to 153.42°. The coordination mode of HL a − anion is shown in Fig. 1b. HL a − anion acts as a hexadentate ligand in 1. Two sulfonate oxygen atoms (O1 and O2) coordinate to two barium cations respectively (O1–Ba1, O1–Ba1A, O2–Ba1 and O2–Ba1B), the remaining sulfonate oxygen atom (O3) coordinates to Ba1C only, and the hydroxyl oxygen atom (O4) coordinates to Ba1D. Ba(II) cations are bridged by sulfonate groups and chloride anions to form inorganic polymeric layers (Fig. 1c). The 4-hydroxyphenyl groups are attached to the layers from both sides. Ba(II) cations of one layer are coordinated by the hydroxyl oxygen atoms from the adjacent layers to form an alternating inorganic and organic pillared layered structure (Fig. 1d). The spacing between the linear 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate pillars is too small to include guest molecules. The interesting feature of compound 1 is the coordination actions of chloride anions, which help to form the polymeric layers by bridging barium cations. The presence of chloride anions is unexpected since the reaction was carried out with the molecule ratio of 2:1 (NaHLa:BaCl2). It may result from the poor solubility in water of compound 1. In two related barium sulfonates containing chloride anions [Ba2(L)(H2O)5]Cl 3 (L=trianion of 1,3,5-tris(sulfomethyl)benzene) and Ba2(H2O)4[EuL3(H2O)2](H2O)5.44Cl 4 (L=4,4′-disulfo-2,2′-bipyridine-N,N′-dioxide) chloride anions are not coordinated to metal ions, and reside in the channels of the framework [7g,13b]. For compound 3, an 80% exchange of the chloride anions by fluoride anions is observed. No apparent exchange is found for compound 1 in the same exchange experiment, the coordinating chloride ions in 1 are more difficult for exchange than the uncoordinating chloride ions in 3. In asymmetric unit of the compound 2, there are one Ba(II) cation, one K(I) cation, one L b 3 − anion and three water molecules. As shown in Fig. 2 a, barium cation is nine-coordinated by three sulfonate oxygen atoms from three different L a 3 − anions (O1, O2A and O4B), two hydroxyl oxygen atoms (O7B, O7C), one nitro oxygen atom (O8C), and three water molecules (OW2, OW3 and OW3A). The Ba–O (sulfonate) distances (2.771, 2.801 and 2.832Å) are close to those reported Ba–O (sulfonate) distances [13]. The Ba–O (hydroxyl) distances of 2.702 and 2.904Å are near to those of related barium sulfonate compounds [13]. The Ba–O (water) distances range from 2.821 to 2.908Å, and the angles of O–Ba–O rang from 57.31 to 165.86°. The distance of Ba–O (nitro) is 2.842Å. The K(I) cation is eight-coordinated by four sulfonate oxygen atoms from three different L b 3 − anions (O1A, O4B, O5C and O6C), two oxygen atoms from one nitro group (O8 and O9), and two water molecules (OW1 and OW2A) (Fig. 2b). The distances of K–O (sulfonate) ranging from 2.749 to 2.960Å are close to the reported values [14]. The distances of K–O (nitro) are 2.734 and 3.326Å, and the distances of K–O (water) are 2.876 and 3.137Å, respectively. The angles of O–K–O rang from 40.01 to 148.92°. It is noteworthy that the oxygen atoms of the nitro group are generally perceived as weaker ligands with respect to their coordinating ability, while they coordinate to Ba(II) and K(I) cations in compound 2. As shown in Fig. 2c, each L b 3 − anion coordinates to four Ba(II) cations and four K(I) cations acting as a highly unusual dodecadentate ligand. For 1-sulfonate group, O1 bridges one Ba(II) cation and one K(I) cation, O2 coordinates to one Ba(II) cation only, and O3 is free. For 2-sulfonate group, two oxygen atoms (O5 and O6) chelate one K(I) cation, the remaining oxygen atom bridges one Ba(II) cation and one K(I) cation. Two nitro oxygen atoms (O8, O9) chelate one K(I) cation, at the same time O8 also coordinates to one Ba(II) cation. Hydroxyl oxygen atom bridges two Ba(II) cations. Ba(II) and K(I) cations are bridged by the sulfonate groups, nitro groups and the hydoxyl oxygen atoms of the L b 3 − anions to form inorganic polymeric layers (Fig. 3 a). L b 3 − anion plays a role of organic pillar, with 1-sulfonate group coordinating to metal cations of one inorganic polymeric layer and other groups (2-sulfonate group, nitro group and hydroxyl oxygen atom) coordinating to the metal cations of adjacent layer. Thus the framework of compound 2 can be described as pillared layered structures with inorganic layer and organic pillar along the b axis, (Fig. 3b, Scheme 3 ). Shimizu et al. suggested that a bent pillar would not pack efficiently in the interlayer and generate porosity, and have synthesized the first functional pillared metal sulfonate network [BaL(H2O)].H2O 5 (H2L=4,5-dihydroxybenzene- 1,3-disulfonic acid) [7f]. Based on the structural feature of L b 3 − anion, L b 3 − also can serve as a bent pillar to construct porous network. Like compound 5, in compound 2 the bent structure of L b 3 − opens up void in the interlayer between the pillars. There exist channels along the a-axis (Fig. 3b), and these channels are filled with water molecules which are weakly bonded to K(I) cations with K–O distances of 3.137(7) Å. Although both compounds 2 and 5 show pillared layered structures, the polymeric layer of 2 contains two kinds of metal cations (Ba(II) and K(I)) while that of 5 contains only Ba(II) cations. In 2, the hydroxyl group coordinates in deprotonted form, and in 5 two hydroxyl groups of the ligand coordinate to Ba(II) cations as neutral groups. Since the –NO2 group is bulkier than –OH group, the d spacing (9.79Å) of 2 is slightly longer than that (9.24Å) of 5. In summary, two new barium sulfonate coordination polymers with pillared layered structures were synthesized. In compound 1 Ba(II) cations of one layer are coordinated by the hydroxyl oxygen atoms from the adjacent layers to form an alternating inorganic and organic pillared layered structure. Compound 2 also shows a pillared layered structure, with organic pillar L b 3 − acting as an unusual dodecadentate ligand.
