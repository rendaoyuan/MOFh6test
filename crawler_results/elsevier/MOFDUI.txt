Graphical abstract Seven new lanthanide coordination polymers with 1,3-phenylenebis(oxy)diacetic acid, formic acid or 1,10-phenanthroline, of which five complexes own single- and quadruple-stranded helical chains, have been synthesized and characterized. The single crystal X-ray diffraction results demonstrate that PODA2− ligand, with two carboxylate groups at a suitable angle, is apt to construct helical structures with lanthanide ions, and formic acid, with multi-dentate bridging coordination modes, as a co-ligand helps to construct multi-stranded helical and higher-dimensional structures. Seven Ln(III) coordination polymers, namely [Ln(PODA)(FA)(H2O)] n [Ln=La(1), Ce(2), Pr(3), Nd(4), Eu(5)] and [Ln(PODA)1.5(phen)] n [Ln=La(6), Pr(7)] (H2PODA=1,3-phenylenebis(oxy)diacetic acid, HFA=formic acid, phen=1,10-phenanthroline) have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions and characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single crystal X-ray crystallography, UV–Vis spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD). Structural analysis reveals that 1–5 are isostructural and exhibit 3-D frameworks with a (32.42.52)2(38.420.524.614) topology, which comprise single- and quadruple-strand helical chains; while 6 and 7 show similar layer structures with a (44.62) topology, however, they only consist of one kind of single-strand helical chain. In addition, the thermal stabilities of complexes 3 and 7 and the luminescent properties of complex 5 have been briefly investigated. Keywords Lanthanide coordination polymers 1,3-Phenylenebis(oxy)diacetic acid Co-ligand Crystal structure Helix chain 1 Introduction The construction of novel coordination polymers is the current interest in the field of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering stems from their potential applications as functional materials as well as their intriguing variety of architectures and molecular topologies [1–10]. Among them, the construction of helical coordination polymers has aroused a great deal of attention owing to the wide appearance of helical structures in, for example, proteins, collagens, quartz, single-walled carbon nanotubes and many more natural or artificial fiber-type derivatives [11–13]. Until now, many single-, double-, triple- and higher-order stranded helical complexes have been generated by a self-assembly process [14–18]. Previously, our group synthesized a series of pyrazole acid compounds as ligands to coordinate with transition metal ions, and obtained a lot of complexes with various fascinating helical structures [19–22]. The crucial step for the design of helical coordination polymers is the reasonable choice of ligands. The ligands should be capable of bridging metal atoms in multi-directions with appropriate angles and contain steric information that can be interpreted by the arrangement of the bound metal centers, which help to result in the formation of helical structures. With this understanding, H2PODA (H2PODA=1,3-phenylenebis(oxy)diacetic acid) was applied as a ligand in this work because it contains two carboxylic groups with an angle of 60° that can provide versatile coordination modes and substituted carboxyl groups may act as both hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, which can lead to remarkable classes of complexes bearing helical architectures and potential functions. Besides the natural flexibility of the original ligands, other subtle factors, such as coordination geometries of the metal ions, reaction conditions and ancillary ligands, are also important for the construction of helical coordination polymers [23–27]. Lanthanide ions have a larger radii and higher coordination numbers than transition metals, and they have unique luminescent properties and specific magnetic properties, which have aroused more and more scientists’ interest [28–31]. In addition, considering the high coordination number of lanthanide ions, ancillary ligands can be employed to occupy some coordination sites and prevent the interpenetration of frameworks. HFA (HFA=formic acid) has a strong coordination ability and can adopt various bridging modes to link metal ions and/or construct stable metal-carboxylate secondary building units [32–34], which can contribute to form helical and high-dimensional structures; phen (phen=1,10-phenanthroline) has a rigid planar structure and its two nitrogen atoms are apt to coordinate to metal ions in chelating mode, it is also a good π electron acceptor and helps to construct stable supramolecular structures via C–H⋯O (N) and C–H⋯π hydrogen bonds and π–π stacks. A series of copper(II), zinc(II) and cadmium(II) complexes based on H2PODA form low-dimensional structures, such as chain structures [35–37]. However, there are few reports about lanthanide coordination polymers based on H2PODA. Herein, we report the syntheses and structures of seven lanthanide coordination polymers with H2PODA and HFA or phen: [Ln(PODA)(FA)(H2O)] n [Ln=La (1), Ce (2), Pr (3), Nd (4), Eu (5)] and [Ln(PODA)1.5(phen)] n [Ln=La (6), Pr (7)]. In addition, the photoluminescence properties of complex 5 in the solid state have also been investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and physical measurements All the materials and reagents were obtained commercially and used without further purification. The elemental analysis of C, H and N were carried out with a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer.

UV–Vis spectra were recorded on a Hitachi Model U-3900 H spectrophotometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54056Å), in which the X-ray tube was operated at 40kV and 40mA. Thermogravimetric curves were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Diamond TG/DTA Thermal Analyzer.

Semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied to the title complexes using the sadabs program [38]. The structures were solved by direct methods [39] and refined by full-matrix least squares on F 2 using shelxl-97 [40]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The water H atoms were located from difference Fourier maps, the other hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions. Experimental details for the X-ray data collection of 1–7 are presented in Table 1 and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table S1. Hydrogen bonding lengths and angles are listed in Table S2. In complexes 6 and 7, C24 and O9 are disordered. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Description of the structures The single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that complexes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and 6 and 7 are isostructural, respectively. So only the structures of complexes 3 and 7 will be discussed in detail. 3.1.1 Crystal structure of [Pr(PODA)(FA)(H2O)] n (3) The single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that complex 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic system with the space group P21/c, exhibiting a three-dimensional framework. Each asymmetric unit of 3 contains one Pr(III) ion, one fully deprotonated PODA2− ligand, one formate ion and one coordinated water molecule. As shown in Fig. 1 , the metal center Pr(III) is coordinated by nine oxygen atoms: five oxygen atoms from four PODA2− ligands, three oxygen atoms from three formate ions and one oxygen atom from one water molecule, displaying a tricapped trigonal-prismatic geometry. In complex 3, the formate ions adopt a kind of tridentate coordination mode (see Scheme 1 a), and each formate ligand joins three Pr(III) ions; the H2PODA ligands show one kind of coordination mode, one carboxylate group acts in a bidentate bridging fashion and the other one functions in a chelating bridging fashion (see Scheme 1b), and every PODA2− ligand links four Pr(III) ions. Every Pr(III) ion is bridged to eight adjacent Pr(III) ions by four PODA2− ligands, which results in a 2-D infinite network with left- and right-handed helical chains (Fig. 2 a), the pitch of the helix running along the b axis is the same as its length (7.80Å), and formic molecules further link these layers into a 3-D metal–organic framework (Fig. 2b), in which it is noteworthy that four kinds of helical chains can be observed. These four helices are formed by metal ions and carboxyl groups of PODA2− ligands [I: (–Pr1–O2–C8–O3–Pr1–O2A–C8A–O3A–) n , II: (–Pr1–O5B–C10B–O6B–Pr1–O5C–C10C–O6C–) n ], metal ions and carboxyl oxygen atoms of PODA2− ligands [III: (–Pr1–O5B–Pr1–O5C–) n ] and metal ions and carboxyl oxygen atoms of formate ligands [IV: (–Pr1–O9D–Pr1–O9E–) n ], and they intertwined with each other to generate a unique four-stranded helix which is united at the Pr(III) ions (Fig. 2c). The helices I and II are made up of metal ions and carboxyl groups, while III and IV are made up of metal ions and oxygen atoms, which are different from the quadruple-strand helical chains reported by us previously [20,22]. In the quadruple-strand helical chains, I and IV both are right-handed, while II and III both are left-handed, and the whole crystal is racemic and does not exhibit chirality. The pitches of the four helical chains are the same, all being the length of the b axis (7.80Å). Better insight into this complicated 3-D architecture can be achieved by topology analysis. In this framework, two Pr(III) ions are associated by two formate ions to form a tetramer [Pr2FA2], and from a topological point of view, the [Pr2FA2] unit and the PODA ligand can be considered as 12-connected (Fig. 3 rose color) and 4-connected (Fig. 3 blue color) nodes respectively. The overall structure can be simplified as having an sqc376 {32.42.52}2{38.420.524.614} topology, as shown in Fig. 3. It is exciting to find that such a topological structure has not been reported previously. To date, frameworks with a connection of over eight are rarely observed [41,42]. Employing polynuclear metal clusters as nodes is an effective route to generate higher connected topology nets. 3.1.2 The crystal structure of [Pr(PODA)1.5(phen)] n (7) Crystallographic analysis revealed that complex 7 belongs to the triclinic system with the space group P 1 ¯ . Each asymmetric unit of complex 7 contains one unique Pr(III) ion, one and half PODA2− ligands, and one phen molecule. Pr(III) is nine coordinated by seven oxygen atoms (O1, O7, O8, O2A, O4B, O5B, O4C) from five PODA2− ligands and two nitrogen atoms (N1, N2) from one phen molecule, displaying a distorted tricapped trigonal prismatic structure (Fig. 4 ). In complex 7, the H2PODA ligands are all completely deprotonated and exhibit two kinds of coordination modes: one is the same as that in complex 3 and the other is a bis-chelating coordination mode (see Scheme 1b and c), and each PODA2− ligand links four or two Pr(III) ions, forming a layer structure, in which left- and right-handed helix chains can be observed (Fig. 5 ). The pitch of the helix running along the a axis is the same as its length (9.19Å). To best understand the structure of complex 7, a topology analysis is employed to describe the architecture. It is interesting that two adjacent Pr(III) atoms are linked by two carboxylate oxygen atoms to generate a dimeric SBU with a Pr⋯Pr distance of 4.06Å. Each dimeric SBU is surrounded by four dimeric SBUs through H2PODA ligands. In accordance with the simplification principle, the dinuclear SBUs can be considered as four-connected nodes, and the architecture of 7 can be described as a 2-D uninodal 4-connected network with (44.62) topology (Fig. 6 ). The layer structure of complex 7 is further linked into a 3-D supramolecular structure through C–H⋯O hydrogen bonds between the C–H groups of phen molecules and carboxylate oxygen atoms (as shown in Table S2). 3.2 Comparison of the structures The PODA2− ligands in the titled seven complexes exhibit two kinds of coordination modes, presenting only one μ4–η1:η1:η1:η2 coordination mode in complexes 1–5, as shown in Scheme 1b, while displaying μ4–η1:η1:η1:η2 and μ2–η1:η1:η1:η1 coordination modes in complexes 6 and 7 (see Scheme 1b and c), which are different from that reported by Shan Gao et al. [43–48]. Complexes 1–5 feature 2-D wave-like layer structures, with every PODA2− ligand joining four metal ions, whilst complexes 6 and 7 display different 2-D rectangle-like structures with the PODA2− ligands joining four or two metal ions, showing that the flexible carboxylate groups of the PODA2− ligands can display different types of bridging conformations resulting in the different structures of complexes 1–5 and 6–7. Compared with the structures of transition metal complexes reported previously, Mg(II) and Co(II) polymers display 0-D structures with the PODA2− ligand [43,49], Cu(II) and Zn(II) polymers exhibit 1-D chain structures based on the PODA2− ligand [36,37], while the Ln(III) coordination polymers display layer structures based on the PODA2− ligand, showing the larger radii, coordination number and higher valance of the lanthanide ions need more PODA2− ligands, which lead to the high-dimensional structures of the lanthanide coordination polymers. The crystal structures of complexes 3 and 7 are different even though the PODA2− ligands link the same Pr(III) ion to generate layer structures. In complex 3, formic acid acts as a bridging ligand and in complex 7 phen acts as a chelating terminal ligand, which result in complex 3 exhibiting a 3-D metal–organic framework, while complex 7 displays a layer structure. The results reveal that the auxiliary ligands play an important role in determining the structural diversity in the coordination polymers, and selecting an appropriate co-ligand helps to construct high-dimensional structures. In addition, complex 3 not only owns one kind of single-strand helical chain with the participation of PODA2− ligands, but also has one kind of quadruple-strand helical chain together with the help of the formate ion and the PODA2− ligand, and complex 7 only displays one kind of single-strand helical chain without the association of phen. This shows that formic acid, with a multi-dentate bridging coordination mode, helps to form multi-stranded helical structures. The average Ln–O bond lengths (2.583Å for 1, 2.558Å for 2, 2.542Å for 3, 2.524Å for 4, 2.522Å for 5, 2.544Å for 6 and 2.510Å for 7) and Ln–N bond lengths (2.719Å for 6 and 2.677Å for 7) decrease with the increase of the lanthanide atomic number, which can be ascribed to the lanthanide contraction effect. 3.3 UV–vis absorption spectra The solid-state UV–Vis spectra of H2PODA and complexes 1–7 were recorded at room temperature in the region 250–700nm. As shown in Fig. 7 , complexes 1–7 all exhibit a large broad band in the range 250–300nm for the absorption of the PODA2− ligand and the bands in the region 300–700nm originate from the characteristic 4f–4f transitions from the ground state to the excited ones of the Ln(III) ions (3, 4, 5 and 7). Bands at 276nm for 1, 275nm for 2, 277nm for 3, 273nm for 4, 274nm for 5, 273nm for 6 and 270nm for 7 belong to the π–π∗ transition of the ligand, and the bands are slightly blue-shifted compared with that of H2PODA (278nm), indicating that the coordination with the Ln(III) ions enlarges the energy gaps in the conjugated systems of PODA2−. As the f–f transitions are inner shell transitions, the effect of the ligands will be negligible and the electronic spectra of the lanthanide complexes resemble those of the free ions. The hypersensitive transition bands of complex 3 at ca. 444, 471, 486 and 591nm originate from the 3H4 ground state of the Pr(III) ion to various excited states: 3P2, 3P1, 3P0 and 1D2. The absorption spectrum of complex 4, with bands at ca. 427, 464, 482 and 580nm, is consistent with the absorption bands 2P1/2, 4G11/2, 4G9/2 and 4G5/2 of thte Nd(III) ion. Complex 5 revealed several absorption peaks around 352, 406 and 464nm, which correspond to the f–f electronic transitions from the 7F0 ground state of Eu(III) to the higher excited states: 5D4, 5D3 and 5D2. The absorption spectrum of complex 7 displays several bands, at 443, 469, 482 and 590nm, assigned to the corresponding electronic transitions of Pr(III) from the ground state 3H4 to the excited states: 3P2, 3P1, 3P0 and 1D2. However, the absorption spectra of complexes 1, 2 and 6 do not show bands from the f–f transitions of the Ln(III) ion in the visible region, and only one band from the ligand is observed in the range 250–300nm. 3.4 Powder X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis Complexes 3 and 7 were selected as representatives to check the phase purity of these complexes and the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded at room temperature, as show in Fig. S1 (Supporting information). The bulk samples of 3 and 7 corroborate well with those simulated from the single crystal data respectively. Complexes 3 and 7 were also chosen as examples to characterize the thermal stability of the complexes and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed under an N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10°C/min from room temperature to 800°C, as shown in Fig. S2 (see Supporting information). For 3, the first step, in the range 185–274°C, can be ascribed to the loss of the coordinated water molecule (obsd 4.42%, calcd 4.20%). For 7, the first weight loss of 26.46% between 236 and 285°C corresponds to the loss of phen, which is consistent with the calculated value of 27.42%. Upon increasing the temperature, the frameworks of 3 and 7 commence to collapse and the final residuals were not characterized. 3.5 Luminescent properties Considering the excellent luminescent property of Eu(III) ions, the solid-state photoluminescent spectra of complex 5 and the H2PODA ligand were measured at room temperature. The solid H2PODA ligand shows an emission band at 415nm upon excitation at 342nm, which may be assigned to the π∗ →n electron transition. As shown in Fig. 8 , the emission spectrum of 5 upon excitation at 396nm displays intense red luminescence and exhibits the characteristic transitions of 5D0 → 7F n (n =0–4) of Eu(III) ions at 580, 591, 619, 644 and 683nm, respectively. It is worth noting that these characteristic emission bands indicate that the ligand to metal energy transfer is moderately efficient under the experimental conditions used. Moreover, the intensity of the hypersensitive transition 5D0 → 7F2 is larger than that of the 5D0 → 7F1 transition, indicating a highly polarizable chemical environment around the Eu(III) ion. The intensity ratio of the 5D0 → 7F2 transition (electric dipole transition) to the 5D0 → 7F1 transition (magnetic dipole transition) of 5 is ca. 5.41, which indicates that the Eu(III) ion in 5 is not located at a center of inversion and the symmetry of the Eu(III) ion site is low. 4 Conclusions In summary, seven new lanthanide supramolecular complexes with diverse helical characters have been obtained under hydrothermal conditions. Complexes 1–5 exhibit 3-D metal–organic frameworks containing single- and quadruple-stranded helical chains with the help of formate and PODA2− ligands, while complexes 6 and 7 display layer networks containing only single-stranded helical chains. The results demonstrate that the PODA2− ligand, with two flexible carboxylate groups at a suitable angle, is apt to construct helical structures with lanthanide ions, and formic acid, with multi-dentate bridging coordination modes, as a co-ligand helps to construct multi-stranded helical and high-dimensional structures. The results of photoluminescent measurements indicate that complex 5 may be a potential fluorescent material.
