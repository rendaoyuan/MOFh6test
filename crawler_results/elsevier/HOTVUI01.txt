Graphical abstract Two complexes, [Co(μ-succinato)(H2O)2(pyridine)2] n 1 and {[Co2(μ-H2O)(μ-glutarato)2(pyridine)2]·pyridine} n 2, have been synthesized by the same chemical method, except using a different dicarboxylic acid. The crystal structure of 1 is a one-dimensional polymeric chain whereas that of 2 is a polymeric chain of dinuclear Co(II) moieties. Two novel cobalt(II) complexes, [Co(μ-succinato)(H2O)2(pyridine)2] n 1 and {[Co2(μ-H2O)(μ-glutarato)2(pyridine)2]·pyridine} n 2 have been synthesized by a wet chemistry method. In complex 1, the Co(II) ions are linked through succinate ligands to created one-dimensional polymeric chain along the b-axis. Complex 2 consists of a polymeric chain of dinuclear Co(II) moieties in which two cobalt(II) ions are linked through a bridging water and two bridging carboxylate groups from two glutarate ligands. The glutarate ligands in complex 2 display two coordination modes, interbinuclear bridging and intrabinuclear bridging. All the bond angles of the alkyl chain in complex 2 are between 115.7° and 118.5°, supporting the gauche conformation. Free pyridine molecules were found in the cavities between the chains. Two strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds are observed between the coordinated water and the uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atom in both complexes. Complex 2 is further stabilized by π–π stacking of pyridine molecules. Complex 1 is a paramagnet (C =3.50(1)cm3 Kmol and θ =−5.0(5)K) and complex 2 exhibits a broad maximum at 4K due to weak coupling within the dimeric unit. Keywords 1-D polymeric chain 1-D dinuclear polymeric chain π–π Stacking Metal organic framework Co(II) complexes Magnetic properties 1 Introduction There has been considerable interest in metal organic frameworks whose crystal structures present various types of metal–ligand coordination and their dimensionality. The studies on metal organic frameworks are focused on materials science as well as structural chemistry for potential applications such as catalysis [1–3], gas adsorption [4–6], chemical adsorption [7] or magnetism [8–10]. The general strategy for designing such extended system relies on the use of multidentate ligands which have the potential capacity to bridge between metal centers to form polymeric structures. Dicarboxylic acids with terminal carboxylic groups allow a variety of one and higher dimensional complexes [11–15]. The terminal dicarboxylate ions usually link between two adjacent metal centers. In some complexes the non-covalent interactions, which are weak intermolecular forces i.e. hydrogen bonding, π–π interaction and van der Waals forces, exist causing multidimensional structures. In some cases, the complexes are found to have cavities and channels with incorporated solvents. The wide range of stable complexes are due to (i) the various coordination modes for the carboxylate ion, of the monodentate, bidentate of syn–syn, syn–anti and anti–anti types (ii) the stable coordination geometries, such as tetrahedral, pyramidal and octahedral, of Co(II) and (iii) the presence of a number of coordinated water or hydroxide ligands [16]. The cobalt(II) ion in the carboxylate complexes containing only carboxylate or dicarboxylate ligands has a tetrahedral geometry [11], but when N-donor ligands are added, the coordination geometry of cobalt(II) becomes octahedral [12–15]. The interest in the study of metal carboxylate complexes has focused on both their structures and magnetism because the carboxylate bridge creates diverse magnetic interactions between the metal centers. In this paper, we report the syntheses, crystal structures, thermal stability and magnetic properties of two novel complexes containing the dicarboxylates succinate and glutarate, and also pyridine. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and measurement All reagents were purchased from commercial sources and were used as received. The elemental analyses (C, H and N) were performed at the Microanalysis Service Center of Bristol University. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Model Equinox 55 spectrophotometer, in the region 400–4000cm−1, equipped with a horizontal attenuated total reflectance accessory. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were studied by a Perkin–Elmer TGA7 in a N2 atmosphere (heating rate=10°Cmin−1) using a platinum pan. The magnetic susceptibility measurements (1.7–293K) were carried out using a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID magnetometer (measurements carried out at 10000 Oersted). 2.2 Synthesis of [Co(μ-succinato)(H2O)2(pyridine)2] n (1) To 10cm3 of pyridine solution containing 0.059g (0.5mmol) succinic acid was added 10cm3 of a dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate, 0.124g (0.5mmol). The mixture was stirred and then allowed to stand for several days at room temperature, after which pink crystals were obtained (yield: 81.7%). Anal.

The mixture was allowed to stand for several days at room temperature, after which pink crystals were obtained (yield: 78.7%). Anal. Calc. for C35H39Co2N5O9 (%): C, 53.06; H, 4.92; N, 8.84.

The data were collected at 273K. Both structures were solved by direct methods using the shelxtl program system [17] and were refined by full-matrix least-squares, first with isotropic and then with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. All hydrogen atoms of complex 1 were located from a difference Fourier map and refined. For complex 2, some hydrogen atoms were introduced at ideal positions with fixed isotropic parameters. All hydrogen atoms are included in the final refinement. Crystal data and refinement results of both complexes are listed in Table 1 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structure of [Co(μ-succinato)(H2O)2(pyridine)2] n 1 and {[Co2(μ-OH2)(μ-glutarato)2(pyridine)4]·pyridine} n 2 Complex 1 and [Zn(μ-suc)(py)2(H2O)2] n [18] are isomorphous. Co(II) ions are linked through succinate ligands to create a one-dimensional polymeric chain along the b-axis (Fig. 1 ). The distance between each pair of Co(II) ions within the polymeric chains is 8.911Å. Each cobalt atom is coordinated octahedrally to two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two succinate ligands, two oxygen atoms from two coordinated water molecules and two nitrogen atoms from two pyridine molecules. All similar ligands are in trans positions, resulting in a center of symmetry at the cobalt atom. The coordination mode for each bridging succinate is bis-monodentate bridging. The aliphatic CH2 chains of the succinate ligands are in fully extended conformations with torsion angles C6–C7–C7′–C6′ of 180°. Consequently, the aliphatic carbon backbone in each succinate ligand exists in an anti-conformation. Succinate ligands in some complexes demonstrate a syn-conformation [19]. Most cobalt–succinate complexes found in the literature exhibit only the bis-monodentate bridging coordination mode [19–22]. The average Co–O (carboxylate) bond distance (2.063(2)Å) is similar to those in other octahedral carboxylate bridged cobalt(II) complexes [12–15], but it is larger than that found in the tetrahedral complex [Co(O2C(CH2)3CO2)4] (average 1.980(3)Å) [12]. The bond length between the cobalt and aqua oxygen atoms (2.103(2)Å) (Table 2 ) is a little shorter than those observed in complexes with a bridged dicarboxylate (2.133(2)Å) [13–14]. The Co–O (aqua) bonds are longer than the Co–O (carboxylate) bonds. All bond lengths and bond angles are in the usual ranges. The packing of this complex along a-, b- and c-axes are shown in Fig. 2 . The coordinated water forms intrachain hydrogen bonds with the uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atom within the 1-D chain. This coordinated water also forms interchain hydrogen bonds with the uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms in the adjacent chain, resulting in an extended two-dimensional structure (Table 3 ). The pyridine planes along the 1-D chain form partial edge-to-face π–π interactions with the pyridine plane in the adjacent chains, with approximately parallel pyridine planes separated by interplanar distances of about 3.806Å (Fig. 3 ). The crystal structure of complex 2 consists of a polymeric chain of dinuclear cobalt(II) moieties (Fig. 5 ). In the dinuclear moiety, two cobalt(II) ions are linked through a bridging water ligand and two carboxylate groups from two different glutarate ligands. The dinuclear moieties form a polymeric chain through the bridging of the glutarate ligand along the c-axis. The octahedron around each cobalt is completed by one oxygen atom from the bridging aqua ligand, two nitrogen atoms from two pyridine ligands in a cis position, two oxygen atoms from the bidentate carboxylate group of two glutarate ligands and one oxygen from a monodentate carboxylate group from another glutarate ligand (Fig. 4). In this study it was found that for every glutarate ligand, the carboxylate group at one end displays a monodentate coordination mode while the other end displays a bidentate mode. The former bridges between Co(II) ions from two adjacent dinuclear moieties, forming a sixteen-membered ring. The latter bridges between Co(II) ions within a dinuclear moiety, forming an eight-membered ring. This type of coordination mode is called monodentate–bidentate bridging. The coordination modes of glutarate ligands are found to be of many types [23–27], such as bis-bidentate bridging, bidentate-chelate bridging, monodentate, bis-monodentate bridging and monodentate-chelate bridging, as shown in Scheme 1 . The distance between two Co(II) ions in a dinuclear moiety is 3.591Å and that between Co(II) ions in two adjacent dinuclear moieties is 8.064Å. The average dihedral angles of alkyl chains of glutarate ligands in this complex are observed to be 64.8° indicating the gauche–gauche conformation [12,28]. All bond angles of alkyl chains in this complex are between 115.7° and 118.5°, supporting the gauche–gauche conformation. Some glutarate complexes demonstrate an anti-gauche conformation, such as [Cu2(glutarate)2(4,4′-bipy)] [23]. This complex is found to have cavities with incorporated pyridine molecules lying between the chains. The incorporated pyridine molecules are distorted as can be recognized from the large values of the temperature factors. Two strong intrachain hydrogen bonds with O–O distances of 2.559 and 2.570Å are observed between the coordinated water and the uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms (Table 3). The crystal structure is further stabilized by partial face-to-face π–π stacking of pyridine ligands which can be seen in the packing of the crystal structure with approximate interplane distances between parallel pyridine plane of 3.488–3.598Å (Fig. 6 ). The incorporated pyridine molecules also form weak edge-to-face π–π interactions with nearby pyridine ligands with an interplanar distance of 3.395Å. 3.2 Thermogravimetric analyses The thermogram of complex 1 shows two steps of weight losses. The first weight loss corresponds to the release of two aqua ligands and two pyridine molecules, occurring in the temperature range 80–200°C. The observed weight loss of 50.0% is close to the calculated one (52.54%). The second weight loss corresponds to the decomposition of the succinate ligand, which is complete at 400°C. The weight loss of 30.0% is in agreement with the calculated one (31.42%). For complex 2, the loss of the uncoordinated pyridine, aqua ligand and four pyridine ligands occurs first in the temperature range 70–300°C, with a weight loss of 51.0% (calc. 52.17%). The elimination of the glutarate ligands takes place at 350–530°C accompanied by a weight loss of 33.0% (calc. 32.85%). 3.3 Magnetic properties 3.3.1 Complex 1 The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for complex [Co(μ-suc)(py)2(H2O)2] n 1 in the temperature range 1.7–293K is shown in Fig. 7 . A Curie–Weiss fit of the data in the range 100–300K gives a Curie constant of 3.50(4)cm3 Kmol−1 and a Weiss temperature of −5.0(5)K (Fig. 8 ). The Curie constant is larger than the spin-only value of 1.87cm3 Kmol−1 due to the presence of an orbital contribution and falls in the limits of the experimentally observed values for octahedral cobalt(II). The value of the Weiss temperature is slightly higher than the value of −20K expected for a regular octahedral geometry, where the negative value is due to the effect of spin–orbit coupling [29]. 3.3.2 Complex 2 The magnetic susceptibility was measured in the temperature range 1.7–293K (Fig. 7). The Curie–Weiss fit of the data in the range 100–300K gives a Curie constant of 6.47(4)cm3 Kmol−1, that is 3.24cm3 Kmol−1 for cobalt, and a Weiss temperature of −49(2)K (Fig. 8). The Curie constant is within the range expected, but the Weiss constant in this case is significantly antiferromagnetic. It is to be noted that a broad maximum is observed at 4K and this is associated with an antiferromagnetic interaction between the cobalt ions within the dimer. The data is too limited to estimate the exchange energy. 4 Conclusions Two cobalt(II) complexes, [Co(μ-succinato)(H2O)2(pyridine)2] n 1 and {[Co2(μ-H2O)(μ-glutarato)2(pyridine)2]·pyridine} n 2, have been synthesized by a wet chemistry method. Complex 1 exhibits a one-dimensional polymeric chain with a bridging succinate ligand while complex 2 exhibits a polymeric chain of the dinuclear cobalt(II) complex with a bridging glutarate ligand which is in the gauche conformation. In complex 2 the free pyridine molecules are trapped into cavities in the crystal structure. Both structures are stabilized by strong hydrogen bonds formed by aqua ligands and uncoordinated oxygen atoms of the dicarboxylic acids. Complex 2 is further stabilized by π–π stacking of pyridine ligands. While 1 is a paramagnet, 2 exhibits a weak intradimer antiferromagnetic interaction.
