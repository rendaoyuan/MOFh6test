A new silver organodiphosphonate, [Ag4(O3PCH2CH2PO3)] (1), has been synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction, IR, TGA-DSC, electricity measurement and element analysis. 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/n (a=6.0115(16)Å, b=8.630(2)Å, c=8.462(2)Å, β=97.693(4)°, Z=2, R 1=0.0604, wR 2=0.1450). 1 contains one-dimensional channels and a three-dimensional Ag⋯Ag interacted substructural net. TGA and XRD indicate little weight loss up to 300°C and little structure change after heated at 170°C for 2h, respectively. The grain interior conductivity of 1 increases continuously from 50 to 170°C. Results of EHT calculations show that under thermal or optical excitation the conductivity of 1 is mainly due to transfer of π antibonding electrons of –PO3 group through O atom to Ag 5s orbital, which also leads to enhancement of Ag⋯Ag interactions and promotes formation of Ag⋯Ag substructural net. Graphical abstract A new silver organodiphosphonate [Ag4(O3PCH2CH2PO3)] with zeolite-like framework contains one-dimensional channels occupied by ethylene groups and a three-dimensional Ag⋯Ag interacted substructural net. Keywords Hydrothermal syntheses Silver Diphosphonate Zeolite-like Single crystal 1 Introduction Metal organodiphosphonates as new hybrid inorganic–organic materials have attracted a great deal of research interest in the past 10 years, due to many applications as small molecular sensors [1,2], adsorption [3] and catalyst [4]. Particularly, metal organodiphosphonates are very important in preparing meso/micro-porous materials [5–9] because the open frameworks can be adjusted through modifying lengths and shapes of the organic units. Generally, metal organodiphosphonates are pillar-like structures, such as Cr2+ [10], Co2+ [11,12], Cu2+ [11–14], Zn2+ [11,15–17], Al3+ [18], Ga3+ [19], Ln3+ [20], Ti4+ [21,22], Zr4+ [23–27] and Th4+ [28]. However, as far as we know, there are few metal organodiphosphonates with zeolite-like structures in previous work. And only two silver organophosphonates [29,30] and few silver organodiphosphonates have been reported. On the other hand, recently some researches concentrated on understanding of closed shell d 10 Ag⋯Ag interactions result in novel supramolecules [31–36] and highly electrical conducting material [37]. This paper describes hydrothermal syntheses, single crystal structure, thermal behavior and electricity property of the new silver organodiphosphonate, which contains a zeolite-like framework and a three-dimensional Ag⋯Ag interacted substructural net: [Ag4(O3PCH2CH2PO3)] (1). 2 Experimental 2.1 Generals 1,2-Ethylenediphosphonic acid was prepared according the reported method [38,39]. Other chemicals with reagent grade quality obtained from commercial sources without further purification. Elemental analysis and infrared spectra were performed with a Vario EL III element analyzer and a Nicolet Magna 750 FT-IR spectrometer, respectively. 2.2 Preparation of [Ag4(O3PCH2CH2PO3)] (1) A mixture of AgNO3 (0.1708g, 1.005mmol), H2O3PCH2CH2PO3H2 (0.1005g, 0.5287mmol), NaF (0.0820g, 1.95mmol), H2O (5.0mL) and ethanol (5.0mL) was sealed in 25ml Teflon-lined stainless steel vessels and heated at 120°C for 72h. The role of NaF is increasing pH of reaction through forming HF. After the mixture slowly cooling to ambient temperature, dark yellow needle-like crystals were obtained. The pattern of powder XRD is agreement with that of simulated from single crystal X-ray data, which indicates a homogeneous phase. Yield 0.1091g (70% based on AgNO3). Elemental analysis for 1: calcd. for Ag4O6P2C2H4: C 3.89, H 0.65%. Found: C 3.88, H 0.78%. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3386vs, 2245m, 1674m, 1417w, 1184m, 1107s, 1043s, 958s, 756w. 2.3 Single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction X-ray data were collected on a suitable single crystal with dimensions 0.46mm×0.06mm×0.04mm at 293±2K on a Siemens SMART-CCD diffractometer using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ(Mo-Kα)=0.71073Å). Data were reduced and absorption corrected with SMART and SADABS software, respectively. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F 2 using SHELXTL-97 [40]. All non-hydrogen atoms were treated anisotropically. The positions of hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically. Details of crystal data and structural refinement for 1 are given in Table 1 . Crystallographic data for the structure reported in this paper have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as supplementary publication no. CCDC_246696. Copies of the data can be obtained free of charge on application to CCDC, 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK (fax: (44) 1223 336-033; e-mail: deposit@ccdc.cam.ac.uk). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was acquired on a DMAX-2500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. 2.4 Thermal analysis Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C unit at a heating rate of 5°C under nitrogen gas flow from 30 to 800°C. 2.5 Electrical property measurement Electrical conductivity measurements were performed on complex impedance spectroscopy with an Agilent 4284A precision LCR meter. A pellet of polycrystalline about 4.5mm diameter and 0.5mm thickness was prepared by a 709YP-15A powder tablet press at room temperature. Silver electrodes on two faces of the pellet were obtained by application of KD-II Room-temperature Fast-drying Electrically Conductive Adhesive. The pellet was heated at 90°C for an hour before tested. The measurements were carried out with temperature increasing (50→170°C) and then decreasing (170→50°C) processes with 10°C interval in an Electric Thermo-static Drier, which controlled by an AI-708P Programmed Automation Regulator. The frequency range for measurements was 20–106 Hz. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Thermal property As shown in Fig. 1 , TGA and DSC of 1 under nitrogen gas flow reveals that there is little weight loss up to 300°C and a decomposing centered at 329°C, respectively. The total weight loss from 300 to 440°C is 3.88% (calculated loss of ethylene group=4.54%). Following that, two continuous weight loss stages are in the temperature range of 440–600°C and 600–799°C with 4.61% (calculated loss of 1/3 PO4=5.07%) and 2.25% mass losses, respectively. Polycrystalline of 1 was heated at a heating rate of 0.4°Cmin−1 from room temperature to 170°C in an Electric Thermo-static Drier and held at 170°C for 2h in air atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, powder XRD pattern is agreement with that simulated from single crystal X-ray data, which indicates little structure change (Fig. 2 ). 3.2 Crystal structure description The asymmetric unit of 1 contains two crystallographically distinct Ag(I) atoms (Fig. 3a ). Ag1(I) and Ag2(I) atoms are in distorted tetrahedron [Ag1O4] and triangle [Ag2O3] coordination geometry, respectively. Each oxygen atoms of [Ag1O4] and [Ag2O3] are from different 1,2-ethylenediphosphonate groups with Ag1–O and Ag2–O bond lengths in range of 2.305(12)–2.530(11)Å and 2.203(12)–2.380(11)Å, respectively. [Ag1O4] tetrahedron shares a corner with [Ag2O3] triangle through one oxygen atom (O2). On the other hand, each [PO3] of 1,2-ethylendiphosphonate group coordinate to seven Ag(I) atoms through two μ 3–O (O2c and O3g) and one μ 4–O (O2). As a result, the distances of Ag1⋯Ag2, Ag1⋯Ag1b, Ag1⋯Ag2c and Ag2⋯Ag2e are 3.214(2), 3.063(3), 3.223(2) and 3.173(3)Å, respectively, which are shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii of two silver atoms (3.44Å) [41], indicating four Ag⋯Ag interactions [32,33]. It is interesting that four-metal units [Ag4O4] connect alternatively through two Ag1–O1 and one Ag1⋯Ag1 interaction into one-dimensional wave-like [–Ag–O–] chain along a axis (Fig. 3b). Simultaneously, a one-dimensional zig–zag Ag(I) chain hide in the [–Ag–O–] chain based on Ag⋯Ag interactions. The [–Ag–O–] chains are interlaced by 1,2-ethylenediphosphonate groups into a three-dimensional zeolite-like framework with one-dimensional ellipse-like channels along a axis (Fig. 1c). The ellipse channels are occupied by ethylene groups. While the zig–zag Ag(I) chains are connected by Ag1⋯Ag2 into a three-dimensional Ag⋯Ag interacted substructural net (Fig. 3d). Compound 1 has one-dimensional channels, which is similar to zeolite. The structure of 1 is obviously different from the common pillar-like structures of metal organodiphosphonates in following two aspects [10–28]: (1) In the structure 1 there is a three-dimensional Ag–O with one-dimensional channels, while there are two-dimensional metal-oxygen layers in pillar-like structure. (2) Organodiphosphonate groups are inclused in the channel, but in common pillar-like structure the organodiphosphnate groups lie between two metal-oxygen layer. 3.3 Electrical property The impedance (−Z″ vs. Z′) curves at each temperature in the range of 50–170°C are composed of only one arc, respectively, due to the response of the grain interior [42]. The conductivities at each of the temperatures have been calculated based on the intercept of low frequencies of the arcs with the real Z′-axis, respectively. The grain interior conductivity of the compound as a function of reciprocal temperatures (1000/T) with increasing and decreasing temperature processes are showed in Fig. 4 . The result of temperature increasing process almost coincides with that of temperature decreasing process. And each curve shows only one linear dependency. According to the definition of Kittel [43], the conductivity of semiconductors is 10−9–102 Scm−1, in the temperature range of 100–170°C 1 belongs to semiconductor. The activation energies associated with the grain interior conductivity is 0.70 and 0.67eV based on temperature increasing and decreasing processes, respectively. At 170°C the maximum conductivities reached to 6.5×10−7 and 7.3×10−7 Scm−1 according to temperature increasing and decreasing processes, respectively. 3.4 Electric band structure Electric band-structure calculations are preformed for 1 by using the formalism of the extended Hückel theory (EHT) crystal orbital method [44,45]. X-ray crystallographic data are used to describe the unit cell. For the semiempirical calculations, only the outer valence orbitals are adopted for all atoms, as shown in Table 2 . The parameters, ionization energy H ii and STO exponents ξ for Ag, O, P, C and H atoms used in the EHT calculations are also given in Table 2, which are kept constant. As shown in Fig. 5 , its energy gap is 3.28eV, which is also in the range of the semiconductors. Ag 4 d electrons bands are dominatingly lying in the district 1.3–3.1eV lower than Fermi level (−12.28eV), while the ones consisted of its 5 p orbitals are mainly 6.8eV higher than Fermi level. The characterizations of the top of valence-bands are two degenerate π antibonding bands between O 2 p and P 3 p orbitals of –PO3 group, whereas the bottom of conductor-bands are mainly the antibonding bands between Ag 5 s and O 2 p orbital and the bond bands among Ag 5 s orbitals. Therefore, under the thermal or optical excitation, the conductivity of 1 is mainly due to the transfer of π aitibonding electrons of –PO3 group through O atom to Ag 5 s orbital, which leads to the electrons hold on Ag–O σ antibonding bands and Ag–Ag bonding ones. After magnifying the −17.25 to 0.40eV region of the density of states (DOS) plot, it can be seen that DOS of Ag 4 d , 5 s and 5 p are actually full of this region. It is due to the mixing of high energy s and p functions into predominantly d-type molecular orbitals that the Ag–Ag antibonding component in silver d-band region is depressed, which results in the replacement of closed-shell d 10 – d 10 repulsive interactions by weakly bonding interactions [46–50]. As shown in Fig. 6 , the strength of Ag⋯Ag interaction is much smaller than that of P⋯O and Ag⋯O interactions under Fermi level. As excitated, electrons transfer to Ag–O antibonding bands and the strong Ag⋯Ag interaction bonding bands over Fermi level. The compound's Ag–O bond and Ag⋯Ag interaction are weakened and enhanced, respectively, which favors to promote the formation of the three-dimensional Ag⋯Ag bonded substructural net shown in Fig. 3(d). This substructure which exists in many silver compounds [50] is to further improve the conductivity of 1. Just as the formation of the Ag⋯Ag interacted substructure, 1 bear the semiconductor character under excitation, which is in good agreement with its conductivity and structural characteristic. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, we have described the syntheses, structure characterization and electric property of the new silver organodiphosphonate [Ag4(O3PCH2CH2PO3)] 1. The structure is a zeolite-like three-dimensional structure with one-dimensional channels containing ethylene groups and a three-dimensional Ag⋯Ag interacted substructural net. The grain interior conductivity of 1 increases continuously with temperature rising in the range of 50–170°C. From EHT calculations, it is shown that under the thermal or optical excitation, the conductivity of 1 is mainly due to the transfer of π antibonding electrons of –PO3 group through O atom to Ag 5 s orbital, which also leads to the enhancement of Ag⋯Ag interaction and prompts the formation of the Ag⋯Ag bonded substructural net.
