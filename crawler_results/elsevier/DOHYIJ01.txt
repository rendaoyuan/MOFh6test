Graphical abstract Three unusual 3D 3d–4f coordination polymer, [LnCu(nic)2(ox)]· xH2O [Ln=La, x =1 (1); Ln=Eu, x =2 (2); Ln=Gd, x =2 (3)] [ox=oxalate, nic=nicotinate] have been successfully synthesized. All three structures exhibit same unusual 3D microporous heterometallic coordination frameworks that are built up by rare tetranuclear Ln2Cu2 clusters and mixed ox and nic linkers. Furthermore, the fluorescent property of complex 2 has been investigated. The self-assembly of nicotinic acid and sodium oxalate with mixed 3d–4f metal salts under hydrothermal conditions gave three isostructural 3D 3d–4f coordination polymers, [LnCu(nic)2(ox)]· xH2O [Ln=La, x =1 (1); Ln=Eu, x =2 (2); Ln=Gd, x =2 (3)] [ox=oxalate, nic=nicotinate]. All three structures exhibit same unusual 3D microporous heterometallic coordination frameworks that are built up by rare tetranuclear Ln2Cu2 clusters and mixed ox and nic linkers. Furthermore, the luminescent property of complex 2 has also been investigated. Keywords Hydrothermal synthesis Isostructures Ln2Cu2 cluster Luminescence In recent years, considerable research effort have been devoted to the design and synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) open metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [1], not only because of their fascinating topology that are similar to those of zeolite-type materials, but also due to their potential applications in ion exchange, gas storage, catalysis and luminescent probe [2–6]. A variety of porous coordination frameworks have been reported so far, but most work has been exclusively focused on the assembly of the homometallic porous MOFs [1–5,6a], while the chemistry as well as the synthetic strategy toward heterometallic coordination polymers has received less attention [6b–c,7]. New functional porous materials can be constructed by simultaneous assembly of organic ligands with both lanthanide and transition metal ions. The construction of open heterometallic coordination frameworks, however, is still a formidable task due to the variable and versatile coordination numbers of the lanthanide ions, their low stereochemical preference and also because of competitive reactions between lanthanide and transition metals coordinated to the same organic ligands [7a]. Nevertheless, fortunately, according to the hard-soft acid base theory, lanthanide and transition metal ions have different affinities for O and N donors, which thus provides the impetus to construct unusual multi-dimensional heterometallic coordination frameworks with useful physical–chemical properties and intriguing structural topologies [8]. Nicotinic acid is such a potential bifunctional ligand, which can thus be used to construct high-dimensional heterometallic frameworks. For example, Xue et al. have successfully synthesized a novel heterometallic coordination polymer, [Nd(H2O)2(CuI)2(nic)3]·H2O, which exhibits a 3D heterometallic coordination framework constructed from the spontaneous assembly of the Cu4I4 clusters and lanthanide-carboxylate subunits [9a]. Yang et al. obtained a heterometallic cluster compound, [Ce2(ina)5(na)2(H2O)2][Cu5Br4] (ina=isonicotinate; na=nicotinate), which is built up from two distinct units of the Ln-organic double chains and inorganic [ Cu 5 Br 4 ] n + chains [9b]. On the other hand, much work has been done by using nicotinic acid as a multifunctional ligand, however, few heterometallic coordination frameworks has been reported [9]. In the context, we chose nicotinic acid and oxalate salt as potential bridging ligands to construct high-dimensional coordination polymers, on the basis of the following considerations: (i) the oxalate ligand has versatile coordination modes and can meet the high coordination number of lanthanide metal ions. (ii) the rigid nic ligand showing both oxygen and nitrogen donors, its carboxylate group prefers to bond to Ln ions, while the nitrogen atom has a strong tendency to TM ions, thus the soft metal copper(I) ion can easily coordinate to the nitrogen atom, the lanthanides, i.e. La, Eu and Gd as hard metal ions can bond to the carboxylate group [10]. In this way, the extended solids containing Ln–Cu entities might be obtained. Herein, we report the systematic syntheses [11] and structures of three isostructural 3D 3d–4f microporous coordination polymers [LaCu(nic)2(ox)]·H2O (1), [EuCu(nic)2(ox)]·2H2O (2), [GdCu(nic)2(ox)]·2H2O (3), which exhibit same unusual 3D microporous heterometallic coordination frameworks that are built up by rare tetranuclear Ln2Cu2 clusters and mixed ox and nic linkers. These complexes have been characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single crystal diffraction, and by photoluminescence. The IR spectra of complexes 1–3 show a broad band in the region of 3323–3331 cm−1, which may be assigned to the ν(O–H) stretching vibrations of the water molecules. The features at 1566–1616cm−1 and 1406–1416cm−1, are associated with the asymmetric (COO) and symmetric (COO) stretching vibrations. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies [12] revealed that the three complexes are isomorphous, so only the structure of 3 is described in detail here. Compound 3 represents a 3D open coordination framework constructed by tetranuclear Gd2Cu2 clusters and mixed nic and ox ligands, crystallizing in monoclinic space group P21/c. An ORTEP plot of 3 is shown in Fig. 1 . There are one Gd(III) ion, one Cu(I) ion, two nic anions, one oxalate (0.5+0.5) anion and two lattice water molecules in the asymmetric unit, in which each Gd center is coordinated by eight oxygen donors. Four out of the eight are from four nic ligands, other four are from two oxalate anions. The coordination geometry around the Gd center can be described as a bicapped trigonal prism geometry with the O–Gd–O bond angles ranging from 66.4(1)° to 148.8(1)° and the Gd–O bond lengths varying from 2.309(3) to 2.482(3)Å. As far as Cu(I) ion in the coordination framework is concerned, it is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two different nic ligands and two oxygen atoms from one chelating carboxylate group of ox ligand to furnish a tetrahedral geometry. The Cu–N bond distances are 1.910(4) and 1.919(4)Å, two Cu–O bond distances are distinct, one is 2.292(3)Å, while the other is 2.770(2)Å, being a weak Cu–O interaction that can be observed in other structures [13]. Two nic ligands in 3, only adopt one coordination mode with the nitrogen atom coordinating to one Cu center and the carboxylate connecting two Gd centers through a bismonodentate coordination. Two ox ligands adopt two coordination modes: one coordinates to two Gd centers via a chelating coordination, while the other is one rare coordination mode with not only coordinating to two Gd centers via five-membered rings coordination, but bonding to two Cu centers via four-membered rings coordination. Further investigation on other structures of oxalate dianions, few heterometallic cluster with same coordination modes is found [14]. In the polymeric structure of 3, a Gd2Cu2 tetranuclear cluster is constructed by the linkage of twelve nic ligands and three ox ligands (Fig. S1), in which the square Gd2Cu2(ox) heterometallic cluster is unprecedented, comparable to one reported ‘Z-shaped’ Gd2Cu2 heterometallic cluster [9a]. These clusters are interconnected by nic and ox ligands and propagate to form a three-dimensional coordination framework. Interestingly, there are small channels along c-axis of unit cell, hosting free water molecules, which are stabilized through hydrogen bonds involving the carboxyl oxygen atoms of nic ligands and water molecules. The two free water molecules in turn assemble themselves via hydrogen bonds into an infinite water chain running along the c-axis direction (Fig. 2 a). The 3D heterometallic coordination framework can also be regarded as the spontaneous assembly of Gd–Cu carboxylate layers and nic linkers. The carboxylate groups of nic and ox ligands connect lanthanide and copper centers to construct 2D Gd–Cu carboxylate layers in the ac-plane (Fig. 2b). The nic ligands thus interlink adjacent Gd–Cu carboxylate layers to build up the open heterometallic coordination framework (Fig. S2). The structural motifs of 1–3 complexes show extreme similarity with slight difference in the number of lattice water molecules. In the complexes 2 and 3 the empty spaces are occupied by two lattice water molecules per formula unit, while only one water molecule is located in the cavity of compound 1. The general trend of decreasing bond lengths from 1 to 3 with increasing atomic number has been observed, which can be ascribed to the lanthanide contraction effect (Table S1). Due to the excellent luminescent property of Eu(III) ions, the photoluminescence of nic and 2 was investigated. The emission of nic ligand was observed at about 378nm (λ ex =329nm) with a relatively intense broad band (Fig. S3). The solid state emission spectrum of 2 (Fig. 3 ) was studied at room temperature upon excitation at 395nm exhibits the characteristic transition of 5D0 → 7FJ (J =0→4) of Eu(III) ions. The appearance of the symmetry-forbidden emission 5D0 → 7F0 at 579nm indicates that Eu(III) ions in 2 possess low symmetry [15], which thus agrees with the single-crystal X-ray analysis. The emission band 5D0 → 7F1 at 591 and 594nm is a magnetic dipole transition and its intensity should vary with the crystal field strength acting on the Eu(III) ion. The 5D0 → 7F2 transition, on the other hand, is an electric dipole transition and the intensity of the 5D0 → 7F2 transition increases as the site symmetry of the Eu(III) ions decreases. The red emission of 5D0 → 7F2 transition at 616nm and 618nm is the most intense, which suggests that the ligands are suitable for the sensitization of red luminescence for Eu(III) ion at room temperature [16]. The intensity ratio I(5D0 → 7F2)/I(5D0 → 7F1) is equal to ca. 6.1, which also suggests that the non-centrosymmetric coordination environment of Eu(III) ions in 2 [17]. In addition, ligand-to-copper energy transfer is inefficient, which is testified by no other emission peaks existing in the emission spectrum except the characteristic emission peaks of Eu(III) ions [18]. In conclusion, we have synthesized three novel isostructural microporous heterometallic coordination polymers containing rare tetranuclear Ln2Cu2 clusters, which are constructed from mixed ox and nic linkers. The structures provide new opportunities for other 3d–4f heterometallic coordination frameworks containing nic ligand to be applied in the field of porous materials. This successful synthetic idea will be used to prepare other novel high-dimensional lanthanide-transition metal heterometallic coordination polymers materials with particular functions.
