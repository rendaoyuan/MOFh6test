The bptcH4 ligand with plentiful chemical information displays diverse coordination modes. And, the complexes exhibit strong luminescent properties. Three complexes, {[Cd(bptcH2)(H2O)]·H2O} n (1), {[Cu(bptc)0.5(H2O)]·H2O} n (2), {[Co2(bptc)(H2O)6]·3H2O} n (3) (bptcH4 =2,2′-bipyridine-3,3′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acid) have been synthesized by self-assembly of the rigid bptcH4 ligand and corresponding transition metal salts. The structural analysis indicates that complex 1 displays a two-dimensional (2D) puckered sheet with (44·62) topology built from 4-connecting Cd3N2(OOC)3 cluster and bridging ligand bptcH2 2−. Complex 2 features a one-dimensional (1D) double-stranded chain made up 4-connecting bptc4− and Cu4N2(OOC)4 cluster. Complex 3 also exhibits a 2D grid with (44·62) topology, similar to that of complex 1. In addition, the fluorescence properties of complexes 1 and 3 have also been explored. Keywords 2,2′-Bipyridine-3,3′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acid Transition metal complexes Crystal structure Fluorescence properties 1 Introduction Exploring highly multitopic ligands and suitable metal salts to construct coordination networks has attracted extensive interest in the field of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering [1]. The well-designed motifs are of special interest, which have recently been reviewed by Batten, Robson, and other chemists [2,3]. Such systems not only exhibit a variety of intriguing aesthetic structures and topologies but also show promising applications as functional materials [1a,d,4]. In this regard, many papers have recently been concerned with structures, adsorptions, magnetic and luminescent properties, and so on, based on transition metal ions containing carboxylate ligands [5]. As good candidates for rigid spacers in the construction of coordination networks, the family of binicotinic acid ligands bearing 2,2′-bipyridyl and dicarboxylate functional groups has been relatively well-known and can show interesting coordination architectures. The two pyridyl rings of binicotinic acid can rotate around the C–C bond, and thus show various conformations according to the geometric requirements of different metal ions and may afford unpredictable and interesting supramolecular networks. A series of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D functional coordination networks have been successfully obtained by using this type of ligand, including 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylic acid [6], 2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-dicarboxylic acid [7,8], 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid [9], and 2,2′-bipyridine-3,3′-dicarboxylic acid [10,11]. However, compared with the complexes formed by the above-mentioned bipyridine-dicarboxylic acid, the coordination networks constructed from bipyridinetetracarboxylic acid ligands have been less studied, although various bipyridinetetracarboxylic acid lignads including 4,4′-bipyridine- 2,2′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic [12], 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic [13], 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic [14] and 2,2′-bipyridine-3,3′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acids [15] have been synthesized. Most of these bipyridinetetracarboxylic acids in the construction of novel coordination networks are rigid, but the two pyridyl rings of them can also rotate around the C–C bond as that of binicotinic acid, and the four carboxyl groups can show some deviation from the corresponding pyridine rings, and thus show versatile conformations so as to satisfy the geometric requirements of different metal ions. Furthermore, the carboxylate groups coordinate to metal ions in a range of diverse modes and provide the potential for the formation of metal–carboxylate clusters or bridging units, which may help enhance the robustness of the resulting network. Meanwhile, its degree of deprotonation affects the number of the functional coordination sites. Therefore, rich topologies, including coordination modes, packing fashions and high dimensionalities of coordination polymers, may be achieved from these interesting ligands. Among these bipyridinetetracarboxylic acids, the coordination properties of 2,2′-bipyridine-3,3′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acid (bptcH4) should be considerably different from other bipyridinetetracarboxylic acids because of steric repulsion of bulky 3,3′-carboxylate groups. The coordinated modes of bptcH4 are shown in Scheme 1 , which is completely different from the reported modes of this ligand. Thus the study on the bptcH4 remains a promising challenge. In our previous studies, by hydrothermal reactions of the lanthanide (III) picrates and bptcH4, we have succeeded in obtaining seven 1-D lanthanide coordination polymers [15a]. Herein, as an extension to our previous investigation, we use bptcH4 as multidentate bridging ligand to construct novel complexes. The syntheses, crystal structures, and fluorescence properties of three complexes, namely, {[Cd(bptcH2)(H2O)]·H2O} n (1), {[Cu(bptc)0.5(H2O)]·H2O}n (2), and {[Co2(bptc)(H2O)6]·3H2O} n (3) will be presented. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and physical techniques 2,2′-Bipyridine-3,3′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acid (bptcH4) was synthesized according to the literature method [15a]. All other chemicals were commercially purchased and used without further purification. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were carried out on a Flash 2000 elemental analyzer. The IR spectra were recorded as KBr pellets on a Nicolet-6700 spectrometer in the 4000–400cm−1 region. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out on a SDT Q600 thermogravimetric analyzer. A platinum pan was used for heating the sample with a heating rate of 10°C/min under a N2 atmosphere. Luminescent spectra were recorded with a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. 2.2 Synthesis of the complexes {[Cd(bptcH2)(H2O)]·H2O}n (1). A mixture of bptcH4 ligand (0.0664g, 0.2mmol), Cd(PiC)2·6H2O (0.271g, 0.4mmol) (PiC=picronitric acid), and H2O (10mL) was sealed in a 23mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container and heated at 130°C for 3days, then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2°Ch−1 and colorless block crystals of 1 were obtained. After filtration, the crystals were washed with DMF and dried in air (166mg yield 90% based on Cd). Anal. Calc. for C14H8CdN2O9: C, 36.50; H, 1.75; N; 6.08. Found: C, 36.72; H, 1.88; N, 6.19%.

A mixture of bptcH4 ligand (0.0664g, 0.2mmol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.0966g, 0.4mmol), and H2O (10mL) was sealed in a 23mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container and heated at 130°C for 3days, then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 4°Ch−1 and green block crystals of 2 were obtained. After filtration, the crystals were washed with water and dried in air (22mg yield 10% based on Cu). Anal. Calc. for C14H10Cu2N2O11: C, 33.01; H, 1.98; N, 5.50. Found: C, 33.16; H, 2.10; N, 5.64%.

A mixture of bptcH4 ligand (0.0664g, 0.2mmol), Co(Ac)2·4H2O (0.0996g, 0.2mmol), and H2O (10mL) was stirred 1h under reflux. The resultant red solution was filtered into the bottom of a straight glass tube. Then, 10mL ethanol was carefully layered onto the above solution.

An empirical absorption correction was applied. The structures were solved with direct methods and refined with full-matrix least-squares techniques using the shelxs-97 and shelxl -97 programs [16]. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. The hydrogen atoms were set in calculated positions and refined as riding atoms with a common isotropic thermal parameter. It must be pointed out that, in complex 3, thermal ellipsoids for O5, O6, O7, O8, O9, and O17 atoms are quite large, which results in high R-values (wR 2 =0.1590). The crystallographic data for 1–3 are listed in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and angles for complexes 1–3 are listed in Table 2 . Hydrogen-bonding data of complexes 1–3 are listed in Table S1 (Supporting information). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and IR spectrum As an excellent ligand for constructing novel network with interesting structures and promising properties, bptcH4 ligand has two carboxylate O atoms and two pyridine N atoms, which result in varied coordination modes and strong coordination abilities with respect to metal ions. On the other hand, hydrothermal synthesis under high pressure and high temperature is a powerful synthetic route to prepare polymeric solids with good crystallinity [18]. In this regard, single crystals of complexes 1 and 2 suitable for X-ray diffraction could be obtained. In each synthetic case, a 2:1M ratio of metal-to-ligand was used for the starting materials, which however, was independent of the composition of the products. Significantly, it is worth noting that decreasing the temperature from 130 to 110°C or increasing the temperature from 130 to 150°C could form the same products 1 and 2 with relatively lower yields. In addition, when the temperature was decreased to 80°C, only precipitates were isolated and their PXRD patterns were inconsistent with those of 1 and 2. As for 3, a direct hydrothermal reaction affords either no evidence of solid formation or a mass of uncharacterized red precipitate. It is well known that properly lowering the reaction rate may facilitate the growth of well-shaped single crystals. Considering this point, we have sequentially achieved the isolation of 3 using the solution diffusion method. All complexes are air-stable and insoluble in common organic solvents and water, due to their polymeric and neutral nature. There are great differences in the coordination modes of the bptcH4 ligand (Scheme 1), which exert an important influence on the crystalline architectures as described below. The infrared spectrum of 1 showed the presence of carboxylic acid groups with ν as(COOH) and ν s(COOH) at 1692 and 1364cm−1, respectively, and carboxylate groups with ν as(COO-) at 1634–1554cm−1 and ν s(COO−) at 1401 and 1404 and 1226cm−1, suggesting that the carboxylate groups are in differing coordination environments. The infrared spectrum of 2 (that for 3 is similar) showed the absence of a carboxylic acid function, and carboxylate groups with ν as(COO−) at 1629 and 1563cm−1; and ν s(COO−) at 1383, 1373 and 1253cm−1, respectively, suggesting that the carboxylate groups are in differing coordination environment to each other and those found in complexes 1. Indeed, the peak separation between ν as(COO−) and ν s(COO−) of the carboxylate groups has a value of Δ =187cm−1 and may be owing to the presence of a bridging carboxylate group. In addition, in complexes 1–3, a narrow band is visible above 3390cm−1 (maximum peaking at 3435cm−1) associated with the highly defined environment of the H-bonded water molecules as depicted by the crystal structures. 3.2 Structure description 3.2.1 Crystal structure of {[Cd(bptcH2)(H2O)]·H2O} n (1) Complex 1 crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group Pca21 which lacks inversion symmetry. Accordingly, the molecules must all be oriented in the same direction along the polar c axis. For example, with their nitrogen atoms, all the ligands are pointing in the same direction (along the c axis in Fig. 1 ). Similar to the previous reports [19], this polar packing in the crystal of 1 probably originates from the molecules having the same orientation along the c axis. Each asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Cd(II) ion, one bptcH2 2- anion, and one coordinated water molecule. As shown in Fig. 1a, the coordination geometry of Cd(II) center can be described as pentagonal bipyramidal. The equatorial plane is composed of two chelating carboxylate oxygen atoms and two N atoms from one bptcH2 2 − anion and one bridging carboxylate oxygen atom from the other bptcH2 2 − anion. The apical positions are situated by one bridging carboxylate oxygen atom from another bptcH2 2 − anion and one aqua molecule. The Cd–N and Cd–O bond lengths lie in the normal ranges of 2.398(6)–2.420(2) and 2.295(6)–2.395(5)Å, respectively. They are comparable to the previously reported values [20]. In 1, the bptcH2 2 − ligand acts as a μ 3-bridge to link three Cd(II) atoms and there are three types of coordination modes for the carboxyl groups, one acts as a syn-anti μ 2–η1:η1-bridge through O2 and O3 atoms, and the remaining two carboxyl groups adopt a monodetate chelating and bridging mode to link Cd(II) atoms through O4 and O9 atoms, respectively, as shown in Scheme 1a. The dihedral angle between two pyridyl rings is 30.6°, whereas the 6,6′-, and 3- three carboxylate groups (centred about C1, C12 and C14), which participated in the coordination with Cd are twisted by 33.1°, 12.7° and 10.2°, respectively, with respect to the pyridyl rings to which they are attached. While, the 3′-carboxylate group (centred C13) which kept uncoordinated and protonated state is twisted by 32.5°. As depicted in Fig. 1b, the monodentate bridging carboxylic group oxygen atoms (O4) link the neighboring Cd(II) ions into a zigzag chain. Adjacent chains are further connected by μ 2–η1:η1-bridging carboxylate groups, giving rise to a 2D puckered sheet (Fig. 1c). A topological analysis of this structure was performed with the TOPOS program [21], which reveals a non-interpenetrating uninodal four-connected (44·62) topology, as depicted in Fig. 1d. In addition, the 2D sheets are linked together through the hydrogen bonding interactions to form a 3D supramolecular structure. The hydrogen bonding data are given in Table S1 (Supporting information). 3.2.2 Crystal structure of {[Cu(bptc)0.5(H2O)]·H2O} n (2) When the Cu2+ cation was utilized in place of Cd2+ cation under hydrothermal conditions, complex 2 was obtained, which possesses an entirely different structure from that of complex 1. Complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. The asymmetric unit consists of one crystallographically unique Cu(II) ion, half bptc4- ion, one coordinated water molecule, and one lattice water molecule. As seen in Fig. 2 a, Cu1 displays a distorted square-pyramidal geometry [22], being bonded to three carboxylate oxygen atoms from two different bptc4 − ligands (Cu–O 2.0220(16)–2.1194(15)Å), one nitrogen atom of bptc4 − ligand (Cu–N 1.9973(18)Å) and one aqua ligand (Cu–O 1.9209(17)Å). In 2, the bptc4 − ligand acts as a μ 4-bridge to link four Cu(II) atoms and there are two types of coordination modes for the carboxyl groups, one adopts the same a syn–anti μ2 –η1:η1-bridge through O3 and O4 atoms as that in 1, and the other one adopt a μ1 –η1:η0-bridging mode, as shown in Scheme 1b. Within this mode, the dihedral angles between two pyridyl rings (63.1°) and angles between the pyridyl rings and the corresponding planes of 3,3′-carboxylate groups (68.1°) are much greater than that in 1, and whereas the 6,6′-carboxylate groups (8.2°) are considerably lower than those for 1. This is caused by all the four carboxylate groups participating in the coordination with Cu and formation strong coordination bonds. In the crystal structure, two crystallographically equivalent Cu atoms are chelated by four carboxylate groups form one bptc4 − ions in a di-tridentate mode to give a dinuclear copper building block [Cu2N2(CO2R)4] with shorter separations of Cu⋯Cu (5.441Å) (Fig. S1, Supporting information). The dinuclear copper building blocks are further connected to each other through carboxylate oxygen atoms of the bptc4− ligands leading to a 1D double-stranded chain (Fig. 2b). The extensive hydrogen bonds exist among the coordinated water, lattice water molecules and carboxylate groups. The four hydrogen bonds that link each chain to two further adjacent chains are, firstly, two bonds between a coordinated water molecule (O5) of one chain and a carboxylate oxygen atom of an adjacent chain (O1) (O5⋯O1, 2.719(2)Å) and a adjacent lattice water (O6) (O5⋯O6, 2.612(3)Å). Secondly, the lattice water molecule (O6) hydrogen bonds to a carboxylate oxygen atom (O2) (O6⋯O2, 2.786(3)Å) of one chain and the other carboxylate oxygen atom of a second adjacent chain (O3) (O6⋯O3, 3.047(3)Å), thereby linking the two chains to one another to form the 3D hydrogen bonded network (Fig. S1(c), Supporting information). Details of the hydrogen bond interactions are brought together within Table S1 (Supporting information). 3.2.3 Crystal structure of {[Co2(bptc)(H2O)6]·3H2O} n (3) Complex 3 displays a 2-D sheet structure with 44·62 topology. The asymmetric unit contains one Co(II) ion with a general position, two one-half Co(II) ions in special positions, two one-half bptc4− ions, six coordinated water molecules, and three lattice water molecule. As shown in Fig. 3 a, both Co1 and Co3 ions display a slightly distorted octahedral coordination geometry coordinated by two oxygen atoms from two individual bptc4− ligands, and four oxygen atoms from four water coordinated molecules. The Co2 ion also displays a slightly distorted octahedral defined by two nitrogen and two oxygen atoms from two individual bptc4− ligands, and two oxygen atoms from two water coordinated molecules. The Co–N distances are 2.171(6) and 2.214(6)Å, respectively, and the Co–O bonds range from 2.030(5) to 2.171(6)Å. In addition, the bond angles around each Co(II) range from 76.9(2)° to 180.00(1)° (Table 2), all of which are comparable to those reported for other N-heterocyclic carboxylate Co(II) complexes [23]. In 3, the bptc4− ligand acts as a μ 4-bridge to link four Co(II) atoms and there are two types of coordination modes for the carboxyl groups, one adopts a μ-η1:η0-chelating mode through O13 and O14 atoms, and the other one adopts a μ–η1:η0-bridging mode, as shown in Scheme 1c. Within this mode, two pyridyl rings are almost perpendicular with the dihedral angles of 78.2°, whereas the 6-, and 3-carboxylate groups (centred about C6, and C7), which participated in the coordination with Co are twisted by 6.6 and 46.0°, respectively, with respect to the pyridyl rings to which they are attached. The coordination of bptc4− is such that it interacts with four Co(II) metal centers, with the 6- and 6′-carboxylate groups chelating between two of them, whilst a 3- and 3′-carboxylate groups link to the other two metals, such that a 2D grid results, as shown in Fig. 3b. In this grid, the twisting mode (78.2°) between two pyridine rings makes the two didentate sites toward the opposite to coordinate with Co(II) center to produce double-stranded dimer. The anionic dimer are further connect to four aqua Co(II) cations, resulting in a 16-membered metallic ring. From the viewpoint of network topology, all bptc4- can be regarded as four-connected nodes, and thus the 2D grid structure can be simplified as a non-interpenetrating uninodal four-connected (44·62) topology (Fig. 3c), similar to that of complexes 1 and 2. As shown in Fig. S2 (Supporting information), the coordinated water molecules and lattice water molecules are linked together by hydrogen-bonding interactions to form a discrete (H2O)8 cluster, which is stabilized by H-bonding interactions (Table S1, Supporting information) involving nearby carboxylate O atoms of the bptc4− ligand, resulting in a 3D supramolecular network. In the discrete (H2O)8 cluster, the O⋯O distance ranges from 2.625 to 3.21Å, i.e., 2.625Å for O7⋯O9, 2.635Å for O1⋯O7, and 3.21Å for O8⋯O9, resulting in an average O⋯O separation of 2.908Å. Interestingly, four coordination water molecules in the (H2O)8 clusters are bound to the three Co ions, respectively, which can act as hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, resulting in the overall 3D structure of complex 3. Thus, the (H2O)8 cluster is stabilized not only by hydrogen bonds but also by coordination interactions. These results indicate that the hydrogen-bonded water clusters not only fill the voids in the supramolecular framework but also contribute to the total lattice energy [24]. This is similar to the water cluster in the previous reports [25]. 3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis To investigate their thermal stabilities, thermogravimetric analyses (Fig. S3, Supporting information) of complexes 1–3 were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere. Complexes 1–3 show similar thermal behaviors. For 1, an initial weight loss started at 285°C, with the observed weight loss of 8.1% corresponding to the release of one coordinated and one lattice water (calcd 7.8%). Subsequently, it keeps losing weight at about 372°C corresponding to the decomposition of the organic units of remaining bptcH2 2 − units. Complex 2 is thermally stable to 103°C, with the first weight loss between 110 and 132°C (16.8%), corresponding to the release of one coordinated water molecule and one lattice water (calcd 13.7%). The second weight loss, between 290 and 370°C (21.2%), is attributed to partial decomposition of the organic units. While for complex 3, the loss of all water molecules (calc. 26.7%) occurs in 55–190°C (found: 26.9%), and the rapid weight loss in the temperature range 200–450°C indicates the decomposition of the structure. 3.4 Fluorescence properties Investigations of the solid emissions of bptcH4, 1, and 3 indicate, that the intraligand fluorescence emission wavelength and intensity can be tuned by altering the configuration of bptcH4, i.e. the dihedral angle between its pyridine moieties. The free ligand bptcH4 has two weak luminescent emission bands centered at ca. 217 and 266nm, respectively, assigned to the intraligand π→π∗ transitions. Comparing with that of the free ligand, the similar but stronger emissions (λ max. at 223 and 269nm) can be observed. Thus, these emissions can be tentatively assigned to the intraligand fluorescence emission (Fig. 4 ). Generally, the intraligand fluorescence emission wavelength of a multi-pyridine ligand is determined by the energy gap between π and π ∗ molecular orbitals of the free ligand, which is simply related to the extent of π conjugation in the system. For bptcH4, however, whose 2,2′-bipyridyl moiety can rotate along the 1,1′ bond, the π and π∗ energy levels may be perturbed by the dihedral angle between the pyridine rings according to Perkovic’s hypothesis [11]. Further, compared to ligand, the emission wavelengths of complexes 1 and 3 undergo red-shift. These shifts are presumably a result of the configuration of bptcH4. As the dihedral angle of the 2,2′-bipyridyl moiety changes from 18.2° in bptcH4 to 30.6° in 1, and 78.2° in 3, the energy gap between the π and π ∗ molecular orbitals of bptcH4 increases. The maximum emission wavelength of 3 is located at 336nm. The emission intensities of complexes 1 and 3 increase relative to that of bptcH4, and this phenomenon results from the coordination of bptcH4 to metal ions, which increases the conformational rigidity of the ligands, therefore reducing the non-radiative decay of the intraligand (π–π ∗) excited state. Similar enhancements of the intraligand fluorescence have also been found in the reported complexes [7,26,27]. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have synthesized three complexes through the self-assembly of transition metal ions with 2,2′-bipyridine-3,3′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acid (bptcH4). Complexes 1 and 3 possess a (4,4)-2D sheet, and complex 2 exhibits a 1-D double-stranded chain. The ligand bptcH4 exhibits diverse coordination conformations and modes owing to the rotate degree of its two pyridine rings. This study shows that using multidentate ligands in combination of control of synthetic parameters such as reaction conditions and metals could lead to new compounds with interesting structures and properties. In addition, complexes 1 and 3 display fluorescence emissions at different wavelengths, which may result in their exploitation in photo-materials.

<p>Publication of your CIF<br>You should attempt to resolve as many as possible of the alerts in all categories.<br>Often the minor alerts point to easily fixed oversights, errors and omissions in your<br>CIF or refinement strategy, so attention to these fine details can be worthwhile. In<br>order to resolve some of the more serious problems it may be necessary to carry out<br>additional measurements or structure refinements. However, the nature of your study<br>may justify the reported deviations from journal submission requirements and the<br>more serious of these should be commented upon in the discussion or experimental<br>section of a paper or in the "special_details" fields of the CIF. checkCIF was carefully<br>designed to identify outliers and unusual parameters, but every test has its<br>limitations and alerts that are not important in a particular case may appear.<br>Conversely, the absence of alerts does not guarantee there are no aspects of the<br>results needing attention. It is up to the individual to critically assess their own<br>results and, if necessary, seek expert advice.<br>If level A alerts remain, which you believe to be justified deviations, and you intend<br>to submit this CIF for publication in a journal, you should additionally insert an<br>explanation in your CIF using the Validation Reply Form (VRF) below. This will allow<br>your explanation to be considered as part of the review process.<br># start Validation Reply Form<br>_vrf_PUBL006_GLOBAL<br>;<br>PROBLEM: _publ_requested_journal is missing<br>RESPONSE: ...<br>;<br>_vrf_PUBL012_GLOBAL<br>;<br>PROBLEM: _publ_section_abstract is missing.<br>RESPONSE: ...<br>;<br>_vrf_PLAT417_3<br>;<br>PROBLEM: Short Inter D-H..H-D H5W ..
