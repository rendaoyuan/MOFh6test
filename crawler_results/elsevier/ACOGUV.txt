Three new zinc(II) complexes constructed by homophthalate (hpht) and dimine ligand, [Zn(phen)(hpht)(H2O)] n (1), [Zn(2,2′-bpy)(hpht)] n 2.5nH2O (2) and [Zn2(4,4′-bpy)(hpht)2(H2O)2] n nH2O (3), have been solvothermally synthesized and structurally characterized. X-ray single-crystal diffraction analyses reveal that 1 is 2D supromolecular framework formed by discrete dimers through hydrogen bonding and π–π interaction. 2 has a 2D layer structure formed by dimeric units through π–π interaction of 2,2′-bpy and phenyl ring of hpht, with water molecules as space fillers. 3 is an interesting 2D network which contains ladder-like double chains, and the ‘ladders’ are connected to each other by binuclear macrocyclic rings. Keywords Homophthalate Zn(II) complex Solvothermal synthesis Crystal structure 1 Introduction Considerable attentions have been paid to the design and synthesis of inorganic–organic hybrid coordination polymeric frameworks due to their potential applications in many areas [1–4]. The generally synthetic strategy for designing such materials is using multidentate ligands containing O- or N-donor, such as polycarboxylic acids and bipyridine [5–8]. Symmetrical benzene dicarboxylic acids, such as phthalic acid and terephthalic acid, as O-donor ligands, due to their versatile bonding modes and high symmetries, have been widely used in combination of N-donor ligands to synthesize coordination polymers containing transition metals [9,10]. However, many unsymmetrical and flexible benzene carboxylic acids such as homophthalic acid have rarely been used, and the study on the structures constructed from these ligands remains undeveloped [11,12]. Our aim is to use such ligands to construct metal-organic complexes with interesting topology or properties for potential application, and to investigate the factors influencing the coordination mode of the ligands and control the final structure of the complexes. We hope to find out a useful strategy to manipulate the design and syntheses of complexes of the unsymmetrical and flexible ligands. Compared with phthalic acid, unsymmetrical homophthalic acid (H2hpht) has a relative flexible ethylic carboxyl group, which may be not co-planar with benzene. The flexibility makes H2hpht has various conformations as well as coordination modes. On the other hand, the flexibility makes it more difficult to forecast and control the final structure. Burrow has reported two zinc complexes constructed from homophthalic acid (H2hpht) previously [13,14], and Cotton reported a molybdenum complex [15]. All of the three complexes have the dimeric structures and reveal the monodentate as well as chelating and bridging coordination modes of carboxyl groups. Recently, we have reported four cadmium complexes constructed from homophthalic acid and diimines [16]. However, data on zinc homophthalate complexes containing diimines have not been reported yet. Herein we report the syntheses and X-ray diffraction study of three zinc(II) complexes [Zn(phen)(hpht)(H2O)] n (1), [Zn(2,2′-bpy)(hpht)] n 2.5nH2O (2) and [Zn2(4,4′-bpy)(hpht)2(H2O)2] n nH2O (3), where phen=1,10-phenanthroline, bpy=bipyridine. 2 Experimental 2.1 General All chemicals are used as purchased without further purification. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out with a NETZSCH STA 449C unit at a heating rate of 15°Cmin−1 under nitrogen. IR spectra were recorded on a Magna 750 FT-IR spectrophotometer as KBr pallets. Elemental analyses were carried out on an Elementar Vario EL III analyzer. 2.2 Synthesis of [Zn(phen)(hpht)(H2O)]n (1) H2hpht (0.055g, 0.3mmol), phen (0.060g, 0.3mmol), and Zn(NO3)2 6H2O (0.09g, 0.3mmol) were put in a mixed solution of 8mL distilled H2O and 2mL ethanol, and the pH was adjusted to about 4.2 by diluent NaOH aqueous solution. Then the mixture was sealed in 25mL Teflon-lined reactor and heated to 160°C for 3 days, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Colorless prism crystals of 1 were collected and washed with distilled water (yield: 36%). Anal. Calc. For 1: H, 3.65; C, 57.10; N, 6.34. Found: H, 3.86; C, 56.86; N, 6.08%. IR(KBr) 3428wb, 3058m, 3001m, 2941m, 1605vs, 1581s, 1557s, 1517s, 1414s, 1382vs, 1174m, 851s, 745s, 729s, 678m. 2.3 Synthesis of [Zn(2,2′-bpy)(hpht)]n 2.5nH2O (2) The synthetic procedure of 2 is essentially the same as that for 1, while 2,2′-bpy (0.047g, 0.3mmol) was used to replace phen, and the pH was adjusted to about 5.8. Colorless prism crystals of 2 were collected and washed with distilled water (yield: 28%). Anal. Calc. For 2: H, 4.31; C, 51.31; N, 6.30. Found: H, 4.23; C, 51.40; N, 6.23%. IR(KBr) 3342mb, 3080m, 2972m, 1611vs, 1494m, 1444s, 1376vs, 1264m, 1025m, 755s, 730s. 2.4 Synthesis of [Zn2(4,4′-bpy)(hpht)2(H2O)2]n nH2O (3) The synthetic procedure of 3 is the same as that for 2, except that 4,4′-bpy (0.47g,0.3mmol) was used to replace 2,2′-bpy and the pH was adjusted to about 5.6. Colorless prism crystals of 3 were collected and washed with distilled water (yield: 26%). Anal. Calc. For 3: H, 3.76; C, 48.23; N, 4.02. Found: H, 3.70; C, 48.29; N, 3.86%. IR(KBr) 3389mb, 2960w, 1604s,1532s,1399vs, 807m, 733m, 631m. 2.5 X-Ray data collection and structure determination The intensity data of 1, 2, 3 were collected on a Rigaku CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromatized MoKα (λ=0.71073Å) radiation at 173K, and the empirical absorption corrections were performed using the CrystalClear program [17]. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined on F 2 by full-matrix least-squares using the SHELXTL-97 program package [18]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The organic hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically (C–H=0.95Å). The H atoms on water molecules were located from E-maps, but all hydrogen atoms of free water in 2 and one hydrogen atom of the coordinated water (O10) in 3 could not be located and were not taken into consideration. The hydrogen atoms of the free water (O11) in complex 3 were refined with DFIX constraints on the O–H bonds of 0.82Å. The crystallographic data for three complexes are listed in Table 1 . 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Syntheses Complexes 1–3 have been obtained as crystalline materials by solvothermal reactions, with the same mole ratio of starting materials of H2hpht, auxiliary ligand and metal salt. The pH values were adjusted by using NaOH aqueous solution. It is only within the specific pH range that complexes 1–3 can be synthesized and different pH values lead to different yields. The pH values that lead to the maximum yields of the crystals have been indicated in foregoing section. The suitable pH range for synthesizing complex 1 is 4.0–4.5, and lower pH value produces nothing but the pure liquid, while higher value producing precipitates only. For complex 2, the suitable range is 5.3–6.0, and lower or higher pH values bring pure liquid or precipitates only. For 3, the crystals can be obtained within pH=4.9–5.7, and out of this range the reactions produce only precipitates. 3.2 Crystal structure of complex 1 The selected bond lengths and angles of complex 1 are listed in Table 2 . The asymmetric unit of 1 consists a Zn(II) ion, a phen, a hpht2− and a coordinated H2O. The Zn(II) ion is six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from a chelating phen ligand and four oxygen atoms, three of which from two hpht2− and one from coordinated H2O in a distorted octahedron coordination geometry. The Zn–O(N) bond distances are in the range 2.045–2.255Å, with an average value of 2.136Å. In the hpht2− ligand, the carboxylate group monodentately coordinates to a Zn(II) ion and the ethylic carboxylate group chelates another Zn(II) ion (Scheme 1 a). Two hpht2− link two Zn(II) ions with interatomic distance of 6.795Å to form the dimeric basic building unit, [Zn2(hpht)2(phen)2(H2O)2] (Fig. 1 ), of the whole structure, and in the unit two phen are parallel as well as two phenyl planes of hpht2−. Such units are linked together to form the 1D double-chains by the hydrogen bonding of the coordinated water and one of ethyl carboxyl oxygen atoms (O5–H8⋯O1). Another type of hydrogen bonding formed by coordinated water and uncoordinated oxygen atom of carboxylate (O5–H9⋯O4) is also observed in the chain (Fig. 2 ). There are three kinds of macrocyclic rings in the double-chain: the sixteen-member ring (A), eight-member ring (B), with Zn⋯Zn distance of 6.795Å, and six-member ring (C). The double-chains are further stacked by π–π interaction of phen to form the final layer structure, and the phenyl planes of hpht2− ligand from two layers are meshed (Fig. 3 ). 3.3 Crystal structures of complex 2 The selected bond lengths and angles of complex 2 are listed in Table 3 . The asymmetric unit of 2 consists a Zn(II) ion, a 2,2′-bpy and a hpht2− anion. The Zn(II) ion is five-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from a 2,2′-bpy and three oxygen atoms from two hpht2− in a in highly distorted square pyramid coordination geometry. The Zn–O(N) bond distances are in the range 1.953–2.416Å, with an average value of 2.104Å, which are slightly small than those in 1. The hpht2− ligand adopts the same coordination mode (Scheme 1a) as in complex 1, and in the same way two hpht2− link two Zn(II) ions with interatomic distance of 6.092Å to form the dimeric basic building unit, [Zn2(hpht)2(2,2′-bpy)2] (Fig. 4 ), of the whole structure. Two kinds of weak interaction are observed between such units: the π–π interaction of 2,2′-bpy ligand and the π–π interaction phenyl of hpht2− ligand with 2,2′-bpy. These interactions make the units stack along bc direction to form the layer structure, as shown in Fig. 5 . The free lattice water molecules are filled between layers. 3.4 Crystal structure of complex 3 The selected bond lengths and angles of complex 3 are listed in Table 4 . Complex 3 is a 2D network with interesting topology. The asymmetric unit of 3 containing two kinds of metal environments is shown in Fig. 6 . Zn1 ion is six-coordinated by six oxygen atoms, five of which from three hpht2− ligands and one from coordinated water, in a distorted octahedron coordination geometry, with O5 and O1A in the axial positions. Zn2 is seven-coordinated by four oxygen atoms from two hpht2−, one oxygen atom from coordinated water and two nitrogen atoms from two 4,4′-bpy, in a slightly distorted pentagonal bipyramid coordination geometry with nitrogen atoms in the axial positions. The Zn–O(N) bond distances are in the range 2.167–2.489Å with an average value of 2.359Å. There are two crystallographically independent hpht2− in 3, and they adopt two kinds of coordination modes as shown in Scheme 1b and c. Hpht2− ligand of the first type adopt the chelating mode (Scheme 1b) to coordinate to Zn(II) ions that are all crystallographically equivalent to Zn1 ion of Fig. 6, forming a set of binuclear sixteen-member rings. Hpht2− ligand of the other type coordinate to three Zn(II) ions, two of which are crystallographically equivalent to Zn2 and one equivalent to Zn1 (Scheme 1c). Such hpht2− ligand binds all the Zn2 atoms to form the dimeric units. The 4,4′-bpy ligand links these units to form the ladder-like double chains along b-axis and complete the coordination sphere of Zn2 ions. Then the rings connect the chains together to form the final 2D network (Fig. 7 ) through sharing the O5 oxygen atoms of the chains, and thus complete the coordination sphere of Zn1 ions. The free lattice water molecules are hold in the network. 3.5 Thermography analyses of complexes 1–3 Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of complex 1 indicates that 1 loses 3.89% of total molecular weight from 107 to 167°C, corresponding to the loss of the coordinated water molecules (Calc. 3.92%). Then the complex starts decomposition at 304°C. 2 loses 9.87% of total molecular weight from 111 to 158°C, corresponding to the loss of the water molecules (Calc. 10.13%). Then the complex is stable up to 264°C and decomposes by the oxidation of the organic component. 3 loses 7.81% of total molecular weight in the range of 182–286°C, corresponding to the loss of the total water molecules (Calc. 7.75%), then the complex decomposes rapidly at higher temperature. 4 Conclusions In the present work, three complexes have been synthesized by solvothermal method from Zn(NO3)2, homophthalic acid and different diimine auxiliary ligand. As known, solvothermal reaction is complicated, and it is quite difficult to know what controls the formation of the complexes. In our research, we try to investigate the influence of the pH of the reaction system. The results illustrate that the pH plays a crucial role in synthesizing the complexes. As shown in Scheme 1, the coordination modes of hpht2− ligand in the synthetical complexes are different. Burrows and co-workers have reported two complexes: [Zn(tmtsc)(μ-hpht)]2 and [Zn(tu)2(μ-hpht)]2 (tmtsc=1,1,4-trimethylthiosemicarbazide; tu=thiourea) [13,14]. The two complexes all consist of discrete dimers, while tmtsc and tu act as terminal ligands in the structures. Complexes 1 and 2 also consist of discrete dimers, and phen and 2,2′-bpy also act as terminal ligands. This may strongly suggest the tendency of dimeric structure of zinc homophthalate complex with the presence of auxiliary terminal ligand. However, it should be noted that the coordination modes reported by Burrows are different from each other, and also different from that of 1 and 2. Although complexes 1 and 2 have similar auxiliary ligands and adopt the same hpht2− coordination modes, their packing fashions are different. This may be attributed to the different rigidity of phen and 2,2′-bpy. When employing bridging ligand 4,4′-bpy, we obtained 2D network structure of 3, and hpht2− ligand exhibits more rich coordination modes, as shown in Scheme 1b and c. 5 Supplementary material For the three complexes, full list of atomic coordinates, isotropic thermal parameters, bond lengths and angles are available from the authors on request.
