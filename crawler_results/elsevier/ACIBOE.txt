Tel./fax: +86 431 5168608. Three metal-organic framework compounds [HZn3(OH)(BTC)2(2H2O) (DMF)]·H2O (MOF-CJ3), [Co6(BTC)2(HCOO)6(DMF)6] (MOF-CJ4), and [Co18(HCOO)36]·3H2O (MOF-CJ5) have been solvothermally synthesized in mixed solvents of DMF and HAc, respectively. These MOFs are characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, X-ray powder diffraction, ICP, TG analyses, IR, and photoluminescence spectroscopy analyses. MOF-CJ3 crystallizes in tetragonal, space group I4cm (No. 108) with a =20.588(3) Å, b =20.588(3) Å, c =17.832(4) Å. Its framework can be described as a 3D decorated (3,6)-connected net based on the assembly of trigonal prismatic SBUs and triangular links. MOF-CJ4 crystallizes in hexagonal, space group P-3 (No. 147) with a =13.975(2) Å, b =13.975(2) Å, c =8.1650(16) Å. The 2D network of MOF-CJ4 is constructed from [Co6(R(CO2)3)2(HCO2)6(DMF)6] (R=C9H3–) clusters and 1,3,5-benzene-tricarboxylates linkers. MOF-CJ5 crystallizes in triclinic, space group P 1 ¯ (No. 2) with a =15.205(3) Å, b =18.005(4) Å, c =21.500(4) Å, α =71.21(3)°, β =84.47(3)°, γ =67.15(3)°. MOF-CJ5 has a diamond framework with Co-centered CoCo4 tetrahedra as nodes. It is noteworthy that the formic ligands in MOF-CJ4 and MOF-CJ5 are generated by the decomposition of DMF under acid conditions and incorporated into these two compounds. Keywords Solvothermal synthesis Structure Metal-organic framework Photoluminescent Magnetic 1 Introduction The design and synthesis of porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is currently an active research area due to their intriguing structural architectures as well as potential applications in catalysis, gas adsorption and separation [1,2]. The common strategy for the construction of porous metal-organic networks is based primarily on the proper selection of inorganic building blocks as nodes and long rigid organic ligands as linkers [3]. Indeed, the structural and property studies of the large majority of reported coordination polymer have been finely tuned by closely controlling the molecular properties of the organic ligands such as size, shape, functionality, flexibility and symmetry [4]. However, to obtain tailor-made solids with the required structures and properties is still a challenge to chemists. More recently, Yaghi, O’Keeffe, and their co-workers developed a reticular synthetic approach which can be described as the process of assembling judiciously designed rigid molecular building blocks into predetermined ordered structures which are held together by strong bonding [5]. It has been widely used for understanding and predicting topologies of structures, and various attractive networks with novel topologies and specific functionality have been achieved by assembling of well-defined and rigid molecular building blocks, such as tetrahedral, square, triangular, octahedral, pentagonal bipyramidal, and trigonal prismatic building blocks [6,7]. However, the design of new molecular building blocks to construct porous metal-organic frameworks is still one of the most challenging issues in current synthetic chemistry. Utilizing mono-functionalized group frequently result in the formation of low dimensional coordination polymer because of their terminal-group effect [8,9]. On the other hand, by using terminal ligands as solvents in the synthesis, it is also possible to produce extended structures in which these ligands point toward the center of the voids, making them susceptible to dissociation and evacuation from the pores, thereby producing periodically arranged OM sites. Which allow the study of metal site reactivity [10–12]. Furthermore, significant interest has also arisen in organic and coordination chemistry for the design and synthesis of novel coordination polymers with ligands generated in situ [13]. In this work, we have chosen DMF and HAc as mixed solvents in the synthesis, three metal-organic framework compounds [HZn3(OH)(BTC)2(2H2O)(DMF)]·H2O (MOF-CJ3), [Co6(BTC)2(HCOO)6(DMF)6] (MOF-CJ4), and [Co18(HCOO)36]·3H2O (MOF-CJ5), have been prepared from the solvothermal reaction of transition metal nitrate and ligands. To our knowledge, this method represents the first synthetic method using DMF and HAc as mixed solvents in the synthesis of metal-organic coordination polymer. In addition, the formic ligands are generated by the decomposition of DMF under acid conditions and incorporated into the frameworks of MOF-CJ4 and MOF-CJ5. Their synthetic conditions and structural characterizations have been discussed in detail. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Synthesis and characterization MOF-CJ3 was synthesized from the solvothermal reaction of Zn(NO3)2 ·6H2O and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) in the mixed solvents of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (7.5mL) and glacial acetic acid (HAc) (2.5mL). Typically, 1,3,5-H3BTC (0.5mmol, 0.105g) and Zn(NO3)2 ·6H2O (0.5mmol, 0.145g) were dissolved into mixed solvents (DMF/HAc) (v/v=3:1). The resulting mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 170°C for 4 days under static condition. The final product consisting of large colorless rod-shaped single crystals was washed thoroughly with DMF and dried at room temperature. Yield: 66%. Anal.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data were collected on a Siemens D5005 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418Å). The elemental analysis was conducted on a Perkin–Elmer 2400 elemental analyzer. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analyses were carried out on a Perkin–Elmer Optima 3300Dv spectrometer. The infrared (IR) spectrum was recorded (400–4000cm−1 region) on a Bruker-IFS 66V/S spectrum using KBr pellets. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin–Elmer TGA 7 thermogravimetric analyzer in the air with a heating rate of 10°C/min. Fluorescence spectra were obtained with a LS55 fluorescence/phosphorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature. Magnetic susceptibility data were collected based on a 0.018g sample over the temperature range 4–300K at a magnetic field of 5kG on a Quantum Design MPMS-7 SQUID magnetometer. 2.2 Determination of crystal structure Suitable single crystals of MOF-CJ3 to MOF-CJ5 were selected for single-crystal XRD analysis. Their intensity data were collected at 293K on a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID IP diffractometer [λ (Mo Kα)=0.71073Å]. Cell refinement and data reduction were accomplished by the RAPID AUTO program. Their structures were solved by direct methods and refined on F 2 by full-matrix least-squares using SHELXTL97 software package [14]. All non-hydrogen atoms were easily found from the difference Fourier map, and the hydrogen atoms on the ligands were placed geometrically and refined by riding on their parent atoms. No hydrogen atom was added to the water molecules. In MOF-CJ3, the H atoms associated with μ3-OH group and DMF molecules were not located. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Details of their crystal data, data collections, and structure refinements are summarized in Table 1 . CCDC-279674, 258461, 258462 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge at http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/conts/retrieving.html. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis Pure single crystals of MOF-CJ3, MOF-CJ4 and MOF-CJ5 can be prepared in mixed solvents of DMF/HAc. The HAc solvent is important for the synthesis of these compounds, although it did not appear in their final frameworks. As we known, when employing DMF as solvent, dimethylamine (DMA) molecule is a common product found in solvothermal reaction and often serves as couterions to balance charge of system [15]. It is difficult to evacuate or exchange the DMA guests without the collapse of the host framework because of the strong hydrogen bonding interaction between the protonated DMA molecules and the host framework [1a]. After we introducing HAc solvents into the solvothermal reaction system, there is no DMA molecules found in the structure of MOF-CJ3 to MOF-CJ5 but the formic ligands incorporated into the frameworks of MOF-CJ4 and MOF-CJ5, although the non-volatile smell of the final reactant proves that the dimethylamine is protonated under acidic conditions(acetic acid). Therefore, HAc solvents play an important role in inhibiting the DMA molecules incorporated into these compounds. The volume ratio of DMF/HAc is also critical for the synthesis of products. When it is equal to 3:1, suitable crystal could be obtained for single-crystal analysis; while further increasing or decreasing the volume ratio of DMF/HAc, the crystal’s quality became poor or even no crystal is formed. Especially for the synthesis of MOF-CJ3, keeping other reaction conditions unchanged, when there is no HAc solvents, a 3D porous MOF [Zn(BTC)]·NH2(CH3)2 ·DMF containing HDMA+ as counter cations with the decorated rutile framework topology is obtained [16]. 3.2 Characterization of MOF-CJ3 3.2.1 XRPD, IR spectrum and TG analysis The experimental and simulated X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns of MOF-CJ3 are shown in Fig. 1 . They are in good agreement with each other, which proves the phase purity of the as-synthesized product. The IR spectrum of MOF-CJ3 shows the characteristic bands of the carboxylate group at 1631–1571cm−1 for the asymmetric vibration and at 1441–1371cm−1 for the symmetric vibration. The absence of the characteristic bands at around 1700cm−1 attributed to the protonated carboxylic groups indicates the complete deprotonation of the 1,3,5-BTC ligand [17]. Thermogravimetric analysis of MOF-CJ3 (TGA) (Fig. 2 ) showed a total weight loss of ca. 65.82% in the temperature range of 60–510°C, corresponding to the loss of the H2O molecules, coordinated DMF molecules and the decomposition of 1,3,5-BTC ligands (calcd.: 67.68%). XRPD analysis shows that MOF-CJ3 is finally transforms to ZnO. 3.2.2 Structure description Single-crystal structural analysis revealed that the polymer framework of MOF-CJ3 is constructed from trimeric [Zn3(OH)(R(CO2)3)2(DMF)(2H2O)] (R=C9H3–) clusters bridged by 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylates units. Each [Zn3(OH)(R(CO2)3)2(DMF)(2H2O)] cluster is composed of a ZnO6 octahedron and two ZnO5 trigonal bipyramidal sharing a common μ3-OH group. Using hydroxyl metal clusters and multi-carboxylic ligands as building blocks to construct metal-organic framework has also been observed in other Zn compound [18]. Zn(1) is octahedrally bonded to four carboxylate oxygen atoms of four bridging dimonodentate carboxylates, one oxygen atom of μ3-OH group and one oxygen atom of DMF molecule. The trigonal bipyramidal around Zn(2) and Zn(2A) (symmetry operation: 1.5− y, 1.5− x, z) is made up of two carboxylate oxygen atoms of two bridging dimonodentate carboxylates, one carboxylate oxygen atoms of one monodentate carboxylates, one μ3-OH group and one water molecules. The connection of zinc carboxylate clusters and BTC linkers results in an infinite 3D (3,6)-connected net (Fig. 3 ). The free water molecules are protonated to balance the charge of system. The structure of MOF-CJ3 has channels of 11.6Å×11.6Å dimension with void space and channels of 6.4Å×6.4Å dimensions occupying by coordinated water molecules, DMF molecules, and free water molecules running along the [001] direction. Interestingly, the coordinated water molecules and DMF molecules both point toward the center of the smaller voids, which make them susceptible to evacuate from the pores, thereby producing periodically arranged OM sites. The van der Waals free space of the channels per unit cell is approximately 4114.17Å3, corresponding to 54.43% of the volume of the unit cell [19]. To determine the net topology of MOF-CJ3, it is instructive to connect six carboxylate carbon of six BTC ligands in the trimeric [Zn3(OH)(R(CO2)3)2(DMF)(2H2O)] cluster as shown in Fig. 4 a and b. So each trinuclear unit can be considered as a distorted trigonal prismatic secondary building unit (SBU) and BTC linkers are represented by triangular units. Therefore, the framework of MOF-CJ3 can be described as a 3D decorated (3,6)-connected net, in which each trigonal prismatic SBU connects to six triangular BTC linkers and each BTC linker connects to three SBUs (Fig. 4c). MOF-CJ3 has the same framework topology as [Zn3O(BTC)2]·(HTEA)2 (MOF-38) reported by Yaghi and their co-workers [20]. However, there also exist some differences between them. In MOF-38 the trimeric cluster is composed of three Zn(II) centers sharing a common μ3-O while in MOF-CJ3 it consists of three Zn(II) centers sharing a common μ3-OH group. In addition that reproducing the synthesis of MOF-38 was unsuccessful while the MOF-CJ3 could be easily repeated from the mixed solvents of DMF/HAc and its empty voids provide convenience for further investigation. 3.2.3 Fluorescent properties The solid-state excitation-emission spectrum of the free 1,3,5-BTC ligand shows the strongest emission peak at 370nm with the excitation peak at 334nm at room temperature. The emission band of the free ligand is attributed to the π∗ →n transitions. Compared to the free ligands, the strongest excitation peak for MOF-CJ3 is at 326nm, with higher energy than that for the BTC ligand. The emission spectrum of MOF-CJ3 shows one strong peak at 409nm (Fig. 5 ), which can be assigned to the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) band [18,21]. 3.3 Characterization of MOF-CJ4 3.3.1 XRPD, IR spectrum and TG analysis The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns of the as-synthesized MOF-CJ4 is shown in Fig. 6 , which are in agreement with the simulated one based on the single-crystal structure analysis, suggesting that the as-synthesized sample is pure phase. In comparison with that of MOF-CJ3, the IR spectrum of MOF-CJ4 is more complicated. The medium bands at 2937 and 2881cm−1 can be assigned to the vibrations of the C–H absorption vibration for formic ligands. The bands at 1662 (sh: shoulder), 1627 (vs: very strong), 1571 (sh) cm−1 are attributed to the asymmetric vibration of carboxylate groups and at 1438 (sh), 1384 (vs) and 1337 (sh) cm−1 are attributed to the symmetric vibration of carboxylate groups. The absence of the characteristic bands from 1680–1800cm−1 attributed to the protonated carboxylic groups indicates the complete deprotonation of the 1,3,5-BTC ligands and formic ligands [17]. The TG curve (Fig. 7 ) of MOF-CJ4 shows a sharp weight loss of 18.07wt.% occurring at 170–240°C corresponding to the decomposition of coordinated HCOO− ligands (calcd.: 18.29%). The second weight loss is 46.68% in the temperature range of 280–385°C, corresponding to the decomposition of coordinated DMF molecules and 1,3,5-BTC ligands (calcd.: 48.0%). The XRPD studies show that MOF-CJ4 finally transforms to Co2O3. 3.3.2 Structure description Single-crystal structural analysis reveals that MOF-CJ4 exhibits a 2D polymeric coordination network consists of hexameric [Co6(R(CO2)3)2(HCO2)6(DMF)6] (R=C9H3–) clusters and 1,3,5-BTC links. Each [Co6(R(CO2)3)2(HCO2)6(DMF)6] cluster is composed of six corner-sharing CoO6 octahedron, six BTC ligands, six formic ligands, and coordinated DMF molecules (the formic acids are generated by the decomposition of DMF under acid conditions). The Co(II) atom is coordinated to two carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2 and O5) of two different BTC ligands, three carboxylate oxygen atoms (O3, O3A (x − y +1, x +1,−z), and O4) of three separate HCOO ligands, and one oxygen atom (O1) of DMF molecule. The Co(II) center adopts a slightly distorted octahedral geometry with cis angles ranging from 84.34 (9)° to 95.81 (8)°. Such hexanuclear clusters is rarely found in polymeric framework [22]. The connection of hexameric [Co6(R(CO2)3)2(HCO2)6(DMF)6] clusters and BTC linkers results in a 2D network parallel the ab plane (Fig. 8 ). Interestingly, the six carboxylate carbon atoms in the hexa-meric cobalt cluster serve as points-of-extension that define the vertexes of a hexangular building unit (Fig. 9 a), and the 1,3,5-BTC also represents the triangular building unit (Fig. 9b). Therefore, the structure of MOF-CJ4 can be simplified into a 2D network (Fig. 9c and d). Each hexangular SBU connects to six BTC linkers and each BTC linker connects to three hexangular SBUs. 3.3.3 Magnetic properties The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility was measured from 4K to 300K at 5000Oe for MOF-CJ4. The magnetic data of MOF-CJ4 are displayed in Fig. 10 , plotted as the thermal variation of χ m T and 1/χ m (per Co units). The χ m T vs. T plot has a value of 3.12emuKmol−1 at 300K, and decreases continuously on cooling to a value of 2.06emuKmol−1 at 4K. The inverse susceptibility (1/χ m) plot as a function of temperature (T) is linear, closely following the Curie–Weiss law with C =3.295emuKmol−1. The effective magnetic moment per metal atom at 300K, 5.0μB, which are consistent with the observations that the effective magnetic moments for high-spin octahedral Co(II) complexes around room temperature are between 4.7 and 5.2μB [23]. The Weiss temperature, θ =−13.21K, indicates that predominantly antiferromagnetic interactions exist between metallic Co(II) centers. 3.4 Characterization of MOF-CJ5 The previously reported 3D porous metal-organic framework [Mn(HCO2)2]·1/3(C4H8O2) exhibits a diamond net topology possessing 1-D zigzag channels of 5Å diameter [24]. This compound is of much interests due to its framework topology as well as permanent porosity, high thermal stability, and highly selective gas sorption properties. Soon, the other isomorphous series of MII formate (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Mg) framework structures have been synthesized and they also shows high stability, flexibility for the inclusion of many kinds of guests, and interesting magnetic properties [25]. However, these compounds were all prepared from the reaction of MII formate dehydrate and formic acid under solvothermal conditions or from the reaction of divalent metal chlorides with formic acid neutralized by bulky amine. Use of smaller amines results in the perovskite compounds, [AmineH+][M(HCOO)3] (M=Co, Mn), with a NaCl-like anionic framework incorporating the cationic ammonium within the cubic cavities. [26]. Here we present a different synthetic method without adding formic acid and bulky amine to prepare such microporous MOF materials. The solvothermal reaction of nitrate colbalt hexahydrate with 1,2-benzenedicaboxylic acid in the mixed solvents DMF/HAc yields a three-dimensional porous coordination polymer [Co18(HCOO)36]·3H2O (MOF-CJ5) possessing the diamond topology. The formic acid is generated by the decomposition of DMF under acid conditions. 3.4.1 Structure description Single-crystal structural analysis reveals that MOF-CJ5 is a 3D neutral microporous framework composed of Co(II) ions, formic ligands, and guest water molecules. Each Co(II) ions is coordinated by six formic ligands in a distorted octahedral geometry while each formic ligand is bound to three Co(II) ions in a syn–syn–anti mode [27]. This open-framework has 1D zigzag channels running along the [010] direction with dimension of 4.5×5Å (Fig. 11 ). The water molecules reside in the channels. By connecting all the Co(II) ions, the structure of MOF-CJ5 can be simplified as a 3D network has the same diamond framework as [Co3(HCOO)6]·CH3OH·H2O with Co-centered CoCo4 tetrahedra as nodes. Each tetrahedron has one central Co ion, four apical Co ions, and six edged HCOO− groups which link the metal ions in syn–syn–anti mode by sharing their metal apices to form the diamond framework (Fig. 12 ). Since the environments of each Co(II) ions are different in MOF-CJ5, not all vertices (Co atoms) of each distorted tetrahedra SBU are symmetrically equivalent. Consequently MOF-CJ5 crystallized in a lower symmetry space group (P-1) compared with [Co3(HCOO)6]·CH3OH·H2O (P21/c). 4 Conclusions Three metal-organic framework compounds (MOF-CJ3–MOF-CJ5) have been successfully synthesized from the solvothermal reaction of metal nitrates and ligands in the mixed solvents of DMF/HAc. The 3D structure of MOF-CJ3 with a decorated (3,6)-connected net topology is constructed from trigonal prismatic SBUs and triangular linker; the 2D polymeric framework of MOF-CJ4 is based on hexangular SBUs and triangular linker; the structure of MOF-CJ5 has a diamond framework topology with CoCo4 tetrahedra as nodes. This method represents a potential approach for the design of new porous metal-organic framework constructed from novel building blocks. It is also noteworthy that, during the synthesis of MOF-CJ4 and MOF-CJ5, the HCOO− is generated by the decomposition of DMF under acid conditions and incorporated into their final frameworks, even though we did not add the formic acid to reaction mixture.
