Two new one-dimensional copper(II) polymers with formulae of [Cu2(H2O)2(dmapox)(ipa)2] n (1) and [Cu2(H2O)2(dmapox)(tpa)2] n (2), where dmapox, ipa and tpa stand for the dianion of N,N′-bis[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]oxamide, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid respectively, have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, conductivity measurement, IR and electronic spectral studies. The crystal structures of the two complexes have been determined by X-ray single-crystal diffraction. The structures of 1 and 2 consist of one-dimensional copper(II) coordination polymeric chain constructed both by the bis-tridentate trans-dmapox and bis-monodentate phenyldicarboxylate bridging ligands. In the two complexes, the environment around the copper(II) atoms can be described as distorted square–pyramid and the Cu···Cu separations through μ-trans-dmapox and phenyldicarboxylato bridging ligands are 5.245(5) Å and 8.212(3) Å for 1, 5.237(8) Å and 11.171(1) Å for 2, respectively. The binding properties of the two copper(II) polymers with herring sperm DNA (HS-DNA) have been investigated by using absorption and emission spectral and electrochemical techniques and viscometry. The results show that the two copper(II) complexes interact with the HS-DNA in the mode of intercalation with the intrinsic binding constants of 1.22(±0.2)×104 M−1 and 1.45(±0.3)×104 M−1 for 1 and 2, respectively. Keywords Crystal structure Copper(II) polymer Phenyldicarboxylate μ-Trans-oxamidato-bridge DNA interaction 1 Introduction The rational design of polymeric metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their potential applications in catalysis, separation and gas storage have received increasing attention over the past decades [1,2]. An effective method to construct MOFs is the self-assembly of the inorganic second building units (SBUs) and the organic linker molecules [3]. N,N′-bis[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] oxamide (H2dmapox), of which the trans conformation with bis-tridentate character and vacant coordinated sites is more stable than the cis one in the lack of steric hindrance between the four methyl substituents on the amine nitrogen atom, allows the formation of trans-oxamidato-bridged binuclear SBUs [4]. Apart from the inorganic SBUs, the organic linker molecules with versatile coordination modes are also indispensable to construct the polymeric MOFs. Phenyldicarboxylates, with extraordinary varieties in the binding of complexes, are widely employed in the preparation of polymeric MOFs [5]. They can act as the coligand via the deprotonated carboxylate groups to build coordination networks [6] as well as interlink the 1-D or 2-D molecules into frameworks via the hydrogen bonds [7,8]. A series of new metal-polymers with interesting structures based on the bridging phenyldicarboxylate ligands along with their magnetic properties have been reported [9]. However, the studies on the DNA binding properties involving the phenyldicarboxylates appear to be rare [10]. It is well-known that DNA is a useful target for many anticancer drugs and the effectiveness mainly depends on the mode and affinity of the binding between the drugs and DNA [11]. It is reported that the metal complexes can interact non-covalently with nucleic acids in the mode of intercalation, groove binding or external electrostatic binding [12–14]. In particular, the intercalation of the metal complex between parallel base-pairs of DNA is frequently one of the possible binding modes between DNA molecules and the active anticancer drugs [15]. A terephthalate-bridged tetranuclear copper(II) metallointercalator [Cu4(L)(tpa)(dmf))2] [H3L=1,3-bis(salicylideneamino) propan-2-ol, tpa=terephthalate] has been reported by Dhara, which displays efficient cleavage of supercoiled pUC19 DNA in the presence of H2O2 [10]. On the other hand, significant developments have occurred in recent years in the chemistry of polymer–metal complexes. Particularly, the DNA binding properties of these metal-polymers have attracted special attentions [16,17]. However, examples of such metal polymer are still very limited. This prompted us to synthesize and study new metal polymeric complexes in order to gain some insight into the interaction with DNA of this kind of complexes. In view of the above mentioned structural characteristics of dmapox and phenyldicarboxylate ligands, we thought it worthwhile to explore the possibility of the self-assembly of dmapox and phenyldicarboxylate in building polymeric frameworks together with their applications in DNA interactions. In this paper, we report here the synthesis, crystal structure and DNA binding properties of two one-dimensional copper(II) coordination polymers [Cu2(H2O)2(dmapox)(ipa)2] n (1) and [Cu2(H2O)2(dmapox)(tpa)2] n (2) (Scheme 1 ), which are bridged both by μ-trans-oxamidates and phenyldicarboxylate ligands. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and chemicals N,N′-bis[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]oxamide (H2 dmapox) was prepared according to literature method [18]. Doubly distilled water was used to prepare buffers. Ethidium bromide (EB) and herring sperm DNA (HS-DNA) were purchased from Sigma Corp. and used as received. The carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen microanalyses were performed on a Perkin–Elmer 240 elemental analyzer. Molar conductance was measured with a Shanghai DDS-11A conduct meter. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet-470 spectrophotometer in the spectral range 4000–400cm−1 as KBr pellets. The electronic spectra were measured on a Cary 300 spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectra were measured with Fp-750w Fluorometer. Cyclic voltammetric experiments were carried out using a CHI 832 electrochemical analyzer in connection with a glassy carbon working electrode (GCE), saturated calomel reference (SCE) and a platinum wire auxiliary electrode. The GCE surface was freshly polished to a mirror prior to each experiment with 0.05mm a-Al2O3 paste and then cleaned in water. 2.2 Synthesis of [Cu2(H2O)2(dmapox)(ipa)2]n (1) A methanol solution (5ml) of copper(II) chloride dihydrate (0.170g, 0.1mmol) was added slowly into a methanol solution (5ml) containing H2dmapox (0.0129g, 0.05mmol) and piperidine (0.0085g, 0.1mmol). The mixture was stirred quickly for 30min, then an acetonitrile solution (5ml) of isophthalic acid (0.0116g, 0.1mmol) and piperidine (0.0170g, 0.2mmol) was added dropwise into the mixture. The reaction solution was heated at 333K with stirring for 6h. The resulting blue solution was filtered and the filtrate was kept at room temperature. Green crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained from the filtrate by slow evaporation for one week. Yield: 65%. Anal. Calcd. for CuC10H16N2O4: C, 41.16; H, 5.53; N, 9.60. Found: C, 41.12; H 5.62; N, 9.58%. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 1324 [v s(COO)]; 1560 [v as(COO)]; 1618 [v(NCO)]. UV–visible (in DMF): λ max (nm) [ε max (M−1 cm−1)]: 630 (204), 277 (16,020), 235 (20,000). 2.3 Synthesis of [Cu2(H2O)2(dmapox)(tpa)2]n (2) An aqueous solution (5ml) of copper(II) perchloride hexahydrate (0.0371g, 0.1mmol) was added slowly into an aqueous solution (5ml) containing H2dmapox (0.0129g, 0.05mmol) and piperidine (0.0085g, 0.1mmol). The mixture was stirred quickly for 30min, then an aqueous solution (5ml) of terephthalic acid (0.0116g, 0.1mmol) and piperidine (0.0170g, 0.2mmol) was added dropwise into the mixture. The reaction solution was heated at 333K with stirring for 6h. The resulting blue precipitates were collected, washed with water and dried in the desiccator. Yield: 57%. Anal. Calcd. for CuC10H16N2O4: C, 41.16; H, 5.53; N, 9.60. Found: C, 41.11; H 5.63; N, 9.61%. Green crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by the slow diffusion of two individual aqueous solutions in H-tube (one contained H2dmapox, piperidine and perchloride hexahydrate, the other contained terephthalic acid neutralized by piperidine). IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 1324 [v s(COO)]; 1576 [v as(COO)]; 1618 [v(NCO)]. UV-visible (in DMF): λ max (nm) [ε max (M−1 cm−1)]: 645 (221), 275 (16,320), 238 (19,850). 2.4 X-ray crystallography The X-ray diffraction experiments for the two complexes were made on a Bruker APEX area-detector diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo K α radiation (λ =0.71073Å) at the temperature of 298K. The crystal structures were solved by the directed method followed by Fourier syntheses. Structure refinements were performed by full matrix least-squares procedures using SHELXL-97 on F 2 [19]. Crystal data and structural refinement parameters for the two complexes are summarized in Table 1 and selected bond distances and bond angels are listed in Tables 2 and 3 . 2.5 DNA binding experiments All the experiments involving herring sperm DNA (HS-DNA) were performed in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-HCl (Tris–HCl) buffer solution (pH 7.94). Tris–HCl buffer was prepared using deionized and sonicated triple distilled water. Solutions of HS-DNA in Tris–HCl gave a ratio of UV absorbance at 260 and 280nm, A 260/A 280, of 1.8–1.9, indicating that the DNA was sufficiently free from protein [20]. The concentration of HS-DNA was determined by UV absorbance at 260nm. The extinction coefficient, ε260, was taken as 6600M−1 cm−1 [21]. Stock solution of HS-DNA was stored at 277K and used after no more than 4 days. Concentrated stock solution of the two copper(II) complexes were prepared by dissolving the complexes in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted suitably with Tris–HCl buffer to required concentrations for all the experiments. Absorption spectral titration experiments were performed by keeping the concentration of the copper(II) complexes constant while varying the HS-DNA concentration. Equal solution of HS-DNA was added to the copper(II) complex solution and reference solution to eliminate the absorbance of DNA itself. In the ethidium bromide (EB) fluorescence displacement experiment, 5μl of the EB Tris–HCl solution (1mM) was added to 1ml of HS-DNA solution (at saturated binding levels [22]), stored in the dark for 2h. Then the solution of the copper(II) complex was titrated into the DNA/EB mixture and then diluted in Tris–HCl buffer to 5ml, producing the solutions with the varied mole ratio of the copper(II) complex to HS-DNA. Before measurements, the mixture was shaken up and incubated at room temperature for 30min. The fluorescence spectra of EB bound to HS-DNA were obtained at an emission wavelength of 584nm in the Fluorometer. Cyclic voltammetric experiments on the two copper(II) complexes were carried out by maintaining constant concentration of the complexes while varying the HS-DNA concentration using the solvent of Tris–HCl buffer. Viscosity measurements were performed using an Ubbelodhe viscometer immersed in a thermostatic water bath maintained at 16(±0.l)°C. HS-DNA samples approximately 200 base pairs in length were prepared by sonication in order to minimize complexities arising from DNA flexibility [23]. Flow times were measured with a digital stopwatch, and each sample was measured three times, and an average flow time was calculated. Relative viscosities for HS-DNA in the presence and absence of the complex were calculated from the relation ŋ =(t − t 0)/t 0, where t is the observed flow time of DNA-containing solution and t 0 is that of Tris–HCl buffer alone. Data were presented as (ŋ/ŋ 0)1/3 versus [complex]/[DNA] [24], where ŋ is the viscosity of DNA in the presence of the copper(II) complex and ŋ 0 is that of DNA alone. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Solubility and molar conductivity of the complexes Both of the two copper(II) complexes are insoluble in water and methanol, moderately soluble in dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and practically insoluble in carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and benzene. In the solid state the two complexes are fairly stable in air so as to allow physical measurements. The molar conductance values of the two copper(II) complexes (14 and 20Ω−1 cm−2 mol−1 in 1×10−3 M DMF solutions for 1 and 2, respectively) fall in the expected range for non-electrolytes [25], suggesting that all of the phenyldicarboxylate ligands have been involved in the coordination. 3.2 Spectral and electrochemical characterization The IR spectra of the two copper(II) complexes exhibit very similar features. The most salient feature in the IR spectra of both the two copper(II) complexes is the existence of the strong band around 1618cm−1, attributed to the v(NCO) stretching band of the bridging oxamidate ligand [26]. Furthermore, the two complexes exhibit characteristic vibration bands of v as(COO) and v s(COO). The Δ value, which represents the separation of v as(COO) and v s(COO), reflects the coordination modes of the carboxyl groups [27]. Complex 1 shows the bands v as(COO) (1560cm−1) and v s(COO) (1324cm−1) with Δ value of 236cm−1, which is in accordance with monodentate coordination mode of the carboxyl groups in ipa ligand [8]. And the Δ value of 264cm−1 in complex 2 also indicates the monodentate ligation of the carboxyl groups in tpa ligand [28]. The electronic spectra of the two copper(II) complexes were recorded in the UV–visible region using DMF as solvent. Both of the two copper(II) complexes show three absorption bands with varied intensities. The intense bands at 235nm and 238nm are assigned to intra-ligand (π–π∗) transition associated to ipa and tpa for 1 and 2, respectively. While the less intense bands at 277nm and 275nm correspond to the charge transfer transition from phenyldicarboxylate ligands to the metals for 1 and 2, respectively. Besides, broad bands observed at the lower frequency of 630nm and 645nm respective for 1 and 2 in the spectra match well with the reported d–d transition of five-coordinated copper(II) in the square-pyramidal geometry [29]. The spectroscopic data of the two copper(II) complexes are in agreement with the determination of the crystal structures (vide infra). The cyclic voltammograms of the two copper(II) complexes were recorded in the Tris–HCl buffer solution (pH 7.94) at room temperature. The profiles of the obtained voltammograms of the two copper(II) complexes are almost similar. With the scan rate of 0.5Vs−1, both of the two copper(II) complexes display a couple of well-defined redox waves corresponding to the Cu(II)/Cu(I) couple. The cathodic peak potential (E pc) and the anodic peak potential (E pa) are −161mV and −32mV for 1, and −187mV and −46mV for 2, respectively. The separations of the anodic and cathodic peak potential (ΔE p) for 1 and 2 are 129mV and 141mV, respectively. And the ratios of anodic to cathodic peak currents, i pa/i pc for 1 and 2 are 1.65 and 2.23, respectively, indicating the quasi-reversible redox process of the two copper(II) complexes at the GCE. The values of the formal potential E 1/2, taken as the average of E pc and E pa are 97mV for 1 and 116mV for 2. Additionally, the dependence of the peak current (i pc and i pa) of the two copper(II) complexes on the scan rate was also studied. When the scan rate was in the range from 0.1 to 1.0Vs−1, the peak currents were directly proportional to the square root of the scan rates, indicating that the electrode processes of both the two copper(II) complexes at the GCE are diffusion controlled. 3.3 Crystal structures of the two copper(II) complexes The two catena copper(II) complexes 1 and 2 crystallize in the space groups of C2/c and P 1 ¯ respectively. The crystal structures of both complexes consist of a one-dimensional coordination polymer constructed by trans-dmapox and the phenyldicarboxylate bridging ligands of ipa and tpa, respectively. The perspective views of 1 and 2 with the atom-labeling scheme are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, there are imposed crystallographic inversion centers lying in the middle of the C–C bonds in the oxamide groups of both complexes [C6–C6i (symmetry code: i=−x, −y, −z) and C1–C1i (symmetry code: i=−x+1, −y+1, −z) for 1 and 2, respectively], and a twofold axis through C4 and C5 in the ipa ligand of the complex 1. The environment of the copper(II) atoms in the two complexes are the {N2O3} square-based pyramid geometry with two nitrogen atoms and one oxygen atom from dmapox ligand and one oxygen atom from ipa or tpa in the basal plane, and a water molecule at the apical position. The Cu–O bond distances between the copper(II) atoms and the coordinated water molecules [2.322(3) Å for 1 and 2.316(4) Å for 2] are longer than those in the basal plane (see Tables 2 and 3). The copper(II) atoms are displaced by 0.0631Å and 0.0685Å out of the basal planes for 1 and 2, respectively. The bond distances of Cu1–N1 [1.956(3) Å and 1.957 (5) for 1 and 2 respectively] and Cu1–N2 [2.069(3) Å and 2.076(5) Å for 1 and 2 respectively] are close to those observed in parent oxamidato-bridged copper(II) complexes [30–33]. In either of the two copper(II) complexes, the trans-dmapox behaves as a bis-tridentate ligand chelating as well as bridging copper(II) atoms to form the SBUs [Cu2(H2O)2(trans-dmapox)]2+ with a five- and a six-membered chelating rings for each copper(II) atom, the corresponding bite angles are 83.54(12)° and 95.86(12)° for 1 and 83.98(16)° and 95.85(18)° for 2. The five-membered rings are almost planar, while the six-membered rings are very similar to the half-chair conformation in the two complexes; the corresponding puckering parameters [34] are θ =47.7(4)°, φ =204.3(5)°, Q =0.551(4)Å for 1, and θ =48.0(5)°, φ =203.2(8)°, Q =0.537(6)Å for 2. In the oxamide fragment, the bond lengths of C–N [1.292(4)Å for C6–N1 in 1 and 1.308(6)Å for C1–N1 in 2] and C–C [1.513(5)Å for C6–C6i in 1 and 1.494(7)Å for C1–C1i for 2] are typically C=N and Csp 2–Csp 2 values, respectively. Considering the bond distances of C6–O3 [1.274(4) Å] in 1 and C1–O1 [1.279(6)Å] in 2, which are in accordance with those of (O=)C–O fragments in many examples [35,36], especially those of C–O− in the phenol ligand, the oxamide is best described as N=C–O− rather than as delocalized. In both complexes, the identical SBUs [Cu2(H2O)2(trans-dmapox)]2+ are further connected by the linker ipa or tpa in 1 and 2, respectively. Both of the phenyldicarboxylates coordinate to the copper(II) atoms in the bridging bis-monodentate fashion via two carboxylic oxygen atoms, which have the longer C–O bond distances than the uncoordinated ones. The dihedral angles between the carboxyl groups and the phenyl rings planes in the ipa and tpa ligands are 84.95° and 80.01°, respectively. The coordination modes of the ipa and tpa ligands in 1 and 2 are similar to those in the complexes of {[Cu(L)(H2O)(ipa)]5H2O} n [L=1,1′-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole)] [37] and {[Cu(pmedien)(H2O)]2(tpa)}(ClO4)2 (pmedien=pentamethyldiethylenetriamine) [38]. By the self-assembly of the SBUs [Cu2(H2O)2(trans-dmapox)]2+ and the linkers phenyldicarboxylate, infinite one-dimensional chains running along the c axis are formed, as depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 . For the complex 1, the Cu···Cu separations through μ-trans-oxamidate and ipa bridges are 5.245(5)Å and 8.212(3)Å, respectively. While in the complex 2, the corresponding Cu···Cu separations are 5.237(8)Å and 11.171(1)Å, respectively. 3.4 DNA binding studies 3.4.1 Electronic absorption titration Electronic absorption spectroscopy is an effective method to examine the binding modes of the metal complexes with DNA. In general, the hypochromism and red shift are associated with the binding of the colored complexes to DNA, due to the intercalative mode involving a strong stacking interaction between the aromatic chromophore of complexes and the base pairs of DNA [39]. The absorption spectra of the two copper(II) complexes in the absence and presence of HS-DNA are given in Fig. 5 . As shown in Fig. 5, when titrated by HS-DNA, both of the two copper(II) complexes presented significant hypochromism effect centered at 235nm and 238nm respectively, accompanied the slightly red shifts of 1nm and 2nm in the absorbance maxima for 1 and 2 respectively. These spectral characteristics reveal that both of the two complexes interact with HS-DNA most likely through the intercalation mode that involves π–π stacking interaction between the phenyldicarboxylate chromophore and the base pairs of DNA. In order to further evaluate the binding strength of the two copper(II) complexes with HS-DNA, the intrinsic binding constants K b were determined by monitoring the changes in absorbance at 235nm and 238nm using the following equation [40]: [ DNA ] / ( ε a - ε f ) = [ DNA ] / ( ε b - ε f ) + 1 / [ K b ( ε b - ε f ) where [DNA] is the concentration of DNA, ε f, ε a and ε b correspond to the extinction coefficient, respectively, for the free copper(II) complex, for each addition of DNA to the copper(II) complex and for the copper(II) complex in the fully bound form. A plot of [DNA]/(ε a − ε f) versus [DNA], gives K b, the intrinsic binding constant as the ratio of slope to the intercept. From the [DNA]/(ε a − ε f) versus [DNA] plots (insets in Fig. 5), the binding constants for the complexes 1 and 2 were estimated to be 1.22(±0.2)×104 M−1 (R =0.9904 for nine points) and 1.45(±0.3)×104 M−1 (R =0.9952 for eight points) respectively. The extinction coefficients of the free and bound complexes are 23,380M−1 cm−1 and 14,840M−1 cm−1 for 1, and 35,130M−1 cm−1 and 29,020M−1 cm−1 for 2, respectively. 3.4.2 The ethidium bromide fluorescence displacement experiments In order to further investigate the interaction mode between the two copper(II) complexes and HS-DNA, the ethidium bromide (EB) fluorescence displacement experiments were also employed. The intrinsic fluorescence intensity of DNA is very low, and that of EB in Tris–HCl buffer is also not high due to quenching by the solvent molecules. However, on addition of DNA, the fluorescence intensity of EB will be enhanced because of its intercalation into the DNA. Thus, EB can be used to probe the interaction of complexes with DNA. If the complexes can intercalate into DNA, the binding sites of DNA available for EB will be decreased, and hence the fluorescence intensity of EB will be quenched [41]. In our experiment, as illustrated in Fig. 6 , the fluorescence intensities of EB bound to HS-DNA at 584nm show remarkable decreasing trends with the increasing concentration of the copper(II) complexes 1 and 2, indicating that some EB molecules were released into solution after the exchange with the copper(II) complexes which resulted in the fluorescence quenching of EB. This observation may be interpreted as the intercalation of the copper(II) complexes between the base pairs of HS-DNA or the stacking of the complexes on the outside of HS-DNA. Such a quenched fluorescence behavior of EB bound to DNA caused by the interaction between the two copper(II) complexes and DNA is also found in the literature for the terephthalate-bridged tetranuclear copper(II) complex [10]. The quenching of EB bound to DNA by either of the two copper(II) complexes is in agreement with the linear Stern–Volmer equation [42]: I 0 / I = 1 + K sv [ Q ] where I0 and I represent the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively. K sv is a linear Stern–Volmer quenching constant, Q is the concentration of quencher. In the quenching plots (insets in Fig. 6) of I 0 /I versus [complex], K sv values are given by the slopes. The K sv values for the copper(II) complexes 1 and 2 are 1.02×104 (R =0.9934 for six points) and 3.40×104 (R =0.9920 for six points), respectively. 3.4.3 Cyclic voltammetric studies The application of the cyclic voltammetric technique to the study of interaction between metal complexes and DNA provides a useful complement to the previously used spectral studies [43]. In the present study it has been employed to understand the nature of DNA binding of the two copper(II) complexes, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . As can be seen in this figure, in the presence of HS-DNA, the cyclic voltammograms of the two copper(II) complexes exhibited significant shifts in the anodic and cathodic peak potentials followed by decrease in both peak currents, indicating the interaction existing between the two copper(II) complexes and HS-DNA. The E 1/2 values for the two copper(II) complexes 1 and 2 in the presence of HS-DNA are 125mV and 140mV respectively, and exhibit positive shifts of 29mV and 24mV, respectively. The positive shifts in E 1/2 of the two complexes in the presence of HS-DNA indicate that the two complexes may interact with DNA by intercalation [44,45]. The shift in the value of the formal potential ( Δ E 0 ′ ) can be used to estimate the ratio of equilibrium binding constants (K R/K 0) according to the model of interaction described by Bard and Carter [46]. From this model one can obtain that: Δ E 0 ′ = E b 0 ′ - E f 0 ′ = 59.15 log ( K R / K O ) where Δ E b 0 ′ and Δ E f 0 ′ are the formal potentials of the bound and free complex forms, respectively, and K R and K O are the corresponding binding constants for the binding of reduction and oxidation species to HS-DNA, respectively. The K Cu(I)/K Cu(II) values for the complexes 1 and 2 are 3.10 and 2.50 respectively, suggesting the stronger binding affinity in the Cu(I) state compared to the Cu(II) state for both of the copper(II) complexes. In addition to changes in the formal potentials, upon the addition of HS-DNA, both the voltammetric currents of the two copper(II) complexes decreased. The decrease in peak current can be explained in terms of the slow diffusion of the copper(II) polymer bound to the large HS-DNA molecule [44]. For either of the two copper(II) complexes, it was noted from the voltammograms collected at the different scan rates in the range from 0.1 to 1.0Vs−1 in the presence of HS-DNA, that the peak currents were also directly proportional to the square root of the scan rates, indicating that the electrochemical processes of the two copper(II) complexes bound to HS-DNA are also diffusion controlled. 3.4.4 Viscosity measurements Viscosity measurement, which is sensitive to the changes in the length of DNA molecule is regarded as the least ambiguous and the most critical means studying the binding mode of complexes with DNA in solution and provides stronger arguments for intercalative binding mode [47,48]. To further clarify the interaction mode of the two copper(II) complexes and HS-DNA, the viscosity measurement was carried out. For either of the two copper(II) complexes, the relative viscosity of HS-DNA increased obviously with the increasing concentration of the copper(II) complex. The viscosity increase can be ascribe to the length increase of the HS-DNA double helix due to the intercalation of the two copper(II) complexes between the base pairs of DNA [49,50]. Considering the crystal structures and the DNA binding results obtained by using absorption, emission spectral and electrochemical techniques and viscometry of the two copper(II) complexes, we conclude that both of the two copper(II) complexes 1 and 2 interact with HS-DNA in the mode of intercalation. Further investigations are still required in order to get a deeper insight into the DNA binding studies of the complexes bridged both by the oxamidate and phenyldicarboxylate ligands and are in progress in our laboratory. 4 Conclusions The self-assembly of SBUs and organic linker molecules with versatile coordination modes has been proved to be an effective strategy to construct polymeric MOFs. Herein, two copper(II) polymers [Cu2(H2O)2(dmapox)(ipa)2] n (1) and [Cu2(H2O)2(dmapox)(tpa)2] n (2) were obtained by the self-assembly of [Cu2(H2O)2(trans-dmapox)]2+ (SBUs) and the phenyldicarboxylate (linkers). The results of X-ray single-crystal diffraction show that both the two copper(II) complexes consist of one-dimensional chain linked by the bis-tridentate trans-dmapox and monodentate phenyldicarboxylate ligands. The Cu···Cu separations through μ-trans-dmapox and phenyldicarboxylato bridging ligands are 5.245(5)Å and 8.212(3)Å for 1, and 5.237(8)Å and 11.171(1)Å for 2, respectively. The interactions of the two copper(II) complexes with HS-DNA have been investigated by using the absorption and emission spectrophotometric methods, as well as the electrochemical techniques and viscometry. The results reveal that both the two copper(II) complexes interact with the HS-DNA in the mode of intercalation. 5 Abbreviations H2dmapox N,N′-bis[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]oxamide ipa isophthalic acid tpa terephthalic acid HS-DNA herring sperm DNA MOFs metal-organic frameworks SBUs second building units GCE glassy carbon working electrode SCE saturated calomel reference electrode Tris tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane DMSO dimethyl sulfoxide DMF dimethylformamide EB ethidium bromide Supplementary materials Crystallographic data have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre with the deposition numbers 664717 and 664719 for 1 and 2, respectively.
