Graphical abstract Five divalent metal diphenate luminescent coordination polymers with pyridyl-piperazine type ligands have been prepared. {[Cd3(diphenate)4(H23-bpmp)(H3-bpmp)(H2O)2](ClO4)·7H2O} n (2, 3-bpmp=bis(3-pyridylmethyl)piperazine) possesses a very rare 4-connected 658 dmp topology based on anionic trinuclear nodes. In contrast, {[Cd(diphenate)(4-bpfp)]·H2O} n (3, 4-bpfp=bis(4-pyridylformyl)piperazine) manifests a non-interpenetrated diamondoid lattice. Research highlights ► Cadmium and zinc diphenate coordination polymers with flexible dipyridine ligands. ► Cadmium 3-bpmp derivatives have grid-like or rare dmp topology. ► Cadmium 4-bpfp and 4-bpmp derivatives have diamondoid and grid topologies. ► Zinc 4-bpmp derivative has a 2-fold interpenetrated diamondoid lattice. ► All materials undergo blue-violet luminescence. Hydrothermal synthesis has afforded five d 10 configuration divalent metal diphenate coordination polymers containing pyridyl-piperazine type ligands, which were structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. {[Cd(diphenate)(3-bpmp)(H2O)]·0.5H2O} n (1, 3-bpmp=bis(3-pyridylmethyl)piperazine) has a double layer topology. Its perchlorate-containing analog {[Cd3(diphenate)4(H23-bpmp)(H3-bpmp)(H2O)2](ClO4)·7H2O} n (2) possesses a very rare 4-connected 658 dmp topology based on anionic trinuclear nodes. {[Cd(diphenate)(4-bpfp)]·H2O} n (3, 4-bpfp=bis(4-pyridylformyl)piperazine) manifests a non-interpenetrated diamondoid lattice, while the related compound [Cd(diphenate)(4-bpmp)(H2O)] n (4, 4-bpmp=bis(4-pyridylmethyl)piperazine) has a simple (4,4) grid topology. {[Zn(diphenate)(4-bpmp)]·0.5H2O} n (5) displays a 2-fold interpenetrated diamondoid lattice. Luminescent properties of these materials are also reported. Keywords Cadmium Zinc Coordination polymer Diphenate Luminescence Interpenetration 1 Introduction Coordination polymers formed from divalent metal ions and aromatic dicarboxylate ligands have demonstrated utility in many industrially relevant applications [1,2], including gas storage [3], small molecule adsorption and separation [4], anion exchange [5], heterogeneous catalysis [6], luminescence [7] and second harmonic generation [8]. Depending on the metal coordination geometry preference and carboxylate-group binding modes, a large variety of structural topologies are accessible within these crystalline solids [9]. Structural diversity is especially prevalent among divalent zinc and cadmium coordination polymer phases [10], because the absence of crystal field stabilization in the d 10 electronic configuration allows the conformational and steric requirements of the carboxylate ligands to play a major structure-directing role. The diphenate ligand (biphenyl-2,2′-dicarboxylate, Scheme 1 ) has proven useful for the design and construction of coordination polymers with diverse topologies [11–16], in part because of its ability to adopt various twisted and locked conformations in response to supramolecular conditions during self-assembly. For example, [Cu(diphenate)(4,4′-bpy)] n and [Cu(diphenate)(dpee)] n (4,4′-bpy=4,4′-bipyridine; dpee=1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene) exhibit 3-D networks with 4-connected cds (CdSO4 prototype) 658 topology, constructed from [Cu(diphenate)] n helices linked by tethering dipyridine ligands [11]. {[Co2(diphenate)(H2O)6]·11H2O} n has a 2-D network with entrained “infinite” 2-D water layers comprising linked water molecule pentamers [12]. [Zn(diphenate)(4,4′-bpy)] n possesses a rare 2-fold interpenetrated 3-D network with a uninodal 4-connected 4284 topology, built from linked helical [Zn(diphenate)] n chains [13]. Recently our group has utilized the dipyridyl/piperazine type neutral tethering ligands bis(3-pyridylmethyl)piperazine (3-bpmp), its isomer bis(4-pyridylmethyl)piperazine (4-bpmp), and the latter’s amide congener bis(4-pyridylformyl)piperazine (4-bpfp) (Scheme 1) in order to expand the topological scope of divalent metal carboxylate coordination polymers. These ligands all provide a combination of long span, conformational flexibility, and hydrogen-bonding points of contact. Previous results in an isophthalate/4-bpmp coordination polymer system revealed a marked dependence of metal coordination environment on network topology, with the cadmium and zinc derivatives possessing dimeric cluster-based 2-D (4,4) grid and 5-fold interpenetrated diamondoid nets, respectively [17]. [Co3(oxybisbenzoate)3(4-bpmp)2] n ) manifested a unique, strikingly aesthetic 8-connected self-penetrated topology [18]. In contrast, the 3-bpmp ligand tends to promote the formation of simple grid [19] and chain [20] topologies, perhaps because of the shorter distance between its pyridyl nitrogen donors and resulting geometric constraints. Despite the successful synthesis of a rare 3,5-connected binodal (4.62)(4.6683) 3-D topology in {[Cd(SO4)(4-bpfp)(H2O)]·H2O} n and related 2-D phases with other oxoanion ligands [21], the coordination polymer chemistry of 4-bpfp remains extremely underdeveloped. In this contribution we report the synthesis and structural characterization of five d 10 configuration ion coordination polymers containing diphenate and dipyridyl/piperazine type ligands: {[Cd(diphenate)(3-bpmp)(H2O)]·0.5H2O} n (1), {[Cd3(diphenate)4(H23-bpmp)(H3-bpmp)(H2O)2](ClO4)·7H2O} n (2), {[Cd(diphenate)(4-bpfp)]·H2O} n (3), [Cd(diphenate)(4-bpmp)(H2O)] n (4), and {[Zn(diphenate)(4-bpmp)]·0.5H2O} n (5). Significant diversity in the resulting topologies is evident, and comparisons with previously reported cadmium and zinc diphenate species are made. All five new crystalline phases undergo visible-light emission upon exposure to ultraviolet light. 2 Experimental 2.1 General considerations Metal salts and diphenic acid were obtained commercially. Bis(3-pyridylmethyl)piperazine (3-bpmp) [22], bis(4-pyridylmethyl)piperazine (4-bpmp) [22] and bis(4-pyridylformyl)piperazine (4-bpfp) [21] were prepared via published procedures. Water was deionized above 3MΩcm in-house. Elemental analysis was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS/O Analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on powdered samples on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One instrument. The luminescence spectra were obtained with a Hitachi F-4500 Fluorescence Spectrometer on solid crystalline samples anchored to quartz microscope slides with Rexon Corporation RX-22P ultraviolet-transparent epoxy adhesive. Caution! Perchlorate salts can be hazardous. While compound 2 did not exhibit any harmful instability, it was not subjected to heating to avoid explosive decomposition. 2.2 Preparation of {[Cd(diphenate)(3-bpmp)(H2O)]·0.5H2O} n (1) CdSO4 (38mg, 0.18mmol), 3-bpmp (99mg, 0.37mmol) and diphenic acid (44mg, 0.18mmol) were placed into 5mL distilled H2O in a 15mL screw-cap vial. The vial was sealed and heated in an oil bath at 80°C for 72h, whereupon it was cooled slowly to 25°C. Colorless plates of 1 (90mg, 77% yield based on Cd) were isolated after washing with distilled water and acetone, and drying in air. Anal. Calc. for C30H31CdN4O5.5 1: C, 55.61; H, 4.82; N, 8.65.

Reflection data was acquired using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.71073Å). The reflection data were integrated with Saint [23]. Lorentz and polarization effect and empirical absorption corrections were applied with Sadabs [24]. The structures were solved using direct methods and refined on F 2 using Sheltxl [25]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. Hydrogen atoms bound to carbon atoms were placed in calculated positions and refined with isotropic thermal parameters using a riding model. Hydrogen atoms bound to water molecules (where possible) or piperazinyl nitrogen atoms were located by Fourier difference map and restrained at fixed positions. The crystal of 1 was non-merohedrally twinned; its twin law was determined using CELL NOW [26]. Some racemic twinning was evident in the crystal of 2, as indicated by the Flack parameter [27] of 0.245(13). Attempted refinements of the structure of 2 in any other orthorhombic space group gave poor results including an inability to model thermal ellipsoids properly. As such a racemic twin model was used, resulting in acceptable crystallographic statistics. Crystallographic disorder among the piperazinyl rings in 3 was modeled successfully using partial occupancies. Platon software [28] was used to calculate solvent-accessible void spaces. Relevant crystallographic data for 1–5 are listed in Table 1 . 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Synthesis and spectral characterization Hydrothermal reaction of a metal salt, diphenic acid, and the appropriate dipyridyl ligand generated crystalline samples of 1–5. The infrared spectra of all materials were consistent with the organic components seen in their crystal structures. Features corresponding to pyridyl or phenyl ring flexing and puckering modes were observed in the region between 600 and 820cm−1. Medium intensity bands in the range of ∼1600 to ∼1200cm−1 arise from stretching modes of the aromatic rings of the dicarboxylate ligands and pyridyl rings within dipyridyl ligands. Asymmetric and symmetric C–O stretching modes of the benzenedicarboxylate moieties were evidenced by very strong, slightly broadened bands at 1556 and 1356cm−1 for 1, 1536 and 1373cm−1 for 2, 1573 and 1388cm−1 for 3, 1567/1544 and 1400cm−1 for 4, and 1588 and 1352cm−1 for 5. Weak, broad spectral features in the region of ∼3400cm−1 represent O–H stretching modes in bound or unligated water molecules, and the N–H stretching modes in 2. The very intense band at 1084cm−1 in the spectrum of 2 denotes stretching modes within the perchlorate ions. A feature at 1619cm−1 in 3 indicates the presence of the CO formyl groups within the 4-bpfp ligands. 4.2 Structural Description of {[Cd(diphenate)(3-bpmp)(H2O)]·0.5H2O} n (1) The asymmetric unit of compound 1 contains a divalent cadmium ion, a diphenate ligand, a 3-bpmp ligand, a bound water molecule, and a water molecule of crystallization disordered across a crystallographic inversion center. The coordination environment at cadmium is a distorted {CdO5N2} pentagonal bipyramid. Chelating carboxylate groups from two diphenate ligands fill four of the equatorial coordination sites at cadmium, with the fifth taken up by an aqua ligand. Pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from two 3-bpmp ligands lie in the axial positions. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination sphere are listed in Table 2 . Cadmium ions are linked by bis(chelating) diphenate ligands (Scheme 2 ) with a μ2-κ4O,O′:O″,O‴ binding mode along the [100] crystal direction and by tethering 3-bpmp ligands along the [001] crystal direction to construct a [Cd(diphenate)(3-bpmp)(H2O)] n (4,4) rhomboid grid coordination polymer layer motif (Fig. 1 a). The Cd⋯Cd contact distances across the diphenate and trans conformation 3-bpmp ligands are 9.1238 and 14.076Å, respectively. Slight pinching of the rhombic apertures within the grid is evident, with Cd⋯Cd⋯Cd angles of 74.4° and 105.6°. Phenyl rings within the trans conformation exobidentate diphenate ligands are twisted relative to each other by 47.53(13)°. Pairs of [Cd(diphenate)(3-bpmp)(H2O)] n coordination polymer layers, related by crystallographic inversion centers, aggregate into a slab pattern (Fig. 1b) by hydrogen bonding donation from aqua ligands in one layer to ligated diphenate carboxylate groups in the other (Table 3 ). Adjacent slab patterns stack along the [010] crystal direction, with symmetry-disordered water molecules of crystallization situated between slabs. These provide the supramolecular hydrogen bonding necessary for construction of the crystal structure of 1 (Fig. 1b), and occupy a scant 2.1% of the unit cell volume. 4.3 Structural Description of {[Cd3(diphenate)4(H23-bpmp)(H3-bpmp)(H2O)2](ClO4)·7H2O} n (2) The large asymmetric unit of compound 2 comprises three divalent cadmium ions (Cd1–Cd3), two aqua ligands, four diphenate ligands, one 3-bpmp ligand protonated at both of its piperazinyl nitrogen atoms, one 3-bpmp ligand protonated at only one of its piperazinyl nitrogen atoms, an unligated perchlorate ion, and seven total water molecules of crystallization. Cadmium atoms Cd1 and Cd3 are both seven-coordinate in distorted {CdO6N} pentagonal bipyramidal environments. In both cases, chelating carboxylate groups from two diphenate ligands take up four of the seven coordination sites, with a single oxygen atom donor from a third diphenate ligand occupying a fifth site. Aqua ligands and pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from singly protonated H3-bpmp+ ligands are aligned in a cis fashion, and fill the remaining two coordination sites at both Cd1 and Cd3. In contrast Cd2 is octahedrally coordinated with a {CdO4N2} environment. Here, two sets of cis equatorial positions are occupied by oxygen atoms from two different diphenate ligands, while the trans axial positions are taken up by pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from two different doubly protonated H23-bpmp2+ ligands. Bond lengths and angles within the three different coordination environments in 2 are listed in Table 4 . The binding modes for the four crystallographically independent diphenate ligands in 2 promote formation of anionic [Cd3(diphenate)4(H2O)2]2− trinuclear units (Fig. 2 ). Within the central region of the cluster are two exotridentate diphenate ligands with different binding modes (Scheme 2). One diphenate ligand adopts a cis conformation with a μ3–κ2O:O,O′:O′ binding mode, with each of its two oxygen atom donors bridging between cadmium atoms. The other diphenate ligand adopts a trans conformation and has a μ3–κ4O,O′:O′,O″:O″,O‴ binding mode, whose chelating carboxylate termini connect Cd1 and Cd3, while each also ligates to Cd2 via a single oxygen atom donor. On the periphery of the cluster, ligating to Cd1 and Cd3 in a simple κ2O,O′ binding mode, are cis conformation diphenate ligands whose two carboxylate groups are chelating and non-coordinating, respectively. The Cd1⋯Cd2 and Cd3⋯Cd2 through-space distances across the trinuclear unit measure 3.912 and 3.921Å, respectively. The central region of the trinuclear unit can also be reckoned as similar to two spiro fused {Cd2O2} rings. Each [Cd3(diphenate)4(H2O)2]2− trinuclear cluster connects to four others via singly protonated H3-bpmp+ ligands (which link to Cd1 and Cd3 atoms in two other clusters) and doubly protonated H23-bpmp2+ ligands (which link to Cd2 atoms in two other clusters) to form a 3-D cationic [Cd3(diphenate)4(H23-bpmp)(H3-bpmp)(H2O)2]+ coordination polymer network (Fig. 3 a). The former adopts a cis conformation with both pyridyl nitrogen atoms pointing in the same direction, while the latter exhibits a trans disposition of pyridyl donors. The singly protonated H3-bpmp+ ligands and doubly protonated H23-bpmp2+ ligands span Cd⋯Cd distances of 12.477 and 14.467Å, respectively, reflective of the specific ligand conformation. The topology of the non-interpenetrated [Cd3(diphenate)4(H23-bpmp)(H3-bpmp)(H2O)2]+ cationic framework in 2 can be simplified by considering each [Cd3(diphenate)4(H2O)2]2− trinuclear cluster as a 4-connected node. As revealed by TOPOS software [29], this net has a uninodal 4-connected 658 dmp 1 The Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource, which defines the official three-letter codes for coordination polymer topologies, can be found on the Internet at: http://rcsr.anu.edu.au/. 1 topology (Fig. 3b), with a long Vertex Symbol of 6.6.6.6.62.83. This net is rarely encountered in coordination polymer chemistry, with the chemically related phases [Zn(1,3-benzenedicarboxylate)(1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane)] n [30] and [Zn(5-nitroisophthalate)(1,2-bis(imidazol-1′-yl)ethane)] n [31] being the only two prior examples to the best of our knowledge. This 658 dmp topology is quite related to, but stands in contrast to the more commonly encountered 4-connected 658 cds topology, which has a different long Vertex Symbol of 6.6.6.6.62.∗. The coordination sequence for the dmp lattice is 4, 12, 30 62, 98, 144, 198, 262, 332, 412, while that for cds is 4, 12, 30, 58, 94, 138, 190, 250, 318, 394. Unligated, charge-balancing perchlorate ions and “infinite” water molecule chains (Fig. 4 ) with C10A2 classification [32] occupy the extra-framework space, which accounts for 12.8% of the unit cell volume. The water chains are anchored to the coordination polymer network by hydrogen bonding donation to diphenate oxygen atoms and hydrogen bonding acceptance from protonated piperazinyl nitrogen atoms. Partial hydrogen bonding data within these water chains is listed in Table 3. 4.4 Structural description of {[Cd(diphenate)(4-bpfp)]·H2O} n (3) The asymmetric unit of compound 3 contains a divalent cadmium atom on a crystallographic 2-fold rotation axis, half of a diphenate ligand, half of a 4-bpfp ligand whose central piperazinyl ring carbon atoms are disordered equally over two sets of positions, and a water molecule of crystallization statistically disordered across a pair of symmetry related positions. Cadmium atoms in 3 are coordinated in a slightly distorted {CdO4N2} octahedral pattern, with trans pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from two different 4-bpfp ligands. Two cis coordination sites are occupied by oxygen atoms from both carboxylate groups of a single diphenate ligand. The other two equatorial cis positions are taken up by oxygen atom donors from different diphenate ligands. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination sphere are listed in Table 5 . Diphenate ligands in a cis conformation exotridentate μ3–κ4O:O′,O″:O‴ binding mode (Scheme 2) produce 1-D [Cd(diphenate)] n chains (Fig. 5 ) that are oriented along the [001] crystal direction. Embedded within these chains are anti–syn bridged{Cd(OCO)}2 eight-membered rings, very similar to those seen in [Cd(diphenate)] n chains within the 2-D phase {[Cd2(4,4′-bipy)2(diphenate)2]·H2O} n [33]. The Cd⋯Cd contact distance across the dimeric units is 5.058Å. To accommodate the anti–syn carboxylate bridging mode, the phenyl rings of the diphenate ligands are twisted by 66° relative to each other. The [Cd(diphenate)] n chains are connected into a 3-D [Cd(diphenate)(4-bpfp)] n coordination polymer lattice (Fig. 6 ) by anti conformation 4-bpfp ligands, which provide a Cd⋯Cd contact distance of 16.427Å. Topological analysis reveals a non-interpenetrated 4-connected 66 topology diamondoid lattice for 3 (Fig. S1), in contrast to the 2-D (4,4) grid topology seen in {[Cd2(4,4′-bipy)2(diphenate)2]·H2O} n [33]. The water molecules of crystallization lie in the extra-framework space, which occupies 4.1% of the unit cell volume. 4.5 Structural Description of [Cd(diphenate)(4-bpmp)(H2O)] n (4) The asymmetric unit of compound 4 contains a divalent cadmium ion, a diphenate ligand, a 4-bpmp ligand, and an aqua ligand. Similar to 1, the coordination environment at cadmium is a distorted {CdO5N2} pentagonal bipyramid. Chelating carboxylate termini from two different diphenate ligands, and the aqua ligand occupy the equatorial positions. Pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from two 4-bpmp ligands fill the trans axial positions. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination environment are listed in Table 6 . Cadmium ions are linked by trans conformation diphenate ligands with a μ2–κ3O,O′:O″ chelating/monodentate binding mode (Scheme 2) along the [100] crystal direction and by 4-bpmp tethers along the [111] body diagonal crystal direction to construct a straightforward [Cd(diphenate)(4-bpmp)(H2O)] n (4,4) rhomboid grid coordination polymer layer (Fig. 7 ). The Cd⋯Cd contact distances across the diphenate and open conformation 4-bpmp ligands are 9.254 and 17.135Å, respectively. Some pinching of the apertures within the grid is apparent, with Cd⋯Cd⋯Cd angles subtending 78.0° and 102.0°. Phenyl rings within the exobidentate diphenate ligands are twisted relative to each other by 54.19(11)°. Weak interactions between unligated diphenate carboxylate oxygen atoms and cadmium ions (Cd⋯O distance=2.708Å) are present. The (4,4) grid topology of 4 resembles that of {[Cd2(4,4′-bipy)2(diphenate)2]·H2O} n [33], although individual carboxylate groups in 4 do not bridge two cadmium atoms. Pairs of [Cd(diphenate)(4-bpmp)] n layers aggregate into slab patterns (Fig. S2) by hydrogen bonding donation from aqua ligands in one layer to ligated and unligated diphenate carboxylate groups in the other (Table 3). Adjacent slab patterns stack along the [001] crystal direction. In contrast to its anion-free 3-bpmp analog 1, no solvent accessible space is available in the interlamellar regions of 4. 4.6 Structural Description of {[Zn(diphenate)(4-bpmp)]·0.5H2O} n (5) The asymmetric unit of compound 5 contains a divalent zinc ion, a diphenate ligand, a 4-bpmp ligand, and unligated water molecule with a 0.5 occupancy factor. As common for divalent zinc, the coordination environment is a slightly distorted {ZnO2N2} tetrahedron. Pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from two 4-bpmp ligands and oxygen atoms from monodentate carboxylate groups of two diphenate ligands define the coordination sphere. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination environment are listed in Table 7 . Diphenate ligands in trans-conformation in a bis(monodentate) bridging mode (μ2–κ2O:O″ binding mode, Scheme 2) connect neighboring zinc ions into a neutral [Zn(diphenate)] n chain (Fig. 8 ) pattern with a Zn⋯Zn internuclear distance of 6.370Å. Phenyl rings within the diphenate linkers have a mutual dihedral angle of 70.81(12)°. In turn the [Zn(diphenate)] n chains are conjoined by curled conformation 4-bpmp ligands to construct a [Zn(diphenate)(4-bpmp)] n 66 topology diamondoid net (Fig. 9 ), in which the Zn⋯Zn distances through the pyridyl tethers measure 14.415Å. Incipient voids within the framework allow interpenetration of an identical net. The 2-fold interpenetration (Fig. S3) within the diamondoid nets of 5 contrasts with the non-interpenetrated nature of those in the cadmium/4-bpfp analog 3. Despite having tetrahedral connecting nodes and the same level of interpenetration as seen in [Zn(diphenate)(4,4′-bpy)] n , the diamondoid topology of 5 contrasts greatly with the rare uoc 4284 topology evident in its 4,4′-bpy analog [13]. The remaining extra-framework space with the crystal structure of 5, containing 6.3% of the unit cell volume, is occupied by isolated water molecules of crystallization. 4.7 Luminescent properties of 1–5 Irradiation of crystalline samples of complex 1–5 with ultraviolet light (λ ex =345nm) in the solid state resulted in weak to moderate blue-violet visible light emission (Fig. 10 ), with λ max values given in Table 8 . The free ligands used in this study were also subjected to ultraviolet irradiation with an excitation wavelength of 345nm (Fig. S4). Only diphenic acid (λ max =438nm) and 4-bpfp (λ max =467nm) showed appreciable luminescence, with 3-bpmp and 4-bpmp exhibiting only weak emission with very broad, featureless spectral profiles. By comparison with other d 10 metal coordination polymers with aromatic ligands [7], the origins of the emissive behavior of 1–5 are likely π−π∗ or π−n electronic transitions within the molecular orbitals of the phenyl rings of the diphenate ligands and/or the pyridyl rings of the nitrogen-base ligands. Variances from the emission maxima of the free ligands are ascribed to changes in molecular orbital energy levels brought about by coordination to the metal and specific carboxylate binding modes. 5 Conclusions Cadmium and zinc diphenate coordination polymers containing bispyridyl-piperazine tethering ligands have been successfully synthesized and structurally characterized. Across this series, structural diversity is provided by a synergistic interplay of coordination geometry preference, diphenate binding mode, and nitrogen donor disposition. Piperazinyl ring protonation and resulting perchlorate anion inclusion in the 3-bpmp derivative 2 appears to play a major role in its preference for the cluster-based rare cationic dmp 658 topology 3-D lattice, at the expense of the common rhomboid grid topology seen in its anion-free analog 1. Use of the longer spanning 4-bpfp ligand promotes formation of 3-D diamondoid network in 3, as opposed to a 2-D layer structure in its 4,4′-bpy analog, despite the presence of anti–syn bridged cadmium diphenate chain motifs common to both. The different supramolecular environment provided by the absence of formyl groups in the 4-bpmp ligand results in a shift away from a 3-D net to the common (4,4) grid topology of 4. The tetrahedral coordination environment in 5 allows each zinc ion to act as a 4-connected node, enforcing a 2-fold interpenetrated diamondoid lattice in contrast to its 4,4′-bpy congener. Interpenetration is avoided in the diamondoid net of 3 by the closer spacing of metal ions. Further exploratory coordination polymer synthesis with this dipyridyl ligand set is underway in our laboratory, focusing especially on the under-utilized 4-bpfp ligand.
