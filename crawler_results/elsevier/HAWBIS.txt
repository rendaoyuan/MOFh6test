A new metal–organic framework based on hexanuclear copper units, Cu6(μ3-O)(μ3-OH)(pz)6(btc) (pz=pyrazolate, btc=1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) 1, has been prepared by the hydrothermal reaction of Cu2+ ions, Hpz and H3btc ligands in a methanolic solution. The hexanuclear copper building unit in 1 is composed of two triangular Cu3O(H)(pz)3 units bridged by carboxyl groups, in which each Cu center is coordinatively unsaturated with open coordination sites. The photocatalytic investigation indicates that compound 1 exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B. Graphical abstract A new MOF based on hexanuclear copper units was synthesized and structurally characterized as a (3,3)-connected network. Highlights ► A new MOF based on hexanuclear copper units was synthesized and characterized. ► The first example of MOFs based on Cu6 unit constructed by two Cu3(μ3-O) units. ► Each copper center is coordinatively unsaturated with open coordination sites. ► Compound 1 exhibits higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB. Keywords Metal–organic framework Copper cluster Unsaturated metal center Structure Photocatalytic activity In recent years, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have aroused great research interest because of their fascinating structures and potential applications in areas such as gas storage, catalysis, luminescence, magnetism and drug delivery [1]. One of the main synthetic strategies for MOFs is based on the diversity of polynuclear metallic units that can be linked with numerous organic linkers. Polynuclear copper units have attracted much attention due to their biological function, catalytic, luminescence and magnetic properties [2]. Designing MOFs based on polynuclear copper units may be a promising way to the achievement of high-efficiency biomimetic catalyst and magnetic porous materials. Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) present in methanotrophs is a kind of copper enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidation of methane to methanol [3]. The oxidized active site of pMMO is a trinuclear triangular CuII unit. A series of artificial synthesized trinuclear copper clusters, formulated as Cu3O(H)X3(azole)3 (X=H2O, MeOH, EtOH, RCOOH; azole=pyrazole, 1,2,4-triazole, and their derivatives) [4], may be viewed as mimics of the active trinuclear CuII unit in pMMO due to their structural similarity in two aspects: 1) They contain a Cu3O core composed of three CuII centers held together by a central μ3-O atom; 2) Each metal center is coordinatively unsaturated with open coordination sites. In these nearly planar triangular CuII 3O(H)X3(azole)3 clusters, the tetra-coordinated CuII centers show steric accessibility at the axial sites, thus resulting in possible interesting candidates for catalytic processes. The tetra-coordinated square planar geometry of the CuII center is defined by a central μ3-O atom, two N atoms from two azole ligands and a terminal solvent molecule. The liable terminal solvent molecule could be substituted by other ligands, which opens up the possibility of connecting these active trinuclear copper units into three-dimensional MOFs by suitable bridging ligands. However, to our knowledge, the MOFs constructed by this kind of triangular copper cluster are very scarce [5]. Hence, we try to synthesize new MOFs based on this kind of triangular copper cluster with unsaturated copper centers. With the use of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (btc) ligand, a new MOF CuII 6(μ3-O)(μ3-OH)(pz)6(btc) (pz=pyrazolate; btc=1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) 1, based on a hexanuclear copper unit composed of two triangular Cu3O(H)(pz)3 units, has been obtained (Fig. 1 ). Compound 1 was hydrothermally synthesized by a methanolic solution of copper nitrate, Hpz and H3btc ligands at 145°C for 3days [6]. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis [7] reveals that 1 crystallizes in the cubic Pa-3 space group and displays a three-dimensional framework constructed from hexanuclear copper clusters and btc linkers. In 1, three CuII centers are held together by a central bridging oxygen (hydroxo) ligand, and each pair of CuII centers is bridged by a pz ligand, leading to a trinuclear triangular Cu3O(H)(pz)3 unit. Two such trinuclear copper units are connected together by three carboxylate groups from three individual btc ligands in face to face mode to form a new hexanuclear Cu6O(OH)(pz)6(COO)3 unit. One of the trinuclear units has a μ3-O bridging group, and the three copper atoms and central oxygen atom are in the same plane, with a Cu–O distance and a Cu–O–Cu angle of 1.9054Å and 119.94°, respectively, providing the Cu…Cu distance of 3.2982Å. The other trinuclear unit has a μ3-OH bridging group, thus a pyramid is formed by the three copper atoms and central oxygen atom. The Cu–O distance and Cu–O–Cu angle in this pyramid are 1.9305Å and 117.82°, respectively, giving the Cu…Cu distance of 3.3055Å. In the hexanuclear copper unit, each CuII center adopts a distorted square planar geometry, which is coordinated by one central μ3-O atom, two N atoms from two different pz ligands and one carboxyl oxygen atom. The Cu…Cu distance between the two copper atoms bridged by one carboxyl group is 3.071Å, which is shorter than that in one trinuclear unit. In 1, each hexanuclear copper unit links to three btc ligands and each btc ligand connects with three hexanuclear copper units, thus leading to a three-dimensional (3,3)-connected framework with SrSi2 topology (Fig. 2 ). The three-dimensional framework possesses channels along the c axis of approximately 12.729×14.599Å (Fig. S1). The large channels allow an identical network to penetrate it, giving rise to a 2-fold interpenetrating net (Fig. 3 ). The solvent accessible volume of 1 calculated using PLATON is 10.5%. Interestingly, in the 2-fold interpenetrating net, the two hexanuclear copper units coming from two different nets are arranged in parallel with μ3-O…μ3-O distance as short as 2.6747Å, which is even shorter than that (3.3218Å) between the two trinuclear copper units in one hexanuclear unit (Fig. S2). This arrangement leads to the formation of a novel dodecanuclear copper cluster. Three hexanuclear copper clusters possessing similar structures with 1 have been reported. [Cu6(μ3-O)2(μ-4-Rpz)6(μ-4-R′-3,5-Ph2pz)3] cluster consists of two trinuclear [Cu3(μ3-O)(μ-pz)3]+ units bridged by three 3,5-Ph2pz ligands [8]. [Cu6(μ3-O)(μ3-OH) (μ-4-NO2-pz)6(μ-O2CPh)3(O2CPh)2(H2O)] cluster contains two trinuclear [Cu3(μ-4-NO2-pz)3] units bridged symmetrically by one and unsymmetrically by two benzoate groups [9], and Cu6(μ3-OMe)2(μ-pz)9Cl cluster is composed of two trinuclear {Cu3(MeO)(pz)3}2+ units held together by three pyrazolate ligands [10]. However, to our knowledge, all three hexanuclear copper clusters are isolated as discrete clusters. 1 represents the first example of a MOF based on the hexanuclear copper cluster constructed by two trinuclear triangular copper clusters. The IR spectrum of compound 1 exhibits the absorption bands of the asymmetric and symmetric carboxyl group vibrations at 1570 and 1430cm−1, respectively (Fig. S1). The Δυ (υas(COO)−υs(COO)) is 140cm−1, suggesting a bidentate bridge coordination mode of the carboxyl group. An additional broad band near 3442cm−1 is attributed to the O–H absorption vibration (Fig. S3). Thermal analysis presents that the total weight loss of compound 1 is 53.20% due to decomposition of the btc ligands and pz ligands in the temperature range of 280–520°C, which is in agreement with the calculated value 54.22% (as shown in Fig. S4). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was measured to confirm the phase purity and to examine the crystallinity of bulk samples (Fig. S5). It has been shown recently that MOFs are attractive candidates for studying photophysical behavior, especially the UV-assisted decomposition of organic dyes [11]. Herein, we selected an organic dye, Rhodamine B (RhB) as a model pollutant in aqueous media to evaluate the photocatalytic effectiveness of compound 1, considering that RhB is commonly used as representative of a widespread organic dye that is very difficult to decompose in waste streams under UV or visible light irradiation. We took a suspension of powdered catalyst 1 (100mg) in fresh aqueous solution of RhB (100mL, 2×10−5 mol/L) and sonicated for 0.5h. Then, the mixture was stirred continuously under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation from a 375W high pressure mercury vapor lamp. A sample was taken every 15min, but the starting point did not contain the first 15min in order to rule out the effect of its absorption to the particle surfaces. By contrast, the simple photolysis comparative experiment was also completed under the same conditions without any catalyst. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, changes in the concentration of RhB solution were plotted versus irradiation time. It can be seen that approximately 60% of RhB had been decomposed during the first 15min with catalyst, but under the same conditions only 11% of RhB had been decomposed without any catalyst (Fig. S6). This phenomenon indicated that compound 1 had a higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB. In conclusion, a new MOF constructed by hexanuclear copper units with unsaturated CuII centers has been successfully synthesized. It represents the first example of MOFs based on the hexanuclear copper clusters formed by two trinuclear triangular copper units. The photocatalytic study shows that compound 1 exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB. The existence of interpenetration makes the pore size of 1 very small, which prohibits the application of 1 in catalysis. Thus, further work will focus on how to increase the pore size of this framework, including preventing interpenetration and using longer ligands to replace btc ligands.

Elemental analyses of Cu for 1 were performed by a Leaman inductively<br>coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer; C, H and N of 1 were performed on a Perkin-<br>Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer. IR spectrum of 1 was recorded in the range of<br>400–4000 cm–1 on a BRUKER Vertex 70 FTIR Spectrophotometer with pressed KBr<br>pellets. The photoanalyze and UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a 756 CRT<br>UV-vis spectrophotometer. Thermal stability was determined by TG analyses on a<br>Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 instrument in flowing N with a heating rate of 10oC· min-1.<br>2</p>
