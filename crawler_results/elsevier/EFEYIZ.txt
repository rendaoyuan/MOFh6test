Graphical abstract Reaction of cadmium nitrate, 5-nitroisophthalic acid (H2nip) and one of two isomeric dipyridylamides resulted in coordination polymer crystalline solids that manifested different in situ reactivity and dimensionality. Hydrothermal treatment of cadmium nitrate, 5-nitroisophthalic acid (H2nip) and one of two isomeric dipyridylamides resulted in coordination polymer crystalline solids that manifested different in situ reactivity and dimensionality, as ascertained by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Hydrolysis of 3-pyridylisonicotinamide (3-pina) afforded the 3-aminopyridine (3-ampyr) ligands observed in the 1-D ladder polymer {[Cd(nip)(3-ampyr)(H2O)]⋅2H2O} n (1). Conversely, hydrolysis of the isomeric precursor 3-pyridylnicotinamide (3-pna) generated the monoanionic nicotinate ligands in the 2-D coordination polymer [Cd2(nip)(nic)2(H2O)2] n (2). Compound 2 displays {Cd2(OCO)2} eight-membered ring dimeric units linked into (6,3) graphite-type slab motifs. Luminescent properties of these two new materials are also presented. Keywords In situ reactivity Dipyridylamide Crystal structure Coordination polymer Luminescence Introduction Research into the synthesis and characterization of coordination polymers remains very active in large part due to their burgeoning utility as gas storage substrates [1], shape-selective molecular adsorbents [2], stationary phases for ion exchange [3], heterogeneous catalysts for useful organic transformations [4], and sensors for detection of explosives traces via changes in light emission [5]. Additionally, these materials display a near infinite variety of aesthetically appealing structural topologies, many of which have not even been predicted mathematically [6]. Zinc and cadmium dicarboxylate coordination polymers with dipyridyl-type coligands have shown significant sorptive and catalytic capabilities, luminescent properties, and diverse topologies [7–14]. The structural diversity on display within this class of coordination polymers is predicated on the lack of any ligand field stabilization energy for the closed shell d 10 configuration of these ions. This causes a tendency towards varied coordination number and geometries, stabilized in response to the steric and geometric requirements imposed by nitrogen donor ligands, along with the specific dicarboxylate binding mode. Additionally the lack of any possible d–d electronic transitions in zinc or cadmium coordination complexes provides the requisite visible light spectral window for second harmonic generation or sorbent sensing properties. In comparison to materials containing the more commonly employed rigid-rod dipyridyl coligands like 4,4′-bpy and dabco, far fewer coordination polymers have been reported that contain one of the isomeric pyridylnicotinamide ligands 3-pyridylnicotinamide (3-pna, Scheme 1 ) or 3-pyridylisonicotinamide (3-pina, Scheme 1) [15–25]. The central amide functional group of the pyridylnicotinamide ligands can serve both hydrogen bonding donor and acceptor roles, providing access to structure-directing aspects lacking in the rigid-rod dipyridyl derivatives. Recently our group has set about remedying the dearth of coordination polymers containing 3-pna or 3-pina, uncovering a striking dependence of nitrogen donor disposition on the resulting topology. {[Cd(suc)(3-pina)(H2O)]⋅3.5H2O} n exhibits isolated cadmium ions pillared into 2-D rectangular grids, while {[Cd(suc)(3-pna)]⋅2.5H2O} n (suc=succinate) has a simple 3-D non-interpenetrated 41263 pcu network based on embedded {Cd2O2} rhomboid dimers [20]. [Cu(adp)(3-pina)] n (adp=adipate) manifests a common (4,4) grid layer topology like its cadmium succinate analog, while {[Cu(adp)(3-pna)]⋅2.5H2O} n possesses a dimer-based 3-D network with a far less common 658 cds topology [21]. In the attempt to prepare a cadmium analog of {[Cu(adp)(3-pna)]⋅2.5H2O} n , in situ hydrolysis of the dipyridylamide precursor was observed. The ensuing 3-aminopyridine (3-ampyr) and nicotinate (nic) fragments were incorporated into the resulting 1-D ribbon coordination polymer {[Cd2(adp)(nic)2(H2O)3(3-ampyr)]⋅5H2O} n [22]. Use of 3-pina avoided the in situ amide hydrolysis, affording the dimer-based (4,4) grid 2-D coordination polymer {[Cd(adp)(3-pina)]⋅H2O} n . Employing substituted isophthalate ligands in lieu of straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylates, in tandem with a dipyridylamide ligand, has recently afforded unprecedented coordination polymer topologies with dipyridylamide ligands. For instance, {[Cd3(3-pna)2(sip)2(H2O)6]⋅2H2O} n (sip=5-sulfoisophthalate) displayed a new binodal 3,4-connected (6284)(628)4 layer topology due to sulfonate binding, while its 4-pyridylnicotinamide (4-pna) analog [Cd(H4-pna)(sip)] n manifested a 5-connected 43668 self-penetrated supramolecular network [23]. We thus sought to further extend these efforts by utilizing the related 5-nitroisophthalate (nip) ligand. In contrast to the sip ligand, the nip ligand is expected to only bind to cadmium via its carboxylate groups, because of the electron withdrawing nature of the nitro substituent. Herein we report the synthesis, structural characterization, and luminescent properties of {[Cd(nip)(3-ampyr)2(H2O)]⋅2H2O} n (1) and [Cd2(nip)(nic)2(H2O)2] n (2), in which the nic and 3-ampyr ligands were formed via in situ hydrolysis of the different isomeric dipyridylamide precursors used. Experimental section General considerations Cadmium nitrate and 5-nitroisophthalic acid were commercially obtained. Condensation of 3-aminopyridine and nicotinoyl chloride hydrochloride in dry pyridine afforded crystalline 3-pyridylnicotinamide (3-pna) after quenching with water, extracting with chloroform, removal of solvent in vacuo, and recrystallization from water [26]. Crystalline 3-pyridylisonicotinamide (3-pina) was prepared via a similar procedure, but substituting isonicotinoyl chloride hydrochloride. Water was deionized above 3MΩ-cm in-house. IR spectra were recorded on powdered samples using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One instrument. The luminescence spectra were obtained with a Hitachi F-4500 Fluorescence Spectrometer on solid crystalline samples anchored to quartz microscope slides with Rexon Corporation RX-22P ultraviolet-transparent epoxy adhesive. Elemental Analysis was carried out using a Perkin Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS/O Analyzer. Preparation of {[Cd(nip)(3-ampyr)(H2O)]⋅2H2O} n (1) Cd(NO3)2⋅6H2O (86mg, 0.25mmol), 3-pina (55mg, 0.28mmol), and 5-nitroisophthalic acid (59mg, 0.28mmol) were mixed with 10mL of distilled H2O and 1.0mL of 1M NaOH in a 23mL Teflon-lined acid digestion bomb. The bomb was sealed and heated in an oven at 120°C for 5 days, and then was cooled slowly to 25°C. Straw-colored blocks of 1 (99mg, 85% yield based on Cd) were isolated after washing with distilled water, ethanol, and acetone and drying in air. Anal.

X-ray crystallography Diffraction data for 1 and 2 were collected on a Bruker-AXS SMART-CCD X-ray diffractometer using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.71073Å). The data were processed via SAINT [27], and subjected for Lorentz and polarization effect and absorption corrections using SADABS [28]. The structures were solved using direct methods with SHELXTL [29]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms bound to carbon were placed in calculated positions and refined isotropically with a riding model. Hydrogen atoms within the water molecules and the amine groups of the 3-aminopyridine ligands were found where possible by Fourier difference map and then restrained. Crystallographic details for 1 and 2 are given in Table 1 . Results and discussion Synthesis and spectra Crystalline samples of 1 were produced by the hydrothermal reaction of cadmium nitrate, 5-nitroisophthalic acid, and 3-pina in the presence of some sodium hydroxide. A similar reaction was used to generate 2, by using 3-pna instead of 3-pina. In both cases, in situ amide hydrolysis by nucleophilic attack of water upon the dipyridylamide carbonyl group was observed. In the case of the 3-pina precursor the hydrolysis reaction produces 3-aminopyridine (3-ampyr) and isonicotinate (Scheme 2 ). A similar in situ hydrolysis event for the 3-pna precursor was observed; in addition to 3-ampyr the meta-carboxylate nicotinate (nic) anion was formed (Scheme 3 ). This in situ hydrolysis of 3-pna was seen in the self-assembly of the cadmium adipate 1-D ribbon coordination polymer {[Cd2(adp)(nic)2(H2O)3(3-ampyr)]⋅5H2O} n [22]. The infrared spectra of 1 and 2 were consistent with their structural components as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Intense, broadened asymmetric and symmetric C–O stretching bands within the carboxylate ligands were observed at 1598 and 1369cm−1 in 1, and at 1607 and 1370cm−1 in 2. Sharp and medium intensity bands in the range of ∼1600cm−1 to ∼1300cm−1 were ascribed to stretching modes of the pyridyl rings of the nicotinate or 3-aminopyridine ligands, and/or the phenyl rings of the nip ligands [30]. Features corresponding to C–H bending and ring puckering within the phenyl and pyridyl moieties exist in the region between ∼900 and ∼650cm−1. Broad, weak spectral bands in the vicinity of ∼3400 to 3000cm−1 indicate the presence of bound and unbound water molecules and 3-ampyr N–H bonds in 1 and 2. Asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands of the nitro groups of the nip ligands were denoted by pairs of peaks at 1547 and 1345cm−1 for 1 and 1547 and 1344cm−1 for 2. Infrared spectra for 1 and 2 are shown in Figs. S1 and S2. Structural description of {[Cd(nip)(3-ampyr)(H2O)]⋅2H2O} n (1) The asymmetric unit of compound 1 contains a divalent cadmium atom, an nip ligand, an aqua ligand, a 3-aminopyridine ligand, and two water molecules of crystallization. The coordination sphere at cadmium is a distorted {CdO4N2} octahedron (Fig. 1 ), with a chelating nip carboxylate group, a single oxygen donor atom from a second nip ligand, and a pyridyl nitrogen atom from a 3-ampyr ligand defining the equatorial plane. Axial positions are taken up the aqua ligand, and the primary amine nitrogen atom from a second 3-ampyr ligand. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination environment are listed in Table 1. The 3-ampyr ligands were formed in situ via hydrolysis of 3-pina (Scheme 2), with the isonicotinate by-product not incorporated into the final crystal structure. Adjacent cadmium atoms are bridged by nip ligands in a chelating/monodentate μ2-κ3O,O′:O′′ binding mode to build [Cd(nip)(H2O)] n 1-D chain motifs with a Cd⋯Cd distance of 9.796Å. Pairs of these chain motifs are strutted into 3-connected [Cd(nip)(3-ampyr)(H2O)] n 1-D ladder coordination polymer patterns (Fig. 2 ) by pairs of 3-ampyr ligands. Each cadmium atom on the periphery of the ladder motifs has cis-disposed pyridyl and amine nitrogen donor atoms belonging to two 3-ampyr ligands. The Cd⋯Cd distance through the 3-ampyr ligand pairs, which act as the ‘rungs’ of the ladder and form {Cd2(NCCN)2} ten-membered circuits, is 6.530Å. The [Cd(nip)(H2O)] n 1-D chain motifs are oriented along the [110] crystal direction. They aggregate into supramolecular layers by means of hydrogen bonding donation from the aqua ligands to the unligated nip carboxylate oxygen atoms; these layers are oriented parallel to the ab crystal planes (Fig. S3). In turn the supramolecular layers aggregate via hydrogen bonding patterns mediated by the water molecules of crystallization, which engage in hydrogen bonding to nitro group and carboxylate group oxygen atoms of the nip ligands and also the aqua ligands. Hydrogen bonding information is given in Table 3 . Structural description of [Cd2(nip)(nic)2(H2O)2] n (2) The asymmetric unit of compound 2 contains two divalent cadmium atoms (Cd1, Cd2), an nip ligand, two nic ligands (nic-A, nic-B), and two aqua ligands. The coordination environment at each cadmium atom is rather distorted {CdO5N} octahedron (Fig. 3 ). At Cd1, the coordination sphere comprises an aqua ligand, a chelating nip carboxylate group, a single oxygen donor from a second nip ligand, a pyridyl nitrogen donor from a nic-A ligand, and an oxygen donor from a nic-B ligand. The arrangement at Cd2 is similar, except the pyridyl nitrogen donor belongs to a nic-B ligand, and the nic-A ligand donates an oxygen atom. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination sphere are listed in Table 4 . It is clear that the nic ligands of 2 formed via hydrolysis of the original 3-pna precursor under the synthetic conditions (Scheme 3), with the resultant 3-aminopyridine byproduct not being incorporated into the final crystal structure. A carboxylate group from a nic-B ligand and a carboxylate group from an nip ligand both bridge Cd1 and Cd2 in an anti-syn manner, thereby constructing {Cd2(OCO)2} eight-membered ring dimeric units. These have a Cd⋯Cd distance of 4.091Å. The O2 atom belonging to the nip ligand also directly bridges both Cd atoms, likely further stabilizing the dimeric unit. Each {Cd2(OCO)2} unit connects to three others, forming a coordination polymer layer with stoichiometry [Cd2(nip)(nic)2(H2O)2] n (Fig. 4 a). One of these linkages occurs via a pair of exobidentate μ2-κ2N:O nic-A ligands, resulting in a dimer centroid to dimer centroid distance of 7.417Å. The second linkage occurs via a pair of exotridentate μ3-κ3N:O:O′ nic-A ligands, each connecting a single Cd atom in one dimer to both Cd atoms in a neighboring dimer. This interaction results in a longer dimer centroid to dimer centroid distance of 8.293Å. Finally, a pair of nip ligands with an exotridentate μ3-κ4O,O′:O′′,O′′′:O′′′ binding mode provides the third interdimer connection, with an even longer dimer centroid to dimer centroid distance of 9.562Å. If the {Cd2(OCO)2} dimer centroids are thus considered to be 3-connected nodes, the resulting [Cd2(nip)(nic)2(H2O)2] n 2-D coordination polymer slab has a (6,3) graphite-type topology (Fig. 4b). The aqua ligands project above and below the slab motifs, and engage in hydrogen bonding (Table 3) to nic-A, nic-B and nip carboxylate oxygen atoms in neighboring slabs. Additionally, π–π stacking interactions between nip ligands in adjacent slab provides an ancillary structure stabilizing role. The slab motifs of 2 stack in an AAA pattern along the a crystal direction in order to optimize these supramolecular interactions (Fig. S4). Luminescent properties Powdered solid samples of 1 and 2 were irradiated with ultraviolet light in order to investigate their capability for photoluminescence. Excitation spectra were first recorded in order to determine the optimum wavelength for photoluminescent excitation, by monitoring emission at 400nm. For 1, and 2, the maximum excitation was observed at 205nm and 248nm, respectively. The emission spectra were then recorded, revealing blue-violet light fluorescence with relatively sharp emission maxima for 1 at 381nm and for 2 at 402nm, and spectral tails into the visible light region. To probe the origin of this emissive behavior, emission spectra for 3-ampyr and nicotinic acid were recorded. For 3-ampyr, excitation with ultraviolet light at 275nm resulted in a broad but weak emission profile with a λ max of 402nm. The blue-shifted and more intense emission profile for 1 could be reasonably ascribed to a minimization of radiationless energy loss due to binding of the 3-ampyr pyridyl and amine nitrogen atoms to cadmium. For nicotinic acid, excitation with ultraviolet light at 265nm resulted in a broad but more intense emission profile centered on 400nm. It is most likely that the fluorescent behavior of these materials can be attributed to π–π* or π–n molecular orbital transitions within the aromatic rings of both the 5-nitroisophthalate ligands and either the 3-ampyr (for 1) or nic ligands (for 2) [31]. Emission spectra for 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 5 . Conclusions The isomeric dipyridylamides 3-pyridylisonicotinamide and 3-pyridylnicotinamide both underwent in situ amide hydrolysis during hydrothermal reaction attempts to prepare cadmium coordination polymers with 5-nitroisophthalate ligands. In both cases, the in situ hydrolysis generated 3-aminopyridine, but this is only incorporated into the resulting coordination polymer if 3-pyridylisonicotinamide was the precursor used. Pairs of the 3-aminopyridine ligands end up serving as the rungs for the ladder motif cadmium 5-nitroisophthalate coordination polymer in 1. The other byproduct of dipyridylamide hydrolysis is a pyridylcarboxylate anion. The isonicotinate ion produced in the hydrolysis of 3-pyridylisonicotinamide did not become incorporated in the coordination polymer 1. However, the nicotinate ion produced in the in situ hydrolysis of 3-pyridylnicotinamide was incorporated into the graphitic (6,3) layer motifs of 2, serving both as bridging and exotridentate ligands to establish the coordination polymer structure. Thus there is an apparent preference for nicotinate ligands to bind to cadmium during the self-assembly of 2, as opposed to binding of potential 3-aminopyridine ligands. In contrast, 1 shows incorporation of 3-aminopyridine ligands as opposed to potential isoniconitate ligands. Within a series of cadmium 5-nitroisophthalate coordination polymers, it therefore appears that nicotinate and 3-aminopyridine are the preferred ancillary ligands over possible isonicotinate ligands.
