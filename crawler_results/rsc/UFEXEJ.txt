It is the ﬁrst time that nanorods are incorporated into metal–organic frameworks. Introduction Hybrid organic–inorganic coordination assembly, which may incorporate functionality from both their inorganic and organic components, is currently a very active area in chemical and materials research.1,2 Hybrid organic–inorganic frameworks with multidimensional M–O–M (M ¼ metals or clusters) connectivity have attracted much attention due to their improved thermal stability and materials supporting cooperative effects in their inorganic regions.3,4 Recent reports on such hybrid materials based on extended M–O–M bonds are focused on using transi- tion metals,3 and extended lanthanide oxide frameworks still remain rare.5 As a basic building unit for highly-dimensional framework, the simple 1D M–O–M inorganic chain (or rod) is particularly interesting. However, how to control the size of the inorganic rods is still a big challenge. No reports about the incorporation of nanosized inorganic rods into hybrid organic–inorganic frame- works are currently known. Recent success with lanthanide(Ln)- transition metal(TM) heterometallic complexes has opened up a new route to the synthesis of high-nuclearity nano-sized lanthanide oxide clusters.6–11 Such lanthanide oxide clusters are either discrete molecules or secondary building units linked by organic ligands in extended frameworks. To our knowledge, nano-sized lanthanide oxide cluster rods in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have never been known to date. The work reported here presents novel examples of the synthesis of nano-sized lanthanide oxide rods and an unusual in situ decarboxylation and metal/ligand redox reactions from pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (H2pzdc) to 3-hydroxy-pyrazine- 2-carboxylic acid (Hhpzc). It is interesting that CuI species and in situ synthesis of Hhpzc are simultaneously generated under the hydrothermal reaction. To date, in situ decarboxylation and metal/ligand redox reactions of multi-carboxylic acids containing N-donors occurred simultaneously have not been documented, although a few aryl carboxylic acids have recently been repor- ted.12,13 In this paper, we present three novel 3D Ln-TM coor- dination polymers [Ln2Cu(m6–O)1/6(m3–OH)2/3(m3–OH)2(hpzc)2 (H2O)2]$2H2O [Ln ¼ Dy(1), Ho(2), Er(3); Hhpzc ¼ 3-hydroxy- pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid]. These complexes consist of nano- sized lanthanide oxide rods linked by [Cu(hpzc)2]3 subunits to form 3D frameworks. The simple nano-sized lanthanide oxide clusters rod is based on the polynuclear hydroxo/oxo lanthanide cluster [Ln6(m6–O)(m3–OH)8]8+ which bridges through the in situ obtained O atoms of the Hhpzc ligands. Results and discussion X-Ray single-crystal structure analyses reveal that 1–3 are isostructural and crystallize in the high-symmetry trigonal space group R-3. Therefore, only the structure of 3 is described in detail. The prominent structural feature in each complex is the presence of the nano-sized lanthanide oxide clusters rod.

The basic unit of this rod is a hexanuclear [Er6(m6–O)(m3–OH)8]8+ cluster. In this cluster, the m6–O atom locates at a special site with 3 symmetry and simultaneously bridges six Er atoms into an [Er6(m6-O)] octahedral geometry. Each face of the [Er6(m6–O)] octahedron is covered by a m3–OH group. The [Er6(m6–O)(m3–OH)8]8+ cluster is bound by twelve hpzc ligands, and each Er3+ ion is nine-coor- dinated by four m3–OH, one m6–oxo, one carboxylate oxygen (OCOO) atom, two hydroxyl oxygen (OOH) and one nitrogen atom from two Hhpzc ligands. The Er–O bond lengths range from 2.209(3) to 2.5829(5) A˚ , whereas the Er–N distance is 2.513(4) A˚ . Two adjacent [Er6(m6–O)(m3–OH)8]8+ clusters share six deprotonated hydroxyl O atoms of the Hhpzc ligands, extending into an inﬁnite 1D inorganic Er-O-Er rod along the c axis. The diameter of this cylindrical Er-O-Er rod is about 1 nm (consider the atomic radius of the O atom). Such nano-sized Er-O-Er rod involving m2, m3, m6-oxygen atoms is, to our knowledge, unprecedented. The nano-sized Er-O-Er rods are further cross-linked by the [Cu(hpzc)2]3 building blocks with preferable Lewis-base coor- dination groups to produce extended 3D network with trigonal channels along the c axis (Fig. 1c). The [Cu(hpzc)2]3 (abbrevi- ated as LCu) building blocks, sometimes called ‘‘metalloligands’’14 may be viewed as secondary building units (SBUs). The LCu has three kinds of Lewis-base coordination groups, N atoms from pyrazine rings (group A), 3-hydroxyl (group B) and 2-carbox- ylate (group C) moieties, as shown in Chart 1, while the central Cu atom in the axial site of LCu is of Lewis-acid. In complex 3, group A and group C bind to two Er3+ ions from two different [Er6(m6–O)(m3–OH)8]8+ cluster units, respectively, whereas the [Er6(m6–O)(m3–OH)8]8+ cluster units are further linked through group B to form a 1D nano-sized Er-O-Er rod (Fig. 1a). One intriguing feature of the complex is the CuI center possessing an elongated octahedral geometry, two N atoms and two O atoms from two Hhpzc ligands (Cu–O ¼ 1.938(5), Cu–N ¼ 1.969(5) A˚ ) in the equatorial sites, and two aqua ligands in the elongated axial positions (Cu–O ¼ 2.622(2) A˚ ). The bond angles sum of CuN2O2 coordination sphere is close to an ideal square planar value of 720 in the equatorial plane. So the CuI centre is an elongated regular octahedral geometry. This may be attributed to rather rigid Hhpzc ligands, which is the possibility of forcing copper to adopt unusual coordination geometries.15 Some reported compounds also show that the CuI center has unusual coordination geometries, such as ﬂattened tetrahedron closely to square-planar geometry16 and square pyramidal coordination geometry.17 The intriguing aspect of these complexes is that the decar- boxylation and metal/ligand redox reaction occurred simulta- neously and H2pzdc was ﬁnally transformed into Hhpzc under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of CuII ions, and the charge of Cu ion was changed from +2 to +1. As shown in Scheme 1, the reaction mechanism may involve two steps: the ﬁrst, hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of CuII ions unex- pectedly caused in situ decarboxylation of the H2pzdc ligand that resulted in formation of Hpzc ligand (pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid). Notably, the above reactions have not been seen when we substitute other transition metals for CuII as far as our present study. The results indicate that CuII plays a catalytic role in the decarboxylation process. Several cases of hydro(solvo)thermal decarboxylation of a single carboxyl group from aryl carboxylic acids or multi-carboxylic acids containing N-donors have been reported to occur in reactions involving CuII.13,18 The second, metal/ligand redox reaction on the active site occurred, and Hpzc was oxygenated into Hhpzc, where the CuII ion acted as an essential oxidant and was reduced to an CuI ion, as illustrated previously,12,19 which is also consistent with the instances that the CuII ion is apt to be reduced to a CuI ion in the presence of N-containing ligands under hydrothermal conditions.18b,20 The presence of the CuI ion in 3 was conﬁrmed by EPR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. No signal was found in the EPR spectrum, and the spin–orbit components (2p3/2 and 2p1/2) of the Cu 2 p peak at approximately 932.1 and 952.0 eV with a spin–orbit separation of 19.9 eV (Fig. 2), which suggests the presence of CuI in the complex. This is in agreement with the results of the single-crystal X-ray analysis. Interestingly, the 3D framework is a special building structure with solid struts (the nano-sized Er-O-Er rods) and separation Chart 1 Scheme 1 Hhpzc, formed via the decarboxylation and metal/ligand redox reactions from H2pzdc.

The solvent-acces- sible volume is approximately 945.7 A˚ 3 per unit cell volume and the pore volume ratio is calculated to be 21.1% using the PLATON program.21 The thermogravimetric analyses and X-ray powder diffraction results show that the main framework can hold until 250 C after the removal of guest water molecules (Fig. 4 and Fig. S9 in the ESI†). A new symbol InOm (I ¼ inorganic and O ¼ organic, n ¼ 0–3 and m ¼ 0–3) created by Cheetham et al. is used to illustrate the dimensionality of different structures with respect to both organic connectivity between metal centers (O) and extended inorganic connectivity (I).1a The unique 3D hybrid organic– inorganic frameworks presented here ﬁrstly illustrate an unusual hybrid organic–inorganic construction mode I1O3. Without considering the bridging m3- and m6-oxygen atoms, the LCu SBUs connect Er3+ ions into a 3D M-ligand-M connectivity (O3). The 1D inorganic Er-O-Er rods (I1) are incorporated into this O3 framework. Magnetic properties The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibilities of 1–3 were measured in the temperature range of 2–300 K with a magnetic ﬁeld strength of 5000 Oe (Fig. 3 and ESI†). Only the molar magnetic susceptibility of 3 is described in detail owing to 1–3 exhibiting a similar temperature-dependence magnetic curve. The cMT value per molecule is 22.2 emu K mol1 at room tempera- ture, which is in agreement with the expected value for two free Er3+ ions with a 4I15/2 ground state.22 Upon cooling, the cMT value product continuously decreases, suggesting a dominant antifer- romagnetic interaction between adjacent Er3+ ions. The plot of cM 1 vs T obeys the Curie–Weiss law [c ¼ C/ (T  q)] with Curie constant, C, of 22.6 emu K mol1, and with Weiss constant, q, of 6.33 K, which ﬁts well the data in the range between 2 and 300 K. This behavior may be attributed to the splitting of the ligand ﬁeld of the Er3+ ion because of strong spin–orbit coupling.23 Thermogravimetric analyses Because of the isomorphic feature of 1–3, the TGA curve of 3 is described in detail as a typical example. The TG curve was obtained in a nitrogen atmosphere for a crystalline sample of 3 from 30 to 1200 C. It can be seen from the TG curve (Fig. 4) that there is a weight loss of 6.71% (calcd 6.84%) in the temperature range 30–250 C corresponding to the release of three water molecules. Above 250 C, 3 lost weight continuously, another water molecule breaks free and the whole framework begins to collapse. Conclusions In summary, we present here three interesting I1O3 Ln-TM coordination polymers based on nano-sized Ln-O-Ln inorganic rods and in situ produced 3-hydroxy-pyrazine-2-carboxylate ligand. The successful preparation of the three coordination polymers not only carries out the possibility of incorporating nanorods into metal–organic frameworks, but also provides valuable information on the design and synthesis of novel hybrid organic–inorganic materials.

Figure S9 XPRD patterns of 3: (black) measured at room temperature; (red) heated to 250 oC for 20min; (blue) heated to 360 oC for 20min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The diffraction peaks on 250 oC corresponded well to the pattern at room temperature in position, indicating the framework of 3 is stable before 250 ºC when the partly coordination water molecules were removed from the structure. However, the diffraction peaks on 360 ºC reveal the collapse of the whole framework.
