In 1, the trinuclear triangular [Cu3(m3-OH)(m2-O)(dmtrz)2] cluster connects itself infinitely, resulting in the type-II channel structure, which is different from that of the rigid type-I channel structure reported previously. Reversible dehydration and rehydration induced crystal- to-amorphous-like phase transformation for structure 1 has been observed and confirmed by PXRD patterns and gas adsorption. Furthermore, as a response to the structural transformation, the stimuli- induced modulation of magnetic properties have been observed. Introduction Porous materials with stimuli-induced reversible structural changes as well as the modulation of their physical properties are highly desirable. Porous coordination polymers (PCPs, or metal–organic frameworks, MOFs) have shown intrinsic structural flexibility, exhibiting reversible structural transfor- mation triggered by guests, temperatures and so on.1 They are considered to be expected to show external stimuli-induced modulation of physical properties such as optical and magnetic responses.2,3 Metal–azolate frameworks (MAFs) are a class of coordina- tion polymers constructed by the linkers of aromatic nitrogen heterocycles.4 As a type of five-membered nitrogen heterocycle, 1H,1,2,4-triazole (Htrz) and its derivatives combine the coordination geometries of both imidazole and pyrazole.5 Thus, they can coordinate to metal ions in the unique m1,2,4- cordination mode, generating not only triazolate-based multi- nuclear clusters such as dinuclear,6 triangular trinuclear,7 tetranuclear clusters,8 but also triazolate–carboxylate shared multinuclear clusters such as m4-oxo tetrametal and paddle- wheel clusters.9 Consequently, various three-dimensional porous structures, showing pcu, nbo, crs, pts, etc. topologies, have been reported,10 and dynamic structural transformations were also observed.11 In addition, because these p-electron conjugated ligands are directly coordinated to metal ions with nitrogen donors, they can serve as a kind of valid super- exchange pathway and/or capacity for electrons, which endues these structures with interesting photoluminescent6a,8a,10d,12 and magnetic properties.11b,c,13 Herein, a novel flexible three-dimensional (3D) porous structure, namely [Cu3(m3-OH)(m2-O)(dmtrz)2(HCOO)(m2- H2O)(H2O)3]?H2O (1, Hdmtrz = 3,5-dimethyl-1H,1,2,4-triazole) has been in situ solvothermally synthesized. The trinuclear triangular [Cu3(m3-OH)(m2-O)(dmtrz)2] cluster ([Cu3O] SBU for short) was observed in 1. Self-propagation of these clusters generates the 3D structure with a 1D channel along the c axis. Reversible dehydration and rehydration induced crystal-to- amorphous-like phase transformation plus visible colour change for 1 have been observed and confirmed by PXRD patterns and gas adsorption. The magnetic response to the reversible structural change has been observed. Experimental section Materials and general characterization All of the chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and were used without further purification, except for 3,5- dimethyl-1H,1,2,4-triazole (Hdmtrz) ligand, which was synthe- sized according to previous literature.12 IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 470 FT-IR spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm21 with KBr pellets.

Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a TGA/SDTA 851 in the temperature range of 30–800 uC under N2 flow with a heating rate of 10 uC min21. High pressure CO2 adsorption (20 bar) was measured on IGA (Hiden) at 273 K. Before gas adsorption, the as-made sample was degassed at 50 uC for 8 h. Magnetic measurement was carried out on a MPMS (SQUID) VSM magnetometer equipped with a 7 T magnet. The variable-temperature (2–300 K) magnetic susceptibility was measured with an external magnetic field of 1000 Oe. The magnetization isotherm was collected at 2 K between 27 and 7 T. Samples were restrained in eicosane to prevent torquing. Pascal’s constants were used to estimate the diamagnetic corrections, which were subtracted from the experimental susceptibilities to give the molar paramagnetic susceptibilities (xm). Synthesis of [Cu3(m3-OH)(m2-O)(dmtrz)2(HCOO)(m2-H2O)(H2O)3]? H2O (1). Cu(NO3)2?6H2O (0.3 mmol, 0.088 g) and Hdmtrz (0.2 mmol, 0.019 g) were dissolved in 12 mL mixed solution of N,N9-dimethylformamide (DMF)–H2O–CH3CH2OH (1 : 1 : 1). The blue solution was then stirred at room temperature for another 30 min. Then the mixture was transferred into 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, sealed and heated at 60 uC for 3 days under autogenous pressure. The resulting block blue crystals of 1 were collected by filtration, washed with acetone three times, and dried in air (yield: 68% based on Cu(II)).

Crystal data collection and refinement Data collection for 1 and 2 was carried out on a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo Ka radiation (l = 0.71073 Å) at 173 K. Data reduction was performed with SAINT, and empirical absorption corrections were applied by SADABS program. Structures were solved by direct method using the SHELXS program and refined with the SHELXL program.14 Heavy atoms and other non-hydrogen atoms were directly obtained from difference Fourier map. Final refinements were performed by full-matrix least-squares methods with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non- hydrogen atoms on F2. C-bonded H atoms were placed geometrically and refined as riding modes. H atoms of coordinated hydroxyl groups and lattice water were positioned from difference Fourier maps and then refined with the rigid mode. The water molecules and the dimethylamine are disordered, and hydrogen atoms of dimethylamine were hardly placed. The molecular formula of 1 and 2 are determined according the single crystal X-ray diffraction data. Crystallographic data are given in Table 1 and selected bond length and angles are listed in Table S1, ESI.3 Results and discussion Synthesis and characterization [Cu3(m3-OH)(m2-O)(dmtrz)2(HCOO)(m2-H2O)(H2O)3]?H2O (1) was low-temperature solvothermally synthesized in the mixed solution of N,N9-dimethylformamide (DMF)–water–ethanol, and can lose its crystalline form after leaving the mother liquid, so the single-crystal X-ray diffraction was performed at 173 K. It was found by both single-crystal X-ray diffraction and IR spectra results that structure 1 contains the HCOO2 group, which wasn’t included in the starting reactant. We ascribed the generation of this group to the decomposition of DMF, which frequently occurred under solvothermal reaction.15 To confirm this, DMF was excluded from the mixed solution. Clear blue solution was obtained following the same proce- dure. No identifiable carboxylate group adsorption was observed in the IR spectra after evacuating the solvents (Fig. S1, ESI3). Then, N,N9-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) was used as solvent to replace DMF. Blue crystal product of 2 was obtained and the PXRD pattern of 2 is similar to that of 1 (Fig. S2, ESI3). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction results show the presence of CH3COO2 groups in structure 2. These results further proved that DMF and DMAC can in situ be decomposed to HCOO2 and CH3COO2 groups respectively, which act as the coordi- nated ligand together with the triazole ligand. It is necessary to note that if the NaOAc or NaHCOO was used as the source of carboxylates without DMAC or DMF, an unknown phase was isolated (Fig. S3, ESI3). Based on the above studies, it suggests that structure 1 can only be in situ solvothermally generated under the presence of DMF at 60 uC. Crystal structure description Single crystal structural analysis reveals that 1 features a 3D porous structure constructed by the trinuclear triangular unit of [Cu3(m3-OH)(m2-O)(dmtrz)2] ([Cu3O] SBU, Fig. 1a).

Published on 26 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE00070B View Article Online centered O(1) is located above the [Cu3O] plane in a certain distance of ca. 0.79(3) Å (Fig. 1c), suggesting that it is a hydroxyl group.13a The distances of Cu(1)–O(1) and Cu(2)–O(1) are 1.970(9) and 1.999(6) Å respectively. Two edges of the [Cu3O] isosceles triangle are bridged by two dmtrz ligands in m1,2-mode with the Cu(1)–N(1), Cu(2)–N(2) and Cu(1)…Cu(2) distance of ca. 1.998(8), 1.948(8) and 3.27(3) Å, respectively. The bottom edge is bridged by the m2-O (O(2)) with the Cu(2)– O(2) and Cu(2)…Cu(2A) distance of ca. 1.948(8) and 2.85(2) Å, respectively. The in situ generated HCOO2 group coordinates to Cu(1) as a terminal group with the Cu(1)–O(3) distance of 1.961(11) Å. The apex position of Cu(1) in the tetragonal pyramid is occupied by water molecular O(5) with the Cu(1)– O(5) bond distance of 2.283(8) Å (Fig. S4, ESI3). The Cu(2) locates in a distorted octahedral geometry with two coordi- nated water molecules (O(6) and O(7)) occupying the axial position (Fig. S4, ESI3). The Cu(2)–O(5) and Cu(2)–O(7) bond distances are 2.495(17) and 2.595(11) Å, respectively. The relatively longer Cu–O bond distances indicate that the water molecules are weakly coordinated to the Cu(II) ions. The [Cu3O] SBU then propagates itself infinitely via Cu(2)–N(3) (bond distance of 1.980(12) Å) coordinative bonds, generating the 3D structure with 1D channels along the c axis (Fig. 1c). The pore size is calculated to be ca. 6.9 Å (taking van der Waals radii in to consideration) and the solvent-accessible volume is estimated to be ca. 46.2% by the PLATON program after theoretical removal of the guest molecules. Considering the [Cu3O] SBU as a 4-connected node, structure 1 can be described as a [64.82] topology, which belongs to the NbO net (Fig. 1f). Structure 2 is an isoreticular framework of 1 according to the single crystal X-ray diffraction results. It is interesting to note the channel structure of 1 constructed from [Cu3O] SBUs. If a channel structure can be conceptualized by wrapping up an ideal 2D layer structure into a cylinder, the type of channel is therefore determined by the way it is wrapped up.16,17 This has been well illustrated by single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), which can be divided into three different types based on the way they wrapped up from the graphene.18 However, different types of channel structures wrapped up from the same conceptualized 2D layer are rarely observed in porous coordination polymers.16 In the case of conceptualized 2D layer of [Cu3O] SBUs (Fig. 2a), the type-I channel will be generated if rolling it up along the y direction with the bottom edge of the isosceles triangle along the tube axis (Fig. 2b). This kind of channel structure has been previously observed in a 3D structure of {[Cu3(m3-O)(m2- OH)(tz)2]3(m3-Cl)2(m3-H2CA)}?8.5H2O,7b in which the type-I channel is further connected to the six neighboring channels by 3-topic auxiliary ligands of cyanuric acid. In contrast, the channel structure in 1 can be viewed as rolling up along the x direction (Fig. 2c), resulting in a type-II channel structure with the bottom edge of the isosceles triangle perpendicular to the tube axis. This channel structure is further connected to the neighboring six channels by partial wall sharing (Fig. 2d). Based on the above structural analyses, the differences in their channel types might be raised from the differences in (i) auxiliary ligands, which is 3-topic cyanuric acid ligand for {[Cu3(m3-O)(m2-OH)(tz)2]3(m3-Cl)2(m3-H2CA)}?8.5H2O and term- inal carboxylate ligand for structure 1; and (ii) in triazolate ligands, which is 1,2,4-triazolate for the former and 3,5- dimethyl-1,2,4-triazolate for structure 1. Structural transformation and magnetic properties Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was then performed to investigate the thermal stability of 1 (Fig. S5, ESI3). As 1 can partially release water molecules in air, it shows about a 10% weight loss from room temperature to ca. 200 uC, which can be ascribed to the loss of water molecules. With the increase of Fig. 1 (a) The [Cu3(m3-OH)(m2-O)(dmtrz)2(HCOO)] motif (symmetry code: A: 1 2 y, 1 2 x, z; B: 2/3 2 y, 1/3 + x 2 y, 1/3 + z); (b) six [Cu3O] SBUs generate the ring via Cu(2)–N(3) coordination bonds; (c) the m3-O(1) located above [Cu3] plane; (d) reducing the [Cu3O] SBU as a 4-connected node; (e) the 3D structure of 1 showing 1D channels along c axis (guest water molecules are omitted for clarity); (f) the NbO ([64.82] topology) net after reducing the [Cu3O] SBU as a simple 4-connected node.

Published on 26 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE00070B View Article Online temperature, a great weight loss was observed, suggesting the decomposition of its framework. The temperature-dependent PXRD patterns (Fig. S6, ESI3) from room temperature to 200 uC reveal that with the loss of water molecules, the main diffraction peak at ca. 7.08u gradually turns weak and finally disappears. At 180 uC, only two weak diffraction peaks at 9.13u and 11.67u remain, indicating an amorphous-like phase. During this process, the color of the sample synchronously changed from blue to dark green (Fig. S6, ESI3). In addition, the peak at 7.08u also disappeared under vacuum conditions at 50 uC for several hours, resulting in a PXRD pattern the same as that at 180 uC. The diffraction peak at 7.08u corresponds to the reflection of (2, 21, 0) plane perpendicular to the channel (Fig. S7, ESI3). Therefore, the disappearance of this peak suggests the periodic arrangement of the channels disordered after dehydration.2g Remarkably, the dehydrated sample (degassed at 50 uC for 8 h) can recover its crystal phase on being immersed to water solution, which was confirmed by PXRD patterns (Fig. 3). Therefore, the structure of 1 based on type-II channels can be regarded as a structurally bistable framework showing a reversible dehydration and rehydration induced phase trans- formation plus an observable colour change. This structural property is greatly different from that of {[Cu3(m3-O)(m2- OH)(tz)2]3(m3-Cl)2(m3-H2CA)}?8.5H2O based on type-I channels, which has no observable structural transformation to the increase of temperature as well as the loss of guest water molecules. The surface area of the as-made samples is firstly theoretically calculated based on its crystal structure after removing of water molecules.19 The accessible surface area is about 539 m2 g21 calculated with the probe atomic radii of 1.84 Å (Fig. S8, ESI3) and the pore size is measured to be ca. 6.9 Å. Gas adsorption was then conducted to assess the surface area and pore size. After activation, N2 adsorption at 77 K was firstly carried out using ASAP 2020. However, there was no detectable adsorption. Then, high pressure CO2 adsorption was measured at 273 K.20 Based on the adsorption data, the BET (Langmuir) surface area was calculated to be ca. 105 m2 g21 (147 m2 g21) (Fig. S9, ESI3), which is lower than the theoretical surface area of 1. The pore size distribution calculated by nonlinear density functional theory (NLDFT) shows that the pore sizes are around 3.6, 5.7 Å and 8.2 Å (Fig. S9, ESI3). The presence of small pore size (3.6 Å) may greatly block the diffusion of N2 in 1, as its diameter is larger than the pore size. The gas adsorption results further confirm the disorder of channel structure after dehydration. Triangular trinuclear copper(II)–triazolate unit centered with m3-O or m3-OH has been documented as a strong antiferro- magnetic (AF) component.13 The magnetic susceptibilities of as-made, dehydrated and rehydrated samples were then measured in the temperature range of 2 to 300 K under an applied magnetic field of 1 kOe (Fig. 4). The xm value of 1 gradually increases from 0.0022 (300 K) to 0.0076 cm3 mol21 upon cooling to 4 K and then decreases to 0.0068 cm3 mol21 at 2 K. The Curie–Weiss constants of C and h are calculated to be 1.4 cm3 K mol21 and 2335.3 K respectively based on the xm 21 vs. T plot above 120 K (Fig. S10, ESI3). The negative Weiss constant of h = 2335.3 K indicates strong antiferromagnetic coupling between Cu(II) ions.

Published on 26 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE00070B View Article Online suggests the onset of long-range AF ordering.21 This was also confirmed by the field-dependent magnetization curve at 2 K, which increases linearly in the whole field range and reaches to 0.079 Nb (far from the saturated value) at 70 kOe. As for dehydrated sample, the xm value gradually increases upon cooling down to 25 K, which is similar to that of the as-made sample. Below 25 K, the xm increases quickly and reaches to 0.027 cm3 mol21 at 2 K, which is greatly different from that of the as-made sample. The xm 21 vs. T plot is described by a Curie–Weiss law above 120 K, giving C = 0.9 cm3 K mol21 and h = 2203.5 K (Fig. S10, ESI3). The lower |h| for dehydrated samples compared with that of as-made sample suggests the decrease of AF interactions between Cu(II) after dehydration. This is further confirmed by the magnetization curve of the dehydrated sample. As shown in Fig. 4b, it increases linearly up to 20 kOe and slowly tends to saturation with the value of 0.176 Nb at 70 kOe, suggesting the disappearance of the long- range AF ordering after dehydration, giving a paramagnetic phase. These results indicate that magnetic coupling domain may be moderately fragmented due to the structural transfor- mation after dehydration. Conclusion In this paper, a novel three-dimensional porous structure of [Cu3(m3-OH)(m2-O)(dmtrz)2(HCOO)(m2-H2O)(H2O)3]?H2O (1) has been in situ solvothermally synthesized, in which the type-II channel structure constructed by trinuclear triangular [Cu3(m3- OH)(m2-O)(dmtrz)2] clusters was observed for the first time. Different from the rigid type-I channel structure based on similar trinuclear triangular clusters, reversible dehydration and rehydration induced crystal-to-amorphous-like phase transformation for structure 1 has been observed and confirmed by PXRD patterns and gas adsorption results. As a response to reversible structural transformation, the magnetic properties for the as-made, dehydrated and rehydrated samples have been studied. Our results show an example to explore the interlocked stimuli-induced structural and proper- ties conversion in metal–organic frameworks via slightly modification the ligands and/or adjusting the auxiliary ligands.
