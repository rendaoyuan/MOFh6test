Turner1* The synthesis and structural, magnetic and gas adsorption properties of a series of coordination polymer materials prepared from a new, highly flexible and internally functional tetrakis-carboxybenzyl ligand H4L derived from 1,2-diaminoethane have been examined. The compound poly- [Ni3(HL)2(OH2)4]·2DMF·2H2O 1, a two-dimensional coordination polymer, contains aqua- and carboxylato-bridged trinuclear NiII clusters, the magnetic behaviour of which can be well described through experimental fitting and ab initio modelling to a ferromagnetically coupled trimer with a positive axial zero-field splitting parameter D. Compound poly-[Zn2L]·2DMF·3H2O 2, a three- dimensional coordination polymer displaying frl topology, contains large and well-defined solvent channels, which are shown to collapse on solvent exchange or drying. Compound poly-[Zn2(L)(DMSO)4- ]·3DMSO·3H2O 3, a highly solvated two-dimensional coordination polymer, displayed poor stability characteristics, however a structurally related material poly-[Zn2(L)(bpe)(DMSO)2]·DMSO·3H2O 4 was prepared under similar synthetic conditions by including the 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene bpe co-ligand. Compound 4, containing small one-dimensional solvent channels, shows excellent structural resilience to solvent exchange and evacuation, and the evacuated material displays selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 at 273K in the pressure range 0 – 1 atm. Each of the coordination polymers displays subtle differences in the conformation and binding mode of the ligand species, with switching between two distinct conformers (X-shaped and H-shaped), as well as a variable protonation state of the central core, with significant effects on the resulting network structures and physical properties of the materials. Introduction In recent years, interest in coordination polymer materials, and their porous sub-group Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs),1 has expanded beyond the synthesis of materials as scientific curiosities, and is evolving towards a wide variety of potential real-world applications.2 The properties of polymeric metallosupramolecular assemblies have been probed to determine their feasibility for applications such as gas storage and separation, molecular magnetism-based memory applications, degradation of chemical warfare agents, small molecule separation and detection, heterogeneous catalysis and non-linear optics.3 A common facet amongst any foreseeable technical applications of coordination polymer materials, and one reason for the intense interest directed towards the field, is the notion of chemical customisability.4 The ability to continuously tune the chemical functionality and nanoscale geometric properties of coordination polymer materials, both porous and non-porous, represents an unprecedented advance in materials science.5 These properties make MOFs particularly attractive in the field of carbon dioxide capture, an area of great environmental importance.6 Recently, substantial advances have been reported in the use of amine-containing frameworks for highly selective and efficient carbon dioxide capture from mixed gas streams, and substantial interest remains in the synthesis of amine-derived porous coordination polymers.7 To date, the majority of porous coordination polymers reported have been derived from rigid and symmetrical ligand molecules, typically consisting of an aromatic core with carboxylate or other donor groups attached.8 This design is most often chosen due to the propensity for rigid aromatic linkers, often in combination with secondary-building units, to form robust porous materials whose framework integrity is maintained on solvent exchange and evacuation.9 Flexible linkers are more commonly associated with either close packed structures (based on the ability of flexible ligands to distort to Page 1 of 17 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 17 July 2015.

Experimental Materials and Methods All reagents, solvents and starting materials were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, Alfa-Aesar or Merck and were used as received. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C nuclei, with all samples dissolved in deuterated solvents as specified and signals referenced to the residual non-deuterated solvent peak. Melting points were recorded in air on an Electrothermal melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Mass spectrometry was carried out using a Micromass Platform II ESI-MS instrument operated in positive and negative ionisation mode. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out with a Mettler-Toledo STARe TGA/DSC instrument with samples in aluminium crucibles of 40 µL capacity heated from 30 – 400 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min under a nitrogen purge flow of 20 mL/min. Microanalysis was performed by Campbell Microanalytical Laboratory, University of Otago, New Zealand. Infrared spectra were obtained using an Agilent Cary 630 spectrometer equipped with an Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) sampler. Bulk phase purity of all crystalline materials was confirmed with X-ray powder diffraction patterns recorded with a Bruker X8 Focus powder diffractometer operating at Cu Kα wavelength (1.5418 Å), with samples mounted on a zero- background silicon single crystal stage. Scans were performed at room temperature in the 2θ range 5 – 55° and compared with predicted patterns based on single crystal data (ESI†). Gas adsorption analyses were carried out using a Micromeritics TriStar 3020 volumetric analyser, with samples prepared by evacuating under dynamic vacuum overnight at the temperatures specified, using a Micromeritics Vacprep 061 station. Ultra high purity gasses were used for all analyses. Temperature control was achieved using insulated ice water (273 K) or liquid nitrogen (77 K) baths, or a temperature controlled water recirculator (302 K). Enthalpy of adsorption calculations were performed by fitting a Virial-type equation to the adsorption data at two temperatures (Supporting Information). Magnetic susceptibility measurements were made using a Quantum Design MPMS 7 Squid magnetometer. The accurately weighed (~20 mg) sample of the nickel(II) compound, 1, was contained in a gel capsule that was held at the centre of a drinking straw, the latter fixed to the end of the sample rod. Fields of 1T and 0.1 T were used. The instrument was calibrated by use of an accurately known pellet of palladium supplied by Quantum Design. Magnetization measurements were between 2 – 20 K in fields of between 0 – 5 T. Ab initio Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) calculations for 1 were performed using MOLCAS 8.0.13 The X-Ray structure was used without optimization and each crystallographically independent Ni site was treated separately to extract the local electronic properties, where the Ni ions not of interest were substituted with the diamagnetic Zn(II). An active space of 8 electrons in 5 3d orbitals was employed, where all 10 triplets and 15 singlets were used for both the RASSCF orbital optimization and the RASSI spin- orbit mixing procedures. Basis sets from the ANO-RCC library were employed exclusively,14 with VTZP quality for the Ni ion, VDZP quality for the first coordination sphere (including H atoms of bound water molecules) and VDZ quality for all other atoms. The two electron integrals were Cholesky decomposed. The SINGLE_ANISO routine was used to extract the Zero- Field Splitting (ZFS) parameters of the S = 1 ground state for each Ni(II) ion.15 Synthesis of N,N,Nʹ,Nʹ-tetrakis(methyl 4- carboxyphenylmethylene)-ethane-1,2-diamine Me4L To a mixture of ethane-1,2-diamine (270 mg, 4.5 mmol) and potassium carbonate (3.0 g, 23 mmol) in 150 mL of acetonitrile was added methyl 4-bromomethylbenzoate (4.3 g, 19 mmol) in one portion. The mixture was heated at reflux with stirring overnight. On cooling to room temperature, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate concentrated to ca. 10 mL under reduced pressure. The white solids which precipitated during this process were filtered and washed with a small amount of cold acetonitrile.

Phase purity was confirmed by X- ray powder diffraction. X-ray Crystallography Refinement and structural information is presented in Table 1. All datasets were collected on the MX1 (H4L, 1, 4) or MX2 (2, 3) beamlines at the Australian Synchrotron, Victoria, Australia,16 operating at 17.4 keV (λ = 0.7109 Å) with data collections conducted using BluIce control software.17 The diffraction data were reduced, processed and multi-scan absorption corrections carried out using the XDS software suite,18 and anomalous dispersion corrections for the non- standard wavelength were made in the final refinement using Brennan and Cowan data.19 All datasets were solved using direct methods with SHELXS20 and refined on F2 using all data by full matrix least-squares procedures with SHELXL-201421 within the OLEX-2 GUI.22 Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters, while most hydrogen atoms were included in calculated positions with isotropic displacement parameters either 1.2 or 1.5 times the isotropic equivalent of their carrier atoms. Where appropriate, hydrogen atoms involved in hydrogen bonding interactions were located on the basis of Fourier residuals, and appropriate distance restraints and Uiso dependencies were applied. In the case of compounds 2, 3 and 4, significant regions of disordered electron density were detected in the residual Fourier difference map after the refinement of all framework atoms. Lattice solvent molecules were modelled to these sites wherever possible, and the remainder of the diffuse solvent regions to which lattice solvent could not be reasonably modelled were accounted for with the SQUEEZE routine within PLATON,23 to provide meaningful refinement statistics Page 3 of 17 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 17 July 2015.

In these cases, the lattice solvation was estimated for the bulk materials by a combination of thermogravimetric analysis and microanalysis. Due to the well- known propensity for rapid lattice solvent exchange in MOFs,24 and the difficulty of ascertaining the precise solvation levels of the as-diffracted single crystals, the lattice solvent detected by these bulk-phase methods have not been included in the crystallographic formulae; as such, the given values of F000, density and absorption coefficients have been calculated from the crystallographically modelled atoms only.

Reagents and conditions: (i) methyl 4-bromomethyl benzoate, K2CO3, MeCN, reflux; (ii) KOH, THF/H2O, reflux; (iii) DMF/H2O, 100 °C. Results and Discussion Structure of H4L The ligand H4L was prepared by the reaction of methyl 4- bromomethylbenzoate with ethane-1,2-diamine and hydrolysis of the resulting tetra-ester precursor Me4L (Scheme 1). The white solid obtained on precipitation with hydrochloric acid was purified to the neutral anhydrous form H4L by recrystallization from a 1:1 DMF:H2O mixture. The crystals of H4L obtained by this method were of sufficient quality to allow analysis by single crystal X-ray diffraction, where a structure model was obtained in the triclinic space group P-1. The asymmetric unit of H4L contains the molecule in its entirety, and is devoid of any inorganic species or solvent molecules. The molecule adopts an H-shaped conformation, where the two benzoate arms attached to each nitrogen atom adopt divergent orientations (Figure 1). The shortest carbon···carbon distances of 3.436(2) and 3.492(2) Å between aromatic rings originating from the two unique nitrogen atoms indicates some degree of intramolecular π-π interaction accompanying the tweezer-like orientation of the two sets of aromatic rings. Fig. 1 Structure of H4L with heteroatom labelling scheme. Carbon-bound hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Intermolecular interactions within the structure of H4L primarily consist of hydrogen bonds originating from the carboxylic acid groups. Despite the basicity of the two tertiary nitrogen atoms within the molecule, all four carboxylic acid groups exist in their protonated states, and each engages in an R (6) carboxylic acid dimer-type interaction with a symmetry related molecule.25 Two such interactions exist between each pair of H4L molecules, with the result that the extended structure of H4L takes the form of an undulating one- dimensional chain with four prominent hydrogen bonds (all D- A distances in the range 2.593(2) – 2.661(2) Å) between each pair of molecules, as shown in Figure 2. Presumably as a result of these interactions in the solid state, the crystals of H4L displayed a melting point in excess of 300 °C and poor solubility under ambient conditions. Only modest π-π interactions are observed between chains of H4L, while the polar tertiary amine sites do not experience any significant intermolecular interactions, most likely by virtue of the steric hindrance provided by the ortho-hydrogen atoms from the attached phenyl rings and the lack of any unbound strong hydrogen bond donors.

Hydrogen atoms not involved in hydrogen bonding are omitted for clarity. Page 4 of 17 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 17 July 2015.

Name., 2012, 00, 1-3 | 5 Structure of poly-[Ni3(HL)2(OH2)4]·2DMF·2H2O 1 The reaction of H4L with nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate in a DMF:H2O mixture gave green crystals of compound 1 within two days, mediated by the slow dissolution and reaction of H4L. Analysis by X-ray diffraction provided a structure model in the triclinic space group P-1. The asymmetric unit contains one complete molecule of HL, protonated on one nitrogen atom and with all four carboxylate groups deprotonated, as well as two unique nickel sites (1.5 Ni ions per asymmetric unit), one residing on a crystallographic inversion centre, with two associated aqua ligands. One lattice water molecule and one DMF molecule were also located within the asymmetric unit. Examination of the metal ion environments in 1 reveals a trinuclear cluster in which the central octahedrally coordinated nickel(II) ion is linked to the two crystallographically equivalent outer nickel ions by two µ2-bridging aqua ligands and four µ2-κO:κOʹ carboxylate groups, with a Ni···Ni distance of 3.5234(8) Å. The octahedral coordination sphere of each outer nickel ion is completed by one terminal aqua ligand and two terminal monodentate carboxylate ligands, giving an overall cluster composition of [Ni3(COO)8(OH2)4]2-. The negative charge of these clusters is balanced by the protonation of one amine group per ligand molecule. The HL molecule within 1 adopts a conformation similar to that seen in the neutral form H4L, with pivoting of each benzoate group to allow for coordination to four different trinuclear clusters. The cluster connectivity and ligand geometry of 1 is shown in Figure 3. Fig. 3 The ligand geometry and labelling scheme (Top) and connectivity of the trinuclear nickel cluster (bottom) within the structure of 1. Selected hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Hydrogen bonds are represented as green dashed lines. Symmetry codes used to generate equivalent atoms: (i) –x, 1-y, -z; (ii) –x, - y, 1+z; (iii) +x, -1+y, 1+z. The extended structure of 1 is a high connectivity two- dimensional sheet in which each Ni3 cluster coordinates to eight different molecules of HL and each ligand molecule bridges four clusters (Figure 4). The metal clusters within each sheet align into chains parallel to the a axis by virtue of R (6) hydrogen bonding interactions between the terminal aqua ligands and coordinating carboxylate oxygen atoms, bringing terminal nickel ions from adjacent clusters together to a distance of 4.956(2) Å , as shown in Figure 4. The HL molecules which bridge these clusters into the extended sheet structure adopt a slightly bowed geometry, giving a maximum thickness of ca 12 Å to the sheets. The lattice DMF molecules reside within the small cavities created by the curved shape of the ligand molecules and are supported by an N-H···O hydrogen bond originating from the protonated nitrogen atom of HL. The remaining hydrogen bonding interactions within the structure consist of intra-cluster S(6) rings between the µ2 aqua ligands and non-coordinating oxygen atoms O35 and O46 from the carboxylate groups associated with the terminal nickel ions. The lattice water molecule also acts as a hydrogen bond donor to the carboxylate oxygen atoms O5 and O23 bound to the central nickel ion. Adjacent layers stack in an ABAB fashion supported by multiple offset face-to-face π-π interactions between the HL units.

Hydrogen atoms and lattice solvent molecules are omitted for clarity. Magnetic behaviour of poly-[Ni3(HL)2(OH2)4]·2DMF·2H2O 1 The plot of χMT, per Ni3, versus temperature for 1 is shown in Figure 5. Between 300 and ~ 60 K, χMT remains constant at 3.85 cm3 mol-1 K (1.28 cm3 mol-1 K; µeff = 3.20 µB, per Ni). The χMT value then increases with decreasing temperature in a field, B, of 1 T, to reach a maximum of 4.61 cm3 mol-1 K at 4.5 K, typical of ferromagnetic coupling, then rapidly decreases to reach 3.90 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K. In a field of 0.1 T, below ~10 K, the χMT values increase to reach 5.2 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K, this field dependent behaviour being due to Zeeman depopulation effects. Long range magnetic ordering could be ruled out since the FC and ZFC susceptibilities were identical between 2 - 60 K (Fig S1, ESI). The isothermal magnetisation plots in fields of 0 – 5 T over the range 2 – 20 K, shown in Figure 5, reach M = 6.20 NµB at 2 K and 5 T without reaching saturation. This is indicative of a S = 3 coupled ground state with a g value slightly larger than 2. Corresponding reduced magnetisation plots of M vs. B/T (Fig 5, Inset) are not superimposable on account of zero-field splitting (ZFS) effects. Assuming isolated trinuclear units, the susceptibility and magnetisation data were fitted simultaneously, using PHI,26 to the spin Hamiltonian:    2 ∙    ∙               3 ⁄    3 ⁄    3 ⁄   E                          ∙ where  1 , the coupling between terminal NiII atoms is assumed to be negligible, both D and g are the same for all Ni ions and E is fixed at zero. Good fits of the χMT and M vs. B data were obtained for the axial ZFS parameter D being positive or negative, with the negative D fit being marginally favoured in the high temperature χMT region, but this may be indicative that the diamagnetic corrections are not perfect (Figure S2, ESI). The two parameter sets are: g = 2.20, D = +3.26 cm-1, J = +0.842 cm-1 and g = 2.24, D = -4.56 cm-1, J = +0.674 cm-1. Other more complex parameterizations failed to provide any improved agreement with the experimental data.

Comparison of the J value for the Ni(µ2-OH2)(µ2-RCO2)2Ni pathways to those in other such systems showed that a member of a dinuclear family,27 [Ni2(µ2-OH2)(µ2- O2CtBu)2(O2CtBu)2(HO2CtBu)2(3-CH3C5H4N)2], yielded g = 2.26 , J = 0.55 – 0.85 cm-1, D = 5.4 cm-1 (E = 1.4 cm-1), the single-ion ZFS parameters being obtained from high field EPR studies using doped Ni/Mg compounds. The sign of D could not be determined from magnetic studies alone in reference 27, as was also the case here, but EPR and ab initio calculations showed that D was positive in this family of dinuclear analogues, some of which had antiferromagnetic exchange coupling. Furthermore, correlations were made between the size of D and the presence of a well-defined axis along the nitrogen atom in the NiNO5 coordination sphere of the above compound (N from CH3C5H4N). Compound 1 has a NiO6 coordination sphere with a labile aqua ligand O48, at a Ni-O distance of 2.087(2) Å. The Ni···Ni distance is 3.4760(7) Å, Page 6 of 17 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 17 July 2015. Downloaded by Harvard University on 22/07/2015 21:07:48.

The dinuclear study showed that the smaller the Ni-Ow-Ni angle the more likely is J to be positive. Interestingly, other linear trinuclear species have recently been reported with similar bridging units to those in 1 (also held within extended networks). These compounds display Ni- OW-Ni angles of 113.6 to 115.9°, with ferromagnetic coupling J values of 2.7 to 4.9 cm-1, however the ZFS was not included in the modelling of the magnetic data, concluding that a combination of the Ni-Ow-Ni and Ni(µ2-O2CR)2 bridges determined the sign of J.28 Ab initio Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) calculations on the present trinuclear compound (see Experimental section for details), reveal an S = 1 ground state for both Ni1 (central) and Ni2 (outer), as expected. Both sites are subject to a rhombic ZFS of the S = 1 state, where we find DNi1 = +6.74 cm-1, ENi1 = -1.79 cm-1, gNi1 = 2.31 and DNi2 = +2.82 cm-1, ENi2 = -0.44 cm-1, gNi2 = 2.33. Therefore, the average D and g values for the trinuclear compound are predicted to be Dav = +4.13 cm-1 and gav = 2.32. Given the simplicity of the spin-Hamiltonian employed to fit the magnetic data, the agreement on the order of magnitude of D is very good in this case. Based on the CASSCF prediction of a positive axial ZFS, we suggest that the fit with a positive D provides the most likely interpretation of the magnetic properties. Structure of poly-[Zn2L]·2DMF·3H2O 2 Reacting H4L with zinc acetate dihydrate in DMF at 95 °C for 24 hours gave small colourless crystals of compound 2, which were isolated and analysed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The structural model, in the triclinic space group P-1, revealed an asymmetric unit containing half of one molecule of L, with one full occupancy zinc ion. The zinc ion is coordinated by four monodentate carboxylate oxygen atoms (Figure 6). The arrangement of these donors is slightly distorted from the ideal tetrahedral arrangement towards a square planar orientation (τ4 = 0.7).29 Each carboxylate group from L bridges two zinc ions in a µ2-κO:κOʹ coordination mode, with the result that each molecule of L is bound to eight crystallographically equivalent zinc ions. The ligand backbone adopts a centrosymmetric X- shaped conformation distinct from that seen in the structures of H4L and compound 1, with no evidence of protonation on the amine nitrogen atoms. Fig. 6 (Top) Ligand geometry and unique heteroatom labelling scheme within the structure of compound 2. Hydrogen atoms and lattice solvent molecules are omitted for clarity. (Bottom) Structure of the zinc-carboxylate polymeric chain within compound 2. The bridging of zinc ions through the carboxylate groups of L leads to a three-dimensional polymeric structure, in which infinite chains of four-coordinate zinc ions, bridged by carboxylate groups, laying parallel to the a axis are linked in the b and c directions by four-connected L molecules. As such, the overall structure can best be described by the frl rod packing nomenclature.30 By virtue of the large spacing between the inorganic pillars imposed by the conformation of L, the structure of 2 contains rectangular one-dimensional channels parallel to the a axis. Two crystallographically unique channels are present (Figure 7), with shortest inter-atomic dimensions of ca. 11×8 and 8×8 Å, measured as the minimum carbon···carbon distance between opposing phenyl rings. Combined, the solvent accessible volume of the two channels accounts for 40 % of the unit cell volume, divided in a 3:2 ratio in favour of the larger channel.

Name., 2012, 00, 1-3 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Fig. 7 Extended structure of compound 2 viewed parallel to the solvent channels. Hydrogen atoms and lattice solvent molecules are omitted for clarity. Only the content of the larger channel could be unambiguously determined from the X-ray diffraction data, consisting of layers of two equivalent DMF molecules aligned face-to-face across the width of the channel. Although suffering from slight rotational disorder, these guest molecules are surprisingly well-ordered within a solvent channel of this size, most likely due to the specific interactions with the pore walls. The DMF molecules align with a mean-plane-to-mean-plane angle of 25° to the phenyl rings lining the edges of the channel, at a minimum (non-hydrogen atom) interatomic separation of 3.465(8) Å, and lie parallel to one another, with minimum interatomic (N···N) distance of 3.553(11) Å (Figure S3, ESI). Although lined by phenyl rings in a similar fashion, the smaller channel does not exhibit dimensions capable of tightly binding DMF guest molecules, and as such, the contents of the smaller channel could not be determined crystallographically due to extensive delocalisation of the guest molecules presumed to reside within. However, thermogravimetric analysis of 2 revealed a total volatile mass of 25%, which is consistent with the formula derived from microanalysis of poly- [Zn2L]·2DMF·3H2O (calculated volatile mass 22%). Structure of poly-[Zn2(L)(DMSO)4]·3DMSO·3H2O 3 The reaction of H4L with zinc acetate dihydrate in DMSO at 100 °C gave pale yellow crystals after 48 hours. Analysis of the crystals by single crystal X-ray diffraction gave a structural model in the monoclinic space group P21/n. Although the crystals displayed poor diffraction characteristics, data of sufficient quality were obtained using synchrotron radiation to allow unambiguous assignment of the framework structure and connectivity of the material. The asymmetric unit of 3 contains two zinc ions, halves of two unique L molecules, and four coordinating DMSO molecules, each of which displays crystallographic disorder over at least two orientations about the fixed, coordinating oxygen atoms. The two zinc ions are each coordinated by two carboxylate groups, one chelated and one monodentate, and two DMSO molecules, giving distorted square pyramidal, five- coordinate geometries (τ5 = 0.26 and 0.32 for Zn1 and Zn2, respectively). The coordination sphere of Zn1 displays slightly greater tendency towards additional chelation of the monodentate carboxylate, with a nonbonding Zn···O distance of 2.493(5) Å, compared with 2.761(7) Å for the equivalent distance in the Zn2 coordination sphere. Each molecule of L coordinates to four Zn ions, two of each Zn1 and Zn2. One molecule of L adopts an X-shaped conformation similar to that observed in 2, while the other adopts an H-shaped conformation similar to that observed in 1 and the structure of H4L (Figure 8). Both unique molecules of L are centrosymmetric, and overlap with inversion symmetry elements located within the central ethylene C-C bond.

Hydrogen atoms and disorder involving the coordinating DMSO molecules is omitted for clarity. The extended structure of 3 is a two-dimensional network in which the two 2-connected zinc ions each bridge the two different L conformers. Topologically, the network can be described by assigning four-connecting nodes to each ligand centroid and considering zinc ions as links, giving a (4,4) network oriented parallel to the crystallographic bc plane.

The larger adopts an elongated hexagonal shape, with parallel edges formed by the long edges of the H-shaped ligand conformer, and capped by the acute angle of the X-shaped ligand. The more compact of the two loops consists of a cross-shaped window enclosed by the smaller lateral edges of each of the two ligand types (Figure 9). Fig. 9 (Left) A two-dimensional sheet within the extended structure of compound 3, with two ligand conformers highlighted in blue and green. Hydrogen atoms and coordinating DMSO molecules are omitted for clarity. (Right) The one- dimensional solvent channels in compound 3 formed by offset stacking of adjacent sheets. Adjacent layers stack in an offset parallel fashion without interpenetration, restricting the size of the available void space from the large windows evident in each sheet to a series of one- dimensional channels parallel to the a axis, shown in Figure 9, which account for 22% of the unit cell volume. No strong intermolecular interactions are observed within the structure, with only weak edge-to-face C-H···π interactions and the interdigitation of disordered DMSO ligands serving to maintain the stacked layer structure. The contents of the solvent channels could not be unambiguously determined through crystallographic methods, due to intractable disorder of the resident solvent molecules. Thermogravimetric analysis showed a mass loss of approximately 30 % in the range 30 – 200 °C, followed by a gradual flattening of the mass loss curve and decomposition with onset of 350 °C. Microanalysis on an air- dried sample was consistent with a formulation of poly- [Zn2(L)(DMSO)4]·3DMSO·3H2O, providing a good match with the thermogravimetric analysis data (calculated volatile mass 28.4%). Structure of poly-[Zn2(L)(bpe)(DMSO)2]·DMSO·3H2O 4 The presence of coordinating solvent molecules within 3 raised the possibility of introducing a neutral bridging co-ligand as a ‘pillar’ to increase the structural stability. The synthesis of 3 was repeated in the presence of 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene bpe, producing small colourless crystals of compound 4. Analysis of these crystals by single crystal X-ray diffraction provided a structural model in the triclinic space group P-1. The asymmetric unit contains one zinc ion at full occupancy, half of one molecule of L and half of a bpe ligand, with one coordinating DMSO molecule. The zinc ion is coordinated in a four-coordinate, distorted trigonal pyramidal geometry (τ4 = 0.8) with an oxygen-bound DMSO molecule occupying the apical position at a Zn-O distance of 2.032(2) Å and the basal plane occupied by two non-equivalent carboxylate oxygen atoms (dZn-O 1.927(2) and 1.964(2) for O2 and O22, respectively) and one bpe pyridyl group, at Zn-N distance 2.013(2) Å. The zinc ion resides above the plane of the three basal donor atoms by 0.37 Å, while some interaction is observed with a second oxygen atom from one coordinating carboxylate group at a long Zn-O distance of 2.771(2) Å. Each molecule of L bridges four equivalent zinc centres, with each molecule of bpe connecting two zinc ions. The L molecule adopts a centrosymmetric H-shaped conformation similar to that observed in the structures of H4L, 1 and 3, with an interplanar angle of 71 ° between the mean planes of the phenyl groups attached to alternate nitrogen atoms, forming an edge-to-face C-H···π interaction with minimum C···H distance of 3.06 Å (C10···H19). Local coordination environments within compound 4 are shown in Figure 10. Fig. 10 Structural representation of compound 4 with partial atom labelling scheme. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Symmetry codes used to generate equivalent atoms: (i) 1-x, 2-y, 1-z. With each molecule of L bridging four zinc ions, and each zinc ion linked to three bridging ligands, the extended network of 4 takes the form of a binodal 3,4-connected two-dimensional sheet. The structure of each sheet is best envisaged as one- dimensional ladders of [Zn2(DMSO)2(L)], with alkyl amine rungs, which are then linked by bpe pillars. Each sheet contains large windows defined by the Zn-Zn distances of 13.350(4) Å from bridging bpe and 16.671(4) Å from lengthwise L linkages. Each L molecule also exhibits a short, cross-wise bridging distance of 6.724(2) Å. The extended network of 4 is shown in Figure 11. Adjacent networks align parallel to one another, and are offset to allow several π-π stacking interactions taking place between the bpe groups of one sheet and the L and bpe units in the vicinity of the metal environment of an adjacent sheet. The packing of the sheets in 4 leaves small, one-dimensional slit shaped channels parallel to the a axis, which take the shape of discrete rectangular voids within each sheet window, linked by narrower openings where the offset packing restricts the available space (Figure 11). The restricted segments of the channels display interatomic dimensions of approximately 5.5 × 10.5 Å, which expand to approximately 7.9 × 11.7 Å in the larger regions. The occupancy of these channels, comprising 15% of the unit cell volume, was determined by microanalysis Page 9 of 17 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 17 July 2015.

Thermogravimetric analysis, guest exchange and gas adsorption experiments The open framework structures of 2, 3 and 4 prompted an investigation into the possibility of evacuation and gas uptake in each of these materials. As the only network with three- dimensional connectivity, and the largest solvent-accessible volume, compound 2 was expected to display the most favourable properties. Thermogravimetric analysis of 2 showed the loss of the lattice solvent molecules (constituting 25% mass) by 100 °C, with a plateau region in the range 100 – 300 °C, followed by a broad decomposition process. A sample of freshly isolated 2 was evacuated at 100 °C under dynamic vacuum and tested for gas adsorption properties. Due to the microporous nature of the structure, carbon dioxide was chosen as the probe gas, owing to its small size, favourable polarizability and high saturation pressure at 273K. Only minimal gas uptake was observed under these conditions, well below that expected from the structural analysis (maximum uptake ~7.5 ccSTP/g at 1 atm). X-ray powder diffraction of the sample following the adsorption experiment revealed that a transition to a new, poorly crystalline phase had taken place. In order to provide a more easily accessible desolvated material, solvent exchange experiments were attempted on 2 using acetonitrile and methanol as exchange solvents. However, gas adsorption experiments showed that the solvent-exchanged samples all failed to adsorb the significant amounts of CO2 at 273K (Figure S4, ESI) that would be expected from a microporous material of this nature, instead reaching maximum CO2 uptakes of a similar order to the original material. Measurement of an N2 adsorption isotherm on a representative sample of acetonitrile-exchanged 2 after evacuating at 100 °C under dynamic vacuum revealed similarly poor gas uptake in the micropore region and a correspondingly low calculated BET surface area of approximately 7 m2/g, with greater uptake in the pressure range 0.85-0.99 p/p0 consistent with some degree of mesopore character associated with the small crystallites. X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the solvent- exchanged samples, either prior to or following evacuation and gas adsorption experiments, were each consistent with the poorly crystalline phase isolated from direct thermal desolvation of 2. Despite extensive efforts, we were unable to obtain single crystals of this phase of sufficient quality for structural analysis. The thermogravimetric analysis plot obtained from a sample of the vacuum-desolvated 2 after standing in air for 96 hours showed a minimal mass loss in the range 30 – 300 °C, consistent with only negligible re-adsorption of atmospheric water. Interestingly, the fresh material and the sample desolvated at 100 °C under high vacuum display a lower decomposition onset temperature of 300 °C, compared with the methanol and acetonitrile-exchanged materials, which undergo thermal decomposition with onset of approximately 350 °C. Comparison of the infrared spectra of the fresh and desolvated material shows loss of the infrared absorbances corresponding to the lattice water (3332 cm-1) and DMF molecules (1667 cm- 1), and shifts in the coordinating carboxylate absorbances in the range 1550-1650 cm-1, consistent with an altered coordination mode (Figure S5, ESI), while the remainder of the absorbances are retained. As such, it can be reasoned that the desolvated or solvent-exchanged forms of 2 consist of poorly ordered, close- packed structures arising from collapse of the solvent channels following desolvation. Thermogravimetric analysis of compound 3 revealed a broad mass loss profile, with 30 % mass lost in the range 100 – 200 °C. On heating to 200 °C in air, the crystals of compound 3 slowly decomposed into a viscous oil, suggesting that a direct thermal activation of this material is not feasible. Given the low dimensionality, lack of strong inter-layer interactions, and large degree of solvent coordination present in the structure of 3, the inaccessibility of a stable, permanently porous phase would not be necessarily surprising. Nonetheless, solvent exchange experiments were conducted using acetonitrile. Although the exchange solvent was successful in displacing the lattice solvent molecules, indicated by thermogravimetric analysis, similarly to 2 the material displayed only very low CO2 uptake upon desolvation at either room temperature or 100 °C under dynamic vacuum (Figure S6, ESI).

View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C5DT02323H Dalton Transactions This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 J. Name., 2012, 00, 1-3 | 11 analysis of the material after soaking in the exchange solvent revealed a complete loss of crystallinity, suggesting that the removal of the lattice DMSO molecules either thermally or by solvent exchange leads to framework destruction. Similarly to 3, thermogravimetric analysis of compound 4 showed a very broad mass loss initiating at approximately 100 °C and leading directly into a continual decomposition process with major inflection at 320 °C. The lack of any obvious plateau regions prior to decomposition necessitated a solvent exchange process in order to generate a stable desolvated structure. Thermogravimetric analysis of the acetonitrile- exchanged material (Figure S12, ESI) showed loss of the bulk of the exchange solvent at room temperature before the start of the experiment, and a delay of any further mass loss from 100 °C in the as-synthesised material to approximately 150 °C, from which point the decomposition profile closely matches that of the fresh material. This observation suggests that while the lattice solvent molecules are efficiently replaced by acetonitrile, the coordinating DMSO molecules are retained, and their thermal removal leads directly into the onset of decomposition. Use of methanol as the exchange solvent also failed to displace the coordinating DMSO molecules, which are localised within the framework backbone rather than protruding into the solvent channels, and as such would not be expected to be readily exchanged, nor to negatively influence the capacity for guest uptake within the primary channels. Carbon dioxide adsorption experiments on the acetonitrile- exchanged material after evacuation under dynamic vacuum at room temperature revealed a total uptake of 35 cm3(STP)/g at 273K at a pressure of 780 mmHg (Figure 12). Activating the solvent-exchanged material at 100 °C overnight under dynamic vacuum produced effectively identical results. Recording a further CO2 adsorption isotherm at 302K allowed the calculation of the enthalpy of adsorption for CO2 using a virial- type model,31 which provided a zero-loading value of ca -30 kJ.mol-1, decreasing only slightly across the measured loading range to a value of -28 kJ.mol-1 at the highest fitted loading of 1 mmol/g CO2 (Figure S8, ESI). Fig. 12 Gas adsorption isotherms for compound 4, showing CO2 uptake at 273 K and 302 K from a sample degassed at room temperature following solvent exchange with acetonitrile (blue and red, respectively). Shown in green is the 273 K CO2 adsorption isotherm for a sample evacuated at 373 K after solvent exchange, while in purple is shown the N2 adsorption isotherm from the solvent- exchanged, room-temperature evacuated material, measured at 273 K. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were also measured on the activated compound 4. At 273K, minimal uptake was observed across the pressure region 0 – 1 atm (Figure 12), while at 77K, unsurprisingly very low uptake was observed in the pressure range 0 – 0.9 p/p0, with a slight increase in the pressure range 0.9-0.99 p/p0 presumably due to some degree of inter-particle condensation up to a total measured loading of 5.5 cc(STP)/g. This selective adsorption behaviour can most likely be ascribed to the very small limiting diameter of the one-dimensional pores within 4, which prevents the less polar and larger (3.6 Å kinetic diameter, compared to 3.3 Å for CO2) N2 probe molecules from entering the channels in any significant sense on a measureable timescale.32 X-ray powder diffraction analysis of the material after solvent exchange, evacuation and gas adsorption experiments revealed that the framework structure of the material was retained throughout the process (Figure S17, ESI). Discussion Comparing the structures of H4L and compounds 1 – 4, a clear geometric preference for one of two broadly defined conformations is present. The compact, H-shaped conformation present in some degree within the structures of H4L, compound 1, compound 4, and one of the two crystallographically inequivalent units of compound 3 contains the potential for energetically favourable intramolecular π-π and C-H···π interactions. Conversely the extended X-shaped conformer, observed in compound 2 and one ligand within compound 3, achieved by rotation of two opposing N-CH2 bonds and the central H2C-N(Bz)2 bond, contains no potential for meaningful intramolecular interaction between the pendant phenyl groups. Given the high degree of conformational freedom within the structure of the ligand, a remarkable degree of consistency is observed, particularly in the case of the centrosymmetric conformers in the structures of 2, 3 and 4, which can be superimposed into two pairs of equivalent geometries (Figure 13). The ligand in compound 1 adopts a more distorted non- centrosymmetric orientation owing to the protonation of one tertiary amine site, resulting in the central N-CH2-CH2-N group adopting a non-planar geometry. Relatively few examples of structurally characterised non-chelating and acyclic N,N,Nʹ,Nʹ- tetrabenzyl-1,2-diaminoethane compounds exist for comparison, although several reports have shown that the conformational freedom present within similar materials can be used to great effect for supramolecular encapsulation and outer- sphere interactions.33 Page 11 of 17 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 17 July 2015.

Compound 2 is shown in red, compound 3 in blue, and compound 4 in green. The results of the gas adsorption experiments carried out on compounds 2 – 4 are largely consistent with the expectation of relatively poor framework stability originating from highly flexible ligand molecules. However, the good stability displayed by compound 4, containing the rigid bpe co-ligand, is an encouraging result in the context of functionalised, flexible linker architectures in gas adsorption applications. Incorporation of this rigid co-ligand into an otherwise conformationally flexible framework allowed substantially greater CO2 adsorption capacity in 4 compared to the unstable 2 and 3, despite compound 4 exhibiting the lowest calculated void volume of all of the materials examined (Figure 14). Fig. 14 Comparison of the CO2 adsorption isotherms, measured at 273K, for the best-performing iteration of each material 2, 3 and 4, presented alongside the crystallographically calculated void volumes (V.V.) for each material. Conclusions We have prepared four new coordination polymer materials from a novel tetracarboyxlic acid ligand H4L, and demonstrated for the first time the utility of the tetrabenzyl-alkylpolyamine skeleton in the synthesis of porous coordination polymers. The flexible backbone of the ligand L was shown to favour two distinct conformers when coordinated to metal ions in the solid state, which were translated as structural features into the resulting frameworks, and which may present a fertile new area in the continuing search for interesting, internally functionalised ligand molecules for applications in porous coordination polymer synthesis. The two-dimensional coordination polymer 1, containing trinuclear nickel cluster nodes with aqua and carboxylate bridging and a charge-balancing trialkylammonium cation within the ligand backbone, displayed ferromagnetic coupling behaviour and a positive zero-field splitting D parameter, which were fully described through experimental fitting and ab initio calculations. Compounds 2, 3 and 4, all ZnII coordination polymers containing prominent solvent channels within their structures, were probed through single-crystal and X-ray powder diffraction studies, solvent exchange and thermal analysis, and gas adsorption experiments. The combination of these techniques revealed that compounds 2 and 3 both underwent a structural transition to poorly crystalline materials of low porosity upon removal of the lattice solvent molecules, either thermally or by solvent exchange. In contrast, compound 4, despite displaying a much smaller solvent-accessible volume and solvent channels of very narrow limiting diameter, displayed drastically improved gas adsorption properties and selective uptake of CO2 over N2 from single-component isotherms measured at 273K. These properties establish compound 4 as an uncommon example of a stable, porous metallosupramolecular architecture containing non- coordinating, covalently attached amine groups which displays selective carbon dioxide uptake.

Figure S3 Encapsulated lattice DMF molecules within the structure of 2. Hydrogen atoms and rotational disorder are omitted for clarity. Figure S4 Overlaid gas adsorption isotherms (CO2 adsorption at 273K, except where otherwise specified) for compound 2 and the solvent exchanged derivatives, with evacuation conditions as stated. Figure S5 Overlaid FTIR spectra of the as-synthesised compound 2 (black) and compound 2 after framework desolvation and collapse (red). Inset: overlaid spectra in the frequency range 1800 – 1400 cm-1, showing the loss of the absorbance due to lattice DMF (1662 cm-1) and rearrangement of the remaining carbonyl absorbances suggesting an altered coordination mode upon framework collapse.

Figure S7 N2 adsorption isotherm for compound 4 (MeCN exchanged and evacuated at 373K), measured at 77K. Enthalpy of Adsorption Calculations for Compound 4 The isosteric heat of adsorption of CO2 was calculated using a least-squares fitting of a virial thermal adsorption equation2,3 which modelled ln(P) as a function of gas adsorbed over the measurement temperatures 273K and 302K, in the uptake range at which datapoints were recorded for both experiments (N = 0-1 mmol). The model function took the form ln(P) = {ln(N) + (a0 + a1N + a2N2)/T + b} where N represents the surface excess adsorption of CO2 in mmol at temperature T and a0 – a2 and b are coefficients determined through least squares fitting. The enthalpy of adsorption was then determined using the relation Q(N) = -R(a0 + a1N + a2N2). Optimised virial coefficients and fitting parameters are given in the table below.
