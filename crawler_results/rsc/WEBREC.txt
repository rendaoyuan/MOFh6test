Commun., 2012, 48, 9168–9170 Selective CO2 adsorption in a metal–organic framework constructed from an organic ligand with ﬂexible jointsw Dae Ho Hong and Myunghyun Paik Suh* Received 22nd June 2012, Accepted 24th July 2012 DOI: 10.1039/c2cc34482c A metal–organic framework (SNU-110) constructed from an organic ligand with ﬂexible joints exhibits selective CO2 adsorption over N2, O2, H2 and CH4 gases. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have great potential to be applied in gas storage,1–9 gas separation,10–26 and fabrication of metal nanoparticles.3,27,28 In particular, they can be applied as capture materials for CO2 from the industry ﬂue gas that is implicated in the global warming.2,10,13 The industry ﬂue gas contains not only CO2 but also other gases such as N2, H2, H2O, and O2 depending on the combustion methods. Therefore, selective adsorption properties of MOFs for CO2–N2 and CO2–H2 are important for post-combustion and pre-combustion CO2 capture, respectively. In addition, the MOFs with selective adsorption property for CO2–CH4 can be applied in puriﬁcation of low quality natural gas.24–26 To be a CO2 capture material, the MOFs should have high CO2 adsorption capacity at ambient temperature,8,9 high adsorption selectivity of CO2 over other gases,10–12 and high thermal stability. To increase the CO2 capture ability of MOFs, various strategies have been employed such as making the network inherently ﬂexible,10 functionalizing the pore-surface with amines,11,12 creating accessible metal sites,13 attaching ﬂexible arms,14,15 exposing Lewis base sites,18 and exchanging counter ions included in the charged framework.19 It has been reported that MOFs constructed from ﬂexible organic components, even if they do not adsorb N2 and H2 gases due to the smaller pores of the activated samples than the kinetic diameters of these gases, often selectively adsorb CO2 since they open the gates for CO2 that has much higher polarizability (2.51 A˚ 3) and quadrupole moment (1.4  1039 C m2) than other gases.10,15–17,20 However, some of those MOFs still adsorb considerable amounts of CH4 at 195 K because they are ﬂexible enough to open the gates for CH4 having high polarizability (2.45 A˚ 3), and cannot be applied in puriﬁcation of natural gas. Here we report on {[Zn2(mpm-PBODB)2bpy]3DMF}n (SNU-110) synthesized from the organic linker having ﬂexible joints (Scheme 1). The MOF shows a selective CO2 adsorption property over CH4 as well as N2 and H2 gases at 195 K. SNU-110 was synthesized from solvothermal reaction of 3,30-(1,4-phenylenebis(oxy))dibenzoic acid (H2mpm-PBODB) with Zn(NO3)26H2O and 4,40-bipyridine (bpy) in DMF. It is thermally stable up to 370 1C (see ESIw). In the X-ray crystal structure of SNU-110, two ZnII ions form a paddle wheel cluster unit, each of which is connected by four mpm-PBODB ligands to construct a corrugated 2D layer extending along the (10%2) plane (Fig. 1a). The 2D layers are further connected by bpy ligands along the [101] direction, since the axial sites of the paddle wheel units are coordinated with bpy ligands, which gives rise to a 3D framework generating 1D channels (Fig. 1b and c). The angle made between the corrugated 2D planes and the bpy pillar is 29.41, Scheme 1 Design of an organic ligand with ﬂexible joints: 3,30-(1,4- phenylenebis(oxy))dibenzoic acid (H2mpm-PBODB).

Commun., 2012, 48, 9168–9170 9169 although nearly right angle has been commonly made between the connecting pillar and the 2D layer constructed by the paddle-wheel type Zn2 cluster units.29 The 1D channels extending along the [101] direction have the rectangular cavities of eﬀective size 4.4  3.7 A˚ 2, and they are ﬁlled with guest DMF molecules as characterized by IR, EA, and TGA data. The solvent accessible volume estimated by PLATON is 30% of the structure (0.248 cm3 g1).30 The desolvated sample, [Zn2(mpm-PBODB)2bpy]n (SNU-1100), was prepared by the treatment of SNU-110 with supercritical CO2 ﬂuid. Since the single crystallinity was not maintained during this activation process, the desolvated phase was analysed by powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) data of SNU-1100. The PXRD patterns indicate that SNU-1100 is diﬀerent from the structure of the as-synthesized sample (Fig. 2). The PXRD pattern of SNU-1100 was indexed by an ab initio method, using Dicvol04 program,31 and reﬁned by the Pawley method (Rp = 5.24%, Rwp = 8.05%, see ESIw), which suggested a triclinic unit cell (P1). Appearance of a peak at 2y = 4.561 (hkl = 010), which is systemically absent in the original compound having the P21/c space group, also supports the triclinic cell that the screw axis along the b axis does not exist. According to the reﬁned unit cell, the total unit cell volume (2438.59 A˚ 3) of SNU-1100 is reduced by ca. 8.8% compared with that (2673.0 A˚ 3) of SNU-110, suggesting that the desolvated sample has a shrunken structure. The pore volume of SNU-1100 is 0.16 cm3 g1 as calculated by subtracting the volume of the skeleton (1909.74 A˚ 3; calculated by PLATON30) from its unit cell volume. It is much smaller than that (0.248 cm3 g1) of SNU-110. Rietveld reﬁnement was also tried, but the reasonable solution or reﬁned structure could not be obtained from the PXRD data due to low resolution of the diﬀraction data as well as the low symmetry of the unit cell. When SNU-1100 was immersed in DMF for 10 min, the original structure of SNU-110 was restored as evidenced by PXRD patterns (Fig. 2d). The gas adsorption isotherms of SNU-1100 were measured for N2, H2, O2, CH4, and CO2 gases (Fig. 3 and Table 1). As seen in Fig. 3, SNU-1100 hardly adsorbs N2, O2, and H2 gases at 77 K as well as CH4 gas at 195 K, but it adsorbs a signiﬁcant amount of CO2 at 195 K. Considering the kinetic diameters of CH4, O2, N2, and H2, which are 3.8, 3.46, 3.64, and 2.89 A˚ , respectively, the window size of SNU-1100 must be smaller than 2.89 A˚ . However, the fact that CO2 with a kinetic diameter of 3.3 A˚ is adsorbed in SNU-1100 suggests that CO2 interacts with the ﬂexible MOF and opens up the gate due to its large polarizability and quadrupole moment.10 The facilitated diﬀusion of CO2 at 195 K versus H2 at 77 K must be also a factor in this phenomenon. The adsorption selectivities of SNU-1100 at 195 K and 1 bar for CO2–N2 and CO2–H2 are 35 : 1 (v/v) and 61 : 1 (v/v), respectively, and that for CO2–CH4 is 15 : 1 (v/v). The CO2 adsorption isotherm at 195 K shows a two-step adsorption curve with a big desorption-hysteresis. The ﬁrst step shows a type-I isotherm and the adsorption saturation occurs at 0.40 atm where the uptake amount reaches 1.3 mmol g1. The second adsorption step starts at 0.48 atm and the uptake amount reaches 4.3 mmol g1, i.e. 3 times greater than that of the ﬁrst step. The step-wise adsorption of CO2 at 195 K indicates that the framework structure containing the ﬂexible Fig. 2 Powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns of SNU-110.

Commun., 2012, 48, 9168–9170 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 organic linker is altered depending on the CO2 pressure.15–17 The contracted phase of SNU-1100 transforms to the open phase when CO2 pressure exceeds 0.48 atm at 195 K, and then completely opens at 1 atm to get saturated with CO2. The desorption curve shows a hysteresis with type I isotherm. As the pressure of CO2 is reduced from 1 atm, the framework maintains the open phase till 3  102 atm, and then suddenly returns to the contracted phase again. This hysteresis can be reproduced for several cycles in the repeated experiments. The calculated surface areas of SNU-1100, as estimated from the ﬁrst step adsorption curve by applying the Dubinin Radushkevich (DR), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and Langmuir methods, are 409 m2 g1, 101 m2 g1, and 111 m2 g1, respectively. When calculated by using the desorption curve, they are 658 m2 g1, 411 m2 g1, and 486 m2 g1, respectively. The pore volume (0.154 cm3 g1) estimated from the ﬁrst step adsorption curve by using the DR equation is similar to the value (0.16 cm3 g1) calculated by the unit cell volume of SNU-1100 minus the skeletal volume, while that (0.247 cm3 g1) obtained from the desorption curve is similar to the free volume (0.248 cm3 g1) of SNU-110 estimated by using PLATON.30 When temperature was elevated to 231, 273, and 298 K, the P/P0 value for the phase transition of the MOF decreased to 0.021, 0.0044, 0.0036, respectively (see ESIw). This trend can be explained by the increase of thermal energies for both the frame- work and the CO2 molecules as the temperature increases.16 The PXRD pattern of SNU-1100 measured under CO2 pressure (ca. 1 atm) at 248 K indicates that many peaks are shifted to the lower angle regions compared with those of SNU-1100, suggesting the expansion of the framework on CO2 adsorption as well (Fig. 2e). The average isosteric heat (Qst) of the CO2 adsorption in SNU-1100 is 26.2 kJ mol1, as calculated from the adsorption data at 195, 231, 273, and 298 K by using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation (see ESIw). It is comparable to those (25–35 kJ mol1) of common MOFs.2 Interestingly, SNU-1100 in this work hardly adsorbs CH4 at 195 K. In general, at 195 K, MOFs show higher uptake capacity for CO2 than for CH4 since CO2 (Tc = 304.19 K) is subcritical and thus more condensable than CH4 (Tc = 190.09 K) that is supercritical.24–26 Despite this, the ﬂexible MOFs selectively adsorbing CO2 over N2 and H2 often cannot eﬃciently exclude CH4 that has high polarizability (2.45 A˚ 3). For example, SNU-M10 adsorbs 123.5 cm3 g1 of CO2 and 27.5 cm3 g1 of CH4 at 195 K, and SNU-21S adsorbs 257 cm3 g1 of CO2 and 124 cm3 g1 of CH4 at 195 K.10,20 Therefore, it is obvious that the ﬂexibility of the present MOF is so well tuned that only CO2 can open the gate to be adsorbed in the pores. In conclusion, we have synthesized a porous metal–organic framework, SNU-110, by using an organic linker having ﬂexible joints. The sample desolvated by using the supercritical CO2 ﬂuid, SNU-1100, has shrunken structure as evidenced by PXRD data. It exhibits a two-step CO2 adsorption isotherm at 195 K, which is attributed to the structural transformations depending on the amount of CO2 adsorption. It shows high adsorption selectivity for CO2 over H2, N2, and CH4 gases at 195 K.

Preparation of [Zn2(mpm-PBODB)2bpy]n (SNU-110’) by the supercritical drying method. Prior to drying, the mother liquor of as-synthesized SNU-110, was decanted and the crystals were washed briefly with DMF (15 mL × 3). The crystals were placed inside the supercritical dryer together with the solvent and the drying chamber was sealed. The temperature and pressure of the chamber were raised to 40 oC and 200 bar with CO2, above the critical point (31 oC, 73 atm) of CO2. The chamber was vented at a rate of 5 mL min-1 and then filled with CO2 again. The cycles of refilling with CO2, pressurizing, and venting were repeated for 4 h.

Low-Pressure Gas Sorption Measurements. The gas adsorption-desorption data were measured by an automated micropore gas analyzer Autosorb-1 or Autosorb-3B (Quantachrome Instruments). All gases used were of 99.9999% purity. Sample was activated by supercritical CO2 as described above and transferred to a gas sorption cell in a glove bag filled with Ar gas to prevent exposure to air. The N2 gas isotherms were measured at 77 K, 195 K, and 298 K. The O2 gas isotherms were measured at 77 K. The H2 gas isotherms were measured at 77 K and 195 K, and the CO2 and CH4 gas sorption isotherms were monitored at 195, 231, 273, and 298 K at each equilibrium pressure by the static volumetric method. After gas sorption measurement, the weight of sample was measured again precisely. Surface area and pore volume were calculated from CO2 adsorption/desorption data measured at 195 K using DR method, by taking the data in the range of P = 0.001 – 0.006 atm and P = 0.008 – 0.05 atm, respectively.
