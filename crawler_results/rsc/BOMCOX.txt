Ultrasound assisted synthesis of a Zn(II) metal– organic framework with nano-plate morphology using non-linear dicarboxylate and linear N-donor ligands† Mohammad Yaser Masoomi,a Ali Morsali*a and Peter C. Junkb A 3D, porous Zn(II)-based metal–organic framework {[Zn2(oba)2(4-bpdb)]$2DMF}n (TMU-4) with double interpenetration was prepared by using a non-linear dicarboxylate (H2oba ¼ 4,40-oxybisbenzoic acid) and a linear N-donor (4-bpdb ¼ 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene) ligand. Also micro- and nano-plates of this MOF were synthesized by a sonochemical process and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diﬀraction and IR spectroscopy. The thermal stability was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Sonication time and concentration of initial reagents eﬀects on the size and morphology of nano-structured MOFs, were studied. Calcination of TMU-4 at 500 C under air atmosphere yields ZnO nanoparticles. Introduction Three-dimensional (3D) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new class of porous materials which are highly attractive because of their potential use as functional materials in structure-dependent applications, such as gas storage and separation, ion exchange, sensing, catalysis, and drug delivery.1–8 The MOFs can be designed by choosing appropriate organic ligands and inorganic secondary building units (SBUs).9 Of the many ligands that have been employed for the prep- aration of MOF structures, using a combination of functional- ized dicarboxylic acids and N-donor ligands can lead to MOFs with desired properties.5,10,11 Meanwhile, there is also an increasing interest in MOFs with exible and dynamic frame- works with appropriate groups in their structures to exhibit high selectivity for guest inclusion and structural trans- formation upon adsorption/desorption of guest molecules.12,13 Reducing the size of MOFs to nanoscale has been extremely attractive.4 Recently using ultrasound irradiation in synthesis and preparation of nano or microstructures of MOFs has been of interest.14–17 In the research area of sonochemistry molecules undergo a chemical reaction because of the application of powerful ultrasound radiation (20 KHz–10 MHz)18 which induce chemical or physical changes during cavitation. Cavitation involves formation, growth, and instantaneously implosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid, which generates local hot spots having temperatures up to 5000 C, 500 atm pressures with a lifetime of a few microseconds.19–21 These extreme conditions can also enhance the formation of nano-sized structures, mostly via an increase of crystallization nuclei.22 ZnO is a polar inorganic material and an important n-type semiconductor with a wide band gap energy of 3.37 eV,23 and is an excellent material for potential applications including solar cells, luminescent materials, transparent conductors and gas sensors.24–28 Up until now, various synthetic methods have been developed to produce zinc oxide nanostructures.29,30 Thermal decomposition of MOFs under various conditions has been widely studied for the preparation of ZnO nanostructures with diﬀerent sizes and morphologies.31 In this work, we have synthesized a Zn(II) metal–organic framework based on a V-shaped exible dicarboxylate ligand, 4,40-oxybis(benzoic acid) (H2oba) and the N-donor ligand 1,4- bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene (4-bpdb) and investigated the eﬀect of ultrasonic irradiation on shape and size. Also TMU- 4 was calcined at 500 C to prepare ZnO nanoparticles. Experimental Materials and physical techniques All reagents for the synthesis and analysis were commercially available from Aldrich and Merck Company and used as received. The ligand 4-bpdb (1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3-diaza-1,3- butadiene) was prepared by the reported method.32 Melting points were measured on an Electrothermal 9100 apparatus. IR spectra were recorded using Thermo Nicolet IR 100 FT-IR. aDepartment of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran.

The samples were characterized with a eld emission scanning electron micro- scope (FE-SEM) Philips XL30 and TESCAN MIRA (Czech) with gold coating. The thermal behaviour was measured with a PL-STA 1500 apparatus with the rate of 10 C min1 in a static atmosphere of argon. X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Philips X'pert diﬀractometer with mono chromated Cu-Ka radiation. Single crystals of TMU-4 were coated with viscous hydro- carbon oil and mounted on a loop. Data were obtained at 173 C (100 K) on the MX1: Macromolecular Crystallography beamline at the Australian Synchrotron, Victoria, Australia. Data collection and integration on the MX1: Macromolecular Crystallography beamline were carried out using Blu-Ice33 and the XDS soware package.34 The structure was solved using SHELXS35 and rened by full-matrix least-squares on all F2 data using SHELX,35 in conjunction with the X-Seed graphical user interface.36 All hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated posi- tions using the riding model. Sorption study on TMU-4 was performed using the AutosorbIQ from Quantachrome Instru- ments: CO2 at 195 K. The sample was activated at 140 C for 12 hours under vacuum. Dynamic light scattering measurements of particle sizes were determined by means of a Zetasizer Nano equipment. Synthesis of {[Zn2(oba)2(4-bpdb)]$2DMF}n (TMU-4) Conventional heating. Single crystals of TMU-4 suitable for X-ray diﬀraction were prepared by mixing Zn(NO3)2$6H2O (0.297 g, 1 mmol), H2oba (0.254 g, 1 mmol) and 4-bpdb (0.105 g, 0.5 mmol) in 30 mL of DMF. This mixture was sonicated until all solids were uniformly dispersed (3 min), and it was then heated at 80 C. Aer 72 hours, yellow crystals of TMU-4 were collected (0.420 g, yield 71% based on oba), d.p. >300 C.

Ultrasonic syntheses of TMU-4 were carried out in an ultrasonic bath at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure for 30, 60 and 90 min with diﬀerent concentrations of metal and ligands, respectively. The resulting powder was isolated by centrifugation, washed with DMF three times and dried in air for characterization (Table 1). The eﬀect of triethylamine (TEA) was investigated by adding 2 and 3 mL of TEA to adjust pH to 6 and 7, respectively. Results and discussion Yellow crystals of TMU-4 were synthesized by mixing H2oba, Zn(NO3)2$6H2O and 4-bpdb in DMF solvent at 80 C for 3 days.

View Article Online Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction reveals that TMU-4 crystallized in the space group P21/c with the formula of {[Zn2(oba)2(4-bpdb)]$ 2DMF}n.37 TMU-4 is based on a binuclear Zn2 unit (Zn#1 and Zn#2), both of which have tetrahedral geometry and coordi- nated to three carboxylate O atoms (for Zn#1: O2, O7, O10, and for Zn#2: O1, O5, O6) from three adjacent oba ligands and one N atom (Zn#1: N4 and Zn#2: N1) from the 4-bpdb ligand (Fig. 1a). The distance between Zn#1 and Zn#2 is 3.358 ˚A. Each non- linear (C–O–C ¼ 118.0(6)) dicarboxylate oba ligand binds three consecutive Zn(II) centers from two diﬀerent units: one carboxylate group of an oba ligand adopts a bidentate mode and bridges both Zn#1 and Zn#2 centers of the unit while the other one is monodentate and binds to either Zn#1 or Zn#2, thereby forming 2D sheets (Fig. 1b). The 2D sheets are connected through the linear 4-bpdb, extending the structure in three dimensions. The V-shaped coordination of the oba ligand plays an important role in the linkage of the nodes resulting in a three-dimensional honeycomb framework with double inter- penetration (Fig. 1c). Although the double interpenetration is formed to avoid an extremely large void space, but still possesses one-dimensional (1D) open channels (aperture size: 5.3  8.8 ˚A, taking into account the van der Waals radii; 35.9% void space per unit cell)38 running along the [101] direction and lattice DMF molecules are accommodated in the channels (Fig. 1d). TMU-4 is porous to CO2 at 195 K and 1 bar (148.90 cm3 g1 at 1 bar; BET surface area calculated over p/p0 ¼ 0.02–0.3 : 517.9 m2 g1) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The pore volume calculated from the CO2 adsorption is 0.298 cm3 g1.39 The morphology and size of TMU-4 were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by changing two parame- ters; sonication time and concentration of starting materials as well as control of nucleation.

View Article Online Firstly, sonication time as a parameter was changed at constant concentration of [0.04] M of starting materials. In all three diﬀerent times (30, 60 and 90 min) micro-plates of TMU-4 were obtained in which higher sonication time (90 min) leads to uniform distribution in plate size (Fig. 2 and S3, ESI†). Hence, sonication time of 90 min is considered as the optimized value. Aer this in order to investigate the role of concentration of initial reagents on the morphology and size of product, reac- tions were performed with two diﬀerent concentrations of starting materials ([0.06] M and [0.02] M). The results show that high concentrations of initial reagents increased particle size and thus lower concentration of initial reagents reduced the size of plates (Fig. 3). Aer this, increasing the speed of nucle- ation during the synthesis of TMU-4 was tested by adding tri- ethylamine (TEA). Using TEA causes fast nucleation of product due to deprotonated oba ligand and faster nucleation reduces particle size. In this mechanism nano-plates with a narrow size distribution were obtained (Fig. 3c and d).22 By this, width of nano-plate reduces to 90 nm (Fig. 3d). The IR spectra of both crystals produced by conventional heating and nano-plate produced by the sonochemical method show the symmetric nsym (COO) and asymmetric nas (COO) vibrations of the carboxylate groups at 1409 cm1 and 1604 cm1, respectively. Also the characteristic absorption peak (nC]O ¼ 1679 cm1) of DMF are presented in the IR spectra of TMU-4 (Fig. S4, ESI†). A comparison between powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) patterns of the simulated (derived from the single crystal structure of TMU-4) and experimental (resulting from the sonochemical process) conrms that the sonochemically synthesized TMU-4 is structurally identical to TMU-4 prepared through conventional heating (Fig. 4). To examine the thermal stability of TMU-4 thermogravi- metric analysis (TGA) was carried out between 25 and 600 C. The TGA curve of TMU-4 (conventional heating) shows a plateau in the range of 25 to 100 C followed by a continuous loss of 14.5% (expected: 14.6%) up to 305 C, which can be ascribed to removal of the guest DMF molecules (Fig. 5). Decomposition of TMU-4's framework occurs in the temperature range of 305–500 C. Final residual mass 18.4% (expected: 19%) and the XRD pattern of the nal decomposition product show the formation of ZnO (Fig. S5, ESI†). To prepare zinc oxide nanoparticles, TMU-4 was calcined at 500 C for 2 h. Fig. S5† depicts the XRD patterns of the residue obtained from calcination of TMU-4. The Bragg diﬀraction peaks in the range of 2q ¼ 20–80 exhibit the typical patterns of hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO consistent with the repor- ted data by the JCPDS card number 36-1451 with lattice parameters of a ¼ 3.25 and c ¼ 5.20 ˚A. The SEM image of the residue obtained from the direct calcination of TMU-4 at 500 C shows the formation of ZnO nanoparticle (Fig. 6). Fig. 4 XRD patterns of TMU-4 prepared by either conventional heating or sonochemical reaction (samples A–G). The data are in good agreement with the simulated pattern derived from the corresponding single-crystal structure data. Fig. 5 Thermogravimetric proﬁles of TMU-4 isolated conventional heating.

View Article Online Conclusions A 3D, porous metal–organic framework {[Zn2(oba)2(4-bpdb)]$ 2DMF}n (TMU-4) with double interpenetration was synthesized by conventional heating and analysed by X-ray crystallography. Using ultrasonic irradiation leads to formation of micro- and nano-plates of TMU-4 that were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diﬀraction and IR spectros- copy. To prepare the nanostructure of TMU-4, three diﬀerent times and concentrations of initial reagents, [0.06], [0.04] and [0.02] M, were tested. Also the rate of nucleation was tested by adding TEA to the reaction. Results show that best uniform distribution of nano-plates TMU-4 were obtained in 90 min with concentration of [0.02] M in the presence of TEA. These results indicate that sonochemical process can be used as an eﬀective method for fast and readily preparation of nano-MOFs. Also calcination of TMU-4 at 500 C under air atmosphere yields ZnO nanoparticles. Acknowledgements Support of this investigation by Tarbiat Modares University is gratefully acknowledged.
