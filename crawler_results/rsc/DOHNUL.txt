Manuscript Coordination assemblies of the MII-tm/bpt (M ¼ Zn/ Cd/Co/Ni) mixed-ligand system: positional isomeric eﬀect, structural diversiﬁcation and properties† Fu-Ping Huang,ab Peng-Fei Yao,a Wei Luo,a Hai-Ye Li,a Qing Yu,a He-Dong Bian*a and Shi-Ping Yan*b To further investigate the inﬂuence of the positional isomeric ligands on structural topologies, six new coordination polymers with three positional isomeric dipyridyl ligands (4,40-Hbpt, 3,40-Hbpt and 3,30-Hbpt) and trimellitic acid (H3tm), namely, {[Zn3(tm)2(4,40-Hbpt)2(H2O)2]$10H2O}n (1), [Zn3(tm)2(3,30-Hbpt)2]n (2), {[Cd2(tm)(3,40-bpt)(H2O)2]$H2O}n (3), {[Cd4(tm)2(3,30-bpt)2(H2O)2]$3H2O}n (4), {[Co3(tm)2(3,40-Hbpt)2(H2O)6]$ 2H2O}n (5), {[Ni3(tm)2(3,30-Hbpt)4(H2O)2]$7H2O}n (6), have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions and characterized. Structural analysis reveals that: 1 and 5 both have 3D 4-connected networks, with the (4.64.8)(42.63.8)2(44.62)2 Schl¨aﬂi symbol for 1 and (42.52.72)(52.62.7.8)2(4.52.6.72)2 symbol for 5. 2 and 3 both have 3D (4,5)-connected networks, with the (34.42.52)2(42.84)(3.43.52.6.72.8)2 symbol for 2 and (34.42.52)2(42.84)(3.43.52.6.72.8)2 symbol for 3. 4 has a 3D trinodal (3,4,5)-connected net with the (3.44.53.6.7) (43.62.7)(44.62)(42.6)2(45.64.8)2 symbol. And 6 has a 2D (3,4)-connected layer with (3.62)2(3.4.62.72)2(5.63.82) symbol. These results indicate that the versatile coordination modes of tm and the isomeric nature of bpt play crucial roles in modulating structural topologies of these complexes. Moreover, the luminescent properties of 1–4 and the magnetic behavior of 5–6, have been investigated. Introduction The design and construction of coordination polymers have achieved considerable interest in the realm of crystal engi- neering, not only for their tremendous potential applications as functional materials,1–6 but also for their intriguing variety of topological structures.7–10 The structural natures are diverse depending on the metal ions, PH value, solvents, the ligands, synthetic methods, etc.11–13 One of the most useful and impor- tant ways to study the controllable construction is still the deliberate modication of the organic ligands.14,15 Among the reported studies, much eﬀort has focused on the construction of coordination polymers using multidentate ligands such as polycarboxylate and N-heterocyclic ligands.16 Recently, our group reported a series of CoII/ZnII/CdII coordination polymers with diﬀerent topological structures based on the mixed-ligand systems of three positional isomeric N-heterocyclic-like ligands: 1H-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (4,40-Hbpt), 1H-3-(3-pyridyl)- 5-(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (3,40-Hbpt), 1H-3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)- 1,2,4-triazole (3,30-Hbpt) and three positional isomeric aromatic dicarboxylic anions: o-BDC, m-BDC, p-BDC (BDC ¼ benzenedicarboxylate anion).17 As an extension of this work, we choose trimellitic acid (H3tm) and the above-mentioned isomeric N-heterocyclic ligands to construct new coordination frameworks with versatile topolog- ical symbols. Tm with versatile coordination modes, can be considered as a bent building block like o, m-BDC, and a linear building block like p-BDC (Scheme 1). A series of coordination polymers, namely, {[Zn3(tm)2(4,40-Hbpt)2(H2O)2]$10H2O}n (1), [Zn3(tm)2(3,30-Hbpt)2]n (2), {[Cd2(tm)(3,40-bpt)(H2O)2]$H2O}n (3), {[Cd4(tm)2(3,30-bpt)2(H2O)2]$3H2O}n (4), {[Co3(tm)2(3,40-Hbpt)2- (H2O)6]$2H2O}n (5), {[Ni3(tm)2(3,30-Hbpt)4(H2O)2]$7H2O}n (6) were constructed successfully. The positional isomeric eﬀects of the bpt bridges on the coordination assemblies were elucidated. In addition, the magnetic and luminescent properties of these compounds have been investigated.

IR spectra were taken on a Perkin-Elmer spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer in the 4000–400 cm1 region with KBr pellets. Elemental anal- yses for C, H and N were carried out on a Model 2400 II, Perkin- Elmer elemental analyzer. The magnetic susceptibility measurements of the polycrystalline samples were measured over the temperature range of 2–300 K with a Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 SQUID magnetometer using an applied magnetic eld of 1000 Oe. Field dependences of magnetization were measured using a ux magnetometer in an applied eld up to 50 kOe generated by a conventional pulsed technique. A diamagnetic correction to the observed susceptibilities was applied using Pascal's constants. X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRPD) intensities were measured on a Rigaku D/max-IIIA diﬀractometer (Cu-Ka, l ¼ 1.54056 ˚A). The single crystalline powder samples were prepared by crushing the crystals and scanned from 3 to 60 with a step of 0.1 s1. Calculated patterns of 1–6 were generated with PowderCell.

X-ray crystallographic determination All reection data were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD instrument by using graphite-monochromatic Mo-Ka radiation (l ¼ 0.71073 ˚A) at room temperature. A semiempirical absorp- tion correction by using the SADABS program was applied, and the raw data frame integration was performed with SAINT.19 The crystal structures were solved by the direct method using the program SHELXS-9720 and rened by the full-matrix least- squares method on F2 for all non-hydrogen atoms using SHELXL-9721 with anisotropic thermal parameters. All hydrogen atoms were located in calculated positions and rened iso- tropically, except the hydrogen atoms of water molecules were xed in a diﬀerence Fourier map and rened isotropically. The details of the crystal data were summarized in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and angles for compounds 1–6 are listed in Table 2 (ESI†). XRPD results To conrm whether the crystal structures are truly representa- tive of the bulk materials, X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRPD) experiments have also been carried out for 1–6. The XRPD experimental and computer-simulated patterns of the corre- sponding complexes are shown in ESI, Fig. S2–S7.† Although the experimental patterns have a few unindexed diﬀraction lines and some are slightly broadened in comparison with those simulated from the single crystal models, it can still be considered favorably that the bulk synthesized materials and the as-grown crystals are homogeneous for 1–6. Results and discussion Crystal structures {[Zn3(tm)2(4,40-Hbpt)2(H2O)2]$10H2O}n (1). As shown in Fig. 1a, 1 reveals a novel 3D coordination polymer with a V- shaped trinuclear Zn(II) unit bridged by tm anions. In the tri- nuclear unit, the middle Zn1 ions lying on a twofold axis exhibit a four-coordinated tetrahedrally environment with two carbox- ylic O atoms (O1, O1A, symmetry code: A: x, y, z + 1/2) from two tm anions and two N atoms (N1, N1A) from two 4,40-Hbpt ligands. The terminal Zn2 ions exhibit a distorted octahedral geometry, which is provided by one pyridyl N (N5B, B: x – 1, y + 1, z + 1/2) donor, four carboxylate O (O2, O3A, O5C, O6C, C: x + 1/2, y + 1/2, z + 1) atoms and one water molecule (O7). The middle Zn1 ion is linked to terminal Zn2 ions with one syn–anti carboxylate from tm [Zn/Zn ¼ 4.411(1) ˚A] to form the V-shaped unit. The adjacent trinuclear units are linked by tm to generate straight-like chains running along the crystallographic c axis (Fig. 1b), in which tm exhibit a coordinating mode of mode 1 (Scheme 1) and three carboxylate groups of tm exhibit three diﬀerent coordination patterns (unidentate, chelating, and syn– anti bridge modes, respectively). On the other hand, the adja- cent trinuclear units are bridged by 4,40-bpt ligands to result in zigzag-like chains along the a axis (Fig. 1c). As a consequence, the adjacent trinuclear units are further connected by tm and 4,40-Hbpt components, resulting into the generation of a 3D coordination polymeric network (Fig. 1d). A topological analysis reveals that each tm serves as a 4-connected node to join four Zn(II) ions, both Zn1 and Zn2 play the 4-con- nected role to link each other via the 4,40-Hbpt spacers and tm nodes. According to Wells' topology denition,22 an unprece- dented 4-connected topology with the short Schl¨ai symbol of (4.64.8)(42.63.8)2(44.62)2 is formed (Fig. 1e).

View Article Online the crystallographic c axis (Fig. 2b), and the third carboxylate group adopts a syn–anti mode bridging adjacent Zn(II) atoms with the Zn/Zn separation of 4.172 (2) ˚A. The adjacent Zn(II) centers in 2 are connected by tm components, resulting into the generation of a 3D [Zn(tm)] coordination polymeric network (Fig. 2c). In addition, the 3D [Zn(tm)] network are further xed by 3,30-Hbpt ligands with syn–syn mode bridging the adjacent Zn(II) atoms. (Fig. 2d). On the basis of the connectivity of Zn1 and Zn2 atoms, both of them are viewed to be 4-connected nodes. Moreover, tm also can be viewed as a 4-connected node and the 3,30-Hbpt as a linker. In this way, this framework can be simplied to be a 4- connected topology with the short Schl¨ai symbol of (34.42.52)2(42.84)(3.43.52.6.72.8)2 (Fig. 2e). Considering the dinuclear Zn(II) unit bridged by tm anions as a node to simply the structure of 2, simplied topologies could also be deter- mined with the short Schl¨ai symbol of (44.62) (48.66.8) (Fig. 2f). {[Cd2(tm)(3,40-bpt)(H2O)2]$H2O}n (3). 3 features a 3D coor- dination polymeric architecture, containing two independent Cd(II) cations (Fig. 3a). The Cd1 ion is coordinated by one pyridyl N donor (N1C, C: x + 1, y + 1, z + 2), one triazole N donor (N3), and four carboxylate O atoms (O1B, O2B, O4A, O5, A: x + 1, y, z + 1; B: x + 1, y + 1, z + 1), to form a distorted octa- hedral geometry. The Cd2 ion also adopts a distorted octahedral geometry, which is provided by one triazole N atom of 3,40-bpt (N4) and one water O atom (O8), two carboxylate O atoms (O3A, O5) from two tm anions, one water O atom (O7) and one pyridyl N atom 3,40-bpt (N5D, D: x + 2, y, z + 2). The Cd2 ion is linked to Cd1 ion with mixed bridges through one m2 carboxyl O atom, one syn–syn carboxylate [Cd/Cd ¼ 3.5739(9) ˚A, Cd1–O5– Cd2 ¼ 101.84(2)] and two triazole N atoms to form a dinuclear unit. The adjacent dinuclear units are linked by tm to generate a 1-D chain running along the crystallographic b axis (Fig. 3b). Tm in 3 exhibit a coordinating mode of mode 3 (Scheme 1). And three carboxylate groups on the tm anion of the 1-D chain display diﬀerent coordination patterns (m2-carboxyl O, chelating, and syn–syn bridge modes, respectively). The 3,40-bpt ligand exhibit a coordinating mode of m4-h1:h1:h1:h1. The adjacent dinuclear units are also connected by 3,40-bpt ligand to generate a 1D chain (Fig. 3c). As a consequence, adjacent dinuclear units are connected by tm and 3,40-bpt ligand, resulting into the generation of a 3D coordination polymeric network (Fig. 3d). A better insight into the nature of this 3D coordination polymeric network can be achieved by topological analysis, as shown in Fig. 3e. In 3, Cd1 and Cd2 atoms can be viewed as 5- connected and 4-connected nodes, respectively. And the 3D network can be further simplied by considering tm as 5-con- nected nodes and 3,40-bpt as 4-connected nodes, respectively. Thus, the structure can be simplied as a (4,5)-connected topology with (3.44.5.63.8)(3.43.62)(33.44.5.62)(43.62.8) Schl¨ai symbol. Considering the dinuclear Cd(II) unit as a node to simply the structure of 3, simplied topologies could also be determined with the short Schl¨ai symbol of (42.6) (42.65.83) (Fig. 3f). Diﬀerent from bpt ligands reported before,17 which act as linkers, the 3,40-bpt ligands in 3 act as a 4-connected node, with two triazolyl nitrogen donors coordinating with two Cd atoms. As a result, compound 3 reveals a more complicated architecture than before. {[Cd4(tm)2(3,30-bpt)2(H2O)2]$3H2O}n (4). The asymmetric unit of 4 consists of four Cd(II) cations.

In addition, the distance of Cd4 and O2 is 2.777(8) ˚A indicating a weak interaction. Tm in 4 exhibits two kinds of diﬀerent coor- dinating modes: mode 4 and mode 5 (Scheme 1). The diﬀerent modes of the tm is conducive to the formation of the centro- symmetric structural framework of 4. It is quite interesting that, tm adopt aforementioned coordinating modes, link the Cd(II) atoms to form a decorated ribbon chains along the a axis (Fig. 4b). In the middle of the chain, tm adopt mode 4. While on both sides of the chain tm adopt mode 5. The chain possesses a certain width because tm keeps two uncoordinated oxygen atoms outside the chain in mode 5, characteristics which are relatively rare in the reported articles.23 Then, the chain are cross-linked by pyridine N atoms and triazole N atoms of 3,30- bpt ligands to generate a 3D network (Fig. 4c). Considering of the connectivity of Cd atoms, Cd1 can be viewed as a 5-connected node, Cd2 and Cd3 are viewed as 4- connected nodes and Cd4 atom as 3-connected node, respec- tively (the ratio is 1 : 2 : 1). Thus, this 3D network can be further simplied by considering each tm as a 5-connected node and each 3,30-bpt ligand as a 3-connected node. Therefore, the overall structure of 4, can be simplied as a trinodal (3,4,5)- connected net with the short Schl¨ai symbol of (3.44.53.6.7)(43.62.7)(44.62) (42.6)2(45.64.8)2 (Fig. 4d). Considering the dinuclear Cd(II) unit as a node to simply the structure of 3, simplied topologies could also be determined with the short Schl¨ai symbol of (32.42.52) (32.45.56.62)2 (Fig. 4e). Diﬀerent from compound 3, the 3,30-bpt ligands in 4 act as a 3-connected node, with a triazolyl nitrogen donor coordinating with a Cd atom. As a result, compound 4 also reveals a more complicated architecture than before.17 {[Co3(tm)2(3,40-Hbpt)2(H2O)6]$2H2O}n (5).

The Co1 center is coor- dinated by four equatorial carboxylate/water O atoms (O1, O1A, O7, O7A, A: x + 2, y, z + 1) and two apical carboxylate O atoms (O6B, O6C, B: x  1, y, z; C: x + 3, y, z + 1).

Three carboxylic groups of tm exhibit two kinds of coordination modes: one carboxylate group adopts a syn–anti bridging mode to connect the adjacent Co(II) cations with a separation of 5.011 (2) ˚A to furnish a 1-D chain along the b axis whereas the other two carboxylate groups are monodentate. As a consequence, the adjacent Co(II) centers are connected by tm components, resulting in the generation of a 3D coordination polymeric network (Fig. 5b). In addition, the 3D Co-tm network are further xed by 3,40-Hbpt ligands through bridging the adjacent Co atoms (Fig. 5c). From a topology view, all of the Co1, Co2, Co3 and tm can be viewed as 4-connected nodes, and the 3,40-Hbpt can be viewed as a linker. As a result, this framework can be simplied as a 4-connected topology with the short Schl¨ai symbol of (42.52.72)(52.62.7.8)2(4.52.6.72)2 (Fig. 5d). {[Ni3(tm)2(3,30-Hbpt)4(H2O)2]$7H2O}n (6). 6 reveals a novel 2D coordination polymer with a linear trinuclear Ni(II) unit. The asymmetric unit of 6 has one and a half crystallographically independent Ni atoms (Ni2 lies on a symmetry site). Both of them display slightly distorted octahedral coordination geom- etries (Fig. 6a). The Ni1 center is coordinated by three carbox- ylate O atoms from three tm anions (O1, O7, O4A, A: x + 1, y, z + 2, Ni1–O ¼ 2.026(6)–2.096(6) ˚A) and three N atoms from three 3,30-Hbpt ligands (N1, N5A, N6, Ni1–N ¼ 2.108(8)–2.133(8) ˚A). Ni2 lying on an inversion centre is coordinated by four carboxylate O atoms from two tm anions (O3, O3B, O5, O5B, B: x + 1, y  1, z + 2, Ni2–O ¼ 2.072(6)–2.082(7) ˚A) and two pyridyl N donors from two 3,30-Hbpt ligands (N10C, N10D, C: x  1, y  1, z + 1, D: x + 2, y, z + 1, Ni2–N ¼ 2.086(8) ˚A). The middle Ni2 ion is linked to two terminal Ni1 atoms with one syn–anti carboxylate from tm with a separation of 5.373(1) ˚A to furnish a linear trinuclear Ni(II) unit (Fig. 6d). These Ni3 subunits are further extended by tm into a 1D chain along the b axis (Fig. 6b) in which tm exhibit a coordinating mode of mode 7 (Scheme 1) and three carboxylate groups of tm exhibit two diﬀerent coordination patterns (unidentate and syn–anti bridge modes). Adjacent chains are further connected by 3,30-Hbpt pillars to generate a 2D layer (Fig. 6e). From a topological perspective, both Ni1 and Ni2 act as the 4-connected node, tm can be viewed as 3-connected node and the 3,30-bpt ligand can be viewed as the linker. In this way, this framework can be simplied to be a (3,4)-connected 2D layer architecture with the short Schl¨ai symbol of (3.62)2(3.4.62.72)2(5.63.82) (Fig. 6f). Considering the trinuclear Ni(II) unit bridged by tm anions as a node to simply the structure of 6, simplied topologie could also be determined with the short Schl¨ai symbol of 44.62 (Fig. 6g). It is interesting that the lattice water molecules were embedded in the interlaced ABAB. arrangement model of 2D layer. The 3,30-Hbpt ligands in 6 adopt two diﬀerent bridging modes to link adjacent Ni atom (Fig. 6c). The intermolecular packing is further controlled by hydrogen bonds (Table S1†) among the triazole N atoms, carboxylate O atoms and water molecules, to generate a 3D supramolecular architecture. Structural diversity of 1–6 It should be note that a variety of framework structures can be achieved on the basis of the choice of the aromatic tricarboxylate and triazole-containing dipyridyl isomers with diﬀerently oriented pyridyl groups as building blocks.24 As a result, 1–5 form 3D network architecture and 6 form 2D layer architecture, with diversiform connectivity. The phenomenon of structural diversication in 1–6 may arise from some diﬀerent sources in line with our previous work.17 First of all, phenyl dicarboxylate ligands play an important role in con- structing the polymer structures. These dicarboxylate isomers exhibit several coordination patterns (see Scheme 1), in which the carboxylate groups can adopt the bridging, unidentate and chelating modes, respectively. Secondly, the diﬀerently oriented pyridyl N atoms in these triazole-containing bpt isomers, which has a bent backbone, may play signicant roles in the formation of diﬀerent topological structures. Thirdly, metal-directing eﬀect is also important for the structural diversity. In 2, the two Zn(II) centers adopt a slightly distorted trigonal-dipyramidal geometry and a tetrahedron geometry respectively. While in 4, two Cd(II) centers adopt slightly distorted octahedral geometry, the other two Cd(II) centers show distorted tetragonal-pyramidal geometry. The ionic radius of Cd(II) is longer than Zn(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) which means the Cd(II) center can adopt higher coordination numbers leading to a distinct polymeric frame- work. Diﬀerent from reported, tm with three carboxylate groups exhibits more complicated coordination patterns. And the tm linker can be not only considered as bent building blocks like o- BDC, m-BDC, but also linear building blocks like p-BDC (Scheme 1). Furthermore, the triazolyl nitrogen atoms of the isomeric bpt ligands can provide potential coordination sites (in 3 and 4), which is diﬀerent from other bpt ligands act as links, may inuence the nal coordination architectures more complicated.25 Fluorescent properties In this paper, the luminescence spectra of compounds 1–4 in the solid state were studied at room temperature, and their emission spectra are depicted in Fig. 7a.

View Article Online nm (lex ¼ 411 nm), 367 nm (lex ¼ 310 nm) and 427 nm (lex ¼ 349 nm) for 1–4, respectively, whereas the emission peaks for the free ligands 4,40-Hbpt, 3,40-Hbpt, and 3,30-Hbpt were observed at 447 nm, 451 nm, and 488 nm (lex ¼ 368 nm, 378 nm, and 419 nm, respectively). The blue shis of the lumines- cence emission maxima in 1–4 are presumably owing to the result of the coordination of the relevant ligands to a metal center, which eﬀectively increases the rigidity and asymmetry of the ligands.26 Thermal stabilities of the compounds Thermogravimetric analyses (TG) were carried out for complexes 1–6 and the results are shown in Fig. 7b. The TGA curves of 1 suggest that the rst weight loss of 16.47% in the region 65–302 C corresponds to the release of the lattice water and coordinated water (calculated 16.94%), and then, a series of complicated weight losses were observed as the temperature increased until heating ends. For 2, the complex is stable up to 379 C, followed by a series of consecutive steps of weight loss that do not stop until heating ends. For 3, the weight loss of the lattice water and the coordinated water (7.45%) occurs in the range of 80–213 C (calculated 7.62%). The main framework remains intact until it is heated to 375 C and then there are a series of complicated steps of weight loss that do not end until heating ends. For 4, the rst observed weight loss of 7.04% in the region of 62–162 C corresponds to the dehydration process (calculated 6.61%). The residual framework starts to decompose owing to the expulsion of the lattice water and the coordinated water molecules beyond 162 C with a series of complicated weight losses and does not stop until heating ends at 986 C. For 5, the rst weight loss of 12.49% in the region of 65–210 C corresponds to the release of the lattice water and the coordi- nated water molecules (calculated 12.19%). The residual framework starts to decompose beyond 210 C with a series of complicated weight losses and does not stop until heating ends. For 6, the weight loss of the lattice water and the coordinated water (10.59%) occurs in the range of 60–293 C (calculated 10.82%). And then there are a series of complicated steps of weight loss that do not end until heating ends. Magnetic properties Magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out on polycrystalline samples of 5 and 6 in the temperature range 2.0– 300.0 K at 1000 Oe. For 5 (Fig. 8a), the data above 30 K follow the Curie–Weiss law with C ¼ 10.49 cm3 K mol1 and q ¼ 17.64 K. The cMT value at 300 K is 9.91 emu K mol1, which is much larger than the spin-only value 5.64 emu K mol1 for three magnetically active Co(II) ions (S ¼ 3/2, g ¼ 2.0), as expected for Co(II) systems with a signicant contribution from the eﬀects of spin–orbital coupling. As the temperature is lowered, the cMT Fig. 7 (a) The solid-state emission spectra of 1–4 at room temperature; (b) the TG curves of compounds 1–6.

View Article Online values decrease continuously and reaches a local minimum of 5.96 emu K mol1 at about 2 K, indicative of a strong single-ion behavior admixture with a weak antiferromagnetic interaction.27 For 6, (Fig. 8b), the data above 2 K follow the Curie–Weiss law with C ¼ 3.49 cm3 K mol1 and q ¼ 0.17 K. The cMT value at 300 K is 3.49 emu K mol1, which is in good agreement with the spin-only value 3.00 emu K mol1 for three magnetically active Ni(II) ions (S ¼ 1, g ¼ 2.0). Aer lowering the temperature, the cMT value slightly increases to 3.53 emu K mol1 at 30 K, then increases rapidly to reach a maximum of. 3.68 emu K mol1 at 7 K, indicating a weak ferromagnetic coupling between the adjacent Ni(II) ions bridged by the synanti carboxylate groups. The nal decrease of cMT may be attributed to the saturation eﬀect, zero-eld splitting of Ni(II) ions and/or the presence of anti-ferromagnetic interactions via exchange bridges between the adjacent Ni3 units. No divergence between the zero-eld- cooled (ZFC) and eld-cooled (FC) magnetization, and thus no long-range magnetic ordering of 6 at low temperature (Fig. S8 in the ESI†), was observed. Conclusions In this paper, we have presented the synthesis and crystal structures of six coordination polymers generated from mixed- ligand systems of H3tm and positional isomeric dipyridyl bridging ligands (4,40-Hbpt, 3,40-Hbpt and 3,30-Hbpt), reacted with Zn(II), Cd(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) salts. The structural diversities indicate that the trimellitic acid (H3tm) and the diﬀerently oriented pyridyl N atoms in these triazole-containing bpt isomers, as well as the metal-directing eﬀect play dominating roles in modulating the formation of structures of these crystal- line materials. Diﬀerent from our previous work,17 tm with three carboxylate groups exhibits more coordination patterns. And the tm linker can be act as bent building blocks like o-BDC, m-BDC and linear building blocks like p-BDC simultaneously. As a result, more diverse and interesting architectures than before were obtained: 1 and 5 both have a 3D 4-connected topology, with (4.64.8)(42.63.8)2(44.62)2 Schl¨ai symbol for 1 and (42.52.72)- ( 52.62.7.8)2(4.52.6.72)2 symbol for 5, respectively. 2 and 3 both have a 3D (4,5)-topology, with (34.42.52)2(42.84)(3.43.52.6.72.8)2 Schl¨ai symbol for 2 and (34.42.52)2(42.84)(3.43.52.6.72.8)2 symbol for 3, respectively. 4 has a 3D trinodal (3,4,5)-connected net with the short Schl¨ai symbol of (3.44.53.6.7)(43.62.7)(44.62) (42.6)2(45.64.8)2. 6 reveal a 2D (3,4)-connected layer with the short Schl¨ai symbol of (3.62)2(3.4.62.72)2(5.63.82). Accordingly, our present ndings will further enrich the crystal engineering strategy and oﬀer the possibility of controlling the formation of the desired network structures.
