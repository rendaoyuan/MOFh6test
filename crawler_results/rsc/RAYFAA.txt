Commun., 2012, 48, 5736–5738 Self-assembly of unprecedented [8 + 12] Cu-metallamacrocycle-based 3D metal–organic frameworksw Zhouqing Xu,ab Qiang Wang,b Huijun Li,a Wei Meng,a Yi Han,a Hongwei Hou*a and Yaoting Fana Received 2nd March 2012, Accepted 20th April 2012 DOI: 10.1039/c2cc31590d [8 + 12]-metallamacrocycle-based 3D frameworks {[Cu4(pbt)2- (SO4)2(DMF)2(CH3OH)]7H2ODMF}n (1) and [12]-macrocycle 3D {[Cu2(pbt)(SO4)(DMSO)(CH3OH)2]5H2OCH3OH}n (2) have been obtained. Both complexes display antiferromagnetic couplings and high catalytic activity in the oxidative coupling reaction of 1-ethynylbenzene and oxazolidin-2-one. Cu-based polynuclear complexes have drawn tremendous attention, mainly due, on one hand, to the fact that Cu is an essential bioelement responsible for numerous catalytic processes in living organisms1 and, on the other hand, to the possibility of exploring magneto-structural correlations resulting from the mutual inter- action among metal centers.2 To date, a great many of Cu-based polynuclear materials, such as tetranuclear,3 pentanuclear,4 hexanuclear,5 and heptanuclear6 complexes have been success- fully achieved. In these complexes, the Cu(II) ions display either a tetrahedral geometry, a trigonal-bipyramidal motif, a square-pyramidal coordination, or an octahedral geometry,7 which possibly make Cu(II) ions assist the ligand to construct not only high-nuclearity but also metallamacrocycle complexes.8 Nevertheless, Cu-based metallamacrocycles have been rarely reported.9 In fact, polynuclear metallamacrocycles have promising applications in many areas such as molecular recognition,10 gas storage,11 magnetism,12 and catalysis13 owing to their high-nuclearity and macrocyclic nature. To obtain Cu-based metallamacrocycles, it is desirable to select organic linkers with suitable shape, functionality and symmetry. It is well known that the triazole ring possesses aromaticity and multiple coordinating modes, which can oﬀer multiple coordinating sites for bridging closely situated metal ions, sustaining a diversity of polynuclear and even macrocyclic motifs.14 Furthermore, we think that triazole derivatives should be appropriate ligands favouring the occurrence of polynuclear macrocycles. Taking this into account, 50-(pyridin-2-yl)-2H,40H-3,30-bi(1,2,4-triazole) (H2pbt), an asymmetric triazolate derivative which contains three potential bidentate chelating sites and a monodentate one, may be a good candidate because the multiple N atoms facilitate the construction of polynuclear macrocycles. Herein, we employed H2pbt and CuSO45H2O to achieve two novel dodecanuclear Cu metallamacrocycle-based 3D metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) {[Cu4(pbt)2(SO4)2(DMF)2(CH3OH)]7H2ODMF}n (1) and {[Cu2(pbt)(SO4)(DMSO)(CH3OH)2]5H2OCH3OH}n (2). Reaction of H2pbt and CuSO45H2O in MeOH–DMF gives rise to complex 1. Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that 1 shows a 3D non-interpenetrated network and crystallizes in a trigonal system, space group R%3. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of four crystallographically independent Cu(II), two deprotonated pbt2 ligands, two coordinated SO4 2 anions, two coordinated DMF molecules, one terminal MeOH molecule and seven lattice water molecules as well as one solvated MeOH molecule. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESIw), all Cu(II) ions are ﬁve- coordinated and adopt slightly distorted square-pyramidal geometry. Cu1, Cu2 and Cu3 ions are all surrounded by three N atoms of two pbt2 ligands (N6, N10, N12 for Cu1; N3, N5, N13 for Cu2; N7A, N8, N9 for Cu3, respectively) and two O atoms (O3, O8C from two bridging SO4 2 anions for Cu1, O6 of a bridging SO4 2 anion and O7 of a methanol molecule for Cu2, O1 from SO4 2 and O10 from a DMF molecule for Cu3, respectively). The ﬁve atoms coordinated to Cu4 ion consist of two N atoms (N1, N2) from one ligand, O4B and O6 atoms from two bridging SO4 2 and O11 atom from a DMF molecule. Notably, there are two distinct modes of pbt2 arranged alternately. One acts as a tridentate ligand binding to three Cu(II) ions through two chelate bonds and one monodentate linkage (Scheme 1aw), and the other connects four Cu(II) ions by two chelate junctions and two monodentate attachments (Scheme 1bw). Each sulfate anion in 1 connects three Cu(II) ions adopting a m3,Z1:Z1:Z1-coordination mode. In 1, two asymmetric units form a chair-shaped octanuclear metallamacrocycle-based building block (Fig. S2w). Each octa- nuclear macrocycle building block connects four adjoining ones along diﬀerent orientations using Cu–N bonds via the two Cu1 and two Cu2 ions to give rise to the unique Cu metalla- macrocycle-based 3D complex 1 (Fig. S3w). More interestingly, six octanuclear macrocycle building blocks interconnect via adjacent Cu1 and Cu2 ions to yield a 48-nuclear wheel-like unit (Fig. 1a). The inwall of the wheel-like unit forms a crown-like a Department of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Henan 450052, P. R. China.

In addition, the remaining Cu1 and Cu2 ions of the octanuclear block connect two other octanuclear blocks to form another wheel- like unit. Therefore, each dodecameric macrocycle takes along six octanuclear blocks and meanwhile the two pairs of Cu1 and Cu3 of each octanuclear block belong to two diﬀerent dodecameric macrocycles (Fig. 1). In the dodecameric Cu macrocycle, alternant three pairs of Cu1 and Cu3 ions lie in one plane, and the distance of the two planes is 3.0144(1) A˚ . Across the dodecanuclear macrocycle, the distance of opposite two Cu1 ions and two Cu3 ions is 19.1177(1) and 18.3270(1) A˚ , respectively. Viewed from the c-axis, 1 shows cylindrical channels encompassing a considerable solvent accessible volume of ca. 12460 A˚ 3 per unit cell corre- sponding to 46.0% (after solvated molecules have been removed) of the cell volume as calculated by PLATON15 (Fig. S3w). To better understand the 3D structure of 1, if the octanuclear building block is considered as a four-connected node, the overall structure of 1 exhibits an nbo topology with the Schla¨ ﬂi symbol of 6482 (Fig. S4w). It is imperative to note here that, right- and left-handed helical channels are present alternately around the cylindrical voids by sharing octanuclear building blocks (Fig. 2). All the helices are arranged by octanuclear building blocks one by one with a pitch of 18.277 A˚ which is the same as the length of the c-axis. Because of the cuboid-shaped octanuclear building block, all the helices in 1 are double-walled, which are diﬀerent from usual helical chains. It is well known that solvents could aﬀect the coordination behavior of the metal ions and the ligands,16 which ﬁnally determine the connectivity and dimensionality of the overall networks. Inspired by this, we investigated the inﬂuence of solvents to the reaction system of H2pbt and CuSO45H2O, and complex 2 was obtained in MeOH–DMSO. Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis shows that 2 also crystallizes in trigonal space symmetry, R%3, and exhibits a 3D open framework with cylindrical channels along the c-axis. In view of the coordination modes of the tectons, complex 2 has mainly three diﬀerences from 1: (a) 2 contains two types of Cu(II) ions, Cu1 ion adopts a square-pyramidal geometry while Cu2 ion has an octahedral geometry; (b) all the SO4 2 bond two Cu(II) ions in a m2,Z1:Z1-coordination mode; (c) each pbt2 adopting the mode shown in Scheme 1bw links four Cu ions (Fig. S5w). In terms of construction, though both complexes contain dodecanuclear metallamacrocycles, the connected fashion of these metallamacrocycles is very diﬀerent in 1 and 2: two dodecanuclear metallamacrocycles in 1 are linked by Cu2 and Cu4 ions, SO4 2 anions, and pbt2 ligands of an octanuclear metallamacrocycle building block whereas dodecanuclear metallamacrocycles are connected by pbt2 ligands directly in 2. In 2, if the fragment formed by one pbt2, two Cu(II) ions, one SO4 2 and termenal solvent molecules is considered as a constructing block (Fig. S5w), adjacent Cu1 and Cu2 ions sharing the same constructing block are alternately connected by triazole of a pbt2 ligand to form a crown-like dodeca- nuclear macrocycle building block. The dodecanuclear macro- cycle is similar to that of 1 except that the distance is 3.8836 A˚ for two planes, 17.3685 A˚ for two Cu1 ions and 17.9189 A˚ for two Cu2 ions (Fig. S6w). The dodecanuclear macrocycles are parallel and arranged layer by layer. Each dodecanuclear macrocycle connects six adjoining ones via pbt2 along diﬀerent orientations to generate an unusual 3D coordination architec- ture (Fig. S7w). A better insight into the nature of the frame- work can be achieved by application of a topological approach. Taking each constructing block as three-connected node, the network can be described as a 3-conneted etb topology with Schla¨ ﬂi symbol of 83 (Fig. S6w). Similar to 1, left- and right- handed helical chains are present in 2, except that the helical chains are single-walled (Fig. 3). The molar magnetic susceptibilities for 1 and 2 in the high- temperature range obey the Curie–Weiss law giving Curie constants C = 1.67 and 0.96 cm3 K mol1 and negative Weiss Fig. 1 (a) View of the 48-nuclear wheel-like unit along the c-axis, (b) view of the relationship of octanuclear building block and the 42-membered dodecameric macrocycles in 1.

Commun., 2012, 48, 5736–5738 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 constants y = 78.29, 82.84 K, respectively (Fig. S9 and S10w). Given their square-pyramidal or octahedral coordina- tion geometry, the Cu atoms are assumed to have the dx2y2 orbital as the magnetic orbital and the bridging ligands bonded in the xy plane. General agreement exists that the dominant pathway for antiferromagnetic exchange in diazene- bridged systems is provided by s bonding between Cu dx2y2 and bridging ligand orbitals. Previous magneto-structural considerations have identiﬁed that a higher symmetry of the double diazene bridge aﬀords a more eﬀective overlap between the Cu magnetic orbitals, resulting in a stronger antiferromagnetism.17 Judging from the structures of 1 and 2, we speculate that there is strong antiferromagnetism between the Cu atoms, which is also consistent with the values of y. The nanometer-sized tunnels of the metallamacrocycle- based complexes 1 and 2 can accommodate large amounts of organic molecules, which should make catalysis reaction feasible. Subsequently, we studied the catalytic properties of these two complexes. The oxidative coupling reaction of 1-ethynylbenzene and oxazolidin-2-one18 was investigated at 75 1C by using a small quantity of complexes 1 and 2 as catalysts. Colorless powder product 3-(2-phenylethynyl)oxazolidin-2-one could be obtained in a yield of 78% for 1 and 66% for 2. The results reveal that these two complexes show higher catalytic activity than CuBr reported in the literature in the oxidative coupling reaction,19 which provide further evidence that metal–organic frameworks can be utilized as eﬀective heterogeneous catalysts. In summary, two unprecedented metallamacrocycle-based 3D frameworks have been obtained. Further research demon- strates that both complexes display antiferromagnetic couplings and high catalytic activity in the oxidative coupling reaction of 1-ethynylbenzene and oxazolidin-2-one.

Materials and methods All chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used as received without purification except the anhydrous solvents. IR data were recorded on a BRUKER TENSOR 27 spectrophotometer with KBr pellets in the region of 400–4000 cm-1. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were carried out on a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer. Themogravimetric analyses were carried out with a NETZSCH STA 409 unit at a heating rate of 10 °C min-1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. X-ray powder diffraction measurements were recorded on a Philips X’pert PRO SUPER X-ray diffractometer using graphite monochromatized CuKα radiation (λ = 1.541874 Å). 2. Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction Analyses Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data was collected from a turquoise rhombus crystal for 1 and a blue block for 2, respectively, sealed in a capillary at room temperature (296 K) on a Bruker SMART Apex II CCD-based X-ray diffractometer system equipped with graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka radiation generated from a sealed tube (0.71073 Å). The Bruker SMART1 program was used for analysis of the data collection, and SAINT2 was used for the cell refinement, and reduction. Absorption corrections were applied using SADABS3. All of the structures were solved by direct methods and refined to convergence by least squares method on F2 using the SHELXTL4 software suit. Non-hydrogen atoms except some terminal solvent molecules and solvated water molecules were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters during the final cycles. All hydrogen except for solvated water molecules were placed in calculated positions and refined by applying a riding model; it was not possible to find the hydrogen atoms of the water molecules. The distances and angles in the terminal DMF, MeOH and water molecules for 1 and DMSO and MeOH molecules for 2, respectively, were restrained using DFIX, SIMU, DELU and ISOR during the leastsquares refinement because of poor geometry. In structures with voids, attempts to locate and model the highly disordered solvent Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 molecules in the voids were unsuccessful. Therefore, the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON5 was used to remove the diffraction contribution from these solvents to produce a set of solvent-free diffraction intensities. The large volume fraction of disordered solvents was calculated by PALTON SOLV CALC5 to 12450.8 Å3 and 4833.3 Å3 which corresponds to 46.0% and 35.9% of the unit cell volume for 1 and 2, respectively. 3. Synthesis procedures 3.1 Synthesis of {[Cu4(pbt)2(SO4)2(DMF)2(CH3OH)]·7H2O·DMF}n (1) A MeOH solution of CuSO4·5H2O (9.6 mg in 3 mL) was carefully layered onto a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of H2pbt (6.3 mg in 3 mL). After the solution was allowed to stand for about 7 days, the turquoise rhombus crystals formed were isolated in 73% yield by filtration. Elemental analysis data calcd for {[Cu4(pbt)2(SO4)2(DMF)2(CH3OH)]·7H2O·DMF}n (1) (C28H49N17S2Cu4O19) : C:26.98, H:3.96, N:19.10; found C 26.12, H 3.03, N 20.14. IR (KBr, cm–1): 3440, 1652, 1616, 1570, 1463, 1434, 1312, 1114, 1042, 796, 754, 718, 647, 594. 3.2 Synthesis of {[Cu2(pbt)(SO4)(DMSO)(CH3OH)2]·5H2O·CH3OH }n (2) Complex 2 was synthesized adopting a procedure similar to that for 1, except that the solvent DMF was replaced by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Blue rectangular crystals of 2 were obtained in 46% yield. Elemental analysis data calcd for {[Cu2(pbt)(SO4)(DMSO)(CH3OH)2]·5H2O·CH3OH}n (2) (Cu2C14H33N7O13S2): C:24.07, H:4.76, N:14.03; found C:23.63, H:3.88, N:15.88, IR (KBr, cm–1): 3339, 1616, 1570, 1462, 1434, 1313, 1196, 1116, 1030, 951, 795, 754, 718, 648, 594. Compounds 1 and 2 are all insoluble in water and common organic solvents but efflorescent in air. The similarity between the PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized bulk crystals and that simulated from the single-crystal structure of as synthesized indicates that the single-crystal structure represents the bulk crystal samples. They were characterized by elemental microanalysis, IR spectroscopy, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) Figure (Figure S11, S12) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure S13). Note: the solvent molecules for 1 and 2 were estimated from the result of PLATON Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 –SQUEEZE, the TG data, and the data of elemental analyses, and were included in the molecular formula directly. 4. Magnetic properties measurement Magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out for 1 and 2 in a temperature range from 2.8 to 300K in a 2000 Oe applied field. The magnetic properties of complex 1 and 2 as χmT vs. T and χm -1 vs. T plot (χm is the molar magnetic susceptibility) are shown in Figure S9 and Figure S10. As shown in Figure S9, the χmT value at room temperature in 1 is 1.33 cm3 K mol-1, which is lower than the spin-only value of 1.5 cm3 K mol-1 expected for four magnetically uncoupled Cu(II) ions (S = 1/2), and the χmT values decrease first slowly and then rapidly, reaching a maximum of 0.24 cm3 K mol-1 at around 2.8 K. This behavior suggests the existence of antiferromagnetic exchange behavior. The χmT value for 2 at 300 K is 0.77 cm3 K mol-1, significantly lower than the spin-only value of 0.75 cm3 K mol-1 expected for two magnetically isolated Cu(II) ions (S = 1/2). By decreasing the temperature, the χmT gradually decreases reaching 0.0449 cm3 K mol-1 at 2.7 K, suggesting a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction between the Cu(II) centers. The abrupt increasing of XmT at lower temperature indicates that a small amount of paramagnetic impurity exists, which is a common phenomena in this type of system. Similar explanation has been reported by G. Arom.6 5.

The reaction flask was purged with oxygen gas for 15 Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 N N N N N N N M b M M M N N N N N N N M a M M minutes. A balloon filled with oxygen gas was connected to the reaction flask via a needle. The flask was placed in an oil-bath and heated to 75 °C. A solution of phenylacetylene (0.2 mmol, 20.2 mg) in 2.0 ml dry toluene was added to the flask over 4 h by using a syringe pump. After the addition of phenylacetylene/toluene solution, the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at 75 ºC for another 4 h and then cooled to room temperature. After the crude mixture was concentrated under vacuum, the reaction mixture was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel with hexanes/ethyl acetate (7/3) to yield the principal product 3-(2-phenylethynyl)oxazolidin-2-one (29.2 mg, 78% yield for complex 1 and 24.7 mg, 66% yield for complex 2). Colorless solid 3-(2-phenylethynyl)-oxazolidin-2-one was characterized by IR: 3423(m), 2965(m), 2911(m), 2265(s), 1758(s), 1472(m), 1423(s), 1218(s), 1163(m), 1091(m), 1023(m), 748(s), 690(s), and 1HNMR: δ 7.46-7.43 (m, 2H), 7.32-7.29 (m, 3H), 4.50-4.45 (m, 2H), 4.02-3.97 (m, 2H). 6.
