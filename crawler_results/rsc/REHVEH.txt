Manuscript Dynamic porous metal–organic frameworks: synthesis, structure and sorption property{ Chao Hou,a Qing Liu,a Taka-aki Okamura,b Peng Wanga and Wei-Yin Sun*a Received 21st July 2012, Accepted 10th October 2012 DOI: 10.1039/c2ce26533h Three new porous metal–organic frameworks {[Co(L)(PIN)]?dioxane?H2O}n (1), {[Co(L)(DPE)]?0.5DPE}n (2) and {[Co(L)(BPE)]?4H2O}n (3) with the same 2-fold interpenetrating hms topology based on 5-(pyridin-4-yl)isophthalate (L22) and different pillar ligands of N-(4- pyridyl)isonicotinamide (PIN), 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene (DPE) and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (BPE) have been prepared and characterized by IR, thermogravimetric analysis, single crystal and powder X-ray diffractions. Interestingly, 1 possesses a flexible framework upon desolvation and H2O/MeOH/ EtOH vapor adsorption, and the desolvated sample exhibits a stepwise uptake of CO2 (195 K), H2O (298 K) and MeOH (298 K). More importantly, the desolvated 1 shows high enthalpy of CO2 adsorption and high selectivity for CO2 over N2 as well as H2O/MeOH over EtOH at 298 K. Introduction During the last decade, porous coordination polymers (PCPs) or metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) emerging as a new class of porous material have attracted considerable attention and motivated researchers to explore smarter materials in many research fields.1,2 These kinds of materials are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas storage and separation due to their acceptable thermal stability, large surface area, adjustable pore size and controllable properties.3 Especially the PCPs/ MOFs with flexible and dynamic features are of special interest because the host frameworks can show structural rearrange- ments during sorption processes. Such structural transformation is ultimately realized by the pore deformation and can be realized by several dynamic behaviors, such as sliding motion between the networks, rotation or distortion of the organic linkers, geometric change around the metal ions.4–6 Flexible MOFs provide new and versatile gas storage, separation and guest exchange applications because of their better recognition and structural transformation abilities than those of the rigid ones.7 In particular, the combination of flexibility and functionalized surface enables effective selectivity.8 Herein, we report three new porous MOFs {[Co(L)(PIN)]?dioxane?H2O}n (1), {[Co(L)(DPE)]?0.5DPE}n (2) and {[Co(L)(BPE)]?4H2O}n (3) constructed by reactions of Co(NO3)2?6H2O with 5-(pyridin-4-yl)isophthalic acid (H2L) and different pillar ligands of N-(4-pyridyl)isonicotinamide (PIN), 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene (DPE) and 1,2-bis(4-pyridy- l)ethane (BPE). All the complexes have the same three- dimensional (3D) framework structures with hms topology. Interestingly, 1 with pores decorated by acylamide groups shows framework flexibility upon desolvation and H2O/MeOH/EtOH vapor adsorption. The desolvated framework of 1 exhibits a stepwise uptake of CO2 (195 K), H2O (298 K) and MeOH (298 K). More importantly, the desolvated 1 shows high enthalpy of CO2 adsorption and high selectivity for CO2 over N2 as well as H2O/MeOH over EtOH at 298 K, which make it be a good candidate for practical application in gas/vapor separation. Experimental Materials and methods All commercially available chemicals and solvents are of reagent grade and were used as received without further purification. The ligand H2L was synthesized according to the literature.9 Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C Elemental Analyzer at the analysis center of Nanjing University. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a simultaneous SDT 2960 thermal analyzer under nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 uC min21. FT-IR spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm21 on a Bruker Vector22 FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.5418 A˚ ), in which the X-ray tube was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA at room temperature. Sorption experiments were carried out on a Belsorp-max volumetric gas sorption instrument. aCoordination Chemistry Institute, State Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing National Laboratory of Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.

Structural data collections for com- plexes 1–3 were made on a Rigaku Rapid II imaging plate area detector with Mo Ka radiation (0.71075 A˚ ) using a MicroMax- 007HF microfocus rotating anode X-ray generator and VariMax-Mo optics at 200 K. The structures of 1–3 were solved by direct methods with SIR92 and expanded using Fourier techniques.10 Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. For 1, the hydrogen atoms of water molecules were located directly, while all the other hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically and refined isotropically using the riding model. For 2, all the hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically and refined isotropically using the riding model. For 3, the hydrogen atoms of water molecules with O5, O6, O7 and O8 were not found from the difference Fourier map, while all the other hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically and refined isotropically using the riding model. Atoms N20, C20, C22, C23, C24, C25, C26, C32, C33, C34, C35 and C36 in 1 are disordered into two positions with site occupancies of 0.667(8) and 0.333(8), while the O6, C61 and C62 also have two disordered positions with site occupancies of 0.724(9) and 0.276(9), and the O7, C71 and C72 ones are disordered into three positions with site occupancies of 0.196(8), 0.390(9) and 0.413(9). The free DPE molecule in 2 was found near to the inversion center as disordered structures and atoms N41, C40, C42, C43, C44, C45 and C46 are disordered into two positions, each with site occupancy of 0.50.

All calculations were performed using the CrystalStructure crystallographic software package except for refinement, which was performed using SHELXL-97.11 The details of the crystal parameters, data collection and refinements for the complexes are summarized in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. Results and discussion Crystal structures of {[Co(L)(PIN)]?dioxane?H2O}n (1), {[Co(L)(DPE)]?0.5DPE}n (2) and {[Co(L)(BPE)]?4H2O}n (3) The results of crystallographic analysis indicate that complexes 1–3 have the same framework structure, although they crystallize in monoclinic space group C2/c (1 and 2) and orthorhombic space group Fdd2 (3), respectively (Table 1). Thus only the structure of complex 1 is described here in detail. The asymmetric unit of 1 is composed of one Co(II), one L22, one PIN, one dioxane and one free H2O molecule. As depicted in Fig. 1a, the central Co(II) atom in 1 possesses a distorted octahedral coordination geometry formed by two oxygen atoms (O1A and O2A) from one L22 ligand, one oxygen atom (O3B) and one nitrogen atom (N11) from another two distinct L22 ligands, and two nitrogen atoms (N31 and N21C) from two different PIN ligands. The Co1–O bond lengths range from 2.0949(16) to 2.2911(17) A˚ , and the Co1–N ones are in the range of 2.1462(18)–2.1566(18) A˚ (Table 2). On the other hand, each L22 ligand in 1 acts as a m3-bridge to link three Co(II) atoms: the nitrogen atom of pyridine links the first Co(II), one carboxylate group adopting a m1-g1:g1 chelate mode connects the second Co(II) and the other carboxylate group adopting a m1-g1:g0 monodentate mode ligates the third Co(II). Interestingly, the coordination interactions between the Co(II) and L22 ligand form a two-dimensional (2D) 63-hcb network in the ab plane with Co…Co separations of 11.40 (Co1…Co1A and Co1…Co1B) and 9.94 A˚ (Co1A…Co1B) (Fig. 1b). The layers are further pillared by PIN ligands to form a three-dimensional (3D) framework, as illustrated in Fig. 1c. It is worth noting that there are one-dimensional (1D) open channels with size about 13.5 6 10.3 A˚ along the b axis, and the potential voids are filled via mutual interpenetration of the other equivalent framework, generating a 2-fold interpenetrating 3D architecture (Fig. 1d). In other words, the whole structure of 1 is a 3D structure with 2-fold interpenetrating structure. The void volume of complex 1 without guest molecules is 1541.2 A˚ 3, 28.6% (1419.8 A˚ 3, 27.0% for 2 and 2689.3 A˚ 3, 25.4% for 3) per unit cell calculated by PLATON.12 A better insight into the nature of this intricate architecture can be achieved by the application of the topological approach.13 As described above, each Co(II) atom is connected by three L22 ligands and two PIN ligands, thus, it can be considered as a five- connected node. Each L22 or PIN ligand in turn connects three or two Co(II) atoms, respectively, hence, they can be regarded as three- or two-connectors, respectively. Such connectivity repeats infinitely to give the 3D framework as schematically shown in Fig. 1e. According to the simplification principle, the resulted structure of 1 is a (3,5)-connected binodal net. Topology analysis by the TOPOS program14 suggests the point (Schla¨fli) symbol of the net is (63)(69.8) which is a typical hms topology. The net has been observed only in several MOFs.15 One of the most remarkable features of this net is self-duality, so it is easy to form a 2-fold interpenetrating framework.16 Thermal stabilities of the complexes Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out for the complexes and the results of the TGA are shown in Fig. S1, ESI.{ Complex 1 shows a weight loss of 17.15% before 225 uC corresponding to the release of the free water and dioxane molecules (calcd 17.53%). Further weight losses were observed at ca. 350 uC owing to the decomposition of the framework (Fig. S1a, ESI{). As shown in Fig. S1b, ESI,{ the weight loss of 2 was found before 268 uC due to the release of DPE molecule with a weight loss of 15.49% (calcd 15.89%), and then the framework decomposes. In complex 3, a weight loss of 12.54% (calcd 12.95%) was observed before 100 uC which corresponds to the release of free water molecules, and the residue is stable up to ca. 270 uC. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and the dynamic nature The phase purity of the bulk products of the complexes is further confirmed by PXRD measurements, and each PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized sample is consistent with the simulated one. Fig. 2 shows the PXRD patterns of the complexes under different conditions. For complex 1, the desolvated framework exhibits changes in peak positions and the emergence of new peaks compared to the as-synthesized one (Fig. 2a). Indexing of the powder pattern by using the TREOR program17 of the desolvated sample suggests a monoclinic crystal system with a = 19.902(24) A˚ , b = 6.412(8) A˚ , c = 12.645(10) A˚ , b = 118.12(5)u and V = 1423.30 A˚ 3, indicating the structural distortion in 1 after removal of the water and dioxane molecules (see ESI{). Also, PXRD patterns of 1 exposed to the different solvent vapors exhibit some changes in peak position and the appearance of some new peaks at low angles suggesting the structural rearrangements upon inclusion of the solvent molecules. All of the structural transformations may be realized by sliding motion of the interpenetration of the framework.18 However, complexes 2 and 3 show different behaviors upon guest molecule removal from that of 1. In 2, the voids in the channels are occupied by the free DPE ligands. Different methods were used to eliminate the guest DPE molecules, for example solid–liquid extraction by refluxing in a variety of solvents, or using a substitute template guest like toluene or pyridine, however, obtaining a DPE-free framework was unsuccessful. While in the case of 3, the free H2O molecules are released at 100 uC as shown in the TG curve of 3 (Fig. S1b, ESI{), and it becomes amorphous when the complex 3 was heated at 85 uC under vacuum and could not be recovered by H2O vapor adsorption (Fig. 2c). The results imply that complex 3 is not a flexible framework upon dehydration and rehydration. The results demonstrate that complexes 1–3 have different flexibility and stability even if they have the same framework structures. Sorption property of complex 1 The porosity and flexibility of 1 prompted us to examine its gas/ vapor uptake behavior.

The activated samples were prepared by heating the complex at 105 uC under vacuum for 10 h. Fig. S2, ESI,{ shows sorption isotherms of N2 at 77 K up to 1 atm for complex 1, which is a type III sorption profile, suggesting that only surface adsorption occurred. Interestingly, the CO2 gas sorption isotherm at 195 K measured up to 1 atm exhibits two steps with little hysteresis for desorption (Fig. 3). The first step at P , 0.032 atm provides the surface area of 244 m2 g21 as estimated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) methods. In the second step at P . 0.032 atm, the isotherm shows a slow increase and then finally attains saturation with the adsorbed CO2 amount of 92 cm3 g21 (18.1 wt%) at 0.99 atm, corresponding to 2.05 CO2 molecules per formula unit. The BET surface area estimated by the second step is 310 m2 g21. The obvious hysteresis as well as stepwise process of CO2 adsorption isotherms of complex 1 is attributed to the flexibility of the framework.19a At ca. 0.032 atm, CO2 molecules, which have quadrupole moment (21.4 6 10239 cm2), induce structural transformation of the framework.19b,c More interestingly, the CO2 uptake is 8.18 wt% (41.65 cm3 g21) at 298 K (9.92 wt%, 50.52 cm3 g21 at 273 K), but almost no N2 adsorption was observed for 1 (0.08 wt%, 0.61 cm3 g21 at 298 K and 1 atm, Fig. 2 The PXRD patterns for 1 (a), 2 (b) and 3 (c).

The CO2 adsorption amount on the desolvated 1 is lower than the best MOF for CO2 storage (MOF-74-Mg: 35.2%),20 but still comparable to those of IR-MOF-1121 (7.92 wt%, 40.34 cm3 g21) and SNU-21H22 (9.65 wt%, 49.16 cm3 g21) under similar conditions. The selectivity of CO2/N2 at 298 K is 68 : 1 (v/v) at 1 atm which is higher than those for the most of the reported MOFs.23 At 0.16 atm (a pressure close to the CO2 concentration in a power plant flue gas stream),24 the ratio of CO2/N2 adsorption amount of 1 is 110, which is lower than the value for the MOF [Zn2(BPDC)2(DPE)] (BPDC22 = 4,49-biphenyl dicar- boxylate) with recording CO2 selectivity (294 : 1),25 but it still matches with those of [Zn2(BPDC)2(BPE)]n (99 : 1)26 and [Ni(DCPY)(BIPY)0.5]n (DCPY = 3-(29,59-dicarboxylphenyl)pyr- idine, BIPY = 4,49-bipyridine, 106 : 1).27 The excellent CO2 adsorption selectivity and capacity of 1 allow potential use in the capture of CO2 from industrial flue gas or the removal of CO2 from natural gas. In addition, the stepwise CO2 sorption isotherms of 1 at 195 K and the non-stepwise ones at 273 and 298 K are a characteristic feature of the dynamic frame- works.8d,18a The distinct difference of adsorption capacity between CO2 and N2 prompts us to study the enthalpy of CO2 adsorption. The isosteric heats (Qst) of CO2 adsorption were calculated by the virial method (see the ESI{) using experimental isotherms at 273 and 298 K (Fig. S3, ESI{). It shows that Qst exhibits a maximum of 36.3 kJ mol21 at initial coverage. The high Qst value places 1 among a group of MOFs having the highest recorded CO2 binding affinity, including amino-MIL-53 (Al) (38.4 kJ mol21),28a MIL-53(Al) (35 kJ mol21),28b bio-MOF-11 (45 kJ mol21),28c and MOF-74-Co (37 kJ mol21).20 The high initial binding energy of 1 can be mainly attributed to the strong interactions between the acylamide groups and the CO2 molecules, which is consistent with the acylamide-functionalized MOFs.29 In addition, the high Qst for CO2 is also benefited from the small channel sizes of 1, because the framework–CO2 interactions can be augmented in small pores, owing to the overlap of potential fields from multiple sides of the pore walls which results in a higher affinity for CO2.30 Inspired by the different gas (N2 and CO2) sorption behaviors, we studied the vapor sorption property of 1 in different vapors with different polarity and size such as H2O (kinetic diameter, 2.65 A˚ ), MeOH (3.8 A˚ ) and EtOH (4.3 A˚ ) (Fig. 5). The H2O adsorption profile undergoes distinct steps at p y 0.41 and 0.94 atm, respectively. The final unsaturated adsorbed amount is ca. 233.49 cm3 g21 (187.72 mg g21) corresponding to 5.20 water molecules per formula unit. The value is relatively lower than those of other reported MOFs31 under the same conditions, which may be ascribed to the small cavity volume of complex 1. However, the H2O vapor uptake capacity of 1 at 298 K and 1 atm is comparable with those of the MOFs with small cavity volume and flexible frameworks at 1 atm.32,33 Interestingly, the desorption isotherm does not retrace the adsorption one showing large hysteresis. The large hysteresis and stepwise process of H2O adsorption profile of complex 1 is characteristic of the dynamic micro- porosity of flexible MOFs.33,34 As described above, the changes of PXRD patterns suggest structural distortion of complex 1 after desolvation (Fig. 2a). When adsorbate water molecules access the framework, diffusion barriers caused by the structural distortion require activation energy.35 The abrupt adsorption at approximately P = 0.42 atm for water adsorption represents the ‘‘break-through’’ point, where sufficient pressure exists to overcome the diffusion barrier through adsorbate–adsorbent interactions. Moreover, the large hysteresis and incomplete desorption imply the strong adsorbate–adsorbent interactions such as hydrogen bonding between the water molecules and the framework. In addition, the adsorbate–adsorbate interactions, namely the hydrogen bonds between the H2O molecules, also play an important role.35b Similarly, the MeOH vapor adsorption isotherm at 298 K shows a two-step curve with two abrupt jumps at 0.0021 and 0.1147 atm as well as a large hysteretic desorption curve (Fig. 5b). The final uptake volume of 76.44 cm3 g21 (109.34 mg g21) at P = 0.99 atm, corresponds to 1.70 MeOH molecules per formula unit, which is at a moderate level compared to the recently reported MOFs.36 Similar to H2O molecules, the driving Fig. 5 (a) The H2O adsorption isotherms for 1 at 298 K; (b) MeOH and EtOH adsorption isotherms for 1 at 298 K.

In contrast, no adsorption of EtOH occurs even in the higher relative pressure region, indicating that the gates remain closed for EtOH,35a which can be further confirmed by the consistent PXRD patterns between desolvated samples and the EtOH exposed samples (Fig. 2a). Conclusion Three isomorphous porous MOFs with 2-fold interpenetrating hms topology are successfully prepared by adopting different pillar ligands. The flexible frameworks endow complex 1 with high selective gas sorption for CO2 over N2 and high selectivity for H2O and MeOH over EtOH, indicating its potential applications in gas/vapor separation.
