Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor studies reveal sensitive and selective sensing for small molecules. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed from metal ions or metal clusters as nodes and multitopic organic ligands as linkers have received considerable attention not only because of their 15 aesthetic appeal,1 but also because of their potential applications in sensor, gas storage, separation and drug delivery.2 These functions of MOFs mainly depend on the pore size and shape, pore surface characteristics such as hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity and chirality.3 However, how to control synthesis of MOFs with expected 20 structures and properties is still a formidable challenge for chemists. It is well known that a better strategy is using functional organic ligands to introduce guest-accessible sites on the pore surface.4 The tripodal ligand, tri(2-carboxyethyl)-isocyanurate (H3tci) as a highly flexible polycarboxylate ligand has three freely rotatable – 25 CH2CH2COOH arms and three secondary functional groups (– C=O), which make it a good candidate for constructing diverse MOFs with oxygen-rich channels,5 these MOFs could be the potential sensors for sensing small solvent molecules by H-bond interactions. For sensing materials, pore-surface functionalization 30 and sensitive signal transduction when contacting to an analyte are very important. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) as a sensor device is one of mass sensitive device and could act as a suitable platform for detection of the sorption/desorption behaviour of porous materials toward an analyte vapour, its excellent selectivity 35 and sensitivity to an analyte vapour are highly dependent on the chemical natures and physical properties of the materials.6 Herein, we selected the flexible H3tci as a main ligand to synthesize new MOF, in order to increase the stability of the skeleton, the auxiliary rigid 4,4'-bipyridine (bpy) ligand was 40 introduced into the synthesis process. A new 3D MOF {[Cu4(OH)2(tci)2(bpy)2]·11H2O} (1) with O-rich channels was obtained. To the best of our knowledge, this is an example of having the largest pore volume of MOF based on tci ligand, which reveals highly sensitive sensing for small molecules. 45 An acetone solution (6 mL) containing Cu(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2 mmol) was layered upon an aqueous solution (4 mL) containing H3tci (0.1 mmol), 4,4’-bipy (0.1 mL) and triethylamine (60 μL) in test tube, blue block crystals of 1 were collected in two weeks. Thermogravity analysis of 1 reveals all guest water molecules are 50 released under 120 C, with a mass loss of approximately 12.58 % (cal. 13.36 %), and no further loss up to 250 C, then the framework gradually collapses with increasing temperature (Fig. S11). The X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) pattern of as- synthesized matched the simulated pattern well, indicating the 55 polycrystalline sample is pure phase, in addition, the PXRD patterns of acetone-activated samples and dehydrated samples obtained by heating at 100 C in vacuo indicate that the framework can maintain good crystallinity (Fig. S8). Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis reveals that 1 crystallizes 60 in the monoclinic space group C2/c. The asymmetric unit consists of two Cu2+ ions, one tci ligand, one μ3-OH, two half-bpy ligands and some free water molecules. As shown in Fig. 1, in the tetranuclear copper cluster motif, two crystallographically independent Cu2+ centers that exhibit two different coordination 65 geometry are connected by two μ3-OH and four carboxylate groups from four tci ligands to form a quasi-butterfly tetranuclear copper cluster with Cu1-O5-Cu2, Cu1-O10A-Cu2A and Cu2-O10-Cu2A bond angle of 80°, 106° and 99°, respectively, Cu1···Cu2 and Cu2···Cu2A distance of 3.321 Å and 3.013 Å, respectively. Cu1 is 70 six-coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from three individual tci ligands, one μ3-OH group and one N atom from one bpy ligand with Cu-O/N bond lengths in the normal range of 1.959 - 2.202 Å except a weak coordination of Cu1-O5 with bond length of 2.717 Å. Cu2 locates in a trigonal-bipyramidal coordination 75 geometry from two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two distinct tci ligands, two μ3-OH groups and one N from one bpy ligand. The tci ligand exhibits the cis-cis-trans chair-conformation, three carboxyl groups of the ligand are deprotonated and adopt a pentadentate coordination mode in which one carboxylate group shows a μ1-η1 80 fashion, another one adopts syn-syn-μ2-η1:η1 mode, the third carboxylate group takes μ2-η1:η2 mode (Fig. S1). Three flexible arms of the tci ligand bridge three tetranuclear copper clusters along three different directions, while each copper cluster connects six tci ligands, which finally results in a 3D structure (Fig. S2, left), 85 then the 3D framework is further reinforced by the coordinated bpy ligands (Fig. S3, right). The resultant 3D framework contains two types of channel with different sizes along the c-axis (Fig. 2a). The smaller channels are occupied by the centrosymmetric (H2O)9 aDepartment of Chemistry, College of Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China.

In the (H2O)9 cluster, O1W, O2W, O3W, O4W and O5W are hydrogen-bonded to their equivalents derived by a crystallographic inversion center 100 to form a (H2O)9 water cluster (Fig. 2b). In addition, some disordered water molecules locate in the bigger channels. The size of small channels and big channels is 3.36×10.58 Å and 11.21×12.45 Å (measured between opposite atoms), respectively. It should be noted that this framework contains three-dimensional 105 interweaving channels which lead to shrinkage of the void space (Fig. 2c). After removing all of the guest water molecules from the channels, the total accessible volume is 55.1 % per unit cell volume calculated by PLATON.7 Taking into account of the O-rich ligands and bpy ligands in 110 the walls of the channels, compound 1 could easily adsorb polar solvent molecules and aromatic molecules. Water, methanol, ethanol and benzene vapour sorption isotherms for compound 1 were measured at 298 K. As shown in Figure 3, compound 1 shows obvious hydrophilic affinity to the polar molecules, the 115 adsorbed amount of water, methanol and ethanol gradually increases with increasing pressure, and the maximum uptake is 89 mg/g (7.3 H2O molecules per formula unit) for H2O, 70 mg/g (3.2 methanol molecules per formula unit) for methanol and 73 mg/g (2.4 ethanol molecules per formula unit) for ethanol at P/P0 = 0.9, 120 respectively. All of these adsorption behaviours fit to a type II isotherm, indicating unrestricted monolayer-multilayer adsorption. In the desorption process, the isotherm profile shows a hysteresis loop for water, non-closing hysteresis for methanol and ethanol, respectively, which can be attributed to the H4 type hysteresis 125 corresponding to narrow slit-like pores.8 By contrast, at P/P0 = 0.9, compound 1 shows a maximum uptake of 21 mg/g (0.4 benzene molecules per formula unit) for benzene vapour, the value is much lower than that for polar small molecules, and the benzene adsorption maybe result from π-π interactions between 130 host and guest. In fact, the small channel in 1 is hydrophilic because many carbonyl oxygen atoms of the tci expose on the pore surface, while the big channel is polar and non-polar coexistence resulted from carbonyl oxygen atoms of the tci and bpy ligands on the pore surface (Fig. 2a). The significantly 135 different sorption capacities between polar small molecules and benzene vapour could be attributed to the fact that strong H-bond interactions formed between polar small molecule and pore surface, and the size exclusion caused by relatively small interweaving channels and larger size of benzene molecule. 140 145 150 155 Fig. 3 The adsorption (A) and desorption (D) isotherms of water, methanol, ethanol and benzene at 298 K for 1. 160 165 170 Fig. 4 Frequency response curves of compound 1 based QCM sensor to a variety of solvent vapours at air condition (298K, 65% RH). In order to further investigate the hydrophilic property of the 175 pores and possible potential sensing applications, 1-based QCM sensor was used to evaluate the response to several polar small molecules and aromatic molecules. When QCM sample sensor is exposed to an analyte vapour, the resonant frequency decreases proportionately with an increase of mass on the QCM electrode 180 according to the Sauerbrey equation.9 As shown in Figure 4, 1- based QCM sensor was exposed to a variety of solvent vapours displaying a higher response value of 5300 Hz for methanol, 6100 Hz for ethanol, 3900 Hz for acetone, 4400 Hz for acetonitrile and 1600 Hz for water in air condition (298K, 65 % relative humidity), 185 while for non-polarity aromatic molecules of benzene, methylbenzene, ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene, the frequency Page 2 of 5 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 31 March 2015.

These results indicate compound 1 as potential sensor has high response and good selectivity to polar small molecules. Here, in order to evaluate the 190 adsorption capacity of a variety of solvent vapours for compound 1, we assume that the relative quantity of adsorbed water molecule is 1, then methanol is 1.71, ethanol is 1.36, acetone is 0.98, acetonitrile is 0.79, benzene, methylbenzene, ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene are 0.23, 0.09, 0.08 and 0.07 (Fig. S6). The 195 frequency shift value and adsorption capacity for water are relative lower than those for methanol and ethanol, which may be due to the influence of air humidity. 200 205 210 Fig. 5 Plots of χMT vs. T for 1 under applied field of 2 kOe. The solid lines represent the theoretical fitting. 215 Magnetic susceptibilities of 1 were measured under fields of 2 kOe in the temperature range of 2-300 K (Fig. 5). The observed χMT value at room temperature is 1.36 cm3 K mol–1, which is a little less than the theoretical values of 1.5 cm3 K mol1 for four uncoupled Cu2+ ions. Upon cooling, the χMT value gradually 220 decreases and reaches a value of 0.65 cm3 K mol1 at 16 K, and then rapidly decreases to 0.42 cm3 mol–1 K at 2 K, which indicates strong Cu2+···Cu2+ antiferromagnetic interactions in 1. The data above 100 K fit well with the Curie-Weiss law to give C = 1.45 cm3 K mol–1 and θ = – 28.61 K. The negative Weiss constant 225 indicates antiferromagnetic interactions between copper (II) centers in 1. In order to further study the interactions between the copper centers, the χMT–T data was fitted to the theoretical expression for quasi-butterfly Cu4 model (J1, J2, J3),10 to give J1 = 3.83 cm–1, J2 = – 67.60 cm–1, J3 = – 1.18 cm–1, and g = 2.22. The positive J1 value 230 indicates weak ferromagnetic interaction between Cu1 and Cu2 as well as Cu1A and Cu2A, resulting from small bond angle of 80° for Cu1-Ocarboxylate-Cu2, the large J2 is negative value, indicating strong antiferromagnetic interaction for Cu2-Cu2A mediated via two OH, while J3 is also negative value, illustrating the couplings 235 between Cu1 and Cu2A as well as Cu1A and Cu2 are also antiferromagnetic.11 Due to the dominant antiferromagnetic interactions in Cu4 cluster, the overall antiferromagnetic coupling is exhibited in compound 1. In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized a new porous 240 MOF based on a flexible tripodal ligand and tetranuclear copper cluster with intracluster dominant antiferromagnetic interactions. This MOF has the largest void space for tci ligand and shows hydrophilic affinity to the polar small molecules by H-bond interactions. 1-based QCM sensor studies reveal high sensitivity 245 and good selectivity toward methanol, ethanol, acetone and acetonitrile vapours in atmospheric condition, which indicates 1 could be the potential sensor for detection of polar solvent vapours in air.

The complete electrode structure of QCM, the electrode in the figure is made of gold, ours is silver electrode. The up picture is coming from the internet and the below picture is is our actual device. Preparation of the QCM sensor: 1g compound 1 was placed in an acetone solution of 5ml, ultrasonic for 30min and the suspension was obtained. The suspension was dropped onto a silver electrode, dried in air, and then placed in a vacuum drying oven for 2 h at 60 °C, the as-made QCM sensor was yielded. It should be noted that the sensing experiment was performed in air (298 K, 65 % RH), no deducting the effects of air humidity and environment. According to the response frequency values of QCM sensor to different solvent gases, the relative quantity of adsorbed molecules was got if the quantity of adsorbed water molecule was assumed to be 1, the calculation process and results were as follows: ∆𝑓𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∆𝑓𝑥 = ∆𝑚𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∆𝑚𝑥 = 𝑛𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑀𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑛𝑥𝑀𝑥 ; ; 𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙 𝑛𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = ∆𝑓𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙𝑀𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∆𝑓𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑀𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙 = 1.71 𝑛𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑙 𝑛𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = ∆𝑓𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑙𝑀𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∆𝑓𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑀𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑙 = 1.36 ; 𝑛𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑙𝑒 𝑛𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = ∆𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑀𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∆𝑓𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑀𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑙𝑒 = 0.98 𝑛𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑛𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = ∆𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑀𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∆𝑓𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑀𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒 = 0.79; 𝑛𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒 𝑛𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = ∆𝑓𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑀𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∆𝑓𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑀𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒 = 0.23; 𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑦𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒 𝑛𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = ∆𝑓𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑦𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑀𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∆𝑓𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑀𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑦𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒 = 0.09; . 𝑛𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒 𝑛𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = ∆𝑓𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑀𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∆𝑓𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑀𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒 = 0.08; 𝑛𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑦𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑙 𝑛𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = ∆𝑓𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑦𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑀𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∆𝑓𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑀𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑦𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑙 = 0.07 0 -1000 -2000 -3000 -4000 -5000 -6000 Chlorlbenzene Methylbenzene Acetonitrile Acetone Response RMQ Response/Hz Methanol Ethanol Benzene Ethylbenzene Vapours 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Relative Molecular Quantity(RMQ) Water Figure S6. QCM results showing difference of various vapors. Vapor sorption and QCM results indicate the significantly different sorption capacities between polar small molecules and benzene and its derivatives, which mainly caused by oxygen-rich pore surface characteristics and size effect. The strong H-bond interactions could generate between small polar molecules and pore surface, while benzene could not. In addition, although the compound has large channels, the actual void space is much smaller due to 3D interweaving channels, which resulted in small polar molecules could easily enter into the pores, and benzene and its derivatives with larger size are less accessible. N2 sorption: The pore characteristic of 1 was characterized by N2 adsorption at 77K. The BET surface area of 1 is 87.31 m2/g, which is much lower. However, the porosity of 1 can be still confirmed.
