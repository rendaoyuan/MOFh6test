Manuscript Construction of helical networks by using multiple V-shaped mixed ligand systems† Arijit Goswami, Satirtha Sengupta and Raju Mondal* Received 29th March 2011, Accepted 27th September 2011 DOI: 10.1039/c1ce05380a Helical coordination polymers constructed from multiple ligand systems are not common despite the plethora of recent reports on helical networks. We report here the construction of a series of mixed ligand based helical coordination polymers showing metal dependent architecture. The strategy of using a combination of ligand molecules, each capable of forming helical networks, is novel and should enable us to design helical MOFs of interesting topology. Introduction The design of bio-inspired supramolecular frameworks by exploiting the knowledge of crystal engineering has drawn enormous interest in recent years.1 The archetypal double stranded helical structure of DNA remains a major source of inspiration for such research activities.2 A particularly interesting and challenging area in this ﬁeld is the construction of artiﬁcial helical networks with pre-designed organic ligands and explo- ration of their potential utilities as functional materials.3 Signiﬁcant efforts have been devoted to construct various artiﬁcial helices with tailor made linear molecules using various supramolecular ‘glue’, such as hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, electrostatic interaction as well as metal-coordination.4 The design of helical coordination networks is a subject of current interest not only because of their intriguing structures but also owing to their potential applications in optical devices, asymmetric catalysis, enantiomorph separation, bio- logical pharmacy etc.5 It has been shown that the appropriate combination of metal centres and multidentate ligands can lead to a variety of intriguing helical architectures ranging from discrete helicates to coordination polymers containing inﬁnite helices.6 The conformation of the ligand molecule, especially the angle between coordinating sites linked by a spacer with speciﬁc positional orientation, is considered to be the key factor for helical coordination network formation.7 For example, one of the successful approaches for constructing helical coordination polymers is to employ ﬂexible and V-shaped exoditopic ligands. A number of helical MOFs have been constructed by using V-shaped polycarboxylic acids, such as diphenic acid (H2DPA), 4,40-oxibis(benzoic acid) (H2OBA) as the bridging ligand.8 Our recent work on methylenebis-(3,5-dimethylpyrazole) (H2MDP), a neutral V-shaped ﬂexible ligand, is highly relevant in this regard.9 The H2MDP molecule possesses structural characteristics that are considered to be prerequisite for helical network construction: (i) the H2MDP molecule is also a V-sha- ped exo-bidentate ligand. (ii) the pyrazole moieties of the H2MDP molecule are linked with a methylene group. This invokes more ﬂexibility for H2MDP, which can adopt a favor- able conformation when coordinating to the metal centre. (iii) the angle between the coordinating sites is ca. 110, which enhances the possibility of formation of helical framework. Indeed, our recent result shows that H2MDP is an efﬁcient ligand for the construction of helical coordination polymers as well as metal free supramolecular helices.9 These observations prompt us to explore the possibility of constructing helical networks with H2MDP molecule in a mixed ligand system. It is imperative to note here that helical MOFs constructed from a mixed ligand system are rare because of the difﬁculty in achieving the rational incorporation of different organic ligands.10 It becomes even more challenging when both the ligand molecules are of V-shape and have a tendency to form helical networks. On the contrary, the combination of two V-shaped ligands in designing helical architectures should be considered as an attractive design strategy because of the possi- bility of structural variation and the controllability of the assembly process. Particularly, it will be really interesting to see the mutual interplay of the two V-shaped ligand molecules on the resultant network. In principle, one can have four different situations: (i) a single helical architecture with a composite helical pattern, that is both the ligand molecules playing an equal role. (ii) a helical MOF containing two different helical motifs each comprised of only one type of ligand. (iii) one of the ligands takes part in helical network formation while the other remains inac- tive and (iv) none of the ligand molecule forms any helical network.

X-ray crystallography X-ray diffraction intensities were collected at 120 K on Bruker APEX-2 CCD diffractometer using Mo-Ka radiation and pro- cessed using SAINT. The structures were solved by direct methods in SHELXS and reﬁned by full matrix least-squares on F2 in SHELXL.11 The non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters except for disordered lattice DMF molecules in 3 and 4. The disordered DMF mole- cules were reﬁned by constraints using the PART command, with a total occupancy of 1. The contents of the pore in 3 could not be assigned crystallographically. At the ﬁnal stage of the reﬁnement, the excess electron densities amounting 31.07 e A3 (ranging from 5.14–1.41 e A3) were left. The PLATON/SQUEEZE pro- gramme12 was used on the raw data to generate a new data set that removed the scattering contribution from any residual electron density found in the lattice. The calculations indicate the presence of 271.3 electrons/unit cell, which may be attributed to ﬁve DMF molecules (52 e).

A number of fascinating helical coordination polymers have been reported by taking advantage of V-shaped neutral as well as anionic O-donor ligands, such as poly- carboxylates, in combination with suitable metal ions. However, a majority of these studies show a common trend of using a single ligand molecule while for occasional mixed ligand systems, the ﬂexible ligand, responsible for helix formation, is usually accompanied by a rigid linear ligand molecule.13 On the contrary, designing helical networka with multiple V-shaped mixed ligands has seldom been studied which is surprising considering the plethora of recent literature on helical networks. This prompts us to explore the possibility of generating novel helical network using our ligand molecule (H2MDP) along with common V-shaped polycarboxylic acids, H2OBA and H2DPA. It is noteworthy that individual H2MDP, H2OBA and H2DPA molecules have already been effectively used for construction of helical networks. From work presented herein, we intend to gain a deeper insight into the structural interplay between two V-shaped ligands and the interaction hierarchy between molec- ular functionalities of the two ligands on the metal centre. The crystal structures of 1 and 2 show some interesting and unusual features in that they display crystal packing patterns that are composites of the pattern typically observed in helical structures of H2OBA and H2MDP. Such composite packing highlights the importance of both the ligand molecules in directing helical self-assembly process. Compound 1 and 2 are an interesting isomorphous pair as (a) both have the same space group and unit-cell dimensions and (b) the types and the posi- tions of atoms in both are the same. Therefore, only the structure of 1 will be discussed herein. Single crystal X-ray structural analysis reveals that compound 1 crystallized in the hexagonal chiral space group P6122, with a Flack parameter of 0.09(4) (0.01(2) for 2).13 The asymmetric unit consists of one half of a Zn (II) ion, which lies on a twofold axis, along with one half of a molecule of H2MDP and one half of a molecule of doubly deprotonated H2OBA, both of which lie about other twofold axes, with C7 and O3 on the twofold axes. The Zn(II) ion is coordinated to two oxygen atoms from two OBA2 molecules and two nitrogen atoms from two H2MDP ligand molecules to furnish a tetrahedral coordination. The carboxylate groups of the OBA2 molecule adopt a ‘locked’ monodentate mode with the second uncoordinated oxygen atom forming a characteristic N–H/O bond with the H2MDP molecule.9 Based on this connection mode, the Zn(II) atoms are alternatively bridged by two V-shaped ligands, H2MDP and H2OBA, to form a right handed helical chain running along the crystallographic 61 axis in the c-direction (Fig. 1b). It is imperative to note here that the formation of a single stranded helix with the participation of two V-shaped ligands is not common.

View Article Online and 2 represent one of the rare varieties of 3D chiral MOFs made of single stranded helical chains with active participation from two V-shaped ﬂexible ligand molecules alternatively coordinated to the metal centres.10 The helical pitch, given by the distance between equivalent atoms generated by one full rotation of the 6-fold screw axis is 48.258 A. The adjacent same handed helical chains are further interconnected by H2MDP and OBA2 molecules to construct a 3D honeycomb framework (Fig. 2a). Viewed down the c axis, the resultant framework can also be envisaged as a (6,3) net comprised of star shaped hexagons (Fig. 2b). Another interesting feature of the complex is the formation of homochiral one-dimensional nanosized tubular channels (Fig. 2a) running along the c axis. The shortest non- hydrogen interatomic distance across the channel is ca 13.5 A. On the basis of PLATON calculations,12 the open channels constitute about 11.48% (446.9 A3 of 3891.1 A3) {10.42%, 404.8 A3 of 3884.07 A3 for 2} of the crystal volume of 1. A better insight into the nature of this intriguing framework can be achieved by the application of a topological approach, reducing multidimensional structures to simple nodes and connection nets. The Zn atom can be regarded as a 4-connected node and this leads to an interesting 3D chiral framework for compound 1 (and 2) of the topological type quartz-dual (qzd)14 (Fig. 3). When Ni and Cu, two transition metals with octahedral geometry, were used instead of Zn and Co, structurally different helical frameworks are formed in 3 and 4 under almost similar reaction conditions. X-ray single crystal structure analysis shows that the structure of compound 3 is a unique 2D helical layer coordination polymer. Compound 3 crystallizes in monoclinic C2/c space group and the asymmetric unit contains one Ni(II) atom, one H2MDP molecule, one OBA moiety and one coordi- nated water molecule along with one disordered lattice DMF molecule. The octahedral Ni(II) atom is coordinated to two nitrogen atoms from two H2MDP molecules, three oxygen atoms from a bidentate chelating and a monodentate carboxylate group of two OBA2 molecules and a water molecule. Similar to 1 and 2 the helical packing pattern of 3 is a composite pattern of H2MDP and OBA2 molecules. However, the H2MDP molecule plays a completely different role in the helical network formation in 3. The crystal structure of 3 can be better described by using the secondary building unit (SBU) approach.15 The strategy of this approach is to identify a building block (SBU) as a vertex and subsequently to design a network by linking them with an organic ligand of a well-deﬁned geometry. Our previous results showed that the H2MDP molecule, in the presence of a ﬂexible auxiliary linker molecule, has a tendency to form a M2L2 (L ¼ H2MDP) type metallocyclic motif which can be used as a vertex (SBU) for generating MOFs.9c In the present context, the H2MDP molecules form the characteristic M2L2 type metallocyclic motif, which serves as a SBU. The OBA2 molecules, on the other hand, play the role of an auxiliary exo- bidentate bridging ligand and connects these SBUs along the Fig. 1 (a) The coordination environment around the Zn(II) ion of compound 1.

View Article Online b axis to form an inﬁnite spring like helical chain. The SBUs of the two juxtaposed same-handed helical chains are further interconnected by OBA2 molecules to generate a 2D helical layer network. The adjacent layers then adopt a parallel stacking (Fig. 4b) and lead to the formation of large one-dimensional channels, which are occupied by solvent molecules. The inter- layer connectivity is further assisted by O–H/N and N–H/O bonds between coordinated water molecules and pyrazole molecules. The most fascinating structural feature of compound 3 would be the nature of the helical layers. The crystal structures can be envisaged as an alternative stacking of two types of 2D helical layers. Topologically, the 2D layers look almost identical to each other; however, a careful investigation reveals an interesting aspect of the handedness of helical components. The alternate layer is comprised of one particular type of helical chain, either left-handed (Fig. 4c) or right-handed (Fig. 4d). In the overall packing mode, the two types of chiral layers, one left-handed and the other right-handed, crystallize in pairs in a space group C2/c with an inversion centre, leading to a racemic solid state compound. Introduction of Cu(II) atom as the metal centre leads to the formation of a completely different type of helical architecture in 4. The 3D framework (Fig. 5b) is a unique product of a double stranded helix and single stranded helical chains. The asymmetric unit of 4 contains two Cu(II) atoms, two symmetry independent OBA2 molecules, one H2MDP molecule and ﬁve DMF mole- cules. The carboxylate groups of the OBA2 molecules adopt di- monodentate coordination modes and bridge two Cu(II) atoms to form a Cu2(CO2)4 paddle-wheel subunit with a Cu/Cu distance of 2.6 A. The adjacent paddle-wheel subunits are further interconnected by the H2MDP molecule. The resultant 3D framework can be simpliﬁed by sub-dividing it into two helical parts comprised of either OBA2 molecules or H2MDP mole- cules. The OBA2 molecules adopt an interesting spatial orien- tation and form a double stranded helix (Fig. 5c) with an alternate paddle-wheel mode at the crossover point. The use of coordination bonds to crosslink two helical strands has been exploited by many scientists to recreate the H-bonded cross-linked topology of DNA.16 In the present context, the double stranded helix can be envisaged as cross-linking of the two helical strands of OBA2 molecule at the alternate paddle- wheel node. On the other hand, H2MDP molecules form a single stranded helix (Fig. 5d) by bridging the adjacent paddle-wheel nodes. There is a distinct difference between the helical patterns of 1– 3 and 4. In sharp contrast to the composite helical pattern, i.e., helical chain comprises of both the linker molecules for 1–3, the Fig. 2 (a) Crystal structure of 1 showing a honeycomb type network formation with the formation of one dimensional nanosized tubular channels.

Similar to compounds 1 and 2, compounds 5 and 6 are beautifully isomorphous, so only the structure of 5 will be dis- cussed herein. The crystal structure of 5 represents a nice example of the use of coordination bonds to generate inorganic double helical framework. The concept of inorganic double helix was introduced by Lehn in order to describe a special type of double helical structure in which two molecular strands are wrapped around metal centres, which were holding them together.17 The crystal structure of 5 exhibits a similar kind of structural features wherein two molecular strands, consisting of both DPA2 and H2MDP molecules, are wrapped around two Zn(II) metal centres. The asymmetric unit of 5 contains half an atom of Zn(II), one half a molecule of DPA molecule, of which both lie about a twofold axes, along with one half a molecule of H2MDP which lies about another twofold axis with C7 on the twofold axis, and two water molecules. Two DPA2 molecules with a V-shaped arrangement of the carboxylate groups coordinate to metal centres in a monodentate fashion and lead to the formation of a centrosymmetric dinuclear Zn(II) metallocyclic unit with a Zn/Zn distance of 5.16 A. The H2MDP molecules, on the other hand, bridge these dinuclear units to generate a helical strand. As illustrated in Fig. 6, two such strands are wrapped around the centrosymmetric metallocyclic units to generate a double helical framework. Interestingly, the coordination geometries of the two linker molecules are sustained by complementary face-to-face p–p stacking between pyrazole rings of H2MDP and phenyl rings of DPA molecule (Cg–Cg distance is 3.9 A while the shortest C/N distance is 3.5 A). Further stabilization comes from a H-bonded water tetramer, while each water molecule is hydrogen bonded with the carboxylate group of the DPA molecule. Compound 7 and 8, however, show a slight deviation from the theme of the present work and exhibit novel pillared–layer structures.18 Notwithstanding, the crystal structure of 7 can be better envisaged as a bridge between helical and pillared–layer Fig. 4 (a) Coordination environment around the Ni(II) atom of compound 3 (b) Packing diagram of compound 3 showing parallel stacking of two opposite handed 2D helical layers.

The larger size of the Cd2+ ion and subsequently higher coordination (seven) as well as a different type of coordination mode of OBA2 molecule can be attributed as the major driving force for the pillared layer network formation. Unlike in compounds 1–4, the OBA2 molecule acts as a pen- tadentate ligand with one of the carboxylate group adopting a bidentate chelating mode, while the other one exhibits a tri- dentate chelating/bridging mode. The Cd atom is coordinated to two H2MDP molecules, one bidentate chelating carboxylate Fig. 5 (a) The coordination environment around the Cu(II) atom of compound 4.

View Article Online group, while two tridentate carboxylate groups bridge two metal centres and result in a dinuclear unit with a Cd/Cd distance of 4.39 A. The H2MDP molecules lead to the formation of layers by horizontally bridging these dinuclear units from both ends while OBA2 molecules act as pillars. Interestingly, the resultant pil- lared–layer structure can also be envisaged as resulted from fusion of two juxtaposed left handed and right handed helices comprised of both H2MDP and OBA2 molecules. The complex 7, therefore, represents a unique non-helical architecture whose components are of helical nature. Topological analysis of the network has been performed using the TOPOS software by considering metal centres as nodes. As illustrated in Fig. 7(d) the resultant pillared-layer framework can be represented as a {42;67;8}{42;6} net. Similar to 7, compound 8 exhibits another interesting non- helical architecture whose components are of helical nature. Fig. 7 (a) The coordination environment around the Cd(II) ion in compound 7.

Compound 8 can be envisaged as a hydrogen bonded pillared–layer network, wherein only one ligand molecule (H2MDP) takes part in helical network formation while the other remains inactive. The asymmetric unit of 8 contains one H2MDP molecule, one HDPA molecule and one half an atom of Ni(II). The nickel atom adopts an octahedral geometry with four nitrogen atoms of four different H2MDP molecules taking the basal positions while the carboxylate oxygen atoms of two mono-coordinated HDPA molecules take apical positions (Fig. 8). From a topological point of view, the H2MDP molecules, situated at the basal plane, form an interesting 2D non-interpenetrating (4,4) grid network, considering the metal centre as node. However, unlike most of the 2D (4,4) grid networks, it is not planar but undulated, resulting from the inherent bent conformations of the H2MDP molecules. The dimension of the grid can be assigned as 15.86 A  15.35 A (based on Ni/Ni distance) (Fig. 8c). However, the effective pores in the actual structure are further reduced due to the signiﬁcant offset stacking of adjacent 2D Fig. 8 (a) The coordination environment around the Ni(II) ion in compound 8.

View Article Online layers, while the non-interpenetration of the network can be attributed to the severe steric hindrance caused by the methyl groups. One of the most novel aspects of the structure is the undulated nature of the grid network. A closer inspection of the structure reveals that the undulation of the network is a mani- festation of the parallel arrangement of left-handed helical strands of H2MDP molecules, joined together at alternative metal centre. From a topological point of view, the crystal structure forms a pillared–layer structure, where the mono-coordinated HDPA molecules join the adjacent 2D layers with N–H/O bond formation between carboxylic group and pyrazole moity. Compound 9, on the other hand, exhibits a 1D non-helical coordination polymer. The asymmetric unit of 9 consists of a Cu (II) atom, one DPA molecule and one H2MDP molecule (Fig. 9). One of the carboxylate groups of the DPA molecule coordinates to the metal centre in a bidentate chelating mode while the remaining one adopts a monodentate mode. From a topological point of view, the 1D network can be simpliﬁed as an alternative arrangement of two different M2L2 (L ¼ H2MDP and DPA) type metallocyclic motifs (Fig. 9b). Conclusion The impetus for the work presented herein was to synthesize helical coordination polymers using ﬂexible V-shaped mixed ligand systems, which by and large remain elusive despite the plethora of reports on helical networks. Accordingly, we have successfully constructed and characterized a series of mixed ligand based helical coordination polymers showing metal dependent architectures. The strategy of using ﬂexible mixed ligand system depicted in this communication may be a prom- ising technique for the generation of helical structures and thus opening a new avenue in the exploration of helical coordination polymers.

No further weight loss is observed upto 350o C and thereafter rapid degradation takes place. Compound 4 also shows an approximate 20% weight loss between room temperature and 275o C corresponding to the removal of the trapped solvent molecules and after that it starts degrading quickly.
