Single-crystal X-ray analysis indicates that with the different coordination habits of Zn2+, Cu2+, and Co2+ ions, the resulting compounds feature coordination structures with different dimensionalities, namely, a 1D zigzag chain based on single-ion nodes in 1, a 2D sql layer based on dinuclear 4-connected nodes in 2, and a 3D sxb framework based on trinuclear 6-connected nodes in 3. In addition, after the removal of guest molecules, the 2D framework of 2 and the 3D framework of 3 are stable enough for CO2 sorption with Langmuir surface areas of 440 cm2 g−1 and 542 cm3 g−1, respectively. The present study serves as an example, in which the metal ion acts as the sole reaction variable, demonstrating the significance of the metal ion in the structural diversity of coordination polymers. Introduction Coordination polymers (CPs) have received considerable attention stemming from not only their diverse interesting molecular topologies but also their potential applications such as gas storage,1 sensing,2 separation,3 catalysis,4 and magnetic materials.5 The diverse properties of CPs are closely related to their structures, and could be modulated by tailor- ing their structures via crystal engineering.6 It is still a chal- lenge to precisely predict the crystal structures of CPs. Never- theless, understanding the pivotal factors of individual variables that are involved in the molecular assembly and crystallization processes can be very helpful for the molecular design and tailoring of the structures.7 Among a number of factors contributing to the formation of products, templates,8 anions,9 temperature,10 reaction time,11 solvents,12 pH,13 and ligand design14 have been extensively investigated to deter- mine their role in the modulation of the structures. However, despite the fact that the metal ion is indeed a crucial factor in controlling the diversity of structures, only a few examples emphasizing its role in the formation of diverse products were documented,15 among them the examples in which the metal ion acts as the sole reaction variable are even rarer. For instance, three CPs with 1D, 2D, and 3D coordination struc- tures were obtained by reacting 5-aminodiacetic isophthalic acid with Cu2+, Co2+, and Zn2+, respectively, under similar reaction conditions.16 A series of CPs were constructed based on 3-pyridin-3-yl-benzoate and different metal ions under the same hydrothermal conditions, demonstrating that different metal ions lead to delicate geometric and topological diversi- ties of the resulting CPs.17 To further understand the role of the metal ion in the for- mation of CPs, we chose a chelating ligand Ĳ2,2′-bipyridine, abbreviated as bpy) and a linear dicarboxylic acid Ĳ4,4′-Ĳethyne-1,2-diyl)dibenzoic acid, abbreviated as H2edba) to react with different 3d metal ions under solvothermal con- ditions.18 As bpy could occupy two coordination sites of 3d metal ions to reduce the coordination flexibility, the other sites of metal ions could be predictably coordinated to the linear ditopic edba2−ligands to form polymeric coordination structures.

By using bpy and H2edba to react with Zn2+, Cu2+, and Co2+, respectively, we obtained three new CPs, namely, ĳZnĲedba)Ĳbpy)]·xGuest (1), ĳCuĲedba)Ĳbpy)]·xGuest (2), and ĳCo3Ĳedba)3Ĳbpy)2]·3DMF·H2O (3), which feature coordination structures such as 1D zigzag chains, 2D square layers, and 3D porous frameworks, respectively. In addition, their ther- mal stabilities were investigated, and the porosity properties of 2 and 3 were studied by CO2 sorption experiments. Experimental section Materials and instrumentation All reagents and solvents were commercially purchased and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. The ligand H2edba was synthesized through the Sonogashira coupling reaction.19 Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240 elemental analyser, and all the samples were heated to remove the guest molecules before measurement. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a TA-Q50 system under N2 flow. Power X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray powder diffractometer (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å). The gas sorption isotherm was measured with a Micro- meritics ASAP 2020M instrument. Before the sorption experi- ment, the as-synthesized sample of 3 was exchanged with methanol and activated under high vacuum at 180 °C for 4 h. Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained from KBr pellets using a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer in the 400–4000 cm−1 region.

CCDC reference numbers 1049565–1049567 for 1, 2 and 3, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). Results and discussion Single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed that 1 crystallizes in the space group C2/c, and is isomorphic with ĳZnĲbpy)Ĳtp)]Ĳbpy) which was constructed by bpy and a shorter carboxylic acid, H2tp (terephthalic acid).25 Its asymmetric unit includes one half of Zn2+, one half of edba2−and one half of bpy. The Zn2+ ion adopts a highly distorted octahedral geometry with four oxygen atoms from two edba2−ligands and two nitrogen atoms from a chelating bpy ligand (Fig. S1a†). Each edba2− ligand bridges two zinc atoms (mode 1 in Scheme 1), resulting in 1D infinite zigzag chains with additional bpy ligands found on both sides (Fig. 1a). These 1D chains arrange along the c axis, and there are persistent C–H⋯O hydrogen bond interactions [dC⋯O = 3.30(1) Å] between adja- cent chains. These C–H⋯O hydrogen bond interactions fur- ther extend the 1D chains to undulating 2D layers, as depicted in Fig. 1b. The π–π stacking interactions of bpy exist between adjacent layers [the centroid–centroid and plane-to- plane distances are 3.79(2) Å and 3.509(7) Å, respectively], and thus extend the 2D layers to a 3D supramolecular net- work featuring 1D nano-sized saddle-like channels (23.5 × 14.8 Å) along the c axis (Fig. 1b). The whole supramolecular network of 1 occupies 53.4% of the total crystal volume as calculated by PLATON,23 which is less than that (59.3%) observed in its analogue with a shorter carboxylate ligand.24 The remaining space is occupied by guest molecules.

View Article Online CrystEngComm This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015 To examine the thermal stability of 1, TGA was carried out on the powder sample with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. As shown in Fig. 2, a gradual weight loss of about 39.2 wt% was observed from the beginning to 140 °C, which could be attributed to the loss of the guest molecules. However, after removal of guest molecules, the 3D supramolecular network constructed by the 1D coordination chains becomes unstable, as confirmed by PXRD (Fig. S2a†). The two abrupt weight loss steps after 250 °C can be ascribed to the decomposition of 1D coordination chains. These facts prevent further investiga- tion about the porosity of 1. Compound 2 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1¯; its asymmetric unit contains one Cu2+ ion, two halves of independent edba2−, and one bpy. The edba2−ligands reveal two coordination modes, with two μ2-η1,η1-bridging carboxyl- ate groups (mode 2 in Scheme 1) and two μ1-η0,η1-mono- dentate carboxylate groups (mode 3 in Scheme 1), respec- tively. Each Cu2+ ion is pentacoordinated in a distorted rectangular pyramidal geometry (τ = 0.37),26 involving three oxygen atoms from one monodentate and two bridging edba2−ligands as well as two nitrogen atoms from a chelating bpy ligand. Two Cu2+ ions are linked by two independent car- boxylate bridges of the edba2−ligand, resulting in a dinuclear unit with a Cu⋯Cu distance of 4.492(8) Å. Each dinuclear unit links to four neighbouring dinuclear units by edba2− ligands to form a square grid layer with a common sql topol- ogy (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b, the layers are stacked in ABAB mode through π–π interactions with a centroid–cen- troid distance of 3.75(1) Å and a plane-to-plane distance of 3.379(6) Å. The supramolecular network occupies 79.3% of the total crystal volume,22 while the remaining space is occu- pied by guest molecules. The TGA curve (Fig. 2) of the as-synthesized sample of 2 exhibits a weight loss of 10.1% before 230 °C, corresponding to the loss of the guest molecules. However, as confirmed by PXRD (Fig. S2b†), after removing the guest molecules by heating the as-synthesized sample, 2 cannot maintain its crystallinity very well. Therefore, a methanol-exchanged sam- ple was prepared by immersing the as-synthesized sample in methanol for three days. This methanol-exchanged sample shows a standard TGA platform before collapsing (Fig. 2), and its framework could be well maintained after the removal of the guest methanol molecules to perform a fur- ther study on the porosity of 2 (Fig. S2b†). The CO2 sorption isotherm measured at 195 K for 2 (Fig. 4) revealed that its BET surface area and Langmuir surface area are 220 cm2 g−1 and 440 cm2 g−1, respectively. The total uptake of 95 cm3 g−1 is close to the calculated saturated uptake (91 cm3 g−1). For 3, it crystallizes in the polar monoclinic space group Cc. Its asymmetric unit consists of three Co2+ ions, two bpy, three edba2−ligands, three DMF molecules, and one water molecule. As shown in Fig. 5a, there is a linear trinuclear unit consisting of three crystallographically-independent Co2+ ions. Each of the two terminal Co2+ ions (Co1 and Co3) is in a slightly distorted octahedral geometry, in which the metal centre is chelated by a bpy and a carboxylate group, and is coordinated to two oxygen atoms from two carboxylate groups. The central Co2+ ion (Co2) is also located in a distorted octahedral geometry that is composed of six oxygen Fig. 2 TGA curves of 1–3.

In such a way, the central ion is bridged to each terminal ion by two μ2-η1,η1-bridging carboxylate groups and one μ2-η1,η2-bridging carboxylate group. Each trinuclear unit is further connected to six neighbouring trinuclear units via linear edba2−ligands to form a 3D framework. Considering the trinuclear unit as a 6-connected node and edba2−as linkers, the framework can be regarded as an uncommon 6-connected sxb net (Fig. 5b).27 The entire 3D framework occupies 73.5% of the total crystal volume.23 As shown in Fig. 5c, the remaining space that is occupied by guest molecules consists of 1D channels along the c axis, and 0D pores in a 1D array along the c axis, which are connected to the 1D channels through narrow necks with a diameter of 1.8 Å, taking into account the van der Waals radii.28 The TGA curve (Fig. 2) of the as-synthesized sample of 3 exhibits a weight loss of 15.64% before 250 °C, corresponding to the loss of the guest DMF and water molecules (calcd: 15.61%). Then there was a platform, and the framework collapsed above 350 °C. However, similar to 2, after removing the guest molecules by heating the as-synthesized sample, 3 cannot maintain its crystallinity very well. Therefore, a methanol-exchanged sample was prepared and activated for gas adsorption (Fig. 2 and S2c†).29 In addition, the guest- exchange experiment indicated that the host framework pos- sesses exceptional flexibility, which is mainly caused by the deformation of the framework and the rotation of the phenyl ring, allowing the guest molecules to pass through the nar- row necks. Considering the narrow necks of compound 3, the poros- ity of the activated sample was probed by sorption of the CO2 molecule, which has a smaller kinetic diameter and is easier to pass through the narrow necks than the N2 molecule. As shown in Fig. 6, the CO2 sorption isotherm measured at 195 K for 3 revealed a type I character. The Langmuir surface area is 542 cm2 g−1 and the pore volume is 0.22 cm3 g−1 (0.22 cm3 g−1 calculated from the crystal structure). The pore vol- ume estimated from the first-step uptake of 72 cm3 g−1 is 0.13 cm3 g−1, corresponding to the calculated pore volume of the 1D channels (0.14 cm3 g−1), indicating that the CO2 mole- cules entered the 1D channels firstly. With the further increase of pressure to P/P0 = 1, the uptake reached 129 cm3 g−1, which is close to the calculated saturated uptake (123 cm3 g−1), indicating that the CO2 molecules could full fill the voids of the framework. Conclusion As 1–3 were synthesized under the same reaction conditions except for the use of different 3d divalent metal ions, their coordination structures with different dimensionalities are mainly ascribed to the different coordination habits of the metal ions. Indeed, Zn2+ ions tend to be chelated by two car- boxylate groups, and hence are interlinked by edba2−ligands to form a 1D zigzag coordination chain in 1. Cu2+ ions tend to form dinuclear units by two μ2-η1,η1-bridging carboxylate groups, and these dinuclear units are further interlinked by edba2−ligands to form a 2D layer with a sql topology in 2. For Co2+ ions, a linear trinuclear cluster constructed by six Fig. 5 (a) The linear trinuclear Co2+ unit in 3 (symmetry codes: A = −0.5 + x, −0.5 + y, z; B = x, 1 + y, z; C = −0.5 + x, 1.5 −y, 0.5 + z.); (b) the underlying 6-connected sxb topology of the 3D framework; (c) views of the 3D framework and channel structure of 3 along the c (top) and b (bottom) axes.

In addition, the coordination structures of 2 and 3 with the higher dimensionalities are more stable than that of 1; thus, they can exhibit porosity for CO2 sorption. The present study serves as an example, in which the metal ion acts as the sole reaction variable, dem- onstrating the significance of metal ions in the diversity of the coordination structures of CPs.
