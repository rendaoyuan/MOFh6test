Compound 1 possesses a 1-D ladderlike structural feature, compounds 2 and 3 show two different 2-D wavelike networks with the same (44) network topology, and compound 4 exhibits a 3-D open framework with (42464) framework topology (similar to the CsCl-type body-centered cubic lattice). The structural features and the dimension evolution of the four compounds, along with the inﬂuence of nodes and mixed linear ligands are presented and discussed. The ﬂuorescent properties of the four compounds are also investigated. Introduction Current interest in the crystal engineering of coordination polymers is rapidly expanding due not only to their potential applications in catalysis, adsorption, magnetism, molecular recognition, nonlinear optics and sensors, but also their intriguing structural architectures and topologies.1 Crystal engineers have always attempted their best to realize the true prediction of the precise solid-state structures based on a set of metal centers and ligands, however, it remains a long-term challenge considering that the self-assembly process is often affected by many factors, such as the nature of the ligands used, the versatility of the metal coordination geometry, the stoichio- metric ratio of the reactive materials and various experimental conditions. Nevertheless, many new reaction systems can still be elaborately designed so as to explore the important relationships between various synthetic factors and the structural topologies of the coordination polymers.2–10 In this research ﬁeld, coordination polymers based on d10 transition metal ions and linear bicarboxylate ligands institute an interesting subfamily.11 It is worth mentioning that many of these coordination polymers usually contain solvent molecules (such as water (H2O), aceto- nitrile (MeCN) and N,N0-dimethylformamide (DMF)) as terminal ligands in the coordination sphere of the metal, it is therefore possible to employ other neutral bridging ligands, for example organodiimines, into the above system to substitute the solvent terminal ligands and obtain new extended coordination architectures with diverse sizes and shapes.12–15 Thus, an effective strategy is to use one linear dicarboxylate ligand with d10 metal ions to construct basic units and another bridging N-donor ligand to extend the framework.16 Obviously, the intelligent design and choice of ligands and full consideration of the synergistic effects of the ligands and the match of d10 metal centers with suitable ligands will create a fruitful reaction system for new coordination polymers. Based on the aforementioned consideration, we have embarked on a reaction system, utilizing Zn(II) and Cd(II) ions as nodes and the mixed bicarboxylate- and bipyridine-containing linear ligands as spacers (Scheme 1), to prepare new coordina- tion-polymeric solids by the adjustment of nodes with different connection modes and ﬂexible/robust properties of linear ligands. Herein, we report four new extended coordination polymers with progressive dimensions: [Zn(cis- chdc)(bpp)]$6H2O (1), [Zn(cis-chdc)(bpmp)] (2), [Cd2(cis- chdc)2(bpmp)(H2O)2] (3), and [Cd3(tp)3(bpp)2]$2DMF$6H2O (4) (H2chdc ¼ 1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid; bpp ¼ 1,3- bis(4-pyridyl)propane; bpmp ¼ N,N0-bis(4-pyridylmethyl) aKey Laboratory of Polyoxometalate Science of Ministry of Education, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, P.

X-ray crystallography Single crystals of compounds 1–4 were glued on a glass ﬁber. Data collection were performed on a Rigaku RAXIS RAPID IP diffractometer with Mo-Ka (l ¼ 0.71073 A) at 150 K. Empirical absorption correction was applied. The structure was solved by the direct method and reﬁned by full-matrix least squares on F2 using the SHELXL 97 program.18 All of the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. The organic hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically; the aqua hydrogen atoms were located from difference maps. Restraint command ‘‘ISOR’’ was applied to the solvent water molecule O6W in 1, and the same restraint command was also applied to the disordered C9 and C9A in 2 as well as the disordered solvent DMF molecules in 4. Furthermore, compound 4 exhibits an extra solvent accessible void in the ﬁnal reﬁnement but the residual peaks are too weak to be conﬁrmed as solvent molecules. Thus, the SQUEEZE program19 was used to Scheme 1 Schematic view of the bicarboxylate- and bipyridine-con- taining linear ligands: (a) H2chdc, (b) H2tp, (c) bpp and (d) bpmp.

The crystal data and structure reﬁnement of compounds 1–4 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for 1 and 2 are listed in the Table S1, ESI.† Results and discussion Crystal structure of 1–4 Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in P1 space group. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Zn center, one cis-chdc ligand, one bpp ligand and six lattice water molecules. In 1, the Zn center adopts a tetra-coordinated environment with two oxygen atoms derived from different deprotonated H2chdc ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two bpp ligands (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, ESI†). The Zn–O(N) bond lengths are in the range of 1.950(2)–2.053(2) A, and the O(N)– Zn–O(N) bond angles vary from 102.84(8) to 121.17(9). In 1, the chdc ligands adopt the cis-conformation and both carbox- ylate groups of the chdc ligands exhibit a monodentate bridging mode with Zn centers.20 The bpp ligands possess the TG conformation (T ¼ trans, G ¼ gauche) with the N/N distance of ca. 9.00 A (Fig. S2, ESI†).21 Based on above coordination modes, two Zn centers are linked by two chdc ligands to form an ellip- tical circle with the size of 5.82  8.29 A. Such elliptical segments can be viewed as the ‘‘crosspiece’’ units of the ladder, which are further connected by the bpp ligands to form the 1D inﬁnite ladder (Fig. 1). When the Zn centers and organic ligands are considered as three-connected nodes and linear linkers, respec- tively, the ladder-like chain can be simpliﬁed as a 1D chain with (42$6) topology (Fig. 1a). In the packing arrangement, all the 1D chains are parallel with each other along b and c axis, but are just overlapped along the a axis (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3, ESI†). Furthermore, all the 1D ladder- like chains are well separated in three dimensions without obvious intermolecular interactions. However, each 1-D chain possesses a relatively large square mesh with the size of 12.07  17.40 A and is fully occupied by lattice water molecules (Fig. 3). These water molecules form an interesting {H2O}12 cluster based on extensive hydrogen bonding interaction between them (Fig. S4a and Table S2, ESI†). These {H2O}12 clusters are further hydrogen-bonded with the carboxylate groups of the 1-D chains and the adjacent {H2O}12 clusters (Fig. S4b, ESI†), stabilizing the whole supramolecular framework.

Published on 07 February 2011 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C0CE00878H View Article Online Compound 2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnma. In the asymmetric unit of 2, there is one Zn ion, one cis- chdc ligand and one bpmp ligand (Fig. 4 and Fig. S5, ESI†). The Zn center coordinates with two oxygen atoms derived from two chdc ligands and two nitrogen atoms derived from two different bpmp ligands, exhibiting a tetrahedral coordination geometry. The Zn–O(N) bond lengths are in the range of 1.920(6)– 2.070(3) A, and the O(N)-Zn–O(N) angles range from 106.3(2)– 118.7(2). In 2, the chdc ligands adopt the same cis-conformation and coordination mode with Zn ions as those in compound 1. The bpmp ligands possess the trans-conformation with the Npy/ Npy (py ¼ pyridine group) distance of ca. 12.44 A (Fig. S6, ESI†).21 Based on the above connection mode, the Zn centers are connected by deprotonated chdc ligands to form 1-D chains along the a axis, which are further linked by neutral bpmp ligands to form a 2-D wavelike layer with the square mesh of 9.71  16.33 A (Fig. 4). In the topological view of point, each Zn ion can be considered as four-connected node, and the bpmp and chdc ligands as linkages. As a result, the wavelike layer shows a 2-D (4$4) topological net. In the packing arrangement, all these 2-D wavelike sheets are parallel with each other as shown in Fig. 5a and 5b. However, it is noteworthy that there are two types of 2-D networks in 2 considering the two different orientations of the bpmp ligands in the adjacent layers (see Fig. 5c). The two types of wavelike layers are closely stacked in ABAB/mode, leading to a solvent-free supramolecular framework (see Fig. S7, ESI†). The adjacent layers are connected together by weak intermolecular forces (or Fig. 2 (a) Packing arrangement of compound 1 viewed along the a axis. The solvent water molecules are omitted for clarity; (b) Schematic view of the arrangement of 1-D chains in 1.

The typical short distance of O(1)/C(12) is ca. 3.26 A, indicating the weak intermolecular interactions between two adjacent layers (see Fig. S8, ESI†). Compound 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2/c. The basic unit of 3 contains two Cd centers, two cis-chdc ligands, one bpmp ligand and two coordination water molecules (Fig. 6a and Fig. S9, ESI†). In 3, the Cd(1) ion adopts a distorted octa- hedral coordination environment, coordinating to four oxygen atoms derived from deprotonated chdc ligands and two terminal aqua ligands. The Cd(2) ion exhibits a similar octahedral coor- dination geometry with four oxygen atoms originated from two different chdc ligands and two N atoms from the bpmp ligands. The Cd–O(N) bond lengths vary from 2.246(2)–2.420(2) A, and the O(N)–Cd–O(N) bond angles are in the range of 56.28(7)– 165.30(11). Moreover, the deprotonated chdc ligands in 3 exhibit the cis-conformation and the coordination modes of both carboxylate groups display a cis-bidentate chelating mode with two Cd centers.20 The bpmp ligands possess the trans-confor- mation with the Npy/Npy (py ¼ pyridine group) distance of ca. 12.83 A (Fig. S10, ESI†). Based on the above coordination mode, all the Cd centers are connected by chdc ligands to form 1-D zigzag chains, which are further linked by bpmp ligands to form a 2-D wavelike network. Such a network possesses an approxi- mately rhombic mesh with the size of 16.91  17.24 A (Fig. 6a and Fig. S11, ESI†). Furthermore, each Cd(2) centers can be viewed as four-connected nodes, while the bpmp and [Cd(1)(chdc)2] units can be regarded as linkers. As a result, the 2- D network in 3 exhibits a (4$4) topology. In the packing arrangement of 3, all the 2-D layers possess the same structural feature and extending orientations, which are closely stacked together along the b axis. Moreover, the adjacent wavelike layers are H-bonded to each other via the close O(aqua)–H/O(carboxylate) interactions. The typical O(1W)-H/O(5) bond length is ca. 2.81 A. It is also worth mentioning that compound 3 does not show any solvent accessible 1-D channels along the b axis. Since both chdc and bpmp ligands are ﬂexible, the actual space of the rhombic mesh is partially occupied by the fragments of chdc and bpmp ligands. Compound 4 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. The basic unit of 4 (as shown in Fig. 7a) contains three Cd centers aggregated together by six deprotonated tp ligands and four neutral bpp ligands. In such a unit, there are two crystallo- graphically unique Cd centers (Cd(1) and Cd(2) as shown in Fig. S13.† Cd(1) displays a distorted pentagonal bipyramid coordination geometry with ﬁve O atoms derived from three tp ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two bpp ligands. The Cd(1)–O(N) bond distances are in the range of 2.258(4)– 2.483(4) A, and the O(N)–Cd–O(N) bond angles range from 54.02(13) to 178.34(16). Cd(2) is ligated with six O atoms from six tp ligands, exhibiting a distorted octahedral coordination geometry. The Cd(2)–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.211(4)–2.376(4) A, and the O–Cd–O bond angles vary from 84.3(2) to 177.17(18). Furthermore, there is no metal-metal bonding in the compound, as the shortest distance between Cd atoms is 3.59 A, and the angle of Cd(1)–Cd(2)–Cd(1A) is 145.35. In the basic unit of 4, six deprotonated tp ligands can be sepa- rated into two types: that is, four tp ligands that adopt the bridging bi(tridentate) fashion, while the other two tp ligands exhibit bridging bidentate-tridentate coordination mode (Fig. S14a, ESI†).20 It is worth mentioning that the tridentate bridging mode has always been presumed to be an important intermediate in ‘‘carboxylate-shift’’ chemistry22 and is an important factor for the formation of the trinuclear metal cluster. The bpp ligands display the TG conformation (T ¼ trans, G ¼ gauche) with the N/N distance of ca. 8.22 A, and the dihedral angel of the pyridine planes is ca. 113.2 (Fig. S14b, ESI†).

These clusters are further linked by six tp ligands to form 2-D inﬁnite parallelogram grids on the [100] plane. The size of each grid is ca. 9.50  9.50 A (Fig. 7b). Moreover, these 2-D layers are pillared by the bpp ligands, forming a 3-D open framework with 1-D channels viewed along the [1/2 0  1/2] direction. The distance between two adjacent layers is ca. 6.52 A (Fig. 7c–d). Structural analysis with SQUEEZE program19 indicates that the open framework of 4 possesses free void space estimated to be about 525.1 A3, that is, 7.7% of the crystal volume, which are occupied by solvent DMF and water molecules (Fig. S15, ESI†). According to the new approaches to the analysis of highly connected frameworks proposed by Hill et al.,23 each trinuclear cluster in 4 is surrounded by eight other trinuclear units via ten linear ligands (Fig. 8a), which can be deﬁned as an eight-con- nected node to link to eight nearest neighbours at distances of 10.00–17.44 A (Fig. 8b), forming a 3-D uninodal framework of (424$64) topology (or the familiar CsCl-type body-centered cubic lattice (bcc) (see Fig. 8).24 As shown above, the simultaneous use of bicarboxyl- and bipyridine-containing linear ligands, together with Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions, affords various architectures. Although we can not propose deﬁnitive reasons to explain why each compound exhibits a different topology and dimension, some of the general trends observed are discussed below. Effect of coordination mode of metal ions The dimensions of the four polymeric compounds are strongly related to the coordination mode of the metal ions. As shown in Table 2 and Scheme 2, all the Zn atoms in 1 and 2 display the tetra-coordinated mode, which are coordinated by four ﬂexible bridging ligands to serve as three- and four-connected nodes, resulting in a typical 1-D ladder-like chain and 2-D wavelike network, respectively. In contrast to 1 and 2, the Cd atoms in 3 and 4 show hexa- and even hepta-coordination modes, which provide more linking sites for the linear ligands. Although compound 3 still possesses a 2-D wavelike layer with the (4$4) network topology, the grid unit of 3 is larger than the one of 2 due to an extra Cd atom attending the construction of the network. In 4, the single metal atoms are substituted by trinu- clear metal units to form eight-connected nodes, giving an eight- connected 3-D open framework. From the dimension increase observed for 1–4, we can ﬁnd that the increase in metal coordi- nation modes (from tetra to hepta), especially the formation of polynuclear metal units, induces the progressive connectivity of the ultimate net (from 3 to 8). It is easily understood that the metal with higher coordination modes and the polynuclear metal units with larger surface areas can more readily accommodate the steric demands of organic linkers and provide more highly connected polymeric structures. Therefore, the choice of highly coordinative metal and/or the employment of polynuclear metal clusters as nodes will provide efﬁcient ways toward the genera- tion of high-dimensional frameworks, even the 3-D open frameworks. Effect of ﬂexible/robust property of linear ligands It is also found that the dimensions of the four polymeric compounds 1–4 are somewhat related to the ﬂexible/robust property of the linear ligands (see Table 2). In a very loose and general sense, we can conclude that the H2chdc is more ﬂexible than H2tp, and bpp is more ﬂexible than bpmp, based on their methylene group numbers and possible conﬁgurations in the reported coordination polymers.11,16,17,25 As described above, the Fig. 8 Schematic view of the structural topology of 4, in which the tri- nuclear unit is simpliﬁed as eight-connected nodes, the H2tp and bpp ligands are represented by black and blue lines, respectively.

Published on 07 February 2011 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C0CE00878H View Article Online simultaneous use of more ﬂexible H2chdc and bpp liands affords the 1-D polymeric compound 1. In comparison, when the bpp ligand is substituted by the less ﬂexible ligand bpmp, 2-D networks of 2 and 3 are formed. Furthermore, the substitution of the ﬂexible H2chdc ligand by the robust H2tp ligand induces the formation of 3-D open framework of 4. Thus, the ﬂexibility and robustness of the linear ligands in such a reaction system, in some degree, can inﬂuence the dimensions of the ultimate coordination polymers. In other words, the ﬂexibility and robustness of the linear ligands may also play a signiﬁcant role in tuning the dimensions of a speciﬁc network. Such a phenomenon has also been observed in a series of relevant coordination polymers.26 Based on above discussion, we can initially predict that the use of high-connected nodes and relatively robust ligands could be two key factors for the efﬁcient assembly of high dimensional frameworks in such a mixed linear ligands system. Additional factors, such as the stoichiometric ratio of the reactive materials, the reaction pH, temperature, time, and the solvent polarity, play fundamental roles in the synthesis of the coordination polymers. Since these factors work together to affect the ﬁnal structural topologies, it is difﬁcult to separate and rationalize them one by one. TG and PXRD analyses Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses of 1–4 were performed on polycrystalline samples under a nitrogen atmosphere so as to check their thermal stability (Figures S20–S23, ESI†). The TG curve of 1 exhibits three well-separated weight loss stages. The ﬁrst, of 19.88% from 35 to 110 C, is ascribed to the loss of six water molecules (calcd 19.86%). The second, of 35.96% from 220 to 320 C, is consistent with removal of all the bpp ligand (calcd 36.45%). The third, of 28.05% from 345 to 529 C, corresponds to the decomposition and removal of the remaining chdc ligands (calcd 27.58%). The residue weight (16.11%) is close to the expected value (16.08%) of ZnO, indicating that this is the ﬁnal product. In the TG curve of 2, no weight loss was observed up to 320 C. The ﬁrst weight loss step of compound 2 is attributed to the loss of bpmp ligands (obsd 52.86%, calcd 53.04%) from 320 to 355 C. The second weight loss stage is in the temperature range of 470– 560 C, corresponding to the decomposition and removal of all chdc ligands (obsd 32.14%, calcd 32.26%). The remaining weight (15.00%) indicated that the ﬁnal product might be ZnO (calcd 14.70%). In the TG curve of 3, the ﬁrst weight loss stage of 3.89% was observed above 210 C, in agreement with the calculated value (4.12%), indicating the loss of all the coordinated water mole- cules. Above 330 C, signiﬁcant weight losses occurred and ended at 455 C, corresponding to the decomposition of all the organic ligands. The residue weight (25.53%) of 3 suggests a complete decomposition to form CdO, which is close to the expected value of 25.74%. The TGA curve of 4 reveals that the ﬁrst weight loss (obsd 7.28%) from 55 to 150 C is attributed to the loss of all the lattice water molecules (calcd 7.27%). Then the complex lost all the DMF molecules and half of the bpp ligands from 150 to 310 C (obsd 22.73%, calcd 23.17%). Organic components left were decomposed and lost between 440 C and 510 C (obsd 44.99%, calcd 45.00%). The remaining weight (24.71%) indicated that the ﬁnal product was CdO (calcd 24.56%). In order to check the phase purity of compounds 1–4, the PXRD patterns of them were recorded at room temperature. As shown in Fig. S24–S27,† the peak positions of simulated and experimental patterns of compound 1–4 are in agreement with each other, indicating the good phase purity of them. The differences in intensity are due to the preferred orientations of the crystalline powder samples. It is also worth mentioning that the PXRD pattern of desolvated compound 4 (see Fig. S27, ESI†) shows signiﬁcant difference in comparison to the as-synthesized pattern, suggesting the possible structural change or phase transformation after removal of the guest solvent water mole- cules. Luminescent properties The luminescent properties of compounds 1–4 have been studied. Upon excitation of the solid state samples of 1–4 at room temperature, intense bands in the emission spectra are observed at 440 nm (lexmax ¼ 367 nm) for 1, 494 nm (lexmax ¼ 433 nm) for 2, 451 nm (lexmax ¼ 396 nm) for 3, and 420 nm (lexmax ¼ 333 nm) for 4, respectively (Fig. 9). According to the literature,11,16,17,25 solid H2chdc, H2tp, bpp and bpmp ligands are nearly non-ﬂuorescent in the range 400– 800 nm for excitation wavelengths between 360 and 500 nm at room temperature. Our measurement on these four ligands also revealed their non-luminescent properties. Thus, the origin of the emission may be attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT).27 In these compounds, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are presumably associated with the p- bonding orbitals from the pyridine group and/or aromatic rings, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are mainly associated with the Zn/Cd–N(pyridine) and Zn/Cd– O(carboxy) s*-antibonding orbitals, localized more on the metal centers. Theoretically, the impact of the relativistic effect, the coordination structures, and electron correlation effects may induce the (n + 1) s orbitals of the d10 metals contract, and therefore possessing lower energies.28,29 Thus, the LMCT can happen with enough excitation energy and lead to the emission in these compounds. The above observations suggest that these Fig. 9 Emission spectra of 1–4 in the solid state at room temperature. 2548 | CrystEngComm, 2011, 13, 2542–2549 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Downloaded by Cape Breton University on 03/05/2013 15:09:48.

Conclusions The simultaneous use of the bicarboxylate- and bipyridine-con- taining linear ligands to react with d10 metal ions affords four interesting polymeric compounds with ladder, net or open framework architectures, providing new examples to explore various possible relationships between synthetic factors and the structural topologies of the coordination polymers. In such a mixed linear ligand system, the employment of high-connected nodes and robust ligands could be two key factors for the assembly of high dimensional frameworks, especially the 3-D open framework. Although it is still difﬁcult to predict the structures accurately, such general trends may suggest an efﬁ- cient pathway to rational design new 3-D metal–organic frame- works and explore their interesting physical properties.
