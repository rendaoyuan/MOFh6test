X-Ray analysis revealed that the seven complexes present two different types of three-dimensional (3D) structures. Complex 1 crystallized in an orthorhombic manner having a Pna2(1) space group, consisting of a 3D framework with a 1D heterometallic chain. Polymers 2–7 are isostructural and crystallized in an orthorhombic fashion having a Pccn space group existing of a two-fold interpenetrating 3D framework. The luminescence properties and the magnetic properties of all polymers were investigated. Introduction The assembly of d–f heterometallic coordination polymers (HM- CPs) through rational design is of great interest to crystal engi- neering not only because of their fascinating structural topology, but also for their potential applications as functional materials in luminescence, molecular adsorption, bimetallic catalysis and magnetism.1,2 Considerable progress has been made in designing and fabricating d–f HMCPs, from 1D chains, 2D lattices to 3D frameworks.3–5 The synthesis of d–f HMCPs is still a chal- lenging task since lanthanide ions have different coordination characteristics compared to transition metals ions. Lanthanide ions behave as hard acids, having a preference for oxygen to nitrogen donors. In contrast, d-block metal ions are borderline acids, having a strong tendency to coordinate to N-donors, often resulting in homometallic coordination polymers rather than d–f heterometallic coordination polymers.6 Hence, selection or design of a suitable ligand containing an active coordination ability to both lanthanide ions and transition metal ions is crucial for the construction of d–f heterometallic frameworks.7 In addition, other parameters inﬂuencing the synthesis of HCMPs, e.g. temperature, solvent, template and the pH have to be taken into account.6c–8 In literature most of the investigations dealing with 3d–4f HCMPs report on systems such as Ln–Mn, Ln–Fe, Ln–Pt, Ln–Co and Ln– Cu systems bridged by the N-heterocyclic carboxylate ligands.7a,9–12 With respect to 4d–4f HMCPs, it is worth noting that previous studies revealed the following features: (i) the reported 4d–4f aLaboratory of Coordination Chemistry, Shenyang Institute of Chemical Technology, Shenyang 100142, China.

(ii) These studies almost exclusively applied isonicotinic ligands, and almost totally ignore the use of other carboxylate ligands.2a,2b,4a,13 On the other hand, an important property of coordination polymer frameworks is their tendency to form entangled structures in which two or more independent inﬁnite networks interpenetrate each other.14 Interpenetration can be utilized to strengthen the interaction between the gaseous molecule and the framework by an entrapment mechanism in which a hydrogen molecule is in close proximity with several aromatic rings to from interpenetrating networks.15,16 Although many intriguing structures containing interpenetration have been constructed and discussed,17 most of them are monometallic coordination polymers. Consequently, control of the architecture of interpenetrating HCMPs is an interesting research branch of crystal engineering. Recently, our group focused on the application of imidazole carboxylic acid ligands as multidentate ligands. We have reported on Sm–Mn and Eu–Ag HMCPs18 implementing 1H-imidazole- 4,5-dicarboxylate. In the present work, 1H-benzimidazole-5,6- dicarboxylic acid (H3bidc) was the multidentate ligand of choice for the following reasons: (i) it was observed that the bridging angle M–Im–M (where M = metal ions and Im = imidazolate) coincides with that of the Si–O–Si angle in zeolites (145◦), giving rise to many new zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs).19 The latter can be applied in CO2 capture and selective separation of industrially relevant gas mixtures.20 (ii) H3bidc is a multidentate and rigid ligand with multiproton donor–acceptor sites, the bidc3- anion possesses two nitrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms giving rise to a variety of coordinations, such as monodentate, chelating, bidentate bridging, monodentate bridging and chelate bridging. Moreover, the collaboration of the two carboxylate groups of the bidc3- anion might connect metal magnetic centers serving as mediators of magnetic exchange.21 (iii) Compared with the ligand 1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate, an extended p-conjugated system is introduced by applying H3bidc, resulting in possible novel structures and properties. Furthermore, the soft silver(I) ion This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Dalton Trans., 2010, 39, 11383–11395 | 11383 Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 01 May 2012 Published on 26 October 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C0DT00579G View Online / Journal Homepage / Table of Contents for this issue easily coordinates with the N-donor atoms with linear, trigonal and tetrahedral coordination environments. These are favorable building blocks for the construction of coordination polymer frameworks.22 Based on the aforementioned points, our aim is to synthesize novel Ln–Ag HMCPs with noteworthy properties by using Ln(NO3)3·6H2O, AgNO3 and H3bidc ligands. In this paper, a systematic investigation of seven Ln–Ag HMCPs under hydrothermal reactions was performed: [CeAg(Hbidc)2(H2O)2] (1) and [LnAg(Hbidc)2]·3(H2O) [Ln = Sm (2), Gd (3), Tb (4), Dy (5), Ho (6), Er (7)]. To the best of our knowledge, complexes 2– 7 are rare examples of two-fold interpenetrating 4d–4f HMCPs. The successful preparation of the seven coordination polymers provides valuable information for further construction of interpen- etrating 4d–4f 3D HMCPs. The complexes were fully characterized and the luminescence properties of complexes 1–7 were analyzed, they exhibit the characteristic transitions of the corresponding lanthanide ions. Magnetic tests of complexes 1–7 were carried out and the result reveals an antiferromagnetic coupling in complex 3. Experimental section Materials All chemicals purchased were of reagent grade and used without further puriﬁcation. All syntheses were carried out in 23 mL Teﬂon-lined autoclaves under autogenous pressure. The reaction vessels were ﬁlled to approximately 50% volume capacity. Water used in the synthesis was distilled before use. Physical measurements The elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were carried out apply- ing a Perkin–Elmer 240 C elemental analyzer; FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet IR-470 spectrometer using KBr pellets. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the samples were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (BRUKER D8 ADVANCE) with Cu-Ka radiation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were performed on a NETZSCH TG 209 instrument with a heating rate of 5 ◦C min-1. Luminescence spectra were recorded on a FS920 steady state ﬂuorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) equipped with a Hamamatsu R928P red- sensitive photomultiplier (wavelength range from 200 to 850 nm) and a Ge infrared detector (700–1600 nm). Luminescence decay measurements were obtained with a pulsed nitrogen laser (excita- tion wavelength of 337 nm, pulse length of 800 ps, repetition rate of 1 Hz) and a 1024-channel Intensiﬁed CCD (Andor Technology) attached to a 0.5 m Ebert monochromator. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibilities were measured on a Quantum Design MPMS-7 SQUID magnetometer. Diamagnetic corrections were made with Pascal’s constants for all constituent atoms. X-Ray crystallographic study The collection of single crystal crystallographic data was carried out on a Bruker SMART Apex CCD diffractometer using graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (0.71073 A˚ ) at 293 K in the w-2q scan mode. An empirical absorption correction was applied to the data using the SADABS program. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least- squares methods on F2 using the SHELXTL crystallographic software package.23 All non-H atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. The H atoms were placed in calculated positions and reﬁned by using a riding mode. For 1, reﬁnement in an orthorhombic space group Pna2(1) using a racemic twin model and employing the TWIN and BASF instructions resulted in a in a BASF (relative batch scale factor) of 0.5. The crystallographic data, selected bond lengths and angles for 1–7 are listed in Tables 1 and 2.

Results and discussion [CeAg(Hbidc)2(H2O)2] (1) An ORTEP view of 1 (Fig. 1) shows that the Ce(III) center is coordinated with ten oxygen atoms, eight oxygen atoms derived from four carboxylate groups with chelating modes and two oxygen atoms derived from water molecules (Fig. 1). The Ce(III)– O distances range from 2.522(3) to 2.773 A˚ , the average bond length of Ce(III)–O is 2.605(4) A˚ , similar to the reported Ce(III)– O distance 2.588 A˚ ;24 the O–Ce(III)–O bond angles vary from 48.68(11) to 175.78(11)◦. Concerning the Ag(I) ion, it exhibits a trigonal geometry, being coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two different Hbidc2- ligands (Ag(I)–N(2)#3, 2.171(4) A˚ ; Ag(I)– N(3)#4, 2.173(4) A˚ ) and an oxygen atom from one carboxylate group (Ag(I)–O6, 2.545(3) A˚ ). Since the H3bidc ligands possess a wide variety of coordination motifs, a schematic representation of the different coordination modes is depicted in Scheme 1. In complex 1, the H3bidc ligands exhibit two new bridging modes which have not been reported previously (Scheme 1, k and l): one acts as a m3 bridge between two Ce(III) ions and one Ag(I) ion; the other one acts as a m4 link between two Ce(III) ions and two Ag(I) ions. Based on these coordination modes of the H3bidc ligands, a one-dimensional heterometallic chain with Ce(III)–Ag(I) connections is formed (Fig. 2). All the Ce(III) centers are linked by double carboxylate bridges and Ag(I) centers are anchored to the Ce(III)–carboxylate chain through Ag–N bonds of the benzimidazole ring. This type of construction is unusual in the ﬁeld of heterometallic coordination polymers. The one-dimensional heterometallic chains are joined together by carboxylate groups of the Hbidc2- ligand to form two- dimensional nets that are further connected by Ag(I)–O bonds, resulting in the overall 3D framework, as shown in Fig. 3. The topological approach is a good way to understand the nature of the complicated framework as it could lead to reduced multidimensional structures. Based on the topological approach of the simpliﬁcation principle, the Ag(I) ion can be deﬁned as This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Dalton Trans., 2010, 39, 11383–11395 | 11385

The new coordination modes described in this paper are given by modes k–n. Fig. 2 One-dimensional heterometallic chain in 1. 3-connected nodes and the Ce(III) ion can be deﬁned as 4- connected nodes, the Hbidc2- ligand can be deﬁned as 3-connected and 4-connected nodes. Consequently, the topological mode of 1 can be described as a 3,3,4,4-connected{4.82}{4.84.10} topological framework, as depicted in Fig. 4. Furthermore, p–p interaction occurs between the benzimidazole rings of Hbidc2- in the frame- works giving extra stability to the 3D heterometallic framework; the centroid distances are 3.520 and 3.520 A˚ , respectively. [LnAg (Hbidc)2]·3(H2O) [Ln = Sm (2), Gd (3), Tb (4), Dy (5), Ho (6), Er (7)] Since 2–7 are isostructural and crystallize in an orthorhombic manner with space group Pccn, only structure 5 is described in detail as a typical example. An ORTEP view of polymer 5 is shown in Fig. 5, there are one Dy(III) ion, one Ag(I) ion and two crystallographically unique Hbidc2- ligands in one asymmetric unit of 5. The center Dy(III) ion is eight coordinated by one chelating bidentate carboxylate group (O5 and O6), ﬁve di- monodentate carboxylate groups (O3, O1, O5A, O2A and O4A), and a monodentate carboxylate group (O8A), which provide a distorted square-antiprismatic coordination geometry. The bond length of Dy(III)–O ranges from 2.290(3) to 2.543(3) A˚ , the average bond length of Dy(III)–O is 2.358(3) A˚ , the O–Dy(III)–O bond angle ranges between 68.73(11)◦and 152.17(11)◦. The Ag(I) center is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two Hbidc2- ligands (Ag(I)–N1, 2.129(4) A˚ and Ag(I)–N4A, 2.124(4) A˚ ), the coordination geometry of the Ag(I) ion can be described as a distorted linear geometry (N1–Ag(I)–N4A is 168.49(15)◦). It is appealing that there are two types of Hbidc2- ligands with different conformation and binding modes, (Scheme 1, m and n): one behaves as a m4-Hbidc2- mode linking three Dy(III) ions and one Ag(I) ion (Scheme l, m); the other acts as a m3- Hbidc2- mode connecting two Dy(III) ions and one Ag(I) ion with two bidentate and one monodentate mode (Scheme 1, n). Accordingly, the Dy(III) ions are associated together through m2- O7 and two carboxylate groups to give rise to the Dy(COO)4 - rod substructure along the y-direction (Fig. 6), in which the distance of adjacent Dy(III) is 4.452 A˚ . Further, the rod substructures were linked by the fragments of Hbidc2- ligands and Ag(I) to create the four-connecting rod 3D packing architecture, as depicted in Fig. 7a. It is interesting that the overall framework contains two sets of frameworks. Each set exists of a one-dimensional rectangular channel along the y-direction and a considerable void space remains (ca. 411.4 A˚ 3, equal to 10.8% of the cell volume)25 (Fig. 7b). Uncoordinated water molecules act as guest molecules and further ﬁll in its residual void. According to the simpliﬁcation principle of the topological analysis, Dy(III) ions can be deﬁned as 5-connected nodes and the Ag(I) can be deﬁned as a line, Hbidc2- ligands can be deﬁned as 3-connected and 4-connected nodes. As a result, compound 5 reveals a 3,4,5-connection with a {4.82}{42.6.82.10}{46.64} topological 3D framework, the topological mode is shown in Fig. 8. To our knowledge, this is a rare example of 4d–4f heterometallic coordination polymers with a 3,4,5-connected two-fold interpenetrating 3D framework. The Ln–O bond length of these seven compounds declines with decreasing radii of the Ln ion and vary from 2.6054(1) to 11388 | Dalton Trans., 2010, 39, 11383–11395 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 01 May 2012 Published on 26 October 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C0DT00579G View Online Fig. 3 Three-dimensional framework of 1.

TGA and PXRD TGA was carried out using polycrystalline samples of 1–7 in a temperature range of 20–550 ◦C (Fig. 9). The ﬁrst weight loss of polymer 1 from 80 to 170 ◦C amounts to 5.50%, corresponding to the loss of the two coordinating water molecules (calcd. 5.20%). From 170 to 420 ◦C, the weight loss 54.30% (calcd 54.36%) is attributed to the removal of organic moieties. Above 420 ◦C, there is almost no mass modiﬁcation; Ce2O3 and Ag2O were obtained representing the remaining mass, 40.51% (calcd 40.44%). For 2, the ﬁrst weight loss takes place between 95 and 210 ◦C, the total weight lost in this temperature range is 7.55% corresponding to the loss of three uncoordinated water molecules (calcd. 7.49%). The subsequent weight loss, 51.74%, occurred from 270 to 458 ◦C, which was due to the loss of the Hbidc2- ligand (calcd. 51.69%), and ﬁnally Sm2O3 and Ag2O were obtained. TGA analyses for 3–7 are comparable with the analysis of 2. 11390 | Dalton Trans., 2010, 39, 11383–11395 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 01 May 2012 Published on 26 October 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C0DT00579G View Online Fig. 8 The three-dimensional topology framework of 5. The pink balls represent Dy atoms, 3-connected nodes. The violet balls and turquoise balls stand for 4-connected and 5-connected nodes, respectively. Fig. 9 TGA curves of 1–7. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of polymers 1–7 has been performed at room temperature (see the ESI†). The perceived patterns for 1–7 are in good agreement with the calculated patterns obtained from the single-crystal structures. This conﬁrms that the single-crystal structure is really representative of the bulk for the corresponding samples. Luminescent properties Compounds 2, 4 and 5 show emission spectra typical for the 4f–4f transitions, as encountered in most trivalent lanthanide ions, and their photoluminescence emission and excitation spectra are depicted in Fig. 10. The emission spectra are dominated by 4f– 4f transitions from the rare earth ions Sm3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+, respectively. For 2, the emission lines are situated in the red part of the visible spectrum resulting from the transitions from the 4G5/2 excited state to the 6HJ levels, with J = 5/2, 7/2, 9/2, 11/2 for the emission peaks at 561 nm, 595 nm, 642 nm and 704 nm, respectively. For 4, the emission spectrum is dominated by the 545 nm emission line, following the 5D4 to 7F5 transition. The other emission lines are originating from the same excited state and terminating at the 7FJ manifold. For 5, three main emission peaks are found at 482 nm, 575 nm and 664 nm, originating from the 4F9/2 to 6H15/2, 6H13/2 and 6H11/2 transitions. All compounds can be efﬁciently excited in the range from 250 to 350 nm. The emission intensity is much weaker for 2 and 5 compared to 4, and a broad emission band can be observed in 2 and 5 besides the 4f–4f emission lines. In Fig. 10, the excitation spectrum for this broad emission band in 5 is shown upon monitoring the emission at 600 nm. The broad excitation band from 300 to 500 nm is clearly different from the excitation spectrum of the 4f– 4f transitions. The origin of this broad emission band is probably related to the ligand (see below). Fig. 11 shows the decay proﬁle for compounds 2, 4 and 5 upon excitation at 337 nm with a pulsed nitrogen laser. The decay proﬁles could be ﬁtted with three exponentials exp(-t/t i) over (almost) three orders of magnitude. The ﬁtted decay constants (and their relative contribution to the total luminescent output) are 0.15 ms (5%), 1.6 ms (55%) and 4.9 ms (40%) for 2, 0.09 ms (13%), 0.31 ms (44%), 0.80 ms (43%) for 4, and 0.15 ms (8%), 0.60 ms (71%), 1.8 ms (21%) for 5. The displayed intensity in Fig. 11 contains only the intensity of the 4f–4f emission lines. The broad emission band in 2 and 5 (Fig. 11) has a decay time below the detection limit of the used setup (20 ns). The decay for the Sm3+ (2) and Dy3+ (5) compounds is very fast as normally a decay time in the ms range is expected for the spin- forbidden 4f–4f transition occurring in these trivalent rare earths. This shortening is indicative of a strong inﬂuence of non-radiative decay paths, which is closely connected to the low efﬁciency of the photoluminescence in these compounds (vide supra). Compound 4 (Tb3+) shows a much brighter photoluminescence, which is reﬂected in the much longer decay times, almost being in the ms range. Compounds 3, 6 and 7 do not show 4f–4f based emission lines. For compound 3 this is not surprising, as the emission of Gd3+ is normally found around 32000 cm-1, which is readily absorbed.

(Thick lines) Excitation spectra for the photoluminescence in 2, 4 and 5 upon monitoring at 642 nm, 545 nm, 600 nm (a) and 575 nm (b). For Er3+ (compound 7) no emission around 550 nm was found and it was veriﬁed that no infrared emission around 1550 nm was present either. Fig. 12 shows its emission spectrum upon excitation at 330 nm, along with the emission spectrum for the ligand (which is similar to earlier reports21d). The emission spectrum of 7 (Er3+) bears large similarity with the one for the ligand, albeit with much lower intensity. Around 523 nm, the emission spectrum shows a characteristic dip, corresponding to Er3+ absorption. Consequently, the Er3+ ions are optically active, but their emission is fully quenched, at least at room temperature. Also for compound 6 (Ho3+), no typical 4f–4f emission lines are observed, which is not uncommon due to the many cross-relaxation decay paths. The emission spectrum for the Ce3+ compound 1 is rather similar to the one for the ligand, and the typical, spin–orbit split 5d–4f emission is not observed. Decay measurements on 1 showed that all the light is emitted within 20 ns after the laser pulse, which is consistent with the decay time of the ligand (1.3 ns,21d), but not with the common decay constant for Ce3+ (tens of ns,26). Based on the emission spectrum and the decay behavior, it is unlikely that any Ce3+ emission occurs in 1.

Magnetic properties Fig. 13 shows the temperature dependence of cMT (cM stands for the molar magnetic susceptibility) for 1. These data were measured in an applied ﬁeld of 1000 Oe over the temperature range of 2–300 K. The cMT value is equal to 0.79 cm3 K mol-1 at room temperature, which is close to the theoretical value of 0.80 cm3 K mol-1, based upon one Ce3+ ion in the 2F5/2 ground state (g = 6/7).27 When lowering the temperature, the value of cMT decreases to 0.46 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The cM -1 vs. T plot above 50 K follows the Curie–Weiss law 1/cM = (T - q)/C with C = 0.66 cm3 K mol-1 and q = -19.67 K. Although a negative value of q and decreasing values of cMT were found in 1, we could not make any conclusion about the existence of antiferromagnetic coupling between two Ce3+ ions.

The thermal variation of the cMT product for 2 is presented in Fig. 14. The cMT value is 0.209 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K, which is higher than the theoretical value of 0.09 cm3 K mol-1 based upon one Sm3+ ion in the 6H5/2 ground state (g = 2/7).23 With decreasing temperature, the cMT value rapidly declines to a minimum of 0.00135 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K in nearly linear relation. The cM -1 vs. T plot obeys the Curie–Weiss law 1/cM = (T - q)/C with C = 15.42 cm3 K mol-1 and q = -95.82 K. The magnetic susceptibilities can be ﬁtted based on a Hamiltonian of the type H = -J S1.S2 for Heisenberg inﬁnite chain mode (for ﬁtting equation see ESI†).28 The best ﬁt to the magnetic susceptibilities of 2 in the whole temperature range leads to the parameters J = -0.00102 cm-1, zj¢ = -0.0001 cm-1, g = 0.286, R = 1.76 ¥ 10-5 (R = [cmol)obs - (cmol)cal]2/[(cmol)obs]2. The negative J value indicates the presence of very weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the adjacent Sm(III) ions. Fig. 14 Temperature dependence of the cMT (□) and cM -1 () curve for 2. The red line and green line represent the best ﬁt of the curve. The magnetic susceptibilities of 3 were measured in the temper- ature range from 2 to 300 K and under 1000 Oe ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 15. The cMT value is 7.80 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K, which is close to the theoretical value of 7.88 cm3 K mol-1 based upon one Gd3+ ion in the 8S7/2 ground state (g = 2).27 By cooling, the cMT value slightly decreases until 25 K, and below 25 K, the cMT value decreases quickly to a minimum of 6.47 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The cM -1 vs. T plot obeys the Curie–Weiss law 1/cM = (T - q)/C with C = 7.63 cm3 K mol-1 and q = -0.45 K, as shown in Fig. 16. Fig. 15 Temperature dependence of the cMT curve for 3 (□), 4 (), 5 (△), 6 (▽) and 7 (). The red line represents the best ﬁt of the curves for 3. Fig. 16 Temperature dependence of the cM -1 curve for 3 (□), 4 (), 5 (△), 6 (▽), and 7 (). The red, green, blue, wine and pink lines respectively represent the best ﬁt of the curves for 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Judging the trend of the cMT value and the negative value of q, it is possible to conﬁrm the existence of antiferromagnetic coupling between two Gd3+ ions. Taking into account the larger value of the local interacting spin (SGd = 7/2), the classical spin expression derived by Fisher to describe the magnetic behavior of a chain with large spins applies for 3 based on Hamiltonian ˆH = -RJiJi + 1. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility is given by the following equation:25 c b c chain Gd Ng kT u u S S u u = + − + = + − 2 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 ( ) The Langevin function m is deﬁned as u = coth(JcS(S + 1)/kT) - kT/JcS(S + 1). The ﬁtting procedure for 3 leads to J = -0.01 cm-1, with g = 1.98 (R = 6.7 ¥ 10-4, R = [(cmol)obs - (cmol)cal]2/[(cmol)obs]2. The negative J value indicates the presence of very weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the adjacent Gd(III) ions. Comparing this conclusion with previous ﬁndings which unanimously document the existence of an antiferromag- netic coupling in homopolynuclear gadolinium complexes,30–32 in which the coupling constants vary from -0.0057 cm-1 to -0.053 cm-1. The magnetic susceptibilities data of 4, 5, 6, 7 were measured in the temperature range from 2 to 300 K under a 1000 Oe ﬁeld, and are shown in Fig. 15, The cMT values are respectively 11.54 cm3 K mol-1, 14.11 cm3 K mol-1, 13.93 cm3 K mol-1 and 11.46 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K, which approaches the theoretical values of 11.82 cm3 K mol-1, 14.17 cm3 K mol-1, 14.07 cm3 K mol-1 and 11.48 cm3 K mol-1, respectively, based upon one Tb3+ ion in the 7F6 ground state (g = 3/2), one Dy3+ ion in the 6H15/2 ground state (g = 4/3), one Ho3+ ion in the 5I8 ground state (g = 5/4) and one Er3+ ion in the 4I15/2 ground state (g = 6/5).27 The trends of the temperature dependence of the cMT (D) curve for 4, 5, 6 and 7 are similar to the curve of 3. However, their minimum values were 7.22 cm3 K mol-1, 9.90 cm3 K mol-1, 6.85 cm3 K mol-1 and 5.74 cm3 K mol-1, respectively. The cM -1 vs. T plots of 4, 5, 6 and 7 obey the Curie–Weiss law 1/cM = (T - q)/C, which are depicted in Fig. 16, corresponding to Curie constants C = 1.16 cm3 K mol-1, 11.85 cm3 K mol-1, 14.24 cm3 K mol-1 and 8.30 cm3 K mol-1, and Weiss constants q = -0.31 K, -4.40 K, -8.29 K and -6.80 K, respectively. However, the trends of the cMT values and the negative value of q cannot unambiguously conﬁrm antiferro- magnetic coupling between two adjacent Tb3+/Dy3+/Ho3+/Er3+ ions. Under the inﬂuence of the interelectronic repulsion and This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Dalton Trans., 2010, 39, 11383–11395 | 11393 Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 01 May 2012 Published on 26 October 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C0DT00579G View Online spin–orbit coupling, the 4f1–13 conﬁguration of a Ln3+ ion is split in to 2S+1LJ spectroscopic levels. Each of these states is further split into Stark sublevels by the crystal ﬁeld. The number of Stark sublevels depends on the site symmetry of the Ln3+ ions. At room temperature, all Stark sublevels of the 2S+1LJ ground state are thermally populated. As the temperature decreases, a depopulation of these sublevels occurs and consequently cMLnT decreases. Only judging on the negative value of q and the decreasing trend of values of cMLnT, it is impossible to be certain of the existence of antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic coupling between adjacent Ln3+ ions, except for gadolinium(III), whose fn conﬁguration is f7 (L = 0, S = 7/2), and the orbital momentum is completely quenched in the ground state. Conclusion In summary, we have successfully constructed seven novel Ln–Ag heterometallic coordination polymers. 1 showed a {4.82}{4.84.10} topological framework, 2–7 are the ﬁrst structurally characterized 4d–4f polymers with a (43.65.82)(46.64) topological framework, containing two-fold interpenetration layers. The complexes 2, 4 and 5 exhibit characteristic lanthanide luminescence of rare earth ions Sm3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+, respectively. The magnetic behavior of 3 presents typical weak antiferromagnetic interaction with an exchange coupling constant J = - 0.01 cm-1. The investigation of this series of polymers provides a rational synthetic strategy for the construction of novel materials.
