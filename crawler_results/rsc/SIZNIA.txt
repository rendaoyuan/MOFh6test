Manuscript CrystEngComm PAPER Cite this: CrystEngComm, 2014, 16, 6433 Received 24th January 2014, Accepted 13th March 2014 DOI: 10.1039/c4ce00187g www.rsc.org/crystengcomm Structural diversity of 5-methylnicotinate coordination assemblies regulated by metal-ligating tendency and metal-dependent anion effect† Cheng-Peng Li, Jing Chen, Peng-Wen Liu and Miao Du* Nine 5-methylnicotinate (L–CH3 −) coordination complexes, namely, {[Ni(L–CH3)2(H2O)2](H2O)}n (1), [Ni2(L–CH3)4(H2O)]n (2), Ni(HL–CH3)2Cl2 (3), [Cd2(L–CH3)2(SO4)(H2O)6]n (4), [Cd(L–CH3)2(H2O)]n (5), {[Cu(L–CH3)2(H2O)2](H2O)}n (6), {[Co(L–CH3)2(H2O)2](H2O)}n (7), [Mn(L–CH3)2(H2O)2]n (8), and [Pb(L–CH3)2]n (9), were synthesized with different metal salts. For complexes 1–3, the use of different NiII salts (SO4 2−, OAc−, or Cl−) leads to three distinct coordination motifs, including a 3D lvt framework, a 3D self- interpenetrating (3·4·5)(32·43·53·6·74·82) network, and a mononuclear species, respectively. For CdII, two different 1D chain complexes can be assembled from HL–CH3 with CdSO4 (4) and Cd(OAc)2 or CdCl2 (5). However, such an anion effect has not been observed for the CuII (6), CoII (7), MnII (8), and PbII (9) com- plexes, which show a 3D lvt network for 6 and 7, a 2D (4,4) layer for 8, and a 3D (3,5)-connected (4·62)(4·67·82) network for 9. These results demonstrate that the diverse coordination motifs for 1–9 (from 0D, 1D, 2D, to 3D) can be effectively adjusted by the metal-ligating tendency and metal-dependent counter- anion effect. Thermal stability and solid-state fluorescence have also been investigated. Introduction The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of coordination polymers, promoted by their appealing network architectures and topologies, as well as their promising appli- cations in gas adsorption or separation, catalysis, ion- exchange, luminescence, and magnetism etc.1–3 As a conse- quence, intensive research has been focused on preparing such molecule-based materials with specific features in the lattice structures and properties or functions.4 However, it is still challenging to rationally design and predictably synthe- size the desired crystalline products thus far. In essence, their structural and functional diversity can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as the choice of building tectons (metal ions or organic ligands) as well as the solvent, counterion, template, temperature, and pH value etc.5–9 Thus, it will be of great significance to illustrate the role of such factors in the assemblies and also their effect on the final products. In our previous work, we have systematically explored the effect of solvent media, halogen substituents of ligands, and synthetic methods on the structural assemblies of 5-halonicotinic acid (HL–X, X = F, Cl, or Br) based coordina- tion systems, which interestingly result in dynamic and solvent-sensitive crystalline materials.10 As a continuation of this attractive project, we present here our recent progress on coordination assemblies of 5-methylnicotinic acid (HL–CH3) with different metal salts. As a result, nine new complexes were prepared at room temperature, formu- lated as {[Ni(L–CH3)2(H2O)2](H2O)}n (1), [Ni2(L–CH3)4(H2O)]n (2), Ni(HL–CH3)2Cl2 (3), [Cd2(L–CH3)2(SO4)(H2O)6]n (4), [Cd(L–CH3)2(H2O)]n (5), {[Cu(L–CH3)2(H2O)2](H2O)}n (6), {[Co(L–CH3)2(H2O)2](H2O)}n (7), [Mn(L–CH3)2(H2O)2]n (8), and [Pb(L–CH3)2]n (9). Of particular significance is their structural diversity, ranging from a mononuclear pattern to 3D coordi- nation networks, which can be properly regulated as a conse- quence of the different geometries of the metal centers and also the counter-anions of the inorganic salts used in the reactions (see Scheme 1). Notably, anion-regulated assem- blies have been mostly observed in coordination systems with neutral organic ligands,11 where the anions must be included CrystEngComm, 2014, 16, 6433–6443 | 6433 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 College of Chemistry, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Structure and Performance for Functional Molecules, MOE Key Laboratory of Inorganic–Organic Hybrid Functional Material Chemistry, Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin 300387, PR China.

In contrast, the anion effect on coordination structures with potential anionic tectons (just like 5-methylnicotinic acid herein) is quite rare,6c which is of further interest as it is metal- dependent (only for NiII and CdII instead of CuII, CoII, MnII, and PbII). Experimental Materials and general methods All the reagents and solvents were commercially available. Elemental analyses of C, H, and N were measured on a CE-440 (Leemanlabs) analyzer. Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra (KBr pellets) were recorded on an AVATAR-370 (Nicolet) spec- trometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were taken on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer for a Cu-target tube (λ = 1.5406 Å). The calculated PXRD patterns were obtained from the single-crystal diffraction data using PLATON software.12 Thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) curves were performed on a NETZSCH TG209 (Siemens) thermal analyzer under a N2 atmosphere in 25–800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Fluorescence spectra of the solid samples were taken on a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Varian) at room temperature. Syntheses of complexes 1–9 General synthetic approach: A water solution (10 mL) of the ligand HL–CH3 (0.2 mmol) was mixed with a water solution (10 mL) of the metal salt (0.1 mmol) under stirring for ca. two hours, which was filtered and left to stand at room tempera- ture. Upon slow evaporation of the solvent, good-quality single- crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis can be obtained. {[Ni(L–CH3)2(H2O)2](H2O)}n (1). Metal salt: NiSO4.

Generally, C-bound H atoms were placed geometrically and refined as riding atoms, while O-bound H atoms were first determined in difference Fourier syntheses and then fixed at the calculated positions. For 4, the oxygen atoms (O11–O14) of the sulfate were treated by using the dis- ordered model (with 0.72 and 0.28 occupancy, respectively) to achieve the proper thermal parameters. Further crystallo- graphic details are listed in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for 1–9 are shown in Table S1 (see the ESI†). Results and discussion Synthesis and general characterization Complexes 1–9 were prepared under similar reaction conditions by assembling the HL–CH3 ligand with different metal salts. Interestingly, for the case of NiII, three distinct crystal- line products, 1–3, can be obtained when different anions (SO4 2−, OAc−or Cl−) were used. For CdII, two 1D complexes, 4 and 5, were produced from SO4 2−and OAc−/Cl−salts, respec- tively. However, with regard to the CuII, CoII, MnII, and PbII complexes, the products will be independent to the anions of the metal salts. Notably, due to the poor solubility of PbSO4 in water, only Pb(OAc)2 and PbCl2 were used in the assembly reactions. All the complexes were characterized by IR spectra and elemental analyses. For the IR spectra of 1–9, the absence of the characteristic absorption band of carboxyl (ca. 1700 cm−1) confirms a complete deprotonation of the ligand. In addition, a very strong band is observed at 1116 cm−1 in the IR spectrum of 4, corresponding to the existence of the sulfate anion. Notably, complexes 1–9 were mostly obtained as well-shaped crystals but with more or less concomitant poly- crystalline powders. The phase purity of the bulk samples was confirmed by PXRD patterns, which agree well with the calculated ones (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Crystal structures of complexes 1–9 {[Ni(L–CH3)2(H2O)2](H2O)}n (1). The reaction of NiSO4 with HL–CH3 gives the 3D coordination polymer 1. The asymmetric unit contains two half-occupied NiII ions, two crystallographically independent L–CH3 −ligands, two water ligands, and one lattice water guest (see Fig. 1a). Both NiII ions show similar distorted octahedral coordination spheres, completed by two pyridyl nitrogen donors from two L–CH3 − ligands (N1/N1A for Ni1 and N2/N2D for Ni2), four oxygen atoms from two carboxylate groups of two L–CH3 −(O4/O4A for Ni1 and O1B/O1c for Ni2) and two water molecules (O5/O5A for Ni1 and O6/O6D for Ni2). In 1, each L–CH3 −ligand bridges two adjacent NiII centers with the unidentate mode of carboxylate to construct a 3D coordination network (see Fig. 1b).

View Article Online 6438 | CrystEngComm, 2014, 16, 6433–6443 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 provides a convenient tool for designing and understanding the complicated crystal structures of coordination polymers or H-bonding complexes. These structures can be reduced to simplified topological networks with the different connectiv- ity of the tectons. Herein, each NiII center can be considered as a planar 4-connected node, which is linked to four equiva- lent nodes through the 2-connected L–CH3 −spacers, with a dihedral angle of 48.9(1)° for the adjacent [NiN2O2] units. As a result, a uninodal 4-connected lvt net15 is afforded with the point symbol of (42·84)16 (see Fig. 1c). The lattice water mole- cules are also hydrogen bonded to the coordination frame- work by multiple O–H⋯O interactions, with H⋯O/O⋯O distances of 1.90–2.06/2.711(1)–2.901(1) Å and O–H⋯O angles of 158–175°. [Ni2(L–CH3)4(H2O)]n (2). Using Ni(OAc)2 in 2 instead of NiSO4 in 1 results in another 3D coordination polymer. The asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically independent NiII atoms, four crystallographically independent L–CH3 −ligands, and one water ligand (see Fig. 2a). The coordination geometries of Ni1 and Ni2 are similar distorted octahedra, which are provided by two pyridyl nitrogens from two L–CH3 −ligands (N1/N2 for Ni1 and N3A/N4 for Ni2), three carboxylate oxygen atoms from three L–CH3 −ligands (O3A/O6B/O8 for Ni1 and O2C/O4A/O7 for Ni2), and one water ligand (O9). With the aid of μ2-H2O and μ2-COO−bridges, a [Ni2(H2O)(COO)2] dimeric unit is formed, with a Ni⋯Ni separation of 3.551(1) Å. Furthermore, such dinuclear motifs are extended by μ2- and μ3-L–CH3 − ligands (with unidentate and bridging carboxylates, respectively) to construct a 3D coordination framework (see Fig. 2b). Within this framework, the μ3-L–CH3 −ligands interconnect the NiII ions to form 1D chain motifs, while the μ2-L–CH3 −and water ligands link the NiII centers to generate corrugated 2D layers with fes (4·82) topology. Notably, small 1D channels are observed along the [010] direction (609.7 Å3, 10.3% per unit cell volume as calculated by PLATON). Topologically, on the one hand, if we consider each metal ion and ligand as nodes of a simplified net, the NiII and μ3-CH3 −tectons serve as the 6- and 3-connected nodes, respectively, affording a binodal (3,6)-connected network with the point symbol of (3·4·5)(32·43·53·6·74·82) (see Fig. 2c). Of fur- ther interest, this 3D architecture also displays an entangling pattern with a self-interpenetrating feature (Fig. 2c and S2, ESI†).17 On the other hand, if each bimetallic motif [Ni2(H2O)(COO)2] is treated as a node, the 3D framework can be portrayed as a 5-connected noz net with the point symbol of (44·66) (see Fig. S3, ESI†). Ni(HL–CH3)2Cl2 (3). Interestingly, employing NiCl2 in the assembled reaction will yield a mononuclear coordination molecule, 3, in which the NiII ion is four-coordinated by two carboxylate oxygen atoms from a pair of HL–CH3 ligands (O1/O1A) and two chloride anions (Cl1 and Cl1A) (see Fig. 3a). The pyridyl group in the ligand adopts the proton- ated mode to keep the charge balance. As expected, such pro- tonated pyridyl groups are hydrogen-bonded to carboxylate groups (N1–H1A⋯O2i, H⋯O/N⋯O distances = 1.89/2.639(3) Å; N–H⋯O angle = 145°; i = x, 1 + y, z), resulting in a 2D supra- molecular network in which C4–H4⋯Cl1ii interactions (H⋯Cl/C⋯Cl distances = 2.78/3.636(3) Å; C–H⋯Cl angle = 154°; ii = 1 −x, 2 −y, 2 −z) are also observed (see Fig. 3b). Notably, no obvious interlayered interaction is found between these parallel 2D patterns. [Cd2(L–CH3)2(SO4)(H2O)6]n (4). Assembly of HL–CH3 and CdSO4 affords a 1D chain complex, 4. The asymmetric unit consists of two CdII centers, two L–CH3 −ligands, one sulfate anion, and six water ligands. As shown in Fig. 4a, Cd1 is six- coordinated by four water oxygens (O5/O6/O7/O8) and two pyridyl nitrogen donors (N1/N2) from a pair of L–CH3 − ligands to complete a distorted octahedral sphere, while Cd2 is bound to seven oxygen donors from two carboxylates of dif- ferent L–CH3 −ligands (O1/O2/O3A/O4A), two water molecules (O9/O10), and one sulfate (O11). In this case, each L–CH3 − ligand connects two CdII ions via its pyridyl and carboxylate groups, affording a 1D sinusoidal array (see Fig. 4b). Such 1D Fig. 3 Views of 3.

Furthermore, two types of π⋯π stack- ing interactions occur between the pyridyl rings of L–CH3 −, with centroid-to-centroid separations of 3.559(5)/3.605(5) Å and dihedral angles of 0/0.83°, respectively. [Cd(L–CH3)2(H2O)]n (5). Another 1D coordination polymer, 5, can be obtained from the reaction of HL–CH3 with Cd(OAc)2 or CdCl2, where the asymmetric unit comprises one CdII ion, two independent L–CH3 −ligands, and one water ligand. As shown in Fig. 5a, the CdII ion is hexa-coordinated by three carboxylate oxygen donors (O1/O3/O4) and two pyridyl nitrogen atoms (N1B and N2A) coming from four dif- ferent L–CH3 −ligands, and one water molecule (O5) to com- plete a distorted octahedral sphere. Different from that in 4, no counter-anion (acetate or chloride) is involved in the final structure, and the carboxylates from two independent L–CH3 − ligands take chelating (type I) and unidentate (type II) coordi- nation modes, respectively. As a result, the adjacent CdII ions are connected by the L–CH3 −bridges (type I) to produce a 1D linear chain along the b axis with a neighboring Cd⋯Cd dis- tance of 8.107(1) Å. Furthermore, two such linear chains are linked by doubled L–CH3 −ligands (type II) to result in a ladder-like pattern (see Fig. 5b). An intrachain O5–H5A⋯O2 bond between the water ligand and adjacent carboxylate oxy- gen is observed (H⋯O/O⋯O distances = 1.82/2.654(4) Å; O–H⋯O angle = 167°). Moreover, this water ligand also acts as the H-bonding donors of O5–H5B⋯O4i (H⋯O/O⋯O dis- tances = 1.92/2.766(3) Å; O–H⋯O angle = 175°; i = 2 −x, −y, −z), extending such 1D motifs into a 2D layered Fig. 4 Views of 4.

An intralayer aromatic stacking interaction is found between the parallel pyridyl groups, with a centroid-to-centroid distance of 3.637(2) Å. Further investigation of the crystal packing indicates that these 2D layers form a parallel arrangement with no signifi- cant interlayer interaction. {[Cu(L–CH3)2(H2O)2](H2O)}n (6) and {[Co(L–CH3)2(H2O)2](H2O)}n (7). The assembly of HL–CH3 with different CuII and CoII salts (sulfate, acetate, or chloride) similarly produces the 3D complexes 6 and 7, respectively, which are isostructural to 1. Thus, their structures are not described herein. [Mn(L–CH3)2(H2O)2]n (8). The assembly of HL–CH3 with MnII sulfate, acetate, or chloride uniformly yields a 2D grid-like layered coordination polymer, 8. The asymmetric unit contains one MnII center with half occupancy as well as one L–CH3 −and one aqua ligand. The distorted octahedral coordination sphere of MnII is completed by four oxygen donors from two L–CH3 −(O2A/O2B) and two water ligands (O3/O3C), as well as two pyridyl nitrogen atoms (N1/N1C) from two L–CH3 −ligands (see Fig. 6a). The MnII centers are extended by L–CH3 −ligands along two different directions to afford a 2D (4,4) layer with distorted rhombic meshes (see Fig. 6b). Each [Mn4(L–CH3)4] repeating unit possesses diago- nal Mn⋯Mn distances of 10.189(1) and 7.174(1) Å, which are stabilized by intralayer aromatic stacking contacts between the pyridyl groups (centroid-to-centroid distance = 3.599(1) Å and dihedral angle = 10.13°) in L–CH3 −. Within this 2D layer, O–H⋯O interactions are also observed between the water ligands and carboxylate groups of L–CH3 −(H⋯O/O⋯O dis- tances = 1.87–1.97/2.7130(15)–2.8130(16) Å; O–H⋯O angle = 173°). Further investigation of the crystal packing reveals that these 2D layers adopt a parallel arrangement with no signifi- cant interlayer interaction. [Pb(L–CH3)2]n (9). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that complex 9 features a 3D coordination network. The asymmetric unit contains one PbII ion and two crystallo- graphically independent L–CH3 −ligands (see Fig. 7a). Each octahedral PbII geometry is surrounded by five carboxylate oxygens (O1/O2/O3/O4/O4B) and two pyridyl nitrogens (N1A/N2) from five separated L–CH3 −ligands (two μ2-L–CH3 −and three μ3-L–CH3 −). In this case, the carboxylates of the inde- pendent L–CH3 −ligands show different chelating (η-O,O′) or bridging (μ-O,O-η-O,O′) coordination modes. The two types of L–CH3 −ligands are connected to two and three PbII ions, respectively. Thus, a dimeric [Pb2(COO)2] unit is formed with a Pb⋯Pb distance of 4.227(1) Å. Such bimetallic motifs are further extended by the L–CH3 −ligands to result in the final 3D coordination framework (see Fig. 7b). To understand this complicated structure more clearly, the role of μ2-L–CH3 −or μ3-L–CH3 −is respectively analyzed in the structural extension (see Fig. 7c). On the one hand, the neighboring PbII centers are interlinked by the μ2-L–CH3 −ligands to form 1D helical arrays, which wind around the reverse crystallographic 21 axes, with an adjacent Pb⋯Pb distance of 8.260(1) Å. The pitch of each helix is 9.1366(16) Å, which is equal to the length of [010] translation. Notably, the hetero-handed chains are arranged in an alternating fashion to result in the achiral nature of the overall 3D crystalline lattice. On the other hand, each μ3-L–CH3 −ligand links three PbII cen- ters from different helical chains, constructing a 3D coordi- nation network. From the viewpoint of the network topology, the 3D archi- tecture of 9 has a (3,5)-connected (4·62)(4·67·82) net, in which each PbII center can be regarded as a 5-connnected node, and the L–CH3 −ligands are 2- and 3-connected linkers, respectively (see Fig. 7d and S4, ESI†). However, if each bime- tallic [Pb2(COO)2] unit is considered as an isolated 8-connected node, all the L–CH3 − ligands will act as 2-connected spacers to afford a uninodal 8-connected bcu network. Significant diversity of the structural assembly for 1–9 According to our previous results,10 a variety of coordination assembled systems with different 5-halonicotinic acids (HL–X, X = F, Cl, or Br) can be rationally constructed and Fig. 6 Views of 8.

In this work, the strategy of replacing a halogen by a methyl group in the ligand will be of considerable significance for further under- standing the influence of different factors on such coordina- tion assemblies. For complexes 1–9, obvious structural diversification can be observed from their discrete mononuclear motif and infi- nite 1D, 2D, and 3D coordination patterns, which should be mainly assigned to the tendency of the metal coordination as well as the metal-dependent anion effect (for NiII com- plexes 1–3 and CdII complexes 4–5). On the one hand, struc- tural comparison of the coordination assemblies of HL–CH3 with MIISO4 (MII = NiII, CdII, CuII, CoII, or MnII) reveals the significant role of the metal centers, which take different coordination numbers and geometries. In NiII (1), CuII (6), and CoII (7) complexes, each metal ion has a distorted octa- hedral geometry, and a 3D lvt coordination network will be constructed by the μ2-L–CH3 −bridges. In 4, the CdII centers adopt two different coordination spheres (distorted octahe- dron and pentagonal bipyramid), which are extended by the μ2-L–CH3 −bridges to give a 1D sinusoidal chain motif. With regard to the six-coordinated MnII center, a 2D corrugated layer of 8 is formed. On the other hand, a significant anion effect can also be observed to modulate the resulting crystal- line solids. As demonstrated by the NiII complexes 1–3 obtained from different sources of counter-anions, the SO4 2− and OAc−anions with different volumes and charges are not included in the final products of 1 and 2, which will serve as the structural-directing agents to result in their distinct polymeric structures (3D lvt network or 3D (3,6)-connected self-interpenetrated framework). As for the Cl−anion, which shows a stronger binding ability to NiII, it is directly involved in metal coordination as the terminal ligand, which thus leads to the formation of a mononuclear complex 3. Such an anion effect is also similarly observed in the 1D structures of the CdII complexes 4 and 5, with SO4 2−and OAc−/Cl−anions, respectively. The monodentate coordination of SO4 2−towards the CdII center results in the 1D sinusoidal array of 4, compared with the distinct 1D molecular-ladder in 5. It seems that the coordination ability of counter-anions will mostly influence the assemblies, and the volume, shape, and charge of different anions may also potentially direct the final products. Additionally, it should be noted that the anion effect is metal-dependent and only observed for NiII and CdII, which will not be available to other metal-assembled systems with the L–CH3 −ligand. Neverthe- less, at this stage, we cannot make a straight-forward con- clusion on such an anion effect due to its complexity and sensitivity. Thermal stability The thermal stability for complexes 1–9 was studied by TG-DTA experiments (see Fig. S5, ESI†).

The residues similarly start to decompose upon heating to ca. 300 °C and suffer a series of weight losses, which do not stop until 800 °C. Accordingly, two endothermic peaks are observed at 155/342 °C, 155/341 °C, and 156/340 °C, respec- tively, in their DTA curves. In the TG curve of 2, the first weight loss of 2.18% at 79–128 °C indicates the exclusion of a water ligand (calcd: 2.65%). The residue starts to decom- pose upon heating to 330 °C, which does not stop until 800 °C, with one endothermic peak appearing at 409 °C in the DTA curve. The solvent-free complex 3 is thermally stable to ca. 300 °C, in which two steps of weight loss occur and do not end until heating to 800 °C. In the DTA curve, two endo- thermic peaks are found at 362 °C and 410 °C. For 4, the first weight loss of 7.33% at 82–164 °C can be ascribed to the removal of three water molecules (calcd: 7.70%). The residual component starts to decompose upon heating to ca. 280 °C and suffers a series of weight losses, which do not stop until 800 °C. Three endothermic peaks at 147 °C, 340 °C, and 451 °C are observed in the DTA curve. As for 5, elimination of the coordinated water molecule (calcd: 4.47%) is observed at 78–302 °C with a weight loss of 4.17%. With that, the residue starts to decompose and does not stop until 800 °C. Corre- spondingly, two endothermic peaks at 280 °C and 440 °C are observed in the DTA curve. In the TG curve of 8, the first weight loss of 10.13% at 123–204 °C indicates the exclusion of two water ligands (calcd: 9.91%). The residue starts to decompose upon heating to 405 °C and suffers two steps of weight losses, which do not stop until 800 °C. The DTA curve shows two endothermic peaks at 174 °C and 454 °C. Complex 9 remains stable upon heating to 326 °C and suffers a series of weight losses that do not stop until heating to 800 °C. Two endothermic peaks at 376 °C and 492 °C are found in the DTA curve. Fluorescent properties The solid-state fluorescent properties of complexes 4, 5, 9 (with d10 metals) and HL–CH3 were explored at room temper- ature (see Fig. S6, ESI† for the emission spectra). The free HL–CH3 ligand displays the maximum emission peak at 438 nm (λex = 330 nm), which should be attributed to the π →π* and/or n →π* transitions. For 4 and 5, excitation of the microcrystalline samples at 330 nm leads to the genera- tion of intense fluorescent emissions with similar maximum peaks observed at 438 nm, which can be properly assigned to the ligand-centered transitions. Visible enhancement of their emission intensity in comparison to that of the free HL–CH3 ligand can be ascribed to the increased rigidity of the HL–CH3 ligand when bound to the CdII centers, which will effectively reduce the loss of energy. Notably, complex 9 has no obvious emission under similar excitation conditions, probably due to the fluorescence quenching effect of the Pb(II) ion.18 Conclusions Nine diverse coordination assemblies have been achieved from a methyl-substituted nicotinate tecton and NiII, CdII, CuII, CoII, MnII, or PbII salts. Their significant structural divergences can be properly ascribed to the different metal-ligating tendency and unusual metal-dependent anion effect. It has been illustrated that, through this research and our previous results, the MII/HL–X (X = halogen or methyl) assembled systems possess exceptionally high crystallization diversity, which are extremely sensitive to the external param- eters, such as mixed-solvent media, synthetic methods and even anions. These results will provide new insights into the structural design and modulation of coordination polymers through the selection of appropriate building blocks and assembled conditions.
