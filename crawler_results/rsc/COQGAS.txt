Manuscript Mechanosynthesis of new azine-functionalized Zn(II) metal–organic frameworks for improved catalytic performance† Mohammad Yaser Masoomi,‡ Saeideh Beheshti‡ and Ali Morsali* Three 3D, porous Zn(II)-based metal–organic frameworks, TMU-4, TMU-5 and TMU-6, containing azine-functionalized pores, were readily and quickly prepared via mechanosynthesis. Catalytic perfor- mance of these MOFs and the eﬀect of N-donor ligands with diverse basicity in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction are investigated. Increasing the basicity of N-donor ligands leads to improvement in catalytic activity. Results show that among the three compounds, TMU-5 has the highest catalytic activity upon increasing its basicity of azine function in the N-donor ligand. These catalysts maintain their crystalline framework after the reaction and are easily recycled. Knoevenagel condensation of aldehydes with active methylene compounds is a useful transformation that has been widely employed for carbon–carbon bond formation in the synthesis of several ne chemicals.1 The condensation is usually catalysed by solid bases like alkali or alkaline-earth metal oxides.2 Over the last few years, a wide range of catalysts have been investi- gated for this reaction such as Lewis acids,3 amine-functional- ized solid supports,4,5 cation-exchanged zeolites,6 ionic liquids7 and organometallic catalysts.8 However, most of these methods have signicant drawbacks, such as using hazardous and carcinogenic solvents, high catalyst loading or non-recoverable catalysts that sometimes contain toxic metals. Therefore, there is a great need for new catalytic methods that do not have these problems. MOFs have shown a high catalytic activity to promote condensation reactions. Porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) built up from organic linkers and inorganic connectors have recently begun to be explored as heterogeneous catalysts, owing to their well- ordered porous structures, exible and dynamic behaviours in response to guest molecules and designable channel surface functionalities.9 Although the low thermal and chemical stability of MOFs as compared to their inorganic counterparts have restricted their use only under mild conditions, there have been several reports already that showed MOFs can be excellent heterogeneous catalysts for Knoevenagel condensation.10–17 In our previous study the MOFs [Zn2(oba)2(4-bpdb)]n$(DMF)x, TMU-4, and [Zn(oba)(4-bpdh)0.5]n$(DMF)y, TMU-5 18 (H2oba ¼ 4,4-oxybisbenzoic acid, 4-bpdb ¼ 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3-diaza- 1,3-butadiene and 4-bpdh ¼ 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-3,4-diaza-2,4- hexadiene, Scheme 1), have shown selective CO2 adsorption due to presence of two internal Lewis basic sites per ligand in the pore walls. Considering the CO2 adsorption of these compounds, here their performance as heterogeneous catalysts for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction is investigated. To the best of our knowledge, it is the rst report that knoevenagel condensation is performed using MOFs that contain azine- functionalized pores acting as base catalyst. A new 3D MOF, [Zn(oba)(4-bpmb)0.5]n (DMF)z TMU-6 19 (4-bpmb ¼ N1,N4-bis- ((pyridin-4-yl)methylene)benzene-1,4-diamine, Scheme 1), was synthesized by introduction of the phenyl ring in the pillar ligand due to the examination of the basicity of the N-donor ligand and its eﬀect on the considered reaction. Functionali- zation of MOF pore walls with azine groups enables greater interaction between the walls and substrate molecules, thereby increasing catalytic activity of the MOFs. TMU-4 and TMU-6 show 1D, large pores with apertures of about 5.3  9 ˚A and 9.1  8.9 ˚A, respectively, whereas MOF TMU-5 shows 3D, inter- connected, narrow pores with an aperture of about 4.4  6.2 ˚A (Fig. S1, ESI†). Interestingly, three MOFs were synthesized easily and rapidly via mechanochemical reactions.20–28 Macro- scale crystals of TMU-6 MOF, suitable for single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction, were prepared by heating a mixture of Zn(NO3)2$6(H2O), H2oba and 4-bpmb, in DMF at 80 C for 72 hours. In a typical synthesis of TMU-4, TMU-5 and TMU-6 the products were prepared by the mechanochemical reaction (grinding by hand) of a mixture of Zn(OAc)2$2H2O, H2oba and N-donor ligand (4-bpdb, 4-bpdh or 4-bpmb) for 15 minutes.

View Article Online View Journal | View Issue simulated (derived from the single crystal structure of MOFs) and experimental (resulting from the mechanosynthesized powder) powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) patterns are consis- tent18 (Fig. S3†), conrming that the mechanosynthesized TMU- 4, TMU-5 and TMU-6 were structurally identical to TMU-4, TMU- 5 and TMU-6 prepared via conventional heating, respectively. In MOF TMU-4, the V-shaped coordination of the oba ligand plays an important role in the linkage of the nods resulting in a three- dimensional honeycomb framework with double interpenetra- tion (Fig. 1a). Although the double interpenetration is formed to avoid an extremely large void space, but still possesses one- dimensional (1D) open channels in which the internal surface of these pores is functionalized with the azine groups (Fig. 1b, shown in blue) of the 4-bpdb ligands. The 3D framework of TMU-5 (Fig. S1b, ESI†) which is built up from a Zn2(oba)4 paddle-wheel secondary building unit (SBU) is also functional- ized with azine groups (Fig. 1c, shown in blue). However it is surprising that in MOF TMU-6, introduction of the phenyl ring in the pillar ligand induced the formation of a structure similar to TMU-4 but diﬀerent to that of TMU-5. TMU- 6 is also based on a binuclear Zn(II) unit, in which Zn(II) centers are coordinated to four carboxylate O atoms (O2, O3, O4 and O5) from three fully deprotonated oba ligands, and one N atom (N1) from the 4-bpmb ligand (Fig. 1d). The distance between two Zn#1 centers is 3.494 ˚A. In TMU-6, each non-linear (C–O–C ¼ 115.4(3)) dicarboxylate oba ligand binds three consecutive Zn(II) centers from two diﬀerent units (one carboxylate group of an oba ligand adopts a chelating bidentate mode while the other adopts a bridging bidentate mode), thereby forming 2D sheets. The 2D sheets are connected through the linear 4-bpmb, extending the structure in three dimensions. Still the threefold interpenetrated struc- ture in TMU-6 has large 1D pore channels running along the [1 0 1] direction which has free N atoms in pores surface but not azine groups (Fig. 1e and f). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of mechanochemically synthesized TMU-4, TMU-5 and TMU-6 before washing with DMF revealed a unique weight loss occurring in the range of 315–500 C, 290–500 C and 380–500 C, respectively, corre- sponding to the decomposition of each framework (Fig. S2, ESI†). In TMU-6, a 3-fold interpenetrated framework minimizes empty spaces, preventing the network from collapsing while signicantly enhancing stability of the framework.29 To characterize the possible base-type catalytic behavior of TMU-4, TMU-5 and TMU-6, the Knoevenagel condensation reaction in the presence of these three MOFs was performed. Our experiments employed a 1 : 1.1 molar ratio of benzaldehyde and malononitrile in diﬀerent solvents such as ethanol, meth- anol, H2O, n-hexane, acetonitrile, dichloromethane and toluene at room temperature. It can be deduced from these results that higher yields were achieved in polar protic solvents, whereas the reaction occurred with diﬃculty in solvents with lower polarity. However, the reactions under solvent-free conditions were slow. The reaction between aldehydes and active methylene compounds hardly progressed in the absence of MOFs, sug- gesting the potential base-catalytic activity of MOFs in this reaction (Entry 4). As shown in Table 1, best results were obtained when TMU-5 was used as a catalyst. 2 mol% catalyst TMU-5 leads to a 100% yield in H2O as the solvent. Interestingly, catalytic performance of TMU-4 and TMU-5 is higher than that of TMU-6. This may be attributed to lone pair–lone pair electron repulsion and the alpha eﬀect.

View Article Online nitrogen atoms of azine groups destabilize each other by elec- tronic repulsion and hence increase the ground state.30–32 Basicity of TMU-4 and TMU-5 increases based on this criterion, and they become more reactive. TMU-5 has narrower pores because of methyl groups. Thus, interactions of walls with azine groups (as Lewis base) and substrate molecules enhance leading to an increase in its catalytic activity. Catalytic activity of TMU-6 is the lowest, because it does not have an alpha eﬀect that leads to a decrease in the nitrogen density of electrons and therefore reducing the base strength. The eﬃciency of TMU-5 in comparison with various MOFs that have been used as catalysts in the condensation reaction between benzaldehyde and malononitrile is shown in Table 2. The PXRD patterns of catalysts TMU-4, TMU-5 and TMU-6 measured aer the reactions, show the same proles as the as- prepared samples, indicating the unchanged coordination framework although the crystallinity seems to be weakened due to broadening of the diﬀraction peaks (Fig. S4, ESI†).33,34 To further verify the heterogeneity of systems, a procedure similar to Sheldon et al. is performed.35 Aer the reaction mixture was stirred for 10 minutes, removal of the catalyst via ltration resulted in the complete shutdown of the reaction and hence, the systems are totally heterogeneous in nature with no leaching under reaction conditions (Fig. S9–S11, ESI†). Conclusions Three MOFs-[Zn2(oba)2(4-bpdb)]n$(DMF)x (TMU-4), [Zn(oba)- (4-bpdh)0.5]n$(DMF)y (TMU-5) and [Zn(oba)(4-bpmb)0.5]n$(DMF)z (TMU-6) with diﬀerent structures and pore sizes were mechanochemically synthesized quickly on a large scale. The N-donor linkers with various basicity appeared in the walls of all three MOFs which is favorable for the catalytic reaction. These MOFs were used as new solid base catalysts in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. This study demonstrated that the basicity of azine functionalized pores is probably an important factor in the catalytic performance. TMU-5 with narrow and interconnected pores in three dimensions has higher catalytic activity upon increasing basicity of its N-donor ligand. Notes and references 1 L. F. Tietze, Chem.

Thermogravimetric profiles of (a) TMU-4, (b) TMU-5 and (c) TMU-6 isolated by either solvothermal reaction or mechanosynthesis. The TGA curve of TMU-4 (solvothermal reaction) shows a plateau in the range of 30 to 100 ºC followed by a continuous loss of 16.5% (expected: 14.6%) up to 315 ºC, which can be ascribed to removal of the guest DMF molecules. Similarly, the TGA profile of TMU-5 also shows a plateau in the range of 30 to 100 ºC and a loss of DMF molecules of 18% (expected: 19.9%) in the temperature range of 100 to 190 ºC. TMU-5 is thermally stable up to 290 ºC, above which point it begins to decompose. Also TMU-6 shows a plateau in the range of 30 to 100 ºC and a loss of DMF molecules of 16% (expected: 19%) in the temperature range of 100 to 380 ºC. The TGA profiles of the mechanosynthesized TMU-4, TMU-5 and TMU-6 before washing with DMF show plateaus in the range of 30 to 315 ºC, 30 to 290 ºC and 30 to 380 ºC, respectively, reveal that the ﬁrst weight loss correctly attributed to loss of DMF guest molecules.
