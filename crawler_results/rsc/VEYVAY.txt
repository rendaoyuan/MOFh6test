Sevov* Hydrothermal reactions of benzenehexacarboxylic acid, also known as mellitic acid, and transition metal cations in the presence of N-donor ancillary ligands afford five novel coordination polymers with the general formula of [M2(H2mel)(L)(H2O)6]?nH2O, where M = Co, L = 2,29-bpy (1); M = Co, L = 4,49-bpy (2a); M = Ni, L = 4,49-bpy (2b); M = Co, L = tpt (3a); M = Ni, L = tpt (3b). The structures were determined by single- crystal X-ray diffraction. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, and magnetic measurements were also carried out for some of the compounds. All three structures contain the same one-dimensional secondary building units (1D-SBUs), metal–mellitate double chains made of two types of octahedrally-coordinated metal atoms. The 1D-SBUs are stacked on top of each other and held together by very short hydrogen bonds to generate 2D-layers that are also identical in all three structures and can be viewed as two-dimensional tertiary building units (2D-TBUs). The three structures differ in dimensionality due to the different connectivities provided by the different nitrogen-based co-ligands. The chains in 1 are terminated by the chelating 2,29-bpy and are thus isolated. They are interconnected by the 4,49-bpy linker to form two 3D interpenetrating frameworks in 2. The same chains in 3 are interlinked by the bent tri-dentate tpt ligands to form two-dimensional structures. Since all compounds contain the same building unit, only the magnetic properties of one compound, 2a, were measured and analyzed. Introduction Coordination polymers, i.e. extended structures made of metal cations interlinked by multi-dentate organic ligands, are well known for their rich variety of architectures and topologies.1–3 However, while much effort has been invested into enriching further this structural diversity, much less progress has been made towards rational synthesis of desired structures by appropriate selection of organic ligands and metal ions.4–7 Among the successfully predicted structures are those invol- ving di- and tri-carboxylate linkers with rigid aromatic bodies.8–10 At the same time, despite extensive research on structures with such linkers with two or three carboxylic groups, very little attention has been paid to those with four or more carboxylic groups.9c,11,12 One can speculate that the reason for this indifference is most likely the expectation that such multi-carboxylates would form undesirable densely packed structures.12c On the other hand, it can be argued that such overcrowding with functional groups might be beneficial. For example, the overcrowding may force the carboxylate groups to rotate in many different ways out of the aromatic plane and this may result in diverse coordination modes.10a,11d,13 Also, with so many carboxylic groups within such a small volume it is very likely to have some free (non-coordinated) groups that might be accessible to guest molecules or available for hydrogen bonding.14 Only a few examples have been documented for benzene penta- and hexa-carboxylic acids, the latter also known as mellitic acid. Nonetheless, they show that these linkers can build structures with various dimensionalities spanning from one-dimensional polymers to three-dimensional frameworks.15 Although structural diversity can be achieved with aromatic polycarboxylates alone, combining them with various co- ligands can dramatically increase the variety of structures and topologies.16–18 Furthermore, the nature of the second ligand can possibly control the structure dimensionality. Thus, chelating ligands such as 2,29-bipyridine (2,29-bpy) and 1,10- phenanthroline (1,10-phen) are often employed to block multiple coordination sites in order to reduce the dimension- ality of the framework.17 On the other hand, 4,49-bipyridine (4,49-bpy) is a common spacing ligand typically used to increase the dimensionality of the structure.18 In addition, all these N-based planar co-ligands have the potential to participate in p–p interactions that could modulate the supramolecular network even further.19 We have been inter- Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.

The reported com- pounds include [Co4(H2mel)2(2,29-bpy)2(H2O)12]?(H2O) (1), [M2(H2mel)(4,49-bpy)(H2O)6]?(H2O)1/3 where M is Co (2a) or Ni (2b), and [M2(H2mel)(tpt)(H2O)6]?(H2O)0.65 where M is Co (3a) or Ni (3b). All five compounds contain the same one- dimensional motif, a metal–mellitate double chain. The chains in 1 are terminated by the chelating 2,29-bpy and are thus isolated. However, in 2 and 3 they are interlinked by the corresponding bi- and tri-dentate co-ligands to form two- and three-dimensional structures. Experimental section Synthesis All reagents and solvents are commercially available and were used as received without further purification. C, H, and N elemental analyses were conducted on a Costech EAS 4010 elemental analyzer. [Co4(H2mel)2(2,29-bpy)2(H2O)12]?(H2O) (1). A mixture of CoCl2?6H2O (48 mg, 0.20 mmol), 2,29-bpy (31 mg, 0.20 mmol), mellitic acid (17 mg, 0.05 mmol), and H2O (9.0 mL) was heated in a stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner at 140 uC for 48 h and was then cooled slowly. Pink plate crystals of 1 (y30% yield) were obtained as a single phase. Calcd (found) for 1: C, 36.59 (36.64); H, 2.23 (2.14); N, 3.88 (3.80). [Co2(H2mel)(4,49-bpy)(H2O)6]?(H2O)1/3 (2a). A mixture of Co(CH3COO)2?4H2O (25 mg, 0.10 mmol), 4,49-bpy (14 mg, 0.10 mmol), mellitic acid (20 mg, 0.05 mmol), and H2O (12.0 mL) was heated in a stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner at 140 uC for 24 h and was then cooled slowly. Rosy, rectangular block-like crystals of 2a (68% yield) were obtained intermixed with a few colorless crystals. Calcd (found) for 2a: C, 36.20 (36.46); H, 3.18 (3.11); N, 3.84 (3.57). [Ni2(H2mel)(4,49-bpy)(H2O)6]?(H2O)1/3 (2b). The same synth- esis as for 2a but with Ni(NO3)2?6H2O (30 mg, 0.10 mmol) instead of Co(CH3COO)2?4H2O produced sky-blue needle-like crystals of 2b (y50% yield). Compound 2b is isostructural with 2a according to both powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S1 in ESI3) as well as the unit cell parameters obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Calcd (found) for 2b: C, 36.22 (35.85); H, 3.18 (3.25); N, 3.84 (3.85). [Co2(H2mel)(tpt)(H2O)6]?(H2O)0.65 (3a). A mixture of CoCl2?6H2O (75 mg, 0.30 mmol), tpt (14 mg, 0.05 mmol), mellitic acid (18 mg, 0.05 mmol), and H2O (6.0 mL) was heated in a stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner at 140 uC for 24 h and then was cooled slowly. Rosy, block crystals of 3a (y43% yield) formed together with some colorless crystals, which were easily removed. Calcd (found) for 3a: C, 40.59 (40.71); H, 3.07 (2.94); N, 9.47 (9.44). [Ni2(H2mel)(tpt)(H2O)6]?(H2O)0.65 (3b). Similar to the synth- esis of 3a, this synthesis was carried out with NiCl2?6H2O (45 mg, 0.20 mmol) instead of CoCl2?6H2O. Sky-blue plate-like crystals of 3b were obtained. Compound 3b is isostructural with 3a according to powder X-ray diffraction from the samples (Fig. S1, ESI3). Physical measurements Powder X-ray diffraction was performed on a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.5418 Å) (Fig. S1, ESI3). FT-IR spectra of the freshly prepared compounds in crystalline form were recorded on a Bruker TENSOR-27 FT-IR spectrophotometer in ATR mode (Fig. S4, ESI3). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a Bruker APEX-II diffractometer with a CCD area detector and graphite monochromated Mo Ka radiation (l = 0.7107 Å) at 200 K for compounds 1 and 3a, and at 120 K for compound 2a. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares based on F2 using the SHELXL 97 program.20 All hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically with respect to their carrier atoms. They and some non-coordinated solvent water molecules were refined isotropically while all other atoms were refined anisotropically. Details of the structure refinements are summarized in Table 1. The magnetic susceptibility of compound 2a was recorded over the temperature range 2–300 K under an applied field of 1 kOe on a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID system. Also measured was the isothermal magnetization of the compound at 2 K in applied field of up to 7 Tesla. Results and discussion All three structure types reported here contain the one- dimensional motif shown in Fig. 1. These filaments, one- dimensional secondary building units or 1D-SBUs, are made of two types of octahedrally-coordinated metal atoms, internal and external, interlinked by partially deprotonated mellitate linkers (H2mel)42. Both metal atom types have pairs of mellitate molecules in trans-positions. However, while the four remaining sites are taken by water molecules in the internal case, i.e. M(H2mel)2/2(H2O)4, in the external case these four sites are occupied by two water molecules in a cis-position and two nitrogen atoms that are either part of the same chelating ligand or from two shared N-ligands, i.e. M(H2mel)2/2 (H2O)2(L) or M(H2mel)2/2(H2O)2(L)2/2, respectively. It is impor- tant to notice that the nitrogen sites in the latter point outward and are thus available for interconnecting these infinite chains. Each mellitate anion coordinates to four metal atoms, two internal and two external, using the four deprotonated carboxylic groups at positions 1,4 for the internal and 2,5 for the external. The remaining carboxylic groups at positions 3,6 remain protonated giving the linker a charge of 42. Since each linker is coordinated to four metal atoms and each metal atom is coordinated to two linkers, the overall formula of the three 5108 | CrystEngComm, 2013, 15, 5107–5113 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Paper CrystEngComm Published on 25 April 2013.

Not only are the 1D-SBUs for the three structures reported here in common with each other but also the way they are stacked on top of each other and held together by very short hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2 and S2, ESI3) in the range of 2.466(6)– 2.510(6) Å is very similar. The 1D-SBUs are shifted by a half repeating unit with respect to each other along the direction of the filament. This aligns the protonated oxygen atom of a non- coordinated carboxylic group from one SBU on top of the double-bonded oxygen atom of a coordinated carboxylic group from the neighboring SBU and vice versa. These short and multiple hydrogen bonds between the SBUs generate layers common to the three structures and thus can be called two- dimensional tertiary building units or 2D-TBUs. The layers are then packed in such a way that allows for either p–p interactions in 1 or for linking by the 4,49-bpy and tpt ligands in 2 and 3. The three reported structures differ in dimensionality, which results from the different connectivities between the same 1D-SBUs. Thus, the one-dimensional compound 1 has the chelating 2,29-bpy ligand at the external metal atoms blocking two coordination sites and preventing any potential interconnectivity between the chains (Fig. 3a). Although the chains in this compound are crystallographically different with two pairs of cobalt atoms (Co1/Co2 and Co3/Co4) and two mellitate linkers (Fig. 3b and 3c), they are otherwise identical in all other aspects. When stacked in layers or 2D-TBUs as discussed above, these layers are slightly shifted with respect to each other. This shift places the 2,29-bpy molecules from neighboring TBUs close to each other allowing for good p–p interactions (Fig. 3a and 3d) with plane-to-plane distances in Table 1 Crystallographic data for compounds 1, 2a, and 3a Compound 1 2a 3a Formula C44H46Co4N4O37 C22H23Co2N2O18.5 C20H27Co2N6O18.64 Fw 1458.59 729.29 887.76 l, Å 0.71073 0.71073 0.71073 T, K 200 120 200 Space group, Z P1¯, 2 Cmca, 8 P21/c, 4 a, Å 11.3330(7) 32.197(4) 19.986(3) b, Å 15.2656(10) 15.2214(16) 11.382(2) c, Å 15.6223(10) 11.3816(12) 15.228(4) a, u 98.946(3) 90 90 b, u 101.634(3) 90 92.43(3) c, u 90.142(3) 90 90 V, Å3 2613.4(3) 5578.0(1) 3460.9(1) Dc, g cm23 1.836 1.738 1.704 m(Mo Ka), mm21 1.366 1.281 1.052 R1, wR2 [I ¢ 2s(I)] 0.0588, 0.1433 0.0353, 0.0849 0.0486, 0.1023 R1, wR2 (all data) 0.1065, 0.1669 0.0513, 0.0927 0.0806, 0.1177 Fig. 1 The one-dimensional motif, 1D-SBU, common for the three structures has two types of octahedrally-coordinated metal atoms interlinked by mellitate anions (H2mel)42.

View Article Online the range 3.30–3.50 Å that are comparable to values reported in the literature.19,21 Compounds 2a and 2b are isostructural, and only the structure of 2a was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffrac- tion. The same 1D-SBUs and 2D-TBUs observed in compound 1 can be easily identified in 2a as well. However, the 1D-SBUs are now interconnected into a three-dimensional structure by the linking 4,49-bpy ligands (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the linear and rigid nature of the 4,49-bpy molecule combined with the required close to 90u N–Co–N angle for octahedral geometry (Fig. 4b) result in a diverging inter-chain connectivity. Thus, each chain is connected to four other chains via the available four 4,49-bpy ligands, i.e. a pair at each external cobalt atom on the two sides of the chain (Fig. 4b). This square-like pattern, however, generates very large voids and this, in turn, results in the generation of a second identical interpenetrating pattern (Fig. 4c and 4d). The two frameworks interact via the hydrogen bonds between the 1D-SBUs that were already discussed above. Topologically, the frameworks can be simplified and viewed as being made of cluster-like nodes of four metal octahedra linked in one direction by two pairs of mellitates to form the one-dimensional chains and by two pairs of 4,49-bpy ligands in the other two directions (Fig. 4d). This makes each node six- connected as in octahedral networks.22,23 An alternative description of the structure of 2a is to first take into account the hydrogen bonds and recognize the 2D-TBUs. The latter are then interconnected by the 4,49-bpy ligands in such a way to generate two interpenetrating coordination frameworks. Changing the linear 4,49-bpy co-ligand with a bent and non- chelating ligand such as the tpt in compounds 3a and 3b results in two-dimensional sheets made of the 1D-SBUs linked in only one direction. The tpt ligand with its nearly equilateral triangular geometry has the three pyridyl nitrogen atoms positioned at 120u with respect to each other instead of the 180u found in 4,49-bpy. Only two of these nitrogen atoms are coordinated to metal atoms from two different chains while the nitrogen atom on the third arm remains non-coordinated. The bent nature of the tpt ligand (the angle between the Fig. 3 The structure of 1: a) the 2,29-bpy terminated chains (1D-SBUs); b) and c) the local coordination environments around the cobalt atoms; d) the 3D supramolecular structure when the p–p interactions between the bpy ligands and the hydrogen bonding (not shown) are included.

View Article Online coordinated N-atoms and the center of tpt is actually 113.12u) allows for a pair of ligands to bridge two external cobalt atoms from two neighboring linear chains forming a four-membered ring of Co–tpt–Co–tpt (Fig. 5a). Since each repeating chain motif has two such external cobalt atoms, this connectivity results in a flat layer where each chain is linked to two neighboring chains (Fig. 5a and 5b). The layers are stacked in such a way that the protruding outward tpt ligands are inserted between pairs of the same from neighboring layers (Fig. 5c). Again, the structure can be alternatively described as being made of the same 2D-TBUs as those in 1 and 2 but interconnected differently by the tpt ligands (Fig. 5c). Since the three structures have the same building unit with virtually identical metal coordination and metal–ligand inter- actions, their magnetic behavior is essentially identical. Discussed in detail next are the magnetic measurements carried out for compound 2a. The relatively long distances between the metal centers (5.628–8.011 Å) and the modes of ligand coordination suggested absence of magnetic coupling. This was confirmed by both the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and the isothermal magnetization of the compound (Fig. 6 and S3, ESI3). At 300 K, the xmT value per cobalt ion is 2.89 cm3 K mol21 which, as expected for CoII (g = 2, s = 3/2), is larger than the spin-only value of 1.875 cm3 K mol21. This value decreases continuously with the tempera- ture and reaches a minimum of 1.60 cm3 K mol21 at 2 K. This is very close to the expected and observed value of 1.8 cm3 K mol21 for isolated and non-interacting CoII magnetic centers at that temperature.24,25 In addition, the reciprocal molar magnetic susceptibility obeys the Curie–Weiss law in the high- temperature region 40–300 K with a Curie constant of 3.07 cm3 K mol21, which is well in the typically observed range of 2.8– 3.4 cm3 K mol21,24b and with negative Weiss temperature of 216.1 K. The latter is typically associated with antiferromag- netic coupling; however, when combined with the observed xmT curve (analyzed quantitatively below), it is almost exclusively due to the spin–orbit coupling within the isolated CoII magnetic centers. The lack of significant antiferromag- netic interactions is further supported by the absence of a maximum in the molar magnetic susceptibility curve (Fig. 6, insert).25a Lastly, the isothermal magnetization of 2a at 2 K (Fig. S3, ESI3) increases linearly up to 20 kOe of applied field, after which it increases slowly to a near plateau of 2.31 Nb at 70 kOe. This value is well in the range of 2–3 Nb observed for isolated octahedrally-coordinated high-spin CoII ions.26 The relative strength of the spin–orbit coupling and antiferromagnetic exchange in low-dimensional CoII systems can be derived by fitting the observed xmT curve with the equation Fig. 5 The structure of 3: a) and b) two views of the layers formed by the tpt- interlinked 1D-SBUs; c) the layers stacked on top of each other with the tpt linkers inserted between pairs of the same from neighboring layers.

View Article Online xmT = Aexp(2E1/kT) + Bexp(2E2/kT) where the sum A + B equals the Curie constant, while E1 and E2 represent the strengths of the spin–orbit coupling and the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, respectively.25,27 In the case of compound 2a, the fit of the data in the range 2–300 K (Fig. 6) provided the following values: A = 1.177 and B = 1.958 cm3 K mol21; E1 = 38.71 and E2 = 0.30 cm21. The fact that the sum A + B = 3.13 cm3 K mol21 agrees very well with the measured Curie constant of 3.07 cm3 K mol21 (above) is indicative of a well modelled system. The virtually zero value of the E2 parameter means absence of antiferromagnetic interactions. The value of E1 compares very well with those reported in the literature for the effect of spin–orbit coupling and site distortion (E1/k = 55.7 K is consistent with reported E1/k values of up to 100 K).24b Conclusion It is quite amazing that three structures involving two different metals and three very different nitrogen-based co-ligands in addition to a common polycarboxylate ligand can exhibit such a high degree of similarity. It is very likely that the most important common factor in all is the identical degree of partial deprotonation of the mellitate anion to (H2mel)42 which, in turn, must be the result of the same or similar pH of the reaction mixtures. Unfortunately, the latter could not be compared for the three reactions because of the near zero solubility of the tpt and the very poor solubility of the 4,49-bpy in water at normal conditions and the inability to measure pH during the hydrothermal reactions. Nonetheless, it is clear that the resulting (H2mel)42 linker generates the observed very stable linear motif in the presence of metal ions with appropriate oxidation state of 2+, appropriate concentration, and with preference for octahedral coordination. These linear motifs are then stacked and interconnected by appropriate linkers in such a way that allows for strong hydrogen bonds between the chains. It would be interesting to explore in the future other nitrogen-based linkers and chelating ligands in order to study how the structures would depend on the size and shape of these secondary ligands. Lastly, the three structures reported here have available non-coordinated carboxylic groups and, although they are involved in hydrogen bonding, it is perhaps worthwhile to investigate the possibi- lities for post-synthetic access to them.
