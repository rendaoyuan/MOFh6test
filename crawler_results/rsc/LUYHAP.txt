Manuscript A NbO-type metal–organic framework derived from a polyyne-coupled di-isophthalate linker formed in situw Dan Zhao, Daqiang Yuan, Andrey Yakovenko and Hong-Cai Zhou* Received 9th February 2010, Accepted 1st April 2010 First published as an Advance Article on the web 6th May 2010 DOI: 10.1039/c002767g A NbO-type metal–organic framework, PCN-46, was constructed based on a polyyne-coupled di-isophthalate linker formed in situ. Its lasting porosity was conﬁrmed by N2 adsorption isotherm, and its H2, CH4 and CO2 adsorption capacity was examined at 77 K and 298 K over a wide pressure range (0–110 bar). Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a new type of porous materials.1 Their large surface area, high pore volume, uniform yet controllable pore size, and pore geometry make them good adsorbents for gases, such as H2, CH4, and CO2.2 Their gravimetric gas adsorption capacity, especially in the high pressure range, is directly related to the speciﬁc surface area and pore volume.2d,3 The NbO-type MOFs, which consist of 4-connected di-isophthalate ligands and 4-connected secondary building units (SBU) (typically dicopper paddlewheel), have shown excellent framework stability, porosity, and gas adsorption capacity.2f,2g,4 On the other hand, their hydrogen adsorption capacity at room temperature is relatively low because of weak framework–hydrogen inter- actions. In our continuing exploration of MOFs as a hydrogen storage medium, aligned open metal sites have been shown to have an impact on the heat of hydrogen adsorption.5 In addi- tion, double bonds2g and aromatic rings6 were also studied as possible hydrogen-framework interacting sites. However, prior to this work, carbon–carbon triple bonds, especially polyyne chains, have not been systematically studied for gas adsorption purposes in MOFs. In this contribution, we report an NbO- type MOF that is constructed based on a polyyne-coupled di-isophthalate ligand formed in situ. The ensuing MOF has permanent porosity after the removal of guest molecules, and exhibits excellent H2, CH4 and CO2 adsorption capacity. The in situ ligand reactions under solvothermal conditions are well documented in the literature.7 Herein our goal is to apply this versatile method to simplify the MOF synthesis by combining the ligand preparation, puriﬁcation, and MOF synthesis into one simple step. It is hoped that the formation of the MOF will drive the ligand formation to completion; therefore, the puriﬁcation of the ligand becomes unnecessary. Copper(I)-catalyzed oxidative coupling of terminal acetylenes was found as early as 1869 and has been developed into a versatile synthetic tool for 1,3-diyne compounds.8 We reason that by combining isophthalate ligand bearing terminal acetylene with a slight excess of copper(II) salt, which can be readily reduced to copper(I) under solvothermal reaction conditions, a homocoupling product di-isophthalate can be generated. Subsequently, the di-isophthalate linker reacts with the Cu(II) salts giving rise to a NbO MOF. The ligand precursor used herein is 5-ethynylisophthalic acid (H2ei), which contains both isophthalic moieties and terminal acetylene suitable for the coupling reaction. As expected, every two of the H2ei were coupled into one 5,50-(buta-1,3-diyne-1,4- diyl)diisophthalic acid (H4bdi) under the catalysis of Cu(I), which came from the reduction of cupric acetate. In addition, the in situ formed 4-connected ligand bdi4 was linked via the 4-connected dicopper paddlewheel SBU to form a NbO-type MOF, PCN-46 (PCN stands for porous coordination network) (Fig. 1) in 77% of yield (based on H2ei).z It must be pointed out that the exact chronological sequence of events such as the coupling of the precursor molecules, the deprotonation of the di-isophthalic acid, and the formation of the MOF has not been deciphered. However, the high overall yield of the procedure implies that the coupling reaction beneﬁts from the consumption of the tetracarboxylic acid by MOF formation. Calculated using the PLATON routine, PCN-46 has a solvent accessible volume of 73.8%. This high porosity prompts us to examine its gas adsorption property. The phase purity of the bulk sample was conﬁrmed by powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD), and the framework retains its crystallinity after the removal of guest molecules (Fig. S2, ESIw). Its permanent porosity was conﬁrmed by both N2 (77 K) and Ar (77 and 87 K) sorption isotherms (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3, ESIw). The isotherms show type-I sorption behavior, which is typical for microporous materials. Based on the N2 sorption isotherm, PCN-46 has a BET surface area of 2500 m2 g1 Fig. 1 (a) In situ formed ligand bdi4 and the formation of NbO-type framework; (b) atomic packing of PCN-46, viewed through [0 0 1] direction; (c) atomic packing of PCN-46, viewed through [1 0 0] direction.

View Article Online / Journal Homepage / Table of Contents for this issue (Langmuir surface area: 2800 m2 g1) and a total pore volume of 1.012 cm3 g1. It has a uniform pore size around 6.8 A˚ based on the Horvath–Kawazoe model in the Micromeritics ASAP2020 software package (assuming cylinder pore geometry).9 The high porosity and stable framework make PCN-46 a good candidate for gas storage. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reset the gravimetric and volumetric storage targets for on-board hydrogen storage for 2010 (4.5 wt%, 28 g L1) and 2015 (5.5 wt%, 40 g L1).10 At 77 K and 760 Torr, PCN-46 can reversibly adsorb 1.95 wt% of H2 (Fig. 3). Under high pressure range, the saturated excess gravimetric H2 uptake is 5.31 wt% (56.1 mg g1) at 32 bar. Taking the gaseous H2 compressed within the void pore at 77 K into consideration, the total gravimetric H2 uptake can reach as high as 6.88 wt% (73.9 mg g1) at 97 bar. Calculated from the crystal density of the activated form (0.6185 g cm3), PCN-46 has an excess volumetric H2 uptake of 34.7 g L1 (32 bar) and a total volumetric uptake of 45.7 g L1 (97 bar). Theoretical studies reveal that given the same MOF struc- tural type, the longer the ligand, the higher the speciﬁc surface area, and accordingly the higher the gravimetric H2 uptake would be.11 This is further conﬁrmed by the comparison of PCN-46 and the NOTT series NbO-type MOFs.4b As can be seen from Table 1, when the length of ligand increases, the surface area, pore volume, and high pressure hydrogen uptake of the MOFs also increase, but not the heat of adsorption. Based on a variant of the Clausium–Clapeyron equa- tion, the H2 isosteric adsorption enthalpy of PCN-46 reaches 7.20 kJ mol1 at low coverage, and decreased to 4.06 kJ mol1 at medium coverage (Fig. S4).12 The increased heat of hydrogen adsorption in PCN-46, compared to those of other NbO type MOFs shown in Table 1, can be attributed to the interaction between dihydrogen molecules and the exposed and delocalized p electrons in the polyyne unit in bdi4, which is evidently stronger than that for the phenyl rings in tpta4 and qpta4. A strong interaction between acetylene and a NbO-type MOF containing alkyne unit was also discovered, in which the high acetylene aﬃnity towards the framework was particially attributed to the p–p interaction.4f In addition, the replacement of phenyl rings by polyyne chain leads to a boost of pore volume and hydrogen uptake. As Table 1 shows, the bdi4 ligand is much shorter than qpta4, but the pore volumes and hydrogen uptakes of PCN-46 and NOTT-102 are very close. Furthermore, in the absence of a catalyst, the hydrogen addition reaction on the polyyne unit has not been observed even at high pressure, as shown by the reversible hydrogen sorption isotherms of PCN-46, validating the stability of the MOF under hydrogen storage conditions. Methane is another candidate as an on-board fuel. However, it also suﬀers from a lack of reliable storage. The DOE methane storage target has a volumetric basis: 180 v(STP) v1 at 35 bar.13 With high surface area and high pore volume, MOFs have proved reliable due to their high methane uptake capacity.2e–g The high pressure methane adsorption in PCN-46 at 298 K was also examined. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the gravimetric excess CH4 uptake in PCN-46 reaches saturation at 12 mmol g1 (60 bar) (total: 17.2 mmol g1, 110 bar). At 35 bar, the volumetric excess CH4 uptake in PCN-46 is 150 v v1 (total: 172 v v1). The capture and sequestration of CO2 is considered to be an eﬀective way for the control of greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the capture processes in large scale operation nowadays are based on amine-based wet scrubbing systems, which have high energy and resource consumption.14 MOFs have proven to be good adsorbents for CO2 at ambient temperature.2i,j As can be seen in Fig. 5, the saturation excess CO2 uptake in PCN-46 is 21.0 mmol g1 (30 bar). In summary, a NbO-type MOF, PCN-46, was synthesized based on an in situ formed polyyne-coupled di-isophthalate ligand by the copper(I)-catalyzed oxidative coupling of terminal Fig. 2 The N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K (solid symbols, adsorption; open symbols, desorption) and pore size distribution of PCN-46.

X-ray Crystallography. Single crystal X-ray structure determination of PCN-46 was performed at 173(2) K on the Advanced Photon Source on beamline 15ID-B in Argonne National Laboratory. Raw data for the structure were processed using SAINT and absorption corrections were applied using SADABS2. Structures were solved by direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELXTL3. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters during the final cycles. Organic hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions with isotropic displacement parameters set to 1.2 × Ueq of the attached atom. The solvent molecules are highly disordered, and attempts to locate and refine the solvent peaks were unsuccessful. Contributions to scattering due to these solvent molecules were removed using the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON4; structures were then refined again using the data generated. Sample Activation. As-synthesized PCN-46 crystals were immersed in methanol for 3 days to remove the nonvolatile solvates (DMA and water), and the extract was decanted every day and fresh methanol was replaced. The sample was collected by decanting and treated with dichloromethane for 3 days similarly to remove methanol. After the removal of dichloromethane by decanting, the sample was activated by drying under a dynamic vacuum at room temperature overnight. Powder X-ray Diffraction. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of as-synthesized PCN-46 was obtained on a Bruker-AXS D8 Advanced Bragg-Brentano X-ray Powder Diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. Due to the instability of activated PCN-46 in the air, its PXRD pattern was obtained by sealing the sample in 0.6 mm standard Lindeman capillary under an argon atmosphere and collecting the data on a Bruker GADDS three-circle X-ray Diffractometer (Cu-Kα radiation).

The low-pressure gas sorption isotherm measurements were performed at 77 K (liquid nitrogen bath) or 87 K (liquid argon bath) on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area and pore size analyzer. Before measurements, the activated sample was degassed for 10 h at 100 °C. UHP grade (99.999%) N2, He, H2, and Ar were used for all measurements. Oil-free vacuum pumps and oil-free pressure regulators were used for all measurements to prevent contamination of the samples during the degassing process and isotherm measurement. High-Pressure Gas Sorption Measurements. High pressure excess adsorption of H2, CH4 and CO2 were measured using an automated controlled Sieverts’ apparatus (PCT-Pro 2000 from Setaram) at 77 K (liquid nitrogen bath) or 298 K (room temperature). About 600 mg of activated sample were loaded into sample holder under an argon atmosphere. Before measurements, the sample was degassed at 100 °C overnight. The free volume was determined by the expansion of low-pressure He (<5 bar) at room temperature. The temperature gradient between the gas reservoir and sample holder was corrected by applying a correction factor to the raw data, which was obtained by replacing the sample with a polished stainless-steel rod and measuring the adsorption isotherm at the same temperature over the requisite pressure regime. The total gas uptake was calculated by: Ntotal = Nexcess + ρbulkVpore, where ρbulk equals to the density of compressed gases at the measured temperature and pressure, and Vpore was obtained from the N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K.
