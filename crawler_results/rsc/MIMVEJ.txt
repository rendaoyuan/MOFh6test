E-mail: xtal@usf.edu Received (in Columbia, MO, USA) 10th December 2001, Accepted 15th February 2002 First published as an Advance Article on the web 5th March 2002 Self-assembly of Zn(NO3)2 with m-pyridinecarboxylate (nic- otinate) under mild conditions affords several products including a novel three-dimensional network [Zn(nicotina- te)2]n that has connectivity defined by the circuit symbol 42.84. Structural diversity in coordination polymers can occur through the existence of phenomena such as interpenetration1–3 or supramolecular isomerism4,5 and it is thereby possible to generate a wide range of structures from even simple ligands and known chromophores. In such a context, pyridinecarbox- ylates represent readily available ligands that have already been shown to be capable of generating coordination polymer networks that exhibit properties such as polarity,6–8 porosity9,10 or magnetism.11 Zn(II) chromophores generally exhibit tetrahedral coordina- tion12 and can in appropriate circumstances serve as pseudo square planar nodes. Therefore, coordination of an angular bifunctional ligand, e.g. nicotinate, to a tetrahedral Zn(II) ion can result in a 44 (square grid) network. Indeed, [Zn(nicoti- nate)2], 1a, exhibits such toplogy.6,8 However, there are other possible topologies that are based solely upon square planar nodes: the 3D networks NbO (64.82)12 and CdSO4 (65.8).13 PtS exhibits (42.84)14 topology but it is sustained by both square planar and tetrahedral nodes in a 1+1 ratio. It should also be noted that a hydrogen bonded network with 42.84 topology has been been reported.15 We report herein a new supramolecular isomer of [Zn(nicoti- nate)2] which represents what is to our knowledge the first example of a three-dimensional coordination polymer that possesses a 42.84 topology based solely upon square planar nodes, {[Zn(nicotinate)2]·MeOH·2H2O}n, 2, and two new forms of 1a—{[Zn(nicotinate)2]·naphthalene}n, 1b, and {[Zn(nicotinate)2]·2 nitrobenzene}n, 1c—both of which exhibit the same 44 topology as 1a.‡ The crystal structure of 2 is illustrated in Fig. 1(a).§ The chromophore is the same as that in 1a–c. However, when one examines the connectivity of the Zn centers, adjacent square planar nodes are twisted at an angle of ca. 25°, resulting in a 3D network [Fig. 1(b)] instead of a 2D square grid. The circuit symbol of this network is 42.84. PtS14 is defined by the same circuit symbol; however, the two nets are fundamentally different and the projections down [100] are non-super- imposable (Fig. 2). The nodes are eclipsed along the z-axis with a vertical distance between two Zn atoms of 6.92 Å and there are edge-to-face interactions between the pyridyl rings of nicotinate ligands with a shortest distance d(C–C) = 3.8 Å. 2 possesses cavities of effective dimensions 4.35 3 4.35 Å that form infinite channels parallel to the z-axis, (Fig. 1, left). These channels contain columns of disordered solvent mole- cules. The density of 2 is 1.56 g cm23 (1.30 g.cm23 without solvent). Thermogravimetric analysis of 2 revealed a weight loss of ca. 16% between 100 and 250 °C, which is consistent with the removal of solvent molecules (calculated loss of 18% for two molecules of H2O and one molecule of MeOH).† In order to systematically determine the effect of templates on the formation of 1a or 2, the same reaction was conducted in the presence of several aromatic guests: benzene, nitrobenzene, naphthalene, chlorobenzene, o- and p-xylenes, p-nitroaniline and anisole, as well as in the absence of template. Analysis of simulated and calculated XPD patterns indicated that most reactions resulted in the formation of 1a whereas nitrobenzene affords 2 or 1c and naphthalene affords 1b.† 1b and 1c contain 2D square grid networks (44) [Fig. 3(a)].§ 1b crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group C2/c, the parallel infinite layers of square grids are eclipsed and the d(Zn– Zn) separtations are 7.68 Å, resulting in the formation of parallel channels perpendicular to the planes of the square grids. Each cavity has effective dimensions of 4.45 3 4.45 Å, and is filled by one molecule of naphthalene that interacts with the aromatic rings of the surrounding nicotinate ligands by face-to- face p–p stacking with distances between the centroids in a range of 3.4–3.7 Å. The density of 1b is 1.56 g cm23 (1.10 g cm23 without guest). Structure 1c contains a larger amount of guest (density without guest = 0.86 g cm23) and exhibits much larger interlayer separations than either 1a or 1b [d(Zn–Zn) = 10.05 Å]. It should be noted in 1a that adjacent grids are staggered whereas in 1b and 1c they are almost eclipsed. † Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: experimental details, TGA and XRPD of all compounds.

Only a subtle difference of the conditions during crystallization influences which phase is generated. A summary of the relationships between the structural supramolecular isomers is shown in Fig. 4. The characterization of components, achieved by powder diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis,§ reveals that heating above 220 °C results in conversion of 1b, 1c and 2 into 1a. 1a was formed via hydrothermal conditions and it should therefore be unsurprising that it appears to be the thermodynamically favored product. In conclusion, a novel 42.84 network based upon square planar nodes has been generated and it can be rationalized on the basis of the connectivity and the geometry of the molecular building blocks. The ability of guests to intercalate in the square grid form of [Zn(nicotinate)2] is perhaps unsurprising16,17 but to our knowledge such a wide range of separations has not yet been seen in laminated coordination polymers. This study further confirms how supramolecular isomerism can afford super- structural diversity from even the most simple chemical building blocks.

Notes and references ‡ 1b, 1c and 2 were prepared as the result of attempts to synthesize the dimetal tetracarboxylate cluster, Zn2(m2-nicotinate-O,OA)4, a methanolic solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (149 mg, 0.5 mmol) was carefully layered onto a methanolic solution of nicotinic acid (123 mg, 1 mmol), pyridine (79 mg, 1 mmol) and toluene (3 ml, 28 mmol), 2, or naphthalene, (640 mg, 5 mmol), 1b, or nitrobenzene, (3 ml, 29 mmol), 1c, under ambient conditions. The solutions were left undisturbed for 48 h and colorless crystals of 2 (112 mg, 60.5%) formed at the interlayer boundary in addition to a white precipitate (60 mg, 33%) that was characterized by XPD to be the square grid 1a synthesized by Lin et al. in 1998.6 After 1 and 9 months, colorless crystals of 1b (15 mg, 7%) and 1c (119 mg, 43%) were collected from the mother liquor by physical separation. § Crystallographic data: intensity data for 1b, 1c and 2 were collected at 200 K on a Bruker SMART-APEX diffractometer using Mo-Ka radiation (l = 0.7107 Å). The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects and for absorption using the SADABS18 program. Structures were solved using direct methods and refined by full-matrix, least-squares on ¡F¡2. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically and hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions and refined with temperature factors 1.2 times those of their bonded atoms. The two molecules of solvent in the asymetric unit of 2 were disordered, the methanol molecule was two-fold disordered and refined over two equally occupied positions of the O atoms. All crystallographic calculations were conducted with the SHELXTL 5.1 program package.
