Compound 1 displays a 1D ladder structure. The neighboring ladders are further linked by p–p interactions to form a 2D supramolecular layer. Compound 2 shows a 3D (3,5)-connected framework with (63)(66?84) topology. Compound 3 exhibits a 2D layer structure. The layers are further connected by hydrogen-bonds to give rise to a 3D supramolecular architecture. Compound 4 shows a 3D (4,5)-connected (4?85)(44?62?84)2 net.

Compound 6 displays a 2D sheet with dangling arms. Each sheet is threaded by the dangling arms of two others, leading to an unusual 3D polythreading framework. Compound 7 shows a 3D (3,4,5)-connected framework with (62?8)2(65?8)(65?84?10)2 topology. The photoluminescent properties of compounds 1–7 have been investigated in detail. Introduction In recent years, the design and synthesis of coordination polymers have received intense interest from chemists not only because of their interesting structures but also because of their fascinating properties and possible applications.1 In this regard, coordination polymers constructed from tripodal ligands have attracted particular interest.2 So far, a number of coordination polymers belonging to these species have been obtained by reactions of suitable metal salts with rigid or flexible tripodal ligands, such as phosphorictriamide,3 quino- lines,4 pyridines,5 carboxylates,6 pyrazole7 and aminothio- phene.8 The results indicate that the rigid ligands have single conformations when they coordinate with metal salts, while the flexible ligands can adopt varied conformations according to the different geometric requirements of the metal ions. The tri(imidazole) or tri(1,2,4-triazole) ligands as an important family of N-donor ligands are good choices in the construction of coordination polymers with fascinating architectures and properties.9 Compared with tri(imidazole) ligands, tri(1,2,4- triazole) ligands can provide six potential coordination nodes. As far as we know, the coordination chemistry of the tri(1,2,4- triazole) ligands has not been well-explored so far.10 Recently, some coordination polymers based on the tri(1,2,4-triazole) ligands have been reported. These complexes display 1D, 2D and 3D motifs because of the varied coordination conforma- tions of the tri(1,2,4-triazole) ligands.10 However, coordination polymers constructed by both tri(1,2,4-triazole) ligands and polycarboxylates are relatively rare.10a–d It is well-known that the polycarboxylates play a key role in directing the overall complex architectures. Therefore, systematic research on this subject is still necessary in understanding the details of the flexible tripodal ligand with metal salts and the effect of anions on the structures of coordination polymers. On the basis of the above considerations, 1,3,5- tris(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (L) (Scheme 1) and four kinds of organic carboxylic acids were aKey Lab for Polyoxometalate Science, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, People’s Republic of China.

The effects of coordination modes of the L ligand on the overall structures have been discussed. In addition, the luminescent properties for 1–7 have also been investigated. Experimental Materials and measurements All reagents and solvents for syntheses were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. The ligand L was synthesized according to a previously reported method.10g The C, H and N elemental analysis was conducted on a Perkin- Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. The FT-IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the range 4000–400 cm21 on a Mattson Alpha–Centauri spectrometer. The photoluminescent properties were measured on a FLSP920 Edinburgh Fluorescence Spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected on a Rigaku Dmax 2000 X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.154 nm) and 2h ranging from 5 to 40u. The experimental powder XRD patterns are in good agreement with the corresponding simulated ones except for the relative intensity variation because of the preferred orientations of the crystals. Therefore, the phase purity of the as-synthesized products is substantiated (Fig. S1, ESI3). Synthesis of [Zn2(o-bdc)2(L)2]?H2O (1).

X-ray crystallography Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for compounds 3 and 6 were collected on an Oxford Diffraction Gemini R CCD with graphite-monochromated Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.54184 Å) at 293 K. Crystallographic diffraction data for compounds 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 were recorded on an Oxford Diffraction Gemini R CCD with graphite-monochromated Mo Ka radiation (l = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K. Absorption corrections were applied using multi-scan techniques. All the structures were solved by the Direct Method of SHELXS-97 and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques using the SHELXL-97 program within WINGX.11 Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic tempera- ture parameters. The disordered atoms in compounds 4 (C30, C31 and N6) and 5 (O7) were refined using C, N and O atoms split over two sites, with a total occupancy of 1. Other hydrogen atoms attached to carbons were generated geome- trically. Some aqua hydrogen atoms of compounds 2, 4 and 7 could not be positioned with difference Fourier maps. Other hydrogen atoms of water molecules were located from difference Fourier maps and refined with isotropic displace- ment parameters. The detailed crystallographic data and structure refinement parameters for 1–7 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond distances and angles and hydrogen bonds for compounds are given in the ESI3 (Tables S1 and S2). Results and discussion Syntheses The synthetic procedure of the complexes is schematically shown in Scheme 2. The coordination polymers 1–7 consist of both the L ligand and carboxylate anions. In order to investigate the topologies of the resulting frameworks of the L ligand with Zn(II)/Cd(II) salts and different polycarboxylates, we carried out numerous parallel experiments by adjusting the ratios of the reaction materials. Crystals of compounds 1–7 could only be obtained in the ratios as reported in the text. For compound 2, we have used similar synthetic methods to that of 1, but we only obtained its powder form. Finally, compound 2 was obtained after the solvent DMF was added to the reaction system, which enhances the solubility of the reaction mixture. In addition, we also performed a series of parallel experiments to change the reaction temperatures, and to vary the solvent types and ratios. However, other experiments gave powder forms or very small polycrystals. Structure of [Zn2(o-bdc)2(L)2]?H2O (1). As shown in Fig. 1a, the asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Zn(II) ion, one o-bdc anion, one L ligand and half a lattice water molecule. Each Zn(II) ion is five-coordinated by three carboxylate O atoms from two o-bdc anions and two N atoms from two L ligands in a trigonal bipyramid sphere. Two o-bdc anions bridge two Zn(II) ions to generate a [Zn(o-bdc)]2 dimer. Neighboring [Zn(o-bdc)]2 dimers are further linked by L ligands in bidentate bridging modes (cis, trans, trans-conformation in Scheme 3) to form a 1D ladder structure (Fig. 1b). The Zn…Zn separations across the o-bdc anion and L ligand are 5.53 and 12.02 Å, respectively. The dihedral angles between triazole groups and the central benzene ring plane were 75.54, 70.63 and 61.45u, respectively. Interestingly, adjacent ladders are further con- nected by face-to-face p–p interactions between triazol ligands (face-to-face distance 3.34 Å and centroid-to-centroid distance 3.53 Å), resulting in a 2D supramolecular layer (Fig. 1c). Structure of [Cd2(o-bdc)2(L)2]?6H2O (2). When a Zn(II) ion of 1 was replaced by a Cd(II) ion, a different structure of 2 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 2a, each Cd(II) ion is seven- coordinated by three carboxylate O atoms from two o-bdc anions, three N atoms from three L ligands and one water molecule. The Cd1–O1W bond distance of 2.608(11) Å is within Table 1 Crystal data and structure refinements for compounds 1–7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Formula C52H52Zn2O9N18 C52H62Cd2N18O14 C34H31Zn2N9O9 C34H33Cd2N9O10 C60H56Zn3N18O13 C46H46Zn2N18O9 C46H46Cd2N18O9 Fw 1203.86 1388.00 840.42 952.49 1433.34 1125.75 1219.81 Space group P1¯ C2/c P21/c P21/n P1¯ P1¯ P43212 a (Å) 10.7033(16) 20.4940(7) 18.577(7) 10.3392(14) 13.3713(14) 9.6371(11) 11.896(2) b (Å) 11.880(4) 13.4394(5) 11.671(3) 16.2364(12) 14.7967(17) 11.5022(14) 11.896(3) c (Å) 12.457(6) 23.0775(7) 18.655(5) 22.526(2) 16.661(2) 13.0554(18) 34.2854(17) a (u) 115.528(6) 90 90 90 103.393(8) 72.255(12) 90 b (u) 106.801(5) 93.709(3) 118.998(4) 102.756(4) 102.889(7) 84.177(10) 90 c (u) 91.358(4) 90 90 90 105.532(2) 67.195(11) 90 V (Å3) 1348.0(8) 6342.9(4) 3537.6(18) 3688.2(7) 2943.3(6) 1270.3(3) 4852.1(15) Z 1 4 4 4 2 1 4 Dcalcd [g cm23] 1.483 1.453 1.578 1.715 1.617 1.472 1.670 F(000) 622 2832 1720 1904 1472 580 2464 Observed reflection/unique 9426/4908 11996/5721 26790/6238 14931/6738 44601/10468 13855/4510 22755/5757 Rint 0.0763 0.0362 0.1835 0.0412 0.1266 0.0689 0.0369 GOF on F2 0.844 0.923 0.956 0.907 1.003 1.095 0.952 R1 a[I . 2s (I)] 0.0607 0.0513 0.0763 0.0372 0.0660 0.0694 0.0331 wR2 b 0.1064 0.1493 0.1721 0.0642 0.1516 0.1774 0.0758 a R1 = S||Fo| 2 |Fc||/S|Fo|. b wR2 = |Sw(|Fo|2 2 |Fc|2)|/ S|w(Fo 2)2|1/2.

Each L ligand shows a cis, trans, trans-conformation and coordinates with the Cd(II) atoms in a tridentate mode (Scheme 3). In this way, neighboring 1D Cd(II)-o-bdc chains are further linked by L ligands to give a 3D framework. The dihedral angles between triazole groups and the central benzene ring plane were 65.30, 75.63 and 78.80u, respectively. If the 2,4,6-trimethyl phenyl ring of the L ligand and the Cd(II) atom can be considered as 3- and 5-connected nodes, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI3), the structure of 2 can be simplified as a (3,5)-connected (63)(66?84) net with two kinds of nonequivalent points (Fig. 2c). In addition, O2W and O3W molecules form hydrogen bonds with the o-bdc anion (O2W–H2A…O2 = 2.857(8) Å, O3W–H3A…O4 = 2.807(10) Å, Table S2, ESI3), which further stabilizes the 3D supramolecular architecture of 2. Structure of [Zn2(m-bdc)2(L)(H2O)] (3). When the o-bdc anion in 1 was replaced by the m-bdc anion under similar synthesis conditions, a structurally-different compound 3 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 3a, the structure of 3 contains two Zn(II) ions, two m-bdc anions, one L ligand and one water molecule. Two Zn(II) atoms show the same tetrahedral spheres, but their coordination environments are entirely different. Zn1 atom is coordinated by two carboxylate O atoms from two m-bdc anions and two N atoms from two L ligands. However, Zn2 atom is coordinated by three O atoms from two m-bdc anions and one coordinated water molecule, and one N atom from one L ligand. Neighboring Zn(II) atoms are bridged by two crystallographically unique m-bdc anions to generate a deeply corrugated chain (Fig. 3b). Each L ligand shows a cis, trans, trans-conformation and coordinates with three Zn(II) atoms in a tridentate mode (Scheme 3). In this way, neighboring Zn(II)–m-bdc chains are further linked by L ligands to form a 2D layer (Fig. 3c). In addition, O1W molecule forms hydrogen-bonds with the m-bdc oxygen atoms of adjacent layers (O1W–H1B…O6#4 = 2.612(9) Å, O1W– H1A…O8#5 = 2.693(8) Å, #4 2x + 3, 2y, 2z + 2; #5 x, 2y + 1/2, z 2 1/2), leading to a 3D supramolecular architecture (Fig. S3, ESI3). Structure of [Cd2(m-bdc)2(L)]?2H2O (4). The asymmetric unit of 4 contains two Cd(II) ions, two m-bdc anions, one L ligand, one and two half-occupied lattice water molecules (Fig. 4a). Each Cd(II) atom is six-coordinated by four carboxylate O atoms from three m-bdc anions and two N atoms from two L ligands in a distorted octahedral sphere. Each m-bdc anion coordinates with three Cd(II) atoms in bidentate-chelating and bidentate-bridging modes, resulting in a 1D double chain (Fig. 4b). The L ligand shows a cis, trans, trans-conformation and coordinates with four Cd(II) atoms in a tetradentate mode (Scheme 3). In this way, L ligands bridge adjacent double chains to yield a 3D framework. Topologically, the 2,4,6- trimethyl phenyl rings of the L ligand can be considered as a 4-connected node (Fig. 4c), and Cd1 and Cd2 atoms can be considered as 5-connected nodes, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI3). Therefore, the 3D framework of 4 can be described as a 3D (4,5)-connected net with a Schla¨fli symbol of (4?85)(44?62?84)2 (Fig. 4d). It is noteworthy that a related compound, [Cd(m-bdc)(L)(H2O)]?H2O (8),10a displays a 2D layer structure. The L ligand in 8 adopts a cis, trans, trans-conformation and coordinates with two Cd(II) ions rather than a tetradentate mode in 4. Structure of [Zn3(p-bdc)3(L)2]?H2O (5). When the m-bdc anion in 3 is replaced by the p-bdc anion, a new compound 5 with self-penetrating character was obtained. The asymmetric unit of 5 contains three crystallographically unique Zn(II) atoms, four unique p-bdc anions, two unique L ligands, and one lattice water molecule. Two half-occupied p-bdc anions lie about inversion centers. As shown in Fig. 5a, each Zn(II) atom is four-coordinated by two carboxylate O atoms from two p-bdc anions and two N atoms from two L ligands in a tetrahedral sphere.

In this way, neighboring Zn(II) atoms are joined together by L ligands to yield an infinite 1D loop- containing chain (Fig. 5b), which are further extended by p-bdc anions to form a self-penetrating sheet as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5c and d. Moreover, there exist hydrogen- binding interactions among adjacent sheets. The lattice water molecules and the uncoordinated carboxylic groups of p-bdc anions act as hydrogen donors and accepters, respectively (O1W–H1B…O12 = 3.032(17) Å, O1W–H1A…O1#5 = 3.11(2) Å, #5 2x + 2, 2y, 2z + 2).

When the tetracar- boxylic acid was utilized in place of the dicarboxylic acids, two new compounds 6 and 7 were obtained. As shown in Fig. 6a, each Zn(II) atom is four-coordinated by two O atoms from two btec anions and two N atoms from two L ligands in a tetrahedral geometry. The btec anion lies about an inversion center. Each carboxylate group of the btec anion coordinates with one Zn(II) atom in a monodentate coordination mode. In this way, btec anions bridge adjacent Zn(II) atoms to generate a 1D chain. Neighboring chains are further linked by L ligands in cis, trans, trans-m2 conformations to furnish a 2D layer structure.

Coordination modes of L ligand in 1–7. From the structural description above, we can see that the flexible tripodal ligand L adopts four different coordination modes in compounds 1–7 as shown in Scheme 3. In 1 and 6, L ligands adopt the cis, trans, trans-m2 coordination modes and coordinate with only two Zn(II) atoms to form 1D chains (mode I in Scheme 3). In 2, 3 and 7, although L ligands show the same cis, trans, trans-m3- conformations (mode IV in Scheme 3), the dihedral angles between triazole groups and the central benzene ring plane are entirely different (Table 2). The different dihedral angles (geometries) of the L ligands led to different structures of their complexes (Fig. S6, ESI3). In 2 and 7, L ligands link Cd(II) atoms to give 3D frameworks. In 3, L ligands bridge Zn(II) or Cd(II) atoms to form 1D chains. In 4, L ligand shows the cis, trans, trans-m4-conformation and bridges four Cd(II) atoms to yield a 2D layer (mode II in Scheme 3). In 5, the L ligand adopts the cis, cis, cis-m3 coordination mode (mode II I in Scheme 3) and coordinates with three Zn(II) atoms to form a 1D loop-containing chain. The results show that the coordina- tion modes and the geometries of L ligands show a remarkable influence on the structures of the complexes.

The emissions of o-H2bdc, m-H2bdc, p-H2bdc, H4btec and L (Table 3) can be assigned to the p*A n or p* A p transitions as previously reported.12 Compound 5 shows an emission band at 409 nm. The emission is probably due to the intraligand charge transition of the p-bdc anion, since a similar emission peak is observed for the free polycarboxylic acid.13 The emission peaks of compounds 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 can be ascribed to the intraligand fluorescent emission of the L ligand because the similar peaks (374 nm and 451 nm) appear for the free L ligand (Table 3).14 Compared with the free L ligand, their emission peaks are blue-shifted by 6 to 24 nm. This may be attributable to the coordination effects of the L ligands to Zn(II) and Cd(II) ions, which increases the conformational rigidity of ligands and reduces the nonradia- tive decay of the intraligand.15 For compound 3, the emission peak of 410 nm is highly red-shifted with respect to the free m-H2bdc and L ligands, respectively. This emission can probably be assigned to a mixture of characteristics of intraligand and ligand-to-ligand charge transition as reported for other d10 metal complexes.16 The luminescent decay curve for 1 is well fitted into a single- exponential function with t = 15.77 ns. However, the decay curves for 2–7 can be fitted with a double-exponential function with t1 = 2.66 ns (41.80%) and t2 = 6.71 ns (58.20%) for 2, t1 = 2.18 ns (86.72%) and t2 = 12.34 ns (13.28%) for 3, t1 = 3.79 ns (38.64%) and t2 = 15.91 ns (61.36%) for 4, t1 =1.75 ns (80.57%) and t2 = 8.73 ns (19.43%) for 5, t1 = 3.06 ns (37.34%) and t2 = 13.19 ns (62.66%) for 6, and t1 = 3.61 ns (62.75%) and t2 = 9.07 ns (37.25%) for 7. Conclusion In summary, seven coordination polymers based on flexible tripodal tri(1,2,4-triazole) ligand L and different polycarbox- ylates have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. These compounds show fascinating 1D, 2D and 3D structures with various topologies. The structural diversities of the complexes indicate that the flexible multidentate triazole ligand (L) is a good candidate for the construction of coordination polymers with fascinating motifs. It is antici- pated that other new coordination polymers with intriguing structures as well as physical properties may also be synthesized through using similar tripodal ligands.
