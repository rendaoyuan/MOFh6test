Manuscript PAPER www.rsc.org/dalton | Dalton Transactions Tetracarboxylate-based Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) three-dimensional coordination polymers: syntheses, structures and magnetic properties† Shengqun Su,a,b Zhiyong Guo,a,b Guanghua Li,c Ruiping Deng,a Shuyan Song,a,b Chao Qin,a Chengling Pan,a Huadong Guo,a Feng Cao,a,b Song Wanga,b and Hongjie Zhang*a Received 25th January 2010, Accepted 6th July 2010 DOI: 10.1039/c001655a Methylenediisophthalic acid (H4MDIP), as semi-rigid ‘V’-shaped carboxylate ligands, react with CoO, NiO and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O to give three novel coordination polymers [H3O]2[Co3(MDIP)2]·2DMF (1), [Ni2(HMDIP)(m2-OH)(H2O)3(DMF)]·4H2O·DMF (2) and [Cu3(MDIP)(m2-OH)2(H2O)4]·6.5H2O (3) (DMF = N,N¢-dimethylformamide). All compounds have been characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, elemental and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Complex 1 is an unusual open anionic framework that is deﬁned as the metal–organic replica of ﬂuorite. Both 2 and 3 features a 3D open framework with one-dimensional elliptical channels and R- and L-helical chains, and their resulting frameworks can be rationalized as crb and pts topology respectively. An interesting feature of complex 3 is the presence of the linear Cu3 units that is formed by carboxylate and m2-hydroxyl groups linking three Cu(II) metal centers. Magnetic investigations indicate that ferromagnetic couplings are dominant in the three compounds. Introduction In recent years, research on coordination polymers (CPs) has been rapidly expanding, not only for their potential applications in gas storage, ion exchange, catalysis, magnetism and luminescence1–5 but also for their unique characteristics, such as structural regu- larity, ﬂexibility, and functionalized high surface area.6 Among the reported studies about the construction of complexes, carboxylate ligands have been extensively used due to their versatile coordina- tion conformations and strong coordination ability.7 Until now, much research has been devoted to the use of rigid carboxylate ligands, such as 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (p-H2BDC), 1,3- benzenedicarboxylic acid (m-H2BDC), 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acids (H3BTC) and so on.8–10 Meanwhile, many interesting metal– organic frameworks based on ﬂexible carboxylate ligands have also been reported widely.11 But, in contrast, the investigation into the semi-rigid ‘V’-shaped carboxylate ligands is still in its infancy.12 Methylenediisophthalic acid (H4MDIP) is a ‘V’-shaped tetracarboxylate ligand which can afford metal centers a variety of connection modes, thereby generating abundant structural motifs. At the same time, this ligand is relatively ﬂexible, since the phenyl rings can freely rotate around the methylene (–CH2–) groups according to the small change in the coordination environment with the result that various coordination conformations are aState Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Resource Utilizations, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, 130022, P.

As far as we know, coordination polymers constructed from the H4MDIP ligand have rarely been reported.1 On the other hand, the ﬁrst row transition metals (Co, Ni and Cu) complexes have attracted extensive interest in recent years because their different oxidation states allow two important parameters to be varied, i.e. spin quantum number and magnetic anisotropy.14 These potential variable parameters would bring about a great challenge in the ﬁeld of magnetic coordination polymers. So far the majority of magnetic frameworks are those containing the above paramagnetic metal centers. With the above idea in mind, herein we report three unprecedented compounds, namely [H3O]2[Co3(MDIP)2]·2DMF (1), [Ni2(HMDIP)(m2-OH)(H2O)3(DMF)]·8H2O (2) and [Cu3(MDIP)(m2-OH)2(H2O)4]·6.5H2O (3) based on the assembly of H4MDIP with cobalt(II), nickel(II) or copper(II) metal ions. The thermal and magnetic properties of these compounds are discussed. Experimental Materials and measurements Methylenediisophthalic acid (H4MDIP) was synthesized as re- ported in the literature,15 and the other reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. IR spectra were obtained from KBr pellets on a Perkin–Elmer 580B IR spectrometer in the 400–4000 cm-1 region (SI). Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed with a VarioEL analyzer. Thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin–Elmer TG-7 analyzer heated from 40 to 700 ◦C under nitrogen. Powder X-Ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker D8-ADVANCE diffractometer equipped with Cu-Ka at a scan speed of 2◦min-1. Temperature-dependent magnetic measurements were carried out on a Quantum Design SQUID MPMS-7 magnetometer with an applied ﬁeld of 1000 Oe.

X-ray crystallography The X-ray intensity data for the three compounds were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Mo-Ka radiation (l = 0.71073 ˚A). The crystal structure was solved by means of Direct Methods and reﬁned employing full-matrix least squares on F 2 (SHELXTL-97).17 All the hydrogen atoms except for those of guest water molecules were generated geometrically and reﬁned isotropically using the riding model. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters except for some disordered guest molecules. It should be noted that the guest molecules in the channels of 1 and 2 are highly disordered and could not be modeled properly so the diffused electron densities resulting from them were removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON.18 Crystal data and details of the structure determination for complexes 1–3 are listed in Table 1.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that compound 1 consists of carboxylate- bridged tri-nuclear cobalt clusters. The Co1 atom, located on the end of the Co3 unit, adopts a distorted octahedral geometry coordinated by six oxygen atoms from four different MDIP4- ligands (Co–O 2.0276(11)–2.2432(12) ˚A). The Co2 atom, situated at an inversion center in the space group, also exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry coordinated by six oxygen atoms from four different [MDIP]4- ligands (Co–O 2.0515(11)–2.1650(11) ˚A). The Co2 atom is linked to two neighboring Co1 by four –O–C–O– bridges and a pair of m2-Ocarboxyl atoms (O1 and O1A) to afford a Co3 core with a Co ◊◊◊Co distance of 3.569 ˚A. (Fig. 1a). Each tri- nuclear unit is further connected to neighboring others through eight [MDIP]4- ions to generate an anionic 3D open framework (Fig. 1b). The bond-valence calculations suggest all Co atoms are in the +2 oxidation state.19 This result is also supported by an XPS measurement of the compound in the energy region of Co2p1/2 and Co2p3/2. The XPS spectrum (shown in Fig. S1†) gives one peak at 780.9 eV, attributable to Co2+.20 A negatively charged framework, Co3(C8H4O4)4 2- and hydroxonium ion H3O+ occupy the voids based on the consideration of the charge balance. The effective free volume calculated with PLATON for the inclusion is 1724.2 ˚A3 per unit cell (after free molecules have been hypothetically removed) corresponding to 39.68% of the cell volume. A better insight into the nature of the intricate framework can be achieved by the application of a topological approach, which is necessary to simplify the building blocks from which the 3D net of 1 is built. As illustrated in Fig. 2, each [MDIP]4- ligand can be considered as a four-connecting node since it links four Co3 linear units and each Co3 unit in turn links eight [MDIP]4- ligands, which can be regarded as an eight-connecting node. The resulting (4,8)-connected net resembles the ﬂuorite structure with the Schl¨aﬂi symbol of (410·614·84)(45·6)2.21 It is well-known that ﬂuorite is one of the most important and frequently encountered structure types in minerals. Although it has been successfully replicated in several neutral metal–organic nets, what we describe 9124 | Dalton Trans., 2010, 39, 9123–9130 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Published on 27 August 2010.

Structure of [Ni2(HMDIP)(l2-OH)(H2O)3(DMF)]·8H2O (2). When CoO was replaced by NiO, a fascinating 3D structure of 2 was obtained. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, compound 2 contains two distinctive nickel atoms, one m2 hydroxyl group, one coordinated DMF molecule, three coordinated aqua molecules, and one monoprotonated [HMDIP]3- ligand (Fig. 3a). The Ni1 atom with a slightly distorted octahedral geometry is coordinated by six oxygen atoms from three [HMDIP]3- anions (O2, O5C, and O8A), one coordinated aqua molecule (O11), one m2-hydroxyl group (O9), and one DMF molecule (O10). Ni2 also adopts a distorted octahedral coordination geometry, surrounded by six oxygen atoms from three different [HMDIP]3- (O1, O4B, and Fig. 2 (a) Ball-and-stick and schematic representations of 4-connected and 8-connected nodes, respectively.

O7A), two coordinated aqua molecules (O12 and O13) and one m2- hydroxyl group (O9). The Ni1 and Ni2 centers are bridged through two carboxylate groups and one m2-hydroxyl group to form a binuclear unit with a Ni ◊◊◊Ni distance of 3.507 ˚A. Interestingly, the Ni2 units are linked into R- and L- helical chains along the b-axis through the isophthalate and [HMDIP]3- respectively (Fig. 3b). There are four carboxylate groups associated with each Ni2 unit, and each [HMDIP]3- ligand links four Ni2 units using its four carboxylate groups to allow the formation of a 3D open framework with elliptical channels viewed along the a-axis directions. Because the Ni2 units and [HMDIP]3- serve as four- connected nodes, the resultant framework can be rationalized as having crb topology with the Schl¨aﬂi symbol of (4·65) (Fig. 3c).22 PLATON analysis showed that the effective free volume of 2 is 30.98% of the crystal volume. Structure of [Cu3(MDIP)(l2-OH)2(H2O)4]·6.5H2O (3). Com- pound 3 was obtained under different reaction conditions to that of 1 and 2. As shown in Fig. 4a, the basic unit contains three Cu(II) metal centres arranged in linear that are bridged by one carboxylate group and one m2-hydroxyl group. In the unit, the Cu1 is ﬁve-coordinated with a distorted square-pyramidal geometry (t ª 0.14),23 where one m2-hydroxyl oxygen atom (O5), two carboxyl oxygen atoms (O2 and O4c) and one coordinated water molecule (O6) lie in the basic plane, while the other aqua ligand (O7) occupies the apical position.

Each tri-nuclear unit is connected to twelve others through four [MDIP]4- ions to generate a 3D framework with one-dimensional elliptical channels along the c-axis (Fig. 4b and Fig. 4c). Without guest molecules, the effective free volume is calculated by PLATON analysis to be 26.14% of the crystal volume. R- and L-helical chains along the x-axis are formed by the isophathalic carboxylates between tri-nuclear copper units (Fig. S2†). If the tri-nuclear units and [MDIP]4- are considered as four- connected nodes, the resulting network is of the pts topology with the Schl¨aﬂi symbol of (42·84) (Fig. S3†).24 For 3, one of the most prominent structural characteristics is the one dimensional channels constituted by Cu3 units and [MDIP]4- ions (Fig. 4d). Along the c-axis, the Cu3 units with the same orientation are merely arranged linearly rather than connect with each other, whereas those with different orientations are joined together by [MDIP]4- ions to form an open framework. To the best of our knowledge, such 3D open frameworks constructed by linear Cu3 units and carboxylate ligands with the above structure have never been observed prior to this work.25 In a comparison of the structures of 1–3, it is found that the coordination geometry of the central metal ions has signiﬁcant effects on the structures of the resulting complexes. In addition, different coordination modes of the carboxylate ligand also have a signiﬁcant effect on the structures, as evidenced by the fact that the structure of 1 is signiﬁcantly different from that of 2 and 3. In complex 1, H4MDIP carboxylate groups adopt three kinds of coordination modes, that is, the bis-mono, bis-chelating, and chelating-mono coordination modes. The mono and bis-mono coordination modes exist in complexes 2 and 3 (Fig. 5). In 1– 3, the dihedral angles between two aryl rings of H4MDIP are 89.03, 86.95 and 115.01◦respectively, which are also related to their coordination mode. In complex 3, the [MDIP]4- with a higher symmetrical conﬁguration leads to a higher symmetrical 3D framework. Magnetic properties The magnetic susceptibilities of complexes 1–3 were measured at 0.1 T ﬁeld in the temperature rang 2–300 K. Phase purity of the powder sample of three complexes was conﬁrmed by comparison of its powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern with that calculated from the single-crystal study (Fig. S4–S6†). The magnetic susceptibility of 1 versus temperature is shown in Fig. 6, the cMT value is 9.17 cm3 mol-1 K at 300 K, which is signiﬁcantly larger than the spin-only value of 5.63 cm3 mol-1 K calculated for three high-spin Co(II) ions (S = 3/2, g = 2) due to the unquenched orbital-moment as a consequence of spin–orbit coupling from single octahedral Co(II) ions. Upon lowering the temperature, cMT decreases slowly to a minimum value of 6.42 cm3 mol-1 K at 9 K resulting from the depopulation of the higher energy Kramers doublets associated with the high-spin Co(II) single ions.26 When the temperature continues to decrease from 9 K, the cMT value abruptly increases abruptly to 7.11 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K, indicating the presence of intramolecular ferromagnetic interactions between the Co(II) ions mediated by the carboxylate bridges. The magnetic susceptibility above 30 K obeys the Curie–Weiss law with the Weiss constant, q = -12.53 K, and Curie constant, C = 9.59 cm3 mol-1 K per Co3 unit. To quantitatively evaluate the magnetic interactions in 1, the data above 50 K were ﬁtted to the expression of susceptibility for linear tri-nuclear systems based on the Hamiltonian H = -2J(S1S2+S2S3). We have assumed that the exchange constant between the terminal Co(II) ions was zero. And the inter- trimer interaction (zJ¢) was dealt with by the molecular-ﬁeld 9126 | Dalton Trans., 2010, 39, 9123–9130 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Published on 27 August 2010.

This result indicates that ferromagnetic coupling interactions exist both between the adjacent Co(II) sites and between the adjacent trimers, although the latter is much weaker. As shown in Fig. 7, for complex 2, at room temperature the value of cMT is 2.55 cm3 mol-1 K, which is larger than the expected value of 2.00 cm3 mol-1 K for two magnetically uncoupled NiII (S = 1) centers. The cMT values gradually increase with decreasing temperature attesting to the presence of a ferromagnetic exchange interaction. The cMT versus T plot presents a maximum (2.71 cm3 mol-1 K) at 9 K and then decreases until a value of 2.21 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K. The decrease of the cMT values at low temperature can be due to a zero-ﬁeld splitting of the S = 2 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Dalton Trans., 2010, 39, 9123–9130 | 9127 Published on 27 August 2010.

The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility of 3 is shown in Fig. 8, the cMT value at 300 K is 1.65 cm3 mol-1 K, which lies in the usual range expected for trimeric Cu(II) ions with g > 2.29 Upon cooling of the sample, cMT increases and reaches Fig. 8 Temperature dependence of the cMT and cM -1 curve for 3. The red line represents the best ﬁt to the equation in the text. The blue line shows the Curie–Weiss ﬁtting. a value of 2.04 cm3 mol-1 K at 20 K. This behavior is indicative of strong ferromagnetic coupling between the adjacent Cu(II) in the tri-nuclear units. Below 20 K, cMT decreases rapidly down to 1.26 cm3 mol-1 K, which is most likely due to zero-ﬁeld splitting within the quartet ground state. The occurrence of inter-trimer antiferromagnetic interactions may also be operative at very low temperatures. A ﬁtting of the data above 30 K using the Curie– Weiss law gives the Weiss constant, q = 33.36 K, and Curie constant, C = 6.64 cm3 mol-1 K per Cu3 unit. The magnetic analysis was carried out using the susceptibility equation based on the spin Hamiltonian, H = -2J(S1S2+S2S3) - 2jS1S3, assuming that the exchange integrals between the neighbouring copper ions are identical (J12 = J23 = J) and j describes the integral between the terminal copper ions within the tri-nuclear unit. The magnetic susceptibility for the linear tri-nuclear copper(II) system may be expressed by eqn (3).30 To take into account the inter-trimer super-exchange coupling, the magnetic susceptibility can be corrected by the molecular ﬁeld approximation eqn (4). c b trimer Ng kT J kT J kT j kT = × − + + − − 2 2 4 2 10 2 2 exp( / ) exp( / ) exp( / ) exp( J kT J kT j kT / ) exp( / ) exp( / ) + + − 2 2 (3) c c c b m = − ′ trimer trimer zJ Ng 1 2 2 2 / (4) A good ﬁt with the experimental data was obtained for J = 20.94 cm-1, j = -7.22 cm-1, zJ¢ = -0.41 cm-1, g = 2.38 and R2 = 0.96181. The results show that the predominant ferromagnetic coupling is due to the interaction between neighbouring copper ions. A smaller antiferromagnetic contribution results from inter- action between the terminal copper ions. The negative zJ¢ value suggests weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the trimers. Thermal analysis To characterize the thermal stabilities of compounds 1–3, their thermal behaviors were investigated by TGA under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 ◦C min-1 (Fig. S7†).

The destruction of the frameworks occurs from 420 to 480 ◦C, leading to the formation of CoO as the residue (obsd 22.22%, calcd 21.58%). For 2, the weight loss in the range of 40–105 ◦C is attributed to the release of eight guest water molecules (obsd 21.03%, calcd 19.28%). The destruction of the frameworks occurs at ca. 385 ◦C with a residue of NiO (obsd 20.12%, calcd 20.00%). Compound 3 lost its guest water molecules from 40 to 150 ◦C (obsd 15.34%, calcd 15.52%). The compound was stable up to 260 ◦C, and the removal of organic components occurs from 260 to 430 ◦C. The remaining weight corresponds to the formation of CuO (obsd 33.78%, calcd 31.67%). Conclusions We have successfully synthesized three new Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) coordination polymers using the semi-rigid ‘V’-shaped H4MDIP ligand. The results reveal that the distinct structures of the ﬁnal products are caused by different coordination envi- ronments around central metal ions and the coordination modes of the carboxylate ligand (H4MDIP). Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal dominant ferromagnetic interactions for the three complexes. The three compounds not only show an aesthetic diversity of coordinative chemistry, but also, for example, can be used for the design of magnetic materials. Our future work will focus on the synthesis of new functional coordination polymers by using other paramagnetic metals and the H4MDIP ligand.
