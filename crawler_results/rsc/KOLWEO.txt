Manuscript Triply interpenetrated (3,4)- and (3,5)-connected binodal metal–organic networks prepared from 1,3,5-benzenetrisbenzoate and 4,40-bipyridyl† Romain Heck,a John Bacsa,a John E. Warren,b Matthew J. Rosseinskya and Darren Bradshaw*a Received 4th September 2008, Accepted 17th September 2008 First published as an Advance Article on the web 2nd October 2008 DOI: 10.1039/b815423f The ﬁrst examples of anionic-neutral mixed ligand frameworks prepared from 1,3, 5-benzenetrisbenzoate (BTB) and 4,40-bipyridyl (bipy) are reported. Framework 1, of composition [Ni(HBTB)(bipy)]$(guests), is a triply interpenetrated (3,5)-connected gra binodal network that has a 1-D channel structure exhibiting permanent porosity. Framework 2, which was prepared under identical conditions but in the presence of toluene, has the formula [Ni3(BTB)2(EG)3(bipy)3]$(toluene) (where EG ¼ ethylene glycol). 2 is a dense phase of triply interpenetrated rare (3,4)-connected tfz binodal networks that contains intercalated toluene in isolated voids. The primary inﬂuence for the formation of 2 are numerous hydrophobic interactions between the internal framework surface and the included toluene guest molecule. Introduction The ﬁeld of porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has grown rapidly in recent years, in part due to their ease of prep- aration, tunability and wide range of potential applications in areas such as gas storage, separation and catalysis, and most recently drug delivery.1 We have a long-standing programme of research in this area for the preparation of MOFs using multiple ligands of dissimilar charge.2 The use of mixed ligands to prepare MOF materials is well studied since combining organic ligands of different connectivity, charge and donor functionality introduces additional levels of structural complexity into the resulting frameworks, promising access to materials with enhanced properties and applications.3 A powerful strategy to identify and prepare new complex structural topologies is the combination of small structure-directing agents (SDAs) or template molecules with mixed ligand systems.4,5 Template molecules, often small organic species or alkyl ammonium salts,6 have been successfully employed in MOF synthesis to inﬂuence network topology and pore shape,7 prepare novel materials that display selective guest sorption4,8 and to increase the diversity of structural types for a given phase composition.5a Continuing our research into mixed carboxylate/pyridyl framework systems, we have investigated the preparation and structure of materials containing the torsionally ﬂexible 1,3, 5-benzenetrisbenzoate (BTB) as an extended trimesic acid analogue. BTB is a commonly employed trigonal node that has been used to prepare frameworks with exceptional internal surface areas,9 but to date only mixed-carboxylate frameworks have been synthesised.3d Here we report the structures and properties of the ﬁrst mixed ligand frameworks of BTB that contain both anionic and neutral ligand (aromatic-N) compo- nents, prepared in the absence and presence of small organic molecules. Small changes in the solvent composition yield two very different phases, even though the starting ratio of frame- work-forming components remains constant. The driving force for these pronounced differences is the favourable CH/p and p–p interactions between the BTB ligands and a small aromatic molecule. No analogous frameworks are prepared in the pres- ence of similarly sized non-aromatic molecules revealing a true templating effect. Results and discussion Solvothermal reaction of Ni(II) nitrate with the acid H3BTB and 4,40-bipyridyl (bipy) yields X-ray quality single-crystals of [Ni(HBTB)(bipy)]$guests, 1. 1 possesses an extended 3-D struc- ture, composed of 2-D Ni(HBTB) layers that are pillared by the bipy ligands. (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 in the ESI†) There are two symmetry inequivalent Ni(II) centres in the asymmetric unit of 1, each possessing a psuedo-octahedral coordination geometry. The inequivalence of the metal centres arises due to the positional disorder (0.51 : 0.49) of one BTB carboxylate group which binds exclusively to Ni(2). (Fig. S2†) Three BTB carboxylate groups bind to each metal (2  monodentate, 1  bidentate chelating) in a planar fashion that allows propagation of the layer structure. (Fig. 1a, b, S1) The BTB ligands are only partially deprotonated as observed for the BTC analogue [Ni(HBTC)(bipy)] (where BTC ¼ 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), previously prepared by Sun and co-workers.10 The coordination geometry imposed by chelation and partial deprotonation of the BTB ligands about Ni(II), allows the formation of an extended Ni(HBTB) (6,3)-type layer. (Fig. S1, ESI†) Adjacent layers are stacked in an ABA arrangement related by the P21/n space group inversion symmetry.

(Fig. 1 and Fig. S3†) Interestingly, the ethylene glycol (EG) used in the solvent mixture for the forma- tion of 1 does not interact with Ni(II) despite the propensity of 1,2-diols to coordinate to metal centres in a monodentate or bidentate binding mode.11 The overall topology of 1 is a (3,5) connected binodal network if the BTB ligands are taken as 3-connected nodes (each BTB is bound to 3 Ni centres) and each metal is considered as a 5-connected node (each Ni is bound to 3 BTB ligands and 2 bipys). (Fig. 1c) This network is of topological type gra using the 3-letter notation of O’Keefe12 and is assigned the Schla¨ﬂi symbol (63)(69$8) as determined using the program TOPOS4.0.13 This network has previously been observed in only ﬁve non- interpenetrated metal–organic compounds.14 (Fig. S4†) The majority of these materials exhibit a 5-connected metal ion (Cu(II) or Co(II)) and a 3-connected SO4 2 anion,14a–c and only one example is connected by a trigonal wholly organic linker as observed for 1.14d It is noted that the similarly (3,5)-connected [Ni(HBTC)(bipy)]10 analogue has hms topology15 rather than the gra topology observed for 1. The difference in overall network topology between these phases is related to the arrangement of the layers within each network. In 1 the layers are ABA stacked whereas the layers in [Ni(HBTC)(bipy)] are aligned in an AAA arrangement. This off-set between the layers is the origin for the selection of gra (ABA-layers) rather than hms (AAA-layers) topology in (3,5)-connected binodal networks. (See Fig. S4† for further examples of this) The (3,5)-connected net of 1 has a very open structure resulting in triple interpenetration of the networks, and exhibits the highest degree of interpenetration of (3,5) binodal networks reported for materials of this type. (Fig. 1c) The three inter- penetrating networks are related by a single translational vector [1,0,0] (14.47 A˚ ) (determined from TOPOS analysis)13,16 and deﬁne a 1-D channel structure. (Fig. 2) This network of channels which run parallel to the crystallographic c-axis, constitute a 25.6% solvent-accessible volume as determined from PLATON.17 The windows that provide access to these channels have a cross-section of 4.65  3.68 A˚ at their narrowest point, limited by the hydrogen atoms of the torsionally ﬂexible BTB aromatic rings. (Fig. S5†) The porous network is occupied by crystallographically disordered diethylformamide (DEF) and water solvent molecules which have been analysed with the SQUEEZE routine within PLATON.17 The determined residual electron density is consistent with a crystallographic formula of [Ni(HBTB)(bipy)]$0.5(DEF)$1.3(H2O) for 1, which is in excel- lent agreement with the bulk analysis (see experimental details). The stability of bulk 1 was determined by TG analysis and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). The TG data (Fig. S6†) show two distinct plateaus corresponding to release of guest H2O molecules between 25 and 90 C followed by loss of the guest DEF molecules between 90 and 330 C. The total loss is 15.8% (calculated 13.8%; the additional mass arises from surface solvent). Above 330 C, there is an abrupt mass loss of 40% corresponding to sample decomposition. XRPD data of the as-made and the evacuated material (Fig. S7†) both index as a single phase with the single-crystal derived unit cell parameters indicating that the bulk material is phase pure and the frame- work remains unchanged after guest (solvent) loss. The excellent thermal stability of 1 arises as the metal centres are coordinatively saturated by framework-forming components, and from the presence of highly favourable inter-network p–p stacking interactions (Fig. S8†). Similar pillared layer compounds that have metal-bound solvent molecules collapse to amorphous phases upon solvent loss.2a The permanent microporosity of 1 was Fig. 2 Connolly surface representation (constructed using Accelrys Materials Studio 4.0) of the 1-D pore structure of triply-interpenetrated 1 viewed along the [001] (left) and perpendicular to this (right).

Although mixed-ligand framework 1 is undoubtedly porous it is extremely desirable for many applications to increase the size of the accessible windows and the internal surface area that are currently limited by the triple interpenetration of this phase. In an attempt to preclude interpenetration and access new complex structural topologies we have investigated the synthesis of 1 in the presence of small volatile cyclic molecules (toluene, cyclo- hexanone and dioxane) that have the potential to interact with themselves and/or the internal surface of the framework. For example, by promoting hydrophobic interactions between the network surface and the guest5a, 8 rather than between networks, the space previously occupied by additional networks could potentially be opened up to generate less dense materials with enhanced porosity. Such molecules can also act as structure- directing agents (SDAs) or templates by forming organised assemblies, such as columns or cages of solvent, around which the metal–organic network is templated.4,9b In the present case, the small molecule ‘templates’ employed are themselves volatile, so the resulting ‘soft’ template structures should be easily removed under relatively mild conditions to activate the porous network. Addition of toluene to the reaction of Ni(II) nitrate, H3BTB and bipy to give a ﬁnal molar solvent mixture of 1.3 : 1.7 : 1.0 (DEF/EG/Toluene) yields framework 2, of composition [Ni3(BTB)2(EG)3(bipy)3]$3(toluene). The original solvent and reactant ratios for 1 were retained in the synthesis of 2 as these play an important role in overall network formation. Phase 2 is also based on a pillared layer motif, but with a different arrangement of coordinating species about the metal centres. (Fig. 4 and Fig. S9†) In contrast to 1 only two BTB carboxylates are bound to the metal centres in 2 as a consequence of an ethylene glycol from the reaction solvent now binding to Ni(II) in a bidentate chelating fashion. (Fig. 4a) The BTB carboxylates in 2 are fully deproto- nated and are bound trans to one another across the metal centres to form an extended layer of stoichiometry Ni3(BTB)2. (Fig. S9†) Adjacent layers are ABA stacked related by inversion symmetry as shown in Fig. 4b. The diol hydroxyl groups of the bound EG are strongly hydrogen bonded to the BTB carbonyl oxygens (D–A ¼ 2.651(4) A˚ ; D—H/A ¼ 159.47(16)) locking the BTB carboxylates in an approximately orthogonal relation- ship. (Fig. 4a) Such an arrangement would usually lead to the formation of a chiral (10,3)-a network,1b, 11 however, the torsional ﬂexibility of the BTB ligands overcomes this and a layer arrangement is clearly favoured in the present case. (Fig. S9 and S10†) 2 is best described as a binodal (3,4) net of stoichiometry (3)2(4)3 where the BTB ligands are 3-connected and the metal centres are now 4-connected, in contrast to 1 (5-connected Ni). (Fig. 4c) Full topological analysis13,16 reveals this to be a rare example of the tfz type network with Schla¨ﬂi symbol (63)2(64$8$10)3. 2 is also triply interpenetrated with the subnets related by the vectors [1/3,1/3,1/3], [1/3,2/3,1/3] and [2/3, 1/3,1/3] imposed by the trigonal symmetry of the R-3c space group. (Fig. 4c) Only one example of a triply interpenetrated tfz net has this far been reported for metal–organic compounds.18 The overall connectivity of [Cu3(BTC)2(L)3] (where L ¼ N,N0- bis(4-pyridylformamide)-1,4-benzene) is similar to 2 since there are links between both the 3- and 4-connected nodes as well as between sets of 4-connected nodes that are common to both materials. However, the links between 4-connected nodes in 2 are arranged in a cis rather than a trans orientation due to the coordination geometry enforced by the chelating EG species. This coordination arrangement has previously been observed in chiral (10,3)-a networks prepared from BTC and pyridine (and Fig. 3 Gravimetric CO2 sorption of 1 at 195 K.

(Fig. S11†) The angle between the N-donors provided by the bipy ligands, N–Ni–N, in 2 is 98. The 4-connected Cu(II) nodes in [Cu3(BTC)2(L)3]18 are effectively square planar in geometry whereas the 4-connected Ni(II) nodes in 2 are best considered as distorted triangular-based pyramids with one long vertex approximately 1.4 times the length of the other 5. (Fig. S12†) The triple interpenetration of the (3,4) nets in 2 results in a dense phase with no connective porosity—rather than a porous network as observed for 1—that contains intercalated toluene in isolated voids. (Fig. 5) The toluene solvent molecules in 2 are centred on general positions and occupy voids deﬁned by all three interpenetrating networks, forming myriad interactions with the framework internal surface. Edge-face aromatic inter- actions in the range 3.7–4.6 A˚ occur with BTB and bipy rings of the two networks between which the toluene is directly interca- lated. There is also a favourable CH/p interaction19 between the toluene methyl-group which points directly toward the face of a bipy ring of network one. Further strong CH/p interactions (2.8–3.6 A˚ ) between the toluene and the –CH2–CH2– backbone of metal-bound EG from the third network help to position the guest. (Fig. 5) The toluene acts as a template in the formation of 2 since no analogous frameworks are isolated in the presence of similar amounts of the non-aromatic cyclic molecules cyclohex- anone or dioxane.20 The driving force for the formation of 2 is the cumulative effect of the relatively weak but numerous CH/p and p–p interactions between the guest and the internal framework surface. Such a high-level of interaction clearly does not lead to an open framework structure with enhanced porosity in this case, suggesting that template molecules need to be carefully selected and overall solvent composition ﬁnely tuned for the preparation of porous materials. The template should itself promote network formation but not interact too strongly with the internal surface or the metal ions since dense materials are highly likely to result. TG analysis of 2 does not show any clear plateau in the mass proﬁle corresponding to solvent loss, but instead a series of gentle inﬂection points. (Fig. S13†) The ﬁrst inﬂection at around 250 C corresponds to a signiﬁcant mass loss of 25%. The calculated mass loss for the intercalated toluene is 5.2% and for metal- bound EG is 10.3%. At 100 C only 1.2% mass (approx 25% of the total toluene content) is lost, so it is clearly not possible to separate these into distinct mass loss events. Complete removal of the toluene guests can only occur with concomitant loss of the EG ligands, disrupting the hydrogen-bonding arrangement with the BTB carboxylates resulting in framework degradation. This provides further evidence for the intercalation of the toluene template as an integral part of the structure of 2 and the absence of any connective porosity in this phase. Conclusions In summary, we have reported the ﬁrst mixed-ligand framework systems containing anionic and neutral linkers prepared from BTB. The addition of a small aromatic template molecule to the BTB-bipy mixed ligand system inﬂuences the structure of the overall network, mode of interpenetration and extent of BTB deprotonation in order to optimise the number of stabilising interactions between the guest and the framework. While this is not wholly unexpected, it further illustrates that different complex network structures are accessible from the same starting ratios of metal : ligand(s) in the presence of controlled amounts of carefully selected small molecules through the promotion of framework-guest interactions, and suggests that the combination of mixed-ligand systems with template molecules could provide access to a wealth of new materials.

X-Ray crystallography All crystallographic measurements were carried out at 100 K. A micron-sized blue prismatic crystal of 1 was collected on Station 16.2SMX at the SRS Daresbury Laboratories, U.K., on a Bruker D8 diffractometer equipped with an APEX detector at a wavelength of 0.6700 A˚ . Data collection, cell reﬁnement and data reduction were carried out using the software APEXII (Bruker 2004). A green needle-like crystal of 2 was collected at the University of Liverpool on a Bruker D8 diffractometer equipped with an APEX detector using Mo Ka radiation. Cell reﬁnement and data reduction were carried out using SAINT v6.45a (Bruker 2005). For both compounds, structure solution and reﬁnement were carried out with SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97,21 respectively. Data were corrected for absorption effects using multi-scan methods with the software SADABS v2008–1 (1) and SADABS 2007/4 (2). The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned on F2 by full-matrix least-squares with anisotropic displacement parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms were placed in idealised positions using the riding model with thermal displacement parameters ﬁxed at either 1.2 or 1.5 times the equivalent isotropic thermal displacement parameters of the carrier atoms. Details of any disordered components are given in the submitted CIFs. For the porous framework 1, the residual electron density in the extra- framework space was treated with the SQUEEZE routine within PLATON17 (prior to treatment R1 ¼ 0.1339 for [Fo > 4s(Fo)], wR2 ¼ 0.3691 (all data); 324 electrons per cell calculated). Detailed crystallographic data and reﬁnement parameters for 1 and 2 are contained in Table 1. Data are freely available from the CCDC with reference numbers CCDC-692026 (1) and CCDC-692027 (2). Isotherm measurement The CO2 isotherms of 1 were measured using an Intelligent Gravimetric Analyser (IGA) from Hiden-Isochema (Warrington, U.K.). A sample of 1 was outgassed at 150 C under dynamic vacuum (107 mbar) until constant mass loss was reached, typically overnight. The sample was cooled to 195 K by means of a dewar containing dry ice and the isotherm measured to an absolute CO2 pressure of 1 bar (p/p0  0.6). Each isotherm point reached $ 98% equilibration within 30 min and was ﬁtted to a linear driving-force model. All data points were corrected for buoyancy effects. The BET derived surface area was calculated on 9 data points in the pressure range p/p0 ¼ 0.0–0.3.

Warren, Matthew J. Rosseinsky and Darren Bradshaw* Additional Structural Representations of 1 Figure S1. (a) A wire representation of a single (6,3)-type layer of 1 showing the arrangement of the BTB ligands (red) with the two types of Ni centre in the asymmetric unit of 1 (cyan and purple) that act as an additional set of trigonal nodes if only the layer is considered. Each BTB ligand is coordinated to 1xNi(1) and 2xNi(2) or 2xNi(1) and 1xNi(2) (b) The (6,3) layer is non-planar but corrugated in nature due to the significant twisting of the external aromatic rings with respect to the central ring of the BTB ligands. Torsion angles between these rings lie in the range -23.7 to 50.9°.

Coordination about Ni(1) and Ni(2) within the layer of 1 showing that the disordered BTB ring, and hence carboxylate donor, is bound only to Ni(2). In this representation the central BTB ligand is bound to 1xNi(1) and 2xNi(2). See S1 figure caption for further information. Hydrogen atoms omitted.

(a) Wire representation of a single (6,3)-type layer in 2. The Ni centres (cyan) act as linear connectors linking the trigonal BTB nodes (red). (b) Despite the approximately orthogonal arrangement of the trans BTB ligands, a layer structure is obtained due to the twisting between the aromatic rings of the BTB ligands. The torsion angle between the central and external aromatic rings is -42°. (Ni – cyan/purple, C- grey, H – white, O – red, N – blue). For further information see figure S10 below. Figure S10. Construction of (6,3) and (10,3)-a networks from planar trigonal nodes such as 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC). The BTC nodes (blue) are linearly connected by Ni(II) (orange). When the nodes are bound to the metal in a co-planar arrangement a (6,3) network results. However, when these are locked orthogonal to one another a chiral (10,3)-a network propagates.

The Ni centre (omitted) sits midway along the long vertex between O1-O1’. The distances between the donor atoms that define the vertices of the triangular-based pyramidal node are: O1-N1 (O1’-N1’) 2.770(4)Å, O1-N1’ (O1’-N1) 2.946(4)Å, N1-N1’ 3.139(4)Å, O1- O1’ 4.063(3)Å. The long vertex between O1 and O1’ is 1.30 – 1.46 times the length of the other 5 vertices. Atoms labelled X’ are related by the symmetry operation (0.3333+x-y, 0.6667-y, 0.1667-z).

(a) Full TGA profile for 2 up to 700 °C. The first inflection point at 250 °C corresponds to a mass loss of 25%. (b) TGA data for 2 up to 100 °C only, showing a mass loss of 1.2% at this temperature. Based on the crystallographic formula [Ni3(BTB)2(bipy)3(EG)3] ⋅ (toluene), the calculated mass loss for the guest molecules and metal-bound EG is 15.5%. The TGA profiles clearly indicate that this mass is lost in the range 100 – 250 °C but does not occur as distinct mass losses, but is lost concomitantly resulting in framework degradation.
