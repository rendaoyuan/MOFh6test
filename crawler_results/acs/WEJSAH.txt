The nodes are connected by hexamethylenetetramine (hmt) spacers, which act as biconnective bridging ligands, and by carboxylato groups. Channels are observed along the crystallographic c axis. The water molecules from the channels can be easily removed, preserving the architecture of the crystal, which is stable up to 280 °C. The Langmuir surface area was found to be 610 m2 g−1. The sorption ability of 1 was investigated using H2 and CO2. T he construction of molecular crystals featuring nanosized cavities or channels represents one of the hottest topics in crystal engineering and materials science.1 It was already reported that the coordination polymers may have potential applications in various ﬁelds: catalysis,2 molecular magnetism and multifunctional molecule-based materials,3 separation and storage of speciﬁc molecules,4a−f and even bioactive mole- cules.4g The packing of coordination networks generates voids, cavities, or channels, which may account for more than half of the crystal volume.5 A major factor to be considered for solids is the tendency to minimize void space within their structures. The empty space resulting from the packing of coordination polymers can be ﬁlled by (1) hosting the anions, solvent molecules, and uncoordinated ligand molecules and (2) interpenetration, that is, the voids associated with one framework are occupied by one or more independent frameworks. For catalytic or sorption applications, the molecular crystals must be porous. In order to construct them, anionic spacers or anionic ancillary ligands are the most appropriate. In a series of papers, some of us have shown that amino alcohols generate spontaneously binuclear alkoxo-bridged cationic species, which can act as nodes in constructing mono- and bidimensional coordination polymers.6 Aiming to obtain neutral coordination networks and taking advantage of the ability of the alkoxo group to generate binuclear nodes, we decided to employ a hydroxy acid, the mandelic acid (H2mand), which can acts as a dianionic ligand (Chart S1 in the Supporting Information, SI).7 As a spacer, we have chosen a very common organic molecule, hexamethylenetetramine (hmt), which is known to be a versatile tecton in crystal engineering.8 The reaction between copper(II) perchlorate, DL-mandelic acid, and hmt in the presence of triethylamine and ammonia leads to a highly crystalline material:3 ∞[Cu2(mand)2- (hmt)]·H2O (1; see the SI). The crystal structure of 1 (see the SI) has been solved and consists of a neutral 3D coordination network (Figure 1). As expected, the neutral alkoxo-bridged binuclear nodes, {Cu2(mand)2}, are self-assembled into a supramolecular network (Figure 2). The copper atoms are crystallographically equivalent, and the three-dimensional development of the coordination polymer is quite interesting. First of all, we notice that the carboxylato group is connected through its oxygen atoms to two copper ions: one oxygen atom (O1) chelates, together with the alkoxo oxygen (O3) atom, the copper ion, Received: May 30, 2012 Figure 1.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX and the other one (O2) is coordinated to the copper ion from another node (syn−anti bridging mode). The intranode distance between the copper ions is 3.0017(6) Å. Each cooper ion is pentacoordinated, with a slightly distorted square- pyramidal geometry, with the apical position being occupied by the oxygen atom belonging to the carboxylato group of a neighboring node (Cu1−O2″ = 2.314(2) Å, where ″ = 1.25 − y, 0.25 + x, 0.25 −z). The basal plane is formed by one carboxylato, two alkoxo oxygen atoms, and a nitrogen atom from the hmt ligand (Cu1−O1 = 1.9500(19) Å; Cu1−O3 = 1.9351(17) Å; Cu1−O3′ = 1.9616(17) Å; Cu1−N1 = 2.0514(19) Å, where ′ = 1 −x, 2 −y, −z). The hmt molecule acts as a bridge through two out of the four nitrogen atoms, resulting in chains (Figures 2 and 3a), which run in perpendicular planes. The connections between the neighbor- ing perpendicular {Cu2(hmt)} chains are made by the carboxylato groups (Figures 2 and 3b−d). The distance between the copper ions bridged by the carboxylato group is 5.431 Å, while the one between the copper ions connected by the hmt bridge is 5.761 Å. The most interesting feature of the crystal structure is the presence of channels running along the crystallographic c axis (Figure 1). The crystallization water molecules are hosted in these channels, with each one being hydrogen-bonded to one carboxylato oxygen atom (O4W···O2* = 2.786 Å, where * = −0.5 + x, y, 0.5 −z). Textural characterization of 1 was carried out by measuring the adsorption−desorption isotherms of nitrogen at −196 °C. Figure S1 in the SI shows a typical Langmuir isotherm. The surface area was determined using the Langmuir protocol,9 accordingly with the size of the pores of this material and with the composition of the pore walls (quasi homogeneous in polarity), both very close to those exposed by microporous zeolites. The surface area determined from this protocol is 610 m2 g−1. The pore size was determined using the Horwath− Kawazoe formalism,10 which indicates a narrow pore-size distribution with a maximum of 7.94 Å. The pore volume determined from the same data amounts to 0.22 cm3 g−1. The robustness of the crystals was checked by in situ powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) measurements at various temperatures (Figure 4a). The recorded diﬀractograms show that the structure of 1 is preserved up to 280 °C. After 280 °C (Figure 4b), a rapid collapse has been evidenced and the metal−organic framework (MOF) decomposed into CuO, a monoclinic phase (JCPDS 48-1548). Thermogravimetric−diﬀerential thermal analysis (TGA−DTA) experiments conﬁrmed the powder XRD analysis. The TGA of 1 (Figure S2 in the SI) shows two mass losses: an endothermic one until around 140 °C and a second one, in the range 280−360 °C, accompanied by an exothermic eﬀect. The ﬁrst loss is assigned to the elimination of water, while the second loss corresponds to decomposition of the organic ligands. In order to test the ability of 1 to host molecules other than water, several sorption experiments were carried out. For such a purpose, we considered molecules that exhibit current interest for storage, i.e., hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Figure 2.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX B These experiments checked the capability of the new synthesized MOF to capture and store these molecules under ambient conditions. Figure 5 shows the evolution of the adsorption uptakes for H2 and CO2. The H2 and CO2 molecules were adsorbed in volumes that correlate very well with the texture of this MOF, i.e., 10.9 cm3 g−1 for H2 (representing 0.09 wt %) and 90.7 cm3 g−1 for CO2 (representing 17.9 wt %). To obtain more information about this behavior, additional temperature- programmed desorption (TPD), TGA, and diﬀuse-reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) experiments have been carried out for CO2. All of these measurements showed that desorption occurs completely before 100 °C, while the degassed material was able to take up another volume of CO2. CO2-TPD experiments indicated (Figure S3 in the SI) desorption of CO2 corresponding to 78.7 cm3 g−1. Figure S4 in the SI shows the comparative DRIFT and CO2-DRIFT spectra of the investigated MOF. After adsorption, new bands corresponding to CO2 were observed at 2337 and 2360 cm−1, which are assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration.11 Degassing these samples by simple ﬂushing of nitrogen at 50 °C led to the complete recovery of the spectrum of compound 1. Further studies of this and on similar compounds, focusing on their catalytic properties, are in progress in our laboratories. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information X-ray crystallographic data in CIF format, synthesis, crystallo- graphic data, textural characterization of 1, and experimental details on sorption studies.

To a methanolic solution (10ml) of DL-mandelic acid (38 mg, 0.25 mmol) deprotonated with triethylamine (50 mg, 0.5 mmol) was addeed a N,N-dymethylformamide solution (20 ml) of Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (93 mg, 0.25 mmol). To the resulting solution was added a methanolic solution (10 ml) of hexamethylentetramine (35 mg, 0.25 mmol). The solution was stirred further for 1h to yield a light green suspension. To the resulting suspension was added under continous stirring a diluted ammonia solution (10 %) untill the complet solubilization. The dark blue solution was left to evapore at room temeperature. After 1 week green single cristals were isolated by filtration, washed with methanol and air-dried. Crystallography. X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a STOE IPDS II diffractometer operating with Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) X-ray tube with graphite monochromator. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares techniques based on F2. The non-H atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. Calculations were performed using SHELX-97 crystallographic software package. A summary of the crystallographic data and the structure refinement are given in Table S1. CCDC reference number: 884248.

The samples were outgassed at 393 K for 12 h under a residual pressure of 0.1 Pa. Table S2.

Adsorption isotherm of nitrogen at 77 K on full (0-1) p/p0 range The increase of the p/p0 ratio from 0.8 to 1.0 was investigated using the meso- and macropore protocol by measuring both the adsorption and desorption isotherms (Figure S1-1). This indicates an increase of the nitrogen up-take for p/p0 higher than 0.85. Such a behavior may account for the presence of intercrystalline cages resulted from the agglomeration of the 3D metal-organic framework units. The pore volume considering the presence of the intercrystalline cages was thus increased to 0.47 cm³ g-1. TG-DTA Thermogravimetry was performed in a Shimadzu DTG- 60 instrument under dry nitrogen flow (50 mL/min); temperature range was 25–400 ºC with a heating-up rate of 5ºC/min. Differential thermal analysis was conducted in a Shimadsu DTA-60 instrument. The thermogravimetric analysis of 1 shows two mass losses, an endothermic one till around 140 ºC, and a second one, in the range 280-360 ºC, accompanied by an exothermic effect. The first loss is assigned to the elimination of water, while the second loss corresponds to the decomposition of the organic ligands. Figre S2. TGA-DTA curves for compound 1. CO2-TPD CO2-TPD experiments were carried out on an AutoChemII 2920 station from Micromeritics. CO2-TPD measurements were performed after the sorption was fulfilled. Pulses of CO2 were sent to the sample until surface saturation is reached. Then the temperature was increased with 3 K/min and the degassed CO2 was analyzed with a TCD detector. Figure S3 shows the CO2-TPD profile of the investigated MOF. The desorption occurred completely before 350 K, while the degassed material was able to up-take another volume of carbon dioxide. Figure S3. CO2-TPD profile of the investigated MOF CO2-DRIFT (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform) spectra were collected with a NICOLET 470 spectrometer (200 scans with a resolution of 4 cm-1). Pure samples were placed inside a commercial controlled environmental chamber attached to a diffuse reflectance accessory (Smart collector). Spectra were collected in flow of pure nitrogen (30 mL min-1) and CO2-nitrogen mixture (15 vol% CO2) (30 mL min-1) at room temperature. The stability of the adsorbed CO2 species was investigated by further recording spectra of the samples pre-treated in CO2 under flowing nitrogen at room temperature. b a Figure S4.

After the adsorption, new bands corresponding to CO2 were observed at 2337 and 2360 cm-1. SOPBTION STUDIES Pulse sorption was performed by an AutoChemII 2920 station from Micromeritics. The samples (100 mg), placed in a U-shaped quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 0.5 cm, were pretreated under He at 100◦ C for 1 h. Then, the sample was cooled down to RT under a helium flow of 50 mL/min. Pulses of different molecules were sent to the sample, until surface saturation is reached. The amount of adsorbed molecules is obtained by using a calibration curve for each adsorbed molecule.
