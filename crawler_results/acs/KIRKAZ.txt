ABSTRACT: A series of novel multi-dimensional transition metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu(Hbcpb)2]n (1), [Co(bcpb)]n (2), [Co(Hbcpb)2(1,4-bib)]n (3), {[M(bcpb)(1,4-bimb)]·xH2O}n (M = Co (4), Cu (5), Ni (6), x= 1 for 5, 2 for 4 and 6), [Co(bcpb)(4,4'-bibp)]n (7), {[Co(bcpb)(4,4'-bibp)]·2H2O}n (8), and [Ni2(bcpb)2(4,4'-bimbp)2]n (9), were synthesized under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of N-donor ancillary ligands (H2bcpb = 3,5-bis(3- carboxyphenyl)pyridine, 1,4-bib = 1,4-bis(1H-imidazol-4-yl)benzene, 1,4-bimb = 1,4- bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene, 4,4'-bibp = 4,4'-bis(imidazol-1-yl)biphenyl, 4,4'-bimbp = 4,4'- bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)biphenyl).

By adjusting the reaction pH, H2bcpb ligand is partially deprotonated to give Hbcpb- form in 1 and 3, and completely deprotonated to afford bcpb2- form in 2 and 4-9. Complex 1 exhibits a 2D (3,6)-connected kgd topology with the Schläfli symbol of (43)2(46·66·83). The 3D framework of 2 is deﬁned as a (4,4)- connected pts topology with the Schläfli symbol of (42·84). Complex 3 displays a (4,6)-connected pcu topology with the Schläfli symbol of (412·63) built from 44 2D nets with the help of 1,4-bib. Complexes 4-6 are isomorphism and show a 3D (3,5)-connected mbm framework with the Point Schläfli symbol of (4·62)(4·66·83). The supramolecular isomers of 7 and 8, resulted from the different pH in the reaction, exhibit (3,5)-connected (42·67·8)(42·6) 3,5-L2 and (4,6)-connected (44·610·8)(44·62) fsc topology, respectively. Complex 9 can be regard as an unprecedented (3,5)- connected 3D 3,5-T1 frameworks with point schläfli symbol of (42·65·83)(42·6). The results revealed that the crystal architectures and the coordination modes of H2bcpb are attributed to the factors including metal cations, pH, and the N-donor ancillary ligands. Introduction The design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted upsurging research interest not only because of their appealing structural and topological novelty but also owing to their tremendous potential applications in gas storage, microelectronics, ion exchange, chemical separations, nonlinear optics and heterogeneous catalysis.1-3 Generally, the structural diversity of such materials are always dependent on many factors, such as metal ion, template, metal-ligand ratio, pH value, counteranion, and number of coordination sites provided by organic ligands.4,5 Without a doubt, among these factors, the rational design and reasonable use of the characteristic ligand occupies the capital. The length, rigidly, coordination modes, functional groups or substituent of organic ligands have consequential effect on the final structures of Page 2 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 3 MOFs.6 Especially, the aromatic polycarboxylate ligands can serve as excellent candidates for building highly connected, self-penetrating, or helical coordination frameworks due to their bent backbones and versatile bridging fashions.7,8 Apart from the carboxylate linkers, N-donor polyamine ligands are frequently used as ancillary ligand to give multipodal anions acting as bridging, chelating, and charge balance ligands for synthesizing polynuclear species.9 Moreover, the ancillary N-donor ligands also play important role on adjusting the coordination mode of polycarboxylate acid, rarely documented to date. The particular behaviors allow them to be promising candidates for designing beautiful frameworks with diverse topologies, such as pcu, dia, sxa, nbo, mon, scu, fsc, and so on.10 Thus, these considerations inspired us to explore new coordination frameworks with novel designed 3,5-bis(3-carboxyphenyl)pyridine (H2bcpb) and different N-donor ancillary ligands. However, to the best of our knowledge, MOFs based on 3,5-bis(3-carboxyphenyl)pyridine (H2bcpb) have never been documented to date. Compared with the rigid 3,5-pyridine dicarboxylic acid,11 H2bcpb is a more flexible and longer ligand, which possesses several interesting characters: (i) It has two carboxyl groups that may be completely or partially deprotonated, inducing rich coordination modes and allowing interesting structures with higher dimensionalities, (ii) It can act as hydrogen-bond acceptor as well as donor, depending upon the degree of deprotonation, (iii) Two carboxyl groups separated by two phenyl rings can form different dihedral angles through the rotation of C-C single bonds, thus it may ligate metal centers in different orientations. These characters may lead to cavities, interpenetration, helical structures, and other novel motifs with unique topologies. Taking account of these, recently we began to assemble 3,5-bis(3-carboxyphenyl)pyridine (H2bcpb) to react with different metal salts under solvothermal conditions in the presence of imidazole derivatives ligands. In this paper, we Page 3 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 4 reported the syntheses and characterizations of nine novel coordination polymers, [Cu(Hbcpb)2]n (1), [Co(bcpb)]n (2), [Co(Hbcpb)2(1,4-bib)]n (3), {[M(bcpb)(1,4-bimb)]·xH2O}n (M = Co (4), Cu (5), Ni (6)), [Co(bcpb)(4,4'-bibp)]n (7), {[Co(bcpb)(4,4'-bibp)]·2H2O}n (8), and [Ni2(bcpb)2(4,4'- bimbp)2]n (9), which exhibit a systematic variation of architectures from 2D layers to 3D frameworks by the employment of H2bcpb and five different N-donor ancillary ligands (1,4-bib, 1,4-bimb, 4,4'-bibp, 4,4'-bimbp, shown in Chart 1). These results reveal that the ancillary ligand backbones have great influence on the topology of coordination architectures and may be used as a tool to tune the degree of interpenetrations. Chart 1.

Intensity data collection was carried out on a Siemens SMART diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector using Mo-Kα monochromatized radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293(2) K. The absorption correction was based on multiple and symmetry- equivalent reflections in the data set using the SADABS program based on the method of Blessing. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares using the SHELXTL package.13 Crystallographic data for complexes 1–9 are given in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for 1–9 are listed in Table 2.

Result and discussion Synthesis and Characterization. The synthesis of 3,5-bis(3-carboxyphenyl)pyridine (H2bcpb) is shown in Scheme 1. In order to obtain the pure product and the high yield, the used organic solvents should be dried completely during the synthesis of chemicals (II) and (III). The synthesis of (IV) was performed under the N2 atmosphere. The final product of H2bcpb is white if the obtained crude product of (IV) was decolored by refluxing in EtOH with activated carbon. In the present study, complexes 1-9 were prepared from the solvothermal reaction of the related first transitional metal salts and the ligand of H2bcpb in the presence of N-donor ancillary ligands. Although there are no N-donor ancillary ligands in compounds 1 and 2, the reactions without N-donor chemicals as secondary ligands usually gave only some unknown precipitates.

The Diverse Coordination Modes of H2bcpb and the Structural Comparison. As shown in the Table 3 and Scheme 2, H2bcpb exhibits versatile coordination modes in complexes 1-9 and the two carboxyl groups of H2bcpb are completely deprotonated except for 1 and 3. The pyridyl N atoms coordinated with center metal ions in all the complexes. It is also worth noting that H2bcpb exhibits completely different coordination mode in the presence of each employed N- donor ligands. In complex 1 and 3, the H2bcpb ligands are partially deprotonated. Whereas, both of two carboxyl groups in 1 adopt µ1-η1:η0 coordination modes (named as Mode I), and only the deprotonated carboxyl group coordinates with MII ions with µ1-η1:η0 coordination mode in 3 (Mode III). In complexes 2 and 4-9, H2bcpb are completely deprotonated and exhibits different coordination modes. The H2bcpb ligand in complex 2 acts as a “W” bridge to link three Co ions with µ1-η1:η1 and µ2-η2:η1 coordination modes to connect four MII ions (Mode II). In complexes 4-6, the two carboxyl groups of H2bcpb adopt µ1-η1:η1 and µ1-η1:η0 coordination modes (Mode IV). Whereas, just as shown in Scheme 2, the two benzoate groups in 8 exhibits more close distance compared to Mode II and adopt syn-anti µ2-η1:η1 and µ1-η1:η0 modes (Mode VI) to connect four MII ions. In complex 7, the two carboxyl groups of H2bcpb adopt µ1-η1:η1 mode (Mode V). For complex 9, the two unique H2bcpb exhibit different coordination modes, one: Mode V, another: Mode VII. On the other hand, the title nine complexes exhibit completely different connection and topology, mainly due to the pH value, metal ions, and ancillary ligands. The decisive effect of ancillary N-donor ligands on the coordination mode of polycarboxylate acid and the structural diversity is rarely documented to date. The synthetic conditions are similar for 4(5,6) and 9 Page 11 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 12 except for the distance of flexible ancillary ligands (1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene in 4(5,6), 4,4'-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)biphenyl in 9). This difference results in that 4(5,6) and 9 own the (3,5)-connected mbm net and three-fold (3,5)-connected 3D 3,5-T1 net, respectively. The utilized rigid ligand (4,4'-bis(imidazol-1-yl)biphenyl) in 7 leads to a (3,5)-connected 3,5L2 framework, different from 9. In a word, the ancillary ligands have a great effect on the coordination modes of the host polycarboxylate aromatic acid and the final packing structures. With the length of the ancillary ligands increasing, the longer separation of neighboring central ions makes the host aromatic polycarboxylate ligand adopt more “open” coordination modes, and the overall structure a higher degree of interpenetration. The more flexibility of ancillary ligands could make the aromatic polycarboxylate more twisted and the final structure more complicated. Scheme 2. Diverse coordination types of H2bcpb in complex 1-9. Structural Description of [Cu(Hbcpb)2]n (1). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 1 crystallize in the orthorhombic system, space group Pbca. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of one half of CuII atom, and one Hbcpb-. Each CuII center is hexa- coordinated by two N atoms from two Hbcpb- ligands [Cu(1)–N(1) = 2.002(6) Å] and four O atoms from another four Hbcpb- ligands [Cu(1)–O(1) = 1.936(4), Cu(1)–O(3)A = 2.670(2) Å], Page 12 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 13 showing a distorted octahedral coordination geometry (Figure 1a). The ligand of H2bcpb in 1 is partially deprotonated and act as one µ3 node to coordinate with three CuII ions via three dentate atoms including one N and two O atoms, in which both of two carboxyl groups adopt similar µ1- η1:η0 coordination mode (named as Mode I). The dihedral angles between two phenyl rings and the central pyridine ring in one Hbcpb- are 28.16(1) and 52.27(1)°, respectively. And the angle between two phenyl rings in one Hbcpb- is 32.37(1)°. These dihedral data indicates that Hbcpb- was extremely unsymmetrical and not as ﬂat as the disassociated molecule. The divalent Cu ions are linked by Hbcpb- ligands to form a 2D polymeric [Cu(Hbcpb)2]n double-layer with the alternately arranged left- and right-handed helical chains (Figure 1b). Moreover, adjacent nets are further connected through C-H···O interactions (C(1)-H(1)···O(1) = 2.875(1) Å, C(5)- H(5)···O(1) = 3.000(4) Å) to form a 3D packing diagram. The topology analysis method was accessed to simplify the structure.14 The overall framework can be defined as a (3,6)-connected kgd topology with the Schläfli symbol of (43)2(46·66·83) by denoting the CuII atoms as six- connected nodes and Hbcpb- as three-connected nodes, respectively (Figure 1c).

Structural Description of [Co(bcpb)]n (2). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c. As shown in Figure 2a, there are one crystallographically independent CoII atom and one bcpb2- ligand in the asymmetric unit. Similar to compound 1, the Co(1)-O(3A) bond length is much longer (2.690(9) Å, symmetry code, (A): −x, 1−y, 2−z). The CoII center can be regarded as hexa-coordinated by two N atoms from two bcpb2- ligands [Co(1)–N(1) = 2.082(4) Å, Co(1)–O(1) = 2.271(4), Co(1)– O(2) = 2.046(4), Co(1)–O(3B) = 2.021(4), Co(1)–O(4C) = 2.043(4), symmetry codes: (B): - x+1,y+1/2,-z+3/2; (C): x+1,-y+3/2,z-1/2], showing a distorted octahedral coordination geometry.

Similar to 1, bcpb2- was extremely unsymmetrical and not as ﬂat as the disassociated molecule. The dihedral angle between two phenyl rings and the central pyridine ring in bcpb2- are 28.24(1) and 29.78(1)°, respectively. And the one between two phenyl rings is in bcpb2- is 20.84(1)°. The bow-kont dinuclear CoII subunits are generated by sharing the µ2-η2:η1 carboxyl groups with the Co···Co distance is 3.811(3) Å, based on which one unprecedented 3D framework was constructed via the linkage of four-connected bcpb2- ligands (Figure 2b). At the sight of topology, the final framework can be defined as a (4,4)-connected pts topology with the Schläfli symbol of (42·84) by denoting the CoII atoms to four-connected nodes and bcpb2- ligands to four-connected nodes, respectively (Figure 2c).

Structural Description of [Co(Hbcpb)2(1,4-bib)]n (3). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c. As shown in Figure 3a, there are one half of crystallographically independent CoII atom, one Hbcpb- ligand, and one half of 1,4-bib ligand in the asymmetric unit. Each CoII center is hexa- coordinated by four N atoms from two 1,4-bip ligands and two Hbcpb- ligands [Co(1)–N(1) = 2.146(5) and Co(1)–N(3) = 2.204(7) Å] and two O atoms from two different Hbcpb- ligands [Co(1)–O(2) = 2.059(7) Å], showing a distorted octahedral coordination geometry. Although the ligand of H2bcpb is partially deprotonated, the coordination mode is different from 1. Hbcpb- act as one µ2 node to coordinate with two CoII ions via the deprotonated carboxylate oxygen atom and the Npyridine atom (named as Mode III). The dihedral angle between two phenyl rings and central pyridine ring in Hbcpb- are 19.74(1) and 36.01(1)°, respectively. And the one between two phenyl rings in one Hbcpb- is 28.84(1)°. The bridging Hpdpc- ligands connected two neighboring CoII ions along bc plane giving a 44 2D net with right- and left-helix chains alternately arranged (Figure 3b). Furthermore, the 1,4-bib ligands act as pillars and further link the neutral layers into a 3D framework (Figure 3c). The Co···Co distance separated by the 1,4-bib ligand is 12.510(8) Å. From the viewpoint of structural topology, the whole structure of complex 3 can be defined as a (4,6)-connected pcu topology with the Schläfli symbol of (412·63) by denoting the CoII atoms to six-connected nodes and Hbcpb- and 1,4-bib ligands to linkers, respectively (Figure 3d).

The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that complexes 4-6 are isomorphism and crystallize in the monoclinic system, space group P2/n, herein only the structure of 4 will be discussed as a representation. As shown in Figure 4a, there are one crystallographically independent CoII atom, one bcpb2- ligand, one 1,4-bimb ligand, and two free water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Each CoII center is hexa-coordinated by three N atoms from two 1,4-bimb ligands and one bcpb2- ligand [Co(1)–N(1) = 2.179(2), Co(1)–N(2) = Page 17 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 18 2.118(2), Co(1)–N(5) = 2.131(2) Å], and three O atoms from three two bcpb2- ligands [Co(1)– O(1) = 2.171(5), Co(1)–O(2) = 2.194(8), Co(1)–O(4) = 2.032(7) Å], showing a distorted octahedral coordination geometry. The ligand of H2bcpb is completely deprotonated and act as one µ3 node to coordinate with three CoII ions, in which two carboxyl groups adopt µ1-η1:η1 and µ1-η1:η0 coordination modes (named as Mode IV). The dihedral angles between two phenyl rings and central pyridine ring in bcpb2- are 19.98(1) and 25.46(1)°, respectively. And the one between two phenyl rings is in bcpb2- is 26.43(1)°. It is worth noting that the dihedral angles are much bigger for compounds 5 and 6: 43.10(1), 28.80(1), and 61.16(1) for 5; 44.13(1), 27.17(1), and 61.28(1) for 6 (Table 3). The 3-connecetd bcpb2- ligands linked the CoII ions together to form a polymeric (4·82) [Co(bcpb)]n net along ac plane (Figure 4b). Two adjacent 2D sheets are linked in a trans fashion by the 1,4'-bimb ligands to generate a 3D framework. And the Co···Co distance separated by the 1,4-bimb ligand is 13.664(5) Å (Figure 4c). From a topology view, the network of 6 can be rationalized to a (3,5)-connected 3D mbm network with the Point Schläfli symbol of (4·62)(4·66·83), in which CoII and bcpb2- act as five-connected and three-connected node (Figure 4d).

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 7 crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P2/c. As shown in Figure 5a, there are one crystallographically independent CoII atom, one bcpb2- ligand, and one 4,4'-bibp ligand in the asymmetric unit. Each CoII center is hepta-coordinated by Page 19 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 20 three N atoms from two 4,4'-bibp ligands and one bcpb2- ligand [Co(1)–N(1) = 2.211(3), Co(1)– N(3) = 2.177(2) Å], and four O atoms from three bcpb2- ligands [Co(1)–O(1) = 2.194(2), Co(1)– O(2) = 2.344(3) Å], showing a distorted heptahedral coordination geometry. The ligand of H2bcpb is completely deprotonated and acts as one µ3 node to coordinate with three CoII ions, in which two carboxyl groups adopt µ1-η1:η1 chelating coordination mode (named as Mode V). The dihedral angles between two phenyl rings and central pyridine ring in bcpb2- is 33.23(1)°. And the one between two phenyl rings is in Hbcpb- is 63.70(1)°. The Co(II) atoms are bridged by bcpb2- ligands to result in a 1D ladder-like structure, which can be defined as a single left- or right-handed helix (Figure 5b). The [Co(bcpb)]n ladders are extended via the bridge of 4,4'-bibp to form a corrugated 2D network parallel to the ab crystal plane (Figure 5c). Moreover, adjacent nets are further connected through C-H···O interactions (C(5)-H(5)···O(2) = 3.444(4) Å), forming a 3D packing diagram with the solvent-accessible void space 9.6% (146.7 Å3 of the whole volume 1528.7 Å3).

Structural Description of {[Co(bcpb)(4,4'-bibp)]·2H2O}n (8). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 8 crystallizes in the triclinic system, space group Pī. As shown in Figure 6a, there are one crystallographically independent CoII atom, one bcpb2- ligand, one 4,4'-bibp ligand, and two free water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Each CoII center is hexa-coordinated by two N atoms from two 4,4'-bibp ligands and one N atom from one bcpb2- ligand [Co(1)–N(1) = 2.227(5), Co(1)–N(5) = 2.381(5) and Co(1)–N(4)D = 2.244(5) Å], and three O atoms from three bcpb2- ligands [Co(1)–O(1)B = 2.186(5), Co(1)–O(2)C= 2.196(5) and Page 21 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 22 Co(1)–O(3)A = 2.138(5) Å], showing a distorted octahedral coordination geometry, respectively. The ligand of H2bcpb is completely deprotonated and act as one µ4 node to coordinate with four CoII ions, in which two carboxyl groups adopt trans µ2-η1:η1 and µ1-η1:η0 coordination modes (named as Mode VI). The dihedral angles between two phenyl rings and central pyridine ring in bcpb2- are 34.88(1) and 33.35(1)°, respectively. And the one between two phenyl rings is in bcpb2- is 57.58(1) °. The V-shaped bcpb2- ligands conjoin the {Co2} dinuclear units into a polymeric [Co2(bcpb)2]n layer motif that lies parallel to the ab crystal plane (Figure 2). The closest through- ligand Co···Co distances within the layer measure 9.164, 9.370, and 10.227 Å. It is interesting to note that the bcpb2- ligands linked the Co ions to left- and right-handed helix chains along a crystallographic a axis. The resulting left- or right-handed helices with a pitch of 9.633(8) Å and alternately arrange in a left- and right-handed sequence, so that the whole sheet does not show chirality. The pyridine N atoms link other dinuclear CoII subunits, giving a (3,6)-connected 2D 63 net (Figure 6b). Furthermore, the 4,4'-bibp ligands act as pillars and further link the neutral layers into a 3D framework (Figure 6c). The Co···Co distance separated by the 4,4'-bibp lignd is 17.901 Å. From the viewpoint of structural topology, the overall framework can be defined as a (4,6)-connected fsc topology with the Schläfli symbol of (44·610·8)(44·62) by denoting CoII and bcpb2- as six-connected nodes and four-connected nodes, respectively (Figure 6d).

Structural Description of [Ni2(bcpb)2(4,4'-bimbp)2]n (9). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 9 crystallizes in the triclinic system, space group Pī, showing an unprecedented (3,5)-connected 3D network with the Schläfli symbol of (42·65·83)(42·6). As shown in Figure 7a, there are two crystallographically independent NiII atoms, two bcpb2- ligands, and two 4,4'-bimbp ligands in the asymmetric unit. Both Ni(1) and Ni(2) are coordinated by three N atoms from two 4,4'-bimbp ligands and one bcpb2- ligand, and three O atoms from Page 23 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 24 two bcpb2- ligands. The Ni-O/N bond lengths and the bond angles around each NiII center are 2.039(3)-2.176(4)/2.108(5)-2.101(4) Å and 83.54(16)-175.39(14)°, respectively. In 9, two bcpb2- ligands exhibit different coordination modes; two carboxyl groups in one adopt µ1-η1:η1 (Mode V), another shows similar µ1-η1:η0 coordination mode (Mode VII). The NiII ions are bridged alternately by the above two kinds of bcpb2- ligands to form ladder chains along b axis, Figure 7b, which are further linked along a and c axis by the trans 4,4'-bimbp ligands to generate a 3D framework consisting of rhombic cavities with effective sizes of 15.39 × 17.40 Å2 (Figure 7c). From a topology view, the final structure of 9 can be regard as a novel (3,5)-connected 3D 3,5-T1 frameworks with point schläfli symbol of (42·65·83)(42·6) by denoting the CoII ions to five-connected nodes and bcpb2- ligands simplified as three-connected nodes (Figure 7d).

The IR spectras of complexes 1–9 and H2bcpb ligand are shown in Figure 8 and Figure S1. For complexes 1 and 3, 2 and 4, the similar peaks in the range 1200-1700 cm-1 indicated the aucillary ligands have little effect on the IR characteristic spectra of carboxylate groups. The peaks of in the range of 1485–1682 cm-1 are corresponded with the symmetric stretching the carboxylic groups.

Infrared spectras of compounds 1-9 and the H2bcpb ligand: displaying the positions of the peaks which allow one to characterize the coordination modes in the frameworks. X-ray Power Diffraction Analyses and Thermal Analyses. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been used to check the phase purity of the bulky samples in the solid state. For complex 1–9, the measured XRD patterns closely match the simulated patterns generated from the results of single-crystal diffraction data, indicative of pure products (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed in N2 atmosphere on polycrystalline samples of complex 1–9 and the TG curves are shown in Figure 9. For compounds 1 and 2, the whole structure began to collapse around 139 and 165 °C with the residual weight is ca. 10.9% (calc. for CuO 11.4%) for 1, 21.1% (calc. for Co2O3 21.9%) for 2, respectively. For 3, the loss of 1,4-bib (obsd: 22.79%; calcd: 23.26%) and bcpb2- (obsd: 68.7%; calcd: 70.22%) took place aroud 78 and 196 °C, respectively. For isomorphism of 4-6, an initial weight loss of 5.3% in 4, 2.7% in 5, and 5.1% in 6 corresponds to the loss of lattice water (calcd: 5.5% in 4, 2.6% in 5, and 5.6% in 6). The second weight loss corresponds to the loss of Page 26 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 27 4,4′-bimb and bcpb2- with the residual weight is ca. 12.3% (calc. for Co2O3 12.7%) for 4, 11.9% (calc. for CuO 12.5%) for 5, and 11.9% (calc. for NiO 11.5%) for 6, respectively. For 7, two stages of weight occurred at 152 and 243°C, and corresponded to 4,4'-bibp and bcpb2-, respectively. For 8, the first weight loss at 57 °C is attributed to the release of lattice water molecules (obsd: 4.9%; calcd: 5.1%). The second weight loss of 36.1% (calcd: 36.6 %) from147 °C corresponds to the loss of the 4,4′-bimp. The third weight loss is related with bcpb2- with the residual weight is ca. 11.1% (calc. for Co2O3 11.8%). For 9, two weight loss steps observed at 310 and 370 °C are attributed to 4,4'-bimbp and bcpb2-, with the residual weight is ca. 10.2% (calc. for NiO 10.8%). Figure 9. TG curves for complexes 1-9. Magnetic Properties. The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements of dinuclear complexes 2 and 8 were performed on the Quantum Design SQUID MPMS XL-7 instruments in the temperature range of 2-300 K under a field of 1000 Oe. Temperature dependence of χMT and 1/χM for complexes complexes 2 and 8 are displayed in Figure 10. The χMT values for 2 and 8 at room temperature are 5.25 and 5.31 cm3 K mol-1, respectively, larger than that for two isolated CoII ions (3.75 cm3 K mol-1), which can be attributed to the Page 27 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 28 contribution to the susceptibility from orbital angular momentum at higher temperatures. The fitting result is comparable with those reported for other coupled Co(II) dimmers.16 Figure 10. Temperature dependence of 1/χM and χMT in dinuclear complex 2 (a) and 8 (b). Solid lines represent the best theoretical fits. Conclusion In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized one novel polycarboxylates ligand of H2bcpb, based on which nine novel coordination polymers were obtained under the hydrothermal conditions in the presence of five imidazole ligands. Compounds 1–9 displayed appealing structural features from 2D layers to 3D frameworks, such as rarely reported (3,5)- connected (42·67·8)(42·6) 3,5-L2 of 7, (4,6)-connected (44·610·8)(44·62) fsc of 8, and(3,5)- connected 3D 3,5-T1 framework of 9. Detailed comparison of these networks reveals that the ancillary N-donor ligands play important role on adjusting the coordination modes of polycarboxylate acid and and structural topology. With the length of the ancillary ligands increasing, the longer separation of neighboring central ions makes the host aromatic polycarboxylate ligand adopt more “open” coordination modes, and the overall structure a higher degree of interpenetration. The more flexibility of ancillary ligands could make the aromatic polycarboxylate more twisted and the final structure more complicated.

In order to resolve some of the more serious problems it may be necessary to carry out additional measurements or structure refinements. However, the nature of your study may justify the reported deviations from journal submission requirements and the more serious of these should be commented upon in the discussion or experimental section of a paper or in the "special_details" fields of the CIF. checkCIF was carefully designed to identify outliers and unusual parameters, but every test has its limitations and alerts that are not important in a particular case may appear. Conversely, the absence of alerts does not guarantee there are no aspects of the results needing attention. It is up to the individual to critically assess their own results and, if necessary, seek expert advice. If level A alerts remain, which you believe to be justified deviations, and you intend to submit this CIF for publication in Acta Crystallographica Section C or Section E, you should additionally insert an explanation in your CIF using the Validation Reply Form (VRF) below. Your explanation will be considered as part of the review process.

Data that may be required is missing Publication of your CIF You should attempt to resolve as many as possible of the alerts in all categories. Often the minor alerts point to easily fixed oversights, errors and omissions in your CIF or refinement strategy, so attention to these fine details can be worthwhile. In order to resolve some of the more serious problems it may be necessary to carry out additional measurements or structure refinements. However, the nature of your study may justify the reported deviations from journal submission requirements and the more serious of these should be commented upon in the discussion or experimental section of a paper or in the "special_details" fields of the CIF. checkCIF was carefully designed to identify outliers and unusual parameters, but every test has its limitations and alerts that are not important in a particular case may appear. Conversely, the absence of alerts does not guarantee there are no aspects of the results needing attention. It is up to the individual to critically assess their own results and, if necessary, seek expert advice. If level A alerts remain, which you believe to be justified deviations, and you intend to submit this CIF for publication in Acta Crystallographica Section C or Section E, you should additionally insert an explanation in your CIF using the Validation Reply Form (VRF) below. Your explanation will be considered as part of the review process. If you intend to submit to another section of Acta Crystallographica or Journal of Applied Crystallography or Journal of Synchrotron Radiation, you should make sure that at least a basic structural check is run on the final version of your CIF prior to submission. # start Validation Reply Form _vrf_PUBL004_GLOBAL ; PROBLEM: The contact author’s name and address are missing, RESPONSE: ... ; _vrf_PUBL005_GLOBAL ; PROBLEM: _publ_contact_author_email, _publ_contact_author_fax and RESPONSE: ... ; _vrf_PUBL006_GLOBAL ; PROBLEM: _publ_requested_journal is missing RESPONSE: ... ; _vrf_PUBL008_GLOBAL ; PROBLEM: _publ_section_title is missing.
