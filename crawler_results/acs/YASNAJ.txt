These compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, and X-ray single-crystal diffraction. Compound 1 is a 3D network composed of layers of pentagonal-bipyramidal coordinated Cd atoms bridged by pimelic anions in syn−anti configurations and bpbenz molecules between layers with {412.63} pcu topology. In compound 2, the bpbenz and sebacylic anions act as bidentate ligands assembling with Cd(NO3)2 to a 2D framework. Compound 3 is a 2D network composed of chains, which is bridged by the [Cd2(CO2)4]2L2 SBUs and hfipbb2‑ anions, and with bpbenz molecules between chains. For compound 4, the bpbenz and 4,4′-sdb coordinate to Co cations to form a three-dimensional{65.8} cds uninodal network. Compound 5 features 2D structure with inclined polycatenation (1D + 1D → 2D). For compound 6, a 2D network with side arms leads to the formation of a polythreaded network, which exhibits a 2-fold interpenetrating 3D array if H-bonds are taken into account. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that compounds 4 and 6 have dominating antiferromagnetic couplings between metal ions. Furthermore, thermal stabilities for 1−6 and luminescent properties for 1−3 are also discussed in detail. ■INTRODUCTION The design and synthesis of metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) are of great interest not only for their potential applications in catalysis, magnetism, adsorption, and sensing materials1 but also for their intriguing variety of structures.2 So far, a number of N-donor bridging ligands such as 4,4′- bipyridine, 1,2-bis(4′-pyridyl) ethane/ethene, and 1,3-bis(4′- pyridyl)-propane have been widely employed to construct coordination polymers.3 In this regard, our synthetic strategy was to select bpbenz4 and introduce carboxylate ligands with different rigidity as coligands into the reaction systems,5 based on the following considerations: (1) The selection of suitable spacer ligands, such as the bpbenz ligand, is extremely important to control and adjust the topology of coordination frameworks. Besides, the rigid bidentate linear ligands may benefit to form large voids, and the resulting complexes may have good tendency for the formation of entanglement.6 (2) The introduction of carboxylate ligands with different rigidity as coligands helps us to explore their impact on the formation of structures. (3) The flexible long-chain dicarboxylate ligands have been rarely reported in assembling coordination polymers. In addition, flexible ligands may lead to dynamic porous MOFs that can shrink and expand.7 Polycatenation and polythreading are interesting networks of entangled systems, which is a noticeable realm of chemistry for its potential application.8 Polycatenation is distinguished from common interpenetration by the feature of dimensionality increase.8c Herein, five carboxylate ligands with different rigidity, namely, pimelic acid (pim),9a sebacylic acid (sea),9b 4,4′- (hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) (H2hfipbb),10 4,4′-sulfonyldibenzoate (4,4′-sdb),11 and 1,3,5-benzenetricar- boxylate (H3btc)12 (Scheme 1), were used as coligands to react with the bpbenz ligand and different bivalent metal salts. Then, six new complexes are obtained, namely, {[Cd(bpbenz)- (pim)]}n (1), {[Cd(bpbenz)(sea)]·(H2O)2}n (2), {[Cd- (bpbenz)(hfipbb)]·(H2O)3}n (3), {[Co(bpbenz)(4,4′- sdb)]·(H 2O) 2 . 7 5} n (4), {[Ni(bpbenz)(4,4′-sdb)- (H2O)3]·(H2O)2}n (5), and {[Co(bpbenz)(Hbtc)]·(H2O) }n (6), and the details of their syntheses, structures, and physical properties are reported below.

Growth Des. 2012, 12, 403−413 ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials and Measurements. Reagents and solvents employed were commercially available. Bpbenz ligand was prepared on the basis of palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. IR absorption spectra of the compounds were recorded in the range of 400−4000 cm−1 on a Nicolet (Impact 410) spectrometer with KBr pellets (5 mg of sample in 500 mg of KBr). C, H, and N analyses were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X- ray diffractometer using Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å), in which the X-ray tube was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a Netzsch STA 449C thermal analyzer from room temperature up to 873 K using a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under a N2 atmosphere and then maintained at 873 K for 1 h in an air atmosphere. Solid-state UV−vis diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained at room temperature using Shimadzu UV-3600 double monochromator spectrophotometer, and BaSO4 was used as a 100% reflectance standard for all materials. Luminescent spectra were recorded with a SHIMAZU VF-320 X-ray fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature. Temperature- dependent magnetic susceptibility data for polycrystalline Co compounds were obtained on a MPMS XL-7 SQUID magnetometer under an applied field of 2000 Oe over the temperature range of 1.8− 300 K. Synthesis of 1−6. Single crystals of 1−6 were prepared in the similar synthetic procedures, and thus, only the compound 1 will be discussed here. A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·6H2O (30.1 mg, 0.1 mmol), bpbenz (23.23 mg, 0.1 mmol), and pimelic acid (15.82 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 8 mL of DMF/H2O. The final mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL) under autogenous pressure and heated at 95 °C for 3 days. The colorless block crystals of Scheme 1.

X-ray crystallographic data of 1−6 were collected at room temperature using epoxy-coated crystals mounted on glass fiber. X-ray crystallographic data of these compounds were collected on a Bruker Apex Smart CCD diffractometer with graphite- monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Structure solutions were solved by direct methods, and the nonhydrogen atoms were located from the trial structures and then refined anisotropically with SHELXTL using full-matrix least-squares procedures based on F2 values.13 The hydrogen atom positions were fixed geometrically at calculated distances and allowed to ride on the parent atoms. The distributions of peaks in the channels of 3−5 were chemically featureless to refine using conventional discrete-atom models. To resolve these issues, the contribution of the electron density by the remaining water molecule was removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON.14 The numbers of solvent water molecules in 3−5 were obtained by element analyses. The relevant crystallographic data are presented in Table 1, while the selected bond lengths and angles are given in the Supporting Information (Table S1). A semiempirical absorption correction was applied using SADABS.15 ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crystal Structure of {[Cd(bpbenz)(pim)]}n (1). The crystal structure determination reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in monoclinic crystal system of P21/n. The asymmetric unit contains one Cd(II) cation, one bpbenz ligand, and one deprotonated pimelic acid. The remaining portion is generated by inversion symmetry (Figure 1a). The pimelic anion connects three Cd(II) cations, one carboxylate group takes μ3-chelating-bridging tridentate mode, while the other carboxylate group adopts chelation in a bidentate mode. Cd(II) is seven-coordinate, bonding to five O atoms from three pim ligands and two N atoms from two bpbenz ligands. As shown in Figure 1b, two Cd(II) ions are bridged by two carboxylate O atoms (O4, O4#1), forming a four-membered Figure 1. (a) Coordination environment of the Cd(II) ions in 1.

Four pim ligands connect four [Cd2(CO2)4] units to form a M4L4 ring, and each [Cd2(CO2)4] unit binds to four adjacent units through the four other pim ligands to form an undulating 2D network with 44 topology. Parallel 2D layers are connected by the bpbenz ligands to form a 3D coordination polymer network (Figure 1c). The Cd−O bond distances vary in the range of 2.304(3)−2.371(3)Å, and the Cd−N bond distances vary in the range of 2.330(3)−2.348(3)Å, which are all similar to those found in other Cd(II) compounds.16 From a topological perspective, the SBU [Cd2(CO2)4] acts as a six- connected node, and complex 1 represents {412.63} α-Po pcu topology by using pim and bpbenz ligands as linkers (Figure 1d).17 Crystal Structure of {[Cd(bpbenz)(sea)]·(H2O)2}n (2). X- ray analysis reveals that the asymmetric unit of 2 consists of one crystallographically independent cadmium(II) cation, one deprotonated sea ligand, one bpbenz ligand, and two free water molecules. As shown in Figure 2a, the sea ligand adopts the similar coordination mode with pim ligands in which one carboxylate group takes μ3-chelating-bridging tridentate mode, while the other carboxylate group adopts chelation in a bidentate mode. The Cd center is seven-coordinated by five oxygen atoms belonging to four separated sea ligands as well as two nitrogen atoms from bpbenz ligands with the Cd−O distances ranging from 2.296(6) to 2.489(6) Å and Cd−N distances ranging from 2.318(6) to 2.322(5) Å, which can be compared with values reported.16 Different from the flexible pim ligands in complex 1, two sea ligands connect two [Cd2(CO2)4] units to form a M2L2 ring, and each [Cd2(CO2)4] unit binds to two adjacent units through the sea to form an 1D ribbonlike chain (Figure 2b). The Cd−Cd distance across the binuclear unit measures 3.845 Å. Then, the bpbenz ligands join all infinite 1D chains into a 2D layer (Figure 2c). As we know, the transition mental centers are bridged by flexible dicarboxylate ligands to generate 1D chains and 2D layers, which are pillared by rigid ligands into higher dimensional frameworks. The pimelic acid generates 2D layers, and the sebacylic acid is inclined to generate 1D chains.9c The result implies that the subtle difference in coligand has a great influence on the structure of the complexes. Crystal Structure of {[Cd(bpbenz)(hfipbb)]·(H2O)3}n (3). The crystal structure determination reveals that compound 3 crystallizes in the triclinic crystal system of P1̅. The asymmetric unit contains one Cd(II) cation, one bpbenz ligand, one deprotonated hfipbb acid, and three free water molecules (Figure 3a). In the asymmetric unit, the two carboxylate groups of hfipbb ligand take different coordination Figure 2. (a) Coordination environment of the Cd(II) ions in 2.

Growth Des. 2012, 12, 403−413 406 modes, one carboxylate group takes bismonodentate coordina- tion mode to bridge two Cd centers, while the other carboxylate group adopts chelation in a bidentate mode. Cd(II) is six-coordinate, bonding to four O atoms from three hfipbb ligands and two N atoms from two bpbenz ligands. Neighboring cadmium atoms are also joined into a [Cd2(CO2)4] binuclear unit with a four-membered ring by the bridging carboxylate. The Cd−Cd distance across the binuclear unit is 4.1150(9) Å. Two hfipbb ligands connect two [Cd2(CO2)4] units to form a M2L2 ring, and each [Cd2(CO2)4] unit binds to four adjacent units through the four hfipbb ligands to form a 1D beaded chain. The bent conformation of a dihedral angle between the two benzene rings in hfipbb ligand is 112.173(13)° to form a square channel with the fluorine atoms pointing outside and dimensions of 11.329 Å × 12.069 Å (Figure 3b). Finally, the chains are connected by the bpbenz ligands to form a 2D coordination polymer network (Figure 3c,d). The Cd−O bond distances vary in the range of 2.217(4)−2.399(4)Å, and the Cd−N bond distances vary in the range of 2.317(4)−2.319(4)Å. All of these distances fall in the normal range found in other Cd complexes. Crystal Structure of {[Co(bpbenz)(4,4′-sdb)]·(H2O)2.75}n (4). Compound 4 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system, space group C2/c. As shown in Figure 4a, there is one crystallographically independent Co(II) cation, one bpbenz, one 4,4′-sdb ligand, and two and three-quarters of free water molecules. Co1 sites in an octahedral coordination sphere, which is defined by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from three different 4,4′-sdb ligands at the equatorial position, and the other two coordinated N atoms from bpbenz at the axial positions. The Co−O bond distances vary in the range of 2.017(2)−2.208(2)Å, and the Co−N bond distances vary in the range of 2.124(2)−2.140(2)Å, which are all similar to those found in other Co(II) compounds.18 Two 4,4′-sdb ligands connect two [Co2(CO2)4] units to form a M2L2 ring, and each [Co2(CO2)4] unit binds to four adjacent units through the 4,4′- sdb ligands to form a 1D chain (Figure 4b). The bpbenz links the 1D chain with different propagating direction to form a 3D Figure 3. (a) Coordination environment of the Cd(II) ions in 3. The hydrogen atoms and free water molecules are omitted for clarity (30% ellipsoid probability). Symmetry codes: #1 = 1 −x, 1 −y, 2 −z; #2 = x, y, 1 + z; #3 = −1 + x, 1 + y, z.

Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg2012638 | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 403−413 407 framework (Figure 4c). The desolvated framework shows 28.1% void space to the total crystal volume, as calculated by the PLATON. A better insight into the nature of this intricate framework is provided by a topology analysis, reducing multidimensional structures to simple nodes and connection nets. The Co2(CO2)4 units can be regarded as four-connected nodes, and all crystallographical independent ligands act as linkers. Therefore, the whole structure can thus be represented as a cds topology (with the Schläfli symbol {65.8}) (Figure 4d). Crystal Structure of {[Ni(bpbenz)(4,4′-sdb)- (H2O)3]·(H2O)2 }n (5). X-ray diffraction analysis shows that complex 5 features an (1D + 1D →2D) inclined polycatenated framework with two sets of equivalent 1D chains. The asymmetric unit contains two parts: two Ni(II) cations, two partly deprotonated 4,4′-sdb ligands, two and two halves bpbenz molecules, three coordinated, and two free water molecules (Figure 5a). The coordination environments around Ni1 and Ni2 are described as slightly distorted [NiN3O3] octahedrons. Ni1 is defined by three O atoms (one carboxylate oxygen atoms, two O atoms from water molecules) and one N atom from bpbenz at the equatorial position, and the other two coordinated N atoms from bpbenz at the axial positions. Different from Ni1, two O atoms are from one 4,4′-sdb ligand and one comes from water around Ni2. As shown in Figure 5b, the deprotonated 4,4′-sdb and bpbenz molecules connect the Ni2+ to form 1D chain with a 14.36 Å × 15.51 Å loop created by four bpbenz ligands and four Ni(II) atoms. As shown in Figure 5c,d, the red chains lies at an inclined angle and interlocks with the blue one, to give an overall 2D entanglement, with an angle of 42.341(28)° between the two Figure 4.

The 1D + 1D →2D polycatenated framework is further stabilized by hydrogen-bonding interactions. The uncoordinated O atoms of the carboxylate groups accept hydrogen bonding from the coordinated water molecules (Table 2). Rarely reported is one isolate structure with inclined polycatenation and polythreading. Crystal Structure of {[Co(bpbenz)(Hbtc)]·(H2O) }n (6). Compound 6 contains one crystallographically unique Co(II) atom, one bpbenz ligand, one Hbtc2−anion, and one free water molecule. As shown in Figure 6a, each Co(II) cation is six- coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two bpbenz ligands and four carboxylate oxygen atoms from four Hbtc2−ligands Figure 5.

Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg2012638 | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 403−413 410 coordination modes. The Co−O bond distances vary in the range of 2.0013(18)−2.334(2), and the Co−N bond distance is 2.061(2) Å, which are all similar to those found in other Co(II) compounds. Similar with the previously reported structure,20 all of the (4,4) 2D layers are stacked in an offset ABAB manner,21 and only one N atom in the bpbenz ligand coordinates to Co(II) cation, and the other side goes through another set of 2D layer (Figure 6b) to form a mutual polythreading structure (Figure 6c). When considering the H-bonds interaction (Table 2), the bpbenz ligands of the A layers penetrate the B to connect the next A layers (Figure 6d), thus forming a binodal 6-coordinated 2-fold interpenetrating 3D architecture with a {4.62}2{42.610.83} rutile topology (Figure 6e). Effect of Carboxylate Coligands and Metal Center. In this study, carboxylate coligands with different flexibility were used to investigate their influence on the structure of the divalent transition metal complexes. As for compound 1, the pimelic acid link Cd(II) cations to generate 2D layers, which are pillared by bpbenz ligands into 3D frameworks. When another sebacylic ligand was used, complex 2 with a 2D network structure rather than the 3D framework was obtained, which may be attributed to the fact that the longer alkyl chain in sebacylic ligand prohibits the connection of 2D layers into a 3D structures. In complexes 3−5, two semirigid ligands were taken into the reaction. There are 1D networks formed by metal−carboxylate ligands coordination, which are further linked by bpbenz ligands to give a 2D framework (3) or 3D network (4), while partly deprotonated 4,4′-sdb ligands are linked by bpbenz ligands and metal centers to form an 1D + 1D →2D polycatenated framework (5). Different metal ions with different coordination environments have a great influence on the structural construction, which may be the main reason for the structural difference in 4 and 5. However, in 6, the coordination of rigid Hbtc2−ligands with Co(II) atoms forms a 2D framework. The uncoordinated N atom in the bpbenz ligand connects the next layers through the H-bonds interaction to form a 3D array. UV−visible Spectra. As can be seen in the UV−vis absorbance spectra in the Supporting Information (Figure S7), compounds 4−6 show intensive bands in the UV range at 200−330 nm; all of these peaks are due to the intraligand charge transfer transitions. In addition, for compounds 4 and 6, we observe two additional peaks at 460 nm [4T1g(F) → 4T2g(F)] with a shoulder at 530 nm [4T1g(F) →4T1g(P)] and 730 nm assigned to the 4T1g(F) →4A2g(F) transitions. Besides, two additional peaks are also observed for Ni(II) compound. The second small peak centers at 400 nm [3T1g(p) →3A2g], and the third sites in 630 nm [3T1g(F) →3A2g], which are typical for octahedrally coordinated Ni(II) complexes.22 Luminescent Properties and PXRD Results. Lumines- cent compounds are of great interest due to their various applications in chemical sensor, photochemistry, and light- emitting diodes (LEDs).23 The luminescent properties of ligands bpbenz, hfipbb, with complexes 1−3 have been investigated in the solid state at room temperature, as depicted in the Supporting Information (Figure S8). Emissions of the bpbenz and hfipbb were observed with wavelengths at 364 and 384 nm in bpbenz (λex = 356 nm), 395 nm (λex = 356 nm) in hfipbb, which could be attributed to the π*−π transitions. The emission peaks were at 410 nm in 1 (λex = 355 nm), 410 nm in 2 (λex = 375 nm), and 420 nm in 3 (λex = 359 nm). Complexes 1−3 are similar to that of the free bpbenz and hfipbb ligands and show a red shift as compared with that of bpbenz ligand, which may be assigned to ligand to metal change transfer (LMCT).24 To confirm whether the crystal structures are truly representative of the bulk materials, PXRD experiments were carried out for 1−6. The PXRD experimental and computer- simulated patterns of the corresponding complexes are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S9−S14), and they show that the bulk synthesized materials and the measured single crystals are the same. Thermal Analysis. To characterize the complexes more fully in terms of thermal stability, their thermal behaviors were studied by TGA (Supporting Information, Figure S15). The TGA curve of 1 shows that it is decomposed quickly after 380 °C, suggesting that the framework is thermally stable. A white residue of CdO (observed, 26.65%; calcd, 25.45%) is obtained at 487 °C. For complex 2, a weight loss is observed from 140 to 260 °C, which is attributed to the loss of the two lattice water molecules, with a weight loss of 6.04% (calcd, 6.20%); then, the ligands are removed from the complex. A plateau of 23.55% at 593 °C is observed, which may be a CdO (calculated, 22.10%) residue. In complex 3, a weight loss of 6.94% (calcd, 6.84%) is observed from 70 to 212 °C, attributed to the loss of the three lattice water molecules, which were removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON and were obtained by element analyses. Further weight loss indicates the decomposition of coordina- tion framework from 223 °C. At 590 °C, a CdO residue of 17.08% (calcd, 16.28%) is obtained. The TGA curve of 4 is a 5.28% (calcd, 5.74%) weight loss of four solvent water molecules from 40 to 140 °C, and the framework is collapsed. The final product may be CoO of 11.70% (calcd, 11.62%). The TGA curve of 5 shows the network of compound 5 loses solvent water molecules from 30 to 158 °C, with a weight loss of 7.61% (calcd, 7.52%), and the ligands are burnt quickly. It is speculated that the final product is NiO of 10.48% (calcd, 9.87%). In the case of 6, a little weight loss is observed from 120 to 160 °C due to the release of one lattice water molecules with a weight loss of 3.34% (calcd, 3.48%); furthermore, the decomposition of 6 occurs after 421 °C. Finally, the speculated CoO residue of 15.00% (calced, 14.48%) is observed. Magnetic Properties. The magnetic measurements were performed on polycrystalline samples of 4 and 6 using a SQUID magnetometer under an applied field of 2000 Oe over the temperature range of 1.8−300 K. The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of 4 in the forms of χMT and χM versus T is displayed in Figure 7. As the Figure 7. Temperature dependence of χMT and χM vs T for 4 (open circles and red lines represent experimental data and fits). Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg2012638 | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 403−413 411 temperature cools, χMT continuously decreases from 3.43 cm3 K mol−1 at 300 K to 1.17 cm3 K mol−1 at 1.8 K, indicating antiferromagnetic coupling between Co ions. The spin−orbit coupling observed in complex 4 can be estimated by zero field splitting (ZFS) effects of a single ion of Co(II), and the coupling interaction between Co(II) ions can be given by the mean field approximation (zj′). The magnetic susceptibility from 1.8 to 300 K can be fit by following eq 1 for S = 3/2 systems with dominant ZFS effects, D:25b χ = β + + || − − Ng kT e e 1 9 4(1 ) x x 2 2 2 2 χ = β + − + ⊥ − − Ng kT e e 4 (1 ) 4(1 ) x x x 2 2 3 2 2 χ = χ + χ || ⊥ ( 2 )/3 χ = χ′ − χ′ ′ μ ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ 1 zj Ng 2 2 B 2 (1) where x is D/(kBT) and D is the magnitude of the ZFS. We obtained the best agreement between model and experiment (g = 2.19, D = −24 cm−1, zj′ = −0.17 cm−1, and R = 3 × 10−5.) The ZFS values is in good agreement with the previously reported values.25 For compound 6, the experimental χMT value equal to 5.86 cm3 K mol−1 at 300 K is greater than the expected value of 3.75 cm3 K mol−1 for two isolated high-spin Co(II) ions (g = 2 and S = 3/2) per formula because of the prominent orbital contribution contribution arising from the 4T1g ground state of Co(II). Upon cooling, χMT continuously decreases and reaches 0.18 cm3 K mol−1 at 1.8 K. The magnetic susceptibility data were fitted assuming that the carboxylate and oxygen bridges of the Co(II) ions form an isolated spin dimer system. The intermolecular magnetic coupling constants zj′ were taken into account, and the magnetic susceptibility from 11.9 to 300 K was fitted with eq 2, which is deduced from the spin Hamiltonian, H = −2JS1S2:26 ∑ ̂ = − ̂ ̂ = − ̂ − ̂ = H JS S J S S 2 ( ) i 1 2 T 2 1 2 2 = − + E S JS S ( ) ( 1) T T T = S 0, 1, 2, 3 T = − − − E S J J J ( ) 0, 2 , 6 , 12 T χ = β × + + + + + = β × + + + + + Ng kT e e e e e e Ng kT e e e e e e 3 84 30 6 7 5 3 1 2 14 5 7 5 3 1 J kT J kT J kT J kT J kT J kT J kT J kT J kT J kT J kT J kT M 2 2 12 / 6 / 2 / 12 / 6 / 2 / 2 2 12 / 6 / 2 / 12 / 6 / 2 / (2) An excellent fit was obtained with J = −2.19 cm−1, zj′ = −1.60 cm−1, and g = 2.52 with an agreement factor R = 9.6 × 10−7. This result also indicates antiferromagnetic coupling between two CoII centers through two carboxylate bridges and two oxygen bridges. ■CONCLUSIONS In this work, six new complexes have been successfully synthesized under solvothermal conditions. All of these compounds get the 2D or 3D supramolecular structures through intermolecular interactions. The results show that the introduction of carboxylate ligands with different rigidity as the coligands, that is, two flexible (pim and sea), two semirigid (hfipbb and 4,4′-sdb), and one rigid ligand (H3btc) plays an important role in the formation of the diversity of structures and topologies. In conclusion, the flexible ligands not only can take different conformations and coordination modes to meet the coordination nature of the metal cations but also are inclined to generate ring or cycle structures and then further form polycatenation and polythreading,27 whereas the rigid ligands are inclined to construct coordination complexes with special topologies due to the predictablility of the resulting networks.27c Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that compounds 4 and 6 exhibit antiferromagnetic coupling interaction. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information X-ray crystallographic information files (CIF) for complexes 1− 6.
