That the emerging class of materials known as metal-organic materials, MOMs,1 are composed of modular building blocks makes them amenable to rational design in terms of both structure and function.2 Indeed, those MOMs that exhibit per- manent porosity and extraordinarily high surface area, me- tal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs), could ultimately serve as hydrogen storage materials for use in fuel cells.3 In this context, there is a need to design porous MOM platforms that are fine-tunable in terms of the metal moiety and/or the nature of the organic ligand. Such platforms would facilitate systematic evaluation of the effect of pore size,4 degree of interpenetration,5 polarity,6 and the metal7 itself on the capacity and affinity for hydrogen, thereby affording us the understanding to design a practically useful hydrogen storage material. Of the two primary constituents of a MOM platform, the organic ligand imparts diversity in scale and, through hydrogen bonding or polarization, can control molecular recognition.8 Such ligands should ideally be expandable and, since they would ultimately be required on an industrial scale, should be facile to prepare or should be commercially available as bulk chemicals.9 Itistherefore unsurprising thatbipyridines,10polycarboxylates,11 and mixed pyridine/carboxylato12 ligands such as nicotinates12 represent the prototypal ligands for MOMs and continue to attract considerable attention. In this contribution we address a new thermally robust ligand that is in effect an expanded version of nicotinate and demonstrate that it can be prepared without solvent via cocrystal-controlled solid-state synthesis (C3S3).13 Trimellitic nicotinic acid (HTriNA) was synthesized by grind- ing equimolar amounts of trimellitic anhydride and 4-aminopyr- idine in a mortar and pestle and heating at 265 C for 4 h (Scheme 1). Yields of ca. 90% for 10 mmol scale reactions are typically achieved, with the apparent loss coming from either sublimation or evaporation during the reaction, as shown by TGA (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). The reaction occurs via a new phase that is generated at 117 C according to DSC and PXRD experiments (Figures S2 and S3 of the Support- ing Information). HTriNA is thermally stable to ∼350 C and crystallizes from DMF in the noncentrosymmetric space group Pc. The X-ray crystal structure reveals that the pyridyl moiety is rotated ∼39.4 with respect to the imide plane, presumably because of repulsion between pyridyl C;H and imide CdO moieties.14 HTriNA forms parallel head-to-tail chains via hydro- gen bonds between carboxylic acid and pyridyl moieties on adjacent molecules (OH3 3 3 N = 2.648(6) A˚ , Figure 1). Crystals of HTriNA were analyzed for nonlinear optic properties using a powder technique modified from that of Kurtz et al.15 Irradiation at 1064 nm from a Nd:YAG laser onto the powderized sample of HTriNA showed second harmonic generation comparable with that of urea when perfomed under similar conditions (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information). HTriNA reacts with Cd(NO3)2 3 6H2O in DMF/MeOH under solvothermal conditions to afford single crystals of {Cd(Tri- NA)2(guest)x}n (1) large enough for single-crystal X-ray diffr- action.16 1 is composed of a dinuclear secondary building unit (SBU) in which each metal coordination sphere is pseudo- octahedral via three carboxylate ligands, two bridging (Cd3 3 3 O 2.290(4) A˚ , 2.370(5) A˚ ), one chelating (Cd3 3 3 O 2.390(4) A˚ , 2.396(4) A˚ ), and two axial pyridyl moieties (Cd3 3 3 N 2.274(5) A˚ , 2.304(5) A˚ ).The SBUisconnectedtoadjacentSBUsbyTriNA ligands to generate a bcu-net similar to that in Cd(nicotinate)2.12a The expanded distance between the carboxylate and pyridyl moieties of TriNA compared with the case of nicotinate generates channels along the a-axis (Figure 2). The approximately 9.4 A˚ by 9.4 A˚ (van der Waals considered) square channels are lined by the TriNA’s two aromatic moieties in a centrosymmetric manner. The pyridyl group is rotated 38.11 with respect to the imide plane, slightly less than that seen in HTriNA. The channels in 1 contain DMF and disordered nitrobenzene molecules. That the bimetallic SBU in 1 exists with additional metals in the Cam- bridge Structural Database prompted us to study isostructural analogues of M(TriNA)2 (M: 2, Cu; 3, Ni; 4, Co), which were prepared using similar reaction conditions.16 Whereas single crystals of 2-4 large enough for single-crystal X-ray crystallo- graphy were not obtained, the bulk samples were determined to be isostructural with 1 by PXRD (Figure 3). The structure of 1 contains 38% void space if guest molecules were removed (PLATON17). To evaluate the sorption properties of 1-4, microcrystalline as prepared samples were exchanged with dichloromethane and loaded onto a Quantachrome Scheme 1. Synthesis of HTriNA (I) Figure 1. HTriNA forms carboxylic acid/pyridyl supramolecular synthons with adjacent molecules (OH 3 3 3 N = 2.648(6) A˚ ). 5022 Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 9, No. 12, 2009 Perman et al. Autosorb-1 apparatus. 1 was outgassed at 50 C for 12 h, while 2-4 required room temperature for activation. Argon isotherms of 1-4 resemble a type-VI or stepped isotherm which is rare in MOMs (Figure S5 of the Supporting Information).18 The esti- mated surface area was determined by applying the BET method from the Ar isotherms and modeled using a program for calculat- ing the accessible surface area for nonorthorhombic unit cells.19 The kinetic diameter for Ar was set to 3.408 A˚ , and general agreement between 1 and 3 was achieved although 4 exhibited a higher surface area than that calculated (Table 1).19 The total pore volume determined using a Connolly radius of 1.82 A˚ was in agreement with the experimental values for 1-3 determined using the DR method from the first knee in the Ar isotherm. 4 deviated from the calculated pore size and can be attributed to the experimentally higher surface area. Hydrogen sorption for 1-4 was measured at 77 and 87 K up to atmospheric pressure (Figure 4), with the H2 wt % in decreasing order 4 > 3 > 1 > 2 at 77 K and 4 > 3 > 2 > 1 at 87 K. The hydrogen sorption isotherms for 1-4 are fully reversible with isosteric heats of sorption averaged at 6.62 kJ/mol at low loading decreasing to 5.55 kJ/mol at higher loading (Figure 4 and Table 2, and Figure S6 of the Supporting Information). These values are far from the 2010 DOE target for onboard hydrogen storage, but it should be noted that the MOMs with the lighter metals (Co, Ni) both have higher H2 wt % and slightly higher heats of adsorption. The studied MOMs maintain crystallinity after the performed sorption experiments, as proven by no observed changes in the powder pattern. In summary, cocrystal controlled solid-state synthesis has afforded a high yield, green route to HTriNA, a novel, thermally stable imide that is in effect an expanded analogue of nicotinic acid. TriNA is shown to be suitable for generating a series of isostructural porous metal-organic materials which were studied in the context of their hydrogen sorption properties. Further studies on expanded and functionalized TriNA analogues with different metals and ancillary ligands are underway. Acknowledgment.
