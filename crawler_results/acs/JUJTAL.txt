ABSTRACT: A new series of coordination polymer namely; CP2 [{(H2O)Co1.5(µ-3-bpna)1.5(µ-btc)}·3DMF·3H2O]α, CP3 [{Cd(µ- 3-bpna)(µ-hbtc)}·CH3OH·2H2O]α, CP4 [{Co(µ-3-bpna)(µ-ipa)}·DMF·2H2O]α, CP5 [{Co(µ-3-bpna)(µ-1,3-pda)}·DMF]α, CP6 [Cd(µ-3-bpna)0.5(µ-1,3-pda)]α, CP7 [(H2O)Co0.5(µ-3-bpna)0.5(µ-1,4-pda)0.5]α and CP8 [{Zn(µ-3-bpna)(µ-oba)}·DMF·2H2O]α has been synthesized by reacting a hydrogen bond functionalized bis-pyridyl ligand namely N’,N’’-di(pyridin-3-yl)naphthalene-2,6- dicarboxamide with various transition metal salts and different di- or tri-carboxylates (as co-ligand) displaying 2D and 3D network topology having lattice occluded solvents in the majority of the cases. A 1D coordination polymer namely CP1 [{Ag0.5(µ-3- bpna)}0.5·0.5BF4·CH3CN]α has also been isolated by reacting 3-bpna with AgBF4 in absence of any carboxylate co-ligand. All the CPs were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Interestingly, two such CPs namely CP1 and CP2 produced metallogels, which were characterized by rheology, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction. The metallogel of CP1 produced Ag nanoparticle within the gel-bed upon exposure to light. Introduction Coordination polymers (CPs) are an important class of metal- organic hybrid compounds that are formed spontaneously when multidentate organic linker(s) (ligand) is allowed to re- act with an appropriate metal salt(s).1–4 The field really took off when Robson et al. reported a CuII diamondoid network derived from three dimensionally linked rod-like segments, namely 4,4′,4′′,4′′′- tetracyanotetraphenyl methane.5 CPs are usually highly crystalline compounds enabling detailed struc- tural characterization at the atomic level by single crystal X- ray diffraction (SXRD). Such sub-molecular level structural information led the researchers to design wide varieties of CPs with potential applications such as in gas storage,6,7 anion8–10 and cation11 separation, catalysis,12–14 magnetic materials,15 drug delivery,16,17 sensors,18 opto-electronics,19,20 etc. As a part of our ongoing research program on CPs,3 we are interested in developing CPs having intriguing structures and functions such as in situ anion and cation separation,11 metal- logelation,21 metal-nanoparticle synthesis and catalysis22 etc. For this purpose, we have been focusing on pyridyl or carbox- ylate based multidentate ligands equipped with hydrogen bonding capable backbone such as amide or urea functionality. Among the various potential applications CPs offer, metallo- gelation23–29 is extremely important to study because of their potential applications in catalysis,30,31 sensing,18,32,33 photo- physics,34,35 synthesis of nanomaterials,27,36–38 magnetic mate- rials,39,40 and so forth. Gel is a soft material displaying both the properties of solid and liquid. It is usually formed by the im- mobilization of the liquid (gelling solvent) within the gel net- work that is formed either by purely noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, van der Waals interactions etc.) or by polymerization via covalent bond formation.41,42 When metal ion is a part of the gel network, the resulting gel is called metallogel.23 Supramolecular gel containing metal na- noparticle is also called metallogel.43 Discrete coordination compounds,44–46 infinite CP,47 crossed-linked CPs48 – all have shown to be capable of immobilizing (gelling) solvent produc- ing metallogels. Designing CPs is a challenging task. There are several efforts by various groups to meet such a challenge; for example, in- troducing long alkyl chain (hydrophobic group) on coordina- tion complex,49 installing a well-known aromatic-linker- steroid (ALS) moiety (a well-known gel-forming moiety), on a metallocene,50 utilizing surface modifications with mixed lig- ands of different lengths,51 slowly crystallizing CPs with flexi- ble ligands,52 exploiting the well-studied supramolecular synthon53,54 etc. In an another approach, we55,56 and others57 have suggested that molecular solids having lattice occluded solvents were good candidate for gelation because of the struc- tural similarity present between gels and solvent occluded molecular solids – in both the cases, a large amount of sol- vents were occluded. With this background in mind, we set out to synthesize a new series of CPs that are expected to generate lattice occluded solids which, under suitable condition, might display metallo- gelation behavior. For this purpose, we synthesized a hitherto unexplored bis-pyridyl-bis-amide ligand namely N’,N’’- di(pyridin-3-yl)naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxamide (hereafter 3- bpna). We envisaged that the amide moieties and relatively large π-cloud of the central naphthyl ring would be of some Page 1 of 12 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 help in the self-assembly process of gelation via hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions, respectively. Moreover, the amide functionality is also expected to invite guest mole- cules as lattice occluded solvents which in turn might contrib- ute to metallogelation behavior of the resulting CPs. A series of crystalline CPs was indeed isolated when 3-bpna was re- acted with various metal salts and different bis- or tris- carboxylate co-ligands (Scheme 1). Experimental Section Materials and Methods: All chemicals were commercially available and used without further purification. The elemental analyses were carried out using a PerkinElmer 2400 Series II CHN analyzer. FT-IR spectra were recorded using Perki- nElmer Spectrum GX. The mass spectra were recorded on Q- TOF Micro YA 263 mass spectrometer. NMR spectra (1H and 13C) were recorded using a 300 MHz Bruker Avance DPX 200 spectrometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were ob- tained from solid films prepared by drop casting an aqueous suspension of the 3-bpna and CPs on quartz plates using a Nanolog spectrofluorometer from HORIBA Jobin Yvon. Synthesis of the ligand 3-bpna To a solution of 2,6-napthalenedicarboxylic acid (500 mg, 2.3 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (DCM), 2 ml of oxalyl chloride and 4 drops of DMF was added and kept stirring with a gut tube for 12 hours to yield a yellow suspension which was dried under vacuum. The dried powder was stirred in toluene for two hours and the sticky mass of oxalyl chloride was re- moved by decanting the toluene solution which was further evaporated to isolate the pure acid chloride, as a dried mass (600 mg, 2.37 mmol, yield: 70%). To a solution of the acid chloride (550 mg, 2.1 mmol) and 1 ml of triethylamine in dry DCM, 3-amino pyridine (395 mg, 4.2 mmol) in dry THF was added drop wise. The thick white coloured precipitate thus formed, was kept stirring with reflux- ing for 12 hours. After filtration, the precipitate was washed with DCM-THF mixture properly; air dried, and treated with 5% NaHCO3 solution and washed with distilled water, dried and recrystallized from DMSO (yield: 650 mg, 70%).

Metallogelation: In a typical gelation experiment for CP1, 3- bpna (22 mg, 0.06 mmol) was dissolved in 0.4 ml hot DMF to get a clear solution, and mixed with 0.6 ml aqueous solution of AgBF4 (11.7 mg, 0.06 mmol) at room temperature; so that the metal:ligand molar ratio was 1:1 and the resulting DMF or DMSO/water ratio was 2:3 v/v. The gel formed almost instan- taneously. Gel formation was confirmed by the test tube inver- sion method. In a typical gelation experiment for CP2, 3-bpna (17 mg, 0.046 mmol) was dissolved in 0.4 ml hot DMF to get a clear solution and btc (9.7 mg, 0.046mmol) was added; this solution was mixed with 0.6 ml aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (13.4 mg, 0.046 mmol) at room temperature so that the metal:3-bpna:btc, molar ratio was 1:1:1 and the resulting DMF or DMSO/water ratio was 2:3 v/v. The gel formed almost instantaneously. Gel formation was confirmed by test tube inversion method. Transmission electron microscopy: TEM micrographs were recorded using a JEOL JEM-2011 instrument operating at 200 keV. Sample preparation involved drop casting a suspension of gel in water onto a 300 mesh carbon film supported by a copper grid, which was then dried in air. Rheology Studies: The rheological response of both the metal- logels was studied under dynamic and steady shear measure- ment at room temperature (25 °C) on parallel-plate geometry (25 mm diameter, 1 mm gap). Rheological experiments were carried out using Anton Paar Modular Compact Rheometer (MCR 102). Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction Analysis: Suitable, apparently single crystals of 3-bpna and CP1 – CP8 were selected. Data collection was carried out on a Bruker SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer using graphite monochromated Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation. Data reduction and unit cell refinement were performed using SAINT-Plus.58 The structures were solved by direct method and refinement procedure by full- matrix least-squares method, based on F2 values against all reflections was performed by SHELXL-2014/7.59 Powder X-ray diffraction: Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray (Cu Kα1 radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å) diffractometer in the 5–35° 2θ range using a 0.02° step size per second. The sample was prepared by making a thin film from the finely powdered sample (~30 mg) over a glass slide. Results and Discussion The acylamide ligand 3-bpna was synthesized by reacting 2,6- naphthalenedicarbonyl dichloride with 3-aminopyridine in a dichloromethane (DCM)–THF mixture under refluxing condi- tions. Blocked shape crystals of 3-bpna were grown by slow evaporation form a DMSO solution. CP1 was crystalized by layering a CH3CN solution of AgBF4 to a DMSO solution containing 3-bpna at room temperature for 3 weeks to afford x-ray quality blocked shape crystals. Crystals for CP2-CP8 were obtained by solvothermal reaction in a DMF-methanol- water solution (3:1:1).We have reacted 3-bpna (in separate experiments) with various polycarboxylates and several metal salts [AgBF4, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O] in a 1 : 1 : 1 (metal : 3-bpna : polycarbox- ylate) molar ratio to generate CPs CP2-CP8. Crystallographic data, bond length and bond angles, and hydrogen bonding parameters for all the crystals were listed in tables 1, S1 and S2, respectively. Crystal structure of N',N''-bis(3-pyridyl)naphthalene-2,6- dicarboxamide (3-bpna) Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 3-bpna crystallizes in the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group P21/n. The asymmetric unit contains half of 3-bpna as the free ligand is located on a center of inversion. Both the amide groups of 3-bpna are in anti-periplanar conformation. The molecule is significantly nonplanar as evident from the dihe- dral angle of 13.2° involving the terminal pyridyl rings and the Page 3 of 12 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 Table 1.

The N atoms of the terminal pyridyl rings are disposed in trans conformation. In the crystal struc- ture, the amide functionality is involved in hydrogen bonding via N-H···N interactions with the pyridyl N atoms of the neighboring molecules resulting in a herringbone packing when viewed down c-axis (Fig. 1) Figure 1. Crystal structure illustration of 3-bpna; (a) ORTEP plot (30% probability level); (b) herringbone arrangement due to N– H···N hydrogen bonding interactions, viewing down c-axis. Crystal structure of [{Ag0.5(µ-3-bpna)}0.5·0.5BF4·CH3CN]α (CP1) The crystal of CP1 belongs to the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group C2/c. The asymmetric unit consists of half of AgI located on an inversion center, half of 3-bpna molecule whose central naphthyl ring resides on an inversion center, half of BF4‾ anion (located on a 2-fold), and a fully occupied CH3CN molecule. The angle between the planes of terminal pyridyl moieties and the central naphthyl spacer is 5.82° indicating that 3-bpna ligand is reasonably planar. The metal center AgI displays a linear coordination geometry wherein the coordinat- ing sites are occupied by the pyridyl N atoms of 3-bpna form- ing 1D CPic chain propagating approximately along the diag- onal of ab plane. One of the fluorine atoms (F2) of BF4‾ anion is disordered and modelled over two positions. The >C=O of amide functionality is not involved in any intermolecular hy- drogen bonding interaction. However, the N–H of the amide is involved in hydrogen bonding with the BF4‾ anion that bridg- es adjacent 1D polymeric chains skewed at 52.8°, and such packing of the 1D chains results in void space occupied by the lattice occluded solvent molecule CH3CN stabilized by weak C–H···N hydrogen bond (table S2). In addition, the 3-bpna also experience π···π interactions, with interplanar distances of 3.611 Å between the pyridine and naphthyl rings (Fig. 2). Figure 2. Crystal structure illustration of CP1; (a) ORTEP plot (30% probability level); (b) packing of 1D-chains viewed down a- axis (CH3CN is shown in ball and stick model in pink, AgI – green ball). Crystal structure of [{(H2O)Co1.5(µ-3-bpna)1.5(µ- btc)}·3DMF·3H2O]α (CP2) The CP CP2 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic space group P-1. The asymmetric unit consists of two CoII metal centers (one fully occupied and the other half occupied as it sits on a center of inversion), one btc, two 3-bpna ligands (one fully occupied and the other half occupied as the central naph- thyl moiety sits on an inversion center), one coordinated aqua ligand, three lattice occluded DMF molecules and three solv- ate water molecules. The ligand 3-bpna is found to be signifi- cantly nonplanar as evident from the dihedral angles (50.8° and 58.9°) involving the terminal pyridyl rings and the central naphthyl moiety. Both the metal centers display octahedral geometry; while the fully occupied CoII center displays slight- ly distorted octahedral geometry, the other one show a perfect octahedral geometry owing to its special position (center of inversion). The axial sites were coordinated by the pyridyl N atoms of the ligand 3-bpna, the equatorial positions are occu- pied by O atoms of the carboxylate and water molecules. The tricarboxylate co-ligand namely btc coordinates through its carboxylate O atoms to CoII metal centers resulting in a 2D sheets propagating parallel to ac-plane. The 2D sheets are further threaded by the 3-bpna ligands via pyridyl N–Co co- ordination resulting in an overall 3D network. The void space with the 3D network are occupied by the solvate DMF and water molecules sustained by various hydrogen bonding of the type N–H···O and O–H···O. Topological analysis60 reveals that the network present in CP2 is a 3,4,6-connected net also known as sqc130 topology (Fig. 3). A similar 3,4,6-connected topology based on cadmium phenylenediacetate isonicotinate CP has been reported recently.61 Page 5 of 12 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 Figure 3.

Crystal structure of [{Cd(µ-3-bpna)(µ-hbtc)}·CH3OH·2H2O]α (CP3) The CP CP3 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic space group P-1. The asymmetric unit consists of one CdII, one hbtc2–, one 3-bpna, two lattice occluded water molecules and one methanol. The ligand 3-bpna is found be nearly planar as evident from the dihedral angles involving the pyridyl moie- ties and the central naphthyl ring (12.45° and 17.82°). The CdII metal center displays distorted octahedral geometry wherein the equatorial positions are occupied by the carboxylate O atoms and the axial sites are coordinated by the pyridyl N at- oms. The monoprotonated Hbtc is found to coordinate to the adjacent CdII metal centers resulting a 1D looped chain; such chains are further bridged by the bis-pyridyl ligand 3-bpna resulting in an overall 2D coordination network. The 2D sheets are packed in parallel fashion further sustained by inter- sheet N–H···O interactions involving the amide N–H and >C=O of the COOH moiety of Hbtc and π···π stacking (3.793- 3.922 Å, between the pyridyl···pyridyl, naphthyl···naphthyl and naphthyl···pyridyl rings). The solvate CH3OH is found be hydrogen bonded with amide N–H and carboxylate via N– H···O and O–H···O interactions, respectively. Two solvate water molecules are hydrogen bonded with each other via O– H···O interactions; one of the water molecules further forms hydrogen bond with amide carbonyl and COOH of Hbtc. The overall network may best described as 4-connected uninodal framework as suggested by topological analysis60 (Fig. 4). Figure 4.

Crystal structure of [{Co(µ-3-bpna)(µ-ipa)}·DMF·2H2O]α (CP4) The CP CP4 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic space group P-1. The asymmetric unit consists of one CoII, one isophthalate (ipa), one 3-bpna, two lattice occluded water molecules and one unligated DMF. The ligand 3-bpna is found to be significantly nonplanar as evident from the dihe- dral angles (39.7° and 44.8°) involving the terminal pyridyl rings and the central naphthyl moiety. The CoII metal center displays distorted octahedral geometry wherein the equatorial positions are occupied by the carboxylate O atoms and the axial sites are coordinated by the pyridyl N atoms.

The fully deprotonated ipa is found to coordinate to the adja- cent CoII metal centers resulting a 1D looped chain; such Page 6 of 12 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 chains are further bridged by the bis-pyridyl ligand 3-bpna resulting in an overall 2D coordination network. The 2D sheets are packed in parallel fashion resulting in voids that were occupied by the solvate water and DMF molecules sus- tained N–H···O interactions involving the amide N–H. The overall network may best described as 4-connected uninodal framework as suggested by topological analysis60 (Fig. 5). Crystal structural of [{Co(µ-3-bpna)(µ-1,3-pda)}·DMF]α (CP5) The CP CP5 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group P21/n. The asymmetric unit consists of a CoII, one 1,3-pda, one 3-bpna molecule and one occluded DMF mole- cule. The ligand 3-bpna is found to be significantly deviated from planarity as evident from the dihedral angles involving the pyridyl moieties and the central naphthyl ring (3.6° and 20.8°). The CoII metal center displays distorted octahedral geometry wherein the equatorial positions are occupied by the carboxylate O atoms and the axial sites are coordinated by the pyridyl N atoms. Remarkably, the dicarboxylate 1,3-pda lig- and adopts cis conformations rather than a much more stable and usually observed trans conformation;63,64 1,3-pda displays an tridentate bridging mode with one carboxylate chelating (µ1-η1:η1) to one CoII, whilst the other carboxylate bridges two CoII atoms with each oxygen atom acting as a monodentate donor (µ2-η1:η1). Such coordination mode results in a 1D looped chain topology that are further bridged by the bis- pyridyl ligand 3-bpna producing an overall 2D coordination network. The 2D sheets are packed in parallel fashion. The interstitial space is occupied by the solvate DMF sustained N– H···O and C–H···π (Cg···H–C=2.787 Å) interactions involv- ing the amide N–H and DMF >C=O, and DMF methyl and the aromatic moiety of 1,3-pda, respectively. The overall network may best be described as 4-connected uninodal framework as suggested by topological analysis60 (Fig. 6). Figure 6.

Crystal structural of [Cd(µ-3-bpna)0.5(µ-1,3-pda)]α (CP6) The CP CP6 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group P21/n. The asymmetric unit consists of a CdII, one 1,3-pda moiety and half of 3-bpna molecule (located on an inversion center). The ligand 3-bpna is found be nonplanar as evident from the dihedral angles involving the pyridyl moie- ties and the central naphthyl ring (20.9°). The CdII metal cen- ter displays distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry where- in the equatorial positions are occupied by the carboxylate O atoms and the axial sites are coordinated by the pyridyl N at- om and one of the carboxylate O atoms. 1,3-pda displays the usually observed trans conformation (contrary to that observed in CP5) and is involved trans-tetradentate bridging mode with one acetate arm chelating (µ1-η1:η1) to one CdII center, whilst the other arm chelates as well as bridges (µ3-η2:η2) three CdII metal centers resulting in 2D network. The bis-pyridyl ligand 3-bpna is found to bridge the 2D sheets packed in parallel fashion resulting in an overall 3D network. The amide N–H is found to be involved in hydrogen bonding with the carbox- ylate O via N–H···O interactions. The overall network may best be described as 5-connected uninodal new topology as suggested by topological analysis60 (Fig. 7). Figure 7.

Crystal structure of [(H2O)Co0.5(µ-3-bpna)0.5(µ-1,4-pda)0.5]α (CP7) The CP CP7 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic space group P-1. The asymmetric unit consists of half of CoII, half of a 1,4-pda and half of a 3-bpna ligand – all reside on inversion center, and a fully occupied aqua ligand. The ligand 3-bpna is found to be almost planar as evident from the dihedral angles involving the pyridyl moieties and the central naphthyl ring 3.7°). The CoII metal center displays a perfect octahedral ge- ometry owing to its special position (center of inversion) wherein the equatorial positions are occupied by the carbox- ylate O atoms and coordinated water molecules, and the axial sites are coordinated by the pyridyl N atoms. 1,4-pda ligand bridges CoII atoms in trans coordination fashion to form a 1D chain which further tethered by 3-bpna ligands to form 2D corrugated (4,4) rhomboid network. Parallel corrugated 2D sheets64 stack in an interdigitating fashion sustained inter-sheet N–H···O interactions involving the amide N–H and carbox- ylate O and O–H···O interactions involving the metal bound water and carboxylate. The overall network may best be de- scribed as 4-connected uninodal network as suggested by topological analysis60 (Fig. 8).

Crystal structure of [{Zn(µ-3-bpna)(µ-oba)}·DMF·2H2O]α (CP8) The CP CP8 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1. The asymmetric unit consists of a ZnII, one 4,4′-oxybis-benzoate (oba), one 3-bpna, two lattice occluded water molecules and one DMF molecule. The ligand 3-bpna is found be nonplanar as evident from the dihedral angles involving the pyridyl moi- eties and the central naphthyl ring (61.57° and 35.57°). The ZnII metal center displays square pyramidal coordination ge- ometry coordinated by carboxylate O atoms and the pyridyl N atoms. The flexible oba ligand bridges neighboring ZnII metal center resulting in 1D chain which are further threaded by the bispyridyl ligand 3-bpna producing a corrugated 2D sheet. The adjacent sheets are intercalated into three-dimensional layered architecture through strong aromatic π···π stacking interactions between 3-bpna ligands (Cg···Cg = 3.447 Å). Interestingly the adjacent 2D sheets are arranged in ABAB·· fashion. The interstitial space within the network is occupied by the solvate water and DMF molecules sustained by hydro- gen bonding interactions; while the water molecule is involved in hydrogen bonding with the amide N–H, the DMF takes part in hydrogen bonding interactions with the water. The overall network may best described as uninodal 4-connected network as suggested by topological analysis60 (Fig. 9). Figure 9.

The foregoing structural description of the free ligand and all the CPs reveals the following (Table 2): The bispyridyl ligand displays trans ligating topology with respect to the terminal pyridyl moieties in all the crystal structures of the CPs as well as the free ligand (Figure S1). The amide functionality is found to be anti-periplanar in all structures except for CP6 and CP8 (syn-periplanar). In most of the cases, the dihedral angle involving the terminal pyridyl rings and the central naphthyl moiety indicates significant non-planarity of the ligand 3- bpna. In the mixed ligand CPs, the carboxylate co-ligands display various coordination modes that include bidentate, tridentate and tetradentate depending on how the carboxylate O takes part in coordination. Except for CP6, the metal centers displays perfect to distorted octahedral geometry wherein the equatorial positions are mostly occupied the carboxylate O atoms. Threading by the pyridyl N atoms of 3-bpna ligand to the axial sites of the octahedral metal center leads mainly to 2D coordination architecture except in CP2 and CP6; these two CPs display 3D coordination network. The most important feature of the CPs reported herein, as envisaged, is that majori- ty of them occluded solvent in their crystal lattice; only CP6 and CP7 did not occlude any solvent in the crystal structures. It may be mentioned here naphthyl based bis-pyridyl-bis- amide ligands having similar structural features to 3-bpna also produced lattice occluded coordination polymers in mixed ligand systems.65,66 Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns are provided in the supplementary material for 3-bpna and CP1-CP8 (Figure S2). Except CP1, in all the cases, the experimental patterns agree well with the simulated patterns indicating the phase purity of the bulk material. The experimental PXRD pattern of CP1 does exhibit a few ‘extra’ peaks, which may indicate the pres- ence of a small crystalline impurity. The lattice occluded sol- vent content in the single crystal structures of all the CPs was further verified by TGA (Figure S3-S10, supporting infor- mation). Since the ligand 3-bpna contained a naphthalene moiety which is a known fluorophore,67 we studied the photophysical properties of the free ligand 3-bpna and a few selected CPs namely CP2, CP5 and CP3 in the solid state. The bis-pyridyl- bis-amide ligand 3-bpna, displays a broad emission band cen- tered around ca. 415 nm (excitation wavelength, λex=330 nm), which can be ascribed to the intra-ligand or ligand-ligand π-π* or n-π* transitions. The emission spectrum of CP3 (excitation wavelength, (λex=300 nm) also appeared to be of similar fea- ture as that of the free ligand displaying a broad emission band centered around ca. 435 nm. Since the photoluminescent d10 metal center CdII is quite far away (ca. 10 Å) from the fluoro- phore core of 3-bpna in the crystal structure of CP3, it under- standably did not affect the overall fluorescence. On the other hand, the emission spectra of CP2 and CP5 (excitation wave- length, (λex=300 nm) appeared to have sharp characteristic displaying a peak centered around ca. 380 nm with satellite peaks at ca. 370 and 400 nm. It is clear that in these cases, the d7 metal center CoII was unable to quench the luminescence68 because of its far away distance (ca. 10 Å) from the naphthyl moiety in the respective crystal structures of the CPs (Fig. S11, supporting information).

Before that, we scanned the ligand 3-bpna for gelation as the amide functionality is reported to be gel pro- ducing moiety. However, 3-bpna turned out to be a non- gelator when scanned with various solvents (both polar and nonpolar). Metallogelation scanning revealed that the reactants of majority of the CPs failed to produce metallogels with the target solvent system DMF/water. Only the reactants of CP1 and CP2 did produce metallogels with DMF/water. The mini- mum gelator concentrations (MGCs) were found to be 3.4 and 4.0 % for CP1 and CP2, respectively considering all the reac- tants. In a typical experiment, DMF solution of the ligand(s) was mixed with aqueous solution of the metal salt at room temperature so that the metal:ligand molar ratio was 1:1 and the resulting DMF/water ratio was 2:3 v/v. The gel was formed almost instantaneously, which was visually confirmed by the tube inversion test. The visco-elastic nature of the gels was further confirmed by rheology. The amplitude sweep experiments wherein elastic modulus (G') and viscous modulus (G'') were plotted against the strain applied, suggested that a strain of 0.1% was appro- priate for the frequency sweep experiments. Both CP1 and CP2 metallogels displayed expected behavior for visco-elastic materials like gels; in both the cases, G' was greater than G'' throughout the frequency range specially, in the longer time scale – typical of visco-elastic materials like gels. The morphology of the gel fibers was studied by transition electron microscopy (TEM). The dried gels prepared by drop casting a suspension of gel in water on a TEM grid revealed the existence of highly entangled network of 1D tape type fibers. Understandably these fibers formed by the spontaneous self-assembly involving the organic linkers and the metal cen- ters were capable of immobilizing the solvent molecules re- sulting in the metallogels. Since AgI is prone to photochemical reduction to produce Ag0 nanoparticle (hereafter AgNP) under suitable conditions, the gel obtained from the reactant of CP1 was exposed to sunlight for a day. It was observed that the color of the gel turned brown from white indicating AgNP formation. The tiny parti- cles (3-10 nm) seen in the TEM image of the dried gel of CP1 presumably were the AgNPs. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) performed on the TEM machine revealed that these particles were crystalline as they produced well-ordered dif- fraction spots. Existence of AgNPs was finally confirmed by the surface plasmon resonance peak at ~470 nm in the UV-vis spectrum of the suspended xerogel of CP1 in DMSO. For- mation of metal nanoparticle including AgNPs within gel bed has earlier been reported by us22 and others.38 Attempt to gain insights into the gel network structure by powder X-ray diffraction studies was not successful because both the concerned CPs (CP1 and CP2) were lattice occluded molecular solids which were susceptible towards desolvation leading to change and/or collapse of the crystal lattice. Moreo- ver, in the case CP1, Ag nanoparticles were formed which Page 9 of 12 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 meant partial degradation of the coordination network leading to different PXRD patterns (Fig. S12).

Conclusion A new, hitherto unexplored, flexible ligand equipped with hydrogen bonding functionality (amide) namely 3-bpna was explored to get an access to a new series of coordination pol- ymers by reacting it with various metal salts and carboxylate co-ligands. As envisaged, majority of the coordination poly- mers turned out to be lattice occluded molecular solids; vari- ous hydrogen bonding capable solvent molecules (DMF/water/MeOH/MeCN) were found to be occluded within the interstitial space of the coordination networks sustained by hydrogen bonding with the amide functionality and/or metal bound water molecules. Contrary to our expectation, the reac- tants of the CPs in majority of the cases failed to produce metallogel with DMF/water or DMSO/water; only in the cases of CP1 and CP2, the expected metallogels were formed. Ulti- mately a gel is formed only when the gel network is able to immobilize the target solvent via capillary force action or sur- face tension that solely depends on the surface compatibility between the gel network and the solvent molecules. Thus, a gel network characteristics present in the structure of the gela- tor molecule does not necessarily ensure gelation. The reason for other CPs (CP3-CP8) being nongelator must be because of the surface incompatibility of network structure and the target solvent molecules. These results clearly indicate that much understanding is still needed in the molecular level in order to be able to design metallogelators a priori. Nevertheless, the logical approach adopted herein to gain access to metallogels was worthwhile.

Displaying the various conformations of 3-bpna in CP1-CP8. Figure S2. PXRD patterns of 3-bpna and CP1-CP8 compared with their respective calculated patterns. Thermal analysis The thermogravimetric data of CP1-CP8 indicates two mass losses (Figure S2) in almost all the cases. The calculated weight loss for CP1 expected to be 12.72% within the temperature range of 50–150 °C which doesn’t match with experimental weight loss of 5.96%. This is probably due to immediate solvent loss during transfer of crystal to the TGA pan. The weight loss of 24.22% in temperature range 40–200 °C for CP2 corresponds to the loss of three DMF and four water molecules (calculated weight loss 23.96%). The weight loss of 8.78% in temperature range 50–150 °C for CP3 corresponds to the loss of one methanol and two water molecules (calculated weight loss 8.98%). The weight loss of 15.57% in temperature range 40– 130 °C for CP4 corresponds to the loss of one DMF and two water molecules (calculated weight loss 15.71%). The weight loss of 10.76% in temperature range 50–150 °C for CP5 corresponds to the loss of one DMF molecule (calculated weight loss 10.55%). Since, CP6 doesn’t possess any solvent molecule in crystal lattice, thermogravimetric data of CP6 indicates two mass losses at higher temperature regions, 230–260 °C (11.79%) and 350–550 °C (73.94%) corresponding to the structural decomposition. The weight loss of 5.56% in a broad temperature range 50–250 °C for CP7 corresponds to the loss of coordinated water molecules (calculated weight loss 5.5%). The weight loss of 13.64% in a temperature range 50–150 °C for CP8 corresponds to the loss of one DMF and two water molecules (calculated weight loss 13.35%). A long range mass loss in the higher temperature range 250–450 °C corresponds to the structural decomposition for almost all the cases.

Often the minor alerts point to easily fixed oversights, errors and omissions in your CIF or refinement strategy, so attention to these fine details can be worthwhile. In order to resolve some of the more serious problems it may be necessary to carry out additional measurements or structure refinements. However, the purpose of your study may justify the reported deviations and the more serious of these should normally be commented upon in the discussion or experimental section of a paper or in the "special_details" fields of the CIF. checkCIF was carefully designed to identify outliers and unusual parameters, but every test has its limitations and alerts that are not important in a particular case may appear. Conversely, the absence of alerts does not guarantee there are no aspects of the results needing attention. It is up to the individual to critically assess their own results and, if necessary, seek expert advice. Publication of your CIF in IUCr journals A basic structural check has been run on your CIF. These basic checks will be run on all CIFs submitted for publication in IUCr journals (Acta Crystallographica, Journal of Applied Crystallography, Journal of Synchrotron Radiation); however, if you intend to submit to Acta Crystallographica Section C or E, you should make sure that full publication checks are run on the final version of your CIF prior to submission. Publication of your CIF in other journals Please refer to the Notes for Authors of the relevant journal for any special instructions relating to CIF submission.
