The results revealed that, in complexes 1 and 2, the carboxylate groups of the bta3- ligand adopted varied coordination modes to link metal atoms and further to form three-dimensional structures with open channels occupied by water molecules, while in complex 3, for the first time, the flexible H3bta acted as a secondary building unit to generate a novel nanometer-sized metallocage, which is composed of a CuII paddle wheel (square secondary building units) and bta3-/Hbta2- organic links (triangular secondary building units). The photoluminescence properties of complexes 1 and 2 were investigated, and the results showed that 2 exhibited photoluminescence in the solid state at room temperature. Introduction Metal-organic architectures with large cavities have evoked wide attention because of their structural diversity and potential applications in many fields.1 Recently, Kita- gawa and co-workers reported methane gas adsorption and hydrogen storage properties of porous frameworks.2 On the other hand, Yaghi and some other groups have succeeded in obtaining multidimensional porous frameworks by using a 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (btc; Chart 1) ligand and various metal salts.3,4 Because of the diversity of the binding modes of the carboxylate group with metal atoms, novel and fantastic frameworks can be achieved by reactions of carboxylate-containing ligands with various metal salts. Up to now, extensive works have been carried out by using carboxylate-containing ligands in addition to btc, for ex- ample, 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid (m-H2bdc), 1,4-ben- * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Metal-organic architectures assembled by metal salts with flexible carboxylate-containing ligands are not well done up to now, possibly because of the difficulties in predicting the structures of the resulting complexes.9 We report herein the synthesis, structural characterization, and luminescence properties of two novel three-dimensional (3D) complexes, [Ag3(bta)]‚1.5H2O (1) and [Cd3(bta)2(H2O)7]‚5H2O (2), and one nanometer-sized metallocage [Cu11(bta)6(Hbta)2(H2O)10]‚29H2O (3), where bta3- is a flexible tripodal ligand, benzene-1,3,5-triacetate, which can adopt at least two different conformations (Chart 1) upon coordination with metal atoms, while in the cases of rigid ligands, such as btc3-, btb3-, etc., there are no such great conformational changes. Experimental Section Materials and Measurements. All commercially available chemicals are of reagent grade and were used as received without further purification. Solvents were purified according to the standard methods. The compound H3bta was prepared according to the method reported in the literature.10 Elemental analyses of C and H were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer, at the Center of Materials Analysis, Nanjing University. Thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the powder sample was performed on a simultaneous SDT 2960 thermal analyzer under flowing N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min-1 from room temperature to 600 °C. The luminescent spectra for the solid samples were recorded at room temperature on an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectropho- tometer with a Xe arc lamp as the light source. In the measurements of emission and excitation spectra, the pass width is 5.0 nm. A SLM 48000 DSCF fluorescence spectrometer was used to perform the lifetime measurements.

The O24 atom in 2 has two positions with site occupation factors of 0.56(7) and 0.44(7), respectively. All data were refined anisotropically by the full-matrix least-squares method on F 2 for non-H atoms. The H atoms except for those of water molecules were generated geometrically. The crystal parameters, data collection, and refinement results for compounds 1-3 are summarized in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and angles with their estimated standard deviations are given in Table 2. Further details are provided in the Supporting Information. Results and Discussion Description of the Crystal Structures. 1. In complex 1, there are three crystallographically independent Ag atom centers in the structure, and each Ag atom has a different coordination environment (Figure 1a). Both Ag1 and Ag3 atoms are unusual five-coordinate with distorted square- pyramid geometry.13 The Ag1 atom is coordinated by three O atoms from three different bta ligands and two Ag atoms, while in the case of the Ag3 atom, it is bound by four O atoms from three different bta ligands and one C atom. The distance of 2.460(4) Å between Ag3 and C6 implies the existence of a Ag-C bond. Similar Ag-C bond distances ranging from 2.420(5) to 2.766(4) Å have been observed in AgI polymers with pyrene and perylene.14 The Ag2 atom is coordinated with three O atoms from three different ligands and one Ag atom with distorted square-planar coordination geometry. In turn, each bta3- ligand coordinates to nine AgI atoms, with three carboxylate groups adopting µ4-η2:η2- and µ2-η1:η1-bridging coordination modes (Figure 1b). As shown in Figure 2a, ligand bta3- coordinates to seven AgI atoms to form a one-dimensional (1D) chain, which includes 20-membered macrocyclic rings with dimensions of 6.6 × 8.4 Å. Also, there exists a bimetallic (Ag1 and Ag2) dicarboxylate unit, with a short Ag-Ag internuclear separation of 2.8453(5) Å. It is known that bimetallic tetracarboxylate units are a common arrangement for many transition-metal carboxylates such as Cu, Rh, Mo, etc.3,5,15 A tetranuclear AgI cluster bridged by carboxylate groups has (12) DIRDIF94: Beurskens, P.

Zhu et al. 3944 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 45, No. 10, 2006 been reported to have a Ag-Ag distance of 2.938(1) Å, which is longer than that observed in complex 1.15b The distance of two Ag atoms of two adjacent chains is 3.1429- (6) Å, which is shorter than the Ag-Ag van der Waals contact distance of 3.40 Å and indicates the presence of Ag- Ag interactions.16 Thus, the 1D chains were further linked by Ag-Ag interactions to give a two-dimensional (2D) network structure (Figure 2b), and the 20-membered mac- rocyclic rings with 4.0 × 11.7 Å dimensions were formed between two adjacent 1D chains. Furthermore, the 2D sheets were connected by Ag-O bonds to give a 3D framework with open channels (Figure 3), which were occupied by water molecules via C-H‚‚‚O hydrogen bonds (Table 3). There- fore, complex 1 is a novel metal-organic architecture constructed through Ag-O coordination and Ag-Ag and Ag-C interactions. 2. As shown in Figure 4, the bta3- ligands display two kinds of coordination modes in each repeat unit of 2. In mode I, the bta3- ligand connects four CdII atoms with the carboxylate group, adopting µ1-η1:η0-monodentate, µ1-η1:η1- chelating, and µ2-η1:η1-bridging coordination modes. In the case of mode II, the bta3- ligand connects four CdII atoms with two kinds of coordination modes: µ1-η1:η1 chelating and µ2-η1:η1 bridging. The asymmetric unit of 2 contains three CdII atoms with distorted octahedral coordination geometry (Figure 5a). Each Cd1 or Cd2 is coordinated by three O atoms of three water molecules and three O atoms of two carboxylate groups. In turn, each ligand bta3- coordinates to two Cd1 or two Cd2 atoms to form chains A and B (Figure 5b), while Cd3 is bound by one O atom of the water molecule, two O atoms of two carboxylate groups from two A chains, and three O atoms of two carboxylate groups from two B chains. That is to say, the Cd3 atom links A and B chains into a 3D structure with open channels in dimensions of 8.0 × 11.2 Å, which is occupied by water molecules by forming O-H‚‚‚O hydrogen bonds (Table 3, Figure 6, and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). It is noteworthy that the bta3- ligands in complexes 1 and 2 adopt a cis,trans,trans conformation and all of the three carboxylate groups of each bta participate in the coordination with metal atoms to generate the 3D frameworks. Four different coordination modes of the carboxylate groups are found in these two complexes, namely, µ4-η2:η2 bridging, µ2-η1:η1 bridging, µ1-η1:η1 chelating, and µ1-η1:η0 mono- dentate (Chart 2), in which µ4-η2:η2 bridging is an unusual coordination mode for the carboxylate group.17 (16) (a) Fei, B.

Single crystals of 3 were obtained by a diffusion method between an aqueous solution of H3bta and KHCO3 and an aqueous solution of Cu(ClO4)2‚6H2O at room temperature. In contrast to the mild conditions for the preparation of 3, the reported frameworks with a carboxylate ligand were usually obtained by thermal or solvothermal methods under high temperature and high pressure to increase the dimen- sionality of the resulting complexes.3,7 The result of crystal structural analysis of 3 indicates that there are 11 CuII atoms and 8 bta ligands in each cage of 3, as illustrated in Figure 7a. It is interesting that the CuII atoms in 3 have two different coordination environments: octahedral and square planar. In the repeat unit, Cu5 was found between Cu3 and Cu4 in the Fourier map and disordered carboxyl groups were found near these Cu atoms. Cu3 and Cu4 form a paddle-wheel cluster with an occupancy of 0.5, while Cu5 also with an occupancy of 0.5 is only four-coordinate, in which two of the four carboxylates must be protonated because no other cation was found in the crystal analysis of 3 even at 200 K. In the other reported metallocages, all of the metal atoms in each compound have the same coordination geometry.18 Thus, in each cage of 3, there are five, not six, paddle-wheel dimeric cupric tetracarboxylate units, with short Cu-Cu internuclear separations of 2.6361(9) (Cu1-Cu2) and 2.628- (2) (Cu3-Cu4) Å. Such bimetallic tetracarboxylate units have been observed in many transition-metal (e.g., Cu, Rh, Mo) carboxylate frameworks.3,5,15a The previously reported metallocage [Cu24(m-bdc)24(DMF)14(H2O)10](H2O)50(DMF)6- (C2H5OH)6 (where DMF ) dimethylformamide), obtained by the reaction of a 1,3-benzenedicarboxylate ligand, rather than a tricarboxylate one, with copper(II) nitrate, has 12 Cu2- (COO)4 paddle-wheel secondary building units.5 Therefore, the structure of 3 can be described as a near cuboctahedron composed of square (paddle wheels and planar) and trian- gular secondary building units (organic bta links), as il- lustrated in Figure 7b. It is noteworthy that only the cis,cis,cis conformation of the bta3- ligand was observed in 3, though there are two possible conformations (Chart 1) when the flexible bta3- (17) Kuhlman, R.; Schimek, G.

Chart 2 Zhu et al. 3946 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 45, No. 10, 2006 reacts with metal salts, as was demonstrated in the previous studies for imidazole-containing tripodal ligands such as 1,3,5-tris(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.19 Complex 3 is a nanometer-sized metallocage because the distances between Cu1 and Cu1C and between Cu3 and Cu5A (Figure 7a) are 10.25 and 10.92 Å, respectively. Each Cu2(COO)4 paddle-wheel unit has two terminal water molecules coordinated to the inside and outside CuII atoms of the cage. The overall size of the cage is 19.7 Å (with terminal ligands) or 15.5 Å (without terminal ligands) in diameter. In the reported cagelike complex [Cu24(m-bdc)24- (DMF)14(H2O)10](H2O)50(DMF)6(C2H5OH)6, water or DMF molecules coordinated to the CuII atoms as terminal ligands and gave an overall size of 34 Å (with terminal ligands) or 25 Å (without terminal ligands) in diameter.5 The distance from the cavity center to the bta centroid is 6.9 Å (a diameter of 13.8 Å and a volume of 1375 Å3), which is longer than that of the reported complex [CuII12(tapp)8] (H3tapp ) 2,4,6- triazophenyl-1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) but shorter than the corresponding distance of [Cu24(m-bdc)24(DMF)14(H2O)10]- (H2O)50(DMF)6(C2H5OH)6.5,20 The crystallographic study provides direct evidence of 3 with a large inner cavity capable of accommodating many solvent molecules. A total of 29 well-defined water molecules were found in each cage 3 (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Four disordered water molecules (each has two positions with site occupancy factors of 0.5) are located outside, while the other 25 are inside of 3. The presence of the water molecules was confirmed by TGA. Unfortunately, the structure collapsed after removal of the water molecules and could not be recovered. In the crystal packing, each cage of 3 is sur- rounded by eight cages (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The compound H3bta was used for the first time as a secondary building unit to construct metal-organic archi- tectures. Namely, the present study provides the first example of a supramolecular complex with a flexible tricarboxylate bta3- ligand and a nice example of a nanometer-sized metallocage. Compound 3 is a new metallocage composed of Cu paddle-wheel square secondary building units and bta organic links (triangular secondary building units). In our previous studies, the bta3- ligand was used to react with main-group metal salts of CaII and BaII, transition-metal salts of CoII and NiII, and various lanthanide salts, and metal complexes with 1D, 2D, and 3D structure were obtained.21 The results of previous and present studies indicate that the flexible bta3- ligand is versatile in the formation of metal- organic architectures because different conformations of the ligand and different coordination modes of the carboxylate group. On the other hand, the metal atoms with different coordination numbers and coordination geometries also enrich the structure of the resulting complexes. It is worth noting that the metal atoms in each complex of 1-3 have two or three different coordination environments, while in the case of CoII and NiII complexes, all of the metal atoms have the same coordination environment.21b Furthermore, the Ag-O coordination, together with the Ag-Ag and Ag-C interactions, makes complex 1 a unique structure. Properties of Complexes 1 and 2. Both 1 and 2 are air stable. TGA for complexes 1 and 2 was carried out to exam their thermal stabilities by heating of the samples up to 600 °C. The TGA data of 1 show that a weight loss of 4.8% (calculated 4.5%) corresponding to the liberation of the water molecules was observed below 80 °C, and then no further weight loss was observed until 220 °C. The TGA data of 2 show that a weight loss of 20.0% (calculated 20.6%) corresponds to a loss of lattice and coordinated water molecules below 205 °C, and then the residue starts to decompose from 350 °C.

Metal-Organic Architectures of AgI, CdII, and CuII Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 45, No. 10, 2006 3947 Photoluminescent properties of frameworks 1 and 2 as well as the H3bta ligand were investigated in the powdered solid state at room temperature. No clear luminescence was detected for the H3bta ligand and its AgI complex 1 under the experimental conditions. It has been reported that AgI complexes may emit weak photoluminescence at low tem- perature and that the luminescence at room temperature is weak or unobservable.22 In contrast to complex 1 and the H3bta ligand, the CdII complex 2 shows intense violet-blue photoluminescence under the same conditions. Complex 2 exhibits photoluminescence with an emission maximum at ca. 463 nm (lifetime τ ) 2.84 ns) upon excitation at 381 nm, as illustrated in Figure 8. When complex 2 was excited at 364 nm, the emission maximum was slightly blue shifted to 455 nm. Because no emission was observed for the H3- bta ligand, photoluminescence of complex 2 was attributed to the coordination of the bta3- ligand to the CdII atoms, as was observed in the previously reported cadmium(II) car- boxylate complexes.23 An intense emission was observed for the CdII complex of a trimellitic salt, while no emission was detected for the trimellitic acid.23a In the case of CdIIbtc complexes, the observed photoluminescence has been as- signed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer.23b Conclusion Three metal complexes with a flexible bta3- ligand, 1-3, were synthesized, and the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that different conformations of the bta ligand and different coordination modes of the carboxylate group as well as different coordination numbers and coor- dination geometries of the metal atoms make the complexes interesting 3D framework structures (1 and 2) and a discrete cagelike structure (3). The results of the luminescence investigation showed that the CdII complex exhibited violet- blue photoluminescence, while no emissions were observed for the AgI complex. Acknowledgment.
