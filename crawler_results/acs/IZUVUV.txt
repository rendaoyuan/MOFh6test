Depending on the crystallization conditions during the self-assembling process, the resulting porous coordination networks can be stable thermo- dynamic products or metastable kinetic products. Thermodynami- cally controlled porous coordination networks can be obtained via conventional self-assembly methods in solution over long periods of time (i.e., days to weeks).1012 The resulting stable products yield crystals that can be readily determined by single crystal X-ray diﬀraction and, in particular cases, single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) reactions allow solid-state reactions to be studied in detail.1316 Conversely, metastable products are more diﬃcult to be characterized by single crystal X-ray diﬀraction due to their small crystal size resulting from fast crystallization process and due to their tendency to transform into more stable structures.17 One of the primary problems chemists face in studying solid- state reactions is that often the single crystals transform into poly-microcrystalline samples and therefore are not suitable for structural characterization by single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction. For this reason, there are many solid-state chemical reactions that remained unexplored. However, thanks to recent advances in ab initio structure determination by X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRPD),1826 chemical reactions can be characterized in detail in a single-crystal-to-polycrystalline manner. Solid-state reactions involving intermediate amorphous phases are challenging, yet fascinating reactions because they can form new materials that are diﬃcult (if not impossible) to be obtained from solution, providing that the solid-state reactions have diﬀer- ent reaction conditions to those in the solution state.27 In this regard, we recently reported how a double interpene- trated porous coordination network [(ZnI2)3(TPT)2]n 3 5.5 (C6H5NO2)(H2O) (1), where TPT is tris(4-pyridyl)triazine, trans- forms into the remarkably stable porous network [(ZnI2)3(TPT)2]n (1a) in a solid-state reaction at high temperatures exceeding 573 K.28 The reaction occurs via a crystalline-to-amorphous-to- crystalline (CAC) phase transformation that involves signiﬁcant Received: October 19, 2010 ABSTRACT: With the use of ab initio X-ray powder diﬀraction, a family of isostructural crystalline porous coordination net- works, [(ZnX2)3(TPT)2]n 3 (solvent) (X = I, Br, Cl), has been studied at elevated temperatures of 573723 K. Upon heating, all three networks exhibited crystalline-to-amorphous-to-crys- talline (CAC) phase transformations to three new networks, [(ZnI2)3(TPT)2]n, [(ZnBr2)3(TPT)2]n 3 (H2O) and [(ZnBr2) (μ-Br)(ZnBr)(TPT)]n, and [(ZnCl2)(μ-Cl)(ZnCl)(TPT)]n, respectively. A set of control experiments was used to obtain detailed mechanistic aspects of the CAC transformations. We demonstrate how bonds are broken and formed in these signiﬁcant molecular rearrangements and how the initial ar- rangement plays a crucial role in the formation of the new networks after the CAC transformations. The structural infor- mation in the amorphous phase is retained and passed from a metastable to a more stable crystal, thus, reinforcing the notion that coordination networks are ﬂexible and chemically active. 5854 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109160a |J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 5853–5860 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE molecular rearrangements. From those results, it seems that the initial arrangement of molecules within metastable structure (1) can play an important role in the synthesis of new crystal structures. To gain insights in the mechanistic aspects of such CAC phase transformations, we exploited state-of-the-art meth- ods for structure determination from powder X-ray diﬀraction data to study a set of isostructural metastable coordination networks [(ZnBr2)3(TPT)2]n 3 5(C6H5NO2)(H2O) (2) and [(ZnCl2)3(TPT)2]n 3 5.5(C6H5NO2)(H2O) (3) at elevated tem- peratures. We found that the metastable structures (13) undergo CAC phase transformation involving bond-breaking and bond-forming to yield three new stable products. Furthermore, we studied the role of the intermediate amorphous phase in order to elucidate whether a structural memory eﬀect exists during the CAC transformations. In addition to size diﬀerence in halides, the diﬀerence in strength of Znhalide coordination bonds in the metastable structures plays a crucial role in the ﬁnal structures. ’RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis of Metastable Interpenetrated Networks 1, 2, and 3. Kinetically controlled metastable compounds 1, 2, and 3 weresynthesizedusingthe“instantsynthesis”method(Scheme1).29 A fine homogeneous powder of 1 was obtained by instant mixing of ZnI2 (0.24 mmol) with TPT (0.16 mmol) in an 8:1 nitro- benzene/methanol solution (36 mL) within 30 s. Compounds 2 and 3 were obtained using the same method but replacing ZnI2 with ZnBr2 and ZnCl2, respectively. The XRPD patterns, simulated powder patterns from single crystal structures, and elemental analyses all indicate that pure phases of 1, 2, and 3 were obtained.30 Compounds 1, 2, and 3 are isostructural and are described as double interpenetrated (10,3-b) networks.31 The shortest circuit within the networks is composed of 10 Zn halides and 10 TPT molecules.32 Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) experiments show that all three structures gradually release solvent between 300 and 500 K (See Supporting Information). Thermodynamic Stability and Structural Properties of 1. Upon heating from 300 to 673 K, compound 1 (Figure 1a) undergoes a CAC transformation.28 In situ XRPD shows that 1 changes to an amorphous phase at 473 K and upon further heating a new crystalline porous phase (1a) appears uniformly at 573 K and is stable up to 673 K (Figure 1b). TG-DSC experiments revealed that after the release of solvent molecules a new crystalline phase is obtained as indicated by the exothermic peak at ca. 573 K (Figure S1). Importantly, the metal-to-ligand ratio (M/L) of 3:2 in 1a remains unchanged throughout the reaction. The stability of 1a was studied under vacuum conditions and low temperature (95 K).33,34 The XRPD data demonstrates that 1a is stable under those conditions. Direct ab initio structure solution1820 indi- cates that the framework in 1a under vacuum is the same as the one at atmospheric pressure, with only a small distortion of the ligand TPT. Guest inclusion behavior of 1a was demonstrated by immersion of 1a in nitrobenzene.28 Because of the potential Scheme 1.

Soc. 2011, 133, 5853–5860 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE industrial applications of porous coordination networks to materials for catalysts, conductivity, chemical sensors, and so on, we were prompted to further investigate the inclusion of smaller molecules (I2). Compound [(ZnI2)3(TPT)2 3 x(G1)]n (with x = 0.6 (1a 3 G1), where G1 = I2) was successfully obtained by exposure of 1a to vapors of I2 at 300 K for 12 h. The peak shift and change in the relative intensities of the XRPD pattern suggest the inclusion of I2 (Figure 2). In particular, the intense peak in 1a 3 G1 at 2θ ≈19, which corresponds to the hkl plane 22-1, indicates that I2 is included in the pore. This is also supported by the color change from light yellow (1a) to brown (1a 3 G1). The structure of 1a 3 G1 was solved directly by ab initio XRPD.

Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 5853–5860 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE patterns in the Rietveld reﬁnement shows the correctness of the structure (Figure 3). The guest inclusion of I2 is reversible since heating 1a 3 G1 to 573 K produced 1a again (Figure 3). The I2 molecules are located between iodide atoms of ZnI2 units at the center of the pore. The intermolecular distance between I2 molecules is 6.59 Å which suggests that there is no interaction among I2 molecules. The dihalogen I2 acts as Lewis acid (halogen bond donor) and the I from the ZnI2 acts as Lewis base (halogen bond acceptor)3539 to form a one-dimensional array through halogen bonding interactions. One I2 is halogen bonded to two I atoms through the I 3 3 3 II interactions (d1 = 3.76 Å; 158 and d2 = 3.67 Å; 174). The attractive nature of this halogen bonding interaction is evidenced by the I3 3 3I distances that are shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii of two I atoms (3.96 Å). Unlike other compounds involving halogen bonding interac- tions with I2, the I2 in 1a 3G1 does not have amphoteric behavior (i. e., both termini of the I2 act as a Lewis acid).36 Thus, the attractive nature of the halogen bonding interaction can be considered as the main driving force for the inclusion of the I2 in 1a. Retention of Structural Information through the CAC Transformation in 1. The formation of the amorphous phase can be rationalized by the significant molecular reorganization occurring during the phase transition (423 to 523 K) from double interpenetrated to the noninterpenetrated topology of 1a. Clearly, unlocking of the two networks implies cleavage and formation of zincnitrogen coordination bonds. In this solid- state reaction, it is likely that a certain degree of structural memory of 1 persists in the amorphous phase (473 K) in order to form 1a. To prove that, we carried out a control experiment by finely grinding powder of ZnI2 and TPT (3:2 molar ratio). However, the amorphous phase obtained after grinding did not produce 1a at 573 K (Figure S4a). Moreover, DSC experiments of a grinding mixture of ZnI2 and TPT (3:2 molar ratio) did not show any exothermic peak upon heating to 573 K, indicating that no crystallization of 1a occurs (Figure S4b). The same experiment but with the addition of a small amount of nitrobenzene to the mixture of ZnI2 and ligand TPT also did not form 1a after heating to 573 K. These experiments, where there is no prior molecular rearrangement, suggest that the preorganization in 1 is crucial for the uniform formation of 1a. Furthermore, in order to study if the same phenomena (i.e., bond breaking and bond forming) occurred when a different type of interpenetrated porous coordination net- work is used as starting material, the biporous coordination network [(ZnI2)3(TPT)2(triphenylene)]n 3 x(C6H5NO2) 3 y(CH3OH) (where x ≈4 and y ≈2) (1b)40 was heated at 573 K. Interestingly, PXRD analysis shows that the same thermodyna- mically stable structure 1a is obtained (Figures S5 and S6). Crystalline-to-Amorphous-to-Crystalline Phase Transi- tion and Structural Properties of 2: Structural Memory Effect and High Temperature Synthesis of Bromide-Bridged M2L Network. Microcrystalline powder of 2 was heated to 573 K in the hot stage of the diffractometer and monitored by in situ XRPD analysis. The diffraction data shows two phase transitions through a CAC process (Figure 4). After annealing 2 in air at 573 K for 36 h, a highly polycrystalline solid was obtained and confirmed by DSC from the exothermic peak at ca. 540 K (Figure S2). We noted that the same XRPD pattern was obtained at lower temperatures (i.e., 543573 K).29 Elemental analysis suggests that the compound is [(ZnBr2)3(TPT)2]n 3 (H2O) (2a). High quality synchrotron XRPD data of 2a was recorded and structure determination was carried out by ab intio XRPD followed by Rietveld refinement (Figure 5). The compound 2a is a double interpenetrated network obtained after nitrobenzene guest removal and molecular rearrangement (Figure 5). The significant molecular reorganization of the framework, which can be explained by the formation of the amorphous phase, resulted in loss of single crystallinity, a large unit cell volume reduction of 47%, and change in the crystal system from monoclinic to orthorhombic. Figure 7. XRPD patterns and structures of 2 and 2a obtained from ab initio XRPD. Compound 2 was transformed to 2a in the solid-state via amorphous phase upon heating at 573 K, whereas grinding solid TPT and ZnBr2 and heating to 573 K did not form 2a. 5857 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109160a |J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 5853–5860 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE Regarding the topology, like in 1 and 2, the shortest circuit observed in 2a consists of 10 molecules of TPT and 10 Zn atoms. One single circuit forms channels along the c-axis (Figure 5a). However, in the absence of guests to fill up the channels, a second circuit interpenetrates through ππ stacking interactions and forms a nonporous double interpenetrated network (Figure 5b). It is important to elucidate whether there is cleavage and formation of coordination bonds and whether retention of structural features exists through the amorphous transition. Although the similar double interpenetration connectivity be- tween 2 and 2a is observed, the above structural changes and the presence of amorphous phase during the heating process suggest that the molecular reorganization in 2 should involve cleavage and formation of coordination bonds. To clarify this aspect, we investigated the network [(ZnBr2)3(TPT)2]n 3 6(C6H5NO2) (2b), which is a noninterpenetrated network having 1D channels (diameter: ca. 25 Å) (Figure 6a).29 Heating 2b to 553 K yields the same XRPD pattern of compound 2a (Figure S10) and therefore the same crystal structure (Figure 6b).41 Clearly, this evidence proves that cleavage and formation of coordination bonds must occur during the CAC transformation from 2b (noninter- penetrated) to 2a (interpenetrated). To understand the role of the amorphous intermediate phase more clearly, we carried out two control experiments. First, we mixed ZnBr2 and TPT powder in a 3:2 molar ratio, ground and heated to 573 K for 36 h. However, XRPD data demonstrated that compound 2a was not formed. Moreover, TG-DSC experiments showed no exothermic peak between 550 and 580 K, indicating that no crystallization of 2a took place (Figure S12). Similarly to the CAC transformation of 1 into 1a, the above results show that the molecular prearrangement in 2 and 2b is necessary to form 2a. Therefore, a certain degree of structural features remains in the amorphous phase (i.e., a sort of memory eﬀect) that permits structural information to be propagated from the metastable structure toward a more stable network 2a (Figure 7). To study if breaking of the interpenetration in 2a and formation of a new network was possible, 2a was heated in air to 723 K for 4 h in a furnace. After cooling down to 300 K over 36 h, single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained. Single crystal X-ray analysis revealed new bromide-bridged coordina- tion network [(ZnBr2)(μ-Br)(ZnBr)(TPT)]n (2c) (Figure 8). The metal-to-ligand ratio changed from M3L2 to M2L during this process. The new three-dimensional network (2c) has two TPT ligands connected through one ZnBr2. Because of local changes in the coordination environment, one of the two Zn atoms has a tetrahedral geometry through coordination to three Br and one pyridyl group (Figure 8b). The bridging coordination bond extends two-dimensionally along the a- and c-axes directions and forms layers (Figure 8a). Each layer can be regarded as a porous structure. However, adjacent two-dimensional layers are not interpenetrated but rather intercalated, and therefore, the intrinsic porosity of each layer is lost upon stacking (Figure 8c). Crystalline-to-Amorphous-to-Crystalline Phase Transi- tion and Structural Properties of 3: High Temperature Synthesis of Chloride-Bridged M2L Network. Deliberately, we synthesized the metastable interpenetrated network [(ZnCl2)3 (TPT)2]n35.5(C6H5NO2)(CH3OH)(H2O) (3) homogeneously Figure 9. In situ XRPD patterns of 3 measured at diﬀerent tempera- tures. The formation of an intermediate amorphous phase at 473 K shows that severe molecular reorganization takes place during the solid- state reaction. The formation of a new crystalline phase (3a) (i.e., similar to that of 2a) is observed at 573 K. Annealing 3a for 60 h with a heating rate 10 C/min generated a new compound 3b. Figure 8.

Soc. 2011, 133, 5853–5860 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE by using the instant synthesis method. X-ray structure determi- nation, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric studies re- vealed that compound 3 was isostructural to 1 and 2.42 Similarly to 1 and 2, a CAC phase transition of 3 during heating at 573 K was observed. Note that the diffraction pattern observed at 573 K was similar to that of 2a. This observation indicates the presence of a nonporous desolvated structure (i.e., namely 3a).43 How- ever, the powder 3a was not as stable as 2a, so that successive 60 h annealing at 573 K produced a new powder pattern (Figure 9). Interestingly, further annealing of 3 in a furnace at 723 K for 4 h and subsequently cooling to 300 K over 36 h produced single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography. Single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed the formation of a new struc- ture [(ZnCl2)(μ-Cl)(ZnCl)(TPT)]n (3b). The simulated XRPD pattern from single crystal data reasonably matched the diﬀraction pattern of the product obtained at 573 K (Figures S18 and S19). The TG-DSC analysis revealed that 3 gradually releases nitrobenzene ﬁrst at temperatures from 300 to 500 K, followed by the formation of phase 3b as evidenced by the exothermic peak around 525 K (Figure S3). As in 2c, the metal-to-ligand ratio in 3b also changed from M3L2 to M2L during this process. One Zn metal coordinates to three Cl atoms and one pyridyl group, while the second Zn atom coordinates to two Cl and two pyridyl groups (Figure 10); thus, both Zn centers adopt a tetrahedral geometry. Compound 3b is a two-fold interpenetrated network in which each network forms a square channel. However, the channels are no longer present due to the interpenetration of individual networks. Despite having the bridging motif between the Zn and Cl atoms, 3b is not isostructural to 2c. In a control experiment, grinding ZnCl2 and TPT in a 3:2 molar ratio and then heating to 573 K for 60 h did not produce 3a but rather 3b as shown by XRPD. This was further supported by TG-DSC analysis in which again a grinding mixture of a 3:2 metal-to-ligand ratio showed an exothermic peak at ca. 553 K as a result of the crystallization of 3b (Figure S22).44 The Influence of Zinc Halides in the Solid-State Reaction of Interpenetrated Porous Networks. Upon heating, each interpenetrated porous network 1, 2, and 3 initially produces amorphous phases. However, interestingly, if heating continues, network 1 converts into a noninterpenetrated network (1a), whereas networks 2 and 3 give interpenetrated networks 2a and 3a, respectively. Even though once periodicity of frameworks is lost at 473 K, surprisingly further heating produces new thermally stable crystalline phases. Metastable networks 1, 2, and 3 are isostructural and contain the same solvent. Therefore, the different crystal structures 1a and 2a can be rationalized due to the presence of different zinc halides. To better understand this aspect, we compared the DSC experiments of 1, 2, and 3 upon heating from 300 to 725 K (Figure 11). The removal of solvent molecules takes place at 300473 K, followed by the formation of the amorphous phase (i.e., corroborated by XRPD) and crystallization as denoted by the exothermic peaks at 573 and 540 K corresponding to 1a and 2a, respectively. Importantly, the two exothermic peaks appear at different temperatures, indicat- ing that higher energy is required to form 1a than 2a. Thus, after the amorphous phase formation, different reorganization pro- cesses such as bond-breaking and bond-forming can occur and hence may explain the different structures of 1a and 2a. In case of 3, the desolvated structure 3a was unstable and thus directly transformed to 3b. These reactivity differences can be attribu- table to the different strength of coordination bonds between Zn and halide atoms. ’CONCLUSIONS Through our studies, we determined that 1, 2, and 3 diﬀer in the solid-state reactivity at elevated temperatures while having in common the same interpenetrated topology and crystal-to- amorphous-to-crystal transformations. As a result, three new structures with diﬀerent topology were obtained upon heating. We hypothesized that these diﬀerences are attributable to the diﬀerent strength of coordination bonds between Zn and halide atoms. Importantly, those networks can not be prepared from the solid-state reactions of each starting material, ZnX2 (X = I, Br, Cl) and TPT. This leads us to conclude that the initial arrangement of the building units in the interpenetrated structures is a critical Figure 10. Single crystal structure of 3b.

Crystallization of 1a, 2a, and 3b occurs after the formation of the amorphous phase and is clearly observed by the exothermic peaks at 573, 540, and 502 K, respectively, where the temperatures indicate the rising rather than the peak top positions. 5859 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109160a |J. Am. Chem.

Although the results reported in this paper are for a particular family of isostructural porous coordination networks (10,3-b), we believe that the process can be applied to other materials to prepare a new class of solids. Meanwhile, ab initio powder X-ray diﬀraction determination will be a very powerful analytical tool. We anticipate that the strategy reported here will be widely adopted, thus, contributing to the progress in materials science. ’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION X-ray Powder Diffraction Data.

(30) Robson et al. reported the network 3 without detailed informa- tion in reference.1 We attempted to redetermine the crystal structure in this study using single crystal X-ray diﬀraction, but high quality data was not obtained due to polycrystallinity. However, we determined the 10,3- b type framework (see ref 42). Our X-ray powder diﬀraction experi- ments, TG-DSC, and elemental analysis suggest that the product 3 is the same interpenetrated network as 1 and 2. Therefore, we used 3 as a starting material for the heating experiment. (31) Delgado-Friedrichs, O.; O‘Keeﬀe, M.; Yaghi, O. M. Acta Crystallogr., Sect. A 2003, 59, 515–525.

Triphenylene is regarded as a host framework rather than guest because it cannot be replaced by common aromatic compounds under guest exchange conditions, due to the strong stacking between triazine panels and triphenylene thorough charge-transfer interactions. (41) See Supporting Information to see the XRPD pattern of 2a obtained after heating 2 and 2b at 553 K (Figure S10). We also obtained the same XRPD pattern and hence the same interpenetrated structure 2a from a biporous coordination network reported in ref 29 (Figure S11). (42) As explained in ref 30, 3 has the same topology of 1 and 2. We managed to obtain the crystal structure of 3 using single crystal X-ray diﬀraction and, although we could not locate the nitrobenzene mol- ecules, we did determine the framework (Figure S16) and simulate the XRPD pattern. Figure S17 shows the comparison between the experi- mental and simulated XRPD patterns. Slow layer-to-layer diﬀusion method with the same stoichiometry of starting reagents produced single crystals of the 3D network structure [(ZnCl2)3(TPT)2]n 3 6(C6H5NO2) (3c) although 3 can be obtained as a minor product. The network 3c has 1D channels formed by ππ stacking of TPT (Figure S24). See Supporting Information for detailed information. (43) Compound 3 did not provide a clear XRPD pattern after reaching 573 K, whereas compounds 1 and 2 having good crystallinity provided 1a and 2a via crystalline-to-amorphous-to-crystalline (CAC) transformation at 573 K. In the case of 3, the equivalent 3a obtained after the amorphous phase is not crystalline enough and cannot be character- ized by ab initio X-ray diﬀraction. However, similarities with the diﬀraction pattern of 2a and elemental analyses suggest the same desolvated structure. (44) We note that the temperature diﬀerence in the exothermic peaks obtained after heating 3 (525 K) and after heating a grinding mixture of ZnCl2 and TPT (553 K) can be rationalized by the presence of nitrobenzene in 3. In the case of ZnCl2, since it is very likely that solidliquid phase was created at 573 K, the most stable product 3b was obtained. (45) Boultif, A.; Lou€er, D. J. Appl.

Nitrobenzene molecules have been omitted for clarity. Importantly, 3 was first mentioned earlier by Robson and co-workers. In our work although we have obtained the crystal structure, the quality was not suitable for publication. However, clearly the topology of 3 is the same as 1 and 2. This is also corroborated by elemental analysis. Figure S17. Comparison between (a) experimental (300 K) and (b) simulated (90 K) XRPD of 3. Similar features are observed. For instance the peak at 2θ ca. 7° corresponds to the hkl plane 20-2. As shown in (c), this peak contains only TPT molecules belonging to the framework and hence this peak is more reliable to compare it with the present structure since we were unable to locate the solvent molecules. However, the hkl planes 200 and 002 observed in the simulated pattern (red) are less reliable in this comparison since the X-ray crystal structure was not sufficiently resolved to locate the nitrobenzene molecules accurately. Furthermore, the low resolution of the experimental XRPD does not allow the observation of peaks at low 2θ angles. The shift in peak positions is expected due to the difference in X- ray data collection temperature. Figure S18. XRPD pattern of 3b after annealing compound 3 for 60 hours at 573 K. Figure S19.

Synthesis of 1-3: The synthesis of 1 and 2 has already been reported.1,2 Microcrystalline powder of 3 was synthesized by adding a methanol solution (8mL) of ZnCl2 (0.24 mmol) into a vigorously stirred nitrobenzene/methanol solution (32 mL/4 mL) containing TPT (0.16 mmol). Within 30 sec white powder was precipitated, which was then isolated in 68% yield by filtration. Synthesis of compound 3c: Thermodynamic product 3c was synthesized from a triple-layered solution consisting of a methanol solution (8 mL) of ZnCl2 (0.24 mmol) as the top layer, methanol (1 mL) as the middle layer, and a nitrobenzene/methanol solution (32 mL/4mL) of TPT (0.16 mmol) as the bottom layer. After 1 week, colorless needles were grown and isolated under microscope in 41% yield. Scheme S1. Synthesis of compound 3 and 3c. Synthesis and purification of compound 3b: On a slide glass 200 mg of compound 3 was taken, put into the furnace and annealed at 573K for 60 hr. Then the temperature was increased to 723K and kept for 4hr, during that time colorless crystals formed along with brown powder. The crystals were carefully separated from powder under microscope (3b, 28mg, crude yield; 43%). The brown powder was not soluble in common organic solvents. As the simulated PXRD pattern from single crystal data of 3b reasonably matched the diffraction pattern of the product obtained at 573 K (Figures S18, S19), in an another experiment the intermediate product was removed from the furnace after heating at 573K for 60 hr. Elemental analysis showed that it was a mixture of 3b and TPT. The pale brownish powder was then subjected for sublimation at 573K under vacuum. The sublimated white solid was collected and confirmed as TPT by NMR and TLC and the remained powder was pure 3b according to elemental analysis. Synthesis of compound 2c: On a slide glass 210 mg of compound 2 was taken, put into the furnace and annealed at 723K for 4 hr. During heating, colorless transparent crystals formed along with brown powder. The crystals were carefully separated from powder under microscope (2c, 62 mg, crude yield 52%). The brown powder may be calcinated or oxidized TPT which was not soluble in common organic solvents. Unlike 3b, in this case the reaction did not occur at lower temperature, so we could not purify 2c by sublimation experiment. S5 Scheme S2. Synthesis of compound 2c. Elemental Analyses Data S6 Figure S1. TG-DSC plot of solid 1. The exothermic peak at 573 K indicates that a new phase is obtained. From the TG curve, the release of solvent occurs before the formation of the exothermic peak and therefore the amorphous phase can be further annealed. Cleavage and formation of coordination bonds occur to form 1a. S7 Figure S2. TG-DSC plot of solid 2. The exothermic peak at 543 K indicates that a new crystalline phase 2a is formed upon heating. The exothermic peak appears after the complete release of solvent molecules as observed in the TG curve. S8 Figure S3. TG-DSC plot of solid 3. The exothermic peak that starts to form at 502 K with a maximum at 525 K shows that phase 3b is formed. However, in this case the exothermic peak starts to appear while the solvent molecules are still being released as the exothermic peak overlaps with the TG curve. S9 Figure S4.

Ab Initio crystal structure determination of [(ZnI2)3(TPT)2•0.6(G1)]n (G1 = I2). High quality powder X-ray diffraction pattern of compound 1•G1 was recorded at 83 K in transmission mode [0.3 mm capillary; synchrotron radiation, λ = 0.9948 Å; 2θ range, 3 – 60º; step size, 0.01º; data collection time, 20 min] on a diffractometer equipped with a blue imaging plate detector at SPring-8 BL19B2 beam line. The XRPD pattern of 1•G1 was indexed using the program DICVOL (Boultif, A.; Louër, D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991, 24, 987-993) to give a monoclinic unit cell (a = 12.59346 Å, b = 29.27880 Å, c = 6.59304 Å, β = 92.878°) with good figures of merit. The space group was assigned as P21 based on systematic absences. Unit cell and profile refinement were carried out using the Pawley method, resulting in excellent fit (Rwp = 11.58, χ2 = 7.347) for these lattice parameters and space group. Structure solution was carried out by the simulated annealing method with the program DASH (David, W. I. F.; Shankland, K; van de Streek, J; Pidcock, E; Motherwell, W. D. S.; Cole, J. C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006, 39, 910- 915). One rigid group of [(ZnI2)3(TPT)2] in which Zn-Npyridyl bonds were allowed to rotate, two iodide atoms in the asymmetric unit and Z = 2 for space group P21 were introduced by using a constrained Z- matrix description. During annealing, 20 runs having 6 × 106 Monte Carlo moves each were performed. The best structure obtained (Profile χ2 = 89.91) was taken as the starting structural model for Rietveld refinement. S12 The Rietveld refinement of 1•G1 was performed with the program RIETAN-FP (Izumi, F.; Momma, K. Solid State Phenom. 2007, 130, 15-20) and VESTA (Momma, K.; Izumi, F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2008, 41, 653-658). Restraints but no constraints for all bond lengths were employed to maintain the molecular geometry. Thermal temperature factors were refined isotropically and uniform values were applied to the framework. Final Rietveld refinement: a = 12.5882 (9), b = 29.285 (2), c = 6.5904 (4) Å, β = 92.885 (2) Rwp = 3.99 % (Re = 1.53 %), Rp = 2.98 %, RB = 4.95 %, RF = 2.13 %; 5700 profile points; 246 refined variables. Ab Initio XRPD structure determination of 1a under vacuum. High quality powder X-ray diffraction pattern of compound 1a was recorded under vacuum at 95 K in transmission mode [0.3 mm capillary; synchrotron radiation, λ = 1.0 Å; 2θ range, 3 – 60º; step size, 0.01º; data collection time, 20 min] on a diffractometer equipped with a blue imaging plate detector at SPring-8 BL19B2 beamline. The XRPD pattern of 1a under vacuum was indexed using the program DICVOL (Boultif, A.; Louër, D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991, 24, 987-993) to give a monoclinic unit cell (a = 12.73144 Å, b = 29.67473 Å, c = 6.52284 Å, β = 93.064°) with good figures of merit. The space group was assigned as P21 based on systematic absences. Unit cell and profile refinement were carried out using the Pawley method, resulting in excellent fit (Rwp = 16.37, χ2 = 26.330) for these lattice parameters and space group. Structure solution was carried out by the simulated annealing method with the program DASH (David, W. I. F.; Shankland, K; van de Streek, J; Pidcock, E; Motherwell, W. D. S.; Cole, J. C. J. Appl.

One rigid group of [(ZnI2)3(TPT)2] in which Zn-Npyridyl bonds were allowed to rotate, two iodide atoms in the asymmetric unit and Z = 2 for space group P21 were introduced by using a constrained Z- matrix description. During annealing, 20 runs having 6 × 106 Monte Carlo moves each were performed. The best structure obtained (Profile χ2 = 69.83) was taken as the starting structural model for Rietveld refinement.

Thermal temperature factors were refined isotropically and uniform values were applied to the framework. Final Rietveld refinement: a = 12.7190(5), b = 29.6449(11), c = 6.51966(23) Å, β = 93.066(2), Rwp = 3.54 % (Re = 1.43 %), Rp = 2.68 %, RB = 2.16 %, RF = 1.04 %; 5700 profile points; 415 refined variables.

S14 Structural Properties of [(ZnBr2)3(TPT)2]n•(H2O) (2) Microcrystalline powder of network 2 was heated to 573 K in the hot stage of the diffractometer and monitored by in situ XRPD analysis. The diffraction data showed two phase transitions from crystalline- to-amorphous-to-crystalline phase. At 573 K the formation of a new crystalline phase was evident. However, the crystallinity was not good. Annealing of 2 at 573 K for 36 hours yielded a solid with good crystallinity (see Figure 5 for XRPD used to carry out Rietveld refinement ). Ab Initio XRPD structure determination of 2a. Ab Initio crystal structure determination of [(ZnBr2)3(TPT)2]n•(H2O). High quality powder X-ray diffraction pattern of compound 2a was recorded at 100 K in transmission mode [0.3 mm capillary; synchrotron radiation, λ = 1.3 Å; 2θ range, 4 – 68º; step size, 0.01º; data collection time, 30 min] on a diffractometer equipped with a blue imaging plate detector at SPring-8 BL19B2 beamline.

Crystallogr. 1991, 24, 987-993) to give an orthorhombic unit cell (a = 23.12073 Å, b = 22.72618 Å, c = 15.66338 Å) with good figures of merit. The space group was assigned as Pbca based on systematic absences. Unit cell and profile refinement were carried out using the Pawley method, resulting in excellent fit (Rwp = 12.29, χ2 = 6.453) for these lattice parameters and space group. Structure solution was carried out by the simulated annealing method with the program DASH (David, W. I. F.; Shankland, K; van de Streek, J; Pidcock, E; Motherwell, W. D. S.; Cole, J. C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006, 39, 910-915). One rigid group of [(ZnBr2)3(TPT)2] in which Zn-Npyridyl bonds were allowed to rotate, in the asymmetric unit and Z = 8 for space group Pbca were introduced by using a constrained Z-matrix description. During annealing, 20 runs having 5×106 Monte Carlo moves each were performed. The best structure obtained (Profile χ2 = 66.25) was taken as the starting structural model for Rietveld refinement. The Rietveld refinement of 2a was performed with the program RIETAN-FP (Izumi, F.; Momma, K. Solid State Phenom. 2007, 130, 15-20) and VESTA (Momma, K.; Izumi, F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2008, 41, 653-658). Restraints but no constraints for all bond lengths were employed to maintain the molecular geometry. Thermal temperature factors were refined isotropically and uniform values were applied to the framework. Final Rietveld refinement: a = 23.089 (2), b = 22.702 (2), c = 15.646 (1) Å, Rwp = 5.39 % (Re = 1.93 %), Rp = 3.99 %, RB = 5.05 %, RF = 2.79 %; 6400 profile points; 369 refined variables.

Crystal structures of compounds: (a) 1; (b) 2; and (c) 3. Nitrobenzene molecules have been omitted for clarity. Importantly, 3 was first mentioned earlier by Robson and co-workers. In our work although we have obtained the crystal structure, the quality was not suitable for publication. However, clearly the topology of 3 is the same as 1 and 2. This is also corroborated by elemental analyses. S21 Figure S17. Comparison between (a) experimental (300 K) and (b) simulated (90 K) XRPD of 3. Similar features are observed. For instance the peak at 2θ ca. 7° corresponds to the hkl plane 20-2. As shown in (c), this peak contains only TPT molecules belonging to the framework and hence this peak is more reliable to compare it with the present structure since we were unable to locate the solvent molecules. However, the hkl planes 200 and 002 observed in the simulated pattern (red) are less reliable in this comparison since the X-ray crystal structure was not sufficiently resolved to locate the nitrobenzene molecules accurately. Furthermore, the low resolution of the experimental XRPD does not allow the observation of peaks at low 2θ angles. The shift in peak positions is expected due to the difference in X- ray data collection temperature. S22 Figure S18. XRPD pattern of 3b after annealing compound 3 for 60 hours at 573 K. Figure S19.
