While there are numerous extensive studies for TMOFs (transitional metal-organic frameworks),11–13 there are no experi- mental data regarding the hydrogen adsorption mechanisms and behaviors in RMOFs (rare-earth metal-organic frameworks). Such fundamental studies are essential for the optimization of this new class of rare-earth metal-organic framework materials for practical hydrogen storage applications. We present our studies of the gas sorption properties of a porous rare-earth metal-organic framework, Y(BTC)(H2O)•4.3H2O (1) (H3BTC ) 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), synthesized by solvothermal reaction. The dehydrated sample (1a) exhibits permanent porosity, selective gas adsorption, and good H2 adsorption ability. We used powder neutron diffraction to demon- strate for the ﬁrst time direct structural evidence that an optimal pore size (around 6 Å) strengthens the interactions between H2 molecules with pore walls, which therby allows for enhancing hydrogen adsorption from the interaction between hydrogen molecules with the pore walls rather than with the open metal sites within the framework. The composition and crystal structure of compound 1, Y(BTC)(H2O)•4.3H2O, were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, TGA and elemental analysis studies (see Supporting Information). The X-ray structural analysis reveals that Y atoms are bridged by a BTC linker to form a tetragonal porous framework with channels about 5.8 × 5.8 Å2 along the c axis (Figure 1). TGA result indicates 1 is stable up to 490 °C, and the framework is retained after thermal activation (compound 1a). The permanent porosity of 1a has been conﬁrmed by N2 and H2 gas sorption measurement at 77 K. Sorption studies show that 1a can take up a moderate amount of hydrogen at 1 atm and 77 K [176 cm3 g-1 (STP), 1.57 wt %], exhibiting highly selective sorption of hydrogen over nitrogen gas molecules. The 77 and 87 K isotherms were ﬁt to determine the isosteric heat of adsorption using a virial equation. The enthalpy of adsorption for 1a reaches almost 7.3 kJ mol-1, which is comparable to the value for the nanoporous prussian blue compounds with open transitional metal sites17 and the hyper-cross- linked organic polymer and nanoporous slit-like carbon.18,19 High pressure hydrogen adsorption isotherms of 1a were measured at 77 and 87 K (see Supporting Information). At 77 K, the sorption isotherm has a type I proﬁle, saturated at 10 bar with a hydrogen uptake of ∼2.1 wt %, which is comparable to those found in other MOFs (e.g., 2.3 wt % in MOF-74).20 The volumetric hydrogen storage is 28.8 g/L at 77 K and 10 bar. Powder neutron diffraction data were collected on the high- resolution neutron powder diffractometer (BT-1) at the NCNR of NIST. Figure S5a in the Supporting Information plots the neutron diffraction pattern of the Y(BTC) bare material measured at 4 K. The reﬁned lattice parameters and atomic positions of Y, C, and O atoms agree well with the room-temperature single-crystal XRD results. Differences in the neutron diffraction patterns recorded upon charging the sample of 1a with approximately 0.64(5), 1.32(3), 2.11(7), 2.95(8), 4.23(8), and 5.53(3) D2 per Y(BTC) formula unit were used to identify the successive hydrogen binding sites within the framework. One H2/Y corresponds to ∼0.68 wt % hydrogen uptake. Rietveld analyses of the 4.2D2:Y loaded sample revealed the location of 4 D2 adsorption sites, each site representing the centroid of the D2 molecule (Figure 2). The difference Fourier nuclear map obtained with a loading of 0.64(5) D2 molecules per formula unit clearly identiﬁes the position of the ﬁrst adsorption site (Figure 3). Surprisingly, the D2 centroid of the strongest adsorption position, site I (corner site I), is not directly coordinated to the open metal Y ion like the other reported MOFs11,12 but is associated with the aromatic BTC linker, at a distance of 4.27 Å from the exposed Y3+ ions and 3.7 Å from the benzene rings of † LANSCE-12, Los Alamos National Laboratory. ‡ EES-6, Los Alamos National Laboratory. § NIST Center for Neutron Research. ¶ University of Maryland. # New Mexico Highlands University. ⊥Miami University.

This result provides for the ﬁrst time direct structural evidence for the recent ﬁndings that small pores with an optimal pore diameter of just slightly over twice the kinetic diameter of the hydrogen molecules (i.e., a pore diameter of about 6-7 Å) strengthen the interactions between H2 molecules withporewallsandthusincreasetheheatofhydrogenadsorption.14–16 Ideally, all adsorbed hydrogen molecules should interact directly with adsorbing centers located in the pores walls (i.e., monolayer adsorption). Evidently, this optimal pore size results in stronger total van der Waals interactions between H2 molecules and pore walls, and such interactions strongly compete with the interactions between the H2 molecules with the open Y3+ ions. Importantly, at an increased D2 loading of 2.11(7) D2 molecules per formula unit, adsorption at site I in 1a approaches saturation, with a site occupancy of 92%. Three additional D2 adsorption sites were also identiﬁed in 1a. The order of ﬁlling of subsequent sites is sequential from D2(2) to D2(4). Following the ﬁrst strong binding site D2(1), there is a progressive occupation of the D2(2) site (corner site II), which lies in the middle of the corners within the pores at a closer distance of 3.9 Å from the open Y ion and a distance of 3.6 Å from the benzene ring of the BTC unit. D2 molecules in site III, which is comparable to site II in binding energy, are situated with their centroids 4.3 Å from the Y atoms and 2.96 Å from six BTC oxygen atoms, and within van der Waals contact of the planes of 3.8 Å from the BTC carbon atoms. With further D2 loading, the ﬁrst three adsorption sites were almost completely occupied. The fourth site is consider- ably weaker in binding energy and only becomes occupied at high loadings. Analysis of the 4.23(8) D2:Y phase reveals that D2(4) lies 3.31(1) Å from two BTC carboxylate carbon atoms and 3.23(1) Å from two BTC carboxylate oxygen atoms. Interestingly, the ﬁrst three adsorption sites discussed above form a nanocage within 1a, and the nearest neighbor distances between these adsorption sites are about 2.86 Å (Figure 1). This distance is even shorter than the 3.6 Å of solid H2, implying a signiﬁcant pressurizing effect of the framework on the encapsulated hydrogen molecules.13,21 In conclusion, a highly stable porous lanthanide metal-organic framework, Y(BTC)(H2O)·4.3H2O (BTC ) 1,3,5-benzenetricar- boxylate), exhibiting highly selective sorption behaviors of hydrogen over nitrogen gas molecules, has been constructed and investigated for hydrogen storage. We obtained detailed structural information including H2 adsorption sites and binding energies in a rare-earth MOF structure for the ﬁrst time. Moreover, powder neutron diffraction studies provide for the ﬁrst time direct structural evidence demonstrating that an optimal pore size (∼6 Å) strengthens the interactions between H2 molecules with pore walls and allows for enhancing hydrogen adsorption from the interaction between hydrogen molecules with the pore walls rather than with the open metal sites within the framework. Four distinct D2 sites were located and found to be progressively ﬁlled within the nanopore structure. At high concentration of hydrogen loading, Y(BTC) is able to hold hydrogen molecules up to 3.7 wt % as self-assembled nanostructures with relatively short intermolecular distances. Acknowledgment.

Commercially available reagents were used as received without further purification. Mid-infrared (400-4000 cm-1) spectra were collected using a Mattson Genesis II FTIR spectrometer operating at a resolution of 2 cm-1. Elemental analyses (C,H,N) were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a PerkinElmer TGA Q50 analyzer, and the data plotted as the % starting weight versus temperature. The samples were heated to 700 °C in N2 environment at a rate of 5 °C/min. A Beckman Coulter SA3100 surface area analyzer was used to measure gas adsorption. Powder XRD patterns were obtained with a Rigaku Ultima III instrument (Bragg-Brentano geometry) using CuKα radiation with a variable divergent slit and a solid-state detector. Synthesis of 1. As a typical preparation procedure, a mixture of Y(NO3)·6H2O (191.5 mg, 0.5mmol) and H3BTC (52.5 mg, 0.25 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (4 mL) and H2O (4 mL) at room temperature. The mixture in a 23-mL Parr Teflon-lined vessel was heated to 100 °C under autogenous pressure for 24 hours to give colorless crystals in 85% yield (based on H3BTC). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for 1: C 27.60, H 3.48, O 46.20; found: C 27.31, H 3.32, O 46.58. Crystal structure determination of 1: X-ray Structure Determination. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was performed on a Bruker-Nonius Apex2 CCD diffractometer with graphite- monochromatic Mo Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) by using the ω-scan mode at 100 K for 1. A crystal of 1 was glued on a polymer fiber, transferred to the diffractometer, and cooled in a dinitrogen stream. Frames were collected with 0.2° intervals in φ and ω for 10 s per frame, such that a hemisphere of data was collected. Lattice parameters were initially determined from a least-squares analysis of more than 100 centered reflections, and these parameters were later refined against all data. None of the crystals showed significant decay during data collection. Raw data collection and cell refinement were achieved using SMART; data reduction was S 2 performed using SAINT+ and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects.1 Absorption corrections were applied using the SADABS routine. Space group assignment was based on systematic absences, E-statistics, and successful refinement of the structures. Structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXTL and were refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELX-97.2.2 Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters during the final cycles except the O atoms of the free water molecules. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions with isotropic displacement parameters set to 1.2×Ueq of the attached atom. The O atoms of the coordinated water molecules were disordered over 2 equivalent sites around the crystallographic 2-fold rotation axis and were consequently refined with 0.5 of their natural occupancies. The 4.3 free water molecules were determined using TGA and elemental microanalysis. Low pressure N2 and H2 Adsorption Measurements. Gas adsorption isotherms for pressures in the range 0 bar to 1 bar were measured using a Beckman Coulter SA 3100 surface area and pore size analyzer. A sample was soaked in methanol for 24 hours, and the extract was discarded. Fresh methanol was subsequently added, and the crystals were allowed to soak for another 24 hours to remove H2O solvates. The sample was then treated with dichloromethane similarly to remove methanol solvates. After the removal of dichloromethane by decanting, the sample was dried under vacuum (< 10-3 torr) at 350°C) overnight. Before the measurements, the sample was dried again by using the “outgas” function of the surface area analyzer at 350 °C until the outgas rate was less than 2 mTorr/min (0.27 Pa/min). A sample of 70 mg was used for N2 adsorption measurement, and was maintained at 77 K with liquid nitrogen. In the hydrogen storage measurement, high-purity hydrogen (99.9995%) and a 75 mg sample were used. The regulator and hoses were flushed with hydrogen before connecting to the analyzer. The internal lines of the S 3 instrument were flushed three times by utilizing the “flushing lines” function of the program to ensure the purity of H2. The measurement was maintained at 77 K with liquid nitrogen. H2 isotherms at 87 K were measured in a liquid argon bath. Oil-free vacuum pumps and oil-free pressure regulators were used for all measurements to prevent contamination of the samples during the evacuation process or of the feed gases during the isotherm measurement. Derivation of the Isosteric Heats of Adsorption. A virial-type expression of the following form was used to fit the combined isotherm data for a given material at 77 and 87 K: i n i i i m i i N b N a T InN InP ∑ ∑ = = + + = 0 0 / 1 (1) Here, P is the pressure expressed in Torr, N is the amount of gas adsorbed in mmol/g, T is the temperature in K, ai and bi are virial coefficients, and m and n represent the number of coefficients required to adequately describe the isotherms. The equation was fit using the R statistical software package; m and n were gradually increased until the contribution of extra added a and b coefficients was deemed to be statistically insignificant toward the overall fit, as determined using the t-test. The values of the virial coefficients a0 through am were then used to calculate the isosteric heat of adsorption using the following expression: I m i i st N a R Q ∑ = − = 0 (2) Here, Qst is the coverage-dependent isosteric heat of adsorption and R is the universal gas constant. S 4 High-Pressure Gas Adsorption Measurements and Analysis. Crystals of 1 were loaded into a sample holder under an argon atmosphere. The sample was evacuated under a pressure of less than 10-4 Torr at 350 °C for at least 24 hrs. The measurements were performed over a pressure range of 0-40 bar. UHP-grade hydrogen and helium (99.999% purity) were used for all measurements. Volumetric measurements at 77 K and 87 K were carried out by submerging the sample holder in a liquid nitrogen bath and liquid argon bath, respectively, for which the fill level was maintained constant throughout the experiment. Neutron Diffraction Experiments. Neutron powder diffraction data were collected on the High Resolution Neutron Powder Diffractometer BT-1 at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) with a Ge(311) monochromator and using in-pile collimation of 15 min of arc, corresponding to a wavelength of 2.0787 Å. Measurements were taken as a function of deuterium loading at a temperature of 4 K with measurement times of ca. 5 hrs. All sample transfers were performed in a helium-filled glovebox equipped with water and oxygen monitors. Initial sample activation was performed in a quartz tube with a packless bellows valve attached. The sample was evacuated using a turbo pump (10-5 Torr) and heated to 350 °C with a ramp speed of ca. 1 °C per minute. After degassing at 350 °C for 30 hrs, the sample was cooled, pulverized using an agate mortar and pestle, transferred to a cylindrical vanadium can (i.d. = 0.95 cm) equipped with a capillary gas line and a packless valve, and sealed with an indium O-ring. The sample was mounted onto a sample stick equipped with a stainless- steel gas line with an additional valve for a top-loading closed-cycle helium refrigerator. The sample was further degassed in situ for ca. 30 mins under high vacuum (8.5 × 10-7 to 7.5 × 10-6 Torr). During the experiments, a known amount of hydrogen (deuterium) gas was loaded into the S 5 sample (2.5753 grams), which was maintained at a temperature of 77 K until no pressure drop was observed for at least 1 min. The sample was then cooled down to the base temperature of 4 K over a period of 1 h in order to perform measurements. In all cases, the outgas pressure reading was zero well before reaching 30 K. A diffraction pattern was collected for desolvated 1 prior to dosing with D2. Neutron scattering diffraction patterns were analyzed using the Rietveld refinement method.3 The program EXPGUI was used to perform all refinements.4 The model of the bare material was refined first, and it was used as the starting point for subsequent refinements of the D2-loaded samples. Deuterium molecules are treated as point scatters with double occupancy since they are expected to be quantum mechanically spherically averaged in the ground state. The coordinates of all atoms and the Debye-Waller factors (with constraints) were allowed to vary during the refinement of each deuterium loading case. Based on the structure obtained from the diffraction pattern of the bare material, the diffraction pattern of the case with 0.65 D2/Y was analyzed by neglecting the D2 molecules. The Fourier difference map was calculated and clearly indicated the positions of the D2 adsorption sites. Accurate values for the D2 locations and occupancy numbers were then obtained by introducing the deuteriums into the Rietveld refinement. For each successive D2 loading, the Fourier difference map was calculated on the basis of the results of the previous D2 loading and used to identify new D2 adsorption sites. References: 1.
