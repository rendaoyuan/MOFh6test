These open frameworks have been synthesized under mild conditions possessing three-dimensional connectivity with interconnecting pores and the same (43)2(46 · 618 · 84) topology. The water adsorption isotherms of these compounds show type Ι behavior with approximately 0.07, 0.10, 0.12, 0.17, and 0.19 mL/g pore volumes, respectively. Photoluminescence investigations reveal that they display strong emission in the blue/green regions. Introduction Microporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have re- ceived considerable attention because of their intriguing topolo- gies and exploitable properties for potential applications such as adsorption, separation, luminescence, nonlinear optics, magnetism, ion exchange, and catalysis.1 Compared with conventional porous materials, such as zeolites or activated carbons, these coordination polymers have greater potential because of their tunable framework based on metal ions with various coordination geometries and multifunctional bridging organic ligands.2 Much effort has been devoted to the develop- ment, design, and synthesis of novel porous metal-organic frameworks.3 Recently, the groups of Kitagawa, Seki, Kim, Chen, and Hupp have been particularly interested in pillared frameworks for their functional properties and dynamic fea- tures.4 The so-called “pillaring” strategy in designing metal- organic open frameworks involves using appropriate bidentate spacer ligands acting as pillars to connect with well-deﬁned two- dimensional (2D) layers either in a one-pot reaction or in two separate steps. The advantage of this synthetic method is that it promises to produce a wide variety of porous MOF materials with structures that can be predicted and tunable pore sizes. It has been demonstrated that such a method to obtain pillar- layered structures, analogous to natural clays and zeolites, is rational and effective for the construction of three-dimensional porous frameworks.5 In previous work,6 we have brieﬂy reported on the synthesis and characterization of a three-dimensional network structure Cd3(CTC)2(TED)(H2O)2·(H3O)2Cl2 (1) (CTC ) cis,cis-1,3,5- cyclohexanetricarboxylate and TED ) triethylenediamine) which has 2-fold alternate (6,3) Cd3(CTC)2 layers connected by TED acting as a linear pillar ligand. This possesses channels with a 7.2 × 8.4 Å2 cross-section and exhibits substantial water adsorption behavior. CTC seems an encouraging organic linker, exhibiting a variety of ﬂexible coordination forms as a saturated cyclic carboxylate.7 In this paper, we expand on this study to describe the syntheses and characterization of a family of coordination polymers Cd3(CTC)2(Bipy)(DMF)2·(DMF)(H2O)2 (2),Cd3(CTC)2(Bpe)(DMF)2·(DMF)(H2O)2(3),Zn3(CTC)2(Bipy)·- (DMF)(H2O)2 (4), and Zn3(CTC)2(Bpe)·(DMF)(H2O)2 (5) [Bipy ) 4,4′-bipyridine; Bpe ) trans-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene, and DMF ) N,N′-dimethylformamide], having a 3D noninterpenetrating network structure with similar 2-fold alternate (6,3) [M3(CTC)2] (M2+ ) Cd2+ or Zn2+) layers pillared by the Bipy or Bpe ligand. The water sorption and luminescent properties have been investigated. Meanwhile, compounds 1–5 could be described as a binodal (3,8)-connected net with 8-connected (trinuclear SBU of M3(CO2)6N2) and 3-connected (CTC ligand) nodes, and its Schläﬂi symbol is (43)2(46·618·84).

The structures of 1–5 are all 3D periodic frameworks where the carboxylate groups of CTC ligands coordinate to the metal centers in at least two of the following modes: bridging unidentate, chelating bidentate, chelating/ bridging bidentate, and bidentate (Chart 1). Cd3(CTC)2(TED)(H2O)2·(H3O)2Cl2 (1). X-ray crystallog- raphy reveals that 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, space group C2221 (no. 20). The fundamental building unit of 1 contains three cadmium ions, six crystallographically equiva- lent CTC ligands, two TED ligands, and two coordinated H2O molecules (Figure 1). The Cd1 center is coordinated by ﬁve oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3A, O5B, and O6B) from three different CTC ligands and one nitrogen atom (N1) from one TED ligand. Different from Cd1, the Cd2 center is bound by four CTC ligands (O2, O1C, O3A, and O3D) and two terminal H2O molecules (O7 and O7A). Carefully examining the structure of complex 1, we ﬁnd that three octahedral Cd centers (Cd1, Cd2, and Cd1A) are bridged through six carboxyl groups, two in mode A, two in mode B, and two in mode C, respectively, to form an edged-sharing metallic trinuclear secondary building unit [Cd3(CO2)6N2] with a sandwiched structure (Figure 2a). First, Cd1 centers link CTC ligands to form an inﬁnite 2D (6,3) network with about 9.6 × 9.6 Å2 channels running along the ab plane (Figure 2b). The octahedral coordination geometries of Cd2 centers connect two adjacent networks above to create a neutral alternating 2-fold (6,3) network [Cd3(CTC)2] (Figure 2c). The independent TED ligand acts as a pillar to support the inﬁnite 2-fold alternate (6,3) layers vertically generating a layer- pillared 3D structure with open channels of approximately 7.2 × 8.4 Å2 along the a axis and 7.2 × 7.8 Å2 along the [110] Table 1.

X-ray crystallography reveals that 2 crystallizes in the triclinic system, space group P1j (no. 2). The fundamental building unit of 2 contains three cadmium ions, six crystallographically equivalent CTC ligands, two Bipy ligands, and two coordinated DMF molecules (Figure 3a). The Cd1 center is bound by three CTC ligands (O1, O3B, O4B, and O6D), one Bipy ligand (N1), and one terminal DMF molecule (O7).

All the SBUs further link with each other through cyclohexyl groups of CTC ligands to form a 2D 2-fold alternate (6,3) layer [Cd3(CTC)2] (Figure 4b). Then, adjacent (6,3) layers are pillared by the longer Bipy spacers into a noninterpenetrated 3D microporous MOF structure with channels of 11.3 × 8.4 Å2 along the a axis and of 11.3 × 7.8 Å2 along the b axis (Figures 4c and S3 (in the Supporting Information)). The channels are ﬁlled with two coordinated DMFs, one guest DMF, and two guest H2O molecules as established by elemental analysis and TGA.10 We expected that the longer pillar linker Bpe would lead to the larger pores. X-ray crystallography reveals that the structure of 3 is similar to that of 2, and 3 crystallizes in the triclinic system, space group P1j (no. 2). The fundamental building unit of 3 contains three cadmium ions, six crystallographically equivalent CTC ligands, two Bpe ligands, and two coordinated DMF molecules (Figure 3b). As a consequence, the Bpe ligand acts as a pillar to support the inﬁnite 2-fold alternate (6,3) layers along the c axis to lead to an extended open 3D framework with channels of 13.5 × 8.4 Å2 along the a axis and of 13.5 × 7.8 Å2 along the b axis (Figures 4d and S4 (in the Supporting Information)). The channels are ﬁlled with two coordinated DMFs, one guest DMF, and two guest H2O molecules as established by elemental analysis and TGA.11 Zn3(CTC)2(Bipy) · (DMF)(H2O)2 (4) and Zn3(CTC)2- (Bpe)·(DMF)(H2O)2 (5). The trinuclear Zn3 SBUsas a mo- lecular cluster12sis known in many complexes, such as MOF-3 and [Zn3(BDC)3(H2O)2] · 4DMF.13 The structures of 4 and 5 reveal that the frameworks are composed of the typical Zn3 cluster units. Different from the foregoing trinuclear Cd3 cluster, the low-coordination number of zinc is helpful to avoid the unfavorable terminal coordination and to create larger channels. X-ray crystallography reveals that 4 crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group C2/m (no. 12). The fundamental building unit of 4 contains three zinc ions, six crystallographi- cally equivalent CTC ligands, and two Bipy ligands (Figure 5a). The Zn1 center is coordinated by three oxygen atoms (O1, O4, and O4B) from three different CTC ligands and one nitrogen atom (N1) from one Bipy ligand. Different from Zn1, the Zn2 center is bound by six CTC ligands (O1, O1A, O3, O3B, O3C, and O3D). As shown in Figure 6a, there are three Zn centers (Zn1, Zn2, and Zn1A), bound to six carboxylate groups. Here, the Zn1 center is a four-coordinated tetrahedron, the Zn2 center is a six-coordinated octahedron, and these carboxylate groups coordinate the Zn centers by mode A and mode D, which lead to a corner-sharing metallic trinuclear SBU [Zn3(CO2)6N2]. All the SBUs further link with each other through cyclohexyl groups Figure 3. ORTEP drawings (at 50% probability) of the coordination environments of cadmium ions in (a) 2 and (b) 3.

The independent Bipy ligand acts as a pillar to generate a layer-pillared 3D structure with a pore size of about 11.3 × 8.4 Å2 along the b axis and of 11.3 × 4 Å2 along the a axis (Figures 6c and S5 (in the Supporting Information)). The channels are ﬁlled with one guest DMF and two guest H2O molecules as established by elemental analysis and TGA.14 X-ray crystallography reveals that the structure of 5 is similar to that of 4, and 5 crystallizes in the triclinic system, space group P1 (no. 1). The fundamental building unit of 5 contains three zinc ions, six crystallographically equivalent CTC ligands, and two Bpe ligands (Figure 5b). As a consequence, the Bpe ligand acts as a pillar to support the inﬁnite 2-fold alternate (6,3) layers along the c axis to lead to an extended open 3D framework with channels of 13.5 × 8.4 Å2 along the a axis and of 13.5 × 7.6 Å2 along the [110] direction (Figures 6d and S6 (in the Supporting Information)). The channels are ﬁlled with one guest DMF and two guest H2O molecules as established by elemental analysis and TGA.15 Better insight into the nature of MOFs can be achieved by the application of the topological approach, i.e., reducing a multidimensional structure to simple node-and-linker nets. To determine the topology of 1–5 based on the guideline presented above, each trinuclear SBU which is coordinated by six carboxylate groups from six separated CTC ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two linear N-donor ligands, respectively, can be considered as an 8-connected node. Similarly, each CTC ligating with three SBUs can act as a 3-connected node and a pillaring N-donor ligand ligating with two SBUs only serves as a bridged ligand. On the basis of the simpliﬁcation principle, it should be noted that the network topologies of 1–5 are identical. Upon careful examination, we ﬁnd that the M(Cd/ Zn)-carboxylate layer has a 2-fold alternate 63 honeycomb topology (Figure 7a) which prevents an interpenetrating structure from forming. The resulting structure of compounds 1–5 is a binodal (3,8)-connected net with two 3-connected nodes (CTC ligands) and one 8-connected (trinuclear SBUs) node and a Schläﬂi symbol of (43)2(46·618·84) (the ﬁrst symbol represents the CTC ligand, and the second, the trinuclear SBU; Figure 7b).16 The coordination geometries of Cd2+ in compounds 1–3 are slightly different from those of Zn2+ in compounds 4 and 5 in which the Cd2+ is octahedrally coordinated whereas the Zn2+ is both octahedrally and tetrahedrally coordinated. The extra two coordination sites around Cd2+ are occupied by the terminal solvent molecules (H2O or DMF) in compounds 1–3, allowing them to maintain the same framework topologies as those of compounds 4 and 5. Water Sorption Properties of Complexes 1–5. To study adsorption properties, the water adsorption isotherms of 1–5 were measured at room temperature (ca. 20 °C), respectively. Before the measurement, the samples of 1–5 were soaked in Figure 6. Crystal structures of 4 and 5. (a) Representation of a corner- sharing inorganic SBU [Zn3(CO2)6N2].

The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of exchanged samples of 1–5 were identical to that of as-synthesized samples, only with slightly weakened intensity, respectively, which indicates that the departure of the guest molecules does not lead to a phase transformation. As shown in Figure 8, the water sorption isotherms exhibit two uptakes. In all cases the water sorption isotherms revealed type I isotherms in the range about P/P0 ) 0-0.70, which clearly indicates that incoming guests can move freely into the channels and the frameworks maintain their rigidity and porosity through- out the process. The second increase in the range above P/P0 > 0.70 is attributed to sorption on the external crystallite surface, which is similar to some reported MOFs.17 At the ﬁrst saturation, the amounts of 1–5 adsorbed are 72, 101, 116, 172, and 189 mg/g for H2O, respectively, which are equivalent to the adsorption of about 15, 6, 7, 15, and 9 H2O molecules per unit cell. Therefore, the pore volumes are estimated to be app- roximately 0.07, 0.10, 0.12, 0.17, and 0.19 mL/g for compounds 1–5, respectively, by the water adsorption isotherms, which is comparable to those found in many zeolites.18 The increased water adsorption activity is consistent with the larger effective channel sizes of these complexes, which clearly shows that using longer ligands can produce porous materials with higher adsorption capacities. To encourage permanent microporosity, synthetic strategies must avoid channel clogging: such as excessive framework interpenetration or unfavorable terminal coordination. In compounds 1-5, the 2-fold alternate (6,3) M(Cd/Zn)-carboxylate layers have proven to be sufﬁciently effective to prohibit the interpenetrated structure. In addition, water sorption studies reveal that the adsorption in complexes 4 and 5 is higher than that in 2 and 3, which shows that the avoidance of terminal coordination solvent molecules has positive effects on the adsorption capacity: a decrease of sample mass, a decrease of sample density, and an increase of available micropore volume.19 Photoluminescent Properties. The photoluminescent spectra of the free CTC ligand, Bipy ligand, Bpe ligand, and compounds 1-5 have been investigated in the solid state at room temper- ature (Figure 9). The emission band for free CTC ligand is at 570 nm excited at 396 nm, which may be attributed to the π* f n transition.20 The emission band for free Bipy ligand is at 437 nm excited at 357 nm and that of free Bpe ligand is at 445 nm excited at 361 nm, which could be attributed to the π* f π transition. In addition, the free TED ligand does not emit any luminescence in the range 400–700 nm. An intense emission peak of compound 1 is found at 522 nm with an excitation band at 235 nm, which is blue-shifted 48 nm compared with that of the pure CTC ligand. Unlike compound 1, when excited by 358 nm light, compound 2 exhibits a main band at 449 nm, which is red-shifted compared with that of the pure Bipy ligand, and a shoulder band at 550 nm, which is blue-shifted compared with that of the pure CTC ligand. Compound 3 exhibits a main emission band at 453 nm and a shoulder band at 556 nm excited at 345 nm. The emission spectrum for 4 shows a main band at 447 nm and a shoulder band at 552 nm with λex ) 387 nm. Compound 5 has a main band at 456 nm and a shoulder band at 560 nm with λex ) 338 nm.

Therefore, these compounds could ﬁnd applications as potential ﬂuorescent porous materials. Conclusions We have successfully synthesized and characterized a series of novel 3D porous metal-organic frameworks in which metallic trinuclear secondary building units [M3(CO2)6N2] (M2+ ) Cd2+ or Zn2+) are connected by ﬂexible CTC ligands and length-controllable diamine pillars. The metal-CTC-diamine synthetic strategy allows a systematical variation of the metal or the pillar to construct a series of open frameworks without changing the topology. The comparison of pore size, water adsorption data, and luminescence properties for compounds 1–5 are summarized in Table 3. The water adsorption isotherms show type Ι behavior with approximately 0.07, 0.10, 0.12, 0.17, and 0.19 mL/g pore volumes, respectively. Photoluminescence investigations reveal that they display strong emission in the blue/green regions. Considering the water adsorption and ﬂuorescent properties, these materials can be anticipated as having potential applications as multifunctional materials. Acknowledgment.
