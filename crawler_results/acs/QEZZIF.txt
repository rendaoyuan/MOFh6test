For the preparation of a ferromagnetic porous coordination polymer, an octacyanometalate-based assemble is a suitable system because an octacyanometalate complex has many exchange pathways owing to its high coordination numbers.3 In this work, we prepared a ferromagnetic porous coordination polymer, Cu3[W(CN)8]2- (pyrimidine)2‚8H2O (1). Herein, we report the reversible variations in the crystal structure and magnetic properties of 1 upon exposure to n-propanol vapor. Compound 1 was prepared by adding an aqueous solution of CsI3[WV(CN)8]‚2H2O4 to a mixed aqueous solution of CuIICl2‚2H2O and pyrimidine at room temperature. A single crystal for X-ray structural analysis was prepared by a diffusion method. Elemental analyses confirmed that the formula is Cu3[W(CN)8]2(pyrimidine)2‚ 8H2O: (calcd) Cu, 14.9; W, 28.7; C, 22.5; H, 1.9; N, 21.9%; (found) Cu, 15.1; W, 28.7; C, 22.7; H, 1.7; N, 22.2%. Single-crystal structural analysis reveals that 1 consists of a three-dimensional cyanide-bridged network, in which Cu and W ions are linked in alternating fashion (orthorhombic, Ibam, a ) 11.419(2), b ) 24.830- (4), c ) 30.005(4) Å, and Z ) 8) (Figure 1a, left).5 The coordination geometry of W is an 8-coordinated bicapped trigonal prism and six CN groups of [W(CN)8] are bridged to Cu2+ ions. The other two CN groups are free. The geometries of the two types of Cu2+ ions (Cu1 and Cu2) are 6-coordinated pseudo-octahedron, that is, Cu1 is coordinated to four cyanide nitrogen atoms and two nitrogen atoms in pyrimidine molecules, and Cu2 is coordinated to four cyanide nitrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms in the water ligands (Figure 1a, right). This crystal has a cavity which is occupied by zeolitic water molecules. We investigated the sensitivity to n-propanol vapor using 1 in the powder-form. When 1 is exposed to n-propanol vapor (11.5 Torr, 82% relative to saturated vapor) at room temperature, the sample changes from green to yellowish brown (2). As for IR spectra, the CN peak at 2203 cm-1 of 1 decreases and a new CN peak appears at 2190 cm-1. In 2, the IR peaks due to the incorporated n-propanol molecules are also observed in the region of 950-1080 cm-1 (Supporting Information, Figure S3). Elemental analyses showed that the formula of 2 is Cu3[W(CN)8]2(pyrimidine)2‚ 3/2PrOH‚9/4H2O.6 When 2 is exposed to water vapor (17.5 Torr, 100% RH), the IR spectrum is recovered. X-ray diffraction measurement shows the reversible variation of the crystal structure. The orthorhombic structure (space group ) Ibam) in 1 is converted to an orthorhombic structure (space group ) Pmmn) in 2 (Figure S4). To investigate the n-propanol sensitivity, a crystal structure of 2 was measured. Compound 2 consists of a three-dimensional cyanide-bridged network (orthorhombic, Pmmn, a ) 14.761(2), b ) 25.593(4), c ) 11.5284(19) Å, and Z ) 4) (Figure 1b, left).7 The coordination geometries of W is 8-coordinated bicapped trigonal prism. The geometry of Cu2 is 5-coordinated square pyramidal which is bridged to four cyanide nitrogen atoms and † Department of Chemistry, School of Science, The University of Tokyo. ‡ Department of Applied Chemistry, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo. § Rigaku Corporation.

The n-propanol molecules locate in the cavity. The significant difference between 1 and 2 is the coordination geometry of Cu2, that is, 6-coordinate for 1 and 5-coordinate for 2. The magnetic properties also change when 1 is exposed to n-propanol vapor. The product of the magnetic susceptibility and temperature (øMT) at 293 K changes from 2.22 cm3 K mol-1 for 1 to 1.99 cm3 K mol-1 for 2. The field-cooled magnetization (FCM) curve for powder-form 1 shows a spontaneous magnetization with a Curie temperature (Tc) of 9.5 K and then the magnetization decreases around 7.5 K (Figure 2a). The magnetization vs external magnetic field (M-H) curve for 1 at 2 K shows a saturation magnetization (Ms) value of 3.5 µB (Figure S6) for a given formula, and the magnetic hysteresis loop shows a coercive field (Hc) of 30 G (Figure 2b). The FCM curve of 2 has a Tc value at 12.0 K and then spontaneous magnetization monotonously increases (Figure 2a). The M-H curve of 2 shows that the Ms and Hc values are 3.6 µB (Figure S6) and 1000 G (Figure 2b) at 2 K, respectively. As shown in Figures 2a and 2b, the magnetic properties of 2 are recovered to those of 1 by exposing to water vapor. On the basis of the structural difference between 1 and 2, we considered the role of n-propanol in the change of the magnetic properties. The Ms values of 3.5 µB for 1 and 3.6 µB for 2 indicate that these materials have a magnetic ordering, which consists of positive magnetizations for Cu1 (S ) 1/2) and W (S ) 1/2) and a negative magnetization for Cu2 (S ) 1/2) against an applied magnetic field, that is, Ms ) 2(2SCu1 + 2SW - SCu2). Hence, two types of exchange couplings, a ferromagnetic (Cu1-NC-W) and antiferromagnetic interaction (Cu2-NC-W), exist. Ferromagnetic Cu1-NC-W exchange coupling is assumed to be fixed at a particular positive value, since Cu1-NC-W geometry does not change between 1 and 2. In contrast, antiferromagnetic Cu2- NC-W exchange coupling is considered to vary between 1 and 2 because Cu2 geometry changes from 6-coordinate to 5-coordinate. Along this scenario, using molecular-field theory8 with particular exchange values, the observed Tc values and the shapes of FCM curves are qualitatively reproduced (Figure S7). In magnetic porous coordination polymers,9 new magnetic functionalities are expected to be achieved, for example, magnetic gas-sensing and magnetic molecular recognizing. In the present work, we have prepared a ferromagnetic porous coordination polymer, Cu3[W(CN)8]2(pyrimidine)2‚8H2O. This material responds to n-propanol vapor. We are currently measuring the response with other alcohols (methanol and ethanol). Acknowledgment.

In this system, the molecular fields, HCu1, HCu2, and HW, which act on the three sublattice sites (MCu1, MCu2, and MW), are expressed as follows: HCu1 = H 0 + nCu1W MW, HCu2 = H 0 + nCu2W MW, and HW = H0 + nCu1WMCu1 + nCu2WMCu2, H0 is the external magnetic field, and nij are various molecular field coefficients relating to the exchange coefficients (Jij). A Brillouin function was used to evaluate the sublattice magnetizations and the total magnetization (Mtotal = MCu1 + MCu2 + MW) as a function of temperature. Figure S7a shows the calculated Mtotal vs T curve with JCu1W = +3.3 and JCu2W = –0.4 cm-1. The calculated curve qualitatively reproduces the shape of the observed FCM curve of 1, i.e., the unusual hill at an intermediate temperature. The behavior is caused by the growth of the negative sublattice magnetization of MCu2 at low temperature, which is due to the weak exchange coupling of Cu2-W. Although the structure of the cyanide-bridged Cu1-W is nearly maintained, the coordination geometry of Cu2 changes 6-coordinate for 1 to 5-coordinate for 2. Assuming that the value of JCu1W is fixed at +3.3 cm-1, the magnetization vs temperature curve for 2 is calculated. The calculated curve reproduces the Tc value of 12 K and the shape of FCM curve when JCu2W = –3.6 cm-1 (Figure S7b). Figure S7.
