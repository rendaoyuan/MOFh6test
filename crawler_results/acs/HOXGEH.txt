UniVersidad 1001, C.P. 62209 CuernaVaca, Me´xico ReceiVed December 2, 2008; ReVised Manuscript ReceiVed February 6, 2009 ABSTRACT: The metal-directed self-assembly of dimethyltin(IV) and homophthalate provided tetranuclear bis(tetraorganodistannoxane) secondary building units (SBUs), which in the solid state are linked to a three-dimensional honeycomb architecture having hexameric channels with diameters of 5.2 Å. These channels are occupied by water clusters of composition {H2O}x (with x ) 12-14) that have adamantane-type structures as they are found in the cubic ice modiﬁcation. Supramolecular synthesis consists of the combination of properly designed building blocks to functional architectures through non- covalent interactions such as coordinative bonds, hydrogen bonds, or π· · ·π interactions, and has been extensively explored for the preparation of macrocyclic, cage-like, and inﬁnite one-, two-, and three-dimensional (1D, 2D, and 3D) structures.1 Metal-organic systems can be assembled either from single-metal ion nodes or from more complex building units containing two or more metal centers. Such secondary building units (SBUs) are frequently employed for the generation of non-interpenetrating porous materi- als having high thermal stability, which makes them attractive targets for applications related to separation, storage, transport, and catalysis.2 Among the main group elements that have received the most attention for metal-directed self-assembly is tin.1a,3 Thereby, organometallic tin derivatives are particularly interesting since the organic groups attached to the tin atoms allow the modiﬁcation of the structure and functionality of the resulting supramolecular network. So far, systems derived from tin SBUs are almost unexplored,3b albeit several research groups have shown previously that dimeric dicarboxylatotetraorganodistannoxanes are proper for the generation of macrocycles,4 cryptands,5 and 1D, 2D, and 3D coordination polymers.6 Making a further contribution to this ﬁeld,7 herein we describe the ﬁrst porous 3D coordination polymer assembled from a bis(tetraorganodistannoxane) SBU and a dicar- boxylate linker (homophthalate). The title compound was prepared at room temperature from a 1:1 stoichiometric mixture of dimethyltin dichloride and the dipotassium salt of hphtH2 in a 9:1 solvent mixture of methanol and water (Scheme 1). The product was obtained as a microcrys- talline solid at a yield of 34% and has been characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and single-crystal X-ray crystallography. These analyses showed that the title compound is a 3D coordination polymer of the composition {[(Me2SnOSnMe2)(µ3- hpht)]2·4.33H2O}n.8 The IR data show that both carboxylate groups are coordinated to the tin metal centers. First, because there are no bands in the region for stretching and deformation vibrations of hydroxyl groups, which are present in the starting material (νO-H ) 2624 and 2538 cm-1; δO-H ) 966 cm-1), and, second, because the spectrum shows strong bands in the region typical for anisobidentate or bridging carboxylate groups (νas(OCO) ) 1590 and 1551 cm-1; νs(OCO) ) 1395 and 1365 cm-1).7 Moreover, a broad absorption band at 3446 cm-1 indicates the presence of uncoordinated water. The crystalline material of the title compound has an uncommon spherical shape similar to that described by Clearﬁeld and co- workers for Sn(O3PC6H5)2,3e and has been therefore examined by SEM.

Such a fusion seems to be a reasonable phenomenon for 3D coordination polymers having ﬂexible spacer groups, thus allowing for bonding between the crystal lattices of the corresponding microcrystallites (vide infra). Since part of the crystalline material contained monocrystalline blocks of larger size, it was possible to separate a single-crystal that could be examined by X-ray diffraction analysis.9 This experiment revealed that the microcrystalline blocks consist of a 3D coordination polymer that crystallized in the trigonal spacegroup R3j. Figure 2 shows the bis(tetramethyldistannoxane) SBU from which the inﬁnite solid-state structure is constructed. This fragment has inversion symmetry and, therefore, labels are given only for the asymmetric unit. The central tetranuclear bis(distannoxane) fragment, {[Me2Sn(µ3-O)SnMe2]2}, which is connected through Sn-O bonds with distances ranging from 2.024(2) to 2.158(2) Å, is coordinated to the carboxylate groups of four different hpht ligands. Of these, the CPh-COO functions act as syn-syn isobi- dentate bridges between neighboring tin atoms (Sn1-O3 ) 2.299(2) Å; Sn2-O4 ) 2.236(2) Å), whereas the CH2COO functions are coordinated only to one tin atom in an anisobidentate coordination mode (Sn1-O1 ) 2.170(2) Å; Sn1· · ·O2 ) 2.757(2) Å). Since there is an additional weak secondary interaction between O1 and Sn2′ (3.008(2) Å), both tin atoms have similar distorted monocapped trigonal-bipyramidal {C2SnO4} coordination geometries, in which the methyl groups occupy equatorial positions. The C-Sn-C bond angles are 137.73(14) and 145.12(15)°, and agree well with those reported for bis(tetraorganodistannoxanes) derived from monocar- boxylate ligands.10 The inﬂuence of the secondary O· · ·Sn interac- tions (O2· · ·Sn1 and O1· · ·Sn2′) can be seen also from the O-Sn-O bond angles formed between the oxygen atoms located in axial positions (O1-Sn1-O3 ) 172.26(9)°; O4-Sn2-O5′ ) 164.42(9)°). In the crystal lattice, six of the above-described SBUs form unique 48-membered macrocyclic rings of the composition {[C5O2Sn]6} (Figure 3), which are structurally somewhat related to a series of previously reported hexanuclear organotin macrocycles derived from 3-thiopropionic acid, thiosalicylic acid, and 3,5-di- iso-propylsalicylic acid.11 The distance between neighboring tin atoms is 6.25 Å, and the trannsannular Sn· · ·Sn distance is 12.42 Å. Within the macrocyclic ring, the tin atoms adopt a chairlike conformation, thus orienting the SBUs alternately above and below the ring plane. Since each SBU participates in the formation of two hexanuclear tin macrocycles, ondulated honeycomb-type layers emerge (Figure 3b), which are further interconnected in an ABAB... fashion to an overall 3D polymer (Figure 3c,d). To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second 3D distannoxane-based frame- work. The ﬁrst has been assembled recently under hydrothermal conditions by Ma and co-workers from chiral cis-(1R,3S)-(+)- camphoric acid and trimethyltin chloride.6e It can be assumed that the semirigid nature of the ligand plays an important role in the assembly of this 3D stucture. Since the CH2COO group can adopt a whole range of different spatial orientations with respect to the rigid CPhCOO group, hpht2- seems to be an ideal ligand for the creation of supramolecular structures, which require nonstandard bonding angles (i.e., 60, 90, 109, 120, and 180 °) between the metal-coordinating functions. A revision of the CSD12 showed that there are only few entries for metal-organic assemblies derived from hphtH2 so far.13 The ligand ﬂexibility might be also responsible for the spherical organization of the microcrystalline material, since free-rotating pendant car- boxylate groups at the crystal surface can cause defects during the crystallization process and allow for an interconnection of micro- crystallites. The controlled linkage of microcrystallites to macro- scopic entities deserves further exploration, since it might allow for the generation of materials with interesting physical and chemical properties. The channels formed along axis c have diameters of ap- proximately 5.2 Å, and it is important to note that the inner walls are lined with oxygen atoms (Figure 4). It is therefore not surprising to ﬁnd that the pores are occupied by water molecules, which form clusters having the composition {H2O}12, {H2O}13, and {H2O}14 (Figure 5).14,15 All three arrangements are fragments of the cubic ice modiﬁcation, which at standard pressure is only stable at temperatures below -120 °C.16c While the {H2O}12 cluster can be described as a six-membered chair having six pendant water molecules in the axial positions, the {H2O}13 and {H2O}14 cages are extended adamantane-type arrangements of the water molecules. It should be noticed that there are relatively few structural reports on adamantane-type water clusters so far.16 Figure 2.

Ellipsoids in (a) are shown at the 50% probability level. Figure 4. Spaceﬁlling model of the title compound showing the channels formed along axis c. 1652 Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 9, No. 4, 2009 Communications Within the {H2O}x clusters, the O· · ·O distances vary from 2.84 to 2.89 Å, and are similar to those found for bulk liquid water (2.85 Å) and other previously reported water clusters.15-17 The OW · · ·OW · · ·OW bond angles vary from 98.2 to 120.4° and are signiﬁcantly different from the tetrahedral angle found in ice Ih and Ic, thus indicating that the adamantane-type clusters are distorted. In order to evaluate the thermal stability of the title compound, a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out. After an initial weight loss of approximately 3.8% within the temperature range of 40-100 °C, there was no further substantial weight change until a temperature of 220 °C, at which decomposition began. This result indicates that only a partial loss of the water molecules located within the porous channels occurred (calculated for 2.33 of the 4.33 equiv of water molecules per SBU: 3.9%). This can be probably attributed to the fact that the remaining 2 equiv of water molecules are retained through strong hydrogen-bonding interactions and/or O· · ·Sn coordination bonds within the diorganotin carboxylate framework. That penta- and hexacoordinated diorganotin dicar- boxylates can enhance their coordination number through coordina- tion to water molecules has been shown previously.7 In order to examine if the crystal lattice does resist the partial elimination of guest molecules without collapsing, we heated part of the crystalline material for 1 h at 180 °C under a vacuum (approximately 10-2 Torr). The experiment showed that this thermal treatment did not destroy the crystallinity of the material, since the unit cell of the crystals remained unchanged (several crystals were examined). In conclusion, this contribution shows that organotin-containing SBUs are suitable for the generation of porous materials. Since three parameters can be varied for coordination polymers formed from organotin clusters, (i) the metal-coordinating function (car- boxylate, sulfonate, phosphonate, etc.), (ii) the organic spacer between the metal-coordinating carboxylate groups, and (iii) the organic groups attached to the tin atoms, such architectures might have advantages over other systems, for example, with respect to pore-size tuning or the generation of chiral cavities.

Elemental analyses have been carried on a Perkin Elmer Series II 2400 instrument. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed under nitrogen (50 mL/Min) with a heating rate of 10 °Cmin-1 using a TA SDT Q600 apparatus. SEM images were taken with a LEO 1450 VP equipment. Preparative part: Me2SnCl2 and homophthalic acid were commercially available and have been used without further purification. Preparation of {[(Me2SnOSnMe2)(µµµµ3-hpht)]2}n For the preparation of compound 1, homophthalic acid (0.077 g, 0.43 mmol) and two equivalents of potassium hydroxide (0.048 g, 0.85 mmol) were dissolved in a 9:1 mixture of methanol and water (15 mL), whereupon one equivalent of dimethyltin dichloride (0.094 g, 0.43 mmol) dissolved in methanol (5 mL) was added. A white microcrystalline precipitate formed that was insoluble in common organic solvents. Yield: 0.039 g (34 %). Mp >220 ºC (dec.).

X-ray Crystallography X-ray diffraction studies were performed on a Bruker-APEX diffractometer with a CCD area detector (λΜοΚα = 0.71073 Å, monochromator: graphite). Frames were collected at T = 100 K via ω/φ-rotation at 10 s per frame (BRUKER-SMART). The measured intensities were reduced to F2 and corrected for absorption with SADABS (BRUKER-SAINT-NT). Corrections were made for Lorentz and polarization effects. Structure solution, refinement and data output were carried out with the BRUKER SHELXTL-NT program package. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, while hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions using a riding model. There are three independent water molecules within the solvent channels, S3 of which one (O33) is localized at the  axis and disordered over two positions (occ. factor 0.167). The O-H hydrogen atoms for the water molecules could not be localized by difference Fourier maps. Therefore, only the oxygen atoms have been refined. Molecular structures were illustrated by the SHELXTL-NT software package and MERCURY. SEM images The compound was spread on an adhesive ribbon, covered with a layer of Au/Pd and then analyzed with the SEM. S4 2. Tables with geometric parameters of the title compound.
