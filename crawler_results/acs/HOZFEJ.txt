Compounds 1 and 2 feature the same framework composition but diﬀerent guest-controlled structures and topology. Compound 4 consists of a unique undecanuclear Li carboxylate complex {Li11(H2O)5(RCOO)18} and contains pores with diameter 7 Å. Furthermore, compound 4 demonstrates highly pronounced guest-dependent photoluminescence behavior: nitrobenzene completely quenches the light emission, while toluene enhances it. ■INTRODUCTION Porous metal−organic frameworks are one of the most rapidly expanding areas of modern chemistry due to very prominent application capabilities in adsorption, separation, catalysis, sensing, etc.1,2 In particular, recent demonstrations of high CH4 and H2 storage in porous metal−organic frameworks3 are very encouraging since these gases are recognized to be mobile fuels for today and tomorrow. The gravimetric gas uptake value is directly dependent on the density of the porous material; therefore, the assembly of light metal-based porous coordina- tion frameworks is a straightforward strategy to enhance gas storage.4 In this context, lithium is unquestionably the metal of choice since it is the lightest metal, is relatively abundant, and has low toxicity. Among several dozen Li-based coordination polymers with structurally robust ligands known to date, only a few structures possess micropores suﬃcient for reversible encapsulation of small organic molecules and gas adsorption.5 On the other hand, coordination complexes based on diamagnetic metal cations and aromatic ligands often display strong ligand-centered luminescence. Extension of such complexes into regular coordination frameworks is a plain approach toward new materials combining both luminescence properties and uniform porosity. Indeed, many such com- pounds do demonstrate luminescence dependent on the nature or composition of the guest molecules.6,7 Therefore, the synthesis and characterization of new porous metal−organic frameworks with luminescent properties, suited for potential sensing applications, is highly important both academically and practically. In the current work, we describe ﬁve new 3D lithium− organic frameworks with diﬀerent robust carboxylate ligands: [Li2(H2pml)]·C4H8O2 (1), [Li2(H2pml)] (2), [Li(H2tatab)]· 5H2O (3), [Li11(H3O)(H2O)5(Html)6]·8C4H8O2 (4), and [Li{Li(nmp)}{Li(H2O)(nmp)}{Li(nmp)2}2(H2tms)(Htms)2]· NMP·EtOH (5), where H4pml = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic or pyromellitic acid, H3tatab = 4,4′,4″-s-triazine-1,3,5-triyltri- p-aminobenzoic acid, H3tml = 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic or trimellitic acid, H3tms = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic or trimesic acid, and nmp = 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. Compounds 1 and 3 have open framework structures. Compound 4 consists of unique undecanuclear Li−carboxylate units and features relatively wide 7 Å channels allowing the facile exchange of solvent molecules. Most interestingly, the framework luminescence was found to be highly dependent on the nature of those guest molecules: toluene enhances the light emission intensity, while nitrobenzene completely quenches it.

Single crystal X-ray diﬀraction data of 1−5 were collected at 150 K on a Bruker Apex Duo automatic four-circle diﬀractometer equipped with an area detector (Mo Kα, λ = 0.71073 Å, graphite monochromator, φ and ω scans). Data collection, frame integration, and data processing were performed with the use of the APEX2 and SAINT program packages.11 The absorption correction was applied based on the intensities of equivalent reﬂections with the use of the SADABS program.11 The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned on F2 by full- matrix least-squares method in the anisotropic approximation (for non-hydrogen atoms) using the SHELX-97 program package.12 Positions of hydrogen atoms of organic ligands were calculated geometrically and reﬁned by the riding model. The hydrogen atoms of water molecules were not located. X-ray data collections have been performed for several crystals of 5. The data given for structure 5 in the paper are the best we could achieve. Apparently, lower quality of X-ray data of 5 is due to nonideal crystal quality and disordering in the guest subsystem. Free solvent accessible volume was calculated by PLATON13 standard technique of ﬁlling the cavities with probe spheres of radius 1.2 Å. A summary of the crystallographic data and structural determination for 1−5 is provided in Table 1. Selected bond Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg500477s | Cryst. Growth Des.

All Li− organic coordination polymers were synthesized by solvother- mal methods. In the typical syntheses, mixed solvent systems of alcohol and aprotic polar solvent were used. As a lithium source, LiOH was chosen to facilitate the deprotonation of the carboxylic acids. All reactions were carried out at 80−100 °C, and increase of the temperatures did not give any improve- ments in the yields. Crystal Structure of [Li2(H2pml)]·C4H8O2 (1). The solvothermal reaction of LiOH and H4pml in methanol/ dioxane mixture at 80 °C results in a crystalline precipitate, the structure of which was solved by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Li+ cation and one benzenetetracarboxylate anion. Two hydrogen atoms were found on the partially deprotonated H2pml2−ligands with intramolecular hydrogen bonds (d(O···O) = 2.392(1) Å) between neighboring carboxylate groups (Figure 1). Lithium cations have tetrahedral coordination environment with four oxygen atoms of four diﬀerent H2pml2−ligands. The Li−O bond lengths (1.997(2) and 1.8798(19) Å) are common for carbo- xylate complexes of lithium with coordination number 4.14 The Li+ cations are connected through bridging μ2-RCOO-O,O′ groups into helical chains, running along the c crystal- lographic direction of the tetragonal unit cell (Figure 1). The H2pml2−organic ligands connect these chains into two other directions to form a regular 3D network where each H2pml2− anion coordinates eight Li+ cations. The resulting binodal 8,4-connected network has quite complicated topology, which could be described by point symbol (45.6)2(410.52.610.86) (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). Most interestingly, by looking at the structure along the c axis, we could identify straight square-shaped channels ca. 4.5 Å × 4.5 Å. Free solvent accessible volume in compound 1 derived from the PLATON routine analysis was found to be 38%. The channels are occupied by highly disordered 1,4-dioxane molecules that could not be modeled as a set of discrete atomic sites. We employed the PLATON/SQUEEZE11 procedure to calculate the contribution to the diﬀraction from the solvent region and thereby produced a set of solvent-free diﬀraction intensities. The ﬁnal formula of 1, [Li2(H2pml)]·C4H8O2, was derived from the SQUEEZE results (388e per unit cell) and elemental analysis. The thermogravi- metric data show steady 10% weight decrease upon heating to 230 °C corresponding to removal of 0.5 1,4-dioxane molecule per formula unit, followed by the framework decomposition (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Similarly, a prolonged vacuum activation of 1 at 80 °C only results in a partially activated material [Li2(H2pml)]·1/2C4H8O2 with a similar powder diﬀraction pattern as for the pristine compound 1 and an absence of N2 or CO2 gas adsorption (Figure S5, Supporting Information).15 Structure of [Li2(H2pml)] (2) and a Solvent Template Eﬀect. The crystalline precipitate 2 was obtained in high yield in the solvothermal reaction of H4pml with slight excess of LiOH in methanol/THF mixture at 80 °C. According to the X-ray crystallography data, the asymmetric unit of 2 contains Table 1.

Growth Des. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX C one Li+ cation and one H2pml2−anion. The Li centers adopt a tetrahedral coordination environment with four oxygen carboxylate atoms. The Li−O bond lengths (1.917(2)− 1.976(2) Å) found fall within the common values for tetrahedral carboxylate complexes of lithium. Two lithium cations are joined via two oxygen atoms of two bridging carbo- xylate groups forming a binuclear building unit, {Li2(μ2-RCOO)2- (RCOO)4} (Figure 2). Such Li2 units are connected to six independent organic ligands, while each ligand is connected to six {Li2} units. The overall six-connected 3D metal−organic network adopts a primitive cubic topology (pcu) or, more speciﬁcally, NaCl, emphasizing a diﬀerent nature of the alternating six- connected nodes (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The overall charge of the framework is neutral due to a partial protonation of organic ligands and a formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between neighboring carboxylate groups of H2pml2−ligand (d(O···O) = 2.469(1) Å). The metal−organic framework 2 is densely packed with no apparent solvent-accessible cavities. According to TGA, no weight loss is observed up to 120 °C (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Irreversible thermolysis takes place above 220 °C. Strikingly, both compounds 1 and 2 are topological isomers since they have the same composition of the metal−organic framework [Li2(H2pml)] but drastically diﬀerent structures. Both compounds were reproducibly isolated as phase pure crystalline materials with high yield and no indication of the alternative isomer, according to XRD or TGA data. Such high selectivity is especially remarkable considering very similar reaction conditions where the solvent composition is the only signiﬁcant distinction between two procedures. We can conjecture that the formation of open channels in 1 is strongly attributed to a guest molecule template eﬀect. Moreover, it must be very sensitive to the size of the endotemplate because THF molecules, having a similar nature but slightly smaller size than 1,4-dioxane, do not direct the self-assembly of the Li−carboxylate framework to an open structure, resulting in the nonporous 2. The template eﬀect phenomenon is one of the most fundamental in supramolecular synthesis of zeolites; however, for porous metal−organic 3D frameworks, such examples are rather uncommon16 since the design of coordination networks mostly relies on shape-persistent secondary building units with robust structure-directing coordina- tion geometries.17 Crystal Structure of [Li(H2tatab)]·5H2O (3). The metal− organic coordination polymer 3 was crystallized from the methanol/dioxane solution of LiOH and H3tatab ligand at 100 °C. The X-ray analysis revealed one Li+ cation and one H2tatab−anion per the monoclinic unit cell. Lithium cations are in tetrahedral coordination by four oxygen atoms of four diﬀerent H2tatab−ligands. The Li−O bond lengths (1.909(5)− 1.968(5) Å) found are typical for tetrahedral carboxylate complexes of lithium. Lithium cations are connected by bridging carboxylate groups into chain-like units, running along the a direction (Figure 3). Another monodentate protonated carboxylic group, RCOOH, is connected to each Li+ center, completing their tetrahedral environment. There is an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the OH function of the carboxylic groups and an oxygen atom of a bridging carboxylate with relatively short O···O interatomic distance 2.581(3) Å. Interestingly, only two of three carboxylic groups of the tatab ligands are connected to Li cations. The other protonated RCOOH group forms an intermolecular double H- bond with a complementary part of the other tatab ligand (Figure 3). The corresponding interatomic distances are 2.664(3) Å for N···H−O and 2.919(3) Å for N−H···O. The anionic H2tatab−ditopic ligands connect the Li−carboxylate chains into two other directions to form a 3D metal−organic coordination network with open structure and relatively wide channels of ca. 8 Å × 10 Å size, running along the a axis. The solvent accessible volume in 3 derived from PLATON analysis was calculated to be 31%. The interstitial part of the crystal structure is ﬁlled with disordered guest solvent molecules, which could be removed by heating. The calculated weight loss in the TG curve (14%) corresponds to a loss of 4.5 H2O molecules. The overall framework topology of 3 could be described as a rod-like net with a square-grid pattern of the interconnected organic ligands.18 Crystal Structure of (H3O)[Li11(H2O)5(Html)6]·8C4H8O2 (4). The heating of LiOH and trimellitic acid (H3tml) in ethylcellosolve/1,4-dioxane mixture produces colorless crystals in high yield the structure of which was investigated by X-ray crystallography. The asymmetric unit of 4 contains three Li cations and one partly protonated Html2−anion. Lithium cations are assembled into unprecedented undecanuclear {Li11} units5f through bridging oxygen atoms of the μ3-RCOO-O,O,O′ and μ2-RCOO-O carboxylate groups (Figure 4). These Figure 1.

The Li(2) cation features a tetragonal pyramidal coordination environ- ment containing ﬁve oxygen atoms of four Html2−anions (equatorial positions) and one aqua ligand (axial position). The Li(2)−O(carboxylate) bond lengths are 2.019(2) and 2.153(2) Å, which is typical for Li−O distances with the coordination number of Li+ being 5, while the Li(2)−O(H2O) bond length is somewhat shorter (1.920(7) Å).14 The third lithium cation is disordered over two half occupied positions (Li(3) and Li(4)) along the 3-fold axis. Both Li(3) and Li(4) have a tetrahedral coordination environment containing four oxygen atoms of three Html2−anions and one aqua-ligand. The H2O ligand of the Li(3) cation is located in the center of the {Li11} cage, while the H2O ligand of the Li(4) cation is directed outward from the {Li11} unit along the 3-fold axis. Since only one of the disordered Li(4) position exists in the polynuclear unit, the corresponding coordinated water molecules must be disordered over two half occupied symmetry related positions. The Li− O(carboxylate) bond lengths are 1.953(3) and 1.949(5) Å and the Li−O(H2O) distances are 1.87(1) or 1.74(2) Å for Li(3) and Li(4), respectively. Taking the disorder into account, the overall formula of the {Li11} complex unit could be written as {Li11(H2O)5(RCOO)18}. Each Html2−ligand connects two such units in a double bridge fashion (Figure 4). There are intermolecular hydrogen bonds between carboxylic groups of neighboring Html2−ligands with relatively short O···O distance 2.495(2) Å. Overall, each {Li11} complex is connected to six neighboring complexes via 12 bridging Html2−ligands, and the geometry of such {Li11} building units could be adequately described as trigonal prism. The connection of trigonal prisms results in a 3D metal−organic coordination framework with well- known acs topology (as a subnet of the NiAs niccolite mineral; Figure S3, Supporting Information). There are relatively wide hexagonal channels running along the c direction (diameter ca. 7 Å), intersecting through smaller windows (ca. 3 Å × 8 Å) (Figure 4). These channels are occupied by disordered 1,4-dioxane molecules and H3O+ cations. The solvent accessible volume in guest-free compound 4 reaches 54% as estimated by PLATON. The as- synthesized 4 released all six guest 1,4-dioxane molecules and 5 H2O corresponding to 32% weight decrease until 150 °C (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Unfortunately, guest removal by vacuum activation of 4 results in amorphization of the crystalline compound. However, the porosity of 4 was conﬁrmed by a number of solvent exchange experiments (vide infra). Figure 4. Crystal structure of 4. (a) Structure of the {Li11}−carboxylate complex.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX F Crystal Structure of [Li{Li(nmp)}{Li(H2O)(nmp)}{Li- (nmp)2}2(H2tms)(Htms)2]·NMP·EtOH (5). The single crystals were isolated after heating of the ethanol/NMP mixture of LiOH and trimesic acid H3tms at 80 °C. The single-crystal X-ray analysis of 5 revealed ﬁve Li+ cations, one H2tms−and two Htms2−anions, six coordinated NMP molecules, and one aqua ligand in the asymmetric unit. All the lithium cations have tetrahedral coordination environments of oxygen atoms. The structure is composed of three Li−carboxylate units of diﬀerent nuclearity and connectivity. The Li(1) and Li(2) cations form a binuclear 3-connected unit (Figure 5) where Li(1) is coordinated by two oxygen atoms of NMP ligands and two oxygen atoms of carboxylate groups and the Li(2) is coordinated by one oxygen atom of an NMP ligand and three carboxylic oxygen atoms. Two of these carboxylic groups form bridges between Li cations in μ2-COO-O,O′ and μ2- COO-O fashion. Cations Li(3) and Li(4) make up another binuclear four-connected building unit (Figure 5). The Li(3) is coordinated by two oxygen atoms of NMP ligands (one being disordered over two positions) and two carboxylate anions. The Li(4) is coordinated by four oxygen atoms of four diﬀerent carboxylate anions. These Li cations are bridged by two μ2-O atoms of carboxylate groups. Finally, Li(5) cations form a mononuclear unit, coordinated by two carboxylate anions, one oxygen atom of the NMP ligands, and a H2O molecule. The Li−O(carboxylate) bond lengths (1.902(4)−2.022(5) Å), Li−O(NMP) distances (1.856(7)−2.065(9) Å), and Li(5)− O(H2O) distance (1.964(8) Å) fall within the characteristic range for tetrahedral carboxylate complexes of lithium. The organic trimesate ligands were found to be partly protonated (H2tms−and Htms2−) with hydrogen bonds existing between neighboring carboxylic groups (O···O distances are in the range 2.404(3)−2.456(3) Å) (Figure 5). These organic ligands serve as three-connectors between the inorganic lithium-based building units, forming a complicated 3,4-connected 3D topology with point symbol (5.8.9)2(5.92)(5.8.10)(5.8.92.102). Alternatively, the coordination net in 5 could be described as 2D alternating layers with fes pattern, interconnected into a 3D structure (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The interstitial volume of the crystal compound is occupied by coordinated and guest solvent molecules. The latter are highly disordered and could not be modeled as a set of discrete atomic sites. The hypothetic removal of NMP and EtOH guest molecules from 5 results in an accessible volume ca. 24%. The ﬁnal formula of 5, [Li{Li(nmp)}{Li(H2O)(nmp)}{Li(nmp)2}2(H2tms)(Htms)2]· NMP·EtOH, was calculated from the SQUEEZE results (362e per unit cell) combined with elemental (C, H, N) analysis data. The TG analysis of 5 (Figure S15, Supporting Information) shows ca. 25% mass decrease related to the solvent removal (up to 150 °C), followed by a framework destruction at higher temperatures.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX G crystals 4·6C4H8O2 into the corresponding solvents. The XRD indicates the stability of the metal−organic framework 4 during the exchange, while chemical analyses revealed the following formulas: 4·5C6H5CH3, 4·5C6H6, 4·8CH3NO2, 4·6C6H5NO2, respectively (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Photo- luminescence of compound 4·6C4H8O2, having the largest channels, was investigated. The excitation and emission spectra are displayed in Figure 6. For the crystalline samples of as-synthesized 4·6C4H8O2 with 1,4-dioxane guest molecules, emission spectra display an intensive blue broad band with a maximum at 440 nm, which could be assigned to an intraligand π* →π transition in the 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylate anion. The emission spectra of the guest-exchanged series 4·{guests} show the broad band at 440 nm indicating the similar nature of the benzenetricarboxylate-centered electron transition. Remarkably, the intensity of the photoluminescence turned out to be quite diﬀerent, depending on the nature of the guest molecules. By rough estimation, the inclusion of benzene and toluene increases the intensity of the luminescence by ca. 1.5 and 3.5 times, respectively, while the inclusion of nitromethane decreases it 2.5 times. Preliminarily, we can explain such changes by incident light adsorption by aromatic molecules (benzene or toluene), followed by the energy or electron transfer to the framework thus exciting the benzenetricarbox- ylate ligand. Assuming this mechanism, the stronger increase of the luminescence for G = toluene compared with G = benzene is apparent, taking the electron-donor properties of methyl group into account. This process is accompanied by the nonemissive relaxation of the excitation through the complex framework dynamics and interatomic vibrations. Such frame- work relaxation must depend on the guest nature and composition, although it is quite hard to rationalize. Most interestingly, the inclusion of nitrobenzene completely quenches the luminescence of the framework 4, contrary to the other guest molecules. The nature of luminescence quenching can be attributed to the electron transfer from the excited π* ligand orbital to the electron-deﬁcient nitroaromatic system of the guest molecule with subsequent nonemissive energy dissipation. The alternative energy transfer quenching mechanism is unlikely because the nitrobenzene UV absorbance spectrum has a maximum at λ = 260 nm and almost no absorption above 320 nm; thus, no overlap takes place between nitrobenzene absorption and the framework luminescence peaks. We can also note that a similar electron transfer mechanism could, at least partly, take place for nitromethane guest molecules, which results in somewhat lower luminescence intensity of 4·8CH3NO2 compared with pristine 4·6C4H8O2. Such interesting luminescence properties of porous coordination framework 4 with remarkable sensitivity toward the nature of the guest molecules could be implemented in sensing devices for detection of explosive nitroaromatics and other dangerous species.8 ■CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, ﬁve new 3D metal−organic frameworks based on lithium carboxylates of rigid linkers were obtained. All of them were synthesized by a solvothermal method in a mixed system alcohol/polar aprotic solvent. Compounds 1 and 2 feature the same framework composition but diﬀerent guest- controlled structures and topology. Compounds 1 and 3 have highly opened structures with pore sizes of 4.5 Å × 4.5 Å and 8 Å × 10 Å, correspondingly. The framework 4 is based on a undecanuclear Li−carboxylate complex {Li11(H2O)5(RCOO)18}. Assembly of these units leads to an open structure with pore diameter 7 Å. This impressive unique {Li11} fragment is an interesting example of rare lithium polynuclear complexes. Furthermore, compound 4 is capable of a reversible solvent exchange process. The photoluminescence properties of this porous compound were shown to depend on the nature of the guest molecules, providing the opportunity for the selective detection of dangerous explosive aromatic molecules. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Crystallographic data in CIF format, additional structural ﬁgures, IR spectra, PXRD data, and TGA data for the all compounds.
