Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analyses of 1 and 3 reveal the host framework possessing an effective channel area with the dimensions of 10.8 × 4.5 Å. These channels can accommodate guest molecules of various sizes and shapes such as ethanol, water, and benzyl alcohol. Thermogravimetric analysis shows a two-step weight loss corresponding to the loss of guest molecules followed by the loss of coordinated water. The host framework is thermally stable up to 295 °C. The cobalt nicotinate host remains intact, even upon the removal of the guest to form compound 2 as revealed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.

The magnetic exchange coupling between the dicobalt centers for compounds 1 and 3 are analyzed on the basis of both the Curie-Weiss expression and a binuclear magnetic model. The negative values of the magnetic exchange coupling constant indicate the antiferromagnetic nature within the cobalt dimer. Introduction One of the major challenges in the design and synthesis of porous metal-organic framework (“zeolite-analogue”) materials is to maintain the host framework integrity in the absence of guests in order to allow for reversible access to the cavities within the host. Extensive studies have been carried out on the synthesis and tailor design of these functional coordination polymers, adopting the concept of supramolecular self- assembly1-20because of their diverse structural properties and potential applications in the field of size-selective separation, gas adsorption, and catalysis.21-27 One of the approaches to meet the above challenge is to employ more rigid building-block entities in the framework to enhance the robustness. Recent studies demonstrated that the construction of metal carboxylate clusters provided an effective strategy to form robust hosts possessing porosity.28-32 A few successful examples are the Zn4(O)O12C6 cluster unit observed * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Much remains to be done to attain this goal. Expanding on this approach, we report here a series of open-framework coordination polymers: Co2(H2O)(C6H4O2N)4‚0.5CH3CH2OH‚0.5H2O (1), Co2(H2O)- (C6H4O2N)4 (2), and Co2(H2O)(C6H4O2N)4‚C6H5CH2OH (3). The host network of these compounds consists of a Co2(O)- (O2C)2 cluster unit that is linked by a rigid nicotinate ligand with good thermal stability. Their thermal stability, inclusion, and magnetic properties are also reported. Experimental Section Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate and 3-cyanopyridine were purchased from ACROS Chemicals and used as received without further purifica- tion. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed under nitrogen on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 TG analyzer. Powder diffraction measure- ments were recorded on a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer at 40 kV, 30 mA for Cu KR (λ ) 1.5406 Å), with a step size of 0.02° in θ and a scan speed of 1 s per step size. Variable-temperature dc magnetic susceptibility data were collected for polycrystalline samples of complexes 1 and 3 in an applied field of 1.0 kG and in the temperature range of 2.0-300.0 K, which were measured by a SQUID magnetom- eter (Quantum Design, MPMS-7). The samples were embedded in eicosane wax to prevent any torquing of the polycrystalline in the magnetic field. Pascal’s constants33 were used to estimate the diamag- netic corrections. Co2(H2O)(C6H4O2N)4‚0.5CH3CH2OH‚0.5H2O (1). Single crystals of 1 were synthesized by heating a mixture of Co(NO3)2‚6H2O (0.1 mmol) and 3-cyanopyridine (0.1 mmol) in the mixture of the solvents ethanol (1.25 mL) and water (3.75 mL) at 140 °C for 96 h. The solid product was washed by distilled water and isolated by suction filtration. The final product contained a single phase of red-lathy crystals of 1 in a yield of 58% based on nicotinate. A powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the bulk sample compared well with the pattern simulated from the single-crystal data (vide infra). Anal. Calcd: C, 45.75; H, 3.38; N, 8.54. Found: C, 45.40; H, 3.72; N, 8.35. Co2(H2O)(C6H4O2N)4 (2). A single crystal of 2 was obtained by mounting a single crystal of 1 on a glass fiber and keeping it sealed in a Schlink tube under vacuum (10-3 Torr) for 12 h. The resulting crystal was sealed to prevent contact with the moisture from the air during the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Co2(H2O)(C6H4O2N)4‚C6H5CH2OH (3). Single crystals of 3 were synthesized following a procedure similar to that used for 1. A mixture of Co(NO3)2‚6H2O (0.1 mmol) and 3-cyanopyridine (0.1 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of benzyl alcohol (1.25 mL) and water (3.75 mL) and heated at 140 °C for 96 h. The solid product was washed by distilled water and obtained by suction filtration. The final product contained a single phase of red-lathy crystals of 3 in a yield of 62% based on nicotinate. A powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the bulk sample compared well with the pattern simulated from the single-crystal data (vide infra). Anal. Calcd: C, 50.83; H, 3.57; N, 7.64. Found: C, 49.72; H, 3.52; N, 7.59. Crystallographic Determination. A single crystal of 1 with the dimensions of 0.40 × 0.36 × 0.12 mm was mounted on the tip of a glass fiber and placed onto the goniometer head for indexing and intensity data collection. The measurements were performed on an Enraf-Nonius CAD4 diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochro- matized Mo KR radiation (λ ) 0.710 73 Å). Intensity data were collected at 293(2) K with the ω-2θ scan method within the limits 2° < θ < 26° and were monitored by three standards every 4 h. Lorentz polarization corrections were performed.34 Empirical absorption cor- rections were based on ψ-scan data. On the basis of systematic absences and statistics of intensity distribution, the space group P1h was determined. Direct methods were used to locate the cobalt atoms, with the remaining non-hydrogen atoms being found from successive difference Fourier maps. The structure was refined by full-matrix least- squares based on F2 values. All of the non-hydrogen atoms on the cobalt nicotinate framework were subjected to anisotropic refinement. Hy- drogen atoms on the bridging water were located from difference Fourier maps. All of the hydrogen atoms of the nicotinate groups were assigned by geometric placing. Because of the disorder nature of guest (water and ethanol) molecules, their oxygen and carbon atoms were located in electron density maps and were refined isotropically with a site-occupation factor (SOF) of 0.5 assigned for all of the oxygen and carbon atoms of the guest molecules. Their locations are only approximate. No attempt was made to locate the hydrogen atoms of the guest molecules. Computations were performed using the WINGX35 and SHELX-97 program packages.36 To analyze compound 2, the same crystal that was used for the crystallographic determination of 1 was first treated under a vacuum and then sealed. A crystallographic determination procedure similiar to that which was previously mentioned was performed. The results showed that only a negligible amount of the residual electron density of 0.96 e A-3 was observed from the difference Fourier map, indicating that guest molecules were removed in a vacuum. A single crystal of 3 with the dimensions of 0.64 × 0.40 × 0.16 mm was selected for crystallographic analysis. Single-crystal data were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer (Mo KR, λ ) 0.710 73 Å) at T ) 298(2) K. The data were corrected for Lorentzian, polarization, and absorption effects. SHELX-97 was used for solving the structure and full-matrix least-squares refinement on F2. The hydrogen atoms of the bridging water molecule were located from a difference map. The hydrogen atoms on nicotinate and the phenyl group of benzyl alcohol were assigned by a geometrical calculation. An SOF value of 0.5 was assigned to the disordered -CH2OH group of the benzyl alcohol molecule. Crystallographic details for all three of the compounds are listed in Table 1 and selected bond distances and angles in Table 2. (24) Choi, H. J.; Lee, T. S.; Suh, M. P. Angew. Chem., Int.

Thermally Stable Porous Cobalt(II) Nicotinate Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 40, No. 25, 2001 6427 Results and Discussion Compound 1 was successfully synthesized with a 58% yield based on nicotinate, and the characterization led to the assign- ment of the formula Co2(H2O)(C6H4O2N)4‚0.5CH3CH2OH‚ 0.5H2O. Compound 2 was obtained by treating 1 under vacuum and identified using an X-ray crystal diffraction technique. Compound 3 was synthesized in a 62% yield and, on the basis of the characterization, was given the assignment Co2(H2O)- (C6H4O2N)4‚C6H5CH2OH (Scheme 1). Under the reaction conditions, 3-cyanopyridine was hydrolyzed to become nicoti- nate. Single-crystal X-ray analysis reveals that 1 possesses a three- dimensional porous host framework (Figure 1). The crystal- lographic asymmetric unit of the Co(II) cluster core consists of two Co(II) centers, four bridging nicotinate ligands, one bridging water molecule, and half of the ethanol and water molecules as guests.

The four nicotinate groups provide a total of 10 binding sites, with the added two sites by a µ2-bridging water molecule and both of the Co centers adopting a six- coordinated octahedral geometry to become a vertex-sharing (bridging water) Co2O8N4 cluster (Figure 2). In addition to the bridging force, the rigidity of the Co2O8N4 cluster is further enhanced by hydrogen-bonding interactions between the bridg- ing water molecule and the carboxylate group of nicotinate (O(91)-H‚‚‚O(12A) and O(91)-H‚‚‚O(32A) of 2.561 and 2.562 Å, respectively). Two metal centers linked by dicarboxylate bridges can also be seen in nature’s example, as in the diiron carboxylate unit in the oxygen-carrying enzyme hemerythrin.37 Within the one-dimensional channels of 1, ethanol and water molecules occupy the channels with an estimated cross-sectional area of about 10.8 × 4.5 Å (Figure 3).38 Attempts were made to remove the guests to form Co(II)2(nicotinate)4 (2) by treating the same single crystal of 1 under vacuum for 12 h. The structure of 2 remains intact, even after the removal of the guest as revealed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Linkage of the Co2O8N4 clusters with nicotinate ligands assembles the channel space. Particularly, nicotinate ligands are arranged in a “double- wall” fashion favoring a π-π interaction. This nicotinate double wall can further enhance the robustness of the host so that it can survive the highly porous status in the absence of guests. (The host framework atoms of 2 only occupy about 58% of the unit cell volume based on PLATON analysis.)39 The effective cavity space can also accommodate larger guest molecules of different sizes and shapes such as benzyl alcohol (BzOH) as in Co(II)2(nicotinate)4‚BzOH (3). TG analysis agrees well with the crystallographic observations (Figure 4). The TG curve of 1 illustrates the release of the guest (ethanol and water) molecules (calcd 4.9%, found 5.3%) between 50 and 200 °C, followed by the release of bridging water (calcd 2.8%, found 3.0%) upon heating to 295 °C. For 3, the release of benzyl alcohol occurred between 90 and 210 °C (calcd 14.2%, found 13.6%), and the loss of bridging water occurred at 295 °C. The existence of a plateau area (about 90 °C duration) between the two losses observed in the TG analysis for compounds 1 and 3 allows the selective study of the desorption- sorption process. A freshly ground sample of 1 was heated at 250 °C for 4 h and then was naturally cooled to room temperature by exposing the sample in the atmosphere for 20 h. The framework integrity is sustained as observed by the PXRD results (Figure 5). Choosing a spacer ligand with an appropriate shape and length as the linker of metal centers is also an important factor for the construction of robust frameworks possessing open cavities. Similar to 1, the structure of cadmium(II) (4-(3-pyridyl)- ethenylbenzoate) (4) possesses the same type of binuclear metal- cluster core.40 However, the framework of 4 presents a different spatial arrangement than that induced by the organic linker as compared to 1. No cavities have been observed in the cadmium case. The inverse magnetic susceptibilities and effective moments per mole of cobalt for complexes 1 and 3 are given in Figure 6. The effective moments per mole of cobalt are around 5.0 µB at 300 K and decrease with decreasing temperature, which is a (34) International Tables for X-ray Crystallography; Kluwer Academic Publishers: Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 1989; Vol. C.

Thermally Stable Porous Cobalt(II) Nicotinate Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 40, No. 25, 2001 6429 typical behavior of the antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic pair. At the first approximation, we apply the results of Curie- Weiss’s law from the high-temperature magnetic susceptibilities data to measure the magnetic coupling interaction where N, g, â, and kB have their usual meanings and J is the exchange interaction between the metal ions.41 The 20.0-300 K temperature dependencies of the magnetic susceptibilities of 1 and 3 were fit by the Curie-Weiss expression with CM values of 3.17 and 3.42 emu K/mol and θ values of -31.3 and -33.1 K, respectively. The negative θ values indicate the antiferro- magnetic coupling between the metal sites. According to the equations, the effective moment µeff ) (8CM)1/2 and the exchange coupling constant J/kB ) 3θ/[2S(S + 1)] would be obtained. These calculated values of µeff and J/kB are 5.0 and 5.2 µB and -12.5 and -13.2 K for complexes 1 and 3, respectively. The values of µeff are larger than the spin-only value of 3.78 µB, and this is commonly observed for the Co2+ centers, which is due to incomplete quenching and arises from the spin-orbital coupling.42 The magnetic coupling constant J/kB is around -13 K and indicates that there is antiferromagnetic coupling via the bridging dicarboxylate groups and the water within the cobalt metal centers. The antiferromagnetic exchange interactions may be through Co(1)-O(91)-Co(2) with an angle of 113.6°, in which a large superexchange angle leads to an antiferromagnetic interaction. To analyze the magnetic exchange coupling interaction between the cobalt dimer, the susceptibility data of the complexes are fitted with the binuclear magnetic equations43 where X ) exp(-J/kBT) and TIP is the temperature-independent paramagnetism of the Co2+ ion. The reasonable fitting results for magnetic susceptibility data above 50.0 K with TIP ) 200 × 10-4 emu/mol are g ) 2.53 and J ) -7.9 K for complex 1 and g ) 2.63 and J ) -8.3 K for complex 3. The negative values of J indicate the antiferromagnetic nature, and the spin- orbital coupling contributes to the trivial g factor. However, the exchange coupling parameters J obtained from two ap- proximations are different. This divergence would be associated with the complicated cobalt system, which has the following properties: (i) ligand-field splitting of the free ion, (ii) spin- orbital coupling, and (iii) an anisotropic intra- and interdimer exchange interaction.41 Conclusions In summary, a new robust porous host framework, Co2- (H2O)(C6H4NO2)4, has been successfully synthesized and characterized. It contains nanoscale cavities that can accom- modate guest molecules of various shapes and sizes. Taking advantage of the rigid cluster unit and an appropriate organic spacer, the building of a robust host that can withhold high porosity becomes feasible.
