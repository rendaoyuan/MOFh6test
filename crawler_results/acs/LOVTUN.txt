Their crystal structures, thermogravimetric analyses, solid-state transformation to ZnO and characterization of the resulted zinc oxide particles are reported. Compounds 1 and 2 show three-dimensional supramolecular architectures, generated from the interconnection of the zigzag (in 1) and respectively the linear (in 2) chains through hydrogen bonding interactions. The crystal structure of 3 revealed the presence of five different types of zinc atoms, that are successively linked through carboxilato or alkoxo bridges in a helicoidal chain running along the crystallographic a axis. Both right-handed (P) and left-handed (M) helices are present in the crystal and they are alternately interconnected by pairs of isophthalato bridges, resulting in channels of hexagonal shape, filled with water molecules. Compound 4 has a 3D structure in which linear centrosymmetric {Zn3(H2Dea)2}6+ nodes are joined by terephthalate bridges. Owing to its porous network, compound 3 was tested in two selective reactions: photo-oxidation of phenol to hydroquinone and aerobic photo-oxidative condensation of benzylamine to N-benzylidenebenzylamine.

Furthermore, the final architecture can be influenced by auxiliary ligands, solvent molecules, temperature, pH, coordinated or uncoordinated anions. Numerous multitopic ligands with two or more discrete metal-binding sites have been used in the construction of coordination polymers. Conventional linkers are usually organic compounds containing donor atoms or groups of donor atoms (polycarboxylates,51-59 phenolates,60-62 amines,63-67 pyridyl derivatives,68-80 sulfonates,81-87 phosphonates,88-89 azolates90- 93). In particular, carboxylate-based systems, especially three-dimensional porous metal organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed with rigid aromatic backbones (benzene-, naphthalene-, anthracene-, and pyrene-based derivatives), have attracted considerable attention due to the tunability of their structures and properties and their suitability for hydrogen storage, sorption, separation and sensing.94-102 The node-and-spacer approach103,104 proved to be a successful strategy for the synthesis of coordination polymers. In a series of papers, we developed an extension of the classical approach, showing that alkoxo-bridged Cu(II) cationic species can be used as nodes in constructing extended structures by connecting them through a large variety of spacers (neutral or anionic).105-112 As a follow-up to this research, we decided to employ the Zn(II) ion for the construction of coordination polymers based on amino-alcohols and different multitopic ligands. The spherical d10 configuration is correlated with a flexible coordination environment and various geometries of Zn(II) complexes are possible: from tetrahedral through trigonal bipyramidal and square pyramidal to octahedral, with more or less severe distortions of these ideal polyhedra. Alkoxo-bridged Zn(II) systems are scarce,113-117 and coordination polymers consisting of alkoxo-bridged Zn(II) cores and anionic polycarboxylate spacers have not been Page 3 of 34 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 4 reported until recently.118-120 A series of Zn(II)-trimesate metal organic frameworks (MOFs) obtained under solvothermal conditions in the presence of various aminoalcohols has been described,118 while the reaction of zinc nitrate, terephthalic acid and triethanolamine afforded another MOF with formula [Zn4(H2tea)2(1,4-bdc)3]·2(MeOH).119 Another study presents several discrete Zn(II)–triethanolamine–acetate complexes, which were further used as precursors for ZnO nanoparticles.120 Many polymeric zinc complexes are characterized by robust and thermally stable open- framework structures and some of them were already evaluated as heterogeneous photocatalysts, due to their versatility in a wide range of reactions.121-123 Selective oxidation using recoverable heterogeneous catalysts has become an important target of the last decades, representing the most important strategy to selectively introduce oxygen atoms in organic molecules.124 The development of new types of heterogeneous catalytic systems for liquid-phase oxidations represents an excellent example of green chemistry where environmentally friendly oxidants (hydrogen peroxide and air) lead to an unprecedented increase of the e-factor.125 N- benzylidenebenzylamine and hydroquinone are important intermediate molecules that are expected to be manufactured via this strategy. Particularly, the selective aerobic oxidative condensation of benzylamine to N-benzylidenebenzylamine is an important reaction in organic chemistry since the product of reaction is a valuable intermediate in organic synthesis with direct applications in the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceutics, agrochemicals, etc.126-128 To replace the stoichiometric oxidants,129,130 heterogeneous metal catalysts (Ru, Rh, Pt, Ir, Pd, Ag, Au) deposited on supports at relatively high temperatures have been used.131-133 More recently, an iron(III)-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate MOF containing N-hydroxyphthalimide as a guest in the intracrystalline space was reported as a heterogeneous catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of benzylamine and its derivatives to their corresponding benzylimines.134 In the case of dihydroxybenzenes, several M3(BTC)2 metal-organic frameworks (M = Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) or Fe-MOF-74 were employed as catalysts.135,136 Another recent application of CPs is their use in the preparation of oxide materials. The potential of Zn(II) molecular compounds as precursors for ZnO phases has been investigated and it has been shown that particles with controlled morphologies could be generated. Thermal decomposition represents a suitable way to tailor the properties of the ZnO–based materials, and both the starting compound and the thermal treatment play a key role in the features and Page 4 of 34 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 5 properties of the obtained materials.137-139 By employing ligands available in large quantities at a low cost for the synthesis of CPs, this strategy for obtaining ZnO materials is relatively cheap and accessible. In this work, we report the synthesis of four CPs: ∞ 1[Zn2(Htea)2(1,2-bdc)] 1, ∞ 1[Zn(H3tris)(1,3-bdc)(CH3OH)] 2, ∞ 3[Zn5(Htea)2(1,3-bdc)3(H2O)]·2.6H2O 3, ∞ 3[Zn3(H2dea)2(1,4-bdc)3] 4 (H3tea = triethanolamine, H3tris = tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, H2dea = diethanolamine, 1,2-H2bdc = 1,2- benzenedicarboxylic acid, 1,3-H2bdc = 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 1,4-H2bdc = 1,4- benzenedicarboxylic acid). The three dicarboxylic acids were employed to explore and establish the effect of the position of carboxyl groups on the network topologies in the isolated products. The crystal structures of the four compounds, thermogravimetric analyses, solid-state transformation to ZnO and characterization of the resulted zinc oxide particles are reported. The porous network of compound 3 prompted us to test it in two selective reactions: photo-oxidation of phenol to hydroquinone and aerobic photo-oxidative condensation of benzylamine to N- benzylidenebenzylamine.

In a typical phenol oxidation experiment, 15 mg of photocatalyst 3 were added to a 10 mL aqueous solution of 40 ppm phenol. Samples were irradiated for three hours and 30 µL of solution were collected at 30 min intervals for high performance liquid chromatography. Photo-oxidative condensation of benzylamine to N-benzylidenebenzylamine. The benzylamine selective photo-oxidation experiments were solvent free. This matches one of the requirements of green chemistry. In a typical experiment 50 mg of 3 were added to 2 mL of benzylamine. Samples were irradiated for two hours with 30 µL collected after each hour for gas chromatography analysis. Both sets of reactions were carried out by irradiation in the following conditions: under UV with a UV lamp centered at 365 nm (2x120W Vilber Lourmat VL-340.BL, 11520 Lm, 33672 lx), and under visible with a visible lamp (150W Philips Master Colour CDM-T 150W/830, 13500 Lm, 5810 lx). Control experiments were carried out testing substrates irradiated without catalysts and with catalysts stirred in the darkness. In all these cases the conversion of substrates was zero. The reaction efficiency (conversion) was calculated from the area of peaks from the chromatograms (which is proportional with the moles of transformed phenol or amine): 100 × A A A = C i f i − (1) where: Ai = area of the peak of the substrate subject of the reaction; Af = area of the peak of the substrate in the reaction mixture. TOF values were calculated on this basis. The selectivity to the product of interest was calculated from the area of the peaks of the products: 100 × A A = S p pi ∑ (2) where: Api = area of the peak of the product of interest; ΣAp = sum of area of all the products. Stability of the photo-catalyst 3 The stability of the catalyst paralleled with the evolution of the reaction was checked by ex-situ experiments using Raman spectroscopy. Raman calibration was achieved using the Si 520.7cm-1 peak. The reaction suspension was analyzed every 15 minutes at 514 nm in the Page 8 of 34 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 9 extended spectral region from 300 up to 1500 cm-1 . The suspension was taken from the test tube and poured in a liquid Macro-CH-Vis cell accessory. The analysis of the solid was carried out in the 150 – 4000 cm-1 spectral region using a 633 nm laser. Before analysis, the solid was removed from the reaction mixture and dried. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crystal Structure Description ∞ 1[Zn2(Htea)(1,2-bdc)] 1. Solvothermal treatment of phthalic acid with zinc(II) nitrate in the presence of triethanolamine led to a one-dimensional coordination polymer (Figure 1a). Compound 1 crystallizes in the P121/c monoclinic space group, with cell parameters and structure refinement details given in Table 1. The asymmetric units consists of two crystallographically independent Zn(II) ions, one doubly deprotonated triethanolamine molecule (Htea2-) and one 1,2-bdc2- anion. The two carboxylato groups belonging to the phthalate ligand exhibit different coordination modes: one acts as a syn-syn bridge (µ2−η1:η1), while the second one coordinates in the monodentate mode (µ1−η1:η0). The Zn1 atom is five-coordinated, showing a slightly distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry (the value of the distortion parameter τ141 is 0.92). The equatorial plane is occupied by the three oxygen atoms from the Htea2- ligand [Zn1−O5 = 1.979(2) Å; Zn1−O6 =1.981(2); Zn1−O7 = 2.131(2)], while the amino nitrogen [Zn1−N1 = 2.146(3) Å] and one carboxylato oxygen [Zn1−O1 = 1.975(2) Å] fill the axial positions. The Zn2 atom displays a tetrahedral stereochemistry, with two alkoxo oxygen atoms from two triethanolamine molecules and two carboxylato oxygens, one from the syn-syn bridge and one from a monodentate group. The Zn2–O distances are in the 1.923(2) – 2.007(2) Å range. The zinc atoms are connected through one syn-syn carboxylato and two alkoxo bridges, resulting in zigzag chains running along the crystallographic c axis. The Zn···Zn separations are 3.414 and 3.535 Å. The chains are further interconnected (Figure 1b) through hydrogen bonds established between the protonated OH groups from the Htea2- molecules and the uncoordinated oxygen atoms of the phthalate ligands (O7’···O3 = 2.7 Å, ’ = 1-x, 1-y, 1-z).

The self-assembly process involving zinc(II) ion, H3tris, and isophthalate anion led to the formation of a one-dimensional coordination polymer, in which the bridging isophthalato ligands connect [Zn(H3tris)(CH3OH)]2+ nodes (Figure 2a). The two carboxylato groups belonging to the isophthalate anion exhibit different coordination modes: bidentate chelating and monodentate. The zinc ion is hexacoordinated with a strongly distorted octahedral geometry: one nitrogen and one oxygen atoms from a H3tris molecule [Zn1–N1 = 2.070(4); Zn1–O7 = 2.206(4) Å], three carboxylato oxygens [Zn1–O1 = 2.015(3); Zn1–O3 = 2.449(3); Zn1–O4 = 2.046(3) Å] and a coordinated methanol molecule [Zn1–O1M = 2.085(4) Å]. The Zn···Zn distance within the resulted linear chain is 10.23 Å. This is very close to that found (10.13 Å) within a linear {Zn(1,3-bdc)}n chain in the complex [Zn(µ-3,3’-bpp)(1,3- bdc)]n·nCH3OH·2nH2O (3,3’-bpp = 2,2’-bis(3-pyridylmethyleneoxy)-1,1′-biphenylene).141 The linear chains run along the crystallographic a axis and they are interconnected through hydrogen bonds involving the uncoordinated OH groups from the H3tris molecules and two carboxylato oxygen atoms from an adjacent chain [O6–O1’ = 2.640 Å; O5–O4’ = 2.857 Å; (a) (b) Page 10 of 34 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 11 (’ = x, 1+y, z)], resulting in layers parallel to the crystallographic ab plane (Figure 2c). These layers are further interconnected into a complex non-covalent 3D network through strong hydrogen bonds established between the uncoordinated OH groups of the H3tris ligand with the coordinated ones and also with the oxygen atoms from the methanol ligands [O6–O7’” = 2.630 Å; O5–O1M” = 2.673 Å; (” = 1-x, 1-y, 1-z; ’” = 0.5-x, 0.5+y, 0.5-z)] (Figure 2b).

The investigation of the crystal structure reveals the formation of a zigzag chain, which can be viewed as being constructed by alternating {Zn3} and {Zn2} secondary building units (SBUs), involving Zn1, Zn2 and Zn3 atoms and Zn4 and Zn5 atoms, respectively. In the trinuclear {Zn3} SBU the two terminal zinc atoms, Zn1 and Zn3, show a coordination number of 5, but their coordination geometries are different. Both triethanolamine molecules are doubly deprotonated and coordinate as tetradentate ligands to Zn1 and Zn3. The Zn1 ion displays a distorted square pyramidal geometry, with the trigonal distortion parameter τ = 0.43. The basal plane is defined by two alkoxo oxygen atoms, one amino nitrogen, and one oxygen atom from one 1,3-bdc ligand [Zn1–O16 = 2.018(5); Zn1– O17 =1.991(5); Zn1–N2 = 2.155(6); Zn1–O15 = 1.969(5) Å], while the fifth coordination site is occupied by the protonated oxygen atom from the Htea2- molecule [Zn1–O18 = 2.089(5) Å]. The value of the τ parameter for Zn3 ion is 0.87, indicating a slightly distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry. The equatorial plane is occupied by the three oxygen atoms from the triethanolamine molecule [Zn3–O7 = 2.031(5); Zn3–O8 = 2.062(5); Zn3–O9 = 1.990(5) Å], while the amino nitrogen and one oxygen atom from a carboxylato bridge fill the axial positions in a nearly linear arrangement [O10–Zn3–N1 = 173.4°].

The binuclear {Zn2} unit is a [Zn2(COO)3] SBU that was also found within other compounds.118,142-145 Both Zn4 and Zn5 atoms show a tetrahedral stereochemistry, with four oxygen atoms arising from one alkoxo and three isophthalato bridges. The Zn4–O distances vary between 1.927(5) and 1.948(5) Å, while the Zn5–O bonds are in the 1.905(4) – 1.992(5) Å range. The binuclear and trinuclear secondary building units are alternately connected by alkoxo bridges into helicoidal chains running along the crystallographic a axis, with a helical pitch of 13.66 Å (Figure 4a). Each Htea2- ligand acts as a bridge between three zinc atoms, similarly as reported with the tetranuclear Zn4(Htea)2Ac4 cluster.120 The Zn···Zn separations within the chains vary from 3.258 to 3.397 Å. Figure 4.

There are three crystallographically different types of isophthalate anions: two of them have all the four O atoms coordinated to four zinc ions (µ4−η1:η1:η1:η1 mode), while the third one presents a µ4−η1:η1:η2 coordination mode. An inspection of the packing diagram along the crystallographic a axis reveals channels of hexagonal shape (Figure 5). The edges of the hexagon are equal to 8.36, 8.57 and 9.47 Å, respectively. The shorter edges correspond to µ4−η1:η1:η1:η1 isophthalato bridges, while the longest ones arise from the µ4−η1:η1:η2 bridges. The cavities are filled with water molecules and have diameters of 7.4 Å, as found by PLATON (taking into account the van der Waals radii of the atoms).146 The solvent-accessible volume of 3 calculated by PLATON (excluding all water molecules from the pores) is 747.4 Å3, corresponding to 29.3% of the unit cell volume.

The terephthalate anion is a rigid dicarboxylate linker, which has been extensively used to generate extended structures. The self-assembly process between Zn(II) ion, diethanolamine and deprotonated terephthalic acid affords a 3D network (a) (b) Page 14 of 34 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 15 built from centrosymmetric {Zn3(H2dea)2}6+ nodes and terephthalato bridges. The synergistic use of diethanolamine and 1,4-bdc2- linker generates a linear Zn3(COO)6 secondary building unit, which was also reported for several Zn(II) systems with various carboxylate ligands.147-161 Compound 4 crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/n space group. The central Zn1 atom is surrounded by six carboxylato oxygen atoms in a nearly perfect octahedral geometry, with Zn–O bond lengths between 2.058(3) and 2.174(5) Å and O–Zn–O bond angles between 89.89(9) and 93.62(9)º (Figure 6). Selected bond distances and angles for compound 4 are collected in Table 2. The diethanolamine molecule is not deprotonated and coordinates as a bidentate chelating ligand toward Zn2 ions through the nitrogen atom and one oxygen, while the other OH group remains uncoordinated. The coordination sphere of the Zn2 ion is defined by one nitrogen and one oxygen atoms from a diethanolamine molecule and four oxygen atoms from three terephthalate anions. Two of the carboxylato groups act as bridges in the µ2−η1:η1−syn-syn mode, while the third one coordinates in a bridging-chelating µ2−η1:η2 fashion. The geometry of Zn2 atoms is a distorted octahedron, with Zn2–O/N bond lengths between 2.008(2) and 2.328(3) Å and bond angles between 76.94(11) and 103.04(9)º. The distance between the zinc centers within the node is 3.462 Å. Figure 6. The trinuclear unit in 4 together with the atom numbering scheme in the asymmetric unit. The terephthalate anions connect the {Zn3(H2dea)2}6+ nodes into a 3D network, in which narrow channels of triangular shape are formed (Figure 7). There are no solvent molecules within the cavities.

Two views of the packing diagram in 4 (the carbon atoms of the aromatic rings have been omitted for clarity). Photocatalytic studies. Compound 3 was tested as catalyst in two reactions, namely the photo-oxidations of phenol and benzylamine. Photo-oxidation of phenol to hydroquinone. The evolution of phenol photo-oxidation is presented in figure 8. A conversion of about 20% was achieved after 180 minutes disregarding the irradiation source (UV or Vis). These results (determined on the basis of the HPLC analysis) are in a perfect concordance with the TOC (total organic carbon) measurements of the reaction product. No mineralization or loss of carbon has been identified. The only identified product was hydroquinone. However, it is important to underline that the investigated photocatalyst 3 led very similar results under both Vis and UV irradiation conditions. Moreover, under Vis irradiation, the activity was slightly higher for short reaction times. 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 0 5 10 15 20 25 C (%) Time (min) UV Vis Figure 8.

A possible mechanism for the selective photo-oxidation of benzylamine to N- benzylidenebenzylamine is presented in scheme 1. The photocatalytic activity of 3 can be associated with absorption of light radiation by the chromophore building blocks, leading to excited sites. Compound 3 acts as an electron donor for molecular oxygen, which give rise to active oxygen species (superoxide ion) and a positively charged compound (3*+). Benzylamine is further activated by the electron hole of 3 and reacts with the active oxygen species to form benzaldehyde and ammonia. Subsequently, the condensation reaction of benzaldehyde with another benzylamine molecule leads to N-benzylidenebenzylamine. According to previous studies, this second reaction step is not photo catalyzed and may take place even under dark.162 However, the phtoactivated first step reaction seems to be faster than the non-photoactivated second step condensation, as suggested by the catalytic results (Figure 9). 3 hν 13* 33* O2 3*+ + O2 -* NH2 +*NH2 CHO NH2 - H2O N - NH3 CO2 + H2O ... Scheme 1. Oxidative condensation of benzylamine catalyzed by compound 3. The photo-oxidative condensation was performed under both UV and Vis irradiation and differences in TOF (turn over frequency) and selectivities depending on the two photoactivation sources were found (Figure 9). Working under visible irradiation, TON (turn over number) varied in a small range (38 after 0.5 h irradiation versus 40 after 2 h irradiation). However, during this period of time TOF decreased from 76 to around 20. Under UV irradiation, both TON and TOF values were initially smaller than under Vis irradiation, but they increased with time (TON from 10 after 0.5 h to 70 after 2 h irradiation, and TOF from 19 after 0.5 h to 35 after 2 h Page 17 of 34 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 18 irradiation). Differences were also in the selectivity to N-benzylidenebenzylamine, but only for long exposure times. In both cases, the selectivity was higher than 99% for exposure times up to 1.5 h, and then it decreased to 97% under UV, and 80% under Vis respectively. The by-product of this photooxidation was benzylaldehyde. The increase of benzylaldehyde content in the product mixture (Figure 10), especially under Vis irradiation, can be an indication that first step of the reaction leading to benzylaldehyde occurs faster than the coupling of benzylaldehyde with the second molecule of benzylamine (scheme 1), which may cause an accumulation of the oxidation product with time. 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 TOF UV TOF Vis S% UV S% Vis Time (h) TOF (h -1) 75 80 85 90 95 100 S% (%) Figure 9.

The Raman spectra of benzylamine before and after 3 h UV exposure (Figure 11) show a decrease of the intensity of the band at about 879 cm -1, which is assigned to the C-NH2 stretch.163 The band Page 18 of 34 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Crystal Growth & Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 19 at about 1004 cm-1 is assigned to the ring breathing and remains unchanged during the reaction. This results support the fact that only the –NH2 group was oxidized, while the aromatic ring remained unaltered. Similar spectra were collected under Vis irradiation (Figure S5). Raman spectra of photocatalyst 3 separated from the reaction mixture at different reaction times demonstrate no change (i.e. no damage) of its integrity (Figure S6). Further re-use of the catalyst in a new batch did not change the Raman spectra or catalytic performances. 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 Benzylamine Benzylamine after reaction I (a.u.)

Liquid Raman spectra of benzylamine before and after 3 h of UV exposure The diffractograms and Raman spectra of compound 3 before and after the photocatalitic reaction confirm its integrity at the end of the process (Figures S7-S8). Thermal stability studies In order to investigate the thermal stability of the four coordination polymers, TG-FTIR experiments were carried out in air between room temperature and 600 °C. Detailed descriptions along with the TG/DTG/DTA diagrams together with 2D plots of FTIR spectra of evolved gases from the decomposition of 1–4 are provided in the Supporting Information (Figures S9−S16). The TG analyses revealed a series of weight losses in the 200–515 ºC range, attributed to the elimination of benzenedicarboxylate and amino-alcohol molecules. The decompositions are characterized by several peaks in DTG and DTA respectively. The overall weight loss is consistent with the zinc oxide formation for all compounds.

The XRD patterns for ZnO-1 – ZnO-4 are similar and match with the standard pattern of the typical wurtzite structure of ZnO (hexagonal phase, space group P63mc, with lattice constants a = 3.24982(9) Å, c/a = 1.6021 Å, Z = 2, JCPDS No. 36-1451). Since all have similar feature, only the case of ZnO-3 will be discussed. The sharp diffraction peaks (Figure 12) indicate a good crystallinity of the ZnO particles. No other peaks related to any impurity were observed. 30 40 50 60 70 80 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 Intensity (a.u.) 2θ Figure 12. XRD pattern for ZnO-3 Investigation of the SEM images of the structures produced by calcinations revealed aggregates of ZnO crystals with various shapes and sizes (Figure 13). In general, the particles have asymmetric hexagonal shapes with rounded edges and their diameters range from 60 to 750 nm. The small differences in the morphologies of the four samples show the influence of the crystal structure of coordination polymers upon the features of materials produced from their calcinations.

SEM images at different magnifications for ZnO-1 – ZnO-4 CONCLUSIONS The results reported herein illustrate the rich chemistry which can be generated by using rigid dicarboxylate linkers (linear or angular) together with various amino-alcohols. The combination of two types of ligands imposed both short and long Zn···Zn separations and led to the obtaining of coordination polymers with various dimensionalities and solid-state architectures. In the four compounds, the carboxylate groups exhibit various connectivity modes: monodentate, chelating, syn-syn bridge, bridging chelating. The solid-state transformation of the Zn(II) coordination polymers is a facile and relatively low-cost method for the obtaining of ZnO particles with tunable morphologies, which may be influenced by the dimensionality and the structural features of the precursors. Compound 3 proved to be active in the selective photo-oxidation of phenol and, even more remarkably, in the selective photo-oxydation of benzylamine to form N- benzylidenebenzylamine. These results are promising and highlight the potential application of this kind of materials in photocatalysis.

The decomposition is characterized by several minima in DTG (the sharpest one at 363 ºC) and two strong exo peaks in DTA (at 366 and 446 ºC), and is quite rapid, being complete at 480 ºC. The experimental amount of the obtained ZnO is 36.4%, in good agreement with the calculated value (36.9%). Figure S9. TG, DTG and DTA curves for compound 1. TG data show that compound 2 slowly loses weight up to about 370 ºC. This broad and small mass loss corresponds to the coordinated methanol molecule (calculated: 8.4%, found: 7.0%), as confirmed by FTIR analysis (Figure S12). At above 370 ºC the main decomposition step begins, characterized by two peaks in DTG (at 398 and 447 ºC) and a strong exothermic peak in DTA at 479 ºC. The final decomposition product is ZnO (calculated: 21.3%, found: 21.7%). Figure S10. TG, DTG and DTA curves for compound 2. 9 The TG-FTIR analysis for 3 has shown a small mass loss at around 130 ºC, identified to be evolved water by FTIR. The value of mass loss corresponds to the loss of one water molecule per {Zn5} unit (calculated 1.57%, experimental 1.53%). On further heating, the compound remains stable up to around 200 ºC, then decomposition sets in and is completed at 490 ºC. Several minimums in DTG (the main one at 423 ºC) and exo peaks in DTA (the strongest one at 430 ºC) are observed. The remaining residue is ZnO (calculated 35.4%, experimental 36.6%). Figure S11. TG, DTG and DTA curves for compound 3. The TG analysis has shown that compound 4 is stable up to around 250 ºC, confirming that no guest molecules are hosted in the crystal network. On further heating, it exhibits a series of weight losses, characterized by a main minimum in DTG at 393 ºC and a strong exo peak in DTA at 397 ºC. The decomposition is completed at 510 ºC, when the expected amount of ZnO is formed (calculated: 27.2%, experimental: 27.9%). Figure S12. TG, DTG and DTA curves for compound 4. 10 FTIR analysis of evolved gases Compound 1. As decomposition starts at about 310 ºC, several volatiles are released: CO2 first (strong band in the 2200 – 2400 cm-1 region, minor bands in the 600 – 750 and 3500 – 3750 cm-1 regions), H2O (series of narrow bands at 4000-3500, 2000 - 1300 cm-1), CO (two broad bands at ~2180 and ~2115 cm-1), slight amounts of NH3 (characteristic bands at 964 and 930 cm-1). CO2 can have multiple sources: oxidation of hydrocarbon groups of triethanolamine ligands, condensation reactions, decarboxylation of phthalate ligands. The latter reaction is confirmed by the observation of a strong band assigned to benzene (3060 cm-1) that has a rapid and sharp release at ~400 ºC, and that results from total decarboxylation of phthalate ligands; and of a series of bands assigned to benzoic acid (1770, 1345, 1180 and 1080 cm-1) that is continuously released as a result of partial decarboxylation of phthalate. Some part of phthalate ligands can also be oxydised to CO2 and H2O, especially at high temperatures. Ammonia results from the decomposition of triethanolamine and exhibits two releases at about 370 ºC (main) and 440 ºC. At higher temperatures (~450 ºC) nitrogen from H3tea ligands is also generated as HNCO (two bands at 2200 and 2240 cm-1). Nitrogen can also be released as other decomposition or oxidation products of aminoalcohol, such as amines, hetero N- compounds, HCN, nitrogen oxides, etc. However, the corresponding bands were either too weak to identify or overlapped with other bands.

Clear evidence of methanol evolution is seen in the 2D FTIR spectrum of 2 (strong bands at 1000 – 1080 cm-1, medium broad band at 2800 – 3100 cm- 1) corresponding to the first mass loss. The second main mass loss starts on further heating with strong release of CO2, whose bands dominate the 2D FTIR spectrum. Two sharp bands at 964 and 930 cm-1 complemented by a series of narrow bands at 1200 – 750 cm-1 indicate ammonia evolution (originating from H3tris ligands). This more intense generation of ammonia, as compared to compound 1, is explained by the fact that H3tris has a primary –NH2 group, while triethanolamine (in compound 1) is a tertiary amine. Water vapor and small amounts of CO and HNCO are also released. Isophthalate ligands undergo total decarboxylation in this stage, as confirmed by the observation of a strong band assigned to benzene at about 450 ºC. No traces of benzoic acid, indicative of partial decarboxylation, were detected. Figure S14. 2D plot of FTIR spectra of evolved gases from the decomposition of compound 2. 12 Compound 3. Clear evidence of the release of lattice water is seen in the FTIR spectrum of evolved gases in the 100 – 200 ºC range, corresponding to the first mass loss. No other solvate molecules were detected. On further heating, CO2 starts to evolve at above 200 ºC. A new release of H2O is observed at above 300 ºC. Interestingly, no traces of NH3 are detected, suggesting that nitrogen from Htea ligands is mainly released as HNCO, whose bands are observed starting from 300 ºC. Again, isophthalate ligands undergo total decarboxylation, leading to a strong and sharp release of benzene at about 430 ºC. Small amounts of CH4 are detected in the 350 – 450 ºC temperature range. Figure S15. 2D plot of FTIR spectra of evolved gases from the decomposition of 3. 13 Compound 4. The 2D FTIR plot of 4 looks simpler than those for previous compounds, as the bands of only four main decomposition products can be observed: CO2, H2O, HNCO and C6H6 (in the order of appearance). The presence of benzene band and the absence of benzoic acid bands indicate that terephthalate ligands also undergo total decarboxylation, as concluded for compounds 2 and 3. Also, the nitrogen from the diethanolamine molecules (secondary amine) is mainly released as HNCO, whose strong bands are partially overlapped with that of CO2.
