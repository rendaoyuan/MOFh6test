Manuscript Phase Selection and Discovery among Five Assembly Modes in a Coordination Polymerization Stephen R. Caskey, Antek G. Wong-Foy, and Adam J. Matzger* Department of Chemistry and Macromolecular Science and Engineering Program, The UniVersity of Michigan, 930 North UniVersity AVenue, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109-1055 Received April 29, 2008 Thecombinationof zinc(II) nitratewith1,3,5-(triscarboxyphenyl)benzene(H3BTB) leads toﬁvedifferent microporous coordination polymers (MCPs). Two of these were previously known (MOF-177 and MOF-39), whereas polymer- induced heteronucleation was used in the discovery of three phases that have not been previously reported (Zn/ BTBant, Zn/BTBtsx, andZn/BTBdia). Modiﬁcationof crystallizationconditions allows for thebulk-scalesynthesis of each of these MCPs. Zn/BTBant and Zn/BTBtsx are each interpentrated 6,3-connected nets composed of the basic zinc carboxylate secondary building unit (SBU) and the tritopic linker BTB. The underlying noninterpenetrated net of Zn/BTBant is derived for the net of anatase, whereas that of Zn/BTBtsx is the previously unreported “tsx” framework. Zn/BTB dia consists of an underlying diamondoid net in which four linear, trinuclear zinc hourglass SBUs are arranged about a central µ4-oxo anion as the tetrahedral unit in the net and BTB further links the hourglass SBUs. Zn/BTB ant, Zn/BTB tsx, and MOF-177 are here deﬁned as polymorphic frameworks in that each is composed of the same SBU and linker but differ in topology and thus pore structure. These frameworks may be called a polyreticular series by analogy to several reported isoreticular series. The effect of linker-linker interactions are discussed. Introduction In principle, a metal ion and multifunctional ligand can assemble in a nearly limitless number of arrangements; in practice only a few unique structures are experimentally observed.1 In cases where several different phases are obtained depending on the reaction conditions, a basic mechanistic understanding for phase selection is absent: a situation analogous to polymorphism in molecular crystals. One class of materials for which this issue is particularly signiﬁcant is microporous coordination polymers (MCPs). The utility of an MCP is highly dependent on the selection of a topology and pore structure to provide the appropriate properties for a given application. For example, the combina- tion of zinc nitrate and terephthalic acid (H2BDC) provides MOF-5 from N,N-diethylformamide (DEF),2 but this com- bination can also yield several other phases, such as MOF- 2,3 MOF-3,3 MOF-69C,4 among others, by simply changing the solvent. We recently disclosed the synthesis of another zinc nitrate/H2BDC-derived phase (PNMOF-1) by polymer- induced heteronucleation.5 Although each of these MCPs is synthesized from zinc nitrate and H2BDC, the secondary building units (SBUs), which encompass the metal or metal clusters as nodes of the framework, for each of these MCPs are different. Thus, the SBU for MOF-5 is the octahedral basic zinc carboxylate cluster, whereas the SBU for MOF-2 is the square planar paddlewheel dimer.3 The properties of MCPs with the same metal/linker combination but different frameworks vary greatly and difﬁculty reproducing results obtained in different laboratories can be traced to problems in pure phase production.6 * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Inorg. Chem. 2008, 47, 7751-7756 10.1021/ic800777r CCC: $40.75 2008 American Chemical Society Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 47, No. 17, 2008 7751 Published on Web 08/02/2008 The fact that the linear linker H2BDC provides a number of different MCPs can likely be traced to the fact that it has been so extensively investigated.7 In fact, a tritopic linker has the potential to provide signiﬁcantly more topologically different frameworks, and with this in mind the tritopic linker H3BTB was chosen as a prototypical example. Thus far, the only reported phases incorporating zinc and BTB are MOF- 177 and MOF-39. MOF-177 is an MCP with record setting surface area.8,9 MOF-177 is composed of an octahedral basic zinc carboxylate SBU and the trigonal planar linker, BTB. The construction of MOF-177 is unique in that the frame- work formed by simpliﬁcation of the structure to a periodic arrangement of octahedra and triangles is a previously unobserved three-periodic net, designated “qom”.8 The synthetic conditions leading to MOF-177 are closely related to those of MOF-3910 in that each requires zinc nitrate and the same linker, H3BTB. Although MOF-177 and MOF-39 each derive from zinc and BTB, the SBU of each are distinctly different as is the case with each of the Zn/BDC MCPs mentioned above. Thus, the SBU for MOF-39 is a trinuclear zinc cluster bound by six carboxylates of six different BTB linkers to provide an unusual trigonal prismatic building unit. The so-called default structure for connection of triangles and octahedra is not the qom net or the unusual 6,3-connected net of MOF-39 but is in fact the pyrite (pyr) net.11 Several other arrangements are possible including structures analogous to anatase (ant), rutile (rtl), and brookite (brk), all of which are 6,3-connected nets. The exceptional properties of MOF-177 and observation of other high- performance materials involving the BTB linker, such as the microporous/mesoporous UMCM-1,12 warrants extensive investigation of related phases. Herein, we report the discovery through polymer-induced heteronucleation and subsequent bulk selection for three new phases of Zn/BTB MCPs, two of which are rare nets (ant and tsx). Also, we introduce the concept of polymorphic frameworks in which the same SBU and linker are used to construct materials of different topology and pore structure. Experimental Section Polymer-Induced Heteronucleation Experiments. An acidic polymer library was synthesized in 96 well polypropylene microtiter plates by a previously published procedure.13 Brieﬂy, six 1:1 (v/v) monomer solutions in ethanol were dispensed as 90 pairwise combinations and 6 pure monomer solutions by a Gilson 215 liquid handler to a volume of 100 µL. To each of these 96 solutions was added 50 µL of a 1:1 (v/v) solution of divinylbenzene (DVB) in ethanol containing 2 mol % 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) with respect to DVB. The solutions were photopolymerized in a nitrogen gas atmosphere and then annealed at 85 °C under vacuum to yield the cross-linked polymer library: acrylic acid (AA), 2-ethoxyethyl methacrylate (EEMA), ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate (EGMAP), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), methacrylic acid (MAA), and methyl methacrylate (MMA) with DVB. To each well of the cross-linked acidic polymer plates was then added 150 µL of a solution (DEF for MOF-177 conditions or a 3:3:1 (v/v/v) mixture of DMF/ethanol/water for MOF-39 conditions), which was 38.3 mM in Zn(NO3)2·4H2O and 20.6 mM in H3BTB14 by a Gilson 215 liquid handler. The microtiter plates were sealed with poly- ethylene plugs and pressed ﬁrmly between aluminum plates to prevent solvent loss upon heating. The plates were then heated to 100 °C (MOF-177 conditions) or 85 °C (MOF-39 conditions) for 2 days to ensure complete reaction. From the MOF-177 conditions (DEF, 100 °C), two phases were observed both optically and by PXRD. MOF-177 was the major component present on the plate yet a new rodlike phase (Zn/BTB ant) was observed, which displayed a distinct PXRD pattern. From the MOF-39 conditions (3:3:1 (v/v/v) DMF/EtOH/H2O), three phases were observed in the 96 well plate: MOF-39, a bladelike phase (Zn/BTB tsx), and a cubic phase (Zn/BTB dia). Bulk Scale Synthesis of Zn/BTB ant. To a solid mixture of H3BTB14 (0.0899 g, 0.2050 mol, 1 equiv) and Zn(NO3)2 · 4H2O (0.1008 g, 0.3855 mmol, 1.88 equiv) was added DMF (10 mL). The solution was mixed well and ultrasonicated until homogeneous. The reaction vial was capped tightly and placed in an oven at 100 °C. After 24 h, the sample was removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. The mother liquor was decanted from the clear rod crystals and replaced with acetone (10 mL). The acetone was decanted and replenished three times over two days. The yield of the reaction, determined from the weight of the evacuated material [Zn4O(BTB)2]·H2O is 48% based on H3BTB. Anal.

Single crystals suitable for X-ray structure determination were selected under a microscope and mounted in MiTiGen micromounts or on Nylon loops with Paratone-N hydrocarbon oil and placed in a stream of cold nitrogen from an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream Plus cooler for low temperature data collection. For the room temperature collection, suitable crystals were glued to the end of a thin glass capillary. Intensity data were collected on a three-circle (quarter -arm) Rigaku R-Axis Spider diffractometer (460 mm × 256 mm curved imaging plate detector with graphite monochromated Cu KR radiation (λ ) 1.54187 Å)). Initial ω scans of each sample were performed to determine preliminary unit cell parameters and to allow the selection of image widths for data collection. For all cases, oscillation images were collected using widths of 2.0-2.5° in ω. Data were collected using the d*TREK package in the CrystalClear software suite15 to obtain ω scans for  at 0° and 54°. Using the FS_PROCESS16 package in CrystalClear, the raw intensity data were then reduced to F2 values with corrections for Lorentz and polarization effects. Decay of the crystals during data collection was negligible. An empirical absorption correction was applied as implemented by FS_PROCESS. The structures were solved within the CrystalStructure17 package by direct methods and reﬁned against all data.18 Hydrogen atoms were placed at calculated positions (C-H ) 0.95 Å) using a riding model with isotropic displacement parameters scaled by the Ueq of the attached carbon atom. Thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. A partial occupancy acetone solvent molecule was located and modeled successfully having an occupancy of 2/3 in Zn/BTB-ant. In structures with voids, attempts to locate and model the highly disordered solvent molecules in the voids were unsuc- cessful. Therefore, the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON19 was used to remove the diffraction contribution from these solvents to produce a set of solvent free diffraction intensities. Results and Discussion Polymer-induced heteronucleation has recently demonstrated success as a tool for the discovery of new MCPs based on simple terephthalate linkers,5 and we propose that it might facilitate exploring phase diversity of the BTB linker. The method utilizes libraries of insoluble polymers, cross-linked terpolymers produced through combinatorial chemistry in the present case, that control crystallization owing to phase-directing heteronucleation events dictated by the composition of the surface on which crystal nucleation occurs. Cross-linked acidic polymers were synthesized in 96 well polypropylene microtiter plates, which were prepared by a previously reported method.13 Crystallization conditions (solvent, time, temperature) previously employed for the synthesis of MOF-177 and MOF-39 where each applied to the 96 different cross-linked acidic polymers in the well plates. From the MOF-177 conditions (DEF, 100 °C), two phases were observed both optically and by PXRD. MOF-177 was the major component present on the plate yet a new rodlike phase (Zn/BTB ant) was observed, which dis- played a distinct PXRD pattern. From the MOF-39 conditions (3:3:1 (v/v/v) DMF/EtOH/H2O, 85 °C), three phases were observed in the 96 well plate: MOF-39, a bladelike phase (Zn/ BTB tsx), and a cubic phase (Zn/BTB dia). For bulk-phase synthesis, time, temperature, and solvent were optimized to allow for the synthesis of each of the new phases in glass vials. Whereas MOF-177 and MOF-39 are formed from DEF and a DMF/EtOH/H2O mixture, respec- tively, Zn/BTB ant is formed conveniently from DMF at 100 °C and Zn/BTB dia is formed from DMF/1,4-dioxane/ H2O at 85 °C. The use of the smaller molecule, DMF, as the reaction solvent was reasoned to allow access by templating6 to the more dense interpenetrated structure of Zn/BTB ant compared to the noninterpenetrated structure of MOF-177 from DEF. The formation of Zn/BTB dia over the formation of MOF-39 was reasoned to be facilitated by a less coordinating solvent mixture involving dioxane in place of ethanol. In the structure of MOF-39, a water molecule is coordinated to an octahedral zinc ion, whereas in Zn/BTB dia no coordinated ligands are observed. The synthesis of Zn/BTB tsx on the bulk scale is notable in that the solvent mixture is identical to that for MOF-39, yet this new phase requires signiﬁcantly more harsh conditions (100 °C for 72 h vs 85 °C); MOF-39 is observed at intermediate reaction times, but upon completion of the reaction only Zn/BTB tsx is observed indicating its greater thermodynamic stabil- ity.20 The structure of MCPs can often be reduced by simpliﬁcation to a periodic arrangement of vertices and linkers. The structure of Zn/BTB ant, as with MOF-177, can be simpliﬁed into octahedral vertices derived from the basic zinc carboxylate SBU and triangles derived from the BTB linker. The assembly of these octahedra and triangles in Zn/BTB ant can then be derived from the anatase form of the mineral TiO2. The derivation of the ant net was performed using Systre.21 In the mineral form of anatase, titanium cations ﬁll octahedral holes, whereas oxygen anions ﬁll trigonal holes. In the crystal structure of Zn/BTB ant, [Zn4O(CO2)6] octahedra are joined by the tritopic BTB linker to form the 6,3-connected net shown in Figure 1. The space group of the underlying non-interpenetrated ant network is I41/amd, whereas the interpenetrated ant-c network is P42/nnm. The actual net here is interpenetrated, having the symmetry C2/c, whereas the underlying noninterpenetrated net has the symmetry Cc.

Phase Selection and DiscoWery among FiWe Assembly Modes Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 47, No. 17, 2008 7753 structure appears to be the result of slipped layers along the c axis as shown in part d of Figure 1. The ant net has been reported once previously in an MCP, a structure containing CoII and citrate.22 The tsx net is not naturally occurring and has not been observed in any previously reported MCPs to our knowledge. The tsx net was introduced by simpliﬁcation of the single- crystal XRD data to basic octahedra and triangles; the coordinates of which were input into Systre.21 Again, [Zn4O(CO2)6] octahedra are joined by the tritopic BTB linker to form the 6,3-connected tsx net shown in Figure 2. The symmetry of the underlying noninterpenetrated tsx network is Ij42m, whereas the symmetry of the interpenetrated framework is Ij42d. Multiple structures involving the same SBU and the same linker, as is the case with MOF-177, Zn/BTB ant, and Zn/ BTB tsx, are rare.23 “Polymorphism” in network solids has been discussed previously.24 This phenomenon has been observed in coordination polymers where single metal ions and multifunctional carboxylates make up the vertices and linkers, respectively, of the polymorphic network.25 These three phases can be described as polymorphic frameworks in the sense that SBU and linker are the same but the modes of assembly are not the same.26 Polymorphic frameworks could be considered a subset within the overarching class of supramolecular isomers.24 The difference between the qom, ant, and tsx nets is coordination of the second or third sphere of connections between trigonal and octahedral units. Whereas coordination sphere 1, CS1, is the same for the three nets meaning that each tritopic linker is connected to 3 different octahedra and each octahedron is connected to 6 different tritopic linkers, CS2 or CS3 is not the same. These differences result from the various orientations of triangles about each octahedral unit of CS1 in the three polymorphic frameworks (Figure 3). The so-called default net for the connection of triangles and octahedra is the pyrite net,11 which remains conspicuously absent from this series of polymorphic frameworks. However, the need for molecules to satisfy requirements of bond lengths and angles may ultimately override the selection of a default net. The third new structure of a Zn/BTB phase is depicted in Figure 4. This framework is isostructural with the Zn/TATB (22) Xiang, S. C.; Wu, X. T.; Zhang, J. J.; Fu, R. B.; Hu, S. M.; Zhang, X. D. J.

Caskey et al. 7754 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 47, No. 17, 2008 phase of Zhou,27 where BTB is simply substituted in place of TATB. Each of these structures is in the same space group, Fdj3. Thus, each consists of an underlying diamondoid net in which four linear, trinuclear zinc hourglass SBUs are arranged about a central µ4-oxo anion as the tetrahedral unit in the net. The linker, either TATB or here BTB, further links the hourglass SBUs to eachother to form a quite densely packed network. This Zn/BTB dia does not contain the same SBU as any of the other coordination polymers in the Zn/ BTB series, and therefore is not a polymorphic framework. A common theme among these coordination polymers, in contrast to MOF-177, is the presence of linker-linker interactions in the solid state as depicted in Figure 5. Zhou’s Zn/TATB phase shows clear π-π interactions between two staggered triazine rings of adjacent linkers. Zhou noted that at the time this was unobserved for any BTB phases and attributed the interaction to the triazine ring.27 Whereas π-π interaction of two equivalent benzene rings is less favorable than for staggered triazines, the interaction remains overall favorable, and it is therefore not surprising that it is observed in this new Zn/BTB dia phase. The distance separating the center of the staggered rings of two TATB linkers is 3.14 Å, which is shorter than for the BTB linkers (3.55 Å). The Zn/BTB ant and the Zn/BTB tsx MCPs also display somewhat close contacts between BTB linkers. In both cases, the interaction is between two linkers on separate interpen- etrating frameworks. Furthermore, there are no π-π interac- tions because the phenyl rings are canted with respect to each other in each case (parts b and c of Figure 5). Conclusion The discovery and selection of MCP phases among a complex system involving ﬁve Zn/BTB networks based on unique crystallization conditions is presented. Three new phases were discovered using polymer-induced heteronucle- ation and subsequently synthesized on a bulk scale by Figure 3.

Phase Selection and DiscoWery among FiWe Assembly Modes Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 47, No. 17, 2008 7755 optimization of the crystallization conditions including time, temperature, and solvent. Among the three new phases are two interpenetrating polymorphic frameworks of MOF-177. The ant and tsx nets are each rare 6,3-connected nets involving the tritopic linker BTB and the octahedral basic zinc carboxylate cluster. The third new Zn/BTB phase adopts a diamondoid net containing trinuclear zinc hourglass SBUs. Linker-linker interactions are key in the formation of each of these new structures. Polymorphic frameworks, due to their identity as supramolecular isomers, allow for the systematic exploration of topological effects on material properties and function. These polymorphic frameworks offer a complement to the recently reported isoreticular MOFs,28where the topology and SBU of multiple MCPs remain the same but the length and/or functionality of the linker is varied, and may well be described as a polyreticular series.

A small amount of each MeOH-activated Zn/BTB sample (~0.5 mg) was coated on a Nylon loop using mineral oil and mounted on a Rigaku R-Axis Spider diffractometer. Images were collected in transmission mode with χ set at 45°, φ rotating at 10°/min, and ω oscillating between 120° and 180° at 1°/min. Integration of the resulting image was performed in the AreaMax (2.0) software package with a step size of 0.1° in 2θ. Figure S5. PXRD pattern for activated sample of Zn/BTB ant. S7 Figure S6.
