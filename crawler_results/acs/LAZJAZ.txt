Complexes 1 and 2 possess similar 2-fold interpenetrating three-dimensional (3D) framework with bbf topology, but 1 crystallizes in an achiral space group, and 2 crystallizes in chiral space group and displays ferroelectric behavior. Complex 3 reveals a 3D framework with biunclear Co clusters, which displays weak antiferromagnetic character. In complex 4, only H4btc links Zn(II) to generate a 3D porous framework, with TPOM occupying the void space as countercation and template. In addition, photochemical and ferroelectric properties of these new complexes in the solid state have been studied. ■INTRODUCTION The designed construction of metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) from various molecular building blocks is currently a ﬂourishing research ﬁeld due to their intriguing aesthetic structures and potential applications in sorption,1 heterogeneous catalysis,2 magnetism,3 photochemical areas, and so on.4 Metal−organic frameworks exhibit diversiﬁed structures because of the diﬀerent selected metal ions, the bridging modes and conﬁgurations of organic ligands adopted, and the various reaction conditions,5−7 which render it diﬃcult to predict the construction of molecular architectures. Therefore, it still remains a challenge to explore eﬀective synthetic strategies to generate coordination polymers with expected structures and properties. Recently, various mixed-ligand MOFs have been reported;8 it is well-known that combining diﬀerent ligands in a complex oﬀers greater tunability of structural frameworks than using a single ligand. In particular, coordination polymers with ﬂexible mixed-ligands exhibit more complex and unusual structures, as functional groups on the ligands oﬀer variable conﬁgurations,9,10 which could freely rotate to meet the requirement of coordination geometries of metal ions in the assembly process. Tetrakis(4-pyridyloxy-methylene) methane (TPOM) is a ﬂexible polypyridyl ligand that was concerned in recent years as a result of their pluridentated and excellent coordinated ability. Up to now, the studies of MOFs with TPOM were still Received: October 13, 2011 Revised: May 20, 2012 Published: May 22, 2012 Article pubs.acs.org/crystal © 2012 American Chemical Society 3426 dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg201362x | Cryst.

These new compounds are characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectra, and X-ray crystallography. Crystal structures, topological analyses, and thermal properties of the compounds are presented. In addition, the photoluminescence, magnetic, and ferroelectric properties for complexes are also discussed. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials and Measurements. Reagents and solvents employed were commercially available and used as received. TPOM was prepared by the literature methods.12 IR absorption spectra of the complexes were recorded in the range of 400−4000 cm−1 on a Nicolet (Impact 410) spectrometer with KBr pellets.

Luminescent spectra were recorded with a SHIMAZU VF-320 X-ray ﬂuorescence spectropho- tometer at room temperature. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a Perkin- Elmer thermogravimetric analyzer Pyris 1 TGA up to 1023 K using a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under N2 atmosphere. The electric hysteresis loops were recorded on a Ferroelectric Tester PrecisionPremier II made by Radiant Technologies, Inc. Synthesis of {[Co2(TPOM)(bdc)2(H2O)2]·(H2O)3}n (1).

X-ray Crystallography. Single crystals of 1−4 were prepared by the methods described in the synthetic procedure. X-ray crystallographic data of 1−4 were collected at room temperature using epoxy-coated crystals mounted on glass ﬁber. All measurements were made on a Bruker Apex Smart CCD diﬀractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo−Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The structures of complexes 1−4 were solved by direct methods, and the non-hydrogen atoms were located from the trial structure and then reﬁned anisotropically with SHELXTL using a full-matrix least-squares procedure based on F2 values.13 The hydrogen atom positions were ﬁxed geometrically at calculated distances and allowed to ride on the parent atoms. The distribution of peaks in the channels of 2 and 3 were chemically featureless to reﬁne using conventional discrete-atom models. To resolve these issues, the contribution of the electron density by the remaining solvents was removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON.14 The numbers of solvent molecules were obtained by element analyses and TGA. The relevant crystallographic data are presented in Table 1, while the selected bond lengths and angles are given in the Supporting Information (Table S1). ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crystal Structure of {[Co2(TPOM)(bdc)2(H2O)2]·(H2O)3}n (1). Compound 1 crystallizes in the space group of P2/c. As shown in Figure 1a, there are two types of coordination environments around the Co(II) ions. Co1 is four-coordinated and resides in distorted tetrahedral coordination environment deﬁned by two oxygen atoms from two diﬀerent bdc2−anions and two nitrogen atoms from two TPOM ligands. Co2 is in an octahedral coordination sphere, which is deﬁned by two carboxylic oxygen atoms, two coordinated water O atoms at the equatorial position, and the other two coordinated N atoms from TPOM at the axial position. The bond lengths of Co−O and Co−N are 1.941−2.154 Å and 2.050−2.163 Å. In compound 1, the TPOM ligand adopts a conformation holding the four pyridyl groups in irregular orientations, the N···Ccore···N angles range from 90.306 to 125.995°. The −CH2O−spacers that connect each pyridyl group to the core adopt conformations that are substantially extended with Ccore− CH2−O−C torsion angles of 165.832° and 175.720°. An interesting feature in this network is that a pair of meso-helical channels exist (Figure 1b). Each Co atom coordinates to TPOM to form inﬁnitely a wave-like 2D network along the b axis (Figure 1c). The bdc2−anions link two Co atoms belonging to diﬀerent 2D networks to form a 3D framework (Figure 1d). The potential voids are large enough to be ﬁlled via mutual interpenetration of an independent equivalent framework, generating a 2-fold interpenetrating 3D architecture (Figure 1e). The Co(II) and TPOM can be regarded as 4-connected nodes and the bdc2− anions acting as linker. Compound 1 has a bbf network topology (with the Schläﬂi symbol {64·82}{66}2) (Figure 1f). Crystal Structure of {[Zn2(TPOM)(5-OH-bdc)2]·(DMF)- (H2O)2}n (2). Compound 2 crystallizes in the chiral space group P2, and the Flack’s parameter is 0.064(15). As shown in Figure 2a, two types of Zn(II) ions are all four-coordinated and reside in the distorted tetrahedral coordination environment deﬁned by two oxygen atoms from two diﬀerent 5-OH-bdc2−anions and two nitrogen atoms from two TPOM ligands. The bond lengths of Zn−O and Zn−N are 1.930−1.945 Å and 2.036−2.065 Å. In compound 2, TPOM ligand adopts a comformation holding the four pyridyl groups in irregular orientations, the N···Ccore···N angles range from 75.136 to 127.932°. The −CH2O−spacers that connect each pyridyl group to the core adopt conformation that is more extended than 1 with Ccore−CH2−O−C torsion angles of 170.307° and 178.557°. As a result of the chiral space group, there exists a 1D left-handed helical channel constructed by Zn(II) and 5-OH-bdc2−(Figure 2b). Each tetrahedral Zn atom coordinates to TPOM ligands to form an inﬁnitely wave-like 2D network along the a axis (Figure 2c). The 5-OH-bdc2−anions link two Zn atoms belonging to diﬀerent 2D networks to form a 3D framework (Figure 2d). In order to minimize the cavities and to stabilize the framework during the assembly process, another identical network across the cavities gives a 2-fold interpenetrating three-dimensional architecture (Figure 2e). By analysis, the whole structure is also represented as a bbf network topology. Crystal Structure of {[Co3(TPOM)(btc)2(H2O)]·(H2O)4}n (3). Compound 3 crystallizes in the space group P21/c. The asymmetric unit contains three Co(II) (Co1, Co2, and Co3) cations, one TPOM molecule, two btc3−anions, and one coordinated water. As shown in Figure 3a, carboxylate groups of btc3−adopt three diﬀerent coordination modes: one is chelating in a bidentate mode, another is bridging bidentate, and the third is monodentate bridging mode. Co1 is in a tetragonal pyramid coordination environment, which is deﬁned by three carboxylic oxygen atoms from three diﬀerent btc3−anions, one coordinated water, and one coordinated N atom from TPOM. Co2 and Co3 reside in distorted octahedral coordination spheres, Co2 is deﬁned by ﬁve oxygen atoms (O8, O10, O11, O13, and O14) from four diﬀerent btc3−anions and one nitrogen atom (N1) from TPOM ligand,while Co3is deﬁned byfouroxygenatoms fromtwo diﬀerent btc3−anions (O4, O5, O6, and O7) and two nitrogen atoms (N2 and N3) from two TPOM ligands. The Co−O lengths range from 2.045−2.28 Å and Co−N from 2.082−2.122 Å. The Co1 and Co2 are bridged by carboxylate ligands to form a binuclear cluster unit, and the distance of Co(1)···Co(2) is 3.399 Å. Each Co atom links btc3−anion to form an inﬁnitely 3D network with rectangular channel along the b axis. As shown in Figure 3b, noteworthy of this network is the presence of a pair of left-handed and right-handed 1D helical channels alternately arranged, which are formed by the btc3−linked to Co3 atoms, and the distance of Co···Co is 9.441 Å, while the binuclear Co SBU were linked by btc3−to form 1D ladder chains along c axis. Similarly, the TPOM ligands coordinated to Co3 atoms also formed left- handed and right-handed 1D helical channels alternately along the b axis, the distance of Co···Co is 14.548 Å (Figure 3c). Furthermore, the hand-directions of two helical channels are same. The TPOM and btc3−are linked to Co atoms to generate a 3D framework (Figure 3d). The binuclear Co cluster can be regarded as 6-connected nodes with all crystallographical independent TPOM ligands and btc3−acting as 4- and 3-connected nodes. Therefore, the whole structure can thus be represented as a {42·64·89}{42·6}{63}- {64·82}{65·8} network topology (Figure 3e). Crystal Structure of {[Zn2(TPOM)(btc)2}n (4). Compound 4 was solved in the space group I41/acd. The asymmetric unit Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg201362x | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 3426−3435 3428 contains half of a Zn(II) cation, half of a btc4−anion, and a quarter of a TPOM lattice molecule. As shown in Figure 4a, carboxylate groups of btc4−all adopt monodentate coordinated modes, so the Zn (II) has a tetrahedral geometry with four carboxylic O atoms from four btc4−anions. The Zn−O lengths are 1.927−1.967 Å. Figure 1. (a) Coordination environment of the Co(II) ions in 1. The hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.

Growth Des. 2012, 12, 3426−3435 3429 In compound 4, the completely deprotonated btc4−anions link four Zn atoms through the carboxylate coordination to form a 3D framework with larger open channels. From the c axis, there exist square channels with the size of ∼6.2 × 6.2 Å (Figure 4b), while the TPOM ligand is not coordinated, which occupies the void space as a countercation and arranges in reciprocal chiasmata mode (Figure 4c). From the TGA curve, there was no departure stage until the framework collapsed, that is to say TPOM plays a critical role, which keeps the framework stable. The btc4−and Zn2+ center can be regarded as four-connected linker and node. By analyzing, compound 4 has a PtS network topology (Figure 4d). Though there are many reports about Figure 2.

The symmetry of complex 4 is also the highest in these compounds. Thermal Analysis and PXRD Results.

Growth Des. 2012, 12, 3426−3435 3431 For complex 1, a weight loss of 11.88% is observed from 20 to 198 °C, corresponding to the departure of the lattice and coordinated water; the structure was then decomposed starting at 410 °C. The TGA curve of 2 is a weight loss of 10.93% from 20 to 260 °C, corresponding to the departure of the lattice water and DMF; the framework collapsed at 380 °C. Compound 3 has a long course of weight loss (8.09%) from 20 to 230 °C, cor- responding to the departure of lattice and coordinated water; the structure was decomposed starting at 407 °C. Complex 4 has no solvents, it was decomposed starting at 348 °C.

The results demonstrate that the experimental PXRD patterns perfectly match the simulated patterns based on the single-crystal X-ray data. Photochemical Properties. The luminescent properties of free ligands TPOM and 5-OH-H2bdc, as well as complex 2 in the solid state at room temperature, were studied as depicted in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). Intense emission of the free 5-OH-H2bdc was observed with wavelength of 350 to 410 nm (λmax = 365 nm). The curve of free TPOM ligand showed an inﬁrm emission with wavelength from 420 to 475 nm (λmax = 450 nm), which could be attributed to the π* →π or π* →n transitions. Complex 2 exhibits an emission character similar to that of the free 5-OH-H2bdc, the maximum emission peak is at 460 nm (λex = 360 nm), and shows a highly red shift compared with that of the 5-OH-H2bdc, which is probably assigned to the chelation of the carboxylate ligands to the central metals.15 Magnetic Properties of Complexes 1 and 3. The magnetic measurements were performed on polycrystalline samples of 1 and 3 using a SQUID magnetometer under an applied ﬁeld of 2000 Oe over the temperature range 2−300 K, and the results are shown in Figures 5 and 6. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of 1 in the form of χMT is displayed in Figure 5. As the temperature cools, χMT continuously decreases from 2.73 cm3 K mol−1 at 300 K to 1.72 cm3 K mol−1 at 1.8 K. The value of χMT at 300 K is greater than the expected value for one isolated high-spin Co(II) ions (g = 2 and S = 3/2), which is caused by an unquenched orbital contribution arising from the 4T1g ground state of Co(II).16 The value of χMT for complex 3 at 300 K is 5.55 cm3 K mol−1. As the temperature cools, χMT continuously decreases to 0.41 cm3 K mol−1 at 1.8 K. The magnetic susceptibilities of 1 and 3 can be ﬁtted well by the Curie−Weiss law χ = C/(T −θ), with θ = −9.76 K, C = 2.84 cm3 mol−1 K for 1, and θ = −8.16K, C = 5.73 cm3 mol−1 K for 3. The negative θ values of both suggest weak antiferromagnetic interaction between Co ions. Ferroelectric Property of Complex 2. Complex 2 crystallizes in a chiral space group (P2), which is associated with the point groups of C2; one of the ten polar point groups (C1, Cm, C2, C2v, C3, C3v, C4, C4v, C6, and C6v) may have the potential to display ferroelectric behavior. The electrical hysteresis loop of complex 2 was recorded under diﬀerent temperatures by using crystal sample plates.17 At room temperature, the remnant electric polarization (Pr) is 0.052 μC/cm2 and electric coercive ﬁeld (Ec) is 5.755 kV/cm, respectively; saturation of the spontaneous polarization (Ps) is ca. 0.451 μC/cm2. At 0 °C (blue curve), the remnant electric polarization and electric coercive ﬁeld are 0.015 μC/cm2 and 0.628 kV/cm, respectively; saturation of the spontaneous polarization is ca. 0.482 μC/cm2. When in liquid nitrogen conditions (red curve), the remnant electric polarization and electric coercive ﬁeld are 0.045 μC/cm2 and 2.052 kV/cm, and Figure 6.

Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg201362x | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 3426−3435 3433 the spontaneous polarization is ca. 0.682 μC/cm2 (Figure 7). Obviously, the remnant electric polarization and electric coercive ﬁeld are the least at 0 °C. The Pr and Ec of 2 is comparable with that of the crystal sample of MOF [Zn(1,4-bimb)(D-ca)]n [D- H2ca = D-camphoric acid, 1,4-bimb = 1,4-bis(imidazol-1- ylmethyl)-benzene] (Pr = 0.052 μC/cm2, Ec = 5.83 kV/cm),17h while smaller than compound [Zn2Co(tib)3(H2O)5]- [Zn6(tib)2(1,2,4-BTC)6]·12.7H2O [tib = 1,3,5-tris(1-imidazol- yl) benzene, 1,2,4-H3BTC = 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic acid] (Pr = 0.177 μC/cm2, Ec = 17.68 kV/cm).17i ■CONCLUSIONS In summary, a series of three-dimensional Co(II) and Zn(II) coordination polymers were prepared under solvothermal conditions by using TPOM and rigid polycarboxylate ligands. The results show that TPOM is a good candidate for construction coordination polymers with diverse structures. These compounds not only have intriguing structures but also exhibit interesting properties, which may be a good candidate for photoelectric and magnetic materials. It is anticipated that more and more coordination polymers containing TPOM will be synthesized with novel structures and properties. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Crystallographic data in CIF format; selected bond lengths and angles and patterns of photochemistry, TGA, and PXRD.
