Introduction In recent years, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with well-regulated network structures have received remarkable attentionasfunctionalmaterials withpotentialapplications in such fields as magnetism, molecular separation, catalysis, luminescence, and sorption.1 Up to now, though a large number of MOFs have been reported in the literature, the construction of novel architectures still remain a long-term challenge.2 Generally, the structure of the resultant frame- work is mainly influenced by various factors such as the ligand, anions, template, geometric requirements of metal atoms, and so on.3 Among them, the anions play animportant role in the construction of MOFs with distinctive structures. The role of anions can be explained in terms of their differ- ences in the size, the flexibility, the coordination ability, the number of the carboxylate groups, the positions of the carboxylate groups, the nature of the substituting groups, and coordination modes to metal ions.4 So far, the flexible ligands have been used widely in the construction of MOFs with interesting topologies and attrac- tive properties, as the flexible ligands have variable coordina- tion modes, and can adopt a variety of conformations accor- ding to the restrictions imposed by the coordination geometry of the metal ion.5 Among them, flexible multidentate ligands with imidazole nitrogen donors have been found to be one kind of most useful organic building block for constructing MOFs with versatile topologies such as cages, honeycombs, interpenetrating networks, and multidimensional frameworks architectures.6 In our previous work, we have reported lots of fascinating structures based on bis(imidazole) ligands.7 The results show that the imidazole-containing flexible ligands are good candidates for the construction of coordination poly- mers exhibiting interesting architectures. On the basis of the aforementioned points, in this work, we selected the flexible tetrakis(imidazole) ligand tetrakis(imida- zol-1-ylmethyl)methane (L) (Scheme 1) as the neutral ligand, and investigated the effect of anions (SO4 2-, 1,4-benzenedicar- boxylic acid, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, and 1,2,4,5-ben- zenetetracarboxylic acid) on the complex structures. Eight co- ordination polymers were obtained under hydrothermal con- ditions: [Zn2(L)(SO4)2] 3 2H2O (1), [Co(L)(SO4)] 3 1.25H2O (2), [Zn2(L)(L1)2] 3 3.5H2O (3), [Co2(L)(L1)2] 3 2.5H2O (4), [Zn2(L)- (L2)(H2L2)2] 3 5H2O (5), [Co1.5(L)(L2)] (6), [Zn2(L)(L3)] 3 4H2O (7), [Co(L)(H2O)2] 3 (H2L3) 3 1.5H2O (8), where H2L1=1,4-ben- zenedicarboxylic acid, H3L2=1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, andH4L3=1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylicacid.Allcompounds are characterized by elemental analysis and X-ray crystallogra- phy. The structures and topological analyses of these com- pounds, along with the influence of the ligands, metal atoms, and pH values on the structures of the MOFs are represented and discussed. The thermal and photoluminescent properties of these compounds have also been investigated. Experimental Section Materials and Methods.

The C, H, and N elemental analysis was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. The FT-IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the range 4000-400 cm-1 on a Mattson Alpha-Centauri spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer TG-7 analyzer heated from 40 to 800 C under nitrogen. The photoluminescent properties of the ligands and compounds were measured on a Perkin-Elmer FLS-920 spectrometer. Crystal Structure Determination. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for 1-5 were recorded on a Oxford Diffraction Gemini R Ultra diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo KR radiation (λ = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 293 K. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for 6-8 were recorded on a Oxford Diffraction Gemini R Ultra diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Cu KR radiation (λ = 1.54184 A˚ ) at 293 K. Absorption corrections were applied using multiscan technique. All the structures were solved by Direct Method of SHELXS-979 and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques using the SHELXL-97 program.10 The hydrogen atoms attached to carbons were generated geometrically. Some aqua hydrogen atoms of compounds 3, 4, and 7 were not included in the model. Other hydrogen atoms of water molecules and hydroxyl hydrogen atoms were located from difference Fourier maps and refined with isotropic displacement parameters. Non-hydrogen atoms of the complexes were refined with anisotropic temperature parameters except O7W and O7W0 for 7 were refined with isotropic temperature parameters. O3, O8, O2W, O3W, and O4W for 3, O3 and O3W for 4, O2 for 5, and O1W, O5W, and O7W for 7 are disordered. The disordered atoms were split over two sites, with a total occupancy of no more than 1. The hydrogen atoms of the disordered atoms were not included in the model. All H atoms bound to carbon were refined using a riding model with d(C-H) = 0.93 A˚ , Uiso = 1.2Ueq(C) for aromatic and 0.97 A˚ , Uiso =1.5 Ueq(C) for CH2 atoms. Water H atoms and hydroxyl H atoms were located in a difference Fourier map and refined as riding atoms with d(O-H) = 0.85-0.89 A˚ and Uiso = 1.5Ueq(O). The detailed crystallographic data and structure refinement parameters for these compounds are summarized in Table 1. Their selected bond distances and angles and hydrogen bonds are listed in Tables S1a-S8b (Supporting Information). Results and Discussion Structure of [Zn2(L)(SO4)2] 3 2H2O (1). The L reacted with ZnSO4 3 7H2O under hydrothermal conditions to give com- plex 1. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals a 2-fold interpenetrated net of 1 that crystallizes in space group P21/c. As shown in Figure 1a, there are two unique Zn(II) atoms (Zn1 and Zn2), one L ligand, two coordinated sulfate anions (SO4 2- (A) containing S1 atom and SO4 2- (B) containing S2 atom), and two lattice water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Both Zn1 and Zn2 ions adopt slightly distorted tetra- hedral coordination geometries. Each Zn1 atom is four- coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two individual L Scheme 1. Structures of the Organic Ligands Used in This Work 1948 Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 4, 2010 Bai et al. ligands (Zn1-N8#2 = 1.973(3) and Zn1-N1 =1.982(3) A˚ ) and two oxygen atoms from two SO4 2- (A) anions (Zn1- O2=1.960(3) and Zn1-O4#1=1.965(3) A˚ ). Each Zn2 atom is also four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two indivi- dual L ligands (Zn2-N5=1.998(3) and Zn2-N4#4=2.001(3) A˚ ), and two oxygen atoms from two SO4 2- (B) anions (Zn2- O8#3=1.920(3) and Zn2-O5=1.935(3) A˚ ). Each SO4 2- co- ordinatestotwoZn1ortwoZn2atomstoformaZn2(SO4)2unit in a bidentate bridging mode (Figure 1b). Each L ligand coordinates to two symmetry-related Zn1 and two symmetry- related Zn2 atoms to generate a one-dimensional (1D) ladder- like chain along the b axis (Figure 1c). These chains are further linked by SO4 2- (A) and SO4 2- (B) anions via Zn-O bonds to furnish a complicated 3D framework (Figure 1d). Actually, in order to simplify the rather intricate structure, the L ligands and the Zn2(SO4)2 units can be considered as four-connected nodes. Thus, the 3D complicated framework of 1 can be described as a 4-connected PtS net with a void of 14 A˚  17 A˚  10 A˚ . The large voids formed by a single 3D network allow incorpora- tion of the other identical network, giving a 2-fold interpene- trated PtS net (Figure 1e). It is interesting that for our previous reported [Cd2(L)2(SO4)2(H2O)2] 3 4H2O, the L ligands connect the Cd(II) centers to form a noninterpenetrated PtS network, in which the sulfate anions adopted the monodentate coordina- tion mode.8 In addition, there are intermolecular hydrogen-bond- ing interactions between the water molecules and the carboxylate oxygen atoms. The existence of the hydrogen bonds further stabilizes the structure of the 3D framework. Structure of [Co(L)(SO4)] 3 1.25H2O (2). When Zn(II) ion was replaced by Co(II) ion under similar synthetic conditions, a structurally different compound 2 was obtained. As shown in Figure 2a, the structure of 2 contains two unique Co(II) atoms, one L ligand, and one coordinated sulfate anion. Each Co(II) atom is six-coordinated by four nitrogen atoms from four L ligands (Co1-N4#1=2.086(2), Co1-N7 = 2.111(2), Co1-N2#3=2.152(2), and Co1-N6#4=2.185(3) A˚ ) and two oxygen atoms from two SO4 2- anions (Co1-O1=2.095(2) and Co1-O4#2=2.130(2) A˚ ), showing a distorted CoN4O2 octahedral coordination geometry. The SO4 2- anions bridge the Co(II) centers to yield a 1D chain in bidentate coordina- tion mode (Figure 2b) with a Co3 3 3 Co distance of 6.412 A˚ . The L ligands coordinate to the Co(II) centers as a tetradente ligands to form a 3D framework (Figure 2c), which is further stabilized by the SO4 2- anions via Co-O bonds (Figure 2d). From the topological view, if the L ligand can be considered as a four-connected node, the Co(II) center can be viewed as a six-connected node, and the SO4 2- anion can be viewed as a linker, then the framework of the compound 2 can be simpli- fied as a binodal (4,6)-connected topology with the Schl€afli symbol of (3 3 4 3 53 3 6)(32 3 4 3 54 3 67 3 7) (Figure 2e). Structure of [Zn2(L)(L1)2] 3 3.5H2O (3). When the organic dicarboxylate ligand H2L1 was used instead of the SO4 2- of 1 to examine the influence of the anions on the structures of the Table 1.

Article Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 4, 2010 1951 water molecules (Figure 3a). Zn1 is five-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two L ligands (Zn1-N6#1=2.050(4) and Zn1-N4 = 2.054(3) A˚ ) and three carboxylate oxygen atoms from two L1A ligands (Zn1-O5 = 2.013(4), Zn1- O7#2=2.130(5), and Zn1-O8#2=2.459(11) A˚ ), exhibiting a distorted trigonal bipyramid coordination environment. Zn2 is four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two L ligands (Zn2-N8#4=2.024(4) and Zn2-N1=2.032(4) A˚ ), and two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two L1B ligands (Zn2-O4#3=1.938(4) and Zn2-O1=1.948(4) A˚ ) in a dis- torted tetrahedral geometry. Each L1A ligand coordinates to two Zn1 centers (Scheme 2a) to furnish a 1D zigzag chain along the b axis (Figure 3b) with the Zn 3 3 3 Zn distance of 6.069 A˚ . Two L1B ligands connect two symmetry-related Zn2 atoms (Scheme 2b) to generate a Zn2(L1B)2 unit (Figure 3c) with the Zn 3 3 3 Zn distance of 4.176 A˚ . Each L ligand, acting as a tetradentate ligand, links symmetry- related Zn1 and Zn2 atoms to produce a two-dimensional (2D) layer parallel to the ab plane (Figure 3d), which are further bridged by two kinds of L1 anions to form a three- dimensional (3D) network (Figure 3e). Better insight into such intricate framework can be ac- cessed by reducing multidimensional structures to simple node-and-connecting nets. The Zn1 and L ligand can be assigned to two kinds of four-connected nodes, while the Zn2 can be considered as a three-connected node, and the L1A and L1B can be viewed as two kinds of linkers. Accordingly, the 3D complex framework of 3 can be simplified to a trinodal (3,4)-connected topology with the topological nota- tion of (63)(66)(65 3 8). Structure of [Co2(L)(L1)2] 3 2.5H2O (4). The structure of compound 4 is essentially isostructural with 3 (Figure 4). There are small differences between compounds 3 and 4. First, the coordination number of the mental center is different. In compound 4, the Co1 is six-coordinated in a distorted octahedral coordination environment, while in compound 3 the Zn1 is five-coordinated in a trigonal bipyr- amid coordination environment. Second, the coordination modes of the carboxylate ligands are different. The L1A ligand in compound 4 adopts the mode c (Scheme 2), whereas it adopts the mode b (Scheme 2) in compound 3. Structure of [Zn2(L)(L2)(H2L2)2] 3 5H2O (5). As shown in Figure 5a, the structure of 5 contains two unique Zn(II) atoms, one L ligand, one L2, one partially deprotonated H2L2 anion, and five lattice water molecules. Each Zn1 atom is four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two L ligands (Zn1-N1=2.007(5), Zn1-N3#2=1.980(4), Zn2- N6#4=2.016(4) and Zn2-N8#3=2.000(4) A˚ ) and two oxy- gen atoms from two L2 ligands (Zn1-O1=1.896(4), Zn1- O6#1=1.922(4), Zn2-O8=1.931(4) and Zn2-O3=1.962(4) A˚ ) in a distorted ZnN2O2 tetrahedral coordination geome- try. Each Zn2 atom is four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two L ligands (Zn2-N6#4=2.016(4) and Zn2- N8#3=2.000(4) A˚ ) and two oxygen atoms from one L2 ligand and one H2L2 (Zn2-O3 = 1.962(4) and Zn2-O8=1.931(4) A˚ ), respectively. Each L2 ligand coordinates two symmetry- related Zn1 centers and one Zn2 center to form a 1D chain along the b axis (Scheme 2d), while each H2L2 ligand coordinates to one Zn2 center (Scheme 2e) (Figure 5b). The L ligands connect the Zn1 and Zn2 atom to furnish a thick 2D layer parallel to the bc plane (Figure 5c), which is further stabilized by the H2L2 and L2 ligands (Figure 5d). From the topological view, the Zn1 and L ligand can be simplified as a 4-connected node, while the Zn2 and the L2 ligand can be considered as a 3-connected node. Thus, com- pound 5 can be viewed as a binodal (3,4)-connected 2D net with the Schl€afli notation of (62 3 8) (4 3 64 3 8) (Figure 5e). Structure of [Co1.5(L)(L2)] (6). As shown in Figure 6a, the structure of 6 contains one and a half Co(II) cations, one L ligand, and one L2 anion. The Co1 ion is five-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two L ligands(Co1-N1#3=2.047(4) and Co1-N7#2=2.043(4) A˚ ) and three oxygen atoms from two L2 ligands (Co1-O5#1=1.983(4), Co1-O3=2.036(3), and Co1-O4=2.304(3) A˚ ) in a trigonal bipyramid coordina- tion geometry. TheCo2 ion is six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two L ligands (Co2-N4#4=2.139(4) and Co2- N4=2.139(4) A˚ ) and four oxygen atoms from two L2 ligands (Co2-O2#4 = 2.101(3), Co2-O2 = 2.101(3), Co2-O1#4 = 2.155(3), and Co2-O1 = 2.155(3) A˚ ), showing a distorted octahedral coordination environment. Two symmetry-related Co1 centers and two L2 ligands constitute a four-membered ring, which is linked by the Co2 atoms (Scheme 2f) to furnish a 1D chain (Figure 6b). The L ligand, adopting a tridentate mode, connects to two symmetry-related Co1 and one Co2 atoms to form another 1D chain (Figure 6c). The two kinds of chains are furtherlinked by the Co(II) centerstogeneratea 3D framework (Figure 6d). As shown in Figure 6e, if Co1 and Co2 are simplified as two kinds of four-connected nodes and the L and L2 ligands are defined as one three-connected node, the 3D framework of 6 can be described as a trinodal (3,4)-connected topology with Schl€afli symbol of (4 3 82)2(42 3 84)(84 3 122). Structure of [Zn2(L)(L3)] 3 4H2O (7). The asymmetric unit of 7 contains two crystallographically independent Zn(II) atoms (Zn1 and Zn2), one L ligand, two kinds of L3 anions, and four lattice water molecules. As shown in Figure 7a, each Zn1 atom is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two L ligands (Zn1-N3#2 = 2.015(4) and Zn1-N1 = 2.026(5) A˚ ), and two oxygen atoms from two L3B ligands (Zn1-O5 = 1.931(4) and Zn1-O7#1 = 1.940(4) A˚ ), exhibiting a distorted ZnN2O2 tetrahedral coordination geometry. Each Zn2 atom is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two L ligands (Zn2-N6 = 1.989(4) and Zn2-N7#4 = 1.995(5) A˚ ) and two oxygen atoms from two L3A ligands (Zn2-O2 = 1.934(4) and Zn2-O4#3 = 1.951(4) A˚ ). Both L3A and L3B coordinate to Zn(II) centers in tetradentate modes. The L3A ligands link the Zn2 centers to form a 1D chain along the b axis, and L3B ligands link the Zn1 centers to generate a similar 1D chain (Figure 7b) along the b axis. Each L ligand coordinates to symmetry-related Zn1 and Zn2 atoms to generate a 1D ladderlike chain along the c axis (Figure 7c). The three kinds of chains are connected by the Zn(II) centers to generate a 3D framework (Figure 7d). From the topological view, if the Zn1, Zn2, L3A, L3B, and the L ligand can be viewed as five kinds of 4-connected nodes, the structure of 7 becomes a pentanodal net with the Schl€afli symbol of (4 3 6 3 84)- (42 3 64)(42 3 84)(42 3 83 3 10)(4 3 62 3 83) (Figure 7e). Structure of [Co(L)(H2O)2] 3 (H2L3) 3 1.5H2O (8). The asymmetric unit of 8 contains one crystallographically inde- pendent Co(II) atom, one L ligand, one partially deproto- nated H2L3 anion, two coordinated water molecules, and one and a half lattice water molecules. As shown in Figure 8a, each Co(II) atom is coordinated by four nitrogen atoms from four L ligands (Co1-N8#1 = 2.125(2), Co1-N4#2 = 2.135(2), Co1-N6#3=2.138(2), and Co1-N2=2.153(2) A˚ ) and two water molecules (Co1-O1W = 2.194(2) and Co1- O2W=2.103(2) A˚ ), exhibiting a distorted CoN4O2 octahedral coordination geometry. The L ligands coordinate to Co(II) 1952 Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 4, 2010 Bai et al. Figure 3.

Article Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 4, 2010 1953 centers in the tetradentate mode to form a 2D bilayer parallel to the ab plane with hexagonal channels along the c-axis (Figure 8b). Topologically, if Co(II) atoms and the L ligands can be viewed as two kinds of four-connected nodes, the structure of compound 8 is simplified as a uninodal 4-con- nected net with the Schl€afli symbol of (43 3 63) (Figure 8c). Also,itcanbe regarded as twoadjacent parallelhoneycomb63 layers linked by the nearest nodes. To the best of our knowl- edge, several casesof 2Dbilayer netsbasedon (44)-sql net have been reported; however, 2D bilayer nets based on the 63 net are rarely observed.11 In addition, the lattice water molecules and the partially deprotonated H2L3 anions, as uncoordi- nated couteranions, are filled in the channels. Further, the lattice water molecules and the H2L3 anions link the 2D bilayers to form a 3D supramolecular structure through the hydrogen O-H 3 3 3 O bonds (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Effects of the Ligands on the Structure of the Compounds. From the structure description above, we can see that the L ligand tetrakis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)methane (L) ligands can bend and rotate freely when coordinating to the central metals. There are six M-Ccenter-M (M = metal) angles (θ) (Table 2; Scheme 3) among any two metal centers and the center carbon atom of L (Ccenter) when the L ligands adopt tetradentate coordination mode (compounds 1-5, 7, and 8), while thereare only three M-Ccenter-M angles(θ) whenthe L ligands adopt tridentate coordination mode (compound 6). On the other hand, the anions play an important role in the formation of the structures. Compounds 1, 3, 5, and 7 contain the same L ligands and Zn(II) atoms. The differences of the anions lead to the distinction of the resultant structures. Compounds 1, 3, 5, and 7, as well as 2, 4, 6, and 8 exhibit the influence of the anions on the structures of the resultant frameworks, respectively. Here, we take compounds 1, 3, 5, and 7 for example. In compound 1, the SO4 2- coordinates to the Zn(II) centers in a μ2-bridged coordination mode, gener- ating a Zn2(SO4)2 unit. The L ligands further linked the Zn2(SO4)2 units to furnish a 2-fold interpenetrated PtS net. When dicarboxylate ligand H2L1, tricaboxylate ligand H3L2, and tetracarboxylate ligand H4L3 were utilized instead of the ZnSO4, three different compounds 3, 5, and 7 were obtained. The common feature of the three ligands is that all of them are carboxylate ligands with the existence of the benzene ring, while the only structural difference is the number of the carboxylate groups. In compound 3, two kinds of L1 ligands exist (L1contains two carboxylate groups). Each L1A ligand coordinates to two Zn1 centers to furnish a 1D zigzag chain, while two L1B ligands connect two symmetry-related Zn2 atoms, forming a Zn2(L1B)2 unit. The chains and the Zn2- (L1B)2 units are further connected by the L ligands via Zn-N bonds, leading to the formation of a trinodal (3,4)-connected 3D net with the topology of (63)(66)(65 3 8). In compound 5, each L2 ligand (L2 contains three carboxylate groups) connects the Zn(II) centers in tridentate coordination mode, forming a 1D chain, while the partially deprotonated H2L2 ligand co- ordinates to one Zn2 center, acting as a monodente ligand. As a result, compound 5 shows a binodal (3,4)-connected 2D net with the Schl€afli notation of (62 3 8)(4 3 64 3 8). In compound 7, the L3 ligands (L3 contains four carboxylate groups) link the Zn(II) centers in the tetradentate mode to form a 1D chain, which is further linked by the L ligands to generate a penta- nodal 3D (4 3 63 84)(42 3 64)(42 3 84)(42 3 83 3 10)(4 3 62 3 83) net. The structuraldifferencesshow that the carboxylate number has an important influence on the networks constructed by carbox- ylate ligands and metals, which further affect the framework of the resultant complexes. The Influence of the Metal Cations on the Framework. The metal centers also play an important role in the presence of L, as well as the same inorganic or carboxylate ligands. The frameworks of the final compounds are related to the coordi- nation environments of the metal ions. Although the same ligands were used under similar synthetic conditions, the com- pounds based on Zn(II) centers are quite different from those based on the Co(II) centers. The Zn(II) atoms in compounds 1, 3, 5, and 7 adopt the coordination numbers of 4, except that Zn1 in compound 3 shows the coordination number of 5. Compared with Zn(II) centers, the Co(II) atoms exhibit the Figure 4.

The structural differences between 5 and 6, as well as 7 and 8, may be related to the final pH values of the reaction. Compounds 6 and 7 were obtained with the final pH values of 6.7 and 6.2, respectively. And the carboxylic ligands of 6 and 7 are fully deprotonated. As a result, 6 shows a (3,4)-connected (4 3 82)2(42 3 84)(84 3 122) fra- mework. Compound 7 exhibits a (4 3 6 3 84)(42 3 64)(42 3 84)- (42 3 83 3 10)(4 3 62 3 83) net. Compounds 5 and 8 were isolated with lower final pH values of 4.3 and 4.0. Finally, the carboxylic ligands are partially deprotonated, resulting in the lower dimensional structures.

To estimate the stability of the coordi- nation architectures of compounds 1-8, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out. The experiments were performed on samples consisting of numerous single crystals of 1-8 under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 C/min (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Compound 1 lost its water molecules from 83 to 197 C (obsd 5.9%, calcd 5.18%). The anhydrous compound begins to decompose at 465 C, leading to the formation of ZnO as the residue (obsd Figure 7.

Article Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 4, 2010 1957 22.6%, calcd 23.42%). For compound 2, the first weight losses corresponding to the release of water molecules, are observed before 83 C (obsd 5.3%, calcd 4.38%), and the departure of organic components occurred from 287 C. The TGA curve of 3 shows that it undergoes dehydration in the range of 40-138 C (obsd 6.7%, calcd 7.38%). The decom- position of the anhydrous compound occurs at 296-762 C. For compound 4, the weight loss in the range of 92-273 C corresponds to the departure of water molecules (obsd 6.3%, calcd 5.44%). The removal of the organic components occurs in the range of 317-649 C. The remaining weight corresponds to the formation of Co2O3 (obsd 21.5%, calcd 20.03%). Compound 5 lost its water molecules from 40 to 174 C (obsd 9.0%, calculated 9.25%). The anhydrous components begin to decompose at 276 C. Compound 6 is stable up to 334 C, where the framework structure begins to collapse. For compound 7, the weight loss before 165 C corresponds to the release of water molecules (obsd 7.8%, calcd 9.12%), and the weight loss between 208 and 737 C is attributable to the departure of organic components. For compound 8, the weight loss attributed to the release of free water molecules is observed below 122 C (obsd 7.6%, calcd 8.87%), and the anhydrous compound starts decomposition after 242 C. Luminescent Properties. Coordination polymers with d10 metal centers and organic ligands are promising candidates for photoactive materials with potential applications.12 The solid-state photoluminescent properties of the free ligands and the compounds 1, 3, 5, and 7 have been investigated in the solid state at room temperature. The emission and excitation peaks are shown in Figure 9. The emission peak of free L ligand is observed at about 435 nm with the excitation peak at 365 nm, probably attributable to the π*fπ transitions.8 The emission peaks of H2L1, H3L2, and H4L3 are at 364 nm (λex = 261 nm), 363 nm (λex = 300 nm), and 398 nm (356 nm), respectively, which are probably attributable to the π* f n transitions.13 On complexation of these ligands with Zn(II) atom, the emission peaks occur at Figure 8.

Since the Zn2þ ions is difficult to oxidize or to reduce due to their d10 configuration, the emissions of compounds 1, 3, 5, and 7 are neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) in nature.14 They can probably be assigned to the intraligand charge transfer of L ligand because similar emission is observed for the neutral tetrakis(imidazole) ligand. The carboxylate ligands show almost no contribution to the emissions of the compounds, due to very weak fluorescent emission, resulting from a π* f n transition of carboxylate ligand, compared with the π* f π transition of L ligand and/ or fluorescence quenching of carboxy groups (which are strong electron withdrawing groups).15 The blue-shifts rela- tive to the free L ligand may be attributed to the coordination effects of the L ligands to Zn(II) cations, which increases the ligand conformational rigidity and reduces the nonradiative decay of the intraligand.16 The difference of the emission peaks is probably attributable to the differences of ligands and the coordination environment around central metal ions, because photoluminescence behavior is closely asso- ciated with the local environments around metal ions. Com- plexes 1, 3, 5, and 7, highly thermally stable and insoluble in common solvents, may be suitable as excellent candidates of photoactive materials. Conclusions We have successfully isolated eight 2D and 3D metal-or- ganic frameworks hydrothermally under similar synthetic conditions based on tetrakis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)methane (L). The structural differences show that the ligand and the metal center have great influences on the structure of the final assembly. The luminescent properties of the compounds 1, 3, Figure 9.
