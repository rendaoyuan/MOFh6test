Tel.: +91-33-473-4971; fax: +91-33-473-2805 Two novel polymeric networks of cadmium(II), [Cd2(ibn)(SeCN)4] n (1) (ibn=1,2-diamino-2-methylpropane) and [Cd(pyz)(SeCN)2] n (2) (pyz=pyrazine) have been synthesised and their molecular structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The polymer 1 consists of two 1D parallel chains of Cd(II), each having alternate tetrahedral (CdSe4) and octahedral (CdN6) Cd(II) centres bridged through selenocyanate, exhibiting symbiotic phenomena. The octahedral Cd(II) centre of one chain is linked with the tetrahedral Cd(II) centre of another chain through selenocyanate ligand resulting 1D ladder like structure. The complex 2 is a 2D network of octahedral Cd(II) (CdN4Se2) in which doubly selenocyanato bridged 1D coordination polymeric chains are linked through pyrazine ligand in a bc plane forming rectangular grid like structure. Two novel selenocyanate bridged complexes, [Cd2(ibn)(SeCN)4] n 1 (ibn=1,2-diamino-2 methyl propane) and [Cd(pyz)(SeCN)2] n 2 (pyz=pyrazine) have been synthesized and structurally characterized. Complex 1 exhibits ladder like structure with alternating tetrahedral (CdSe4) and octahedral (CdN6) cadmium(II) environments showing the symbiotic phenomena. Complex 2 possesses rectangular grid like structure in which both selenocynate and pyrazine are involved in bridging. Keywords Cadmium(II) complexes Coordination polymers Crystal structures Symbiosis 1 Introduction The design and synthesis of coordination polymers and supramolecules with specific network (e.g. H-bonding, π–π interactions etc.) via self-assembly is a promising route which leads to the formation of molecular materials in general [1–10]. These materials not only generate new insights into structural diversity but also exhibit encouraging potential applications. Using a ‘building block’ methodology, combination of inorganic spacers (halide, pseudohalide etc.) and organic spacers (4,4′-bipyridine, pyrazine etc.) with metal ions, a wide variety of supramolecular architectures having different molecular properties [11–14] has been produced. In our continuing work on the construction of new structural types of cadmium(II)-pseudohalide (SCN−, SeCN− etc.) in combination with different triamine ligands we have shown that triamine plays a vital role in the fabrication of novel functional architectures [15–18]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the extended π-conjugation system with the high polarizabilities within low-dimensional (1D or 2D) polymeric cadmium-pseudohalide gives rise to desirable anisotropic physical properties [19]. Self assembled of selenocyanate ligand with cadmium(II) metal centres can provide highly ordered and specific network in contrast to the SCN ligand [19] as the softer selenium centre is expected to coordinate more preferably to soft cadmium(II) centre [18,20]. Till date, a few reports on the versatility of the selenocyanate ion as a bridging ligand in different metal systems have been illustrated [18,20–24]. Therefore, in order to facilitate crystal engineering, controlling the dimensionality and structure property correlation, much work is required to extend the knowledge of the relevant structural types and establish proper synthetic strategies leading to desired species. In continuation, here, we now present design and one pot synthesis of metal-organic ladder and rectangular grid ( Scheme 1 ) of cadmium(II), [Cd2(ibn)(SeCN)4] n (1) (ibn=1, 2-diamino-2-methyl propane) and [Cd(pyz)(SeCN)2] n (2) (pyz=pyrazine). Compound 1 shows the unique symbiotic phenomena [25] with alternating octahedral (CdN6) and tetrahedral (CdSe4) centre. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents High purity (98%) 1,2-diamino-2-methylpropane, pyrazine and potassium selenocyanate were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company Inc. and used as received. All other chemicals used were of AR grade. 2.2 Physical measurements Elemental analyses (carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen) were performed using a Perkin–Elmer 240C elemental analyser and cadmium(II) content was estimated gravimetrically [26]. Infrared spectra (4000–400 cm−1) were taken using Nicolet Magna-IR 750 spectrometer series-II where KBr was used as medium. 2.3 Synthesis of complexes Complex [Cd2(ibn)(SeCN)4] n (1): an aqueous solution (5 cm3) of potassium selenocyanate (2 mmol, 0.288 g) was added to an aqueous solution (10 cm3) of cadmium perchlorate hexahydrate (1 mmol, 0.419 g) with constant stirring. After 10 min 1,2-diamino-2-methylpropane (ibn) (1 mmol, 0.088 g) was added slowly to the reaction mixture and stirred for 30 min. The resulting solution was filtered and the filtrate was kept in a CaCl2 desiccator. After a few days shiny crystals suitable for X-ray determination were obtained. Yield: 80%. Anal. Found: C, 13.15; H, 1.66; N, 11.47; Cd, 30.41. Calc. for C8H12Cd2N6Se4: C, 13.10; H, 1.63; N, 11.46; Cd, 30.67%. Complex [Cd(pyz)(SeCN)2] n (2): An aqueous solution (5 cm3) of potassium selenocyanate (2 mmol, 0.288 g) was added to an aqueous solution (10 cm3) of cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (1 mmol, 0.308 g) with vigorous stirring for about 10 min. A methanolic solution (5 cm3) of pyrazine was (1 mmol, 0.080 g) added to it very slowly with constant stirring. The resulting mixture was filtered and the filtrate was kept in a CaCl2 desiccator. After a few days shiny single crystals suitable for X-ray structural analysis were obtained. Yield: 75%. Anal. Found: C, 17.83; H, 0.98; N, 13.87; Cd, 27.87. Calc. for C6H4CdN4Se2: C, 17.80; H, 0.99; N, 13.85; Cd, 27.79%. 2.4 X-ray data collection and structure determination Suitable single crystals of complex 1 was mounted on a Siemens SMART CCD diffractometer whereas complex 2 was mounted on Rigaku/AFC 7S diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromated Mo Kα (λ=0.71069 Å) radiation. The intensity data were corrected for Lp [27] and an empirical absorption corrections were also employed using saint program [28] for complex 1 and using ψ scan for complex 2. For 1 a total of 3329 reflections were measured and 2775 were assumed observed applying the condition I>2σ(I), and 471 reflections were measured and 418 were assumed observed applying the condition I>2σ(I) for complex 2. Both the structures were solved by Patterson syntheses and followed by successive Fourier and difference Fourier syntheses. Full matrix least-squares refinements on F 2 were carried out using shelxl-97 with anisotropic displacement parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms were constrained to ride on the respective carbon or nitrogen atoms with an isotropic displacement parameter equal to 1.2 times the equivalent isotropic displacement parameter of their parent atom. The refinement converged to residual indices R=0.0352 and 0.0197; wR 2=0.0953 and 0.0550 with I>2σ(I) for complexes 1 and 2, respectively. Complex neutral atomic scattering factors [29] were used throughout. The final difference Fourier map showed the minimum and maximum peak heights of −1.55 and 0.95 e Å−3 for complex 1 and −0.45 and 0.53 e Å−3 for complex 2. All calculations were carried out using shelxs-97 [30], shelxl-97 [31], platon-99 [32] and ortep-3 [33] programs. All crystallographic data for complexes 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 2 and H-bonding parameters in Table 3 for complex 1. For complex 2 the selected bond lengths and angles are displayed in Table 4 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 IR spectra The complex 1 shows several split strong bands in the range 3270–3356 cm−1, which can be assigned to the ν(NH) stretching frequency of the corresponding diamine ligand. Several bands in the range 2869–2950 cm−1 are assigned to the aliphatic ν(CH) stretching vibrations for complex 1. The free SeCN ligand shows one sharp band corresponding to ν(CN) at 2070 cm−1. The most intense split band is observed assigned to ν(CN) at 2113, 2134 cm−1 for complex 1 and only one sharp band at 2133 cm−1 for complex 2. The higher frequency correlates that all the selenocyanato groups in both the complexes are involved in bridging with same environment [34]. All other bands appear at their usual positions. 3.2 Description of structure [Cd2(ibn)(SeCN)4] n (1) An ortep drawing with atom numbering scheme of complex 1 is shown in Fig. 1 . X-ray structure determination reveals that it is a neutral infinite molecular ladder in which selenocyanate anions function both as support and rung. According to Fig. 1, two adjacent racemic chains are interlinked by selenocyanate anions to form a one-dimensional ladder like chain. Every chain running parallel to b-axis comprises of alternating octahedral and tetrahedral cadmium(II) centres bridging through selenocyanate anions. Tetrahedral and octahedral centres possess the chromophores CdSe4 and CdN6, respectively. The supports are alternatively singly and doubly bridged evident from the extended structure shown in Fig. 2 . Although there was only one observation of alternating tetrahedral and octahedral array in cadmium(II) system [18], it is to be remembered that no analogous ladder structure has yet been reported previously in the cadmium(II)–selenocyanate system. The Cd1 atom exists in a distorted octahedral environment. The nitrogen atoms, N3 and N6 (Cd1N3, 2.258(6); Cd1N6, 2.334(6) Å) of the diamine ligand (ibn) and two nitrogen atoms, N2 and N5, (Cd1N2, 2.355(6); Cd1N5, 2.336(6) Å) from two different bridging as well as supporting selenocyanate anions describe the equatorial plane around Cd1 atom. The axial positions are occupied by N4 atom (Cd1N4, 2.375(6) Å) of the rung selenocyanate anion and N1 atom (Cd1N1, 2.374(6) Å) of another bridging as well as support selenocyanate anion. The deviation of Cd1 from the mean plane formed by the four equatorial nitrogen atoms is 0.025(1) Å and the maximum deviation of N5 atom from plane among all the equatorial nitrogen atoms is 0.156(7) Å. The Cd2 atom is in distorted tetrahedral environment, being coordinated by four selenocyanato Se donors (Cd2Se1, 2.6646(9); Cd2Se2, 2.6756(10); Cd2Se3, 2.6110(10); Cd2Se4, 2.6378(11) Å). The degrees of distortion from an ideal octahedral geometry are reflected in the cisoid [74.9(2)°–102.8(2)°] and transoid angles [165.9(2)°–169.1(2)°]. It is interesting to note that only nitrogen atoms surround the octahedral centres (Cd1) whereas only selenium atoms surround the tetrahedral centers (Cd2). The nitrogen atoms of the diamine ligand ‘harden’ Cd1, so the selenocyanate anions are bonded to it preferentially through N atoms. Conversely the soft ends (Se atoms) of the selenocyanate anions are coordinated to tetrahedral Cd2 making it ‘soft’. Thus all the selenium atoms of selenocyanate ligand are clubbed together around Cd2. The bridging Cd1NC and Cd2SeC are in the range 148.5(5)°–172.7(6)° and 93.3(2)°–99.8(2)°, respectively. The selenocyanate ligands are quasi linear [range 175.8(7)°–178(6)°]. The bond distances and angles are comparable to other similar selenocyanato bridging systems [18,23c]. The linkage forming the rungs of the ladder has a Cd1⋯Cd2 distance of 6.523 Å and the bridges forming the side of the ladder have Cd1⋯Cd2 distances of 5.468 Å for double selenocyanate bridge and of 6.035 Å for single selenocyanate bridge. It is worth noting that there are two types of hydrogen bonding due to N6 donor of diamine ligand forming an intra-ladder hydrogen bonds with N2 atom of a selenocyanate (H6B⋯N2, 2.5706; N6⋯N2, 3.369(8) Å; N6H6B⋯N2, 148.15°) and due to N5 atom of diamine ligand forming one hydrogen bond with Se1 atom of adjacent ladder (H5B⋯Se1, 2.9014; N5Se1, 3.791(7) Å; N5H5B⋯Se1, 169.78°). As shown in Fig. 3 , this arrangement results in a supramolecular 2D sheet in bc-plane. 3.3 Description of structure [Cd(pyz)(SeCN)2] n (2) Complex 2 is made up of a 2D neutral rectangular-grid layer (Fig. 4 ). The pyrazine ligand is in μ-mode and forms [Cd(μ-pyrazine)] n chain running along parallel to b-axis. The SeCN anion is also in μ-mode and bridges two Cd atoms in adjacent chains, resulting in a rectangular-grid coordination layer in bc-plane. The principal structural features of the present complex with atom labelling scheme are shown in Fig. 4. The structure determination reveals that the cadmium atom, Cd, occupies 2/m site [1/2,1/2,1/2]. Se, C and N atoms of selenocyanate ligand are located on a mirror plane [x,1/2, z] and N1 atom of pyrazine ligand lies on a twofold axis [1/2, y,1/2]. The geometry around Cd atom is a distorted octahedron. The two nitrogens (Na and Ni, a=x, y,−1+z; i=1−x, y,2−z) of the selenocyanate anion are in the equatorial plane [CdNa/Ni 2.296(5) Å] together with two nitrogens (N1 and N1h, h=1−x,1−y,1−z) of pyrazine ligand [CdN1/N1h 2.429(5) Å]. The Se atoms (Se and Seg, g=1−x, y,1−z) of selenocyanate anion occupy trans-axial sites [CdSe/Seg 2.7987(9) Å]. The axial distance is larger than the CdSe distances of complex 1. The cisoid angles are in the range 86.11(11)°–93.83(11)° and the transoid angles are 180°. The equatorial plane is essentially planar with Cd atom. The bridging CdSeC angles [96.23(18)°] and CdNC (SeCN) [169.1(4)°] are comparable with those found in other similar complexes [18,23c]. The pyrazine moieties of alternate layers are found to shift towards the SeCN moieties (Fig. 5 ). The Cd⋯Cd distance of pyrazine linkage is 7.647 Å and that of SeCN linkage is 6.007 Å. The distance between the two adjacent layers is 5.485 Å. 4 Conclusions Two new coordination polymers of selenocynato-bridged cadmium(II) complexes are synthesized in combination of two organic (ibn and pyz) ligands. Single crystal X-ray diffractions are carried out to determine the structures of complexes. In complex 1, reaction of cadmium selenocyanate with ibn results in two 1D parallel chains of cadmium(II), each having alternate tetrahedral (CdSe4) and octahedral (CdN6) centres bridged through selenocyanate exhibiting symbiotic phenomena, whereas in complex 2, reaction of cadmium selenocyanate with pyrazine generates a 2D network in which doubly selenocyanato bridged 1D coordination polymeric chains are linked through the pyrazine ligand forming rectangular grid in bc plane. In our recent work [18], [Cd(medien)(SeCN)2] n 1a is 1D polymeric chain with CdN4Se2 octahedra and [Cd(iprdien)(SeCN)2] n 1b is 2D network with alternating CdN6 octahedra and CdSe4 tetrahedra. In the synthesis of the compounds 1, 1a of 1b we have taken three different amines keeping other reagents and synthetic procedure the same. The complex 1a showed usual structural features that each cadmium atom was coordinated by both N and Se atoms, but the generation of two types of Cd environments in complexes 1 and 1b are rather unique. The ‘ibn’ (contains two methyl group at one C atom) and ‘iprdien’ (contains one isopropyl group at one end of primary N-atom) are asymmetric ligands in comparison to ‘medien’ (contains one methyl group at central N-atom) and exert greater steric forces which may be the responsible for the formation of the alternating octahedral (CdN6) and tetrahedral (CdSe4) centres as tetrahedral geometry occupies less space than the octahedral geometry. On the other hand, tetrahedral cadmium centres have sp3 hybridization and the octahedral centres have sp3d2 hybridization leading to tetrahedral centre more electronegative than the octahedral centre. Thus, according to the Jørgenson symbiotic theory, [25] the hard species will tend to increase the hardness of the atom to which they are bound and thus increase its tendency to attract more hard species, i.e. ‘ibn’ and ‘iprdien’ ligands increase the hardness of octahedral cadmium(II) which preferably bind the N-atoms of the ambidentate SeCN ligand. And in case of thiocyanate ligand we reported the symbiotic phenomena between two octahedral cadmium centres (CdN6 and CdS6) [17]. The occurrence of such phenomenon in between octahedral and tetrahedral cadmium(II) centres in title complex 1 is probably due to the large size of Se (more soft) in comparison to small size S atom (less soft). For complex 2 the molar ratio of metal–selenocyanate–pyz (1:1:1) is very much important and the use ‘organic-rod’ pyrazine enhances the formation of grid-like structure. The above facts indicate the utility and reliability of the selenocyanate moiety as spacer in forming coordination polymer and also reveal that the variation of organic spacer profoundly influences the packing of the polymeric complexes. 5 Supplementary data Crystallographic data for the structural analysis have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, CCDC Nos. 177056 and 177057 for complexes 1 and 2.
