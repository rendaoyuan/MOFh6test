Graphical abstract A series of three 1-D and 2-D copper benzenedicarboxylate coordination polymers has been constructed using the conformationally flexible and hydrogen-bonding capable tethering ligand N,N-bis(3-pyridylmethyl)piperazine (3-bpmp). Structural and spectral characterization and thermogravimetric analysis is reported. A family of three copper benzenedicarboxylate coordination polymers has been constructed using the conformationally flexible and hydrogen-bonding capable tethering ligand N,N′-bis(3-pyridylmethyl)piperazine (3-bpmp). These three coordination polymers have been characterized via single crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and elemental and thermogravimetric analysis. {[Cu(ph)(Hph)(H3-bpmp)(H2O)]·3H2O} (1, ph=phthalate) manifests a 1-D chain motif held into a pseudo 3-D supramolecular structure through hydrogen bonding. While both {[Cu(ip)(3-bpmp)(H2O)]·2H2O} (2, ip=isophthalate) and [Cu(tp)(3-bpmp)] (3, tp=terephthalate) exhibit 2-D (4,4) rhomboid grid-like layers, they possess different layer stacking patterns and supramolecular interactions due to coordination geometry variances. Keywords Copper Benzenedicarboxylate Imine Tethering ligand Coordination polymer Thermogravimetric analysis Crystal structure 1 Introduction The synthesis and characterization of coordination polymers remains a very active research area due to the potential utility of these phases in gas storage [1], shape-selective separations [2], ion-exchange [3], catalysis [4], and optical applications [5]. Aromatic di- and tricarboxylate ligands have proven extremely advantageous for the construction of a wide variety of structurally novel coordination polymers due to their ability to adopt divergent carboxylate binding modes in response to geometric requirements imposed by different metal ions or ancillary ligands [6–14]. These multi-anionic ligands provide both structural rigidity and the requisite charge balance necessary to avoid incorporation of small anions, an important requirement if porous materials are to be obtained. Copper di- and tricarboxylates represent an especially fertile coordination polymer system, exhibiting a wide variety of unprecedented structural motifs and intriguing physicochemical properties. [Cu3(btc)2(H2O)3] n (btc=1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) [15] possesses a complex 3-D structure with orthogonal square-shaped nanotubular cavities and a large incipient void volume that permits exchange of its aquo ligands with small amines. [Cu(tp)(H2O)2] n (tp=terephthalate) forms 1-D polymeric chains and manifests tp-mediated antiferromagnetic coupling and low temperature spin-canting behavior; the magnetic properties of its 2-D pseudopolymorph differ because of adjustment of both the coordination geometry at copper and the carboxylate binding mode [16]. The 2-D phase {[Cu2(ip)2(DMF)]·H2O·DMF·(ethanol)0.5} (ip=isophthalate) undergoes facile desolvation to produce a material with high permanent porosity with hysteretic methanol and benzene absorption behavior [17]. Structural complexity of copper dicarboxylate coordination polymers has been enhanced through the incorporation of organodiimines such as pyridine (py), 2,2′-bipyridine (2,2′-bpy) or 4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-bpy) [18–22]. Zaworotko and colleagues [18] discovered the first-ever coordination polymer Kagome lattice, contained within the structure of {[Cu2(py)2(ip)2]3}. {[Cu(ip)(2,2′-bpy)]·2H2O} displays 1-D [Cu(ip)] n helices locked together by supramolecular hydrogen bonding into a 2-D racemic layer [19], while the 2-D bilayer structure of [Cu(ip)(4,4′-bpy)] is formed from 1-D [Cu2(ip)2] n double chains conjoined through tethering 4,4′-bpy ligands [20]. Williams and co-workers employed terephthalate to prepare the rare 3-D mixed valence CuI/CuII coordination polymer [Cu4(tp)3(4,4′-bpy)2] n [21]; a different solvent mixture promoted the formation of a 2-D {[Cu(tp)(4,4′-bpy)](H2tp)} layered phase that retained its structural integrity upon elimination of the interlamellar terephthalic acid guest molecules [22]. Given these prior results, we were encouraged that variance of the organoimine component in mixed-ligand aromatic dicarboxylate copper coordination polymers could potentially expand the scope of this interesting class of materials. We therefore sought to investigate the under-utilized organodiimine N,N′-bis(3-pyridylmethyl)piperazine (3-bpmp, Scheme 1 ) as a tethering co-ligand for the construction of coordination polymers, wherein the conformational flexibility and hydrogen bonding capability of the central piperazinyl moiety could likely serve an ancillary structure-directing role during self-assembly. Herein we report the results of our first synthetic forays with 3-bpmp, with the structural characterization and thermogravimetric analysis of the 1-D chain compound {[Cu(ph)(Hph)(H3-bpmp)(H2O)]·3H2O} (1, ph=phthalate) and the 2-D layered phases {[Cu(ip)(3-bpmp)(H2O)]·2H2O} (2) and [Cu(tp)(3-bpmp)] (3). 2 Experimental 2.1 General considerations Copper nitrate hexahydrate and benzenedicarboxylic acids were obtained from Aldrich. N,N′-Bis(3-pyridylmethyl)piperazine (3-bpmp) was prepared via a published procedure [23]. Water was deionized above 3MΩ in-house. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a TA Instruments TGA 2050 Thermogravimetric Analyzer with a heating rate of 10°C/min up to 900°C. Elemental analyses were carried out using a Perkin Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS/O Analyzer.

Reflection data was acquired using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.71073Å). The data was integrated via saint [24]. Lorentz and polarization effect and absorption corrections were applied with sadabs [25]. The structures were solved using direct methods and refined on F 2 using shelxtl [26]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms bound to carbon atoms were placed in calculated positions and refined isotropically with a riding model. Supramolecular contacts (hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking) were probed and calculated using platon [27]. Compound 1 crystallized only in the habit of thin small plates. Multiple crystals were poorly diffracting, especially at high 2Θ angles; nevertheless refinement gave a reasonable set of R 1 and wR 2 values. Relevant crystallographic data for 1–3 are listed in Table 1 . 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Synthesis and spectral characterization Hydrothermal treatment of copper nitrate, 3-bpmp, and the requisite benzenedicarboxylic acid permitted production of single crystals of 1–3 as monophasic products. Once formed, the crystalline solids remained insoluble in water and common organic solvents. The infrared spectra of all materials were consistent with their crystal structures. Features corresponding to pyridyl ring flexing and puckering modes were observed in the region between 600cm−1 and 820cm−1. Medium intensity bands in the range of ∼1600cm−1 to ∼1200cm−1 arise from stretching modes of the aromatic rings of the dicarboxylate ligands and pyridyl rings within the 3-bpmp ligands [28]. Bands between 3050cm−1 and 3150cm−1 represent C–H stretching modes. Asymmetric and symmetric C–O stretching modes of the benzenedicarboxylate moieties were evidenced by very strong, slightly broadened bands at 1590cm−1 and 1377cm−1 (1), 1553cm−1 and 1383cm−1 (2), or 1595cm−1 and 1342cm−1 (3). The Δν values of ∼230 to 250cm−1 are consistent with monodentate coordination of the carboxylate units [29]; the slight redshifting of the asymmetric carboxylate stretching band for 2 could be ascribed to the presence of its chelating terminus. A band for the protonated uncoordinated carboxylate group in 1 was observed at 1716cm−1. Broad spectral features in the region of ∼3400cm−1 for 1 and 2 cases represent O–H stretching modes within bound and/or co-crystallized water molecules, and the N–H stretching mode for the protonated piperazinyl moiety in 1. 4.2 Structural description of {[Cu(ph)(Hph)(Hbpmp)(H2O)]·3H2O} (1) According to single-crystal X-ray diffraction, compound 1 possesses an asymmetric unit consisting of two crystallographically distinct copper atoms on inversion centers, one bpmp molecule that is protonated at one of its piperazinyl nitrogen atoms, one aqua ligand, one phthalate (ph) dianion, and one hydrogen phthalate (Hph) monoanion (Fig. 1 ). Three water molecules of crystallization are also present in the asymmetric unit; one of these is disordered over two positions in a 70/30 ratio. The coordination environment about Cu1 is a Jahn–Teller distorted [CuO4N2] octahedron with longer bond lengths to the trans aqua ligands. The nitrogen donors, belonging to two different Hbpmp ligands, are also arranged in a trans fashion. The coordination sphere is rounded out by oxygen donor atoms from two different doubly deprotonated ph dianions. In contrast to Cu1, Cu2 manifests a [CuO2N2] square planar coordination geometry, where the oxygen and nitrogen donors belong to two symmetry related Hph monoanions and H3-bpmp ligands, respectively. Long “4+2” interactions (2.940Å) exist between Cu2 and unligated carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2). Bond lengths and angles about Cu1 and Cu2 are given in Table 2 . Extension of the structure along the c crystal direction generates a 1-D sinusoidal [Cu(ph)(Hph)(H3-bpmp)(H2O)] n coordination polymer chain, wherein [Cu(ph)2(H2O)2]2− and [Cu(Hph)2] units are linked together through the exobidentate H3-bpmp+ tethers with a Cu⋯Cu distance of 10.087Å (Fig. 2 ). The H3-bpmp+ ligand adopts a “U”-shaped conformation within the chain motif, with an angle (defined as κ) between its two nitrogen termini of 110.3° as measured from the centroid of its piperazine ring. Neighboring chains interact along the a crystal direction through hydrogen bonding between the aqua ligands in one chain and unligated carboxylate oxygen atoms (O7) belonging to the fully deprotonated ph ligand bound to Cu1, forming a pseudo 2-D layer substructure coincident with the ac crystal plane. In turn, these aggregate into the full pseudo 3-D crystal structure of 1 through a hydrogen bonding pattern from the protonated piperazinyl nitrogen atoms within the H3-bpmp ligands in one chain to unligated water molecule dimers situated between chains, and on to the unligated oxygen atoms (O2) of the ligated carboxylate groups of the ph ligands in neighboring chains in different pseudo 2-D layers (Fig. 3) . Geometric details for the hydrogen bonding interactions in 1 are given in Table 3 . 4.3 Structural Description of {[Cu(ip)(3-bpmp)(H2O)]·2H2O} (2) The asymmetric unit of compound 2 consists of one divalent copper atom, one ip dianion, one 3-bpmp moiety, one aqua ligand, and two water molecules of crystallization (Fig. 4 ). The coordination environment about copper is a distorted [CuO4N2] octahedron with two nitrogen donors from two different 3-bpmp ligands arranged in a trans manner. Two cis oxygen donors are part of a chelating carboxylate endgroup of an ip ligand; the remaining coordination sites are occupied by the aqua ligand and an ip oxygen donor atom from a monodentate carboxylate group. The bond lengths and angles about the Cu atom in 2 are consistent with the Jahn–Teller active d9 electronic configuration (Table 4 ); the long trans bond lengths exist between Cu and the aquo ligand (O5) and one of the oxygen donors of the chelating ip carboxylate group (O1). Copper atoms are conjoined by exobidentate chelating/monodentate ip ligands to form [Cu(ip)] n chains that run along the b crystal direction; the through-ligand Cu–Cu contact distance of 10.253(3)Å marks the b lattice parameter. These in turn establish a 2-D [Cu(ip)(3-bpmp)(H2O)] n (4,4) rhomboid grid layered coordination polymer morphology by linkage through exobidentate bpmp tethers (Fig. 5 ). Unlike in 1, the methylpyridyl arms of the 3-bpmp ligands are almost completely splayed open, with a κ angle of 174.7°. As a result, the Cu⋯Cu distance through the 3-bpmp tethers is significantly longer than in 1, at 12.714Å. The Cu⋯Cu through-space distances across the pinched rhomboid grid voids measure 9.058Å and 21.248Å, with Cu⋯Cu⋯Cu angles of 44.9° and 135.1°. Two individual [Cu(ip)(3-bpmp)(H2O)] n layers, related by crystallographic inversion, aggregate into a double layer motif through hydrogen bonding mediated by water molecule dimers situated in the interlamellar region (Fig. 6 ). Water molecules of crystallization (O1W) bridge unligated carboxylate oxygen atoms (O4) and piperazinyl nitrogen atoms (N2) in one layer with the aquo ligands (O5) in the other layer. The other water molecule of crystallization, O2W, engages in hydrogen bonding with O1W and the ligated carboxylate oxygen atom O2. The interlamellar regions filled by the water molecules of crystallization occupy 7.3% of the unit cell volume, according to a calculation performed with platon. Hydrogen bonding information is given in Table 3. Double layer units stack along the c crystal direction in an ABAB pattern, primarily through π–π interactions between the phenyl rings of the ip ligands (centroid-to-centroid distance=3.798(2)Å). 4.4 Structural description of [Cu(tp)(3-bpmp)] (3) The asymmetric unit of compound 3 contains a copper atom on a crystallographic inversion center, one half of a terephthalate anion, and one half of a 3-bpmp moiety. The coordination environment at copper is a [CuO2N2] square planar arrangement with trans oxygen and nitrogen donors from two different tp and 3-bpmp ligands, respectively (Fig. 7 ). Bond lengths and angles (Table 5 ) are standard for divalent square planar coordinated copper ions. Long-range “4+2” interactions, common for the Jahn–Teller active Cu2+ ion, are present between the unligated tp oxygen atoms and copper (Cu⋯O distance=2.749(2)Å). Adjacent copper atoms are connected along the c crystal direction by bridging bismonodentate tp dianions to form [Cu(tp)] n chains with a Cu⋯Cu distance of 10.907Å. In turn these chains are conjoined into a 2-D [Cu(tp)(3-bpmp)] n (4,4) rhomboid grid coordination polymer layer via tethering 3-bpmp ligands (Fig. 8 ), with a Cu⋯Cu distance of 12.809Å through the organodiimine. The κ angle across the 3-bpmp ligand is 180°, restricted by the crystallographic symmetry, enforcing the longest Cu⋯Cu distance in the series 1–3. The Cu⋯Cu through-space distances across the rhomboid grids measure 9.077 and 21.992Å, with Cu⋯Cu⋯Cu angles of 44.1° and 135.9°. Due to the flexibility of the 3-bpmp ligands, these parameters are not dissimilar from those seen in 2, despite the lack of ligated or unligated water molecules in 3. Neighboring [Cu(tp)(3-bpmp)] n layers stack in a simple AAA pattern, with the interlayer Cu⋯Cu distance of 5.952Å defining the a lattice parameter (Fig. S1). As no classical hydrogen bonding or π–π stacking is present within the structure of 3, the layers aggregate solely via weaker crystal packing forces. 4.5 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermogravimetric analysis was performed in order to probe the thermal stability of coordination polymers 1–3. Compound 1 underwent dehydration between ∼30°C and ∼110°C, with a 9.6% mass loss consistent with the expulsion of 4equiv. of water (9.9% calc.). At ∼160°C removal of the organic ligands commenced, with a series of mass losses complete by ∼550°C. The final 10.5% mass remnant at ∼850°C is consistent with CuO (10.8% calc.). Compound 2 underwent stepwise dehydration between ∼40°C and ∼210°C, totalling 9.7% of the original mass (9.8% calc. for 3equiv. of water). Decomposition of the coordination polymer layers likely occurred above ∼210°C, as revealed by a significant and rapid mass loss. The mass remnant of 15.0% at ∼900°C corresponds roughly with a deposition of CuO (14.4% calc.). Compound 3 remained intact to ∼250°C whereupon its organic components were rapidly ejected. The final mass remnant of 15.4% at ∼850°C corresponds to CuO (16.0% calc.). TGA traces for 1–3 are given in Figs. S2–S4, respectively. 5 Conclusion Three divalent copper coordination polymers incorporating benzenedicarboxylate isomers and the rarely used tethering organodiimine bis(3-pyridylmethyl)piperazine have been prepared through a low temperature solution phase route. The donor disposition and binding mode within the specific benzenedicarboxylate isomer used, along with the conformational flexibility of the organodiimine, allowed the self-assembly of one- and two-dimensional coordination polymer matrices. Although the flexibility of the tethering bpmp ligand permitted the construction of two-dimensional layer motifs in both the isophthalate and terephthalate cases 2 and 3, a different layer stacking pattern is observed due to differences in coordination geometry and the supramolecular environment. As expected, 2 and 3 exhibit greater thermal robustness than 1 due to their higher dimensionality. The three different structures uncovered in this study hint at a rich coordination polymer chemistry accessible with the bis(3-pyridylmethyl)piperazine ligand. Studies in this direction are underway in our laboratory. Acknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge Michigan State University for financial support of this work.
