Four new coordination polymers, namely, {Hemim·[Ag(Hssa)(H2O)]}n (1), {[Ag(ina)2 Ag(Hssa)]·CH3OH·H2O} n (2), {[Ag2(Hssa)(dmp)1.5]·2H2O} n (3) and [Ag2(Hssa)(daoc)] n (4) (Hssa: 5-Sulfosalicylate, emim: 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole, ina: isonicotinamide, dmp: 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and daoc: 1,8-diaminooctane) were synthesized and characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermal analysis techniques.

Keywords Silver(I) complex 5-Sulfosalicylate complexes Argentophilic interactions 1D and 3D coordination polymers 1 Introduction The researches on the design and construction of coordination polymers have been increased due to their fascinating structural topologies and tremendous potential applications in gas storage, molecular magnetism, catalysis, luminescence, non-linear optic and sensor, so on [1–5]. Several factors, such as organic linkers, metal ion, metal–ligand ratio, solvent, pH value and temperature are effective on the self-assembly process of coordination polymers [6–8]. Among these factors, organic linkers play a curial role in directing the final structures of coordination polymers. The general strategy for the construction of coordination polymer is to utilize multidentate ligand which can act as bridging ligand. In the present study, 5-sulfosalicylic acid (H3ssa) was used in the syntheses of coordination polymers. It contains three potential coordinating groups –OH, –COOH, –SO3H and can be partly or fully deprotonated to provide various coordination modes [9–11]. 5-sulfosalicylic acid and its metal complexes have various biological activities like anti-ulcer, anti-microbial, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory as well as luminescence properties [9,12]. Hence, it was selected in the syntheses of coordination polymers. Moreover, although there are lots of transition metal complexes with 5-sufosalicylate in literature [13–15] silver complexes are very rare. Silver (I) complexes exhibit argentophilic Ag⋯Ag interactions which result in new high-dimensional structures and have high luminescence properties [16–18]. Silver complexes usually exhibit ligand-supported or ligand-unsupported argentophilic Ag⋯Ag interactions resulting high luminescence properties. If two silver (I) ions connected by anions or neutral ligands generate close Ag⋯Ag interactions and distance of the Ag⋯Ag interaction is shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii of silver (I) ions, this situation is a ligand supported argentophilic interaction. The argentophilic Ag⋯Ag interaction forming without any support from neutral ligands or anions is an unsupported argentophilic interaction [19]. In this study, silver-5-sulfosalicylate coordination polymers with some N-donor ligands were synthesized and characterized by IR, single crystal X-ray diffraction as well as elemental analysis. Photoluminescence and thermal properties were investigated in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and measurements All chemicals used were analytical reagent and commercially purchased. IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr pellets in the rage of 400–4000cm−1. Elemental analyses for C, H, N and S were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 2400C Elemental Analyzer. The photoluminescence spectra for the solid complex samples were acquired on a Perkin-Elmer LS-55 spectrophotometer. TG, DTG and DTA analyses were performed with a Perkin Elmer Diamond TG/DTA Thermal Analyzer under a static airatmosphere with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 in the temperature range 30–700°C using platinum pan. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) were obtained from 5° to 50° 2θ at a rate of 5°min−1 using a Rikagu Smartlab X-ray diffractometer operating at 40kV and 30mA with Cu-Kα radiation (λ=1.5406nm). Suitable crystals of 1–4 were selected for data collection which was performed on a Bruker APEX-II diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromatic Mo-Kα radiation at 296K. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 [20] and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods on F 2 using SHELXL-97 [20] from within the WINGX [21] suite of software. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic parameters. The H atoms of C atoms were located from different maps and then treated as riding atoms with C–H distances of 0.93–0.97Å. All other H atoms were located in a difference map refined subject to a DFIX restraint. In 1 and 4, the large s.u. values and displacement parameters of some C atoms are caused by the disorder. This disorder was modeled as two different orientations, with occupancy factors of 0.438(8) and 0.562(8) for 1 and 0.30(2) and 0.70(2) for 4, respectively. Molecular diagrams were created using MERCURY [22]. Supramolecular analyses were made and the diagrams were prepared with the aid of PLATON [23]. Topological analyses were performed using TOPOS40 software [24]. 2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Complex 1 A mixture of AgNO3 (0.17g, 1.0mmol), H3Ssal (0.218g, 1.0mmol) and 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole (0.22g, 2mmol) in the water:methanol mixture (20: 10mL) was stirred at room temperature for a hour and then aqueous NH3 solution (% 25) was dropped into the mixture to get a clear solution.

The characterizations of the synthesized complexes were carried out by IR spectra, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction. In the IR spectra of the complexes, the bands between 3474 and 3155cm−1 are due to ν(O–H) and ν(N–H) stretching vibrations. Aromatic and aliphatic stretching vibrations of the complexes are observed between at 3049 and 2845cm−1. The –COOH and –SO3H vibrations observing around at 1680cm−1 of H3ssa were disappeared after conversion to complexes 1–4. This result showed that carboxyl and sulfonyl groups of H3ssa were full deprotonated. The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations corresponding to carboxylate groups of the complexes are observed in the range of 1576–1553cm−1 and in the range of 1444–1418cm−1, respectively. The characteristic asymmetric stretching vibrations of SO3 group are observed between at 1214 and 1016cm−1. The bands observed between 826 and 671cm−1 are due to symmetric ν s (SO3) stretching vibrations. 3.1.1 Description of crystal structures Details of data collection and crystal structure determinations are given in Table 1. Selected bond distances and angles, hydrogen-bond parameters for complexes 1–4 are given in Tables S1 and S2 and π⋯π interactions distances for complexes 1–3 are given in Table S3. 3.1.1.1 Structure of complex 1 The molecular structure of 1 with the atom labeling is shown in Fig. 1. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of a Ag(I) ion, one ssa ligand, one non-coordinated 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazolium ion and one aqua ligand. The Ag1 atom is coordinated by one sulfonate and two carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O2i and O4ii) of three different ssa ligands, one oxygen atom (O7) from aqua ligand and one Ag(I) ion (Ag1i) [(i) −x, −y, −z+2; (ii) −x, −y+1, −z+2]. The Ag–Ocarboxylate bond distances are 2.169(2) and 2.206(2)Å, respectively. The O4ii atom of ssa ligand is weakly coordinated to the Ag(I) ion [2.493(2)Å] and longer than those of the Ag–Ocarboxylate bonds. Two Ag(I) ions are bridged by two carboxylate groups using a μ-COO− coordination mode to form ligand-supported argentophilic Ag⋯Ag interactions and Ag1–Ag1i distance is 2.8611(4)Å. This argentophilic interaction is similar to those found in [Mg(H2O)6][Ag2(HL)2] (2.914Å) [11], [Sr2Ag4(HL)(H2O)14]·2H2O (2.840Å and 2.850Å) [11] and [Ag2L(H2O)] (2.780Å) [25]. The Ag(I) ions and ssa ligands are 1D coordination polymer running parallel to the [010] direction, with the Ag(I) ions having [Ag2(ssa)2] metalloligands ( Fig. 2). The Ag(I)⋯Ag(I) separation is 7.439Å. The 1D layer is extended into 2D networks by N–H⋯O and O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds and π⋯π interactions ( Fig. 3a and b). The intermolecular π⋯π interaction occurs between the benzene and imidazole rings of neighboring molecules. The distances between the ring centroids are 3.760(2)Å and 3.767(2)Å (Table S3). 3.1.1.2 Structure of complex 2 The asymmetric unit of 2 consists of two Ag(I) ions, one ssa ligand, two isonicotinamide ligands, one crystal water and one methanol molecules ( Fig. 4). The Ag(I) ions are of two coordination types. In the first of these coordination, the Ag1 atom is coordinated by one sulfonate and two carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O2i and O4ii) from three different ssa ligands [Ag1–O1=2.205(2)Å, Ag1–O2i=2.230(2)Å and Ag1–O4ii=2.507(3)Å], one oxygen atom (O7) from isonicotinamide ligand [Ag1–O7=2.515(3)Å] and one Ag(I) ion (Ag1i) [(i) 1−x, 1−y, 1−z; (ii) 2−x, 1−y, 1−z]. The Ag1 atoms are bridged by two carboxylate groups using a μ-COO− coordination mode. Ligand-supported argentophilic Ag···Ag interactions are observed in 2. The Ag1–Ag1i distance is 2.8644(5)Å that is similar to those found in [KAg(HL)(H2O)3] n (2.910Å) [26] and [NaAg(HL)(H2O)3] n (2.890Å) [26]. At the same time, Ag1 atoms are bridged by two ssa ligands. Thus, the Ag1 atoms have [Ag2(ssa)2] metalloligands, with the Ag1–Ag1ii separation of 8.850Å that is similar to those found in [Mg(H2O)6][Ag2(HL)2] (8.880Å) [11] and [Ag2L(H2O)] (8.222Å) [26]. The combination of [Ag2(Hssa)2] metalloligands produces 1D coordination polymer running parallel to the [100] direction ( Fig. 5a). In the second coordination, the Ag2 atom is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N3) from two different isonicotinamide ligands [Ag2–N1=2.167(3)Å and Ag2–N3=2.163(3)Å]. The Ag1 and Ag2 atoms are bridged by isonicotinamide ligand, with the Ag1–Ag2 separation of 9.445Å [27]. The 1D layer is extended into 2D frameworks by N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5b). Adjacent 2D frameworks are further joined by π⋯π interactions to form 3D supramolecular network. 3.1.1.3 Structure of complex 3 The X-ray single crystal study shows that complex 3 has 3D coordination polymer. The asymmetric unit of 3 consists of two Ag(I) ions, one ssa ligand, one and a half 2,5-dimethylpyrazine ligands and two crystal water molecules ( Fig. 6). The Ag(I) ions are of two coordination types. In the first of these coordination geometries, the Ag1 atom is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N3) from two different 2,5-dimethylpyrazine ligands [Ag1–N1=2.225(2)Å and Ag1–N3=2.270(2)Å] and one sulfonate oxygen atom (O1) from Hssa ligand [Ag1–O1=2.456(2)Å]. These Ag–N bond distances are comparable to the corresponding bonds lengths in literature [28]. Complex 3 has ligand supported argentophilic Ag⋯Ag interactions. The Ag(I) ions are bridged by two 2,5-dimethylpyrazine ligands to form a 1D polynuclear structure, with the Ag1–Ag1i and Ag1–Ag2ii separations of 7.308 and 7.437Å, respectively [28,29] [(i) 1−x, 1−y, 1−z; (ii) −x+1, −y+2, −z+2]. The Ag1–Ag2iii separation is 3.829Å [(iii) x−1, y, z]. In the second coordination, the Ag2 atom is coordinated by one sulfonate and two carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1v, O5iv and O6) from three different Hssa ligands [Ag2–O1v=2.456(2)Å, Ag2–O5iv=2.2298(18)Å and Ag2–O6=2.2483(19)Å], one nitrogen atom (N2ii) from 2,5-dimethylpyrazine ligand [Ag2–N2ii=2.448(2)Å] and one Ag(I) ion (Ag2iv) [(iv) −x+3, −y+2, −z+1; (v) x+1, y, z]. The Ag2 ions are bridged by Hssa ligand using [Ag2(Hssa)2] metalloligand and μ-COO− coordination mode, with the Ag2–Ag2iv and Ag2–Ag2iii separations of 3.0001(4) and 8.948Å, respectively. The Ag1–Ag2 separation is 10.827Å [25]. The Hssa ligand in the other complexes shows μ3-bridging coordination mode while Hssa ligand shows μ4-bridging coordination mode in 3. The combination of [Ag2(Hssa)2] metalloligands produces 1D coordination polymer running parallel to the [100] direction ( Fig. 7a). Similarly, the Ag(I) ions and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine ligands are 1D coordination polymer. Adjacent these coordination polymers are further joined by Hssa ligands, generating rectangular grid-like 2-D sheet, with grid dimensions of 11.766×13.877Å (defined by Ag⋯Ag distances) (Fig. 7b). This 2D coordination polymer and 1D coordination polymer of [Ag2(Hssa)2] metalloligands play a crucial role in the architecture of 3D coordination polymer. The channels contain guest water molecules ( Fig. 8c). Topological analysis result of complex 3 shows that the complex displays (3,3,6)-connected 3D network with 3,3,6T37 topology (Fig. 8). The intermolecular O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds and π⋯π interactions play a crucial role in the architecture of 3D network (Tables S2 and S3). 3.1.1.4 Structure of complex 4 The complex 4 is an 3D coordination polymer via ligand-unsupported argentophilic Ag⋯Ag interactions. The molecular structure of complex 4 with the atom labeling is shown in Fig. 9. The asymmetric unit of 4 consists of two Ag(I) ions, one Hssa ligand and one 1,8-diaminooctane ligand. The Ag1 atom is coordinated by one sulfonate and two carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O6i and O5ii) from three different Hssa ligands and two Ag(I) ions (Ag1iii and Ag2) while the Ag2 atom is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2iv) from two different 1,8-diaminooctane ligands and one Ag(I) ion (Ag1) [(i) −x+1, −y, −z+1; (ii) x−1, y, z; (iii) −x, −y, −z+1; (iv) x, −y+1/2, z+1/2]. The Ag–O bond distances range from 2.166(5) to 2.482(6)Å and the Ag–N bond distances are 2.082(7) and 2.090(11)Å, respectively. The Ag1 atoms have [Ag2(Hssa)2] metalloligands, like Fig. 7a [11,26]. The Ag1–Ag1iii distance is 2.8332(11)Å which is shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.44Å) [30]. These [Ag2(Hssa)2] metalloligands produce 1D coordination polymer running parallel to the [100] direction, with the Ag1–Ag1i separation of 7.722Å. Similarly, the Ag2 atoms and 1,8-diaminooctane ligands produce 1D coordination polymer running parallel to the [001] direction, with the Ag2–Ag2v separation of 13.283Å. Adjacent these 1D coordination polymers are further joined by ligand-unsupported argentophilic Ag1–Ag2 interactions to form a 3D coordination polymer, with the Ag1–Ag2 distance of 3.1313 (11)Å. At the same time, this 3D coordination polymer has rectangular grid-like 2D sheet, with grid dimensions of 6.678×26.383Å (defined by Ag⋯Ag distances) ( Fig. 10a). X-Ray diffraction analysis reveals that 4 is a 3D interpenetrating network (Fig. 10b). Topologically, complex 4 has a 2-fold interpenetrating 3D framework with the point symbol of {83}2{85.10} (Fig. 10c). The intermolecular C–H⋯π interaction, N–H⋯O and N–H⋯S hydrogen bonds (Table S2) play a crucial role in the architecture of the network. 3.2 Thermal, X-ray powder diffraction and photoluminescent properties Thermal stabilities and thermal behaviors of complexes 1–4 were studied by TG/DTG/DTA in a static air atmosphere in the temperature range 30–700°C (Figs. S1–S4). For 1, the initial loss occurring from 100 to 164°C is due to the elimination of one H2O molecule (found: 3.79%, calcd. 3.97%). After this stage, complex 1 is stable up to 200°C. The following weight losses of 72.54% in the temperature range of 200–627°C are assigned to decomposition of 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazolium and 5-sulfosalicylate ions (calcd. 72.23%). For 2, the initial weight loss occurring from 57 to 121°C is owing to the removal of one H2O and one methanol molecules (found: 5.65%, calcd. 6.88%). After this stage, complex 2 is stable up to 178°C. The following weight losses of 63.90% in the temperature range of 179–497°C are attributed to the release of ina and Hssa ligands (calcd. 63.37%). For 3, the first weight loss of 5.11% in the temperature range 31–94°C corresponds to removal of two noncoordinated water molecules (calcd. 5.71%). After this stage, complex 3 is stable up to 163°C. The second weight loss of 27.39% in the temperature range 164–264°C is due to the release of one and a half dmp ligands (calcd. 25.74%). On further heating, the final residual product is exothermally burned (found: 33.97%, calcd. 34.30%). For 4, complex is stable up to 204°C. The following weight losses of 61.27% in the temperature range of 205–604°C are attributed to the release of daoc and Hssa ligands (calcd. 62.56%). The final residual products of the complexes are possibly metallic silver (found: 23.30%, calcd. 23.83% for 1, found: 29.02%, calcd. 29.74% for 2, found: 33.24%, calcd. 34.28% for 3, found: 38.20%, calcd. 37.50% for 4). The PXRD patterns of the as-synthesized complexes are well-matched with simulated patterns from their single-crystal structures to check the phase purities of the complexes (Fig. S5). The photoluminescence of complexes 1–4 and free H3ssa ligand were measured in solid state under the same condition ( Fig. 11). As depicted in Fig. 11, the free H3ssa displays photoluminescent emission at 485 and 543nm accompanied by a shoulder pick at 578nm upon excitation at 380nm. The emission bands of free H3ssa are assigned to a π⁎→n, and π⁎→π transitions. Emission bands are observed at 485 and 540nm for 1, 485, 544 and 577nm for 2, 544 and 485 and 575nm for 3 and 484 and 538nm for 4 upon excitation at 380nm, respectively. Complexes 1, 3 and 4 display weak emissions compared to free ligand. The photoluminescence spectra of complexes 1–4 and free H3ssa ligand are similar. It is suggested that the photoluminescent properties of complexes 1–4 may be attributable to intraligand transition of coordinated Hssa ligand. Furthermore, the emission intensity of complex 1 is higher than that of free ligand. This situation may be assigned to the enhancement of the conformational rigidity of coordinated ligands [9]. 4 Conclusions In this study, four new coordination polymers were synthesized and characterized. X-ray crystal results showed that 1 and 2 were 1Dcoordination polymers while 3 and 4 were three-dimensional3D coordination polymers. Topological analyses of complexes 3 and 4 demonstrate that complex 3 has three dimensional (3D) 3,3,6-c net with 3,3,6T37 topology while complex 4 exhibits a 2-fold interpenetrating 3D framework with tfc topology. Photoluminescent properties of the complexes may be due to intraligand transition of coordinated Hssa ligand.
