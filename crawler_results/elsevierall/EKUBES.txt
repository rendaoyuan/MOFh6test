Graphical abstract The coordination polymer named {[Co(H2O)4(BPP)][Co(dipic)2]·H2O} n (dipic=2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate and BPP=1,3-bis(4-pyridil)propane) has been synthesized and structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. This compound is constituted of an one-dimensional polymeric cationic chain, in which the BPP ligands connect the octahedral Co(II) sites, and an anionic moiety formed by another octahedral Co(II) center and two dipic2− anions. Hydrogen bonding interactions lead to a 3D supramolecular array. The coordination polymer named {[Co(H2O)4(BPP)][Co(dipic)2]·H2O} n (dipic=2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate and BPP=1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane) has been synthesized by the diffusion method and characterized by thermal analysis, vibrational spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The compound is formed by an one-dimensional polymeric cationic chain, in which the BPP ligands connect the Co2 sites, and an anionic moiety formed by Co1 center and two dipic2− anions. Both crystallographic independent metal sites adopt a distorted octahedral geometry. Co2 center is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from BPP ligands and four oxygen atoms from aqua ligands, while Co1 center is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms from two dipic2− anions. The cationic and anionic moieties are connected through hydrogen bonding interactions leading to a 3D supramolecular array. Keywords 2,6-Pyridinedicarboxylate 1,3-Bis(4-pyridil)propane Co(II) coordination polymer 1 Introduction The current interest in the crystal engineering of a polymeric coordination networks stems from their potential applications as zeolite-like materials for molecular selection, ion exchange, and catalysis, as well as in the variety of architectures and topologies [1–10]. One of the basic strategies for crystal engineering utilizes metal–ligand bonding between transitions metals and organic ligands to create coordination polymers. In terms of molecular building blocks, coordination compounds, have advantages over organic compounds, because metals have a variety of coordination geometries and a wide range of physical properties. 2,6-Pyridinedicarboxylic acid (dipicolinic acid, H2dipic) has been frequently employed to prepare coordination polymers due to its versatile properties. It can coordinate the metal center through dianionic (dipic2−) [11–13], monoanionic (Hdipic−) [14,15] or neutral (H2dipic) forms, acting as a tridentate ligand and the carboxylate groups sometimes can bridge two metal atoms [16]. Based on these facts, a large number of divalent or trivalent transition metal and lanthanide(III) complexes of dipicolinic acid has been studied [17–20]. In especial, the literature documents many Co(II) or Co(III) complexes with dipicolinic acid such as [Co(H2dipic)(dipic)]·3H2O and [Co(dipic)(μ-dipic)Co(H2O)5]·2H2O [21] or K2[Co(dipic)2] and M[Co(dipic)2]·nH2O (M=Li+, NH 4 + ) [22,23] which contain the [Co(dipic)2]2− or [Co(dipic)2]− anions. It is also reported in the literature Co(II) compounds containing dipic2− anion along with pyridine nitrogen ligands as 4,4′-bipyridine giving rise to coordination polymers [24–26]. In addition, it is well known that the flexible nitrogen ligand 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (BPP) is used in the construction of coordination polymers that can show a wide range of interesting topologies as chains, ladders, grids and adamantoid networks. 1 For example, 3D diamond in Cu(bpy)2·PF6, 2D hexagonal grid in Cu(4,4′-bipy)Cl, 2D square grid in Cd(4,4′-bipy)2(NO3)2·2(C6H4Br2) and 1D ladder in Co(4,4′-bipy)1.5(NO3)2·xCH3CN, for more examples see Ref. [2]. 1 In this work, we report the synthesis and crystal structure of a coordination polymer of Co(II) containing the dipic2− anion and the nitrogen ligand BPP namely {[Co(BPP)(H2O)4][Co(dipic)2]·H2O} n . 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and equipments All synthetic work was performed in air and at room temperature. Co(NO3)2·6H2O , 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (H2dipic) and 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (BPP) were obtained either from Aldrich® or Fluka® and used as received. Elemental analysis for C, H and N were carried out on Perkin–Elmer 2400CHN analyzer. Infrared spectra were obtained from KBr pellets on a FT-IR Bomem MB 102 spectrometer in the frequency range 4000–400cm−1 with an average of 128 scans and 4cm−1 of spectral resolution. 2.2 Synthesis of {[Co(H2O)4(BPP)][Co(dipic)2]·H2O} n The studied compound was synthesized using a three layered-solution method in a tube of 1.5cm inner diameter and 18cm height. The bottom layer was 5mL of dimethylformamide containing 0.17mmol (34mg) of BPP nitrogen ligand. The middle layer was 7mL of dimethylformamide containing 0.17mmol (28mg) of H2dipic and the upper one was 5.0mL of an aqueous solution containing 0.17mmol (50mg) of Co(NO3)2·6H2O. The resulting solution was allowed to stand and after a few days, orange single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained. Yield: 26%. Anal. Calc. for Co2C27H30N4O13: C, 42.80; H, 4.07; N, 7.37. Found: C, 44.04; H, 4.11; N, 7.61%. 2.3 X-ray diffraction measurements Single crystal X-ray data were collected using a Bruker Kappa CCD diffractometer with Mo Kα (λ =0.71073Å) at room temperature. Data collection, reduction and cell refinement were performed by Collect [27], Evalccd [28] and Dirax [29] programs, respectively. The structures were solved and refined using Shelxl-97 [30]. Na empirical isotropic extinction parameter × was refined, according to the method described by Larson [31]. A multiscan absorption correction was applied [32]. The structures were drawn by Ortep-3 for windows [33] and Mercury [34] programs. Hydrogen atoms were located from Fourier difference maps. Anisotropic displacement parameters were used for all non-hydrogen atoms for the complexes. Table 1 summarizes the crystal data structure refinement parameters. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and general characterization From the reaction between Co(NO3)2·6H2O, dipicolinic acid and 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane nitrogen ligand in equimolar quantities, using the diffusion method, the compound {[Co(BPP)(H2O)4][Co(dipic)2]·H2O} n was obtained. Elemental analysis indicates the (2:2:1)/(Co2+:dipic2−:BPP) stoichiometric proportion that is not the same used in the synthetic procedure. The most relevant aspect for the IR spectrum of the studied compound is concerned with the values of asymmetric and symmetric stretching frequencies for COO− groups. In this class of compounds, the difference between ν asym(COO−) and ν sym(COO−) (Δν) in comparison to the corresponding values in ionic species is currently employed to determine a characteristic coordination mode of carboxylate group [35]. The infrared spectrum contains prominent ν asym(COO−) and ν sym(COO−) stretching bands around 1629 and 1390cm−1, respectively. The calculated value of Δν =239cm−1 is close to the value expected for a monodentate coordination mode of the carboxylate moiety [35]. A broad band is observed in the 3300–3500cm−1 region and may be assigned to the ν(OH) stretching vibration, indicating the presence of water molecules in the structure in accordance to the thermal analysis results. In addition, bands at 1609 and 1591cm−1 may be attributed to the pyridyl stretching mode ν(CC/CN) of dipic2− and BPP ligands, respectively. These bands are shifted to higher wavenumbers when compared to the free ligands, suggesting the coordination of the pyridyl nitrogen atom of both ligands toward the metal center. 3.2 Crystal structure of {[Co(H2O)4(BPP)][Co(dipic)2]·H2O} n The Ortep drawing of a structural fragment of {[Co(H2O)4(BPP)][Co(dipic)2]·H2O} n with atom numbering schemes is shown in Fig. 1 , while a selection of bond distances and angles for the compound are displayed in Table 2 . As can be seen, the molecular structure consists of anionic [Co(dipic)2]2− and cationic [Co(H2O)4(BPP)]2+ moieties. The anionic unit is formed by two dipic2− ligands, acting in a tridentate mode toward the Co1 ion, resulting in a distorted octahedral geometry for the metal center. Each anionic unit is accompanied by one cationic part [Co(H2O)4(BPP)]2+ and one water molecule. In the cationic part, the Co2 center adopts a slightly distorted octahedral environment, coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N2 and N2ii) from a BPP ligand and four oxygen atoms (O3, O4, O3iii and O4iii) from water molecules, where the CoN2O4 core assumes a trans arrangement. The BPP ligands adopt the TT conformation with distance between the nitrogen atoms of 10.059(4)Å and bridge the Co2 sites generating a cationic polymeric chain in the zigzag form (Fig. 2 ) with Co2⋯Co2 distance of 14.439Å. Observing Table 2, it can be noticed that Co1–O distances are longer than Co1–N and differently from Co1 site, it is noteworthy that Co2–O bond distances are shorter than Co2–N. The anionic unit has already been observed in other compounds described in the literature as (pnH2)[Co(dipic)2]·4H2O (pn=diaminepropane) [36]. In this case, similarly to the compound described in this work, the Co–O distances are longer than Co–N ones. As mentioned before, the literature describes Co(II) coordination polymers containing dipic2− anions and the rigid nitrogen ligand analog to BPP, 4,4′-bipyridine, namely [Co(PDC)(4,4′-bpy)](CH3OH) [24], [Co(pdc)(4,4′-bpy)]½MeOH [25] and [Co(C10H8N2)2(H2O)4](C7H3NO4)·4H2O [26] (pdc=C7H3NO4 =dipic2− and 4,4′-bpy=C10H8N2 =4,4′-bipyridine). It is interesting to note that in the first two, the dicarboxylate anion is coordinated to the metal center in a bridging mode contributing to the coordination polymer chain formation, while in the last one the dipic2− anion is free, acting as counter-ion. In these cases, the products were obtained under solvo/hydrothermal conditions. The compound described herein was synthesized by the diffusion method and the dipic2− anion does not take part in the polymeric chain as in the compounds [Co(PDC)(4,4′-bpy)](CH3OH) [24] and [Co(pdc)(4,4′-bpy)]½MeOH [25], however it is not completely free as in [Co(C10H8N2)2(H2O)4](C7H3NO4)·4H2O [26]. The literature also documents a Co(II) coordination polymer with BPP ligand and fumarate anion [37]. In this case, differently from the compound described herein, the cationic 1D polymeric chain {[Co(BPP)2(H2O)2]2+} n is formed by interconnecting ring structures containing two BPP units and two coordinated water molecules. The crystal packing of the studied compound evidences a 2D supramolecular structure, in which the cationic chains are connected to the anionic units through medium and weak hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atoms (O3 and O4) of coordinated water molecules and the oxygen atom (O6 and O2) of the carboxylate group (d(O3⋯O6)=2.680(3)Å and d(O4⋯O2)=3.518(3)Å) as shown in Fig. 3 . In addition, there are others hydrogen bonds, for example, between non-coordinated oxygen (O8) of the carboxylate groups and the coordinated water molecule (O4) (d(O4⋯O8)=2.674(3)Å) that extends the dimensionality to a 3D array (Fig. 4 ). Selected intermolecular hydrogen bonds parameters are listed in Table 3 . 4 Conclusions In this paper we have presented the synthesis and the structural characterization of a Co(II) coordination polymer, in which the metal centers are connected by BPP nitrogen ligands. The structure is formed by a polymeric cationic chain and an anionic unit. The Co(II) ions from the cationic unit are bridged by BPP ligands to form a one-dimensional zigzag chain. The 1D chains are linked to the anionic moieties by extensive hydrogen bonds involving dipic2− oxygen atoms and coordinated water molecules to form two-dimensional array. The system dimensionality is extended to a 3D supramolecular arrangement also through hydrogen bondings.
