A new strontium metal–organic framework, [Sr2(BTEC)(H2O)4]∙2H2O (1) (H4BTEC=benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid), has been successfully synthesized by mixing the starting reagents. The single-crystal structure analysis showed that compound 1 displayed three-dimensional structures containing inorganic motifs with two-dimensional layers pillar-connected through organic linkers and forming water-coordinated neutral framework. Further studies revealed that compound 1 was insoluble in water and that it emitted strong luminescence at approximately 437nm after dehydration. Graphical abstract A new strontium metal-organic framework was synthesized by mixing the starting.

Keywords Strontium complex Metal–organic framework Luminescent Water-insoluble Research in the field of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has grown exponentially in the last decade because of the numerous potential applications of MOFs [1–5]. The classical routes used to prepare MOFs are usually hydrothermal or solvothermal reactions carried out over a time span of several days. Recently, microwave-assisted hydrothermal/solvothermal reactions have proven to be able to reduce the reaction time to a few minutes [6–8]. In addition, sonochemical synthesis (under ultrasound) [9–12], mechanochemical reactions or liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) [13–15] make it possible to prepare MOFs in a convenient and rapid way. Benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid (H4BTEC), together with other benzenepolycarboxylic acids, is quite often used as a ligand in the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks. Recently, we reported a new magnesium complex with BTEC that can easily be prepared by directly mixing the initiating chemicals: the acid, the metal hydroxide, and water [16]. There is a desire to apply such environmentally friendly and efficient chemical processes to the synthesis of diverse chemical compounds constructed from metal-organic frameworks. In this paper, we report the direct-mixing assembly of a new Sr-MOF synthesized from H4BTEC and strontium hydroxide in the presence of water [17]. The crystal structure, dehydration and rehydration reactions, photoluminescence and solubility properties are also presented. Crystal structure analysis [18] showed that the structure of compound 1 was an extended 3D framework. The Sr(II) ion was nine-coordinated in the shape of a tricapped trigonal prism, SrO9, and it bound six oxygen atoms from the carboxylate groups belonging to four BTEC ligands and three oxygen atoms from the coordinated water molecules (Fig. 1 ) with typical Sr–O bond values from 2.582(2) to 2.765(3) Å (Table S1 in the Supplementary Information). The BTEC anion connected eight Sr(II) ions and adopted a symmetric μ 8 coordination mode with the center of symmetry in the middle of the benzene ring. Each SrO9 polyhedron shared its three edges with three other SrO9 polyhedra, forming an inorganic layer lying in the bc plane (Fig. S1). These layers contained hexagonal-shaped windows that were surrounded by six SrO9 polyhedra with a (6,3)-connection. The inorganic layers were pillared by the organic BTEC ligands, as shown in Fig. 2 . In this way, a 3D metal-organic framework of compound 1 was generated with channels running along the c-axis. Each channel has a cross section of approximately 6.4×6.0Å2. The structure performs a fraction of voids containing a number of residual density peaks, which may be attributed to disordered lattice water molecules but could not be satisfactorily modeled. The SQUEEZE calculation in the PLATON software was applied to subtract the water contribution. According to the crystallographic analysis, the elemental analytic data, the IR spectra, and the TGA analyses, the formula for compound 1 is [Sr2(BTEC)(H2O)4]∙2H2O. The solvent accessible volume (SAV) calculated by PLATON [19] without including all water molecules is 511.0Å3, which is 32.0% of the unit cell volume (only without lattice water molecules, 246.3Å3, 15.4%). A topological analysis revealed that compound 1 exhibited a binodal 6,8-connected sea net [20] with a Schläfli symbol of {34.412.54.68}{34.44.54.63}2, as determined by TOPOS [21]. In the structure, intermolecular O–H∙∙∙O hydrogen bonds were found between carboxylate oxygen atoms and coordinated water molecules (Table S2). According to the literature reports, the coordination number of strontium atom in strontium coordination polymers may vary from eight to ten (Table S3). The coordination of Sr in compound 1 is within this range. Regarding the relationship between the dimensionality and the solubility, experimental data show that 3D compounds are generally insoluble in water, while 1D chain compounds are soluble in water. This is in agreement with our observation that compound 1 is insoluble in water when examined by the treatment of immersing in water and characterized by powder XRD (Fig. 3 ). The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of compound 1 showed a sharp decrease in weight as the temperature was increased from 50 to 120°C, which was followed by more gradual weight loss up to 400°C (Fig. S5). The total weight loss of 17.54% observed below 400°C can be ascribed to the release of the lattice and coordinated water molecules (calcd. 17.46%) in compound 1. The dehydration transforms compound 1 into a new crystalline phase, compound 1a, with a proposed formula of “[Sr2(BTEC)]”, which was thermally stable up to approximately 500°C. Further heating caused an additional weight loss of 25.65% because of the decomposition of the organic part. The white residue produced after heating to 670°C was confirmed by XRD to be SrCO3 (Fig. S6). The rehydration from compound 1a to 1 by the immersion of 1a in water at room temperature was observed and revealed by powder XRD. Compound 1a rehydrated to compound 1 after one day (Fig. S7). (1a) S r 2 B T E C H 2 O 4 ⋅ 2 H 2 O 1 ⇌ H 2 O Δ “ S r 2 B T E C ” As shown in Fig. 4 , irradiation of complexes 1 and 1a with ultraviolet light (λ ex =317nm for compound 1 and 345nm for compound 1a) while they were in a solid state at room temperature resulted in a blue–violet visible light emission for compound 1 (λ max ~353nm) and a strong bluish emission for compound 1a (λ max ~437nm). In comparison with other BTEC-ligand related coordination polymers and the free H4BTEC ligand, which also shows emission bands at 360, 381, 455, and 470nm with shoulders at 494 and 523nm upon excitation at 320nm [6,22], the luminescent behavior of compound 1 can be assigned to BTEC ligand-centered π→π* or π→n orbital transitions, while the strong bluish emission of compound 1a may be assigned to an enhanced intraligand fluorescence. Thanks to the ~85nm redshift in the emission maxima between compounds 1 and 1a, compound 1 might find potential application as a luminescent sensor for changes in temperature around 75°C. In order to investigate the porous properties of the compounds, the nitrogen gas sorption of compound 1a were measured at 77K. The N2 isotherm show a moderate rise in the amount of adsorbed N2 at a low relative pressure, with the slope of the adsorption curve getting gradually higher at approximately P/P0 =0.5 (Fig. S8). These results indicate a Type II isotherm [23]. The isotherm steeply increases above 0.8 P/P 0, displaying a maximum adsorption of 16.0cm3 g-1, which indicates that most of the nitrogen was absorbed and that some mesopores were formed by the intergranular spaces of the powder particles. The BET surface area and Langmuir surface area were 9.3 and 16.3m2 g−1, respectively, as calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherm. The moderate surface area and gas storage capacity are likely related to a poor diffusion of these gaseous molecules because of their kinetic diameters (N2, 3.64Å) and indicate that the adsorption takes place at the external surface of the powder samples only. In conclusion, we have described the synthesis of a new strontium MOF of compound 1, which has inorganic secondary building units of 2D layers pillar-connected through organic ligands to form 3D framework and channel structure. Compound 1 is insoluble in water and has an unusual red shift of luminescence above 75°C. In addition, the dehydrated material is thermally stable up to approximately 500°C.
