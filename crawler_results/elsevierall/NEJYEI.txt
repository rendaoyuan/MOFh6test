Graphical abstract Two new compounds [Mn(dca)2(dmdpy)] (1) and [Co(dca)2(dmdpy)] (2) (dca=dicyanamide and dmdpy=5,5′-dimethyl-2,2′-dipyridine) were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, FTIR, thermal analysis and magnetic measurements. In compounds 1 and 2, dca ligands connect the metal sites giving rise to 1D and 2D coordination polymers, respectively. Weak antiferromagnetic interactions were observed between the metal centers in both compounds. Two new compounds [Mn(dca)2(dmdpy)] (1) and [Co(dca)2(dmdpy)] (2) (dca=dicyanamide and dmdpy=5,5′-dimethyl-2,2′-dipyridine) were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, FTIR, thermal analysis and magnetic measurements. In both compounds, the dmdpy ligand adopts a bidentate chelating coordination mode while dca anions act as bidentate μ 1,5 bridging ligand and the metal centers are involved in a distorted octahedral geometry. In compounds 1 and 2, dca ligands connect the metal sites giving rise to 1D and 2D coordination polymers, respectively. Weak antiferromagnetic interactions were observed between the metal centers in both compounds. Keywords Coordination polymers Crystal structure Dicyanamide 5,5′-Dimethyl-2,2′-dipyridine Magnetic properties 1 Introduction Molecular organic frameworks (MOF) are seen nowadays as potential functional materials with application in several areas such as nanomaterials, catalysis, magnetism, gas adsorption, luminescent, non-linear optics, and biological model [1]. Besides, the construction of these systems has fascinated chemists due to the possibility to control the dimensionality and physical properties through synthetic strategies [2]. Self-assembly of the metal ion with organic spacers and suitable bridging units is an efficient approach to prepare such coordination molecules. Pseudohalides like azide, thiocyanate, cyanate and carboxylates have been used extensively as bridging units to isolate these polymers [3]. In this context, polynitrile anions (Chart 1 ) have received noteworthy attention in the field of coordination chemistry and molecular materials. These organic anions are interesting due to their high electronic delocalization and ability to act as bridging ligand to several coordination sites since cyano groups are juxtaposed in such a way that they cannot all coordinate to the same metal ion [4]. Dicyanamide (dca), a larger pseudohalide molecular ion rod, is now under active consideration as a bridging ligand because of its versatile coordination motifs (Chart 2 ). Several research groups have reported a wide variety of coordination polymers containing transition metal ions, dca with a diversity of co-ligands [5–7]. Among these coligands, bipyridine and analogous are extensively applied because they are able to control the dimensionality leading to discrete or extended structures [8,9]. The most common binding mode of bipy ligands is the chelating fashion by virtue of the proximity of the pyridine rings, forming with the metal center a stable five-member ring. The ligand 5,5′-dimethyl-2,2′-dipyridine (dmdpy) acts as a chelator and usually gives rise to monomeric compounds [10,11]. Due to the variety of structural topologies which can be obtained, coordination compounds based on dca ligand have attracted attention in the field of molecular materials because some of them presented magnetic ordering [12]. Besides, modifications on molecular architecture by incorporation of co-ligands (terminal or bridging), counter-ions and crystallization solvents are an interesting strategy to tune the magnetic behavior of this kind of compounds [13,14]. Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structures and magnetic properties of two new compounds of Mn(II) and Co(II) both containing the ligand 5,5′-dimethyl-2,2′-dipyridine and the dicyanamide anion. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods Analytical grade solvents and reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. The elemental analyses (CHN) were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series II analyzer. Infrared spectra were recorded on a FT-IR Bomen MB102 spectrometer in the frequency range 4000–400cm−1 with an average of 128 scans and 4cm−1 of spectral resolution using KBr pellets. Fourier-transform Raman spectroscopy was carried out using a Bruker RFS 100 instrument equipped with an Nd3+/YAG laser operating at 1064nm in the near infrared and a CCD detector cooled with liquid nitrogen with an average of 1000 scans and 4cm−1 of spectral resolution. Thermal analysis (TG/DTA) for 1 were performed using a TA instruments SDT Q600 using nitrogen gas purge atmosphere at 50mLmin–1 and heating rate of 10°Cmin–1 in a range from 25 to 1000°C. For 2, this analysis was carried out in a Shimadzu TG-60 with a thermo balance with the heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 from room temperature to 900°C in a dynamic nitrogen atmosphere at a flow rate of 100mLmin−1. Single crystal X-ray data of both compounds were collected using a Oxford GEMINI A Ultra diffractometer with Mo Kα (λ =0.71073Å) radiation at room temperature (298K). Data collection, reduction and cell refinement were performed by crysalis red, Oxford diffraction Ltda – Version 1.171.32.38 [15] program. The structures were solved and refined using shelxs-97 and shelxl-97 packages [16]. An empirical isotropic extinction parameter x was refined, according to the method described by Larson [17]; a multiscan absorption correction was applied [18]. The structures were drawn by ortep-3 for windows [19] and mercury [20] programs. Details of data collection and structure refinement for compounds 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1 . Magnetic measurements were performed on a Cryogenic SX-600 SQUID magnetometer in a range of 2–290K with an applied field of 0.1T. The samples were placed in a gelatin capsule and data were corrected for the diamagnetism and sample holder. 2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 [Mn(dca)2(dmdpy)] n (1) A methanolic solution (5mL) of NaN(CN)2 (0.79mmol) was added dropwise to an aqueous solution of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (0.39mmol). Dmdpy (0.27mmol) dissolved in MeOH (5mL) was slowly added to the reaction mixture. Two days later colorless crystals were obtained and collected by filtration. Yield: 58%. Anal. Calc. for C16H12N8Mn: C, 51.8; H, 3.3; N, 30.2. Found: C, 51.6; H, 2.8; N, 27.6%. IR (KBr, cm−1) and Raman (1064, cm−1): ν as + ν s(CN) 2303, 2294; ν as(CN) 2243, 2236; ν s(CN) 2205, 2170, 2153; ν (CC/CN) 1604, 1577, 1503, 1473; ν as(C–N) 1381, 1375, 1358; ν s(C–N) 930, 935. 2.2.2 [Co(dca)2(dmdpy)] n (2) This compound was synthesized in the same way as compound 1 except for the use of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.39mmol). Two days later red crystals were obtained and collected by filtration Yield 35%. Anal. Calc. for C16H12N8Co: C, 51.2; H, 3.2; N, 29.9. Found: C, 51.1; H, 2.7; N, 27.8%. IR (KBr, cm−1) and Raman (1064, cm−1): ν as + ν s(CN) 2309, 2295; ν as(CN) 2250; ν s(CN) 2214, 2180, 2170; ν CC/CN 1604, 1503, 1571, 1480; ν as(C–N) 1363, 1319, 1379; ν s(C–N) 924, 928. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 General characterization IR and Raman spectra (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary material) exhibit dca stretching vibrations for 1 and 2 as strong absorptions in the region 2153–2214cm−1 and two medium to strong absorptions in the range of 2236–2250 and 2294–2310cm−1, which are attributed to ν s(CN), ν as(CN) and ν as + ν s(CN) modes, respectively. The shifts towards higher frequency values as compared to the free dca ligand (2170, 2232 and 2286cm−1) are presumably due to the bidentate bridging (μ 1,5) coordination mode of the pseudohalide [3,21–22]. Bands corresponding to ν as(C–N) and ν s(C–N) stretching frequencies are found in the ranges 1320–1390 and 920–935cm−1, respectively. The presence of bands in the region 1604–1470cm−1 is assigned to ν(CC/CN) of dmdpy ligand pyridyl rings. These bands were shifted to larger wavenumbers when compared to the free ligand (1590–1490cm−1) indicating the pyridyl coordination toward the metal centers. In order to examine thermal stabilities of 1 and 2, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA) were carried out in dynamic nitrogen atmosphere. TG/DTA curves (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary material) indicate that compounds 1 and 2 are stable up to 278 and 273°C, respectively. Afterwards, in both cases, the thermal decomposition of the complexes occurs gradually in several steps through endothermic and exothermic events. The high percentage residue (42.6%) at 900°C for compound 1 indicates the incomplete decomposition at this temperature. In the case of compound 2, the percentage residue (Exp., 14.9%, Calc., 15.6%) agrees with metallic cobalt. 3.2 Structures descriptions The crystal structure fragment of compound 1 is shown in Fig. 1 a. Each metal ion is coordinated by six nitrogen atoms from one dmdpy (N1 and N1 i ) and four different dca ligands (N2, N2 i , N4 ii and N4 iii ) forming a distorted octahedral environment. Bond distances of Mn–N1(2.295(2)Å), Mn–N2(2.198(3)Å) and Mn–N4 ii (2.224(3)Å) are typical for coordination compounds containing dca and dmdpy ligands [2,5–10] [symmetry codes: i(1− x, y, 1.5− z); ii(1− x, 1− y, 1− z) and iii(x, 1− y, 0.5+ z)]. Dmdpy ligand acts in a chelating coordination mode while dca ligands adopt the μ 1,5 bridging mode. Two dca ligands connect the metal centers forming loops, generating a 1D coordination polymeric chain along the crystallographic c axis. The Mn⋯Mn distance along the chain is 7.590(4) Å. In the crystal packing, intermolecular π–π interactions involving dmdpy ligand pyridyl rings, with centroid–centroid distance of 4.239(2)Å (Fig. 1b), play a key role to the supramolecular arrangement. A fragment of crystal structure of 2 is shown in Fig. 2 a. Each cobalt (II) center is coordinated to six nitrogen atoms from one dmdpy (N1 and N1 i ) and four dca ligands (N2, N2 i , N3 ii and N3 iii ) in a distorted octahedral geometry. A tetragonal distortion is evidenced by the bond distances values Co–N1 (2.142(2)Å), Co–N2 (2.114(2)Å) and Co-N3 (2.095(3)Å). The dmdpy ligand is coordinated to the metal site in a bidentate chelate mode, while the dca ligand acts in a bidentate μ 1,5 bridge fashion. Differently from compound 1, in this case the dca ligands connect the Co(II) sites along two directions giving rise to 2D undulated polymeric sheets (Fig. 2b). The Co⋯Co distance across the μ 1,5-dca bridges is 8.102(4)Å. Considering the metal sites as nodes and dca ligands as connectors, the undulated rhombic sheet is topologically described as (4,4) grids. In addition, short CH⋯π contacts between hydrogen atoms of dmdpy ligand methyl groups and adjacent pyridine rings with distance of 2.895(2)Å contributed to stabilize the crystal packing. 4 Magnetic properties The thermal dependence of the χ MT product for 1 is shown in Fig. 3 . The χ MT value at room temperature is 4.36cm3 mol−1 K, close to the calculated for magnetically isolated high-spin Mn(II) with g =2.00 (4.38cm3 mol−1 K). This value remains constant from 300 to 50K indicating a paramagnetic behavior in this temperature range. Upon cooling, χ MT value decreases to a minimum of 1.65cm3 mol−1 K at 1.8K due to antiferromagnetic interactions. The χ M −1 versus temperature can be fitted to the Curie–Weiss law (inset Fig. 3), leading to C =4.33emumol−1 and θ =−1.31K. Due to the large distance between Mn(II) ions (7.590(4)Å) in the crystal structure, we considered a mean field approximation in order to take into account the magnetic coupling constant value [23], according with Eq. (1): (1) χ M = N β 2 g 2 3 kT S ( S + 1 ) χ m MF = χ M 1 - zJ ′ χ M where zJ′ is the intermolecular magnetic coupling constant. The best fit was achived with zJ′=−0.65cm−1, g =2.02, indicating weak antiferromagnetic interactions between Mn(II) ions, as observed in similar compounds containing this ion and dca ligand [2,24]. The thermal dependence of the χ MT product for 2 is shown in Fig. 4 . The χ MT value at 290K is 3.34cm3 mol−1 K, which is large than that expected for spin-only (χ MT=1.87cm3 mol−1 K, S =3/2) indicating an important orbital contribution. Upon cooling, χ MT decreases to 2.03cm3 mol−1 K at 2.4K, which can be attributed to antiferromagnetic interactions and/or zero-field splitting (ZFS). The reciprocal susceptibility versus temperature can be fitted to the Curie–Weiss law (inset Fig. 4) leading to C =4.33emumol−1 and θ =−4.62K. The Weiss constant indicated overall antiferromagnetic interactions between adjacent Co(II) ions. The data are similar to those observed in other Co(II)–dca coordination polymers such as {[Co3(dca)2(nicotinate)4(H2O)8]2H2O} n [25]. In the present structure the Co⋯Co separation across the μ 1,5-dca bridges is 8.102(4)Å which, combined with the weak superexchange capability of the bridges, leads to the observed magnetic behavior. In order to reproduce the magnetic data, we used the magprop [26] program and the following Hamiltonian [27]. Similarly with compound 1, a mean field approximation was also included to the magnetic fit data to take into account the magnetic interactions. (2) H ˆ s = ℏ - 2 [ D ( S ˆ Z 2 - S ˆ 2 / 3 ) ] + ℏ - 1 μ B ( B → · g ¯ ¯ · S → ) where D is the axial ZFS parameter. ZFS arises through coupling of the ground state with excited states via spin–orbit coupling. Often, the effects of spin–orbit coupling occur in conjunction with the effects of a symmetry-lowering structural distortion, e.g. away from Oh symmetry. In an octahedral field, single ion Co(II) has a 4T1g ground state and we would expect magnetic behavior consistent with S =3/2, with a strong orbital contribution, at high temperatures [28]. When distortions from octahedral symmetry occur, the degeneracy of the 4T1g state is lifted. For example, if the cobalt(II) ion presents a compressed tetragonal distortion, the ground state becomes 4A2g with an excited state labeled 4Eg. The effect of spin–orbit coupling upon these levels gives rise to the Kramer’s doublets [27]. Therefore, as mentioned above, the decrease of χ MT upon cooling could be result of the depopulation of the higher-energy Kramer’s doublets of the cobalt(II) centers or intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions [22,24]. The best fit was achieved with g =2.88, D =95.37cm−1 and λ =−0.11 emu/mol. The intermolecular magnetic interaction zJ′ is related to λ and can be estimated by Eq. (3) [29]. (3) λ = 2 zJ ′ Ng 2 μ B 2 The calculated zJ′ value is −0.08cm−1, revealing weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the metal centers as observed in 1. This confirms the poor ability of the dca bridge to mediate magnetic interactions between the spin carriers when adopting the μ 1,5 bridging mode. Nevertheless, due to the larger metal ions distance in compound 2, the magnetic interactions are weaker than in 1, as expected. 5 Conclusion In this work, synthesis, characterization, crystal structure and magnetic properties of two new coordination polymers containing the 5,5′-dimethyl-2,2′-dipyridine ligand, dicyanamide anion and transition metals Mn (II) and Co (II) were reported. Compounds 1 and 2 are 1D and 2D coordination polymers, respectively. In both cases the dmdpy ligand is coordinated to the metal site in a bidentate chelating mode, while dca ligand acts in a bidentate μ 1,5 bridging mode. Weak antiferromagnetic interactions were observed between metal ions in both compounds.
