Two new transition metal coordination complexes, {[MnO(nda)](H2dmt)(H2O)} n (1), [Ag5(nda)2.5(dmt)] n (2), (H2nda=naphthalene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid, dmt=2,4-diamine-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine) have been hydrothermally synthesized by the reactions of H2nda and dmt with the homologous MnCl2·4H2O and AgNO3, respectively, and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectra, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

The interactions within each Mn(II)—Mn(II) pair of compound 1 are antiferromagnetic (g=2.07, J=−1.42(1)cm−1, zj′=−0.73(2) cm−1). In addition, compound 2 exhibits photoluminescent property at about 472nm (λ ex=394nm). Graphical abstract Two new transition metal coordination complexes 1–2 have been hydrothermally synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectra, elemental analysis thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Keywords Decanuclear silver units Topology Photoluminescent property Magnetic property 1 Introduction Recently, the design and construction of polynuclear transition metal coordination polymers have attracted a great deal of interest in the field of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering, not only due to their fascinating architectures and molecular topologies, but also for their potential applications in magnetism [1–3], optical properties [4,5], gas storage/ separation [6,7], catalysis [8], and so on. From the synthetic point of view, the smart selection of appropriate organic ligand is proved to be an effective way to synthesize the versatile transition metal coordination polymers. Among multitudinous organic ligands, aromatic carboxylic acids, particularly, which can coordinate to transition metal ions through different carboxylato-bridging modes (syn–syn, anti–anti, syn–anti), have been proven to be good candidates [9–12]. As well, this kind of ligands contains rigid configurations, which is difficult to change the spatial orientations between coordinating dentates during the coordinations, so it is easy to control to obtain the objective products. On the other hand, the auxiliary ligands with N-containing groups are introduced to the carboxylate systems for the construction of polymeric frameworks. The 2,4-diamine-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine (dmt) is a potentially versatile N-heterocyclic ligand which contains three coordinating N-atoms with 120 ° angles and may act as a three-connected node. The presence of −NH2 of dmt can also form hydrogen bonding interactions with either carboxyl-O atoms or nitrogen atoms or solvent molecules [13,14]. Moreover, the aromatic rings from dmt and aromatic carboxylic acid are capable to form π···π stacking interactions, which play an important role in the formation of packing structure. Although fascinating architectures and properties of transition metal coordination complexes with aromatic carboxylic acid/ N-containing ligands have been widely investigated, to the best of our knowledge, only limited compounds containing M-dmt have been documented to date [15,16]. Herein, based on the self-assembly of H2nda and dmt with different transition metal salts (MnCl2·4H2O or AgNO3), two new coordination polymers, {[MnO(nda)](H2dmt)(H2O)} n (1) and [Ag5(nda)2.5(dmt)2] n (2) (H2nda=naphthalene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid, dmt=2,4-diamine-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine), have been achieved. The compound 1 exhibits a 3D network consisting of 1D linear chains {MnO(CO2)2} n connected by the ligands nda2−, which features a four-connected uninodal diamond-like topology. For compound 2, it is firstly observed that the 3D network is built up by decanuclear silver units as secondary building units connected by the ligands dmt and nda2−, which exhibits a rare 2-nodal (3,8)-connected tfz-d topology ({43}2{46.618.84}). As far as we know, only one case tfz-d topology has been reported [17]. The magnetic measurement indicates the compound 1 is antiferromagnetic. In addition, compound 2 exhibits photoluminescence in the solid state at room temperature. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods All materials were commercially available and used as received. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet magna 750 FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets in the range of 400~4000cm–1. Elemental analyses were performed via Vario EL III Etro Elemental Analyzer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed under atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C/min using TGA/SDTA851e. Photoluminescence spectra were measured on a Hitachi Fluorescence spectrophotometer—F-7000. Magnetic measurements were carried out on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer, and diamagnetic corrections were estimated from Pascal's constants. 2.2 Syntheses of the complexes 2.2.1 Synthesis of {[MnO(nda)](H2dmt)(H2O)} n (1) H2nda (0.216g, 1mmol), dmt (0.125g, 1mmol) and MnCl2·4H2O (0.394g, 2mmol) in 10mL of H2O were stirred for 20min at room temperature, and the mixture was sealed in a 25mL Teflon-lined reactor, which was heated to 150°C for 3 days. After the autoclave had been cooled to room temperature over 6–7h, yellow strip crystals of 1 were obtained, and washed by H2O (Yield: 0.180g, 41.8% based on H2nda). Anal.

Data reduction and absorption correction were made with empirical methods. These structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 [18] and refined by full matrix least-squares methods using SHELXL-97 [19]. Anisotropic displacement parameters were refined for all non-hydrogen atoms; and all hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon and nitrogen atoms were added in the riding model while the aqueous hydrogen atoms of 1 were located from the difference Fourier maps. The crystal data and refinement details for two complexes are listed in Table 1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and IR spectroscopy The hydrothermal reaction of H2nda, dmt and MnCl2·4H2O (or AgNO3) at 1:1:2 ratio gave rise to the coordination polymer 1 (or 2). However, under the same conditions, we made an attempt to prepare other crystals by using other transition metal salts such as ZnCl2, CdCl2·2.5H2O or CuCl2·2H2O as the materials, but the only precipitates were obtained without further analyses. It is inferred that the conditions such as the pH value or reacting temperature might be not suitable for crystallization of other compounds. The IR spectra show the peaks at 3430cm−1 for 1 (3429cm−1 for 2) should be ascribed to –NH2 stretching vibrations, demonstrating the presence of dmt in two compounds. The asymmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylic groups are assigned to the 1557cm−1 for 1, 1663 and 1566cm−1 for 2, while the symmetric stretching vibrations at 1364cm−1 for 1, 1411 and 1365cm−1 for 2, respectively, which indicate the carboxylic groups coordinating to the metal atoms in bridging fashion [20]. 3.2 Crystal structure of complex 1 The complex 1 crystallizes in monoclinic group P2(1)/n, showing a 3D network by 1D linear chain {MnO(CO2)2} n connected by the ligand nda2−. As shown in Fig. 1, there exist two half Mn(II) ions: one nda2−, one μ2-O atom, one H2dmt cation and one free water molecule in the asymmetric unit of 1. The crystallographically independent Mn1 and Mn2 with both 1/2 site occupancies have elongated octahedral arrangement in [MnO6], of which four equatorial oxygen atoms from four different nda2−, and two axial oxygen from μ2-O atoms. A significant elongation around the two Mn(II) atoms occurs as a result of Jahn−Teller effect [21]. Two axial sites are separated from Mn(1) with 2.335(4) Å for Mn(1)−O(5) and Mn(1)−O(5A) (A: −x, 1−y, 1−z), longer than the equatorial Mn−O distances of 2.183(3) Å and 2.086Å. For Mn(2), the axial distances of Mn(2)−O(5) and Mn(2)−O(5B) (B: 1−x, 1−y, 1−z) are 2.316(4)Å, and the equatorial Mn−O distances are almost equal, which are 2.142(3)Å and 2.141(3)Å. The Mn−O bond lengths are in agreement with the distances reported earlier of this type of coordination environment [22–25]. The coordination angles, ranging from 84.46(15) to 95.54(15) (see Table S1), are indicative of a slightly distorted octahedral geometry (the ideal angle being 90°). As shown in Fig. 2, along a-axis, the adjacent Mn(II) atoms are connected to one-dimensional linear chain {MnO(CO2)2} n by two syn, syn−μ2:η1:η1-carboxylic oxygen atoms and one μ2-O atom. Each chain is connected to four other chains through μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1-nda2− ligands forming a 3D network, and some 1D channels are built up with aperture approximately 3×4Å with the cation H2dmt2+ located ( Fig. 3). The shortest intrachain and interchain Mn···Mn distances are 3.756Å, 10.881Å, respectively. From the view of topology ( Fig. 4), if the adjacent Mn1 and Mn2 atoms are treated as one four-connected node and the ligand nda2− is looked as linear linker, the overall structure is simplified as a uninodal four-connected 3D network, which is noted as diamond-like topology, slightly different from the reported tetrahedral nodes [26–28]. Here, each dmt obtains two hydrogen protons forming H2dmt2+ ligand to balance the charge of anionic network [MnO(nda)]2−. Though the cation H2dmt2+ do not participate in coordinating to the metal ion, a kind of strong π···π packing interaction is observed from triazine ring and naphthyl ring between the cation H2dmt2+ and nda2− with the vertical plane−plane distance of 3.38Å, the centroid−centroid distance of about 3.82Å, as well as H2dmt2+ and free H2O molecules are involved in the formation of several hydrogen bonding interactions (see Table S2), which play an important role in stabilizing the framework. Many compounds of H2nda-based Mn(II) coordination polymers have been discussed in the literature; however, most of them also contain coordinating N-donor auxiliary co-ligands, which might be rare by the use of only coordinating H2nda. In fact, the only example is the 3D compound [Mn(1,4-napdc)] n (1,4-ndpdcH2=naphthalene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid) [29], where a 1D chain of [Mn-μ-O2] n is also observed consisting of Mn(II) atoms and carboxylic oxygen atoms, which is different from that of 1 in that the 1D chain is built up of Mn(II) atoms, μ2-O atom and carboxylic groups. Another difference is the coordination mode of 1,4-nda2− in two compounds, which is μ6:η1:η1:η1:η1:η1:η1 mode in that case and μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 mode in 1. 3.3 Crystal structure of complex 2 When the manganese salt of 1 is replaced by silver salt, complex 2 is obtained. Complex 2 crystallizes in monoclinic C2/c and consists of decanuclear silver units connected to form the 3D network by the ligands dmt and nda2−. From Fig. 5, the asymmetric unit of 2 contains five Ag(I) ions, two and a half nda2−, one dmt. Ag1 and Ag5 atoms are bridged by two carboxylic groups from two nda2− ligands. Besides, Ag1 atom is coordinated to another oxygen atom from another nda2− ligand, while Ag5 is coordinated to one nitrogen atom from one dmt ligand, resulting in three-coordinated trigonal planar geometries, mean deviation from planarity of 0.0175Å and 0.0633Å, respectively. Ag2 and Ag3 atoms bear linear geometries by coordinated to one nitrogen atom from one dmt ligand and one oxygen atom from one nda2− ligand with N−Ag−O of about 154.5(2) ° and 172.5(2) °, respectively, and Ag4 forms a trigonal planar configuration by coordinated to three carboxyl oxygen atoms with mean deviation from planarity of about 0.0481Å. The Ag−O and Ag−N lengths ranging from 2.185(5) to 2.444(5) Å and 2.185(6) to 2.443(6) Å (see Table S1), respectively, are corresponding to this type of coordination environments [30,31]. Besides, several additional Ag−O weak interactions are observed to connect Ag1A, Ag2, Ag3B, Ag4 and Ag5A (A: 0.5−x, 0.5+y, 0.5−z; B: x, 1+y, z) atoms into Ag5 units with Ag−O distances ranging from 2.617 to 2.878Å, which further link its symmetric part through two syn,syn-μ2:η1:η1-carboxyl groups from two nda2− ligands between Ag4 and Ag4C (C: 1−x, y, 0.5−z) to construct Ag10 units ( Fig. 6) with 10 silver atoms almost locating at one plane. Strong Ag···Ag interactions are also found within Ag1A···Ag5A of 2.8616(10) Å and Ag4···Ag4C of 2.869Å, significantly shorter than the Van der Waals contact distance (3.44Å), and slightly shorter than the Ag···Ag contact distance in metallic silver (2.88Å), indicating the existence of argentophilicity can promote the aggregation of silver centers [32,33]. In addition, other Ag···Ag weak interactions show the distances of about 3.1217(9)−3.7397(9) Å. From Fig. 7a, down the c-axis direction, every decanuclear unit is connected to two other decanuclear units by three nda2− and additional connections to other four decanuclear units by six μ3-dmt ligands. Besides, it is observed that every decanuclear unit is further connected to two other decanuclear units by two nda2− ligands, respectively (Fig. 7c). From the view of topology, ignoring the roles of some nda2− ligands, each decanuclear unit may be treated as an 8-connected node, each dmt ligand being looked as three-connected node and nda2− ligand along the c-axis direction being the linker, the overall structure can be described as 2-nodal (3,8)-connected with the point symbol of {43}2{46.618.84}, which is a rare topology with tfz-d type (Fig. 7d), resembling that of C53H41.5CoN7O9.5Zn2 [17]. In this case, the infinitely trinuclear zinc secondary building units and [Co(4-cpdpm)3] (4-cpdpm)3=5-(4-carboxyl-phenyl)-4,6-dipyrrinato) metalloligands are both considered as hexagonal and trigonal nodes, which obtained the first (3,8)-connected tfz-d type. Additionally, in compound 2, four kinds of N−H···O hydrogen-bonding interactions (see Table S2) are observed between the amino-N atoms of dmt and the carboxylic-O atoms of nda2−, as well as a strong π···π packing interaction from triazine ring and naphthyl ring between dmt and nda2− with the vertical plane−plane distance of 3.38Å, the centroid−centroid distance of about 3.39Å, to increase the stability of the 3D network. To the best of knowledge, though several cases involving in decanuclear Ag(I) compound have been reported [34–37], all compounds exhibit only discrete clusters. For example, the decanuclear cluster [Ag10(dcapp)4]·2(OH)·12H2O (H2dcapp=2,6-dicarboxamido-2-pyridylpyridine) exhibits crownlike architecture, in which the silver atoms are arranged in two sides Ag4 tetrahedrons and a central Ag6 octahedron through Ag···Ag interactions [35]. However, the metal topology in 2 is different from that of the above compound, in that six silver atoms in the middle form almost planar configuration while two sides silver atoms show Ag4 trigonal planar geometries. The compound 2 reveals the first example that decanuclear silver units as secondary building units connected by the ligands dmt and nda2− to form 3D network, which firstly exhibits dimensionality change from 0D decanuclear dicrete molecules into 3D network. 3.4 Magnetic property of 1 The temperature dependence χ m T and χ m of 1 are shown in Fig. 8 (from 300K to 2K). The χ m T value is 4.43cm3 mol−1 K at 300K, close to that expected value 4.38cm3 mol−1 K of one magnetically isolated spin Mn(II) ions (S Mn=5/2, g=2.0). Upon cooling, the χ m T value steadily decreases to reach the value of 3.36cm3 mol−1 K at 50K, and then the χ m T value rapidly drops to 0.25cm3 mol−1 K at 2K upon further cooling, which show antiferromagnetic behavior between Mn(II) ions. The molar susceptibilities of 1 obey the Curie−Weiss law in the temperature 300–25K, giving C=4.76cm3 Kmol−1 and θ=−23.76K. Although compound 1 manifests 3D network consisting of 1D chain by nda2−, the adjacent chains are separated by the long ligand, and therefore interchain magnetic interactions may be assumed neglectable. Here, we try to use a 1D Mn(II) chain model to fit the magnetic data: [38–40] χ c h a i n = N g 2 β 2 S ( S + 1 ) 3 k T 1 + u 1 − u where u = coth [ J S ( S + 1 ) k T ] − [ k T J S ( S + 1 ) ] Here, N, β and k represent Avogadro's number, Bohr's magneton and Boltzmann's constant. In addition, taking into account other magnetic interactions between the 1D Mn(II) chains, the parameter zj′ was added as followed: χ m = χ c h a i n 1 − ( 2 z j ′ / N g 2 β 2 ) χ c h a i n The best fitting gave g=2.07, J=−1.42 (1)cm−1, zj′=−0.73 (2) cm−1 and R=3×10−4 (the agreement factor defined as ( R = ∑ [ ( χ m T ) c a l c d − ( χ m T ) o b s d ] 2 / ∑ [ ( χ m T ) o b s d ] 2 ), which suggests the weak antiferromagnetic coupling interaction between Mn(II) ions. Within the chain, there are two sets of magnetic exchange pathways: one consists of two syn, syn-μ2-carboxylate bridges, showing the antiferromagnetic interactions [41,42]. The other is made up of μ2-O bridges, in which the Mn−O−Mn angles are 107.7 °, slightly bigger than the literature reported that the antiferromagnetic interations are indicated by the Mn−O−Mn angles in the range of 103.5−104.0 ° [43]. The magnetization is 1.36Nβ at 5T, far smaller than the expected saturation value 5Nβ for one isolated Mn(II) (S=5/2, g=2) (Fig. S2). 3.5 Photoluminescent property of 2 Vast Ag(I) complexes are known to emit photoluminescence at low temperature [44], and only a few Ag(I) complexes display photoluminescence at room temperature [45,46]. The solid-state emission spectra of complex 2 at room temperature are shown (Fig. S6). It can be seen that the maximum of the emission band of 2 is located at 472nm (λ ex=394nm). The emission band of free dmt (λ em=390nm, λ ex=300nm) can be assigned to the π⁎−π transition [15], which is slightly stronger compared to that of π ⁎−n transition of the H2nda ligand (λ em=480nm, λ ex=300nm) [13]. The emission band of 2 originates from the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer bands (LMCT) [47–52], mixed with metal-centered (d−s/d−p) transitions [53–56]. The shifted emission and enhancement of photoluminescence of 2 is attributed to the ligand coordination to the metal center, which effectively increases the rigidity of the ligand and reduces the loss of energy by radiationless decay. 4 Conclusions Based on dmt, H2nda and different transition metal salts, we have synthesized and structurally characterized two novel coordination complexes. The feature of the compound 1 is that it exhibits a 3D network including 1D linear chain {MnO(CO2)2} n connected by the ligand nda2− with four-connected uninodal diamond-like topology. The compound 2 constructs the first 3D network by the decanuclear silver as secondary building units connected by the nda2− and dmt ligands with a rare 2-nodal (3,8)-connected tfz−d topology ({43}2{46.618.84}). Furthermore, compound 1 shows antiferromagnetic coupling between the neighboring Mn(II) ions and compound 2 displays solid-state fluorescent emissions at about 472nm (λ ex=394nm).
