Graphical abstract Through controlling pH value, solvent and added metal salts, six new zinc(II) and cobalt(II) coordination polymers containing the mixed ligands of chelidamic acid and 4,4′-bipyridyl with different structural features have been synthesized and characterized. Complexes 1–3 with 2D layer structures are obtained through controlling the different synthetic methods and pH values, while complexes 4–6 with 1D or discrete structures are metal-ions-and-solvent controlled assemblies. Through controlling the temperature, pH value, solvent and added metal salts, six new zinc(II) and cobalt(II) coordination polymers with different structural features, formulated as {[Zn2(HCAM)2(bipy)]·2H2O} n (1), {[Co3(CAM)2(bipy)2·(H2O)4]·16/3H2O} n (2), {[Co(HCAM)(bipy)]·19/6H2O} n (3), {4(H2O)·[Co(bipy)·(H2O)4](bipy)[Co(HCAM)2]} n (4), Zn2(HCAM)2(bipy)·(H2O)2 (5), and 2(H2O)·[Co2(HCAM)2(bipy)·(H2O)4] (6) (bipy=4,4′-bipyridyl), have been synthesized based on reaction between chelidamic acid (2,6-dicarboxy-4-hydroxypyridine, called as H3CAM) and 4,4′-bipyridyl. For 1 and 3, metal ions connected by the carboxylate O atoms to form a one-dimensional chain, which was then further linked by 4,4′-bipyridyl to form 2D coordination polymers. In 2, the Co(II) ions and chelated chelidamic acid ligands are interconnected by the hydroxyl oxygen atom to form a nearly linear chain and are further assembled into a 2D coordination polymer via the [Co(bipy)2·4H2O]2+ units. In 4, there exist a one-dimensional polymeric [Co(C10N2H8)·(H2O)4] n 2+ chain and a discrete [Co(HCAM)2]2− anion, and then further assemble into a 2D supramolecular network via H-bonds and π–π stacking interactions. And compounds 5 and 6 are isostructural and possess discrete structures. The solid-state photoluminescence, magnetic properties and IR of 1–6 have been investigated. Keywords Coordination polymer Crystal structure Optical property Magnetic property 1 Introduction A great deal of interest has been devoted to the design and syntheses of coordination polymers due to their novel topologies and the potential applications in catalysis, magnetism, gas storage, ion exchange, luminescence, and so on [1–3]. Till now, a large number of coordination polymers have been synthesized through using multifunctional organic ligands containing N- and/or O-donors [4–7]. As a multicarboxylate and N-heterocyclic ligand, chelidamic acid (2,6-dicarboxy-4-hydroxypyridine, hereafter called as H3CAM) has been of great attraction due to its various coordination modes (Scheme S1), which result indiversified polymeric frameworks and various application in many areas of science, such as coordinate chemistry, biochemistry, organic chemistry and medical chemistry [8–11]. Recently, many coordination polymers containing chelidamic acid have been reported to possess novel topologies and interesting properties [12–21]. However, it is still a big challenge to synthesize the desired coordination polymers with intriguing topologies and specific properties through controlling the reaction conditions, such as the solvent systems, pH value, molar ratio of reactants, and so on. In addition, up to now, there still lacks of report to study the structural diversity of coordination polymers with chelidamic acid triggered by the synergy of pH value, solvent or molar ratio of reactants [12–21]. As a bridging ligand, 4,4′-bipyridyl, is often used as linking units to construct coordination polymers with large solvent void or different topological structures, which results in the potential applications in catalysis, gas storage and ion exchange, and so on. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, 4,4′-bipyridyl is rarely used in the syntheses of the metal complexes with chelidamic acid [12–21]. Therefore, in order to investigate the influences of reaction conditions on the construction of coordination polymers and further obtain novel coordination polymers, we selected Zn(II) and Co(II) salts to react with the chelidamic acid and 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands. Consequently, six coordination polymers with different structural features and good properties have been synthesized. Herein, we report the syntheses, crystal structures and optical and magnetic properties of the six complexes 1–6, {[Zn2(HCAM)2(bipy)]·2H2O} n (1), {[Co3(CAM)2(bipy)2·(H2O)4]·16/3H2O} n (2), {[Co(HCAM)(bipy)]·19/3H2O} n (3), {4(H2O)·[Co(bipy)·(H2O)4]·(bipy)·[Co(HCAM)2]} n (4), Zn2(HCAM)2(bipy)·(H2O)2 (5), and 2(H2O)·[Co2(HCAM)2(bipy)·(H2O)4] (6) (bipy=4,4′-bipyridyl), respectively. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and measurements All the reagents were commercially purchased and used without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were carried out with a Perkin–Elmer 2400 II elemental analyzer. Photoluminescence analyses were performed on an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Magna 750 FT-IR spectrometer as KBr pellet in the range of 4000–400cm−1. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility and field dependence magnetization measurements of the title complexes on polycrystalline samples were performed on an MPMS-XL and PPMS 9T Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. All data were corrected for diamagnetism estimated from Pascal’s constants. The UV–Vis spectrum of 1–6 were recorded at the room temperature on a computer-controlled PE Lambda 900 UV–Vis spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere in the wavelength range 200–2000nm. A BaSO4 plate was used as a reference, on which the finely ground powder of the sample was coated. The absorption spectrum was calculated from reflection spectrum by the Kubelka–Munk function [22,23]: α/S =(1− R)2/2R, where α is the absorption coefficient, S is the scattering coefficient that is practically wavelength independent when the particle size is larger than 5m, and R is the reflectance. Thermo gravimetry-differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA) were performed on a Perkin–Elmer Diamond thermoanalyzer under a N2 atmosphere in the range of 20–700°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min. The powder XRD pattern was collected with a Rigaku DMAX 2500 diffractometer at 40kV and 100mA for Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5406Å) with a scan speed of 5°/min at room temperature. The simulated pattern was produced using the mercury program and single-crystal reflection data. Figure S1 gives the powder XRD pattern of 2, which corresponds well with the simulated one, conform the high purities of the prepared samples. 2.2 Syntheses 2.2.1 Synthesis of {[Zn2(HCAM)2(bipy)]·2H2O} n (1) A mixture of Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (24.77mg, 0.11mmol), 4,4′-bipyridyl (15.54mg, 0.1mmol), chelidamic acid (18.3mg, 0.10mmol), and 10mL distilled water was loaded into a 25-mL Teflon-lined autoclave, then the reaction solution was adjusted at pH5 by ammonia (5mol/L) and heated at 160°C for 3days, finally cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2.0°C/h.

All data were collected on Rigaku Mercury CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation (λ =0.71073Å) at 293K. The intensity data were all collected with ω scan technique and corrected for LP factors as well as for absorption by the multiscan method. The structures of 1–6 were all solved by direct methods and refined on F 2 with full-matrix least-squares techniques using Siemens Shelxtl™ version 5.1 package of crystallographic software [24]. The final refinements included anisotropic displacement parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms and a secondary extinction correction. For 1–6, the H atoms of coordinated water molecules (O(1W) and O(2W) in 2; O(2W) in 3; O(1W), O(2W), O(4W) and O(5W) in 4; O(1W) in 5; O(1W) and O(2W) in 6), the hydroxyl O atoms (O(5) in 1; O(3) in 2; O(1) in 3; O(5) and O(9) in 4; O(5) in 5; O(5) in 6) and discrete water molecules (O(1W) in 1; O(6W) in 4) were found in difference Fourier map, and refined with the distances restraint of 0.79–0.85Å for O–H bonds and in riding mode with U iso(H) values of 1.5U eq(O). And the H atoms of O(3W), O(4W) and O(5W) in 2, O(1W), O(3W) and O(4W) in 3, O(3W), O(7W), O(8W) and O(9W) in 4, and O(3W) in 6 were not included. Other H atoms were allowed to ride on their respective parent atoms with the distances restraint of 0.93Å for C–H bonds, and were included in the refinement with isotropic displacement parameters U iso(H)=1.2U eq (C). A summary of crystallographic data and structure analyses are listed in Table 1 , and selected bond distances and bonds angles are given in Table S1. 2.4 Computational procedures The crystallographic data of 1 determined by X-ray was used to calculate the electronic band structure. Calculation of the electronic band structure along with density of states (DOS) were carried out with density functional theory (DFT) using one of the three nonlocal gradient corrected exchange–correlation functionals (GGA–PBE) and performed with the castep code [25–27], in which a plane wave basis was used to set for the valence electrons and norm-conserving pseudopotential for the core electrons [28–30]. The number of plane waves included in the basis was determined by a cutoff energy E c of 700eV. Pseudoatomic calculations were performed for H-1s1, C-2s22p2, N-2s22p3, O-2s22p4, and Zn-3d104s2. The parameters used in the calculations and convergence criteria were set by the default values of the castep code [25–27]. The calculations of linear optical properties were also made in this work. castep calculated the real ε1(ω) and imaginary ε2(ω) parts of the dielectric function. The ε2(ω) can be thought of as detailing the real transitions between occupied and unoccupied electronic states. The real and imaginary parts were linked by a Kramers–Kronig transform [31]. This transform was used to obtain the real part ε1(ω) of the dielectric function. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Syntheses As shown in Scheme 1 , by using hydrothermal method, metal coordination polymers of 1 and 2 with different structural features have been obtained through changing pH values and the ratio of reactants. As well known, the large pH value in the reaction solution is helpful for the deprotonation of chelidamic acid, so the coordination modes of chelidamic acid in 1 will be different from those in 2 due to the different reaction conditions of them (with different pH values). Through changing synthetic method (using solution method), transition ions (Zn(II) and Co(II)) were then reacted with chelidamic acid and 4,4′-bipyridyl in the pH range of 5–6 at the room temperature, two metal complexes of 5 and 6 with discrete structures have been obtained, respectively. The discrete structures of 5 and 6 are mainly attributed to the acid solution during the synthetic process. In order to investigate the influences of solvent on the structures of metal complexes, based on the reaction conditions of 5 and 6, the different organic solvent, DMF (Dimethylformamide), methanol, ethanol, or THF (Tetrahydrofuran), were added in the above solution, respectively, but only the Co coordination polymers of 3 with novel 2D structure are obtained. Furthermore, In order to obtain novel heterometal–organic coordination polymers, Ln(III) and M′(II) ions (Ln=La, Gd, Er; M′=Co, Zn) are initially chosen to react with chelidamic acid and 4,4′-bipyridyl through solution method based on the reaction conditions of 5 and 6. In this case, only the homo-metal Co coordination polymer of 4 is obtained. Noteworthily, as for the reaction of chelidamic acid and 4,4′-bipyridyl with transition metal ions, the solution method is normally in favor of obtaining complexes with discrete or 1D structures, whereas the hydrothermal method is usually apt to obtaining complexes with multi-dimensional structures. These results indicate that the structures of the resulting metal complexes are sensitively affected by the synthetic methods, pH value, solvent, and metal ions, etc. 3.2 Description of crystal structures 3.2.1 Crystal structure of 1 As shown in Fig. 1 a, the structure of 1 contains one crystallographically independent Zn(II) ion, one coordinated chelidamic acid ligand, one half 4,4′-bipyridyl ligand, and one discrete water molecule. In 1, the Zn(II) ion is five-coordinated by two oxygen atoms and one nitrogen atom from one chelated chelidamic acid and one carboxylate oxygen atom from neighboring chelidamic acid, and one nitrogen atom from 4,4′-bipyridyl ligand to form a distorted trigonal bipyramid geometry. The Zn–O bond distances are in the range of 1.9468(17)–2.3171(17)Å and the Zn–N bond distances are 1.9939(19) and 2.0121(19)Å, respectively, which are in the normal range of those reported for the Zn(II) complexes with chelidamic acid [15,16,32,33]. The units, consisted of one Zn(II) ion and one chelated chelidamic acid, are connected by the carboxylate oxygen atom (O4) to form a zigzag chain along the b direction. These adjacent zigzag chains are further assembled to form a novel wavy 2D network through the 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands with an -ABAB- stacking mode in the bc plane (Fig. 1b). The as-formed 2D coordination network were finally linked together to form a 3D supramolecular structure through the hydrogen bonds between carboxylate oxygen atoms, hydroxyl and coordinated water molecules. 3.2.2 Crystal structure of 2 As shown in Fig. 2 a, the asymmetric unit of 2 contains three crystallographically independent Co(II) ions, two chelidamic acid ligands, two 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands (the 4,4′-bipyridyl ligand is disordered), four coordinated water molecules and five and one-third discrete water molecules (the disordered water molecules O3W, O4W and O5W with 1/3, 1/2 and 1/2 occupancies, respectively). The Co(1) atom is coordinated to a perfect octahedron by four oxygen atoms from four coordinated water molecules and two nitrogen atoms from 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands, while Co(2) is coordinated by one nitrogen atom and two oxygen atoms from one chelated chelidamic acid, two hydroxyl oxygen atoms from two neighboring chelidamic acid, and one nitrogen atom from 4,4′-bipyridyl ligand, respectively, to form a slightly distorted octahedral coordination sphere. The Co–O bond distances range from 1.981(3) to 2.244(4)Å and the Co–N bond distances are 2.060(4) to 2.165(5)Å, which all lie in the normal range of those reported Co(II) complexes with chelidamic acid [34–36]. In addition, the adjacent Co(2) atoms are connected by two chelated chelidamic acid ligand and the hydroxyl oxygen atoms (O5) with the Co⋯Co distances of 6.843(1) and 3.381(1)Å, respectively, whereas the adjacent Co(1) and Co(2) atoms are connected by bridging 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands with the Co⋯Co distance of 11.397(1)Å (Fig. 2b). Unlike to the zigzag chains in 1, the structure of 2 features that two Co(II) ions and two chelated chelidamic acid ligands are connected by the hydroxyl oxygen atom (O5) to form a nearly linear chain along the c direction (Fig. 2b). These linear chains are linked by the [Co(bipy)2·4H2O]2+ units, made up of one Co(II) ion, two 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands and four coordinated water molecules, to result in a novel 2D network in the ac plane (Fig. 2b), which are further bridged to form a 3D supramolecular framework through hydrogen bonds between water molecules and carboxylate O atoms (O(1W)⋯O(1)=2.732(4)Å and O(2W)⋯O(2)=2.679(4)Å). It is noted that the 2D network in 2 is the first example containing linear chains linked by discrete Co units among the metal complexes with chelidamic acid [9–21,34–36]. Noteworthily, as for the different structural features of 1 and 2, the reason is that the hydroxyl oxygen atom (O5) in 1 do not coordinate with Zn(II) ions but the hydroxyl oxygen atom (O5) in 2 coordinate with Co(II) ions due to the different pH values and molar ratio of reactants during the reaction process, which result in the chelidamic acid ligands and metal ions (Co2+ or Zn2+) have different coordination modes. 3.2.3 Crystal structure of 3 As shown in Fig. 3 a, the asymmetric unit of 3 contains one crystallographically independent Co(II) ion, one coordinated chelidamic acid, two halves of crystallographic unique 4,4′-bipyridyl, and three and one-sixth discrete water molecules. The Co(II) ion is coordinated to form a distorted octahedral geometry made up of one nitrogen atom and two oxygen atoms from one chelated chelidamic acid, one carboxylate oxygen atom from the neighbouring chelidamic acid, and two nitrogen atoms from 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands. The Co–O bond distances are in the range of 2.064(3)–2.210(3)Å and the Co–N bond distances are in the range of 2.058(3)–2.143(3)Å, which are all close to those of Co(II) complexes with chelidamic acid [34–36]. Furthermore, the adjacent Co(1) atoms are connected by the carboxyl group (COO–) and 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands with the Co⋯Co distances of 5.436(2) and 11.301(3)Å, respectively (Fig. 3b). Unlike to the zigzag chains in 1, the secondary building units in 3, consisted of one Co(II) ion and one chelated chelidamic acid, are connected by the carboxylate oxygen atom (O5) to form a linear chain along the b direction (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, the adjacent linear chains are further bridged by the 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands to form a novel wavy 2D network in the bc plane (Fig. 3b). The 2D coordination polymers are then assembled into a 3D supramolecular network through the hydrogen bond between hydroxyl and discrete water molecule (O(1)⋯O(1W)=2.595(5)Å). 3.2.4 Crystal structure of 4 As shown in Fig. 4 , the structure of 4 consists of four different kinds of crystallographically independent structural units. They contain a one-dimensional polymeric [Co(bdy)·4H2O] n 2+ chain made up of one Co(II) ion, one bridging 4,4′-bipyridyl ligand and four coordinated water molecules, a discrete [Co(HCAM)2]2− anion composed of one Co(II) ion and two chelated chelidamic acid ligands, a discrete 4,4′-bipyridyl molecule, as well as four discrete water molecules (three at whole occupancy and two at half occupancy). In 4, the Co(1) atom is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four coordinated water molecules and two nitrogen atoms from two bridging 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands to form a nearly perfect octahedron, while the Co(2) atom is coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms from two chelated chelidamic acid ligands to form a slightly distorted octahedron. Noteworthily, compound 4 is the first example that consists of discrete 4,4′-bipyridyl and bridging 4,4′-bipyridyl ligand among the complexes with chelidamic acid [9–21,32–36]. The Co–O bond distances are in the range of 2.090(2)–2.245(2)Å and the Co–N bond distances are in the range of 2.013(2)–2.116(2)Å, which are all close to those of Co(II) complexes reported previously [34–36]. As shown in Fig. S2, the adjacent Co(1) atoms are bridged by the 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands to form a linear chain along the a direction. In 4, the hydrogen bond interactions and π–π stacking interactions sever to assemble the 1D linear chains into 2D layer, and finally into a 3D supramolecular architecture ( Fig. S3). The π–π interactions between the aromatic rings of coordinated chelidamic acid and those of 4,4′-bipyridyl also contribute to the construction of the 3D supramolecular architecture with the distances of 3.834(5), 3.839(1) and 3.477(1)Å, and a dihedral angle of 10.754(96)° and 7.432(70)°, respectively (Figs. S4 and S5). 3.2.5 Crystal structures of 5 and 6 The structures of 5 and 6 are very similar. Thus, herein, we only present a brief analysis of the structure of 5. As shown in Fig. 5 , the asymmetric unit of of 5 contains one crystallographically independent Zn(II) ion, one chelated chlidamic acid ligand, a half 4,4′-bipyridyl ligand, and one coordinated water molecule. Similar to the coordination environment of Zn (II) ions in 1, the Zn(II) ion in 5 is also five-coordinated by two oxygen atoms and one nitrogen atom from one chelated chelidamic acid, one coordinated water molecule, and one nitrogen atom from 4,4′-bipyridyl ligand to form a distorted trigonal bipyramid geometry. Different from 5, the asymmetric unit of 6 contains one crystallographically independent Co(II) ion, one chelated chlidamic acid ligand, a half 4,4′-bipyridyl ligand, two coordinated water molecules, and one discrete water molecule. And the Co(II) ion in 6 is six-coordinated by two oxygen atoms and one nitrogen atom from one chelated chelidamic acid, two coordinated water molecules, and one nitrogen atom from 4,4′-bipyridyl ligand to form a distorted octahedron. The Zn–O bond distances are in the range of 2.001(2)–2.398(3)Å, and the Zn–N bond distances are 1.885(3) and 1.946(3)Å, which are comparable to those reported for the Zn(II) complexes with chelidamic acid [15,16,32,33]. Furthermore, the adjacent Zn(1) atoms are connected by and 4,4′-bipyridyl ligands with the Zn⋯Zn distances of 10.940(6)Å (In 6, the Co⋯Co distances of 11.220(3)Å), as shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Figs. S6–7, the 2D supramolecular network are formed in 5 through the H-bonds between the oxygen atoms of coordinated water molecules and the neighboring carboxylate group (O(1W)⋯O(1)=2.942(4)Å), while in 6 the lattice water molecule (O(5)⋯O(3W)=2.651(5)Å) are also involved in the formation of 2D supramolecular network. However, there are no π–π interactions in both structures of them. 3.3 Luminescent properties As shown in Fig. S8, complexes 1, 4 and 5 all show good luminescent features. The maximum emission wavelength of 1, 4 and 5 are 437, 439 and 510nm, respectively, excited with λ ex =350, 370 and 339nm, respectively. Compared with the maximum emission of the free chelidamic acid ligands [12], complexes 1, 4 and 5 result in red shifts of 12, 14 and 85nm, respectively. These results indicate that the emissions of 1 and 4 may be both attributed to the charge transition between the intraligand π–π∗ transitions of chelidamic acid ligands, while the emission of 5 is probably due to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). In addition, the photoluminescent properties of 2, 3 and 6 are also investigated, but the fluorescence of them were not observed in the wavelength range of 200–900nm. The reason of complexes 2, 3 and 6 not exhibiting detectable emission may be due to the existence of unpaired d electrons in the Co(II) ions. As for the distinct photoluminescence of 4, we need do more work on its mechanism. The good luminescent efficiencies indicate complexes 1, 4 and 5 may be good candidate for luminescent materials. 3.4 IR properties As shown in Fig. S9, the IR spectra of 1–6 show broad peaks in the range of 3600–3100cm−1 due to the existence of hydrogen bonding between water molecules. The ν(CO) band of chelidamic acid is found at 1730cm−1. This strong band disappears after coordination, which indicates coordination via carboxylic oxygen in 1–6. The IR attributions are consistent with the structural determinations of the series of compounds, in which the carboxylic oxygen atoms coordinate with the metal ions. 3.5 TGA analysis As shown in Fig. S10, the thermo gravimetric analyses (TGA) of 2, 3 and 6 were carried out to analyze their thermal stabilities. The TG curve (Fig. S10a) shows that complex 2 undergoes a three-step decomposition process in the range of 20–700°C. The first weight loss of 9.85% (calc. 9.47%) is completed at about 210°C, corresponding to loss of five and one-third discrete water molecules per formula unit. The second weight loss of 10.95% (calc. 9.05%) is found in the temperature range of 210–255°C, in accordance with the loss of four coordinated water molecules. From 255 to 540°C, the weight loss is 39.68% (calc. 41.47%), corresponding to the loss of two 4,4′-bipyridyl molecules. Complex 3 undergoes a two-step decomposition process ranged from 20 to 700°C, as shown in Fig. S10b. The first weight loss of 15.22% (calc. 12.97%) is completed at about 170°C, corresponding to loss of three and one-sixth discrete water molecules per formula unit. The second weight loss of 39.61% (calc. 37.69%) is found in the temperature range 170–495°C, in accordance with the loss of one 4,4′-bipyridyl molecule. As for 6, there exists a two-step decomposition process between 20 and 700°C, as shown in Fig. S10c. The first weight loss of 14.12% (calc. 14.51%) is completed at about 180°C, corresponding to loss of six water molecules (two discrete water molecules and four coordinated water molecules) per formula unit. The second weight loss of 28.80% (calc. 25.53%) is found in the temperature range 180–490°C, corresponding to the loss of one 4,4′-bipyridyl molecule. 3.6 Magnetic studies The temperature-dependent molar magnetic susceptibilities of 2, 3 and 6 were measured at 1000 Oe in the range 2–300 K on polycrystalline powder samples. As shown in Fig. S11, at room temperature, the χ mT values of 2, 3 and 6 are 7.57, 6.75 and 6.92cm3 mol−1 K, respectively, all of which are larger than the expected spin-only value of 3.75cm3 mol−1 K for two Co(II) ions with S =3/2 and g =2.00 [37,38], indicating the important orbital contribution arising from the high-spin octahedral Co(II) ions [39–43]. The plots of reciprocal molar magnetic susceptibilities of 2, 3 and 6 versus temperature all obey the Curie–Weiss law above 100K with a Curie constant of 8.05, 7.06 and 7.50cm3 mol−1 K and a Weiss constant of −7.75, −5.77 and −39.40 K, respectively (Fig. S12). The negative Weiss constants and the decrease of χ mT indicate a dominating depopulation of spin–orbital coupling and/or antiferromagnetic interaction between Co(II) ions in 2, 3 and 6. To further investigate the magnetic behavior of 2, 3 and 6, a noncritical scaling theory with the following simple phenomenological equation was used to fit the experimental data from 300 to 2K [44–46]: (1) χ m T = A exp ( - E 1 / kT ) + B exp ( - E 2 / kT ) Here, A+B equals the high-temperature Curie constant, and E1 and E2 denote the magnitude of the magnetic interactions. Generally, the first term in [Eq. (1)] represents a ferromagnetic contribution to the moment that is dominant at low temperatures, whereas the second term represents a high-temperature crystal-field effect or antiferromagnetic contribution that vanishes at 0 K. As for 2 and 3, the best fit gives A+B=7.84 and 6.85cm3 mol−1 K, respectively, both of which are consistent with those obtained from the Curie–Weiss law in the high-temperature range (C =8.05 and 7.06cm3 mol−1 K for 2 and 3, respectively), and E1/k = −0.62 and −0.28 K for the effect of spin–orbit coupling and site distortion for 2 and 3, respectively [37], as well as E2/k =9.12 and 8.49 K corresponding to spin coupling between Co(II) ions for 2 and 3, respectively. Those results show that distinct antiferromagnetic exchange mediated between Co(II) ions through μ2–O and O–C–O bridges in 2 and 3, respectively [47,48]. As for 6, the best fit gives A+B=7.81cm3 mol−1 K, which is consistent with that obtained from the Curie–Weiss law in the high-temperature range (C =7.50cm3 mol−1 K), and E1/k =85.7 K, consistent with those given in the literature for the effects of both spin–orbit coupling and site distortion [37], and E2/k =1.04 K corresponding to spin coupling between Co(II) ions. This result suggests paramagnetic interactions of discrete Co(II) ions in 6. In addition, the different magnetic properties and different magnatitude of antiferromagnetic interactions between Co(II) ions of 2, 3 and 6 are mainly derived from the different structures and the different distances of Co…Co among them. Normally, complex with longer distances of Co…Co would have weaker magnetic interactions. Therefore, the above analyses of magnetic properties of 2, 3 and 6 are well consistent with their crystal structures. 3.7 Band structure and density of state of 1 The calculated band structure of 1 along high symmetry points of the first Brillouin zone is plotted in Fig. S13. It is found that the top of valence bands (VBs) and the bottom of conduction bands (CBs) are both relatively flat. The highest energy (0.00eV) of VBs and the lowest energy (2.76eV) of CBs in 1 are both localized at the G point. According to the calculation, the solid-state complex 1 thus possesses a direct energy band gap of 2.76eV, which is close to its experimental values (3.56eV) shown in Fig. S14. The bands can be assigned according to total and partial densities of states (DOS), as plotted in Fig. S15. The VBs between energy −23.0 and −7.5eV are mostly formed by O-2s, C-2s and N-2s states, mixing with small O-2p, C-2p and N-2p states. And the VBs between energy −7.5eV and the Fermi level (0.0eV) are mainly contribution from O-2p and C-2p states mixing with a small amount of N-2p and Zn-3d states, while the CBs between 2.8 and 6.0eV are almost attributed to C-2p and O-2p states mixing with a small amount of N-2p states. In addition, it is found, from the dispersion of the calculated ε2(ω) spectra, that the calculated strongest absorption peak (also first absorption peak) localizes at about 4.10eV (303nm) with polycrystalline geometry (Fig. S16), which is close to the strongest photo-excitation at 350nm. Accordingly, the origin of the emission band may be mainly ascribed to intraligand charge transfer (ILCT), where the charges are transferred from the O-2p to C-2p states [11,12,49]. This analysis is also consistent with the above experimental result. 4 Conclusions In summary, six new zinc(II) and cobalt(II) coordination polymers with different structural features have been synthesized and structurally characterized in the present work. It was revealed that, according to the researches of their optical and magnetic properties, complexes 1, 4 and 5 exhibited good photoluminescent properties, and 2 and 3 displayed distinct antiferromagnetic exchange mediated between Co(II) ions through μ2–O and O–C–O bridges, respectively, while 6 manifested paramagnetic interactions of discrete Co(II) ions. The present study also showed that the constructions of the coordination polymers with different structural features and properties could be modulated through changing the synthetic conditions, such as synthetic methods, pH value, solvent, and metal ions.
