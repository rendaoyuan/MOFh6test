Compound 1 is a mononuclear structure, while 2 shows a ladder chain, suggesting that the pH value has a key impact on the structures. Compounds 3 and 4, with two types of 3D framework, were obtained when different secondary ligands were introduced into the system. The thermal stabilities and photoluminescence properties of 1–4 were also studied. Four polymeric frameworks, [Zn(cptpy)2(Hcptpy)2]·2H2O (1), [Zn(cptpy)Cl] n (2), [Zn4(cptpy)2(3-btc)2] n ·nH2O (3) and [Zn2(cptpy)(2-btc)] n (4), (Hcptpy=4′-(4-carboxyphenyl)-3,2′:6′,3″-terpyridine, H3(3-btc)=1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, H3(2-btc)=1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic acid) have been hydrothermally synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Compound 1 has a mononuclear structure, while 2 shows a one-dimensional ladder chain containing 28 member rings with (cptpy)− anions as bridges. For compounds 1 and 2, weak hydrogen bonding and intra- and/or inter-molecular π⋯π stacking interactions link the mononuclear or infinite chain structures into high-dimensional supramolecular structures. Compound 3 reveals a (4,4,4)-connected three-dimensional (3D) framework. Compound 4 is a three dimensional network structure comprised of new tetranuclear zinc clusters, exhibiting a {4·6·8}{42·6·83}{42·62·82}{43·62·85} topological structure. In addition, the thermal stabilities and photoluminescence properties of 1–4 were also studied. Keywords MOFs Zinc Crystal structures Luminescence Terpyrdine derivative 1 Introduction Exploration of the syntheses and properties of new metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has attracted more and more intense interest from chemists, not only because of their intriguing architectures, but also their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis, molecular magnetism, photoluminescence and molecular sorption [1–4]. However, it is known that a self-assembly process is greatly affected by factors such as the nature of the ligand, coordination geometry of the metal center, reaction medium, template, metal-to-ligand ratio, pH value and counter ion [5]. Therefore, further investigation is required to understand the assembly process. Presently, a rational synthetic strategy widely used in this area is linking metal ions with polydentate ligands as connectors [6]. Thus, a lot of fascinating metal–organic coordination polymers have been formed by employing either O-donor ligands, such as 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [7–10] and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate [11,12], or N-donor ligands, such as 4,4-bipyridine [13–16], 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine derivatives [17], as linkers and metal ions or metal clusters as nodes. Oligopyridine, with ring nitrogen atoms as multiple interaction sites, can form stable coordination compounds with various metal ions through coordination and hydrogen bonds. Moreover, carboxylic derivatives of oligopyridine are a fairly well-known type of ligand and have found widespread application in dye-sensitized photovoltaic cells [18]. To the best of our knowledge, 4′-(4-carboxyphenyl)-3,2′:6′,3″-terpyridine (Hcptpy, Scheme 1 ) has not been reported in the realm of coordination chemistry. However, its following structural features inspired our research interests: (i) it is a highly symmetric polydentate bifunctional ligand, the carboxyl group as a bridging or chelating group may be conductive for the formation of discrete polynuclear clusters and infinite building blocks by M–COO–M linkages, while the terpyridyl group can act as a bridging group which may give the ability to link these clusters to an intricate extended network. (ii) Hcptpy has a large π-conjugated structure that helps to form a good connection between the donor and acceptor, to fulfill electron transport. Additionally, introduction of other O-containing auxiliary ligands into a reaction system may not only form more complicated and interesting compounds, but might endow the final products with intriguing and useful properties. The relatively rigid structures of compounds based on the Hcptpy ligand with active photoluminescence properties are more available when d10 metals, such as ZnII or CdII, are used. Therefore, Hcptpy has attracted our interest as a good candidate for the construction of metal–organic architectures (see Scheme 2 ). In this work, four new ZnII structures, [Zn(cptpy)2(Hcptpy)2]·2H2O (1), [Zn(cptpy)Cl] n (2), [Zn4(cptpy)2(3-btc)2] n ·nH2O (3) and [Zn2(cptpy)(2-btc] n (4), have been synthesized. Their luminescence properties and thermal stabilities are studied as well. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods The Hcptpy ligand was prepared according to the literature, with some modifications [19]. All other chemicals were used as obtained from commercial sources without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were performed with an Elementar Vario EL Ш elemental analyzer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Varian Inova 400MHz apparatus and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as a reference. A Micro TOF-QII mass spectrometer with an electro-spray ionization (ESI) source (Bruker, Germany) was used. Infrared spectra were obtained from KBr pellets on a Bruker EQUINOX 55 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in the range 400–4000cm−1. Emission spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer in the solid state at room temperature. Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out with a Universal V2.6 DTA instrument under an N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10°C/min. 2.2 Synthesis of the ligand and the compounds 2.2.1 Synthesis of the Hcptpy ligand In a typical preparation, 3-acetylpyridine (1.21g, 10mmol) was added to a stirred solution of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (0.75g, 5mmol), KOH (0.8g, 14mmol) and NH3 . H2O (20mL) in 150mL ethanol. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature whilst open to air for 48h, after which the solution was made slightly acidic (pH 5) with the addition of HCl (aq., conc.). The resulting light yellow precipitate was filtered off, recrystallized with a mixture of ethanol and methanol, and dried in vacuo to give colorless crystals. Yield: 1.31g (74%). Anal.

Intensity data were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex II CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromatic Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.71073Å) at 296K. The structures were solved by direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F 2 with the shelx-97 program package [20,21]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and the hydrogen atoms of organic ligands were generated geometrically. The crystal data and structural refinement parameters for 1–4 are summarized in Table 1 and selected bond distances and bond angles are listed in Table S1 (Supporting information). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Syntheses and structural diversity The syntheses are summarized in Scheme 3 . Hydrothermal synthesis is a powerful method for the preparation of coordination polymers due to their low solubility in common solvents. Compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized by the reactions of ZnCl2 with Hcptpy and 1,10-phen ligands under the same hydrothermal reaction conditions, but with different pH values. Compound 1 is a mononuclear structure, while 2 shows a one-dimensional ladder chain. There are two Hcptpy ligands and two (cptpy)− anions in 1. The Hcptpy ligand is partly deprotonated when the pH of reaction mixture is 4, as in the preparation of 1, while Hcptpy is completely deprotonated in the synthesis of 2. Therefore, the different structures of 1 and 2 could be attributed to the influence of the pH values in the reaction systems. It is noteworthy that 1,10-phen does not appear in 1 or 2. A similar situation also occurred in other systems [22]. In order to study the effect of 1,10-phen, the reactions of the zinc salt with Hcptpy under the same hydrothermal conditions except in the absence of 1,10-phen were carried out. The products are faint yellow precipitates which were different from compounds 1 and 2. Furthermore, when we used other secondary ligands, such as 2,2′-bipyridine or 4,4′-bipyridine, instead of 1,10-phen, we obtained metal complexes with the second ligand. The aforementioned phenomena did not happen when using 1,10-phen as a second ligand. Therefore, we propose that the 1,10-phen ligand may play a significant role as a template in the formation of 1 and 2. In a comparison of the structures of 3 and 4, it is found that the coordination sizes of the auxiliary ligands have significant effects on the formation and structures of the resulting compounds. In order to examine the effect of the counter anion on the syntheses of compounds 3 and 4, the hydrothermal reactions were carried out under the same conditions with Zn(OAc)2·2H2O instead of ZnCl2. Consequently, compound 3 was obtained, while 4 demonstrated another structure, which reveals that the counter anion has a certain influence on the syntheses of the compounds. Based on the aforementioned facts, reaction conditions such as pH value, the sizes of the auxiliary ligands and the template exert a synergic effect on the formation of Hcptpy coordination compounds. 3.2 Crystal structures of compounds 1–4 3.2.1 [Zn(cptpy)2(Hcptpy)2]·2H2O (1) X-ray crystallography reveals that 1 has a mononuclear structure. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains half ZnII atom, one (cptpy)− anion, one Hcptpy ligand and one lattice water molecule. As shown in Fig. 1 a, each Zn1 atom is located in a distorted octahedral coordination sphere formed by two nitrogen atoms (N4, N4A) from two Hcptpy ligands and four oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O1A, O2A) from two (cptpy)− anions. The N4, N4A, O1 and O1A atoms comprise the equatorial plane, whilst O2 and O2A atoms occupy the axial positions [O2–Zn1–O2A=151.3(1)°]. The Zn1–O bond lengths fall in the range 2.161(2)–2.219(2)Å, which are similar to those found in other ZnII carboxylate coordination polymers [23]. The Zn1–N bond length is 2.073(3)Å, which is a typical value for zinc pyridyl coordination compounds [24]. In 1, half of the Hcptpy ligands are deprotonated to form (cptpy)− anions. Each (cptpy)− anion acts as a bidentate-chelating ligand with the pyridyl nitrogen atoms remaining uncoordinated. The three pyridyl rings from tpy domain are nearly coplanar; the benzene ring rotates by the small angle of 7.62° relative to the central pyridyl ring of the tpy domain, indicating the four rings are nearly coplanar. Similar to the (cptpy)− anion, each Hcptpy ligand acts as a monodentate ligand, with the carboxyl group remaining uncoordinated. The three pyridyl rings from the tpy domain are not coplanar, with the angles between the terminal and central pyridyl rings being 16.24° (N4) and 5.18° (N6), respectively. The benzene ring is twisted with respect to the central pyridyl (N5), with a dihedral angle of 22.97°, suggesting that the four aromatic rings of the Hcptpy ligand are non-planar. Two Hcptpy ligands and two (cptpy)− anions adopting monodentate (mode I, Scheme 4 ) and bidentate-chelating modes (mode II), respectively, coordinate to one ZnII center to form a mononuclear structure. The mononuclear structures are further linked to generate a zigzag chain through hydrogen bonding interactions between the carboxyl group of a Hcptpy ligand and a lattice water molecule [O3–H3⋯O5i, 2.569(4)Å, 172.8°, symmetry code (i): (x, y −1, z)], and between a lattice water molecule and carboxylate and pyridyl groups of (cptpy)− anions [O5–H5B⋯O1ii, 2.772(3)Å, 159(5)°, symmetry code (ii): (−x +1, −y +1, −z +1); O5–H5A⋯N3iii, 2.799(4)Å, 174(5)°, symmetry code (iii): (−x +1/2, y +1, −z +1/2)] (Fig. S2). Additionally, there are two kinds of weak intermolecular π–π stacking interactions (Fig. S3). One kind of π–π stacking interaction exist between the central N2 pyridyl and terminal N6 pyridyl rings, with a N2–N6 a ring distance of 3.572Å, centroid to centroid, and the centriod to face distance is 3.405Å. Another centroid–centroid distance is 3.471Å, with a 22.6° vertical displacement angle. Finally, a 3D supramolecular structure is formed through these weak interactions (Fig. 1b). Thus, the hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions play an important role in the formation of the supramolecular structure. 3.2.2 [Zn(cptpy)Cl] n (2) X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis reveals that compound 2 is a ribbon polymeric coordination chain. The asymmetric unit of 2 contains half ZnII ion, half (cptpy)− anion and half Cl− anion. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the Zn1 atom is surrounded by two nitrogen atoms (N1, N1A), two oxygen atoms (O1A, O1B) from two different (cptpy)− anions and one terminal chlorine atom. The coordination polyhedron around Zn1 atom is a distorted square-pyramid, with the four atoms N1, N1A, O1A and O1B in the basal plane and the Cl1 atom in the apical position [25]. The Zn1–O and Zn1–N bond lengths are 2.235(5) and 2.084(3)Å, respectively. The Zn1–Cl1 distance is 2.2419(19)Å, which is slightly longer than analogous bond distances reported in the literature [26]. Each (cptpy)− ligand, adopting the same coordination mode of μ3-η1:η1:η2 (mode III), connects three ZnII ions to form a ribbon chain which contain a pore with the size of 12.304×11.330Å, based on the distances of Zn1⋯Zn1 and C6⋯C6. Finally, the these chains are packed into a supramolecular layer via π–π stacking interactions between the two terminal pyridyl rings of the (cptpy)− anions from adjacent parallel chains (3.638Å centroid-to-centroid distance and 20.5° vertical displacement angle) (Figs. S4 and S5) [27]. In the solid state, the chloride atom is involved in inter-chain C–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonding interactions, with C⋯Cl separations in the range 3.673–3.695Å [28], which contribute to the stability of the supramolecular structure of 2 (Fig. 2b). 3.2.3 [Zn4(cptpy)2(3-btc)2] n ·nH2O (3) X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that compound 3 is a three-dimensional framework with interconnecting cavities containing water molecules. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the asymmetric unit of 3 contains four crystallographically independent ZnII ions, two (cptpy)− anions, two 3-btc3− anions and one lattice water molecule. The Zn1 atom is surrounded by two oxygen atoms (O14, O16A) from two bridging 3-btc3− anions, N1 and O4A atoms (Zn1–N1, 2.059(3) Å) from two (cptpy)− anions. The Zn1–O distances fall in the range 1.942(3)–2.000(3)Å, which are similar to those found in other Zn carboxylate coordination polymers [29]. The coordination polyhedron around the Zn1 ion is a distorted tetrahedron. The coordination geometry of Zn2 and Zn4 are similar to that of Zn1, except for slight differences in bond lengths and angles. The Zn–N and Zn–O bond distances are in the range 2.003(3)–2.053(3) and 1.903(3)–1.960(3)Å, respectively, which are comparable to other reported ZnII compounds [30]. Compared to the Zn1 atom, the Zn3 atom is surrounded by three oxygen atoms (O7, O8, O9A) from two bridging-chelating 3-btc3− anions, O3 and N3A atoms from two (cptpy)− anions. The coordination geometry of Zn3 centre can be described as a slightly distorted trigonal bipyramid, with the three atoms O3, O8 and N3A in the equatorial plane and two oxygen atoms, O9A and O7, in the axial positions [O9A–Zn3–O7=160.6(1)°]. The four aromatic rings of the (cptpy)− anion are non-planar. The benzene ring is twisted with respect to the central pyridyl ring (N2 pyridyl) with a dihedral angle of 21.55°; each outer pyridyl group (N1 pyridyl) is twisted with respect to the central one with a dihedral angle of 21.77°, and the dihedral angle between the central and the other outer pyridyl ring (N3 pyridyl) is 13.20°. In 3, the two 3-btc3− anions take different coordination modes. One 3-btc3− anion adopts a μ4-η1:η1:η1:η2 mode, linking the Zn2 and Zn3 atoms, and forming a kind of chain. Similarly, the other 3-btc3− anion adopts a μ4-η1:η1:η1:η1 mode, linking the Zn4 and Zn1 centers to form another kind of chain (Fig. S6). It is noteworthy that there are no further connections between the different chains. Three (cptpy)− anions adopting the μ4-η1:η1:η1:η1-bridging coordination mode IV (Scheme 4) connect to four different ZnII ions to form a layer which contains a 36-membered [Zn4O4N4C25] ring. A peculiar structural feature is that two layers with different extending directions are further linked by two types of chains to form a 3D network (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, two (cptpy)− anions, two 3-btc3− anions and four different ZnII ions connected end to end to form a 42-membered (Zn4O6N2C30) ring which produces a grid pore with a size of 16.783×16.092Å, based on the distances of Zn2⋯Zn4 and Zn3⋯Zn1, in the 3D open framework (Fig. 3c). To reduce the multidimensional structure to simple node and connection nets, the all Zn atoms, (cptpy)− ligands and 3-btc3− anions can be regarded as 4-connected nodes. By analysis, compound 3 has a {4·85}2{42·84}{86} topology (Fig. 3d). 3.2.4 [Zn2(cptpy)(2-btc)] n (4) Single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed that 4 is a 3D metal–organic framework based on tetranuclear ZnII cluster units. The asymmetric unit of 4 contains two ZnII ions, one (cptpy)− anion and one 2-btc3− anion (Fig. 4 a). Zn1 is surrounded by one nitrogen atom (N1) from a (cptpy)− anion [Zn1–N1=2.040(3)Å] and three oxygen atoms (O3, O6A, O8A) from two 2-btc3− anions. The Zn1–O bond lengths are in the range 1.900(3)–2.013(3) Å. The coordination geometry of the Zn1 center can be described as a distorted tetrahedron. Similarly, the Zn2 atom is also four-coordinated, to N3A and O1A from the (cptpy)− anion [Zn2–N3A=2.058(3)Å, Zn2–O1A=1.974(3)Å] and two oxygen atoms (O4 and O5A) from two 2-btc3− anions [Zn2–O4=1.982(3)Å, Zn2–O5A=1.981(3)Å] to form a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Obviously, the three pyridyl rings from the tpy domain are not coplanar, the torsion angles between the terminal and central pyridyl rings (N2) are 14.61° (N1 pyridyl ring) and 5.48° (N3 pyridyl ring). The pendant benzene ring is rotated by 36.05° relative to the central pyridyl ring. Notably, each (cptpy)− anion, which adopts a μ3-η1:η1:η1 coordination mode (mode V), connects two Zn2 and one Zn1 atoms, while the 2-btc3− anion, acting as a pentadentate ligand, links two Zn2 and three Zn1 atoms. Based on these connection modes, two Zn2 centers are bridged by four carboxylate groups of two 2-btc3− anions to form a {Zn2O4C8} unit, while two Zn1 centers are connected to the {Zn2O4C8} unit by another two oxygen atoms of the same two carboxylate groups to form a [Zn4(2-btc)4] unit. Thus, such subunits join each other to construct a chain of [Zn4(2-btc)4] n . In 4, the tetranuclear ZnII subunits are further interconnected via two nitrogen atoms of tridentate-bridging (cptpy)− anions to generate a layer (Fig. S7). Finally, these layers are linked by carboxylate groups of (cptpy)− and 2-btc3− anions to form ultimately a 3D network (Fig. 4b). It is worth noting that the 3D framework contains three kinds of channels, namely A, B and C, along the b axis, which include a 18-membered ring (Zn2O4C12), a 28-membered ring (Zn4O4N6C14) and a 36-membered ring (Zn4O4N6C22), respectively (Fig. 4c). In these rings, the largest is formed by two (cptpy)− and two 2-btc3− anions connected end to end (Zn4O4N6C22), which produced a grid pore with a size of 13.657×13.811Å. From a topological view, the Zn1 and Zn2 atoms can be regarded as 4-connected nodes, with the (cptpy)− and 2-btc3− anions acting as 3-connecting and 5-connecting nodes. Therefore, the whole structure can thus be represented as a {4·6·8}{42·6·83}{42·62·82}{43·62·85} network topology (Fig. 4d). 3.3 IR spectroscopy In the IR spectrum of Hcptpy, the characteristic bands which appear at 3445 and 1715cm−1 can be attributed to O–H and CO stretching vibrations. The bands at 1631 and 1494cm−1 can be attributed to the typical CC and CN stretching vibrations of pyridyl and benzene groups. The band at 1401cm−1 is due to the ring deformation mode of C–C vibrations, and the peak at 769cm−1 is assigned to the out-of-ring bend of the C–H stretching vibrations of pyridyl groups [31]. The IR spectra of 1–4 also exhibit characteristic bands for (cptpy)− at about 1600 (ν(CC)), 1460 (ν(CN)) and 1400cm−1 (C–C ring deformation mode). The peak at about 770cm−1 is assigned to the out-of-ring bend of C–H stretching vibrations of the aromatic rings, which means the para-position of the benzene ring is substituted. The absence of any strong bands at around 1700cm−1 for 2, 3 and 4 indicate that the carboxyl groups of the organic-acid and Hcptpy ligand are completely deprotonated [32]. The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the COO− groups are at 1550–1599 and 1470–1392cm−1, respectively. The difference between ν as(COO) and ν s(COO) (Δ<200cm−1) of compounds 1 and 2 indicates the carboxylate groups coordinate to the ZnII ions in a bidentate-chelating coordination mode. In contrast, the separation between the ν as(COO) and ν s(COO) bands in 4 is more than 200cm−1, confirming a mondentate bridging mode of the carboxylate groups in 4 [33]. These results are in good agreement with those of the X-ray structural analyses. 3.4 Thermogravimetric analyses To study the thermal stabilities of these compounds, thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) of compounds 1–4 were performed (Fig. S8, Supporting Information). Compound 1 first lost its uncoordinated water molecules below 130°C, the weight loss of 2.1% was consistent with that calculated (2.3%). The framework is stable up to 420°C, after which temperature the framework begins to collapse. The remaining residue is 5.48%, corresponding to the formation of ZnO (calcd 5.35%). For compound 2, weight loss in stages was not observed since the compound does not contain any solvent molecules. The framework started to collapse, accompanied by the decomposition of the organic components, at 410°C and ended at 800°C, leading to the formation of ZnO as a residue (obsd 17.10%, calcd 17.87%). The TGA curve of 3 shows a continuous weight loss of 1.30% in the temperature range 30–120°C, which is attributed to the loss of a lattice water molecule (calcd 1.29%). The network of this compound started to decompose when the temperature was higher than 315°C. The remaining weight corresponds to the formation of ZnO (obsd 18.52%, calcd. 20.27%). For compound 4, the framework is stable up to 300°C, when the framework begins to collapse. The remaining weight of 22.67% corresponds to ZnO (calcd. 23.40%). 3.5 Luminescent properties Inorganic–organic hybrid coordination compounds, especially with d10 metal centers, have been investigated for their fluorescent properties owing to their potential application as luminescent materials [34]. The photoluminescent properties of Hcptpy and compounds 1–4 were investigated at room temperature. Unfortunately, compound 2 exhibits only a very weak emission. The emission spectra of compounds 1, 3, 4 and Hcptpy are depicted in Fig. 5 . The ligand Hcptpy exhibits one emission band at 403nm upon excitation at 290nm. The emission peak at 407nm (λ ex =300nm) in 1 shows a slightly red shift relative to that of free Hcptpy, which may be assigned to the π→π∗ intraligand fluorescence emission of the Hcptpy ligand [35]. The maximum emission spectra of 3 and 4 can be observed at 403 and 384nm, respectively, under the same excitation conditions (λ ex =290nm). On the contrary, a relatively weak band in compound 3 is due to Zn atom fluorescence quenching, resulting from the abundant vibrating lattice water molecules, which give rise to the loss of energy by a non-radiative transition. Compared with the Hcptpy ligand, the enhancement and blue-shift in 4 is probably due to the unique coordination of the Hcptpy ligand to the Zn center, increasing the ligand’s conformational rigidity and thereby reducing the non-radiative decay of the intraligand (π→π∗) excited state [36]. To this point, the fluorescence quenching can be minimized with a rigid fluorophore-ligand architecture, which electronically decouples the metal cation from the fluorescence emitter. 4 Conclusions In summary, a series of coordination polymers 1–4 with various architectures were constructed from a new type of bifunctional ligand, Hcptpy, and the transition metal ZnII ion. It is clearly verified by compounds 1 and 2 that Hcptpy has the ability of adjusting its coordination configuration and mode under different pH conditions. It was found that compound 3 is distinguished from 4 due to the effect of different coordination sizes of the auxiliary ligand. Moreover, the difference in the fluorescence intensities of compounds 1 and 2 is caused by the diversity of the coordination structures. Compound 1 demonstrates notable fluorescent properties and possesses high thermo-stability, which indicates that it might be used in the area of photoluminescence. These results also provide a valuable insight into the rational design of variable dimensional materials and the synthesis of polynuclear clusters of other transition or lanthanide metals. Further studies on synthesizing other metal–organic frameworks with this ligand are under way in our laboratory.
