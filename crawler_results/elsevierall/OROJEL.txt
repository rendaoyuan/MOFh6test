Fax: +86 22 23502458. Two new metal-organic frameworks, {[CuLI]·CHCl3}∞(1) and {[HgL(Br)2]4·2CH2Cl2}∞ (2) have been prepared by reacting CuI and HgBr2 with the new flexible ligand L [L = 2,3-Bis(benzimidazol-1-ylmethyl)quinoxaline]. Both complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, IR, TGA, XRPD, and single crystal X-ray diffraction determination. In 1, the Cu(I) ion takes tetrahedral coordination geometry, and the flexible ligands bridge dinuclear units (Cu2I2) to form a one dimensional (1D) double chain structure. While in 2, the Hg(II) coordinates to two bromine ions and two nitrogen donors of L to form a 1D coordination polymer. The structure differences of the two complexes mainly depend on the geometry of the metal ions and the influence of anions. The coordination features of the ligand have also been primarily investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, the fluorescent properties of the complexes and free ligand L have been investigated in the solid state at room temperature. Graphical abstract Keywords Coordination polymer Crystal structure DFT calculations Luminescent properties 1 Introduction In recent years, metal-organic coordination architectures have attracted considerable attention in the field of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering due to their potential applications in many areas such as magnetism, catalysis, molecular recognition, and gas sorption, as well as the interesting structures such as cage, honeycomb, herringbone, rotaxanes, catenanes, etc [1–7]. Many efforts have been devoted to the rational design of specific frameworks including one (1D), two (2D), and three dimensional (3D) structures [8–10]. However, the coordination polymers with desired topologies and specific properties still remain a difficult challenge since there are a variety of factors influencing the formation of metal-organic frameworks such as the coordination geometry and the oxidation state of the metal ions, nature of the ligands, metal-to-ligand ratio, solvent system, counteranions, even the reaction temperature and pH value [11–14]. In general, the design of appropriate organic ligands as ‘building blocks’, together with the coordination preferences of the metal ions as ‘nodes’, is undoubtedly the most rational synthetic strategy. Over the past decades, there have been various examples of metal-organic coordination frameworks obtained by using pyridyl based bridging ligands, including 4,4′-bipyridine, 2,4,6-tripyridyl-1,3,5-triazine, and tetrapyridylporphyrin [15–17]. However, most of these reported ligands used in construction of the coordination frameworks are rigid. In contrast to the rigid ligands, the conformation of flexible ones can meet the coordination geometrical requirement of metal ions through changing their conformation, thus they can control and adjust the structure of the resulting coordination frameworks. Recently, flexible ligands, such as bis(imidazol), bis(trizaol), and bis(benzimidazol) ligand, have been used to construct coordination polymers with aesthetics and useful properties [18–21]. As our continuous focus on the synthesis, structure, and property of coordination frameworks with flexible organic ligands, a new flexible ligand 2,3-bis(benzenemizol-1-ylmethyl)quinoxaline (L, Chart 1 ) has been designed and synthesized, and two new 1D coordination polymers, {[CuLI]·CHCl3}∞ (1) and {[HgL(Br)2]4·2CH2Cl2}∞ (2) have been obtained by reacting of L with CuI or HgBr2. Complexes 1 and 2 have been characterized by elemental analysis, IR, TGA, XRPD, and single crystal X-ray diffraction determination. Furthermore, to explore the relationship between the nature of L ligand and its coordination abilities with metal ions, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out for estimating the coordination abilities of the different conformations. In addition, the fluorescent properties of the complexes and free ligand L have been investigated in the solid state at room temperature. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials and physical measurements The reagents and solvents were commercially available and used as received without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were performed on a Perkin-Elemer 240C analyzer. IR spectra were measured on a Tensor 27 (Bruker) FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets in the range 4000–400 cm−1. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC-P 300 spectrometer (300 MHz) in CDCl3 medium at 25 °C with tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) was recorded on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer at 40 kV, 100 mA for a Cu-target tube and a graphite monochromator. Simulation of the XRPD spectra was carried out by the single-crystal data and Mercury (1.4.2) program available free of charge via the internet at http://www.iucr.org. Thermal stability (TG-DTA) studies were carried out on a Dupont thermal analyzer from room temperature to 800 °C. Solid-state emission and excitation spectra of compounds were measured using Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. 2.2 Synthesis of ligand and complexes 2.2.1 2,3-Bis(benzimidazol-1-ylmethyl)quinoxaline (L) To the solution of benzimidazole (2.36 g, 20 mmol) in acetonitrile (50 mL), potassium hydroxide solution (1.12 g, 20 mmol) in distilled water (10 mL) was added and stirred for 30 min. Then 2,3-dibromoquinoxaline (3.16 g, 10 mmol) in acetonitrile (20 mL) was added and stirred for 72 h at room temperature. Finally the solvent was subsequently removed, and the crude product was purified by recrystallization from chloroform/hexane (v:v = 1:2).

Semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied using the SADABS program [22]. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares on F 2 using the SHELXL-97 program [23,24]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically and treated by a mixture of independent and constrained refinement. The crystallographic data for the complexes are listed in Table 1 , and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2 . 2.4 Calculation details The molecular mechanics optimization of the ligand (L) was carried out by DFT based on the structure obtained from the crystallographic data and the termination condition is that the RMS gradient is below 0.01 kcal/mol. Then the Gaussian 03 set of programs was applied to perform quantum-chemical computation of the MM+-optimized ligand [25]. The MM+-optimized ligand was further fully optimized using density functional theory (DFT) method with B3LYP exchange-correlation functional and 6-31G (d, p) basis set, respectively [26,27]. Also, to ensure that the stationary points located on the potential energy surfaces were minima, the vibrational frequency calculations were done. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure description of complexes 1 and 2 3.1.1 {[CuLI]·CHCl3}∞ (1) 1 crystallizes in the triclinic symmetry with space group P-1. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that 1 displays a 1D infinite double chain structure consisting of the neutral dinuclear Cu2I2 units and L ligands (Fig. 1 b). Cu(I) center locates on a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry, which is formed by two nitrogen donor atoms of bridging L ligand and two symmetrical I− anions (Fig. 1a). The selected bond lengths and angles are shown in Table 2. All the bond lengths around Cu(I) center are within normal range [Cu–N = 2.064(4) ∼ 2.039(4) Å, Cu–I = 2.6590(8) ∼ 2.6500(14) Å] (Table 2). In the L ligand, the dihedral angles between the plane of benzimidazole groups and the quinoxaline ring are 70.614° and 80.845°, respectively. And the dihedral angle between the two benzimidazole planes is 87.247°, which are almost perpendicular to each other. The two Cu(I) centers bridged by two I− anions are separated by a distance of 2.8045(13) Å. It is similar to the summed Van der Waals radii of two copper atoms (2.8 Å) and much longer than the Cu–Cu separation of 2.56 Å in metallic copper atoms [28]. At the same time, the two Cu2I2 units are further connected by two L ligands via Cu–N bonds to form a 26-membered ring, and the metallocyclic rings repeat itself to form a 1D infinite double chain coordination polymer (Fig. 1b). And the adjacent 1-D chains are further extended into 2D supramolecular networks by π⋯π stacking interactions between the quinoxaline rings from adjacent sheets (Fig. 1c). 3.1.2 {[HgL(Br)2]4·2CH2Cl2}∞ (2) When the reaction of L with HgBr2 was carried out in CH3OH/CH2Cl2 mixed solvents at room temperature, compound 2 was obtained. The result of crystallographic analysis shows that 2 is an infinite 1D polymeric structure (Fig. 2 a). The Hg(II) ion is in a distorted tetrahedral geometry, being coordinated by two nitrogen atoms [Hg(1)–N(1) = 2.270(10) Å, Hg(1)–N(6) = 2.286(10) Å] from two distinct L ligands and two bromide anions [Hg–Br = 2.5527(14) ∼ 2.5175(14) Å]. The angles N(1)–Hg(1)–N(6), Br(2)–Hg(1)–Br(1) and N(1)–Hg(1)–Br(1) range from 98.3(4)˚ to 124.67(6)˚. In 2, two benzimidazol rings are parallel to each other in each L, and the dihedral angle between the planes of benzimidazole and quinoxaline is 84.471°. The neighboring Hg⋯Hg distance connected by L is 14.052 Å. It is noteworthy that the C–H⋯Br weak interactions are observed. The distance of C(8)⋯Br(1A) is 3.648 Å, and the angle of C(8)–H(8B)⋯Br(1A) is 136.25°. Therefore, the 1D chains are further assembled by the C–H⋯Br weak interactions between adjacent chains to form an infinite 2D supramolecular sheet (Fig. 2b). 3.2 Theoretical computational results In order to explore the underlying relationship between the electron density of the coordinated N donors in L ligands and the spatial structures of their complexes from the standpoint of electronic effect, ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the ligands were performed. The full geometry optimizations for L based on the geometries of the coordinated ligands in 1 and 2 were carried out using DFT. The calculated electron density distributions for N donors of the L ligand were shown in Scheme 1 . The theoretical results show that the electron density distributions of the N donors of benzimidazol groups in L are slightly increased compared with the N donors of comparative quinoxaline rings. The N donors of the benzimidazol groups carried negative charge ranging from 0.4795 to 0.4832, and those of N donors in quinoxaline rings were from 0.4054 to 0.4151. Herein, the coordination ability of N donors in the quinoxaline ring is inferior to that of N donors in benzimidazol group, it is consistent with the final crystal structures of 1 and 2. 3.3 XRPD results To confirm the phase purity of the bulk materials, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) experiments have been carried out for complexes 1 and 2. The XRPD experimental and computer-simulated patterns of the corresponding complexes are shown in Fig. S1–S2 of Supporting information. Although the experimental patterns have a few un-indexed diffraction lines and some are slightly broadened in comparison with those simulated from the single-crystal models, it still can be well considered that the bulk synthesized materials and the crystals used for diffraction are homogeneous. 3.4 Thermogravimetric analysis and luminescent properties To study the thermal stability of complexes 1 and 2, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed by heating the corresponding complex under N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from ambient temperature to 800 °C, and the TGA curves are provided as Fig. S3–S4 in the Supporting information. The results show that 1 begins to decompose from 25 °C to 250 °C with the first weight loss of 16.7% (calcd. 17.0%), which may be attributed to the loss of the solvent chloroform molecules, and then weight loss continue until heating to above 630 °C. For 2, there was no obvious weight loss until the temperature was increased to 200 °C, then the complex begin to decompose gradually till 650 °C. Metal-organic frameworks with d10 configuration ions [Zn(II), Cd(II), Hg(II), Cu(I), Ag(I) and so on] have been found to be promising luminescent materials for their potential applications, such as light-emitting materials [29–31]. In the present work, the emission spectra of complexes 1, 2, and the free ligand L in the solid state at room temperature were investigated (Fig. 3 ). Complex 1 was excited at ca. 291 nm (288 nm for 2), and the main emission bands of the complexes were located at 382 nm and 392 nm, respectively. These emissions are neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), and can probably be assigned to the intra-ligand (n–π∗ or π–π∗) emission because similar emissions are observed at 393 nm for the free ligand L when excited at 287 nm. The results are in reasonable agreement with literature examples [32,33]. 4 Conclusion In summary, two new coordination polymers of Cu(I) and Hg(II) based on flexible benzimidazole-based ligand were synthesized and structurally characterized. Single crystal structure analysis shows that both complexes have 1D coordination architectures. Furthermore, the coordination behaviors of different N donors in L ligand have been briefly investigated by DFT calculations, and the thermogravimetric and luminescent properties of the two complexes have also been studied and discussed.
