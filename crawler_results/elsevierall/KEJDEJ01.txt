They were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction methods, FTIR, Raman, electronic spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Theoretical calculations were also performed. The optimized geometries were compared with crystallographic data. The experimental spectra were assigned with the help of calculated frequencies. The crystal structures of compounds Na[Cr(dipic)2]·2H2O (1) and [Cr(dipic)(phen)Cl]·1/2H2O (2), dipic=dipicolinate, phen=1,10-phenantroline, were determined. In both complexes, Cr(III) is in a distorted octahedral environment. In complex (1), the metal is coordinated to two nearly perpendicular dipic anions acting as tridentate ligands through one oxygen of each carboxylate group and the pyridinic nitrogen atom. In complex (2), Cr(III) ion is similarly coordinated to a dipic anion, defining a ligand equatorial plane. The phen molecule bridges the remaining equatorial coordination site and one of the axial positions through its N-atoms. The other axial position is occupied by a chloride ion. The optimized geometries of both compounds and their corresponding harmonic vibrational frequencies were calculated using methods of density functional theory. The infrared, Raman and electronic spectra of the complexes were recorded. Assignments of the most characteristic bands are reported and discussed. Their electrochemical properties were also investigated. Both compounds exhibit similar redox behavior; they undergo two main reduction processes involving the metal center and the dipicolinato ligand. No Cr(III) oxidation processes were found. Keywords Chromium-complexes X-ray structure Spectroscopy Density functional calculations Redox properties 1 Introduction Numerous studies have been developed with the aim of determining the chromium function at molecular level but its biological role is still controversial and not well understood. Some compounds of Cr(VI) are well-established carcinogens [1,2]. Chromium enters mammalian cells in the hexavalent form and it is reduced by intracellular materials to Cr(III), which binds to DNA via guanine N-7 atoms and phosphate groups [3]. The long-term toxicity effects observed in workers exposed to occupational Cr(VI) was proposed to be attributed to reoxidation of accumulated Cr(III), previously reduced within the cell [1]. In contrast, Cr(III) is considered an essential trace element for humans, enhancing the activity of insulin in glucose and fat metabolism and it is recognized as a dietary supplement [4–6]. However, some divergence is found actually with respect to this role [2,7–10]. Studies carried out with the popular dietary supplement Cr(pic)3 (pic=picolinate) show that this compound produces oxidative stress and DNA damage [11–14]. Recently, it was also suggested that the antidiabetic activities of Cr(III)-containing nutritional supplements could involve the formation of genotoxic Cr(V/VI) species, by intra or extra cellular oxidation, which acts similarly to well-known insulin-mimetic V(V) compounds [15]. Mechanistic studies of biologically relevant redox reactions of chromium complexes in different oxidation states have been recently reviewed [16]. The involvement of Cr(III) in intracellular redox reactions, that generate species capable to produce DNA damage and mutation in bacterial and mammalian cells, has been postulated and some mechanisms were proposed [17–19]. Cr(III) compounds containing aromatic imines as ligands have shown mutagenic effects in bacterial assays. Electrochemical studies reveal that, for these compounds, the Cr(III)/Cr(II) redox couple is reversible and exhibits reduction potential within the range of cellular reductant agents. Thus, it was suggested that the mutagenic compounds could be reduced intracelullary and generate DNA damaging hydroxyl radicals via Fenton-like reactions. In contrast, non-mutagenic Cr(III) complexes show irreversible behavior and more negative Cr(III)/Cr(II) reduction potential [19]. As part of our studies on metal complexes of biological interest, containing dipicolinic acid and related ligands [20–22] and in an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of the physicochemical properties of Cr(III) complexes containing organic ligands, Na[Cr(dipic)2]·2H2O (1) and [Cr(dipic)(phen)Cl]·1/2H2O (2) were investigated. Dipicolinic acid (H2dipic, 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid) is a relevant N–O chelating agent, present in many natural compounds, that shows various biological functions and potential pharmacological activity. Even though 1,10-phenantroline has no significant biological role, complexes of this ligand with Cr(III) have been extensively studied as models of metal centers coordinated by aromatic bases [17–19]. In the present paper, the optimized geometries, calculated by means of the density functional theory were compared with crystallographic data and the experimental vibrational modes were assigned with the help of calculated frequencies. The electrochemical study of both complexes was performed in dimethysulfoxide (DMSO) solutions. The results were complemented with electronic spectroscopy and the assignment of experimental bands was accomplished with the aid of calculated electronic transitions obtained through the time dependent density functional theory. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents CrCl3 ·6H2O, dipicolinic acid and 1,10-phenantroline (analytical grade, Sigma), were used without further purification. High purity DMSO (Aldrich) was used for the electrochemical measurements. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6), employed as supporting electrolyte, was purchased from Fluka (electrochemical grade). 2.2 Synthesis of complexes 2.2.1 Na[Cr(dipic)2]·2H2O (1) Dipicolinic acid (H2dipic, 0.12 g, 0.72mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (25ml) and drop wise added, under continuous stirring, to an ethanolic solution (25ml) of CrCl3 ·6H2O (0.14g, 0.53mmol). After 60min stirring, at room temperature, 0.1M NaOH was drop wise added to the resulting dark green solution until a color change, first to blue and finally to violet, was observed. The reaction mixture was stirred during 60min more and then left to stand at room temperature. After two weeks, purple crystals suitable for X-ray structural analysis were obtained. The yield was 57%. Anal. Calc. for C14H10CrN2O10Na: C, 38.1; H, 2.3; N, 6.3. Found: C, 37.8; H, 2.5; N, 6.1%. 2.2.2 [Cr(dipic)(phen)Cl]·1/2H2O (2) Even though the complex was prepared following the reported procedure [23], crystals suitable for X-ray structural analysis were obtained in the present case. To an ethanolic solution (50ml) of CrCl3 ·6H2O (0.27g, 1.0mmol) was added drop-by-drop an ethanolic solution (50ml) of dipicolinic acid (0.17g, 1.0mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 60min, when it turned deep green colored. Afterwards, an ethanolic solution (50ml) of phenantroline (0.20g, 1.1mmol) was dropwise added and the stirring was continued for 60min, at room temperature, until a violet solution was obtained. The system was kept at room temperature and after two weeks it showed the precipitation of purple single crystals. The yield was 42%. Anal. Calc. for C19H12CrN3O4.5Cl: C, 51.6; H, 2.7; N, 9.5. Found: C, 51.2; H, 2.5; N, 9.7%. 2.3 Physicochemical characterization Elemental analysis (C,H,N) was performed using a Carlo Erba EA 1108 analyzer. FTIR spectra (4000–200cm−1) were measured using the KBr pellet technique with a Bruker 113v instrument. Raman spectra were obtained with a Bruker IFS 66 FTIR spectrophotometer, using the FRA 106 Raman accessory and the 1064nm line of a Nd:YAG solid state laser for excitation. The electronic absorption spectra of the complexes and the ligands were measured on freshly prepared DMSO solutions in the 200–800nm spectral range. They were recorded with a Hewlett–Packard 8452-A diode array spectrometer, using 10mm quartz cells. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out with a computer controlled Princeton Applied Research (PAR) Potentiostat/Galvanostat model 263A. A standard three-electrode cell was used with a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/(10−3 M) AgNO3 in CH3CN as the reference electrode. This electrode was calibrated against the [Fe(C5H5)2]/[Fe(C5H5)2]+ redox couple, for which a potential of +0.4V vs NHE was assumed [24,25]. All potentials reported here are referred to NHE in volts. Measurements were performed in oxygen purged 10−3 M DMSO solutions with 0.1M TBAPF6 as supporting electrolyte. During the measurements, a continuous nitrogen stream was passed over the solutions. 2.4 Theoretical calculations The gaussian 03 package [26] was used both for geometry optimizations and vibrational frequencies calculations. Becke’s three parameters hybrid density functional [27] with the gradient-corrected correlation functional due to Lee et al. [28], a combination that gives rise to the well-known B3LYP method, was employed. The 6-31G(d,p) basis set was utilized for all atoms. The ADF package [29–31] was used to calculate the electronic spectra of both complexes. The gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functional due to Perdew et al. [32] was used for the self-consistent field calculations, whereas the adiabatic local density approximation [33] was utilized for the time dependent density functional kernel. The atomic orbitals of all atoms were represented by a basis set of Slater functions having triple-zeta quality in the valence space and including two sets of polarization functions. The frozen core approximation up to the 1s orbital for C, N, and O, and up to the 2p orbital for Cr was used. 2.5 X-ray diffraction data and crystal structure determination Diffraction data were collected on an Enraf-Nonius CAD4 diffractometer with EXPRESS [34] and reduced with XCAD4 [35]. The data were corrected numerically for absorption with platon [36]. The structures were solved by direct and Fourier methods with shelxs [37] and its non-H atom refined by full-matrix least-squares with shelxl [38]. The hydrogen atoms of the organic molecules in both substances were positioned stereo-chemically and refined with the riding model. The H-atoms of one crystallization water molecule of Na[Cr(dipic)2]·2H2O were found in a difference Fourier map and refined isotropically with Ow-H and H⋯H distances restrained to target values of 0.86(1) and 1.36(1)Å, respectively. The H-atoms of the other water molecule could not be positioned reliably and therefore they were not included in the refinement. The crystallization water molecule of the [Cr(dipic)(phen)Cl]·1/2H2O complex showed positional disorder around a crystal inversion center. It was modeled in term of two sites for the oxygen atom and refined isotropically with occupation factor of 1/2 for each site. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Theoretical calculations The geometry of both complexes were optimized in the gas phase using tools from the density functional theory [39–41]. Calculations were carried out without specifying any symmetry for the complexes. A quartet electronic state corresponding to a high-spin electronic configuration for the Cr(III) ion was considered for both compounds, thus unrestricted Kohn–Sham calculations were accomplished throughout. No countercations were taken into account in the calculations for complex (1). A vibrational analysis was performed for the optimized geometries to verify whether they are local minima or saddle points on the potential energy surface of the molecules. No scale factor was used to correct the calculated frequencies. The electronic excitations of both complexes were calculated using the time dependent density functional theory [42,43]. 3.2 Structural results Crystal data and refinement results for compounds (1) and (2) are summarized in Table 1 . Experimental and calculated bond distances and angles around Cr(III) ion are presented in Tables 2 and 3 . Figures 1 and 2 show the ORTEP [44] drawings of the molecules. Na[Cr(dipic) 2 · 2H 2 O: Cr(III) ion is in a distorted octahedral environment, coordinated to two dipic anions acting as tridentate ligands through its carboxylic oxygen atoms [Cr–O distances in the range from 1.985(5) to 1.998(4)Å] and the nitrogen atoms [d(Cr–N1)=1.972(5) and d(Cr–N2)=1.980(5)Å]. The dipic ligands are nearly planar [rms deviation of atoms from the corresponding least-squares planes less than of 0.07Å] and perpendicular to each other [dihedral angle of 81.73(5)°]. The metal ion lies close onto the intersection of the coordination planes (along the N1⋯N2 direction). The sodium ion is in a compact sixfold coordination with four carboxylic oxygen atoms of neighboring dipic groups [Na⋯O distances in the range from 2.406(6) to 2.651(6)Å] and the two water molecules [d(Na⋯O1w)=2.329(6)Å and d(Na⋯O2w)=2.412(5)Å]. As the geometry optimization within the density functional framework was accomplished in the gas phase, that is without any perturbation as the ones arising from crystal packing effects, the two dipic ligands are located symmetrically around the metal ion, as can be seen from Table 2. This fact is in clear contrast with the experimental N1–Cr–N2 bond angle, which amounts to ca. 173°. Moreover, experimental N–Cr–O bond angles, in which N belongs to one of the dipic ligands and O belongs to the other dipic ligand, deviate from the gas phase value of 101.4°. It can also be observed in Table 2 that experimental N2–Cr–O11 and N2–Cr–O13 bond angles differ by about 3° with respect to the gas phase value, whereas N1–Cr–O21 and N1–Cr–O23 bond angles differ by about 6°. These findings seem to indicate that countercations interact differently with the two dipic ligands. [Cr(dipic)(phen)Cl] · 1/2H 2 O: Cr(III) ion is in a sixfold environment, coordinated to one dipic ion defining a ligand equatorial plane [Cr–O distances of 1.975(3) and 1.999(3)Å and d(Cr–N)=1.969(4)Å] and to a phen molecule acting as a bidentate ligand that bridges the fourth equatorial coordination site and one axial position through its nitrogen atoms [Cr–N distances of 2.075(4) and 2.081(3)Å, respectively]. The other axial position is occupied by a chlorine ion [d(Cr–Cl)=2.290(1)Å]. The dipic and phen molecules are nearly planar [rms deviation of atoms from the corresponding least-squares planes less than of 0.045Å for both ligands] and close to mutual perpendicularity [angled at 86.60(7)° from each other]. As for the sodium salt, the Cr(III) ion nearly lies on the intersection of the coordination planes (along the N1⋯N21 direction). The agreement between theoretical and experimental data is better than for complex (1) as can be seen in Table 3. The most relevant differences are observed when the N1–Cr–N21, N1–Cr–N22 and N21–Cr–N22 bond angles are compared. The ideal, gas phase values are 173.8° and 96.2°, respectively, whereas the experimental ones are 177.2° and 97.8°, respectively. These facts suggest that the phen ligand becomes stabilized in the solid state in a rather strained conformation. This can also be confirmed by comparing the experimental and gas phase values of the N21–Cr–N22 bond angle, which amount to 79.4° and 77.6°, respectively, thus differing by about 1.8°. 3.3 Vibrational spectra Data of some of the most characteristic IR and Raman bands of the compounds are presented in Table 4 along with those of the H2dipic and phen ligands. Main differences between the spectra of the ligands and the complexes were found below 700cm−1. The O–H stretching modes of the crystallization water molecules give rise to two bands of medium intensity at 3475–3200cm−1 in the IR spectrum of (1). For compound (2), this mode is superimposed with the ν(CH) mode of phen and appears as one broad and weak IR band centered at 3400cm−1. In the compounds spectra, all the bands involving O–H motions of the carboxylate group are absent, namely the O–H stretching of the COOH groups, the C–OH in-plane bending and out-of-plane O–H deformation modes, hence showing deprotonation of the –COOH group and coordination to the metal [45], as disclosed by the X-ray structure. The characteristic IR carboxylate bands of the free acid, ν(CO) and ν(C–O), are transformed into the asymmetric, ν as(COO), and symmetric, ν s(COO), stretching vibrations of the carboxylate group and as expected they are shifted after complex formation. The frequency difference between these bands is consistent with unidentate coordination of the carboxylate moiety to the metal [46]. Moreover, the δ(COO) mode, which appears in the spectra of the ligand as a strong band at 701cm−1, is shifted to higher frequency upon complexes formation. This behavior is similar to that observed in some complexes containing the dipic ligand [21, and references therein]. From the calculations, the splitting observed in the ν as(COO) bands is attributed to the presence of in-phase and out-of-phase motions due to vibrational coupling between both terminal groups. Nevertheless, both calculated frequencies for complex (1) have almost coincident values (1771cm−1). In the symmetric mode, coupling with the C–COO stretching is also predicted. The calculated spectra also allow assigning differentially the vibrations for each free ligand, which are usually coupled with other modes. As expected, they undergo changes in intensity and position upon complexation [46,47]. The changes observed in the spectra of the complexes in the 700–200cm−1 region are attributed to the coordination of the ligands to the metal. A new band of medium intensity at 683cm−1 can be assigned to the out-of-plane ring deformation of the dipic, coupled with out-of-plane deformation of the Cr–N–C–C–O rings (Cr–L rings in Table 4). Furthermore, a band at ca. 450cm−1 with two shoulders, at higher and lower frequencies respectively, is present in both complexes. Calculations allow the assignment of these shoulders to ν(Cr–N) and to ν(Cr–O) stretchings. Some bands in this low-frequency region can be attributed to out-of-plane Cr–L rings deformations. The very weak bands at 395cm−1 and at 226cm−1 can be assigned to the Cr–Cl stretching and to the out-of-plane deformation of Cr–L ring, coupled with a Cr–Cl stretching in complex (2), respectively. 3.4 Electrochemical results Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the compounds were performed, in the potential range where they are electroactive, at incremental scan rates (v) from 0.05V/s to 2.5V/s. They were compared with those obtained with CrCl3 and H2dipic under similar experimental conditions. Data of the reduction and oxidation peaks at v =0.25V/s are summarized in Table 5 . The phen ligand was not active within the investigated potential range. The CV of H2dipic display two overlapping irreversible reduction peaks at −1.36V and −1.56V which do not show associated oxidation processes in the reverse scan, even at the highest scan rate. Moreover, at more positive potentials one small couple is observed. The anomalous behavior of this couple and its dependence with electrode pretreatment suggest adsorption on the electrode surface. Figure 3 , curve A, shows the voltammetric behavior of the Na[Cr(dipic)2]·2H2O compound, at v =0.25V/s. Two redox couples labeled I/I′ and II/II′, are observed. The reduction current associated with peak II was measured from decaying baseline of peak I. The results indicates that the current ratio I/II is close to one at all scan rates investigated, suggesting that in both reduction the same number of electrons is involved. On the other hand, although the separations of anodic (E pa) and cathodic (E pc) peak potentials of each process is larger than the value expected for a reversible charge transfer, the separation between the peak and half peak potential (E pc − E p/2) is 58mV. This fact seems to point to a reversible one electron transfer for these processes (a reversible diffusion-controlled process should have (E p − E p/2) values of 56.5/nmV) [48–50]. In addition, the peak current of both reductions increases with the square root of the scan rate (v 1/2), approaching a single straight-line plot, in accordance with diffusion control, and the ratio of anodic to cathodic peak currents (i pa/i pc) is near unity. These observations are indicative that the products of these reductions are stable during the time of the measurements. To determine the origin of couples I and II, a complementary set of experiments was performed: (a) 1mM solution of CrCl3 ·6H2O was first measured in the absence of the ligand (see Table 5). Subsequently, H2dipic was added to this solution. For ligand to metal concentration ratio L/M=2 a new species is formed. Two main processes, at similar potential to that found for the complex, and a cathodic shoulder at ca. −1.26V were observed. This last contribution corresponds to the reduction of a fraction of “free” Cr(III), since it appears at similar potential to that found when a solution of CrCl3 in the absence of ligand was measured. (b) Cyclic voltammograms of 1mM complex solution were recorded at selected scan rates, and afterwards, an equimolar amount of H2dipic was added. In Figure 1, curve B, a representative voltammogram at 0.25V/s, is presented. After ligand addition, the cathodic current of peak I increases while the one related to peak II, measured from decaying baseline of peak I, remains unchanged. In this case, and for all scan rates investigated, the ratio I/II was close to 1.85, in contraposition with the value of 1, found when a solution of the complex alone was measured. The cyclic voltammogram of the free ligand in solution exhibited also one reduction peak at similar potential to that observed for peak I (−1.36V), which remains irreversible at all scan rates investigated. In a similar way, after addition of the ligand, the oxidation current I′, associated with peak I, remains almost unchanged. Therefore, based upon the discussed results, it can be assumed that the first peak corresponds to a ligand-centered reduction. The coordination with the metal changes the kinetic of this process from an irreversible to a reversible charge transfer [49] (a) Peak I [ Cr III ( dipic ) 2 ] - + e - ⇌ [ Cr III ( dipic ) 2 ] 2 - E 1 / 2 = - 1.24 V In addition, process II can be attributed to the reduction and subsequent oxidation of the metal center: (b) Peak II [ Cr III ( dipic ) 2 ] 2 - + e - ⇌ [ Cr II ( dipic ) 2 ] 3 - E 1 / 2 = - 1.68 V Figure 4 shows that a compound (2) holds a qualitatively similar cyclic voltammetric behavior. In fact, the electrochemical results indicate that [Cr(dipic)(phen)Cl]·1/2H2O dissociates in solution generating [Cr(dipic)2]−, as principal product. The two main couples, which appear at similar potential and display analogous behavior to that observed for complex (1), can be also described by means of Eqs. (a) and (b). In addition, the small cathodic peaks and their anodic counterpart, that are absent in complex (1), can be attributed to new species in solution that contain phen, chloro and probably solvent molecules in their coordination spheres. The characteristic couple 2Cl−/Cl2, which appears at 1.18V in the CrCl3 solution, is absent in this case, thus denoting that the chloride ligand remains attached to the metal. 3.5 Electronic spectra The electronic spectra of complex (1) in DMSO solution is shown in Figure 5 . The positions of the absorption maxima are listed in Table 6 , together with the calculated transitions, which are selected according their respective oscillator strengths. The composition of the molecular orbitals, shown in Table 7 , is determined in terms of atomic gross populations obtained through a Mulliken population analysis. Atomic percent contributions to molecular orbitals are summed up for each ligand in complex (1). The experimental spectrum of complex (2) differs appreciably from the calculated one and, furthermore, it is very similar to the experimental spectrum corresponding to complex (1). These facts seem to suggest that complex (2) undergoes some reaction in solution in accordance with the electrochemical studies, which predict the same final species in solution for both complexes. Then, the assignments for both experimental spectra are discussed in terms of the calculated transitions for complex (1). Theoretical electronic transitions, the corresponding assignments, and the molecular orbital composition of non-dissociated complex (2) are available as Supplementary material. Both ligands show strong absorptions at short wavelengths and up to ca. 300nm. In addition, the phen spectrum presents a band of lower intensity around 320nm. Calculated transitions at ca. 432nm in complex (1), attributed to d–d transitions, are not seen in the experimental spectrum. It can be assumed to be hidden by the more intense charge-transfer bands. According to the analysis of the orbitals involved in the transitions, the broad band with maximum at 548nm for complex (1) can be assigned to Cr→dipic charge-transfer transitions, mainly involving ligand rings. The strong absorption at the short wavelength end of the spectrum presents two shoulders, located at 353nm and 312nm. The first one can be considered as a combination of intraligand and dipic→Cr charge-transfer transitions, involving the oxygen atoms of the ligands. The shoulder at higher energy can be mainly attributed to dipic→Cr charge-transfer transitions, from the oxygen atoms. Two high-intensity transitions at 656nm and 604nm are calculated for complex (2). They involve molecular orbitals having large contributions from dipic and phen ligands. Since those absorption bands are not observed in the experimental spectrum, it could be suggested that none species in solution contains simultaneously both ligands. Moreover, the experimental spectrum of complex (2) exhibits a small shoulder at 422nm, which is not observed for complex (1) and that can be assigned to a Cr→phen charge-transfer transition, according to the theoretical results. The above results support the proposal that complex (2) undergoes decomposition in DMSO solution, giving rise to new minor species containing phen, but no dipic, in the coordination sphere. These species could be responsible for the slight differences observed in the spectrum of this solution with respect to that of complex (1). 4 Conclusions The IR and Raman properties of the compounds Na[Cr(dipic)2]·2H2O and [Cr(dipic)(phen)Cl]·1/2H2O, dipic=dipicolinate, phen=1,10-phenantroline, are in good agreement with the results of X-ray crystallography. Unidentate coordination of the carboxylate moiety to the metal, determined from the difference between ν(COO)as and ν(COO)s, is in accordance with the structural and theoretical results. Important changes, that can be attributed to metal coordination, were observed in the IR spectra of the compounds when compared with the ligands, in the 700–200cm−1 region. Out-of-plane deformations involving the five member ring (Cr–N–C–C–O) formed upon coordination of chromium with the dipic ligand, as well as the ν(Cr–N) and ν(Cr–O) vibrations modes, were clearly identified in the low-frequency region of the spectra with the help of harmonic vibrational frequencies, calculated in this work. Both compounds are stable in air in the crystalline state. Electrochemical and electronic spectroscopy measurements show that the complex [Cr(dipic)(phen)Cl]·1/2H2O undergoes decomposition in DMSO solution generating [Cr(dipic)2]− as major product. It was also established by cyclic voltammetry that the Cr(III) center is not oxidized to Cr(VI) or Cr(V) genotoxic species within the potential range investigated. The complexes experienced two main redox processes, corresponding to the ligand and to the metal center reduction, respectively. The Cr(III)/Cr(II) redox couple does not lie within the range of biological reductants. It was found at more negative potential that than reported for chromium mutagenic compounds.
