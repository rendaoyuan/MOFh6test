Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities and the thermal stabilities of complexes 1 and 2 were examined. The hydrothermal reaction of La2O3 and Pr2O3 with pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (H2pydc), CuO, and H2O with a mole ratio of 1:2:4:300 resulted in the formation of two polymeric Cu(II)–Ln(III) complexes, [{Ln4Cu2(pydc)8(H2O)8}·18H2O] n (Ln=La (1); Pr (2)). 1 and 2 are isomorphous and crystallize in monoclinic space group C2/c. Complexes 1 and 2 have one-dimensional infinite chains with “∞” shape. The 1D chains are linked by the hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions to form layer structures which are further linked by the hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions to form the three-dimensional (3D) structures with nanoscale porosities.

Keywords Lanthanide(III)–copper(II) coordination polymers Pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid Crystal structures Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities The thermal stabilities 1 Introduction Over the past several decades, a variety of zeolites and open framework inorganic solids containing nanosized pores or channels with controlled sizes, shapes, and chemical environments have been developed, which has drawn much attention because they have potential applications in pharmaceutical manufacture, separation, catalysis, molecular recognition, and optoelectronic application [1]. In recent years, studies in coordination polymers as organic zeolite-like solids, built up from metals and multifunctional organic ligands, represent a rapidly expanding field. The “modular” approach has been successfully employed in the construction of metal-organic open-framework materials and various tailored organic building blocks and metal ions have been used to assemble a variety of nanoporous three-dimensional (3D) networks [2]. Although these efforts have contributed greatly to our understanding of how to build such solid-state structures, we still need to explore new building blocks and building principles before we are truly able to design and build versatile architectures with specifical function, such as superconducting and magnetic properties [3]. On the other hand, lanthanide-transition metal complexes are good models to investigate the nature of the magnetic exchange interactions between 3d and 4f metal ions in magnetic materials that contain rare earth metals [4]. Since the high coordination number of Ln(III) may render structural flexibility and increase the thermodynamic stability, this aspect has attracted considerable attention and a great number of structural types of lanthanide-transition metal complexes have been reported [5]. However, many such studies have focused on discrete or infinite chain complexes, which were synthesized from conventional self-assembly reaction in solution or hydrothermal synthetic method. Studies on lanthanide-transition metal organic complexes with nanoscale porous 3D open-framework, including those with porosities generated and sustained by the non-covalent interactions such as the hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions, have been still poorly explored [6,7]. Our previous investigation of metal complexes with the branched unsymmetrical tripodal ligand N-[N′-(carboxymethyl)benzimidazol-2-yl-methyl]-N,N-bis(benzimidazol-2-ylmethyl)amine (HACntb) or symmetrical tris(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine (ntb)/tris(1-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine (nteb) has revealed that C 3-symmetric ntb can encapsulate lanthanide(III) ions to afford large hexafunctional hydrogen-donor building blocks, which were further assembled to form doubly interpenetrating 3D stereoisomeric networks with large cavities [8]. However, more flexible ligand nteb was employed to obtain two interesting complexes [9]. One is chiral due to the same clockwise (ΔΔ) or anticlockwise (ΛΛ) arrangements of two tripodal ligands, but two opposite enantiomers co-crystallize to form a racemate. While the other can be described as a mesocate (ΔΛ) because two tripodal ligands in the same molecule present clockwise and anticlockwise conformation, respectively. And unsymmetric HACntb may chelate copper(II) ions to assembly an open, 3D network of nanoscale porosity by N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds [10]. These findings promised us to utilize tailored secondary building units (SBUs) to fabricate nanoporous Ln–Cu supramolecular newtork with magnetic properties. To achieve this goal, pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (H2pydc) were employed as initial reagents, two complexes [{Ln4Cu2(pydc)8(H2O)8}·18H2O] n (Ln=La (1), Pr (2)), one-dimensional (1D) infinite chains with “∞” shape, were obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. Then, 1D chains are linked by the hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions to form layer structures, which are further linked by the hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions to form the 3D structures with nanoscale porosities. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and measurements All materials were of reagent grade obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin–Elmer 240C analytical instrument. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FT-IR-170SX spectrophotometer in KBr pellets. The magnetic susceptibility data were collected from polycrystalline samples at an external field of 10 kG for 1 on a PPMS Model 6000 magnetometer (Quantum Design) in the temperature range 5–300 K. The output data were corrected for the diamagnetism of the sample holder and of the samples calculated from their Pascal’s constants. Thermal gravimetric analysis was performed on a Delta Series TGA7 instrument. 2.2 Preparation of coordination polymers [{La4Cu2 (pydc)8 (H2O)8}·18H2O] n (1): A mixture of La2O3 (0.082 g, 0.25 mmol), CuO (0.040 g, 0.5 mmol), 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (0.168 g, 1.0 mmol), and H2O (20 mL) in a mole ratio of about 1:2:4:300 was heated in a 25-mL stainless-steel reactor with a Teflon liner at 140 °C for 80 h.

Absorption corrections were performed using the SADABS program [11]. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares against F 2 of data using shelxtl software [12]. Anisotropic displacement parameters were assigned to all of the non-hydrogen atoms, while the hydrogen atoms were included in the calculations isotropically but not refined. A summary of parameters for the data collections and refinements is given in Table 1 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis The hydrothermal reactions of lanthanide oxide, pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, and copper(II) oxide or copper(II) salts resulted in the formation of complexes 1 and 2. Unfortunately, the reaction of Ln(III) and Cu(II), and H2pydc by a conventional solution method, an uncharacterized polymer, insoluble in most common solvents, was obtained. It was apparent that the reaction speed must be reduced to avoid the rapid polymerization and the unusual synthetic method should be employed to obtain single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. The hydrothermal synthetic method is well known, due to its ability to produce metastable compounds which may not be accessible by the conventional method and thereby promote crystal growth [13]. After introducing a hydrothermal synthesis, along with using Ln2O3, CuO, H2pydc and H2O as initial reagents in a molar ratio of 1:2:4:300 at 140 °C, two [{La4Cu2(pydc)8(H2O)8}·18H2O] n (1) and [{Pr4Cu2(pydc)8(H2O)8}·18H2O] n (2) with infinite structures were isolated and characterized. 3.2 Thermogravimetric analyses Owing to the similarity of the structures for the two complexes, 1 was selected for thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), to examine the thermal stability of complexes. The TGA curve for 1 shows that the first weight loss of 13.97% below 95.2 °C corresponds to the loss of the solvated water molecules (calculated: 13.96%) and the next weight loss of 5.54% between 113 and 280 °C corresponds to the loss of the coordinated water molecules (calculated: 5.52%). The total of two step loss weight is 19.51%; it equates to the loss of all coordinated water and uncoordinated water (calculated: 19.48%). Then, decomposition of compound 1 started above 320 °C and ended at about 450 °C. 3.3 Structure description [{La4Cu2 (pydc)8 (H2O)8}·18H2O] n (1): X-ray crystallography has established that complex 1 adopts a 1D infinite chain with two eight-coordinate lanthanum and two six-coordinate copper ions located at the apexes of a tetragon. As shown in Fig. 1 , each of the two pydc2− ligands coordinates to Cu in a tridentate manner through two oxygen atoms (O2, O5 or O1, O6) of two different carboxyl groups and a nitrogen atom (N1 or N2), forming four five-membered rings. The dihedral angle of the two pyridine rings coordinated to the same copper ion is 81.0°, and the coordination configuration of Cu2+ should be octahedron sphere (see Fig. 1(a)). Two (O9 and O7) of the remaining four carboxyl oxygen atoms of two pydc2− ligands coordinate to two adjacent lanthanum ions forming two anti–anti carboxylate bridges between Cu and La ions, the other two (O2 and O3) are free. For La3+, four oxygen atoms from different pydc2− ligands occupy four of the coordination sites of the La ion. The remaining four sites are taken up by four water molecules. Thus, the geometry of the La ion may be viewed as a distorted bicapped trigonal prism (see Fig. 1(b)). Complex 1 is polymer with the Cu(pydc)2 units linked together by the La(H2O)4 bridges in four different directions, forming a 1D infinite chain connected by La–Cu–La–Cu tetragonal rings sharing common apexes of La ions (Fig. 2 ). The dihedral angle of two tetragonal rings is about 49.8°. The averaging bond lengths of Cu–N, Cu–O, and La–O are 2.186, 1.94, and 2.507 Å, respectively, which are comparable to those bonds found in the lanthanide(III)–copper(II)–iminoacetate complexes previously reported [7b,14]. The shortest Pr⋯Pr, Pr⋯Cu, and Cu⋯Cu separations in 1 are 7.984, 6.132, and 9.775 Å, respectively. Within the crystal lattice, the chains are parallel to each other and linked by the hydrogen bonds O–H⋯O and π⋯π stacking interactions to form layered wave-like structures which are further linked by hydrogen bonds O–H⋯O (O10⋯O4 2.962 Å, Symmetry code: x, −y, z−1/2; O9⋯O4 2.872 Å, Symmetry code: −x +1/2, y +1/2, −z +1/2; and π⋯π stacking interactions (with centroid–to-centroid distance 3.545 Å between two parallel pyridine rings) to form 3D structure with nanoscale porosities. Such an organization creates channels parallel to the axis of the chains (Fig. 3 (a)) (the nanoscale porosities 0.46 nm×1.86 nm). In addition, viewing along c-axis there are also channels perpendicular to the axis of the chains, these intersecting channels are clearly apparent in Fig. 3(b) (the nanoscale porosities 0.66 nm×1.26 nm). It should be emphasized that the latter are partially filled by the O atoms of the carboxyl groups and the lattice water molecules. [{Pr4Cu2 (pydc)8 (H2O)8}·18H2O] n (2): Compound 2 is isomorphous to the compound 1 (see Table 2 ) and also displays a 3D structure with nanoscale porosities generated and sustained by the non-covalent interactions, such as the hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions among parallel 1D chains with “∞” shape. Only very small metric differences have been observed for the two compounds because of the radius of Pr(III) ions. Thus, all of the metal-ligand bonds in 2 are slightly shorter than the corresponding bonds in 1, as compared in Table 2. At the same time, all of the bond angles in compound 2 have slight differences compared to the corresponding parameters of complexes 1. The shortest Pr⋯Pr, Pr⋯Cu, and Cu⋯Cu distances are 7.979, 6.087, and 9.671 Å, respectively, slightly shorter than those of 1. 3.4 Magnetism of complex 1 The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility of the compounds 1 in the temperature range 5–300 K at an applied field of 10 kOe for 1 was measured and the χ M, 1/χ M and χ M T versus T plots of magnetic susceptibility data for compound 1 are shown in Fig. 4 . In compound 1, the lanthanide ion La(III) is diamagnetic and the magnetic study will provide some information about the interaction between (II) ions. For 1, the value of χ m T is 0.852 emu Kmol−1 at 300 K (Fig. 4), which is slightly lower than that expected for two uncoupled Cu(II) ions (0.907 emu Kmol−1), indicating non-magnetic exchange interaction between adjacent two Cu(II) ions at room temperature (only because the distance of Cu–Cu in the same repeating unit is 9.773 Å). It increases very slowly upon cooling and reaches abruptly a maximum at 24 K (χ m T =1.09 emu Kmol−1) and then decreases to 1.03 emu Kmol−1 at 5 K. In the 1/χ m versus T plot (Fig. 4), the observed susceptibility data are fitted to the Curie–Weiss law (χ m = C/(T−Θ)), with Weiss constant Θ =6.069 K and C =1.30790 emu Kmol−1, indicative of weak ferromagnetic behavior. In summary, we have successfully constructed two Cu(II)–Ln(III) polymers by pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid in hydrothermal reactions. For 1, two carboxyl groups of the rigid ligand H2pydc take (1) and (2) two coordination forms to coordinate with lanthanum and copper ions, respectively. Thus an 1D chain polymer is obtained, and finally O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds and π⋯π stacking interactions between 1D infinite chains generate an open, 3D network. Use of an effective rigid multidentate ligand precludes interpenetration of the type observed in H2 pydc. We anticipate that compounds 1 and 2 are useful for the designing of nanoporous organic solids with magnetic properties generated and sustained by non-covalent interactions. 4 Supplementary material Crystallographic data (excluding structure factors) for the structures reported have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre with CCDC reference numbers 249236 and 249237, respectively, for compounds 1 and 2.
