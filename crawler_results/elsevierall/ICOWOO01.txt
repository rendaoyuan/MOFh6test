Keywords Coordination polymers Crystal structures Main group metal Imidazole-based dicarboxylate 1 Introduction In the past two decades, coordination polymers have been gained considerable attention due to their fascinating structural diversity and potential applications for catalysis, magnetic, nonlinear optical and fluorescent materials [1–6]. It is well known that multifunctional organic ligands play an important role in directing the extended structure of the coordination polymers [7–12]. Thus the deliberate selection of multifunctional organic ligands to prepare interesting polymeric frameworks is one of the most attractive topics. Recently, imidazole dicarboxylate ligands have attracted much attention in preparation of intriguing coordination architectures due to their various bridging conformations [13–32]. To date, a large number of complexes with beautiful structures and desired properties from imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (H3IDC) ligand have been described [13–32]. Prompted by previous findings, people have chose one analogue of H3IDC, 2-propyl-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (H3PIDC) to prepare several coordination polymers [33–37]. However, the reported polymers constructed from the H3PIDC ligand are very limited, especially the main group metal polymers. Moreover, there are no reports concerning the theoretical analysis of the propyl substituent effect in H3PIDC ligand. Herein, we report the hydrothermal syntheses, structural determinations of three complexes, 2D coordination polymer [Sr(H2PIDC)2(H2O)2] n (1), chain coordination polymer [Ba(H2PIDC)2(H2O)3] n (2) and 3D coordination polymer [Pb3(HPIDC)3] n (3). What is more, we calculate the natural bond orbital (NBO) charges of the free ligands H3PIDC and H3IDC, and predict the propyl substituent effect. By doing so, we hope to reveal some structural factors of the ligand H3PIDC for dominating the self-assembly. Single crystal X-ray diffractions reveal that ligand H3PIDC can be formed H2PIDC−, and HPIDC2− anions, and the deprotonated H3− n PIDC n − (n =1–2) can coordinate to metal ions in μ 2 or μ 4 modes (Scheme 1 ). The solid-state fluorescent properties of the three polymers have been investigated also at room temperature. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 The molecular structure of crystalline [Sr(H2PIDC)2(H2O)2] n (1) Single-crystal X-ray analysis shows that compound 1 exhibits a 2D metal–organic framework. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the asymmetric unit of 1 consists of one Sr(II) ion, two H2PIDC− anions and two-coordinated water molecules. Each Sr(II) ion is eight-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms from four individual μ 2-H2PIDC−, and two oxygen atoms from two water molecules showing a dodecahedron geometry (Fig. 4). The Sr–O bond lengths vary from 2.537(2) to 2.667(2)Å, while the Sr–N bond length is 2.719(2)Å. The bond angles around each Sr(II) ion are in the range of 61.91(6)–166.89(7)°. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, each H2PIDC− anion adopts a μ 2-H2PIDC− mode (Scheme 1a) linking neighbor Sr(II) ions in N,O-chelating and O-bridging coordination modes to form a 1D chain. The 2D layer of 1 is generated from 1D chains pillared by μ 2-H2PIDC− ligand (Fig. 1c). Although the reported Sr(II) coordination polymers are mainly constructed by carboxylate ligands [38–42], in which pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid, 5-sulfoisophthalic acid or 5-nitroisophthalic acid were used, there are no Sr(II)-polymers built by imidazole dicarboxylate ligands. To the best of our knowledge, compound 1 is the first example of Sr(II) polymer built by H3PIDC ligand. 2.2 The molecular structure of crystalline [Ba(H2PIDC)2(H2O)3] n (2) Complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P 1 ¯ . The molecular structure of 2 can be viewed as being made up of [Ba(H2PIDC)2(H2O)3] n unit, which exhibits a zigzag infinite chain. As shown in Fig. 2 a, each Ba(II) atom is seven-coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four individual μ 2-H2PIDC−, and three oxygen atoms from three water molecules, and adopts a pentagonal bipyramid geometry (Figs. 2a and 4). The bond lengths of Ba–O from H2PIDC− vary from 2.742 to 2.785Å, while the Ba–O distances from water molecule fall in the range of 2.853–2.878Å. The bond angles around Ba(II) ion vary from 32.42(3)° to 163.74(3)°. Each H2PIDC− anion adopts a μ 2-H2PIDC− mode (Fig. 2b, Scheme 1b), and links neighbor Ba(II) ions to form a 1D chain. The complex 2 exists intermolecular hydrogen bonds. O–H from coordinated water molecule and the oxygen atom of the carboxylate group from another [Ba(H2PIDC)2(H2O)3] n unit form the intermolecular hydrogen bond. The long chains can be formed 3D supramolecular solid-state structure in the role of intermolecular forces (Fig. 2c). Only one example of Ba-polymer built by H3IDC ligand can be found in Ref. [43]. That is to say, compound 2 is the second example of Ba-polymer constructed by imidazole dicarboxylate ligands. 2.3 The molecular structure of crystalline [Pb3(HPIDC)3] n (3) Complex 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/m, which is assembled in a 3D framework. The three crystallographically independent Pb(II) ions (Fig. 3 a) exhibit different coordination environment. Pb(1) is four-coordinated with two oxygen (O1, O1A) and two nitrogen (N1, N1A) atoms from two individual μ 4-HPIDC2− (Scheme 1d) forming a deformed tetrahedron geometry. Pb(2) and Pb(2A) are seven-coordinated by six oxygen (O1, O2, O3, O4, O5, O3A) atoms and one nitrogen (N3) atom from four individual μ 4-HPIDC2− forming a pentagonal bipyramid geometry (Fig. 4 ). The Pb–O distances are ranging from 2.456(4) to 2.758(4)Å and the Pb–N bond length is 2.485(5)Å. The bond angles around each Pb(II) ion vary from 65.19(12)° to 159.8(4)°. In complex 3, each HPIDC2− anion adopts a μ 4-HPIDC2− mode (Scheme 1c), As shown in Fig. 3b, each HPIDC2− anion bridges four Pb(II) atoms in N,O-chelating, O-bridging and O,O-chelating coordination modes to form a 2D layer. The 3D framework of 3 is generated from 2D layers pillared by μ 4-HPIDC2− ligand (Fig. 3c). Although a great number of carboxylate Pb(II) polymers have been prepared, the Pb(II) polymers bearing imidazole dicarboxylate ligands are limited [44,45]. The reported imidazole dicarboxylate-based Pb(II) polymers are mainly built by H3IDC ligand [44,45]. 2.4 Synthesis Recently, we have investigated the ethyl substituent effect of H3EIDC ligand in the hydrothermal preparation process [32]. Herein, we continuously explore the propyl substituent effect in H3PIDC ligand by theoretical calculation [36]. The optimized geometries and NBO charge distributions of the free ligand H3PIDC have been calculated by the B3LYP/6-311++G(d, p) level of theory. The computed results (Scheme 2 and Table 1 ) reveal that the free ligand H3PhIDC has two features: (1) the negative NBO charges mainly distribute on the oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The NBO charges are −0.666 for O1, −0.661 for O6, −0.691 for O2, −0.652 for O13, −0.532 for N7 and −0.498 for N4, in the free ligand H3PIDC (Table 3). Compared with the free ligand H3IDC [38], the NBO charge distributions of O and of N atoms all increase slightly in H3PIDC. These values indicate that the oxygen and nitrogen atoms all have potential coordination ability. (2) The coordination ability of N and O atoms in the H3PIDC ligand is enhanced. This can be confirmed by the calculation result of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies of the free ligands H3IDC (Ehomo =−0.279 a.u.) and H3PIDC (Ehomo =−0.268 a.u.). The HOMO energy of H3PIDC is slightly larger than that of H3IDC. This finding can be confirmed by both previous [33–37] and our present experimental results of polymers 1–3. On the other hand, although the steric effect of the propyl unit in H3PIDC should be given some considerations, three polymeric frameworks 1, 2 and 3 have been successfully obtained. Obviously, the strong coordination ability of the N and O atoms in the ligand overrides the steric effect of the propyl unit. 2.5 IR spectroscopy The main features in the IR spectra of 1–3 mainly concern the carboxylate group, carbonyl group and the imidazole group. Stretching vibration peak of carbonyl group in the free ligand appears at 1692cm−1 [46], stretching vibration peak of the carbonyl group moves to lower wave number after forming coordination polymers. A very strong band appears at around 1660cm−1 due to the antisymmetric stretching (ν as) of the carboxylate group the symmetrical stretching (ν s) band of this group appears at around 1460cm−1, respectively (1: 1673cm−1 and 1465cm−1 2: 1699cm−1 and 1486cm−1 3: 1675cm−1 and 1468cm−1). Stretching vibration peak of ν (N–H) in the free ligand appears at 1505cm−1 (1: 1533cm−1 2: 1486cm−1 3: 1592cm−1). 2.6 Fluorescence spectra The photoluminescent properties of 1–3 and the free ligand H3PIDC were examined in the solid state at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 5 , the free ligand H3PIDC displays a maximum emission at 434nm (λ ex =300nm). Compound 1 shows a sharp strong emission at 441nm (λ ex =360nm). The maximum emission of compound 1 exhibits a red-shift (about 7nm) comparison with the ligand H3PIDC. The emission for compound 1 might be attributed to ligand-to-ligand charge transfer [44]. Compound 2 shows a maximum emission at 389nm (λ ex =280nm), and shows a great blue-shift (about 45nm) comparison with the free ligand H3PIDC. The emission for 2 might be attributed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) [46]. Complex 3 displays broad fluorescent bands at 341 and 465nm (λ ex =352nm). In comparison with the free ligand H3PIDC, the maximum emission of compound 3 at 465nm exhibits a great red-shift (about 31nm). We suppose that the emission of 3 arises from intraligand π–π∗ transition [47] and n–π∗ transition of the ligand H3PIDC. 2.7 Thermogravimetric analysis As shown in Fig. 6 , In the TG curve of 1, three weight-losses are observed. The weight loss of 6.38% between 157 and 266°C corresponds to the loss of the coordinated water molecules (calcd. 6.69%). The framework collapsed in the temperature range of 267–439°C, indicating the release of organic components. The remaining weight may be attributed to the formation of SrO (observed 32.75%, calcd. 33.20%). For polymer 2, there are three weight losses, the first weight loss of 8.04% between 83 and 257°C corresponding to the loss of the coordinated water molecules (calcd. 8.94%). The framework collapsed in the temperature range of 258–540°C, indicating the release of organic components. The remaining weight may be attributed to the formation of BaO (observed 36.46%, calcd. 36.86%). The polymer 3 indicates three steps of weight lost. The first weight loss and the second weight loss of 43.20% between 285 and 489°C correspond to the release of organic components. The remaining weight can be attributed to the formation of PbO (observed 23.64%, calcd. 24.05%). 3 Conclusions Three coordination polymers with 2-propyl-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate ligand have been successfully hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. It is worth emphasizing that the self-assembly reaction of main group metal ions with H3PIDC by hydrothermal way is an effective route for preparation of coordination polymers. The solid state fluorescence properties 1–3 show that the introduction of main group metal ions into the polymers may give some influence of the ligand H3PIDC emission. 4 Experimental 4.1 General details All of other chemicals were commercially available and used as received without further purification. The organic ligand H3PIDC was prepared according to the literature method [48]. The IR spectra were recorded in the 4000–400cm−1 region using KBr pellets and a Nicolet NEXUS 470-FT-IR spectrophotometer. Elemental analyses were determined by a FLASH EA1112 elemental analyzer. Excitation and emission spectra were recorded on a HITACHI F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer, using band pathway of 5nm at room temperature for crystalline samples. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) data were collected on a Netzsch STA 409PC differential thermal analyzer under air atmosphere in the temperature range of 20–650°C with a heating rate of 10°C/h. The optimized geometry, NBO charge distributions and the energies of the frontier molecular orbitals of the free ligand were given by the gaussian 03 suite of programs [36]. And all calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d, p) level of theory. 4.2 Preparation of [Sr(H2PIDC)2(H2O)2] n (1) A mixture of Sr(NO3)2 (63.6mg, 0.3mmol), H3PIDC (59.4mg, 0.3mmol), KOH (33.7mg, 0.6mmol), deionized water (7mL) was stirred, and then it was transferred to and sealed in a 15mL Teflon-lined bomb, which was heated to 152°C for 5days. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10°C/h, colorless block crystals of 1 were obtained in a 68% yield (based on Sr). Anal. Calc. for C16H22N4O11Sr: C, 35.99; H, 4.15; N, 10.49. Found: C, 35.79; H, 4.09, N, 10.20%. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3170 s, 2981 m, 1534 s, 1260 s, 1123 s, 1026 m, 953 w, 842 m, 772 m, 654 m, 508 w. 4.3 Preparation of [Ba(H2PIDC)2(H2O)3] n (2) A mixture of Ba(NO3)2 (52.2mg, 0.2mmol), H3PIDC (39.6mg, 0.2mmol), Et3N (0.13mL), deionized water (7mL) was stirred, and then it was transferred to and sealed in a 15mL Teflon-lined bomb, which was heated to 152°C for 5days. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10°C/h, colorless block crystals of 2 were obtained in a 48% yield (based on Ba). Anal. Calc. for C32H52N8O24Ba2: C, 31.83; H, 4.34; N, 9.28. Found: C, 31.69; H, 4.09; N, 9.39%. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3171 s, 2970 m, 1700 s, 1487 s, 1257 s, 1120 s, 1022 m, 856 s, 785 m, 652 m, 611 w, 514 s. 4.4 Preparation of [Pb3(HPIDC)3] n (3) A mixture of Pb(NO3)2 (33.1mg, 0.1mmol), H3PIDC (19.8mg, 0.1mmol), KOH (11.2mg, 0.2mmol), deionized water (7mL) was stirred, and then it was transferred to and sealed in a 15mL Teflon-lined bomb, which was heated to 152°C for 5days. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10°C/h, colorless block crystals of 3 were obtained in a 42% yield. Anal. Calc. for C24H24N6O12Pb3: C, 23.82; H, 2.00; N, 6.95. Found: C, 24.06; H, 2.13; N, 6.69%. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3267 s, 2959 m, 1593 s, 1260 m, 1109 s, 857 s, 798 s, 679 w, 504 s, 463 w. 4.5 X-ray crystallography Crystal data and experimental details for compounds 1–3 are contained in Table 3. Colorless crystals for 1–3 were put on a Bruker APEX-II CCD diffractometer by using the ω-2θ scan technique at room temperature. The structures were solved primarily by direct method and refined by full-matrix least squares on F 2 using the shelxl-97 software [49]. All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were assigned one common isotropic displacement parameter and included in the final refinement in calculated positions using the riding model approximation by use of geometrical restrains. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2 .
