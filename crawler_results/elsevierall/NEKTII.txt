Graphical abstract Mn(II) and 4,4′-azobis(pyridine) react to form novel ladder structures with benzoate and its p- and m-nitro derivatives, whereas the o-derivative yields a fish-bone chain. Variable-temperature (2–300K) magnetic susceptibility measurements show the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions within the discrete Mn–(OCO)2–Mn dimers for benzoate and its p- and m-nitro derivatives that have been fitted with a S =5/2 dimer model and with a S =5/2 monomer model including a Zero Field Splitting for the o-derivative. Four new manganese(II) coordination polymers: [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(C6H5COO)2](4,4′-azpy)0.5 (1), [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(p-(NO2)C6H4COO)2] (2), [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(m-(NO2)C6H4COO)2] (3) and [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(o-(NO2)C6H4COO)2(H2O)2] (4), where 4,4′-azpy=4,4′-azobis(pyridine), have been synthesized by self-assembly of MnX2 (X=benzoate, p-, m-, or o-nitrobenzoates) together with 4,4′-azpy. All four complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, IR spectroscopy, thermal analyses, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses and variable-temperature magnetic measurements. The structural analyses reveal that complexes 1, 2 and 3 feature a 1D molecular ladder formed by syn–syn (complex 1) or syn–anti (complexes 2 and 3) carboxylate-bridged dimeric Mn(II) units which are joined together by 4,4′-azpy ligands. In complex 1, these ladders assemble with the help of π–π and C–H⋯π interactions to form a nanoporous framework that incorporates non coordinated 4,4′-azpy molecules by exploiting host–guest C–H⋯π and hydrogen bonding interactions. Complex 2 presents a 3D supramolecular framework by π–π and CH⋯π interactions, whereas, complex 3 having a similar ladder structure to 1 and 2, forms a 2D grid through π–π interactions. On the other hand, complex 4 is a 4,4′-azpy bridged fish-bone chain of carboxylate-coordinated mononuclear manganese(II) units, which are linked together by strong hydrogen bonds to form a 2D structure. Variable-temperature (2–300K) magnetic susceptibility measurements show the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions within the discrete Mn–(OCO)2–Mn dimers for complexes 1, 2 and 3 that have been fitted with a S =5/2 dimer model (J =−0.8, −0.5 and −0.4cm−1 respectively). The magnetic data of complex 4 can be reproduced with a S =5/2 monomer model including a Zero Field Splitting (|D|=1.7cm−1). Keywords Manganese(II) 4,4′-Azobis(pyridine) Crystal structure Thermal behavior Magnetic property 1 Introduction The design and synthesis of coordination polymers and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted tremendous interest in the last decade [1–3]. These two kinds of complexes, which are constructed from metal ions and organic linkers, are of special relevance not only because of their potential applications in various fields such as gas storage [4–6], gas separation [7–9], catalysis [10–13], etc. but also for their intriguing structural architectures and topologies [14–16]. A judicious choice of the suitable organic spacer and metal ion can provide the synthetic chemist with some degree of control over the resultant architecture and properties since the network topologies based on molecular building blocks are usually controlled and modified by the coordination geometry of the central metal, the structural chemistry of the organic ligands and the metal to organic ligand ratio [17–20]. As a result, many new systems can be designed in order to explore the important relationship between the different synthetic factors and the structural topologies of the coordination polymers. Among the transition metal ions, manganese-based coordination compounds have received considerable interest in the fields of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering not only for their remarkable magnetochemical properties [21–24], but also for their rich biochemistry [25–27]. Furthermore, due to their low cost and toxicity, manganese coordination compounds are growing in importance as homogeneous catalysts [28–31]. The carboxylate groups, which can display a wide variety of coordination modes such as chelating (Scheme 1 a), terminal (Scheme 1b) and bridging syn–syn (Scheme 1c), anti–anti (Scheme 1d) or syn–anti (Scheme 1e), are one of the most widely used bridging ligands for designing polynuclear complexes with interesting structures and topologies [3]. The magnetic properties of such species are fascinating to the chemists as the number and symmetry of the magnetic orbitals of the metal ion along with their possible overlap through this bridging ligand account for the ferro- or antiferromagnetic nature of the magnetic coupling [32–35]. The neutral and rigid N-donor ligand, 4,4′-azobis(pyridine) (4,4′-azpy) has been widely used to construct supramolecular architectures along with various anionic species that compensate the charge of the resulting metal–organic frameworks [36,37]. The ligand is well-suited for the construction of supramolecular assemblies based on aromatic interactions due to its molecular planarity provided by the π-conjugated system and π-orbitals. However, this spacer has seldom been used to construct manganese(II)-based coordination polymers [38,39] and, in fact, a CCDC search (updated Feb. 2012) shows only nine Mn(II) complexes with the 4,4′-azpy ligand [36,39,40–46] of which only one, recently reported, also contained a carboxylate ligand [46]. This low number contrasts with the more than two hundred examples found with 4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-bpy) instead of 4,4′-azpy [47–49]. Given the interesting increase in the dimensionality (from a 1D ladder to a 2D sheet and a 3D network) that we have recently found in a group of carboxylate-bridged Mn(II) complexes with 4,4′-bpy [49], we have decided to explore the supramolecular structural changes induced by these four benzoate ligands when used with 4,4′-azpy instead of 4,4′-bpy. Thus here we report the synthesis, single crystal X-ray structures and magnetic properties of four new manganese(II) polymers based on the ligand 4,4′-azpy with benzoate and different benzoate derivatives: [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(C6H5COO)2](4,4′-azpy)0.5 (1), [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(p-(NO2)C6H4COO)2] (2), [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(m-(NO2)C6H4COO)2] (3) and [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(o-(NO2)C6H4COO)2(H2O)2] (4). Complexes 1–3 present similar ladder structures where carboxylate bridged Mn(II) dimers are further connected by 4,4′-azpy ligands, albeit, their supramolecular interactions are very different. In complex 4 the carboxylate group is monodentate, leading to the formation of a 4,4′-azpy bridged 1D polymer. The preference for the ladder structure in the present cases seems to be originated from the π–π interactions between the pyridine rings of the two uprights in the ladder. 2 Experimental 2.1 Starting materials All four metal carboxylate salts i.e. Mn(C6H5COO)2·4H2O, Mn(o-(NO2)C6H4COO)2·H2O, Mn(m-(NO2)C6H4COO)2·2H2O and Mn(p-(NO2)C6H4COO)2·4H2O were synthesized by the procedures described previously [50]. All other chemicals purchased were of reagent grade and used without further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of the ligand The 4,4′-azobis(pyridine) (4,4′-azpy) was prepared as an orange solid following the literature method [51] by using 4-aminopyridine and sodium hypochlorite. 2.3 Synthesis of [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(C6H5COO)2](4,4′-azpy)0.5 (1), [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(p-(NO2)C6H4COO)2] (2), [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(m-(NO2)C6H4COO)2] (3) and [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(o-(NO2)C6H4COO)2(H2O)2] (4) A solution of 0.920g (5mmol) of 4,4′-azpy in 10mL of methanol was added drop-wise to a stirred solution of 1.845g (5mmol) of Mn(C6H5COO)2·4H2O in 20mL of methanol. The resulting solution was stirred for ca. half-an-hour and then filtered to remove a small amount of orange precipitate. The dark orange filtrate was left at room temperature. Deep-orange single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained after a few days. Complexes 2, 3 and 4 were obtained by following a similar procedure to that of 1, by using Mn(p-(NO2)C6H4COO)2·4H2O (2.295g, 5mmol), Mn(m-(NO2)C6H4COO)2·2H2O (2.115g, 5mmol), and Mn(o-(NO2)C6H4COO)2·H2O (2.025g, 5mmol), respectively, instead of Mn(C6H5COO)2·4H2O. 2.3.1 Complex 1 Yield: 2.09g; 73%.

IR spectra in KBr (4500–500cm−1) were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer RXI FT-IR spectrophotometer. Thermal analyses (TG-DTA) were carried out on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851 thermal analyzer in a dynamic atmosphere of N2 (flow rate 30cm3 min−1). The samples were heated in an alumina crucible at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. The DC magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out in the temperature range 2–300K with an applied magnetic field of 0.1 T on polycrystalline samples of compounds 1–4 (with masses of 41.81, 25.19, 23.75 and 27.03mg, respectively) with a Quantum Design MPMS-XL-5 SQUID susceptometer. The isothermal magnetizations were performed on the same samples at 2K with magnetic fields up to 5 T. The susceptibility data were corrected for the sample holders previously measured using the same conditions and for the diamagnetic contributions of the salts as deduced by using Pascal´s constant tables (χ dia =−319.89×10−6, −299.83×10−6, −299.83×10−6 and −325.83×10−6 cm3 mol−1 for 1–4, respectively) [52]. 2.5 Crystallographic data collection and refinement 3608, 3597, 3661 independent reflection data for 1, 2 and 4, respectively, were collected at 150(2)K on an Oxford Diffraction X-Calibur CCD System using Cu Kα for 1 and Mo Kα for 2 and 4. The crystals were positioned at 50mm from the CCD. 1464 frames were measured with a counting time of 1s for 1 while 321 frames were measured with a counting time of 10s for 2 and 4. Data analyses were carried out with the CrysAlis program [53]. 3797 independent reflection data for 3 were collected at 293(2)K using a Bruker SMART diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator and Mo Kα radiation. The crystal was positioned at 60mm from the CCD. 360 frames were measured with a counting time of 10s. All four structures were solved using direct methods with the shelxs97 program [54]. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. The hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms were included in geometric positions and given thermal parameters equivalent to 1.2 times those of the atom to which they were attached. The hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atoms in 4 were located in a difference Fourier map and refined with distance constraints. One of the 4,4′-azpy ligands in 4 was disordered over the 2-fold axis and the two possible orientations were refined isotropically with 50% occupancy using distance constraints. In 2 and 3 there was significant positive residual electron density close to the metal atoms. Absorption corrections for 1, 2 and 4 were carried out using the abspack program [55] and for 3 sadabs program [56].The structures were refined on F 2 to R1 0.0743, 0.0685, 0.1202, 0.0917; wR 2 0.1756, 0.1729, 0.3196, 0.2632 for 2803, 2452, 2853, 2179 data with I >2σ(I). Data collection and structure refinement parameters and crystallographic data for the four complexes are given in Table 1 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis The four coordination polymers have been synthesized under the same conditions: the Mn(II) salts of respective acids, Mn(C6H5COO)2·4H2O, Mn(p-(NO2)C6H4COO)2·4H2O, Mn(m-(NO2)C6H4COO)2·2H2O or Mn(o-(NO2)C6H4COO)2·H2O were allowed to react with 4,4′-azpy in methanol solution at ambient temperature in a 1:1M ratio to obtain compounds 1–4 as red crystals. All four compounds were formed by self-assembly of the primary ligands, (benzoate or the corresponding nitrobenzoates) together with 4,4′-azpy as the secondary spacer (Scheme 2 ). Compounds 1, 2 and 3 which are synthesized by using benzoate, p-nitrobenzoate and m-nitrobenzoate, respectively present a 1D ladder structure. However, in compound 1 one 4,4′-azpy ligand is present as an aromatic guest in the pores formed by supramolecular interactions. In compound 4 the ligand o-nitrobenzoate acts as a monodentate ligand and two water molecules complete the hexa-coordination around Mn(II) to generate a 4,4′-azpy bridged linear chain structure. A strong hydrogen-bond between the uncoordinated oxygen atom of the carboxylate and the metal coordinated water molecule may play an important role in stabilizing the structure. 3.2 IR spectra of the complexes The IR spectroscopic data and their assignments are given in the Section 2. The attributions of IR spectra of all the complexes are difficult due to the appearance of several absorption bands from the secondary spacer 4,4′-azpy and the benzoate/nitro-benzoate ligands. Assignments are based on the structures of 1–4 and related complexes previously reported [37]. In the region expected for the ν as(COO−) absorption, compounds 1–3 exhibit two sharp and strong bands at 1642 and 1594cm−1 (for 1), 1653 and 1526cm−1 (for 2) and 1667 and 1519cm−1 (for 3), respectively, attributable to the presence of two different coordination modes of the carboxylate groups in the structures. In contrast, complex 4 shows one single and sharp band at 1526cm−1 indicating the presence of one type of carboxylate group. In addition, the sharp peaks at 1392cm−1 with a shoulder at 1353cm−1 (for 1), 1405cm−1 with a shoulder at 1365cm−1 (for 2), 1388cm−1 with a shoulder at 1361cm−1 (for 3) and 1375cm−1 (for 4) appear due to the characteristic symmetric stretching modes of the carboxylates. In complex 4, a broad band at 3405cm−1 can be assigned to the characteristic stretching mode of water. In the region, expected for the NN stretch vibration, all four compounds exhibit one single, sharp and strong band at 1593cm−1, attributable to the presence of the 4,4′-azpy moiety in all the structures. 3.3 Thermal analyses The thermogravimetric analyses were carried out in air on powder samples of 1–4. In 1, the first endothermic weight loss of 8.01%, corresponding to the departure of a half guest azpy molecule per asymmetric unit (calcd 8.02%), was observed between 190 and 250°C (Fig. S1 of the Supporting information). The coordinated azpy ligand is held more strongly and, consequently, the second endothermic weight loss of 15.97% observed at higher temperature (between 250 and 315°C) is attributable to the loss of the coordinated azpy ligand (calcd 16.04%). After removal of the guest azpy molecule at 250°C, the isolated solid is dissolved in methanol and the crystalline product obtained on slow evaporation of solvent is found to be identical to that of compound 1 as evidenced from elemental analyses. For compounds 2 and 3, the first endothermic weight loss of 15.98% (calcd 16.10%) (for 2) between 260 and 300°C and 15.96% (calcd 16.10%) between 286 and 350°C corresponds to the departure of coordinated azpy (Figs. S2 and S3 of the Supporting information). In spite of having the same molecular structure, compounds 2 and 3 have different supramolecular π⋯π and C–H⋯π interactions which seem to be reflected in different degree of thermal stability of these two species. In compound 4, the first endothermic weight loss of 5.87%, (calcd 5.92%) was observed (Fig. S4 of the Supporting information) between 80 and 105°C and corresponds to the departure of two molecules of water per asymmetric unit. The crystalline sample turns into amorphous powders upon removal of water molecules. In the second step, between 256 and 310°C an endothermic weight loss of 30.31% is observed which corresponds to the loss of one 4,4′-azpy per formula unit (calcd 30.48%). 3.4 Description of structures of the complexes Complex 1 features a one-dimensional coordination polymer with a ladder-like structure as shown in Fig. 1 together with the atomic numbering scheme. The structure contains a basic centrosymmetric dimeric unit [Mn2L4] (where L=C6H5COO−) in which the equatorial plane of both six-co-ordinate Mn(II) ions is formed by the two oxygen atoms (O11 and O13) from one chelating benzoate and two oxygen atoms (O21 and O23′ (′=−x, 2−y, −z)) from two different bridging benzoate ligands. The distorted octahedral coordination sphere is completed by two trans axial nitrogen atoms (N31 and N42″ (″= x +1, y −1+ z)) from two 4,4′-azpy ligands. In addition, there is a non coordinated 4,4′-azpy guest molecule per dimeric [Mn2L4] unit. The Mn–O bond distances to the bridging carboxylates (2.088(4) and 2.141(3)Å) are shorter than those to the chelating one (2.223(3) and 2.294(3)Å) whereas the Mn–N bond distances (2.251(3) and 2.294(3)Å) are longer than the Mn–O ones. The linking of the adjacent dinuclear cores by the trans coordinated 4,4′-azpy ligand forms a 1D molecular ladder that extends along the b-direction with the dimer serving as the rungs and the 4,4′-azpy ligands as the uprights. Selected bond lengths and angles are summarized in Table 2 . The four oxygens in the equatorial plane are approximately coplanar with a r.m.s. deviation of 0.073Å. The Mn(1) ion deviates from this mean plane by 0.047(1)Å. The chelating bidentate benzoate forms a four-membered chelate ring. The bridging mode of the carboxylate group linking the Mn(1) atom to its centrosymmetrically related Mn(1) atom (x, 2−y, −z) to make the dinuclear [Mn2(C6H5CO2)4] core is syn-syn with torsion angles of −72.9(8)° (O23–C22–O21–Mn1) and 2.2(6)° (O21–C22–O23–Mn1). The Mn⋯Mn distance within this dimeric unit is 4.177(2)Å. The two pyridine nitrogens in axial positions subtend an angle of 174.02(15)° and the Mn–N bonds are approximately perpendicular to the equatorial plane. The main distortions from the octahedral geometry are due to the small bite angle 58.15(14)° of the bidentate carboxylate and to the corresponding small trans angles of these oxygen atoms: 150.85(14)° and 148.39(13)°. The C–NN–C link between the pyridine rings shows torsion angles of −7.9(7)°, −177.8(4)° and −16.6(7)o. These 1D ladders are held together by two types of π–π stacking interactions: (i) One involving the pyridine rings of the coordinated 4,4′-azpy ligands that form the uprights of the ladder with a centroid–centroid distance of 3.821(3)Å, a dihedral angle of 10.46° and a slip angle of 13.92° (Fig. 2 ). (ii) A second π–π interaction involving the phenyl rings of the chelating carboxylate group of one ladder and the phenyl ring of the bridging carboxylate group of adjacent ladders with a centroid–centroid distance of 3.902(3)Å, a dihedral angle between the rings of 4.93° and a slip angle of 24.93°. These interactions propagate along a- and c-directions to create an overall 3D supramolecular framework (Fig. 2). This 3D framework is further stabilized by a C–H–π interaction between a hydrogen atom, H(25), of the phenyl ring of the bridging carboxylate of one ladder and a pyridine ring of a 4,4′-azpy moiety of a neighboring ladder. The distance between H(25) and the centroid of the ring is 2.77Å and the C25–H(25)⋯Cg angle is 146°. [Cg =centroid of the phenyl ring]. This nanoporous framework generated by supramolecular interactions incorporate guest 4,4′-azpy molecules with the help of a CH⋯π interaction (Fig. 3 (a)) between the H17 atom of the phenyl ring of the chelating benzoate group of the ladder and a pyridine ring of the guest azpy molecule (the distance H17⋯Cg is 2.73 Å and the C17–H17⋯Cg angle is 136° [Cg=centroid of the phenyl ring].) and a weak hydrogen bond (Fig. 3(b)) between a non coordinated nitrogen atom (N91) of the pyridine ring of the guest 4,4′-azpy molecule and a hydrogen atom (H35) of a pyridine ring of the coordinated 4,4′-azpy ligand (H⋯N=2.62Å, C–H⋯N=141° and C⋯N=3.393(8)Å). The structures of complexes 2 and 3 are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S5, respectively, with the atomic numbering scheme. The coordination environment around the Mn(II) centers and the polymeric structures are equivalent to that found in 1. Thus, compounds 2 and 3 also contain centrosymmetric [Mn2L4] dimers (L=para-nitrobenzoate in 2 and meta-nitrobenzoate in 3) linked by bidentate 4,4′-azpy ligand with Mn⋯Mn distances of 3.891(9)Å (in 2) and 3.897(3)Å (in 3). The torsion angles, (O23–C22–O21–Mn1=−165.17(5)° and O21–C22–O23–Mn1=7.73(4)° for 2 and O21–C22–O23–Mn1=130.08(7)° and O23–C22–O21–Mn1=−1.80(5)° for 3 show that the carboxylate bridges are syn-anti in both compounds in contrast with the syn-syn mode found in 1. As in compound 1, the Mn(II) ions in 2 and 3 present an octahedral environment with an equatorial plane formed by four oxygen atoms: O11, O13, O21 and O23′ (′=1−x, 1−y, 1−z) from two bridging and one chelating carboxylate group. The axial positions are occupied by two nitrogens atoms: N31 and N42″ (″= x +1, y−1, z) from two 4,4′-azpy ligands in axial positions that bridge the dimeric units to form a ladder similar to that found in 1. The main difference with 1 is the absence of any guest 4,4′-azpy molecule in 2 and 3. Bond lengths around the metal ions in 2 and 3 are also similar to those in 1 (see Table 2). As in 1, the four oxygens in the equatorial plane are approximately coplanar with a maximum deviation of 0.019 and 0.010Å, whereas the Mn(II) ion deviates from the equatorial mean plane by 0.006(1) and 0.027(4)Å in 2 and 3, respectively. The axially coordinated pyridine nitrogen atoms form an angle of 175.0(1)° and 174.5(3)° for 2 and 3 respectively and the Mn–N bonds are approximately perpendicular to the equatorial planes in both complexes. As in 1, the main distortions from the octahedral geometry are due to the small bite angles of the bidentate chelating carboxylate ligand (57.8(1)° and 57.5(2)° for 2 and 3, respectively), and to the small trans angles of 145.6(1)° and 144.6(1)° (for 2) and 145.4(3) and 145.6(2)o (for 3). The C–NN–C link between the pyridine rings shows torsion angles of 37.3(5)°, 178.3(3)° and −30.3(5)° in 2 and 22.5(18)°, 179.6(8)° and −19.0(20)° in 3. Although the coordination environment and polymeric structures are similar in compounds 2 and 3, they present different supramolecular frameworks due to the presence of different types of intermolecular interactions. In complex 2, the 1D ladders are held together by face to face π···π stacking interactions formed between the phenyl rings of the chelating carboxylate groups of two neighboring ladders. This π–π stacking leads to a centroid–centroid distance of 3.755(3)Å, a dihedral angle between the rings of 0.00° and a slip angle of 58.48°. In addition to this, slipped π–π stacking interactions are also present between the rings of the bridging carboxylates of adjacent ladders. This second π–π interaction leads to a distance between the centroids of 3.758(2)Å, a dihedral angle of 5.31° and a slip angle of 28.11°. The pyridine rings of the coordinated 4,4′-azpy moieties of the same ladder are also involved in π–π interactions with a distance between centroids of the pyridine rings of 3.700(2)Å, a dihedral angle of 5.31° and a slip angle of 3.16°. All these interactions generate a 3D supramolecular framework as shown in Fig. 5 a. In compound 3 the phenyl rings of the chelating carboxylate groups interact with the symmetry related rings of neighboring ladders by means of π–π interactions with a centroid–centroid distance of 3.713(7)Å, a dihedral angle of 1.61° and a slip angle of 1.50°. A second π–π association is observed between the pyridine rings of the 4,4′-azpy linkers of the same ladder with a centroid–centroid distance of 3.863(3)Å, a dihedral angle of 0.03° and a slip angle of 29.84° leading to a 2D sheet as illustrated in Fig. 5b. Interestingly, in compound 3, no π–π interactions are observed between the phenyl rings of the bridging and chelating carboxylates, unlike in 1 and 2. Although there are more than forty thousand first row transition metal complexes with carboxylate ligands (CCDC search updated to Nov. 2011), the number of polymeric complexes showing a ladder structure is relatively low. If we restrict to Mn(II) then we can find more than two thousand carboxylate complexes and ca. five hundred complexes containing Mn(II) ions connected with double carboxylate bridges, as in compounds 1–3. Albeit, the number of Mn(II) complexes with a ladder structure is quite limited. As far as we know, only three very similar structures, formed by acetate [57] or o-nitro benzoate [49] and 4,4′-bipy, and benzoate and μ2-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl) ethylene [58] have been reported. Among them only the compound which is formed by o-nitro benzoate and 4,4′-bipy has been characterized both structurally and magnetically. Compound 4 presents a fish-bone chain running along the crystallographic b-axis formed by Mn(II) ions connected through 4,4′-azpy bridges as shown in Fig. 6 . The Mn(II) ion is located on a twofold axis and exhibits an octahedral environment formed by two monodentate o-nitrobenzoate ligands and two water molecules in the equatorial plane together with two axial bridging 4,4′-azpy ligands sitting on the twofold axis. The Mn–O bond lengths in the equatorial plane (2.160(3) and 2.164(3)Å) are shorter than the axial Mn–N ones (2.322(3) and 2.330(5)Å) (Table 3 ). The C–NN–C link between the pyridine rings in the 4,4′-azpy ligand shows torsion angles of −12.9(8)°, −178.9(4)° and 3.4(9)°. The hydrogen atom H2 of the coordinated water molecule participates in a moderate intramolecular hydrogen bond to the uncoordinated oxygen atom O(13) of the monodentate o-nitrobenzoate anion (O⋯O=2.703(4)Å, O–H⋯O=130° and H⋯O=2.08Å). The 4,4′-azpy bridged chains further assemble along the c direction with the help of strong hydrogen bonds between the coordinated carboxylate oxygen atom O(11) of one chain and the hydrogen atom H(1) of a coordinated water molecule (O⋯O=2.722(4)Å, O–H⋯O=167° and H⋯O=1.88Å). This last interaction leads to the formation of layers parallel to the bc plane (Fig. 7 ). 3.5 Magnetic properties The thermal variation of the molar magnetic susceptibility per Mn(II) dimer times the temperature (χmT) of complexes 1–3 shows at room temperature a value of ca. 8.5–8.7cm3 Kmol−1 (Fig. 8 ). These values are close to the expected ones (8.75cm3 Kmol−1) for two isolated high spin Mn(II) (S=5/2) ions with g =2. When the temperature is lowered, the three compounds show very similar thermal behaviors: χmT remains almost constant down to ca. 50K and below this temperature it shows a progressive decrease to reach values of ca. 1.5, 2.5 and 3.4cm3 Kmol−1 for 1–3, respectively. This behavior suggests the presence of antiferromagnetic exchange interactions inside the Mn(II) dimer forming the rungs of the ladders. To evaluate the exchange coupling, we have to identify the dominant interaction pathways in the metal–organic framework. Although the structures of compounds 1, 2 and 3 show that in the crystal lattices, dinuclear motifs of Mn(II) with doubly carboxylate bridges are connected with 4,4′-azpy, we can neglect the magnetic coupling through the 4,4′-azpy bridges since the shortest Mn–Mn distance through this 4,4′-azpy bridges is ca. 13.5Å. Therefore, we can assume that the magnetic properties in these compounds correspond to those of the isolated Mn–(OCO)2–Mn dimers. Accordingly, we have used a S =5/2 dimer model to fit the magnetic data of compounds 1–3. This model reproduces very satisfactorily the magnetic properties of compounds 1–3 in the whole temperature range with the following parameters: g =2.018 and J =−0.8cm−1 (for 1); g =2.016 and J =−0.5cm−1 (for 2) and g =2.011 and J =−0.4cm−1 (for 3) (solid lines in Fig. 8). The carboxylate bridged dimeric core present in compounds 1–3 is quite common. Among the μ1,3 carboxylate bridging modes, the syn–anti configuration is less common than the syn–syn one [59,60]. On the basis of the respective geometries, it is expected that a poorly efficient overlap between the 3d magnetic orbital of the Mn2+ center and the 2p orbital of the carboxylate oxygen atom would lead to weak antiferromagnetic interaction through the μ1,3-carboxylate bridging ligand, and its magnitude depends on the coordination mode of the carboxylate ligand. A syn–syn configuration usually provides small metal–metal distances and a better overlap of the magnetic orbitals leading to stronger antiferromagnetic coupling. Syn–anti carboxylato bridges induce smaller J values because of the expanded metallic core and a mismatch in the orientation of the magnetic orbitals [59–61]. This usual trend is followed in the case of the present three complexes as the syn–syn carboxylato bridged compound 1 induces higher J value in comparison to 2 and 3, where the carboxylato bridge is syn–anti. Note, however, that the J values are small in all cases, precluding a more detailed magneto-structural correlation since small structural changes in the carboxylato bridge may play an important role and change the magnitude of the coupling constant. Thus, the relative orientations of the two magnetic orbitals taking part in the super-exchange could be affected by several factors as the Mn–O distance, the O–Mn–O angle (α), and the Mn–O–C angles (β/γ). Small changes in these parameters could also change the overlap through the carboxylate group. Table 4 shows some structural parameters for compounds 1–3 along with those of other analogous double carboxylato-bridged Mn(II) compounds described in the literature. The data of this table suggest that the Mn–O syn distance (in case of syn–syn mode, the shorter Mn–O syn ) and the corresponding Mn–O syn –C angle (β) are the two most important factors controlling the magnitude of the antiferromagnetic coupling. In general, shorter Mn–O syn distance and smaller β favor stronger antiferromagnetic coupling. Thus, the Mn–Osyn distance and the β angle in 2 (2.174(3)Å and 106.7(2)°) are slightly shorter than in 3 (2.182(6)Å and 108.4(5)°) and, accordingly, the J value of complex 2 is slightly greater than that of complex 3, although the differences are too small to extract any conclusion. The thermal variation of the χmT product per Mn(II) ion for compound 4 shows a room temperature value of ca. 4.4cm3 Kmol−1, close to the expected one for an isolated S =5/2 Mn(II) ion. When the temperature is lowered χmT remains constant down to ca. 10K and below this temperature it shows a sharp decrease to reach a value of ca. 3.5cm3 Kmol−1 at 2K (Fig. 8d). Although compound 4 shows chains of Mn(II) ions, the 4,4′-azpy bridge connecting the monomers is very long and, therefore, as observed in compounds 1–3, we can consider that the coupling through this bridge is negligible. Accordingly, we have fit the magnetic data of compound 4 to a simple S =5/2 monomer model with a zero field splitting (ZFS) to account for the sharp decrease observed at low temperatures. This model reproduces very satisfactorily the magnetic properties of this compound in the whole temperature range with g =1.999 and |D|=1.7cm−1. Note that although this D value is within the normal range observed for isolated Mn(II) ions [62], it could include a very weak AF interaction. Finally, the isothermal magnetizations at 2K (Fig. 9 ) show linear behaviors in a large field range, confirming the presence of weak antiferromagnetic couplings. Although saturation is not reached at 5T in all cases, the extrapolated saturation values are close to the expected ones for a Mn(II) dimer (ca. 10μB in 1–3) and a Mn(II) monomer (ca. 5 μB in 4) with g ≈2. 4 Conclusions The reaction of the 4,4′-azpy ligand with Mn(II) together with different benzoato derivatives as co-ligands (benzoate, o-, m- and p-nitrobenzoate) has afforded four different Mn(II) polymers: [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(C6H5COO)2](4,4′-azpy)0.5 (1), [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(p-(NO2)C6H4COO)2] (2), [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(m-(NO2)C6H4COO)2] (3) and [Mn(4,4′-azpy)(o-(NO2)C6H4COO)2(H2O)2] (4). Compounds 1–3 present a quite original structure where the common carboxylate bridges (syn–syn in 1 and syn–anti in 2 and 3) Mn(II) dimers are further connected through 4,4′-azpy ligands to form a ladder-type structure in which the Mn(II) dimers are the rungs and the 4,4′-azpy ligands are the uprights. The formation of this unusual structure is attributed to the presence of two pyridine rings in the 4,4′-azpy ligand that favors intra-ladder π–π interactions. Despite the similarities of the building blocks used in all the cases, compound 4 presents a different structure where the o-nitrobenzoato ligand acts as monodentate and the 4,4′-azpy ligand connects Mn(II) ions to form a linear chain. The steric hindrance due to the proximity of the –NO2 and –COO− groups in the o-nitrobenzoato ligand may be the reason for this different behavior of the o-compared to the m- and p-nitrobenzoato ligands. In fact, in compounds 1–3 the bridging benzoato derivatives are located very close to to the chelating ones and most probably there is not enough space to accommodate the ortho-NO2 group. From the magnetic point of view, the ladder compounds 1–3 behave as S =5/2 Mn(II) dimers with weak antiferromagnetic couplings mediated through the double syn–syn (in 1) and syn–anti (in 2 and 3) carboxylate bridges whereas the linear chain compound 4 behaves as isolated monomers with a ZFS since the coupling through the 4,4′-azpy ligand is negligible.
