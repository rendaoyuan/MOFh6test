Graphical abstract The polynuclear complex [Cu(μ-HCO2)2(3-pyOH)] n (1) shows triatomic methanoate bridges of anti–anti and syn–anti modes, on the other hand [Cu2(μ-HCO2)2(μ-3-pyOH)2(3-pyOH)2(HCO2)2] n (2) reveals only monoatomic methanoate coordination inside the dinuclear moiety and 3-hydroxypyridine connecting these units by semi-coordination. A ferromagnetic interaction is found in both complexes, however it is significantly important only for 1 (2J =9.2cm−1). This interaction takes place via the syn–anti methanoates, due to the magnetic Cu(II) d x 2 - y 2 orbitals on both sides of the bridge. In all the other bridging cases in 1 and 2, the non-magnetic d z 2 orbital is always involved. Two novel polynuclear complexes with methanoate anions and 3-hydroxypyridine ligands [Cu(μ-HCO2)2(3-pyOH)] n (1) and [Cu2(μ-HCO2)2(μ-3-pyOH)2(3-pyOH)2(HCO2)2] n (2), respectively, were synthesized and characterized. The central copper atom in 1 is surrounded by four methanoates and a 3-pyOH molecule, forming a square-pyramidal CuO3NO chromophore. All the methanoates are bidentate and serve as bridges between the adjacent copper ions via syn-anti and anti–anti coordination. The basal square coordination axes are formed by O(syn), N(3-pyOH) (1.974(2), 2.016(2)Å) and O(anti), O(anti) (1.945(2), 1.960(2)Å), while the third O(anti) (2.247(2)Å) is on the top of the pyramid. A ferromagnetic transition with an exchange constant 2J/k B =9.2cm−1 is found for 1 below 20K. This interaction probably takes place through two syn-anti methanoates extended in a chain through the 2D structure. On the other hand, two monoatomic Cu–O–Cu intra-dinuclear asymmetric (1.986(2), 2.415(2)Å) bridges of two methanoates in [Cu2(HCO2)4(3-pyOH)4] (2) are present. An elongated distorted octahedral coordination sphere around each copper(II) atom is completed by an additional monodentate terminal methanoate (1.975(2)Å), two N-coordinated 3-pyOH (2.005(2), 2.002(2)Å) and the third weakly O-coordinated 3-pyOH (2.732(2)Å). Although a shorter Cu⋯Cu distance is noticed in 2 than in 1 (4.690(1)Å 1, 3.442(1)Å 2), much weaker ferromagnetism is found in 2. Keywords 3-Hydroxypyridine Methanoate Copper Ferromagnet Syn Anti 1 Introduction Copper carboxylates are well known to form a variety of structures even with ligands of the same homologous series. Our recent investigations include efforts to find new synthetic routes for the preparation of copper carboxylates with additional N-donor ligands. A choice of ligands with a hydrogen-bonding functionality could lead to the formation of useful inorganic materials with desired physical properties. Some of them may serve also as bioinorganic models, since coordination compounds of the first-row transition metals are known to participate in multiple biological processes involving acid–base and redox reactions. In this sense, complexes of hydroxypyridine are of considerable interest [1,2]. However, only a few coordination compounds of copper(II) carboxylates with 3-hydroxypyridine (3-pyOH) have been structurally characterized so far. A two-dimensional network, linked by inter-molecular hydrogen bonds between trifluoroacetate and 3-pyOH ligands, is present in [Cu(O2CCF3)2(3-pyOH)2(THF)2] [2]. A similar 2D network is also reported for [Cu(O2CCF3)2(3-pyOH)2] n [3], however, 3-pyOH ligands serve as bridges (N, O) and intra-molecular H-bonding is present. Replacement of the carboxylate ligand reveals structurally significantly different compounds. Due to tetradentate bridging oxalates, a 1D zig-zag chain structure of cis-[Cu(μ-ox)(3-pyOH)2] n [4] is formed. On the other hand, acetates coordinate bidentately, as in dinuclear paddle-wheel [Cu2(O2CCH3)4(3-pyOH)2] [5] or in mononuclear [Cu(O2CCH3)2(3-pyOH)2] n [6]. Only one example of 3-pyO, the deprotonated form of 3-pyOH, was found in the literature, in {[Cu(μ-3-pyO)(3-pyO)(3-pyOH)(H2O)]·2H2O} n [1]. For some of these complexes ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic properties were reported, either through the carboxylate group or 3-pyO(H). In this work, we present two novel coordination compounds with methanoate and 3-pyOH ligands. The methanoates show rather rare coordination modes in both cases, playing a distinguishing role in the magnetic properties of both complexes. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis Chemicals were readily available from commercial sources and were used as received without further purification. [Cu(μ-HCO2)2(3-pyOH)] n (1). A mixture of [Cu2(OH)2CO3] (0.33g, 1.5mmol) and 3-pyOH (0.57g, 6.0mmol) in 30mL CH3OH and 3mL HCOOH was refluxed in air for 1h. A small amount of a solid residue was filtered off and the resulting solution was left at 279K for 72h. Light blue crystals of 1 were filtered off and dried in a desiccator over KOH for 24h.

The single crystals of 1 and 2, suitable for X-ray analysis, were obtained by a similar procedure, but at a lower concentration of the starting compounds. 2.2 X-ray structure analysis Details of the crystal data, data collection and refinement parameters for 1 and 2 are listed in Table 1 , and selected distances and angles in Table 2 . The diffraction data were collected on a Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation. The data were processed using denzo [7]. The structures were solved by direct methods using sir97 [8] and refined using xtal3.6 [9] by a full-matrix least-squares procedure based on F. All of the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The positions of the hydrogen atoms for both structures were located using difference Fourier maps. They were refined together with their isotropic displacement parameters for 1. The H-atoms parameters of 2 were not refined. 2.3 Physical measurements The magnetic susceptibility data of powdered polycrystalline samples were measured with a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer, equipped with a 5T magnet. The molar magnetic susceptibility χ M was investigated in the temperature interval between 300 and 2K in a magnetic field strength H =50Oe. The data were corrected for the experimentally determined contribution of the sample holder. Corrections for the diamagnetic response of the compounds, due to closed atomic shells as estimated from the Pascal’s constants, were applied [10]. Metal analysis was carried out electrogravimetrically with Pt electrodes. C,H,N analysis was performed with a Perkin–Elmer, Elemental Analyzer 2400 CHN. Infrared spectra were measured on mineral oil mulls, using a Perkin–Elmer FT-IR 1720X spectrometer. Electronic spectra were recorded as nujol mulls with a Perkin–Elmer UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer Lambda 19. EPR spectra of the powdered samples were recorded by a Bruker ESP-300 spectrometer, operating at X-band at room temperature and at 100K. The values of parameters g were calculated directly from the signal positions in the spectra. 3 Results and discussion The crystal structure analysis of [Cu(μ-HCO2)2(3-pyOH)] n (1) (katena-bis-(μ-methanoato-O,O′)-(3-hydroxypyridine-N)copper(II)) reveals a polynuclear structure of Cu and 3-hydroxypyridine (3-pyOH) moieties (Cu–N 2.016(2)Å) bridged by four methanoates (Fig. 1 ). Due to the symmetry relations, only two different methanoates are in the structure. One coordinates syn-anti (Cu–O21′ 1.974(2), Cu–O22 1.960(2), Cu⋯Cu (4.690(1)Å), while the other anti-anti (Cu–O11 1.945(2), Cu–O12′ 2.247(2), Cu⋯Cu 5.935(1)Å). The coordination sphere around the copper(II) atom is square-pyramidal with N–Cu–O21′ and O11–Cu–O22 coordination axes and O12′ on the top of the pyramid. The methanoate bridges enable a layered structure, while 3-pyOH is involved only in an inter-layer H-bonding network (O41(H41)⋯O12 2.692(2)Å). Two copper(II) atoms in the dinuclear central core of [Cu2(μ-HCO2)2(μ-3-pyOH)2(3-pyOH)2(HCO2)2] n (2) (katena-bis-(μ-3-hydroxypyridine-O,N)-bis-(μ-methanoato-O)-(methanoato-O)-(3-hydroxypyridine-N)dicopper(II)) are connected by two monoatomic non-symmetric methanoate bridges (Cu–O41 1.986(2), Cu′–O41 2.415(2)Å, Cu–O41–Cu′ 102.50(4)°; Fig. 2 ). Two additional monodentate methanoates (Cu–O31 1.975(2)Å) are on the terminal positions of the dinuclear unit, trans to the closer bridging methanoate oxygen atom (O41). Two 3-pyOH ligands are coordinated trans on each copper atom, and thus are perpendicular to the copper–methanoate plane (Cu–N1 2.005(2), Cu–N2 2.002(2)Å) and complete the dinuclear unit. The so far described coordination sphere of 2 is very similar to that reported for [{Cu(tzq)2(HCO2)}2((μ-HCO2)2]·4H2O (tzq=[1,2,3]triazolo[1,5-a]quinoline) [13]. A shorter intra-dinuclear Cu⋯Cu distance in the tzq complex (3.339(2)Å) than in 2 (3.442(1)Å) is likely to be due to a stronger π⋯π interaction (tzq complex: 12πe−/ligand; 2: 6πe−/ligand). The dinuclear units in the tzq complex are inter-molecularly H-bonded by water molecules, while in 2, they are connected by 3-pyOH molecules. Two 3-pyOH molecules, strongly bonded inside one dimer in 2, are thus additionally semi-coordinated to the apical position of the adjacent dimers (Cu–O22′ 2.732(2)Å) forming inter-dinuclear bridges. The hydroxo oxygen atom O22′ coordinates trans to the more distant bridging methanoate atom O41′, completing the elongated Jahn–Teller axis (Fig. 2, Table 2). This inter-dinuclear bridge is additionally strengthened by a strong H-bond between the hydroxo group and the non-coordinated terminal methanoato oxygen atom (O22′(H22′)⋯O32 2.540(2)Å). Such a poly-dinuclear structure shows a 2D network, H-bonded between adjacent layers via non-coordinated oxygen atoms of the bridging methanoates, and those 3-pyOH hydroxo groups not involved in the semi-coordination (O12(H12)⋯O42 2.695(2)Å). Additional stabilization inside the dinuclear units is found in π–π stacking (cg⋯cg 3.878(2)Å, mean interplanar separation 3.537, 3.506Å) of the 3-pyOH rings. The molar magnetic susceptibility χ M of compounds 1 and 2, increases with decreasing temperature, while the product χ M·T is approximately constant in the temperature interval from 300K to 50K, indicating a paramagnetic behaviour (Fig. 3 ) [14]. High temperature susceptibility data χ M (above 50K) were fitted with the Curie–Weiss law: χ M = C/(T − θ). The Curie constant C and the Weiss constant θ are 0.47, 0.92cm3 K/mol and 6.6, 0K for 1 and 2, respectively. Below 50K, χ M T remains almost constant for 2, and only a very weak ferromagnetic interaction is noticed (inset in Fig. 3). On the contrary, χ M T for 1 significantly increases below 20K, and the magnetic susceptibility χ M(M/H) H→0 =14cm3/mol (2K) is much higher than expected for non-interacting S =1/2 spins of CuII. In a small magnetic field strength H, the magnetization M M of 1 linearly increases, however at 1kOe the μ a(H) dependence becomes non-linear and M M saturates at H ∼20kOe (Fig. 4 ). The magnetization saturation is 1.07 μ B per CuII atom, showing that all CuII atoms in the sample contribute to specific magnetic properties of the sample. No hysteresis loop for the μ a(H) dependence was detected. Due to a large increase of χ M below 20K, θ =6.6K, and an “S” shaped curve μ a(H) at 2K with an absence of hysteresis, a soft ferromagnetic behaviour at low temperature for 1 is clearly noticed. Magnetic interactions among non-diluted copper(II) atoms have been described frequently, however mostly for dicopper tetracarboxylates with a strong antiferromagnetic interaction. In those paddle-wheel structures, the carboxylates coordinate bidentately in a syn–syn mode. The coordination sphere is square-pyramidal with the magnetic CuII orbital d x 2 - y 2 oriented towards four bridging carboxylates and the non-magnetic d z 2 towards the apical ligand [15–17]. This agrees with the magnetic interaction between two S =1/2 spins of two CuII always found only inside the dinuclear unit. Although such dinuclear moieties are often connected by various types of bridges, no inter-dinuclear interactions via S =1/2 were confirmed, but sometimes suggested via S =1 joint dinuclear spins (2×CuII) [18,19]. Some evidence for these interactions may be found in the EPR spectra. If less than four carboxylates bridge two CuII atoms, a significant reduction of the magnetic interaction is observed [17,20–22], despite the magnetic d x 2 - y 2 orbitals involved on both sides of the bridge. Theoretically, for the syn-anti carboxylate bridged models [17], a weak ferromagnetic interaction was calculated, while a weak antiferromagnetic for the syn–syn bridge and a moderate antiferromagnetic for the anti–anti models. The reported complexes with the less common syn–anti bridging mode show ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic properties, with small magnitudes of their exchange coupling constants J [23–29]. Generally, the exchange interaction is a combination of two components, negative antiferromagnetic and positive ferromagnetic (J = J AF + J F) [30]. The J AF magnitude is proportional to the square of the overlap integral between the magnetic orbitals centred on the adjacent metal atoms, while for the J F, it is governed by the overlap density between the magnetic orbitals [31]. Polyatomic extended ligands thus reduce the ferromagnetic contribution. The unfavourable overlap of the syn–anti oriented ligand orbitals [23] and non-planarity of the bridging network significantly reduce especially the antiferromagnetic part, to the extent that the ferromagnetic one becomes predominant [27,32]. Such an explanation fits both the herein analyzed compounds 1 and 2. In 1, the anti–anti methanoates (Cu–O11–C1–O12–Cu) connect the non-magnetic d z 2 with the magnetic d x 2 - y 2 CuII orbitals, while the syn–anti type (Cu–O21–C2–O22–Cu) enables the ferromagnetic interaction, since it connects the d x 2 - y 2 magnetic orbitals only (Scheme 1 ). This interaction between the magnetic orbitals is not limited to two Cu atoms, but is extended in a chain, due to two syn–anti bridges from a cis position of each Cu atom to two adjacent Cu atoms (Fig. 1). The syn–anti connected Cu atoms are pushed out of the O–C–O bridge plane by 0.105(1) and 0.398(1)Å, respectively, thus the Cu–O21–C2–O22–Cu skeleton deviates from planarity, in accordance with an absence of an antiferromagnetic interaction in 1. A weak interaction between the nearest CuII neighbours can be treated as a small perturbation added to the Zeeman term: H ^ = - z 2 J S ^ 1 · S ^ 2 , where z is the number of nearest neighbours and 2J is the interaction parameter between them [33,34]. Due to the two magnetically interacting nearest neighbours (z =2) found in the structure of 1, 2J/kB =9.2cm−1 can be calculated (Eq. (1)) (1) 2 J = 3 k B θ zS ( S + 1 ) In the structure of 2, the monoatomic methanoate and the 3-pyOH molecule bridges are present, however they all connect the magnetic d x 2 - y 2 (Cu–O41(equatorial) 1.986(1)Å) and the non-magnetic d z 2 CuII orbitals (Cu′-O41(axial) 2.415 (1)Å) (Scheme 1). Therefore, they do not enable a magnetic interaction of the same magnitude as found in 1 despite the shorter Cu⋯Cu distance (4.690(1)Å 1, 3.442(1)Å 2). Actually, the inset in Fig. 3 shows a very weak ferromagnetism for 2, and the interaction more likely takes place through the methanoates than 3-pyOH due to a shorter length of such bridges. This weak interaction may be possible by some admixture of d z 2 character with the d x 2 - y 2 type of Cu(II) orbital, where the unpaired electron lies primarily. A significant octahedral distortion of the copper coordination sphere in 2 (see Table 2) strongly supports such a theory. A very weak ferromagnetism in 2 and a weak antiferromagnetism in the related [{Cu(tzq)2(HCO2)}2(μ-HCO2)2]·4H2O [13] may be correlated with different distances and almost the same angle in their monoatomic Cu–O–Cu bridges (tzq: 1.950(4), 2.331(4)Å, 102.2(2)°; 2: 1.986(1), 2.415(1)Å, 102.5(2)°). Longer distances in 2 reduce the magnetic orbital overlap, and thus the antiferromagnetic contribution to the extent that ferromagnetism predominates. A numerical analysis to predict the antiferromagnetic or the ferromagnetic properties of dicopper complexes with two monoatomic chlorine bridges has been introduced [22,29]. The higher value ϕ/R (angle Cu–Cl–Cu= ϕ, Cu–Cl axial distance= R) suggests antiferromagnetism, while lower value ferromagnetism. The ϕ/R values 42.4 (2) and 43.8 (tzq) °/Å thus fit with the measured magnetic properties of 2 and the tzq complex. The EPR spectrum of 1 (298K) shows one signal (g =2.150(3)), revealing pseudo isotropic symmetry of the complex and the presence of an isolated paramagnet with S =1/2. Similar was observed for another Cu ferromagnetic complex with a syn–anti carboxylate bridge [27]. On the other hand, two axial symmetry signals (g ∥ =2.257(3), g ⊥ =2.100(3)) are found in the spectrum of 2. Significantly longer Cu–L distances for the z-axis oriented ligands in 2 than in 1 are thus in agreement with the EPR spectra. The spectra of both compounds do not change by decrease of temperature to 100K, and they are consistent with the magnetic susceptibility analysis. A full correlation was not done, due to unavailability of the EPR experiment below 100K. On the other hand, some comparison was done for the structurally related [Cu2(μ-HCO2)2(μ-3-pyOH)2(3-pyOH)2(HCO2)2] n (2) and [{Cu(tzq)2(HCO2)}2(μ-HCO2)2]·4H2O [13]. Different spectra were recorded at room temperature, only two signals (H ∥ and H ⊥) are found for 2, while the ΔM s ±2 resonance and four ΔM s ±1 signals are reported for the tzq complex. These differences are related to the observations described by the magnetic susceptibility analysis. 4 Concluding remarks The coordination compound [Cu(μ-HCO2)2(3-pyOH)] n (1) shows triatomic methanoate bridges of anti–anti and syn–anti mode. On the other hand, [Cu2(μ-HCO2)2(μ-3-pyOH)2(3-pyOH)2(HCO2)2] n (2) reveals only monoatomic methanoate coordination, either to one Cu atom or bridging inside the dinuclear moiety. Additionally, one half of the 3-pyOH molecules also serve as bridges, connecting the adjacent dinuclear units in 2 in a poly-dinuclear network. A ferromagnetic interaction is found in both complexes, however, this is significantly important only for 1 (2J =9.2cm−1). This interaction takes place via the syn–anti methanoates, due to the magnetic Cu(II) d x 2 - y 2 orbitals on both sides of the bridge. In all the other bridging cases in 1 and 2, the non-magnetic d z 2 orbital is always involved. Such a ferromagnetic interaction in 1 is also in agreement with a medium sized length of the triatomic O–C–O syn–anti bridge and non-planarity of its Cu–O–C–O–Cu skeleton.
