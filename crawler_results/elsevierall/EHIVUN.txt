Coordination polymers [Hg(L 2 )Cl2] n (1) and {[Hg2(L 2 )Cl4](DMF)} n (2) have been assembled from Hg(II) chloride and a novel tripyridyltriazole tecton 3,4-bis(2-pyridyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (L 2 ) in different solvent media. Both complexes have been characterized by IR, microanalysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. Single crystal X-ray diffraction indicates that the L 2 ligands take the (η3, μ2) and (η4, μ3) binding modes in 1 and 2, respectively, which connect the Hg(II) centers to afford linear and ladder-like 1D arrays. Interestingly, complex 1 exhibits strong solid state fluorescent emission at room temperature due to the intraligand transitions, whereas complex 2 is non-fluorescent. Graphical abstract This work demonstrates the solvent effect on assemblies, crystal structures, and fluorescent properties of two 1D Hg(II) coordination polymers with a versatile tripyridyltriazole tecton. Keywords Hg(II) coordination polymers Tripyridyltriazole ligands Solvent effect Crystal structures Fluorescent properties As a fertile research focus, the rational design and assembly of coordination polymers has recently attracted significant attention due to their aesthetic network topologies and burgeoning applications as a new type of multifunctional hybrid materials [1–4]. In this regard, the proper combination of the inorganic and organic building components (that is, metal ions and ligands) will basically be responsible for the resulting coordination architectures with desired structures and properties. Notably, in some cases, the reaction conditions such as pH value [5], temperature [6], and solvent [7] may also be critical to form different crystalline products. Recently, triazole and its derivatives have been extensively used to successfully construct a great variety of metal complexes [8]. In this regard, we have performed a systematic investigation of the diverse coordination assemblies based on two bipyridyl-substituted triazole tectons, namely, 4-amino-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole and 4-amino-3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole [9]. Recently, we have developed a new type of tripyridyl-substituted triazole ligands (Scheme 1 ) that have more possible binding modes and conformations upon complexation [10]. On the other hand, Hg(II) complexes are particularly attractive, in part arising from the adjustable coordination numbers and geometries of d10 Hg(II) center [11]. Thus, we will describe in this work two 1D Hg(II) coordination polymers [Hg(L 2 )Cl2] n (1) and {[Hg2(L 2 )Cl4](DMF)} n (2) with a multidentate tripyridyltriazole ligand 3,4-bis(2-pyridyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (L 2 ), which are directed by different solvent media used in the assembled processes. Their thermal stability and fluorescence will also be presented. The ligand L 2 was prepared according to a comparable literature method [12]. Complexes 1 and 2 were obtained by using the conventional metal–ligand assembly in H2O/CH3OH (for 1) or H2O/CH3OH/DMF (for 2), and were characterized by microanalysis and IR spectra [13]. The IR spectrum of 2 displays a very strong absorption peak at 1649cm−1, confirming the presence of DMF molecule. The phase purity of bulk crystalline samples for 1 and 2 was further validated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) technique (see Fig. S1 for PXRD patterns). Both complexes are stable at ambient conditions. Their thermal stability was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments (see Fig. S2 for TGA curves). The TGA result shows that complex 1 is stable up to ca. 176°C, followed by a sharp weight loss that ends at ca. 367°C, and further heating to 800°C indicates a gentle weight loss with no final residue. This observation clearly reveals the decomposition of L 2 ligand and sublimation of HgCl2 upon heating. The TGA curve of 2 indicates that the first weight loss of 8.23% occurs in the temperature range of ca. 133–186°C, corresponding to the release of DMF (calculated: 7.97%). The thermal behavior of the residual species is similar to that of 1, showing a rapid weight loss until ca. 359°C and then, a slow and complete weight loss until the heating ends at 800°C. Single crystal X-ray diffraction [14] reveals that the asymmetric unit of complex 1 is composed of one Hg(II) ion, one L 2 ligand and two terminal chloride anions. The five-coordinated Hg(II) center is surrounded by three nitrogen atoms from one 4-pyridyl group and the chelating pyridyl–triazolyl segment of two L 2 ligands, as well as two chloride anions (see Fig. 1a). Such a HgN3Cl2 coordination sphere can be regarded as a distort square-pyramid with the τ value of 0.23 [15], in which the Hg(II) ion deviates by 0.183Å from the N4A–Cl1–N2–Cl2 basal plane towards the apical N1 donor. The average bond lengths are 2.678Å for Hg–N and 2.345Å for Hg–Cl, being in good agreement with those for other Hg(II) coordination polymers [11]. Each L 2 ligand links two Hg(II) ions using the 4-pyridyl as well as the 3-substituted 2-pyridyl plus the neighboring triazolyl, and the 4-substituted 2-pyridyl is uncoordinated. As a result, the HgII ions are extended by the L 2 ligands to form a 1D linear array along [010] (see Fig. 1b) with the Hg⋅⋅⋅Hg separation being equal to the length of b-axis (11.438Å). The crystal stacking of 1 indicates that two such 1D arrays adopt the inversion disposition, and interchain face-to-face π–π interactions are observed between the parallel 2-pyridyl coordinated groups (red dashed lines in Fig. 1c), with the centroid-to-centroid/centroid-to-plane distance of 3.977/3.360Å. The resulting double-stranded patterns are arranged by a 2-fold symmetry (see Fig. 1c) and no significant secondary interaction is found between them. In the crystal structure of complex 2 [14], the fundamental unit consists of two crystallographically unique Hg(II) centers, one L 2 ligand, four chloride anions, and one DMF molecule. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the Hg1 ion is coordinated by two nitrogen donors from the chelating pyridyl–triazolyl segment of one L 2 and two unidentate chloride anions, whereas the HgN2Cl2 sphere of Hg2 is provided by two nitrogen atoms from one 4-subsitituted 2-pyridyl group and one 4-pyridyl ring of two L 2 ligands as well as two chloride anions. The average Hg–Cl bond distance in 2 is 2.346Å, being almost the same as that in 1. However, the Hg–N bond lengths exhibit a visible difference, that is, 2.800Å for Hg2–N6A and 2.420–2.456Å for others, indicating the adaptable coordination nature of Hg(II) [11]. Additionally, the length of Hg2···O1 is 3.036Å, suggesting a weak interaction between Hg2 and DMF. This can also be properly evaluated by the significantly larger Cl1–Hg2–Cl2 angle (158.0°) in comparison with that of Cl3–Hg1–Cl4 (126.4°). In this case, each L 2 ligand links three Hg(II) centers as a Y-type connector, forming a 1D ladder-like array along the [100] direction (see Fig. 2b). The neighboring Hg⋅⋅⋅Hg distances separated by the L 2 ligand are 8.256Å for Hg2···Hg2 and 10.826/6.471Å for Hg1···Hg2. Notably, face-to-face π–π stacking interactions exist between the 4-pyridyl groups and the chelating 2-pyridyl rings (red dashed lines in Fig. 2b) within the 1D pattern. The centroid-to-centroid and centroid-to-plane distances are 3.584 and 3.483Å, and the dihedral angle is 10.0°. Such 1D arrays adopt a parallel stacking mode with some offset, between which the DMF molecules are located (see Fig. 2c). It should be noted that 2 crystallizes in the acentric P1 space group and the flack parameter is refined to near zero, indicating the correct absolute configuration of this structure [16]. It has been well established that polymeric coordination complexes with d10 metal ions and conjugated ligands may be regarded as promising candidates for potential fluorescent materials. In this connection, fluorescent coordination polymers with Zn(II) and Cd(II) centers have been extensively explored and in contrast, the related reports on Hg(II) species are scarce [17]. Thus, the fluorescent properties of complexes 1 and 2 as well as the free L 2 ligand were investigated in solid state at room temperature. Excitation of the microcrystalline samples at 342nm leads to the generation of fluorescent emissions, with the peak maxima occurring at 488 and 479nm for L 2 and 1 (see Fig. 3 ), respectively. The similar profile and location for both emission peaks reveal that the photoluminescent mechanism of 1 should be ascribed to the intraligand transitions of L 2 . On the other hand, the slight blue-shift (Δλ =9nm) and significant enhancement of the emission peak for 1, in comparison with that of the free L 2 ligand, can be attributed to the metal–ligand coordination effect that will effectively reduce the energy loss [18]. Interestingly, no obvious fluorescence was observed for complex 2 under the same experimental conditions, and this quenching is likely related to the fluorescent decay effect of lattice DMF solvent [18]. From the above results, the role of solvent in regulating the crystal structures and fluorescent properties of the Hg(II) complexes 1 and 2 has been clearly demonstrated. For 1, the Hg(II) centers are linked by the L 2 ligands in (η3, μ2) binding mode to form a 1D linear array, whereas for 2, two types of Hg(II) ions are extended by the (η4, μ3)–L 2 connectors to result in a 1D ladder-like arrangement, due to the intervention of DMF molecules, which also occupy the available voids in the crystalline lattice (104.6Å3, 16.6% per unit cell) and thus stabilize the overall 3D structure. Additionally, different π–π interactions are observed in the structures of 1 and 2 (between and within the 1D coordination motifs). Furthermore, the absence or presence of lattice DMF solvent in 1 and 2 will also be responsible for their different solid state fluorescence. In summary, two distinct Hg(II) coordination polymers with a novel tripyridyltriazole tecton 3,4-bis(2-pyridyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (L 2 ) have been rationally prepared in a controlled manner. This work confirms that the solvent is a key factor to determine the assemblies of coordination polymers with specific structures and functions. These results further urge us to focus on this interesting program, that is, design and synthesis of multifarious crystalline materials based on such versatile multidentate building blocks via appropriate external stimuli.
