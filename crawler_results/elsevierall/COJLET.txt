Keywords Chiral ligand Copper/zinc Crystal structure Photoluminescence 1 Introduction The crystal engineering of coordination polymers based on covalent interactions is an expanding field of research [1]. Crystallization of specifically building blocks combined with modulated fine factors has resulted in a number of new cavity materials [2]. An attractive concept in designing coordination crystals with large pores has been the formation of high dimensional networks. The metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high dimensional channels topology are of particular interest due to their desirable pore size and selective inclusion of guest molecules [2e,2f]. However, the interpenetrating high dimensional coordination polymers have either very small pores or no pores at all. This decreases the potential uses as functional materials. Noninterpenetrating coordination polymers with well-defined large pores are therefore particularly desired. The discovery of noninterpenetrating molecular frames is still serendipitous since the structures were found to depend on several factors such as the nature or ratio of the ligands and the metals, the noncovalent weak interactions, and the presence of guest molecules [3]. It is wellknown a successful organic ligand may store readable information interactive with metal ions including steric hindrance, rigidity, length, binding-sites and especially symmetry [4]. Among various types of spacing ligands, the U-shaped bis(amidopyridyl)ligand, N,N′-(1,2-phenylene)diisonicotinamide(pia), can exist in several different conformations as a result of rotation of the amido unit with respect to the aromatic groups at either end [5]: the chiral C 2-symmetric conformation A , B , the achiral conformation C , or, the chiral conformation with an intramolecular hydrogen bond D (Scheme 1 ). This flexible ligand exhibits special adaptability for coordination requirements and are also capable of forming either macrocyclic or polymeric complexes with IB, IIB metals (Ag(I) [5,6], Au(I) [7], Hg(II) [8], Cu(II) [9]) and the incorporation of both hydrogen bonding groups in the ligand and the weakly binding anions X− (X− =CF3CO2, NO3, CF3SO3, PF6 5) to create a system with potential to form new and interesting network structures. Although pia has been exploited to produce a number of new coordination polymers [5–9], until now the 2D coordination complexes of it are much few and only one example was reported [5]. In this article, we chose CuSO4, ZnSO4 and pia as building blocks to describe the syntheses, structures, the photoluminescence, and thermal properties of two novel 2D noninterpenetrating self-assemblies. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and characterization N,N′-(1,2-phenylene)diisonicotinamide (pia) was synthesized from the published method [8]. Other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used as received. The IR spectrum was recorded on a Shimazu IR435 spectrometer as KBr disk (4000–400cm−1). The solid state fluorescence spectra of pia and complex 2 were recorded using a HITACHIF-4500 (Fluorescence Spectrophotometer) in a 1cm quartz cell. The excitation and emission bandwidths were set at 5nm. The thermal decomposition experiment was carried out using NETZSCH TG 209 instrument in N2 atmosphere at the heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. 2.2 Preparation of [(CuSO4)(pia)·2CH3OH·H2O] n (1) At room temperature, a clear DMF solution (5mL) of pia( 63.7mg, 0.2mmol) was slowly added to a methanol solution (10mL) of CuSO4 ·5H2O (48mg, 0.2mmol) with continuous stirring for 30min and a few deposits appear, then diluted acetic acid was added until the deposits disappear. The solution was filtered and the filtrate was allowed undisturbed for evaporation at ambient temperature. Three weeks later blue block crystals suitable for X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis were collected by filtration and washed with methanol and acetone. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3424 m, 3268 s, 1655 s, 1601 s, 1525 s, 1445 s, 1316 s, 1229 s, 1135 m, 1031 m, 986 m, 841 m, 763 m, 648 m. 2.3 Preparation of [(ZnSO4)(pia)·2H2O] n (2) Compound 2 was obtained by a similar reaction procedure from pia, ZnSO4 in DMF/methanol at ambient temperature. Colorless block crystals were obtained after two weeks. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3074m, 1684s, 1602s, 1552s, 1444s, 1312s, 1225s, 1138m, 1066m, 986m, 849m, 760m, 688m, 657m, 622m. 2.4 Crystal structure determination Crystallographic data for the title compounds were collected at 291(2)K on a Bruker APEX-II area-detector diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.71073Å). Absorption corrections were applied by using sadabs. The structure was solved with direct methods and refined with full-matrix least-squares techniques on F 2 using the shelxtl program package [10]. All of the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were assigned with common isotropic displacement factors and included in the final refinement by using geometrical restrains. Crystal data are summarized in detail in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and bond angles for 1 and 2 are put in Table 2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structure of [(CuSO4)(pia)·2CH3 OH·H2O] n (1) X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the asymmetric unit of 1 contains a Cu atom, a pia ligand, a SO 4 2 - anion, a H2O molecule and two methanol molecules. Each Cu(II) center is bonded to two different molecules of pia and two sulfate anions in a five-coordinate manner (Fig. 1 ). Two pyridine nitrogen atoms from two separate pia and two oxygen atoms from one SO 4 2 - coordinate to the copper(II) center in the base plane, and a oxygen atoms from another SO 4 2 - are located in the axial position of the distorted square pyramidal geometry of the copper(II). The Cu–N bond lengths are 1.989(2) and 1.992(2)Å, which are shorter than those (2.15 and 2.18Å) in the related dimer-based 1D zigzag polymeric complex {pia·[Cu(OAc)2]2} n (3) [9]. The Cu–O distances are 2.00–2.31Å, which are a little longer than that in 3 (ca. 1.97Å). The N–Cu–N and O–Cu–N bond angles vary from 87.26(8)° to 163.55(9)°. The Cu–Cu distance in the dimeric core is 4.52Å, which is also longer than that found in 3 [2.61Å]. In 1 The Cu⋯Cu separations through the same bridging ligand pia have two distances of 9.26 and 9.94Å, while in 3 it is 8.81Å. These variances can be attributed to the difference of copper coordination environment between 1 and 3. Compared with 3 [9], although both copper centers adopt square pyramidal geometry and dimer unit exists in both cases, compound 1 exhibits different coordination features: SO 4 2 - anion is a multidentate group, its adaptability allows two pia as co-ligand coordinating to copper. However, in 3, four methyl groups of OAc− bring enough steric effects, and only one pia was permitted as co-ligand of Cu. Such minor difference from anion, which can be regarded as co-ligand effect [11], generate two distinct structural motifs for 1 and 3. In the bc plane each [Cu2(SO4)2] unit was bridged by four pia ligands and extended to form a 2D puckered layer (Fig. 2 ). Because of the unique features from the dimer units and geometry of the ligand, no particular metal-organic cycles were displayed in the overall interwoven assembly. This noninterpenetrating molecular frame facilitates the occurrence of many irregular inner cavities with sufficient size for the accommodation of H2O and methanol molecules. In 1 both amido junctions of pia (d CO =1.233Å, d N–C(O) =1.335Å) are in a trans configuration. The two amido groups adopt an antiparallel arrangement. The oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the amido junctions are not coordinated to the copper ions but form two intermolecular H-bonds between the NH and CO moieties (N–O distances of 2.93Å) and between the NH and SO 4 2 - moieties (N–O distances of 2.90Å). 3.2 Crystal structure of [(ZnSO4)(pia)·2H2O] n (2) The asymmetric unit of complex 2 contains a pia ligand, a ZnSO4 unit, and three H2O molecules. So to the author’s knowledge, this is the first Zn complex of pia. Each Zn(II) center is bonded to two different molecules of pia and two sulfate anions in a tetrahedron-coordination (Fig. 3 ). The Zn–N bond lengths are 2.022(4) and 2.039(4)Å. The Zn–O distances are 1.923(4) and 1.928(6)Å. The angles around Zn range from 98.2(2)° to 118.1(2)°. In the primary structure the pia ligand and Zn(II) ion form a 30-membered macrocycle [Zn2(pia)2]4+. The macrocyclic cavities are large with a bis(pyridyl) bite distance N(1)⋯N4=8.75Å and intramolecular Zn⋯Zn distance Zn(1)⋯Zn(1B)=11.24Å. Each macrocycle [Zn2(pia)2]4+ contains one ligand in conformation 1 A and one in conformation 1 B. In 2 the macrocycles are connected by two pairs of μ 2 - η 2 - O,O - SO 4 2 - anions and form the two-dimensional polymer [ Zn 2 ( pia ) 2 ( μ 2 - SO 4 2 - ) 4 ] n extending in the bc plane. These planes stack along a direction in ABAB pattern with the interplane distance of 11.33Å, as shown in Fig. 5. The polymer further associate through intermolecular amido-amido hydrogen bonds [N⋯O) 2.77 or 2.80Å] and intramolecular amido-amido hydrogen bonds [N⋯O(1A)) 3.06Å] to give a three-dimensional (3D) network (Fig. 4 ). The channels in the stacked macrocycles are occupied by H2O solvent molecules. Among the available complexes of pia [5–9], the bis(pyridyl) ligand adopts the chiral conformations A and B , and they each associate through hydrogen bonding between amido groups to give the network structures [5]. The intermolecular N–H⋯O⋯C hydrogen bonding between amido groups occurred in the same head-to-tail, ⋯ A ⋯ B ⋯ A ⋯ B ⋯ fashion as observed in the free ligand pia, and so it can be claimed that the solid state structure was partly engineered. It is noteworthy that the structure of 2 contains solvent-filled channels, and it is possible that the solvent H2O plays a role as templates during the network self-assembly process. Certainly, there is a synergy between formation of the complementary ⋯ A ⋯ B ⋯ A ⋯ B ⋯ hydrogen bonds, which stack the primary building block units directly above one another in the final network structure, with the formation of channels which will naturally accommodate solvent molecules [5]. 3.3 The fluorescence properties of 2 The study of luminescent properties of MOFs is of great interest owing to their higher thermal stability than the pure organic ligand and the ability to affect the emission wavelength and intensity of the organic material by metal coordination [12]. Compound 1 shows no photoluminescence, this is the case for Cu2+. In contrast to the fluorescence enhancement behaviour of diamagnetic cation Zn2+, the paramagnetic cation Cu2+ ions often induce in its complexes a fluorescence quenching [13]. The solid-state photoluminescent behaviors of pia and complex 2 are investigated at room temperature. The emission spectra of 2 and free ligand are illustrated in Fig. 5 . Excitation at 245nm leads to broad fluorescence signals with the emission maxima at approximately 390nm for free pia ligand, and 400nm for 2, respectively. In contrast to the free ligand, slight red shifts by 5–10nm and the enhanced fluorescence intensity for complex 2 means that the incorporation of Zn(II) effectively increases the conformational rigidity of ligand and reduces the loss of energy via vibration motions. It can be seen that the emission spectral shape of the zinc complex resemble that of the pia ligand. So the emission of the complex is assigned to the fluorescence from the intraligand emission excited state [14]. 3.4 Thermal analysis Thermal analyses of 1 and 2 were carried out at the heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 in nitrogen atmosphere. TG–DSC curves of 1 and 2 were shown as Figs. 6 and 7 . It is seen from Fig. 6 that with increasing of temperature complex 1 gradually lost lattice water and CH3OH, up to 160°C a peak with heat release appeared, the mass loss was 5%, corresponding to the lost 2NH groups (calc. 5.1%). From 210 to 290°C the second mass loss of 14% was attributed to the benzene group. Next continuous mass loss of 30% may result from the decomposition of two isonicotinic fragments of pia (calc. 36.4%), in which the builtup carbon and possible oxidation might bring error. It is seen from Fig. 7 that with increasing of temperature complex 2 gradually lost lattice water; the first DTG peak appeared at 220°C, exhibiting that 2 possess higher thermal stability than 1. Till 308°C, the mass loss was 13%, corresponding to the lost benzene ring (calc. 14%). From 308 to 769°C the TG–DTG curve exhibits continuous mass loss of 38.5%, which is probably attributed to the decomposition of two isonicotinic amido fragments of pia (calc. 45.7%), in which the buildup carbon might lead to error, taking ZnO as the final product. 4 Conclusion In summary, we design and synthesize two new 2D polymeric complexes containing chiral N-donor ligand, all the solid state structures of them were partly engineered via the chiral feature of pia ligand. By experiment we conclude that the introduction of organic ligands containing chiral features into polymeric system has important influence on the skeletal structure, the photoluminescence and thermal properties. Further studies are under way to design and construct enough polymeric complexes with chiral features and to explore the structure/effect relationships between them. 5 Supplementary material CCDC 606058, 609196 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.
