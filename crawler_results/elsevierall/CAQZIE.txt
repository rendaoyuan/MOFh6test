Tel.: +86 591 83792460; fax: +86 591 83714946 Graphical abstract The tailored hydrothermal reactions between zinc salt, H3btc and bpy ligands yield three coordination networks with different structural motifs: a 3D network with filled channels, twofold interpenetrating large (10,3)-b networks and a 2D layer, respectively. The result demonstrates that pH value plays an important role during the assembly process. By pH-value adjustment, the reactions of zinc salt, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3btc) and 4,4′-bipyridine (bpy) yield three coordination polymers, formulated as [Zn3(btc)2(bpy)(H2O)2] n (1), [Zn(Hbtc)(bpy)(H2O)] n ·3nH2O (2) and [Zn(Hbtc)(bpy)(H2O)] n ·4nH2O (3), respectively. The structure of 1 is a 3D network containing channels filled with bpy ligands. Compound 2 consists of twofold interpenetrating (10,3)-b networks, while compound 3 is a 2D layer structure. The fluorescent studies reveal that they exhibit intense violet luminescence in solid state. Keywords Coordination polymer Hydrogen bonding Hydrothermal synthesis Mixed ligands Zinc (II) complexes 1 Introduction Recently, coordination polymers have attracted considerable attention to chemists owing to their interesting architectures and potential applications in catalysis, non-linear optics, magnetism, and molecular recognition [1,2]. The assembly of pre-selected molecular components represents one approach for ‘bottom-up’ one-pot generation of various architectures. Thus, understanding and controlling the factors which govern the assembly process and structure stability is essential. The factors include pH value, anion type, hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking interaction, interpenetration, inclusion and guest molecule [3]. Linear components such as 4,4′-bipyridine (bpy) are widely used as building blocks lead to many networks with interesting motifs [4,5]. A number of networks containing various motifs based on 120° angular components such as 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3btc) have been constructed [6,7]. Thus, the assembly of linear and 120° angular components is expected to form a variety of interesting structures [8]. In addition, polynuclear d10 metal complexes exhibit not only intriguing architectures but also photoluminescent properties [9]. In view of these, we are particularly concerned with the reaction system of H3btc, bpy and d10 metal salt. It is interesting to obtain different structures from same components through the controlled assembly and further investigate the factors stabilizing the structures. Herein, we report the syntheses and characterizations of three Zn(II) polymeric complexes derived from H3btc and bpy ligands, formulated as [Zn3(btc)2(bpy)(H2O)2] n (1), [Zn(Hbtc)(bpy)(H2O)] n ·3nH2O (2) and [Zn(Hbtc)(bpy)(H2O)] n ·4nH2O (3), respectively. 2 Experimental 2.1 General All reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. The hydrothermal reactions were performed in a 20ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave under autogenous pressure. The IR spectra were recorded as KBr discs on a Magna 750 FT-IR spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out on an elemental analyzer model Vario EL III. Fluorescent analyses were performed on an Edinburgh Instruments analyzer model FL920. 2.2 Syntheses [Zn 3 (btc) 2 (bpy)(H 2 O) 2 ] n ( 1 ).

Empirical absorption corrections were applied using the sadabs program. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares on F 2 using the shelxtl package [10]. All of non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. For 1, hydrogen atoms of water were located from difference Fourier maps, and other hydrogen atoms were located geometrically and treated as riding. For 2, no attempt was made to locate the hydrogen atoms of water. Other hydrogen atoms were located geometrically and treated as riding. For 3, no attempt was made to locate the hydrogen atoms of lattice water. Other hydrogen atoms were located geometrically and treated as riding. The crystallographic data for 1–3 are summarized in Table 1 , and the selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Syntheses H3btc ligand contains three carboxylate groups, which can be completely or partially deprotonated under different pH values and consequently exhibit rich coordination modes. Thus, we carried out the reactions between d10 metal salt, H3btc and bpy under different acidicity. It was observed that insoluble precipitate was obtained if the water solution of precursors was made basic. It may attributed to the fact that H3btc deprotonated completely under basic condition and the polymerization took place too quickly to grow crystals. To overcome this obstacle, the reaction of zinc nitrate, H3btc and bpy was carried out under acidic condition (pH 6), crystalline 1 was obtained. When the parallel reaction was carried out except for lower pH 4, crystals of 2 were isolated. When pH value was further decreased to 2, the similar reaction gave rise to compound 3. From the above results, this reaction system is significantly sensitive to pH value, consisting with the relationship between pH value and the deprotonated degree of carboxylate groups. 3.2 Crystal structures The structure of 1 has a 3D network containing rectangular channels filled with bpy spacers. There are two independent zinc(II) ions in the asymmetric unit, as shown in Fig. 1 . The Zn(1) ion is coordinated by one nitrogen atom from bpy bridge and three oxygen atoms from one coordinated water, one bidentate and one monodentate carboxylate groups of two btc ligands to furnish the distorted tetrahedral geometry. The Zn(2) ion is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from two bidentate and two monodentate carboxylate groups of four btc ligands. The Zn–O bond lengths range over 1.891(4)–2.008(5)Å and the Zn–N bond length is 2.006(4)Å. Zn(II) ions are linked by btc ligands as tetra-connectors (Scheme 1 (a)) to form a 3D channel-like network (Fig. 2 ). The diagonal distance of rectangular channel is 10.4Å, which is the exact distance for N-coordinated bpy bridges. The mean planes of pyridyl rings are vertical with transverse section of the channel (Fig. 3 ). Bpy ligands are arranged in an ABAB manner down the channel. The distance and the dihedral angle between pyridyl rings of adjacent bpy ligands are 7.40Å and 78.1°, respectively. Compound 2 consists of twofold interpenetrating 3D (10,3)-b networks [11]. There is one Zn(II) ion, one partially deprotonated btc ligand, one bpy bridge and three lattice water molecules. Each Zn(II) ion is coordinated by one nitrogen atom from bpy ligand and three oxygen atoms from one coordinated water, two monodentate carboxylate groups of two btc ligands in a distorted tetrahedral geometry (Fig. 4 ). The Zn–O bond lengths range over 1.913(7)–2.077(8)Å and the Zn–N bond length is 2.025(8)Å. Each btc ligand contains two monodentated and one protonated carboxylate groups (Scheme 1(b)). The protonated carboxylate oxygen atom forms hydrogen bond with bpy pyridyl nitrogen atom ( O 4 – H ⋯ N 2 i 2.593Å; symmetry code: (i) x −1/2, −y +3/2, z +1/2). Bpy ligand is distorted with a dihedral angle of 11.0° between two pyridyl rings. Furthermore, btc and bpy ligands are not coplanar with the dihedral angle of 20.4° between the btc phenyl ring (C14⋯C19) and the bpy pyridyl ring (C4⋯C8). Five Zn(II) ions are linked by five btc ligands and four bpy bridges through Zn–O, Zn–N and hydrogen bonds to generate a large ring of ca. 36.4×9.51Å2 (Fig. 5 ). The large rings are extended through edge sharing resulting in a 3D (10,3)-b network containing large cavities 52.5×9.51×7.86Å3 (Scheme 2 (a)), where the Zn(II) ions act as three-connected nodes [N1–Zn–O6A 103.9(3)°, O6A–Zn–O1 119.5(3)°, O1–Zn–N1 127.9(3)°]. To our knowledge, the above cavity represents the largest (10,3)-b metal-organic network. To increase the stability of the packing structure with large cavities, two identical (10,3)-b networks adopt interpenetrating manner, resulting in a 3D supramolecular architecture containing the practical 17.0×8.68Å2 cavities (Scheme 2(b)), filled with lattice water molecules as guests (Fig. 6 ) [2d]. In 3, there is one Zn(II) ion, one partially deprotonated btc ligand, one bpy bridge, one coordinated water and four lattice water molecules. The Zn(II) ion is coordinated by one nitrogen atom from bpy ligand and three oxygen atoms from one coordinated water, two monodentate carboxylate groups of two btc ligands to furnish a distorted tetrahedral geometry, as shown in Fig. 7 . The Zn–O bond lengths range over 1.918(4)–2.074(6)Å and the Zn–N bond length is 2.026(5)Å. btc ligands adopt the same coordination mode (Scheme 1(b)) in comparison with 2. The carboxylate oxygen atom also forms hydrogen bond with pyridyl nitrogen atom ( O 4 – H ⋯ N 2 i 2.592Å; symmetry code: (i) x −1/2, −y +1/2, z −1/2). Bpy pyridyl rings are non-coplanar with the dihedral angle of 11.8°, being similar to that in 2. However, btc and bpy ligands are almost coplanar with the dihedral angle being 1.3°, which is quite different from that in 2 (being 20.4°). Thus, only three Zn(II) ions are linked by three btc ligands and two bpy ligands via Zn–O, Zn–N and hydrogen bonds resulting in a smaller 19.0×9.54Å2ring (Fig. 8 ). Extension of this ring through co-edge yields a 2D layer parallel to [101] plane. The 2D layers are stacked in an ABAB manner along the c axis. The face-to-face distances between interlayer pyridyl rings (or pyridyl ring and benzene ring) are 3.444 (or 3.552)Å, indicating the existence of π–π stacking interactions between adjacent layers (Fig. 9 ). Furthermore, hydrogen bonds are formed among coordinated water oxygen atom, carboxylate oxygen atom and lattice water oxygen atom ( O 7 – H ⋯ O 2 i 2.706Å; O 3 - H ⋯ O 10 ii 2.757Å; O 4 – H ⋯ O 9 iii 2.907Å; symmetry codes: (i) −x +1/2, y −1/2, −z +1/2; (ii) −x, y, −z −1/2; (iii) x, y −1, z). The stack of layers is consolidated by π–π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds, resulting in a 3D supramolecular architecture containing cavities for water guests (Fig. 10 ). 3.3 Fluorescent properties The solid-state luminescent spectra of 1–3 and bpy at room temperature are depicted in Fig. 11 . Upon excitation at 330nm, compounds 1–3 exhibit intense photoluminescences with the emission maxima at 365, 373 and 371nm, respectively. However, free bpy molecule exhibits weak photoluminescence with the emission maximum at 401nm. The similar emissions of 1–3 would be assigned to the intraligand emission from the bpy ligand [12]. The enhancement and blue-shift (from 401 to 370nm) of the emission of bpy ligand is attributed to coordination linkage and hydrogen bonding, which increases the rigidity of the bpy ligand and reduces the loss of energy by radiationless decay of the intraligand emission excited state [13,14]. The emission of 1 is slightly more intense than those of 2 and 3, this is consistent with the fact that bpy ligands in 1 are completely bonded by more rigid coordination linkage. Complexes 1–3 are insoluble in common solvents arising from their polymeric structures. Thus, they may be potential candidates for photoactive materials. 4 Conclusion The tailored hydrothermal reactions between zinc salt, H3btc and bpy yield coordination networks 1–3 containing different structural motifs: the 3D network with filled channels, twofold interpenetrating large (10, 3)-b networks and the 2D layer, respectively. pH value plays an important role during the assembly process of the same precursors. With pH value decreasing, the interactions in the networks change from single coordinate bonds to both coordinate and hydrogen bonds [15]. Furthermore, the above result demonstrates that the stable elements in supramolecular architectures, such as guest molecule, hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking interaction and interpenetration, can cooperate harmoniously to meet the demand of structural packing.
