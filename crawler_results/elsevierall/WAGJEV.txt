Three new zinc(II) complexes constructed by biphenyl-2,2′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acid: Effect of solvents and terminal ligands Lin Cheng Shaohua Gou ∗ Liming Zhang School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 211189, China ∗ Corresponding author. Interaction of biphenyl-2,2′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acid (H4bta) and Zn(II) ions in DMF led to the formation of a one-dimensional coordination polymer, while in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline and 1H,1′H-2,2′-biimidazole as terminal ligands in H2O, analogous interactions induced the generation of two-dimensional layers with (6, 3) topology. The bta ligands in these three coordination polymers adopt η4,μ2-tetradentate, η5,μ4-pentadentate and η4,μ4-tetradentate coordination modes, respectively, and the corresponding angles of two benzene rings of bta ligands are 70.52, 83.81 and 73.35°, in accordance with the coordination modes and steric hindrance effect of the terminal ligands. Graphical abstract Keywords Biphenyl-2,2′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acid Zinc(II) complex (6, 3) topology Terminal ligand 1 Introduction The self-assembled construction of coordination polymers is of current interest in the field of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering owing to their potential applications as functional materials, as well as their intriguing variety of architectures and molecular topologies [1,2]. Polycarboxylate ligands, such as 1,2-benzenedicarboxylate [3], 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate [4], and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate [5], have been extensively employed in the preparation of such coordination polymers in possession of multidimensional networks and interesting properties. In contrast, the biphenyl-2,2′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acid (H4bta) ligand (Scheme 1 ), as a member of multidentate O-donor ligands, is rarely used [6]. However, its following structure features inspire our research interests: (a) it has four carboxylic groups that may be completely or partially deprotonated, upon the pH; (b) it is a flexible ligand, since two phenyl rings can be rotated around the C–C single bond; (c) the ligand can be used to construct chiral coordination polymers due to the non-coplanarity of two phenyl rings. Furthermore, it is well-known that self-assembly process is highly affected by several factors such as the ligand’s nature, mediums, templates, metal–ligand ratios, pH values, counterions, solvents and additional ligands [7]. Phen (1,10-phenanthroline) and H2biim (1H,1′H-2,2′-biimidazole) have been always used to construct new coordination polymers as the additional ligands that are coordinated to metal ions as terminal ligands due to their effective π⋯π stacking and/or hydrogen-bonding effect. To investigate the influence of solvents and terminal ligands [phen and H2biim] in the assembly processes of the H4bta ligand and metal ions as well as the framework structures of their complexes, we synthesized three zinc(II) complexes, namely, [Zn(bta)(H2NMe2)2] n (1), [Zn2(bta)(phen)2(H2O)] n (2) and {[Zn2(bta)(H2biim)2(H2O)].H2O} n (3) (H4bta=biphenyl-2,2′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acid, phen=1,10-phenanthroline and H2biim=1H,1′H-2,2′-biimidazole). X-ray single-crystal diffraction study indicated that 1 is a one-dimensional chain, while 2 and 3 are both two-dimensional layers with (6, 3) topology. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials and measurements All solvents and reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. H4bta was prepared in the same manner as reported previously [8]. C, H and N microanalyses were performed on a Perkin–Elmer 1400C analyzer. Infrared spectra (4000–400cm−1) were measured with a Bruker Vector 22 FT-IR spectrophotometer on KBr disks. 2.2 Preparation of complexes 2.2.1 [Zn(bta)(H2NMe2)2] n (1) A mixture of H4bta (0.066g, 0.2mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.118g, 0.4mmol), NEt3 (0.4mL), and DMF (10mL) was heated in a 25-mL Teflon-lined vessel at 180°C for 3 days, followed by slow cooling (5°Ch−1) to room temperature. After filtration and washing with H2O, colorless block crystals were collected and dried in air (0.058g, yield ca. 12% based on H4bta). Anal. Calcd (%) for C20H22N2O8Zn: C, 49.65; H, 4.58; N, 5.79.

After filtration and washing with H2O, colorless block crystals were collected and dried in air (0.459g, yield ca. 55% based on H4bta). Anal. Calcd. for C40H24N4O9Zn2: C, 57.50; H, 2.90; N, 6.71. Found: C, 57.35; H, 3.24; N, 6.29%.

Yield: 46% (0.319g). Anal. Calcd. for C28H22N8O10Zn2: C, 44.17; H, 2.91; N, 14.72. Found: C, 44.59; H, 3.36; N, 14.38%. Main IR (KBr, cm−1): 3399(b), 3054(w), 1569(s), 1516(m), 1458(w), 1425(m), 1372(b), 1143(w), 1101(w), 848(m), 774(w), 725(m), 706(w), 639(w). 2.3 X-ray crystallography Diffraction intensities for all the compounds were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer (MoKα, λ 0.71073Å). Absorption corrections were applied by using multiscan program SADABS [9]. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined with full-matrix least-squares technique with the SHELXTL program package [10]. Anisotropic thermal parameters were applied to all the non-hydrogen atoms. The organic hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically (C–H 0.96Å); the hydrogen atoms of aqua and secondary amines were located from difference maps and refined with isotropic temperature factors. The crystallographic data and selected bonds length and angles are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . Selected hydrogen-bond distances and bond angles are listed in Table 3 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and spectral characterization 1 was synthesized in DMF, while 2 and 3 were obtained with H2O via a similar way. Interestingly, 1 is a one-dimensional chain, in which H2NMe2 maybe come from the decomposition of DMF as counterions at the high temperature under solvothermal conditions [11]. However, both 2 and 3 are two-dimensional layers with (6, 3) topology in the presence of additional ligands. Infrared spectra of 1–3 display middle peaks characteristic of the CO stretching vibration of carboxylate in the 1603–1569cm−1 region [12]. In the 1315–1516cm−1 region, the absorption bands are in accordance with the skeletal vibrations of aromatic and heterocyclic rings for these complexes [12]. 3.2 X-ray crystallographic studies of complexes 3.2.1 [Zn(bta)(H2NMe2)2] n (1) Single-crystal XRD study has revealed that [Zn(bta)(H2NMe2)2] (1) crystallizes in an orthorhombic system with acentric space group Pna21. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one bta ligand, one Zn(II) ion and two in situ generated H2NMe2 cations. Each Zn(II) ion is surrounded by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from two bta ligands, forming a slightly distorted tetrahedron (Fig. 1a). The average Zn–O bond distance of ZnO4 tetrahedron is 1.952Å, comparable with those in the Zn(II) compounds coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms (1.949–1.962Å) [13], and the angles of O–Zn–O are between 95.45(11) and 121.56(11)°. The bta ligand acts in the η4,μ2-tetradentate fashion in 1 (Fig. 2a), bridging the tetrahedral Zn(II) ions in the bischelating fashion into a one-dimensional chain running along the crystallographic a axis with the shortest Zn⋯Zn distance of 6.639Å, as shown in Fig. 3a. It is noted that the angle of two benzene rings in a ligand is 70.52°. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 3b, complex 1 is joined into a 3D supramolecular network together via N–H⋯O hydrogen-bonds (N1⋯O4 2.850(4), N1⋯O1j 2.854(5), N2⋯O7c 2.826(5) and N2⋯O6o 2.767(4)Å, symmetry code: j, x, 1+ y, z; c, 1/2+ x, 1/2− y, z; o, 1− x, 1− y, 1/2+ z) between the bta anions and the free H2NMe2 cations, in which each bta anion acts as four hydrogen-bond acceptors with two coordinated and two uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms, while each H2NMe2 cation serves as double hydrogen-bond donors. Meanwhile, each bta anion is hydrogen bonded to four H2NMe2 cations, and each H2NMe2 cation links two bta anions, coming from two adjacent one-dimensional chains. 3.2.2 [Zn2(bta)(phen)2(H2O)] n (2) Compound 2 crystallizes in a triclinic system of space group P21/c. The asymmetric unit of 2 contains two crystallographically independent Zn(II), one bta ligand, two phen ligands and one coordinated water molecule. As shown in Fig. 1b, Zn1 displays a slightly distorted tetragonal pyramidal geometry, being surrounded by two carboxylate oxygen atoms [Zn1–O4 1.954(2) and Zn1–O7a 2.025(2)Å, symmetry code: a, x, −1+ y, z] from two bta ligands, as well as by one chelating phen [Zn1–N1 2.148(2) and Zn1–N2 2.114(2)Å] and one water molecule [Zn1–O1w 2.207(2)Å]. Zn2 also adopts a N2O3 geometry, being coordinated by one chelating and one monodentate carboxylates [Zn2–O1 2.142(2), Zn2–O2 2.146(2) and Zn2–O6b 1.959(2)Å, symmetry code: b, −1/2+ x, 1/2− y, z] from two bta ligands, as well as one chelating phen ligand [Zn2–N3 2.113(2) and Zn2–N4 2.080(2)Å]. On the other hand, each bta ligand is coordinated to two Zn1 and two Zn2 atoms in a η5,μ4-pentadentate (three-monodentate and one-chelating) mode (Fig. 2b). In a bta anion, the angle of two benzene rings is 83.81°. As shown in Figs. 1b and 4a, Zn1 and Zn2 are coordinated by phen/H2O and phen, respectively, resulting in two kinds of nodes: [Zn(phen)(H2O)] and [Zn(phen)]. Two bta ligands link two [Zn(phen)(H2O)] nodes to build a binuclear [Zn2(bta)(phen)2(H2O)2] unit with the Zn1⋯Zn1 distance of 4.921Å, which is connected to four adjacent units by four [Zn(phen)] nodes with four naked carboxylate oxygen atoms of [Zn2(bta)(phen)2(H2O)2] unit. Four Zn2 atoms in the four [Zn(phen)] nodes linked by a binuclear unit are coplanar and form a Zn4 parallelogram with the Zn2⋯Zn2 distance of 15.751 and 6.931Å, and the Zn–Zn–Zn angle of 87.04 and 92.96°, respectively. Meanwhile, two binuclear [Zn2(bta)(phen)2(H2O)2] units are joined into a [Zn8(bta)6(phen)8(H2O)4] (Zn8) metallocycle by four [Zn(phen)] nodes and two bta ligands. Each Zn8 metallocycle is connected to two adjacent metallocycles by sharing their binuclear [Zn2(bta)(phen)2(H2O)2] units and four adjacent metallocycles by sharing their edges, being built by one [Zn(phen)] node and two bta ligands, resulting in a two-dimensional (2D) layer along the ab plane (Fig. 4a). From the topological point of view, each binuclear [Zn2(bta)(phen)2(H2O)2] unit can be considered as a two-connecting node, which is connected by four bridging [Zn(phen)(H2O)] nodes as two-connecting linkers. Consequently, the 2D network can be regarded as a (6, 3) structure, as shown in Fig. 4b. The 2D layers are further constructed into a 3D supramolecular structure by effective π⋯π stacking between the interlayer adjacent phen rings with the centroid–centriod separation of 4.498Å. 3.2.3 {[Zn2(bta)(H2biim)2(H2O)].H2O} n (3) By replacing phen with H2biim, {[Zn2(bta)(H2biim)2(H2O)].H2O} n (3) was obtained. 3 also crystallizes in a triclinic system of space group P21/c consisting of two crystallographically independent Zn(II), one bta ligand, two H2biim ligands and one coordinated water molecule, as well as one free water molecule in an asymmetric unit. Just like that in 2 (Fig. 1c), Zn1 in 3 also displays a slightly distorted tetragonal pyramidal geometry, being surrounded by two carboxylate oxygen atoms [Zn1–O1 1.971(2) and Zn1–O6a 2.048(2)Å, symmetry code: a, 1− x, −y, −z] from two bta ligands and one chelating H2biim [Zn1–N1 2.134(2) and Zn1–N2 2.109(3)Å], as well as one water molecule [Zn1–O1w 2.204(2)]. The bond angles are in the range of 79.11(9)–163.84(9)°. However, the coordination environment of Zn2 in 3, different from that in 2, is a slightly distorted tetrahedron, being coordinated by two monodentate carboxylates [Zn2–O7 1.953(2) and Zn2–O3b 1.936(2)Å, symmetry code: b, 2− x, −1/2+ y, 1/2− z] from two bta ligands and one chelating H2biim ligand [Zn2–N5 2.040(2) and Zn2–N6 2.048(2)Å]. Meanwhile, each bta ligand in 3 is coordinated to two Zn1 and two Zn2 ions, the same as that in 2, but in a η4,μ4-tetradentate (four-monodentate) mode, which is different from that in 2, as shown in Fig. 2c. In a bta anion, the angle of two benzene rings is 73.35°. Though Zn2 and bta ligands in 3 have different coordination modes from those in 2, 3 has a similar two-dimensional structure to 2, being constructed by each [Zn8(bta)6(H2biim)8(H2O)4] (Zn8) metallocycle linking six adjacent Zn8 metallocycles by sharing its two acmes and four edges (Fig. 5 ). The acme is built of binuclear [Zn2(bta)(H2biim)2(H2O)2] unit, in which the Zn1⋯Zn1 distance is 4.720Å, a little shorter than that in 2 (4.921Å); while the edge is constituted by one [Zn(H2biim)] node and two bta ligands. Meanwhile, four Zn2 atoms in the four [Zn(H2biim)] nodes linked by a binuclear [Zn2(bta)(H2biim)2(H2O)2] unit are coplanar and form a Zn4 parallelogram with the Zn2⋯Zn2 distances of 18.003 and 5.499Å, as well as the Zn–Zn–Zn angles of 88.27 and 91.76°. The 2D network can be regarded as a (6, 3) structure, by considering each binuclear [Zn2(bta)(H2biim)2(H2O)2] unit and [Zn(H2biim)(H2O)] node as a two-connecting node and linker, respectively. It is noted that there are “empty” spaces in the 2D network, which are filled with free water molecules. These crystal water molecules are stabilized in the apertures of this 2D construction by the hydrogen-bonds, which involves the water molecules and the carboxylate oxygen atoms [O2w⋯O2 2.803(7)Å] from bta anions. Additionally, complex 3 is joined into a 3D supramolecular network together via N-H⋯O hydrogen-bonds (N3⋯O5j 2.909(3), N4⋯O5j 2.779(3), N7⋯O8f 2.742(4), N8⋯O3f 2.936(4) and N8⋯O8f 3.052(3)Å, symmetry code: j, x, −1+ y, z; f, 2−x, −y, −z) between bta anions and H2biim ligands. The 3D supramolecular structure is further stabled by effective π⋯π stacking between the heterocycles with the centroid–centriod separation of 3.662Å. 3.3 Influences of solvents and terminal ligands on the crystal structures All compounds were obtained by the interaction of H4bta and Zn(NO3)2 at 180°C under solvothermal conditions, in which 1 was prepared in DMF, while 2 and 3 were synthesized with phen and H2biim, respectively, in H2O. 1 is a one-dimensional chain, in which H2NMe2 maybe come from the decomposition of DMF under solvothermal conditions, while 2 and 3 are both two-dimensional layers with (6, 3) topology. Meanwhile, in 2 and 3, the coordination modes of Zn(II) and bta ligands are different, as well as the interlayer weak interactions are also different, in which there are H-bonding and π⋯π stacking interactions in 3 and only π⋯π stacking interactions in 2, due to the effect of different terminal ligands. Moreover, the angle between two benzene rings of bta ligands in 1 is 70.52°, being shorter than those in 2 and 3, which may be attributed that the bischelating coordination mode of bta in 1 makes the two benzene rings more coplanar. On the other hand, the corresponding angle (83.81°) in 2 is larger than that (73.35°) in 3, due to the larger steric hindrance of phen than H2biim. 4 Conclusions In this study, three new complexes with different architectures, [Zn(bta)(H2NMe2)2] n (1), [Zn2(bta)(phen)2(H2O)] n (2) and {[Zn2(bta)(H2biim)2(H2O)].H2O} n (3) were constructed from H4bta and Zn(II) ions, in which 1 is a one-dimensional chain, while 2 and 3 are both two-dimensional layers with (6, 3) topology. The present study demonstrates that solvents and the nature of terminal ligands are suggested to be crucial factors for the formation of the structures.
