Keywords Heterometallic coordination polymers Zero valent metal precursor Pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylate complexes EPR Luminesance 1 Introduction The reasons for combining metal ions and organic ligands into supramolecular coordination networks are countless, they give access to structural diversity and properties likewise small molecule adsorbsion, spectroscopic and magnetic properties, conductivity and catalytic activity that are less common in organic solids [1–5]. Although some highly important coordination polymers have emerged recently, the majority of them are not water soluble. Water-solubility is a very important characteristic of the some field such as electrochemistry, and medical purposes [6–8]. Self-assembly of weaker intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonds not only are a vital process in the formation of biological architectures but also they are capable of create large complex units into desirable motifs [9–12]. Heterometallic coordination polymers formed by metallic building blocks with different chemical nature (such as alkali metals and transitions metals) are interesting due to their diverse structural functionality [13–18]. It is known that coordination polymers can be synthesized starting from zerovalent metals and this strategy was successfully used to prepare a good deal of heterometallic coordination compounds [17,19–24]. For the formation of a heterometallic or homometallic polynuclear complexes in the presence of polydentate ligands is required as well as the presence of zerovalent metals. Heterocyclic aromatic multicarboxylic acids such as pyridinedicarboxylic acids, are widely exploited to construct polynuclear coordination polymers due to existence of both nitrogen and oxygen atoms [25,26]. Pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid ligand has proved to be versatile ligands and exhibit various coordination modes to furnish various structures with higher dimensionality (Scheme 1) [26–29]. Imidazole ligands with binding capabilities arising from the nitrogen atom for coordination to a metal atom, the N–H group for hydrogen bonding, and the planar aromatic ring for other intermolecular forces have been successfully employed for the construction of supramolecular assemblies with various structures. 4(5)-Methylimidazole and 3(5)-methylpyrazole ligands can exhibit linkage isomerism phenomenon (Scheme 2) [30–32]. The preference of one or another coordination mode of methyl containing imidazole or pyrazole ligands depends on a relative basicity of the N atoms in the ring and steric factors imposed by the methyl groups. There are many studies in the literature about 4(5)-methylimidazole complexes, but 4-methylimidazole complexes have been rarely observed [33–36]. Furthermore our group described the crystal structure of two complex, which accommodates two binding modes of the 4(5)-methylimidazole ligand in same coordination sphere, which is a very unique example of the linkage isomers namely, [Zn(4-mim)2(5-mim)2]sq·3H2O and [Cd(pzdc)(4-mim)(5-mim)2]·1/2H2O [30,31] ( Scheme 2). The goal of the present work is the synthesis and spectroscopic, thermal studies (TG, DTG and DTA) and crystal structure of two new coordination polymer of pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid prepared from zerovalent metal. In heterometallic complex of 1 exhibits a 3D sandwich-like framework. The complex 2 is an example containing steric hindranced 4-methylimidazole selected as secondary ligand. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and physical measurements All chemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased commercially. The IR absorption spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000cm−1 by means of a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were carried out with Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112. The photoluminescence (excitation and emission) spectrum for the solid complex sample of 2 was determined with a Perkin-Elmer LS-55 spectrophotometer. The 10–300K magnetization measurements were carried out on a Quantum Design PPMS system. χ–T graphs were recorded under the constant magnetic field of 10kOe. Magnetic data were corrected for the diamagnetic contribution of the sample holder. The EPR powder spectrum was recorded with a Bruker EMX X-band spectrometer (9.8GHz) with about 20mW microwave power and 100kHz magnetic field modulation. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using a diffractometer (RIGAKU DMAX2500) with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5406Å). 2.2 Crystallographic analyses Diffraction measurements were performed at 100K on a Bruker Smart Apex CCD diffractometer using Mo-Kα radiation (λ=0.71073Å). The structures were solved by direct methods using the program SHELXS97 [37] with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically by full-matrix least-squares methods SHELXL-97 [37]. All the non-hydrogen atoms in the two complexes were refined anisotropically. Most of hydrogen atoms were placed in their calculated positions or from difference Fourier map, respectively. Restrain was applied to water hydrogens to optimize geometry. Molecular drawings were obtained by using Mercury [38]. Details of the refinement are presented in Table 1; the crystallographic information files are deposited with the CCDC as 933350 and 933351. 2.3 Preparation of the complexes (1) {K2[Cu(μ-pydc)2]·3H2O A quantity of 10mL dimethylformamide solution of pydcH2 (1.00g, 5.98mmol) was treated with KOH and metallic copper (0.38g, 5.98mmol) under stirring at 80°C and stirred until total dissolution of the mixture was observed. The mixture turned to blue about 1h. The clear solution was stirred for 2h at 80°C and then cooled to room temperature. Blue crystals were formed and washed with 10mL of water and then dried in air. The compound is soluble in CH3OH, DMF, water and is indeﬁnitely stable in air. Yield: 68% (based on Cu) for 1. Anal. Found: C, 31.40; H, 2.46; N, 5.01%. Calc.

(2) {[Zn(µ-pydc)(H2O)(4-mim)]·H2O} n A quantity of 10mL ethanol solution of pydcH2 (1.00g, 5.98mmol) was treated with metallic zinc (0.38g, 5.98mmol) under stirring at 80°C. The grey mixture was stirred for 1h at 80°C. Then the 4-mim ligand (1.22g, 11.96mmol) in water (10mL) was added dropwise to this mixture. The pale orange solution was stirred for 2h at 50°C and then cooled to room temperature. Brown crystals were formed and washed with 10mL of water and then dried in air. The compound is soluble in CH3OH, DMF and in water and is indeﬁnitely stable in air. Yield: 14% (based on Zn) for 1. Anal. Found: C, 37.86; H, 3.88; N, 12.09%. Calc.

All of the reactions were initiated by heating and stirring DMF or ethanol solution of pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylate. As a metal precursor, it was used copper powder and KOH for 1 and zinc powder for 2. {Na2(µ-H2O)2[Cu(μ-pydc)2]·6H2O} n [40] can also be successfully synthesized by same reaction system of 1. N-donor 4-methylimidazole ligand was used to research its isomerism in 2. When it was used common Zn(II) salts as a precursor, it was not obtained single crystaline product. Compounds were investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy (Figs S1 and S2). A broad bands observed range from 3513 to 3320cm−1 are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of water molecules in 1 and 2. The weak peaks at 2872 and 2681cm−1 are the characteristic of aliphatic C–H stretching bands of the CH3 groups. This band confirm the existence of the 4-mim ligands in complex 2. The absence of strong absorption bands around 1720cm−1 indicate the full deprotonation of carboxylate groups of the pydc ligands, as revealed by the X-ray single-crystal structure analysis. The very strong peaks range from 1644–1587 and 1387–1360cm−1 correspond to ν asym and ν sym of the carboxylate group, respectively. 3.2 Crystal structure Crystal data and structure reﬁnement parameters for the complexes are presented in Table 1. (1) {K2[Cu(μ-pydc)2]·3H2O Selected bond distances, angles and hydrogen bonding geometry are listed in Table 2, the crystal structure with the atom labeling for the structure of 1 is shown in Fig. 1. The crystal analysis on {K2[Cu(μ-pydc)2]·3H2O} n reveals that it is a three-dimensional (3D) sandwich-like framework containing CuO4N2 and KO7 inorganic units with pydc as the bridge ligands. The complex 1 consists of a centrosymmetric polynuclear {K2[Cu(μ-pydc)2]·3H2O} n structural unit. Each Cu2+ ion has a tetragonally distorted octahedral (CuN2O4) coordination environment. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one copper (Cu1) and two potassium (K1 and K2) ions, two pydc dianion, and two water molecules. The basal planes of the octahedral geometry is defined by two oxygen and two nitrogen atoms belonging to two different pydc groups. The axial positions of the Cu2+ coordination sphere are occupied by two symmetry related carboxylate-oxygen of the 3-carboxyl group on adjacent repeat units, resulting in a form of bridging the copper and potassium centers into a 3D architecture ( Fig. 2). As a result of this combination, potassium cation planes is sandwiched between Cu1 and Cu2 planes ( Fig. 3) [41]. The Potassium ions are seven-coordinated by carboxylate-oxygen atoms from pydc ligands and water molecules. The coordination polyhedron KO7 is best described as monocapped trigonal prism. The ionic interaction of pydc ligand both 2-position carboxylate oxygen atoms bidentante interact to K1 atom, both 2- and 3-position carboxylate O2 and O4 atoms bidentate interact to K2 and 3-position carboxylate O4 atom monodentate interacts to another K1ii atom ((i) x−1, y, z; (ii) x−1, y+1, z). In the sodium complex of [Cu(μ-pydc)2] chain, namely {Na2(µ-H2O)2[Cu(μ-pydc)2]·6H2O} complex, shows different Na–O binding and distance because of this Na+ is smaller ion and it is not easy to interact carboxylate ions as more as potassium atoms (Scheme 1). The Cu–N bond lengths are 1.964(3)Å (Cu1–N1) and 1.958(3)Å (Cu2–N2). The Cu–Opydc distances are 1.962(3)Å (Cu1–O1) and 1.967Å (Cu2–O6), whereas the K–Opydc bond lengths are in the range 2.754(3)–2.965(3)Å. The bond length of the Cu–O, Cu–N and K–O are comparable to those of other some polynuclear complexes (Cu–O=1.926–2.660, Cu–N=1.969–2.004 and K–O=2.773–3.171Å) in the literature [28,40,42–45]. The dissimilarity between Cu–O and K–O bond stems from the disparity in bonding feature of metal ions. The copper ions accept the electron pair from carboxylate oxygen atoms forming coordinate covalent bond, while the potassium atom forms ionic bond through the electrostatic interaction. As the electrostatic interaction has no directionality, K+ can interact with the carboxylate oxygen ions and polar water molecules around it as more as possible and exhibit high coordination numbers [44]. The K–O ionic bonds formed between the neighboring structural units of [Cu(pydc)2]2−, which give rise to the formation of a 3D sandwich-like framework of 1. Hydrogen bonds of type O–H∙∙∙O are formed from oxygen donor atoms of the coordinated water molecules to coordinated water oxygen atoms and to oxygen atoms of carboxylate groups. There is also weak C–H∙∙∙O hydrogen bonding and π···π stacking interactions between pydc planes for the crystal packing of 1. Such π···π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions contributes to the 3D framework. To get a better insight into the present 3D framework structure, topological analysis was carried out for 1 [46]. The topology of 1 can be described as three dimensional 3,4,5 connected net with the point symbol of {42.6}2{42.84}{43.6.86}2 ( Fig. 4). (2′) {[Zn(µ-pydc)(H2O)(4-mim)]·H2O} n Selected bond distances, angles and hydrogen bonding geometry are listed in Table 3, the crystal structure of 2 with the atom labeling is shown in Fig. 5. Each Zn(II) ion is coordinated by the one pydc, one 4-mim and one aqua ligands. The pydc acts as tridentate bridging ligand through the deprotonated carboxylate oxygen, the pyridine nitrogen atom in a chelate manner, and another carboxylate oxygen atom [Zn1–N1i=2.108(2), Zn1–O1=2.030(2) and Zn1–O4i=2.112(2)Å]. Therefore, neighboring Zn atoms are combined together by the bridging pydc ligand to form a 1D coordinatively bonded chain along the a axis. The coordination geometry of Zn(II) is intermediate between trigonal bipyramid and square pyramid as is evident from its Addison parameter [47]. For an ideal square pyramid geometry τ is equal to zero, while it becomes unity for ideal trigonal-bipyramidal geometry. Complex 2 has a τ value of 0.44 [τ=(164.65–138.39)/60=0.44), and indicate a distorted square pyramidal geometry around the Zn(II) centers. When it is considered as a distorted square pyramid, the axial site is occupied by a N2 atom from 4-mim ligand (Zn–N2=2.028(2)Å). The equatorial plane is formed by one chelating pydc ligand (with an oxygen atom, O(4)i, at 2.110Å and a nitrogen atom, N(3)i, at 2.108Å; (i) −1+x, y, z), one aqua ligand O(6) at 1.943(3)Å and a monodentate pydc ligand (with an oxygen atom, O(1), at 2.031Å). The complex 2 is an example which contains steric hindranced 4-methylimidazole ligands in the coordination sphere (Scheme 2). The crystal packing of the complex is a composite of intermolecular N–H···O and O–H··· O hydrogen bonds, intermolecular π···π, and intramolecular C–H···π interactions. The adjacent chains are connected through the water bridges by strong O–H···O hydrogen bonds ( Fig. 6). In addition, the 1D chains are interlinked into a network by π···π interactions between both pyridine and imidazole rings ( Fig. 7). These supramolecular interactions join the 1D chains into 3D architecture ( Fig. 8). 3.3 EPR and photoluminescence spectrum The powder EPR spectrum of complex 1 at room temperature and its computer simulation are shown in Fig. 9. Parallel and perpendicular two components have been observed in this spectrum. Hyperfine splitting could not be resolved due to line broadening originated from spin–exchange and spin–orbital interactions because of the excess spin concentration. This spectrum was simulated with the values of g ⧸⧸ and g ⊥ extracted from the powder spectrum. The principal values of these are the following: g ⧸⧸=2.271, g ⊥=2.075. The g values have indicated that the paramagnetic centre is axially symmetric. The order of g ⧸⧸>g ⊥>g e (free electron g value, g e =2.0023) show that Cu2+ ions are located in tetragonal distorted octahedral sites (D4h ) elongated along the z-axis and the ground state of the paramagnetic electron is d x 2 − y 2 (2B1g state) [48–50]. Coordination polymers constructed with Zn(II) metal centers and conjugated organic ligands have been investigated for fluorescence properties because of their various applications as photoactive materials [51,52]. In order to understand the reason for the emission spectrum of complex 2, we performed our previous published studies, namely {[Zn(μ-pydc)(H2O)(2-mim)]·H2O} n complex [53]. Thus, the solid state emission spectra of complex 2 and {[Zn(μ-pydc)(H2O)(2-mim)]·H2O} n , together with those of the free pydc, 2-mim (2-methylimidazole) and 4-mim ligands were measured at room temperature ( Fig. 10). Emission was observed at 421 and 484, 529 and 576, 443 and 484nm for H2pydc, 2-mim and 4-mim free ligands upon excitation at 350, 379 and 360nm, respectively. {[Zn(μ-pydc)(H2O)(2-mim)]·H2O} n complex exhibits intense fluorescent emission bands at 484 and 531nm and a shoulder at 576nm upon excitation at 379nm. Excitation of the complex 2 at 379nm produces intense emission with two maxima at 484 and 543nm and a shoulder at 576nm. The first emission peak for both Zn(II) complexes at 484nm, can probably be assigned to the ligand centered fluorescent emission because similar emissions under the same conditions are observed for the free pydc at 484nm. Emission spectrum of complex {[Zn(μ-pydc)(H2O)(2-mim)]·H2O} n can probably be assigned to the intraligand (π ⁎→π) fluorescent emission because similar emissions are observed at 529nm and a shoulder at 576nm for the free 2-mim ligand [54]. Notably, large red shifted emission occurs in complex 2 with respect to the free ligands (pydc and 4-mim), and such broad band may be tentatively attributable to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) as reported for other Zn(II) complexes with N-donor ligands [55]. From the above discussion, complexes 2 and {[Zn(μ-pydc)(H2O)(2-mim)]·H2O} n , which have the same metal center, pydc ligand and N-donor imidazole ligand as well as similar coordination environments, show different photoluminescence behaviors. The differences between the emission peaks for two complexes are probably ascribed to the differences in the position of methyl group of 2-mim and 4-mim ligands [56]. The results indicate that the substitue groups of imidazole derivative ligands have an important influence on the photoluminescence behaviors. 3.4 Magnetic properties For complex 1, the molar magnetic susceptibility (χ m ) and χ m T in the temperature range of 10–300K are shown in Fig. 11. The variable temperature dependence of χ m was fitted by the relation of α+C/T where C is the Curie constant, and α is temperature independent susceptibility (TIP) [57,58] From this fitting process, C=0.276±0.0001emuK/molOe, α=0.0015±0.000003emu/molOe were determined. The TIP can originate from the fact the ground state couples with excited states due to the orbital moments of d electrons or Pauli paramagnetism is associated with parallel alignment tendency of magnetic dipoles of free electrons in metals to the applied magnetic field. The effective magnetic moment, μ eff, was calculated to be 1.49 using the relation μ eff=2.83(C)1/2 in Bohr magneton (μ B ). The value of μ eff for this complex is slightly lower than expected value of single electron spinning of copper (II) (S=1/2) ions (1.73μ B ) due to mixing of some spin–orbital angular momentum from excited states via spin–orbit coupling [59]. According to these results, the structure shows the paramagnetic behavior in the experimental temperature range. 3.5 Thermogravimetric analysis and powder X-ray diffraction Thermal analyses (TG/DTA) were performed to verify the thermal stability of the complexes. Complex 1 shows a three stage decomposition process (Fig. S3). In the first stage, the complex starts to lose three water molecules range from 47 to 138°C with an experimental mass loss of 10.27% (calcd. 9.65%). The anhydrous complex is thermally stable up to about 240°C. In the following exothermic stages between 240 and 437°C, the successive weight-loss stages correspond to the decomposition of the pydc ligand (DTGmax 252 and 416°C, found 50.83, calcd 52.88%). The total mass loss of all decomposition process is 60.12% (calcd 60.48%) suggest that KCN and CuO is the end product. The thermal decomposition of the complex 2 occurs at three stages (Fig. S4). The first degradation stage takes place in the range of 87–123°C and it corresponds to the eliminated of water molecules due to a weight loss of 11.05% in a good matching with theoretical value 10.32% (DTGmax=115 and 139°C). The second and last stage of the temperature range of 237–555°C, related to the decomposition of 4-mim and pydc ligands is abruptly burnt by the endothermic and exothermic effects, respectively (found 63.52, calcd. 66.27%, DTGmax=265 and 508°C). The total mass loss of all decomposition process is 74.57% (calcd 76.59%) suggest that ZnO is the end product. The crystalline products of 1 and 2 have been characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) at room temperature (Figs. S5 and S6, Supporting information). The observed XRD patterns are in good agreement with the results simulated from the single crystal data, indicating the high purity of the synthesized samples. The differences in intensity may be due to the preferred orientation of the crystalline powder samples. 4 Conclusions We have synthesized and characterized the two new heteronuclear and homometallic coordination polymers, {K2[Cu(μ-pydc)2]·3H2O} n (1) and {[Zn(µ-pydc)(H2O)(4-mim)]·H2O} n (2) prepared from zerovalent copper and zinc metals. It was concluded that using zerovalent metal atoms is a facile method to synthesize both homo and heterometallic coordination polymers. Although we have carried out many studies with 4(5)-methylimidazole ligand, the complex 2 is an example containing sterically hindered 4-methylimidazole ligand. The successful assembly of the two coordination polymers may be of use for the application of photoactive or magnetic materials.
