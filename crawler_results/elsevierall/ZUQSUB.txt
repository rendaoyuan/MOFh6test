The difference of the structures can be attributed to the different orientations of binding sites in isomer bis(triazole) ligand. Solid-state luminescence studies of complexes 1 and 2 have also been carried out at room temperature. Three new coordination polymers, namely, [Zn(o-bbtz)(nip)] n (1), [Zn(m-bbtz)(nip)] n (2), {[Cu(o-bbtz)(nip)]·H2O} n (3), have been successfully synthesized under solventthermal conditions and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, IR spectra and thermogravimetric analysis. Both complexes 1 and 2 exhibit 2D layer structure with (4,4) network, which are further connected by π⋯π interactions to generate a 3D supramolecular structure. Complex 3 shows a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular network based on the π⋯π interactions and hydrogen bonds. The luminescent properties of 1 and 2 have also been investigated. Keywords Copper(II) complexes Zinc(II) complexes Solventthermal synthesis 5-Nitroisophthalic acid Luminescent property 1 Introduction There is a growing interest in the design and synthesis of novel coordination polymers (CPs), not only for their intriguing architectures but also for their promising applications as functional materials in magnetism, conductivity, catalysis, gas sorption, drug delivery, optics and fillers of hybrid membranes [1–9]. Recently, CPs have also been used to remove organosulfur or organonitrogen complexes from model fuels [10]. However, it still remains a tremendous scientific challenge to rational design and synthesis of CPs with expected structures. Because many factors can affect on the formation of the final structures, including the metal ion, the organic ligand, the metal-to-ligand ratio, pH value, the solvent, and the reaction temperature and time [11–14]. Here, we focus on the study of the effect of organic ligands and metal ions, which are considered to be most important facts in the self-assembly system. As we know, flexible bis-1,2,4-triazole ligands are extensively utilized in the construction of CPs, by reason of their conformational freedoms [15], which can adopt different conformations according to the geometric needs of the different crystal structures [16,17]. Some CPs based on bis-1,2,4-triazole ligands, for example 1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propane [18], 3,5-bis[3-(pyrid-2-yl)-1,2,4-triazolyl]pyridine [19] and 2,6-bis[3-(pyrid-4-yl)-1,2,4-triazolyl]pyridine [20], with diversified topologies and interesting properties have been reported. On the other hand, rigid ligands are also often chosen to construct CPs, because they not only can influence the structures of the CPs but also can form more stable framework structures [21–23]. Specifically, rigid ligand 5-nitroisophthalic acid (H2nip) is a good candidate linker for the construction of CPs because of its versatile coordination modes [24,25]. In this work, H2nip were chosen to assemble with Cu(II)/Zn(II) ions at the presence of the position isomers of 1,2-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (o-bbtz), 1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (m-bbtz) and 1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (p-bbtz). Three new CPs, namely, [Zn(o-bbtz)(nip)] n (1), [Zn(m-bbtz)(nip)] n (2), {[Cu(o-bbtz)(nip)]·H2O} n (3), have been successfully prepared by utilizing solventthermal technique. Complex 1 is a 2D layer framework and shows a 2D→3D polythreading motif based on π⋯π stacking. Complex 2 is also a 2D layered structure and exhibits a 2D→2D polythreading motif. Structural studies reveal that complex 3 is a 3D supramolecular framework base on π⋯π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition, the luminescent properties of 1and 2 have also been studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and physical measurements All reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The o-bbtz, m-bbtz and p-bbtz ligands were synthesized according to the literature method [26,27]. The FT-IR spectra were recorded using KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400cm−1 on a Mattson Alpha-Centauri spectrometer. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were performed on a Perkin–Elmer 2400 Elemental Analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/Max 2000 X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu/Kα radiation (λ =1.5418Å) and 2θ ranging from 5° to 50° with an increment of 0.02° and a scanning rate of 5° min−1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Perkin–Elmer Thermal Analyzer under an N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. Luminescence spectra were collected on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrophotometer with a Xe lamp as light source. 2.2 Synthesis of [Zn(o-bbtz)(nip)] n (1) A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.045g, 0.15mmol), H2nip (0.011g, 0.05mmol), o-bbtz (0.024g, 0.10mmol), H2O (3mL) and acetonitrile (3mL) was sealed in a 23mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, which was heated at 120°C for 3days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10°Ch−1.

Complex 2 is prepared as colorless block crystals with a yield of 43% (based on Zn). Anal. Calc. for C20H15ZnN7O6: C, 44.86; H, 2.80; N, 22.24. Found: C, 44.84; H, 2.79; N, 22.34%.

The intensity data were collected with the ω scan technique and corrected for Lp effects. The structures were solved by the direct method followed by the difference Fourier method and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F 2 using the SHELXTL-97 [28]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms on organic ligands were located and included at their calculated positions. The water hydrogen atoms were located from difference Fourier maps. The solvent H2O of 3 was split over two sites with a total occupancy of 1 (O1W and O2W). Data collection and refinement parameters are listed in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in the Supporting information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis 3.1.1 Crystal structure of [Zn(o-bbtz)(nip)] n (1) Complex 1 shows a 2D→3D polythreading motif. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Zn(II) ion, one o-bbtz, and one nip2−. As shown in Fig. 1 a, Zn1 is four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N6) from two o-bbtz ligands and two oxygen atoms (O1 and O4#1) from two H2nip ligands, showing distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. The Zn–N and Zn–O bond lengths fall in the range of 1.999(2)–2.018(2)Å and 1.956(6)–1.976(2)Å, respectively. Zn ions are connected by o-bbtz and nip2− to form wave-shape 2D layers with 44-sql topology (Fig. 1b). The Zn⋯Zn distance separated by trans-type o-bbtz and μ 2- nip2− ligand is 12.60 and 10.31Å, respectively (Scheme 1 a and d). The 2D layer contains only one kind of parallelogram-shaped windows with diagonal distances of 14.53Å×17.61Å (Fig. S1a). Interestingly, the 2D structure, with nitro-group lateral arms projecting both sides, is simultaneously interdigitated with the adjacent ones. Then, a 2D→3D polythreaded network is formed from the entanglement of the adjacent lateral arms at a time (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1c). Further, structure analyses show that these 2D layers are further stabled by π⋯π stacking interactions between the benzene rings of nip2− rings from adjacent layers (Cg(2)>Cg(2) 3.676(1)Å ,Cg(2): C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7) (Fig. S1b). 3.1.2 Crystal structure of [Zn(mbtz)(nip)] n (2) When the o-bbtz ligand was replaced by the m-bbtz ligand, a new complex, 2, was obtained. The asymmetric unit of 2 consists of one Zn(II) ion, one m-bbtz and one nip2−. As shown in Fig. 2 a, each Zn(II) ion displays a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry, coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N6) from two m-bbtz ligands and two oxygen atoms (O1 and O4#1) from two H2nip ligands. The Zn–N and Zn–O bond lengths fall in the range of 2.012(2)–2.025(2)Å and 1.959(7)–1.976(2)Å, respectively. Zn ions in complex 2 are connected by o-bbtz and nip2− to form wave-shape 2D layers with 44-sql topology (Fig. S2a). The Zn⋯Zn distance separated by trans-type m-bbtz and μ 2- nip2− ligand is 12.09 and 10.22Å, respectively (Scheme 1b and d). The 2D layer of 2 also contains one kind of parallelogram-shaped windows with diagonal distances of 13.22Å×18.07Å (Fig. 2b). However, unlike in complex 1, the nitro-group lateral arms projecting only one side of 2D layers of 2. Layers of 2 are alternatively arranged in an ABA fashion with the nitro-group lateral arms point in opposite directions (Fig. S2b). Furthermore, pairs of these layers are entangled in a face-to-face parallel fashion with the lateral arms on one layer threading the windows in the other layer to generate a 2D→2D polythreaded net (Fig. 2c and d). Furthermore, the π⋯π stacking interactions between the benzene rings of nip2− rings from adjacent layers help to stable the entangled bi-layers (Cg(2)>Cg(2) 3.717(1)Å and Cg(3)>Cg(3) 3.651(3)Å; Cg(2): N6, C1, N4, N5, C2; Cg(3): C15–C16–C17–C18–C19–C20). 3.1.3 Crystal structure of {[Cu(o-bbtz)(nip) ]·H2O} n (3) Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that 3 is a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular based on the π⋯π interactions and hydrogen bonds. The asymmetric unit of 3 contains one Cu(II) ion, one o-bbtz, one nip2− ligand and one lattice water molecule. As shown in Fig. 3 a, Cu1 is six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N4#2) from two o-bbtz ligands and four oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3#3 and O4#1) from three H2nip ligands in a distorted octahedral geometry. Cu–N bond distances range from 1.974(3) to 1.997(3)Å and Cu–O bond distances range from 1.958(2) to 2.565(3)Å. Cu ions are connected by o-bbtz and nip2− to form 1D chains with Cu⋯Cu separation of 4.21 and 8.03Å, respectively (Fig. 3b). Each o-bbtz ligand bridges two Cu(II) ions showing in a cis mode (Scheme 1c). Each nip2− ligand bridges three Cu(II) ions with μ 3–(μ 2-η 1:η 1)–(μ 1-η 1:η 1) coordination mode: two oxygen atoms of one carboxyl group coordinate to one Cu(II) ion in a chelating coordination mode, two oxygen atoms of the other carboxyl group connect two Cu(II) ions in a bidentate bridging mode (Scheme 1e). It is noteworthy that the 1D chains in 3 are connected into 2D layers by the π⋯π interactions between the benzene rings of nip2− with centroid–centroid separation of 3.724(1)Å (Fig. 3c). Then, these 2D layers are further connected to form a 3D supramolecular network via hydrogen bonding interactions between the lattice water molecules and carboxylate oxygen atoms of nip2− ligand (Fig. 3d and e). The detailed parameters of π⋯π and hydrogen bonding interactions are listed in Table S2. 3.2 Comparison of the structures of complexes 1–3 Complexes 1 and 2 were synthesized under the same solventthermal synthesis conditions. They both show 2D layer frameworks. Nevertheless, 1 displays a 2D→3D polythreaded network, while 2 generate a 2D→2D polythreaded net. The difference of the structures can be attributed to the different orientations of binding sites in isomer bis(triazole) ligand [29]. The isomeric bis(triazole) ligands adopts completely different conformations of cis and trans in complexes 1–3. An trans conformation was found in complexes 1 and 2, while a cis conformation was in complex 3. The former contributes to the formation of a highly undulated sheet and the latter to the loop. This result shows that isomer bis(triazole) ligand can fine-tune themselves to match with the coordination preference of metal centers and lower the energetic arrangement in the self-assembly process [30]. 3.3 PXRD pattern and thermal analysis In order to confirm the phase purity, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were carried out for 1–3. All the diffraction peaks on the curves are in good agreement with the simulated ones, indicating the phase purity of the as-synthesized products (Fig. S3). To characterize the complexes more fully in terms of thermal stability, the thermal behaviors of 1, 2, and 3 were examined by TGA. The experiments were performed on samples consisting of numerous single crystals with a heating rate of 10°C/min (Fig. S4). Complexes 1 and 2 were stable to 315 and 276°C, respectively. Then began to decompose upon further heating and were followed by a two-step weight loss, which is assigned to the release of ligands, respectively. Complex 3 shows the weight loss of 3.45% (calcd: 3.38%) in 88–150°C, assigning to the release of lattice water molecule. The second and third weight losses in the range of 345–386 and 386–533°C, due to the release of the organic ligands. 3.4 Photoluminescent properties The solid-state luminescent spectra of complexes 1, 2 and the free ligands have been investigated at room temperature (Fig. 4 ). The maximum emission peak of the H2nip ligand displays at 455nm upon excitation bands at 370nm. Upon excitation at 320nm, intense emission is observed at 450 and 430nm for o-bbtz and m-bbtz, respectively. These emission bands probably caused by the π ∗ → n or π ∗ → π transitions as previously reported [31,32]. The complexes 1and 2 exhibit distinct emission bands at 458 and 441nm upon excitation at 370nm. According to the literature, the Zn(II) ion is difficult to oxidize or reduce because of the d 10 configuration. The emission of 1 and 2 should be neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) in nature [30,33]. As far as we know, the emission of H2nip belongs to π ∗ → n transitions and is very weak compared to that of the π ∗ → π transition of the N-donor ligand, so the H2nip has almost no contribution to the fluorescent emission of complexes 1 and 2 [34]. Thus, the emission may be assigned to the N-donor ligand. These observations suggest that 1 and 2 will be excellent candidates for solvent-resistant fluorescent material. 4 Conclusion Three new CPs with 1,2 and 1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene have been successfully synthesized and structurally analyzed. The coordination architectures of 1, 2 and 3 take a systematic structural variation by the employment of different ligands and metal ions. The result shows that the positions of functional groups in the similar ligands affect the crystal structures of the complexes and the structures of such complexes could be adjusted by geometrical requirement of the metal ions.
