Four new metal-organic coordination polymers, Cd(mip)(DMF)(1), Cd(mip)(EtOH)(2), Cd2(mip)2(H2O)5·3H2O (3), Cd(mip)(bpp)(H2O)·H2O (4) (H2mip = 5-methylisophthalic acid, bpp = 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane) have been hydro(solvo)thermally synthesized and characterized by IR, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, powder X-ray diffraction and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. 1 and 2 are isostructural, and two adjacent Cd centers are bridged by four carboxylate groups in μ 2-carboxylato-κ1O.:κ1O′ and μ 2Ο; κ2O,O′ fashion to form a linear (Cd–O–Cd)n chain. The adjacent (Cd–O–Cd)n chains are further connected by mip bridges to form a 3D framework. 3 features two types of chiral layers: One left-handed and another right-handed, which lead to racemic solid-state compound. 4 exhibits a two-dimensional wave-like (2D) (4,4) layer structure with infinite 1D linear chain. In addition, the luminescent properties of 1–4 are also discussed. Graphical abstract Keywords Coordination polymer Cd(II) Chiral layer Photoluminescence 1 Introduction The design and synthesis of coordination polymers have received significant attention in the field of coordination chemistry, not only because of their versatile intriguing architectures and topologies but also because of their potential application as functional materials [1–5]. Many metal-organic frameworks, which are formed by using metal ions as nodes and multidentate organic ligands containing O- or N-donors as linkers, have been reported so far [6]. However, it is still a challenge to predict and exactly control the structures of the framework. It is known that the geometries of organic ligands have an important effect on the final structures of coordination polymers [7]. The main synthetic strategy is to adopt the suitable secondary building units (SBUs) and further control the structure of the metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) [8]. In this context, we chose 5-methylisophthalic acid based on two following consideration: (1) the 5-methylisophthalic acid is a ligand with the rigid V-shaped geometry, which may generate one-dimensional helical chains [9]. (2) due to possessing the electron-donating methyl group, it can change their electronic and steric properties, which will result in MOFs with novel structures different from other common dicarboxylic ligands [10]. In this paper, we report four coordination polymeric complexes without or with N-containing auxiliary ligands, namely [Cd(mip)(DMF)]n(1), [Cd(mip)(EtOH)]n(2), Cd2(mip)2(H2O)5·3H2O (3) and Cd(mip)(bpp)(H2O).H2O (4), (H2mip = 5-methylisophthalic acid, bpp = 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods All the reagents and solvents employed were commercially available and used as received without further purification. The C, H, and N microanalyses were carried out with Perkin–Elmer 240 elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were taken on a Perkin–Elmer Pyrisl (35–900 °C, 20 °C min−1, flowing N2(g)). X-ray power diffraction were recorded with a Bruker AXS D8 advanced automated diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. The emission spectra were recorded on a Perkin–Elmer LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer. 2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Cd(mip)(DMF) (1) A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.0926 g, 0.3 mmol), H2mip (0.036 g, 0.2 mmol), triethylamine (0.02 mL), and DMF (5 mL) in a 23-mL Teflon reactor, which was heated at 110 °C for five days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 K h−1. Straw yellow block crystals of 1 were obtained in 55% yield after washing with DMF and drying in air. Anal. calcd. for C12H13CdNO5: C, 39.63; H, 3.60; N, 3.85. Found: C, 39.68; H, 3.61; N, 3.91.

The structure was solved by direct methods and refined on F 2 by full-matrix least squares using SHELXTL [11]. Crystallographic data and experimental details for structural analyses are summarized in Table 1 . CCDC reference numbers: 775366–775369 for 1–4. 3 Results and discussion The hydro/solvothermal reactions of H2mip with cadmium salt through the different solvent gave compounds 1–4. 3.1 Crystal structures 3.1.1 Cd(mip)(DMF) (1) and Cd(mip)(EtOH) (2) Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that the structures of 1 and 2 are isostructural although two kinds of solvent molecules coordinate to the Cd(II) centers, so only the structure of 1 is described here. 1 is a three-dimensional framework in which the mip ligand adopts two kinds of coordination modes. One mip adopt a bidentate chelating and bidentate bridging mode, another one mip is bonded to four Cd atoms in a chelating/bridging bidentate and bidentate coordination fashion (Scheme 1 a and b). Fig. 1 a shows a perspective view of the local coordination environment of the Cd(II) center, the Cd(1) center is in a distorted octahedral geometry constructed by six carboxylic oxygen atoms which come from four different mip ligands and one DMF molecule, with the Cd–O distance from 2.238(13) to 2.528(16) Å. Two adjacent Cd centers are bridged by four carboxylate groups in μ 2-carboxylato-κ1O; κ1O′ and μ 2Ο; κ2O,O′ fashion to form a linear (Cd–O–Cd)n chain with Cd1···Cd2 distance of 3.778(2) Å (Fig. 1b). The adjacent (Cd–O–Cd)n chains are further connected by mip bridges to form a 3-D framework (Fig. 1c). 3.1.2 Cd2(mip)2(H2O)5·3H2O(3) Single-crystal X-ray analysis reveal that 3 exhibits a two-dimensional chiral layer structure in which the asymmetric unit contains two Cd(II) ions, two mip, five aqua ligands and three lattice water molecules (Fig. 2 a). The Cd1 center is seven-coordinated by seven oxygen atoms from three mip ligands and two aqua ligands. The coordination geometry around Cd1 center can be described as a distorted pentagonal bipyramid with the Cd–O bond lengths ranging from 2.300(3) to 2.473(3) Å and O–Cd–O bond angles ranging from 54.5(2) to 167.5(2)°. Unlike Cd(1), the Cd2 center is six-coordinated by six oxygen atoms from two individual mip ligands and three aqua ligands, forming a distorted octahedral geometry with the Cd–O bond lengths ranging from 2.217(3) to 2.482(3) Å and O–Cd–O bond angles ranging from 54.8(2) to 175.0(2)°. In 3, the mip ligand acts as a tetradentate ligand, in which one carboxylic group of the mip ligand bidentately bridge two Cd centers in a syn-anti fashion, while the other exhibits a bidentate chelating mode (Scheme 1c). The adjacent Cd(1) centers are bridged by mip ligands to form a 1D [Cd(mip)]n helical chain. The adjacent helical chains were connected by the syn-anti O,O′-bridge of mip ligands to form a 2-D layer (Fig. 2b). The most interesting feature of 4 is that there exist two kinds of layers, which contains chains of opposite chirality but equivalent conformation and these different chains are enantiomorphous. Because these layers, being parallel to the bc plane, possess left-handed and right-handed characterization alternately, each layer thus becomes a chiral component. The two types of layers, one left-handed and the other right-handed, pairwise crystallize in a space group P21/n, leading to a racemic solid-state compound. In left-handed layer, there exist left-handed helical Cd(mip)n chains. However, in the adjacent layer, there exists right-handed helical chain (Fig. 3 c). To the best of our knowledge, the homochiral helical chains in a chiral layer architecture have been scarcely reported [12]. These layers are further linked via strong hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate oxygen atoms and the lattice water molecules(O1W···O8 (−x + 1, −y + 2, −z) 2.684 Å, <O1W-H1W-O8 123.2°; O1W···O5W (−x + 3/2, y + 1/2, −z + 1/2) 2.842 Å, <O1W-H1WB-O5W 163.8°; O5W···O4 (−x + 1, −y + 2, −z + 1) 2.794 Å, <O5W-H5WA-O4 140.0°; O2W···O7W (x, y, z) 2.880 Å, <O2W-H2WA-O7W 121.1°; O2W···O4W (−x + 3/2, y − 1/2, −z + 1/2) 3.210 Å, <O2W-H2WB-O4W 141.3°; O6W···O7W (−x + 3/2, y − 1/2, −z + 1/2) 2.886 Å, <O6W-H6WA-O7W 123.0°; O8W···O5W (−x + 1, −y + 2, −z + 1) 2.854 Å, <O8W-H8WA-O5W 133.1°; O8W···O3W (x, y, z) 3.213 Å, <O8W-H8WB-O3W 136.1°) forming a three-dimensional supramolecular framework. The hydrogen bonding interactions enhance the stability of the complex. In order to study the effect of the –CH3 group on the framework, the similar compound with Cd(II) and ip ligand, [Cd(H2O)(ip)] [13] under the similar synthetic conditions, was compared. Cd(II) in [Cd(H2O)(ip)] is in a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal environment (CdO7). The CdO7 polyhedron is formed by an aqua ligand and six oxygen atoms from tridentate carboxylate groups of the four individual ip ligands with (2121) connectivity. The edge sharing polyhedra are connected by the ip ligands to form an extended two-dimensional layer. 3.1.3 Cd(mip)(bpp)(H2O).H2O(4) 4 features a 2-D layer structure with the asymmetric units contain one Cd(II) center, one mip ligand, one aqua ligand, one bpp ligand and 1/3 lattice water molecule. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Cd(1) center is six-coordinated by three carboxylic oxygen atoms from two individual mip ligands, one aqua ligand and two nitrogen atoms from two different bpp ligands to form a slightly distorted octahedral geometry. The Cd–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.242(4)–2.491(4) Å, the Cd–N bond lengths are in the range of 2.311(4) and 2.377(4) Å, and the O–Cd–O bond angles are in the range of 54.31(14) to 142.55(15)°. Two adjacent Cd centers are connected by mip ligands via bidentate and monodentate coordination mode (Scheme 1d) to form a 1D [Cd(mip)]n linear chain. Furthermore, the adjacent [Cd(mip)]n linear chain were linked by bpp ligands to form a 2-D wave-like (4,4) network(Fig. 2b). 4 is in contrast to compound [Cd4(ip)4(bpp)2]n [14], the tetranuclear Cd(II) clusters are bridged by ip ligands to form parallel square layers [Cd4(ip)4]n. The resulting layers are further pillared up by parallel bpp ligands to form a 3D structure [Cd4(ip)4(bpp)2]n, which is non-interpenetrated pseudo-primitive cubic (pcu) topology with double edges constructed from a 12-connected SBU. By comparing the compounds 3 and 4 with the corresponding compounds [Cd(H2O)(ip)] and [Cd4(ip)4(bpp)2]n, we may conclude that –CH3 group have profound influences on the final structural motif. 3.2 Photoluminescence properties Metal-organic coordination polymers with a d10 configuration (such as Zn2+ and Cd2+) have been found to exhibit photoluminescence properties [15]. Therefore, the photoluminescent properties of 1–4 were investigated. The solid-state fluorescence properties 1–4 were measured in the solid state at room temperature, and their emission spectra are given in Fig. 4 . The emission bands are observed at 473 and 506 nm (λ ex = 319 nm) for 1, 373 and 495 nm (λ ex = 318 nm) for 2, 424 nm (λ ex = 373 nm) for 3, and 452 nm (λ ex = 305 nm) for 4 are observed, respectively. In order to understand the nature of the emission bands, the photoluminescence property of the H2mip ligand was analyzed, and the free H2mip shows an emission band at 481 nm upon excitation at 393 nm, while free bpp ligand presents weak photoluminescence emission at 521 nm [14]. Taking the emission bands of these free organic ligands into consideration, the emission bands for 1–4 may be assigned as ligand-to-metal charge transition (LMCT) [16]. 3.3 X-ray powder diffraction and thermal properties The simulated and experimental XRPD patterns of 1–4 are shown in Fig. S1. Their peak positions are in good agreement with each other, indicating the phase purity of the product. The differences in intensity may be due to the preferred orientation of the powder samples [17]. The thermal stability of 1–4 was examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a dry nitrogen atmosphere from 30 to 900 °C (Fig. S2). The TG curve of 1 exhibits that the first weight loss of 20.05% (calculated: 20.11%) corresponding to the loss of one DMF molecule in the temperature range of 170–358 °C, further weight loss indicates the framework decompose. The TG curve of 2 shows the initial weight loss in the temperature range of 40–273 °C, which corresponds to lose the coordinated ethanol molecule (observed: 13.73% and calculated: 13.69%). The TG curve of 3 displays weight loss of three lattice water molecules below 145 °C (observed: 7.00% and calculated: 7.45%). The TG curve of 4 displays weight loss of the lattice water molecules below 296 °C (observed: 1.02% and calculated: 1.16%). 4 Conclusions Four different Cd(II) coordination compounds based on H2mip without or with N-containing bridging ligand (bpp) at different solvent have been successfully synthesized and structurally characterized. 1 and 2 are 3D frameworks (using DMF and EtOH as solvent). 3 features a chiral layer structure consisting of left-handed or right-handed helical [Cd(mip)]n chains, which lead to racemic solid-state compound. 4 features a 2D (4,4) wave-like layer structure. The emission bands for 1–4 may be assigned as ligand-to-metal charge transition.
