Their structures illustrate how the metal coordination assembly in the solid state may be influenced significantly not only by the nature of the counterion, but also by the topicity of the ligand. Complexes of 2,3-bis(4,5-dimethylthio-1,3-dithiole-2-ylidene)succinonitrile (L) with AgX salts ( X = NO 3 - , CF 3 SO 3 - ) have been prepared and fully characterized by elemental analysis, IR and single-crystal X-ray analysis. The structural topology in the solid state is found to depend on the type of counterions. With AgNO3, a 3D coordination network of composition [Ag2(L)(NO3)2] n (1) forms in which Ag(I) is six-coordinated, bonding to two sulfur atoms of ligand L, a neighboring ligand nitrogen atom and totally three oxygen atoms of bridging nitrate anions. Changing the counterion to triflate produces a 2D coordination network of composition [Ag2(L)(CF3SO3)2] n (2) in which Ag(I) is five-coordinated and bonds to two sulfur atoms of ligand L and totally three oxygen atoms of bridging triflate anions. Obviously, in the latter case, the nitrile groups of L are non-coordinating. Keywords 2,3-bis(4,5-dimethylthio-1,3-dithiole-2-ylidene)succinonitrile Crystal structures Silver (I) Counterion effect 1 Introduction The construction of coordination polymers and supramolecular complexes based on polyfunctional organic ligands and transition metal salts is an important theme of modern coordination chemistry owing to their potential as functional materials [1–3]. However, the variable coordination propensity of the metal ions is influenced by a variety of factors such as ligand geometry, counterion and solvent [4,5]. Therefore, it is still a challenge for chemists to understand how these factors affect the metal coordination and crystal packing in order to control the coordination assembly process, the structures and properties of the complexes. Recently, we have developed a straightforward synthetic route to the preparation of the new multitopic ligand 2,3-bis(4,5-dimethylthio-1,3-dithiole-2-ylidene)succinonitrile (L) [6]. Ag(I) is a soft metal center with a high affinity for soft nitrogen- and sulfur-containing ligands [7]. In principle, the framework of Ag(I) complexes can vary widely as reported in the literature [8]. As a consequence, we have initiated a study of the network topology based on L as a function of counterions. Herein, we present structural studies of coordination networks derived from ligand L and two different AgX ( X = NO 3 - , CF 3 SO 3 - ) salts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and equipment Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin–Elmer One FT-IR spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on an EA 1110 Elemental Analyzer CHNS Carlo Erba Instruments. 2.2 Synthesis of complex [Ag2( L )(NO3)2] n (1) The solution of ligand L [5] (10mg, 0.022mmol) in 5ml of dichloromethane was added to one side of an H-tube. A saturated solution of AgNO3 in methanol (5ml) was added to the other side of the H-tube, and the two sides of the H-tube were carefully connected by methanol and left in dark place at room temperature. After one week, yellowish crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained on the wall of the H-tube. Yield: 10.4mg (60%). Anal. Calc. for C14H12Ag2N4O6S8: C, 20.90; H, 1.50; N, 6.96.

Data collection was performed using Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.71073). The structures were solved by Direct methods using the programme shelxs-97 [10]. The refinement and all further calculations were carried out using shelxl-97 [11]. The hydrogen atoms were included in calculated positions and treated as riding atoms using shelxl-97 default parameters. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. An absorption correction was applied using DIFABS [12] (T min =0.154, T max =0.627 for 1; T min =0.714, T max =0.722 for 2). Both compounds crystallize in non-centrosymmetric space groups (1: P2121, 2: C2) as racemic twins (1: BASF=0.48(12); 2: BASF=0.69(7)). The crystallographic data of the complexes 1 and 2 are collected in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure of complex [Ag2( L )(NO3)2] n (1) The compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group (P2121) with a metal to ligand stoichiometry of 2:1. The coordination geometry around the silver ion is a distorted octahedron (Fig. 1 ) with a NO3S2 coordination sphere. Thus, the metal ion is bonded to two sulfur atoms of ligand L, one nitrogen atom of a neighboring ligand L, two oxygen atoms of a bridging nitrate ion in a chelating mode and one oxygen atom of a bridging nitrate ion in a monodentate manner. The average bond distances of Ag–S, Ag–N and Ag–O are 2.774(5), 2.368(13) and 2.558(14)Å, respectively. The greatest deviation from idealized octahedral geometry around the silver ion is observed for the nitrogen and sulfur atoms of ligand, N(1)ii–Ag(1)–S(4) 156.3 (4)° (see Table 2). Each ligand L coordinates four Ag(I) ions, on one side through its sulfur atoms in a chelating mode and on the other side through its nitrogen atoms of the two nitrile groups. Thereby, as illustrated in Fig. 2 , an extended coordination network in two dimensions is formed which contains loops of four half L molecules and four Ag(I) ions. Furthermore, these 2D networks are interlinked by bridging nitrates through Ag–O–N–O–Ag bonds leading to a Ag⋯Ag non-bonding distance of 5.31Å. Overall, due to these bridging NO 3 - anions, a 3D coordination network is generated. Within this network, the shortest S⋯S distance between the neighboring layers is 5.31Å, hence significantly longer than the van der Waals radius sum (3.70Å) [13]. Consequently, the S⋯S interaction between the neighboring 2D layers is negligible. 3.2 Structure of complex [Ag2( L )(CF3SO3)2] n (2) In order to evaluate the influence of counterions on the coordination behaviour, AgCF3SO3 was used instead of AgNO3 in the reaction with L, whereby a new complex (2) was obtained. On the one hand, CF 3 SO 3 - is larger than NO 3 - , and on the other hand, its oxygen atoms have a stronger coordination ability than those of NO 3 - [14]. The compound crystallizes in a monoclinic space group (C2), again with a metal to ligand stoichiometry of 2:1. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3 , the silver ions which are bonded to the sulfur atoms of L are only bridged by triflate ions and no more coordinated to the nitrogen atoms of the nitrile groups. Specifically, the coordination geometry around the silver ion is distorted square pyramidal with an O3S2 coordination sphere. The degree of distortion from the idealized square-pyramidal can be estimated from the geometric parameter τ [15]. If O(1) is chosen as the axial donor atom, α and β are 143.5° and 160.4°, respectively, leading to a τ value of 0.29. The average bond distances of Ag–S and Ag–O are 2.676(3)Å, 2.481(8)Å, respectively (see Table 3), which are distinctly shorter than those of complex 1. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , L adopts a bis-bidentate bonding mode to Ag(I) ions through its sulfur atoms and furthermore, via the bidentate bridging triflate anions, an extended two-dimensional coordination network is formed. Obviously, the nitrile groups of L are non-coordinating. The neighboring ligands L are parallel to each other with interplanar distances larger than 5.76Å, indicating that there are no close S⋯S interactions in 2, either. In a systematic investigation of the role of counterions in Ag(I) complexes, it has been concluded that a variety of anions can influence the coordination modes of ligands [16,17]. In the present systems, the NO 3 - anion plays a bidentate bridging role in the formation of 1, so L acts as a hexadentate bridging ligand. However, in the case of 2, the CF 3 SO 3 - anion has stronger coordination ability with its oxygen atoms toward Ag(I), thus the ligand L takes a bis-bidentate bonding mode with two nitrile groups remaining non-coordinating to Ag(I). In general, the structural differences between 1 and 2 show the profound effect of anions on the framework formation of silver coordination complexes, which nicely reflects their differences in size and coordination strength. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, in this report we present two new silver complexes 1 and 2 with different structural topologies. In both networks, the bridging of counterions ( NO 3 - and CF 3 SO 3 - ) extends the coordination network to 3D and 2D, respectively. The structures, therefore, illustrate how metal coordination assembly in the solid state may be influenced significantly not only by the nature of the counterion, but also by the topicity of the ligand.
