Keywords Coordination polymers Manganese Isophthalate Magnetic properties 1 Introduction Porous coordination polymers (PCPs) or metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted extensive interests in the past two decades because of their intriguing structural diversity and potential applications as functional materials in gas storage, separation processes, magnetism, drug delivery, catalysis, and chemical sensing [1–6]. This class of materials can be easily obtained through self-assembly of multidentate organic ligands as linkers and metal ions or metal clusters as connecting nodes. A great number of PCPs prepared using carboxylic acids with two or more carboxylate arms have been reported in this burgeoning field [7], and several of them (such as HKUST-1 and MIL-53) are available commercially. As part of ongoing research work on the PCPs of polycarboxylates in our group, several metal carboxylates with interesting properties have been successfully prepared [8]. Such interesting results have intrigued us to continue to explore the construction of PCPs based on other polycarboxylates, especially those possessing magnetic properties. A typical aromatic polycarboxylate ligand, isophthalic acid (H2ip) has been widely used to construct PCPs. It features two excellent characteristics as follows: (i) it has two carboxyl groups with a 120° angle between them, and thus can present versatile coordination modes and yield predetermined networks, and (ii) its carboxylate and phenyl groups can function as mediator for transmitting exchange interaction between paramagnetic metal centers. On the other hand, among the most commonly used transition metal elements in the realm of PCPs, manganese is attracting considerable attention because of its ability to function as a binder for constructing the coordination framework and as a progenitor of novel magnetic molecular materials. In the current paper, we report two manganese isophthalates, [Mn2(ip)2(dmf)]·dmf (1) and [Mn4(ip)4(dmf)6]·2dmf (2) (ip=isophthalate), which are solvothermally and liquid–liquid diffusion synthesized, respectively. Crystal structural data reveal that compound 1 adopts a three-dimensional structure containing (MnO) n inorganic chains, while compound 2 adopts a two-dimensional layered feature consisting of dimeric Mn2 building block units. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements exhibit weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the Mn(II) ions in both compounds. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and general methods All solvents and reagents were obtained from Aldrich or TCI and used without further purification. C, H, and N elemental microanalysis data were obtained using a Vario EL elemental analyzer. FT-IR spectra (KBr) were recorded in the range of 4000–400cm−1 on a Bruker IFS 66v/S Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer. 2.2 Syntheses 2.2.1 Synthesis of [Mn2(ip)2(dmf)]·dmf (1) H2ip (1.00mmol, 0.166g), MnCl2·4H2O (1.00mmol, 0.198g), and dmf (8.0mL) were successively added to a 23mL Teflon autoclave, and the formed mixture was then heated to 150°C in 2h and kept at this temperature for 3 days. After heating, it was allowed to cool to room temperature at a rate of 5°C per hour. A product in light yellow platelets was separated through filtration with yield of 75% based on the ligand. Anal.

Their structures were solved with direct methods using SIR 97. All compounds were expanded using Fourier techniques. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically with the full-matrix least-squares method on F 2. The hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically. All calculations were carried out on a SGI workstation using the teXsan crystallographic software package of Molecular Structure Corporation. The crystal parameters, data collection, and refinement results for compounds 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. 2.4 Magnetic susceptibility measurements Direct current (dc) magnetic measurements for powder crystalline samples of 1 and 2 were made on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer in the temperature range of 2–300K and with an applied field of 10kOe. Samples were packed in a gelatin capsule for the measurements. Magnetic susceptibility of the gelatin capsule was subtracted from the raw data in each sample. Diamagnetic susceptibility of the sample was corrected with the conventional Pascal method. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structures Single-crystal X-ray analysis indicates that complex 1 adopts a three-dimensional (3D) porous structure consisting of five-coordinate and six-coordinate manganese(II) atoms. As shown in Fig. 1, the asymmetric unit comprises of two halves of an octahedrally coordinated MnO6 unit that has crystallographically imposed inversion, one five-coordinate MnO5 unit, one μ2-bridging dmf molecule, two isophthalate ligands, and one uncoordinated free dmf molecule. The trigonal–bipyramidal geometry of Mn(1)O5 unit has one dmf O donor (O(9)) and four carboxyl O donors (O(1), O(3)#2, O(5) and O(8)#1) from two different ip moieties (symmetry operations: #1: −x+2, −y+1, −z+1; #2: x−1, y, z). The Mn(2)O6 unit is composed of six carboxylate O donors (O(2), O(2)#3, O(4)#2, O(4)#4, O(5) and O(5)#3), while the Mn(3)O6 unit consists of four carboxylate O donors (O(6), O(6)#6, O(7)#1 and O(7)#5) and two dmf O donors (O(9) and O(9)#6) (symmetry operations: #3: −x+2, −y, −z+2; #4: −x+3, −y, −z+2; #5: x, y, z+1; #6: −x+2, −y+1, −z+2). The O(9) and O(5) donors are bridged between Mn(1) and Mn(3), and Mn(1) and Mn(2), respectively, in a μ2–O fashion. In the lattice, infinite (MnO) n inorganic chains run parallel to the b axis and are interconnected by the organic ligands into a 3D structure to form an open 1D channels ( Fig. 2). According to Cheetham's classification, complex 1 is herein referred to as I1O2 (I=inorganic; O=organic) [9]. The free space accommodates one dmf molecule per formula unit. The void volume that may be generated after the removal of the coordinating dmf molecules is 23.6% (282.0Å3 out of the 1196.4Å3 unit cell volume) of the total volume as estimated by PLATON [10]. In spite of the porosity, the adsorption isotherm of N2 showed only surface adsorption at 77K. The asymmetric unit of complex 2 contains four octahedrally coordinated MnO6 units together with four isophthalate ligands, six coordinated dmf molecules, and two uncoordinated dmf molecules ( Fig. 3). Both Mn(1)O6 and Mn(3)O6 units have three dmf O donors (O(2), O(5) and O(22) for Mn(1), O(11), O(12) and O(13) for Mn(3)) and three carboxyl O donors (O(1), O(3)#1 and O(4) for Mn(1), O(9), O(10) and O(21)#2 for Mn(3)) from two different ip moieties, while Mn(2)O6 and Mn(4)O6 units have six carboxyl O donors from four different ip moieties (O(4), O(6), O(7), O(8), O(16) and O(19)#1 for Mn(2), O(10), O(14), O(15)#2, O(17)#3, O(18)#3 and O(20) for Mn(4)) (symmetry operations: #1: x, −y+1, z−1/2; #2: x, −y, z+1/2; #3: x, y−1, z). Mn(1) and Mn(2), also Mn(3) and Mn(4), are bridged between two carboxylate groups in the combination of syn–syn bidentate and monodentate μ2–O bridging modes, and the dimer units are linked by ip moieties with nearest interdimer separation of 8.175Å. The crosslinking of the MnO6 units via the benzene rings results in a 2D layered structure ( Fig. 4). Complex 2 would be a (I0O2) system. 3.2 Magnetic properties The magnetic behaviors of compounds 1 and 2, shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively, are characterized by χ M T and χ M in function of T. Magnetic measurements were carried out on powdered samples of 1 and 2 under an applied field of 10kOe in the temperature range of 2–300K. The χ M T value is 16.78emukmol−1 at 300K for compound 1. As the temperature decreases, the χ M product increases, whereas the χ M T product decreases continuously to a minimum value of 2.64emukmol−1 at 2K. It is linear above 20K in the 1/χ M vs. T plot of 1, where the Curie–Weiss law governs with C=17.18emukmol−1 and θ=−10.4K. The negative value of θ and an initial decrease in χ M T should be attributed to the overall antiferromagnetic coupling between the Mn(II) ions in compound 1. The magnetic behavior of 1 could not be analyzed theoretically because of its complicate bridging structure including syn–syn, ant–anti and syn–anti types of carboxylate bridges and μ2–O bridge. Similarly, the χ M T value for compound 2 is 15.0emukmol−1 at 300K. With decreasing temperature, the χ M vs. T curve shows a peak at 9K, while the χ M T product decreases continuously to a minimum value of 0.68emukmol−1 at 2K. The 1/χ M vs. T plot of 2 stays linear above 30K and is subject to the Curie–Weiss law with C=17.06emukmol−1 and θ=−32.7K. The negative value of θ and an initial decrease in χ M T should also be attributed to the overall antiferromagnetic coupling between the Mn(II) ions of compound 2. The magnetic behavior of 2 could be well analyzed using a dimer-of-dimers model for S=(5/2+5/2)2. Because the bridging structures of Mn(1)Mn(2) and Mn(3)Mn(4) dinuclear units are essentially the same, the spin Hamiltonian for the system is given by H =−2J(S 1 S 2+S 3 S 4), where J is the exchange interaction in the dinuclear units. Magnetic analysis was carried out using the following equation: χ M = 4 N g 2 β 2 k ( T − θ ) { 55 x 30 + 30 x 20 + 14 x 12 + 5 x 6 + x 2 11 x 30 + 9 x 20 + 7 x 12 + 5 x 6 + 3 x 2 + 1 ( 1 − ρ ) + 35 12 ρ } with x=exp(J/kT). In this equation, ρ is the fraction of Mn(II) paramagnetic impurity, θ is the correction term including inter-dimer interaction, and the remaining symbols have their usual physical meanings. As shown in Fig. 6, the magnetic behavior of 2 is well simulated with the following parameters, J=−1.68cm−1, g=1.93, ρ=0.018, and θ=0.00K. Although the g value is slightly small, the simulation suggests that a weak intra-dimer antiferromagnetic interaction operates between Mn(II) ions and the dimer units are magnetically independent of each other. 4 Conclusions We have successfully and selectively synthesized two coordination polymers of manganese isophthalate, namely, [Mn2(ip)2(dmf)]·dmf (1) and [Mn4(ip)4(dmf)6]·2dmf (2) with solvothermal or liquid–liquid diffusion methods. X-ray crystallographic studies reveal these compounds 1 and 2 form a 3D framework with 1D channel and a 2D layered structure, respectively. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements exhibit overall weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the Mn(II) ions in both compounds.
