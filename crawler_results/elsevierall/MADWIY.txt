Tel.: +81060672102332x4119; fax: +81-6-7232721 Four copper(I) complexes of 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane have been synthesized and their molecular structures determined by X-ray crystallography. Complexes 1 and 2 are 3D networks with elliptical channels along a-axis. Complexes 3 and 4 are 2D porous sheet networks. Importantly, complexes 1 and 2 can reversibly incorporate guest acetonitriles without collapse of structures, and the original frameworks of 1 and 2 are completely recovered after incorporation of guests. Four copper(I) complexes of 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane (dtpcp), [CuI(dtpcp)]·MeCN (1), [CuBr(dtpcp)]·MeCN (2), [CuCl(dtpcp)]·MeCN (3) and [Cu2I2(dtpcp)2]·Me-thf (4) (Me-thf=2-methyltetrahydrofuran), have been synthesized and their molecular structures determined by X-ray crystallography. Complexes 1 and 2 are isostructural, and exhibit 3D networks with elliptical channels along a-axis, which are constructed by dtpcp molecules bridging zigzag CuI and CuBr chains, respectively. Complexes 3 and 4 are 2D porous sheet networks constructed by bridging the zigzag copper-dtpcp chains via rhombic ring of Cu2X2 (X=Cl or I). All sheets in 3 are packed in an eclipsed manner through π–π stackings to generate channels along the a-axis. However, the 2D porous sheets in 4 are packed in an offset mode such that channels are not formed along c-axis. Complexes 1 and 2 can reversibly incorporate guest acetonitriles without collapse of structures, and the original frameworks of 1 and 2 are completely recovered after incorporation of guests which are confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern and 1H NMR spectrum. Additionally, complex 1 exhibits selectivity in size and polarity for guest inclusion. 1 Introduction Metal-organic frameworks containing channels or voids have attracted current interest because of their functional properties, which are similar to those of zeolites and clays [1–10]. The robustness and permanent porosity are essential for successful performance of these functions, Robust structures, in which building blocks are tightly held together, are however inconsistent with those display reversible inclusion and removal of guest molecules [11–13]. The robust frameworks of coordination compounds usually result only in structural beauty, apart from effective use of voids. In contrast, the flexible and dynamic porous coordination polymers are potential application for the gas storage, ion-exchange or adsorption and separation [14–19]. Many flexible porous coordination polymers, most of which are featured N- or O- donor bridging ligand, have been hitherto synthesized and their porous functions have been investigated [3–10,20–24]. However, no flexible porous framework which is constructed by 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane (dtpcp) has been reported so far. As a kind of cyclophane, 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane has received relatively little attention about its coordination chemistry, although the cyclophane theory is well established [25,26]. Initial studies were concerned with the presence of transannular electric effects and high molecular strain [27], and considerable attention has been devoted to the rational synthesis of the polymeric transition-metal cyclophane complexes with potential interesting electrical properties and possible conductivity [28,29]. Conversely, reports on polymeric metal complexes of thia-bridged cyclophanes are still sparse [30,31], and those on their potential for applications in adsorption and separation remain unknown. Previously we have reported four polymeric copper and silver complexes of 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane [30,31]. Here, we report four porous frameworks obtained by reaction of copper(I) salt with 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane, [CuI(dtpcp)]·MeCN (1), [CuBr(dtpcp)]·MeCN (2), [CuCl(dtpcp)]·MeCN (3) and [Cu2I2(dtpcp)2]·Me-thf (4). Complexes 1 and 2 can reversibly incorporate guest molecules without collapse of structure. The reversible incorporation of the guests into the complex was demonstrated by 1H NMR spectrum and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern. 2 Experimental 2.1 General procedures Preparations were performed under an argon atmosphere using usual Schlenk techniques. All solvents were dried and deoxygenated by standard methods prior to use. The standard chemicals and reagent-grade 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane were obtained from Wako Chemical Co., Japan, and used without further purification. Infrared spectra were measured as KBr discs on a JASCO FT/IR-8000 spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were measured on a JEOL GSX 270 FT NMR spectrometer at room temperature. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal reference for 1H NMR measurement. Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses were performed at 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen on Rigaku Thermo plus TG 8120. XRPD data were recorded on a Rigaku Rint 2000 diffractometer at 40 kV, 80 mA for Cu Kα (λ=1.54056 Å), with a scan speed of 8°/min and step size of 0.06° in 2θ at room temperature. XRPD data were reported for the most prominent lines with d-spacings in angstroms and the relative intensities placed in parentheses followed by their hkl assignments. 2.2 Syntheses 2.2.1 [CuI(dtpcp)]·MeCN (1) A solution of mesitylene (10 mL) containing 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane (27.7 mg, 0.1 mmol) was poured into a 7 mm diameter glass tube and then layered with a CH3CN solution (10 mL) of CuI (19.0 mg, 0.1 mmol). The glass tube was sealed under argon. After standing at room temperature for 1 week, colorless brick crystals of complex 1 were obtained at the interface between the two solutions. Anal.

Then a dilute solution (10 mL) of CuI (19.0 mg, 0.1 mmol) in MeCN was added gently to avoid possible mixing.

The intensities of three reflections were monitored regularly after the measurement of 150 reflections and indicated crystal stability in all cases. An empirical absorption correction based on azimuthal scans was applied which resulted in transmission factors ranging from 0.67 to 0.78 for 1, from 0.47 to 0.60 for 2, from 0.78 to 0.88 for 3, and from 0.70 to 0.81 for 4, respectively. All intensity data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The structures were solved by direct methods [32], expanded using Fourier techniques [33], and refined by], full matrix least-squares analysis on F using the TEXSAN package [34]. All the full-occupancy non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms of all the structure were introduced in their calculated positions. They were included but not refined in the refinement. Details of X-ray experiments and crystal data are summarized in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in Table 2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Description of the structures 3.1.1 [CuI(dtpcp)]MeCN (1) and [CuBr(dtpcp)]·MeCN (2) The X-ray analysis of 1 showed a 3D framework as depicted in Fig. 1(a) together with atom numbering scheme. The tetrahedral copper(I) is coordinated to two iodide ions and one sulfur atom of two different dtpcp molecules. The Cu–S distances of 2.3371(9) Å, and Cu–I distances of 2.640(1) and 2.6318 Å are comparable with those of the analogous complexes [29]. The copper ions and iodide ions are bridged alternately to form a –Cu–I–Cu–I– zigzag chain. The two symmetry-related dtpcp molecules which are bound to the same copper atom are well separated, and the adjacent pair of such dtpcp molecules are located in opposite direction to minimize steric hindrance. Dtpcp act as linking ligands and bridge these zigzag chains to form a 3D network with elliptical channels of 4.2 Å×6.6 Å along the a-axis, in which one molecule acetonitrile per copper ion is included (Fig. 1(b) and (c)). Interestingly, every two adjacent acetonitriles are arranged in the opposite direction in order to minimize the steric hindrance of methyl, and all acetonitriles are aligned along the extending direction of channels and parallel to each other. These guest molecules are included by weak interactions between host dtpcp and guest acetonitrile with C–N separation of 3.61 Å [35]. Complex 2 is isostructural with complex 1, which is confirmed by the X-ray crystallographic determination. 2D sheet network of [Cu2I2(dtpcp)2]·thf [30] with cavities were obtained by slow diffusion of dtpcp in thf and acetonitrile solution of CuI using a 1 : 1 molar ratio. However, changing of the solvent from thf to mesitylene leads to a 3D framework of complex 1 with elliptical channels, indicating the versatile coordination fashion of dtpcp and CuI. Generally, the dinuclear structure bridged by halide ions is very common in copper(I) complexes [36]. The formation of zigzag single chains of CuI in complexes 1 and 2 is unique for iodide or bromide-bridged copper complexes [37]. 3.1.2 [CuCl(dtpcp)]·MeCN (3) The molecular structure and atom numbering scheme of complex 3 are given in Fig. 2(a) . Unlike complexes 1 and 2, two chloride ions coordinate to copper (I) to form a Cu2Cl2 ring with Cu(1)–Cu(2) separation of 2.98 Å and Cl(1)–Cl(2) 3.72 Å. Cu–Cl bond lengths of 2.351(1) Å and 2.4145(9) Å are longer than those of previously reported [CuCl2(dtpcp)](EtOH) [30], while the Cu–S distances of 2.256(1) and 2.276(1) Å are shorter than it. Each dtpcp fragment bridges two separate copper ions through two sulfur donors to give a 1–D –Cu–dtpcp–chain, and chloride ions bridge these chains via Cu2Cl2 rings to afford a 2D porous network (Fig. 2(b)). Compared with previously reported [Cu2I2(dtpcp)2]·thf, the 2D porous sheets in 3 are packed on each other in an eclipsed manner to create 1D channels along the a-axis with a size of 5.2 Å×3.1 Å, in which one acetonitrile molecule per copper ion is included (Figs. 2(b), (c) and 3 ). However, the guest molecules are not firmly fixed by hydrogen bonds or other interactions, but weakly included (the distance of C–N between host dtpcp and guest acetonitrile is 4.67 Å). The distance of 3.3 Å between the planes of the nearest-neighbor dtpcp ligands indicates the presence of strong π–π stacking interactions between the adjacent layers. It is same to 1 and 2 that all guest acetonitriles in the same channel are perpendicular to the extending direction of channels and parallel to each other. However, they are fallen into two lines, and the directions of acetonitriles in the two lines are completely opposite as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c). 3.1.3 [Cu2I2(dtpcp)2]·Me-thf (4) An ORTEP drawing of the structure around the copper in 4 with the atom numbering scheme is shown in Fig. 4(a) . Each copper(I) ion is tetrahedrally coordinated to two iodide ions and one sulfur donor of two distinct dtpcp molecules and is isostructural with [Cu2I2(dtpcp)2]·thf reported previously [29], which is confirmed by the X-ray crystallographic determination. The bond distances of the two independent copper atoms in Table 2 are comparable. Two iodide ions bridge pairs of copper atoms to form a rhombic Cu2I2 ring with Cu(1)–Cu(2) separation of 3.05 Å and I(1)–I(2) 4.39 Å. The two symmetry-related dtpcp molecules which are bound to the same copper atom are well separated to minimize steric interaction with S–Cu–S bond angels of 119.61(10)° for Cu(1) and 127.14(9)° for Cu(2), respectively. The crystallographic structure of 4 illustrates a 2D porous network spreading out along ab-plane, based on dinuclear [Cu2I2(dtpcp)2] units as shown in Fig. 4(b). A cavity of 5.0 Å×4.0 Å consisting of six copper atoms and four dtpcp molecules is formed, in which one Me-thf molecule per formula is located via weak hydrogen bond with C–O distance of 3.39 Å [38]. The adjacent layer is stacked on top of this layer with an offset in the ab plane such that continuous tunnels along the c-axis are not formed as shown in Fig. 4(c). The distance of the adjacent layers is 5.8 Å, indicating no interactions between interlayers. 3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis To examine the liberation of guests, TG analyses for complexes 1–4 were carried out, and all complexes showed two stages for release of the included guests. TG curve of 1 illustrates that the weight loss of 3.1% occurs for the first stage from 60 to 130 °C, which corresponds to 38% of acetonitriles in 1, and the weight loss of 4.9% is from 130 to 200 °C, which corresponds to 60% of acetonitrile. A total weight loss of 8.0% (Calc. 8.2%) in the two stages indicates the elimination of one acetonitrile molecule per formula unit. Likewise, a total weight loss of 8.8% (Calc. 9.0%) shows the complete release of guest acetonitriles for complex 2. TG analysis shows that complex 3 exhibits a weight loss of 3.5% for the first stage from 20–130 °C, and then a fairly rapid weight loss of 3.8% for the second stage from 130–150 °C. No further weight loss is observed from 150–200 °C. However, a total weight loss of 7.3% is much less than that of calculated 10.0%, which indicates some guest acetonitriles are released at room temperature before TG measurement and is in agreement with the lower percentage of nitrogen in element analysis. Complex 4 show the weight loss of 3.9% for the first stage at 100–160 °C, and then 4.9% for the second stage at 160–205 °C, respectively. The total weight loss of 8.8% for complex 4 is a little more than the calculated 8.4%, indicating accompanied by dissociation of 4. Nevertheless, the above findings illustrate that all guest molecules in complexes 1–4 can be liberated with the increasing temperature. It is noteworthy that the desorption temperature of complex 3 (150 °C) is much lower than that of the other three complexes (185, 200 or 205 °C), which may be attributable to the lack of hydrogen bonds or other weak interactions between guests and hosts in 3. 3.3 Elimination and incorporation of guest molecules According to the above TG analysis, we can easily obtain the guest-eliminated complexes 1a-4a as shown in Section 2. The complete elimination of guests is supported by 1H NMR spectra in d5-pyridine before and after desorption. 1H NMR resonances of acetonitrile were observed in 1, but not in 1a (Fig. 5(a) and (b) ). Fig. 6(a) and (c) shows the simulated powder pattern obtained upon the single crystal data of 1, observed XRPD pattern of as-synthesized sample 1 and observed XRPD pattern of 1a. The XRPD pattern of 1a has diffraction peaks which are not broad, indicating that the channel framework is largely maintained even without guests, although the initial framework of 1 is a little different from that of 1a. Peaks between 5 and 25° shift to the lower angle region. The unit cell c (a=7.201, b=19.789, c=15.013 Å) of 1a, which is obtained on the base of the XRPD pattern of 1a, is longer than that of 1 (a=7.201, b=20.784, c=12.400 Å), whereas the unit cell b of 1a is shorter than that of 1. This result indicates apparent increase of the channel size along the c-axis and decrease along the b-axis, exhibiting the deformation of the channels in the absence of guests. Importantly, the original framework of 1 can be recovered by immersing 1a in acetonitrile for 3 days, which was confirmed by 1H NMR spectra and XRPD patterns as shown in Figs. 5(c) and 6. 1H NMR resonances of acetonitrile were observed in complex 1b. In light of 1H NMR spectra, one molecule acetonitrile per formula unit is incorporated in complex 1a. The XRPD of 1b is virtually identical to that of the original solid 1, not only with respect to the positions of the peaks, but also the sharpness of the lines (Fig. 6(b) and (d)), which indicates that the original framework of 1 is completely recovered after reincorporation of acetonitriles in 1a. These findings show the reversible incorporation of acetonitrile in 1. In cases of 2, 2a and 2b, the same phenomenon was observed (see Section 4). 1H NMR spectra of acetonitrile and Me-thf were observed in 3 and 4, respectively, but were not observed in 3a and 4a, showing complete elimination of acetonitrile and Me-thf. Fig. 7(c) shows the XRPD pattern of 3a. The sharp peaks illustrate that the channel framework is not essentially collapsed after liberation of guests. But they are different from those of 3, indicating the structural deformation of 3 after removal of guests. The XRPD pattern of 4a shows the broad peaks and very difference from that of 4 in the intensity as shown in Fig. 8(b) and (c) , which indicates that a part of porous framework are possibly collapsed as a result of liberating Me-thf. Unlike complexes 1 and 2, the original frameworks of 3 and 4 were not recovered after incorporation of guests. Although 1H NMR resonances of acetonitrile and Me-thf can be observed in complexes 3b and 4b, respectively, only 0.3 molecule acetonitrile per formula unit, and 0.4 molecule Me-thf per formula unit were included in complexes 3a and 4a, respectively, which further illustrates the partly collapse or deformation of 3 and 4 in absence of guests. The XRPD pattern of 3b is quite different from that of 3 or 3a (Fig. 7), for instance, the peaks between 0 and 10 disappear in 3b and show an apparent shift to the higher angle region, which illustrates the shrinking or collapse of layer gap along a-axis and the original framework of 3 is not recovered after inclusion of acetonitriles. However, the presence of sharp peaks in 3b predicts that 3b gives the other structure different from both 3 and 3a, after incorporation of acetonitriles. Fig. 8(d) shows the XRPD pattern of 4b, which is essentially same to that of 4 in the positions, but weaker than it in the intensities. These observations show the permanent collapse of some 2D layered framework of 4 after release of Me-thf, and are consistent with the results of 1H NMR spectra as described above, indicating the instability of 2D layer structures of 4. It should be emphasized that complexes 1 and 2 can reversibly incorporated guest molecules without collapse of channel frameworks, and the original structures are recovered after incorporation of acetonitriles. The reversible structural changes of 1 → 1a → 1b (=1) or 2 → 2a → 2b (=2) can take place, showing the flexibility of 3D structures of 1 and 2. 3.4 Selective inclusion of guests Complexes 1 and 2 can reversibly incorporate acetonitrile as described above, which prompt us to examine guest selectivity for organic compounds which are classified into three groups according to the shape/size: • Group I: acyclic compounds (methanol, dichloromethane, acetone, ether, trichloromethane, ethanol, 1-propanol). • Group II: aromatic compounds (benzene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene) • Group III: cyclic compounds (cyclohexane, cyclopentane) Complex 1a was immersed in the solvent of each compound for 3 days and 1H NMR spectra were measured. 1H NMR resonances of compounds of groups II and III were not observed in d5-pyridine, indicating compounds of groups II and III can not be included in 1a. On the other hand, three compounds of group I, which are acetone, methanol and dichloromethane, exhibit guest inclusion. By considering the fact that the three compounds are similar to acetonitrile in size and polarity, channels 1a exhibits selectivity in size as well as polarity. In conclusion, four copper(I) complexes of 2,11-dithia [3.3]paracyclophane are reported in this paper. Complexes 1 and 2 are isostructural, flexible 3D network with hydrophobic channels, which show reversible inclusion of guest acetonitriles without collapse of structures. The original frameworks of 1 and 2 are virtually recovered after incorporation of guests. Complexes 3 and 4 are unstable 2D layered structures. Importantly, complex 1 exhibits selectivity in size and polarity, indicating the potential application in adsorption and separation. The complexes presented here, beyond being four examples of supramolecular inclusion complexes, are members of an entire new family of hosts. In contrast to the transition-metal cyclophane system, in which the coordination of cyclophanes is almost exclusively through delocalized π electrons of the two aromatic decks, the coordination of dithia-bridged paracyclophane involves exclusively the two sulfur atoms rather than the delocalized π electrons. These results prompt us that thia-bridged paracyclophane may be a very rich field for exploring inclusion complexes, if a second bridging ligand is present. Further investigations in this domain are in progress. 4 Supplementary material Crystallographic data for the X-ray crystal structural analysis have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, CCDC Nos.
