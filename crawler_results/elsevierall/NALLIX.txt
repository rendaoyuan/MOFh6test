A novel two-dimensional (2D) Mn(II) coordination polymer [Mn1.5(H2bdc)1.5(DMA)2] (1; H2bdc=terephthalic acid; DMA=N,N′-dimethylacetamide) based on trinuclear manganese subunit has been solvothermally prepared and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 1 exhibits a rare layered structure with 6-connected hxl topology constructed from the trinuclear Mn3(COO)6 units, and further stacking of layers leads to a 3D supramolecular framework. The thermalgravimetric behavior and magnetic property of 1 have been also investigated. The magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that the compound exhibits antiferromagnetic coupling interactions. Graphical abstract Presented here is a novel two-dimensional (2D) Mn(II) coordination polymer constructed from trinuclear manganese subunits, which exhibits a rare layered structure with hxl topology and antiferromagnetic property. Highlights ► A novel two-dimensional (2D) Mn(II) coordination polymer constructed from trinuclear manganese subunits. ► A rare layered structure with 6-connected hxl topology. ► Antiferromagnetic coupling interactions between Mn centers in the trinuclear Mn unit. Keywords Manganese Solvothermal synthesis Coordination polymer Magnetic property Recently, the synthetic design of functional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a burgeoning field within the scientific community [1–5]. This has arisen not only for their versatile intriguing topological structures, but also for their unique properties for potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis, gas sorption, storage and separations, molecular recognition, non-linear optics, ion exchange, fluorescence and magnetism [6–14]. It has been found that organic ligands and metals play crucial roles in the designed synthesis of some target coordination networks. Coordination polymers with paramagnetic metal ions or clusters and the appropriate multidentate aromatic ligands are of high interest as these can lead to novel framework structures with potential applications in the area of molecular magnetism. Such frameworks may be considered as hybrids between classical multi-dimensional magnetic solids and molecular magnets [15,16]. In this context, our aim is to synthesize novel coordination polymers containing metal ions and dicarboxylate ligands, and then to enhance the knowledge of the correlation between structure and magnetism in coordination polymers. Herein, we report the synthesis and structure of a new Mn(II) teraphthalate coordination polymer [Mn1.5(H2bdc)1.5(DMA)2] (1; H2bdc=terephthalic acid; DMA=N,N′-dimethylacetamide), which shows rare layered structure with 6-connected hxl topology constructed from the trinuclear Mn3(COO)6 units. Its thermal behavior and magnetic property are also discussed. Compound 1 is solvothermally synthesized through the reaction of Mn(NO3)2, terephthalic acid, 1H-benzotriazole and pyrazine in N,N′-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and methanol solvents at 100°C for 5days [17]. A single-crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that 1 crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/n [18]. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of two independent Mn atoms, two H2bdc ligands and two DMA molecules. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, both Mn1 and Mn2 centers are six-coordinate and exhibit octahedral geometry, but their coordination environments are different. Mn1 is bonded by six oxygen atoms from six bidentate carboxylate groups of six H2bdc ligands to furnish an octahedral geometric configuration with the Mn1–O bond lengths in the range from 2.130(3)Å to 2.202(3)Å and the O–Mn1–O bond angles range from 87.19(14)o to 180.0(2)o. While Mn2 is six coordinated by four oxygen atoms from three carboxylate groups of three H2bdc ligands and two DMA molecules to furnish an octahedral geometric configuration with the Mn2–O bond lengths in the range from 2.082(4)Å to 2.310(3)Å and the O–Mn2–O bond angles range from 82.50(16)o to 172.54(15)o. In the structure of 1, Mn1 locates at a special site with a symmetry center, so that another symmetry-related Mn2 center is generated. Three Mn centers are in a line and bridged by six H2bdc ligands, resulting in a trinuclear Mn3(COO)6 unit with the shortest Mn…Mn distance being 3.614Å. (Fig. 1b). Each resulting trinuclear Mn3(COO)6 unit is further linked to six neighboring ones by six H2bdc ligands, which produces a layer as shown in Fig. 1c. From the viewpoint of topology, this layer can be reduced as a 6-connected uninodal net (denoted: hxl) by considering the trinuclear manganese subunit as a 6-connected node and the H2bdc ligand as a linker (Figure S1). To our knowledge, although some hxl-type layers based on simple 6-coordinate metal centers are known, such kind of hxl-type layers constructed from trinuclear units are rarely reported. Furthermore, the parallel stacking of the layers results in a three-dimensional framework, and there are no obvious interactions between the layers. Interestingly, the layer in 1 has helical sub-structures. As shown in Fig. 1d, both P-helix and M-helix are observed in the layer along the b axis. These P- and M-helices are arranged equally and therefore the whole construction does not possess chirality. The phase purity of 1 was confirmed by similarities between its simulated and experimental powder X-ray diffraction (Figure S2). To evaluate the thermal behavior, thermalgravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 was performed under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 in the temperature range 20–800°C (Figure S3). The TGA curve remained unchanged up to 120°C. Beyond this temperature, there are three steps of weight loss. The first and second weight loss of 29.5% from 120°C to 360°C may correspond to the release of the coordinated DMA molecules. The third step of weight loss corresponds to the decomposition of the H2bdc ligands, and the framework is thus collapsed over 480°C. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility data for 1 is presented in Fig. 2 . According to the χ M −1–T curve, the magnetic susceptibility data for 1 can be fitted well to the Curie–Weiss law in the range 2–300K with a Curie constant C=13.02cm3 Kmol−1 and a Weiss temperature θ=−17.36K. The value of χ M T decreases gradually from 12.34 at room temperature to 4.03cm3 Kmol−1 at 2K. The room temperature value is slightly lower than the expected value of 13.13cm3 Kmol−1 for per tri-Mn(II) unit, each with Si =5/2 and gi =2. These results reveal that the effective magnetic moments per Mn ion (μ eff) is 9.94 (actual value, 10.24) at room temperature. Such magnetic behavior shows antiferromagnetic couplings between the MnII ions. The interaction of the three magnetic ions in 1, where the coupling constants for the intermetal interactions are as indicated, is governed by the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (1) [19,20]: (1) H = − 2 J 1 ( S 1 S 2 + S 2 S 3 ) Where J 1 represents the exchange interactions and the S 1, S 2 and S 3 are classical spin vectors. The fitting led to the following parameters: g=1.99, J 1 =−0.96cm−1, R=5.58×10−3. The J 1 value indicates antiferromagnetic coupling mediated by the carboxylate bridges. In conclusion, a new Mn(II) terephthalate coordination polymer based on trinuclear manganese subunit has been solvothermally synthesized. Its structure has interesting hxl topology and helices. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibilities indicate antiferromagnetic couplings between the MnII ions.
