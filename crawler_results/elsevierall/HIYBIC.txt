Hydrothermal reactions of Pb2+ ion with disodium 4,4'-bis(2-sulfonatostyryl)biphenyl (Na2L1), 4-pyridyl-CH2N(CH2COOH)(CH2PO3 H2) (H3L2) and 4,4'-bipyridine (4,4'-bipy) afforded two new lead sulfonates, namely, [Pb4(L1)2(HL2)2(H2O)]]·3H2O (1) and (4,4'-bipyH)[Pb(4,4'-bipyH)(L1)2(H2O)2]·2H2O (2). Compound 1 is a sandwich-like 2D hybrid layer containing hexanuclear lead clusters and 1D channel. The 1D channel is occupied by pyridine groups and free water molecules. In compound 2, the mononuclear Pb units are assembled into a 2D layer through hydrogen bondings. Solid 1 is thermally stable up to 170°C under an air atmosphere. Luminescent properties of solids 1 and 2 have also been studied. Graphical abstract A new lead sulfonate with sandwich-like 2D hybrid layer consisting of hexanuclear lead clusters and 1D channels. Keywords Lead Sulfonate Syntheses Structure Luminescence 1 Introduction Metal–ligand complexes have been of great interest in recent years for their interesting structures and potential applications as gas adsorbents, catalysis, conductor, non-linear optics, magnet and so on [1–4]. Meanwhile, a large number of lead frameworks have been synthesized from various organic ligands containing N/O/S donors [5–9]. This is due to the Pb2+ ion has a stereochemically active lone pair electrons and a variable coordination number and geometry. By contrast, relatively less attention has been paid to lead organosulfonates [10–12]. On the other hand, some interesting luminescent sulfonates have been assembled from disodium 4,4'-bis(2-sulfonatostiryl)biphenyl (denoted as Na2L1), which is a stilbene-type fluorescent whitener [13–17]. Such as [Cd(4,4'-bipy)(L1)(H2O)2] and [Zn(4,4'-bipy)(H2O)4][Zn(4,4'-bipy)1.5(L1)(H2O)2]2(L1)·6H2O display bright blue–green and green luminescence, respectively. These emissions show bathochromic-shift compared to the blue luminescence of Na2L1. Based on above results, we suggest that the combination of Pb2+ ion and L12− anion, along with other second ligands, would obtain new lead organosulfonates with interesting structures and luminescent properties. In this paper, we report synthesis, structures, thermal stabilities and luminescence of two new lead sulfonates: [Pb4(L1)2(HL2)2(H2O)]]·3H2O (1) and (4,4'-bipyH)[Pb(4,4'-bipyH)(L1)2 (H2O)2]·2H2O (2). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and characterizations H3L2 was prepared by N-alkylation reaction. Other chemicals were purchased from commercial sources without further purification. Elemental analyses were carried out with a Vario EL III element analyzer. Infrared spectra were obtained on a Nicolet Magna 750 FT-IR spectrometer.

Data of 1–2 were reduced with CrystalClear v1.3. These structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F 2 using SHELXTL-97 [18]. All non-hydrogen atoms were treated anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms of carbon and nitrogen atoms were generated geometrically. No attempts were performed to locate hydrogen atoms of water molecules. Crystallographic data for 1–2 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for 1 and 2 are listed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Hydrogen bonding lengths and angles for 1 and 2 are listed in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. CCDC 957031 (1) and CCDC 957032 (2). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural descriptions The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of four crystallographically independent Pb(II) atoms, two L12− and two HL22− anions, one coordinated and three free water molecules ( Fig. 1a). Pb1 is surrounded by one L12− and two HL22 anions into a distorted [ψ-PbNO4] octahedral geometry with the lone pair electrons occupying the sixth coordination site. One HL22− anion is chelated to Pb1 via one nitrogen donor (N1a), one phosphonate (O3a) and one carboxylate oxygen atoms (O5a), resulting in a Pb–O–P–C–N and a Pb–O–C–C–N rings. This mode is same to those in [Zn3(L2)2]·2H2O, [Pb3(L2)2(H2O)2]·H2O, (H3O)4[Cd7(L2)6]·16H2O, (H3O)4[Mn7(L2)6]·17H2O, [Co(HL2)(H2O)]·2H2O and [Ni(HL2)(H2O)]·2H2O.[19, 20] The O3a atom locates the polar site of [ψ-PbNO4] octahedron. While the other two basal sites are occupied by another phosphonate oxygen atom (O2) from the second HL22− anion and a sulfonate oxygen atom (O11) from the L12− anion. It is attractive that the Pb1 ion is simultaneously coordinated by sulfonate, phosphonate and carboxylate functional groups. To the best of our knowledge, this coordination mode has not been described before. Pb2 is in a [PbO6] coordination geometry, which is defined by three phosphonate oxygen atoms (O1, O6b, O7) and one carboxylate oxygen atom (O4a) from four HL22− anions, a sulfonate oxygen atom (O12a) from one L12− anion, as well as one coordinated water molecule (O23b). Pb3 is enclosed into a [PbO7] coordination geometry through two L12− anions, three HL22− anions and one coordinated water molecule (O23). Each L12− anions contacts with Pb3 ion with one sulfonate oxygen atom. And two HL22− anions are also interacted with Pb3 with one phosphonate oxygen atom (O4a and O8b), respectively. While the third HL22− anion is chelated to Pb3 through two phosphonate oxygen atoms (O6 and O7). The coordination environment of Pb4 is same to that of Pb1. The coordination polyhedra of all four Pb(II) atoms are distorted due to the presence of the stereochemically active 6S2 lone-pair electrons on the Pb2+ ion. The bond lengths of Pb–O and Pb–N lie in the range of 2.267(5)–2.734(7) and 2.609(7)–2.683(7)Å, respectively. One L12− anion displays a bidentate mode to connect two Pb(II) atoms. While the other L12− anion shows a tridentate mode to link three Pb(II) ions. Moreover, the two HL22− anions exhibit a hexadentate and a pentadentate modes to bridge six and five Pb(II) ions, respectively. On the other hand, the protonated pyridine rings of HL22− anions provide hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen bondings with sulfonate oxygen atom (O15b) and the free water molecule (O26a). As shown in Fig. 1b, the interactions among Pb ions are quite complicated and listed as follows. [Pb2O6] polyhedra shares an edge with [Pb3O7] through a pair of oxygen atoms (O4a and O7). And [Pb2O6] also shares an edge with the other [Pb3bO7] through a phosphonate oxygen atom (O6b) and a coordinated water molecule (O23b). As a result, the distances of Pb2⋯Pb3 and Pb2⋯Pb3b are 4.000 and 4.294Å, respectively. On the other hand, each [Pb3O7] also shares two edges with neighboring two [Pb2O6] polyhedra, respectively. Furthermore, the [ψ-Pb4NO4] octahedron shares two corners with one [Pb2O6] and one [Pb3O7] polyhedra. The distances of Pb4⋯Pb2 and Pb4⋯Pb3 are 4.345 and 4.223Å, respectively. Thus, a Pb6 hexanuclear cluster is formed. To the best of our knowledge, such hexanuclear lead cluster has not been reported in previous work. The Pb6 hexanuclear clusters and the [ψ-Pb1NO4] octahedra are held by [PCO3] tetrahedron through corner-sharings along a axis into a chain (Fig. 1c). And the chain are bridged together by the L12− anions into a sandwich-like 2D hybrid layer with 1D channel along the a axis (Fig. 1d). The channel is occupied by pyridine groups and free water molecules. The asymmetric unit of 2 includes one Pb(II) atom, two L12− anions, one coordinated 4,4'-bipyH group, one free 4,4'-bipyH group, two coordinated and two free water molecules ( Fig. 2a). Pb1 is surrounded by two L12− anions, one coordinated 4,4'-bipyH group and two coordianted water molecules. Pb1 is in a distorted [ψ-PbNO4] octahedral geometry with the lone pair electrons occupying the polar site. The coordinated water molecule (O13) locates the other polar site of [ψ-PbNO4] octahedron. Each L12− anion contacts with Pb1 via a sulfonate oxygen atom (O1 and O7), which locate two basal sites of [ψ-PbO4N] octahedron. While the other two basal sites are occupied by the other coordinated water molecule (O14) and a nitrogen donor (N1). Both L12− anions exhibit a monodentate mode to bridge one Pb(II) atom. This is different from those in solid 1. Both protonated 4,4'-bipyH group provide the hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen bondings with the sulfonate oxygen atoms. On the other hand, all water molecules also provide the hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen bondings with the sulfonate oxygen atoms and the nitrogen donor. Thus, the mononuclear Pb units are connected by such hydrogen bondings into a 2D layer (Fig. 2b). 3.2 Thermal stability Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of solid 1 indicates that under an air atmosphere an initial step occurs from 50 to 160°C with 2.45% weight loss, which is attributed to the loss of three free water molecules per formula (calculated 2.20%). Upon further heating, little weight loss appears until an abrupt stage starts from 230°C. This is due to the loss of the coordinated water molecule, along with the decomposition of L12− and HL22− groups, resulting in the collapse of the 2D framework. In addition, unit cell parameters of solid 1–170 are a=14.25, b=14.44, c=19.27Å, α=99.58, β=90.08, γ=97.86, V=3872Å3, which are similar to those of pristine 1. This illustrates that the framework of solid 1 behaves thermally stable up to 170°C under an air atmosphere. 3.3 Luminescent properties Solid-state luminescent properties of solids 1 and 2 were investigated under ambient temperature. Solid 1 displays weak blue luminescence with a maximum band at 460nm and a shoulder peak at 483nm upon excitation at 280nm ( Fig. 3). The emission profile of solid 1 is similar to those of Na2L1 and [Zn2(Im)2(ImH)4](L1) (ImH=imidazole) [15]. In addition, no any emission for 0.002M of Na3L2 solution and [Pb3(L2)2(H2O)2]∙H2O can be detected under our experiment [19,20]. So the weak blue luminescence of solid 1 may be originated from a intraligand π–π ⁎ transition of L12− anion. In addition, compound 1 can also emit same weak blue luminescence upon excitation at 365nm, according to the broad excitation spectrum displaying two peaks at 279 and 365nm.While solid 2 displays yellow luminescence with a maximum band at 585nm upon excitation at 380nm. The emission spectrum is very broad. The FWHM (full width at half maximum) is 205nm. There is an interesting luminescent character of solid 2 which exhibits about 133 and 155nm bathochromic-shift compared to those of Na2L and 4,4'-bipy, respectively. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have described the syntheses, structures and properties of two new lead complexes, [Pb4(L1)2(HL2)2(H2O)]∙3H2O (1) and (4,4'-bipyH)[Pb(4,4'-bipyH) (L1)2(H2O)2]∙2H2O (2). Compound 1 is a sandwich-like 2D hybrid layer with 1D channels, which are occupied by pyridine groups and free water molecules. In compound 2, the mononuclear Pb units are connected by hydrogen bondings into a 2D layer. Solid 1 behaves thermally stable up to 170°C under an air atmosphere and displays weak blue luminescence. While solid 2 can emit yellow luminescence. Future efforts are focused on introducing other organic ligands to expand metal sulfonates and investigate the relationship between structures and properties.
