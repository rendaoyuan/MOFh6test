Graphical abstract Four Hg(II)-containing complexes have been synthesized and characterized. Complexes 1, 2 and 3 exhibit the same 1-D double helical structures. After changing the solvent, a trinuclear cage-like 4 which is isomeric with 3 is obtained. The solvent effects were studies by theoretical calculation. Their fluorescence properties are also investigated. Highlights ► Four Hg(II)-containing complexes have been synthesized and characterized. ► Complex 4 is isomeric with 3 and they are obtained from different solvent. ► Calculated results prove that solvent effects have influence on their structures. ► Halide anions of complexes have different impacts on their fluorescence properties. Four Hg(II)-containing complexes based on methylenebis(1,1′-benzimidazole) (mbbz), namely, [HgCl2(mbbz)] n (1), [HgBr2(mbbz)] n (2), [HgI2(mbbz)] n (3) and [HgI2(mbbz)]3 (4) have been synthesized and structurally characterized. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that complexes 1, 2 and 3 are isostructural exhibiting the 1-D double helical chain structures. After changing the solvent media, we obtained a trinuclear cage-like structure 4, which is isomeric with 3. Both experimental results and the theoretical calculation proved that the solvent is crucial to the structure of complexes. The fluorescence properties of the four complexes are also investigated and it is apparent that fluorescence intensity decreases as the atomic weight increases in the order of Cl−, Br− and I−. The subtle structure and fluorescence signal changes of these complexes indicate that both the solvents and halide anions have remarkable impact on the resultant complexes. Keywords Hg-containing complexes Crystal structure Theoretical calculation Fluorescence 1 Introduction The design and synthesis of metal–organic complexes are of great current interest due to their intriguing architectures, topologies and potential applications in catalysis, luminescence, ion exchange and gas storage [1–8]. To date, considerable efforts have been devoted to synthesizing these functional materials, and a variety of complexes with novel structures have been successfully obtained [9,10]. However, in many cases it is still difficult to construct complexes with desired structures owing to the influence of many factors such as the nature or ratio of the ligands and the metals, the counter-anions, the solvent media, noncovalent weak interactions and so on [11–14]. Therefore, it is an ongoing challenge to clarify the influence of the various factors that lead to diversity. Among these factors, anion effects are extremely important because they can adjust the properties of the complexes and affect the structures either by coordinating directly to the metal centers or by acting as templates that reorganize the organic building blocks [15–17]. For example, Li and co-workers made a comparison of two complexes [Zn(bpt)Cl2]2 and [Zn(bpt)(SCN)2] n (bpt= N,N′-bis(3-pyridylmethyl)thiourea) which contained the same metal ion and ligand but taking on macro-cyclic and double-helical structures, respectively, due to the effect of the different anions [18–20]. Furthermore, solvent effects are also found to produce a dramatic effect on the structures of complexes [21–23]. For instance, treatment of a toluene solution of Zn(C6F5)2 with p-C4H4N–C6H4CN could give different molecular geometries following recrystallization from 1,2-difluorobenzene or dichloromethane [24]. To further investigate the effect of solvents and anions on the architectures and properties of complexes, four Hg-containing complexes based on the flexible mbbz ligand were prepared by changing halide ions and crystallization solvents. Compared with Ag(I), Zn(II) and Cd(II)-containing complexes [25–27], reports on Hg-containing complexes are disproportionately rare. Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structures, and fluorescence properties of four Hg-containing complexes with double-helical chains and trinuclear cage-like structures. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and general methods Methylenebis(1,1′-benzimidazole) (mbbz) was prepared by the method reported previously [28–30]. All other chemicals were of reagent-grade quality and were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were carried out on a FLASH EA 1112 analyzer. Infrared spectra data were recorded on a BRUKER TENSOR 27 spectrophotometer with KBr pellets in the 400–4000cm−1 region. 2.2 Computational details All quantum chemistry calculations were performed at the DFT/B3LYP level (DFT for density functional theory) [31,32] with 6-31+G∗∗ basis set for C, N and H, and LanL2DZ for Hg and I atoms, using the gaussian 03 program [33]. 2.3 Determination of fluorescent properties Steady state fluorescence measurements were performed using spectrofluorimeter Hitachi F-4500 at ambient temperature in solid state. The excitation and emission slit width are both 2nm, and response time is 0.1s. 2.4 Synthesis of [HgCl2(mbbz)] n (1) A solution of mbbz (5.9mg, 0.025mmol) in 5mL dichloromethane was added slowly into a solution of HgCl2 (6.8mg, 0.025mmol) in 5mL methanol. The mixture was filtered to give a clear solution and then was left standing at room temperature without disturbration.

The empirical absorption corrections were applied to these complexes. The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined with a full-matrix least-squares technique based on F 2 with the shelxl-97 crystallographic software package [34]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically while hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically. Table 1 shows crystallographic crystal data and structure processing parameters of 1–4. Selected bond lengths and bond angles of 1–4 are listed in Table 2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structures of 1 and 2 To investigate the effect of halide ions on the structures of Hg-containing complexes, the reactions of mbbz with HgCl2, HgBr2 and HgI2 were carried out, respectively. The X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complexes 1 and 2 have the same structure. Herein, we only described the structure of complex 1 in detail. Complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/n. The Hg(II) center in complex 1 is located in a distorted tetrahedron with two Cl− ions from HgCl2 and two nitrogen atoms from two ligands (Fig. 1 a). The bond lengths of Hg–Cl are in the range of 2.390–2.400Å and Hg–N lengths vary from 2.318 to 2.353Å, which are in good accordance with the reported Hg(II) complexes with N and Cl donors [35–36]. In 1, the Cl–Hg–Cl angle is 136.8° which is smaller than that of 2 (The Br–Hg–Br angle: 137.7°) due to the slightly bigger electrostatic repulsion of the adjacent bromine atoms. The mbbz ligands link two adjacent Hg(II) atoms to form an infinite 1-D helical chain along b direction with a long pitch of 13.473Å. Because the left-handed and right-handed helical chains coexist in the crystal structure, the whole crystal does not demonstrate chirality [37,38]. The two adjacent different helices are bridged through the weaker C–H⋯X interactions (C⋯Cl=3.70 and C⋯Br=3.83Å) in which the hydrogen atoms come from methylene groups (Fig. 1b). Besides, in 2, there are also another weak C–H⋯Br interactions (C⋯Br=3.62Å) between the two adjacent different helices in which the hydrogen atoms come from benzimidazole groups. More importantly, there are π–π stacking interactions between two adjacent benzimidazole rings with the inter-planar separations of 3.68Å (1) and 3.67Å (2) [center-to-center separation: 3.72Å (1) and 3.40Å (2)] (Fig. 1b). In 1, another type of edge-to-face CH/π interaction between two adjacent benzimidazole rings is 2.84Å being the dihedral angel 89.7° (H/π-plane separation: 2.76Å) slightly shorter than the mean distance (ca. 2.86Å) of the sp2-CH⋯π reported by Suezawa et al. [39,40]. While in 2, the CH/π interaction with the distance of 2.93Å being the dihedral angel 77.5° (H/π-plane separation: 2.79Å) is longer than 1 and those of Suezawa et al. Both the above interactions extend the above 1-D helical chains into 3-D supramolecular framework (Fig. 2 ). These foregoing facts specify that such interactions are very important in 1 and 2, where they contribute significantly to molecular self-assembly processes. 3.2 Crystal structures of 3 and 4 Single crystal analysis shows that 3 is also double helical chain architecture which is similar to that of complexes 1 and 2. The Hg(II) center in 3 is located in a distorted tetrahedron with two I atoms from HgI2 and two nitrogen atoms from two ligands. The bond lengths of Hg–I and Hg–N are in the range of 2.6736–2.6794 and 2.352–2.407Å, respectively. The I–Hg–I angle is 138.2° which is bigger than those of 1 and 2 as listed in Table 2. The mbbz ligands in 3 act as bidentate ligands linking Hg(II) atoms to form a 1-D chain. The C–H⋯I interactions (C⋯I=3.84Å) bridge adjacent different helices to from a 2-D network. Similarly, the network is further stacked by the same π–π stacking interactions as that of 1 with the inter-planar separations of 3.80Å [center-to-center separations: 3.81Å]. Moreover, owing to the influence of the bigger iodine atomic radii, another type of edge-to-face CH/π interaction in 3 is 3.11Å being the dihedral angel 112.4° (H/π-plane separation: 2.82Å) longer than the mean distance of 1 (2.84Å) and 2 (2.93Å). All forementioned interactions result in a 3-D supramolecular framework. The reaction of HgI2 with 1equiv. of mbbz in MeOH solvent afforded pale yellow block crystals of 4, and repeating experiments showed the same result. Complexes 4 and 3 are isomeric Hg(II)I2–mbbz complexes. The X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 4 belongs to the hexagonal space group R-3c and the coordination geometry around the Hg(II) atom in 4 is similar to those in 3 (Fig. 3 a). The Hg–N bond length and Hg–I bond length are 2.351 and 2.683Å, respectively, and they are all in conformity with those found in reported corresponding Hg complexes [41,42]. It should be pointed out that complex 4 exhibits a trinuclear cage-like structure rather than a 1-D helical chain as observed in complex 3. In this complex, three Hg(II) ions are connected through three mbbz ligands and reside in a planar triangle with the intramolecular Hg⋯Hg distance of 11.072Å. The I–Hg–I angle is 119.3° which is smaller than those of 1 (136.8°), 2 (137.7°) and 3 (138.2°) as listed in Table 2. The two benzimidazole in the mbbz ligand are closely perpendicular and lie up and down the trigonal planar in an interlaced way. Thus, through the three mbbz ligands bridged by the three Hg(II) atoms, a trinuclear cage-like unit (M3L3) is formed. It should also be mentioned that weak I⋯I interactions have attracted much interest in recent years, and the I⋯I distance is considered to be in the range of 3.8–4.5Å according to the reported literature [43–45]. In complex 4, the distance of 4.23Å between two iodine atoms from two adjacent M3L3 units indicates the presence of weak I⋯I interactions, and each iodine atom of a M3L3 unit can form such I⋯I interactions between two adjacent iodine atoms of different units. In addition, there are significant π–π stacking interactions between two adjacent benzimidazole rings of different units with the inter-planar separations of 3.42Å [center-to-center separation: 3.57Å] (Fig. 3b) which is shorter than those of 1 (3.68Å), 2 (3.67Å) and 3 (3.80Å). Moreover, each benzimidazole ring of a M3L3 unit can also form such π–π stacking interactions between two adjacent benzimidazole rings of different units. It is the above-mentioned interactions that play an important role in molecular self-assembly processes, which result in a 3-D supramolecular framework (Fig. 4 ). 3.3 The investigation on the influence of solvent effects through quantum chemistry calculations Analysis of the subtle structure change and the crystal packing of 3 and 4 reveal that the solvent effects have an important influence on their structures and packing styles. To investigate the influence of solvent effects on our obtained results, we used the gaussian 03 suit of programs to calculate their energies in different solutions by density functional theory [31,32]. In other words, the lowest-energy isomer in a sort of solvent indicates that it is energetically more stable than in other solvents [46–48]. In order to facilitate the comparison, we selected the calculated models of 3 and 4 with the same atomic numbers (Fig. 5 ). Because 3 and 4 were obtained from solution and they owned the stable structure, hence, we only optimized all hydrogen atoms of 3 and 4. Our calculation results in different solutions showed that the energy of 3 in CH3OH and CH2Cl2 mixed solvents was 24.71kcal/mol lower than that in CH3OH, on the contrary, the energy of 4 in CH3OH and CH2Cl2 mixed solvents was 3.01kcal/mol higher than that in CH3OH. Namely, 3 in CH3OH and CH2Cl2 mixed solvents and 4 in CH3OH were energetically favorable models than in the corresponding solvent, which were easier to form and exist. The calculation results accorded well with our experimental results. 3.4 Fluorescence properties The fluorescence properties of the mbbz ligand and complexes 1–4 have been studied in solid state at room temperature and the results were shown in Fig. 6 . Under the 354nm excitation, the mbbz ligand emits strongly at 378nm. However, complexes 1 and 2 give relatively weak fluorescence at 377nm under the same condition. Complexes 3 and 4 exhibit no fluorescence properties comparing with the free ligand. The emission of these complexes can be assigned to the intraligand transition because it is difficult to oxidize or reduce the Hg(II) ion due to its stable d10 configuration [49,50]. In addition, the resemblance in the emission spectra of these complexes and mbbz ligand excluding emission intensity also indicates that the fluorescence spectra of these complexes are mbbz-based emission. The fluorescence spectra of these complexes with halide ions are quenched according to an internal heavy atom mechanism caused by the introduction of the metal ions and halide anions [51,52]. They maybe reduce the rigidity of the polymers and cause a decrease in the conjugate degree of whole molecules [53,54]. Therefore as the atomic weight increases in the order of Cl− <Br− <I−, fluorescence intensity decreases. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have synthesized and characterized four new Hg-containing complexes. Complexes 1 and 2 with the same ligand but different halide ions of Cl− and Br− have similar structures. The results indicate that there is no great influence of Cl− and Br− ions on the structure of the complexes 1 and 2. However, the I− has a remarkable impact on the structures of complexes 3 and 4. The nature of the halide anions, specially the radius and electronegativity, are the underlying reason behind the differences in the structures of this series of complexes [55,56]. Furthermore, complex 4 is isomeric with 3 but showing totally different structure due to crystallizations from different solvents. Our theoretical calculated results, which is in good agreement with our experimental results, proved that the solvent effects have an important influence on their structures. We speculated on that the inductive effects of different solvents played important role in molecular self-assembly processes. The fluorescence properties of these complexes are also affected by the halide ions and it is apparent that fluorescence intensity decreases as the atomic weight increases in the order of Cl−, Br− and I−.
