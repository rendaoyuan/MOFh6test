Three novel complexes, [Cu(phen)(oba)]2·(DMF)2(H2O) (1), {[Cu(2,2-bipy)2(Hoba)][Cu(2,2-bipy)2(oba)]2·(nitrate)(H2O)13} (2) and [Cd(oba)(ptca)]·(DMA)2 (3) (H2oba=4,4′-oxydibenzoic acid, H2ptca=terephthalic acid, 2,2-bipy=2,2′-dipyridylamine, DMA=dimethylamine, phen=1,10-phenanthroline) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectrum and X-ray crystal diffraction. Strong hydrogen bonds play central roles in the formation of the 3D structure, the combined influence of the weak interactions such as C–H…O, carbonyl…π and C–H…π interactions are also evident in the structures. Complex 1 shows 1D helix structure which is shaped by intermolecular and intramolecular π…π stacking. Complex 2 displays a interesting water morphology based on the lattice water molecules while Complex 3 shows 2-fold (4,4)-net vertical interpenetrating structure. The preliminary investigations on the fluorescence property of the complexes are presented. Graphical abstract The two-dimensional structure and the two interpenetrating 2D nets in the structure were formed. Highlights ► Novel lattice water tape contained in complex 2. ► Ellipse-like channels were observed along c-axis in complex 2. ► Compound 3 is constructed from 2D (4,4) layers with interpenetrated structure. Keywords C–H…π Carbonyl…π Hydrogen bonds Interpenetrate Recently, a growing number of interests have been focused on the design strategies and construction of the architecture with diversity topologies in supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering [1]. As we know, properties are derived from the natural structure, and also can be subtle moderated by slight structure changes [2]. On the other hand, the phenomenon of interpenetration, once a rarity, is now becoming increasingly common aided by the rapid growth of network-based crystal engineering [3–6]. In an attempt to construct 3-D network of porous structure, we chose a long, flexible dicarboxylate ligand (H2oba) base on the following consideration. Firstly, longer ligand will lead to larger voids. In a very loose and general sense it can be said that the larger the voids in a 3-D net the more likely interpenetration occurs [7,8]. Secondly, the V-shaped ligand plays a key role in the formation of the helical chains. Long flexible ligands usually lead to helical modes, which results in high structure stability and chirality of the bulk materials. Finally, multicarboxylate ligand always forms multiple hydrogen bonds [9,10]. Hydrogen bonds still remain the most reliable and widely used means of enforcing molecular recognition. Besides these conventional strong hydrogen bonds, varieties of unconventional intermolecular contacts (carbonyl…π, π…π and anion…π) have also been found to be instrumental in determining the supramolecular structure of solid [11–14]. However, water clusters can play important roles in the stabilization of supramolecular systems especially in the multicarboxylate environment [15]. In this context, we have succeeded in obtaining three new complexes [Cu(phen)(oba)]2·(DMF)2(H2O) (1), {[Cu(2,2-bipy)2(Hoba)][Cu(2,2-bipy)2(oba)]2·(nitrate)(H2O)13} (2) and [Cd(oba)(ptca)]·(DMA)2 (3) [16,17] based on 4,4′-oxydibenzoic acid. Auxiliary ligand acts as the structure-directing agent in the formation of the supramolecular network. We get two low dimension structures (complexes 1 and 2) by using the chelating ligand as the second ligand while get a 3-D structure (complex 3) with bridging ligand. Strong hydrogen bonds and π…π interactions play important roles in the formation of the 3D structures. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurement reveals that the crystal of complex 1 crystallizes in the space group c2/c (Table S1). The coordination environment of the central atom is shown in Fig. 1a. The Cu(II) atom is five coordinated by three oxygen atoms (Cu–O(2) 2.22; Cu–O(5) 1.938Å; Cu–O(8) 2.004Å) and two nitrogen atoms (Cu–N(1) 2.022Å; Cu–N(2) 2.019Å) which furnish a distorted quadrangular pyramid coordination geometry. Two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2) and two oxygen atoms (O8 and O5) constitute the base of the square-pyramid and O2 occupies the apical position with Cu–O2 distance of 2.22Å, which is shorter than corresponding bond length reported recently [18]. Each pair of adjacent Cu(II) atoms are bridged by an 4,4′-oxydibenzoic acid ligand to form a chain running along the c direction. These chains are decorated with phen ligand alternately at two sides (Fig. 1b). The oba phenyl rings at each side of the chain are arranged in a parallel fashion with the phen molecular (with the inter-ring distance between phenyl rings and phen moleculars being 3.561Å). Indeed, each pair of homochiral polymeric chains interwind into a unique double-stranded helix of C2 symmetry through π…π stacking interactions between the phen ligands and the phenyl rings of 4,4′-oxydibenzoic acid (face-to-face distances of being 3.586Å) (Fig. 1b and c) [19]. In addition, adjacent unique helix chains were further connected by π…π stacking interaction between the phen ligands. The interfacial distance of 3.497Å indicates a strong aromatic π…π stacking interactions [20]. C–H…π interaction also plays a important role in the formation of the 3D structure. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurement reveals that complex 2 crystallizes in the space group of C2/c. A molecular structure showing the arrangement about the Cu (II) metal center is shown in Fig. 2a. In the crystal structure of 2, there are three kinds of crystallographic different copper atoms, as shown in Fig. 2a. All the copper atoms are linked by two 2,2′-bipyridine ligands and oba ligand. The oba ligand coordinate to the Cu(II) atoms by using only one of its carboxyl group. Two of the three uncoordinated carboxyl groups were deprotonated and form multiple hydrogen bonds to stabilize the structure. Each of the copper atom is six coordinated and adopts seriously distorted octahedral geometry by coordinating with four nitrogen atoms from 2,2′-bipyridine molecules (Cu(1)–N(9) 1.977Å; Cu(1)–N(7) 1.999Å; Cu(1)–N(8) 2.071Å; Cu(1)–N(7) 2.165Å; Cu(2)–N(10) 1.965Å; Cu(2)–N(13) 2.015Å; Cu(2)–N(11) 2.065Å; Cu(2)–N(12) 2.174Å; Cu(3)–N(2) 1.974Å; Cu(3)–N(4) 2.012Å; Cu(3)–N(3) 2.054Å; Cu(3)–N(5) 2.173Å) and two oxygen atoms from carboxyl groups of 4,4′-oxydibenzoic acid. Fourteen lattice water molecules and one nitrate ion are also contained in this structure. These results are also confirmed by the TG/DTA test (Fig. S3). 1D infinite zigzag chains are formed by the π…π stacking interactions between the 2,2′-bipyridine ligands as shown in Fig. 2b. It must be remarked that the uncoordinated carboxyl groups and lattice water molecules held together forming a hydrogen-bonded sheet along bc plane (Fig. 3a, Table S2). Within this water sheets, nine of the lattice water molecules and their symmetric equivalent atoms form infinite chains and the other seven of the lattice water molecules and their symmetric equivalent atoms held together forming two seven-membered rings through COO group (Fig. 2c). In addition, two seven-membered rings held together forming a cage structure and the cage were extended through O25–H25C…O23 hydrogen bonds forming a 1D hydrogen-bonded water tape is observed in bc plane. These water tapes are located in the gaps of the thick 2D networks which act as host to stabilize the water tapes. Considering the strength of the porous structure which is built up by the hydrogen bonds, we don't pay any more attention to the thoroughly investigating of the porous activity. The detail structure of the water cluster is shown in (Fig. 3b and c). Carboxyl groups provide potential hydrogen bonding intermolecular interactions. Within the water cluster, the O…O distances are in the range of 2.496(2) to 3.208(1)Å with an average of 2.788(1)Å, which is comparable to that observed in the ice Π phase 2.77–2.84Å [21]. The O…O…O angles vary from 115.68 to 179.35°. The carboxyl group which acts hydrogen bond acceptor towards the water molecules via both of its O atoms exhibit delocalized π system with nearly identical C–O distances. Single-crystal analysis reveals that complex 3 is a two-dimensional interpenetrating network, and each metal ion shows coordination number of eight, binding with eight oxygen atoms from four carboxyl group (Fig. 4a). Take account of the imbalance of the charge, protonated dimethylamine is suggested for the isolated ions, which is formed by the decomposition of DMF. This result is further confirmed by the IR spectrum. Within the structure, each ligand uses a chelated carboxyl groups and the Cd atoms are connected by μ2-oba anions associated with μ2-ptca ligands resulting in a 2D (4,4) network (Fig. 4b). Two of these net interweave to give rise to a 2-fold interpenetrating structure (2D→2D vertical) (Fig. 4c). In the complex, the ligands not only act as bridge but also form strong hydrogen bonds with DMA molecules (N(1)–H(1A)···O(7) 2.779Å, N(1)–H(1B)···O(8) 2.892Å, N(2)–H(2A)···O(9) 2.834Å, N(2)–H(2B)···O(1) 2.968, N(2)–H(2B)···O(3) 3.141Å). The solid-state emission spectra of the complex 3 are investigated at room temperature. The emission spectrum of the title complex is given in Fig. S1. The fluorescent spectrum study shows that complex 3 exhibits a broad and strong emission band with a maximum wavelength of 450nm upon photoexcitation at 280nm compare with pure oba ligand (emission wavelength of 432nm). The small redshift indicates that the luminescence of the complex is a molecular property, attributable to a π–π* transition of the deprotoned ligand like some complexes of 2-(2-py)indole or 2-(2-py)-7-azaindole [22]. Therefore, the emission property of the complex may be attributed to the intraligand (IL) emission from the free ligand [23–26], and the role of Cd (II) center is believed to stabilize the ligands and increase conformational rigidity of the ligands by coordination. The electrochemical behavior of complex 2 in DMSO was examined by using cyclic voltammetry in the potential range from −1.0 to 1.0V. The resulting cyclic voltammogram (CVs) is shown in Fig. S2. Complex 2 displays a couple of quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction waves with the reduction potential lies in −0.56V and the oxidation potential lies in 0.48V. The peak of the reduction and the oxidation may be assigned to the CuII/CuI couple according to the literature [27–30]. In conclusion, we have prepared and characterized[Cu(phen)(oba)]2·(DMF)2(H2O) (1), {[Cu(2,2-bipy)2(Hoba)][Cu(2,2-bipy)2(oba)]2·(nitrate)(H2O)13} (2) and [Cd(oba)(ptca)]·(DMA)2 (3) and determined their crystal structures. Hydrogen bonding interactions and π–π stacking are found to form the packing structure. Complex 3 displays strong fluorescence property. Appendix A Supplementary material Supplementary material 1.

<p>Publication of your CIF<br>You should attempt to resolve as many as possible of the alerts in all categories.

Data that may be required is missing<br>Publication of your CIF<br>You should attempt to resolve as many as possible of the alerts in all categories. Often the minor<br>alerts point to easily fixed oversights, errors and omissions in your CIF or refinement strategy, so<br>attention to these fine details can be worthwhile. In order to resolve some of the more serious<br>problems it may be necessary to carry out additional measurements or structure refinements.<br>However, the nature of your study may justify the reported deviations from journal submission<br>requirements and the more serious of these should be commented upon in the discussion or<br>experimental section of a paper or in the "special_details" fields of the CIF. checkCIF was<br>carefully designed to identify outliers and unusual parameters, but every test has its limitations and<br>alerts that are not important in a particular case may appear. Conversely, the absence of alerts does<br>not guarantee there are no aspects of the results needing attention. It is up to the individual to<br>critically assess their own results and, if necessary, seek expert advice.<br>If level A alerts remain, which you believe to be justified deviations, and you intend to submit this<br>CIF for publication in Acta Crystallographica Section C or Section E, you should additionally<br>insert an explanation in your CIF using the Validation Reply Form (VRF) below. Your explanation<br>will be considered as part of the review process.<br>If you intend to submit to another section of Acta Crystallographica or Journal of Applied<br>Crystallography or Journal of Synchrotron Radiation, you should make sure that at least a basic<br>structural check is run on the final version of your CIF prior to submission.<br># start Validation Reply Form<br>_vrf_PUBL004_GLOBAL<br>;<br>PROBLEM: The contact author’s name and address are missing,<br>RESPONSE: ...<br>;<br>_vrf_PUBL005_GLOBAL<br>;<br>PROBLEM: _publ_contact_author_email, _publ_contact_author_fax and<br>RESPONSE: ...<br>;<br>_vrf_PUBL006_GLOBAL<br>;<br>PROBLEM: _publ_requested_journal is missing<br>RESPONSE: ...<br>;<br>_vrf_PUBL008_GLOBAL<br>;<br>PROBLEM: _publ_section_title is missing.
