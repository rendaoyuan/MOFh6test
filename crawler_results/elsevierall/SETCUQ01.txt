The solvothermal reactions of AgNO3, NaN3, with benzonitrile or 4-cyanopyridine in methanol/water yield two novel metal–organic coordination polymers, [Ag(μ3-phtta)] n (1) (phtta=5-phenyltetrazolate) and {Ag[μ4-(4-pytta)]} n (2) [4-pytta=5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazolate], respectively. The two reactions were involved in the in situ formation of 5-aryl-substituted tetrazolate ligands (phtta and pytta) through [2+3] cycloaddition reactions of azide anion with benzonitrile or 4-cyanopyridine. Compounds 1 and 2 were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectra, and single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Compound 1 has a one-dimensional double-chain structure in which centrosymmetric dimeric [Ag(phtta)]2 units are interconnected by four Ag–N bonds. These double-chains are further stacked into a 2D layer network through π–π interactions between tetrazolyl rings and interactions between Ag+ and phenyl group or tetrazolyl ring. Compound 2 has an intriguing 3D non-interpenetrated supramolecular structure in which a 2D layer network with (4.82)Ag(4.82)pytta topology holds the adjacent layers together via interactions of Ag+ ions in one layer with 4-N atoms of pytta ligands in the other. Photoluminescence studies revealed that solids 1 and 2 exhibit strong blue fluorescent emissions at λ max =422 and 390nm (λ ex =345nm), respectively, at ambient temperature. Keywords Silver(I) Coordination polymer Tetrazolate ligands Solvothermal synthesis Crystal structures Luminescence properties 1 Introduction The construction of supramolecular complexes from silver(I) salts and multi-topic N-containing ligands has recently attracted much attention due to their intriguing topology structures [1–8], and their potential applications in fluorescence [9–13], electrochemical properties [14–16], electrical conductivity [17], materials science [18], and antimicrobial properties [19]. These compounds are mainly prepared from routine solution reactions [1–6,10–20] or hydro(solvo)thermal reactions of silver(I) salts with organic components [7–9,21–35]. In later reactions, various N-containing ligands were found to be generated in situ from inorganic and/or organic components under the presence of metal ions. For example, some tetrazolate ligands could be prepared in situ through so-called Demko-Sharpless [2+3] cycloaddition reactions of organic nitriles with azide anion in the presence of metal ions such as Zn2+, Cd2+, Ag+, and Cu+ [22–35]. In the case of silver/tetrazolate complexes, only six examples have been reported up to now and they were all prepared from this unique cycloaddition reaction. The tetrazolate ligands in these structures are mainly 5-alkyl-substituted tetrazolates [7,8] and only one is 5-aryl-substituted tetrazolate [8]. Being aware of the fact that the chemistry of silver complexes with 5-aryl-substituted tetrazolates are less unexplored, we chose benzonitrile and 4-cyanopyridine and carried out their reactions with sodium azide at solvothermal conditions and two [Ag(μ3-phtta)] n (1) (phtta=5-phenyltetrazolate) and {Ag[μ4-(4-pytta)]} n (2) [4-pytta=5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazolate] were isolated therefrom. Herein, we report their syntheses, crystal structures, and luminescent properties. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Preparation and characterization of 1 and 2 The reaction of AgNO3 with equimolar sodium azide and 2.5 equiv. of benzonitrile in H2O/MeOH (v/v=1:2.5) under solvothermal conditions at 150°C for 67h gave rise to 1 as brown plates in 68.3% yield. On the other hand, analogous reactions of 1:1:2.5 AgNO3/NaN3/4-cyanopyridine at similar conditions produced colorless prismatic crystals of 2 in a relatively low yield (24.2%). Formation of 1 and 2 was confirmed by their elemental analyses and IR spectra. The absence of the cyano group in the range of 2200cm−1 and the appearance of a new stretching vibration of tetrazolate anion at ca. 1400cm−1 in the IR spectrum are line with the in situ formation of tetrazolate ligand generated by a [2+3] cycloaddition reaction of benzonitrile or 4-cyanopyridine with azide anion [24,30,31]. Short reaction time (<10h) or low reaction temperature (<100°C) or low molar ratio of reagents (e.g. AgNO3/NaN3/benzonitrile (or 4-cyanopyridine)=1:1:1) for these reactions always resulted in a mixture of a small amount of 1 or 2 coupled with a large amount of unreacted starting materials. The IR spectrum of the mixture revealed the presence of the strong stretching vibrations of azide group (2050cm−1) and cyano groups (2200cm−1) of benzonitrile or 4-cyanopyridine. In addition, prolonged reaction time (>100h) and high reaction temperature (>180°C) for these reactions afforded 1 in a very low yield (<1%). The reason for this may be due to the trimerization of benzonitrile or 4-cyanopyridine into 1,3,5-triazine derivatives at reaction conditions [36–38]. Solids 1 and 2 are stable towards air and moisture and insoluble in common organic solvents such as DMF·DMSO, MeCN, toluene, MeOH, and CH2Cl2. The elemental analyses of 1 and 2 are consistent with their chemical formula. The identities of 1 and 2 were finally confirmed by X-ray crystallography. 2.2 Molecular structure of 1 Compound 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n and the asymmetric unit consists of an Ag+ ion and a phtta anion. Compound 1 has a one-dimensional double-chain structure (extending along the c axis) in which two parallel [Ag(phtta)] n chains are alternatively arranged so that the Ag1 atom in one chain further interacts with the N2 of the phtta ligand of the other chain (Fig. 1 ). Alternatively, the 1D double-chain structure of 1 may be viewed as being built of centrosymmetric dimeric [Ag(phtta)]2 units linked by four Ag–N bonds (e.g. Ag1–N3B, Ag1A–N3C, Ag1C–N3A, Ag1E–N3). In the structure of 1, each phtta ligand coordinates to three Ag+ ions and serves as a μ3-1,2,3-tetrazolyl coordination mode, which was previously observed only in [Zn(mtta)2]3(H2O) (mtta=5-methyltetrazolate) [29]. The Ag1 center is coordinated by N1, N2A, and N3B, forming an approximate trigonal coordination geometry (Table 1 ). The Ag1⋯Ag1A separation within the dimeric unit is 3.689(6) Å while the Ag1E⋯Ag1A and Ag1⋯Ag1C contacts between the dimeric units are 4.009(6) Å. The former value is close to the sum of the van der Walls radii of two Ag atoms, suggesting weak Ag⋯Ag interactions. The mean Ag–N bond length of 2.272(4) Å is slightly longer than those containing trigonally-coordinated Ag such as [Ag(mtta)] n (2.238(6) Å [7] and 2.219(12) Å [8]). It is interesting to note that in the crystal of 1, each 1D double-chain further binds to adjacent chains through π–π interactions between tetrazolyl rings and interactions between Ag+ and phenyl group or tetrazolyl ring to form a 2D layer structure (Fig. 2 ). The shortest centroid–centroid distance between tetrazolyl rings is 3.380(7) Å, while that between Ag+ ion and phenyl group or tetrazolyl ring is 3.502(8) Å or 3.682(8) Å. The phenyl group and the tetrazolyl ring of the phtta ligand in 1 are not co-planar with their dihedral angle of 11°, which is probably due to those weak interactions. 2.3 Molecular structure of 2 Compound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c and the asymmetric unit contains an Ag+ ion and a pytta anion. As shown in Fig. 3 , the Ag1 atom is bound to one N5C from one pyridyl group and three N atoms (N1, N2A, N4B) from three tetrazolyl groups of four different pytta ligands, forming a rare trigonal pyramidal one. It is noted that the Ag1–N4B distance (2.530(2) Å) is longer than the other three (2.253(2)–2.352(2) Å). As a whole, each pytta in 2 serves as a tetradentate ligand. In the structure of 2, the 1-N, 2-N, and 4-N atoms of the tetrazolate of each pytta ligand bind to three Ag+ ions, respectively, forming a μ3-1,2,4-tetrazolyl coordination mode that was observed in [Ag(mtta)] n [7,8]. If the longer Ag1–N4 bond is neglected, the structure shows a 2D three-connected (4,8) layer with a Schafli symbol (4.82)Ag(4.82)pytta in which Ag1 and the tetrazolate work as 3-connecting nodes (Fig. 4 ). Interestingly, the resulting wavy 2D layer further holds the adjacent layers together via interactions of Ag+ ions in one layer with 4-N atoms of pytta ligands in the other, forming a unique 3D non-interpenetrated supramolecular structure (Fig. 5 ). The Ag⋯Ag contacts within the layer are 4.1137(11) Å while those between the layers are 6.2754(10) Å. Both contacts are too long to include any metal–metal interaction. Like the phtta ligand in 1, the pyridyl group of the pytta in 2 is also not co-planar with its tetrazolate ring, and the dihedral angel between them is 37.09(6)°. 2.4 Luminescent properties It is well known that complexes containing silver(I) ions and nitrogen-containing ligands have been investigated for luminescence properties [9–13,39,40]. As shown in Fig. 6 , compounds 1 and 2 showed strong luminescent properties in the solid state at ambient temperature. When excited at λ ex =345nm, the luminescent spectra of 1 and 2 exhibited maximal emission peaks at 422nm (1) and 390nm (2), respectively. The possible origin of these peaks is tentatively attributed to ligand-to-ligand transitions from the phtta ligands in 1 or the pytta ligands in 2, which are in agreement with silver(I) coordination polymers of N-containing multi-topic ligands reported by others [13,40]. In addition, the relatively efficient π–π interactions between tetrazolyl rings in 1 may account for the red shift of the emission peak in the spectrum of 1 relative to that of 2. 3 Conclusions In this paper, we demonstrated the successful syntheses of two new silver(I) coordination polymers (1 and 2) containing phtta and pytta ligands from reactions of AgNO3, NaN3 and benzonitrile or 4-cyanopyridine at solvothermal conditions. The two reactions are involved in the in situ generation of two new tetrazolate ligands (phtta and pytta) from the [2+3] cycloaddition reaction of organonitriles and azide anion. X-ray analysis revealed that 1 contains a 1D double-chain structure and each chain in the crystal further stacks with its neighboring chains into a 2D network through the π–π interactions between tetrazolyl rings and between Ag+ and phenyl group or tetrazolyl ring. Compound 2 has an intriguing 3D non-interpenetrated supramolecular structure in which a 2D layer with a (4.82)Ag(4.82)pytta topology combines with its adjacent layers via interactions of Ag+ ions in one layer with the 4-N atoms of the pytta ligands in the other. The tetrazolate ligands in 1 and 2 show μ3-1,2,3-tetrazolyl and μ3-1,2,4-tetrazolyl mode, respectively and the Ag(I) center in the structure of 2 adopts a rare trigonal pyramidal coordination geometry. In addition, solids 1 and 2 were demonstrated to display strong blue fluorescence emissions at room temperature, which suggested that they might be good blue-light-emitted materials. The successful isolation of 1 and 2 suggests that more interesting silver(I) coordination polymers of tetrazolate derivatives can be prepared through [2+3] cycloaddition reactions of other aryl-nitriles with azide at solvothermal conditions. Studies in this respect are under way in our laboratory. 4 Experimental 4.1 General All the chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used as received. The IR spectra were recorded on a Varian 1000 FT-IR (Scimitar Series) spectrometer as KBr disks (4000–400cm−1). The elemental analyses for C, H, and N were performed on a Carlo-Erba EA1110 CHNO-S microanalyzer. All manipulations were carried out in air. Emission and Excitation spectra were performed on a Perkin-Elmer LS55 spectrofluorometer with a red-sensitive R928 photomultiplier. 4.2 Synthesis Caution. Metal azides may be explosive.

A brown plate of 1 with dimensions 0.03×0.10×0.25mm3 and a colorless prism of 2 with dimensions 0.17×0.28×0.40 mm3 were mounted on glass fibers with grease. Diffraction data were collected at ω mode with a detector distance of 35mm to the crystal. Indexing was performed from 6 images, each of which was exposed for 4s (for 1) and 2s (for 2). A total of 720 oscillation images for each were collected in the range 6.09°<2θ <50.70° for 1 and 6.10°<2θ <50.68° for 2. The collected data were reduced by using the program CrystalClear (Rigaku and MSC, Ver. 1.3, 2001), and an absorption correction (multi-scan) was applied, which resulted in transmission factors ranging from 0.732 to 0.917 for 1 and 0.380 to 0.609 for 2. The reflection data were also corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects Table 2 . The crystal structures of 1 and 2 were solved by direct methods [41], and expanded using Fourier techniques [42]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and all other hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically idealized positions (C–H=0.97Å for phenyl groups) and constrained to ride on their parent atoms with U iso(H)=1.2U eq(C). All the calculations were performed on a Dell workstation using the CrystalStructure crystallographic software package (Rigaku/MSC, Ver. 3.60, 2004). Important crystal data and collection sand refinement parameters for 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 3 .
