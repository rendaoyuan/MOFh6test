A novel (CH3OH)(H2O)5 binary cluster is trapped in a photoluminescent silver(I) coordination polymeric host, [Ag2(bpp)2(H2O)(ssa)·4H2O·CH3OH]n (1, bpp=1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane, H2ssa=5-sulfosalicylic acid). The heterohexamer can be viewed as either a D 5 water pentamer with a dangling methanol molecule or a combination of D 4 tetrameric water and methanol–water heterodimer. This well-resolved heterohexamer may behave as a useful model helping us to further understand phase behavior of binary methanol–water system. The luminescent behavior of 1 was also discussed.

Keywords Silver(I) 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane 5-sulfosalicylic acid Water pentamer Methanol–water binary cluster DFT calculation Research into the chemistry, physics, and biological aspects of hydrogen-bonded liquids has attracted considerable theoretical and experimental interests [1]. Among the common liquids, water as an indispensable component in life-sustaining processes, was widely investigated through its hydrogen-bonded aggregates (i.e. water clusters), such as a variety of discrete water clusters (H2O)n (where n=2–12, 14–18, 20, 32, 45) [2], and three morphologies of polymeric water clusters including infinite one-dimensional (1D) water chains or tapes [3], two-dimensional (2D) water layers [4], and three-dimensional (3D) water structures [5]. However, compared with pure water clusters, this is not so in the case of binary solvent systems such as methanol–water. Methanol is the simplest amphiphile functionalized with hydrophobic (CH3) and hydrophilic (OH) groups. Methanol–water solvents are very important systems exhibiting properties that are of great interest in physics, chemistry and biology [6]. Some experimental and theoretical solution-state studies have been conducted on the methanol–water mixtures [7], but well characterized mixed water–methanol clusters in the solid state are still rarely reported to date [8]. In the course of our investigations on Ag(I) mixed-ligand complexes [9], we used flexible 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp) and 5-sulfosalicylic acid (H2ssa) with three potential coordinating groups as primary and auxiliary organic ligands (Scheme 1 ), respectively, to obtain a novel silver(I) polymeric solid [Ag2(bpp)2(H2O)(ssa)·4H2O·CH3OH]n (1), in which an interesting (CH3OH)(H2O)5 binary cluster was encapsulated and characterized at molecular scale using single-crystal X-ray diffraction method. Complex 1 was obtained using ‘one-pot’ methodology by ultrasonic reaction of a mixture of Ag2O, 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp) and 5-sulfosalicylic acid (H2ssa) in methanol–H2O (10mL, v:v =1:1) binary solvent [10]. X-ray structure analysis [11] reveals that 1 crystallizes in monoclinic space group of P21/c and possesses one crystallographically unique ssa and two Ag(I) ions in the structure. The coordination environments around the two Ag(I) ions are different. As shown in Fig. 1a, Ag1 adopts a distorted tetrahedron geometry, completed by two N donors of two bpp and two O donors of two ssa (Ag1–N1=2.134(4), Ag1–N2i =2.140(4) Å and Ag1–O4=2.681(4), Ag1–O4ii =2.861(4) Å). The distortion of the tetrahedron can be indicated by the calculated value of τ4 parameter introduced by Houser [12] to describe the geometry of a four-coordinate metal system, which is 0.66 for Ag1 (for perfect tetrahedron geometry, τ4 =1). Ag2 is ligated by two N atoms from two bpp (Ag2–N3=2.152(4) and Ag2–N4iii =2.155(4) Å) and one aqua oxygen atom (Ag2–O1w=2.509Å), resulting in a T-shaped fashion. The N3Ag2N4iii bond angle of 159.9(2)° indicates a distortion from linearity, which may be assigned to the coordinative interaction between Ag(I) ion and coordinated water. Both the AgN and AgO bond lengths fall in the normal ranges as the reported complexes [13]. Generally, the flexible bpp ligand can adopt four different conformations (TT 9.1–10.1Å, TG 8.6–9.2Å, GG 6.7–8.6Å and GG 3.9Å, where T = trans and G = gauche, and the expected ranges in N···N separations are given) with respect to the relative orientations of the CH2 groups [14]. In 1, each bpp which assumes a TT conformation with average N···N separation of 9.576Å is employed as a bridging ligand for the construction of 1D chain along the a axis. Adjacent 1D chains interact with each other through Ag···Ag interactions to generate a 2D undulating brick-wall cationic layer of composition. The corresponding Ag···Ag separations ranging from 3.0508(7) to 3.0854(7) Å in 1 are shorter than twice the van der Waals radii for Ag (3.44Å) [15] and comparable to the Ag···Ag distance (2.88Å) in silver metal [16], indicating existence of argentophilicity that promotes the aggregation of silver centers [17]. As we know, 5-sulfosalicyclic acid (H2ssa) contains three potential coordinating groups (OH, CO2H and SO3H). During the synthesis reaction of 1, both SO3H and CO2H group are deprotonated, but OH group is neutral. Infrared spectroscopy was useful for distinguishing these functional groups of H2ssa [10]. These are no bands in the region 1690–1730cm−1 indicating complete deprotonation of CO2H group [9]. The ssa ligand adopts a μ 1–η 1 coordination mode through sulfonate group binding to a Ag(I) ion and dangles on the 1D cationic chain, while remaining carboxylate and hydroxyl group do not coordinate any silver centers. We quickly performed a Cambridge Structure Database (CSD) search for 5-sulfosalicyclic motif with the help of ConQuest Version 1.3 [18]. Our search algorithm found 12 silver(I) complexes containing a 5-sulfosalicyclic motif [19], of which 5 (41.67%) show both sulfonate and carboxylate group are coordinated, 3 (25%) displays the three coordinating groups bind to silver centers, 4 (33.33%) don't show any bonding actions with metal ions, while 1 is the first example of silver(I) complexes containing 5-sulfosalicyclic ligand which exhibits only sulfonate group coordinated to a single silver(I) ion but carboxylate and hydroxyl groups remain free binding sites. A remarkable feature of 1 is that uncoordinated oxygen atoms of ssa act as hydrophilic sites and easily induce surrounding water molecules to aggregate into an ordered 2D hydrogen-bonded-driven anionic layer. Four hydrogen-bonded patterns marked as A [R 9 8(20)], B [R 7 7(22)], C [R 3 3(12)] and D [S(6)] are observed in the 2D anionic layer. Each 20-membered ring A includes a methanol molecule via two kinds of OH···O hydrogen bonding interactions, forming a novel CH3OH@A moiety (Fig. 2b). Because of CH3OH inclusion, the pattern A is divided into two different hydrogen-bonded motifs including 12-membered cyclic [E, R 5 5(12)] and 16-memered ring [F, R 8 6(16)]. An interesting question arises as to what if CH3OH is substituted by other simple solvent such as H2O or CH3CH2OH? Unfortunately, the corresponding complexes have not been obtained so far and preliminary competition experiments indicated preferential inclusion of CH3OH in 1, in the presence of other solvents. We preliminarily perform the first principle calculations using density functional theory (DFT) to compare the additional hydrogen bonds energies due to the inclusion of solvent in the ring A (Fig. 3 ) [20]. The corresponding O ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ H - O | R ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ H (R = Ethyl, H and Methyl) hydrogen-bonding energies for CH3CH2OH@A, H2O@A and CH3OH@A are 3.22, 6.56 and 9.78kcal·mol−1, respectively, which indicated that the methanol-containing complex (CH3OH@A) is more stable than the water or ethanol counterparts (H2O@A or CH3CH2OH@A). The computational results partially elucidated no isolation of complexes containing CH3CH2OH or H2O in experiment. A closer look at the 2D anionic layer reveals the presence of a mixed (CH3OH)(H2O)5 cluster (Fig. 2c). The heterohexamer can be viewed as either a D 5 water pentamer with a dangling methanol molecule or a D 4 water tetramer and methanol–water heterodimer. The five Ow atoms (O1w–O5w) of the acyclic D 5 pentameric water are not co-planar and form a zigzag motif with binding of alternate water molecules in a zigzag chain. In the water pentamer, O1w only serves as a single hydrogen bond donor and the other four water molecules (O2w–O5w) act as an acceptor as well as a donor. The O···O distance within the pentamer ranges from 2.688(7) to 2.773(7) Å with an average value of 2.731(7) Å. For comparison, the corresponding values in regular ice, in liquid water, and in the vapor phase are 2.74, 2.85 and 2.98Å, respectively [21]. Both theoretical and experimental studies of pentameric water clusters indicated there are three low-energy structural isomers including “ring”, “envelope” and “cage” configurations [22]. The minimum-energy structure is the one as a ring conformer. The cyclic structure is possibly more stable than a linear one owing to the possibility of formation of a maximum number of hydrogen bonds within the cluster. In 1, the shape and size of the void space in this structure prevent cyclic arrangement of the water molecules. Here, the water pentamer adopts an acyclic zigzag conformation and its stability is derived from strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between neighboring CH3OH along the chain as well as H-bonding interactions with the available O atoms from ssa. Furthermore, CH3OH is bonded to the unshared water molecule (O3w) in the acyclic pentamer through O1···H3wai–O3wi, giving rise to the (methanol)(water)5 binary cluster. Considering the direct connectivity of CH3OH and O3w, we will further inspect the corresponding heterodimer. Previous theoretical calculations of methanol–water heterodimer indicated there are two possible isomers where methanol is a proton acceptor, “CH3HO···H2O”, or a proton donor “CH3OH···OH2” [23]. The latter “CH3OH···OH2” is generally much less stable than the former “CH3HO···H2O” for the heterodimer because the energy for the former is estimated to be 0.7kcal/mol higher than the latter lower energy specie at the MP2 level [24]. The more stable isomer “CH3HO···H2O” had been verified by Stockman et al. at microwave rotation tunneling spectroscopy technique level [7a]. By comparison, the structure of the present methanol–water heterodimer is similar to the “CH3HO···H2O” isomer and the O···O distance of 2.843Å is in very good agreement with 2.844Å estimated in the previous available theoretical results [24]. The photoluminescence of 1 was measured in solid state at room temperature. Upon 330nm excitation, maximum of emission band of 1 is at ~420nm. The main emission peaks of free H2ssa and bpp ligand are at ~390nm and ~445nm. By comparison, the emission band of 1 is red- and blue-shifted by ca. 30 and 25nm, respectively, and may come from the electronic transition between p orbitals (filled orbitals) of coordinated N or O atoms and 5s orbital (empty orbital) of Ag(I) ion, i.e., ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), mixed with metal-centered (d–s/d–p) transitions [25]. The enhancement of photoluminescence of 1 is attributed to the ligand coordination to the metal center, which effectively increases the rigidity of the ligand and reduces the loss of energy by radiationless decay. In summary, we utilize the single-crystal X-ray diffraction method to characterize the molecular scale hydrogen bonded structure of acyclic (CH3OH)(H2O)5 binary cluster, which is observed in the Ag(I) coordination polymer. This well-resolved heterohexamer may behave as a useful model helping us to further understand phase behavior of binary methanol–water system.

Structural solution and full-matrix least-squares refinement based on F2 were performed with the SHELXS-97 [27] and SHELXL-97 [28] program package, respectively. All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms of organic ligands were generated geometrically and refined with isotropic temperature factors. The hydrogen atoms of oxygen atoms were located in the difference Fourier maps and refined with fixed mode. [12] τ4 is a new four-coordinate geometry index for distortion from a perfect tetrahedral geometry (τ4 =1) to an ideal square planar geometry (τ4 =0), defined as τ4 =[360°−(α+β)]/141°, where α and β represent the two largest angles in the four-coordinate species.

Often the<br>minor alerts point to easily fixed oversights, errors and omissions in your CIF or refinement<br>strategy, so attention to these fine details can be worthwhile. In order to resolve some of the more<br>serious problems it may be necessary to carry out additional measurements or structure<br>refinements. However, the purpose of your study may justify the reported deviations and the more<br>serious of these should normally be commented upon in the discussion or experimental section of a<br>paper or in the "special_details" fields of the CIF. checkCIF was carefully designed to identify<br>outliers and unusual parameters, but every test has its limitations and alerts that are not important<br>in a particular case may appear. Conversely, the absence of alerts does not guarantee there are no<br>aspects of the results needing attention. It is up to the individual to critically assess their own<br>results and, if necessary, seek expert advice.<br>Publication of your CIF in IUCr journals<br>A basic structural check has been run on your CIF. These basic checks will be run on all CIFs<br>submitted for publication in IUCr journals (Acta Crystallographica, Journal of Applied<br>Crystallography, Journal of Synchrotron Radiation); however, if you intend to submit to Acta<br>Crystallographica Section C or E, you should make sure that full publication checks are run on the<br>final version of your CIF prior to submission.<br>Publication of your CIF in other journals<br>Please refer to the Notes for Authors of the relevant journal for any special instructions relating to<br>CIF submission.<br>PLATON version of 18/07/2011; check.def file version of 04/07/2011</p>
