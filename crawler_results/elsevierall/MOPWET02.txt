Tel.: +86 592 2184531; fax: +86 592 2183047 Graphical abstract Under heating, phenanthroline hydrogen phthalato manganese(II) dimer could be cleaved into its related monomer with deprotonation of phthalate ligand. The 1D maleato manganese(II) prepared in an ice bath is converted into double-chain coordination polymer. 1,10-Phenanthroline hydrogen phthalato manganese(II) dimer [Mn2(Hphth)2(phen)4]·2Hphth·6H2O (1), monomeric phenanthroline phthalato manganese(II) monomer [Mn(phth)(phen)2(H2O)]·2.5H2O (2), 2,2′-bipyridine phthalato manganese(II) polymer [Mn(phth)(bpy)(H2O)2] n (3) and 1,10-phenanthroline maleato polymer [Mn(male)(phen)(H2O)2] n ·2nH2O (4) (H2phth= o-phthalic acid, male=maleic acid, phen=1,10-phenanthroline and bpy=2,2′-bipyridine) have been synthesized and characterized spectroscopically and structurally. Each Mn(II) atom in dimeric 1 is octahedrally coordinated by two oxygen atoms of phthalate anions and by two cis-phenanthroline ligands. The hydrogen phthalato anion bridges the Mn(II) ions through the deprotonated carboxyl groups, while the carboxylic acid group remains free. In the monomeric 2, the Mn(II) ion is octahedrally surrounded by four nitrogen atoms from two cis-phen ligands, one carboxyl oxygen from a monodentate phth ion, and one coordinated water molecule. The dimeric phthalato complex 1 can be cleaved into monomer 2 under heating with deprotonation, and the course of the reaction can be qualitatively traced by IR spectra. The phthalate group in the complex 3 binds to two manganese atoms through the vicinal carboxyl-oxygen atoms in syn–syn bridging mode. The Mn(II) atoms are linked by the phthalate group to yield a one-dimensional chain running along the a-axis. The coordination polymer 3 can be obtained from the reaction of dichloro dibipyridine manganese with phthalate under heating. In polymer 4, the manganese atom is six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from phen, two oxygen atoms from the coordinated water molecules and two oxygen atoms from two different maleate dianions. Each maleato unit links two neighboring manganese atoms to yield one-dimensional chain along b-axis in bis-monodentate mode. The single-chain polymer 4 prepared at low temperature can be converted to double-chain coordination polymer [Mn(male)(phen)] n · nH2O (5) with dehydration in warm solution. Keywords Phthalate Maleate Manganese(II) Coordination polymer Conversion 1 Introduction Carboxylato manganese complexes are of current interest in the studies of molecular magnetism and in applications to diverse areas of technology, such as magnetic recording and magnetic optics [1], and they can also serve as model compounds for photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complexes (OEC) [2]. Many efforts have been made to design and synthesize carboxylato manganese complexes with fascinating architectures [3]. In particular, some dicarboxylate anions such as phthalate [4] and maleate [5] groups have been proved to be powerful bridging spacers to construct noteworthy frameworks. Owing to their versatile bonding modes with metal ions and the fact that the carboxyl groups are noncoplanar within themselves, phthalate and maleate anions are good candidates for constructing multi-dimensional supramolecular architectures with different metal ions like copper [6,7], nickel [8,9], cobalt [10], zinc [11], iron [12] and silver [13]. However, up to now, the control of product architecture has been elusive and still remains a major challenge in this field. This is due to the fact that the self-assembly process is frequently influenced by various factors, such as media [14], templates [15], counter-ions [16,17], pH values [18] and temperature [19]. By the judicious choice of the reaction conditions, it is possible to elaborate specific structures, and even to create expected properties related to the architectures. Though it is well known that temperature is an important factor to affect the resultant structural frameworks, the influence of temperature in the formation of complexes is less well understood and systematic studies are rare [20]. To better understanding of temperature effects on the formation of resulted complexes, in the course of our study on manganese complexation by dicarboxylate anions, we pay special attention to the influence of temperature on the structural topology. Recently, we have obtained two temperature-dependent product of maleato manganese(II) polymers [Mn(male)(bpy)(H2O)] n ·2nH2O and [Mn(male)(bpy)] n [5f]. Herein, four dicarboxylate manganese(II) complexes formulated as [Mn2(Hphth)2(phen)4]·2Hphth·6H2O (1) [21], [Mn(phth)(phen)2(H2O)]·2.5H2O (2) [22], [Mn(phth)(bpy)(H2O)2] n (3) [21], and [Mn(male)(phen)(H2O)2] n ·2nH2O (4) [23] were temperature-dependently prepared and structurally characterized, and their related transformations were studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 General remarks All chemicals were analytically pure and used without further purification. Elemental microanalyses were performed on an EA 1100 elemental analyzer. UV–vis spectra were recorded in TU-1901 spectrophotometer and infrared spectra recorded from KBr pellets on a Nicolet FT-IR 360 spectrophotometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. 2.2 Preparation of [Mn2(Hphth)2(phen)4]·2Hphth·6H2O (1) [21] In a slightly different procedure [21], phthalic acid (0.17 g, 1 mmol) in 50% ethanol solution (15 ml) was slowly added to a 50% ethanol solution (20 ml) of manganese(II) chloride tetrahydrate (0.20 g, 1 mmol) with continuous stirring at 0 °C. An ethanol solution (20 ml) of 1,10-phenanthroline (0.20 g, 1 mmol) was added dropwise. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 5.0 with sodium hydroxide solution (1 M, 1 ml).

An ethanol solution (20 ml) of 1,10-phenanthroline (0.20 g, 1 mmol) was added dropwise. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 6.3 with sodium hydroxide solution (1 M, 2 ml).

An ethanol solution (20 ml) of 2,2′-bipyridine (0.16 g, 1 mmol) was added dropwise. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 5.0 with sodium hydroxide solution (1 M, 1 ml). The light yellow product was separated in 92% (0.40 g) yield. Light yellow prismatic crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained after one week by slow evaporation of the mother-liquor in an ice-bath. X-ray analysis showed the resulted compound as [Mn(bpy)Cl2] [24]. 2.7 Conversion of dimeric phthalato manganese [Mn2(Hphth)2(phen)4]·2Hphth·6H2O (1) to monomeric phthalato manganese [Mn(phth)(phen)2(H2O)]2 ·5H2O (2) Dimeric compound 1 (0.10 g) was dissolved in a small amount of water (20 ml) at 60 °C for 12 h. Several days later, sheet-like crystals (0.08 g, yield 95%) were separated by slow evaporation of the mother liquor at room temperature. IR spectra showed the heated product as monomer 2. 2.8 Conversion of [Mn(bpy)2Cl2] to [Mn(phth)(bpy)(H2O)2]n (3) Phthalic acid (0.17 g, 1 mmol) in 50% ethanol solution (15 ml) was slowly added to a 50% ethanol solution (20 ml) of dichloro dibipyridine manganese (0.44 g, 1 mmol) with continuous stirring at 60 °C for 12 h. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 5.0 with sodium hydroxide solution (1 M, 1 ml). After one week, yellow prismatic crystals were separated by slow evaporation of the mother-liquor at room temperature in 95% (0.39 g) yield. IR spectra showed the product as polymer 3. 2.9 Conversion of [Mn(male)(phen)(H2O)2]n ·2nH2O (4) to [Mn(male)(phen)]n ·nH2O (5) The maleato phenanthroline manganese complex 5 [5a, 5d] were prepared as reported. Crystals of 4 (0.42 g) was dissolved in 5 ml water in a warm bath at 40 °C for 12 h. A few days later, the resultant product (0.34 g, yield 94%) was showed to be compound 5 by IR spectra. 2.10 X-ray crystallographic study Diffraction data were measured on a Bruker Smart Apex CCD using Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.7107 Å) at 296 K. A Lorentz polarization factor, anisotropic decay and empirical absorption corrections were applied [25]. The structures were solved by directed methods (shelxs-97) [26] and refined by full-matrix least-squares procedures with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. H atoms were located from difference Fourier map. All calculations were performed on a microcomputer using shelxs-97 program. Crystallographic details are summarized in Table 1 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis Assembly process for the reactions of phthalato and maleato manganese(II) complexes with diamine (1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2′-bipyridine) is summarized in Scheme 1 . The anions are shown corresponding to compound numbers, which represent both in this description. The scheme illustrates the sensitivity of reaction toward temperature in aqueous solutions. In an ice-water bath, a solution containing phthalato manganese(II) 6 [27] and phen results in the separation of dimer 1. On raising the temperature to 60 °C, the dimer 1 could be cleaved into the monomer 2 [22]. To the best of our knowledge, it is common that monomer could be converted to dimer or polymer upon heating. However, the reversed transformation from dimer into monomer is rare. This may be attributed to the effect of bulky conjugated phenanthroline ring in the complex 1. In contrast, a solution containing complex 6 and bpy at low temperature only results in the isolation of dichloro dibipyridine manganese(II) complex 7 [24] without the coordination of phthalate ligands, which can be polymerized to form 3 at warm temperature. It is noted the phthalato bipyridine manganese(II) 3 species has been separated from manganese acetate very recently [21]. Moreover, the reaction of manganese (II) salt, maleate and 1,10-phenanthroline forms polymer 4 at low temperature. On warming to 40 °C, one-dimensional coordination polymer 4 is further converted to double-chain polymer 5 [5a,5d] with dehydration. 3.2 Structure descriptions of complexes 1–4 Complex 1 is a dinuclear Mn(II) complex with phthalic acid and 1,10-phenanthroline. The cation structure of 1 is shown in Fig. 1 , which is similar to that reported in dihydrate form [21]. It has a center of symmetry. Two Mn(II) atoms are bridged by two phthalate ligands to form an 8-membered ring. Each Mn(II) atom lies in a distorted octahedral environment with different configurations of Δ or Λ. The Mn(II) atom is hexacoordinate and possesses an N4O2 environment by virtue of two carboxylate-oxygen atoms from two phthalate ligands and four nitrogen atoms from two chelating phen groups. As for the coordinated phthalic acid in the complex 1, each hydrogen phthalate anion bridges two Mn(II) ions through one of its two carboxyl groups, while the other carboxylic acid group remains free. This is unlike the case in [Mn4(phth)2(bpy)8](ClO4)4 ·3H2O [4g], where each carboxyl group of the phthalate anion bridges two Mn(II) ions in bidentate mode. A strong intermolecular hydrogen bond is found between free carboxylic acid group of coordinated phthalate and carboxyl group of uncoordinated phthalate acid with an O4⋯O8 distance of 2.582(3) Å. Moreover, a very strong intramolecular hydrogen bond [d O6⋯O7 =2.316(2) Å] exists in uncoordinated phthalic acid, which is comparable with the strong hydrogen bonds of 2.376 and 2.381(7) Å in the similar manganese and cobalt complexes [M2(Hphth)2(phen)4]·2Hphth·2H2O [10d, 21]. In complex 2, the crystal structure consists of two independent mononuclear manganese(II) units [Mn(phth)(phen)2(H2O)] similar to its tetrahydrate product [22]. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , each Mn(II) ion is hexacoordinate and has a distorted octahedral coordination sphere. The Mn(II) atom is surrounded by four nitrogen atoms from two chelate phen groups and two oxygen atoms. One is from the coordinated phthalato ligand and the other is from a coordinated water molecule. Among these coordinated atoms, a nitrogen atom of phen and an oxygen atom of phthalate are in the axial position. The orientation of COO− groups in the two types of the phthalate carboxylate groups is almost the same: those in the coordinated ions are rotated around their C–C bonds in the same direction. The dihedral angles are 65.2° and 61.2°, respectively. Strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds exist between O9–O3 and O7–O10 [2.755(3), 2.800(3) Å] in two independent molecules. This is in favor for the stability of 2. Polymeric phthalato bipyridine manganese 3 consists of the phthalato bridged 1D [Mn(phth)(bpy)(H2O)2] chains that is recently reported [21]. As depicted in Fig. 3 , the Mn(II) atoms exist in a distorted octahedral environment, which consists of two nitrogen atoms of one chelating bpy ligand, four oxygen atoms from two water molecules and two different phthalato ligands. The phthalato unit acts as bis-monodentate ligand to link adjacent manganese atoms, yielding an infinite chain along a-axis with the chelating bpy ligands on one side. Within the crystal structure, the 1D chains are so arranged that the side bpy are stacked along [100] direction with the nearest bpy neighbors parallelly facing the opposite directions. Each bpy ligand of one chain is situated at the middle position of the bpy ligands in the adjacent chain. For the bpy planes, the mean interplanar distances are 3.55 Å, indicating significant π–π stacking interactions. It is due to such π–π stacking interactions that the 1D chains are assembled into thick 2D layers parallel to (001), between which the water molecules are sandwiched. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis denotes that the complex 4 is a chain-like polymer, consisting of 1D [Mn(male)(phen)(H2O)2] units [23]. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 , each of the manganese(II) atoms is octahedrally surrounded by two nitrogen atoms from one phenanthroline ligand, four oxygen atoms from two water and two different maleato ligands. In the crystal 4, the maleato dianion serves as bis-monodentate ligand bridging two adjacent manganese(II) atoms through two oxygen atoms of its two ends, forming an infinite one-dimensional chain along b-axis. Neighboring chains are antiparallel to each other, which are assembled into 3D network by intra-chain hydrogen bonding interactions. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2 . The bond distances are in agreement with those reported for the other analogous o-phthalato and maleato diamine manganese(II) complexes [4,5]. The bond-length value of C–O [1.244(5) Å] in 2 is shorter than the C8–O4 length in 1 [1.305(5) Å], indicating the deprotonation of the carboxyl group. Due to the restriction of the bpy five-membered chelate ring, large deviations from the idealized orthogonal geometry are found for N1–Mn1–N2 angle [69.8(1)°] in 3, which is smaller than those of 72.1(2)–73.8(3)° for phen ligands in complexes 1, 2 and 4. This may be attributed to rigidity of phen ligands. 3.3 IR spectroscopy IR spectra of the four complexes display characteristic features of the coordinated phthalato or maleato ligands. For 1, the down frequency absorption appears at 1680 cm−1 for the free COOH stretching, 1588 cm−1 for the asymmetric ν as(COO), indicating the strong hydogen bonding interactions, and 1412 cm−1 for the symmetric ν s(COO). The separation Δ[ν as(COO)− ν s(COO)] is 176 cm−1, which is attributed to the existence of bridging mode of carboxyl groups [28]. For 2, the bands are at 1561 cm−1 for the asymmetric ν as(COO) and 1401 cm−1 for the symmetric ν s(COO); the Δ value are 160 cm−1, attributing to the existence of monodentate fashion. Similar separations of are 168 and 142 cm−1 are observed for 3 and 4, indicating the existence of bis-monodentate mode of carboxyl groups. In conclusion, this work has described the syntheses and transformations of phthalato and maleato manganese(II) complexes derived from different temperatures. It is novel that the dimer 1 could be converted to monomeric 2 under heating, while single-chain polymer 4 could be converted to double-chain polymer 5 on raising the temperature. This indicates that the temperature control is critical in the self-assembly process. The temperature effect changes the modes of phthalate and maleate coordination, in turn, and this results in the final stable structural frameworks.
