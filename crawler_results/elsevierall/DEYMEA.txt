Two new mixed-ligands CdII complexes of trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene (bpe) with 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp) and 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), [Cd(phen)2(bpe)(H2O)](ClO4)2 ·H2O (1) and [Cd(bpp)2(H2O)2](ClO4)2 ·bpe· H2O (2) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR-,1H NMR- and 13C NMR spectroscopy and studied by thermal as well as X-ray crystallography. The structural study of 1 show the compound is monomeric with coordination environments of distorted octahedral CdN5O and mononuclear units further liked into a hydrogen-bonded dimmer via intermolecular N⋯O interactions. The single crystal X-ray analysis of 2 shows that the complex is a one-dimensional polymer as a result of bridging two 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp) ligands. The one-dimensional chains are further self-assembled into a three-dimensional network with channels by mixed bridges of free bpe molecules and hydrogen-bonded 8-membered rings based on free water molecules and ClO 4 - anions. Keywords Cadmium trans-1,2-Bis(4-pyridyl)ethene 1,3-Di(4-pyridyl)propane 1,10-Phenanthroline Coordination polymers 1 Introduction The design of coordination networks with porous structures or open frameworks including removable solvents or exchangeable ions that provide new sizes, shapes, and chemical environments has been of great interest in recent years, due to their potential for many applications [1–3]. On the other hand, so far most of the coordination polymers have been built with same ligands. There are also a few interesting examples that have been reported, including some bridging ligand combinations [4]. However, the development of systems containing both chelating and bridging ligands using the same atom as the donors are rather rare. As d10 metal ion Cd2 are particularly suited for the construction of coordination polymers and networks. The spherical d10 configuration is associated with a flexible coordination environment so that geometries of these complexes can vary from tetrahedral to octahedral and severe distortions in the ideal polyhedron easily occur. Furthermore, due to the general lability of Zn and Cd complexes, the formation of coordination bonds is reversible which enables metal ions and ligands to rearrange during the process of polymerization to give highly ordered network structures. Consequently, Cd can readily accommodate all kind of architectures and a selection of topological types of 1D, 2D and 3D polymers is given. Herein, we report the syntheses, structure, and thermal behavior of two new CdII assemblies of trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene (bpe) with 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp) as bridging and 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) as chelating ligand, [Cd(phen)2(bpe)(H2O)](ClO4)2 ·H2O (1) and [Cd(bpp)2(H2O)2](ClO4)2 ·bpe·H2O (2) provides new monomeric units and one-dimensional coordination polymers, respectively. 2 Experimental part 2.1 Preparation of [Cd(phen)2(bpe)(H2O)](ClO4)2 ·H2O (1) To a magnetically stirred solution of cadmium(II) acetate (0.115g, 0.50mmol) and sodium perchlorate (0.122g, 1mmol) was added dropwise a mixture of 0.50mmol (0.09g) of 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene (bpe) and 0.5mmol (0.10g) of 1,10-phenanthroline were mixed in methanol at room temperature over 30min. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1h at room temperature. A single crystal suitable for X-ray analysis was obtained by slow evaporation of this solution at room temperature (d.p. 300°C), which were filtered off, washed with acetone and air dried.

The intensity data were collected within the range 1.72⩽ θ ⩽25.22° for 1 and 1.81⩽ θ ⩽25.01° for 2 using graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F 2. Structure solution and refinement was accomplished using sir97, shelxl97 and wingx [5,6]. The all H atoms were positioned geometrically and allowed to ride on their parent atoms. The molecular structure plots were prepared by using ORTEPIII [7].

IR spectrum display characteristic absorption bands for bpe, phen, bpp, H2O ligands and perchlorate anions. The relatively weak absorption bands at around 3055 and 3045cm−1 is due to the C–H modes involving the aromatic ring hydrogen atoms. The C–H modes involving the aliphatic hydrogen atoms of bpe and bpp reveal at 2920 and 2930cm−1. The absorption bands with variable intensity in the frequency range 1400–1580cm−1 correspond to ring vibrations the py moiety of the bpe, bpp and phen ligands. The characteristic bands of the perchlorate anions appear at 1005 and 1082cm−1. The broad absorption band at 3488 and 3505cm−1 are assigned to the ν(H2O) modes. The broad band is perhaps attributable to ν(O–H⋯X), indicating the presence of hydrogen bonds, which has been confirmed by the crystal structure determination of these complexes. The 1H NMR spectrum of the DMSO solution of the compounds 1–2 displays two different protons of py groups of the bpe and bpp. The1H NMR spectrum of the 1 shows another band at 7.65ppm assigned to protons of CHCH group of bpe molecule and the 1H NMR spectrum of the 2 displays two other bands at 1.90 and 2.61ppm assigned to protons of –CH2–CH2–CH2– of bpp molecule. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 shows four another bands assigned to protons of phen ligand. The 13C NMR spectrum of the DMSO solution of the compounds 1–2 has three distinct absorption bands assigned to the aromatic carbons of py groups of the bpe and bpp. The 13C NMR spectrum of the 1 displays one other band at 131.1 ppm assigned to carbons of CHCH group of bpe molecule and the 13C NMR spectrum of the 2 displays two other bands at 30.0 and 33.8ppm assigned to carbons of –CH2–CH2–CH2– of bpp molecule. The13C NMR spectrum of the 1 displays six other assigned to carbon atoms of phen ligand. 4.2 Thermal studies The thermal decomposition behavior of Cd(phen)2(bpe)(H2O)](ClO4)2 ·H2O (1) and [Cd(bpp)2(H2O)2](ClO4)2 ·bpe·H2O (2) was investigated in static air atmosphere from ambient to 700°C (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Compound 1 does not melt and is stable up to 300°C at which temperature it begins to decompose. Removal two water molecules and one bpe ligand as well as decomposition of two perchlorate anions takes place in 300–430°C with two exothermic effects at 330 and 425°C. The experimental mass loss is 44.70% [calcd.: 45.20%]. The solid residue formed at around 430°C is suggested to be Cd(phen)2O. The weight loss of 40.10% from 510 to 590°C is equivalent to the loss of two coordinated phen molecules [calcd.: 40.45] with an exothermic effect at 580°C. The solid residue formed at around 600°C is suggested to be CdO. Compound 2 at 50°C begins to decompose. Removal of three water molecules takes place in 50–130°C and the experimental mass loss of 7.56% is consistent with the calculated value 5.60% for the elimination of three H2O with an endothermic effect at 87.6°C. The weight loss of 18.80% from 248 to 317°C is equivalent to the loss of one uncoordinated bpe molecule [calcd.: 18.70%] with one endothermic effect at 292.3°C. The solid residue formed at around 362°C is suggested to be [Cd(bpp)2](ClO4)2. Removal two coordinated bpp and decomposing of perchlorate anions takes place at 362–457°C [weight loss: 59.80, calcd.: 60.17%] with three exothermic effects at 360, 380 and 462°C. The solid residue formed at around 462°C is suggested to be CdO. 4.3 Structural studies Determination of the structure of the compound 1 by X-ray crystallography showed the complex in solid state (Fig. 3 ) consists of monomeric units. The cadmium atoms are linked by four nitrogen atoms of phen ligands, one nitrogen atom of bpe ligand and one oxygen atom of water molecule and can be considered to be six-coordinate with N5O donor atoms array. The coordination around Cd is distorted octahedral. The one nitrogen atom of the bpe ligand is not coordinated to Cd atoms (Fig. 3) and indeed this ligand act as a less commonly unidentate ligand. The nitrogen atom from bpe ligand and oxygen atom of water are in cis position [the angles N5–Cd1–O1 is 85.50] and two phen ligands are in cis position. The aromatic rings of coordinated bpe are coplanar, because the dihedral angle between the two py rings within this bpe ligand is only 0.27°. There is one other water molecule that was not coordinated to the cadmium atom. The hydrogen atom of un- and coordinated water molecules are involved in hydrogen bonding, acting as hydrogen-bond donors with O atoms of perchlorate and uncoordinated N atoms of bpe ligand. The hydrogen bond distances d(D–H), d(H⋯A), d(D⋯A), and angle ∠(DHA) are given in the Table 4 . Compound 1 forms the dimeric units (Fig. 2a) by the hydrogen bonding of nitrogen atom of bpe ligand and hydrogen atom of coordinated water molecule. There are π–π stacking [8,9] interactions between aromatic rings of bpe ligands belonging to dimeric units in compound 1. The py groups of bpe are almost parallel and this parallel array of the planes of the aromatic moieties indicates that these interactions are of the face-to-face π-stacking type [9,10]. The centroid–centroid distance of py groups is 3.7Å and the angle between the ring normal and the centroid vectors is 34.41° (see Fig. 4 ). Determination of the structure of the compound 2 by X-ray crystallography showed the complex in solid state (Fig. 5 ) consists of one-dimensional polymeric units and has been formed from four components, one cation [Cd(μ-bpp)2(H2O)2]2+, two perchlorate anions, one uncoordinated bpe and one lattice water molecule. The cadmium atoms are linked by four nitrogen atoms of bpp ligands and two oxygen atoms of water molecule and can be considered to be six-coordinate with N4O2 donor atoms array. The coordination around Cd is distorted octahedral. There are one bpe molecules that were not coordinated to the cadmium atom and in this compound two pyridine rings of bpe have a dihedral angle only 1.94° and are nearly coplanar (Fig. 3). There are classical N–H⋯O and N–H⋯N hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen atoms of the water molecules and oxygen and nitrogen atoms of perchlorate and bpe groups. The hydrogen bond distances d(D–H), d(H⋯A), d(D⋯A), and angle ∠(DHA) are given in the Table 5 . The hydrogen atom of coordinated water molecules are involved in hydrogen bonding, acting as hydrogen-bond donors with N atoms from uncoordinated bpe molecules and with O atoms from perchlorate anions. Consequently, hydrogen bonds grow the structure into a hybrid three-dimensional network (Fig. 6 ). There are three conformations of the bpp ligand. This flexible ligand usually shows TT, TG or GG conformations with quite different N-to-N distances (within the 6.7–10.1Å range) [11,12]. Self-assembly of bpp ligands in the compound 2 are less commonly GG conformations with a N-to-N distances of 9.677Å (Fig. 5).
