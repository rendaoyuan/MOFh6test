A new three-dimensional (3D) metal-organic framework (MOF) [Cd(tpa)Cl](CH3)4 N+ (1; tpa=1, 4-terephthalic acid) with unusual Cd2 (COO)4Cl2 building block has been solvothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by the aid of single crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Elemental analysis (EA) and Infrared Spectroscopy (IR). The Cd2(COO)4Cl2 building block can be simplified as 4-connected or two 3-connected nods in different ways, correspondingly, the compound 1 exhibits 4-connected dia or 3-connected ths structural topology. Graphical abstract Presented here is a new 4-connected dia or 3-connected ths cadmium-organic framework with unusual Cd2(COO)4Cl2 building blocks. Highlights ► A metal-organic framework with unusual Cd2(COO)4Cl2 building blocks. ► A metal-organic framework with dia or ths structural topology. ► Solvothermal synthesis of a photoluminescent compound. Keywords Metal-organic framework Cadmium Topology SBUs Crystal structure Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have recently attracted considerable interest not only for their potential applications in gas storage, separation, sensing and heterogeneous catalysis, but also for fascinating architectures and intriguing topologies [1,2]. The architectures of MOFs are mainly depended on the assembly of metals and linkers. The molecular secondary building units (SBUs) are essential to the design of directionality for the construction of MOFs and to the achievement of robust frameworks [3]. SBUs usually not only have predefined and often rigid coordination geometries, but also always generated in situ, which often provides a versatile pool of connectors for the rational synthesis of targeted MOFs [4]. It is noteworthy that SBUs also play an important role in the structural design and synthesis of metal-carboxylate frameworks. Indeed, some famous framework materials such as MOF-5, MIL-101 and HKUST-1 etc., are all based on the assembly of metals and carboxylate ligands [1a,5]. In MOF-5, a cationic oxide-centered Zn4O tetrahedron is edge-bridged by six carboxylates to give the neutral octahedron-shaped SBU that reticulates into a three-dimensional (3D) cubic porous network with pcu type topology [5a]. The design idea of MIL-101 is that leading to the existence of trimeric inorganic building blocks consists of three metal octahedra, each coordinated by four bridging carboxylate groups sharing a μ 3-O common vertex [CrIII 3O(CO2)6] [1a]. Simulations were then performed to combine these inorganic trimers in 3D space with 1, 3, 5-benzene tricarboxylate (btc) through the assembly of a computationally designed hybrid building block. HKUST-1 is formed by binuclear paddle-wheel units [Zn2(CO2)4] linked by four btc Ligands, connected into a (3, 4)-connected tbo type topology [5b]. Through the building block approach and the reticular synthesis strategy, many analogues famous frameworks can be designed and synthetic. In this work, we reported the synthesis and structure and photoluminescence (PL) of a new compound [Cd(tpa)Cl](CH3)4 N+ (1; tpa=1, 4-terephthalic acid) with unusual Cd2 (COO)4Cl2 building block synthesized under solvothermal condition. The Cd2(COO)4Cl2 building block can be simplified as 4-connected or two 3-connected nods in different ways, correspondingly, the compound 1 exhibits 4-connected dia or 3-connected ths structural topology. Compound 1 was solvothermally synthesized by employing CdCl2·3H2O, 1, 4-terephthalic acid (H2tpa), and (CH3)4NBr in N, N’-Dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent at 120°C for 3days [6]. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group Fddd and possesses an extended 3D framework [7]. The asymmetric unit of 1 includes one half Cd2+ center, one half tpa ligand, one half chlorine anion, and one half (CH3)4 N+ cation (Fig. 1a). In the structure of 1, the Cd atom adopts distorted octahedral geometry coordinated by four oxygen atoms from two carboxylate groups of two tpa ligands and two chlorine atoms. The Cd–O distances are ranging from 2.314(3) to 2.374(3) Å, and the Cd–Cl distance is 2.5596(12) Å. Three carboxylate groups of the tpa ligand adopt chelating coordination mode, which link two Cd atoms (Fig. 1c). Two Cd ion are bridged by two chlorine atoms and chelated by four carboxylate groups into an symmetrical dinuclear unit Cd2(COO)4Cl2 (Fig. 1b). Here the Cd…Cd distance is 3.6670(1) Å. The resulting dinuclear units are further connected by the tpa ligands to form a anion three-dimensional (3D) framework with interesting oval nanotube channels, in which the (CH3)4 N+ cations fill the free spaces and also balance the whole charges (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, three such frameworks are mutually interpenetrated (Fig. 1d). An interesting structural feature of 1 is the presence of the 4-connected dia or 3-connected ths topology network in different ways. Topological analysis was performed by Topos4.0 [8]. The symmetrical dinuclear unit Cd2(COO)4Cl2 units can be viewed as 4-connected nodes, and the btc ligand can be reduced as a line (L) (Fig. 2a). Therefore, the three-fold interpenetration 3D framework of 1 can be simplified as a 4-connected dia net (Fig. 2b). Just considering the Cd atom as the node, the symmetrical dinuclear unit Cd2(COO)4Cl2 units can be viewed as two 3-connected nodes showing Fig. 2c, thus the 3D framework of 1 can be simplified as a 3-connected ths net (Fig. 2d). The as-synthesized samples of 1 have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Figure S1). The experimental PXRD patterns correspond well with the results simulated from the single crystal data, indicating the pure phase of 1. The difference in reflection intensities between the simulated and experimental patterns was due to the variation in preferred orientation of the powder samples during the collection of the experimental PXRD data. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10°C/min was performed on polycrystalline sample to determine their thermal stability from 25 to 800°C. The result indicated that the host framework was stable up to ca. 290°C (Figure S2). After that temperature, the framework decomposed. The emission spectrum of 1 was measured in the solid state at room temperature. It exhibited one intense emission at 437nm upon photoexcitation at 350nm (Fig. 3 ). In comparison, the intense emission of the free H2tpa ligand was at 385nm. So the emission bond of 1 may be attributed to the ligand centered charge transfer (n→π* or π→π*). In summary, we presented here a new 3-fold interpenetration metal organic framework with 4-connected dia or 3-connected ths structural topology based on the Cd2(COO)4Cl2 building blocks. The compound exhibited interesting topology and photoluminescent property. These results demonstrated that the building blocks played an important role in the structure design and synthesis.

<p>Publication of your CIF<br>You should attempt to resolve as many as possible of the alerts in all categories.
