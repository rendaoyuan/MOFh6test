Graphical abstract Three new Cd(II) coordination polymers with different topological structures, namely, [Cd(hbdmbm)(SO4)]n (1), {[Cd3(hbdmbm)4(5-SSPIA)2]·(H2O)2} n (2) and [Cd3(bbdmbm)4(5-SSPIA)2] n (3) have been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The anionic ligands play important structure-directing role in the assembly of the title complexes. Three new Cd(II) coordination polymers, [Cd(hbdmbm)(SO4)] n (1), {[Cd3(hbdmbm)4(5-SSPIA)2]·(H2O)2} n (2) and [Cd3(bbdmbm)4(5-SSPIA)2] n (3), based on different O-containing anionic ligands and flexible bis(benzimidazole) derivatives (hbdmbm=1,1′-(1,6-hexanediyl)bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole), bbdmbm=1,1′-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole), 5-SSPIA=sodium 3,5-dicarboxybenzenesulfonate), have been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Structure analysis illustrates that complex 1 possesses a 2D (4, 4) network constructed from the binuclear [Cd(SO4)]2 secondary building unit (SBU) and the hbdmbm. Complex 2 shows a 2D/3D crossed 3D framework with Schläfli symbol of (63)2(65·8)(68·82)2. In 2, Cd(II) ions are connected by hbdmbm ligands to construct a 3D framework showing a topological octagon geometry, and also linked by 5-SSPIA to construct a 2D layer with polygon geometry, in which 5-SSPIA anions act as three-connected nodes. Complex 3 shows more complicated 3D framework with Schläfli symbol (4·64·8)(4·82)(42·53·63·7·8)(42·53·6)(5·6·7·82·9), which contains two kinds of SBUs built by 5-SSPIA and bbdmbm. 5-SSPIA anions act as three-connected nodes and four-connected nodes in 3. The structure-directing role of anionic ligands and the effects of conformations of N-donor ligands on the final structures are discussed. In addition, fluorescence properties of complexes 1–3 are also reported in this paper. Keywords Structure-directed 3,5-Dicarboxybenzenesulfonate Hydrothermal syntheses Crystal structure Bis(benzimidazole) derivatives 1 Introduction The design and syntheses of metal-organic coordination polymers with transition metal and organic multidentate ligands have attracted a great deal of interest in the past decade, not only because of their novel topological structures, but also owing to their potential applications in gas storage, luminescence, magnetism and catalysis [1–8]. The topological structures of these coordination polymers could be modulated by selecting the metals, ligands and reaction conditions, such as temperature, pH value of the solution and metal-to-ligand ratio [9–14]. Among these factors, ligands play a crucial role in the construction of target networks. However, the controllable synthesis of the transition metal complexes is still a great challenge. Compared with the common rigid ligands, flexible N-donor ligands, which contain twist-free spacers and exhibit various conformations, have been proved to be excellent building blocks in the formation of coordination polymers [15–16]. Many complexes containing flexible N-donor ligands bpp, bix or bbbt [bpp=1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)-propane, bix=1,4-bis(imdazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene, bbbt=1,1′-(1,4-butanediyl)bis-1H-benzotriazole] have been reported by Lang, Bu, Ma groups [17–20]. In our previous work, we have obtained some transition metal coordination polymers with flexible N-donor ligands pbbm, bbbm, pbdmbm and ebdmbm and different polycarboxylates [pbbm=bis(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)propane, bbbm=bis(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)butane, pbdmbm=1,1′-(1,3-propanediyl)bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole), ebdmbm=1,1′-(1,2-ethanediyl)bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole)] [21–23]. To our knowledge, the complexes with bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole) derivatives are still limited and worth systematic investigating. As is well known, anions can influence the structures of transition metal complexes by coordinating directly to the metal centers [24]. In contrast to common ploycarboxylate anionic ligands, sulfonates anions usually exhibit weak binding capacity, which make the reports on the sulfonates-based complexes relatively limited up to now [25–30]. As an extension of our previous work [23,31], in this work, the flexible bis(benzimidazole) derivatives 1,1′-(1,6-hexanediyl)bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole) (hbdmbm) and 1,1′-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole) (bbdmbm) were used as the main ligands, sulfate and sodium 3,5-dicarboxybenzenesulfonate (5-SSPIA) were selected as anionic ligands (Scheme 1 ), aiming for investigating the effect of anionic ligands on the construction of transition metal complexes. As a result, three new Cd(II) coordination polymers, namely, [Cd(hbdmbm)(SO4)] n (1), {[Cd3(hbdmbm)4(5-SSPIA)2]·(H2O)2} n (2) and [Cd3(bbdmbm)4(5-SSPIA)2] n (3) have been obtained. The photoluminescence properties of the complexes have been reported. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and measurements All chemicals were supplied commercially and used without further purification. The bbdmbm and hbdmbm ligands were synthesized by the method of literatures [17,18]. FT-IR spectra (KBr pellets) were taken on a Magna FT-IR 560 spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240CHN analyzer.

The crystal structures of 1–3 were solved by the direct method and refined on F2 by full-matrix least-squares technique with the SHELXL-97 software package [32]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms of ligands were placed in geometrically idealized positions and refined isotropically except complex 2. In the complex 2, because part of the hbdmbm ligands are disordered and the C20 and C20′ positions were refined with half-occupancy atoms, hydrogen atoms of C20 and C20′ cannot be placed in geometrically idealized positions. In complex 3, the C90 position was refined with disordered. The details of crystallographic information for complexes 1–3 are summarized in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and angles of complexes 1–3 are listed in Table S1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Description of crystal structures 3.1.1 [Cd(hbdmbm)(SO4)] n (1) The crystal structure analysis reveals that complex 1 is a 2D network constructed from SO4 2− anions and hbdmbm ligands. The asymmetric unit consists of one Cd(II) atom, one SO4 2− anion and one hbdmbm ligand. Each Cd(II) atom shows a distorted octahedral coordination geometry by two nitrogen atoms (N1, N3) from two separated hbdmbm ligands, four oxygen atoms (O1, O1A, O2, O3) of two SO4 2− anions with the Cd–N and Cd–O distances of 2.227(4)–2.238(3)Å and 2.228(3)–2.449(3)Å, respectively (Fig. 1 ). The SO4 2− anion displays μ2 –η1, η1, η0, η2 coordination modes and bridges two adjacent Cd(II) atoms to form a binuclear [CdSO4]2 secondary building unit (SBU), with the Cd(II)⋯Cd(II) distance of 3.7872(11)Å. In this complex, hbdmbm ligands adopt a trans–trans–trans–cis–trans conformation, linking adjacent SBUs to build a 2D (4, 4) network, with the distance of 17.4630(42)Å for two SBUs, as shown in Fig. 2 . 3.1.2 {[Cd3(hbdmbm)4(5-SSPIA)2]·(H2O)2} n (2) When the inorganic SO4 2− anion in 1 was replaced by organic 5-SSPIA anion, a 3D framework 2 is obtained. The asymmetric unit of 2 contains three Cd(II) atoms, four hbdmbm ligands, two 5-SSPIA anions and two lattice water molecules. There are two crystallographically independent Cd(II) atoms in the complex 2, and their coordination environments are shown in Fig. 3 . Cd1 exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry coordinated by three nitrogen atoms (N1, N3, N7) of three separated hbdmbm ligands (Cd–N=2.302(4)–2.317(6)Å), two oxygen atoms (O6, O7) of a chelating carboxylic group and one oxygen atom (O1) of a sulfo group from 5-SSPIA (Cd–O=2.348(5)–2.602(9)Å). Similar to Cd1, Cd2 also shows a distorted octahedral geometry coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N6, N6A) of two hbdmbm ligands (Cd–N=2.261(6)Å), four oxygen atoms (O4, O4A, O5, O5A) of chelating carboxylic groups from two different 5-SSPIA anions (Cd–O=2.261(6)–2.517(5)Å). In complex 2, hbdmbm ligands act as linkers connecting adjacent Cd(II) atoms to form a 1D chain (Fig. 4 a), which is extended further by hbdmbm to construct a 3D framework (Fig. 4c). It is noted that the 3D framework contains the octagon motifs. Every octagon motif is built by eight Cd(II) atoms and eight hbdmbm ligands (Fig. 4b). On the other hand, each 5-SSPIA anion acts as three-connected node linking three Cd(II) atoms with chelate and monodentate coordination modes. The adjacent Cd(II) atoms are also connected by 5-SSPIA anions to form a 2D polygon layer with the Schläfli symbol (63), in which the dodecagonal rings based on six Cd(II) atoms and six 5-SSPIA anions are included (see Fig. 5 ). Finally, the Cd(II)-5-SSPIA 2D polygon layer crossed with the Cd(II)-hbdmbm 3D network to a complicated 2D/3D crossed 3D framework, as depicted in Fig. 6 . In the view of topology, Cd1 and Cd2 centers represent different nodes in this complex. Each Cd1 acts as a five-connected node, linking two 5-SSPIA anions and three hbdmbm ligands with the distances of 13.112–13.451 Å for Cd(II) centers. While Cd2 acts as a four-connected node, linking two 5-SSPIA anions and two hbdmbm ligands, with the distance of 13.322 Å for Cd(II) centers. 5-SSPIA anions are simplified as three-connected nodes, linking two adjacent Cd1 atoms and one Cd2 atom. Thus, the total topology of 2 can be simplified and classified as a trinodal (63)2(65·8)(68·82)2 topology, as depicted in Fig. 6. 3.1.3 [Cd3(bbdmbm)4(5-SSPIA)2] n (3) When the hbdmdm ligand in 2 was replaced by bbdmbm ligand with shorter spacer, a novel and complicated 3D framework of complex 3 is obtained. The asymmetric unit of complex 3 contains three crystallographically independent Cd(II) atoms, four bbdmbm ligands and two 5-SSPIA anions. Cd(II) atoms show different coordination environment (Fig. 7 ). Cd1 is six-coordinated by three nitrogen atoms (N2, N11, N13) from three bbdmbm ligands, one oxygen atom (O1) of one sulfo group from 5-SSPIA and two oxygen atoms (O2, O3) of chelating carboxylic group from 5-SSPIA anion. Cd2 adopts five-coordinated mode connected by two nitrogen atoms (N3, N7) of two bbdmbm ligands, one oxygen atom (O6) of one monodentate carboxylic group and two oxygen atoms (O4, O5) of one chelating carboxylic group from 5-SSPIA anion. The six-coordinated site of Cd3 is occupied by two nitrogen atoms (N6, N10) of two bbdmbm ligands, two oxygen atoms (O9, O10) of two monodentate carboxylic groups and two oxygen atoms (O7, O8) of one chelating carboxylic group from the 5-SSPIA anion. The Cd–N and Cd–O distances are in the range of 2.223(8)–2.355(8)Å and 2.182(6)–2.488(8)Å, respectively. The sulfo groups and carboxylic groups of 5-SSPIA anions exhibit different coordination modes in complex 3, which leads to two kinds of SBUs based on Cd(II) atoms and 5-SSPIA anions. Carboxylic groups show monodentate and chelate coordination modes, while sulfo groups adopt monodentate and bi(monodentate) coordination modes. The adjacent Cd1 atoms (Cd1A, Cd1B) are connected by chelating carboxylic groups and monodentate sulfo groups of two 5-SSPIA anions, forming a quadrangular SBU(I) (Fig. 8 a). The adjacent SBU(I) are linked by the bbdmbm ligands to build a 1D chain (see Fig. 8b). Five Cd(II) atoms (Cd2C, Cd2D, Cd3A, Cd3B, Cd3C) are linked through three 5-SSPIA anions and two bbdmbm ligands to construct chair-shape SBU(II) (Fig. 9 a). The neighboring SBUs(II) are extended into 1D chains by sharing 5-SSPIA and bbdmbm ligands, which are further connected by bbdmbm ligands to form a 2D network (see Fig. 9b, c). The 2D network is further expanded by SBU(I) into a 3D framework as shown in Fig. 10 . In the view of topology, Cd(II) centers and 5-SSPIA anions are simplified as nodes. Cd1 and Cd2 are regarded as four-connected nodes coordinating with two bbdmbm and two 5-SSPIA anions. Cd3 is surrounded by two bbdmbm and three 5-SSPIA anions, which can be regarded as a five-connected node. 5-SSPIA anions act as three-connected and four-connected nodes, which are linked by one Cd2 and two Cd1 atoms or one Cd2 and three Cd3 atoms, respectively. Hence, the overall framework for 3 can be regarded as a 3D framework with Schläfli symbols (4·64·8)(4·82)(42·53·63·7·8)(42·53·6)(5·6·7·82·9) (See Fig. 10). 3.2 The structure-directing role of anionic ligands and effect of conformations of N-donor ligands on the structure of the title complexes Three Cd(II) coordination polymers with different topological structures were successfully obtained through using flexible bis(benzimidazole) derivatives in the presence of inorganic SO4 2− and organic 5-SSPIA anions. In complex 1, when SO4 2− anion was used as anionic ligand, a 2D (4, 4) network was obtained, in which SO4 2− anion adopts two kinds of coordination modes. When 5-SSPIA anion with different size, charge and coordination capability was selected in complexes 2 and 3, two complicated 3D frameworks were obtained, which indicated that the anionic ligands played important structure-directing role in the construction of the title complexes. 5-SSPIA anions exhibit different coordination modes and constructed different coordination motifs in complexes 2 and 3 (Fig. S1). In complex 2, carboxylic groups of 5-SSPIA anions adopt chelating coordination mode and sulfo groups show monodentate coordination mode. Thus 5-SSPIA anions can be simplified as three-connected nodes to coordinate with Cd(II) generating a 2D polygon motifs, and finally leading to the construction of a 3D framework with Schläfli symbol (63)2(65·8)(68·82)2. In complex 3, carboxylic groups of 5-SSPIA anions adopt two coordination modes (monodentate and chelating) and sulfo groups also show two coordination modes (monodentate and bi(monodentate)). In addition, 5-SSPIA anions act as three-connected node and four-connected node simultaneously to join the metal centers forming two kinds of SBUs, ultimately resulting in the formation of a complicated 3D framework with Schläfli symbol (4·64·8)(4·82)(42·53·63·7·8)(42·53·6)(5·6·7·82·9). Clearly, the anionic ligands are not only used as counteranions in constructing coordination polymers, but also act as multinode linkers playing structure-directing role in assembly of the complexes 1–3. Compared with rigid ligands, flexible N-donor ligands may represent various conformations in constructing complexes. In complexes 1 and 2, we use hbdmbm ligand with six –CH2– spacers as linker. The hbdmbm ligands exhibit three kinds of conformations in the complexes: trans–trans–trans–cis–trans, cis–trans–trans–trans–cis and trans–cis–cis–cis–trans, respectively (Fig. S2a–d). The distances between Cd(II) centers linked by these ligands are in the range of 13.112–17.4630Å. In complex 1, the flexible hbdmbm with two terminal N atoms link the adjacent binuclear SBUs to generate a 2D structure. In complex 2, hbdmbm ligands join the Cd(II) atoms to build a 3D network with octagon motifs and also link the adjacent 2D Cd-5-SSPIA polygonal layer into a 2D/3D crossed framework. While in complex 3, bbdmbm ligands with four –CH2– spacers represent two kinds of conformations: cis–cis–trans and cis–trans–cis, respectively (Fig. S2e–g). The distances between Cd(II) centers linked by these ligands are in the range of 10.567–12.515Å. The bbdmbm ligands link adjacent SBU(I) to build a multi–quadrangular chain and also connect SBU(II) to form a double chain, and ultimately to construct the 3D framework. In addition, center Cd(II) metals also exhibit different coordination numbers in these complexes. Cd(II) atoms adopt six-coordinated mode in complexes 1 and 2, while adopt five-coordinated and six-coordinated modes in complex 3. As depicted above, complexes 1 and 2 differ in their anionic ligands and 2 and 3 differ in their N-donor ligands. In addition, complexes 1 and 3 both contain the binuclear SBUs but complex 2 doesn’t, which may be also attributed to the differences of anions and N-donor ligands used in these complexes. Therefore, the anionic and neutral ligands have a great effect on the final structures of the title complexes. 3.3 Properties 3.3.1 IR spectroscopy The characteristic absorption bands of the IR spectra from complexes 1–3 concern the aromatic rings, –CH3, –CH2– from the hbdmbm or bbdmbm ligands and the carboxylate groups of 5-SSPIA. The bands at about 830cm−1, 1490cm−1, 1505cm−1 in complexes 1–3 can be attributed to ν C–N of N–heterocyclic rings of flexible ligands. The bands at about 2985cm−1 for 1 (2980cm−1 for 2; 2980cm−1 for 3) can be considered as ν C–C of –CH3 and –CH2– of the ligands. The strong bands at 1300cm−1 to 1600cm−1 can be attributed to ν(–COO) of 5-SSPIA. The IR spectra show the strong absorption bands at about 1100–1450cm−1, relating to the (–SO3) from the 5-SSPIA carboxylic anions [33]. 3.3.2 Fluorescence properties of complexes 1–3 The solid-state luminescent properties of Cd(II) complexes 1–3, together with N donor ligands, were studied at room temperature. As depicted in Fig. 11 , it can be observed that all the complexes exhibit intense emission bands under the experimental conditions. The emission peaks of complexes 1–2 are found at approximately 321nm and 395nm under the excitation wavelength of 270nm and 300nm, respectively. The free ligand hbdmbm presents emission at 355nm. For complex 3, the emission peak is observed at 390nm under the excitation peak at 290nm. While the free bbdmbm ligand displays the emission at 328nm. Compared with the ligands, the obvious blue-shift or red-shift occurred in the title complexes, which may be attributed to charge transition between metal atoms and ligands [34,35]. 4 Conclusion In summary, three new 2D or 3D Cd(II) coordination polymers with different topological structures have been synthesized based on two kinds of anionic ligands and the flexible bis(benzimidazole) derivatives ligands with different length spacers. The anionic ligands with coordination diversities play an important structure-directing role in the formation of complexes 1–3 with multidimensional networks. Meanwhile, the differences of conformations and flexibility of bis(benzimidazole) derivatives ligands have the influence on the final structures of complexes 2–3. In addition, the fluorescent properties of complexes 1–3 suggest that the title complexes may be the potential fluorescence materials.
