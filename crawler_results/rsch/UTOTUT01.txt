The former two complexes are two-dimensional (2D) covalent layers built from butterﬂy-shaped tetranuclear M4(m3-OH)2 clusters and double atz- and nip2- linkers. Whereas complex 3 is a 3D framework with scarcely observed corner-sharing Cu3(m3-OH) D-chains extended by nip2- linkages, in which the anionic atz- ligand acts as a reinforcement to consolidate the D-chain. Magnetically, due to the interplay of the anisotropy of spin carrier and magnetic exchange interactions from the adjacent spin carriers, the complexes exhibit spin-canted antiferromagnetism with a N´eel temperature lower than 2.0 K for 1 and an antiferromagnetic ordering with a slight ﬁeld-induced spin-ﬂop transition for 2. In contrast, complex 3 with a local Kagom´e sublattice displays spin-frustrated antiferromagnetic behavior with magnetic ordering at 16.0 K. Introduction Molecular-based magnetic materials with aesthetically pleasing structures and rich magnetic couplings are continuously pursued because of their promising applications in quantum computation and information storage, as well as their signiﬁcance in the inter- pretation of the fundamental magneto-structural correlations.1–3 Undoubtedly, a synthetic challenge involves discovering simple and efﬁcient approaches to incorporate two or more paramagnetic metal ions in a small, single molecular entity or in a high- dimensional robust framework by a short bridging ligand or by a combination of different ligands with appended bridging groups. Magnetically, the interplay between the magnetic nature of the spin carrier and the superexchange interaction by bridging magnetic bridges inﬂuences the magnetism of the entity in ways which are complicated and hard to predict.

To the best of our knowledge, mixed tetrazolate– polycarboxylate magnetic samples have been scarcely reported by far, although triazolate–azide,6 hydroxyl–carboxylate10 and azide–carboxylate-based11,23 magnetic systems have been recently built. As a result, three new spin carrier-directed coordination polymers, two M4(m3-OH)2 cluster-based 2D layers (M = CoII for 1 and MnII for 2) and one scarcely observed Cu3(m3-OH) D-chain- derived 3D framework (3), were solvo-/hydrothermally generated. Signiﬁcantly depending on the strong single-ion anisotropy of CoII and the distorted coordination environments of MnII ion, the former two complexes exhibit spin-canted antiferromagnetism with a N´eel temperature (T N) lower than 2.0 K for 1 and an antiferromagnetic ordering with a slight ﬁeld-induced spin-ﬂop transition for 2. In contrast, 3 with local lower-symmetric Kagom´e sublattice is a spin-frustrated antiferromagnet with a magnetic ordering at 16.0 K. Experimental Materials and instruments All of the starting materials employed were commercially pur- chased (Hatz and H2nip were from Acros and other analytical- grade reagents were from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Factory) and used as received without further puriﬁcation. Doubly deionized water was used for the conventional synthesis. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were carried out with a CE-440 (Leeman-Labs) analyzer. Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra (KBr pellets) were taken on an Avatar-370 (Nicolet) spectrometer in the range 4000– 400 cm-1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were carried out on Shimadzu simultaneous DTG-60A compositional analysis instrument from room temperature to 800 ◦C under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 ◦C min-1. Powder X- ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were obtained from a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA for Cu- Ka radiation (l = 1.5406 A˚ ), with a scan speed of 0.1 s/step and a step size of 0.01◦in 2q. The simulated PXRD patterns were calculated using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data and processed by the free Mercury v1.4 program provided by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center. Variable-temperature susceptibility measurements of the three complexes were carried out on a Quantum Design (SQUID) magnetometer MPMS-XL-7 with phase-pure crystalline samples. The data were corrected for temperature-independent paramagnetism, and the diamagnetic corrections were calculated using Pascal’s constants. An experi- mental correction for the sample holder was also applied. Preparations of complexes 1–3 {[Co4(H2O)2(l3-OH)2(atz)2(nip)2]·3H2O}n (1).

Semiempirical multi-scan absorption corrections were applied by SADABS, and the program SAINT was used for integration of the diffraction proﬁles.24 The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned with the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 programs.25 Anisotropic thermal parameters were assigned to all non-hydrogen atoms. All the hydrogen atoms of the ligands were found in the difference Fourier Map and reﬁned with isotropic temperature factors.

Results and discussion Syntheses and FT-IR spectra Solvothermal reaction of Hatz, H2nip with an inorganic CoII salt at 200 ◦C or with the MnII precursor at 190 ◦C generated complexes 1 and 2, respectively. By contrast, hydrothermal reaction at 130 ◦C afforded 3. Additionally, the molar ratios of the reactants for 1– 3 were also different from each other. It has been found that the much higher temperatures of 1 and 2 than 3 became one of the most important factors for the formation and growth of the two types of the complexes, although other controllable conditions such as pH, molar ratio of the reactants and reaction medium could also dominate the reactions to some different degree.

TGA and PXRD of 1–3 Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit similar thermal behavior, which is much different from that of 3 (Fig. S1, ESI†). Coordinated aqua and lattice solvent molecules in 1 and 2 were removed from room temperature to 134 ◦C (calcd 9.5%; obsd 9.3% for 1; calcd 9.3%; obsd 9.0% for 2). The coordination frameworks were then rapidly collapsed between 329 and 416 ◦C for 1 and between 329 and 372 ◦C for 2, corresponding to the decomposition of the mixed ligands (atz-, nip2-, and m3-OH). In contrast, the 3D framework of 3 could be thermally stable up to 270 ◦C with an obvious weight-loss stage between 99 and 147 ◦C for the release of two lattice water molecules. Once the temperature was higher than 270 ◦C, 3 was explosive due to the presence of the atz- ligand.27 PXRD experiments have been carried out for 1–3 to conﬁrm the phase purity of the bulk samples. The experimental and computer- simulated PXRD patterns (Fig. S2, ESI†) were in good agreement with each other, indicating the phase purity of the as-synthesized products. Crystal structures of 1–3 {[Co4(H2O)2(l3-OH)2(atz)2(nip)2]·3H2O}n (1). Single-crystal X-ray analysis shows that 1 is an inﬁnite 2D layer constructed from butterﬂy-shaped Co4(m3-OH)2 clusters and double nip2- and atz- linkers. As shown in Fig. 1a, the fundamental structural unit of 1 is a centrosymmetric dimer of two asymmetric units, consisting of four CoII ions, a pair of m3-OH groups, two terminally coordinated water molecules, two anionic atz- ligands and two full deprotonated nip2- anions. Co1 atom is in a distorted octahedron axially surrounded by one tetrazolyl N from one atz- ligand (N2) and one m3-OH group (O7A), and equatorially occupied by O3N donors (O2, O7, O8, and N3B) from the carboxylate of nip2- anion, m3-OH, coordinated water molecule and atz- ligand, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). The Co2 site, on the other hand, exhibits a severely distorted O3N2 trigonal bipyramid (t = 0.57), in which the two axial positions are occupied by a pair of symmetry-related tetrazolyl N donors (N1, N4D), and the basal plane is furnished by three O atoms (O7, O1, and O4C) from one m3-OH group and Fig. 1 (a) The CoII 4 cluster of 1 with atom-numbering scheme in the asymmetric unit (hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity. Symmetry codes: A = 1 - x, 2 - y, 2 - z). (b) The 2D covalent layer of 1 jointly extended by atz- and nip2- ligands. two carboxylate groups from two separate nip2- ligands (Fig. S3, ESI†). The bond lengths and angles around the CoII ions are in good agreement with those typical values (Table 2).28–33 Notably, two least-square planes that contain two adjacent asymmetric CoII ions associated with the equatorial atoms are tilted towards each other and form a dihedral angle of 34.888(63)◦, which is an important structural parameter for spin-canting of 1.19,29 A pair of asymmetric m3-OH groups aggregate four individual CoII atoms from two adjacent asymmetric units, generating a butterﬂy-shaped Co4(m3-OH)2 cluster with metal–metal dis- tances of 3.1509(6), 3.0920(6), and 3.5351(6) A˚ for Co1 ◊◊◊Co2, Co1 ◊◊◊Co1A, and Co1 ◊◊◊Co2A (Fig. 1a). The centrosymmetric CoII 4 cores are then inﬁnitely propagated in the crystallographic ab plane by m4-k1N1:k1N2:k1N3:k1N4-atz- and m3-k1O1:k1O2:k1O4- nip2- connectors to result in an inﬁnite Co4(m3-OH)2 cluster-based 2D covalent layer (Fig. 1b and Fig. S4, ESI†). Notably, the bridging carboxylate group of nip2- is in a syn, syn-conformation. The nearest inter-cluster CoII ◊◊◊CoII separation spanned by the atz- ligand is much nearer than that by the nip2- connector (4.1297(6) vs. 10.1804(9) A˚ ), so the superexchange interactions can signiﬁcantly occur within the CoII-atz- ribbon. The neighboring 2D covalent layers of 1 are H-bonded together by pairs of N–H ◊◊◊O hydrogen-bonding interactions between the exocyclic amino group of atz- and the carboxylate group of nip2- connector (Table S1 and Fig. S5, ESI†). {[Mn4(H2O)2(l3-OH)2(atz)2(nip)2]·H2O·MeOH}n (2). Com- plex 2 also exhibits a butterﬂy-shaped Mn4(m3-OH)2 cluster based- 2D layer. However, the unit cell parameters, the overall structural organization, the coordination mode of the nip2- ligand as well as the metal coordination sphere of 2 differ from those of 1 (Table 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. S6, ESI†). Rather than presenting bidentate-chelating and terminally unidentate modes, the two carboxylate groups of nip2- in 2 prefer to adopt bidentate-chelating and bidentate-bridging fashions, which make the MnII ions both This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Dalton Trans., 2011, 40, 10082–10089 | 10085 Published on 02 September 2011.

(c) The superexchange pathways of magnetically active 1D ribbon of 2. unique in the compressed octahedral N2O4 chromophores. As shown in Fig. 2a, the octahedral Mn1 atom is axially coordinated by one tetrazolyl N and one carboxylate O donor (N3B and O1A), and is equatorially surrounded by NO3 atoms (N2A, O8, O7, and O7A) from another atz- anion, one aqua ligand and two symmetry-related m3-OH groups, respectively. In contrast, the axial positions of the octahedral Mn2 atom are completed by two tetrazolyl N donors (N1 and N4B) from two different atz- ligands, and the equatorial sites of Mn2 are occupied by four O donors from one m3-OH (O7) and three carboxylate groups belonging to two nip2- anions (O2, O3C, and O4C). The bond lengths of Mn–O are considerably shorter than those of Mn–N (Table 3), and are comparable with those reported values.22,34 Two adjacent equatorial least-square planes that contain Mn1 and Mn2 atoms form a dihedral angle of 65.750(53)◦. Similar to 1, the centrosymmetric Mn4(m3-OH)2 cores in 2 are inﬁnitely extended in the crystallographic ab plane by m4- k1N1:k1N2:k1N3:k1N4 atz- and m4-k1O1:k1O2:k2O3,O4 nip2- con- nectors to generate a Mn4(m3-OH)2 core-based 2D layer (Fig. 2b). Obviously, more than seven superexchange pathways between the adjacent MnII ions (Fig. 2c) are generated through the m4-atz-, syn, syn-m2-COO- and m3-OH groups, which signiﬁcantly dominant the magnetic couplings of 2. Different from the interlayer hydrogen- bonding interactions in 1, neighboring 2D layers of 2 are stacked together by p ◊◊◊p interactions between the parallel phenyl rings of interlayer nip2- ligands with a centroid-to-centroid distance of 3.5569 A˚ (Fig. S7, ESI†). {[Cu2(H2O)(l3-OH)(atz)(nip)]·2H2O}n (3). Complex 3 is a robust 3D framework with unusual corner-sharing Cu3(m3-OH) D-chains crosslinked by nip2- linkages, in which the atz- ligand acts as a reinforcement to consolidate the Cu3(m3-OH) D-chain. The asymmetric unit of 3 contains two crystallographically independent CuII ions with different coordination polyhedrons, one m3-OH group, one atz- ligand, one fully deprotonated nip2- anion, one aqua ligand and two lattice water molecules. As shown in Fig. 3a, Cu1, assuming a distorted octahedron due to the Jahn– Teller effect, is chelated by four O donors belonging to one m3-OH group (O7) and two separate nip2- dianions (O1, O2 and O3A) at the equatorial positions, and its axial positions are occupied by two N atoms (N1 and N4B) from two symmetry-related atz- ligands. Instead, Cu2 is in the slightly deformed square-pyramid O3N2 coordination environments with t = 0.02. The basal plane of the Cu2 atom is well deﬁned by O2N2 donors (O7, O7C, N2 and N3D) from pairs of symmetry-related m3-OH groups and atz- ligands and the axial site is fulﬁlled by one terminally coordinated water molecule (O8). The axial Cu–O bond length is considerable longer than those in the basal plane (Table 4), although they are comparable with the previously reported values.35–37 The central m3-OH group aggregates one Cu1 and two symmetry-related Cu2 and Cu2A ions into a scalene Cu3(m3-OH) triangle (Fig. 3b). The bond angles of Cu2O7Cu1, Cu1O7Cu2A and Cu2O7Cu2A are 116.86(11), 115.07(11) and 113.52(10)◦, respectively, and the intermetallic separation by the m3-OH group is 3.5897(5), 3.5607(5) and 3.2110(6) A˚ for Cu1 ◊◊◊Cu2, Cu1 ◊◊◊Cu2A and Cu2 ◊◊◊Cu2A, respectively. Adjacent Cu3(m3- OH) triangles are then corner-shared via Cu2 to form an inﬁ- nite zigzag D-ribbon with m4-k1N1:k1N2:k1N3:k1N4-atz- ligand strengthening each edge of the triangles. Furthermore, each atz--consolidated D-strip is crosslinked by the m3-k2O1,O2:k1O3- nip2- connector to lead to a 3D coordination framework of 3 (Fig. 3c). 10086 | Dalton Trans., 2011, 40, 10082–10089 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Published on 02 September 2011.

Magnetic properties Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility was measured on the crystalline samples of 1–3. As shown in Fig. 4a, the cMT per CoII 4 cluster of 1 is 11.40 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K, which is much higher than the spin-only value (7.50 cm3 K mol-1) for four magnetically isolated CoII ions (S = 3/2, g = 2) resulting from the large residual orbital contribution. Upon cooling, the cMT product of 1 continuously decreases down to a round minimum of 5.99 cm3 K mol-1 at 12.0 K. It then sharply increases up to 17.48 cm3 K mol-1 at 2.0 K. Furthermore, the cMT value at low temperature is strongly ﬁeld-dependent (Fig. S8, ESI†), suggesting the spin- canted antiferromagnetism of 1. The magnetic susceptibility in the range 50–300 K obeys the Curie–Weiss law very well with C = 12.68 cm3 K mol-1 and q = -26.14 K, indicating the spin–orbit coupling and the overall antiferromagnetic interactions between the CoII ions through the syn, syn-m2-COO-, m3-OH and m4-atz- heterobridges. Notably, the N´eel temperature (T N) of 1 is lower than 2.0 K, evidenced by both the identical ZFC-FC plot (Fig. 4b) and the slight frequency-dependent ac susceptibility (Fig. S9, ESI†). The frequency dependent signals of 1 originate from a spin-glass behavior. In order to conﬁrm this, ac susceptibility measurement of 1 was performed under a 1000 Oe dc ﬁeld and an oscillating 3.5 Oe applied ﬁeld in the 1 –1000 Hz interval. As shown in Fig. 4c, both c¢ and c¢¢ components shift towards higher temperature as the frequency becomes higher, indicating the presence of slow-relaxation effect. The estimated frequency shift parameter U (U = DT p/[T pD(logf )])) was calculated to Fig. 4 (a) The temperature dependencies of cMT and cM -1 for 1 (solid line represents the best ﬁt to Curie–Weiss law).

The ﬁeld dependence of magnetization of 1 at 2 K shows that the magnetization increases rapidly with the increasing applied ﬁelds below 2 KOe and linearly at higher ﬁelds (Fig. S10, ESI†). The magnetization of 1 is 3.6 Nb at the highest ﬁeld measured (50 KOe), which is far from the saturation value expected for a CoII 4 system (9.6 Nb). These magnetic results jointly suggest that 1 is a spin- canted antiferromagnet with a spin glass behavior. Structurally, the strong anisotropy of CoII ion and the dihedral angle of the two adjacent metal chromophores may favorably promote the canted magnetic phase of 1.42 The cMT per MnII 4 unit of 2 is 17.13 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K (Fig. 5a), being close to the spin-only value (17.48 cm3 K mol-1) expected for four magnetically isolated high-spin MnII ions with S = 5/2 and g = 2.0. The cMT value of 2 continuously decreases with lowering temperature and reaches a minimum (0.24 cm3 K mol-1) at 2.0 K. A round peak at 44.0 K (T N) in the cM-T plot of 2 is characteristic for a phase transition to an antiferromagnetic ordering. The temperature dependence of cM -1 of 2 above 75 K obeys the Curie–Weiss law with C = 17.81 cm3 K mol-1 and q = -82.63 K, indicating dominant antiferromagnetic couplings between the MnII ions. However, it is a pity that no appropriate model can be quantitatively ﬁtted to the magnetic data at present due to the complicated superexchange pathways by mixed triple heterobridges (syn,syn-COO-, m3-OH, and m4-tetrazolyl) within the magnetic active MnII-atz- ribbon (Fig. 2c). Fig. 5 (a) The temperature dependencies of cMT, cM -1 and cM for 2 (solid line represents the best ﬁt to Curie–Weiss law). (b) The ﬁeld dependence of the magnetization at 2, 5 and 10 K for 2. Interestingly, the isothermal magnetization of 2 shows a linear dependence with the increasing ﬁeld at 5.0 and 10.0 K, and a slight sigmoid curvature at 2.0 K (Fig. 5b). The S-shaped magnetization of 2 can be attributed to a slight ﬁeld-induced spin-ﬂop transition, which can also be evidenced by the cM–T plots at several magnetic ﬁelds (Fig. S11, ESI†).43,44 The spin-ﬂop ﬁeld obtained from the M–H curve is ca. 30 KOe at 2.0 K. The distorted MnII coordination environments in 2 may be the reason for the spin-ﬂop transition.43–45 The cMT value for each CuII 2 unit of 3 (0.91 cm3 K mol-1, Fig. 6a) at 300 K is slightly higher than the expected value (0.75 cm3 K mol-1) for two uncoupled CuII ions with S = 1/2 and g = 2.0, suggesting that the g value of the spin carrier in 3 is greater than 2.0 and is consistent with the observed CuII- containing complexes. As the temperature decreases, the cMT continuously decreases and attains a value of 0.02 cm3 K mol-1 at 2.0 K. Fitting the data of 3 above 50 K with the Curie– Weiss law gives C = 0.92 cm3 K mol-1 and a negative q = -116.4 K, suggesting the strong antiferromagnetic couplings between Fig. 6 (a) The temperature dependence of cMT and cM -1 for 3 (solid line represents the best ﬁt to Curie–Weiss law). (b) The temperature dependence of cM for 3 (inset: the d(cMT)/dT vs. T derivative curve). the nearest-neighbor spin centers. The strong antiferromagnetic interactions can be geometrically related with the large Cu2–N2– N1, Cu1–N1–N2 (130.151(2)◦and 115.586(1)◦, Fig. 3a) and Cu– O7–Cu angles in 3. A round peak near 20.0 K in the cM vs T curve suggests an antiferromagnetic ordering with T N = 16 K determined from the sharp peak of d(cMT)/dT (Fig. 6b). The increase of cM below 8.0 K is due to the presence of a small amount of paramagnetic impurity and/or weak inter-ribbon ferromagnetic interactions. Complex 3 with the local atz--consolidated Cu3(m3- OH) D-ribbon motif is spin-frustrated with f = 7.3. The f value, which is deﬁned as f = |q|/T N, is used to measure the extent of spin-frustration.46 Compared with those strong spin-frustrated complexes (f > 10),47 the distorted vertex-sharing Cu3(m3-OH) triangles within the D-ribbon may geometrically contribute to the relatively weak frustration of 3. The magnetization of 3 increases linearly with the increasing ﬁeld at 2.0 K, and the value (0.08 Nb) at 50 KOe is far from the saturation value of two CuII ions (2.00 Nb, Fig. S10, ESI†). Apparently, interesting antiferromagnetic couplings with vari- able strengths were observed in the coordination polymers of 1–3 with the same mixed tetrazolate and dicarboxylate ligands and different spin carrier, which were signiﬁcantly due to different superexchange interactions transmitted by the mixed m4-atz-m3- OH-m2-COO- heterobridges within the MII-atz- ribbon of 1 and 2 as well as the double m4-atz-m3-OH heterobridges in the atz-- consolidated Cu3(m3-OH) D-ribbon of 3. More interestingly, the magnetic nature of the spin carrier (single-ion anisotropy and distorted coordination environments) and the arrangement of the spin carriers by the mediators can further modify the overall magnetic behaviors of the complexes, which essentially induced the spin canting of 1, the spin-ﬂop transition of 2 as well as the spin-frustration of 3. Conclusion The crystal structures and magnetic behaviors of CoII, MnII and CuII-based coordination polymers with mixed 5-amino- tetrazolate and 5-nitroisophthalate ligands have been described. The butterﬂy-shaped M4(m3-OH)2 clusters in the CoII and MnII complexes are inﬁnitely extended by double atz- and nip2- linkers to generate the tetranuclear cluster-based 2D covalent layers. In contrast, 3 is a 3D robust framework assembled from the atz--consolidated corner-sharing Cu3(m3-OH) D-strips and nip2- linkages. Resulting from the single-ion anisotropy, the distorted coordination environments of the spin carrier as well as the magnetic exchange interactions transmitted by the mixed multiple heterobridges, the complexes exhibit spin-canted 10088 | Dalton Trans., 2011, 40, 10082–10089 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Published on 02 September 2011.
