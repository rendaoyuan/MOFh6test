The Cu-MOFs containing Cu2 dinuclear units connected by glutarates and bipyridyl ligands are formulated as [{Cu2(Glu)2(μ-bpa)}·(CH3CN)]n (1) and [{Cu2(Glu)2(μ-bpp)}·(C3H6O)]n (2) (Glu = glutarate, bpa = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane, bpp = 1,3-bis- (4-pyridyl)propane). These two new bifunctional 3D Cu-MOFs possess very similar pore shape with different pore dimensions. Their gas sorption behaviors were investigated by using CO2, N2 and H2 at suitable temperatures. Both MOFs exhibited good CO2 selectivity over N2 and H2. MOF 1 having a smaller pore dimension exhibited much higher CO2 adsorption enthalpy than MOF 2 having a larger pore dimension. However, MOF 2 exhibited more enhanced CO2 uptake ability than MOF 1. A subtle variation of pore dimension indeed inﬂuenced the CO2 uptake ability somewhat signiﬁcantly especially at higher temperatures such as 273 K and 298 K. Heterogeneous catalytic activities of the MOFs were also investigated in detail. Only MOF 1 appeared to be an efﬁcient, mild, and easily recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the transesteriﬁcation of esters and constitutes a promising class of heterogeneous catalysts that allowed reuse without a signiﬁcant loss of activity through twenty runs with ester. 1. Introduction The metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are valuable materials for a wide range of sophisticated applications such as selective gas sorption,1 heterogeneous catalysis,2 separation,3 drug deliv- ery,4 and biological imaging.5 The selective sorption of CO2 over N2, H2, and CH4 is a very important property of MOFs for the potential industrial application of CO2 storage and separ- ation.1 There is also a growing interest in MOF-based catalytic systems because of their high recyclability and reactivity.2 To date, however, a relatively limited number of multifunctional MOFs are being reported compared with the total number of MOF-related publications each year. For instance, we recently reported an interesting bifunctional Zn-MOF, [Zn(3,3′-TPDC)- (DABCO)]DMF·2H2O, containing a C2h-symmetric terphenyl dicarboxylate linker, terphenyl-3,3′-dicarboxylate (3,3′-TPDC), and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (DABCO).6 The desolvated Zn-MOF exhibited high selectivity of CO2 sorption over N2 and H2 with a very high low-coverage CO2 adsorption enthalpy value due to the unusually exposed DABCO ligand. In addition, it also showed high catalytic activities for the nitroaldol (Henry) reaction and cyanosilylation of aromatic aldehyde.7 We present here two new bifunctional Cu-MOFs which show both CO2 selective sorption and efﬁcient heterogeneous catalytic activities. The Cu-MOFs containing Cu2 dinuclear units con- nected by glutarates and bipyridyl ligands are formulated as [{Cu2(Glu)2(μ-bpa)}·(CH3CN)]n (1) and [{Cu2(Glu)2(μ-bpp)}· (C3H6O)]n (2) (Glu = glutarate, bpa = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane, bpp = 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane). 2. Results and discussion 2.1 Structure description MOF 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group, and MOF 2 does in the orthorhombic Pccn space group. The single crystal X-ray study revealed that both MOFs contain Cu2 dinuclear units connected by glutarates to form two- dimensional (2D) sheets, and the sheets were also bridged either by bpa ligands to form an inﬁnite 3D framework 1 or by bpp ligands to form a 3D framework 2 as shown in Fig. 1, respectively.

The coordination geometry of each CuII ion is a square pyramid constructed by four equatorial carboxylate oxygen atoms and an axial pyridyl nitrogen atom. The Cu⋯Cu distances in Cu2 dinuclear units are 2.6525(10) Å for 1 and 2.6512(9) Å for 2. Both structures indicate a 6-connected uninodal net with a Schläﬂi symbol of 48·66·8 by TOPOS analysis.8 Acetonitrile solvates were captured in 1D channels of MOF 1 while acetone solvates were captured in 1D channels of MOF 2. The solvent-free MOFs 1 and 2 indicated 28.4% and 32.5% of void volumes, respectively, based on the PLATON analysis.9 Both MOFs contain well-deﬁned 1D channels without the solvate molecules (Fig. 2). They possess very similar pore shape with different pore dimensions and void volumes. These simi- larities and differences may be beneﬁcial for investigating their gas sorption abilities because other factors can be suppressed. The pore dimensions are estimated by the distances between two planes determined by H14B atoms and two planes by H21 atoms for 1 (5.37 Å × 4.09 Å), and two planes by H12A atoms and two planes by H25 atoms for 2 (6.67 Å × 5.27 Å) (Fig. 3). Thermogravimetric analysis results are in good agreement with the structures obtained by the X-ray study. MOF 1 completely loses acetonitrile solvates at 265 °C and MOF 2 loses its acetone solvates at 217 °C (Fig. 4). 2.2 Gas sorption Various gas sorption analyses for the MOFs were performed by using high-purity N2, H2, and CO2 (Fig. 5). The as-prepared MOFs were solvent exchanged with CHCl3 and then evacuated at 120 °C under high vacuum prior to gas sorption analysis. Neither MOF 1 nor MOF 2 sorbed N2 at 77 K, despite their sufﬁcient pore volumes. It is really surprising to see no signiﬁ- cant adsorption of N2 for MOFs 1 and 2. In order to provide more information about N2 sorption, we additionally measured Fig. 3 The dimensions of 1D channels of MOF 1 (a) and MOF 2 (b). Both structures are drawn along the c-axis.

We did not observe any signiﬁcant sorption of N2, either (data not shown here). Snurr et al. reported MOF systems which have higher N2 adsorption capacities at 298 K and 273 K than at 77 K. They attributed this phenomenon to the very small pore size but close to the kinetic diameter of N2.10 Therefore, in our case, the pore size may not be a critical issue for N2 sorption. We speculate that the low adsorptivity of N2 gas due to the low quadrupole moment and polarizability is the main reason for the very low adsorption.1b A standard volumetric H2 sorption analysis at 77 K also indicated that MOFs 1 and 2 did not efﬁciently sorb H2 at 77 K (Fig. 5a and 5b). The uptake amounts at 1 bar were merely 2.9 cm3 g−1 for N2 and 3.0 cm3 g−1 for H2 for MOF 2. In contrast, MOF 2 sorbed CO2 very effectively. MOF 2 sorbed 100.0 cm3 g−1 (4.46 mmol g−1), 55.7 cm3 g−1 (2.48 mmol g−1), and 29.1 cm3 g−1 (1.30 mmol g−1) of CO2 at 196 K, 273 K and 298 K, respectively. The uptake amount at 273 K is quite high compared with the amount at 196 K, ca. 56%. Therefore, MOF 2 is a good CO2 sorbent under moderate conditions. MOF 1 also sorbed 70.0 cm3 g−1 (3.12 mmol g−1), 26.4 cm3 g−1 (1.18 mmol g−1), and 12.7 cm3 g−1 (0.57 mmol g−1) of CO2 at 196 K, 273 K and 298 K, respect- ively. MOF 1 thus revealed lower uptake amounts relative to MOF 2. This may be attributable to the smaller pore dimension and void of 1 compared with 2. The CO2 sorption values of both MOFs 1 and 2 are even better than those of the previously reported 3D coordination polymer containing Cu2(Glu)4 sheets connected by Schiff base linker azpy, where azpy is N,N’- bis(pyridin-4-ylmethylene)hydrazine.11 In order to investigate differences in CO2 adsorption for MOFs 1 and 2, the isosteric heats of CO2 adsorption (Qst) for the MOFs were evaluated by the subroutine implemented in the BEL Master software of the Belsorp-miniII equipment according to the literature.6 The subroutine uses the Clausius–Clapeyron equation to estimate the adsorption enthalpies from the adsorp- tion data obtained at 196 K and 273 K. Interestingly, MOFs 1 and 2 exhibited quite different low surface coverage Qst values of 30.7 kJ mol−1 and 12.6 kJ mol−1, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 6. The highly enhanced low surface coverage Qst value of MOF 1 can be attributable to the relatively smaller pore dimen- sion of MOF 1.6 Nevertheless, both Qst values are in the usual range of Qst values commonly observed for MOFs.12 The Qst values for MOF 1 at the low surface coverage region rapidly decrease and become a plateau. On the other hand, the Qst values for MOF 2 gradually increase upon the increase of CO2 uptake and become a plateau. This result indicates that the pre- adsorbed CO2 molecules in the channels of MOF 2 interact strongly with other incoming CO2 molecules. We speculate that the different behaviours of Qst values upon change of CO2 Fig. 4 TGA results for MOF 1 (a) and MOF 2 (b). Fig. 5 Gas sorption results.

View Article Online uptake can also be the result of different pore dimensions between MOF 1 and MOF 2. The frameworks of MOF 1 and 2 are very robust as evidenced by PXRD patterns (Fig. 7 and 8). The PXRD patterns of both as-prepared MOFs 1 and 2 did not signiﬁcantly change during the activation process at 120 °C for gas sorption analysis. Very similar patterns to the original patterns were observed after the gas sorption measurements. Based on these results, the selective sorption of quadrupolar CO2 over N2 and H2 by MOFs 1 and 2 may be accounted for by different gas adsorptivities toward MOFs instead of pore size effect. 2.3 Catalytic activity Since copper has recently gained prominence as a catalyst for numerous transformations13 and MOFs 1 and 2 are insoluble in water and common organic solvents such as DMF, DMSO, CH2Cl2, and EtOH, the reactivity of 1 and 2 as a heterogeneous catalyst was examined in the transesteriﬁcation reaction of a wide range of esters with methanol.14 MOF 1 (5 mg), which was ground well into appropriate sizes for high surface area but not too small for convenient ﬁltration, was found to effectively cata- lyze the transesteriﬁcation reaction of phenyl acetate (50 mM) with methanol (100% conversion in 2 d) at 50 °C under the neutral conditions as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 9. There is no induction period. Little transesteriﬁcation (less than 3%) occurs without catalyst 1 in the same time period. In contrast, MOF 2 was less reactive to phenyl acetate with a slow conversion (20 d) under the same conditions. As MOF 1 displayed adequate activity, with our previous experience,15 attention was next turned to examining their recov- ery and reuse. After the reaction completed, the catalyst was recovered by ﬁltration and thoroughly washed with methanol for the consecutive runs. The recovered catalyst was used for a new reaction batch of phenyl acetate. Catalyst 1 showed excellent re- usability for 20 times without showing any signiﬁcant deterio- ration of catalytic activity (Table S1, ESI†). Actually all the reactions in Table S1† were performed with the same recycled catalyst. With the usefulness of the recyclability of MOF 1, we have, then, performed another control reaction before further reactivity Fig. 8 PXRD patterns of MOF 2 under various conditions.

View Article Online studies with other substrates, because in the process of catalysis the leached metal species might catalyze the transesteriﬁcation reaction instead of the heterogeneous catalysts.14 To verify whether the catalysis of 1 is truly heterogeneous or is due to some leached copper species present in the liquid phase, the reaction mixture was allowed to settle down and the supernatant was decanted. Then, the amount of copper in the supernatant was measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectro- scopic analysis and determined to be <2 ppm. This result strongly suggests that the dominant reactive species is the heterogeneous catalyst 1, not the other species such as the leached metal. Currently, we speculate that the active catalytic centres are mainly located at the MOF surfaces. The PXRD pattern of the ﬁltered catalyst after the reaction revealed a similar pattern of the original catalyst, suggesting that the original struc- ture of the ﬁltered catalyst remains stable (Fig. 10). As shown in Table 1, this novel catalyst 1 was also active towards various esters under the reaction conditions and the con- version rates are very sensitive to the properties of the electronic groups on the phenyl moiety of the substrate (entries 1–3 and 4–7); the substrates with the electron-withdrawing substituents have undergone faster transesteriﬁcation, while those with the electron-donating ones have shown slow reaction. Importantly, vinyl acetate, which is widely used as a precursor for ester syn- thesis,16 was also converted efﬁciently to the product methyl acetate within 0.3 d by the catalyst (entry 8). Detailed mechanis- tic studies are currently under investigation. The reactivity of MOFs 1 and 2 was also examined for the oleﬁn epoxidation reaction of cyclohexene as a substrate with H2O2 as an oxidant. Unfortunately, they did not catalyze the oleﬁn epoxidation reaction. 3. Conclusions Two new bifunctional 3D Cu-MOFs were prepared and their gas sorption characteristics and catalytic activities were investigated in detail. Both MOFs exhibited good CO2 selectivity over N2 and H2. MOF 1 exhibited much enhanced heat of CO2 adsorp- tion in the low surface coverage region due to the smaller pore dimension than MOF 2. However, MOF 2 revealed higher CO2 uptake capacity than MOF 1. A subtle variation of pore dimen- sion indeed inﬂuenced the CO2 uptake ability somewhat signiﬁ- cantly especially at higher temperatures such as 273 K and 298 K. Furthermore, MOF 1 appeared to be an efﬁcient, mild, and easily recyclable catalyst for the transesteriﬁcation of esters and constitutes a promising class of heterogeneous catalysts that allowed reuse without a signiﬁcant loss of activity through twenty runs with ester. We envision that multifunctional MOFs will be an important class of crystalline porous materials. 4.

All hydrogen atoms were placed in the calculated positions. The crystallographic data for two compounds are listed in Table 2 and the selected bond distances are listed in Table 3.

View Article Online Physical measurements The cryogenic volumetric N2 adsorption/desorption analysis was performed on a Belsorp-miniII at 77 K (BEL Japan). The as-pre- pared MOFs were soaked in CHCl3 for solvent exchange for at least 3 d. The CHCl3-exchanged MOF samples were dried at 393 K under high vacuum for 2 h. Low pressure CO2 adsorption measurements were performed on a Belsorp-miniII at 196 K (2- propanol–dry ice bath), 273 K (ice bath), and 298 K (water bath). Low-pressure hydrogen adsorption measurements were performed at 77 K on a Belsorp-miniII. The equipment was cali- brated by using Cu-BTC (HKUST-1) as a reference material. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained by using a Rigaku MiniFlex (30 kV, 15 mA). Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out on a TGA Q5000 (TA Instruments) under a nitro- gen atmosphere. Elemental analysis was performed by using an EA1112 (CE Instruments, Italy). Heterogeneous catalytic activities of MOFs 1 and 2 Catalytic reaction conditions: Esters (0.05 mmol) were dissolved in methanol (1 mL), and the MOFs (5 mg, 8.2 × 10−3 mmol for 1 and 5 mg, 7.1 × 10−3 mmol for 2), which were ground well into appropriate sizes for high surface area but not too small for convenient ﬁltration, were added and shaken at 50 °C (450 rpm). Reaction conversion was monitored by GC/mass analysis of 20 μL aliquots withdrawn periodically from the reaction mixture. All reactions were run at least three times and the average conversion yields are presented. Conversion yield was based on the consumption of the starting ester. For recyclability, after the ﬁrst reaction completed, the catalyst was recovered by ﬁltration and thoroughly washed with methanol for the consecutive run. The recovered catalyst was used for a new reaction batch of ester.
