Complex 1 possesses a two-dimensional (2D) (4,4) network structure. CoII ions are connected by the 1,3-BDC anions to form one-dimensional (1D) linear chains, which are extended into 2D layers by the bbbm ligands. 2 shows a three-dimensional (3D) (3,4,5)-connected framework with a (6.82)2(69.8)2(86) topology. In complex 2, Co-SIP ladder-like chains are linked by the bbbm ligands to generate a 3D framework. 3 exhibits a 3D (3,3,4,4,4)-connected framework with a novel (3.6.73.8)(3.6.7)(3.62.73)(6.72)(6.74.10) topology. CdII ions are connected by SIP anions to form 2D layers containing 12-membered macrocycle, which are further connected by the bbbm linkers to form a 3D framework. 4 displays a 3D 8-connected framework with a (424.64) topology. In complex 4, binuclear cadmium clusters are extended into 3D structure by the bbbm ligands and NIP anions. The substituent group of polycarboxylates plays an important role in the assembly and structures of title complexes. The electrochemical properties of 1 and 2, photoluminescent properties of 3 and 4 have been reported. Introduction The rational design and synthesis of novel metal–organic coordination polymers (MOCPs) is currently attracting con- siderable attention because of their fascinating topological structures and potential applications as functional materials in porosity, catalysis, luminescence, conductivity, magnetism, and so on.1 In recent years, the self-assembly of MOCPs based on the nitrogen-donor and polycarboxylates mixed ligands is an effective strategy widely adopted in this field.2 In contrast to the rigid ligands, the flexible nitrogen-donor ligands show varied conformations when they coordinate with the metal ions. As is known, the flexible bis(azoles) derivatives are one kind of important nitrogen-donor linkers for constructing MOCPs. Some flexible bis(imidazole),3 bis(triazolyl)4 and bis(tetrazole)5 derivatives have been widely used in the synthesis of coordina- tion polymers. For example, Ma and co-workers reported a series of new coordination polymers based on flexible bis(imi- dazole) and bis(benzimidazole) ligands.6 Hou and Lang’s groups also investigated the coordination polymers based on flexible bis(benzimidazole) ligands, respectively.7 In addition, aromatic polycarboxylates as multidentate ligands are often used as building blocks for the synthesis of MOCPs due to their various coordination modes and strong coordination ability to the metal ions.8 However, to our knowledge, the exploration of MOCPs based on flexible bis(benzimidazole) and auxiliary polycarbox- ylates mixed-ligands is still limited.9 Especially, the systematic studies on the effect of substitute groups of aromatic poly- carboxylates on the structures of MOCPs are rarely reported in the literature.10 Here, to investigate the role of substituent group of poly- carboxylates in the MOCPs based bis(benzimidazole) derivative, we select the flexible 1,1-(1,4-butanediyl)bis-1H-benzimidazole (bbbm) (Scheme 1) as a nitrogen-donor linker and three types of benzenedicarboxylates, namely, 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid (1,3-H2BDC), 5-sulfoisophthalic acid (H3SIP) and 5-nitroi- sophthalic acid (H2NIP) (Scheme 1) as auxiliary ligands to construct the target compounds. Additionally, considering the metal ions’ effect on the structures of MOCPs,11 here CoII and CdII ions were selected as central metal ions. In this paper, we report the syntheses and structures of four new MOCPs, namely, [Co(bbbm)(1,3-BDC)]?H2O (1), [Co3(bbbm)4(SIP)2(H2O)2]?2H2O (2), [Cd3(bbbm)3(SIP)2(H2O)4]?2H2O (3) and [Cd(bbbm)(NIP)] (4). The electrochemical properties of 1 and 2, photoluminescent properties of 3 and 4 have been investigated.

Results and discussion Description of crystal structures [Co(bbbm)(1,3-BDC)]?H2O (1). Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/m. The asymmetric unit consists of one CoII ion, one bbbm ligand, one 1,3-BDC anion and one interstitial H2O molecule. CoII ion and two 1,3-BDC anions lie on the mirror, while the interstitial H2O (disordered into two positions) and bbbm ligands lie on the two sides of the mirror. As shown in Fig. 1, the CoII ion is four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two bbbm ligands and two oxygen atoms from two 1,3-BDC anions in a distorted tetrahedron geometry. The Co1–N1 and Co1– N1#2 bond distances are 2.0221(16) A˚ , and the Co–O bond distances are 1.9433(19) (Co1–O1) and 1.931(2) (Co1–O3#1) A˚ , which are comparable to those of the similar cobalt complexes.15 In 1, the 1,3-BDC anion only adopts one type of bis- monodentate coordination mode (Scheme S1{), which has been observed in the reported 1,3-BDC metal complexes.10b-d,16 Each CoII ion is bridged by the 1,3-BDC anions to form a 1D linear chain (Fig. 2a upper). The adjacent chains are linked by the bbbm ligands to generate a 2D (4,4) network along the bc plane (Fig. 2a middle and bottom). The wave-like 2D networks are further packed into a 3D supramolecular architecture through the p–p stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of the bbbm ligands from the adjacent 2D networks, with a center-to- center distance of 3.474 A˚ (Fig. 2b).

The asymmetric unit contains three CoII ions, four bbbm ligands, two SIP anions, two coordinated H2O molecules and two interstitial H2O molecules. As shown in Fig. 3, there are two crystallographically independent CoII ions in 2. The Co1 atom lies on a twofold axis, and two bbbm ligands lie about inversion centres, with the third in a general position. Co1 is four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two bbbm ligands and two oxygen atoms from two SIP anions in a distorted tetrahedron geometry. The Co1–N7 and Co1–N7#1 bond distances are 2.008(2) A˚ , and the Co1–O4 and Co1–O4#1 bond distances are 1.9865(18) A˚ , which are similar to those of 1.

In 2, each SIP anion bridges three CoII ions (one Co1 and two Co2) to form a 1D ladder-like chain along the b axis, in which the Co1 ions lie on the crossbeam, and the Co2 ions lie on the column (Fig. 4a).

According to the above structural descriptions, the bbbm ligands uniformly behave as the bidentate linkers to connect the metal centers in 1–4. Initially, we chose 1,3-BDC as an ancillary ligand and CoII as center metal ion, thus a wave-like 2D (4,4) network was obtained. In order to investigate what would happen if the H atom in meta-position of 1,3-BDC is replaced by the SO3 2 group, SIP was employed in complex 2 as auxiliary ligand, and a 3D (3,4,5)-connected framework with a (6.82)2(69.8)2(86) topology was constructed, which indicates that the substitute group of benzenedicarbox- ylates shows a great effect on the structures of CoII complexes. If CoII ion is replaced by other metal ions, will the structure of the target compounds be influenced by the substitute group of benzenedicarboxylates? In order to answer this question, CdII was used as the central metal ion and SIP was still used as auxiliary ligand in complex 3. As a result, a (3,3,4,4,4)-connected 3D framework with a novel (3.6.73.8)(3.6.7)(3.62.73)(6.72)(6.74.10) topology was obtained. In order to further confirm that the benzenedicarboxylates with different substitute groups have obvious influence on the structure of CdII complexes, the NIP with NO2 substitute group was used in complex 4. Thus, an 8-connected 3D framework was constructed, which is similar to the Co(bbbm)(NIP) and Cu(bbbm)(NIP) complexes reported by our group.9a The above results suggest that the substitute groups of polycarboxylates play important roles in the assembly and structures of transition metal complexes (Scheme 2). Electrochemical properties Redox properties of 1 and 2 were investigated in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. The electrochemical behaviors of the 1- and 2- CPE (Figure S1{) are similar except for some slight potential shifts. Thus, 1-CPE is described here as the representative example. Fig. 11(a) shows the cyclic voltammograms of the 1- CPE at different scan rates. In the potential range of +800 to 45 mV, a pair of reversible redox peaks attributed to the redox of CoIII/CoII are observed at the cyclic voltammogram of the 1- CPE, and the mean peak potential E1/2 = (Epa + Epc)/2 is +382 mV (100 mV s21).22 When the scan rates are varied from 20 to 400 mV s21, the peak potentials gradually change: the cathodic peak potentials shift toward the negative direction and the corresponding anodic peak potentials shift toward the positive direction. In addition, the anodic and cathodic peak currents are proportional to the scan rates, as shown in Fig. 11(b), which indicates the redox process of 1-CPE is surface-controlled. Photoluminescent properties Previous studies have shown that the metal–organic coordination polymers, especially zinc and cadmium carboxylate compounds, Fig. 10 (a) 8-connected node composed of one binuclear cluster (red) and eight adjacent binuclear clusters (blue) in 4.

The free bbbm ligand displays emission maximum at 445 nm upon excitation at 320 nm (Fig. 12, inset). Both 3 and 4 show strong emission bands, which are at 396 nm (lex = 250 nm) for 3 (Fig. 12) and 466 nm (lex = 275 nm) for 4 (Figure S2{), respectively. Compared with the free bbbm ligand, the emission maximum of 3 is blue-shifted, which may be attributed to the intraligand charge transfer transitions.24 Whilst the emission peak of 4 is red-shifted, which may be assigned as the metal-to-ligand charge transfer.7d,25 Thermal analysis In order to investigate the thermal stability of 1–4, the thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of 1–4 were measured under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 uC min21 in the temperature range from room temperature to 800 uC (Figure S4– S7{). It was found that 1–3 have two separate weight loss steps, while the TG curve of 4 exhibits only one weight loss stage. The first weight loss stages start at 80 uC up to 190 uC for 1, 60 uC up to 125 uC for 2, 80 uC up to 185 uC for 3, giving the weight loss of about 3.8% for 1, 4.5% for 2, 5.7% for 3, corresponding to the loss of the interstitial water molecules or/and coordinated water molecules (calcd. 3.4% for 1, 3.8% for 2, 6.0% for 3). The second weight loss occurring from 370 uC to 740 uC for 1, from 276 uC to 580 uC for 2, from 330 uC to 650 uC for 3 may be attributed to the decomposition of bbbm and aromatic polycarboxylate ligands. The weight losses are about 82.0% for 1, 83.5% for 2, 72.0% for 3 (calcd. 82.5% for 1, 84.4% for 2, 72.6% for 3. The residue weights (14.2% for 1, 12.0% for 2, 22.3% for 3) are in correspondence with the calculated value (14.1% for 1, 11.8% for 2, 21.4% for 3) of MO (M = Co or Cd). For 4, the weight loss of 78.3% (calcd. 79.0%) from 344 to 650 uC is attributed to the decomposition of bbbm and NIP ligands. In this case, the residue was assumed to be CdO. The percent of the residue is about 21.7%, which is in accordance with the expected value (21.0%). Conclusion In summary, four new transition metal coordination polymers constructed from the flexible bbbm ligand and three types of benzenedicarboxylate anions with different substituent groups have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The results indicate that the benzenedicarboxylates with different substitute groups play important roles in the construction of title compounds 1–4. In addition, for complexes 2 and 3, the central metal ions also show great effect on the structures. The CoII complexes 1 and 2 exhibit good electrochemical properties, and the CdII complexes 3 and 4 possess good photoluminescent properties, demonstrating their potential applications in the electrochemical and fluorescent field.
