Champness,*a Peter Hubbersteya and Martin Schro¨ der*a Received 27th February 2011, Accepted 13th May 2011 DOI: 10.1039/c1cc11168j The metal–organic frameworks NOTT-400 and NOTT-401, based on a binuclear [Sc2(l2-OH)(O2CR)4] building block, have been synthesised and characterised; the desolvated framework NOTT-401a shows a BET surface area of 1514 m2 g1 with a total H2 uptake of 4.44 wt% at 77 K and 20 bar. Among alternative energy sources, hydrogen (H2) holds an important position because of its high energy density and reduced greenhouse gas emissions at point of use.1 The develop- ment of materials that can eﬃciently and eﬀectively store H2 remains a major challenge for use in mobile applications, and porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) represent one of the most promising candidate materials. They are currently of great interest due to their tuneable functionality, uniform pore size, and potential high porosity and apparent internal surface areas.2,3 MOFs constructed from binuclear [M2(m2-OH)(O2CR)4] nodes have been synthesised for a range of trivalent M(III) metal centres such as Cr(III),4 V(III),5 Al(III),6 Fe(III),7,8 In(III),9 Ga(III)10 and Sc(III).11,12 Despite the fact that some of these activated frameworks exhibit permanent porosity, none have been investigated as potential H2 storage media. There has been an increasing interest in the use of Sc(III) centres to construct porous MOFs because the Sc(III) ion has a lower density than commonly-used late divalent transition metal ions such as Zn(II) or Cu(II), and can also favour high co-ordination numbers to increase the framework stability.13 Relatively few examples of Sc(III)-based MOFs have been reported in the literature.11,12,14–18 For example, Perles et al. synthesised the ﬁrst m2-OH-bridged Sc(III)-based MOF {[Sc2(OH)(O2C2H4CO2)2.5]}N, the desolvated framework of which shows Lewis acid catalytic activity and exceptional thermal stability up to 500 1C.11,16 Perles et al. also synthesised the Sc(III) arene-disulfonate materials, {[Sc2(1,5-nds)(OH)4]}N, (1,5-nds2 = 1,5-naphthalene disulfo- nate) and {[Sc2(2,6-nds)(OH)4]}N, (2,6-nds2 = 2,6-naphthalene disulfonate).12 These materials are thermally stable up to 400 and 515 1C, respectively, and both show activity as hetero- geneous catalysts.12 Recently, Wright et al. have reported the synthesis of MIL-53(Sc) which shows interesting CO2 adsorption behavior.18 We have been interested in developing MOFs derived from Sc(III)19 and targeted the [Sc2(m2-OH)] fragment as a potential building block. We report herein the syntheses of two new materials, NOTT-400 and NOTT-401, based on binuclear [Sc2(m2-OH)(O2CR)4] building blocks, together with their thermal stability and gas adsorption properties, which conﬁrm the high H2 storage capacities for Sc(III) systems.

NOTT-400 crystallises in the chiral tetragonal space group I4122 [Flack parameter 0.48(5)] and shows a binuclear [Sc2(m2-OH)(O2CR)4] node (Fig. 1a).y Each Sc(III) centre is octahedrally co-ordinated to six O-donors, four from four diﬀerent carboxylate groups of [BPTC]4 ligands [Sc–O = 2.1102(15), 2.1182(15) A˚ ] and two from two m2-OH groups that bridge two Sc(III) centres [Sc–O = 2.0479(12) A˚ ]. The vertex-shared [Sc2(OH)(O2CR4)4] groups form [Sc2O11] dioctahedra [Sc  Sc 3.6468(5) A˚ ] which are further linked to each other through tetracarboxylate anions.

This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Chem. Commun., 2011, 47, 8304–8306 8305 exhibits an overall 3D framework structure incorporating a channel of approximate size 8.1 A˚ (Fig. 2a) taking into account the van der Waals radii of surface atoms. NOTT-401 crystallises in the tetragonal space group I41/amd, and also comprises binuclear [Sc2(m2-OH)(O2CR)4] nodes (Fig. 1b). The Sc(III) centre adopts a similar octahedral environment to NOTT-400, with four O-donors from four diﬀerent thiophene carboxylate ligands and two m-OH groups deﬁning the co-ordination sphere [Sc–O = 2.0416(11)–2.126(2) A˚ ]. The Sc  Sc distance here is somewhat shorter at 3.6057(6) A˚ . Overall, NOTT-401 also exhibits a 3D framework structure incorporating a channel of slightly smaller size, 6.3 A˚ (Fig. 2b) than in NOTT-400, taking into account the van der Waals radii. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) show continuous weight loss of B17 wt% for both NOTT-400 and NOTT- 401 over the temperature ranges 25–250 1C and 25–150 1C, respectively. NOTT-400 begins to decompose near 520 1C, conﬁrming the exceptional thermal stability of this material, while TGA of NOTT-401 shows a plateau above 150 1C, with the material decomposing at 380 1C. In situ variable-temperature powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) of NOTT-400 and NOTT-401 under vacuum conﬁrms the retention of the overall framework crystallinity up to 500 and 350 1C, respectively, consistent with the TGA results. The purity of the bulk materials was also conﬁrmed by PXRD. The uncoordinated water molecules in the pores of the as-synthesised NOTT-400 and NOTT-401 can be exchanged for acetone and this promotes accessibility to the desolvated frameworks after activation by heating. Thus, samples of NOTT-400 and NOTT-401 were placed in acetone for 4 days followed by degassing at 170 1C and 1010 bar for 12 h to aﬀord the fully desolvated materials NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a. N2 adsorption isotherms for both desolvated NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a at 77 K show Type-I isotherms conﬁrming retention of microporosity upon removal of guest solvent. Dubinin–Astakhov (DA) analysis of the N2 isotherm data for NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a conﬁrm a distribution of pore diameters of 7.5 A˚ and 6.2 A˚ , respectively, consistent with the values determined from the single crystal X-ray structures (8.1 A˚ and 6.3 A˚ ). The BET surface areas and total pore volumes for NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a from N2 isotherm data were found to be 1350 m2 g1/0.56 cm3 g1 and 1514 m2 g1/0.66 cm3 g1, respectively, comparable to the highest values reported for Sc(III)-based MOFs (1511 m2 g1/0.62 cm3 g1 for {[Sc3O(TPB)2(H2O)3](OH)}N [H3TPB = 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxy- phenyl)benzene].19 Gravimetric H2 adsorption data for NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a were recorded from 0–20 bar at 77 K and 87 K (Fig. 3). All H2 isotherms show rapid kinetics (ca. 3 min to equilibrium) and good reversibility without hysteresis. The total H2 uptakes at 77 K for NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a at 1.0 bar are 2.14 and 2.31 wt%, respectively, rising to 3.84 and 4.44 wt%, respectively at 20 bar. The enthalpies for H2 adsorption were determined by ﬁtting both isotherms at 77 K and 87 K to a virial-type equation,20 and the isosteric heats of adsorption of H2 in NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a were estimated to be 5.96 and 6.65 kJ mol1, respectively, at zero surface coverage. These values decrease with increasing H2 coverage and are consistent with the typical values of H2 adsorption for MOF materials (5–7 kJ mol1).21 NOTT-401a shows a slightly higher adsorption enthalpy than NOTT-400a, consistent with the smaller pore size in NOTT-401a, which provides stronger overlapping potentials for H2 molecules. The pore volumes for NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a (0.56 and 0.66 cm3 g1, respectively) are higher than those reported for {[Sc2(BDC)3]}N (0.23 and 0.33 cm3 g1),14,15 {[Sc3O(BDC)3- (H2O)3].Cl0.5OH0.5(DMF)4(H2O)3}N (H2BDC = benzene- 1,4-dicarboxylic acid) (0.25 cm3 g1),19 and {(Sc3O(H2O)3- (NO3)(ABTC)1.5}N (H3ABTC = 3,30,5,50-azobenzenetetra- carboxylic acid) (0.57 cm3 g1),18 although smaller than observed in {(Sc3O(H2O)2(OH)(BTC)2}N (H3BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetri- carboxylic acid) (0.72 cm3 g1)18 and {[Sc3O(TPB)2(H2O)3]OH}N (H3TPB = 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene) (0.76 cm3 g1).19 Fig. 1 Views of the co-ordination environment of binuclear Sc(III) centres with (a) [BPTC]4 and (b) [TDA]2 (scandium: green; sulfur: yellow; oxygen: red; carbon: grey; hydrogen: small grey).

Commun., 2011, 47, 8304–8306 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 The BET surface areas of NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a (1350 and 1514 m2 g1, respectively) are approximately double that of {[Sc2(BDC)3]}N (721 m2 g1)15 and {[Sc3O(BDC)3(H2O)3]Cl0.5OH0.5(DMF)4(H2O)3}N, (634 m2 g1).19 Importantly, the previously highest H2 uptake for a Sc(III)-based MOF (1.4 wt% at 0.66 bar and 77 K)15 is exceeded by both NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a (1.8 and 1.9 wt%, respectively) under the same conditions. In summary, we have synthesised two Sc(III)-based MOFs (NOTT-400 and NOTT-401) based on the [Sc2(m2-OH)(O2CR)4] building block. This work represents the ﬁrst example of the use of a m2-OH bridged binuclear {Sc2} building block to construct framework materials which exhibit permanent porosity and high H2 adsorption properties. Both materials show high thermal stability and, interestingly, the framework NOTT-400 retains crystallinity up to 500 1C. Desolvated NOTT-401a shows a high BET surface area for a Sc(III) co-ordination polymer and as a consequence achieves the highest H2 uptake for a Sc(III)-based MOF material.

Elemental microanalyses for C, H and N were carried out on a CE-440 elemental analyser at the University of Nottingham. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected under both ambient and in-situ conditions on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA (Cu Kα1, λ= 1.5406 Å), with a heating rate of 2 °C/min and step size of 0.04 °/2θ. An MRI TCP-20 with PtRh strip heater was used for the in-situ variable temperature PXRD experiments. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under N2 at a scan rate of 2 °C/min using a TA Universal Analysis 2000 system. 1.2 Synthesis of {[Sc2(BPTC)(OH)2]·(H2O)1.25}∞ NOTT-400 Scandium triflate (0.030g, 0.061 mmol) and H4BPTC (0.010 g, 0.030 mmol) were mixed in THF (4.0 ml), DMF (3.0 ml), water (1.0 ml) and HCl (36.5 %, 2 drops). The resultant slurry mixture was stirred until complete dissolution occurred. The solution was then placed in a pressure tube and heated in an oil bath to 75 oC for 72 h. The tube was cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 0.1 oC/min, and the colourless crystalline product was separated by filtration, washed with DMF (5.00 ml) and dried in air.

Structures were solved by direct methods and developed by difference Fourier techniques using the SHELXTL software package.1 The hydrogen atoms on the ligand were placed geometrically and refined using a riding model. The unit cell volumes include a large region of disordered solvent which could not be modelled as discrete atomic sites. We employed PLATON/SQUEEZE2 to calculate the contribution to the diffraction from the solvent region and thereby produced a set of solvent-free diffraction intensities. The final formulae were calculated from the SQUEEZE2 results combined with elemental analytical data.

N2 and H2 isotherms were recorded on an IGA system (Hidden Isochema, Warrington, UK) at the University of Nottingham under ultra high vacuum in a clean system with a diaphragm and turbo pumping system. Ultra-pure grade (99.9995 %) H2 was purchased from BOC and purified further using calcium aluminosilicate and activated carbon adsorbents to remove trace amounts of water and other impurities before introducing into the IGA system. The density of H2 at 77 K in the buoyancy correction was calculated by the Redlich-Kwong-Soave equation of state of H2 incorporated in the IGASWIN software of the IGA system. The surface area was calculated using the BET method based on adsorption data in the partial pressure (P/Po) range 0.06 to 0.22. The pore size distribution (PSD) was determined by applying the Dubinin-Astakhov analysis to the N2 adsorption data analysis to the isotherm data. 2.

Gravimetric H2 adsorption was measured from 0-20 bar at 77K and 87K for desolvated NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a. All data were strictly corrected for the buoyancy of system, samples and absorbates. All the H2 sorption isotherms show good reversibility and absence of hysteresis (Figures 7S). The H2 adsorption kinetic data confirm that equilibrium is achieved within ca. 3 mins of the isotherm pressure step. These suggest a typical H2 adsorption and exclude any significant effect due to the presence of impurities. a b Figure 7S: H2 isotherms for (a) desolvated NOTT-400a and (b) desolvated NOTT-401at 77 and 87 K. The isosteric heats of H2 adsorption were determined by fitting a virial-type equation to both 77 and 87 K adsorption isotherms. The ln(n/p) values for a given amount adsorbed (n) were calculated from the linear regressions from the virial equation analysis using the following virial equation:3, 4 ln(n/p) = A0 + A1n + A2n2… (1) where p is pressure, n is amount adsorbed and A0, A1 etc. are virial coefficients. A0 is related to adsorbate- adsorbent interactions, while A1 describes adsorbate-adsorbate interactions.4 Henry’s Law constant (KH) is equal to exp(A0), and at low surface coverage, A2 and higher terms can be ignored. A plot of ln(n/p) versus n should give a straight line at low surface coverage. Simulation of H2 adsorption data at 77 and 87 K for NOTT-400a and NOTT-401a between 50 and 400 mbar using equation (1) are presented in Figures 8S and 9S, respectively. All the regression coefficients Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 8 were larger than 0.998, showing that the model fits the data very well. The virial method based on equation (1) is preferred at low pressure because the linearity in the low pressure part of the isotherm provides direct confirmation of the accuracy of the interpolations. The isosteric heats of adsorption for H2 on desolvated NOTT-400a and NOTT-401b were calculated as a function of surface coverage. The estimated error in the measured isosteric enthalpies is 0.1 kJ/mol. a b Figure 8S: Virial fitting plot for the adsorption of H2 on NOTT-400a at 77 K (a) and 87 K (b). a b Figure 9S: Virial fitting plot for the adsorption of H2 on NOTT-400a at 77 K (a) and 87 K (b).
