Manuscript Syntheses, structures, and magnetic properties of heterometallic coordination polymers with carboxyphosphonate linkers† Zhi-Guo Gu and Slavi C. Sevov* Received 31st July 2009, Accepted 14th September 2009 First published as an Advance Article on the web 2nd October 2009 DOI: 10.1039/b915459k Five heterometallic coordination polymers were synthesized utilizing the multifunctional carboxyphosphonate ligand N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid (H4PMIDA), N(CH2PO(OH)2)(CH2COOH)2, with a coordinating nitrogen atom and two carboxylate and one phosphonate groups. The compounds were characterized structurally and magnetically. [Cu2M2(PMIDA)2(H2O)6]$3H2O for M ¼ Mn (1-CuMn), Co (2-CuCo), and Cd (3-CuCd) are isostructural (space group P21/n) and made of honeycomb-like 2D layers which, in turn, are made of unusual double-stranded meso-helices. [Cu2Ln2(PMIDA)2(C2O4)(H2O)6]$3.5H2O for Ln ¼ La (4-CuLa) and Nd (5-CuNd)) are also isostructural (P21/c) but with open 3D framework structures. They contain dinuclear CuLn(PMIDA) secondary building units that are bridged by phosphonate tetrahedra and form inﬁnite chains along the c axis. The chains are interconnected via carboxylic groups and form double-decker layers which, in turn, are connected by the oxalate linkers to form the open three-dimensional framework. The magnetic properties of the compounds were measured and analyzed in detail. Introduction The design and synthesis of metal–organic coordination poly- mers attracts much attention for many reasons, not the least of which are their intriguing variety of architectures and topologies and their potential for applications in a wide range of ﬁelds.1,2 However, while homometallic systems have been extensively explored, not much has been done with heterometallic systems.3 Yet, heterometallic coordination polymers could potentially be very beneﬁcial for two major reasons: one, the introduction of a second metal center may allow for the construction of appealing new topologies, and two, the incorporation of unusual metal coordination environments may inﬂuence the physical properties of the materials, especially their catalytic, photo- luminescent, and magnetic properties.4 There are two main approaches toward the construction of heterometallic coordination polymers. One is to use preformed metal complexes as linkers for the interconnection of the second metal centers by coordinating to them.5 Such a ‘‘complex as a ligand’’ approach was ﬁrst applied successfully by Kahn et al. in the oxamato-bridged manganese(II)–copper(II) chain [MnCu(pbaOH)(H2O)3] (pbaOH ¼ 2-hydroxy-1,3-propylenebi- s(oxamate)),6 and then extended to other 3d-3d heterobimetallic systems with interesting magnetic properties (long-range 3D magnetic order and single-chain magnets).7 The second and more general strategy for the synthesis of heterometallic coordination frameworks relies on: a) the self-assembly of the different metal ions with organic linkers with different donor atoms and b) the different preference of the metal atoms towards different func- tional groups of a linker. A number of 3d-4f frameworks have been synthesized by the latter approach using multidentate multifunctional ligands such as pyridinecarboxylate, amino acids, imidazoledicarboxylic acid, and iminodiacetic acid.8,9 The selection of the two or more different metals in these cases goes hand in hand with the choice and design of the interconnecting ligands so that the coordination sites of the latter are appropriate for each of the metals. While much attention has been focused on structures with nitrogen-containing carboxylate linkers, only very few reports have dealt with heterometallic compounds with phosphonate linkers.10 At the same time, functionalized phos- phonates such as carboxyphosphonates and nitrogen-containing phosphonates and carboxyphosphonates could be the best choice for the construction of heterometallic extended structures because of their variety of diverse coordinating sites and modes with different afﬁnities towards different metal centers. With the above considerations in mind, we explored hetero- metallic coordination polymers with ligands with three different functionalgroups thatcan potentially coordinatetometals,namely a nitrogen site and carboxylic and phosphonic groups. Here we report the synthesis and structural and magnetic characterization of ﬁve heterometallic compounds with N-(phosphonomethyl)imi- nodiacetic acid (H4PMIDA), N(CH2PO3H2)(CH2COOH)2: [Cu2M2(PMIDA)2(H2O)6]$3H2O for M ¼ Mn (1-CuMn), Co (2-CuCo), Cd (3-CuCd), and [Cu2Ln2(PMIDA)2(C2O4) (H2O)3]$3.5H2O for Ln ¼ La (4-CuLa), Nd (5-CuNd).

Structure determination Data sets were collected on a Bruker APEX-II diffractometer with a CCD area detector at 100 K with Mo Ka radiation (l ¼ 0.71073 A˚ ). Raw data collection and processing were done with the SMART software, SAINT was used for the data reduction and for correction for Lorentz and polarization effects,11 and the absorption corrections were applied using the SADABS routine. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares on F2 with anisotropic displacement using the SHELXTL software package.12 All non- hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters during the ﬁnal cycles, while the hydrogen atoms were calculated in ideal positions at the carbon atoms. More details of the data collections and structure reﬁnements are presented in Table 1. Physical measurements Infrared spectra were collected over the range 650–4000 cm1 using a SensIR IlluminatIR spectrometer with a diamond ATR ﬁtted to an Olympus microscope. The spectra are the average of 128 scans each. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was carried out with a Scintag XDS 2000 powder diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (l ¼ 1.5418 A˚ ), solid state detector, scan range of 5 to 50 (2q), step size 0.05 and scan rate 5.0/min. Magnetic measurements were performed on polycrystalline samples with a Quantum Design MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer. Magnetic susceptibilities were measured over the temperature range 2–300 K with an applied magnetic ﬁeld of 2 kOe. Field dependences of the magnetizations were measured using a ﬂux magnetometer in applied ﬁelds of up to 70 kOe generated by a conventional pulsed technique. Data were corrected for the diamagnetic contribution calculated from Pascal constants.

Published on 02 October 2009 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/B915459K View Article Online Results and discussion Crystallographic studies Since compounds 1-CuMn, 2-CuCo, 3-CuCd are isostructural, the structure will be described for 1-CuMn. The asymmetric unit contains two copper and two manganese atoms (the equimolar ratio was conﬁrmed by ICP analysis). Each Cu(II) center is in a square pyramidal coordination formed by one PMIDA ligand in a tetradentate coordination (N1, O1, O3 and O7 for Cu1, and N2, O8, O10 and O12 for Cu2) and a single phosphonate oxygen atom from a second PMIDA unit (Fig. 1). The Cu–Oapical bond lengths, 2.281(2) A˚ for Cu1–O7 and 2.317(2) A˚ for Cu2–O12, are much longer than the Cu–O/Nbasal distances of 1.894(2)–2.021(2) and 1.914(2)–2.015(3) A˚ for Cu1 and Cu2, respectively. The manganese atoms are octahedrally coordinated: Mn1 by three water molecules, two phosphonate oxygen atoms (O7, O13A), and one carboxylic oxygen atom (O11B) from three different PMIDA ligands; Mn2 by four water molecules and two phos- phonate oxygen atoms from two different PMIDA ligands. The Mn–O distances are normal and within the range 2.049(2)– 2.270(3) A˚ . The most interesting feature in 1-CuMn is the speciﬁc way in which the metal centers are linked by phosphonate tetrahedra to form a double-stranded meso-helical motif with a pitch of 19.906 A˚ (Fig. 2). Thus, the Cu centers, interconnected by the phosphonate groups, and the Mn centers, interconnected by the same phosphonate groups, form single-stranded helices that turn in different directions and generate a double-stranded meso- helical chain. Although single-stranded helices have been observed in some coordination polymers,13 the occurrence of a double-stranded or a multiple meso-helix is very rare.14 The double-stranded helices are in turn connected via carboxylic groups and form honeycomb-like layers parallel to the ac plane (Fig. 3). The layers are stacked in /ABAB/ sequence and are held together by numerous interlayer hydrogen-bonds that involve coordinated and uncoordinated water as well as uncoordinated carboxylic oxygen atoms (O2, O4, O9). 4-CuLa and 5-CuNd are also isostructural and crystallize in the monoclinic P21/c space group. Taking 4-CuLa as an example, the asymmetric unit of the structure contains one Cu and one La atoms (Fig. 4). The CuII ion has an elongated octahedral geom- etry with one PMIDA ligand coordinated in a tetradentate fashion (N1, O1, O3 and O7) exactly as in 1-CuMn, one phos- phonate oxygen atom from another PMIDA (O6), and one water molecule (O13). The Cu–O axial distances, 2.637(3) and 2.530(3) A˚ , are much longer than the Cu–O/N basal distances of 1.934(3)–2.019(3) A˚ as expected due to Jahn–Teller distortion. The LaIII center is nine-coordinate in a distorted tricapped trigonal prism where O3, O5, and O10 are the capping atoms. The nine coordinated oxygen atoms are provided by two phos- phonate groups, three carboxylic groups from two PMIDA ligands, one bidentate oxalic anion, and two water molecules. The La–O distances are in the range 2.450(3)–2.765(3) A˚ and Fig. 1 The coordination environment of Cu2+ and Mn2+ ions in 1-CuMn (thermal ellipsoids at 30% probability level). Fig. 2 The double-stranded meso-helices in 1-CuMn (a) are formed by two single-stranded helical chains of [ –Cu–O–P–O–Cu–]n (b) and [–Mn– O–P–O–Mn–] (c) that turn in different directions.

Each metal atom is connected to ﬁve other metal atoms, two of the same and three of different type. The linkages of Ln atoms between adja- cent double layers through the oxalic bridges give rise to a three- dimensional sandwich framework with channels ﬁlled by water molecules (Fig. 6). One common feature in the two structure types is the tetra- dentate coordination of the Cu centers by PMIDA ligands as shown in Chart 1. This suggests that the initial step in the formation of the compounds is most likely the coordination of PMIDA to copper ions to form Cu(PMIDA)2. The latter should be, therefore, considered the building unit of the extended structure. The PMIDA ligand, however, has additional sites that are available for further coordination, and this allows the unit Cu(PMIDA)2 to act as a linker between the second metal centers, either Mn or La. The two structure types differ only because of the different coordination requirements and oxidation states of the secondary metals. Thus, in 1-CuMn the PMIDA molecules coordinate to two or three Mn- atoms (Chart 1, b and c) while in 4-CuLa they interact with four La centers (Chart 1, d). It should be pointed out that such coordination modes are not found for PMIDA in homometallic compounds.16 Magnetic properties Magnetic measurements were performed on polycrystalline samples of complexes 1-CuMn, 2-CuCo, 3-CuCd, 4-CuLa and 5-CuNd. The magnetic susceptibility of 1-CuMn was measured in the range 2–300 K (Fig. 7). The cMT value of 9.25 emu$K$mol1 at room temperature is slightly lower than the spin-only value of 9.50 emu$K$mol1 expected for two high- spin MnII (S ¼ 5/2 and g ¼ 2) and two CuII (S ¼ 1/2 and assuming g ¼ 2) ions. Upon lowering the temperature cMT decreases continuously to reach 7.90 emu$K$mol1 at 10 K. This is then followed by an abrupt increase and a maximum of 9.65 emu$K$mol1 at 2 K. This behavior is indicative of anti- ferromagnetic coupling between the magnetic centers CuII and MnII. The observed ﬁeld-dependent magnetization of ca. M ¼ 7.93 Nb$mol1 at 7 T is as expected for antiferro- magnetically coupled CuII2MnII2 unit. The magnetizations after zero-ﬁeld-cooling (ZFC) and ﬁeld-cooling (FC) in the temper- ature range of 2–15 K and at low applied ﬁeld of 50 Oe coincide with each other and indicate the absence of long-range magnetic ordering above 2 K. This conﬁrms that the compound should be viewed as a 2D network made of dinuclear CuIIMnII units that are interconnected by carboxylate and phosphonate bridges but are magnetically isolated. As such, the high- temperature magnetic data can be ﬁtted by a model of CuIIMnII units and their Hamiltonian H ¼ 2JSCu$SMn as follows: Fig. 6 View of the 3D framework of 4-CuLa showing channels ﬁlled by non-coordinated water molecules.

The signs and relative magnitudes of the exchange parameters compare well with those in other oxygen- bridged compounds containing high-spin MnII and CuII ions.17 The temperaturedependence ofthe magnetic susceptibility for 2- CuCo is displayed in Fig. 8. The room temperature cMT value of 6.75 emu$K$mol1 is much higher than the expected spin-only value for two CuII and two high-spin CoII ions, and this is indicative of signiﬁcant orbital contributions from the CoII ions. Upon lowering the temperature, cMT decreases continuously to 3.83 emu$K$mol1 at 7 K, then goes up slightly to 3.92 emu$K$mol1 at 5 K,and ﬁnally drops to3.54emu$K$mol1 at2 K.All thissuggests antiferromagnetic coupling between the CuII and CoII centers. This is supported further by the apparently unsaturated magnetization value of 4.61 Nb$mol1 at 7 T and temperature of 2 K (insert in Fig. 8). The ZFC and FC magnetizations carried out in the 2–15 K range at 50 Oe showed no evidence of magnetic ordering. The magnetic exchange interactions and the spin–orbit coupling for the compound were estimated based on the simple phenomenological equation cMT ¼ Aexp(E1/kT) + Bexp(E2/kT) where A + B is equal to the Curie constant and E1 and E2 are the ‘‘activation energies’’ of the spin–orbit coupling and the magnetic interaction, respectively.18 The best parameters obtained after least-squares ﬁtting are A + B ¼ 7.30 emu$K$mol1, and E1 ¼ 55.01 and E2 ¼ 1.01 cm1. E1 is consistent with the values reported for other CoII systems.18,19 The positive activation energy E2 conﬁrms that antiferromagnetic interactions are operative in 2-CuCo. The magnetizations of 3-CuCd and 4-CuLa are very similar because CdII and LaIII ions are diamagnetic and the magnetic behavior is due only to the CuII ions (Fig. 9). The cMT values for 3-CuCd and 4-CuLa at room temperature are very similar, 0.85 and 0.80 emu$K$mol1, respectively, and fall in the range expected for two isolated CuII ions (S ¼ 1/2). As the temperature decreases cMT decreases very slowly and then abruptly falls at low temperatures reachingvaluesof0.59and0.39emu$K$mol1at2Kfor3-CuCdand 4-CuLa, respectively. A closer inspection of the structure of the two compounds aimed at ﬁnding possible magnetic interactions revealed that it can be approximated simply with a uniform chain of cop- per(II) ions connected by –O–P–O– bridges. The data were analysed using the expression derived from the isotropic spin-exchange HamiltonianH¼ JPSi$Si+1whereS¼ 1/2.Thebestﬁttingresults with intermolecular interactions (zJ0) were obtained for g ¼ 2.10 and 2.08, J ¼ 2.01 and 0.94 cm1, zJ0 ¼ 0.05 and 0.07 cm1, temperature-independent paramagnetism (TIP) ¼ 0.013 and 0.021 emu/mol, and R ¼ 2.5  103 and 5.7  104 for 3-CuCd and 4- CuLa, respectively. The negative J values conﬁrm the presence of antiferromagnetic exchange transmittedby the phosphonate groups. Lastly, the magnetization of 5-CuNd (Fig. 10) shows a room temperaturevalueof4.37emu$K$mol1forcMT.Thisisveryclose to the calculated value expected for two isolated CuII (SCu ¼ 1/2) and two isolated NdIII ions (J ¼ 9/2, gJ ¼ 8/11). Upon lowering the temperature cMT marginally decreases until 50 K below which it decreases more rapidly reaching its lowest value of 2.40 emu$K$mol1 at 2 K. The data above 100 K obey the Curie–Weiss law with C ¼ 4.74 emu$K$mol1 and q ¼ 26.79 K (Fig. 10). Further interpretation and simulation of the magnetic properties of this compound, however, are very difﬁcult due to: a) ﬁrst-order orbital momentum and the resulting spin–orbital couplings of the single lanthanide ions,20 and b) the complicated nature of the structure with many NdIII–CuII, NdIII–NdIII, and CuII–CuII inter- actions mediated through m2-O, O–P–O, and oxalic bridges.

Although many heterometallic complexes have been reported, examples of phosphonate-bridged heterometallic frameworks are still quite rare. Compounds 1-CuMn, 2-CuCo and 3-CuCd are rare examples of heterometallic two-dimensional polymers con- taining double-stranded meso-helices, while compounds 4-CuLa and 5-CuNd are three-dimensional 3d-4f open-framework structures with interesting double layers. Further exploration for phosphonate-bridged heterometallic materials combining open- framework structures and interesting magnetic properties is currently under way in our laboratory.
