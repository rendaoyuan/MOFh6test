In our work diﬀerent MOFs were synthesized from diﬀerent metal ions and in diﬀerent solvents, leading to a variety of co- ordination modes and structures. In addition, the photochemical properties of compounds 1–4 and the ligands in the solid state were studied. Introduction In recent years, MOFs have been increasingly attracting inter- est from many inorganic chemists due to their charming structures and potential applications, for instance in gas absorption,1 gas separation,2 hydrogen storage,3 molecular magnetism,4 catalysis,5 solvatochromism,6 etc. The structures and properties of MOFs are influenced by many factors, such as the nature of the metal ions7 and ancillary ligands,8 sol- vents, reaction temperature,9 etc.10,11 MOFs can be constructed from metal ions and carboxylic acid- or nitrogen-containing ligands. Compared with poly- carboxylic acids, nitrogen-containing ligands have some advantages.12 In most situations, N-containing ligands are electrically neutral, while carboxylate ligands are negatively charged. Moreover, the coordination sites of the N-containing ligands are located in the aromatic rings and cannot rotate freely, quite diﬀerent from those of carboxylic acid ligands.13 Nitrogen-containing ligands can adopt many diﬀerent coordi- nation modes, for instance monodentate, bidentate or chelat- ing.14 To date, pyridine-containing ligands account for the largest proportion of nitrogen-containing ligands in MOF systems.15 Triphenylamine is a triangle-shaped substance. In order to construct triangular ligands, nitrogen-containing rings have been introduced to ligands which are based on tri- phenylamine cores.16 Tris(4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)phenyl)amine (TIPA) is an interesting ligand and, for example, a 54-fold interpenetrated MOF was constructed from Cu2+ and TIPA.17 Herein, we connect pyridine rings to triphenylamine, build- ing up a tri(4-pyridylphenyl)amine (TPPA) ligand. As the N atoms are located on the axes of the benzene-pyridine arms, the TPPA ligand is “semi-rigid”. Combined with polycarboxylic acids or even inorganic salts alone, a variety of MOFs can be constructed. Some MOFs based on TPPA have been already synthesized in our previous work, for example, {[Zn(TPPA)- (suc)]·5(H2O)·DMA}n, a solvent accessible MOF with void space as large as 37.6%.18 In this paper, four new compounds were obtained under solvothermal conditions, namely [Co2(TPPA)2(1,3-bdc)2(H2O)]n (1), [Zn(TPPA)(1,3-bdc)]n (2), [Zn6(TPPA)2(betc)(Hbetc)2(H2betc)(H2O)6·7H2O·2DMA]n (3) and [Cu(TPPA)(NO3)2(H2O)]·2H2O]n (4). As excepted, the self-assembly of TPPA and ancillary ligands is an eﬀective method to gene- rate unique architectures and topologies. Compounds 1 and 2 are both built up from TPPA and H2bdc ligands, but they possess quite diﬀerent structures. Compound 1 is a 3D struc- ture with 2-fold interpenetration, while compound 2 is a simple 2D structure. Compound 3 is a 3D non-interpenetrated structure with over 24% solvent accessible void space. Com- pound 4 comprises a 2D network with diﬀerent coordination modes, and the 2D networks alternate with others to form a 3D framework. †Dedicated to Professor Xin-Quan Xin on the occasion of his 80th birthday. ‡Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Selected bond lengths and angles, complementary representations of crystal structures, and simulated and experimental X-ray powder diﬀraction patterns.

View Article Online View Journal | View Issue Experimental section Materials and general methods All compounds were characterized by X-ray powder diﬀraction, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray crystallography. All of the raw materials were commercially purchased except for the TPPA ligand. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were per- formed using a Pyris 1 DSC at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) experiments were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diﬀractometer using Cu Kα radiation (1.54056 Å) at room temperature. Luminescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS55 fluorescence spectrophoto- meter at room temperature. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-vis spectrophotometer UV-3600 at room temperature. Synthetic procedure Compounds 1–4 can be synthesized using a general procedure: a mixture of metal nitrate (0.1 mmol), TPPA (47.6 mg, 0.1 mmol) and dicarboxylic acid (0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 15 mL of a solvent mixture. The final mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL) under auto- genous pressure and heated at a certain temperature for 72 hours. Detailed information on the syntheses and the main compound features are displayed in Table 1. X-ray crystallography X-ray crystallographic data for 1, 2 and 4 were collected at room temperature using epoxy-coated crystals mounted on glass fibers. X-ray crystallographic data of 3 were collected at room temperature by way of sealing the better quality single crystals in a quartz tube with the mother liquor. X-ray crystallo- graphic data of these compounds were collected on a Bruker Apex Smart CCD diﬀractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The structures were solved by direct methods and the non-hydrogen atoms were located from the electron density map and then refined with SHELXTL using full-matrix least-squares procedures based on F2 values. The hydrogen atoms were fixed geometrically at calculated dis- tances and allowed to ride on the parent atoms. The relevant crystallographic data are displayed in Table 2, while the bond lengths and angles are shown in the ESI.‡ A semiempirical absorption correction was applied using SADABS.19 Topologi- cal analysis was performed and some diagrams were produced using the TOPOS program.20 CCDC numbers are 1000812– 1000815 for 1–4, respectively. Results and discussion The structure of 1 The crystal structure determination of 1 reveals that the complex crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system in the Pcca space group. There is one Co2+ atom, one TPPA ligand, one deprotonated 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid ligand and 1/2 a H2O molecule in the asymmetric unit. The local geometry of the Co2+ atom is depicted in Fig. 1a. The coordination environ- ments of the two Co2+ centres are diﬀerent. One Co2+ atom coordinates three N atoms from three TPPA ligands and four oxygen atoms from two 1,3-bdc2−ligands, while the other Co2+ atom coordinates three TPPA ligands, two oxygen atoms from two 1,3-bdc2−ligands and one water molecule. Each Co2+ atom is connected to three TPPA ligands, while each TPPA ligand is connected to three Co2+ atoms, building up a 2D sheet (Fig. 1b). The 2D sheets are further connected by 1,3-bdc2− ligands, forming a 3D framework (Fig. 1c). The Co–N bond lengths range from 2.151(2) to 2.238(4) Å, similar to typical values in other Co(II) complexes. The Co–O bond lengths range from 1.976(4) to 2.044(2) Å, also similar to the values in other complexes.20 In a single framework there is a channel with dimensions 11.0006(46) × 17.2188(44) Å2. The channel is large enough to contain another equivalent framework, giving a 2-fold interpenetrated framework (Fig. 1d). Upon interpenetrat- ing there is no void space, as calculated by PLATON. The structure of 2 The crystal structure determination of 2 reveals that the complex crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system in the C2/c space group. There is one Zn2+ atom, one TPPA ligand and one deprotonated 1,3-bdc2−ligand in the asymmetric unit. The local geometry of the Zn2+ atom is depicted in Fig. 2a.

The structure of 3 The crystal structure determination of 3 reveals that the complex crystallizes in the triclinic crystal system in the P1ˉ space group. There are three Zn2+ atoms, two TPPA ligands, one Hbtec3−ligand, 1/2 a H2btec2−ligand, 1/2 a btec4−ligand, three coordinated water molecules, 7/2 lattice water molecules, as well as one DMA molecule in the asymmetric unit.

One TPPA ligand connects to two Zn2+ atoms. The betc ligands adopt diﬀerent coordination modes due to partial deprotonation. All betc ligands link Zn2+ cations to form a 3D structure (Fig. 3c). Finally, the betc and TPPA ligands connect the Zn atoms to form a non-interpenetrating structure (Fig. 3d). The Schläfli symbol for this binodal net is {4·6.83·10}2{4·62·83}2{62·82·102} {62·8}2. There is a solvent accessible void space as large as 24.2%. The structure of 4 The crystal structure determination of 4 reveals that the complex crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system in the P21/n space group. There is one Cu2+ ion, one TPPA ligand, two nitrate ions and two H2O molecules in the asymmetric unit. The local coordination environment of Cu2+ is depicted in Fig. 4a. One Cu2+ coordinates six atoms, including three N atoms from three TPPA ligands, two O atoms from two nitrate ligands and one O atom from one water molecule. One TPPA ligand is connected to three Cu2+ atoms, and one Cu2+ atom is connected to three N atoms, building up a 2D sheet (Fig. 4b). There are some holes in the 2D sheet, large enough to accom- modate water molecules (Fig. 4c). The lengths of the Cu–N bonds range from 2.107(2) to 2.1324(19), similar to the typical value of other compounds. The lengths of the Cu–O bonds range from 2.0279(19) to 2.0804(16), also similar to the values of other compounds. As shown in Fig. 4d, the Schläfli symbol for this binodal net is {63} and the topology type of this net is hcb. The voids are large enough that they can be filled by other nets and each net is catenated by two parallel adjacent identi- cal motifs. Therefore, the whole structure is a 2D + 2D →3D polycatenated entanglement. To date there are only a few examples where 2D sheets increase to an overall 3D entangle- ment for polycatenated systems.21 TGA analysis and powder X-ray diﬀraction The stabilities of 1–4 were examined by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) in an air atmosphere over the temperature range 20–700 °C at the heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The results indicate that all four MOFs are stable in an air atmosphere (Fig. 5). Compound 1 did not show any obvious weight loss below 490 °C and a collapse of the framework is then observed at 490 °C, indicating that there are no guest molecules in the structure of compound 1. For compound 2, there is a weight Fig. 4 (a) Coordination environment of 4. (b) View of the 2D sheet in 4. (c) View of the “hole” formed by Cu2+ ions and TPPA ligands.

In our opinion, some water or other guest molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the powder, which are then easy to lose below 100 °C. Com- pound 2 is also thermo-stable, as there is no further weight loss until 420 °C. For compound 3, a weight loss of 11.307% occurs below 150 °C. The results indicate that there are 7/2 molecules of water and 1 DMA molecule in the asymmetric unit (calcd 10.949%). Compound 3 is less stable than the other three, collapsing at 300 °C. Compound 4 acts quite diﬀerently, it loses 4.909% of its weight (calcd 5.016%) in the range 120–170 °C, indicating a loss of two non-coordinated water molecules. Then a 2.347% weight loss (calcd 2.508%) occurs between 210 and 230 °C, indicating the loss of one co- ordinated water molecule. A further weight loss of 8.760% (calcd 8.634%) occurs between 280 and 300 °C, indicating the loss of a NO3 −ion. The structure collapses at 390 °C. For compounds 1, 2 and 4, the X-ray diﬀraction patterns are very similar to those for the simulated data. For compound 3, the experimental data appears to be quite diﬀerent from the simulated data. This occurs when the single crystal easily eﬄoresces in air. The simulated data is simulated from the original single crystal data, but some of the experimental data is recorded after eﬄorescence (Fig. S1‡). Optical properties The UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 and 4 were recorded at room temperature (Fig. 6). Co-centered MOF 1 exhibits a strong absorption at 340 nm, which can be attributed to ligand–metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transitions. Both MOF 1 and the free TPPA ligand (inset of Fig. 6) exhibit an absorption at 230–260 nm, which can be attributed to π→π* transitions. For MOF 1 there is a weak absorption at 540 nm, which can be attributed to d–d transitions. For Cu-centered MOF 4, π→π* transitions are also observed at 230–260 nm. A weak absorp- tion is additionally observed at 625 nm, which can be attribu- ted to d–d transitions. In contrast to the Co-centered MOF, the LMCT transition at 340 nm is much weaker. Luminescent compounds are of great interest because they may be useful for a variety of applications in the fields of chemical sensors,22 photochemistry, etc.23 Only the lumines- cence spectrum of 2 was recorded (as compound 3 is not stable). Compared to the fluorescence spectrum of free TPPA (λem = 525 nm at the excitation wavelength of 420 nm), only a minor shift is observed for the solid-state fluorescence spec- trum of compound 2. As shown in Fig. 7, the luminescence emission of compound 2 is caused by the TPPA ligand. Conclusions In conclusion, four novel MOFs based on the triangular TPPA ligand have been synthesized, three of which are stable in an air atmosphere. Compound 1 comprises a 2-fold interpenetrat- ing 3D structure with a net of {63}{68·82} topology. Compound 2 is a 2D framework. The coordination mode of TPPA in 2 is diﬀerent from that in 1 as only two N atoms of three pyridine rings are connected to the metal ions. For compounds 1 and 2 there is only a diﬀerence in the metal ions, but the resulting structures are quite diﬀerent. Compound 3 comprises a non- interpenetrated 3D structure with void space of up to 24.2% and a net of {4·6·83·10}2{4·62·83}2{62·82·102}{62·8}2 topology. Compound 4 does not contain carboxylate ligands, but instead contains nitrate ligands. Diﬀerent from compounds 1–3, com- pound 4 shows a 2D →3D framework with parallel polycate- nation. The results indicate that the change in metal ions and the introduction of ancillary ligands show significant eﬀects on the resulting structures.
