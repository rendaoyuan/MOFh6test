Manuscript PAPER www.rsc.org/dalton | Dalton Transactions Syntheses, structures and magnetic properties of a family of metal carboxylate polymers via in situ metal–ligand reactions of benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid† Yan-Zhen Zheng, Yue-Biao Zhang, Ming-Liang Tong,* Wei Xue and Xiao-Ming Chen* Received 10th September 2008, Accepted 6th November 2008 First published as an Advance Article on the web 13th January 2009 DOI: 10.1039/b815843f Nine new coordination polymers: [Cu3(ipO)2(pyz)2] (5), [Cu3(ipO)2(4-phpy)(H2O)2] (6), [Cu(ip)(4-phpy)2] (7), [Cu3(ipO)2(H2O)2] (8), [Co(phen)(ip)(H2O)] (9), [Co3(1,2,3-btc)2(4,4¢-bpy)2(H2O)2]·2H2O (10), [Ni(1,2,3-btcH)(4,4¢-bpy)(H2O)]·H2O (11), [Cd5(1,2,3-btc)2(1,2,3-btcH)2(4,4¢-bpy)3(H2O)2] (12) and (1,2,3-btcH3)(4,4¢-bpy) (13) (1,2,3-btcH3 = 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylic acid, ipO = 2-hydroxyisophthalate, 4,4¢-bpy = 4,4¢-bipyridine, pyz = pyrazine, 4-phpy = 4-phenyl-pyridine and phen = o-phenanthroline) have been hydrothermally synthesized. This family of compounds show the role of the N-containing heterocyclic ligands and Cu(II) ions in the metal–ligand reactions. These results suggest that the hydroxylation requires Cu(II) ions as the oxidant, rather than the presence of N-containing heterocyclic ligands, while the decarboxylate procedure requires high temperature and basic condition rather than the participation of Cu(II) ions. The obtained compounds show versatile structures and magnetic properties due to the ﬂexibility of the carboxylate ligands. Compound 5 shows dominated antiferromagnetic interaction in the [Cu2(m-ipO)2] unit, and no long-range magnetic ordering behaviour. Compound 10 has a topologically ferrimagnetic chain with alternating CoII octCoII tetCoII oct (oct = octahedral, tet = tetrahedal) spin arrangement. The CoII tet and CoII oct ions are bridged by similar syn–anti carboxylates (CoII tet ◊◊◊CoII oct 4.616 and 4.735 A˚ ). Such a chain shows ferro- and antiferro- magnetic interactions and no long-range magnetic ordering behaviour was observed. Compound 11 has a antiferromagnetic coupled syn–anti carbxylate-bridged Ni(II) chain (J = 1.48(2) K), and shows long-range magnetic order below 2.6 K due to the extensive hydrogen bonds between the chains. Introduction Solvothermal (including hydrothermal hereafter) in situ metal– ligand reactions, as a new bridge between coordination chemistry and organic synthetic chemistry, has attracted intensive interest in recent years.1 The research topics in this area are mainly focused on: (i) discovering new “one-pot” reaction avenues for some inaccessible or not easily accessible organic reactions at normal ambient conditions; (ii) applying the obtained ligands for generation of new functional coordination materials and (iii) clarifying the reaction mechanisms. In the past decade, several interesting solvothermal in situ metal–ligand reactions, including dehydrogenative carbon–carbon coupling,2 hydroxylation of aromatic rings,3,4 cycloaddition of organic nitriles with azide and ammonia,5 transformation of inorganic and organic sulfur,6 as well as metal redox reactions have been discovered.7 In some of the above reactions, the mechanisms of some reactions have been well explained by discovering the MOE Laboratory of Bioinorganic and Synthetic Chemistry, State Key Labo- ratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.

Moreover, the application of these new ligands for designing new functional materials are in progress.8 Recently, we reported the in situ metal–ligand redox re- action of CuII and isophthalate (ip) yields [Cu2(ipO)(4,4¢- bpy)] (ipO = 2-hydroxyisophthalate, 4,4¢-bpy = 4,4¢-bipyridine) (1),4a and relevant reactions by using Cu(II) and 1,2,3- benzinetricarboxylic acid (1,2,3-btcH3),4b which yielded 1, [Cu3(ipO)2(4,4¢-bpy)0.5(H2O)2] (2), [Cu2(ip)(ipH)(4,4¢-bpy)1.5] (3) and [Cu2(1,2,3-btc)(4,4¢-bpy)(H2O)2](NO3) (4), depending on the reaction pH conditions. Although we have already known that this reaction is highly related to the pH value, some questions, especially the role of CuII and 4,4¢-bpy (hereafter using L-ligand to represent the N-containing heterocyclic and H2O ligands in this reaction), still need to be answered. Moreover, the carboxylate ligands as a mediator between the metal centers can transfer or separate the magnetic communications.9 Therefore, some carboxylate ligands, especially those with multi-carboxylate ends at one side might be good can- didates for creating low-dimensional magnetic compounds,10 as exempliﬁed by our incorporation of the Ising-type ferromagnetic CoII-carboxylate chain into a two-dimensional (2D) network to form a new type of single-chain magnet.10a,11 Following our previous investigations4a,b on the in situ metal– ligand of CuII and ip, we present herein a systematic research on this reaction, which aims at on one hand, clarifying the role of 1396 | Dalton Trans., 2009, 1396–1406 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009 Published on 13 January 2009.

Results and discussion Syntheses All the reactions are summarized in Scheme 1, which shows that the analogous ligands of 4,4¢-bpy, such as pyrazine (pyz) and 4-phenyl-pyridine (4-phpy), can also lead to the formation of hydroxylated products in the presence of CuII: [Cu3(ipO)2(pyz)2] (5), [Cu3(ipO)2(4-phpy)(H2O)2] (6) and a by-product [Cu(ip)(4- phpy)2] (7). Even in the absence of an N-containing heterocyclic ligand, a hydroxylated product [Cu3(ipO)2(H2O)2] (8) can also be formed, which suggests that the phenyl ring hydroxylation reaction can occur in the absence of any N-containing heterocyclic ligand. However, the yields of these hydroxylated products decrease in a sequence of 4,4¢-bpy (95%) > pyz (45%) > H2O (23%) ª 4-phpy (21%), implying that 4,4¢-bpy can increase hydroxylation yield. Other transition metal ions were also employed to exam- ine the role of CuII ion in this in situ metal–ligand redox reaction. The results show that other metal ions, such as CoII, NiII, CdII, FeII and FeIII, can not induce the 1,2,3- btcH3 ligand turn into a ipO ligand even at highly basic condition. If o-phenanthroline (phen) and CoII ion were em- ployed, a decarboxylate product [Co(phen)(ip)(H2O)] (9) can be obtained under basic conditions. In contrast, the carboxy- late products of [Co3(1,2,3-btc)2(4,4¢-bpy)2(H2O)2]·2H2O (10), [Ni(1,2,3-btcH)(4,4¢-bpy)(H2O)]·H2O (11), [Cd5(1,2,3-btc)2(1,2,3- btcH)2(4,4¢-bpy)3(H2O)2] (12) and (1,2,3-btcH3)(4,4¢-bpy) (13) can be obtained with very high yields at acidic condition. These results suggest that the hydroxylation requires CuII ions as the oxidant, while the decarboxylate procedure requires the high temperature and basic condition rather than the participation of CuII ions. Possible mechanism of ipOH formation Based on the above and previous results, the in situ metal– ligand reaction from 1,2,3-btc to ipO is suggested to be a two- step procedure containing decarboxylation and hydroxylation reactions, as shown in Scheme 2. Obviously, it is easy for 1,2,3- btc to decarboxylate at the 2-site position in the ﬁrst step when heating it in basic condition, leading to the formation of ip. In the second step, the hydroxylation can be considered as a redox reaction of ip, which has been previously revealed.4a In this step, the carbon atom at the 2-position is a electron-poor site due to the electron withdrawing effect of adjacent carboxylate groups. Moreover, the coordination of CuII ions can enhance the electron Scheme 2 A possible mechanism of the reaction between 1,2,3-btc and CuII in basic condition.

View Article Online withdrawing effect, and cause the electron transfer from the ligand to CuII ions (two electrons are transferred and two CuI ions are produced when one ip is oxidized).12 However, the CuI ions are not observed in 5, 6 and 7, which may be attributed to the formation of insoluble cuprous oxide and other soluble cuprous compounds. Actually, we did observe a small amount of unrecognized dark red (the color of cuprous oxide) powder admixtured with the products. This deduction is also supported by the fact that in the absence of CuII ions, no ipO containing product was isolated. Crystal structures [Cu3(ipO)2(pyz)2] (5). The asymmetric unit of 5 is a homo- divalent CuII trimer, being similar to that of 2, as shown in Fig. 1a. However, the crystallographically unique Cu2 is coordinated by the carboxylate oxygen atoms, rather than two aqua ligands in 2. Therefore, the crystallographic symmetry of 5 is higher than that of 2. It should be noted that the carboxylate ends of ipO exhibit two different coordination modes: one is the bidentate-bridging associated with Cu1 and Cu2 ions, the other is anti–anti bridging with two Cu1 ions. The pyz ligand also connects Cu2 ions, giving Fig. 1 The coordination environments (a) and 3D packing diagram (b) in 5.

The two carboxylate ends of ipO have similar coordination modes of 2 and 5. Although the 4-phpy is a terminal ligand, the weakly coordinated carboxylate oxygen at the axial position of the CuII square-pyramid links the [Cu2 II(ipO)2CuII] chain into a stairs- like layer (Fig. 2b). There are also extensive hydrogen bonding interactions in the lattice due to presence of the aqua ligands.

The structure of 7 features a 2D layer constructed by CuII-ip chains and the 4,4¢-bpy pillars (Fig. 3). The coordination modes of the ip carboxylate ends in 7 are also different: one is a syn–syn bridging mode with the inversely- related CuII dimer (CuII ◊◊◊CuII 4.509 A˚ ), the other is virtually a bidentate-chelating mode, since the two Cu–O bonds are very different (Cu1–O1 1.978(4) and Cu1–O2 2.714 A˚ ).

The structure of 8 has been reported in the literature, and we will not repeat here.13 [Co(phen)(ip)(H2O)] (9). The structure of 9 features a simple 1D CoII-ip chain (Fig. 4), in which the CoII ion is six-coordinated by three carboxylate-O atoms (Co–O 2.030(2)-2.195(5) A˚ ), one aqua ligand (Co–O 2.110(2) A˚ ) and two nitrogen atoms from the phen ligand (Co–N 2.095(2)–2.121(2) A˚ ). The m-ip ligand also has two coordination modes: chelating and monodentate, which are different from those in 7. These chains are further stacked via p–p stacking interactions of the phen rings and hydrogen bonds between the aqua ligand and carboxylate groups (Fig. S1).† Fig. 4 ORTEP view (35% possibility) of the 1D chain in 9. [Co3(1,2,3-btc)2(4,4¢-bpy)2(H2O)2]·2H2O (10). The asymmet- ric unit of 10 has one and a half CoII ions in different coordination geometries (Fig. 5a). Co1 is six-coodinated by three oxygen atoms from three carboxylate groups (Co–O 2.063(5)–2.084(6) A˚ ) and one aqua ligand (Co–O 2.185(6) A˚ ), and two nitrogen atoms from two different 4,4¢-bpy ligands (Co–N 2.110(6)-2.146(7) A˚ ). Co2 is four-coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four carboxylate groups (Co–O 1.975(6)–1.979(6) A˚ ). The Co1 and Co2 ions are bridged by four syn–anti carboxylate groups to form an alternating chain (CoII ◊◊◊CoII 4.616–4.735 A˚ ) (Fig. 5b). Such chains are extended along the c direction, and connected by the 4,4¢-bpy ligands to form a 3D networks (Fig. 5c). The guest water molecules occupy 14.4% void space of the crystal volume.

There is only one six-coordinated NiII ion with four planar oxygen atoms from the carboxylate groups (Ni–O 2.038(2)–2.106(1) A˚ ) and two axial nitrogen atoms from the 4,4¢-bpy (Ni–N 2.090(2)–2.111(2) A˚ ) in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 6a). Therefore, the 1,2,3-btcH3 is not fully deprotonated for the charge balance.

The temperature-dependent sus- ceptibility data of 5 has been measured under a dc ﬁeld of 5 KOe (Fig. 9). At 300 K, the cT value is 0.77 cm3mol-1K, signiﬁcantly lower than the expected value of 1.13 cm3mol-1K for non-coupled CuII 3 unit, indicating dominated antiferromagnetic coupling between the magnetic centres. Upon cooling, the cT plot decreases smoothly and then reach a platform below 100 K, the cT value is close 0.42 cm3mol-1K, a value that is close to a net magnetic moment for spin of 1/2 (0.38 cm3mol-1K). Below 20 K, the cT plot drops quickly, which is caused by the antiferromagnetic interactions between the CuII trimers.14 At 2.0 K, the ﬁeld-dependent magnetization was increasing linearly 1400 | Dalton Trans., 2009, 1396–1406 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009 Published on 13 January 2009.

This behaviour is probably due to the signiﬁcant antiferromagnetic interactions between the CuII ions since the CuII ions are not so anisotropic. Fig. 10 Field-dependent magnetization of 5 at 2 K. To further study the magnetic behaviour of 5, we used the following Heisenberg Hamiltonian, eqn (1) since it has the basic magnetic unit of [Cu2(m-ipO)2Cu] (Fig. 11), ˆH = -2(J12 ˆS1 ˆS2 + J13 ˆS1 ˆS3+ J23 ˆS2 ˆS3) (1) Fig. 11 The repeating [Cu2(m-ipO)2Cu] unit in 5. which gives two spin doublet and one spin quartet states with the following respective energies: E(3/2) = -(2J12 + 2J13 + 2J23)/4 and E(1/2,±) = (2J12 + 2J13 + 2J23)/4 ± {[(2J12 - 2J13)2 + (2J23 - 2J12)2 + (2J13 - 2J23)2]/8}1/2.

Taking into account the trimeric units in 5 are highly correlated, a mean ﬁeld approximation (q) was employed. Fitting eqn (2) gives D1 = 286 cm-1, D2 = 165 cm-1, g = 2.27 and q = -7.7 K. The fact that the quartet is far above the ground state may indicates that all the Jij values are antiferromagnetic. The large zJ¢ value indicates that antiferromagnetic interactions between the trimer are signiﬁcant, which is reasonable because all the trimers are linked by carboxylate bridges. An arising problem is no way to determine three independent Jij values unambiguously by only D1 and D2. As demonstrated by Gatteschi et al.,15 the the Jij values can only be estimated in a certain range by the above model. To simplify the model, the Hamiltonian can be written as: ˆH = -2J( ˆS1 ˆS2 + ˆS2 ˆS3) (3) which neglects the difference of J12 and J23, and also omits J13. This Hamiltonian leads to the following equation. c b T Ng k J k T J k T J k T J B B B B = + + + + 2 2 4 1 10 3 2 1 2 3 exp( / ) exp( / ) exp( / ) exp( / ) 2k T B (4) Unexpectedly, a very good simulation of the cT plot, and the obtained parameters are shown in Table 1. The large negative J value indicates strong antiferromagnetic interaction in the Cu2(m-ipO)2 dimer is dominated in this trimer, and the antiferro- magnetic interaction between the Cu2(m-ipO) dimer and the single CuII ion is much weaker. Since the CuII 2(m-OR)2 dimers have been widely studied, and the factors inﬂuencing the strength of superexchange—couplings are mainly associated with f.16 We used the famous, empirical analytical expression: eqn (5), J(cm-1)= 74f + 7270 (5) to test our results. Surprisingly, we found that the value obtained by eqn (5) is closer to the value calculated from eqn (4), which may indicate that the antiferromagnetic interactions in the trimeric [Cu2(m-ipO)2Cu] unit are almost attributed to the Cu2(m-OR)2 part. Magnetic properties of 10. The temperature-dependent sus- ceptibility data of 10 were measured under a dc ﬁeld of 1.0 KOe (Fig. 12). At room temperature (300 K), the cT value is 9.69 cm3mol-1K, which is signiﬁcantly larger than the expected spin-only value (5.63 cm3mol-1K) for three non-coupled CoII ions, indicating that the orbital contribution of the octahedral CoII ions Table 1 Magnetic ﬁtting results with different models of 5 eqn (2) eqn (4) eqn (5) D1/cm-1 D2/cm-1 zJ/cm-1 g J/cm-1 zJ¢/cm-1 g f/◦ J/cm-1 286 165 -7.7 2.27 -149 -10.7 2.27 100.5 -167 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009 Dalton Trans., 2009, 1396–1406 | 1401 Published on 13 January 2009.

Upon cooling, the cT plot decreases smoothly down to 50 K. In this region, the susceptibility data were well ﬁtted by the Curie–Weiss law, c = C/(T - q), which gives a C value of 10.59 cm3mol-1K and a q value of -31.83 K. The moderate negative q value may indicate not only the spin–orbital coupling of the single CoII ion, but also antiferromagnetic coupling effect between the CoII ions. Below 30 K, the cT plot drops quickly, which may be caused by the zero-ﬁeld splitting effect and/or antiferromagnetic interaction of the CoII ions.12 At 2.5 K, the ﬁeld-dependent magnetization was increasing to a maximum value of 5.94 Nb (Fig. 13), indicating the magnetic moment is still unsaturated. This behaviour is typically the octahedral CoII ion with signiﬁcant single-ion anisotropy and the effective spin-1/2 below 30 K.14 Fig. 13 Field-dependent magnetization of 10 at 2.5 K. As mentioned in the structural description above, 10 features a topologically ferrimagnetic CoII-carboxylate chain (Scheme 3), which is further connected by the 4,4¢-bpy ligand. Therefore, these spin-chains in 10 are well isolated. Because the distances between the octahedral Co1 and tetrahedral Co2 ions are slightly different, we use two J to describe the coupling pathways in this chain. Scheme 3 The spin-coupling pathways of the topological ferromagnetic chain in 10. This kind of topological-ferrimagnetic spin-1/2 chain has been studied by Drillon et. al. with the following Hamiltonain: eqn (6),17 ˆH = -J1 ( ˆS3n-1 ˆS3n + ˆS3n ˆS3n+1) -J2 ( ˆS3n ˆS3n+2 + ˆS3n+1 ˆS3n+3) - gBH( ˆS3n + ˆS3n-1 + ˆS3n+1) (6) which treats the chain as interacting linear trimers. We applied this analytical expression17 to ﬁt the magnetic data of 10 from 30–2 K, which gives J1 = -17.7(4) K, J2 = 1.38(6) K and g = 4.95(3). The large g value is consistent with the treatment of effective spin 1/2 for CoII ions below 30 K. The obtained J values indicate both ferro- and antiferro-magnetic interactions coexist in the syn– anti carboxylate-bridged CoII ions, which are also observed in other metal ions.7b,18 However, the lack of onset of the cT plot does not imply the ferrimagnet-like behaviour in 10. According to eqn (6), such a topologically ferrimagnetic chain behaves as an antiferromagnetic chain when |2J1| > J2, which is in accordance with the ﬁtting result.17b Magnetic properties of 11. The temperature-dependent sus- ceptibility data of 11 were measured under a dc ﬁeld of 1 KOe (Fig. 14). At room temperature (305 K), the cT value is 1.24 cm3mol-1K, which is larger than the expected spin-only value (1.00 cm3mol-1K) for a one non-coupled NiII ion, and consistent with other compounds with an octahedral NiII ion.14 Upon cooling, the cT plot decreases gradually down to 50 K. In this region, the susceptibility data were well ﬁtted by the Curie– Weiss law with a C value of 1.19 cm3mol-1K and a q value of 6.11 K. The small positive q value may indicate the ferromagnetic coupling between the NiII ions. This conclusion is further supported by the cT plot below 50 K, which shows a quick increase before goes to the maximum of 2.50 cm3mol-1K at 2.6 K. The presence of the maximum in the cT plot may indicate a long-range magnetic ordering behaviour in 11. The susceptibility data from 300–6 K can be well simulated by the Fisher model, eqn (7):19 c b chian = - + N M k T u u B ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 3 1 1 (7) where M = g[S(S + 1)]1/2 and u = coth(J/kBT) - kBT/J. In order to ﬁt experimental data, the exchange energy J must be scaled following the usual procedure: J →JS(S + 1). The best ﬁtting gives J = 1.48(2) K and g = 2.215(3). The positive J value shows weak ferromagnetic interactions in the syn–anti carboxylate-bridged NiII chain, which was also observed in some known examples.7b,18 Fig. 14 Temperature-dependent susceptibility data of 11 under a dc ﬁeld of 1KOe.

View Article Online The ﬁeld-dependent magnetization at 2 K shows a maximum value of 2.0 Nb (Fig. 15) at 70 kOe, indicating the magnetic moment is almost saturated (the expected saturated value Ms = nSg = 2 Nb, assuming g = 2). To conﬁrm the ferromagnetic interactions between the NiII ions, we plotted the Brillouin curve for uncoupled spin 1, which is below the M–H plot of 11 when the ﬁeld is less than 30 kOe. This behaviour indicates a system with ferromagnetic interaction.14 Fig. 15 Field-dependent magnetization of 11 at 2 K. Solid line: the simulated Brillouin function with S = 1. Hysteresis loop of 11 was also observed at 1.8 K (Fig. 16). Small coercive ﬁeld (10 kOe) was observed from the magniﬁed curve, which indicates an irreversible effect below the Curie temperature. It should be noted that the “step” in the origin region of the hysteresis loop is caused by the inter-chain magnetic interaction,20 which could be estimated from eqn (8):21 gbHcS = 2|zJ¢|S2 (8) where Hc is the critical ﬁeld that can be obtained from the maximum (2.2 kOe) of dM/dH plot. The obtained value of |zJ¢| is 0.17 K. Assuming z = 2, one gets |J¢| = 0.085 K. Fig. 16 Hysteresis loop of 11 at 1.8 K. Inset: the magniﬁed region in the ﬁeld range of ± 0.1 kOe (up) and the dM/dH plot (right). After obtaining the |J¢| value, we can use it to estimate the T c value by eqn (9):22 kBT C = 4S(S + 1)|JJ¢|1/2 (9) giving T c = 2.8 K, which is in excellent agreement with the maximum of the cT plot at 2.6 K. The occurrence of long- range magnetic ordering behaviour of 11 would be attributed to the extensive hydrogen bonding interactions between the NiII- carboxylate chains. Conclusions In summary, we have successfully isolated nine new compounds via the in situ metal–ligand hydrothermal reaction of benzene- 1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid. The results show that the decarboxylate reaction requires a high temperature and basic condition rather than the participation of CuII ions, while the hydroxylation requires CuII ions as the oxidant. The resultant products show versatile structures and magnetic properties due to the ﬂexibility of the carboxylate ligands. Although the similar syn–anti carboxylates bridge the CoII (10) and NiII (11) ions, the magnetic interactions can be antiferro or ferromagnetic. Moreover, even the metal–carboxylate chains are assembled into high-dimensional network, the CoII compound (10) does not undergo 3D long-range magnetic order, while the NiII compound (11) does. These results may indicate the “poly- merization” method7b,10 is feasible in assembling low-dimensional magnets, but hydrogen bonding interactions between the chains should be largely avoided.

Data collection and structural reﬁnement parameters are given in Table 2 and selected bond distances and angles are given in Table 3. Magnetic measurements Magnetic susceptibility measurements have been carried out on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 SQUID magnetometer between 1.8–300 K and ±70 KOe. Diamagnetic correction was calculated from Pascal constants and applied to the observed magnetic susceptibilities.
