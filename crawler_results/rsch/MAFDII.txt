Longb and Guang-Shan Zhu*a Received 20th April 2010, Accepted 17th September 2010 DOI: 10.1039/c0cc01031f A novel 3D metal–organic framework (MOF) with 2D rhombic channels was synthesized for selective adsorption of p-xylene from xylene isomers by acting as a molecular sieve. As the initial raw materials, xylene isomers are widely used in the ﬁeld of the chemical industry. p-xylene (pX), one of the xylene isomers, is required for the manufacture of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) which can be further utilized to make polyester ﬁber, resin, ﬁlm and blown beverage bottles. Because of such great economic worth, a great deal of pX is produced every year. However, due to the closely matched boiling points (138 1C–144 1C), separation of xylenes by distillation is almost infeasible. Up to now, two methods have been used to separate xylene isomers: crystallization and adsorption. Compared to crystallization, adsorption which has high eﬃciency is gaining broader acceptance in separation of xylenes. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), as a new class of porous materials, receive much attention for their potential practical applications; such applications being considered include optoelectronic properties, luminescence, magnetism, sensing, catalysis.1–14 Recently, adsorption of MOFs has been performed with a number of small molecules.15–19 However, as far as we know, studies on the selective adsorption and separation of small molecules are few,20–26 especially those on xylene isomers are quite rare.27–32 Based on the above issues, here we report a novel three- dimensional ﬂexible open microporous MOF (JUC-77) with 2D rhombus-shaped channels. The sorptions of benzene, toluene and three xylene isomers have been measured. The isotherms indicate that JUC-77 has potential capability for separating pX from the other two xylene isomers, acting as a molecular sieve because the size of channels in JUC-77 is between the sizes of pX and those of the other two xylene isomers. To the best of our knowledge, separation capabilities of porous MOFs reported in the literature are mainly due to the interaction between adsorbate and channel of material, and material such as JUC-77 which has potential capability of exploiting a molecular sieving process for separating pX from xylene isomers has not been reported. JUC-77DMF ([In(OH)(OBA)]DMF; H2OBA = 4,40- oxybis(benzoic acid)) was synthesized under mild conditions. The structure was determined by single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction at 298 K,z and molecular guest (DMF) was determined by TGA and FT-IR (Fig. S2 and S4). As shown in Fig. 1a, InIII is coordinated with six oxygen atoms, four of them at the equatorial sites are from four diﬀerent OBA2 ligands and the other two oxygen atoms from the m2-OH groups are at the axial position. Hexacoordinated InIII share axial m2-OH groups with each other to form inﬁnite   In–OH–In–OH   zigzag chains. The +C8–O3–C7 of OBA ligand is 119.91 and the two aromatic rings of OBA are tilted with an angle of 66.51, which are similar to the results reported33 (Fig. 1b). Because of such geometry of OBA2 ligand, the zigzag chains are linked perpendicularly with each other by OBA2 ligand to form a 3D structure (Fig. 1c). Meanwhile two groups of the perpendicular and disconnected 1D channels are formed along [110] and [1-10] directions. The fully desolvated JUC-77 (see ESI) used for sorption is veriﬁed by TGA, IR and PXRD (Fig. S3–5). The N2 sorption measurements of JUC-77 at 77 K indicate a reversible type-I isotherm. (Fig. 2) The Langmuir and the BET surface area are 1066 m2 g1 and 976 m2 g1, respectively.

Commun., 2010, 46, 8612–8614 8613 indicates that the diagonal sizes of the rhombic pores in JUC-77 are 10.8  7.3 A˚ 2, consistent with the X-ray analysis. To study the sorption and preferential adsorption capability of JUC-77, benzene, toluene, pX, m-xylene (mX), o-xylene (oX) were chosen as probes by considering that the dimensions of the adsorptive molecules are close to that of the channel (Table 1). Whether the adsorbate can enter into a pore is determined by the size and the shape of not only the adsorbate, but also the channel. Xylenes can be seen as cuboids, and the shape of JUC-77’s channel is rhombic (See ESI, Scheme S1). Whether the organic molecule can be adsorbed by JUC-77 is decided by whether the rectangle formed by MIN-1 and MIN-2 of the molecule can go through the rhombic channel perpendicularly or not. The rectangles formed by MIN-1 and MIN-2 of benzene, toluene and pX can enter into the rhombic channel easily, but those of oX and mX can’t. These assumptions are also conﬁrmed by the simulation in MS software.35 (Fig. 3) Based on the results of the simulations, it’s suggested that JUC-77 has a capability of preferential adsorption for pX. The sorption behavior of the benzene features a reversible type-I isotherm (Fig. 4), it reaches saturation at about P/P0 = 0.11. And the sorption isotherm of pX is very diﬀerent from that of benzene. The little loading and low slope indicate that pX can’t enter the channel easily in the range of P/P0 o 0.4, because JUC-77 is in the form of NP (narrow pore)36 at the beginning (Fig. S5), and transforms into LP (large pore) form slowly when the pressure is increased. In the 0.4 o P/P0 o 0.6 region, the LP form becomes preponderant, then pX molecules enter the channel easily, so the slope of the sorption isotherm becomes abrupt, and the uptake increases rapidly. It reaches saturation after P/P0 = 0.6. On the other hand, as the same as our analysis above, adsorption of mX, oX features typical type-III isotherms shown in Fig. 4, which means mX and oX are not allowed to get into the channel. These results imply that JUC-77 has potential capability for separating pX from xylenes by acting as a molecular sieve. In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized a novel 3D ﬂexible framework, JUC-77, with permanent 2D rhombic channels. The results of adsorption indicate that JUC-77 has potential capability for separating pX from xylene isomers by acting as a molecular sieve.

The other chemicals and solvents used without further purification. The elemental analyses were carried out on a PerkinElmer 240C element analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected on Scintag X1 diffractometer with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5418Å) at 40kV, 35mA. Fourier-Transform infrared spectra were obtained with a Nicolet Impact 410 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr disks dispersed with sample powders in the 4000–400 cm-1 range. A Perkin-Elmer TGA 7 thermogravimetric analyzer was used to obtain thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve in air with a heating rate of 10ºC/min. Preparation of JUC-77•DMF ([In(OH)(OBA)]•DMF): H2OBA (4,4’-Oxybis(benzoic acid) ) (0.043 g, 0.17 mmol) and In(NO3)3 (0.01 g, 0.03 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (7 mL), and then 2-methyl-1-butanol (2 mL) and HNO3 (2M 0.55 mL) were added into the mixture. After stirring a little time, placed in a glass bottle and then heated at 85ºC for 72h，yield yellowy or colorless block crystals, which were filtered, and dried under the vacuum. Yield: 67% based on the In(NO3)3, IR (KBr pellet, cm-1): 1664 (C=O (DMF)), 1598 (C=C (aromatic)), 1238 (C-O-C (OBA-2)), 698 (p-disubstituted aromatic). elemental analysis calcd (%) for InC17H15NO7 (460.11): C 44.34%, H 3.26%, N 3.04%; found: C 44.63% H 3.52% N 3.37%. The DMF molecular was determined by TGA and FT-IR (see Fig.S2, S4) Preparation of JUC-77 ( [In(OH)(OBA)]): JUC-77·DMF was immersed in dried-methanol for 14h to remove the guest molecular-DMF. To make sure the DMF being exchanged by methanol completely, the compound was treated as above for five times. And then heated at 90oC under vacuum for 12h.

Crystallography data: Yellowy or colorless, block-shaped crystal of InC14H9O6 (JUC-77 M = 388.03) was selected for X-ray structural analysis on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer at 298 Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 K. The complex crystallized in the space group Fddd (No.70), orthorhombic, a=19.2396(9), b=20.3017(9), c=46.143(2) Å, V= 18023.4(14) Å3, Z=32, λ=0.71073 Å, ρcalcd = 1.144 Mg/m3. A total of 28635 reflections were collected, of which 5280 were unique (Rint = 0.0588). Final GooF = 1.000, R1 = 0.0698, wR2 = 0.2191. The structure was solved and refined by full matrix least-squares on F2 values (SHELXL-97).[1] Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were fixed at calculated positions and refined using a riding mode. The routine SQUEEZE was applied to the structures in order to remove diffuseelectron density associated with badly disordered DMF molecules.[2] Low-pressure gas and vapor sorption measurements: The gas and vapor sorption-desorption experiments were performed by using Belsorp-max. The sample was treated at 90 ºC under vaccum for 12h before the measurement. N2 used was of 99.999% purity, and the liquid such as benzene, toluene, m-, o-, p-xylene were dried with CaH2. All the vapor sorption-desorption isotherms were measured at 298 K. Surface area was determined from the N2 gas isotherm measured at 77 K. Before each vapor sorption measurement, the sample was treated as mentioned above to make sure the channel open. And the weight of the sample was measured again precisely. And then the N2 sorption was performed to prove that the channel was empty and the sample was not decomposed. High-pressure H2 and CH4 gas sorption measurements: The high-pressure H2 sorption isotherm of JUC-77 was measured at 77 K using the RUBOTHERM magnetic suspension balance (Ankersmid B.V., Netherlands). in the range of 0 - 50 bar for H2. Before the H2 sorption measurements, the sample JUC-77 was heated at 70 ºC under vacuum for 12h. The sample density was determined from He isotherm measured at 77 K. And the CH4 sorption isotherm of JUC-77 was measured at 298 K in the range of 0 - 70 bar, the sample was treated in the same way that for H2 sorption. The sample density was determined from He isotherm measured at 298 K. The amount the uptake is 2.37 wt% and 6.63 wt% respectively.
