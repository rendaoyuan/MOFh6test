Such concomitant solvatochromic and solvatomagnetic effects are scarcely observed and are signiﬁcantly due to the coexistence of differently distorted metal coordination spheres and the cleavage/generation of the weak coordination bond. Introduction The reversible single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) transform- ations involving rearrangement or dynamic movement of mole- cular components in the crystals to generate remarkably dual magneto-optical, ferroelectric–ferromagnetic, and magneto- porous changes are currently challenging topics in magneto- optical devices, multiferroic materials, and porous magnets.1–3 In particular, the SCSC phenomena accompanied by visible colour change are more easily identiﬁed than those appearance- inert interconversions that could be currently characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography.4–15 Moreover, their crystal- line structure and related magnetic behavior can be well con- nected by the apparent colour indicator, which makes them more practical and applicable as magneto-optical devices.3 Transparently crystalline entities assembled from an inorganic CoII source and organic bridging linkers have hopefully endowed promising magneto-optical coordination networks with strong susceptibility and adaptability to external perturbations. The CoII spin carrier with strong single-ion anisotropy can adopt variable coordination numbers in response to different binding groups, with diversely stable coordination spheres (such as tetra- hedral, square-pyramidal, trigonal-bipyramidal, and octahedral geometries), which can potentially induce variations in crystal colour and magnetic exchange couplings.16–19 Suitable organic bridging connectors with two or more tunable binding groups and favourable tether length can further enhance these modiﬁ- cations on the dimensionality and magnetism through the change of the connection mode and binding angle.5,10,19 Keeping these important points in minds, a combination of the mixed ligands, 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole (Hdatrz) and 3,5-dicarboxybenzene- sulfonic acid monosodium salt (NaH2sip), were selected to assemble with paramagnetic CoII ion under controllable con- ditions. Apparently, in addition to introducing the magnetically active Hdatrz bridge and CoII center, particular interest was focused on the NaH2sip ligand because of the different binding ability by sulfonate and carboxylate groups and the suitable size of the phenyl tether. As a result, a reversible CoII 6 subunit-based SCSC transformation from a blue metamagnetic framework to a pink antiferromagnetic ordering coordination layer was readily obtained by solvent exchange. The scarcely observed solvato- chromic and solvatomagnetic effects involved in the transform- ation are structurally due to the coexistence of differently distorted metal coordination spheres and the cleavage/generation of a weak coordination bond. Experimental Materials and instruments All chemicals were commercially purchased (3,5-diamino-1,2,4- triazole and 3,5-dicarboxybenzenesulfonic acid monosodium salt were from Acros and other analytical-grade reagents were from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Factory) and used as received without further puriﬁcation.

The simu- lated PXRD patterns were calculated using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data and processed by the free Mercury v1.4 program provided by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were carried out with a CE-440 (Leeman-Labs) analyzer. Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra (KBr pellets) were taken on an Avatar-370 (Nicolet) spectrometer in the range 4000–400 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were performed on a Shimadzu sim- ultaneous DTG-60A compositional analysis instrument from room temperature to 800 °C in a N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Magnetic susceptibilities were acquired on a Quantum Design (SQUID) magnetometer MPMS-XL-7 with polycrystalline samples, in which the phase purity of the samples was determined by PXRD experiments. The data were corrected for TIP and the diamagnetic corrections were calcu- lated using Pascal’s constants. An experimental correction for the sample holder was also applied. Preparations of 1–2 {[Co3(CH3OH)(μ3-OH)2(datrz)(sip)]·2.25H2O}n (1). A mixture containing Hdatrz (39.6 mg, 0.4 mmol), NaH2sip (53.6 mg, 0.2 mmol), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (87.2 mg, 0.3 mmol), methanol (4.0 mL) and water (6.0 mL) was placed in a Teﬂon-lined stain- less steel vessel (23.0 mL), and the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 5–6 by the slow addition of triethylamine with con- stant stirring. The resulting mixture was then heated at 165 °C for 72 h and cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1. Blue block-shaped single crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray analysis were generated directly and dried in air. Yield: 51% based on CoII salt.

X-Ray crystallography Diffraction intensities for 1 and 2 were collected on a Bruker APEX-II QUAZAR diffractometer equipped with graphite- monochromated Mo Kα radiation with a radiation wavelength of 0.71073 Å by using the φ-ω scan technique at 296 and 173 K, respectively. There was no evidence of crystal decay during data collection. Semiempirical multi-scan absorption corrections were applied by SADABS, and the program SAINT was used for the integration of the diffraction proﬁles.20 The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned with the full-matrix least- squares technique using the SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 programs.21 Non-H atoms were located by difference Fourier maps and subjected to anisotropic reﬁnement. Organic H atoms were added according to the theoretical models. The H atoms of the water molecules except for the splitting water molecules were located from difference maps and reﬁned with isotropic temperature factors. No attempts have been performed to locate the H atoms of the splitting water molecules. Lattice water mol- ecules (O11 and O12 in 1, as well as O13 and O15 in 2) were positionally disordered with occupations that reﬁned to 0.82 and 0.18 for O11 and O11′, 0.5 for O12, 0.75 and 0.25 for O13 and O13′ and 0.125 for O15. The crystallographic data and the selected bond lengths and angles are given in Tables 1–3, respectively. Results and discussion Syntheses Blue block-shaped crystals of 1, {[Co3(CH3OH)(μ3-OH)2(datrz)- (sip)]·2.25H2O}n, were easily prepared by solvothermal reaction of Hdatrz, NaH2sip and hydrated Co(NO3)2 with a molar ratio of 4 : 2 : 3 in mixed CH3OH–H2O medium. Crystalline 1 can be hydrated in water, transforming to pink block-shaped crystals of 2. Also, conversely, sample 2 can be reverted to crystalline 1 in methanol in four hours, accompanying a return of the original colour (Fig. 1). Such solvatochromic behavior has been repeat- edly observed several times, and the framework structures of 1, 2 and regenerated 1 were evidenced by single-crystal and powder X-ray diffractions (Fig. S1, ESI†).

A comparison of the powder patterns calculated from single-crystal data and the experimental X-ray powder dif- fraction pattern obtained at room temperature conﬁrms the struc- tural consistency and phase purity of the bulk products for 1–2 (Fig. S1, ESI†). Crystal structures of 1–2 {[Co3(CH3OH)(μ3-OH)2(datrz)(sip)]·2.25H2O}n (1). Complex 1 is a 3D robust framework with centrosymmetric [Co6(μ3- OH)4(datrz)2]6+ ribbons extended by tritopic sip3−linkers. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains three crystallographically indepen- dent CoII ions, a pair of μ3-OH groups, one anionic datrz− ligand, one triply deprotonated sip3−anion, one terminally co- ordinated methanol and 2.25 lattice water molecules. As shown in Fig. 1a, two different coordination spheres with distorted octa- hedrons for the Co1 and Co2 sites and an irregular tetrahedron for the Co3 ion are observed. The O5N donors of Co1 are formed by one methanol terminus, two μ3-OH groups, two deprotonated carboxylate groups from two separate sip3−ligands and one triazolyl group from an anionic datrz−ligand. The octa- hedrally coordinated Co2 ion is in an O4N2 donor set fulﬁlled by three μ3-OH groups, one bidentate bridging carboxylate O atom of a sip3−ligand and two N donors from triazolyl and exocyclic amino groups of two individual datrz−ligands. In contrast, the tetrahedral Co3 is surrounded by one triazolyl N atom from a datrz−anion and three O donors belonging to μ3-OH, a mono- dentate sulfonate group and the bidentate bridging carboxylate group of two individual sip3−ligands (Fig. S3, ESI†). The separ- ations of Co–O and Co–N fall in the normal range (Table 2).22 The mixed Oh–Oh–Td geometries of the CoII ions make 1 blue.16,17 Two pairs of centrosymmetric μ3-OH groups aggregate six CoII ions into a cationic [Co6(μ3-OH)4]8+ core containing four edge-sharing triangles, which is periodically extended by pairs of μ4-datrz−ligands to generate an inﬁnite one-dimensional (1D) ribbon (Fig. 1b). These separate ribbons are further propagated by three-branched μ5-sip3−ligands to lead to an overall three- dimensional (3D) coordination framework of 1 with the inter- ribbon distances of ca. 13.06, 13.48, and 15.50 Å, respectively (Fig. 1c). {[Co3(H2O)3(μ3-OH)2(datrz)(sip)]·2.125H2O}n (2). Complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/c space group, exhibiting a two-dimensional (2D) coordination layer constructed from cen- trosymmetric [Co6(μ3-OH)4(datrz)2]6+ ribbons, analogous to 1, and ditopic μ4-sip3−ligands. In addition to containing different numbers of free water molecules, signiﬁcant changes (local coordination environments of octahedral Co1, coordination poly- hedron of Co3, as well as the binding mode of the sip3−ligand) can also be found between 1 and 2 (Fig. 1). Upon hydration, the terminal methanol, one μ3-OH group and one carboxylate group around the octahedral Co1 of 1 are replaced by three aqua ligands in 2. The tetrahedral Co3 in 1 becomes pentacoordinated Table 2 Selected bond lengths (Å) and angles (°) for 1a Co(1)–N(2)#1 2.045(3) Co(1)–O(9) 2.103(2) Co(1)–O(10) 2.102(3) Co(1)–O(8) 2.108(3) Co(1)–O(3)#2 2.144(3) Co(1)–O(2)#3 2.158(3) Co(2)–O(9)#4 2.086(2) Co(2)–O(9) 2.111(3) Co(2)–O(1)#3 2.128(2) Co(2)–N(1)#5 2.135(3) Co(2)–O(8) 2.148(2) Co(2)–N(5) 2.321(3) Co(3)–O(8) 1.929(2) Co(3)–O(4)#2 1.949(2) Co(3)–N(3) 2.007(3) Co(3)–O(6) 2.040(3) N(2)#1–Co(1)–O(9) 91.68(11) N(2)#1–Co(1)–O(10) 101.57(14) O(9)–Co(1)–O(10) 89.92(12) N(2)#1–Co(1)–O(8) 95.54(11) O(9)–Co(1)–O(8) 79.69(9) O(10)–Co(1)–O(8) 160.25(13) N(2)#1–Co(1)–O(3)#2 90.00(11) O(9)–Co(1)–O(3)#2 177.29(11) O(10)–Co(1)–O(3)#2 87.66(12) O(8)–Co(1)–O(3)#2 102.26(10) N(2)#1–Co(1)–O(2)#3 166.37(12) O(9)–Co(1)–O(2)#3 99.98(10) O(10)–Co(1)–O(2)#3 85.59(12) O(8)–Co(1)–O(2)#3 79.80(10) O(3)#2–Co(1)–O(2)#3 78.62(10) O(9)#4–Co(2)–O(9) 81.90(10) O(9)#4–Co(2)–O(1)#3 166.95(11) O(9)–Co(2)–O(1)#3 87.74(10) O(9)#4–Co(2)–N(1)#5 90.51(10) O(9)–Co(2)–N(1)#5 113.72(11) O(1)#3–Co(2)–N(1)#5 86.39(10) O(9)#4–Co(2)–O(8) 88.82(10) O(9)–Co(2)–O(8) 78.62(10) O(1)#3–Co(2)–O(8) 96. 93(9) N(1)#5–Co(2)–O(8) 167.42(11) O(9)#4–Co(2)–N(5) 104.44(10) O(9)–Co(2)–N(5) 161.74(10) O(1)#3–Co(2)–N(5) 87.83(10) N(1)#5–Co(2)–N(5) 83.65(11) O(8)–Co(2)–N(5) 84.35(10) O(8)–Co(3)–O(4)#2 120.82(11) O(8)–Co(3)–N(3) 108.34(11) O(4)#2–Co(3)–N(3) 119.51(12) O(8)–Co(3)–O(6) 101.65(12) O(4)#2–Co(3)–O(6) 93.37(12) N(3)–Co(3)–O(6) 109.72(13) a Symmetry codes: #1 x, y + 1, z; #2 1/2 −x, 2/3 −y, 2 −z; #3 x, 1 −y, 1/2 + z; #4 −x, 2 −y, 2 −z; #5 −x, 1 −y, 2 −z.

This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Dalton Trans., 2012, 41, 6827–6832 | 6829 Downloaded by University of Guelph on 17 May 2012 Published on 27 April 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C2DT30245D View Online in a square-pyramidal geometry in 2, which is surrounded by one heterocyclic N atom of a datrz−anion, a pair of μ3-OH groups and two carboxylate O donors of the sip3−ligands (Fig. S4, ESI†). The bond lengths of Co–O and Co–N in 2 are comparable to those in 1 (see Table 3). Additionally, the binding sulfonate group of sip3−in 1 is free in 2, which essentially decreases the dimensionality of 2. Herein, the increased coordi- nation number of Co3 in 2, together with the slight alteration of the metal coordination environments of Co1, signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the crystal colour and magnetic superexchange interactions.16–19 The connectivity of μ3-OH groups and CoII ions in 2 also generates an inﬁnite [Co6(μ3-OH)4(datrz)2]6+ ribbon similar to 1 (Fig. 1b). Differently, the 1D ribbon of 2 is only propagated by a ditopic μ4-sip3−ligand, to lead to a 2D coordination layer with a comparable inter-ribbon distance to 1 (Fig. 1c), which is further H-bonded together into the 3D supra- molecular network of 2 (Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†). Apparently, the reversible interconversion between 1 and 2 involves the changes in crystal colour, space group, cell par- ameters, dimensionality and molecular stacking fashions. Magnetic properties As the solid structures change drastically, signiﬁcant modulations in the magnetic properties are expected. The χMT value per CoII 6 unit of 1 is 16.47 cm3 K mol−1 at 300 K (Fig. 2a), larger than the expected 11.25 cm3 K mol−1 for six magnetically uncoupled CoII ions with different coordination polyhedrons due to the sig- niﬁcant orbital contribution of anisotropic spin carriers. Upon cooling, the χMT product decreases to a local minimum (7.21 cm3 K mol−1) at 18 K. Then it rises rapidly to a sharp maximum of 35.91 cm3 K mol−1 at 5 K, and ﬁnally drops due to the saturation effect and/or inter-ribbon antiferromagnetic inter- actions. Notably, the abrupt increase of χMT at low temperature indicates an onset of a spontaneous magnetization state resulting from the strong exchange coupling throughout the lattice. Herein, the considerable difference in the anisotropy of the dis- torted Oh and Td CoII ions as well as the possible spin-canting essentially generates an uncompensated magnetic moment in the CoII 6 unit of 1 for the remnant magnetization,18 which is remark- ably ﬁeld-dependent between 2.0 and 0.6 kOe (Fig. 2a inset). More interestingly, the χM vs. T curves display a sharp maximum around 5.3 K under the ﬁeld lower than 0.6 kOe, suggesting an antiferromagnetic ordering of 1 at low external ﬁeld. Moreover, the maximum value of χM moves towards high temperature with the decreasing ﬁeld and becomes more prominent. The distinctly ﬁeld-dependent magnetic phenomenon reveals a metamagnetic transition of 1 from a weak spontaneous magnetization state to an antiferromagnetic ordering, which is further conﬁrmed by the ZFC and FC experiments with a divergence point at 4.3 K (TN) Fig. 1 (a) The appearance and local coordination environments of the CoII ions in 1 and 2 (H atoms and phenyl moiety of the sip3−ligand were omitted for clarity, symmetry codes for 1: A = x, 1 + y, z; B = 0.5 −x, 1.5 −y, 2 −z; C = x, 1 −y, 0.5 + z; D = −x, 2 −y, 2 −z; E = −x, 1 −y, 2 −z; for 2: A = 1 −x, y −0.5, 1.5 −z; B = 1 + x, 1.5 −y, 0.5 + z; C = 1 + x, 2.5 −y, 0.5 + z).

The isothermal magnetization of 1 at 2 K shows a pronounced sigmoid character of metamagnetism (Fig. 3a). Initially, the mag- netization linearly increases with the increasing ﬁeld (H < 0.6 kOe), consistent with an antiferromagnetic ordering. Then, it shows a sharp jump corresponding to a weak spontaneous mag- netization between 0.6 and 1.4 kOe, meaning the antiparallel- arranged net-moment from the adjacent 1D ribbons of 1 is reversed. Finally, a slowly linear M vs. H relationship is achieved above 1.4 kOe. The magnetization value (4.15 Nβ) at the highest ﬁeld (50 kOe) is far below the saturation value of a CoII 6 unit (15.6 Nβ), suggesting the dominant antiferromagnetic inter- actions between the different CoII ions. A magnetic hysteresis loop is observed at 2 K with a coercive ﬁeld of 0.08 kOe and a remnant magnetization of 0.44 Nβ for one CoII 6 unit (Fig. S6, ESI†), behaving as a soft magnet. The metamagnetism of 1 can be rationalized as a result of the competition between the non- zero magnetic moment in the ribbon and the external magnetic ﬁeld. Once the external ﬁeld is larger than 0.7 kOe determined by dM/dH (Fig. S7, ESI†), the antiferromagnetic stacking of these ribbons by the phenyl tether is overcome, turning the antiferromagnetic ordering state into a weak spontaneous magnetization state. The nature of the spontaneous magnetization of 1 was further characterized by ac susceptibility (Fig. 3b). The frequency- dependent behavior is apparently observed from 3 to 6 K. The relaxation time obtained from the Arrhenius law is τo = 8.4 × 10−18 s and ΔE/kB = 112 K. The shift of peak temperature (TP) of χ′′ was measured by a parameter ϕ = ΔTP/[TPΔ(log f)] = 0.043, being in the range of spin glass.23 The χMT value per CoII 6 unit of 2 at 300 K (16.92 cm3 K mol−1) is slightly larger than that of 1 (Fig. 2a) due to the replacement of a pair of tetrahedral CoII spins by distorted square-pyramidal CoII ions with stronger single-ion anisotropy.19 The χMT product decays monotonically with the decreasing temperature and reaches a minimum (0.41 cm3 K mol−1) at 2 K. The appearance of a round peak in the χM vs. T curve indicates an antiferromagnetic ordering. The frequency-independent ac susceptibility exhibits a maximum at 5.3 K (TN) for the χ′ part and a negligibly small value for the χ′′ component (Fig. S8, ESI†). The magnetization of 2 at 2 K increases almost linearly with the magnetic ﬁeld, implying the complete magnetic moment compensation in the antiferromagnetic coupled CoII 6 unit of 2. Also, the magnetization at 50 kOe (1.81 Nβ) is far from the saturation value (15.6 Nβ) for six CoII ions (Fig. 3a). These magnetic behaviors of 2 are in good agreement with the typical antiferromagnet. Thus, the different net magnetic Fig. 2 (a) χMT vs. T plots for 1 and 2 under 2 kOe (inset: temperature-dependence of the ﬁeld-cooled magnetic susceptibility of 1 at various mag- netic ﬁelds (upper left) and the χM vs. T plot for 2 (lower right)).

Conclusion In summary, concomitant solvatochromic and solvatomagnetic effects induce a reversible SCSC transformation from a blue metamagnetic framework to a pink antiferromagnetic ordering coordination layer. Such switchable control over the solid struc- ture, crystal colour, and magnetism signiﬁcantly results from the coexistence of differently distorted metal coordination spheres and the cleavage/generation of the weak coordination bond.
