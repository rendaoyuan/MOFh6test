X-ray single-crystal analyses show that polymers 1–6 have rich structural chemistry ranging from one- dimensional (1), two-dimensional (3) to three-dimensional polymers (2, 4, 5 and 6). In these polymers, the p-MePhH3IDC ligand shows ﬂexible coordination modes tuned by diﬀerent synthetical conditions, including the addition of coligands, temperature, pH value and so on. Furthermore, the polymers have been investigated by solid-state ultraviolet spectra and thermogravimetric analyses. Introduction The investigation and preparation of coordination polymers (CPs) has received considerable attention in the past three decades, not only for their charming crystal structures1 and variety of topologies,2 but also for their potential applications in chemical and biological sensing, chirality, ion exchange, fluorescent materials, gas separation and storage, catalysis and magnetism.3 To prepare various polymeric frameworks, two kinds of well-established methods (hydrothermal and solvother- mal methods) have been used in order to carry out these reac- tions under high temperatures, which favor the formation of crystalline products suitable for X-ray studies. Although a great number of CPs have been obtained by hydro(solvo)thermal methods,4 we still cannot approach a level of design control whereby a particular type of structure can be predictably obtained because of the factors governing the reactions and the formation of the products being complicated, such as the multifunctional chelating and bridging ligands,6 kinds of metal salt, the solvent system, pH value, the metal-to-ligand ratio and so on.5–7 Therefore, many more coordination poly- mers need to be prepared under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions. By doing so, we may get more useful information about the target synthesis in the field of CPs. On the other hand, the key to obtaining the desired CPs is the design and selection of an ideal organic ligand, which bears multi-coordination sites and has a strong coordination ability. In this context, a number of fascinating structures have been projected with imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (H3IDC) and its 2-position substituted derivatives.8 The syntheses of new N- and O-donor ligands is a long-standing driving force for chemists, so our group is interested in preparing 2-position phenyl imidazole dicarboxylate ligands.9 For example, the 2- (p-methylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (p-MePhH3- IDC) ligand displays an absorbing coordination feature for joining Sr(II), Cd(II) and Co(II) ions.9k However, no other metal ions were utilized to assemble with p-MePhH3IDC. From our previous report,9k we know that p-MePhH3IDC has the follow- ing coordination characteristics: (i) it has shown three kinds of coordination modes; (ii) one imidazole-H and two COO-H hydrogen atoms could be selectively deprotonated; (iii) it can assemble fascinating structures in the presence of bridging or chelating coligands. As an extension of our studies, these con- siderations inspired us to explore more novel structures with the p-MePhH3IDC ligand. In this paper, we investigated the reactions of p-MePhH3- IDC with transition metals, namely Pb(II), Cd(II) and Mn(II), under solvothermal conditions. In this way, we obtained six CPs, [Pb2(p-MePhHIDC)(p-MePhH2IDC)2(phen)2]n (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) (1), [Pb(p-MePhH2IDC)2]n (2), [Cd3(p- MePhHIDC)2(p-MePhH2IDC)2(H2O)2]n (3), {[Cd(p-MePhHIDC)- †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: The X-ray crystallo- graphic files in CIF format.

Crystal structure determinations The crystal data and experimental details for the polymers are contained in Table 1. Measurements were made on a Bruker smart APEXII CCD diﬀractometer with graphite-monochro- mated Mo–Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Single crystals of 1–6 were selected and mounted on a glass fiber. All data were col- lected at room temperature, using the ω–2θ scan technique Paper Dalton Transactions Dalton Trans. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Published on 31 July 2013.

The six structures were solved by direct methods and expanded using the Fourier technique. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. Hydrogen atoms were included but not refined. All calcu- lations were performed using the SHELX-97 crystallographic software package.11 Selected bond lengths and angles for the polymers are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). It should be noted that the formula of compound 5 is confirmed by elemental and thermal analyses. That is to say, although the solvent water molecules are squeezed in the refinement process of the crystal data of 5, the free water molecules can be determined by other methods, such as elemental and thermal analyses. Results and discussion Geometry of the free ligand and synthesis Previously, we have obtained useful information of the p-methylphenyl substituent eﬀect in the p-MePhH3IDC ligand by theoretical calculations and realized the strong coordination ability of the N and O atoms overrides the steric eﬀect of the p-methylphenyl unit.9k It should be pointed out that the p-MePhH3IDC ligand in this work also shows flexible coordi- nation modes (Scheme 1). It is interesting to compare the coordination modes of the p-MePhH3−nIDCn−species in the polymers. In polymers 1, 3 and 6, the imidazole ligand can release one or two protons leading to p-MePhH3−nIDCn−(n = 1 or 2) anions. In 2, it can lose one proton forming the p-MePh- H2IDC−anion. In 4 and 5, it can release two protons, resulting in the p-MePhHIDC2−anion. As shown in Scheme 1, five kinds of coordination modes are newly shown in polymers 1–6, which further confirms the versatile coordination ability of p-MePhH3IDC. It is noteworthy that the stoichiometry of the starting materials, temperature and introduction of coligands are three important factors for the formation of polymers 1–6. Crystals of 1–6 can be successfully produced in the metal-to-ligand mole ratio of 1 : 1, while other stoichiometries have given pro- ducts with a very low yield or obtained some precipitate.

View Article Online reagents (Et3N or NaOH), diﬀerent structures of 3 (2D) and 4 (3D) were produced. When the coligand phen, which is a highly chelating N-containing ligand, was introduced into our solvothermal reaction system, the 1D chain polymer 1 can be obtained. Under the same reaction conditions, without the addition of phen, 3D polymer 2 with hexagons is obtained. When we added the bridging coligand 4,4′-bipy to the reaction system of Cd(II) or Mn(II) ions, two three-dimensional Cd(II) and Mn(II) polymers 5 and 6 can be obtained. Obviously, the auxiliary ligands have a significant influence on the structural formation. During the reactions, the pH values of the solution before and after the reaction are ca. 8 and 6, respectively. Polymers 1, 2, 3 and 5 were produced through Et3N adjusting the pH value, while NaOH can also be used to adjust the pH level of the system in the polymers 4 and 6. When polymers 4 and 6 were produced with Et3N adjusting the pH value, only some precipi- tate was obtained. Summarily, a series of coordination com- plexes are achieved through appropriate synthetic conditions, such as metal/ligand molar ratio, solvent, temperature, co- ligand, etc., and the reproducibility of our experiments is good. Crystal structures of polymers [Pb2(p-MePhHIDC)- (p-MePhH2IDC)2(phen)2]n (1) and [Pb(p-MePhH2IDC)2]n (2). Polymers 1 and 2 are achieved through the reactions of p-MePhH3IDC with Pb(NO3)2 under similar solvothermal reac- tions, but they show diﬀerent structures. Polymer 1 is a 1D ladder-shaped chain due to the existence of 1,10-phenanthro- line, while polymer 2 reveals a charming 3D framework without the coligand, phen. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that the asymmetric unit consists of two Pb(II) atoms, one μ2-p-MePhHIDC2−anion, two μ2-p-MePhH2IDC−anions and two phen units. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), each Pb(II) atom is six-coordinated by three O atoms from one μ2-p-MePhHIDC2−and two μ2-p-MePhH2IDC− ligands, three N atoms from one phen unit and one μ2-p- MePhHIDC2−ligand, displaying a distorted octahedral geome- try. Obviously, the phen group acts as a bidentate ligand to coordinate to the central Pb(II) atom. The Pb–N distances are 2.470(4) Å and 2.672(4) Å, respectively, while the Pb–O bond lengths range from 2.565(4) to 2.636(3) Å. The bond angles around the central Pb(II) ion vary from 62.18(13) to 157.46(15)°. The imidazole dicarboxylate ligands in 1 present two kinds of coordinate modes, μ2-kN, O: kN′, O′ (Scheme 1a) and μ2-kO: kO′ (Scheme 1b). As shown in Fig. 1a, the Pb(II) atoms and MePhH2IDC−anions are joined to each other to form an in- finite ladder-shaped chain, in which there are countless grids with dimensions of 9.0625(5) Å × 7.1323 Å, and the phen ligands alternately hang outside the chain. Along the “legs of the ladder”, the Pb(II) atoms are linked by the MePhH2IDC− anions in the former coordination mode (Scheme 1a). The “rungs of the ladder” are the MePhH2IDC−anions through the latter coordination mode (Scheme 1b), bridging the “legs”. Furthermore, the chains are connected by intermolecular hydrogen bonds of N–H⋯O (N2–H1⋯O4 2.792(6) Å, 162(4)°) leading to a 2D net structure (Fig. 1b). The asymmetric unit of 2 contains one Pb(II) atom and two μ2-p-MePhH2IDC−anions. Polymer 2 exhibits a 3D motif with left-handed and right-handed helical chains. As illustrated in Fig. S2, ESI† the Pb(II) atom adopts a distorted octahedral geo- metry, where four oxygen atoms come from the carboxylate groups (O2, O2b, O3c and O3d) of four individual μ2-p-MePh- H2IDC−ligands and two nitrogen atoms (N1, N1b) are from two imidazole units of the other two μ2-p-MePhH2IDC− ligands. Furthermore, the Pb(II) ion with O, N chelating donors (N1 and O2, N1b and O2b) shapes two five-membered rings. The Pb–L (L = N or O) distances are in the range of 2.476(3)– 2.695(3) Å and the trans L–Pb–L bond angles range from 64.85(8) to 152.87(8)°. Each μ2-p-MePhH2IDC−anion coordinates to two Pb(II) atoms in the μ2-kN, O: kO′ (Scheme 1c) mode in 2, which is quite diﬀerent from that in 1. Neighboring Pb(II) ions are linked by μ2-p-MePhH2IDC−anions to yield 1D right-handed and 1D left-handed helixes (Fig. 2a). These helical chains are shared with Pb(II) atoms to form a 2D layer (Fig. 2b). It is worth noting that six Pb(II) ions and six μ2-p-MePhH2IDC− anions provide a closed [Pb6(MePhH2IDC)6] hexagonal loop in the layer with the neighboring Pb⋯Pb separation being 9.47976(2) Å. Moreover, these layers are bridged by μ2-p-MePh- H2IDC−anions to aﬀord a 3D architecture (Fig. 2c). To under- stand the complicated crystal structure well, topological analysis of the network is done by the OLEX program. The whole structure of 2 can be simplified to a 2-fold interpenetrat- ing dia array 3D framework with a topological notation of 66 (Fig. 2d).

Polymer 3 exhibits a 2D grid-like struc- ture with 1D double-strand flexuous chains. As illustrated in Fig. S3, ESI† there are two crystallographi- cal Cd(II) atoms in the asymmetric unit. Cd1 is in a slightly dis- torted octahedral coordination geometry, in which the equatorial plane comprises two nitrogen and two carboxylate oxygen atoms (N1, O7; N1a and O7a) from two μ3-p-MePh- HIDC2−ligands and the apical sites are occupied by two oxygen atoms (O5 and O5a) from two μ2-p-MePhH2IDC− ligands. Obviously, the four organic ligands have central sym- metry with the central Cd1 ion. Cd2 shows a distorted octa- hedral CdO4N2 unit, where two N,O-chelating μ3-p-MePhHIDC2− ligands, one water and one monodentate μ3-p-MePhHIDC2− ligand are involved in the coordination. The Cd–L distances are in the range of 2.253(4)–2.488(4) Å and the trans L–Cd–L bond angles range from 70.24(14) to 180.00(14)°. The p-MePhH2IDC−and p-MePhHIDC2−ligands adopt two kinds of coordination modes, μ2-kN, O: kO′ (Scheme 1d) and μ3-kN, O: kN′, O′: kO′ (Scheme 1e), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a, two neighboring Cd(II) ions are bridged by p-MePh- HIDC2−ligands in the μ3-kN, O: kN′, O′: kO′ mode forming a dimeric core. Moreover, the dimeric core is linked by two μ2-p- MePhH2IDC−and two μ3-p-MePhHIDC2−ligands and four single Cd(II) atoms. Consequently, an interesting sheet con- taining many alternate Cd(II) dimeric cores and single Cd(II) atoms is developed. Notably, the intramolecular O–H⋯O (O4⋯O5 2.531(5) Å, O9⋯O2c 2.787(6) Å, O9⋯O7d 2.701(5) Å) hydrogen-bonds supply additional stabilization for the struc- ture. To clearly understand the structure of 3, we adopted diﬀerent colored sticks to replace the two kinds of organic ligands and obtained a schematic drawing (Fig. 3b). Two kinds of rhombus grids with dimensions of 6.6600 Å × 5.3725 Å and 2.4884 Å × 2.2841 Å, respectively, are observed. Fig. 2 (a) The 1D right- and left-handed helical chains of 2.

Diﬀerent from polymer 3, a honeycomb-like 3D framework of 4 is obtained by changing the organic base, Et3N, to the inorganic base, NaOH, and elevating the reaction temperature. Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis reveals that the asymmetric unit of 4 contains four Cd(II) cations, four μ3-p- MePhHIDC2−anions, four coordinated water molecules and one lattice water molecule. Similar to complex 3, each Cd(II) cation is six-coordinated and in a severely distorted octahedral geometry (Fig. S4, ESI†). The central Cd(II) ion is besieged by two O atoms and two N atoms belonging to two independent chelating μ3-p-MePhHIDC2−ligands and another two O atoms from one H2O molecule and one μ3-p-MePhHIDC2−ligand. The Cd–O (2.28 (2)–2.517(11) Å) and Cd–N (2.185(10)–2.240(11) Å) lengths are close to the reported Cd(II) polymers.13 The p-MePhHIDC2−ligand shows the μ3-kN, O: kN′, O′: kO′ (Scheme 1e) coordination mode, as shown in Scheme 1e. The Cd2+ ions are combined by bridging imidazole N atoms and carboxylate groups from the same μ3-p-MePhHIDC2−anions to aﬀord 1D left- and right-handed helical chains (Fig. 4a and 4b). Interestingly, the neighboring helical chains are bridged by the μ3-p-MePhHIDC2−anions to generate a sheet with many quadrilaterals (Fig. 4c). The neighboring layers are further united by Cd–O bonds involving Cd(II) dimers to aﬀord the open 3D architecture (Fig. 4d). The 3D architecture includes the infinite 1D channels, but there is a segmental void space in the structure occupied by free water molecules as guests. The 3D framework of 4 can be described as a 4-connected topo- logy with a 42·84 symbol (Fig. 4d). Crystal structure of polymer {[Cd2(p-MePhHIDC)2(4,4′-bipy)]· 4H2O}n (5). Under similar reaction conditions to complexes 3 and 4, when only the coligand 4,4′-bipy was introduced, a com- plicated 3D framework of 5 was obtained. Polymer 5 possesses two Cd(II) ions, two μ3-p-MePhHIDC2− anions, one 4,4′-bipy unit and four water solvent molecules. As depicted in Fig. S5, ESI† both Cd(II) centers exhibit similar coordination geometries. The Cd(II) atom is located in a dis- torted [CdN3O3] octahedral geometry, which is completed by three oxygen atoms (O1, O1b and O4) and two nitrogen atoms (N2 and N3a) from three individual μ3-p-MePhHIDC2−ligands and another nitrogen atom from one 4,4′-bipy molecule. The adjacent Cd1 and Cd1e ions are bridged through N2 and N3 from the same μ3-p-MePhHIDC2−anion. The Cd–O lengths are in the range of 2.2949(16) to 2.4776(19) Å and those of Cd–N vary from 2.2349(18)–2.338(2) Å. The bond angles around the Cd(II) atom are between 67.91(7) and 170.61(7)°. As for polymers 3 and 4, the p-MePhHIDC2−ligand in 5 adopts the same coordination mode, μ3-kN, O: kN′, O′: kO′ (Scheme 1e), linking the contiguous cadmium atoms to produce a 1D zigzag chain (Fig. 5a). These 1D chains are bound through Cd(II) atoms to expand into a 2D sheet (Fig. 5b). Finally, the adjacent sheets are joined by the μ3-p- MePhHIDC2−anions to build a porous 3D framework (Fig. 5c) with tubular channels.

View Article Online pass through the voids, but the adjacent 4,4′-bipy units are per- pendicular with definite distances. Furthermore, the diagonal dimensions of the channel are 12.1137(20) Å × 12.1137(20) Å. For polymer 5, the Cd(II) atoms can be viewed as 6-connected nodes which are connected to three p-MePhHIDC2−and one μ2-4,4′-bipy ligands. Hence, the overall 3D structure of 5 can be simplified as 6-connected with 4·10·74 topology (Fig. 5d). Although polymers 4 and 5 possess similar structures with a porous 3D framework, the 1D tubular channels are alter- nately occupied by 4,4′-bipy units in 5. Crystal structure of polymer [Mn3(p-MePhHIDC)2(p- MePhH2IDC)2(4,4′-bipy)]n (6). Polymer 6 demonstrates a 3D architecture consisting of stockade sheets. There are three Mn(II) cations, two μ3-p-MePhHIDC2−anions, two μ2-p-MePh- H2IDC−anions and one 4,4′-bipy unit in the unit cell. The central Mn1 shows an octahedral geometry (Fig. S6, ESI†) and is coordinated by two N atoms (N6f and N6e) and four O atoms (O9, O9d, O7 and O7d) from two diﬀerent μ3-p-MePh- HIDC2−ligands and two μ2-p-MePhH2IDC−ligands (Mn1–O: varying from 2.120(2) to 2.235(3) Å; Mn1–N: being 2.223(3) Å) with bond angles ranging from 75.45(10) to 180.00(17)°, which are similar to the reported Mn-compound [Mn(tfbdc)(4,4′-bipy)- (H2O)2] (H2tfbdc = 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalatic acid).14 The Mn2 atom is coordinated by four O atoms of the carboxyl groups (Mn2–O: 2.125(2)–2.203(2) Å) and two N atoms from one μ3-p-MePhHIDC2−ligand and one 4,4′-bipy unit (Mn2–N: 2.261(3)–2.277(3) Å). All the Mn–O and Mn–N bond lengths are within the normal values.14,15 Meanwhile, the neighboring Mn1 and Mn2 ions are bridged by O7, O4 and N2 atoms from the μ3-p-MePhHIDC2−anions (Fig. S6, ESI†). The p-MePhHIDC2− and p-MePhH2IDC− ligands show two types of coordination modes: μ3-kN,O: kO′,O″: kO′′′ (Scheme 1f) and μ2-kN,O: kO′ (Scheme 1c), respectively. Appar- ently, in Fig. 6a, the Mn1 and Mn2 ions are alternately connected by carboxyl groups to generate a stockade sheet with quadrilateral meshes (12.3453(9) × 7.3673(7) Å). Then, the layers are further bridged by 4,4′-bipy units to shape a 3D architecture (Fig. 6b). That is to say, these 4,4′-bipy molecules run through the open gaps between the 2D sheets. To better understand the structure of 6, a topological ana- lysis approach was employed. Mn(II) and p-MePhH3IDC act as 3-connected and 4-connected nodes, respectively, giving rise to a (3,4)-connected 3D network with the Schläfli symbol of (52·62·92)(52·6)(52·6·82·9) (Fig. 6c). Infrared spectra, thermal analyses and solid-state ultraviolet properties The IR spectra display characteristic absorption bands for water molecules, carboxylate, imidazole and phenyl units. The broad absorption bands in the range of 3400–3450 cm−1 and 3000–3200 cm−1 indicate the presence of νN–H and νO–H stretching frequencies of the imidazole rings and coordinated water molecules, respectively. The characteristic IR bands of the phenyl ring are at 840–860 cm−1 due to δvC–H vibrations. The six complexes exhibit strong characteristic absorptions around the frequency range 1557–1600 cm−1 νas(COO−) and 1450–1485 cm−1 νs(COO−), respectively.16 To characterize the stabilities of the frameworks, thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) of 1–6 were carried out in an air atmosphere (Fig. 7). The TG measurement of 1 is determined in the range of 20–640 °C. The first and second weight loss of 5.85% is between 161.0 and 288.4 °C (calculated 5.83%), corresponding to losses of two μ-COO−units. It lost two p-MePhHIDC2−units (observed 32.21%, calculated 32.63%) from 288.4 to 381.6 °C. Then, it keeps losing weight from 381.6 to 472.0 °C, corres- ponding with the loss of the remaining p-MePhH2IDC− ligands and two phen units (observed 33.94%, calculated 31.95%). Finally, a plateau region is observed above 472.0 °C. The white amorphous residue is 2PbO (observed 28.89%, calculated 29.57%). The TG analysis of 2 reveals that the first and second weight loss of 13.37% is between 199.4 and 340.7 °C Fig. 6 (a) The stockade sheet structure of 6 with quadrilateral meshes (C, N, and H atoms omitted for clarity).

View Article Online (calculated 12.76%), corresponding to losses of two μ-COO− units. It keeps losing weight beyond 340.7 °C (observed 55.36%, calculated 55.25%), which can be attributed to the loss of the remaining p-MePhH2IDC−ligands. The remaining weight of 31.27% (calculated 31.99%) is close to the percen- tage of the Pb and O components, indicating that the final white product is PbO. The TG curve indicates that 3 exhibits a three-stage decomposition process. The first weight loss of 3.31% from 179.0 to 243.1 °C (calculated 2.66%) is assigned to the release of two coordinated water molecules. The second weight loss of 20.79% is between 243.1 and 370.5 °C, accompanying the loss of one p-MePhHIDC2−ligand and one μ-COO−unit (calculated 21.30%). Subsequently, it keeps losing weight beyond 370.5 °C, which is attributed to the loss of the remaining p-MePhHIDC2−and p-MePhH2IDC−ligands (observed 46.50%, calculated 47.55%). The brown amorphous residue is 3CdO (observed 29.40%, calculated 28.49%). For 4, the weight loss of 40.57% (calculated 38.11%) from 39.6 to 464.3 °C is assigned to the release of one free water molecule, four coordinated water molecules and two p-MePh- HIDC2− ligands. When the temperature is higher than 434.3 °C, decomposition of the other parts of the two p-MePh- HIDC2−ligands (observed 30.11%, calculated 28.02%) can be observed. The brown amorphous residue is 4CdO (observed 32.49%, calculated 33.87%). For 5, the dehydration happens below 140.2 °C, which is ascribed to the loss of one free water molecule (observed 2.12%, calculated 1.93%). It keeps losing weight from 367.7 to 464.3 °C (29.48%, calculated 31.93%), which could be attribu- ted to the loss of one p-MePhHIDC2−unit. When the tempera- ture is higher than 464.3 °C, another p-MePhHIDC2−and one 4,4′-bipy unit are removed (observed 37.42%, calculated 38.86%). The final residue is 2CdO (observed 30.98%, calcu- lated 27.28%). For polymer 6, a weight loss of 4.71% (calculated 3.39%) is observed from 299.7 to 365.5 °C for the removal of one COO− unit per formula unit. When the temperature reaches 365.5 °C, parts of the organic ligands are removed (observed 33.96%, calculated 34.28%). Above 519.6 °C, rapid weight loss occurs owing to the decomposition of the remaining p-MePhHIDC2− and one 4,4′-bipy ligands (observed 43.94%, calculated 45.93%). The remaining weight of 17.39% corresponds to the percentage (calculated 16.40%) of the Mn and O components, indicating that the final product is 3MnO. The results indicate that the 3D frameworks of 2 and 6 can be thermally stable at high temperature, while the MOF of 4 is less thermally stable. The relative lower stability of 4 may be due to the large volume of the channels containing free water molecules, which are easily lost upon heating, which then col- lapse consequently. The solid-state ultraviolet absorption spectra of the poly- mers and the corresponding free p-MePhH3IDC ligand have been investigated at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 8, the absorption spectra of complexes are similar as the free ligand p-MePhH3IDC; each of which shows a maximal absorption at 256 nm, which can be assigned to π–π* excitations of p-MePh- H3IDC. This is to say, when p-MePhH3-IDC is coordinated to the metal ions, stable complexes are formed. Thus, there is no metal–ligand charge transfer (MLCT) in the complexes. The UV- vis absorption of the complexes still belong to the π–π* tran- sitions of the p-MePhH3IDC ligand. Conclusions Summarily, a series of coordination polymers (CPs) through the employment of p-MePhH3IDC with metal ions under sol- vothermal conditions have been obtained and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction, elemental analyses, thermal analyses, solid-state UV-Vis and IR spectra. The structural types of these Pb(II), Cd(II) and Mn(II) coordination polymers are strongly influenced by the reaction factors, including ancillary ligands, temperature, metal ions and so on. In particular, the chelating and bridging ancillary ligands have a great influence on the final structures. In general, the chelating ligand can reduce the dimension of polymers, but the bridging ligands can result in complicated structures. More importantly, our experiments further confirm that the p-MePhH3IDC compound shows fascinating coordination features.
