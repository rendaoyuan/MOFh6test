Manuscript Interpenetrated metal–organic frameworks and their uptake of CO2 at relatively low pressures† Qingxia Yao, Jie Su, Ocean Cheung, Qingling Liu, Niklas Hedin* and Xiaodong Zou* Received 16th November 2011, Accepted 8th February 2012 DOI: 10.1039/c2jm15933c Adsorption-driven separation of CO2 from ﬂue gas has the potential to cut the cost for carbon capture and storage. Among the porous physisorbents, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of promising candidates for gas separation and storage owing to their extraordinarily high speciﬁc surface areas and pore volumes, and predesigned pore structures. Here, we report three interpenetrated MOFs composed of Zn4O clusters and rigid dicarboxylate anions, namely SUMOF-n (SU ¼ Stockholm University; n ¼ 2, 3, 4). All the interpenetrated MOFs possess small pores of two different types and high pore volumes. SUMOF-2 had a structure similar to interpenetrated MOF-5, but with an extra-framework cation present in one of the two types of pores. SUMOF-3 was an interpenetrated version of IRMOF-8 while SUMOF-4 crystallized with mixed linkers, biphenyl-4,40-dicarboxylic acid and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid. Among the three SUMOFs, SUMOF-4 had the largest speciﬁc surface area (1612 m2 g1) and pore volume. Single component adsorption of CO2 and N2 was determined at 273 K. We showed that the interpenetrated SUMOF-2 adsorbed more CO2 than non-interpenetrated MOF-5 under 273 K and 1 bar. This may be explained by the increased electric ﬁeld gradients due to the interpenetration in the MOF. The uptake of CO2 for SUMOF-2 and SUMOF-4 was signiﬁcant at somewhat higher pressure. Their CO2 isotherms were close to linear, which could be beneﬁcial for separation of CO2 via pressure swing adsorption from biogas or natural gas. On the other hand, SUMOF-3 adsorbed most CO2 at pressures relevant for CO2 capture from ﬂue gas. Introduction Adsorption-driven separation of CO2 from N2-rich ﬂue gas mixtures is highly relevant for the economics of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Today, CO2 is typically captured by liquid amines, but adsorption-driven processes could potentially cut the cost for such capture signiﬁcantly.1 Choi et al.,2 Hedin et al.,3 and D’Alessandro et al.4 have reviewed adsorbents for CO2 capture in general. Rapid uptake, high capacity, high selectivity for CO2, appropriate heat and mass transfer characteristics and mechan- ical properties are all important for adsorbents for CO2 capture. The partial pressure of CO2 in ﬂue gas is about 0.1 bar at a total pressure of 1–1.5 bar. A 1000 MW coal-ﬁred power plant produces 1000 ton-CO2 per h, and it appears to be almost inconceivable to compress ﬂue gas. Hence, a physisorbent for post-combustion capture of CO2 should have small pores. This is because the electric ﬁeld gradients are greater in small pores and these interact with the signiﬁcant quadrupole moment of CO2, causing a larger tendency to adsorption than in large pores. In addition, CO2 interacts more frequently with multiple walls/ chains in small pores than in large pores. Microporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) composed of inorganic and organic building units are promising porous mate- rials with many applications in gas storage, separation, and catal- ysis.5 Bae and Snurr recently reviewed how MOFs and related adsorbents for CO2 separation and capture could be rapidly eval- uated, which is relevant due to the very rich chemistry of MOFs.6 For separation and puriﬁcation of small gas molecules such as CO2, N2, H2, and CH4, MOFs with interpenetrated structures have great potential, since their pore apertures can be tuned to the size of the gas molecules.4,6 For example, interpenetrated MOFs have shown signiﬁcant uptake of H2.7,8 Chen et al. showed that a doubly interpenetrated Cu-MOF9 and a triply interpenetrated Cu-MOF10 had signiﬁcant uptake of CO2 at 195 K and a very low uptake of N2 at 77 K. Cheon and Suh studied a four-fold interpenetrated Ni- MOF with cyclam and methanetetrabenzoate ligands had signiﬁ- cant uptake of CO2 and a negligible uptake of N2.11 Bastin et al. showed the ﬁrst example of separation and removal of CO2 from binary CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 as well as ternary CO2/N2/CH4 mixtures at ﬁxed bed using an interpenetrated MOF, MOF-508b.12 Here, we present the syntheses and structures of three two-fold interpenetrated MOFs based on Zn4O clusters and rigid dicarbox- ylic acids. All the three MOFs have narrow pores and are thermally stable up to at least 400 C.

Their pressure dependencies for the uptake of CO2 and of N2 were investigated and discussed in the context of capture of CO2 from point sources. Experimental Synthesis SUMOF-2, SUMOF-3, and SUMOF-4 were synthesized under solvothermal conditions from Zn(NO3)2$6H2O and corre- sponding rigid dicarboxylic acids in dimethylformamide (DMF) (Scheme 1). Colorless crystals large enough for single crystal X- ray diffraction analysis were obtained. SUMOF-2, which is related to an interpenetrated analogue of MOF-5, was synthesized by ﬁrst dissolving Zn(NO3)2$6H2O (600 mg, 2 mmol; Sigma-Aldrich, CAS number 10196-18-6) and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC, 170 mg, 1 mmol; Aldrich, CAS number 100-21-0) in 20 mL of DMF (VWR, CAS number 68- 12-2). The solution was solvothermally treated in a 30 mL Teﬂon- linedautoclaveat120 C for24h, understatic conditions.Colorless cubiccrystalsformed(yield z 300 mg), which wereﬁltered,washed with DMF, and dried at room temperature. The chemical formula of activated SUMOF-2 is [Zn4O(BDC)3]$(ZnO)0.125 as deduced from the structure reﬁnement and the elemental analysis (wt%): exp: C 36.61, H 1.742, N 0.034; calcd: C 36.96, H 1.529, N 0. SUMOF-3, which is an interpenetrated analogue of IRMOF-8, was synthesized by ﬁrst dissolving Zn(NO3)2$6H2O (117 mg, 0.39 mmol) and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (H2NDC, 54.8 mg, 0.25 mmol; Aldrich, CAS number 1141-38-4) in 5 mL of DMF in a 20 mL glass vial. The solution was solvothermally treated at 130 C for 28 h, under static conditions. Yellow crystals formed (yield z 70 mg). The crystals were ﬁltered, washed with DMF, and dried at room temperature. The chemical formula of activated SUMOF-3 is [Zn4O(NDC)3], as deduced from the structure reﬁnement and the elemental analysis (wt%): exp: C 46.36, H 2.240, N 0.051; calcd: C 46.99, H 1.970, N 0. SUMOF-4 was synthesized by ﬁrst dissolving Zn(NO3)2$6H2O (228 mg, 0.76 mmol), benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC, 83 mg, 0.50 mmol), and biphenyl-4,40-dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC, 61 mg, 0.25 mmol; Aldrich, CAS number 787-70-2) in 10 mL of DMF in a 20 mL glass vial. The solution was solvothermally treated at 130 C for 4 h, under static conditions. Colorless prism crystals formed (yield z 120 mg). The crystals were ﬁltered, washed with DMF, and dried at room temperature. The chemical formula of activated SUMOF-4 is [Zn4O(BDC)2(BPDC)(H2O)], as deduced from the structure reﬁnement and the elemental analysis (wt%): exp: C 41.24, H 2.205, N 0.029; calcd: C 41.66, H 2.083, N 0. Elemental analysis indicates that coordinated water molecules were retained after activation at 200 C. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) PXRD data were collected on a PANalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer using Cu Ka1 (l ¼ 1.5406 A) radiation, recorded on a Pixel detector at a speed of 2 (2q) min1. Samples were dispersed uniformly on plates of silicon with a zero-background by using isopropanol. Structure determination by single crystal X-ray diffraction Single crystal X-ray diffraction data were recorded at room temperature on an Oxford Diffraction Xcalibur 3 diffractometer, with Mo Ka radiation (l ¼ 0.71073 A). Data reduction was per- formed using the CrysAlisPro program and multi-scan adsorption correction was applied. Structures were solved by direct methods. Non-hydrogen atoms were located directly from difference Fourier maps. Framework hydrogen atoms were placed geometrically and constrained in the riding model to the parent atoms. Final structure reﬁnements were performed with the SHELX program13a by minimizing the sum of the squared deviations of F2 using a full- matrix technique. High symmetry and large pore sizes of the MOFs, as well as disorders of the guest molecules (DMF and H2O) in the pores, precluded location of these guest molecules. The PLATON/SQUEEZE program was used to remove scattering contribution from disordered guest molecules and to produce solvent-free diffraction intensities, which were used in the ﬁnal structure reﬁnement.13b Due to large fractional pore volumes, intensities and resolution of the diffraction data were rather poor as indicated by the low I/s, high Rint and low 2q angles. These effects also resulted in relatively high R values in the ﬁnal reﬁnements. A summary of crystal data and structure reﬁnement of the SUMOFs is given in footnote‡ and more details are presented in Table S1†.

The SUMOFs were heated from 30 C to 700 C at a heating rate of 10 C min1 in a platinum holder under a continuous ﬂow of dry air. N2 adsorption at 77 K N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 analyzer. The SUMOFs were degassed under N2 ﬂow at 473 K for 3 h and subsequently under dynamic vacuum at 473 K for 6 h. Speciﬁc surface areas were calculated from the data in the adsorption branch at p/p0 ¼ 0.05– 0.15. Total pore volumes were calculated from the uptake at p/p0 of 0.985. Adsorption of CO2 and N2 at 273 K Adsorption and desorption isotherms of CO2 and N2 were recorded at 273 K for degassed SUMOFs at pressures of 0.0004– 1 atm on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 device. For each SUMOF, about 200 mg of the sample was degassed using the same procedure as described above. The temperature was controlled during the measurements. Results and discussion Synthesis and characterization of interpenetrated SUMOFs High concentrations of reactants, high temperatures or long reaction time usually result in interpenetrated MOFs. In our case, SUMOF-2 and 3 can be regarded as interpenetrated analogues of MOF-5 and IRMOF-8, respectively.14 SUMOF-2 was synthesized under similar conditions as those described by Haﬁzovic et al.,15 except that a longer reaction time was used. Materials of the MOF-5 type have been reported to be highly sensitive to the preparation method.15,16 It is worthy to note that for our synthesis, the zinc source, Zn(NO3)2$6H2O, was kept intact to avoid water from air being adsorbed onto it. Otherwise, one could observe multiple impurities in the product, including a large quantity of ZnO spherical particles, as usually observed in synthesis of MOF-5.17 SUMOF-3, a two-fold interpenetrated analogue of IRMOF-8, was synthesized with a higher concen- tration of H2NDC at higher temperature, comparing with those for the synthesis of IRMOF-8.18 To our knowledge, synthesis of pure interpenetrated IRMOF-8 has not yet been reported, although it has been proposed.18,19 SUMOF-4 was synthesized with mixed linkers, H2BPDC and H2BDC. For all three SUMOFs, phase purity was conﬁrmed by both PXRD and TGA analysis (see ESI, Fig. S1†). The chemical formula of the acti- vated SUMOFs as deduced from the structure reﬁnement is [Zn4O(BDC)3]$(ZnO)0.125 for SUMOF-2, [Zn4O(NDC)3] for SUMOF-3, and [Zn4O(BDC)2(BPDC)(H2O)] for SUMOF-4, which match those from the TGA analysis (see ESI, Fig. S1†) and elemental analysis. Structures of SUMOF-2, SUMOF-3 and SUMOF-4 The structures of the three SUMOFs are all composed of Zn4O clusters combined with different linkers, and exhibit the pcu net topology with two-fold interpenetration (Fig. 1). Each Zn4O cluster is coordinated to six dicarboxylate anions, linking the coordination frameworks in three dimensions. Similar Zn4O clusters are present in many MOFs.5a,b,f,h,j,14 SUMOF-2 is a doubly interpenetrating analogue of MOF-5. The single network of SUMOF-2 is built from Zn4O clusters linked by BDC anions (Fig. 1a). SUMOF-2 has two different types of cavities with the free diameter of 5.9 A and 7.7 A, respectively (Fig. 1b). Similar interpenetrated MOF-5 structures were previously reported,16a,f with water molecules occupied in the small cavities. The structure reﬁnement of SUMOF-2 showed a very high electron density in the center of the small cavities, which was almost twice the density of a fully occupied oxygen atom. EDS (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy) and ICP- OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectros- copy) revealed zinc to be the only element present in the sample with an atomic number higher than oxygen’s. Therefore, the high electron density in the cavities was assigned to Zn2+ cations. The ﬁnal structure reﬁnement gave an occupancy of 0.5 for Zn2+.

Thus, the small cavities are partially blocked by Zn2+. This kind of pore ﬁlling effects by the Zn-species also can be observed in MOF-5.15 The total solvent-accessible volume of the desolvated framework, after removal of guest solvates and coordinated water molecules, was estimated to be 44.2% using the PLATON/ VOID routine. The charge of these extra-framework cations is most probably balanced by hydroxyl groups connected to the Zn4O clusters. The powder XRD pattern of as-synthesized SUMOF-2 matched well with the simulated one, based on the structure determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, as shown in Fig. 2a. Two intense peaks at 9.6 and 9.8 were detected in the pattern of as-synthesized SUMOF-2, whereas non-inter- penetrated MOF-5 only showed one peak, at 9.7. The splitting of the peaks disappeared after SUMOF-2 was heated for 6 hours at 200 C in dynamic vacuum. This disappearance is probably related to symmetry changes associated with the removal of guest molecules. Although the peak positions in the PXRD patterns were almost identical for SUMOF-2 and MOF-5, peak intensi- ties differed signiﬁcantly for the two structures. The intensity distribution in the experimental PXRD patterns of SUMOF-2 was similar to a simulated one based on the structure of SUMOF-2, which conﬁrms that SUMOF-2 is a two-fold inter- penetrated MOF-5 structure. SUMOF-3 is built up by Zn4O clusters and the NDC linkers and can be regarded as a two-fold interpenetrated analogue of IRMOF-8 (Fig. 1c and d). Three of the Zn atoms in the Zn4O cluster are tetrahedrally coordinated to form ZnO4 and one is octahedrally coordinated to form ZnO6. Each Zn4O cluster is connected to six NDC linkers and two water or DMF molecules. SUMOF-3 has two types of cavities, with free diameters of about 6.6 A and 9.5 A, respectively. The total solvent-accessible volume of the desolvated framework, after removal of guest solvates and coordinated water molecules, was calculated to be 58.3%. The octahedral coordination of one of the Zn atoms and the p–p interaction between the two interpenetrating frameworks led to signiﬁcant distortions of the unit cell, from ideal cubic to triclinic. Rowsell and Siberio-Perez et al. suggested that IRMOF-8 has a tendency to form interpenetrated versions.19 However, no pure interpenetrated analogue of IRMOF-8 was reported. The simu- lated PXRD patterns of IRMOF-8 with a single network and SUMOF-3 with a doubly interpenetrated framework differ signiﬁcantly, as shown in Fig. 2b. The PXRD pattern of the as- synthesized SUMOF-3 is similar to the simulated PXRD patterns of SUMOF-3, indicating that the bulk sample contains interpenetrated framework SUMOF-3. The PXRD pattern of activated SUMOF-3, after removal of the guest molecules, changed signiﬁcantly as compared to that of the as-synthesized SUMOF-3, indicating that the framework of SUMOF-3 is rather ﬂexible and changes from the original framework structure after activation. SUMOF-4 was synthesized using mixed linkers and crystal- lized in the orthorhombic space group Pnnm. The asymmetric unit of SUMOF-4 contains one Zn4O cluster, one BDC linker, one BPDC linker, one coordinated water and one DMF mole- cule. Similar to those in SUMOF-3, three of the Zn atoms in the Zn4O cluster are tetrahedrally coordinated to form ZnO4 and one is octahedrally coordinated to form ZnO6. Each Zn4O cluster is connected to four BDC linkers to form a two- dimensional square network, which is further linked by BPDC anions to form a three-dimensional framework, as shown in Fig. 1e and f. DMF or water molecules are coordinated to the ZnO6 octahedron as terminal groups. The framework of SUMOF-4 also adopts a two-fold interpenetration as SUMOF- 2 and -3. Because of the longer BPDC linkers, the void space in Fig. 2 Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for SUMOF-2 (a), SUMOF-3 (b) and SUMOF-4 (c): as-synthesized (black line), activated (red line), simulated (blue line), and simulation of non-interpenetrated frameworks (orange line). 10348 | J.

In SUMOF-4, the cavities have free diameters of 6.0 A and 7.9 A, respectively. The PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized SUMOF-4 was very similar to that simulated based on the reﬁned structure of SUMOF-4, implying that there is no impurity in the powder sample. The PXRD pattern of activated SUMOF-4 showed an extra peak at a low 2q angle (5.1), which corresponds to the 010 reﬂection of SUMOF-4. The 010 reﬂection was absent due to the Pnnm symmetry in the as- synthesized SUMOF-4, but present in the activated sample. This difference indicates that when the guest species are removed, symmetry of SUMOF-4 changes. The simulated PXRD pattern of a single SUMOF-4 network is also shown in Fig. 2c, which differs signiﬁcantly from the as-synthesized SUMOF-4, conﬁrming that the sample was pure. The single SUMOF-4 network also has a different symmetry than the interpenetrated SUMOF-4. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) TGA curves for the interpenetrated MOFs are given in Fig. S1†. SUMOF-2, 3 and 4 lost all their solvents at 250, 200 and 200 C, and started to decompose at 480, 420 and 420 C, respectively. Adsorption of N2 at 77 K TGA analysis (Fig. S1†) shows that all occluded guest solvents in SUMOFs were removed from the pores at 473 K. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K for SUMOF-2, SUMOF-3 and SUMOF-4 are presented in Fig. 3. SUMOF-4 showed a higher uptake of N2 than SUMOF-2 and SUMOF-3 at relative pressures (p/p0) of N2 > 104. SUMOF-4 has a larger speciﬁc pore volume than SUMOF-2 and SUMOF-3, see Table 1. Obviously, this ﬁnding is not consistent with the calculated voids based on the crystal structures. This difference could possibly be related to a relative shift of single networks with respective to each other after activation, leading to changes of the void. The area was the largest for SUMOF-4 (1612 m2 g1), which can be rationalized by the extended and thin biphenylic groups in the structure. The BET model failed to represent data well and it is not ideal to assume multilayer adsorption in the very narrow pores of these SUMOFs. Hence, the speciﬁc surface areas were calculated using the Langmuir model, which repre- sented the data very well. For relative N2 pressure (p/p0) of 105 to 104, SUMOF-2 had a signiﬁcantly higher uptake than did SUMOF-3 and SUMOF-4. This difference is related either to the smaller window of SUMOF-2 compared with the others, or most possibly to the presence of the extra framework cations in SUMOF-2. Adsorption of CO2 and N2 at 273 K The adsorption isotherms for CO2 and N2 were determined at 273 K for SUMOF-2, SUMOF-3 and SUMOF-4 and are pre- sented in Fig. 4 and 5. All the SUMOFs showed higher uptake for CO2 than for N2. At CO2 pressures of 100 kPa, the uptake of CO2 for SUMOF-2, SUMOF-3 and SUMOF-4 at 273 K was 4.26, 3.44, and 3.60 mmol g1, while the uptake of N2 was 0.27, 0.19, and 0.17 mmol g1 respectively. The uptake of CO2 for SUMOF-2 compared well with that of Zn-aminotriazolato- oxalate (4.3 mmol g1 at 273 K).20 It is interesting to note that the uptake of CO2 for SUMOF-2 was remarkably higher than that of non-interpenetrated MOF-5 (1.50 mmol g1 or 66.1 mg g1 at 100 kPa and 273 K).21 This difference can be ascribed to the increased electric ﬁeld gradients due to the interpenetration in SUMOF-2.

At CO2 pres- sures of <40 kPa, SUMOF-3 had higher uptake than SUMOF-2 and SUMOF-4. This higher uptake means that SUMOF-3 could be a better CO2 adsorbent for vacuum swing adsorption appli- cations than the others. Speculatively, the enhanced low-pressure uptake of CO2 could be related to the fact that SUMOF-3 has linkers with larger aromatic moieties than SUMOF-2 and SUMOF-4. In contrast, at pressures >90 kPa, SUMOF-3 had the lowest uptake among the three SUMOFs studied. As SUMOF-3 has a larger accessible void than the other SUMOFs, the highly curved adsorption isotherm for CO2 indicates that SUMOF-3 would have a second step for CO2 adsorption at higher pressures or lower temperatures than those studied. SUMOF-2 and SUMOF-4 had high uptake of CO2 at pressures >90 kPa, which could be beneﬁcial for gas separation processes that operate at elevated pressures. The uptake of N2 shows a different trend from that of CO2. The uptake of N2 is the largest on SUMOF-2 at all pressures studied. Its isotherm conforms to Henry’s law as the uptake is linearly related to the pressure. However, for SUMOF-3 and SUMOF-4, the isotherms curve at pressures >40 kPa. The relative uptake levels of CO2 and N2 could give an indi- cation of the CO2-over-N2 selection in a binary mixture. By this measure it appeared that SUMOF-3 or SUMOF-4 would have higher selectivity for CO2-over-N2 selection at pressures relevant for a ﬂue gas. The relative uptake of CO2 vis-a-vis N2 was 50% higher for SUMOF-3 than for SUMOF-2 at a pressure of 20 kPa. Conclusions Three interpenetrated MOFs (SUMOF-2, SUMOF-3 and SUMOF-4) with small pores and high speciﬁc surface areas were synthesized and characterized. Single component adsorptions of CO2 and N2 were determined for these materials at 273 K and various pressures. At pressures relevant for capture of CO2 without a compression of ﬂue gases, the uptake was greatly increased as compared to that of their non-interpenetrated counterparts. This increase can be ascribed to the enhanced interaction of CO2 with the interpenetrated frameworks. With the aid of interpenetration in these MOFs, the electric ﬁeld gradients in the small pores are increased, and therefore enhancing the interaction between CO2 and the host framework. Still, SUMOF-2–4 showed somewhat lower uptake of CO2 than those of aluminum-rich zeolites at such pressures of CO2. On the other hand, the uptake of CO2 showed a nearly linear dependency, especially for SUMOF-2, which could be beneﬁcial for separation of CO2 via pressure swing adsorption from biogas or natural gas. For further studies of interpenetrated MOFs for a capture of CO2 from ﬂue gas, we believe that it would be beneﬁcial to use linkers with heteroatoms. Such heteroatoms will further enhance the electric ﬁeld gradients, and hence, the tendency to physisorb CO2. Zn-based MOFs are very sensitive to water and a water removal step would be needed in an actual process for CO2 capture, and we regard them as a model system. Hence, it could be important to replace the Zn4O moiety, when developing actual sorbents.

The SUMOFs were heated from 30 °C to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a platinum holder under a continuous flow of dry air. TGA curves for the interpenetrated MOFs are given in Fig. S1. SUMOF-2: it lost all solvents (DMF and water) with a mass loss of 25.8% before 250 °C. During this process, the entrapped zinc species, Zn(OH)2, in the pores would be dehydrated to ZnO. There is no mass loss between 250 and 450 °C. Upon heating to 480 °C in air, it starts to decompose to give 31.8% ZnO. The observed mass loss for the activated SUMOF-2 upon decomposition to ZnO is 57.1%, which matches very well with the calculated theoretical mass loss, 57.0%, suggesting that the sample is pure. SUMOF-3: it lost all solvents (DMF and water) with a mass loss of 34.0% before 200 °C. There is no mass loss between 200 and 400 °C. Upon heating to 420°C in air, it starts to decompose to give 23.2% ZnO. The observed mass loss for the activated SUMOF-3 upon decomposition to ZnO is 64.9%, which matches very well with the calculated theoretical mass loss 64.6%, suggesting that the sample is pure. SUMOF-4: it lost all solvents (DMF and water) with a mass loss of 31.8% before 220 °C. There is no mass loss between 220 and 420 °C. Upon heating to 420°C in air, it starts to decompose to give 26.4% ZnO. The observed mass loss for the activated SUMOF-4 upon decomposition to ZnO is 61.3%, which matches very well with the calculated theoretical mass loss 61.5%, suggesting that the sample is pure.

After further being exposed in air for 24 hours, two additional lines appear at 2 θ = 15.8 and 17.8°, suggesting formation of a second phase isostructural to MOF-69C.1 Similar results were observed for MOF-5 in humid air.2 Figure S6.
