Manuscript COMMUNICATION www.rsc.org/dalton | Dalton Transactions A lanthanide-based metal–organic framework with a dynamic porous property† Jun Zhao, La-Sheng Long,* Rong-Bin Huang and Lan-Sun Zheng Received 18th April 2008, Accepted 4th July 2008 First published as an Advance Article on the web 24th July 2008 DOI: 10.1039/b806615a Hydrothermal reaction of La(NO3)3, NaHCO3 and H3L (H3L = pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid) gives a 3D metal– organic framework with a dynamic porous property. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have received much interest in recent years because of their structural diversity and poten- tial applications in separation, storage, catalysis, and as multi- functional materials.1–4 Although a great variety of MOFs with diverse compositions and structures have been reported, those based on lanthanide ions remain less studied. This hiatus is attributable to the high coordination number requirement as well as the ﬂexible coordination geometry of these unique metal ions. However, it is these special features of lanthanide coordination chemistry that make their MOFs particularly attractive, both structurally5 and in terms of application. On the one hand, the bulky metal ions generally require, in addition to the framework forming ligands, solvent molecules to achieve saturation of their coordination sphere. On the other hand, their ﬂexible coordination geometry facilitates structural re-organization without disrupting the overall framework structure of the MOF.6 Upon removal of coordinated solvent molecules, the metal ions may adjust their coordination geometry to accommodate such changes, but the overall framework integrity is maintained. The unsaturated metal ions are then poised for binding and activation with desired substrates because of their inherent Lewis acidity.7,8 The processes of desolvation and guest binding, together with any structural re-organization in between, causes the MOF to be structurally dynamic. We note that current efforts in lanthanide-based MOFs have mainly been focused on their synthesis and determination of their static solid-state structure;5–8 and reports on dynamic porous lanthanide-based MOFs remain scarce,9 despite such a property playing a key role in the understanding of the catalytic mechanism.10 Herein, we report the synthesis and crystal structure of {[La2(HL)2(H2O)2(CO3)](H2O)7}∞(1), (H3L = pyrazole-3,5- dicarboxylic acid), a lanthanide-based MOF, as well as its dynamic porous property.‡ Complex 1 was prepared through the hydrothermal reaction of H3L, La(NO3)3·6H2O, and NaHCO3. Crystallographic studies reveal that in its asymmetric unit there is one La3+, one HL2−, half a carbonate ion, and four and a half water molecules.

For ESI and crystallographic data in CIF or other electronic format see DOI: 10.1039/b806615a Fig. 1, the La3+ ion is deca-coordinate, featuring coordination by four HL2−, two carbonato, and one aqua ligand. For a particular La3+, only one of the two HL2−carboxylate groups is coordinating, three being monodentate and the fourth one chelating. One of the HL2−ligands, with its carboxylate group monodentate in coordination, uses the N atom cis to this carboxylate group to form a ﬁve-membered ring with the metal ion. The bond lengths for La– O and La–N are 2.518(2)–2.906(7) and 2.812(7) A˚ , respectively. These bond distances are within the expected ranges reported for La3+ complexes.11,12 Fig. 1 ORTEP plot showing the coordination environment of the La3+ ion in 1. For the same La3+ ion, one carbonato ligand is monodentate, while the other is chelating. Further, the monodentate ligand uses the same O atom to bridge a neighbouring La3+, thus forming a one dimensional (1D) chain of the deca-coordinate La3+ ions. This bridging interaction is reinforced by two HL2−ligands, each using a carboxylate O to connect to a neighbouring La3+ ion. Two of such chains are then bridged by the chelating carbonato ligands by sharing a common O, each of these carbonato ligands generates a pair of chelating interactions, affording a 1D tape of two of the above mentioned 1D chains (Fig. 2). Between the two chains, the La3+ ions are separated by a shortest distance of 4.92 A˚ , while the neighbouring La3+ ions within the same chain are separated by a distance of 4.39 A˚ . Individual tapes are linked together via La3+– carboxylate coordination using the second carboxylate group of the HL2−ligand, resulting in the sophisticated MOF structure (Fig. 3). Water molecules are located in the pseudo-hexagonal channels and are hydrogen bonded to the carboxylate group of 4714 | Dalton Trans., 2008, 4714–4716 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008 Published on 24 July 2008.

The total potential solvent area occupied is 30.5% of the cell volume.13 Thermogravimetric analysis of complex 1 (ESI, Fig. S1)† reveals an initial weight loss of 15.43% between room temperature and 150 ◦C, consistent with the loss of lattice water (calcd 15.60%). No further weight loss was observed between 150 and 350 ◦C, indicating that over this temperature range, the composition of the dehydrated product remains unchanged. To explore any structural transitions upon temperature change and the possible dynamic behaviour of the MOF structure, variable temperature XRD patterns of 1, both pristine and dehydrated, were obtained (Fig. 4). Fitting these patterns gives both the space group and unit cell parameters, as shown in Table 1. The samples heated at 25 ◦C and 80 ◦C and the sample heated and then cooled to 25 ◦C are of the same space group, and their cell parameters are similar to those obtained using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. These results suggest that the framework of 1 is maintained during the dehydration process, and re-hydration is possible and regenerates the original hydrated structure. However, the sample Table 1 The space group and cell parameters for the ﬁtting of X-ray powder diffraction data using the Jade 5 procedure14 (25* indicates sample cooling to 25 ◦C in air after going through the heating cycle) Temp./◦C Space group a/A˚ b/A˚ c/A˚ b/◦ V/A˚ 3 25 Pnma 8.528 15.551 18.778 90 2490.4 80 Pnma 8.396 17.989 15.806 90 2387.2 190 P21/c 5.320 16.232 13.771 104.71 1150.3 25* Pnma 8.485 15.392 18.743 90 2447.9 Fig. 4 PXRD patterns for 1 at different temperatures. heated to 190 ◦C differs signiﬁcantly from the other samples. Due to the cracking of the single crystals at such a high temperature, we have not been able to establish its structure using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Since there is no change in its composition, it is reasonable to attribute such structural changes to the removal of guest water and the following reorganization of the inherently ﬂexible coordination sphere of La3+. Similar phenomena have been reported in the complex of Cr(OH)·{O2CC2H4CO2}·H2O.15 In summary, we report the synthesis and crystal structure of a lanthanide-based MOF. TGA and XRD studies reveal that its framework structure is maintained during a dehydration and re- hydration process, and that the removal of the guest water molecule results in a change of its porous shape. Gas adsorption studies of the MOF is under way. Acknowledgements This work was supported by the NNSFC (Grant No. 20721001) and the 973 project (Grant 2007CB815304) from MSTC.

Electronic Supplementary Information for Dalton Transactions This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008 Supporting information 4, Synthesis and X-ray crystallography of complex 1 Synthesis: Complex 1 was prepared as follows: An aqueous reaction mixture was prepared by dissolving H3L (0.044 g, 0.25 mmol), NaHCO3 (0.022 g, 0.25 mmol), and La(NO3)3 (0.108g, 0.25 mmol) in 18 mL of de-ionized water. Its pH was adjusted to 6.4 with 1.0 M NaOH. The resulting mixture was transferred to a 25-mL Teflon-lined vessel (Parr) and heated at 150oC for 1000 min. Cooling of the reaction mixture to room temperature at a rate of 5oC per hour afforded colourless crystalline solids as the product (yield: 0.027g; 27% based on La). Anal. Calcd (%) for C11H22La2N4O20: C, 16.42; H, 2.24; N, 6.96. Found: C, 16.37; H, 2.37; N, 6.93. X-ray Crystallography: Data collection was performed on a Bruker SMART Apex CCD diffractometer at 223 K for complex 1. Absorption corrections were applied by using the multiscan program SADABS.1 The structures were solved by direct methods, and non-hydrogen atoms, except for O4w and O5w, were refined anisotropically by least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL program.2 The O4w and O5w refined isotropically is due to their disorder, and no improvement can be achieved in the anisotropic thermal parameters by modelling disorder and/or using appropriate restraints, although the occupancies of these atoms are correct. The hydrogen atoms of organic ligands were generated geometrically (C-H, 0.96 Å, N-H = 0.87), while those for O1w to O5w are generated by using restraints on the O-H bond lengths and H-O-H bond angles and the fixing of the hydrogen atom U value to be 1.5 U(eq) of the parent oxygen atom. Generating the hydrogen atoms for O6w/O6w’ is failure, due to its anisotropic thermal parameters large enough even after modelling the disorder of the atom.
