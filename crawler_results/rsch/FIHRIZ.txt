Manuscript Cite this: DOI: 10.1039/c3ce40548f A microporous nickel–organic framework with an unusual 10-connected bct net and high capacity for CO2, H2 and hydrocarbons3 Received 28th March 2013, Accepted 26th June 2013 DOI: 10.1039/c3ce40548f www.rsc.org/crystengcomm Duan-Chuan Hou,ab Gui-Yuan Jiang,*b Hong-Ru Fu,a Zhen Zhaob and Jian Zhang*a Presented here is a three-dimensional microporous metal–organic framework [Ni3(m2-H2O)2(bdc)3 (pyrazine)2]?3(DMA) (1, H2bdc = terephthalic acid; DMA = N,N-dimethylacetamide) with a 10-connected bct net. The trinuclear Ni subunits act as the 10-connected nodes, and both bdc and pyrazine ligands act as the linkers. This uninodal bct net can be considered to be the combination of two subnets: one is the (4,4) layer formed by the Ni3 nodes and pyrazine linkers, and the other one is the typical pcu net built from the Ni3 nodes and bdc linkers. Remarkably, this stable microporous framework exhibits high CO2 and H2 uptake and good selectivity for CO2 over N2 at 273 K. Its sorption capacity for some hydrocarbons is also investigated. Introduction Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have attracted considerable interest not only due to their fascinating architectures and intriguing topologies, but also due to their potential applica- tions in gas storage, separation, sensing and heterogeneous catalysis.1–3 Polynuclear metal clusters as secondary building units (SBUs) to construct MOFs or PCPs are highly valued. This cluster-based building strategy can effectively accept more organic ligands around the cluster, and has been proved to be a promising and feasible method to form non-interpenetrating MOFs with highly connected topologies.4–6 In another way, polynuclear metal units may bring new special properties into the open structures of MOFs, which will help to extend the application area.6 In recent years, some MOFs with 8- to 12- connected topologies have been reported.7,8 However, due to the presence of big polynuclear metal units, most of these frameworks did not show any permanent porosity, thus they are rarely investigated for gas storage and separation.8 In this work, we report a three-dimensional microporous MOF [Ni3(m2-H2O)2(bdc)3(pyrazine)2]?3(DMA) (1, H2bdc = ter- ephthalic acid; DMA = N,N-dimethylacetamide) with a 10- connected bct topology and notable gas sorption properties. The structure of 1 clearly presents an unusual network assembly, mode. This uninodal bct-type framework can be considered as the unity of two subnets: one is the (4,4) layer formed from the Ni3 nodes and pyrazine linkers, and another feature is the typical pcu net built from the Ni3 nodes and bdc linkers. Remarkably, this stable microporous framework exhibits high CO2 and H2 uptake and good selectivity for CO2 over N2 at 273 K. Experimental section Materials and instrumentation All reagents were purchased commercially and used without further purification. All powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses were recorded on a Rigaku Dmax2500 diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.54056 Å) with a step size of 0.05u. Thermal stability studies were carried out on a NETSCHZ STA- 449C thermoanalyzer with a heating rate of 10 uC min21 under air. Synthesis of 1 A mixture of Ni(NO3)2?6H2O (0.1500 g, 0.5 mmol), H2bdc (0.0730 g, 0.5 mmol), pyrazine (0.040 g, 0.5 mmol), N,N-dimethylacetamide (5 mL) and methanol (2.5 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. It was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and then the mixture was sealed in a Parr autoclave and kept at 120 uC for three days. After the reaction was cooled to room temperature, green block crystals of 1 were formed (yield: 80%, based on Ni). Anal. calc. for C44H47Ni3N7O17: C,47.12%; H, 4.19%; N, 8.74%.

Results and discussion Single crystal X-ray analysis revealed that compound 1 features a 3D open framework constructed from two kinds of ligands. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains two crystallographically independent Ni centers. Both of them are octahedrally coordinated. As shown in Fig. 1, the Ni2 center is located at the center of symmetry, but the Ni1 center is in a lateral position. The Ni2 center is bonded to four carboxylate O atoms from four bdc ligands and two O atoms from two m2-water ligands, while the Ni1 center is coordinated by three carboxylate O atoms from three bdc ligands, two N atoms from two pyrazine ligands, and one O atom from a m2-water ligand. The Ni–O and Ni–N distances are all in a reasonable range. Two independent Ni centers are bridged by one m2-water ligand and two carboxylate groups, and the Ni…Ni separation distance is 3.540 Å. Due to the presence of an inversion center at the Ni2 site, a linear trinuclear Ni unit, Ni3(CO2)6(H2O)2, is formed. This unit is surrounded by six bdc ligands and four pyrazine ligands. It is also notable that there are two kinds of bdc ligands showing two different coordination modes. One bdc ligand is a m4-linker to bond four Ni centers, and its two carboxylate groups are symmetry-related. Another bdc ligand has no symmetry and acts as a m3-linker. Each pyrazine ligand connects two symmetry related Ni1 centers with the average Ni…Ni distance being 7.090 Å. The aforementioned Ni3(CO2)6(H2O)2 units are further linked by the pyrazine and bdc ligands to form a 3D open framework with large 1D channels along the c-axis (Fig. 2c). Each channel shows a square window with the size of 3.0 6 4.0 Å. These open channels are filled by the guest DMA molecules. The solvent accessible volume is estimated by PLATON to be about 49.6% of the total crystal volume. The main structural feature of 1 is the presence of a ten- connected uninodal bct net which can be considered as the unity of the (4,4) layers and the 3D pcu subnet. To simplify this complicated structure, each Ni3(CO2)6(H2O)2 unit can be reduced to a 10-connected node, and both bdc and pyrazine ligands can be regarded as linkers. The whole framework of 1 can be topologically represented as a 10-connected bct net (Fig. 2f).10 Since the structure of 1 contains two distinct linkers, it is easy to divide the whole structure into two parts. If only the connectivity between the Ni3(CO2)6(H2O)2 units and bdc ligands is considered, a 3D Ni-bdc framework is generated (Fig. 2a). From the viewpoint of the topology, such a Ni-bdc framework can be reduced into a typical pcu net which is commonly known in other MOF structures (Fig. 2d). Following the same consideration, the simple connectivity between the Ni3(CO2)6(H2O)2 units and pyrazine ligands becomes a (4,4) layer (Fig. 2b and 2e). The final framework of 1 is thus a combination of a 3D Ni-bdc framework and parallel (4,4) layers. The pyrazine ligands function as pillars stabilizing the Ni-bdc framework. Moreover, the 10-connected bct net can also be viewed as the integration of a pcu net and (4,4) nets. To the best of our knowledge, MOF structures with 10-connected bct topology have been rarely reported to date. The structure of 1 not only presents an unusual bct-type framework, but also clearly illustrates a special building mode of this network. To demonstrate the permanent porosity of 1, gas adsorp- tion measurements (N2, H2 and CO2) were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area and pore size analyzer. Before the gas adsorption, a freshly prepared sample of 1 was soaked in dichloromethane for 2 days to exchange guest DMA molecules. Subsequently, the sample was degassed under a dynamic vacuum at 60 uC for 10 h to activate the sample. The TGA results demonstrate that the guest DMA molecules were already exchanged by CH2Cl2 (Fig. S2 in the ESI3). The permanent porosity of 1 was confirmed by reversible N2 sorption measurements at 77 K, which showed a type I adsorption isotherm behavior (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the N2 isotherm exhibited hysteresis upon desorption, possibly due to hindered diffusion through narrow pore apertures. The Langmuir and BET surface areas for 1 were 767.5 m2 g21 and 555.0 m2 g21, respectively. A single data point at a relative Fig. 1 The coordination environment of 1, showing the trinuclear Ni unit.

At zero coverage, the enthalpy of the CO2 adsorption for 1 is 26.94 kJ mol21. In addition, the N2 adsorption isotherms for 1 were also measured at pressures up to 1 bar at 273 K. The results revealed that N2 was hardly adsorbed at 273 K (4.0 cm3 g21) (Fig. 4c). The maximal weight uptakes of CO2 and N2 at 273 K and 1 bar for 1 were used to estimate the adsorption selectivity for CO2 over N2.12 From these data, the calculated CO2/N2 selectivity is 41 : 1. It is notable that single component isotherms are not the most accurate way of determining the separation of gases in mixed streams. In view of the structural features of 1, the square window size for each channel is 3.0 6 4.0 Å, while the kinetic diameter of N2 is 3.6 Å and that of CO2 is 3.3 Å. Such gas- adsorption selectivity is closely associated with the pore dimensions, and kinetic separation may be a factor.13 The hydrogen sorption isotherms for 1 at 77 and 87 K are plotted in Fig. 5. No hysteresis was observed in these isotherms at the two temperatures. The adsorption isotherms revealed that 1 can adsorb 196.3 cm3 g21 (1.75 wt%) and 108.3 cm3 g21 (0.967 wt%) of H2 at 77 and 87 K, respectively. Virial analysis of the H2 adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K revealed that the adsorption enthalpy of 1 at zero surface coverage is 6.95 kJ mol21, which is moderate compared with the many famous porous materials, such as ZIF-8, HKUST-1, MOF-5, IRMOF-1 and IRMOF-8.11 In addition, apart from the N2, H2 and CO2 uptakes, some hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8) have been studied in sorption measurements of 1 at 273 K (Fig. 6, S3 and S4, ESI3). Compound 1 exhibits similar adsorption capacities for C2H4 (45.4 cm3 g21), C2H6 (42.5 cm3 g21), and C3H8 (40.2 cm3 g21) at 273 K and 1 bar (Fig. 6a). The most remarkable and significant feature is that compound 1 systematically adsorbs more C2 hydrocarbons than the C1 hydrocarbon methane (16.2 cm3 g21) (Fig. 6b). The maximal weight uptakes of C2H4 and CH4 at 273 K and 1 bar for 1 were used to estimate the adsorption selectivity for C2 over C1. From these data, the calculated C2/C1 selectivity is 5 : 1. The adsorption selectivity is comparable to the reported values for UTSA-35a and UTSA- 33a.14 These results indicate that compound 1 might be a promising material for selective adsorptive separation of C2 hydrocarbons from CH4. Conclusions In summary, we herein presented a rare bct-type microporous framework material with notable gas sorption properties. Through a dual-ligand assembly approach, a bct network integrating a pcu net and (4,4) net successfully formed a MOF structure. Although this compound doesn’t have a high surface area, it shows remarkable selectivity of CO2 over N2 at 273 K. In particular, it has good hydrogen storage ability (1.75 wt%) at 77 K and CO2 storage ability (4.71 mmol g21) at 273 K.
