Commun., 2012, 48, 8829–8831 Correlation between coordinated water content and proton conductivity in Ca–BTC-based metal–organic frameworksw Arijit Mallick, Tanay Kundu and Rahul Banerjee* Received 5th June 2012, Accepted 16th July 2012 DOI: 10.1039/c2cc34006b Proton conductivity of ﬁve Ca-based MOFs which depends on the amount of water molecules coordinated to the Ca-centres has been reported. These MOFs show high temperature proton conductivity due to the strong hydrogen bonding between the lattice and coordinated water molecules. Research on proton conducting porous solids has picked up recent attention due to its possible application in fuel cells. In general, these materials need proton carriers such as H3O+ or H+ and proton-conducting pathways.1 Naﬁon, although a well known proton conductor used in fuel cells, not only is expensive but its performance as a proton conductor decreases at higher temperatures (>80 1C) due to dehydration.2 As an alternative, researchers suggested the use of Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs) as proton conductors because of high chemical and thermal stability and diverse topological architecture with tunable functionality.3 Although transition metal based MOFs (e.g. cobalt, nickel, zinc and copper) have been widely investigated,4 the coordination chemistry of MOFs based on main-group metals (like Li+, Ca2+, Mg2+ or Al3+), especially Ca-based MOFs, is rarely explored and the properties are not studied widely.5 Herein, we present a series of Ca based MOFs synthesized using 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) as a linker in diﬀerent solvents (H2O, DMF, DMA, DMSO). These Ca-based MOFs have diﬀerent amounts of water content per Ca unit (Ca–BTC–H2O: 1.00, Ca–BTC–DMF: 0.66, Ca–BTC–DMA: 0.50, Ca–BTC: 0.00). It has been observed that water molecules coordinated to the metal play an important role in proton conduction due to the polarization eﬀect. As a result, Ca(II) as a metal center has been preferred for its higher polarizing ability compared to other metals, which should increase the proton conduction ability of the MOF by increasing the acidity of coordinated water molecules. These Ca–BTC based MOFs possess a distinct diﬀerence in their proton conducting ability. Ca–BTC–H2O, which has the highest amount of water content per Ca unit (1.00 per Ca unit), shows a high conductivity of 1.2  104 S cm1 and exhibits a low activation energy of 0.18 eV. It also shows proton conductivity at high temperature (72 1C). Ca–BTC–DMF and Ca–BTC–DMA have water content per Ca unit of 0.66 and 0.50, respectively, and show lower proton conductivity (4.8  105 S cm1 and 2.0  105 S cm1) as well as higher activation energy (0.32 and 0.40 eV). Ca–BTC–DMSO and Ca–BTC do not show any proton conductivity due to structural instability under humidiﬁed conditions and zero water content per Ca unit respectively (Fig. 1). Ca–BTC–H2O5a has been synthesized by using a 1 : 1 (0.2 mmol) mixture of BTC and Ca(OAc)2 in a H2O–ethanol mix-solvent (3 : 1) at 90 1C for 24 h. Ca–BTC–DMF5b has been synthesized by mixing Ca(NO3)24H2O (0.3 mmol) and BTC (0.1 mmol) in a mix-solvent (5.0 mL DMF and 1 mL H2O) at 85 1C for 48 h. Ca–BTC–DMA has been synthesized by mixing Ca(OAc)2 (0.1 mmol) and BTC (0.3 mmol) in a DMA–H2O (4 : 1) mix-solvent at 85 1C for 24 h. The synthesis of Ca–BTC–DMSO is similar to that of Ca–BTC–DMA, where DMSO has been used in place of DMA. Ca–BTC has been synthesized using CaCl2 (0.1 mmol) and BTC (0.3 mmol) in 2.5 mL dry DMF at 85 1C for 24 h. During synthesis of Ca–BTC-MOFs (apart from Ca–BTC–H2O and Ca–BTC) the amount of H2O should be added very carefully because addition of excess H2O will lead to the formation of Ca–BTC–H2O only (Section S1 in ESIw). The crystal structures of Ca–BTC–H2O and Ca–BTC–DMF were reported earlier.5a,b Ca–BTC–H2O contains a 1D channel along the crystallographic a axis containing a one dimensional array of lattice H2O molecules strongly hydrogen bonded [O–H  O, D = 2.762(6) A˚ , d = 1.937(5) A˚ , y = 159.11(3)] to the coordinated H2O and oxygen atoms of carboxylate groups.6 Ca–BTC–DMF contains edge shared CaO8 and CaO7 polyhedrons connected through the BTC ligand to form a 3D framework. Ca–BTC–DMF contains three lattice H2O molecules, discretely hydrogen bonded to the coordinated H2O, carboxylate oxygen atom and to other lattice H2O molecules. Ca–BTC–DMA (space group C2/c) contains a 1D channel along the crystallographic c axis and the coordinated DMA solvents and H2O molecules are facing towards the channel. Ca–BTC–DMSO (C2/c) does not contain any lattice H2O but only one H2O coordinated to the Ca2 center (S4 in the ESIw for crystallographic details of Ca–BTC-based MOFs). It is noteworthy that in all four Ca–BTC based MOFs, the water content per Ca-center varies systematically. In the case of Ca–BTC–H2O, each Ca-center has single water coordination.

Commun., 2012, 48, 8829–8831 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 So the water content per Ca center is 1.0. In Ca–BTC–DMF, each three Ca-center contains two H2O and two DMF molecules, and hence the water content per Ca unit is 0.66. Whereas, in Ca–BTC–DMA and Ca–BTC–DMSO, the water content per Ca unit is 0.50. In order to complete the series, we attempt to synthesize one Ca–BTC MOF isomer that will be devoid of any coordinated or lattice H2O. However, despite more than three reports5a,b,c on Ca–BTC-based MOFs, there has not been any successful synthesis of anhydrous Ca–BTC MOF. A possible reason could be the strong hygroscopic nature of Ca metal. We could successfully make anhydrous Ca–BTC by using CaCl2 as a precursor in dry DMF. Unlike Ca–BTC–DMF, DMA and DMSO do not contain any lattice as well as coordinated H2O molecules (S4 in ESIw). All major peaks of experimental and simulated PXRDs of Ca–BTC-MOFs match well indicating their reasonable crys- talline phase purity (Fig. S12 in ESIw). TGA techniques of Ca–BTC–H2O, Ca–BTC–DMF and Ca–BTC–DMA (under a N2 atmosphere) show almost similar stepwise weight loss, ﬁrst (6–15 wt%) at around 30–200 1C due to ready removal of both coordinated and lattice solvent molecules and followed by a sharp weight loss (20–30 wt%) at 350–440 1C, probably due to the decomposition of the framework (Fig. S13, ESIw). Ca–BTC does not have any coordinated or lattice solvent inside the framework, so it shows framework decomposition at 550 1C. Except Ca–BTC–DMSO, all four Ca–BTC-MOFs are thermally stable and show similar decomposition behaviors at high temperatures. Ca–BTC–DMSO shows a gradual weight loss up to 250 1C due to removal of solvent molecules and simultaneously framework decomposition. TGA traces of Ca–BTC–H2O and Ca–BTC–DMF show that the lattice H2O molecules leave at 75 1C and 40 1C, respectively, without breaking the framework. Variable-temperature single crystal data of Ca–BTC–H2O collected at diﬀerent temperatures [e.g. 25, 33, 43, 53, 65, 75, 80, and 90 1C] (Fig. 2c) reveal that 75 1C is the optimum temperature at which we could achieve a stable and solvent-free framework of Ca–BTC–H2O with reasonably good structural parameters [R1 = 4.1%, wR2 = 10.72%, GOF = 1.079]. In the case of Ca–BTC–DMF the VTSCXRD collected at diﬀerent temperatures [e.g. 173, 25, 30, 35, and 40 1C] reveals that a similar stable solvent free framework could be achieved at 40 1C (Fig. S14, ESIw) [R1 = 5.2%, wR2 = 19.72%, GOF = 1.435]. The framework stability of Ca–BTC–H2O has also been proved by variable temperature PXRD (VTPXRD). It has been observed that the framework is stable up to 150 1C and there is a reversible phase change after 150 1C (Fig. 2b). Ca–BTC–H2O shows a very high water vapor uptake of 22 wt% (275 cm3 g1 at STP), at a relative pressure (P/Po) of 0.9 (Fig. 2a) which is comparable with well known proton conducting MOFs [Me-FeCr(ox)3] (268 cm3 g1 at STP).3e The water adsorption data for Ca–BTC–H2O indicate that 6.1 water molecules per Ca metal centre can be incorporated inside the framework at STP. Whereas in the case of Ca–BTC–DMF and Ca–BTC–DMA a much lower water vapor uptake, 19 wt% (2.4 H2O molecules) and 7 wt% (1.5 H2O molecules per Ca metal centre), at a relative pressure (P/Po) of 0.9 is seen. It is interesting to note that the order of water adsorption is exactly following the order of coordinated water present per Ca center. Ca–BTC does not show any adsorption due to low hydrophilicity and nonporous nature. All these Ca–BTC-MOFs, only after humidiﬁcation for 24 h, start showing proton conduction. This eventually conﬁrms the Fig. 1 Schematic representation highlighting the synthetic scheme and water content per metal centre in an asymmetric unit of Ca–BTC based MOFs. Color code: Ca—green, O—red, C—black, N—blue, S—yellow and H—redish white. The coordinated waters are highlighted in pink circles.

Commun., 2012, 48, 8829–8831 8831 role of water as a proton carrier and grain boundary remover. In the case of Ca–BTC–H2O, Ca–BTC–DMF and Ca–BTC–DMA, the water molecules are absorbed within the crystals by strong hydrogen bonding with the carboxylate bound metal centers, coordinated and non-coordinated solvent molecules, which facilitate the proton conduction. The proton conductivity values for Ca–BTC–H2O, Ca–BTC–DMF and Ca–BTC– DMA are 1.2  104 S cm1, 4.08  105 S cm1 and 1.46  105 S cm1 at 25 1C and 98% relative humidity (RH) (Fig. 3). However, Ca–BTC and Ca–BTC–DMSO do not show any proton conductivity under the same conditions due to structural instability and lack of coordinated H2O molecules. There is a clear tendency that higher proton conductivity is observed in MOFs where more water content per Ca unit is present. Ca–BTC–H2O shows the highest proton conductivity because the water content per Ca unit is 1.00. Whereas Ca–BTC–DMF, Ca–BTC–DMA and Ca–BTC show gradually low to nil proton conductivity due to the steady decrease of water content per Ca unit. The activation energy values calculated for Ca–BTC–H2O, Ca–BTC–DMF and Ca–BTC–DMA are 0.18 eV, 0.31 eV and 0.40 eV, respectively (Grotthuss proton hopping mechanism),7 and in accordance with the aforementioned trend. We have also performed the temperature dependent proton conductivity for all these Ca-MOFs. Ca–BTC–H2O shows proton conductivity at a wide range of temperatures from 10 1C (1.2  105 S cm1) to 72 1C (3.2  105 S cm1), while Ca–BTC–DMF and Ca–BTC–DMA showed proton conductivity of 8.4  106 S cm1 (40 1C) and 9.4  106 S cm1 (35 1C) respectively. Noticeably, Ca–BTC–H2O shows proton conductivity at a much higher temperature (72 1C), than Ca–BTC–DMF (40 1C) and Ca–BTC–DMA (35 1C). Proton conduction in MOF at higher temperatures (more than 72 1C and 98% RH) is a rare phenomenon. There are only few reports stating MOFs, containing lattice H2O molecules, conduct protons at high temperature (MIL-53(Fe)-(COOH)2: 6.5  106 S cm1 at 72 1C).3c These MOFs exhibit lower proton conductivity than Ca–BTC–H2O at 72 1C (3.2  105 S cm1). The plausible reason behind the proton conductivity at higher temperature is due to the strong and continuous hydrogen bonding between coordinated and lattice H2O molecules which hold the H2O molecules till 72 1C (conﬁrmed by VT-SCXRD). However, in the case of Ca–BTC–DMF, the lattice H2O molecules are arranged as discrete hydrogen bonded clusters, which hold the H2O molecules till 40 1C. Ca–BTC–DMA and Ca–BTC do not contain any such continuous hydrogen bonded network within the framework. Hence we believe that strong hydrogen bonding between coordinated and non-coordinated H2O molecules plays a key role in high temperature proton conduction in Ca–BTC–H2O. In conclusion, we have studied the crystal structure and the proton conductivity of ﬁve Ca-MOFs at variable temperature and relative humidity. Ca–BTC–H2O shows a high conductivity of 1.2  104 S cm1 and exhibits a low activation energy of 0.18 eV and the water content per Ca unit is 1.00. Whereas Ca–BTC– DMF and Ca–BTC–DMA have water content per Ca unit of 0.66 and 0.50, which show 4.8  105 S cm1 and 1.46  105 S cm1 proton conductivity and 0.32 and 0.40 eV activation energy, respectively. Whereas Ca–BTC does not show proton conductivity because the water content per Ca unit is 0.00. Hence we believe that the extent of water content per metal unit plays a key role in high proton conduction under humidiﬁed conditions. We hope that these kinds of materials will provide a roadmap towards synthesis of controllable proton conducting materials by varying the water content per metal centre. Notes and references 1 K. D.

FT-IR (4000-600 cm–1): 1616 (s), 1553 (s), 1435 (s), 1680 (s), 1250 (w), 1107 (m), 1016 (m), 941 (w), 820 (w), 764 (s), 725 (s); elemental analysis calcd (%) for activated sample (C6 H2 Ca O4): C, 40.39; H, 1.25; found: C, 40.04; H, 1.18.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra confirmed the presence of carboxylate groups in the coordination sphere of the metal and suggest that the carboxylic groups of BTC are deprotonated in the MOFs materials. In this regard, BTC ligand shows the C=O stretching frequency of free aromatic carboxylic acid at ca. 1690 cm–1. When the carboxylic acid coordinates to the metal atoms, C=O stretching frequency shifted to lower frequencies (ca. 1550 cm–1), which is clearly observed in Ca-BTC-MOFs.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction data refinement procedures Data was collected on a Super Nova Dual source X-ray Diffractometer system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a CCD area detector and operated at 250 W power (50 kV, 0.8 mA) to generate Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The crystal reported in this paper was mounted on nylon CryoLoops (Hampton Research) with Paraton-N (Hampton Research). Initial scans of each specimen were performed to obtain preliminary unit cell parameters and to assess the mosaicity (breadth of spots between frames) of the crystal to select the required frame width for data collection. CrysAlisPro program software was used suite to carry out overlapping φ and ω scans at detector (2θ) settings (2θ = 28). Following data collection, reflections were sampled from all regions of the Ewald sphere to redetermine unit cell parameters for data integration. In no data collection was evidence for crystal decay encountered. Following exhaustive review of collected frames the resolution of the dataset was judged. Data were integrated using CrysAlisPro software with a narrow frame algorithm. Data were subsequently corrected for absorption by the program SCALE3 ABSPACK1 scaling algorithm. These structures were solved by direct method and refined using the SHELXTL 972 software suite. Atoms were located from iterative examination of difference F-maps following least squares refinements of the earlier models. Final model was refined anisotropically (if the number of data permitted) until full convergence was achieved. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions (C-H = 0.93 Å) and included as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters 1.2-1.5 times Ueq of the attached C atoms. In some cases modeling of electron density within the voids of the frameworks did not lead to identification of recognizable solvent molecules in these structures, probably due to the highly disordered contents of the large pores in the frameworks. Highly porous crystals that contain solvent-filled pores often yield raw data where observed strong (high intensity) scattering becomes limited to ~1.0 Å at best, with higher resolution data present at low intensity. A common strategy for improving X-ray data, increasing the exposure time of the crystal to X-rays, did not improve the quality of the high angle data in this case, as the intensity from low angle data saturated the detector and minimal improvement in the high angle data was achieved. Additionally, diffused scattering from the highly disordered solvent within the void spaces of the framework and from the capillary to mount the crystal Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 6 contributes to the background and the ‘washing out’ of the weaker data. The only optimal crystals suitable for analysis were generally small and weakly diffracting. Unfortunately, larger crystals, which would usually improve the quality of the data, presented a lowered degree of crystallinity and attempts to optimize the crystal growing conditions for large high-quality specimens have not yet been fruitful. Data were collected at 190(2) K for the MOF presented in this paper. This lower temperature was considered to be optimal for obtaining the best data. Electron density within void spaces has not been assigned to any guest entity but has been modeled as isolated oxygen and/or carbon atoms. The foremost errors in all the models are thought to lie in the assignment of guest electron density. The structure was examined using the Adsym subroutine of PLATON3 to assure that no additional symmetry could be applied to the models. The ellipsoids in ORTEP diagrams are displayed at the 50% probability level unless noted otherwise. For all structures we note that elevated R-values are commonly encountered in MOF crystallography for the reasons expressed above by us and by other research groups.4-13 Crystallographic data (excluding structure factors) for the structures are reported in this paper have been deposited with the CCDC as deposition No. CCDC 885042 - 885046.

Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 21 Crystal Structure of Ca-BTC-H2O [Ca(BTC)·H2O]:. Ca-BTC-H2O was first reported by M. J. Platers et al. The asymmetric unit of Ca-BTC-H2O (space group P-1) consist of one crystallographically independent Ca(II) centre, one BTC, one coordinated and one lattice H2O molecule. In the framework each Ca(II) is coordinated by eight oxygens of which seven arise from interaction of Ca with five distinct carboxylate anions. Three BTC anions act as monodentate ligands whereas the other two BTC anions coordinate in a bidentate fashion. One lattice H2O molecule completes the coordination sphere of Ca(II) metal centre. The Ca-BTC- H2O contains 1D channel along crystallographic a axis with coordinated H2O molecules facing the channel. The channel contains one dimensional array of lattice H2O molecules which are strongly hydrogen bonded with the coordinated H2O molecules and oxygen atom of carboxylate group. Here the hydrogen bonding is continuous through the channel.
