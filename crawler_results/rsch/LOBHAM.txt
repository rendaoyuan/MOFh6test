Habib,a Joaquin Sanchizb and Christoph Janiak*a Received 12th October 2007, Accepted 22nd January 2008 First published as an Advance Article on the web 27th February 2008 DOI: 10.1039/b715812b The hydrothermal reaction of M(NO3)2·6H2O (M = Ni and Zn) with benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (H3btc) and 1,2-bis(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)ethane (btre) produced the mixed-ligand coordination polymers (MOFs) 3 ∞{[Ni3(l3-btc)2(l4-btre)2(l-H2O)2]·∼22H2O} (1) and 3 ∞{[Zn3(l4-btc)2(l4-btre)(H2O)2]·2H2O} (3). The compounds, characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, X-ray powder diffraction and thermoanalysis feature trinuclear secondary building units (SBU) within the three-dimensional frameworks. The trinuclear nickel unit in 1 exhibits an intra-trimer together with some weak inter-trimer antiferromagnetic coupling with J = −13.88(8) cm−1 from the magnetic susceptibility measurement between 1.9–300 K. The zinc coordination polymer 3 shows a strong ﬂuorescence at 423 nm upon excitation at 323 nm (not seen in the free btre ligand). Compound 3 is thermally robust until 200 ◦C (ambient pressure) where loss of the water molecules starts. Careful control of the dehydration procedure (freeze-drying) for 1 and (heating to 280 ◦C) for 3 allowed for a solid-state reaction with single-crystal-to-single-crystal structural transformations in obtaining the largely dehydrated products 3 ∞{[Ni3(l2-btc)2(l4-btre)2(l-H2O)2(H2O)2]·4H2O} (2) and 3 ∞{[Zn3(l6-btc)2(l4-btre)2]·∼0.67H2O} (4), respectively. In the transformation from 1 to 2 the unit cell volume is reduced to about 60%. The transition from 3 to 4 involves breakage and formation of new Zn–O bonds. Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) or coordination polymers have recently attracted much attention because of their topology and potential applications in catalysis, adsorption (gas storage), luminescence, magnetism, etc.1–3 A key step for the construction of polymeric transition metal complexes is to select appropriate multidentate bridging ligands,1,2,4 with mixed-ligand coordination polymers becoming more important recently.5 Multi-carboxylic ligands with suitable spacers, especially benzoic acid-based lig- ands and also the 1,2,4-triazole ligand and its derivatives6 are frequent choices for metal–organic networks.1,2 Benzene-1,3,5- tricarboxylic acid (H3btc, also known as trimesic acid) is a rigid, planar molecule and has been extensively used in the form of its three benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate anions Hnbtc(3−n)−(n = 0, 1, 2) (Scheme 1) as a bridging ligand in the synthesis of multidimensional MOFs. Recent examples7 (metals as cations and ligand bridging mode in parentheses) are for H2btc−(Mn- aInstitut f¨ur Anorganische und Analytische Chemie, Universit¨at Freiburg, Albertstr. 21, D-79104, Freiburg, Germany.

The 1,2,4-triazole ligand and its 4-substituted derivatives can be used to obtain linear coordination polymers based on its bridging function, e.g. with Cu2+,29 Zn2+,30 Cd2+,31 together with a wide variety of molecular polynuclear complexes.32 The N1,N2-bridging mode of 1,2,4- triazole or triazolate (Scheme 1) constitutes a short ligand bridge between metal atoms which is a prerequisite for stronger magnetic Scheme 1 Ligands relevant to this work.

When spacers, like methylene groups, are introduced between the two 1,2,4-triazole rings, the resulting ligand acquires more ﬂexibility. Therefore we selected 1,2-bis(1,2,4-triazol-4- yl)ethane (abbreviated as btre). This btre ligand, which must not be mistaken with the 1,2-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethane ligand,39 has been scarcely used in metal-complex or MOF synthesis. A CSD search7 gave 2 ∞{M(NCS)2(l2-btre-jN1,N1′)2(NCS)2} (M = Fe, Co)40 and 3 ∞{[Cu3(l4-btre-jN1,N2,N1′,N2′)2(l3-btre- jN1,N2,N1′)4(H2O)2]2(ClO4)12·2H2O} as the only examples. The Cu compound consists of trinuclear metal units interconnected by btre ligands with two different l3- and l4-bridging modes.41 In this work we report on the structures and properties of mixed-ligand coordination polymers with the btre ligand: 3 ∞{[Ni3(l3-btc)2(l4-btre)2(l-H2O)2]·∼22H2O} (1), 3 ∞{[Ni3(l2- btc)2(l4-btre)2(l-H2O)2(H2O)2]·4H2O} (2), 3 ∞{[Zn3(l4-btc)2(l4- btre)(H2O)2]·2H2O} (3) and 3 ∞{[Zn3(l6-btc)2(l4-btre)]·0.67H2O} (4) including the single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations from 1 to 2 and 3 to 4. Results and discussion Syntheses Hydrothermal treatment of metal nitrates with 1,2-bis(1,2,4- triazol-4-yl)ethane (btre) and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (H3btc) yields the mixed-ligand coordination polymers 1 or 3 (eqn (1)). (1) Complete deprotonation of H3btc is achieved through the addition of triethylamine (NEt3). Thermal stability Degradation of the organic parts of the mixed-ligand networks 1 and 3 starts above 300 ◦C according to thermogravimetric analyses (Scheme 2). Compound 1 easily loses part of its water of crystallization upon removal from the mother liquor. Drying of 1 in air yields a light blue substance which is somewhat amorphous by X-ray powder diffractometry. Further drying under vacuum (1.5 mbar, 6 h) gives a pale blue substance, which turns green when the drying temperature under vacuum is raised to 50 ◦C (6 h). Exposing the green substance to moist air returns the pale blue color. When 1 is quickly transferred from the water phase to the TGA capsule (without prolonged drying and vacuum conditioning) the ﬁrst weight loss starts immediately and Scheme 2 Thermogravimetric analyses of 1 and 3. corresponds to the removal of the (remaining) water molecules of crystallization. Crystalline samples of 3 were dried at 35 ◦C and 1.5 mbar for 6 h and at 100 ◦C and 10−4 mbar (turbomolecular pump) for 6 h. No loss of crystallinity could be observed under the polarization microscope. X-Ray data sets were collected for single crystals from each of these dried samples. Structure solution and the quality of reﬁnement was identical to the one from the unheated crystal probe (see ESI†), the crystal water was still present in the framework. Crystal-to-crystal transformations A crystalline sample of 1 was ﬁltered off within 1 min in air, then freeze dried at −5 ◦C (ice bath with NaCl) and 10−4 mbar for 8 h. A blue-green crystalline product 2 was obtained (eqn (2)) (2) which was stored at −20 ◦C under N2 until investigated by single- crystal X-ray crystallography. A crystalline sample of 3 was placed in a simultaneous thermoanalysis apparatus (STA 409 from Netzsch). The probe chamber was evacuated to 2 mbar and then reﬁlled with N2. After that the sample was heated to 280 ◦C with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 (eqn (3)). (3) The still crystalline product 4 was transferred directly to the X-ray diffractometer. Careful control of the evacuation or heating procedure allowed the largely dehydrated products 2 and 4 to be obtained as single- crystals, suitable for X-ray diffraction. Both transformations from 1 to 2 and from 3 to 4 represent rare cases of solid-state reactions with crystal-to-crystal transformations.42 The almost complete dehydrations appear to be irreversible transformations.

Each btre ligand connects four nickel atoms and each btc3−ligand bridges between three symmetry related Ni1 atoms (Fig. 1a). The Ni1 atoms and the btc ligands alone form parallelepipedic 4,4 (42) nets parallel to the bc-plane (Fig. 2a). Also, the Ni atoms and the btre ligands form parallelepipedic 4,4 nets parallel to bc (Fig. 2b). Along the a-direction these nets alternate and connect with each other through the Ni atoms and aqua bridges (Fig. 2c). The bridging action of the two different ligands in 1 gives rise to a 3D framework with large water-ﬁlled channels along a (Fig. 3). From structure reﬁnement of the electron density in these channels, thermogravimetric analysis and the available channel volume (from PLATON) about 22 disordered water molecules of crystallization are estimated per Ni3 formula unit. In the absence of the water of crystallization the potential solvent volume is 1621 A˚ 3 per unit cell volume of 3115.8 A˚ 3 (= 52%). With the expected volume for a hydrogen-bonded H2O molecule of ∼40 A˚ 3 this agrees with 44 H2O molecules per unit cell (2 formula units) or 22 H2O per Ni3 formula unit. An experimental nitrogen adsorption study on an evacuated sample (after 3 d at 50 ◦C) indicated some minor porosity with a BET surface area of about 400 m2 g−1.† This minor porosity is closer to the potential solvent volume calculated in compound 2 (see below) in the absence of the water of crystallization as 196 A˚ 3 (10% of the unit cell volume of 1937 A˚ 3).

The main difference between 1 and 2 in the Ni3 unit is the replacement of one of the three coordinating btc3−ligands on Ni1 in 1 by a terminal aqua ligand (O8) in 2. In 2 the btc3−ligand bridges only between two symmetry related Ni1 atoms.

The Ni atoms and the btre ligands still form 4,4 nets, albeit strongly distorted (Fig. 4b).

The bridging action of the two different ligands in 3 gives rise to a 3D-framework with water-ﬁlled channels in-between the {0 2 −4}-planes (Fig. 8). Two hydrogen-bonded water molecules of crystallization are found per Zn3 formula unit. In the absence of the water of crystallization the potential solvent volume is 94 A˚ 3 per unit cell volume of 1394.1 A˚ 3 (= 7%) (calculated with PLATON). All hydrogen atoms of the aqua ligands and water of crystallization are engaged in normal hydrogen-bonding interactions (see ESI†). Crystal structure of 3 ∞{[Zn3(l6-btc)2(l4-btre)2]·∼0.67H2O}, 4 The dehydrated product no longer has aqua ligands at the central zinc atom of the trinuclear unit. Instead, btc-carboxylate groups from the adjacent Zn-btc layers now occupy the positions of the Fig. 9 Packing analysis for 4 by differentiation in individual (a) {Zn-btc}-nets and (b) {Zn2-btre}-strands. former aqua ligands in 3 (Fig. 6a and b). These carboxylate groups also bridge between Zn1 and Zn2. Furthermore, two carboxylate groups now bridge between neighboring, symmetry related Zn1 atoms. In 4 every carboxylate group bridges two zinc atoms. Thus, the btc ligand connects six zinc atoms now. The Zn-btc substructure becomes a 3D framework (2D in 3) (Fig. 9a). The Zn2 atoms and btre ligands still form strands (Fig. 9b). The overall packing is rather dense. Some residual electron density can be reﬁned to ∼2/3 of a crystal water molecule per Zn3 unit. The crystal-to-crystal transition from 3 to 4 is a concerted motion of units which involves breakage and new formation of Zn–O bonds and which is difﬁcult to follow in these 3D-frameworks. The bond reformation is due to the known lability of Zn–ligand bonds. When going from 3 with 2 Zn3 to 4 with 1 Zn3 fragments per unit cell the comparative volume is reduced from 1394.1 to 2 × 609.7 A˚ 3 or to 87%. Magnetic properties of 1 (air-dried sample) The thermal dependence of vMT (vM being the magnetic suscep- tibility per mol of Ni3) for the title complex in the temperature range 1.9–300 K is shown in Fig. 10. The value of vMT at room temperature (3.25 cm3 mol−1 K) corresponds to what is expected for three non-interacting single-ion triplet states.46 On cooling, the vMT value decreases to reach a plateau between 10 and 5 K, with values around 1.10 cm3 mol−1 K (this corresponds to a S = 1 spin state, g = 2.11) and ﬁnally decreases to 0.88 cm3 mol−1 K at 1.9 K. These features are typical for antiferromagnetically coupled high-spin Ni3 systems with weak antiferromagnetic inter-trimer interactions or zero-ﬁeld-splitting (zfs). This behavior leads to This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008 Dalton Trans., 2008, 1734–1744 | 1739 Downloaded by Georgetown University Library on 27/04/2013 15:41:47.

The solid line is the best ﬁt to eqn (6), see text. The insert corresponds to the M vs H plot at 2 K. a S = 1 ground state, that corresponds to the plateau reached between 5–10 K in the vMT vs T plot, also observed in the M vs H plot, shown in the insert of Fig. 10. For such a system the magnetic exchange interactions are usually described by the isotropic Hamiltonian (eqn (4)) ˆH = −J( ˆS1 ˆS2 + ˆS2 ˆS3) −j ˆS1 ˆS3) (4) where J and j represent the exchange coupling constant between neighboring and terminal ions, respectively.46 In the absence of a clear exchange-pathway between terminal ions j is taken as zero, and the Eigenvalues are then given by eqn (5) E(SA, ST) = −J 2 [ST(ST + 1) −SA(SA + 1)] (5) where SA is the spin quantum number associated with the spins S1 + S3 and ST is the total spin. SA takes the values 2, 1 and 0, whereas ST takes values from |SA + 1| to |SA −1|. The ground state is found to be |SA = 2, ST = 1>. The introduction of the Zeeman term and the application of Van Vleck’s approach to these energy levels give the analytical expression for the susceptibility (eqn (6)): vM = Nb 2g2 k(T −H)  2 + 12x2 + 2x3 + 10x4 + 28x5 3 + x + 8x2 + 3x3 + 5x4 + 7x5  (6) N stands for Avogadro’s number, g the Land´e factor, b the Bohr magneton, k the Boltzman’s constant and x = eJ/kT. At low temperatures an isolated trinuclear complex should follow the Curie law. But we have mentioned that below 5 K the vMT values for 1 lie below the theoretical values for a spin triplet. This suggests that other kinds of magnetic effect take place among the trinuclear units at low temperatures; these have been taken into account by the introduction of a Weiss-like parameter (H) in eqn (6). [A zfs of the S = 1 spin state would also lead to a decrease of the vMT values at low temperatures, however the determination of D from polycrystalline samples is not very accurate47 and implies an important complication in the calculations, so we have considered this decrease in vMT as attributbale to intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions and we give a maximum value.] Best least-squares ﬁt of the magnetic susceptibility data of compound 1 to eqn (6) gave the parameters: g = 2.14(1), J = −13.88(8) cm−1, h = −0.34(2) K and R = 0.9995. The calculated curve matches very well the experimental data over the whole temperature range, as can be seen in Fig. 10. Antiferromagnetic interactions in N1,N2 triazole-bridged Ni(II) complexes have been previously observed with J-values that range from −16 to −22.2 cm−1.46 The J-value observed for 1 is not far from those previously reported, indicating that the substituents in the triazole ligands do not affect to a large extent the magnetic coupling among the Ni(II) ions. Emission properties of 3 The zinc compound 3 shows a strong ﬂuorescence emission at 423 nm upon excitation at 323 nm (Fig. 11). The benzene- 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid has no ﬂuorescence and 1,2-bis(1,2,4- triazol-4-yl)ethane (btre) gives no ﬂuorescence response at room temperature. Thus, zinc coordination of the btre ligand leads to a strong enhancement in ﬂuorescence. An increase in ﬂuorescence intensity is often seen in luminescence studies of zinc, cadmium and silver coordination polymers.1,48,49 Fig. 11 Excitation and emission spectrum of compound 3. Conclusions The ligand combination of 1,2-bis(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)ethane (btre) and fully deprotonated benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (btc3−) leads to trinculear secondary building blocks with nickel and zinc cations within 3D metal–organic frameworks. The nickel atoms in the Ni3 unit are antiferromagnetically coupled. Incorporated crystal water and also aqua ligands for Zn can largely be removed through freeze drying for the Ni and carefully controlled heating for the Zn compound to give the dehydrated products as single crystals in a solid-state single-crystal-to-single-crystal transition. The dehydration involves considerable restructuring of the framework with a decrease of the unit cell volume to 60% for Ni and Zn–O bond breakage and new formation for Zn. Zinc coordination to the btre ligand turns on a luminescence response upon UV excitation (not seen in the free ligand). Experimental Commercially available solvents, monoformylhydrazine, triethyl orthoformate, ethylenediamine, benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (H3btc), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were used without further puriﬁcation. The ligand 1,2-bis(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)ethane (btre) was prepared according to the method of Bayer et al.50 1740 | Dalton Trans., 2008, 1734–1744 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008 Downloaded by Georgetown University Library on 27/04/2013 15:41:47.

Elemental analyses were performed on a VarioEL from Elemen- taranalysensysteme GmbH. Infrared spectra were recorded in the range 400–4000 cm−1 on a Bruker Optik IFS 25 spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out in a simultaneous thermoanalysis apparatus STA 409C from Netzsch under nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 ◦C min−1 in the range 50 to 600 ◦C. The ﬁlled sample container was conditioned by ﬁrst applying oil pump vacuum down to 1 bar for 5 min, then ﬂushing with nitrogen, except for the TGA of compound 1. A porosity measurement for a dried sample of 1 was carried out on Quantachrome Autosorb automated gas sorption system. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were measured at ambient temperature using a STOE STADI-P with Debye-Scherrer geometry, Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.7093 A˚ ), a Ge(111) monochromator with the samples in glass capillaries on a rotating probe head. Simulated powder patterns were based on single-crystal data and calculated using the STOE WinXPOW software package.51 Theoretical porosity calculations for the potential solvent volume in the solvent-depleted structures were carried out with PLATON.52 Emission spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS-55, kexc = 323 nm, split widths (em, ex) 5.0 nm, scan speed 2 nm s−1, solid sample at room temperature. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on polycrystalline sam- ples were carried out in the temperature range 1.9–300 K by means of a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer operating at 1000 Oe (T < 15 K) and 10000 Oe (T > 15 K). Diamagnetic corrections of the constituent atoms were estimated from Pascal’s constants as −430 × 10−6 cm3 mol−1 for 1. Experimental susceptibilities were also corrected for the temperature-independent paramagnetism [100 × 10−6 cm3 mol−1 per Ni(II)] and the magnetization of the sample holder.

X-Ray crystallography Suitable single crystals were carefully selected under a polarizing microscope. Data Collection. Bruker AXS with APEXII CCD area- detector, Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ), graphite monochro- mator, double-pass method x-scan, data collection and cell reﬁne- ment with SMART,53 data reduction with SAINT,53 experimental absorption correction with SADABS.54 Structure analysis and reﬁnement. The structure was solved by direct methods (SHELXS-97);55 reﬁnement was done by full- matrix least squares on F 2 using the SHELXL-97 program suite.55 All non-hydrogen positions were found and reﬁned with anisotropic temperature factors. Hydrogen atoms on the aromatic rings and the carbon atoms were placed at calculated positions with an appropriate riding model (AFIX 43 for aromatic CH, AFIX 23 for CH2) and an isotropic temperature factor of U eq(H) = 1.2 U eq(CH, CH2). In 1 the hydrogen atoms on the crystal water molecules were neither found nor reﬁned. The crystal water in 1 is only given by its oxygen atoms. Some of the disordered oxygen atoms of the water of crystallization were reﬁned isotropically with “anti-bumping” restraints (BUMP −0.02). If the sum of occupancies of the two atoms is less than 1.1, no restraint is generated. The occupancies of all 17 crystal water O atom positions were reﬁned simultaneously until the very last reﬁnement cycles. Occupancies reﬁned between about 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, 0.90 and 1.000. In the last reﬁnement cycles these occupancies were then kept ﬁxed at these rounded values, which summed to 22 O atoms per Ni3 formula unit. Any short inter D · · · A contacts (< 2.5 A˚ ) between crystal water O atoms which are still listed by CheckCif were viewed as a time-averaged disordered water structure. This disorder is also a manifestation of high mobility and dynamic behavior among the crystal solvent molecules. At a given moment only one out of two partly occupied O atoms will really be present at their position. Hence, if some of these partly occupied reﬁned O atoms are removed, such that the remaining O · · · O contacts are longer than 2.7–2.8 A˚ , these remaining O atom positions would then represent a real picture of the hydrogen-bonded crystal water phase at this moment.56 The crystal-to-crystal transformation upon dehydration from 1 to 2 is not perfect as evidenced by the crystal of 2 diffracting only to 2h = 39.8◦. Still, all atoms in 2 could be unequivocally found and reﬁned, including the H atoms on the aqua ligands. Only the core atoms, that is nickel and its directly bound atoms, were reﬁned anisotropically in 2. The remaining non-hydrogen atoms were only reﬁned isotropically because of the otherwise too low reﬂection-to-parameter ratio.

This resulted, however, in larger and more anisotropic temperature factors of various atoms and somewhat higher R-values. Several atoms have large maximum and minimum main axis ADP ratios (Angstrom Units) which may indicate unresolved disorder and result in prolate appearance of the ellipsoid. Large Ueq(max)/Ueq(min) ratios are found for different atoms types.
