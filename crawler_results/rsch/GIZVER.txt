Manuscript Three coordination polymers with helical chains based on methylenediisophthalic acid (H4MDIP)†‡ Xianying Duan, Xian Cheng, Jianguo Lin, Shuangquan Zang, Yizhi Li, Chengjian Zhu and Qingjin Meng* Received 13th August 2007, Accepted 4th January 2008 First published as an Advance Article on the web 18th February 2008 DOI: 10.1039/b712319a Based on methylenediisophthalic acid (H4MDIP), three novel coordination polymers {[Mn2(MDIP)(bime)(H2O)2]2$2H2O}n (1) [bime ¼ 1,2-ethanediylbis(imidazole)], {[Mn3(HMDIP)2(H2O)4]$4,40-bipy$3H2O}n (2) [4,40-bipy ¼ 4,40-bipyridine], and {[Co5(MDIP)2(H2O)6(m-OH)2]$7H2O}n (3) have been synthesized and characterized by IR spectra, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses and thermal stability studies. The introduction of the bime and 4,40-bipy ligands into Mn(CH3COO)2$4H2O and H4MDIP system leads to the formation of complexes 1 and 2, and the absence of the second ligand in the Co(NO3)2$6H2O and H4MDIP system leads to shape complex 3. Complex 1 is a 3D architecture with [Mn(–OCO–)]N helical chain. Coordination polymer 2 is a 2D sheet structure with trinuclear unit, in which two kinds of 21 helical chains ([Mn(IP)]N (IP ¼ isophthalic acid) and [Mn(MDIP)]N) are included. Complex 3 exhibits the 3D porous structure with a pentanuclear cobalt unit in which a 1D shallow helical chain of hydrogen-bonded water molecules is shaped. From the topology point of view, complex 1 exhibits a (4,6)-connected network with the Schla¨ﬂi symbol (42.63.8)2(44.62.74.84.9), complex 2 displays a (3,6)-connected network with CdI2 topology, and complex 3 displays a (4, 8)-connected network with Schla¨ﬂi symbol (44.62)2(416.612) which is a decorated scu net. Introduction Because of the existence of a large variety of new architectures with potential applications in such areas as catalysis, optoelec- trics, separation, gas storage and sensors, the investigation of organic–inorganic hybrid frameworks based on polydentate carboxylate ligands has been a ﬁeld of rapid growth.1 Until now, di-,2 tri-,3 or tetracarboxylates4–6 have been widely used to construct novel coordination frameworks. With regard to tetracarboxylate acid and its complexes, the previous results show that they are excellent candidates for forming helix, metal cluster and porous structures.4b,5,6 Helical structures are ubiqui- tous in nature and are the foundation of the genetic code.7–11 Studying architectures with helical structures is very important in biological systems, optical devices and asymmetric catalysis and so on. Recently in the ﬁeld of chemistry, much effort has been devoted to the design of helical coordination polymers through the self-assembly of ligands and metal cations.9,10,12 Much work has been carried out in our group.5 Following our previous studies, in this research we choose tetracarboxylate acid, methylenediisophthalic acid (H4MDIP) as the organic ligand, and considerations are: ﬁrst, being an asymmetrically ‘V’-shaped ligand, it may allow the induction of a dissymmetric unit when coordinating with metal atoms, which may improve the helicity of polymeric chains and thus favor the formation of a helical structure; secondly, H4MDIP multiple bridging moieties, a variety of connection modes with metal centers are possible and provide abundant structural motifs; lastly, coordi- nation polymers constructed from the H4MDIP ligand have rarely been reported, and much work is still necessary to under- stand the coordination chemistry of H4MDIP. With the above idea in mind, in this paper we present the syntheses and crystal structures of three novel complexes based on the H4MDIP ligand. Bime (1,2-ethanediylbis(imidazole), see Scheme 1) as the second ligand in {[Mn2(MDIP)(bime) (H2O)2]2$2H2O}n (1), coordinates to the metal center to form a mononuclear-centered, 3D framework with [Mn(–OCO–)]N helical chain. 4,40-Bipy (4,40-bipyridine) molecules as a template constitute a 2D sheet structure with the trinuclear cluster in {[Mn3(HMDIP)2(H2O)4]$bipy$3H2O}n 2, which contains two Scheme 1 Schematic drawing of H4MDIP and bime.

With the absence of second ligand in complex 3 {[Co5(MDIP)2(H2O)6(m-OH)2]$7H2O}n, 3D porous architecture with pentanuclear cobalt cluster is shaped, and one-dimensional shallow helical chains of hydrogen-bonded water molecules are included in it. Experimental General procedures and instruments Methylenediisophthalic acid (H4MDIP) was synthesized accor- ding to the literature.13 The bime [1,2-ethanediylbis(imidazole)] ligand was prepared by a previously reported procedure.14 All other starting materials were of reagent quality and obtained from commercial sources without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. The IR spectra were obtained as KBr disks on a VECTOR 22 spectrometer. Thermal analyses were performed on a TGA V5.1A Dupont 2100 instrument from room tempera- ture to 700 C with a heating rate of 10 C per min in a nitrogen environment. Calculated patterns of 1–3 were generated with PowderCell. General X-ray crystallography† Single crystals suitable for X-ray analyses were used on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer using graphite-mono- chromatized Mo Ka radiation (l ¼ 0.71073 A˚ ) at room tempe- rature using the u-scan technique. Lorentz polarization and absorption corrections were applied. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned with the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 programs.15 Anisotropic thermal parameters were assigned to all non-hydro- gen atoms. Crystal data and details of the structural determina- tions for complexes 1–3 are listed in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 2. Hydrogen bonds and angles are listed in the ESI.‡ Preparation {[Mn2(MDIP)(bime)(H2O)2]2$2H2O}n (1). 1 was synthesized hydrothermally in a 25 ml Teﬂon-lined autoclave by heating a 10 ml aqueous mixture of 0.1 mmol H4MDIP, 0.1 mmol bime, 0.2 mmol Mn(CH3COO)2$4H2O and one drop of triethyl- amine (Et3N) at 120 C for 3 days.

View Article Online Results and discussion Characterization In the IR spectrum of complex 2, the characteristic bands observed at around 1700 cm1 are attributed to the protonated carboxylic groups, indicating the incomplete deprotonation of H4MDIP. The absence of such bands in complexes 1 and 3 indicates the complete deprotonation of H4MDIP. All this agrees well with the result of X-ray single-crystal analyses.† Strong absorption bands between 1350 and 1630 cm1 in the IR spectra of complexes 1–3 can be assigned to the coordinated carboxylate groups.16 Crystal structures {[Mn2(MDIP)(bime)(H2O)2]2$2H2O}n (1).

The octahedrally-coordinated Mn atom is directly ligated by two O atoms from one chelating carboxylate group, two O atoms from two bis-mono carboxylate groups, one N atom from one bime, and one O atom from one water molecule. The Mn–O bond lengths range over 2.088(3)–2.238(3) A˚ and the Mn–N bond distance is 2.165(4) A˚ . Seen from Fig. 2a along the (111) direction, the 1D metal- carboxylate [Mn(–OCO–)]N helical chain came into being by the nonlinear ﬂexibility around the center between bis-mono carboxylates and (O1/C8/O2)-connecting Mn atoms. The winding axis corresponds to the b axis with the pitch length of 8.67 A˚ . Notably the dihedral angle between the carboxylate (O1/C8/O2) and the attached benzene ring 48.2, effectively contributing to the helical formation. The adjacent Mn/Mn separation along this chain is 5.62 A˚ . Adjacent [Mn(–OCO–)]N chains are joined together through MIP-chelating (MIP ¼ methylisophthalic acid) carboxylates with the metal centers to be 2D [Mn(MIP)]N layer. As a result, the left-handed and right-handed chains coexist in one layer and the [Mn(MIP)]N layer does not exhibit chirality. Along the b-direction 2D [Mn(MIP)]N layer [Fig. 2a bottom] connections are accomplished through methylene groups and bime to show a 3D neutral framework, and disordered water molecules reside in the 1D channel shaped by one MDIP and one bime [Fig. 2b]. The dihedral angle between two phenyl rings of MDIP is 80.14. In the ab plane, due to the bending effect of MDIP methylene groups, the 3D [Mn2(MDIP)]N framework displays a rhombic structure, and trans-bime molecules are in a diagonal arrangement [Fig. S2].‡ In addition, O–H/O hydro- gen bonds exist among the aqua ligands with the coordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms, O5/O3#1 (#1: x, y + 1, z) with distance 2.750 (4) A˚ (Table S1).‡ Considering the coordination modes of MDIP4, which is linked six times to the metal center, it can be viewed as a six- connected node, and the metal atom Mn is viewed as a four- connected node, thus as seen in Fig. 2c the (4,6) topology with the short Schla¨ﬂi symbol of (42.63.8)2(44.62.74.84.9)17 could be observed. As far as we know, this topology is completely new within coordination polymer chemistry. The discovery of this new topology is useful at the basic level in the crystal engineering of coordination networks. {[Mn3(HMDIP)2(H2O)4]$bipy$3H2O}n (2). A single-crystal X-ray diffraction study† reveals that coordination polymer 2 crystallizes in the space group P21/c and the asymmetry unit contains three crystallographically independent manganese atoms, two HMDIP3 ligands, one free 4,40-bipy molecule and four coordinated and three disordered free water molecules [Fig. S3].‡ The coordination environment of Mn1 is represented in Fig. 3a. In addition to two coordinated water molecules (O17, O18), the Mn1 octahedron coordination environment is ﬁnished by two bis-mono carboxylates and one chelating-mono carbox- ylate. Mn2 is in the center of trinuclear unit and is octahedrally coordinated by four O atoms from four bis-mono carboxylates and two O atoms from two chelating-mono carboxylates. Mn3 has a similar coordination environment with Mn1. The Mn–O distances range over 2.094(3)–2.332(3) A˚ , with Mn/Mn separa- tions among this trinuclear unit being 3.60 and 3.66 A˚ , and the angle of Mn1/Mn2/Mn3 being 176.94. The dihedral angles between two benzene rings of MDIP are 70.09 and 72.31 respec- tively. Polymer 2 consists of trinuclear units with trigonal antiprismatic geometry and each trinuclear connects six HMDIP3 ligands [Fig. S4].‡ Fig. 2 (a) View of the 2D [Mn(MIP)]N layer constructed by [Mn(–OCO–)]N chains in the (111) plane (up) and b direction (bottom) of complex 1.

View Article Online This trinuclear 2D structure can be seen as two planes ([Mn1(MDIP)]N and [Mn3(MDIP)]N) connected by Mn2 atoms, in which protonated carboxylates are extending outside such layer in the c direction [Fig. 3b]. In the [Mn1(MDIP)]N plane, a fascinating feather structure is the alternative arrange- ment of two types of helical chains along b axis to form a chiral plane [Fig. 3c]. One left-handed helix [Mn1(IP)]N (IP ¼ iso- phthalic) is formed by IP carboxylates between Mn1 atoms. The right-handed [Mn1(MDIP)]N helix is formed by the carbox- ylates at the syn position of the other MDIP between Mn1 centers. Both of the two helices are generated around the crystal- lographic 21 axis with the pitch length of 15.597 A˚ . Although [Mn3(MDIP)]N plane shows the opposite helicals with [Mn1(MDIP)]N plane, due to the crystallographically indepen- dent Mn1 and Mn3 together with related MDIP ligands, the whole 2D [Mn3(MDIP)]N layer is chiral. As shown in Fig. 3b, the free 4,40-bipy ligands acting as guest molecules and templates populate the rectanglular void constructed by adjacent trinuclear units in the a direction. The two pyridine rings of the guest 4,40-bipy molecule are twisted around each other with dihedral angle 39.35. The offset face- to-face stacking through p–p interactions between the pyridine ring of 4,40-bipy and the relative phenyl ring of MDIP (center- to-center) is 3.60, 3.80, 3.91 A˚ , with the dihedral angle of 9.47, 24.47, 6.77, and such an effect is greatly attributable to the stability of the 2D structure [Fig. S5].‡ Adjacent layers are held together through hydrogen bonds (Table S1)‡ between free water molecules and the uncoordinated carboxylates into a 3D architecture. Interestingly, the two types of chiral layers coexist to generate a mesomeric 3D architecture [Fig. S6].‡ Since three carboxylates take part in the coordination, from a topology view the HMDIP3 ligand can be viewed as 3-connected nodes and the trinuclear moieties connecting six HMDIP3 ligands act as the 6-connected nodes. In this way this framework can be simpliﬁed to be a (3,6)-connected network with the CdI2 topology [Fig. 3d], and the other name is kgd (Kagome´ dual), Fig. 3 (a) The coordination environment of Mn1 with ORTEP drawing (ellipsoids at 50% probability) in complex 2.

To the best of our knowledge, except for several examples of metal alkoxides and hydroxides, few organic–inorganic hybrid materials have been reported with such a net topology.18 This 2D topology can be deﬁned with the Schla¨ﬂi symbol of (43)2(46.66.83). The Mn–O and Mn–N bonds distances in complexes 1–2 are comparable to those of related complexes,19 suggesting the manganese asymmetric coordination environment in terms of diversities of bond strength. {[Co5(MDIP)2(H2O)6(m-OH)2]$7H2O}n (3). Single-crystal X-ray analysis† shows that this structure contains a pentanu- clear, Co5(m3-OH)2 cluster in which two triangle units share a common vertex (Co3) [Fig. 4]. In each triangle there is a m3-OH (O1), which is held together by bis-mono and chela- ting-mono carboxylates around three crystallographically distinct Co atoms. Three Co centers adopt an octahedral geometry with Co–O distances 1.976(4)–2.286(3) A˚ and the non-bonding Co/Co distances of 3.262–3.581 A˚ . The Co–O distances in this complex are also comparable to the reported values.4a Co1 is coordinated by four O atoms from three carbox- ylates, in addition to one O atom from a m3-OH and one O atom from a water molecule. Co2 is ligated by one O atom from one m3-OH atom, two O atoms from two water molecules and three O atoms from two carboxylates. Both of the coordination geom- etries of Co1 and Co2 show some distortion. The coordination environment of Co3 is ﬁnished by four O atoms from four bis-mono carboxylates, and two from two m3-OH atoms. Each pentanuclear metal cluster is surrounded by eight MDIP4 ligands to deﬁne an eight-connected node exhibiting distorted parallelepiped geometry [Fig. S7].‡ As shown in Fig. 5a, along the a direction isophthalic carboxylates link adjacent pentanu- clear clusters, and the structural extension is ﬁnished by MDIP4 methylene groups in the c direction. In this way the whole struc- ture displays a 3D porous framework. The dihedral angle between two benzene rings of MDIP is 68.21. It should be noticed that there are face-to-face p–p interactions in the b direction between two MDIP rings connecting the metal centers (center-to-center distance is 3.77 A˚ ) with a dihedral angle of 13.00 [Fig. S8].‡ Along the b axis, in this complex there are two kinds of 1D channel that are arranged alternately in an ABAB motif and both of them are occupied by water molecules [Fig. 5a]. The total solvent volume in the lattice is about 288.1 A˚ 3 (13.6% of the unit cell) by the calculation using the PLATON20 suite of programs. O14 and disordered O16 water molecules reside in the A channel, shaped by a Co5 cluster and isophthalic acids with dimensions of approximately 7.83  7.89 A˚ (based on the symmetry unit). Water molecules (O13, O15) are located in the B channel shaped by a Co5 cluster and MDIP with maximum dimensions of approximately 9.94  6.40 A˚ (based on the symmetry unit). There are hydrogen bonds between bridging carboxylates and coordinated water molecule, O14/O10#1 (#1: x + 1, y, z + 1) in A channel, O13/O2#2 (#2: x + 0.5, y + 0.5, z + 0.5) in the B-type channel. In the B channel as shown in Fig. 5b, along the b direction the lattice water molecules are found to be in a shallow helical fashion O13–H13D/O15–H15C/O13 with a helical pitch of 8.46 A˚ , showing hydrogen bonding interactions. In the c direction an opposite helical orientation to the former helix of the same adjacent channel can be observed. The angles O13/O15/ O13#3 and O15/O13#3/O15#3 (#3: 1.5  x, 0.5 + y, 0.5 + z) in the helix are 104.9 and 134.6. The unit cell packing diagram shows the presence of two helical water chains located along the b axis, and the helices exhibit both left- and right- handness in a 1 : 1 ratio. In addition, through O13–H13C/ O2#1 (carboxyl) hydrogen bonds, the one-dimensional B chan- nel acts as a host to stabilize the water chain. The helix water is similar with that has been observed.21,5d The helical water chain may come from the different coordination environment of Co1 and Co3 and further leads to the slight twisting of MDIP. If each Co5 unit can be deﬁned as an eight-connected node and MDIP as a four-connected node, this framework can be simpli- ﬁed to be a seldom reported (4,8) net,22 with Schla¨ﬂi symbol (44.62)2(416.612) topology [Fig. 5c], and this one is quite deformed from the maximum symmetry embedding of the scu Fig. 4 ORTEP drawing (ellipsoids at 50% probability) with the atom-labeling scheme of complex 3.

View Article Online net [Fig. S9]‡,22b which is also the case for the decorated scu net. As shown in complex 1, the coordination effect of the second ligand bime may prevent the formation of a cluster. The trinu- clear cluster in 2 is shaped with the free 4,40-bipy molecules. With the absence of a coligand, a pentanuclear cluster of complex 3 is shaped. Comparing their structures between 2 and 3, two similar phenomena could be observed. First, polynu- clear cluster units are included. Second, both the lattice water molecules (complex 3) and the free 4,40-bipy coligand (complex 2) can be regarded as templates that play an important role in the formation of the coordination polymers. In all, MDIP carboxylate groups adopt three kinds of coordi- nation modes in 1–3, the bis-mono, bis-chelating, and chelating- mono coordination motif, as represented in Scheme 1 in the ESI.‡ In addition to bis-mono coordination modes in 1–3, the bis-chelating coordination mode lies in 1, the chelating-mono coordination motif lies in 2 and the bis-mono and chelating- mono coordination motifs exist in 3. It should be noticed that the chelating-mono coordination motif leads to the multinuclear cluster in complexes 2 and 3. The trinuclear units in 2 serve as heptacoordination nodes, in 3 pentanuclear units act as octa- coordination nodes, and all serve as the second building block of the resulting framework. So far, a variety of uninodal networks have been reported.23 The topology of complexes 1–3 represented the rare reported mixed connectivity (4,6), (3,6) and (4,8)-connected frameworks.22a,24,25 In 1 and 2, the ligand MDIP connects six metal centers, and in 3 it connects seven metal centers. The diverse coordination modes of MDIP make the structure’s complicated helix chains lie in 1–3 complexes. In 1 the helical chain is exclusively formed by the metal–carboxylate groups with the 1D [Mn(–OCO–)]N helical chain, while in 2 with a 2D chiral sheet structure, two kinds of 21 helical chains ([Mn(IP)]N and [Mn(MDIP)]N) are included. The 3D porous structure with the pentanuclear cobalt cluster of 3 contains a shallow helical water chain. By inspection of the feather structures of 1–3, it is believed that the V-shaped MDIP ligand and the V-shaped isophthalic groups of MDIP are important for the formation of the helical structures, which conﬁrms that the employment of V-shaped organic bridges could improve the helicity of polymeric chains.4b,7a,9a Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of complexes 1–3 The thermogravimetric analyses of complexes 1–3 were carried out from room temperature to 700 C under a nitrogen atmosphere and the Figures are given in the ESI [Fig. S10].‡ The TG curve of complex 1 displays two events between 25 and 750 C. The ﬁrst event before 220 C corresponded to the loss of water molecules (observed, 9.0%; calculated, 8.1%). The second event occurred above 410 C. For complex 2, the ﬁrst event before 340 C corresponded to the release of lattice water molecules and free 4,40-bipy molecules (observed, 17.21%; Fig. 5 (a) 3D network representation of complex 3 in the ac plane with two kinds of channels with an ABAB stacking motif.

The TG curve of complex 3, with the increase of temperature, guest and coordinated water molecules (calculated, 18.8%; observed, 18.1%) are released slowly and show one-step weight loss till 430 C. When samples 1–3 are heated at 150 and 300 C for 2 h under an N2 environ- ment, PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) results show that complexes 1–2 retained their structures while complex 3 does not retain its structure [Fig. S11].‡ Conclusions This present work demonstrates that the ligand H4MDIP together with the transition metal cation and the second ligands can be assembled to produce various kinds of architectures. Three different structures derived from the self-assembly of MDIP and coligand (bime, 4,40-bipy) with cobalt and manganese centers were analyzed by X-ray diffraction.† In 1 bime acts as the coligand and the 3D structure features the 1D helical chain, which is exclusively formed by the carboxylates and the metal centers. The second ligand 4,40-bipy in 2 as template constitutes a 2D layer framework with the trinuclear cluster. Two kinds of 21 helical chains are included in complex 2, one of isophthalic groups with the metal center, and the other of the whole MDIP with the metal center. With the absence of the second ligand in 3, a 3D porous framework with a pentanuclear cobalt cluster is shaped, in which a 1D shallow helical water chain is included. These results demonstrated that H4MDIP could serve as a ﬂexible ligand to construct novel supramolecular architec- tures. Further investigation is ongoing.
