The seemingly rigid pillared-layer framework also undergoes temperature- induced, time-dependent, hysteretic framework distortion. Porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have received mush- rooming attention owing to their intriguing properties,1 especially the framework ﬂexibility, where the host framework structure can change in response to an external stimulus.2 Many types of reversible and irreversible structural changes, such as shrink- age and expansion,3 distortion,4 sliding,5 ligand exchange,6 and even catenation rearrangement,7 have been reported. However, the exploration is generally based only on measure- ments of the crystal structures of the initial and ﬁnal states. The kinetics or detailed pathway of the structural change is still rarely investigated.8 Unlike the controllable molecule-level step-by-step organic syntheses, supramolecular PCPs were usually obtained by one- pot reactions, in which the assembly processes or mechanisms are extremely diﬃcult to be experimentally observed and clariﬁed due to the current technological limitation. A few types of PCPs have been proposed to be assembled in a step-by-step approach.9 For example, the secondary building unit (SBU) strategy adopts organic ligands to link the preformed discrete clusters to speciﬁc topological nets (net- based approach). However, the formation of discrete SBUs has been scarcely monitored during the crystal-growth process.10 Pillared-layer PCPs (Scheme 1) are regarded as another type of structure constructed by multi-step assembly, in which the two- dimensional (2D) layers are ﬁrst built from 0D molecular building blocks, which are further pillared by exo-bidentate ligands into the ﬁnal 3D architecture. Although the pillared-layer approach has been successfully used for the construction of PCPs,11 the initially formed (or non-pillared) 2D layer and a subsequent layer-by-layer growth process have not been directly observed so far. Herein, we report the interesting self-assembly and properties of a ﬂexible pillared-layer PCP, including the identiﬁcation of two 2D intermediate non-pillared and pillared structures and an intriguing single-crystal to single-crystal (SCSC) structural transformation cycle with a temperature hysteresis. In the reaction of Cd(NO3)2, 2-nitro-1,4-benzene-dicarboxylic acid (H2nbdc), and pyrazine (pyz) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature, crystals of [Cd2(nbdc)2(pyz)2] 4DMF (3, MCF-33) started to deposit after ca. 3 weeks. Inter- estingly, in the initial period a few crystals of [Cd2(nbdc)2(DMF)4] 2DMF (1, ca. 5–7 days) and [Cd2(nbdc)2(pyz)(DMF)2]3DMF (2, ca. 2 weeks) were isolated and have been characterized by single-crystal diﬀraction. Parallel experiments showed that 1 and 2 only occasionally appeared in a few cases among many trials, indicating that their crystallization may be aﬀected by some Scheme 1 Principles of the self-assembly of a pillared-layer structure. a MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinorganic and Synthetic Chemistry, State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.

Powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) patterns of the ﬁnal products did not exhibit observable signals of 1 or 2. When higher reactant concentrations were used, 3 could be obtained in a shorter time without the observation of 1 or 2. These facts imply that both 1 and 2 should be unstable intermediates and can be easily transformed into 3, or should have extremely low yields and can be hardly detected from large amounts of 3. Crystal structure of 1 exhibits a 2D framework containing Cd2(RCOO)4(DMF)4 clusters as SBUs (Fig. 1).12 Each Cd atom adopts a distorted pentagonal-bipyramidal coordination environ- ment, in which the equatorial and apical positions are occupied by ﬁve oxygen atoms from three carboxylate groups and two oxygen atoms from two terminal DMF ligands, respectively. The two adjacent Cd atoms are bridged by two m-O atoms from two carboxylates into a SBU. These SBUs are extended through the nbdc2 ligands as linkers into a grid-like (sql topology) Cd(nbdc) layer with DMF molecules anchored on both sides. Crystal structure of 2 reveals dinuclear SBUs and 2D layers similar to those in 1. However, two of the four terminal DMF molecules, coordinated on the same side of the SBU, are replaced by two pyz ligands. Consequently, a pair of adjacent Cd(nbdc) layers are connected into a bilayer with the pyz ligands as pillars. The remaining terminal DMF molecules are anchored on the two outer sides of this bilayer. Although 3 also contains similar dinuclear SBUs and 2D layers found in 1 and 2, all the terminal DMF molecules are now replaced by bridging pyz ligands, resulting in a formal pillared-layer 3D framework with pcu topology. Consequently, 3 features 3D intersecting channels with 46% void, which are ﬁlled by solvated DMF molecules. The structures of 1–3 may represent the stepwise evolution of 3. It can be rationally speculated that, the Cd(II) ions in solution are originally coordinated by monodentate solvent molecules (DMF), which are rather labile compared with the bridging ligands, especially the anionic nbdc2. Therefore, the DMF molecules are ﬁrst substituted by the dicarboxylates, which linked the Cd(II) ions to a neutral Cd(nbdc) monolayer as observed in 1. Nevertheless, the monolayer should be still unstable when a strong ligand pyz is present. The terminal DMF molecules are then replaced by pyz ligands, which can serve as a template for the growth of the second Cd(nbdc) layer, leading to the formation of 2. Repeating this procedure would sequentially increase the number of layers and ﬁnally lead to the macroscopic crystals of 3. It should be noted that, when the number of layers (n) is small (e.g., n = 1, 2, 3, etc.), the corresponding species are too thin to be observed, and they can transform into the ﬁnal 3D structure very fast in the presence of suﬃcient pyz ligands. Interestingly, although 3 is constructed by rigid organic ligands, temperature-induced framework ﬂexibility was observed by SCSC transformations (Fig. 2). When 3 was cooled from 293 to 150 K, the lattice changed from orthorhombic (3) to monoclinic (30, b = 99.132(4)1) with a signiﬁcant change of an axial angle (rather than in the axial lengths), which reveals a drastic framework distortion. Actually, the Cd(nbdc) layers are not distorted, while the pillars become slanted in 30. More amazingly, when the crystal was warmed up back to 293 K, another monoclinic phase (300, b = 92.650(5)1) with a less slanted orientation of the pillars than for 30, rather than the original orthorhombic one, was captured. Therefore, 30 0 can be regarded as an intermediate between 30 and 3. Actually, 300 is Fig. 1 Framework and local coordination structures of 1–3.

Commun., 2012, 48, 133–135 135 unstable, being implied by the poorer diﬀraction data, and it can be completely transformed back into 3 after more than 3 hours without any further treatment. The temperature-induced (3 to 30 to 30 0) and time-dependent (30 0 to 3) SCSC transformation cycle represents an unprecedented structural dynamic phenomenon.13 The hysteretic behavior indicates that 3 has multiple metastable structural conformations and the transformation is slow. Attempt to further monitor the temperature- and time-dependent unit-cell parameters of 3 was not successful so far, because of the easy cracking behavior of single crystals of ﬂexible PCPs during the heating/cooling process.14 The framework thermal stability and porosity of 3 have been characterized by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), PXRD, and N2 sorption isotherm measurements. TGA of the as-synthesized sample showed gradual loss of 26.5 wt% below 220 1C which matches the expected value of 26.7 wt% for the removal of four DMF molecules per Cd2 formula unit. The PXRD pattern of the degassed sample is basically identical to that of the as-synthesized one, which is quite unusual because lowering temperature can induce a signiﬁcant framework distortion. The N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K (Fig. 3) is type I, with apparent Langmuir surface area of 590 m2 g1. In summary, the layer-by-layer self-assembly process of a new pillared-layer PCP has been demonstrated by capturing of two intermediates. In contrast with hydro(solvo)thermal syntheses, the mild conditions in conventional solution syntheses with lower temperature and concentration may substantially slow down the kinetics of assembly of PCPs and provide a possibility to seize the intermediates in the crystal growth course. Moreover, a unique temperature-induced, hysteretic framework dynamic behavior has been also observed. These ﬁndings should be instructive for understanding the self-assembly and properties of PCPs.

Elemental analyses were carried out on a Vario EL elemental analyzer. The fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum (4000-400 cm-1) was obtained from a KBr pellet using a Bruker Tensor 27 system. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were recorded collected on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation operated with a scan speed of 3º/min and a step size of 0.050º in 2θ. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed using a NETZSCH TG 209 F3 thermogravimetric analyzer in flowing N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min-1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a NETZSCH DSC-204 differential scanning calorimetry using a crystalline sample (10.120 mg) of 3 in flowing N2 with a cooling or heating rate of 20 °C min-1. Synthesis: Cd(NO3)2·6H2O (0.069 g, 0.2 mmol), H2nbdc (0.042 g, 0.2 mmol) and pyz (0.16 g, 0.2 mmol) were mixed in DMF (10 mL) with stirring for 30 min at air. After filtration, the filtrate was kept in 15 mL beaker sealed with parafilm at room temperature. A few block colorless crystals of [Cd2(nbdc)2(DMF)4]·2DMF (1) were isolated after a few days, and then [Cd2(nbdc)2(pyz)(DMF)2]·3DMF (2) were isolated at two weeks in the mother liquid. The block colorless crystals of [Cd2(nbdc)2(pyz)2]·4DMF (3) were obtained after six weeks in ~40% yield based on Cd. Alternative synthesis of 3: A solution of 0.5 M H2nbdc and pyz in DMF was layered on a 0.5 M solution of Cd(NO3)2·6H2O in DMF. After filtration, the filtrate was kept at room temperature.

Gas sorption: The crystalline samples of as-synthesized 3 were loaded in a large bulb sample cell after the high-boiling solvent guest molecules (DMF) were exchanged with low-boiling solvent (MeOH) for three days followed by degassing at room temperature under vacuum overnight (12 h). Gas adsorption isotherms were measured volumetrically was used for N2 (77 K) on a BELSORP-max adsorption apparatus (BEL inc, Japan). X-ray Crystallography: The single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements were made on an Oxford CrysAlis CCD area detector with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation with the ω scan mode. The structures were solved by direct methods and the subsequent difference Fourier synthesis using the SHELX-TL software suite (G. M. Sheldrick, University of Göttingen, Germany, 1997).
