Manuscript Structural diversity and modulation of metal–organic coordination frameworks with a ﬂexible V-shaped dicarboxyl building block† Xiu-Juan Jiang,ab Su-Zhen Zhang,b Jian-Hua Guo,b Xiu-Guang Wang,b Jin-Shan Li*a and Miao Du*ba Received 23rd October 2008, Accepted 10th December 2008 First published as an Advance Article on the web 29th January 2009 DOI: 10.1039/b818567k A family of new coordination polymers based on a V-shaped ﬂexible dicarboxyl building block 4,40-(hexaﬂuoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) and familiar metal ions (MnII, CoII, NiII, CuII, ZnII, and AgI) have been prepared and structurally characterized. Their thermal stability and solid state luminescent properties of the ZnII and AgI complexes have also been investigated. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals a signiﬁcant structural diversity of these coordination frameworks, such as the 1-D zigzag chain, 2-fold interpenetrating layer composed of 21 helical arrays, and 3-D open network with 42 helicity and pcu topology based on the rod-shaped secondary building units (SBUs). Additionally, hydrogen bonding interactions are found in these structures to further extend or stabilize the coordination motifs. A comprehensive analysis of the coordination systems based on this dicarboxyl tecton also demonstrates that it is an excellent candidate for the design and construction of multiform metal–organic frameworks (especially helical arrays), which can be dominated by metal ions and/or synthetic conditions. Introduction In the scopes of crystal engineering, the rational design and assembly of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have currently attracted considerable attention in view of their intriguing crys- talline architectures and potential applications.1–5 The main driven force in the construction of such network based solids is coordination strength, and weak cooperative interactions such as hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking also do play a signiﬁ- cant role in this course.6 As a result, the diversiform coordination frameworks are chieﬂy dominated by the judicious choice of organic building blocks and metal ions, because a subtle change of the ligands such as length, ﬂexibility, and symmetry as well as the metal ions with different coordination tendencies may dramati- cally inﬂuence the resultant structural motifs.7–9 Nowadays, a variety of metal–polycarboxyl frameworks have been deliber- ately prepared as a successful paradigm of this synthetic strategy, most of which however are based on the rigid tectons.10–13 Comparatively, the conformational freedom nature of the ﬂexible polycarboxyl modules may provide more possibility for the construction of unusual coordination frameworks.14 On the other hand, supramolecular architectures with helicity are highly fascinating.15,16 The chiral nature in helical arrays may also be associated with enantioselectivity, models of biological systems and optoelectronic materials. Therefore, the develop- ment of new systems possessing speciﬁc helicity has been an intensive research area at present.17 It has been testiﬁed that by the appropriate assembly of metal ions and organic ligands, multifarious discrete helicates and coordination polymers con- sisting of inﬁnite helices can be rationally achieved.15–19 In this context, the V-shaped ﬂexible dicarboxyl ligands such as 4,40-oxybis(benzoic acid), benzophenone-4,40-dicarboxylic acid, 4,40-dicarboxydiphenyl sulfone, and 4,40-(hexa- ﬂuoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) have been exploited to construct novel coordination polymers considering the following points.20,21 (a) The twisted conformation of these ligands provides the potential ability to shape helical assembly. (b) The different deprotonated degrees of the ligands under appropriate conditions will result in variable coordination and hydrogen-bonding modes in the products. (c) The considerably long molecular backbones of such building blocks may lead to the formation of microporous coordination frameworks with channels. As a continuation of our effort on crystal engineering of coordination polymers regulated by metal ions22 and reactive routes,23 we will present here a series of new network solids constructed from the familiar metal ions and 4,40-(hexaﬂuoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) (H2L) under different conditions, which display multifarious coordination arrays such as the 1-D zigzag chains (for MnII, CoII, NiII, and ZnII), a 2-fold interpenetrating layered network embodying 21 helical motifs (for CuII), and a 3-D rod-based pcu framework featuring 42 helicity (for AgI). The thermal stability of all crystalline materials and the solid state ﬂuorescent properties of the ZnII and AgI complexes have also been investigated. aState Key Laboratory of Elemento-Organic Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, P.

X-Ray crystallography Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for 1–6 were collected on a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer with Mo Ka radiation (l ¼ 0.71073 A˚ ) at room temperature. There was no evidence of crystal decay during data collection. In each case, a semi- empirical absorption correction was applied (SADABS) and the program SAINT was used for integration of the diffraction proﬁles.24 All structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS of the SHELXTL package and reﬁned with SHELXL.25 The ﬁnal reﬁnements were performed by full-matrix least-squares methods with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-H atoms on F2. Generally, C-bound H atoms were placed geometrically and reﬁned as riding, whereas O-bound H atoms of methanol, water, and carboxyl were ﬁrst located in difference Fourier maps and then reﬁned as riding. Isotropic displacement parameters of all H atoms were derived from the parent atoms. Further crystallographic details are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond parameters and hydrogen-bonding geometries are listed in Table S1 and Table S2, respectively.† Results and discussion Synthesis and characterization In this work, two synthetic pathways were applied to prepare these crystalline solids. Complexes 1–3 and 5 were obtained by direct assembly of the ligand with the corresponding metal chloride or nitrate in methanol/water under the ambient condition, in which the pH value of the reactive system was adjusted by NaOH to facilitate the complete deprotonation of the ligand. Whereas 4 and 6 were synthesized by hydrothermal reaction of the ligand with metal acetate. In each synthetic case, an approximate metal/ligand composition of 2/1 was used for the starting materials, neverthe- less, the resultant products were found to possess the equimolar composition. All these complexes are insoluble in common organic solvents and water due to their polymeric and neutral nature. The compositions of 1–6 were determined by IR, 856 | CrystEngComm, 2009, 11, 855–864 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009 Published on 29 January 2009.

The phase purities of the bulk samples were further identiﬁed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns, which display essen- tial similarity to those of the calculated ones (see Fig. S1†). For the IR spectra, the broad bands centered at ca. 3400 cm1 indicate the O–H stretching of water/methanol for 1–3 and 5, water for 4, and carboxyl for 6, respectively. Notably, in the IR spectra of complexes 1–5, the absence of characteristic absorption bands of carboxyl, which appears at 1715 cm1 for the free ligand, reveals its complete deprotonation. As a consequence, the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylate are found in the range of 1612–1618 and 1384–1419 cm1, respectively. For the IR spectrum of 6, the strong absorption peak at 1679 cm1 suggests the presence of carboxyl and its signiﬁcant shift in comparison with that of the free ligand should be ascribed to metal coordination. In addition, the peaks occurring at 1591 cm1 and 1396/1364 cm1 could be assigned to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylate and carboxyl/ carboxylate. The coexistence of both carboxyl and carboxylate groups in 6 can also be validated by the crystal structure. Structural analysis of 1–6 [M(L)(CH3OH)2(H2O)2]n (M ¼ MnII, CoII, and NiII for 1–3). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complexes 1–3 are isostructural (see Table 1) and therefore only the crystal structure of 1 is discussed in detail here. As shown in Fig. 1, there exist two similar but crystallographically independent MnII ions in the asymmetric unit of 1, which are located on the inversion centers. Each MnII ion is surrounded by three pairs of oxygen atoms coming from two L ligands, two water and two methanol molecules, taking a nearly ideal octahedral geometry (see Table S1 for detailed bond parameters†). As a result, the MnII centers are linked by the L ligands in bis-monodentate mode (as spacers, mode I in Scheme 1) to afford 1-D zigzag arrays along the [010] direction with the neighboring Mn1/Mn2 separation of 13.671(6) A˚ . Intrachain H-bonds of O6–H6A/O2 and O8– H8A/O4 (see Table S2 for details†) are observed between the terminal methanol ligands and uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms. In addition, interchain H-bonds of O5–H5A/O2 and O7–H7A/O4 (see Table S2 for details†) involving the water ligands and uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms interlink such 1-D arrays to afford a 2-D sheet (see Fig. 1b). The 2-D sheets are further extended via comparable O5–H5B/O4 and O7–H7B/O2 interactions (see Table S2†) to form a 3-D supramolecular network (see Fig. 1c). There exists no void space in the structures of 1–3. Recently, a metal–organic antiferromagnet [Mn(L)(py)- (H2O)0.5]n (py ¼ pyridine) has been hydrothermally synthesized from MnCl2 and H2L in the presence of pyridine,21f which displays a distinct 3-D network structure constructed from the intercon- nection of Mn–carboxylate chains. Their structural difference may originate from the dissimilar coordination environments of MnII. In [Mn(L)(py)(H2O)0.5]n, the octahedral sphere of MnII is provided by ﬁve oxygen donors from bridging carboxylate and water as well as one nitrogen atom of terminal pyridine, which affords the valid linkage for the resulting high-dimensional framework, whereas in 1, only two unidentate carboxylates are involved and the other four coordination sites are occupied by the solvent components, resulting in a simple 1-D array. [Cu(L)(H2O)]n (4). Complex 4 features a 2-D parallel inter- penetrating framework with alternate left- and right-handed 21 helical motifs. As shown in Fig. 2a, each penta-coordinated CuII center shows a nearly ideal square-pyramidal sphere (t z 0),26 which is completed by four oxygen atoms from different L ligands in the equatorial plane and one axial water solvent (see Table S1 for detailed bond geometries†). In this case, each carboxylate group adopts the syn–syn bridging mode (mode II in Scheme 1) and as a result, a pair of adjacent CuII centers are connected by four carboxylate moieties to constitute a familiar paddle-wheel pattern with the Cu/Cu distance of 2.603(1) A˚ .

View Article Online Such dimeric motifs could be considered as the secondary building units (SBUs), which are further extended by the ligand spacers to produce a 2-D (4,4) coordination layer along the bc plane (see Fig. 2b). The corrugated nature of this network results from the bent backbone of the V-shaped L connector, which leads to 2-fold parallel interpenetration of the adjacent layers (see Fig. 2c) that are also sustained by O5–H5A/O2 and O5–H5A/O3 interactions (see Table S2 for details†). Notably, 1-D tubular channels within the interpenetrated array are observed along [010] (Fig. S2a†), which are constructed from 21 double-stranded helical chains in alternate left- and right- handed fashion (see Fig. 2d). Each repeated helical unit includes two dimeric CuII nodes and two L ligands with a pitch of 13.9384(9) A˚ (double distance of the b axis), generated by the crystallographic 21 screw operation (see Fig. S2b†). Further- more, such interpenetrated 2-D arrays take a parallel and staggered arrangement to minimize the steric effect, which are linked via O5–H5B/F1 contacts (see Table S2 for details†) to afford a 3-D microporous supramolecular lattice (see Fig. S2c†). The 1-D channels resulting from the above-mentioned helical arrays have a volume of 262.9 A˚ 3 as evaluated by PLATON (14.3% of the unit cell volume).

View Article Online A closely related complex [Cu(L)(H2L)0.5]n has been obtained under a similar hydrothermal condition by using Cu(NO3)2 and excess H2L.21b,c,e In this case, similar 2-D interpenetrating arrays to those in 4 are also generated, which however are further extended by the H2L pillars to result in a 2-fold interpenetrating 3-D microporous coordination framework with interesting adsorption properties. Obviously, the different axial ligands around the dinuclear CuII SBUs (water for 4 and H2L for [Cu(L)(H2L)0.5]n) are responsible for their structural discrepancy. {[Zn(L)(H2O)]2(CH3OH)(H2O)3}n (5). Complex 5 crystallizes in acentric space group P21 with the Flack parameter of 0.013(9). The asymmetric unit consists of two similar but crystallograph- ically independent ZnII centers that adopt the distorted tetrahe- dral geometries (see Table S1† for details) provided by four oxygen donors from two water and two L ligands (see Fig. 3a). In addition, there exist weak interactions between ZnII and carboxylate with the Zn–O distances of 2.554(3) A˚ for Zn1/O1, 2.537(4) A˚ for Zn1/O4, 2.843(3) A˚ for Zn2/O6, and 2.973(4) A˚ for Zn2/O8. As a consequence, the ZnII ions are extended by the L spacers (mode I in Scheme 1) to form two individual zigzag chains along the [001] direction (see Fig. 3b) with the Zn/Zn separation of 13.263(2) A˚ . Notably, in each 1-D array of 5, the two L ligands around each ZnII take a syn-arrangement (c-axis translation), whereas in that of 1–3, the adjacent ligands around each metal center are centrosymmetric with an anti-disposition. This structural discrepancy results in different 1-D coordination patterns, in which the extent of one zigzag unit is 13.263(2) A˚ for 5 (c axis), and 27.34(1)–27.198(2) A˚ for 1–3 (b axis). Moreover, the adjacent 1-D arrays are connected via O12–H12A/O1 and O10–H10A/O6 hydrogen bonding between water and carbox- ylate (see Table S2 for details†) to generate a 2-D supramolecular layer along the ac plane (see Fig. 3c). Such layers are further extended along the [010] direction to afford a 3-D microporous supramolecular architecture (see Fig. 3d) via O9–H9B/O4 and O11–H11B/O8 interactions involving water and carboxylate (see Table S2 for details†). Evaluation of the host space by PLATON reveals a value of 284.7 A˚ 3 (13.6% of the unit cell volume), which is occupied by the lattice water and methanol solvents. In addition, this structure is further stabilized by multiple host/solvent and solvent/solvent hydrogen bonding interactions (see Table S2 for details†). Comparatively, a 3-D chiral microporous coordination framework [ZnL]n has been obtained by hydrothermal reaction of zinc(II) acetate and H2L,21d which represents the ﬁrst example for a ﬂuoro-lined nanotube architecture with a new uninodal 4-connected topology. In this structure, no solvent is involved in the crystalline lattice and as a result, the coordi- nation sphere of ZnII ion is completely provided by the bridging carboxylate groups to form a high-dimensional network. In addition, this material displays selective sorption and catalytic chiral recognition properties in connection with its structural features. [Ag2(H2L)(L)]n (6). Silver(I) ion is a favorable connecting node in the construction of multifarious coordination networks due to its coordination diversity, which usually adopts the linear, trigonal or T-shaped, and tetrahedral geometries.27,28 As far as 6, the asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically inde- pendent AgI centers, which are coordinated to ﬁve oxygen donors coming from three L ligands and two H2L molecules (see Fig. 4a). The t parameters of Ag1 and Ag2 are 0.41 and 0.04, respectively, revealing their different degrees of distortion from the ideal square-pyramidal sphere (see Table S1 for detailed bond geometries†).26 In addition, there exists weak Ag2/O3 interac- tion with the distance of 2.791(1) A˚ . Remarkably, two different types of ligands (H2L and deprotonated L) are found to coexist in this structure, which adopt dissimilar binding fashions (III and IV in Scheme 1). As a result, each AgI ion is linked to ﬁve ligands and each H2L or L ligand is connected to four or six AgI centers (see Fig. S3a†) to constitute an intricate 3-D coordination framework (see Fig. 4b), in which 1-D silver–carboxylate/ carboxyl polymeric chains are observed along [001] (see Fig. 4c). Notably, weak argentophilic interactions are found in this 1-D array with the Ag1/Ag2 and Ag2/Ag2 distances of 3.142(1) and 3.312(1) A˚ . Interestingly, this 3-D architecture contains two kinds of double-stranded helical arrays. In each case, a pair of 42 helical chains with the same right- or left-handed helicity are constituted by the AgI ions and H2L ligands, which are further integrated via the Ag–O coordination bonds to afford a double- stranded helix (see Fig. 4d). Along the crystallographic 42 axis, Scheme 1 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009 CrystEngComm, 2009, 11, 855–864 | 859 Published on 29 January 2009.

View Article Online each helical unit is composed of four binuclear AgI dimers and four ligands (see Fig. S3b†) with a pitch of 13.536(3) A˚ (double distance of the c axis). Thus, the helices in 6 exhibit both left- and right-handed fashions in a 1 : 1 ratio to result in a racemic 3-D network. Additionally, there exist O8–H8/O1 and O6–H6/O2 hydrogen bonds within the 3-D coordination architecture (see Table S2 for details†). Signiﬁcantly, clustering of the –CF3 ligand groups in the channels of this open framework occupies most of the potential void space and thus, only very small interspace (97.7 A˚ 3, 1.5% of the unit cell volume) is found. From the perspective of topology, this complicated 3-D network is composed by four types of nodes, that is to say, the 4- connected H2L, the 6-connected L as well as the topologically unequivalent 5-connected AgI centers, resulting in a 4-nodal (4,5,6)-connected framework (see Fig. S3c†) with the Schl€aﬂi symbol of (43.62.8)(44.64.82)(46.64)(47.64.84) as calculated by TOPOS.29 Of further importance, O’Keeffe and Yaghi et al.30 have developed the concept of rod SBUs, which is helpful for the design and synthesis of metal–organic frameworks. In the structure of 6, each silver–carboxylate/carboxyl rod-shaped SBU is linked to four neighboring such SBUs through the ligand backbones to result in a pcu type network. Viewpoint for structural design of related coordination systems The above structural analysis of complexes 1–6 reveals that the ﬂexible ligand H2L can act as a versatile building block by bridging the metal ions in diverse manners (see Scheme 1) to construct a variety of coordination frameworks from 1-D to 3-D. The structural diversity is closely related to the nature of metal ions with Fig. 2 (a) A portion view of 4 showing the coordination environment of CuII.

View Article Online different coordination tendencies, which is well known as a basic principle in the design and synthesis of such supramolecular systems. In this regard, it should be noted that although complexes 1–3 and 5 display 1-D zigzag patterns, the octahedral spheres for MnII, CoII, and NiII and tetrahedral geometry for ZnII lead to a subtle discrepancy of the 1-D chains and further 3-D lattice architectures. On the other hand, the resultant crystalline products may be remarkably inﬂuenced by the synthetic conditions. For instance, the 1-D complexes 1–3 and 5 were synthesized via direct assembly in solution under ambient temperature, whereas the hydrothermal pathway affords the2-Dand3-Dspecies4 and 6 with helicity. This result indicates that higher-dimensional materials may be preferably obtained by using a hydrothermal method. A more evident support for this opinion can be revealed by the ZnII complexes 5 and[ZnL]n as discussed above. From all known related paradigms presented in this and previous work,21 we can brieﬂy conclude that the crystalline products prepared at a higher temperature (hydrothermal condition) will normally exclude the solvent molecules thereof and thus facilitate the formation of higher-dimensional species, whereas in the case of ambient condi- tion, the solvents are always involved in metal coordination as terminal ligands, which certainly reduce the effective linage of the metal nodes to afford l-D motifs. Another signiﬁcant structural feature for the related coordina- tion systems is the helical assembly. From the synthetic viewpoint, we can discover that most of the hydrothermal products possess the essential helical character.21b,c,d,e,h,i As far as the structural aspect, it can be rationally deduced that the twisted conformation of the ﬂexible ligand will be responsible for the resultant helicity. In this ligand module, the two phenyl rings can rotate freely around the central sp3 carbon joint, with the dihedral angles between them in a wide range of 61.3–79.8 (see Table S3†). As a result, the ﬂexible backbone can be adjusted to meet the requirement of metal coor- dinationtoconstitutediverse structuralmotifs.Atthis stage, wecan presumedly state that the smaller dihedral angle is propitious to form helical coordination arrays (61.3–73.8).

View Article Online Thermal stability of 1–6 Complexes 1–6 are air stable and can retain the structural integrity for a considerable length of time at room temperature. Thus, their thermal stability was studied by TG-DTA technique (see Fig. S4 for the TG-DTA curves†), which is an important parameter for metal–organic framework materials. For 1, the ﬁrst weight loss of 3.45% (calculated: 3.30%) in the range of 73– 128 C in the TGA curve corresponds to the elimination of one water molecule (an endothermic peak at 80 C in DTA). Decomposition of the residual component occurs until 384 C with a sharp weight loss and ends at 518 C. Accordingly, an intensive exothermic peak is found at 455 C in the DTA curve. The TGA curve of 2 shows the ﬁrst weight loss of 9.36% (calculated: 9.10%) in the range of 103–141 C, indicating the expulsion of one methanol plus one water (an endothermic peak at 125 C in DTA). Then, the residual framework starts to decompose beyond 177 C with a series of consecutive weight loss (three exothermic peaks observed at 449, 471, and 487 C in DTA) and ends at 534 C. With regards to 3, the exclusion of one methanol and one water components is found in the temperature range of 93–162 C (experimental and calculated: 9.96 and 9.12%) with two endothermic peaks at 112 and 146 C in the DTA curve. Decomposition of the residuary coordination framework is observed until heating to 348 C and ends at 476 C (two exothermic peaks at 414 and 459 C in DTA). Complex 4 is thermally stable to 317 C, where a sharp weight loss occurs and ends at 443 C. Accordingly, an intensive exothermic peak is Fig. 4 (a) A portion view of 6 showing the coordination environments of AgI. (b) 3-D coordination framework of 6 viewed along the c axis.

As for 5, the weight loss of all lattice methanol and water molecules is found at 25–188 C (experimental and calculated: 8.56 and 8.05%) with two endo- thermic peaks at 62 and 128 C in DTA. With that, pyrolysis of the residual coordination framework occurs at 208 C and ends at 554 C (an exothermic peak at 442 C in DTA). Pyrolysis of the solvent-free complex 6 is observed until heating to 264 C, in which a sharp weight loss starts and ends at 498 C. Accordingly, an intense exothermic peak is found at 383 C in the DTA curve. Photoluminescence properties Solid-state ﬂuorescent spectra of the ZnII and AgI (d10 metal center) complexes 5 and 6, as well as the free ligand H2L were recorded at room temperature (see Fig. S5†). The free ligand exhibits an emission maximum at 538 nm upon excitation at 319 nm, which could be ascribed to the p / p* and/or p* / n transitions. For complexes 5 and 6, the maximum ﬂuorescent emission bands appear at 539 and 540 nm (lex ¼ 319 nm), respectively, which should be assigned to the ligand-centered transitions.31 Furthermore, considerable enhancement of the luminescent intensity for 5 may be attributed to the increased rigidity of the deprotonated ligand upon complexation that will reduces the nonradiative decay of the intraligand (p / p*) excited state.32 Conclusion and perspective This work presents the preparation, crystal structures, and properties of a series of new coordination polymers based on a ﬂexible and versatile dicarboxyl building block, which may show different binding modes with the metal ions to result in diverse structural motifs. The coordination networks of such crystalline products may be directed and regulated by the choice of metal ions and/or synthetic conditions. The results demon- strate that this ﬂexible tecton can be rationally used to construct novel metal–organic frameworks especially helical materials, which may bring new insights and important impetus to crystal engineering. Thus, we are currently developing further functional coordination solids based on this ligand by a systematic research.
