Introduction Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs),[1-4] as a rapidly growing class 15 of organic-inorganic hybrid porous materials, have achieved great interest in recent decades, because their intriguing varieties of architectures and many potential applications, including carbon dioxide capture,[5-7] gas storage, separation,[8-10] sensing,[11-13] optical devices,[14-17] catalysis[18-20] and drug delivery[21-23] etc. 20 The assembly of metal ions/clusters as nodes and organic bridging ligands as linkers by coordination can obtain architectures and functional materials. Many efforts have been focused on the design of new structures for chemists and materials scientists. In order to obtain aesthetic and useful 25 structures, the high symmetrical carboxylate ligands are most widely used in MOFs construction. For example, some 6- or 12- carboxyl dendritic ligands with C3 symmetry have been applied to build up more plentiful topologies and robust functionalities in MOFs.[24-32] Recently, Li et al. proposed a new strategy to use 30 low-symmetrical ligands to generate novel MOFs.[33] The resulting structures are different from those of the corresponding high symmetrical ligands. Evidently, it is quite interesting to explore and develop such ligands with lowered symmetry to construct a MOF. 35 In our previous work, a 6-node dendritic ligand 1,3,5-tris(3,5- di(4-carboxylphenyl-1-yl)phenyl-1-yl)benzene (H6TDCPB) with C2 & C3 symmetry has been utilized to assemble with Zn(II) ion to form a two-fold interpenetrated MOF JUC-100.[24] In this paper, we utilized a V-shaped aromatic ligand 1, 3-di(4- 40 carboxyphenyl)benzene (H2DCPB) with C2 symmetry, which just retains one branch of the H6TDCPB ligand. Especially, there are a large number of V-shaped linkers used in MOF syntheses, not only because it is suitable to construct porous frameworks, but also it may lead to diverse structures.[34-39] The assembly of 45 this ligand with Zn(II) ion forms a two-fold interpenetrated porous MOF with pcu topology (JUC-135). Notably, by fluorescence technique, JUC-135 can be used to detect nitroaromatic explosives. The Stern-Volmer constants, KSV, are 1.5 × 103 M-1 for 1,3-DNB, 3.3 × 103 M-1 for 2,4-DNT and 3.7 × 50 104 M-1 for TNP, respectively. Especially, JUC-135 is amongst the most efficient porous material-based sensors for TNP as the common chemical constituent of commercial explosives.[40-45] Furthermore, JUC-135 also can distinguish TNP (blue-shift) from NB, 1, 3-DNB and 2, 4-DNT (red-shift) through shift 55 direction of fluorescent spectra. Scheme 1 The V-shaped H2DCPB ligand. Experimental Section Materials and methods 60 All the chemical reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. H2DCPB was synthesized according to the literature procedure.[46] Powder X- ray-diffraction (PXRD) patterns were acquired on a Scintag X1 diffractometer with Cu-Kα (λ =1.5418 Å) at 50 kV, 200 mA with 65 a 2θ range of 4-40° at room temperature. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed with a Perkin-Elmer TGA thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in the range of 30-800 °C under air flow for all measurements. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were performed on a Perkin- 70 Elmer 240 analyzer.

Gas sorption-desorption measurements were acquired on Autosorb-iQ2-MP-AG. All fluorescence measurements were recorded on a Fluoromax-4 Spectrofluorometer at room temperature. 5 Synthesis of [(Zn4O)(DCPB)3]•11DMF•5H2O (JUC-135) A mixture of Zn(NO3)2•6H2O (10 mg, 0.034 mmol), H2DCPB (5 mg, 0.016 mmol), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 5 ml) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 0.5 ml) was sealed into a 20 ml capped vessel.

X-ray structure determination and structure refinement Crystallographic data collection for JUC-135 was collected on Bruker SMART APEX II CCD with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 298K. Corrections for incident and diffracted beam 20 absorption effects were applied to the date using the SADABS program.[47] The structures can be successfully obtained by a combination of the direct method and refined by the full matrix least-squares against F2 values using the SHELXTL program.[48] All non-hydrogen atoms were located successfully from Fourier 25 maps and refined by anisotropic thermal parameters. Because there are many disordered solvent molecules in JUC-135, their diffraction contribution was removed by using the PLATON/SQUEEZE.[49, 50] The guest molecules can be calculated from the TGA and elemental analyses (C, H and N). 30 Crystallographic data for the structure is listed in Table 1 and the selected bond lengths and bond angles are reported in Table S1.

The asymmetric unit contains one Zn1, one Zn2, one third Zn3, one third Zn4, two deprotonated DCPB2- ligand, one third µ4-O atom (O5), one third µ4-O atom (O10) and 40 one third guest H2O molecule (Fig. S1). Each Zn4(µ4-O) cluster is encapsulated by six carboxylate groups from six DCPB2- ligands to form a classic Zn4O(CO2)6 secondary building unit (SBU), which is famous in the structures of MOFs (Fig. 1a), like MOF-5, MOF-177 and UMCM-1.[51-53] Meanwhile, two adjacent 45 Zn4O(CO2)6 SBUs are connected by a ligand (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 1c, a cage is composed by eight Zn4O(CO2)6 SBUs and twelve DCPB2- ligands. Notably, JUC-135 has two sets of such parts, which further interlock together to form a 2-fold interpenetrating robust framework (Fig. 1d and 1e). From the 50 topologic point of view, the Zn4O(COO)6 SBUs and DCPB2- ligands can be regarded as 6-connected nodes and 2-connected nodes, respectively. The overall structure can be simplified as a (6, 6)-connected pcu topology (Fig. 1f). Therefore, the structure of JUC-135 could be regarded as one new member of the 55 IRMOF series. After elimination of guest molecules, the total accessible volume in JUC-135 is 67.9% using the PLATON/VOID routine.[50] Fig. 1 (a) Coordination environments of Zn4O(CO2)6 SUBs.

Property characterization 65 Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) of JUC-135 confirmed the phase purity of the bulk crystalline material. The thermogravimetric analyses of JUC-135 crystal (Fig. S2) showed a slow weight loss of 41.87% before 200 °C, which corresponds to the loss of guest molecules (calculated 42.06%) (Fig. S3). The 70 framework started to collapse and decompose with the increase of temperature. The residue was ZnO (experimental: 15.21%; Page 2 of 7 Journal of Materials Chemistry A Journal of Materials Chemistry A Accepted Manuscript Published on 13 July 2015.

The as-synthesized samples were soaked in CH2Cl2, and then evacuated to obtain the activated ones. As shown in Fig. S2, the PXRD pattern of the activated sample indicated that the original framework was still retained after activation. The characteristic peak of C=O of DMF molecules at 5 1662 cm-1 is disappeared in the activated sample from Fig. S4, implying that all DMF guest molecules are removed completely. It was also consistent with the result of TGA analysis of the activated sample (Fig. S2). Gas sorption properties 10 In order to verify the permanent porosities, gas sorption isotherms of activated JUC-135 were measured. The N2 adsorption isotherm of the activated sample at 77 K revealed a type-I microporous characteristic. The BET and Langmuir surface areas were calculated to be 503.7 m2 g-1 and 718.9 m2 g-1, respectively. 15 In addition, the pore width distributions are 1.6 nm and 2.2 nm by the DFT method. The N2 saturation uptake is significantly lower than the solvent accessible pore volume estimated from single crystal data and TGA, because the activated framework is partly collapsed, which is also consistent with the result of PXRD 20 analysis (Fig. S2). This phenomenon also appeared in previous work, such as IRMOF-3 and IRMOF-16.[54, 55] Fig. 2 N2 sorption isotherms of the activated sample at 77 K (solid symbols: adsorption and open symbols: desorption). Inset: pore size 25 distribution calculated by the DFT method. Fluorescent behavior and sensing properties The fluorescent properties of free H2DCPB ligand dissolved in DMF and JUC-135 dispersed in DMF were carried out at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 3a, the free H2DCPB ligand 30 exhibits emission at 352 nm upon excitation at 323 nm in DMF. In comparison, JUC-135 dispersed in DMF shows a similar emission at 354 nm (λex = 330 nm) (Fig. 3b), which indicates that the fluorescent property of JUC-135 is mostly attributed to the organic linker. 35 To investigate the fluorescent sensing ability of JUC-135, the emission spectra of JUC-135 ground crystal powder dispersing in DMF with different analytes of 200 ppm were measured under photoexcitation at 330 nm considering that it was insoluble and highly fluorescent intensity in DMF (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, the 40 fluorescent intensities of JUC-135 are largely dependent on the solvent molecules. Notably, it exhibits significant fluorescent quenching behaviour in nitrobenzene (NB). In order to further monitor the emissive response to NB, JUC-135 was titrated with NB of various concentrations in DMF at room temperature (Fig. 45 3d). As we expected, the fluorescent intensity rapidly decreased to 9.54% at 20 ppm and 53.13% at 120 ppm, respectively (Fig. S5a). The fluorescence quenching phenomenon should be mainly due to electron transfer from the framework to electron-deficient NB molecule.[56, 57] 50 Fig. 3 Excitation (dot lines) and emission (solid lines) spectra of free H2DCPB ligand dissolved in DMF (a) and JUC-135 dispersed in DMF (b). (c) Fluorescence intensity of JUC-135 crystal powder after immersed in DMF with different analytes of 200 ppm about 2 minutes at room 55 temperature upon excitation at 330 nm. (d) The emission spectra of JUC- 135 titrated with NB in DMF about 2 minutes. JUC-135 crystal powder of 3.0 mg was dispersed in DMF of 3.0 ml. As discussed above, the fluorescent quenching behaviour is mainly related to the electron-withdrawing -NO2 group. So we 60 further investigated the fluorescent property of JUC-135 to detect a series of nitroaromatic explosives, including 1, 3-DNB, 2, 4- DNT and TNP. The fluorescence quenching was monitored by luminescence spectroscopy (λex = 330 nm) when the analytes were added to DMF (Fig. 4a-4c). The maximum fluorescence 65 intensity of JUC-135 was reduced by 25.49%, 25.67%, 34.44%, 95.02% upon exposure to NB, 1, 3-DNB, 2, 4-DNT and TNP of 40 ppm, respectively (Fig. S6). The obtained data indicated that TNP is detected most effectively (Fig. 4d and Fig. S5b-5d), which is mainly attributed to the three nitro groups in TNP. With 70 increasing -NO2 groups, electron transfer becomes easier, which leads to more efficient fluorescence quenching.[56, 57] Page 3 of 7 Journal of Materials Chemistry A Journal of Materials Chemistry A Accepted Manuscript Published on 13 July 2015.

(d) The relationships between emission intensities and concentrations for NB (green), 1,3-DNB (blue), 2,4-DNT (violet) and TNP (red), respectively. 5 Upon closer examination of the fluorescent spectra, it is found that upon exposure to NB, 1,3-DNB and 2,4-DNT, the emission spectra of JUC-135 have red-shifts of 18, 20 and 24 nm as compared with that of pure DMF, respectively (Fig. 5a), whereas a blue-shift of 14 nm exposure to TNP. In addition, the similar 10 phenomenon also appeared when performing the same experiment with only H2DCPB ligand (Fig. 5b). This indicated that the discrimination of JUC-135 was mainly attributed to the ligand. The distinction of shift direction of fluorescent spectra between TNP and other nitro-containing compounds was rarely 15 reported in MOFs. JUC-135 can be used as one case of the few known MOFs to distinguish between TNP with the other explosives by spectral shift, which may be due to the formation of exciplexes (which stabilizes the excited state) between analytes and ligands/MOFs.[58, 59] The absorption band of TNP has a 20 considerable degree of overlap with the emission spectrum of JUC-135 in DMF (Fig. S7). However, the further study is needed because the accurate generating process is still undefined. The framework was still well retained after used for many times, which can be confirmed by PXRD in Fig. S8. 25 Fig. 5 The normalized fluorescence spetra of JUC-135 (a) and H2DCPB (b) in 600 ppm of NB (green), 1,3-DNB (blue), 2,4-DNT (voilet) and 20 ppm of TNP (red) in DMF about 2 minutes, respectively. (black: JUC- 135 and H2DCPB in DMF). 30 The quenching efficiency can be quantitatively explained by the Stern-Volmer equation: I0/I = 1 + KSV[Q], where I0 is the initial fluorescent intensity before addition of the analyte, I is the fluorescent intensity after addition of the analyte as quencher, [Q] is the molar concentration of the quenching constant (M-1), and 35 KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant. If the I0/I vs. [Q] plot is linear, KSV can be estimated accurately. The Sterm-Volmer plots for all analytes are nearly linear at low concentrations (Fig. 6), whereas the plots subsequently deviate from linearity at higher concentrations (Fig. S9). This may be ascribed to self- 40 absorption.[60-62] The Stern-Volmer constants, KSV, are 9.5 × 102 M-1 for NB, 1.5 × 103 M-1 for 1,3-DNB, 3.3 × 103 M-1 for 2,4- DNT and 3.7 × 104 M-1 for TNP, respectively. Notably, JUC-135 is amongst the most efficient porous material-based sensors for TNP, which is the common chemical constituent of commercial 45 explosives.[40-45] Fig. 6 The Stern-Volmer plots for JUC-135 with NB (a), 1,3-DNB (b), 2,4-DNT (c) and TNP (d) in low concentration region, respectively. The solid lines represent fits to the concentration-resolved data using Stern- 50 Volmer equation. We also monitored the sensitivity of H2DCPB towards TNP in DMF (Fig. S10a, b). The KSV value of H2DCPB ligand is 2.5 × 104 M-1 for TNP, which is smaller than that of JUC-135 (Fig. S10c). As shown in Fig. S10d, JUC-135 can more effectively 55 detect TNP. The fluorescent quenching efficiencies of JUC-135 are 5.7%, 23.4% and 79.3% in the presence of TNP of 0.4, 2 and 20 ppm, respectively, whereas for H2DCPB with the same concentration only 3.0%, 15.4% and 73.2%, respectively (Fig. S11). This exhibited that the framework of JUC-135 is more 60 efficient than H2DCPB ligand for TNP, which may be attributed to the pores in the framework to facilitate possible host-guest interactions. Furthermore, the stability of JUC-135 is propitious to separate and recycle. In fact, JUC-135 can be recycled by centrifuging the dispersed solution after use and washing several 65 times with DMF. As shown in Fig. 7, the fluorescence intensity and quenching ability of JUC-135 exhibited very little changes after used for five cycles. The high stability of the recovered sample can be demonstrated by PXRD patterns (Fig. S8).

Conclusion In summary, we utilized a porous MOF (JUC-135) based on a V- 5 shaped ligand, which displays an interesting and important ability to detect nitroaromatic explosives. Especially, it is amongst the most efficient porous material-based sensors for TNP. Furthermore, JUC-135 also can distinguish between TNP with the other explosives by spectral shift. We anticipate that it can 10 offer a new avenue to obtain new structures by using such V- shaped ligands and open a promising approach to design MOF- based sensors for explosives.
