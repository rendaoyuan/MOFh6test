Manuscript Position of substituent dependent dimensionality in Ln–Cu heterometallic coordination polymers† Gui-lin Zhuang,*a Wen-xian Chen,a Gan-ning Zeng,ab Jian-guo Wanga and Wu-lin Chena Received 10th July 2011, Accepted 7th October 2011 DOI: 10.1039/c1ce05864a The reaction of two derivatives of iminodiacetic acid, including H2ANMA (H2ANMA ¼ L-alanine- N-monoacetic acid) and H2MIDA (H2MIDA ¼ N-methyl-iminodiacetic acid), with Ln(NO3)3 (Ln ¼ La, Pr, Nd) and Cu(NO3)2 generates two types of Ln–Cu coordination polymers of different dimensionality, {[Ln2Cu3(ANMA)6](H2O)3} and {[Ln2Cu(MIDA)4(H2O)6](H2O)4} (Ln ¼ La, Pr, Nd). Crystal structure analysis reveals that the position of the methyl group in the two ligands plays an important role, which can be described as follows: (1) adjusting the coordination direction of ligand via the steric hindrance; (2) serving as an electron donating group to enhance the coordination ability of the amino group, where the H2MIDA ligand displays a new coordination mode. It is found that the position of the methyl groups in the two ligands plays a critical role in their structural differences. Introduction Over the last two decades, a surge of research activity in the exploratory studies of coordination polymers (CPs) has been emerging, largely stimulated by their fascinating structures1 and outstanding properties, such as molecular adsorption2 and separation processes,3 ion exchange,4 catalysis,5 sensor tech- nology6 and magnetism.7 Within these contexts, lanthanide– transition metal (3d–4f) heterometallic CPs, featuring the char- acteristics of both d- and f-block elements, are particularly notable because they not only inherit the intrinsic properties of d- and f-block CPs but also extract some unique cooperative properties. Currently, such compounds have attracted enormous interest in material science as well as in physics and theoretical chemistry, providing interesting cases of investigation. Since Gatteschi et al. reported the ﬁrst 3d–4f heterometallic complex,8 a greater effort has been made to explore the synthesis of 3d–4f heterometallic complexes, including those with various dimen- sionalities and peculiar topologies.9–12 However, owing to the variable and versatile coordination behavior of 4f metals, as well as the competitive reactions between 3d and 4f metals chelating to the same ligand, the synthesis of 3d–4f heterometallic CPs is still a challenge. Addi- tionally, coordination reactions are markedly sensitive to several factors, including the metal ion,13 ligand,14 temperature,15 pH value,16 reaction solvent17 and so on. Among those factors, the ligand serving as a basic unit plays an important role during the process of the reaction. Therefore, investigation of the effects of ligands (especially substituents of ligand) on the structure is very important in the search for effective synthetic strategies for 3d–4f heterometallic CPs. However, compared with systematic inves- tigation of transition metal-based CPs,18 corresponding studies with respect to the effect of the substituent of the ligand on the structure of 3d–4f heterometallic CPs are still absent. Utilizing derivatives of iminodiacetic acid (H2IDA), we have reported the synthesis and characterization of two high-dimen- sional CPs based on the nodes of 3d–4f heterometallic clusters.19 As a expansion of our studies, we deliberately selected two different derivatives of iminodiacetic acid (N-methyl-iminodi- acetic acid and L-alanine-N-monoacetic acid) and obtained two different dimensional Ln–Cu heterometallic CPs, {[Ln2Cu3(ANMA)6](H2O)3} (Ln ¼ La (1), Pr (2), Nd (3)) and {[Ln2Cu(MIDA)4(H2O)6](H2O)4} (Ln ¼ La (4), Pr (5), Nd (6)), focusing on the effect of the substituent of the ligand on the structure of Ln–Cu CPs. The obtained results reveal that the position of methyl groups in the two ligands plays a critical role in their structural differences. Results and discussion Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in the P3 space group (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one ANMA2 ligand, one third La3+ and one half Cu2+ ion. It is found that the Cu2+ ion occupies a site with 3 symmetry, while the La3+ ion lies on a threefold axis. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the Cu2+ ion displays a hexacoordinated conﬁguration with a distorted octahedral geometry, featuring the contribution aCollege of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, 310032, China.

The corresponding bond lengths of Cu–O and Cu–N are 1.9661(16)–2.3696(16) and 2.007(2) A, respectively, comparable to those in previously reported compounds.20 The coordination environment of the La3+ ion is best described as a monocapped square antiprism, featuring the contribution of three chelating/bridging (m2:h2:h1) carboxylates of three ANMA2 ligands and three carboxylate oxygen atoms of three ANMA2 ligands. The resulting Ln–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.4271(18)–2.7647(19) A, consistent with those of available systems.9a In compound 1, the ANMA2 ligand displays only one coordination mode, as depicted in Fig. 1(b), which is the same as that of H2IDA. Moreover, the methyl of the ANMA2 ligand is disordered and thereby regarded as occu- pying two equal half-occupancy sites: –C(5)H3 and –C(6)H3. Each of the two ANMA2 ligands respectively coordinate to one Cu2+ ion, resulting in one [Cu(ANMA)2]2 unit. Connection of adjacent units through La3+ ions generates a three-dimensional 63- network structure (Fig. 2), where each La3+ ion and [Cu (ANMA)2]2 unit can be viewed as a node and linker, respectively. Additionally, the pore volume of the framework 1 calculated through the PLATON program is approximately 117.5 A3 per unit cell volume (9.8%).21 Here, it is mentioned that the structure of 1 features the same topology as those compounds based on the H2IDA ligand.22 Moreover, compounds 2–3 exhibit a three-dimensional framework isomorphic with 1. The corresponding bond lengths of Ln–O, Cu–O and Cu–N1 are respectively 2.3941(16)–2.756(2), 1.9665(16)–2.3946(14) and 2.0059(18) A for 2, and 2.376(2)– 2.738 (3), 1.965(2)–2.3986(18) and 2.001(2) A for 3, which are slightly larger than those of 1. Moreover, the Ln/Cu distances are 4.680(2) A for 2 and 4.667(1) A for 3, respectively, which are slightly smaller than that of 1 (4.690(4) A). Compound 4 was crystallized in the P1 space group. The asymmetric unit of 4 consists of two MIDA2 ligands, one La3+ ion, one half Cu2+ ion, three aqua ligands and two guest water molecules. As shown in Fig. 3(a), each Cu2+ ion occupying an inversion centre features similar coordination geometry to that in 1, where the six coordinated atoms are from two MIDA2 ligands.

Moreover, the coordination geometry of La3+ is well regarded as a monocapped square antiprism, featuring coordination by ﬁve carboxylate oxygens from four MIDA2 ligands, one amino group from one MIDA2 ligand and three aqua ligands. The obtained Ln–O and Ln–N bond lengths are 2.477(2)–2.660(2) A and 2.876(3) A, respectively, which are in good agreement with those of reported systems.23 Moreover, the La3+/Cu2+ and La3+ /La3+ distances are 6.306 (4) and 4.533(3) A. Compared with that of 1–3, the MIDA2 ligand in 4 displays two different coordination modes, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). One is same as that of H2IDA and H2ANMA ligands,13b,22 while the other is a new coordination mode, which has never been found in the systems of H2IDA and its derivatives. Inspection of the structure of 4 reveals that: (1) each La3+ and Cu2+ ion respectively bonds with one MIDA2 ligand and thereby gener- ates [La(MIDA)]+ and [Cu(MIDA)2]2 units; (2) each [La (MIDA)]+ unit connects with neighboring ones by the carbox- ylate oxygen so as to form a one dimensional {La}n chain, and further connects with adjacent ones by the bridge of [Cu (MIDA)2]2, resulting in a two-dimensional plane structure, as shown in Fig. 4; (3) a three-dimensional supramolecular struc- ture is viewed to be constructed by the two-dimensional frame- work via weak interactions, as depicted in Fig. S1, ESI.† Similarly, compounds 5–6 are isomorphic with 4. The corre- sponding bond lengths of Ln–O, Ln–N, Cu–O and Cu–N are respectively 2.446(3)–2.646(3), 2.837(4), 1.943(4) and 2.040(4) A for 5, 2.433(2)–2.611(2), 2.796(3), 1.944(2) and 2.027(3) A for 6, which are slightly smaller than those of 4. Moreover, the Ln3+/Cu2+ and Ln3+/Ln3+ distances are 6.306(2) and 4.493(2) A for 5, and 6.270(1) and 4.445(3) A for 6, respectively, which is slightly larger than those of 4. Noticeably, the trend is contrary to that of compounds 1–3. It is interesting to observe that, in spite of the same synthetic conditions, compounds 1–6 exhibit two different types of struc- tures, due to the diversity in the position of the methyl group in the ligand. This suggests that the position of the methyl group plays an important role in the structures of 1–6. Based on structure analysis, we found that the methyl position has following inﬂuence on those structures. Firstly, the methyl acts as an electron donating group, effectively enhancing the Lewis basicity of the amino group so as to improve coordination ability, with the result that the amino group in H2MIDA can not only coordinate to Cu2+ but also bond with the Ln3+ ion, and in the compounds 4–6 generate two types of coordination modes, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). It is noteworthy that both compounds 1–3 and those reported compounds based on H2IDA display only one coordination mode, as shown in Fig. 1(b), while compounds 4–6 based on H2MIDA display two coordination modes, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). Secondly, the methyl group, imparting steric hindrance, may restrict the direction of the coordination bond of the H2MIDA ligand, but not affect the coordination geometry of the H2ANMA ligand. Therefore, compounds 1–3 exhibit a similar 63 network structure as those based on H2IDA, while compounds 4–6 display a new two- dimensional plane structure. Generally, it is found that the position of the methyl group in the two derivatives of H2IDA is responsible for the structural diversity of compounds 1–6. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of compounds 2–3 and 5–6 was measured from 1.8 to 300 K with an applied magnetic ﬁeld of 1000 Oe. As shown in Fig. 5, the cMT values of compounds 2–3 and 5–6 at room temperature are 5.12, 4.96, 3.60 and 3.88 cm3 mol1 K (300 K), which are approximately the expected values obtained by the Curie law (4.32 for 2, 4.43 for 3, 3.58 for 5 and 3.66 cm3 mol1 K for 6).24 Upon lowering the temperature, the cMT values grad- ually decrease and reach a minimum (1.29 for 2, 0.96 for 3, 0.60 for 5 and 1.82 cm3 mol1 K for 6). This suggests that compounds 2–3 and 5–6 exhibit antiferromagnetic properties overall. Furthermore, the data over the temperature range of 100–300 K for compounds 2–3 and 5–6 ﬁt well to the Curie–Weiss law with Weiss constants C ¼ 1.93 for 2, 2.28 for 3, 6.25 for 5 and 8.33 cm3 Fig. 3 (a) Coordination geometry of La3+ and Cu2+ ion in 4 with H atom removed for clarity; (b) and (c).two coordination modes of MIDA2 ligand.

Generally, it is found that compounds 2–3 and 5–6 exhibit antiferromagnetic properties. Moreover, magnetiza- tion measurements at 2 K were conducted, and the obtained M vs. H plots are shown in Fig. S2(b)–S5(b), ESI.† Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies were also per- formed in a N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 C min1 for compounds 1–6, as shown in Fig. 6. In the case of 1–3, TGA diagrams reveal that the initial weight loss between room temperature and 100 C are respectively 2.5% for 1, 2.9% for 2 and 2.8% for 3, corresponding to the removal of guest water molecules (theoretically calcd 3.87% for 1, 3.86% for 2 and 3.84% for 3), and the frameworks are stable until 300 C for 1, 273 C for 2 and 256 C for 3, respectively. This implies that, after losing guest water molecules, compounds 1–3 can retain their whole framework for a long time. Similarly, TGA diagrams of compounds 4–6 display the ﬁrst weight loss (14.2% for 4, 12.6% for 5 and 13.6% for 6) at 184 C, 156 C and 152 C respectively, which is attributed to the removal of three aqua ligands and two guest water molecules (calcd 6.5% for 4, 6.5% for 5 and 6.4% for 6). With further increase in temperature, the frameworks grad- ually decomposed. It was observed that, upon losing aqua ligands, compounds 4–6 become more unstable due to incom- plete coordination geometry of Ln3+ ions. Generally, compounds 1–3 display stronger thermal stability than compounds 4–6. Conclusions In summary, we have reported two different types of Ln–Cu (Ln ¼ La, Pr and Nd) coordination polymers based on two deriva- tives of H2IDA, featuring C-methyl (H2ANMA) and N-methyl (H2MIDA) groups. Crystal structure analysis reveals that the three compounds based on H2ANMA exhibit three-dimensional 63 network framework, while the other three compounds based on H2MIDA display a two-dimensional plane structure. It is noteworthy that the two ligands in the compounds 1–6 have different coordination modes, where H2MIDA exhibits a new coordination mode. Therefore, it is found that the position of the methyl ligands plays an important role, which can be ascribed to their action as an electron donating group and steric hindrance. Moreover, studies of their magnetic properties reveal that compounds 2–3 and 5–6 possess antiferromagnetic properties.

All reagents except L-alanine-N-monoacetic acid were of commercial origin and were used as received. The C, H, and N microanalyses were carried out with a CE instruments EA 1110 elemental analyzer. The infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet AVATAR FT-IR360 Spectrophotometer with pressed KBr pellets. TGA curves were prepared on a SDT Q600 Thermal Analyzer. Magnetic measurements were performed by a Quantum Design MPMS superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Single crystals having suitable dimensions for compounds 1-2, 4 and 6 were used for data collection using a CrysAlis CCD diffractometer at 173 K equipped with Enhance (Mo) X-ray Source (λ = 0.71073 Å). Integration and cell refinement were carried out using CrysAlis RED. The absorption corrections were performed by multiscan method using SCALE3 ABSPACK scaling algorithm. Compound 3 and 5 were used for data collection using a Rigaku RAXIS-CS Imaging Plate at 298 K equipped with Mo X-ray Source (λ = 0.71073 Å). Integration and cell refinement were carried out using R-AXIS-SPIDER. The absorption corrections were performed by multiscan method using Tompa analytical method. Corrections were made for Lorentz and polarization effects. The molecular structures were solved by direct methods (SHELXL-86/SHELXL-97) and refinement by full-matrix least-squares on F2 (SHELXS-97). Due to the disorder methyl of ANMA2- ligand in compounds 1-3, both –C(5)H3 and –C(6)H3 methyl are assigned half-occupancy, which results in error count of H atoms for ANMA2- ligand.” Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for CrystEngComm This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Synthesis Methods Synthesis of H2ANMA: L-alanine-N-monoacetic acid hydrochloride (H2ANMA.HCl.0.25H2O, Mw=188) was prepared based on Okamoto’s method 1.
