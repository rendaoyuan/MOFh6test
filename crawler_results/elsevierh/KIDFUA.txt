Tel./fax: +86 22 23766556 Graphical abstract Four 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (atz)-based magnetic complexes, two 4-connected CdSO4-type frameworks, a discrete trinuclear entity, and a layered motif, were obtained, exhibiting weak antiferromagnetic interactions transmitted by μ-syn, anti-COO− and/or μ-N2,N4-atz mediators in the nearest neighbours of the local bi- and trinuclear magnetic subunits. Four 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (atz)-based magnetic complexes, {[Mn2(atz)2(nip)2]·2H2O} n (1), {[Mn2(atz)2(Hbtc)2]·2H2O} n (2), [Mn3(atz)2(H2O)12(btc)2] (3), and {[Mn2(atz)(H2O)4(btec)]·2H2O} n (4), (nip2− =5-nitroisophathalate, btc3− =1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate, and btec4− =1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate), have been respectively prepared by increasing the numbers of the carboxylate group appended on the phenyl backbone, which were structurally and magnetically characterized by single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, FT-IR spectra, thermogravimetric and magnetic measurements. Structural determinations reveal that complexes 1 and 2 with different polycarboxylate coligands are isostructural, exhibiting 4-connected CdSO4-type frameworks with dimeric MnII 2 subunit extended by ditopic μ-N1,N4-atz and carboxylate-containing connectors. In contrast, complex 3 that assembled from the same components as 2 is a discrete trinuclear entity aggregated by two μ-N2,N4-atz ligands. Complex 4 has a layered motif with bent MnII-btec4− ribbons interconnected by μ-N2,N4-atz ligands. Weak antiferromagnetic interactions with comparable coupling constants transmitted by μ-syn, anti-COO− and/or μ-N2,N4-atz mediators were respectively observed in the nearest neighbours of the local bi- and trinuclear magnetic subunits of 1–4. Keywords 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole Polycarboxylate coligand Crystal structure Magnetism 1 Introduction Magnetic materials assembled from differently paramagnetic transition metal ions and mixed short mediators have always becoming intense interest due to their intriguing structure diversities [1], complicated magneto-structural correlations [2], and attracting applications in high-density information storage and quantum computation [3]. In this regard, a subtle combination of five-member aza-heterocyclic triazole and non-linear carboxylate bridges has becoming one of promising candidates due to their cooperative magnetic transfer [4–9] and diverse framework connectivity [10–21]. Previous investigations on the ternary CuII–triazolate–polycarboxylate self-assembly system [6] have shown that monocyclic triazolate and deprotonated carboxylate group can easily generate triangular CuII 3 and/or butterfly-shaped CuII 4 clusters with strong antiferromagnetic couplings, which could be periodically extended into high-dimensional robust frameworks by aromatic polycarboxylate coligands. The number and position isomerization of the three-atom carboxylate group towards phenyl backbone significantly determine the inter-cluster connectivity and metamagnetic behavior. In addition, the stepwise deprotonation of the poly-carboxylic acid coligand can also be observed in the resulting complexes [22], in which the deprotonated carboxylate group can selectively manipulate the overall dimensionality of the frameworks by coordinating to the different metal ions. More interestingly, the packing polymorphism of a two-dimensional copper(I) 3-amino-1,2,4-triazolate coordination polymer can also be found due to the different packing fashions of the curved layers, which provides a new mode of supramolecular isomerism in coordination polymers [23]. By contrast, for the ternary CoII–triazolate–polycarboxylate system, diverse three-dimensional (3D) frameworks containing infinitely distorted triangular magnetic lattices can be preferably generated by tridentate Y-type μ 3-triazolate ligand binding to an anisotropic CoII ion [24]. More importantly, the spin competition originating from the infinite triangular magnetic lattice, the magnetic nature of the anisotropic CoII ion with strong spin–orbit coupling, and the suitable inter-layer distance by phenyl-based polycarboxylate can be cooperatively dominated the complicated and interesting magnetic behavior of the targeted complexes. Apparently, it can be concluded that the coordination preference and the magnetic nature of both the paramagnetic spin carriers and mixed magnetic mediators can be significantly direct the solid crystal structures and the related magnetic behavior of the targeted complexes. As our continuing investigations along this line [6,25,26], herein, asymmetric 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (atz) and phenyl-derived coligands bearing two up to four carboxylate groups, such as 5-nitroisophathalic acid (H2nip), 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3btc), and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid (H4btec), were selected as mixed mediators to react with the paramagnetic MnII ion. Obviously, our special purpose is to explore the number and position effects of the carboxylate group on the structure, dimensionality and magnetism of the ternary MnII-triazole-polycarboxylate system. As a result, four atz-based magnetic samples, two isostructural 4-connected CdSO4-type frameworks for 1 and 2, one discrete trinuclear entity for 3 and one layered structure for 4, were obtained under conventional evaporation method at room temperature. Structural analysis reveals that the number and the binding mode of the carboxylate group appended on the phenyl skeleton can essentially direct the structure and dimensionality of the resulting complexes. Magnetically, weak antiferromagnetic interactions with comparable coupling constants were mediated in the local bi- and trinuclear magnetic subunits of 1–4. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Instrumentation All chemicals were commercially purchased (atz, H2nip, H3btc, and H4btec were from Acros and other analytical-grade reagents were from Tianjin chemical reagent factory) and used as received without further purification. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were carried out with a CE-440 (Leeman-Labs) analyzer. Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra (KBr pellet) were taken on an Avatar-370 (Nicolet) spectrometer in the range 4000–400cm−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were performed on a Shimadzu simultaneous DTG-60A compositional analysis instrument from room temperature to 800°C in N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5°Cmin−1. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were obtained from a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer at 40kV and 40mA for Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5406Å), with a scan speed of 0.1s/step and a step size of 0.01° in 2θ. The simulated PXRD pattern was calculated using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data and processed by the free Mercury v1.4 program provided by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center. Magnetic susceptibilities were acquired on a Quantum Design squid MPMS-XL-7 magnetometer with polycrystalline samples, in which the phase purity of the samples was determined by PXRD experiments. The magnetic susceptibility was corrected for the contribution of the gel capsule and for the core diamagnetism (using Pascal’s constants). 2.2 Synthesis of {[Mn2(atz)2(nip)2]·2H2O} n (1) To a methanol solution (4.0mL) containing atz (0.2mmol, 16.8mg) and H2nip (0.1mmol, 21.0mg) was slowly added an aqueous solution (6.0mL) of Mn(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.2mmol, 72.2mg) with constant stirring.

FT-IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3566 (w), 3547 (w), 3416 (br), 3116 (w), 1636 (s), 1617 (s), 1559 (s), 1541 (m), 1420 (s), 1369 (s), 1280 (m), 819 (m), 754 (w), 668 (w), 616 (w), 527 (w). 2.6 X-ray crystallographic study Structural measurements of 1–4 were performed on a computer controlled Bruker APEX-II QUAZAR diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation with a radiation wavelength of 0.71073Å by using φ–ω scan technique. There was no evidence of crystal decay during the data collection. The program saint [27] was used for integration of the diffraction profiles. Semi-empirical multi-scan absorption corrections were applied using sadabs program. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined with the full-matrix least-squares technique using the shelxs-97 and shelxl-97 programs [28]. Anisotropic thermal parameters were assigned to all non-H atoms. The organic H atoms were generated geometrically. The H atoms attached to water molecule were located from difference maps and refined with isotropic temperature factors. The oxygen atoms of lattice water molecules in 4 (O7 and O8) are positionally disordered with the equal site occupancy. The atz ligand in 4 is varied between two centrosymmetric sites with the equal site occupancy. The crystallographic data for the four complexes were listed in Table 1 , and the selected bond lengths and angles were shown in Tables 2–4 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and IR spectra Complexes 1–4 with different numbers of carboxylate group appended on the phenyl backbone were successfully prepared by conventional evaporation method at room temperature. Notably, the pH value of the medium was not specially controlled, so the deprotonation process of the carboxylate-containing coligand occurred spontaneously. Complexes 2 and 3 with the same components but different structures were constructed from different inorganic MnII salts, suggesting the important role of inorganic anions on the overall products. In the IR spectra, weak bands located at 3447±1cm−1 for 1 and 2, 3415cm−1 for 3, as well as 3566 and 3547cm−1 for 4 should be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of N–H, suggesting the presence of exocyclic amino group of atz ligand. A broad absorption at 3357cm−1 for 1, 3336cm−1 for 2, 3364cm−1 for 3, as well as 3416cm−1 for 4 were corresponding to the O–H stretching vibrations of the water molecule. The weak band for aromatic C–H vibrations was located at ca. 3100cm−1 in 1–4. In contrast to the absence of a strong vibration at ca. 1700cm−1 in 1, 3, and 4, the presence of a characteristic band at 1704cm−1 in 2 suggested the partial deprotonation of the auxiliary H3btc ligand. Additionally, the asymmetric (ν as) and symmetric (ν s) vibrations of carboxylate group were observed at 1645±2, 1614±1, and 1446+11, 1405+30cm−1 for 1 and 2, 1615, 1557, and 1359cm−1 for 3, as well as 1617, 1559 and 1420, 1369cm−1 for 4. The different separations suggest the coexistence of the monodentate and chelating bidentate binding modes of the carboxylate group. The characterized multiple adsorptions at ca. 1540, 1276 and 668cm−1 confirmed the existence of the triazole group for 1–4 [29]. Thus, the IR results were in an agreement with the single-crystal X-ray structural analyses. 3.2 Crystal structure of {[Mn2(atz)2(nip)2]·2H2O} n (1) and {[Mn2(atz)2(Hbtc)2]·2H2O} n (2) Complexes 1 and 2 with different carboxylate-containing coligands (fully deprotonated nip2− for 1 and doubly deprotonated Hbtc2− for 2) are isomorphic, exhibiting 4-connected CdSO4-type frameworks with dimeric MnII 2 subunits extended by mixed atz and carboxylate-containing ligands. Due to the isostructural motif, the crystal structure of 1 was presented herein, and only mention the pertinent points for 2 where appropriate. The asymmetry unit contains one unique MnII atom, one neutral atz molecule, one lattice water molecule, and one doubly deprotonated nip2−/Hbtc2− anion for 1/2. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the sole MnII ion in 1 is hexa-coordinated by four equatorial carboxylate O donors from three separate nip2− coligands and two axial triazolyl N atoms from two separate atz molecules, adopting distorted octahedral coordination geometry. For 2, the four equatorial carboxylate O donors belong to three Hbtc2− ligands (Fig. S1). The Mn–O and Mn–N separations are between 2.114(2) and 2.308(2)Å (Table 2), which are comparable with those MnII-based complexes with mixed carboxylate and triazolyl/tetrazolyl ligands [12,25,30,31]. As shown in Fig. 1b, a pair of μ-syn, anti-COO− groups from two symmetry-related nip2− (for 1) or Hbtc2− (for 2) ligands bridge two separate MnII ions into a dimeric {Mn2(COO)2} subunit with the intermetallic distances are 4.0655(8)Å for 1 and 3.9700(3)Å for 2. Each binuclear subunit can be further expanded by the phenyl backbone of nip2− connector, leading to a MnII-nip2− broad ribbon running along two orthogonal directions (Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c). These broad ribbons are interconnected together by neutral μ-N1,N4-atz molecules to generate a robust framework of 1 (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1). The intermetallic distances spanned by nip2−/Hbtc2− and μ-N1,N4-atz mediators are 7.6201(14)/7.6730(5) and 6.4944(13)/6.5673(6)Å for 1/2, which are almost beyond the magnetically interacting range. Thus, the dimeric {Mn2(COO)2} subunit dominates the magnetic interactions of 1. Topologically, each MnII 2 subunit held by double μ-syn, anti-COO− homobridges can be considered as a node, and the bridging μ-N1,N4-atz and nip2−/Hbtc2− ligands can be treated respectively as two different linkers. Thus, the framework of 1 and 2 can be respectively predigested into a 4-connected CdSO4 topological network (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1). 3.3 Crystal structure of [Mn3(atz)2(H2O)12(btc)2] (3) Synthesized from the same chemical compositions as 2, complex 3 is a centrosymmetric trinuclear molecule bridged by a pair of μ-N2,N4-atz ligands. The asymmetry unit of 3 consists of one and a half crystallographically independent MnII atoms, one neutral atz ligand, a fully deprotonated btc3− anion, and six coordinated water molecules. Located at an inversion center, Mn1 atom in 3 is six-coordinated by two axial triazolyl N atoms from two separate atz molecules and four equatorial O donors from four aqua ligands (Fig. 2 a), adopting elongated octahedral coordination geometry with equatorial Mn–O distances slightly shorter than those of axial Mn–N separations (Table 3). In contrast, the Mn2 site in 3 is in a NO5 donor set surrounded by one atz ligand, one monodentate carboxylate from one btc3− anion, and four coordinated water molecules, exhibiting the distorted octahedral coordination geometry. The bond lengths of Mn–O and Mn–N are comparable with those in 1 and 2 (Table 3). The central Mn1 and two centrosymmetric Mn2 and Mn2A sites are aggregated together by a pair of bidentate bridging μ-N2,N4-atz ligands, leading to a linear trinuclear structure of 3 with the intermetallic separation of 6.6676(5)Å (Fig. 2a). The MnII⋯MnII distance of 3 is considerable longer than that bridged by three-atom carboxylate groups in both 1 and 2. The discrete trinuclear units of 3 are further stacked into a supramolecular layer (Fig. 2b) and a non-covalent network (Fig. S2) by strong O–H···N and O–H⋯O hydrogen-bonding interactions between the coordinated water molecule and amino group of atz ligand, as well as between the coordinated water molecule and carboxylate moiety of btc3− anion (Table S1). 3.4 Crystal structure of {[Mn2(atz)(H2O)4(btec)]·2H2O} n (4) Complex 4 has a layered motif with centrosymmetric btec4− extended metal chain interconnected by μ-N2,N4-atz bridge. There are one crystallographically independent MnII atom, one neutral atz ligand with a half site occupancy, half a fully deprotonated btec4− anion with an inversion center, two coordinated and one disordered lattice water molecules in the asymmetry unit of 4. As illustrated in Fig. 3 a, the unique Mn1 ion in 4 is also six-coordinated by one triazolyl N atom from one neutral atz ligand and five O donors from three carboxylate groups of two separate btec4− anions and two coordinated water molecules, exhibiting distorted octahedral coordination geometry (Table 4). Two crystallographically independent carboxylate groups belonging to one centrosymmetric btec4− anion hold two symmetry-related MnII ions into a dimeric MnII 2 core through a terminally monodentate and a bidentate bridging μ-syn, anti-COO− group with the intermetallic distance of 4.8528(2)Å. Each MnII 2 core is consolidated by four carboxylate groups from two neighboring btec4− ligands, which is further extended by the phenyl group of btec4− ligand to lead to a bent MnII-btec4− ribbon. Acting as a ditopic connector, the μ-N2,N4-atz ligand interconnects two neighboring MnII-btec4− ribbons into an infinite layer (Fig. 3b). The inter-ribbon MnII⋯MnII distance spanned by μ-N2,N4-atz is 6.7197(2)Å, slightly longer than that in 3. These layers are further stacked together into a supramolecular architecture by non-covalent O–H⋯O interaction between the coordinated water molecule and deprotonated carboxylate group of btec4− anion (Table S1 and Fig. S3). 3.5 PXRD patterns and thermogravimetric analyses The phase purity of the four bulk magnetic samples was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). As a result, the experimental and computer-simulated patterns for 1–4 were well matched (Fig. S4), suggesting that the bulk synthesized samples are homogenous. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the complexes were carried out to examine their thermal stability (Fig. S5). Complex 1 exhibited the first slow weight-loss process between 110 and 280°C, corresponding to the loss of two lattice water molecules (expt. 5.8%, calcd. 4.9%). Then, the second one for the collapse of the framework of 1 occurred at 380°C and ended at 495°C. Complex 2 can be thermally stable up to ca 290°C, and was followed by an obviously continuous weight-loss stage for the decomposition of the extended framework. For 3, a weight-loss stage of 21.7% was observed between 50 and 155°C due to the release of twelve coordinated water molecules (calcd. 22.4%), which was followed by a continuous weight-loss process, ascribing to the broken of the mixed atz and btc3− ligands. Complex 4 displays a weight-loss process from room temperature to 318°C, corresponding to the loss of lattice and coordinated water molecules (expt. 21.5%, calcd. 19.6%). The mixed atz and btec4− ligands of 4 were rapidly removed between 418 and 610°C, accompanying the collapse of the framework of 4. The final residue of the four complexes was all MnO (expt. 18.7%, calcd. 19.4% for 1; expt. 19.4%, calcd. 19.5% for 2; expt. 21.6%, calcd. 22.1% for 3; and expt. 25.4%, calcd. 25.7% for 4). 3.6 Magnetic properties Variable-temperature (2–300K) magnetic susceptibilities of 1–4 were measured under an applied field of 2.0kOe. Both the χ M T values of 1 and 2 are 8.65cm3 Kmol−1 at 300K (Fig. S6), which are close to the expected value for two magnetically isolated MnII ions (8.74cm3 Kmol−1) with S =5/2 and g =2.0. The χ M T products of 1 and 2 are almost constant from 300 to 100K. Once the temperature is lowered than 100K, a dramatic drop down to 1.27cm3 Kmol−1 for 1 and to 1.23cm3 Kmol−1 for 2 is respectively observed at 2.0K. The temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibility (χ M −1) obeys the Curie–Weiss law between 10 and 300K, with C =8.95cm3 Kmol−1 and θ =−4.50K for 1 and with C =8.83cm3 Kmol−1 and θ =−4.62K for 2. The negative Weiss constants θ suggest antiferromagnetic couplings transmitted by the mixed syn, anti-COO− and μ-N1,N4-atz heterobridges occur between the nearest MnII ions of 1 and 2. From the viewpoint of the magnetostructural correlations, the magnetic interactions of 1 and 2 are essentially dominated in the local {Mn2(COO)2} subunits due to the fact that the MnII⋯MnII distances separated either by phenyl backbone or by μ-N1,N4-atz are beyond the magnetically interacting range. Thus, the magnetic interactions of the two complexes can be further simplify to a binuclear model with spin Hamiltonian H =−2JS 1 S 2, in which the molecule field approximation can be introduced to evaluate the weak superexchange interaction transmitted by phenyl backbone and by μ-N1,N4-atz ligands. The experimental molar magnetic susceptibilities of 1 and 2 can be quantitatively fitted by the following Eqs. (1) and (2). (1) χ Mn 2 II = 2 Ng 2 β 2 kT × e 2 J / kT + 5 e 6 J / kT + 14 e 12 J / kT + 30 e 20 J / kT + 55 e 30 J / kT 1 + 3 e 2 J / kT + 5 e 6 J / kT + 7 e 12 J / kT + 9 e 20 J / kT + 11 e 30 J / kT (2) χ M T = χ Mn 2 II T / 1 - ( zJ ′ χ Mn 2 II / Ng 2 β 2 ) The best least-squares fitting of the theoretical equations to the experimentally magnetic data of 1 led to g =2.02, J =−0.34cm−1, zJ′=−0.13cm−1, and R =1.2×10−4 (R =Σ[(χ M T)obsd −(χ M T)calcd]2/Σ[(χ M T)obsd]2) for 1, and g =2.01, J =−0.32cm−1, zJ′=−0.11cm−1 and R =1.4×10−4 for 2. Obviously, the negative values for J and zJ′ confirm the consistently antiferromagnetic interactions mediated by syn, anti-COO− and μ-N1,N4-atz bridges, which are in a agreement with our previous results [26]. The χ M T value of 3 is 13.5cm3 Kmol−1 at 300K (Fig. S6), consistent with the theoretical value (13.1cm3 Kmol−1) for three magnetically uncoupled MnII ions with S =5/2 and g =2.0. As the temperature decreases, the χ M T value of 3 slowly decreases and down to 13.1cm3 Kmol−1 at 50K and then decreases rapidly to 6.28cm3 Kmol−1 at 2.0K. The plot of χ M −1 versus T follows the Curie–Weiss law with C =13.62cm3 Kmol−1 and θ =−1.97K. The negative value of θ also suggests an antiferromagnetic coupling appears in the MnII 3 molecule. To evaluate the strength of the antiferromagnetic superexchange, a linear MnII 3 model with H =−2J( S 1 S 2 + S 1 S 3 + S 2 S 3) was used to treat the magnetic data of 3 [32], in which the intermolecular magnetic coupling mediated by hydrogen bonds was considered by a molecular field approximation (zJ′). The experimental molar magnetic susceptibilities of 3 can thus be fitted by following Eqs. (3) and (4): (3) χ Mn 3 II = 2 Ng 2 β 2 kT × A B A = 35 + 680 e 25 J / kT + 455 e 20 J / kT + 286 e 15 J / kT + 620 e 10 J / kT + 286 e 7 J / kT + 84 e 5 J / kT + 330 e 4 J / kT + 84 e J / kT + 35 e - 2 J / kT + 286 e - 3 J / kT + 330 e - 4 J / kT + 84 e - 5 J / kT + 35 e - 6 J / kT + 10 e - 7 J / kT + 10 e - 11 J / kT + 35 e - 12 J / kT + 84 e - 13 J / kT + 166 e - 14 J / kT + 10 e - 17 J / kT + 36 e - 20 J / kT + 84 e - 23 J / kT + 10 e - 25 J / kT + 35 e - 30 J / kT B = 3 + 8 e 25 J / kT + 7 e 20 J / kT + 6 e 15 J / kT + 120 e 10 J / kT + 6 e 7 J / kT + 4 e 5 J / kT + 5 e 4 J / kT + 4 e J / kT + 3 e - 2 J / kT + 6 e - 3 J / kT + 5 e - 4 J / kT + 4 e - 5 J / kT + 3 e - 6 J / kT + 2 e - 7 J / kT + 2 e - 11 J / kT + 3 e - 12 J / kT + 4 e - 13 J / kT + 6 e - 14 J / kT + 2 e - 17 J / kT + 4 e - 20 J / kT + 4 e - 23 J / kT + 2 e - 25 J / kT + 3 e - 30 J / kT (4) χ M T = χ Mn 3 II T / [ 1 - ( zJ ′ χ Mn 3 II / Ng 2 β 2 ) ] The best-fit parameters are g =2.03, J =−0.15cm3 Kmol−1 and zJ′=−0.03 cm3 Kmol−1 with R =2.3×10−4. The negative J confirms the antiferromagnetic couplings of adjacent MnII ions in the trinuclear cluster by μ-N2,N4-atz mediator. The zJ′ component supports the weak inter-molecular antiferromagnetic contacts through the abundant hydrogen bonds. It should be noted that the coupling constant of 3 is comparable with the zJ′ of 1 and 2, which quantitatively ascribes the interaction strength by μ-N1,N4- and μ-N2,N4-atz mediators. The χ M T of 4 is 8.67cm3 Kmol−1 at 300K (Fig. S6), close to the expected value (8.74cm3 Kmol−1) for two magnetically isolated MnII ions with S =5/2 and g =2.0. Upon cooling, the χ M T of 4 decreases monotonously and reaches a value of 1.11cm3 Kmol−1 at 2.0K. The curve of χ M −1 versus T above 10K follows the Curie–Weiss law with C =8.91cm3 Kmol−1 and θ =−7.60K, meaning an antiferromagnetic coupling dominated in the nearest neighbors of 4. Similar to 1 and 2, complex 4 can also be treated as a binuclear magnetic model with S =5/2. Thus, the fitting results for 4 by Eqs. (1) and (2) are g =2.02, J =−0.46cm−1 and zJ′ =−0.18cm−1 with R =8.2×10−4. This negative value of J and zJ′ confirms the antiferromagnetic coupling through the μ-syn, anti-COO− and μ-N2,N4-atz bridges. 4 Conclusion Four 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole-based magnetic entities, two isostructural CdSO4-type frameworks, a centrosymmetric trinuclear oligomer, and an infinite layer, have been respectively generated by varying the number of carboxylate group appended on the phenyl skeleton. Structurally, the diverse dimensionality and the variable crystalline structures of the resulting complexes are significantly dominated by the number and the binding modes of the carboxylate-containing coligands. Magnetically, weak antiferromagnetic interactions with comparable coupling constants are transmitted within the locally binuclear {Mn2(μ-syn, anti-COO−)2} and trinuclear {Mn3(μ-N2,N4-atz)2} magnetic subunits.
