Three coordination polymers, [Cd(p-CPhH2IDC)(H2O)] n (p-CPhH4IDC=2-(4-carboxylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid) (1), [Cd3(p-CPhHIDC)2(H2O)6] n (2), and {[Cd2(p-CPhIDC)(2,2′-bipy)2]·H2O} n (2,2′-bipy=2,2′-bipyridine) (3), have been hydrothermally synthesized, and structurally characterized by elemental analyses, IR spectra, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and further characterized by thermogravimetric and solid-state fluorescence determinations. Polymer 1 presents a 2D doubled-layer architecture containing 1D distorted quadrilateral open channels. Polymer 2 emerges a 1D zigzag chain constructed by parallelogram clusters. Polymer 3 exhibits a net-like layer structure constructed by two types of wavy chains. The coordination features of the ligand p-CPhH4IDC have been discussed as well. Graphical abstract Three Cd(II) imidazole multi-carboxylate-based CPs have been hydrothermally prepared and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The thermal and solid-state photoluminescence properties of the polymers have been determined as well. Keywords Imidazole multi-carboxylate Cadmium Polymer Crystal structure Although the coordination polymers (CPs) have been explored and developed for about thirty years, people still have strong and continuous interest in preparing more desired CPs [1–5]. To obtain the CPs with specific topologies and properties, it would be highly desirable to design and choose various organic ligands as multi-functional linkers [6,7]. According to the accumulation of experience before, to get an ideal organic ligand with the hindrance and competition among the excellent functional groups is very helpful [8–10]. For the feasibility of aforesaid viewpoint, imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate (H3IDC) ligand gives us the confidence, which can be variously deprotonated to bond with metal ions by diversity of coordination modes, and act as hydrogen bonding donors or accepters [11,12]. Recently, people have introduced several kinds of substituted groups, such as, methyl, ethyl and propyl groups and etc, into the 2-position of the imidazole ring to modify H3IDC, and obtained lots of interesting CPs [11–15]. More-recently, the imidazole dicarboxylate derivatives bearing 2-position aromatic groups have drawn our intense concern [16–21]. It should be noticed that we previously only introduced the groups having no coordination ability or weak coordination ability, to modify H3IDC [16–20]. There is no example of the introduction of phenyl-carboxylate group. Now, considering the carboxylate unit can adopt a variety of bonding modes to metals, we hope to bring in the 4-carboxyphenyl group to H3IDC to enhance the coordination sites. Then, a promising ligand, 2-(4-carboxylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (p-CPhH4IDC) [22] is prepared and its coordination features are explored by us. Consequently, three coordination polymers, [Cd(p-CPhH2IDC)(H2O)] n (1), {[Cd3(p-CPhHIDC)2(H2O)6] n (2), and [Cd2(p-CPhIDC)(2,2′-bipy)2]·H2O} n (2,2′-bipy=2,2′-bipyridine) (3) have been hydrothermally synthesized [23] and structurally characterized. In the preparation processes of 2 and 3, two kinds of N-containing ancillary coligands, piperazine and 2,2′-bipy were added to observe their effects on the assembly of coordination polymers. X-ray crystal analyses [24] reveal that polymer 1 exhibits a 2D double-layer structure, which contains special 1D parallelogram channels composed by metal ions and water ligands. The coordination environment around the Cd(II) center is best portrayed as [CdO6N] polyhedron, ligated by one imidazole nitrogen atom (N2) (Cd-N=2.337(6)Å), five carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2, O4c, O6, O6b and O7b) from four individual anionic p-CPhH2IDC2− ligands and one water oxygen atom (O3) (Fig. 1a). The Cd-O distances are in the range of 2.252(5)–2.490(5)Å. The bond angles around the central Cd(II) ion range from 53.3(2) to 163.0(2)°. In 1, the p-CPhH2IDC2− unit is formed by losing one imidazole COO-H and one phenyl COO-H, adopting the coordination mode, μ 4-kO: kO,O′: kN,O″: kO″″ (Scheme 1a), to coordinate with four metal centers. Two oxygen atoms from two phenyl carboxylate groups link adjacent Cd(II) ions to generate a parallelogram. The neighboring parallelograms are paralleled to each other with the distance of 8.5380(1)Å and further give rise to the parallelepiped cage [Cd4(p-CPhH2IDC)6] with the links of two p-CPhH2IDC2− ligands. Afterwards, the cages are connected into 1D distorted quadrilateral open channel via the share of Cd(II) ions and oxygen atoms, which are further bridged through the phenyl carboxylate groups to yield a fascinating 2D stair-shape framework (Fig. 1b). From a topological viewpoint to see the (4,4)-connected 2D framework (Fig. S1), we can understand the 2D doubled-layer structure clearly. Through four kinds of intermolecular hydrogen bonds of NH⋯O and OH⋯O (Table S1), the adjacent layers are held together to build up an interesting 3D supramolecular framework with wide holes (Fig. S2), which looks like sugarcoated haws on a stick extremely. Within the organic ligands, the twists are present between the imidazole rings and phenyl planes with the dihedral angles of 44.210(3)°, 43.245(1)° and 41.778(1)° respectively, indicating the flexibility of p-CPhH2IDC2− unit. It is to be pointed out that in the preparation process of 2, the coligand, piperazine was added, but it was not involved in the coordination directly. However, it influenced the coordination features of the p-CPhH4IDC ligand, which loses one imidazole-H, one imidazole COO-H and one phenyl COO-H, leading to a new kind of coordination mode, μ 4-kO: kO,O′: kN,O″: kO″″ (Scheme 1b). Different from 1, compound 2 is a 1D polymeric structure. The crystallographically Cd(II) atoms are located in two kinds of coordination environments [CdNO5] and [CdN2O4] (Fig. 2a). The Cd-N lengths vary from 2.214(4) to 2.233(5)Å, and the Cd-O distances are in the range of 2.216(4)–2.500(4)Å being close to those in polymer 1. The bond angles around the central Cd(II) ion range from 55.23(13) to 146.82(16)°. Two adjacent Cd1 atoms are linked by two p-CPhIDC3− units to construct the [Cd2(p-CPhHIDC)2(H2O)4]2− cluster. As the nodes, the Cd2 ion is located at the middle position of two adjacent clusters and bridges them in the 1D zigzag chain (Fig. 2b). The carboxylate groups and water ligands all participate in the formation of hydrogen bonding interactions, forming abundant OH⋯O interactions (Table S1), which provide the sufficient account for the 3D stacking configuration (Fig. S3). The coligand 2,2-bipy which is highly chelating N-containing ligand, was added in the preparation process. And 1D polymeric chain is produced in general [16–20]. Surprisingly, polymer 3 is a 2D framework which contains both p-CPhIDC4− units and 2,2′-bipy ligands. The main reason is that the p-CPhIDC4− ligand exhibits strong coordination ability and holds the metal ions into a sheet structure. The ligand p-CPhH4IDC in 3 deprotonates completely and shows a coordination mode namely μ 4-kO: kO,O′: kN,O″: kO‴ (Scheme 1c). There also exist two types of coordination environments around the Cd(II) ions in 3 (Fig. 3a). The Cd1-N1 and Cd2-N2 lengths are 2.249(2)Å and 2.239(2)Å, respectively. The Cd1-O and Cd2-O lengths vary from 1.911(3) to 1.940(3)Å and from 2.2824(18) to 2.3701(19)Å, respectively. The LCdL (L=N or O) bond angles are in the range of 55.25(8)–161.06(7)°. Within the p-CPhIDC4− ligand, the dihedral angle between the phenyl and imidazole rings is 35.551(1)°. With the participation of p-CPhIDC4− ligands, the Cd1 atoms are bridged into 1D wave chains a (Fig. 3), in which the adjacent Cd⋯Cd distance is 9.418Å. Meanwhile, b chains (Fig. 3) are constructed from Cd2 atoms with neighbor Cd⋯Cd distance being 6.112Å. It should be noted that chains a and b are located in the plane alternately and are further connected into a 2D tortuous layer via the bridge of p-CPhIDC4− ligands (Fig. S4). From another perspective, five p-CPhIDC4− anions connect five Cd cations to build up a distorted [Cd5(p-CPhIDC)5] pentagon ring with Cd1⋯Cd2 distances being 6.2036(2) and 6.6612(1)Å. Every [Cd5(p-CPhIDC)5] rings share vertexes to form infinite chains, which are further pillared through the organic ligands, constructing a 2D framework (Fig. 3b). The IR spectra of polymers 1–3 display characteristic absorption bands of water molecules, carboxylate, imidazole and phenyl units. The broad absorption bands in the range of 3400–3500cm−1 indicate the presence of ν N H and ν O H stretching frequencies of imidazole rings and coordinated water molecules, respectively. The three complexes exhibit strong characteristic absorptions around the frequency range 1540–1700cm−1 ν as(COO−) and 1397–1440cm−1 ν s(COO−), respectively. The characteristic IR band of the phenyl ring at 768–796cm−1 is due to δ (CH) vibrations, which can be found at 794cm−1 for 1; 782cm−1 for 2; and 768cm−1 for 3. In conclusion, the infrared spectral data of the complexes 1–3 are consistent with crystal structure analyses. Thermogravimetric analysis studies were conducted to characterize the thermal stabilities of 1–3 in the range of 20–850°C (Fig. S5). The TG curve of 1 exhibits a two main steps weight loss process from 222 to 520°C. First, a gradual loss weight of 12.38% (calculated 12.28%) from 220 to 342°C corresponds to the release of one coordinated water molecule and one carboxyl unit. Subsequently, it keeps losing the remaining organic ligands from 342 to 527°C (observed 58.13%, calculated 57.99%). Finally, a plateau region is observed from 527 to 837°C. The amorphous residue is identified as CdO (observed 29.49%, calculated 29.73%). The TG curve of 2 indicates a relative low stability down to 125°C. After this temperature the sample shows two well-separated weight loss stages. Initially, it loses weight of 10.80% from 125 to 182°C attributing to the loss of six coordination water molecules (calculated 10.90%). The second weight loss of 51.22% from 277 to 495°C is assigned to the loss of p-CPhHIDC3− ligands (calculated 50.25%). The total weight loss is 62.02% (calculated 61.15%). The remaining weight of 37.98% corresponds to the percentage (calculated 38.85%) of the Cd and O components, indicating that the final product is CdO. The TG curve of 3 presents an initial weight loss of 2.2% from 70 to 149°C, which is ascribed to the release of one water ligand (calculated 2.18%). Then, no marked weight loss is observed until 384°C and the decomposition of the organic ligands finishes at 519°C (observed 66.03%, calculated 66.78%), leaving a solid residue of CdO (observed 31.7%, calculated 31.04%). As well known, CPs constructed by d10 metal centers usually show good photoluminescence properties, and are promising candidates for photoactive materials. Hence, we investigated the solid-state photoluminescent spectra of the polymers and the free ligand p-CPhH4IDC at room temperature under the same experimental condition (Fig. 4 ). The free p-CPhH4IDC ligand shows luminescence with the emission maximum at 492nm by selective excitation at 412nm, which may be attributed to the ligand-centered π*→n or π→π* electronic transitions [25–27]. Emission bands are observed at 414nm (λex=348nm) for 1, 458nm (λex=380nm) for 2, and 439nm (λex =359nm) for 3. In comparison to the free p-PhH4IDC ligand, blue shifts in 1, 2 and 3 can be observed. For polymers 1–3, owning to that metal Cd(II) is difficult to oxidize or reduce, then the emissions of the polymers are neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) in nature. This may be assigned to the mixture characteristics of intraligand and ligand-to-ligand charge transition (LLCT) [25–27]. In summary, three polymers derived from the newly prepared multifunctional organic ligand p-CPhH4IDC are reported here. By comparison of all the structures, we find that both N- and O-donors can modulate their conformations and coordination modes to satisfy the coordination preference of metal centers. The ligand p-CPhH4IDC displays three kinds of distinct coordination modes revealing its versatile coordination ability. The results reveal the excellent coordination prosperities of the new designed ligand. Furthermore, this work also confirms that it is highly desirable to introduce excellent ancillary groups for the rational design of the bridging ligands.
