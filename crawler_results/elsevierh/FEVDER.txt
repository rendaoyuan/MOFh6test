Graphical abstract Highlights ► Porous metal–organic frameworks with ins topology. ► High thermal stability and high enthalpy for CO2 adsorption. ► Selective sorption behavior of CO2 over N2 at 298K. Two new metal–organic frameworks {[Ni(L)2] ·4H2O} n (1) and {[Co(L)2]·4H2O} n (2) have been prepared by reactions of 3,5-di(pyridine-4-yl)benzoic acid (HL) with corresponding metal salt under solvothermal conditions, and characterized by single crystal and powder X-ray diffractions, IR, elemental and thermogravimetric analyses. 1 and 2 have the same 2-fold interpenetrating three-dimensional structure with ins topology and are porous frameworks upon desolvation. More importantly, the desolvated samples of 1 and 2 show high thermal stability, vapor adsorption of H2O, MeOH or EtOH, and high enthalpy for CO2 adsorption and high selectivity for CO2 over N2 at 298K, implying the potential application of the coordination polymers for capture and separation of CO2. Keywords Co(II) and Ni(II) coordination polymers Porous frameworks High thermal stability Sorption property 1 Introduction Microporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted wide attention, owing to their unusual architectures and applicable functions for catalysis, gas separation and storage [1–4]. Compared to the traditional sorption materials, such as inorganic zeolites and activated carbon, the pore structures of MOFs can be more easily designed and functionally modified to yield desired shape, size, and surface characteristics [5,6]. The MOFs with flexible structures are of especial interest due to their potential applications in gas separation with unique mechanisms. It has been reported that a reversible transformation of open/close frameworks is accompanied by guest molecules sorption processes [7–11]. However, construction of such MOFs in control of stability and functionality is still facing great challenges. In fact, for any practical application, the thermal and water stabilities of these materials are very important. Unfortunately, thermal and water instabilities are major problems for most of MOFs [12,13]. Generally, the thermal stability of flexible structures is less than that of rigid ones. Guest-free flexible MOFs with high thermal stability are very limited except MIL-53 and related compounds with structural flexibility and high stability [14–20]. On the other hand, CO2 as a major greenhouse gas mainly contributes to the global warming causing climate changes, which is one of the greatest environmental challenges facing worldwide. The CO2 selective separation is an important topic in gas adsorption and separation area [21,22]. Microporous MOFs as a new type of porous material is a promising candidate for CO2 selective separation. In regard to versatile methods of enhancing CO2 sorption selectivity in MOFs, considerable attentions have been focused on the use of amine/amide-containing ligands or generation of exposed metal sites to decorated the channels, which have enabled the pores to preferentially interact with CO2 molecules over other gasses, owing to large quadrupolar moment of CO2 [23–25]. Herein, we report two new isostructural microporous MOFs namely {[Ni(L)2]·4H2O} n (1) and {[Co(L)2]·4H2O} n (2) [HL=3,5-di(pyridine-4-yl)benzoic acid] with non-coordinated pyridine decorated pores. Remarkably, 1 and 2 are porous frameworks with high stability and excellent sorption selectivity and high adsorption enthalpy for CO2. In addition, H2O, MeOH and EtOH vapor sorption behaviors are investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and measurements All commercially available chemicals and solvents are of reagent grade and were used as received without further purification. Ligand HL was prepared according to the reported procedures [26]. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were performed on a Perkin–Elmer 240C Elemental Analyzer. FT-IR spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000cm−1 on a Bruker Vector22 FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a simultaneous SDT 2960 thermal analyzer under nitrogen with a heating rate of 10Kmin−1. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ =1.5418Å), in which the X-ray tube was operated at 40kV and 40mA at room temperature. CO2, N2 and vapors of H2O, MeOH and EtOH sorption experiments were carried out on a Belsorp-max volumetric gas sorption instrument, while CH4 and H2 sorption measurements were performed on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1MP. 2.2 Synthesis of {[Ni(L)2] ·4H2O }n(1) A mixture of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (29.1mg, 0.1mmol), HL (55.3mg, 0.2mmol) in 10mL H2O was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, and the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 6.0 by using 1M KOH solution, then MeOH (5mL) was added. The vessel was sealed and heated at 140°C for 3days. After cooling to the room temperature, block light-blue crystals of 1 were collected by filtration and washed by water for several times with a yield of 40%. Anal.

Yield: 52%. Anal. Calcd. for C34CoH30N4O8(%): C, 59.91; H, 4.45; N, 8.22. Found: C, 59.88; H, 4.43; N, 8.20.

The structures were solved by direct methods, and all non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically on F2 with the full-matrix least-squares technique using SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 programs, respectively [27,28]. All the hydrogen atoms of the ligands were generated geometrically, while those of H2O molecules were not found from the difference Fourier map. The details of the crystal parameters, data collection and refinements for 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1 , and selected bond lengths and angles of 1 and 2 are listed in Table 2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structures of {[Ni(L)2] ·4H2O}n (1) and {[Co(L)2] ·4H2O}n (2) Both 1 and 2 crystallize in monoclinic space group P21/c with similar cell parameters (Table 1). The results of crystallographic analysis indicate that they have the same framework structure and thus only the structure of 1 is described here in detail. The coordination environment of the Ni(II) center in 1 is shown in Fig. 1 a with atom numbering scheme. Each Ni(II) atom is coordinated by three pyridine nitrogen atoms (N1A, N2B and N3C) from three distinct L− ligands, three oxygen atoms (O1, O2 and O4) from two different L− ligands. The bond angles around the Ni(II) atom are in the range of 62.01(8)–172.45(11)°, thus the Ni(II) atom has distorted octahedral coordination geometry with a N3O3 donor set. The bond lengths of Ni1–O are in the range of 2.031(2)–2.148(2)Å and the Ni1–N ones are from 2.042(3) to 2.142(3)Å (Table 2), which are similar to previously reported values [29]. On the other hand, the L− ligands in 1 adopt two different coordination modes (mode A and mode B, Fig. S1). In mode A, the L− ligand acts as a μ 2-bridge to link two Ni(II) atoms: one pyridine nitrogen atom connects one Ni(II) atom, and the carboxylate group adopting μ 1−η 1:η 0 monodentate mode ligates the other Ni(II). While in mode B, the L− ligand acts as a μ 3-bridge to link three Ni(II) atoms: two pyridine nitrogen atoms link two Ni(II) atoms, the carboxylate group adopting μ 1−η 1:η 1 chelate mode connects the third Ni(II). In general, the Ni(II) atoms are linked together by L− ligands with mode B to generate 2-fold interpenetrating two-dimensional (2D) networks (Fig. 1b). Then, the 2D layers are further pillared by L− ligands with mode A to produce a 2-fold interpenetrated 3D framework (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, although interpenetration occurred in 1, there are 1D channels along a axis in this resultant framework occupied by free water molecules (Fig. 1d). Further more, the channels are decorated by uncoordinated pyridine nitrogen atoms. PLATON [30] calculations show that the solvent accessible void is 561.9Å3, 17.4% (579.7Å3, 17.8% for 2) per unit cell. To further understand the structure of 1, topological analysis by reducing multidimensional structure to simple node-and-linker net was performed. Based on the simplification principle [31], the L− ligand with mode A ligates two Ni(II) atoms and can be considered as a 2-connector, while each L− ligand with mode B links three Ni(II) atoms, which can be regarded as a 3-connector. On the other hand, each Ni(II) atom is a 4-connected node since it links four L− ligands. Hence, the overall structure of 1 is a (3, 4)-connected 2-nodal 3D net with stoichiometry (3-c)(4-c), as shown in Fig. 1e. Topology analysis by TOPOS program [32,33] suggests the Point (Schläfli) symbol of the net is (63)(65.8) which is a typical ins topology. 3.2 Thermal behaviors of the frameworks The thermal stabilities of 1 and 2 were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in the N2 atmosphere from 298–873K and the results are shown in Fig. S2. For 1 and 2, weight losses of 10.11% and 10.37% were observed in the temperature range of ca. 300–372K, respectively, which correspond to the liberation of four free water molecules (calcd. 10.58% for 1 and 2), and further weight losses were observed at about 688K, owing to the collapse of the frameworks. Samples after dehydration show similar weight loss curves (Fig. S2), implying the good stability of the frameworks. 3.3 Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and the dynamic nature Fig. 2 a shows the PXRD patterns of 1 under different conditions. The similarity of simulated PXRD pattern from single-crystal data of 1 with that for as-synthesized sample 1 indicates that the single crystal is representative of the bulk sample. For 1, the desolvated framework exhibits changes in peak positions and the emergence of new peaks compared to the as-synthesized one. However, the structure of the activated compound could not be determined. The PXRD patterns of the H2O, MeOH and EtOH vapor adsorption samples match quite well with the as-synthesized one, indicating that H2O/MeOH/EtOH molecules can induce the framework to deform reversibly [34]. The high thermal stability of 1 has been demonstrated using variable temperature PXRD (VT-PXRD) experiments (Fig. 2b). The VT-PXRD patterns of as-synthesized sample up to 673K show that the framework is stable up to ca. 663K, which is consistent with the thermogravimetric analysis. The thermal stability of porous MOFs is usually limited to 473–623K [35–37]. For 2, similar stability are observed (Fig. S3). 3.4 Sorption properties 3.4.1 Gas sorption The porosity and high stability of the frameworks prompted us to examine their gas/vapor uptake behavior. Because of the similar sorption behavior of dehydrated 1 and 2, herein, we only discuss 1 in detail. The activated sample was prepared by heating 1 under vacuum at 383K for 10h. Fig. 3 shows sorption of CO2 (at 195K, kinetic diameter 3.3Å), N2 (at 77K, 3.6Å), H2 (at 77K, 2.9Å) and CH4 (at 195K, 3.8Å) up to 1atm for 1 (for 2 see Fig. S4). The N2 sorption isotherm exhibits type Ш sorption profile, suggesting that only surface adsorption occurs. The H2 and CH4 sorption isotherms also show very limited uptakes (6.8 and 5.6cm3 g−1 at STP for H2 and CH4, respectively). In contrast, the CO2 sorption isotherms performed at 195K show steep uptake in the low-pressure region with hysteresis for desorption (Fig. 3). The maximum CO2 uptake at 1atm are 71.1cm3 g−1 (14.0wt.%) for dehydrated 1 corresponding to 1.9 CO2 molecules per formula unit. The Langmuir and BET surface areas of dehydrated 1 estimated from the CO2 adsorption isotherm are 321 and 300m2 g−1, respectively. More interestingly, the CO2 uptake is 17.3cm3 g−1 (3.4wt.%) at 298K (28.6cm3 g−1, 5.6wt.% at 273K), but almost no N2 adsorption (0.3cm3 g−1, 0.04wt.% at 298K and 1atm, Fig. 4 ) was observed for 1 (for 2 see Fig. S5). The CO2 adsorption amount on the desolvated 1 is lower than the best MOF for CO2 storage (MOF-74-Mg [38], 35.2%) or commercial adsorbents (such as zeolite 5A [39,40]) due to its small cavity volume, but still comparable to those of IRMOF-1 [41] (3.6wt.%) and MAF-2 (3.7wt.%) [42] under similar conditions. The selectivity of CO2/N2 at 298K is calculated to be 53: 1 (v/v) at 1atm. To our knowledge, MOFs with such high CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity at ambient conditions were rarely reported [21,22,43–45]. At 0.16atm (a pressure close to the CO2 concentration in a power plant flue gas stream), the ratio of CO2/N2 adsorption amount of 1 is 113, which is lower than the value for the best MOFs (such as [Zn2(BPDC)2(DPE)] (BPDC2− =4,4′-biphenyl dicarboxylate, DPE=1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene) [46] and [MMEN–Mg2(DOBPDC)] (MMEN=N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine, DOBPDC4− =4,4′-dioxido-3,3′-biphenyldicarboxylate) [47]), but it matches with those of [Zn2(BPDC)2(BPE)]n (BPE=1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane) [48] and [Ni(DCPY)(BIPY)0.5]n (DCPY=3-(2′,5′-dicarboxylphenyl)pyridine, BIPY=4,4′-bipyridine) [49]. The distinct difference of adsorption capacity between CO2 and N2 and the hysteresis of CO2 sorption at 195K prompt us to study the enthalpy of CO2 adsorption. The isosteric adsorption enthalpy (Q st) as a function of the quantity of gasses adsorbed were calculated by the virial method (see the ESI) using experimental isotherms at 273 and 298K (Fig. S6). It shows that Q st exhibits maxima of 34.9kJmol−1 at initial coverage, which is comparable to the MOFs with amine/amide decorated pores, such as amino-MIL-53 (Al) (38.4kJmol−1) [50], NJU-Bai3 (36.5kJmol−1) [51]. The significant CO2 sorption selectivity and higher Q st value in 1 imply that there should be relatively strong interactions between the CO2 molecules and the pore surfaces. As described above, the pore walls of the desolvated framework are decorated by the non-coordinated pyridine nitrogen atoms, which can induce strong interactions between the framework and CO2 molecules because of the large quadrupole moment of CO2 (−4.3 B of CO2, −1.5 B of N2 molecules). Namely, the driving force for the selective adsorption of CO2 is the attractive electrostatic interactions, rather than the size of adsorbed molecules, which can be further confirmed by the first step adsorption of MeOH (kinetic diameter 3.80Å) vapor (see below). 3.4.2 Vapor sorption Inspired by the different gas sorption profiles, we studied the vapor sorption of 1 using different solvent molecules with different polarity and size such as H2O (kinetic diameter, 2.65Å), MeOH (3.8Å) and EtOH (4.3Å) (Fig. 5 ). The H2O adsorption profile undergoes slight and distinct steps at p ∼0.08 and 0.19atm, respectively. The saturated adsorbed amount of ca. 150cm3 g−1 corresponds to 4.08 H2O molecules per formula unit, which is close to the maximum amount of 4.0 H2O molecules, as indicated by crystallographic analysis. Similar to the H2O adsorption, the MeOH and EtOH adsorption isotherms also exhibit stepwise uptake (at p ∼0.21 and 0.36atm for MeOH, at p ∼0.90atm for EtOH). The final values are 92.2cm3 g−1 and 33.7cm3 g−1, respectively, corresponding to 2.5 MeOH and 0.9 EtOH molecules per formula unit. The desorption curves in all cases not follow the adsorption one and show distinct hysteresis. Importantly, the first uptakes at p <0.21 for MeOH and p <0.90atm for EtOH, respectively, indicate that MeOH/EtOH molecules with larger kinetic diameter can directly get into the pores, which further confirms that the driving force for the selective adsorption of CO2 is the electrostatic interactions, rather than the size of adsorbed molecules. The obvious hysteresis and stepwise process of vapor adsorption profiles of l are characteristic of dynamic microporosity of MOFs, which are realized by the strong interactions between the adsorbate and the pore surfaces [52–56]. Reversible sorption is observed as proven by the changes in relative intensities of the reflections. 4 Conclusion We have synthesized and characterized two new MOFs with non-coordinated pyridine nitrogen atoms decorated channels that exhibit porous frameworks with high stabilities. Importantly, excellent sorption selectivity and high adsorption enthalpy for CO2, make them promising candidates for the capture of CO2 from industrial flue gas or the removal of CO2 from the natural gas.

<p>Estimation of the isosteric heats of gas adsorption<br>A virial-type [1] expression comprising the temperature-independent parameters a and b was<br>i i<br>employed to calculate the enthalpies of adsorption for CO (at 273 and 298 K) on desolvated<br>2<br>1. In each case, the data were fitted using the equation:<br>m n<br>lnP lnN 1/Ta Ni b Nj<br>i j<br>i0 j0<br>Here, P is the pressure expressed in Pa, N is the amount adsorbed in mmol g-1, T is the<br>temperature in K, a and b are virial coefficients, and m, n represent the number of<br>i j<br>coefficients required to adequately describe the isotherms (m and n were gradually increased<br>until the contribution of extra added a and b coefficients was deemed to be statistically<br>insignificant towards the overall fit, and the average value of the squared deviations from the<br>experimental values was minimized). The values of the virial coefficients a through a were<br>0 m<br>then used to calculate the isosteric heat of adsorption using the following expression.<br>m<br>Q RaN j<br>st i<br>i0<br>Q is the coverage-dependent isosteric heat of adsorption and R is the universal gas constant.<br>st<br>[1] Rowsell, J.
