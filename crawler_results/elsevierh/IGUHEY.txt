Graphical abstract Three new luminescent silver coordination polymers have been successfully synthesized by solution phase reaction of silver nitrate with different dicarboxylates and a cooperative heterocyclic 2-aminopyrimidine ligand under the ammoniacal condition. The structures of the three complexes which span from 2-D to 3-D networks, indicating that dicarboxylates play important roles in the formation of such coordination architectures. Using the principle of crystal engineering, three new silver metal–organic coordination polymers, [Ag2(L1)2(L2)]·2H2O (1), [Ag2(L1)2(L3)]·H2O (2), [Ag2(L1)2(L4)]·2H2O (3) (L1=2-aminopyrimidine, L2=oxalate anion, L3=glutarate anion and L4=1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate anion) have been synthesized by solution phase reactions of silver nitrate with various dicarboxylic acids and cooperative heterocyclic 2-aminopyrimidine ligand under the ammoniacal conditions. All the complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, IR spectra and X-ray diffraction. In complex 1, L1 ligands are coordinated to Ag(I) metal centers in rare tridentate fashions, forming one-dimensional (1-D) ladder-like structure, which is interlinked by L2 anions to generate 2-D pleated molecular sheet. Complex 2 displays an interesting two-dimensional (2-D) tongue-and-groove structure containing a new kind of “T-shaped” unit. Meanwhile, each of 2-D bilayers is interlocked by four adjacent identical motifs to form three-dimensional (3-D) 5-fold interpenetrating conformation with weak Ag···Ag interactions. In complex 3, L1 ligands are coordinated to the Ag(I) ions to form 1-D polymeric chain. And L4 anions, acting as bridging linkers through corresponding μ2-carboxylates, link a pair of Ag(I) atoms from adjacent chains to yield 3-D supramolecular network. The structures of complexes 1–3 which span from 2-D to 3-D networks suggest that dicarboxylate anions play important role in the formation of such coordination architectures. Keywords Ag(I) 2-Aminopyrimidine Dicarboxylic acids Coordination polymer Ag···Ag interactions 1 Introduction The current interest in coordination polymeric frameworks stems not only from their intriguing variety of architectures and topologies, but also their potential applications in luminescence, nonlinear optics, porous materials, and catalysis [1–10]. The construction of molecular architecture depends on the combination of several factors, such as the solvent system, template, temperature, counter ion, ratio of ligands to metal ions, coordination geometry of central metals and organic ligands [11–14]. In this regard, the organic anions play important roles in directing the final structures and topologies of their coordination polymers. The dicarboxylates, as important organic anions, have attracted intense interest from chemists due to its versatile coordination modes in the assembly of polymeric structures [15–22]. So far, although dicarboxylates are widely utilized in the construction of coordination polymers [6,15–30], metal–organic frameworks (especially for central metal silver) built by dicarboxylates and heterocyclic pyrimidine and its derivatives, are relatively rare [31,32]. On the other hand, heterocyclic pyrimidine and its derivatives, in spite of their simplicity, are very versatile systems. Their ability for giving specific H-bonding patterns as a key step in the storage and transmission of genetic information is a well-known process [33]. Moreover, their efficiency in binding transition metal ions is also well known. Indeed, they are very useful to develop polymeric metal–organic hybrid frameworks (MOFs) owing to their demonstrated ability to coordinate to the metal centers through various bonding modes, and to form very stable hydrogen-bonded chain arrays via their stereochemically associative amino and hetero ring nitrogens [34–43]. In our recent studies, 2-aminopyrimidine and its derivatives have been successfully used to construct a series of Ag(I) complexes with dinuclear, tetranuclear, 1-D and 2-D structures [44,45]. However, we also noticed that it is difficult to get high-dimensional structure only using 2-aminopyrimidine or its derivatives without other secondary ligands. As a continuation of our work, we try to introduce dicarboxylates into previous silver/aminopyrimidine system, and obtain surprisingly three new coordination polymers spanning from 2-D to 3-D frameworks. Herein, we describe syntheses and crystal structures of the three silver(I) complexes: [Ag2(L1)2(L2)]·2H2O (1), [Ag2(L1)2(L3)]·H2O (2), [Ag2(L1)2(L4)]·2H2O (3) (where L1=2-aminopyrimidine, L2=oxalate anion, L3=glutarate anion and L4=1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate anion). Our study shows that the structures of dicarboxylate anions play important role in the formation of these silver(I) complexes. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Instrumentation All reagents and solvents in the syntheses were of reagent grade, and they were used without further purification. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet AVATAT FT-IR360 spectrometer as KBr pellets in the frequency range 4000–400cm−1. The elemental analyses (C, H, N contents) were determined on a CE instruments EA 1110 analyzer. Photoluminescence measurements were performed on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with solid powder on a 1cm quartz round plate. 2.2 Synthesis of complex [Ag2(L1)2(L2)]·2H2O (1) A mixture of AgNO3 (170mg, 1mmol), 2-aminopyrimidine (94mg, 1mmol) and oxalate (90mg, 1mmol) were stirred in CH3OH–H2O mixed solvent (10mL, v/v: 1/1). Then aqueous NH3 solution (25%) was dropped into the mixture to give a clear solution. The resultant solution was allowed slowly to evaporate in darkness at room temperature for several days to give colorless crystals of 1 (Yield, 50%). They were washed with a small volume of cold CH3OH and diethyl ether. Anal. Calc. for Ag2C10H14N6O6: C, 22.66; H, 2.66; N, 15.85. Found: C, 22.61; H, 2.71; N, 15.76%.

Colorless crystals of 3 were obtained in 55% yield. Anal. Calc. for Ag2C20H20N6O6: C, 36.61; H, 3.07; N, 12.81. Found: C, 36.70; H, 3.12; N, 12.88%.

Data was collected on a Bruker-AXS CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation source (λ =0.71073Å) for 1–3. All absorption corrections were performed with the sadabs program [46]. All the structures were solved by direct methods using shelxs-97 [47] and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques using shelxl-97 [48]. All the non-hydrogen atoms were treated anisotropically. The positions of hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically. The crystallographic details of 1–3 are summarized in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and bond angles of 1–3 are displayed in Table 2 . The hydrogen bond geometries are shown in Table S1 (in the Supplementary data). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Syntheses and IR spectra The syntheses of complexes 1–3 are carried out in the darkness to avoid photodecomposition and summarized in Scheme S1, in the Supplementary data. The formation of the products is not significantly affected by changes of the reaction mole ratio of organic ligands to metal ions, and the resultant crystals are insoluble in water and common organic solvents. The infrared spectra and elemental analyses of 1–3 are fully consistent with their formations. Their IR spectra exhibit the absorptions in the range of ∼3296 to ∼3400cm−1, corresponding to the N–H stretching vibrations of the amide group. Strong characteristic bands of carboxylic groups are observed in the range of ∼1630 to ∼1560cm−1 for the asymmetric vibrations and ∼1480 to ∼1350cm−1 for symmetric vibrations, respectively. The absence of the characteristic bands at around ∼1700cm−1 attributed to the protonated carboxylic groups, indicating that the complete deprotonation of all carboxylate groups in 1-3 upon reaction with Ag ions [49]. 3.2 Crystal structure of [Ag2(L1)2(L2)]·2H2O (1) The present X-ray crystal structure analysis suggests that complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. The C 2 axis lies in the midpoint of C–C single bond of L2 anion, hence, each asymmetric unit contains one Ag(I) ion, one L1 ligand, a half L2 anion and one uncoordinated water. As shown in Fig. 1 a, each four-coordinate Ag, which adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry, is coordinated by two bridging L1 nitrogen atoms, one amino nitrogen atom and one deprotonated oxalic acid oxygen atom. The largest N(2)–Ag(1)–O(2) angle opened up to 132.69(8)° from the ideal tetrahedral angle while the remaining angles are in the range from 104.81(8) to 123.33(9)°. It is noteworthy that the Ag–N distances to amino nitrogen atoms [Ag(1)–N(3A)=2.540(3)Å] are significantly longer than those to the pyrimidyl nitrogen atoms [Ag(1)–N(1)=2.313(2) and Ag(1)–N(2B)=2.312(2)Å]. This difference may partially be due to the electronic effect between amino nitrogen and pyrimidyl nitrogen atoms. Interestingly, As far as we know, most of aminopyrimidine derivatives often adopt N-monodentate and N,N′-bidentate coordination modes with silver atoms via pyrimidyl nitrogen atoms, and the only example with tridentate fashion was ever reported by Wang [40]. Here, L1 ligands are coordinated to the Ag(I) metal centers by taking this rare N,N′,N″-tridentate modes to form 1-D ladder structures (Fig. 1b), which were interlinked by L2 anions [Ag(1)–O(2)=2.630(4)Å] to generate 2-D pleated molecular sheets (Fig. 1c). Each L2 anion is coordinated to the metal centers in a bidentate μ1-O, μ1-O′-bonding mode. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1c, in each molecular sheet, the Ag(I) ions, L1 ligands and L2 anions are interlinked to form chair-like eight-membered binuclear ring and 18-membered metallocycles in each molecular sheet. Two kinds of intermolecular hydrogen bonds are observed in the 18-membered metallocycles, including N–H···O hydrogen bonds where the amino group of L1 ligands serve as donors while the uncoordinated oxygen atoms on the L2 anions act as acceptors [N(3)–H(3C)···O(1)i, 2.843(4)Å, ∠ N–H···O, 141.7°; symmetry code: (i), x, y−1, z], and O–H···O hydrogen bonds where oxygen atoms of L2 anions serve as acceptors while hydrogen atoms of uncoordinated water act as donors [O(1W)–H(1WB)···O(2)ii, 2.957(6)Å, ∠ O–H···O, 157.0°; symmetry code: (ii), −x +1, y +1, −z +1/2]. 3.3 Crystal structure of [Ag2(L1)2(L3)]·H2O (2) When oxalate is replaced by more flexible glutarate and reacted with AgNO3 and L1 ligand under the similar synthetic conditions, a fascinating 3-D structure of 2 is produced. The molecular ORTEP drawing of 2 together with the atom-numbering scheme is depicted in Fig. 2 a. X-ray crystal structure determination displays that 2 consists of molecular bilayers with T-shaped blocks as the fundamental building units, in which each central Ag(I) cation adopts a T-shaped coordination configuration with two pyrimidyl nitrogen donors [Ag(1)–N(1A)=2.317(5) and Ag(1)–N(2)=2.219(5)Å] of L1 ligand in the horizontal direction. The coordination sphere is completed by one oxygen donor [Ag(1)–O(2)=2.290(5)Å] of one deprotonated glutarate (L3) in the axial direction, forming a new type of T-shaped unit. Fig. 2b shows that 2 contains molecular bilayer motifs, and Fig. 2c gives the schematic representation of corresponding bilayer motif. Each L1 as a bidentate ligand links Ag(I) centers to form infinite 1-D chains in the ab plane, and intramolecular N–H···O hydrogen bonds occur in the 1-D chains where oxygen atoms of L3 anions serve as acceptors while the uncoordinated amino groups of L1 ligands act as donors [H···O, 2.02–2.06Å, N···O, 2.863(6)–2.897(7)Å, ∠ N–H···O, 163.7–167.5°]. Interestingly, two kinds of extended modes are observed for these 1-D chains (herein designated as A and B). When viewed from above the ab plane, Fig. 2b shows that two related [Ag(L1)]∞ chains are interlaced. The complete deprotonated L3 anions, acting as pillars, interlink the upper and lower chains to generate bilayer galleries. The width of the galleries is determined by the length of L1 ligand (6.448Å), and their height is fixed by the length of L3 anion (9.847Å). To the best of our knowledge, most of the reported silver(I) metal–organic frameworks containing such bilayer motifs have focused on the structures based on single ligand 4,4′-bipy or other mixed ligands with 4,4′-bipy bridges. However, there are no such a distinctive tongue-and-groove structure of 3-D frameworks of coordination polymers with aminopyrimidine bridges reported in the literature. Furthermore, a remarkable feature of the structure of 2 is that the bilayer is sustained by the long L3 anion and short L1 ligand and displays an unusual entanglement (see Fig. S1, in the Supplementary data). Its structure belongs to a kind of 2-D to 3-D parallel interpenetration of “thick” layers: the 2-D layers interpenetrate each other in quintuple mode and the 5-fold interpenetrating results in Ag···Ag interactions. The separations between silvers are alternatively 3.269 and 3.241Å, which are slightly shorter than the summed van der Waal radius of two silver atoms (3.44Å) [50,51], indicating the existence of weak Ag···Ag interactions. In the molecular bilayer, the lattice water molecule is enclathrated in the cavity of the bilayer and it forms a hydrogen bond with the O1 atom of L3 anion [O(1w)···O(1)i =2.809(7)Å, symmetry code: (i), −x−1/2, y +1/2, −z−1/2]. Obvious changes are observed from the structures and dimensions (2-D(1) to 3-D(2)) of 1 and 2. The striking structural difference between 1 and 2 is simply caused by different –CH2– spacers in the dicarboxylate anions, i.e., L3 anion with longer spacers than L2 anion shows more flexible in nature, which allows the anion to bend and rotate freely when coordinating to metal centers. 3.4 Crystal structure of [Ag2(L1)2(L4)]·2H2O (3) When using rigid aromatic 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate instead of oxalate to react with AgNO3 and L1 under the similar synthetic conditions, complex 3 with a different structural type from others has been obtained. Single crystal X-ray analysis reveals that complex 3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnna. The asymmetric unit consists of two Ag(I) ions, two L1 ligands, one L4 anion, and two uncoordinated water molecules. The charge neutrality is achieved by the fully deprotonated carboxylate groups of 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate. As shown in Fig. 3 a, two independent Ag(I) ions have similar coordination environments, and each central Ag(I) ion is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms [Ag(1)–N(3)=2.322(4), Ag(1)–N(3A)=2.322(4)Å; Ag(2)–N(1)=2.180(4), Ag(2)–N(1A)=2.180(4)Å] from two L1 ligands and two oxygen atoms [Ag(1)–O(1)=2.406(3), Ag(1)–O(1A)=2.406(3)Å; Ag(2)–O(1B)=2.579(3), Ag(2)–O(1C)=2.579(3)Å] from different L4 anions in a tetrahedral geometry. All the Ag–N and Ag–O bond distances are within the normal range [35,52,53]. Two such asymmetric units are connected to form a centrosymmetrically tetranuclear 12-membered metallocycle [Ag4(L1)2(L4)2]. There is a quadrangle core in the discrete tetranuclear unit. The interatomic distances of Ag–Ag are 6.287Å on the long sides of the quadrangle and 3.925Å on the short sides of the quadrangle, excluding any direct metal–metal interaction. The 12-membered rings are interconnected each other through L1 ligands to generate 1-D double polymeric chains (Fig. 3b). Each L1 ligand has similar N,N′-bidentate coordination mode. Moreover, acting as bridging linkers through corresponding μ2-carboxylates, L4 anions connect a pair of adjacent Ag(I) atoms to yield 3-D supramolecular networks (Fig. 3c). It is noteworthy that L4 anions hold the same coordination mode with different naphthyl orientation. In addition, lattice water molecules occupy the residual space and are hydrogen bonded to the carboxylate groups from L4 anions [O(1w)···O(2)=2.941(6) and O(1w)···O(2)i =2.944(5)Å, symmetry code: (i) x, −y +3/2, −z +5/2]. 4 Conclusions With the principal aim of obtaining new high-dimensional coordination polymers with interesting photoluminescence, we try to introduce dicarboxylates into previous silver/aminopyrimidine system, and get three new silver(I) coordination polymers spanning from 2-D to 3-D frameworks. The analysis of the crystallographic data of 1–3 clearly shows that the structures of dicarboxylate anions are the key factors in directing self-assembly such diverse structures of these silver(I) complexes.
