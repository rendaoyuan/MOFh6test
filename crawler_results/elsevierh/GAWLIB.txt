Tel.: +86 20 88302604. A new three-dimensional terbium-carboxylate framework [Tb4L3(H2O)9]·7H2O (1) [(H4L=4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic acid)] has been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized. The framework contains Tb2 and Tb4 clusters, and exhibits an unprecedented 4-nodal (3,4,5,8)-connected topology. In addition, the thermogravimetric analysis, luminescent and magnetic properties were investigated. Graphical abstract A new terbium metal-organic framework featuring an unprecedented 4-nodal (3,4,5,8)-connected topology has been constructed by the assembly of Tb2 and Tb4 clusters and 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalate tetracarboxylate ligand, which exhibits both antiferromagnetic and strong luminescent properties. Highlights ► A new terbium-carboxylate framework possessing Tb2 and Tb4 clusters. ► The framework displays an unprecedented 4-nodal (3,4,5,8)-connected net. ► The framework exhibits both antiferromagnetic and green luminescent properties. Keywords Metal-organic framework Lanthanide Topology Luminescence Lanthanide metal-organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs) represent a growing subject because of their extraordinary coordination traits and particular luminescent, magnetic and catalytic properties [1], and the peculiarity of intense and narrow luminescence wavelength of Ln-MOFs that makes them can be potentially applied as fluorescent probes and electroluminescent devices [2]. Especially, the clusters-based Ln-MOFs have been paid more attention because the cluster not only enhances the structural thermostability but also favors the formation of noninterpenetrated framework, which is crucial quality for the practical applications of Ln-MOFs as storage materials because noninterpenetration holds more available void for gas inclusion [3]. However, in comparison with widely investigated MOFs based on transition metal clusters, the lanthanide clusters-based MOFs are not well developed, which may result from that the lanthanide center tends to form high coordination number, thus the single metal and dinuclear metal building units are easily generated to avoid steric interactions among ligands around the metal center, therefore the assembly of cluster-based Ln-MOF remains challenging. We herein utilize 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic acid (H4L) for the construction of cluster-based Ln-MOF from the following reasons: 1) besides versatile coordination modes generated by multicarboxylate groups, H4L has three configurations (Scheme 1 ) caused by the rotation of CC bonds between the C(CF3)2 group and two end benzene rings [4], which can satisfy the complex coordination geometry of lanthanide center; 2) the adjacent arrangement of the carboxylate groups on each benzene ring can allow the neighboring carboxylate groups to bind different lanthanide centers, generating metal-carboxylate cluster; 3) H4L has recently been utilized to construct MOFs with transition metal ions Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+, respectively, which display well luminescent, magnetic and sorptive properties [4,5], however, Ln-MOF containing H4L is still unexplored. In our latest work, a microporous Cd-MOF has been assembled with H4L, in which the unique structural character of H4L makes the MOF have hydrophilic/hydrophobic channels and excellent sorption capacity for CO2 [6]. Ongoing with our interest in structural and functional investigations of metal multicarboxylate frameworks, a new dinuclear- and tetranuclear-based terbium framework [Tb4L3(H2O)9]·7H2O (1) with L4− as linkers has been synthesized. Hydrothermal reaction of Tb(NO3)3, 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride and NaOH in a 2:1:4 molar ratio in water at 150°C afforded colorless needle-like crystals of 1, with a high yield of 82.7% [7], which was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction [8], elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The phase purity of the bulk sample was identified by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Fig. S1). In the IR spectrum of 1, there is no carbonyl CO stretching peak at around 1700cm−1 from COOH group, indicting H4L is fully-deprotonated in 1. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that 1 is a three-dimensional (3D) noninterpenetrated framework based on dinuclear and tetranuclear terbium clusters. The asymmetric unit of 1 is composed of four crystallographically independent Tb3+ ions, three fully-deprotonated L4− anions, nine aqua ligands and seven water guests (Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 1 , Tb1, Tb2 and Tb3 are eight-coordinated in distorted bicapped trigonal prism geometries (Fig. S3). Tb1 is ligated by two aqua ligands and six carboxylate O atoms of five carboxylate groups from four different L4− [Tb–O=2.262(5)–2.459(5) Å]. Both Tb2 and Tb3 are coordinated by three aqua ligands and five carboxylate O atoms of four carboxylate groups from four different L4− [Tb2–O=2.262(5)–2.533(5) Å; Tb3–O=2.286(5)–2.632(5) Å]. Whereas Tb4 adopts a monocapped square antiprism geometry (Fig. S3) surrounded by one aqua ligand and eight carboxylate O atoms of six carboxylate groups from five different L4− [Tb–O=2.327(5)–2.553(5) Å]. Tb1 and Tb2 are bridged into a dinuclear Tb2 cluster [Tb2(CO2)6(H2O)5] (Tb1⋯Tb2=4.502Å) by a η2-carboxylate O atom and two μ2–η1:η1 carboxylate groups from three different L4−. Similarly, Tb3 and Tb4 also form a Tb2 unit by a η2-carboxylate O atom and two μ2–η1:η1 carboxylate groups from three different L4− (Tb3⋯Tb4=4.547Å), however, the two units are further united through two different η2-carboxylate O atoms interlinking two Tb4 atoms (Tb4⋯Tb4A=4.209Å, symmetry code A: −x, 1−y, 2−z), giving a tetranuclear Tb4 cluster [Tb4(CO2)12(H2O)8], which consists of four Tb3+ ions, twelve carboxylate groups and eight coordinated water. To the best of our knowledge, such a Tb4 cluster has not been observed previously for lanthanide and transition metal ion complexes. For the three independent L4− in 1, two exhibit the same type-A coordination configuration with mode-I coordination, however, another L4− displays a type-C coordination configuration with mode-II coordination (Scheme 1). The mode-I features a μ6-bridging mode with two carboxylate groups in μ2–η1:η1 fashions and the other two in μ1–η1:η0 and μ1–η1:η1 fashions, respectively (Scheme 1d). The mode-II adopts a μ5-bridging mode with three carboxylate groups in μ2–η2:η1 fashions and the fourth in a μ1–η1:η0 fashion (Scheme 1e). Noteworthily, 1 is the first complex in which two types of configurations of L n− (n=1–4) are coexistent. The coexistence of type-A and type-C configurations of L4− in 1 is mainly responsible for the formation of Tb4 cluster because the sole configuration of L4− tends to generate infinite metal-carboxylate chain-like building units in frameworks [4,5a,5b,6]. In addition, the coordination mode-I and mode-II of L4− in 1 are also first observed in its complexes. Both Tb2 and Tb4 clusters are interlinked by L4− to generate a 3D framework (Fig. 2 ). Interestingly, this interlinkage generates elliptic and narrow channels along the b-axis. The elliptic channel has the sizes of 11.7×7.4Å2 (excluding van der Walls radii of the atoms) and is hydrophilic due to its effective channel surface surrounded mainly by coordinated water molecules, carboxylate groups and aryl fragments of L4−. While the narrow channel features hydrophobicity because its surface is occupied by the C(CF3)2-units of L4−, moreover, the C(CF3)2-units point to inner of the channel, which induces the small channel sizes of 10.1×3.1Å2. Despite of large elliptic channel sizes, 1 remains noninterpenetrated, the reasons should result from the formation of Tb2 and Tb4 clusters, especially the bulky Tb4 cluster can avoid the framework interpenetrated, on the other hand, the CF3 groups of L4− reduce the channel sizes, which is also responsible for noninterpenetrated framework. Upon removing all water molecules, 1 generates a microporous framework containing 21.4% solvent void accessible, which consists of 17.0% hydrophilic void and 4.4% hydrophobic void [10]. Due to hydrophobicity of narrow channels, there are no water accommodated, and the water guests are filled in the hydrophilic channels by hydrogen bond interactions with carboxylate O atoms and aqua ligands. It should be noted that, in comparison with the PXRD of the as-synthesized 1, the PXRD of desolvated 1 exhibits some obvious changes of part peak intensity (Fig. S1), suggesting a slight framework change, which verifies that the fill of water guests in hydrophilic channels is crucial for the framework stability. In 1, the Tb2 and Tb4 clusters link five and eight L4−, which can be simplified as 5- and 8-connected nodes, respectively (Fig. S4). Furthermore, the L4− with type-C configuration links one Tb2 and one Tb4 clusters, acting as a 2-connected node (Fig. S5a), however, the two L4− with type-A configuration connect one Tb2, two Tb4 clusters and three Tb2, one Tb4 clusters, behaving as 3- and 4-connected nodes (Figs. S5b and c), respectively. Thus the whole framework of 1 can be designated as a 4-nodal (3,4,5,8)-connected net with the point symbol of (43)2(4462)2(4466)2(4661884) analyzed by TOPOS program [11] (Fig. 3 ). The 2- and 3-nodal nets are widely reported for multi-nodal nets, whereas the 4-nodal net is very rarely documented. A 4-nodal (3,4,5,6)-connected net has been recently observed [12], however, to the best of our knowledge, the (3,4,5,8)-connected net as exhibited in 1 is unprecedented. TGA shows that 1 releases seven water guests and seven aqua ligands below 200°C with a total weight loss of 10.0% (calc. 10.7%), following a plateau observed from 200 to 295°C (Fig. S6). The further heating leads to two residual aqua ligands escaping within 295–360°C with a weight loss of 1.4% (calc. 1.5%). The high releasing temperature of these two aqua ligands can be attributed to their short Tb–Owater bond lengths of 2.367(6)–2.372(7) Å, on the contrary, the other seven aqua ligands are released under lower temperature arising from their longer Tb–Owater bond lengths of 2.391(6)–2.468(6) Å. Beyond 360°C, an abrupt weight loss is followed by the departure of L4− up to 620°C, leaving a residue of Tb4O7 (observ. 32.5%, calc. 31.8%) [13]. The TGA result basically agrees with the formula of 1. Taking into account the excellent luminescent property of Tb3+-containing compounds, the solid-state luminescence of 1 was investigated at room temperature. Upon excitation at 340nm, 1 exhibits typical Tb3+ ion emission peaks at 488, 544, 583 and 620nm, attributing to the expected sequence of D4 → 7FJ (J =6, 5, 4 and 3) transitions, respectively (Fig. 4 ). The spectrum is dominated by the D4 → 7 F5 transition at 542nm, leading to an intense green luminescence. The splitting for the peak at 583nm is due to the crystal-field splitting [14]. The decay lifetime curve of 1 can be well fitted with single-exponential decay (Fig. S7), giving the lifetime of 1.0ms, which suggests phosphorescence [15]. This value is comparable with those observed in various Tb-MOFs [16]. Noteworthily, the free H4L shows weak solid-state luminescence at 410nm stemming from intraligand π*→π transition, however, no apparent residual H4L-based emission is observed in the emission spectrum of 1, indicating an efficient energy transfer from L4− to the Tb3+ center, which sensitizes the Tb3+ emission to a large extent [17]. To estimate the magnetic behavior of 1, the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility was collected on 1 at temperature range 300–1.8K. As shown in Fig. 5 , at 300K, the χ mT value of 11.91cm3·K·mol−1 is slightly higher than the value of 11.82cm3 Kmol−1 for one magnetically isolated Tb3+ ion, indicating a spot of contribution of the 4f orbital (4f8, J =6, S =3, L =3, g =1.5, 7F6). Lowing the temperature causes a gradually decrease of χ mT to 7.51cm3 Kmol−1 at 1.8K. The data between 300 and 30K were fitted by Curie–Weiss law to give Curie constant C =12.1cm3 Kmol−1 and Weiss constant θ =−5.3K. The small negative θ indicates the weak antiferromagnetic interactions between Tb3+ ions, moreover, this magnetic exchange interactions should be weak because the Tb⋯Tb distances within Tb2 and Tb4 clusters are long. In summary, we have successfully synthesized a new terbium-carboxylate framework by combining Tb2 and Tb4 clusters with tetracarboxylate L4− ligand. The coexistence of different coordination configurations of L4− attributes to the generation of clusters, which lead to the formation of noninterpenetrated framework with an unprecedented (3,4,5,8)-connected net. The framework exhibits both antiferromagnetic and luminescent properties, especially its strong and pure green luminescence make it be a good candidate for green-light emitting diode. The results provide an advisable strategy on the construction of clusters-based Ln-MOFs through H4L ligand, and subsequent works will be focused on the synthesis and property investigation on other lanthanide clusters-based MOFs of H4L and its similar ligands.
