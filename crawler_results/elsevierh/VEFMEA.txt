A normal amount (2.8mmolg−1) of hydrogen uptake at 1atm and −196°C for compound 2 were observed, which can be attributed to the presence of micropores. Keywords Compound 4,4′-Azopyridine Crystal structure Gas sorption 1 Introduction In recent years, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted extensive attention due to their unusual topological architectures [1] and potential applications in gas storage, drug delivery, and separations [2–4]. Although large numbers of MOFs have been produced [5,6], the design and structural control on self-assemble MOFs still remain a long process. The success syntheses of MOFs are mainly based on the concept of network design [7] and the structures of organic ligands have played a key role in the formation of the coordinated crystal engineering [8]. Several groups have used copolymerization synthesis approach for the construction of novel MOFs in the latest studies, among which the dipyridyl-type ligands (N-donors) and polycarboxylic acids (O-donors) with more tunable factors were widely employed [9–12]. The aromatic N-heterocyclic, electron-rich 4,4′-azopyridine ligand (AZPY), because of its ability to form hydrogen bonds with anions or with solvent molecules, as well as π-back-donating to generate electron transfer and delocalization, has been used as an excellent linker for constructing architectures of MOFs, which possibly exhibit some potential gas sorption and photoelectric properties [13–24]. Furthermore, it has been chosen to build MOFs together with diverse polycarboxylates, which are either aliphatic (glutarate [13], ethylmalonic acid [14]) or aromatic (H2BDC=1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [15,16], o-phthalate [17], 1,2,4,5-benzenetetra-carboxylic acid [18], H4bpta=1,1′-biphenyl-2,2′,6,6′-tetracarboxylic acid [19], methanetetrabenzoic acid [20], 2,3,6,7-anthracenetetracarboxylic acid [21]), or N-heterocyclic acid (pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylate [22], dipicolinate [23,24]). Our tentative idea is to design porous frameworks with long spacer AZPY and rigid aromatic polycarboxylic acids, which could be considered for potentially gas sorption properties. Recently, we have prepared and structurally characterized a new compound [Co(BDC)(AZPY)]·2DMF·0.5 H2O [25]. In the structure, both AZPY and carboxylate terephthalic acid are coordinated with the metal to form a 2D layer. As a subsequent work, two kinds of carboxylic acid, being pyridine-2, 6-dicarboxylic acid (H2PDA) and aromatic 2, 6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (H2NDC), were employed as bidentate O-donor ligands, due to their robust structure and commercial availability. H2NDC, belonging to the aromatic carboxylate homologs, has participated in making up series of excellent MOFs with high surface area. An intriguing example is DUT-6 with the high total pore volume of 2.02cm3 g−1 [26]. So the rigid H2PDA as well as H2NDC and the semi-rigid AZPY were applied as mixed ligands to coordinate with metal Zn(II) and Co(II) and two coordinated polymers possessing interesting frameworks have emerged. Herein we present the syntheses, structures and characterizations for two compounds Zn(PDA)(AZPY)·4H2O (1) and [Co(NDC)(AZPY)]2·2H2O·DMF (2). The thermal stability and gas sorptions for compound 2 were also studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and physical measurements Pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (H2PDA), 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (H2NDC), N,N-dimethylamide (DMA), N,N-dimethylforamide (DMF), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and CoCl2·6H2O were purchased from J&K CHEMICA in a reagent grade and used without any purification. 4,4′-azopyridine (AZPY) was prepared according to the literature procedure [27,28]. Infrared spectra as KBr pellets were recorded using Avatar Nicolet FT-1703x FT-IR spectrophotometer from 4000 to 400cm−1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were taken on a Pyris Diamond analyzer heated from room temperature to 550°C in nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ =1.5418Å). The nitrogen and hydrogen adsorption isotherms were measured using an automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (ASAP 2020, Mircomeritics). Preceding to gas sorption experiments, the guest solvent molecules were removed by thermal activation at temperature of 180°C under vacuum over 24h. The adsorption isotherms of N2 and H2 were measured at −196°C. 2.2 Syntheses 2.2.1 Preparation of Zn(PDA)(AZPY)·4H2O (1) A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0297g, 0.1mmol), H2PDA (0.01667g, 0.1mmol, AZPY (0.0184g, 0.1mmol) combined with 6mL DMF was stirred for 20min at room temperature. Then the solution was heated in a 30mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel vessel at 160°C for 3days, and then cooled to room temperature at the rate of 10°Ch−1. The colorless block-shaped crystalline product was collected by filtration, washed with DMA, and then air-dried. 2.2.2 Preparation of [Co(NDC)(AZPY)]2·2H2O·DMF (2) A mixture of CoCl2·6H2O (0.0238g, 0.1mmol), 2,6-NDC (0.0216g, 0.1mmol), AZPY (0.0184g, 0.1mmol) combined with 10mL DMF was stirred for 20min at room temperature. Then the solution was heated in a 30mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel vessel at 140°C for 2days, and then cooled to room temperature at the rate of 3°Ch−1. The purple block-shaped crystalline product was collected by filtration, washed with DMF and then air-dried. 2.3 Crystallographic data collection and structure determination Single-crystal X-ray diffraction of compounds 1 and 2 were performed on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation (λ =0.71073Å). The structure were solved by patterson method using SHELXS-97 program and refined on F 2 within SHELXL-97 [29,30]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All hydrogen atoms were calculated at idealized positions. The H atoms bound to water molecules were located from difference Fourier maps and refined as riding mode. The crystallographic data and refinement details of compounds 1 and 2 are given in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and bond angles are summarized in Table 2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 IR analysis of compounds 1 and 2 IR spectra of compounds 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 1 . The existence of AZPY ligands was reflected by the bands of aromatic ν(C–H) vibrations and characteristic band at 1541cm−1. The bands of stretching vibrations ν(O–H) were found at 3427cm−1 for compound 1, 3446cm−1 for compound 2, indicating that the water molecules exist in the structures. The bands of antisymmetric carboxylate stretch, ν as(COO−), were found at 1620cm−1 for compound 1, 1616cm−1 for compound 2. And the bands of symmetric ν s(COO−) stretches were found at 1373cm−1 for 1, 1436cm−1 and 1375cm−1 for 2. In compound 1 the Δν(COO−)= ν as(COO−) − ν s(COO−), is 247cm−1 (more than 200cm−1), indicating that the carboxylate group belongs to the monodentate coordination mode. And the fact that the Δν(COO−) of compound 2 is 180cm−1 (less than 200cm−1) and 241cm−1, reveals there are both bidentate and monodentate coordination circumstances for the COO− groups of NDC. 3.2 Structural descriptions of compounds 1 and 2 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the asymmetric unit of compound 1 consists one Zn(II) center, one deprotonated PDA2−, one AZPY and four guest water molecules (Fig. 2 ). The zinc atom is coordinated by two oxygen atoms (O1, O3) and one nitrogen atom (N1) from the same PDA2− ligand, and two nitrogen atoms (N2, N2iii; symmetric code: (iii) −x +2, y, z.) from two different pyridine rings of AZPY to furnish a distorted trigonal bipyramid geometry. The average distances of Zn1-O and Zn1-N are 2.1595 and 2.0105Å, respectively. The AZPY, acting as a bridging ligand, connects the adjacent Zn atoms (Zn···Zn distance is 10.509Å) to form a 1D zigzag chain (Fig. 3 ). The PDA2− ligand fails to construct the skeleton and turns out to be an auxiliary ligand. It is worth noting that the AZPY ligand in compound 1 exhibits rare bending configuration, which has been observed in the 2D compound [25]. In addition, the AZPY gauche arrangement in our case is also different from the trans configuration in other MOFs [23,24]. Compared with compound 1, compound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. In the structure (Fig. 4 ), the NDC2− ligands adopts two coordinated modes: monodentate and bidentate. There are two crystallographically independent cobalt(II) centers (Co1 and Co2). The Co1 atom is five-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two AZPY and three oxygen atoms from two NDC2− ligands, forming a distorted CoN2O3 pyramid geometry, in which O1, O3v and O4v occupy the equator plane, and N1 and N8iv are in axis direction. The bond lengths of Co1-O range from 2.044(2) to 2.184(2)Å, and Co1-N from 2.034(2) to 2.075(3)Å. The Co2 atom is six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two AZPY ligands and four oxygen atoms from two NDC2− ligands to afford a distorted CoN2O4 octahedral geometry. The average bond lengths of Co–O and Co–N are 2.178 and 2.061Å, respectively. Similar to compound 1, two AZPY ligands in compound 2 are also bent and connect adjacent Co(II) centers. The two pyridine cycles in AZPY appear bending and the C27-N2-N3-C32 torsion angle between the two planes is 90.14°. Thus, the distance between Co1 and Co2 (Co1…Co2 distance is 10.771Å) bridged by AZPY are less longer than those bridged by the rigid linker 2,6-H2NDC (Co1···Co1 and Co2···Co2 distances are 12.893Å and 13.030Å, respectively) [31]. So each Co center connects to four adjacent Co atoms via two NDC2− ligands and two AZPY spacers to form a 3D framework. The solvent accessible void in the structure accounts for approximately 32% of the crystal volume calculated with PLATON software [32], and the voids were occupied by guest DMF and water molecules. To further explore the network, the topology method based on the connectivity was considered. Co1 and Co2 are viewed as four-connected nodes, and the bridged ligands (AZPY and NDC2−) are both simplified to be linear connectors; then the combination of nodes and connectors gives a 3D porous framework (Fig. 5 ). It should be noted that, AZPY ligands in both compounds showed rare bending configurations, and there are no other examples instead of some cis isomers appeared in the articles. The photosensitive azobispyridine gold(I) complexes in solution isomerize to the cis azo isomer under UV irradiation [33]; and the two compounds [(Cp*2Ti)4(μ2-N,N′;η2-N,N′-C10H8N4)2] and [(tBuCp2Ti)4(μ2-N,N′;η2-N,N′-C10H8N4)2] the azo ligands experience a conformational rearrangement from trans to cis within self-assembly process [34]. We suppose that the bending of semi-rigid AZPY in compound 1 and 2 can be ascribed to the high reaction temperature. During the solvothermal process, a free rotation along C–N σ-bond is possible by heating, resulting in the trans to gauche rearrangement when less special obstruction between the two pyridine planes occurs. 3.3 Thermal stability and gas sorption properties of compound 2 The TG curve of compound 2 was shown in Fig. 6 . The initial weight loss (3.19%) in the range of 37–225°C corresponds to the loss of two guest water molecules (calcd. 3.51%). The second weight loss was in the range 225–290°C and the mass loss of 6.80% observed which attributes to one DMF molecule (calcd. 7.13%). And after 290°C the framework collapsed. To investigate the characteristics of the porous framework, N2 and H2 adsorption experiments were carried on at −196°C. The nitrogen adsorption isotherm (Fig. 7 ) of compound 2 can be classified as type I, typical of microporous materials. Fitting the Brunaeur-Emmet-Teller (BET) equation gives the surface area of 38m2 g−1, which is close to that of {[Zn2(OH)(AZPY)(BDC)1.5]H2O} n (32m2 g−1) [15]. A small additional amount at higher pressures is adsorbed, most probably multilayers on the external surface. The lower porosity can be attributed to the very small micropore size (average pore diameter of 3.11Å) in the structure. The hydrogen loading at 1atm and −196°C was 2.8mmolg−1, which is remarkably high when compared to the nitrogen micropore capacity. The kinetic diameters for N2 and H2 molecules are 3.64 and 2.8Å, respectively. The greater molar uptake of H2 over that of N2 under the same conditions can be attributed to the closer packing of the smaller H2 molecule in the ultramicropores. The hydrogen uptake for compound 2 is higher than that of Co3(NDC)3DMF4 (2.0mmolg−1) and Mn3(NDC)3DMF4 (1.8mmolg−1) with the surface areas are 110m2 g−1 and 18m2 g−1, respectively [30]. 4 Conclusion We have synthesized two new compounds (1 and 2) constructed by aromatic dicarboxylic acids (H2PDA, H2NDC) and AZPY linkers, in which the AZPY units are unusually bent. The ultramicropores involved in the structure of compound 2 are responsible for the higher uptake of H2 over N2 under the same conditions. Our continuous attempts are underway to prepare new compounds with potential functionalities, employing other mixed ligands.
