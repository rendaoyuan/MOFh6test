Tel./fax: +86 591 83705045 Graphical abstract Two Cd supramolecular complexes are obtained from diffusion method and characterized by X-ray crystallography, fluorescence spectroscopy and IR spectra. In both compounds, the Cd2+ atoms are linked by sip3− into a one-dimensional zig zag chain. The zigzag chains are further linked together by hydrogen bonds and π–π stacking interactions to form supramolecular open frameworks. The reaction of Cd(NO3)2 with 5-sulfoisophthalic acid monosodium salt (NaH2sip) in the presence of piperazine (pip) or ethylenediamine (en) produced three-dimensional supramolecular complexes [Cd(sip)(Hpip)(H2O)2] (1) and [Cd(sip)(H2O)3]·0.5(H2en)·H2O (2). In both compounds, the Cd2+ atoms are linked by sip3− into a one-dimensional zig zag chain. The resultant negative ribbons are charge balanced by the coordinated protonated pip (Hpip) in 1 but by free, half occupied H2en in 2. The zigzag chains are further linked together by hydrogen bonds and π–π stacking interactions to form supramolecular open frameworks. Both 1 and 2 show violet–blue photoluminescence at room temperature. Keywords Supramolecular complexes Cadmium complexes Crystal structures Photoluminescence Demand for new porous materials that function as molecular sieves and catalysts has fueled a burgeoning interest in crystal engineering [1]. This solution-based approach to solid synthesis involves the use of molecular components with well-defined directional bonding preferences as reactants for constructing extended crystalline structures. The key to successful construction of supramolecular architecture is the control and manipulation of coordination bonds and non-covalent interactions by carefully selecting the coordination geometry of the metal centers and the organic ligands containing appropriate functional groups (such as polycarboxylic acid and multipyridine) [2]. Up to now, a large number of supramolecular complexes with various dimensions and topologies have been achieved through judicious choice of organic linkers and metal ions [3]. The approach to supramolecular framework employed in this work is to use the trifunctional linker NaH2sip that are selected under the following considerations: (1) It contains both the dicarboxylate groups of strong coordinating ability and sulfonate group as suitable hydrogen bond acceptor [4]; (2) π–π stacking interactions between the aromatic rings may facilitate ordered, non-interpenetrated open frameworks. In this contribution, the self-assembly of Cd(II) with sip3− in the presence of templates such as piperazine or ethylenediamine has been investigated, which leads to the supramolecular open framework materials [Cd(sip)(Hpip)(H2O)2] (1) and [Cd(sip)(H2O)3]·0.5(H2en)·H2O (2) [5]. Both compounds have been characterized by X-ray crystallography [6], fluorescence spectroscopy and IR spectra. As shown in Fig. 1 , the Cd(II) atoms are bridged by sip3− to form an infinite zigzag chain. Each cadmium center has distorted octahedral coordination geometry. The equatorial positions are taken up by two chelating carboxylate oxygen donors from one sip3−, one monodentate carboxylate oxygen from another and one water molecule. The axial positions are occupied by protonated pip nitrogen atom and one water molecule. The angles formed by the equatorial atoms range from 55.62(4)° (the chelating angle O1–Cd–O2) to 137.39(5)° (O1–Cd–O3A, A: −x +3/2, −y, z +1/2), indicative of serious distortion of the [CdO5N] octahedron. The bond length between Cd and the monodentate oxygen atom (2.239(1)Å) is slightly shorter than the other Cd–O (2.324(1)–2.380(1)Å, av. 2.347Å) and Cd–N bonds (2.381(2)Å). Note that one-dimensional coordination polymer [Cu(H2O)2(Hsip)]·2H2O·0.5(pip) was reported very recently, which contained free (non-coordinated) organic amine molecules [7]. Fig. 2 shows the supramolecular open framework structure built of the infinite zigzag chains through the interchain hydrogen bonds and π–π interactions. The following four types of hydrogen bonds link the chains into the three-dimensional architecture: (i) hydrogen bonds between the coordinated water molecules and the carboxylate oxygen atoms (O8⋯O2B=2.691Å, B: x −1/2, y, −z −1/2); (ii) hydrogen bonds between coordinated water molecules and sulfonate oxygen atoms (O8⋯O5C=2.899Å, C: x −1/2, −y −1/2, −z −1, O9⋯O7B=2.800Å, O9⋯O6D=2.861Å, D: x, −y −1/2, z +1/2); (iii) hydrogen bonds between the coordinated nitrogen atom of piperazine and the carboxylate oxygen atoms (N1⋯O4E=2.973Å, E: −x +2, −y, −z −1); (iv) hygrogen bonds between the non-coordinated nitrogen atom of piperazine and sulfonate oxygen atoms (N2⋯O5F=2.954Å, N2⋯O6F=2.948Å, F: −x +2, y +1/2, −z −1/2). The existence of the three hydrogen bonds around the N2 atom clearly indicates it is protonated. The supramolecular framework structure is further stabilized by π interactions between the parallel aromatic rings in an off-set fashion with face to face distance of ca. 3.326Å. Complexe 2 contain two crystallographically independent molecules, which are identical to each other in their configurations. The coordination mode of the sip3− unit in 1 is the same as that in 2, but different from those in the related complexes [8]. It has a similar but negative infinite zigzag chain as illustrated in Fig. 3 . The chain-like structure is similar to that of 1 but that the protonated pip is displaced by one water molecule in 2. As in the case of 1, the Cd(II) center has a seriously distorted [CdO6] octahedral coordination geometry. The distance between Cd and monodentate carboxylate oxygen atom (Cd–O=2.184(1)Å) is slightly shorter than the other Cd–O bond lengths (2.246(1)–2.472(1)Å, av. 2.349Å). The negative chain is charge balanced by the di-protonated ethylenediamine molecule lying on crystallographic inversion center. The extensive hydrogen bonds and π–π interactions between the infinite chains are responsible for the supramolecular open framework structure of 2 with the channels along the crystallographic c axis as depicted in Fig. 4 . Two types of hydrogen bonds are observed between the chains: (i) hydrogen bonds between the coordinated water molecules and carboxylate oxygen atoms (O8⋯O2A=2.737Å, A: x, −y +1/2, z −1/2; O9⋯O4B=2.604Å, B: −x +1, −y +1, −z +1); (ii) hydrogen bonds between the coordinated water molecules and sulfonate oxygen atoms (O10⋯O5C=2.852Å, C: x, −y +1/2, z −1/2). The channels encapsulate guest ethylenediamine and water molecules, which are hydrogen bonded to the host frameworks (O1W⋯O6D=2.886Å, D: x −1, −y +1/2, z −1/2; O1W⋯O8E=2.888Å, E: x −1, y, z; N2⋯O6F=2.864Å, F: x −1, y, z). Moreover, the π–π interactions between adjacent sip3− are observed with the two neighboring aromatic rings having the dihedral angle of ca. 16.1° and the centroid–centroid distance of ca. 3.770Å. The photoluminescence properties of both compounds and the free ligand were examined in solid state at room temperature. The free Na2Hsip displays fluorescence emission at 320nm, which is attributable to the π*→n transition [9]. However, remarkable bathochromic shift was observed in its cadmium compounds 1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 5 . 1 exhibits fluorescence emission with the maximum at 425nm upon excitation at 316nm. A similar emission with the maximum at 412nm upon excitation at 318nm was observed for 2. The fluorescence spectrum of 1 is similar to that of 2 in the peak profiles, indicative of slight influence of the diamines on their electronic structures. Similar bathochromic shift was also observed in several reported Cd(II) complexes with aromatic carboxylate ligands [10]. Such great bathochromic shift indicates that the aromatic rings of the ligand are effectively interacted with the metal and/or with each other through π-stacking interactions as described above. In other words, there exist delocalization of the π electrons of the aromatic rings over the Cd2+ and/or the neighboring ligand. It has been reported that the Zn(II) or Cd(II) coordination complexes with aromatic carboxylate ligands may possess LMCT photoluminescent property [11]. With the above concerns in mind, the fluorescence emission of 1 and 2 may be assigned to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). The IR spectrum of 1 shows the stretching vibrations of the O–H, N–H and C–H bands at 3466, 3243 and 3004cm−1, respectively. The strong bands between 1350 and 1630cm−1 are characteristic of the carboxylate group. The absorptions in the region 1000–1230cm−1 are typical for the sulfonate group [12]. The IR spectrum of 2 shows the stretching vibrations of the O–H, N–H and C–H bands at 3434, 3168 and 3077cm−1, respectively, and the bands in the range 1350–1630cm−1 are characteristic of the carboxylate group. The absorptions of the sulfonate group of 2 were observed in the region 1000–1230cm−1. In conclusion, the self-assembly of cadmium (II) and Na2Hsip in the presence of organic amines as structure-directing agents forms three-dimensional supramolecular architectures with the organic amine either coordinated (1) or free (2), depending on the nature of the amines employed. It seems that dialkylamine (R2NH) such as piperazine has stronger coordination ability than monoalkylamine (RNH2) such as ethylenediamine. The building unit sip3− in both compounds acts as an unprecedented tridentate ligand. Both compounds exhibit violet–blue photoluminescence in the solid state.
