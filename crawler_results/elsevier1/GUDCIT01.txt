Graphical abstract Three new coordination polymers have been synthesized using a semi-flexible dicarboxylic acid ligand under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions. They represent homometallic clusters with SBUs varying from dimeric to tetrameric, and show diverse topological architectures. Solid-state luminescence studies of complexes 1–3 have also been carried out at room temperature. Three new coordination polymers (CPs) of Zn(II)/Cd(II) have been synthesized using a dicarboxylate ligand, H2L =5-(benzylamino)isophthalic acid, under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions. This ligand readily reacts with Zn(II) and Cd(II) metal salts to afford three CPs, {[Zn8(L)6(μ 3-OH)4(H2O)6]·(DMF)·(H2O)2.5} n (1), [Zn(L)] n (2) and [Cd(L)(DMF)] n (3). All the complexes have been characterized by single crystal X-ray crystallography (XRD), IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetry (TGA) and X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD). Single crystal X-ray studies reveal that 1–3 contain homometallic clusters, with SBUs varying from dimeric to tetrameric, depending upon the metal salts as well as the reaction conditions. Topologically, 1 represents an sql net, whereas 2 and 3 exhibits rare ptr and fes topological nets respectively. Luminescence studies were also carried for complexes 1–3, which exhibit emissions as a pair of bands upon excitation at 405nm. Keywords Coordination polymer Transition metal ions X-ray structural studies Emission studies Topology 1 Introduction During the last couple of decades, a new class of organic–inorganic hybrid coordination polymers has attracted considerable attention due to their intriguing topologies and their potential application in luminescence [1–3], chemical sensors [4–6], magnetism [7–10], gas adsorption [11–13], catalysis [14–16] and so on. Coordination networks are certainly very potential multifunctional luminescent materials because both the inorganic and organic moieties, separately or in conjugation, can generate emissions [17–20]. Metal and ligand centered charge transfers can add another dimension to the luminescent functionality within the metal organic frameworks [21–23]. The deliberate selection of organic moieties plays a pivotal role in the fabrication of CP materials with luminescence. However, more and more efforts have been focused on those organic linkers with (a) highly conjugated delocalized π electrons such as pyrene- and naphthalene chromophores (b) polycarboxylate groups such as benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate (BDC) and biphenyl-dicarboxylate (BPDC) as they impart versatile bridging modes for the formation of moderately robust CPs [24,25]. Researchers are now focusing more attention on the design of hetero-metal organic frameworks as these have revealed some unprecedented luminescent properties [26]. CPs built with closed shell transition metal ions like Zn(II)/Cd(II) are good candidates in emission studies as they do not quench fluorescence intensity like those with paramagnetic metal centers [27]. Inspired from this, we have successfully synthesized a semi-flexible aromatic dicarboxylate ligand, H2L (Scheme 1 ), which presumably generates luminescence due to the phenyl rings. Based on this flexible dicarboxylate ligand, three coordination polymers, {[Zn8(L)6(μ 3-OH)4(H2O)6]·(DMF)·(H2O)2.5} n (1), [Zn(L)] n (2) and [Cd(L)(DMF)] n (3), have been synthesized under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions, which contain binuclear to tetranuclear metal clusters as the Secondary Building Units (SBUs). 2 Experimental 2.1 General methods and materials Reagent grade 5-aminoisophthalic acid, benzaldehyde, sodium borohydride and transition metal salts, such as Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Cd(NO3)2·6H2O, were acquired from Aldrich and were used as received. All solvents, ethanol, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), triethylamine, acetic acid (AcOH) and NaOH, were procured from S. D. Fine Chemicals, India. All the solvents were purified prior to use following standard methods. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin–Elmer Model 1320 spectrometer (KBr disk, 400–4000cm−1). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL-ECX 500 FT (500MHz and 125MHz respectively) instrument in DMSO-d6 with Me4Si as the internal standard. ESI-mass spectra were recorded on a WATERS Q-TOF Premier mass spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were recorded on a Mettler Toledo Star System (at a heating rate of 5°C/min). Microanalyses for the compounds were carried out using a CE-440 elemental analyzer (Exeter Analytical Inc.). Solid-state photo-excitation and emission spectra were recorded using a double UV–vis spectrophotometer (shimadzu, UV-2450) and a JobinYvon Horiba Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter at room temperature. Powder X-ray diffraction (Cu Kα radiation, scan rate 3°/min, 293K) was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance Series 2 powder X-ray diffractometer. 2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of 5-(benzylamino)isophthalic acid (H2L) A mixture of 5-aminoisophthalic acid (1.08g, 6mmol) and benzaldehyde (0.795mL, 7.8mmol), in ethanol (30mL) was stirred at room temperature. Triethylamine (4.16mL, 30mmol) was added to the mixture and stirred for 1h. After an hour, the mixture became viscous, then an excess of NaBH4 was slowly added at 0°C. After 4h at 0°C, the solvent was concentrated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in water (50mL) and acidified with glacial acetic acid (AcOH) to pH 3–5. After filtration, the product was obtained as a pale-yellowish crystalline solid. Yield: 74%. Anal. Calc. for C15H13NO4: C, 66.41; H, 4.83; N, 5.16. Found: C, 66.48; H, 4.75; N, 5.11%.

The linear absorption coefficients, scattering factors for the atoms and anomalous dispersion corrections were referred from the International Tables for X-ray Crystallography [27]. The data integration and reduction were worked out with saint [28] software. Empirical absorption corrections were applied to the collected reflections with sadabs [29] and the space groups were determined using xprep [30]. The structures were solved by direct methods using shelxtl-97 [31] and refined on F 2 by full-matrix least-squares using the shelxtl-97 program package [32]. Except in a few cases, all non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The atoms C31, C45, C46, C53, C63 and O17 in 1 were refined isotropically. The H-atoms attached to carbon atoms were positioned geometrically and treated as riding atoms using shelxl default parameters. For complex 1, squeeze refinement has been performed using platon [33] which shows one DMF molecule and 2.5 water molecules per formula weight. The contribution of all the solvent atoms has been incorporated in both the empirical formula and formula weight of the complex. Several dfix and dang commands were used to fix the bond distances and bond angles in the complexes. The crystal and refinement data are collected in Table 1 while selected bond distances and angles are given in Table S1. 3 Results and discussion Once isolated, all the CPs were found to be stable in air and insoluble in common organic solvents, such as acetone, chloroform, ethanol, acetonitrile, DMF and water. All the CPs were formulated by single-crystal X-ray studies and further corroborated by TGA and elemental analysis. The phase purity of 1–3 was confirmed by comparing the experimental and simulated powder X-ray diffraction patterns. The IR spectrum of complex 1 showed a broad peak in the range ∼3380–3600cm−1, indicating the presence of water molecules [34] and the observed absorption bands in the IR spectra of 1–3 between ∼1420 and 1610cm−1 are diagnostic of coordinated carboxylate groups [35]. In 1 and 3, a sharp absorption at ∼1660cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching frequency of DMF carbonyl groups. 3.1 Crystal structure of {[Zn8(L)6(μ3-OH)4(H2O)6]·(DMF)·(H2O)2.5} n (1) Complex 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P 1 ¯ with the asymmetric unit consisting of eight crystallographically independent Zn(II) ions, six L2 − ligands, four μ 3-OH groups, six coordinated water molecules and one DMF and two and half water molecules in the lattice. Here, the carboxylate groups of the L2 − ligand show the μ 3:η1:η1:η1:η0, μ 3:η1:η1:η1:η1 and μ 4:η1:η1:η1:η1 types of binding modes (Fig. 1 a–c). The tetranuclear cluster of zinc ions form a butterfly-like core [Zn4(μ 3-OH)2]6+ through bonding from two bridging μ 3-OH and carboxylate groups of L2 − ligands (Fig. 2 ). These tetrameric SBUs are extended via bridging carboxylate groups of two L2 − ligands and an overall a 2D supramolecular framework is obtained (Fig. 3 ). In each tetrameric core, the Zn(II) ions are found to be in different coordination environments. Zn1 and Zn4 show a distorted tetrahedral geometry, Zn2 shows a square pyramidal (τ =0.39) [36] geometry, while Zn3 exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry. Zn1 is coordinated to two bridging carboxylates of L2 − (Zn–O=1.944(6)–1.962(6)Å), one μ 3-OH (Zn–O=1.990(6)Å) and a coordinated water (Zn–O=1.979(8)Å). Zn4 is coordinated to three bridging carboxylates of L2 − (Zn–O=1.970(5)–1.947(6)Å) and one μ 3-OH (Zn–O=1.919(6)Å). Zn2 is coordinated to two bridging carboxylates (Zn–O=2.011(6)–2.112(6)Å), one carboxylate O atom of L2 − (Zn–O=2.027(7)Å) and two μ 3-OH (Zn–O=2.046(6)–2.151(6)Å) groups, whereas Zn3 is coordinated to two bridging carboxylates (Zn–O=2.098(7)–2.122(6)Å), two O atoms from water molecules (Zn–O=1.987(8)–2.009(8)Å) and to two μ 3-OH groups. All the Zn–O bond distances are within the ranges reported for other described Zn(II) complexes [37]. The framework can be described as a uninodal 4-connected sql/Shubnikov tetragonal plane net [38] with the point symbol {44.62} (Fig. 4 a). 3.2 Crystal structure of [Zn(L)] n (2) Complex 2 crystallized in the trigonal crystal system and successfully converged and was solved in the R-3 space group. The asymmetric unit consists of one Zn(II) ion and one L2 − ligand. Here, the carboxylate groups of the L2 − ligand exhibit the μ 3:η1:η1:η1:η0 type of binding mode (Fig. 1a). Each Zn(II) ion shows a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment, with ligation from four different carboxylate O atoms of the L2 − ligand (Zn–O=1.9148(17)–1.9637(17)Å). Interestingly, repeating binuclear clusters (Zn⋯Zn=3.48Å) propagate along the crystallographic c axis to give rise a linear 1D chain (Fig. 5 ). Moreover, two L2 − ligands assist in linking two repeating binuclear subunits to generate a 48-membered macrocycle (Fig. 6 a). The empty space within the macrocycle is stabilized by C–H⋯π (2.898(3)Å) and π⋯π interactions (3.894(3)Å) between the phenyl rings of the ligand. The Zn⋯Zn intermetallic distances in this macrocycle are 9.31 and 18.45. The crystal structure of 2 is depicted in Fig. 6b, which reveals it to be a 3D coordination network. Topological simplification by Topos Software suggests it has a binodal (4, 4)-connected ptr topology with point symbol {43.62.8} (Fig. 4b). 3.3 Crystal structure of [Cd(L)(DMF)] n (3) Complex 3 crystallized in the monoclinic crystal system and successfully converged and was solved in the P21/n space group. The asymmetric unit consists of one Cd(II) metal ion, one L2 − ligand and two coordinated DMF molecules. Both carboxylate groups of the L2 − ligand bind the metal ions as μ3–η1:η1:η1:η2 modes, both chelating and bridging (Fig. 1d). Cd1 is seven coordinated with a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal CdO7 coordination environment from five O atoms from different carboxylate groups of L2 − in the chelating and bridging fashions (Cd–O=2.262(3)–2.732(5)Å) and two O atoms from coordinated N,N–dimethylformamide (DMF) molecules (Cd–O=2.296(3)–2.337(3)Å) (Fig. 7 ). All the Cd–O bond distances are within the range reported for distorted pentagonal bipyramidal Cd(II) complexes [39]. Interestingly, complex 3 consists of a linear bimetallic cluster in which one of the O atoms of an O–C–O group acts as a bridge. In the bimetallic cluster the Cd⋯Cd distance is 3.92Å and the Cd⋯O⋯Cd angle is 110.7°. The bimetallic units are further extended into a 2D supramolecular framework by bridging of both the carboxylate groups of the L2 − ligand (Fig. 8 ). Topological analysis shows that it is a 2D coordination polymer having a non-interpenetrated structure, consisting of a uninodal 3-connected fes topology. The point symbol of this topological network is {4.82} (Fig. 4c). 3.4 PXRD analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of 1–3 are in good agreement with the simulated patterns as obtained from the single crystal X-ray data (Figs. S8–S10). Thermal analyses of complexes 1–3 were carried out under an N2 atmosphere at the rate of 5°C per minute. Complex 1 exhibits ∼9.29% weight loss, corresponding to the removal of one DMF and eight and half aqua molecules, both coordinated and lattice molecules. The framework shows good stability up to 360°C, then beyond this temperature it collapses. Complex 2 shows no weight loss up to 500°C and starts to decompose after this temperature. Complex 3 shows a weight loss of ∼27.69% due to the loss of two coordinated DMF molecules in the temperature range 110–170°C. This complex shows stability up to 320°C, then beyond this temperature the framework collapses (Figs. S11–S13). 3.5 Photoluminescence studies The luminescence properties of complexes of d 10 metal ions with carboxylate donor ligands have been reported in the literature [27]. Inorganic–organic hybrid materials with closed shell (d 10) electronic configurations have been reported to display excellent thermal stability as well as the ability to enhance the emission intensity of the free organic ligands after complexation with the metal ions. The luminescence properties of 1–3 and the metal-free H2L were investigated in the solid-state at room temperature and are shown collectively in Fig. 9 . Upon excitation at 405nm, 1–3 exhibit an emission as a pair of bands at 437, 439 and 440nm and correspondingly at 420, 416 and 420nm, respectively. The emission bands at higher energy could be due to an intra-ligand (π–π ∗ transitions) interaction as the profile of the emission band is quite similar to that of H2L, while the low energy band probably originates from a ligand-to-metal charge transfer [40]. Changes observed in the emission intensities in 1–3 could be attributed to the presence of coordinated or lattice solvent molecules. Water is the potential quencher of luminescence intensity, as in case of complex 1, due to its vibrational behavior [41]. The ligand shows an appreciably low luminescence intensity, whereas the enhancement in the emission intensities in 1–3 results from the increased rigidity of the ligand upon metal coordination that reduces loss of energy by radiationless decay [42]. 4 Conclusion We have demonstrated the syntheses of three new CPs of Zn(II)/Cd(II) using a semi-flexible dicarboxylic acid ligand, 5-(benzylamino)isophthalic acid, under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions. They represent homometallic clusters varying from dimeric to tetrameric SBUs with diverse topological architectures. Solid-state luminescence of complexes 1–3 have also been achieved at room temperature. We are in the process of synthesizing similar type ligands for the construction of coordination polymers for various applications. Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge Prof. P. K.
