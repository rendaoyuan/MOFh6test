Three novel coordination polymers, {[cis-K2Zn2Mn(μ7-pdtc)2(H2O)10]·H2O}n (1), {[cis-K2Zn3(μ7-pdtc)2(H2O)10]·0.5H2O}n (2) and [trans-K2Zn3(μ5-pdtc)2(H2O)12]n (3), were synthesized by the self-assembly of potassium pyridine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylate (K4pdtc) with metal salts. 1 is the first Zn/Mn/K heterotrimetallic complex with H4pdtc. 1 and 2 have 3D network structures, while 3 is a 2D coordination polymer, which are due to the different bonding modes of H4pdtc with K(I) and metal(II) ions. The fluorescence spectroscopy measurements reveal that strong photo-luminescent characteristics exhibit in 1–3 in aqueous solution at room temperature. Graphical abstract Self-assembly of pyridine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylic acid(H4pdtc) with metal salts gave three novel coordination polymers, {[cis-K2Zn2Mn(μ7-pdtc)2(H2O)10]·H2O}n (1), {[cis-K2Zn3(μ7-pdtc)2(H2O)10]·0.5H2O}n (2) and [trans-K2Zn3(μ5-pdtc)2(H2O)12]n (3). 1 is the first Zn/Mn/K heterotrimetallic complex. The structure of 2 is similar to that of 1. 3 is a 2D coordination polymer. Strong photo-luminescent characteristics exhibit in 1–3. Highlights ► Three polymers with H4pdtc have been synthesized and characterized. 1 is the first Zn/Mn/K heterotrimetallic complex. ► The H4pdtc molecules show 7-coordinated modes in 1–2 and a 5-coordinated mode in 3. ► Strong photo-luminescent characteristics exhibit in 1–3 in aqueous solution at room temperature. Keywords Metal–organic framework Pyridine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylic acid Heterometallic complex Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted great interest in recent years because of their potential applications in molecular sieves, magnetism, catalysis, gas storage, chemical sensors and optical materials [1–5]. The construction of MOFs based on transition metals and multifunctional bridging ligands has been proven to be a promising field. Pyridine-carboxylic acids, such as di- or tri‐pyridinecarboxylic acids are good choices for constructing MOFs due to the existence of both N and O atoms in the ligands, which can link 3d, 4f, and 3d–4f metal ions [6–8]. The structures and the optical or magnetic properties of metal–organic complexes with pyridine-carboxylic acids are of great interest in many fields, such as solid chemistry and material chemistry [9–12]. Pyridine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylic acid (H4pdtc) is an important member of the aromatic polycarboxylates and potentially exhibits strong and typical properties acting as a multidentate ligand. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few complexes with Pyridine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylic acid have been reported [13–15] and its coordination chemistry remains largely unexplored. In this contribution, complexes 1–3, {[cis-K2Zn2Mn(μ7-pdtc)2(H2O)10]·H2On} (1), {[cis-K2Zn3(μ7-pdtc)2(H2O)10]·0.5H2O}n (2), and [trans-K2Zn3(μ5-pdtc)2(H2O)12]n (3), were synthesized [16] and characterized by X-ray single crystal diffraction [17], infrared spectroscopy, elemental and thermogravimetric analysis. The luminescent properties of complexes 1–3 have also been investigated. All the complexes once isolated, are air-stable and can retain their structural integrity at room temperature for a considerable length of time. The X-ray structure analyses [17,18] reveal that all polymers contain alkali metal centers and transitional metal centers. The structures of 1 and 2 are very similar, except that Mn1 in 1 is replaced by Zn2 in 2 and O16 from uncoordinated water has the site occupancy of 1.000 in 1 but 0.500 in 2; therefore only structural descriptions of 1 are presented. The molecular structure and coordination environments of metal centers in 1 are shown in Fig. 1a. The X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis reveals that the fundamental unit of 1 consists of two zinc ions, one manganese ion, two potassium ions, two ligands (pdtc4−) and eleven water molecules. Zn1 is six-coordinate with a distorted octahedral geometry. The equatorial sites of Zn1 are occupied by one O atom (O9) from one aqua ligand, and two O atoms and one N atom from one chelating pdtc4− ligand. The axial sites are occupied by two O atoms (O3A, O5B) from another two adjacent pdtc4− ligands. The coordination geometry around Mn1 is a slightly distorted octahedron, the equatorial plane of which comprises three O atoms from water molecules (O10, O11, O12B) and one O atom (O4B) from pdtc4−. One O atom (O4) from another pdtc4− and one O atom (O12) from a water molecule occupy the axial sites. For complexes 1 and 2, the pyridine rings of pdtc4− ligands are completely parallel. The adjacent Zn1 ions are connected by pdtc4− to generate an infinite 1D stair-like chain (Fig. 2a). The cis-Mn(II) [15] in 1 or cis-Zn(II) in 2 extends the 1D chain into the 2D layer (Fig. 3a). The 2D layer is further extended into a 3D framework due to the K(I). Complex 1, a unique Zn/Mn/K heterotrimetallic coordination polymer, shows a 3D open network structure (Fig. 4 ) containing 2D Zn–Mn–pdtc layers and 1D KO chains inserted in the system. The crystal structure of 3 consists of a centrosymmetric polynuclear [K2Zn3(pdtc)2(H2O)12] structural unit (Fig. 1b). There are two independent Zn(II) ions (Zn1 and Zn2) in different coordination environments. Zn1 is 5-coordinated and exhibits a distorted square pyramidal geometry. The equatorial sites are occupied by ONO (O1, N1 and O8) from one pdtc4− and one O atom (O3B) from another adjacent pdtc4−, while the axial sites are occupied by one O atom (O9) of a water molecule. On the other hand, Zn2 has an octahedral geometry and is bonded to four bridged aqua ligands (O10, O10A, O11, O11A) and two carboxyl O atoms (O7, O7A) in a trans arrangement. For complex 3, the pyridine rings of H4pdtc ligands are also completely parallel. The adjacent Zn1 ions are connected by pdtc4− into a [Zn2(pdtc)2(H2O)2] unit, which cannot continue to grow into the 1D stair-like chain. This may be due to the different coordination geometries of Zn1 compared with those in 1 and 2. However, every [Zn2(pdtc)2(H2O)2] unit is connected by trans-Zn(II) into an infinite 1D wave-like chain as shown in Fig. 2b. And each chain is further linked via K(I) to form a 2D network structure (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, in each crystal of 1–3, two H4pdtc rings are arranged in a parallel fashion to result in the π–π stacking interactions with the plane-to-plane distances of 3.319, 3.193 and 3.243Å. Because of the larger atomic radius and lesser d electrons than transition metal atoms, K+ can bond with the oxygen atoms easily and show a higher coordination number. As shown in Fig. 5a, there are two kinds of coordination environments for K(I) ions in 1. K1 is 7-coordinated and K2 is 9-coordinated. The KO bond lengths are arranged from 2.680 to 3.184Å and the average bond length is 2.886Å, which is slightly longer than the reported 2.880Å in complex {KCaEr(ptc)2(H2O)}n [19] but shorter than that mentioned in the reported complex {[cis-K2Cu2Mn(pdtc)2(H2O)10]·H2O}n [15]. K1 connects one K2 by one bridging O atom (O13w) on one side and connects another K2 by three bridging O atoms (O4, O4A, O15wD) on the other side to form an alternate 1D KO chain. The distances between K1 and K2 in 1 are 4.221 and 5.108Å, while the two corresponding values of 2 are 4.199 and 5.188Å, respectively. In complex 3, there is only one type of K(I) ion with KO bond lengths of 2.749–3.087Å. The K1 is 8-coordinated by four bridged aqua ligands (O10wG, O11wG, O14w, O14wE), two non-bridged aqua ligands (O12w, O13w) and two O atoms (O8G, O3H) from two H4pdtc molecules. The two K1 atoms are connected to each other by two bridging O atoms (O14w, O14wE) to form a dimer. The dimers are further connected by Zn2 to form an infinite chain (Fig. 5b). 3 and 2 have similar molecular formulas. But their structures are quite different. This may be due to the different synthesis ways [16] of 2 and 3. 2 is formed under hydrothermal condition, while 3 is formed at room temperature. The difference between the MO bond (M=Zn/Mn) and the KO bond results from the disparity in the bonding characteristic of M2+ and K+. The M2+ ions can accept the electron pair from O atoms forming an MO coordination bond, while K+ ions form the KO bond through the electrostatic attraction of K+ for O2− or polar H2O molecule. As the electrostatic attraction has no saturation and directionality, K+ can interact with the electronegative groups around it as much as possible and exhibit high coordination numbers. The KO bonds formed between the neighboring structural units play an important role in constructing the coordination polymers 1–3. Polycrystalline samples of 1 and 3 were subjected to TGA in the temperature range of 20–700°C under the atmosphere of air (Fig. 6 ). The molecular structures of 1 and 2 are very similar, therefore only the TGA of 1 is operated. For 1 and 3, the weight loss of 17.37% and 16.84% in the range of 20–152°C, corresponds to the loss of all coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules (calcd 20.53% for 1, 21.76% for 3). Between 152 and 383°C in 1, 152 and 350°C in 3, there is almost no mass change. Complex 1 continues to decompose from 383°C to 700°C. The degradation of 3 occurs in the second step in the temperature range of 350–517°C. Above 517°C, there is almost no mass transformation. The remaining mass of 34.23% is presumably ZnO and K2O, which is in agreement with the calculated value of 34.09%. The photoluminescent behaviors of complexes 1–3 are studied in aqueous solution at room temperature. The emission and excitation spectra of 1–3 are depicted in Fig. 7 , where the emission bands for complexes 1–3 are similar in terms of position and band shape. The strong fluorescence signals with the maximum emission peak positions at approximately 311, 361 and 560nm for the complexes can be observed upon λex =280nm. The emission band at about 560nm is stronger than the others, which is due to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). The emission bonds at about 311 and 361nm probably corresponded to the π*→π or π*→n transition of the organic ligand, which suggests an incomplete energy transfer from L to metal centers. The intensity of 2 is higher than that of 1 and the intensity of 1 is higher than that of 3. The different intensities of the emission bands of 1–3 are probably due to the differences of the metal ions, the coordination environment around them and even the different structure topologies, because the photoluminescent behavior is closely associated with the metal ions and the ligands coordinated around them. The high fluorescence efficiency of 1–3 is attributed to the coordination of H4pdtc ligands to Zn(II) ions which effectively increases the rigidity of the ligands and reduces the loss of energy via radiationless thermal vibrations. As depicted in Fig. 7, Complexes 1–3 may be the potential fluorescence materials for green-light emitting diode devices because of the green fluorescence emission. A lot of luminescent Zn(II) coordination complexes containing aromatic ligands have been reported as they have potential applications in optical amplifiers, optical waveguides and OLEDs [14,20–24]. In summary, three alkali–transitional-metal coordination polymers have been synthesized. 1 is the first Zn/Mn/K heterotrimetallic complex with a 3D open framework containing one carboxyl coordinated with three different kinds of metal ions (Zn, Mn, K). The H4pdtc molecules show 7-coordinated modes in 1–2 and a 5-coordinated mode in 3, which implies that H4pdtc has a great potential possibility to design novel MOFs and heteromultimetallic complexes in coordination chemistry. The H4pdtc and water molecules coordinate with Mn1 or Zn2 ions in a cis mode in 1–2, while they coordinated with Zn2 ions in a trans mode in 3. The K+ ions play an important role in constructing high dimensional MOFs. Complexes 1–3 exhibit strong green fluorescence emission bands, which renders them potentially useful as fluorescence materials.

<p>It is advisable to attempt to resolve as many as possible of the alerts in all categories. Often the<br>minor alerts point to easily fixed oversights, errors and omissions in your CIF or refinement<br>strategy, so attention to these fine details can be worthwhile. In order to resolve some of the more<br>serious problems it may be necessary to carry out additional measurements or structure<br>refinements. However, the purpose of your study may justify the reported deviations and the more<br>serious of these should normally be commented upon in the discussion or experimental section of a<br>paper or in the "special_details" fields of the CIF. checkCIF was carefully designed to identify<br>outliers and unusual parameters, but every test has its limitations and alerts that are not important<br>in a particular case may appear. Conversely, the absence of alerts does not guarantee there are no<br>aspects of the results needing attention. It is up to the individual to critically assess their own<br>results and, if necessary, seek expert advice.<br>Publication of your CIF in IUCr journals<br>A basic structural check has been run on your CIF. These basic checks will be run on all CIFs<br>submitted for publication in IUCr journals (Acta Crystallographica, Journal of Applied<br>Crystallography, Journal of Synchrotron Radiation); however, if you intend to submit to Acta<br>Crystallographica Section C or E, you should make sure that full publication checks are run on the<br>final version of your CIF prior to submission.<br>Publication of your CIF in other journals<br>Please refer to the Notes for Authors of the relevant journal for any special instructions relating to<br>CIF submission.<br>PLATON version of 15/02/2012; check.def file version of 10/02/2012</p>
