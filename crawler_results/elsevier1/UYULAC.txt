Graphical abstract Four new Cd(II) coordination polymers based on flexible 2,2-dithiobisbenzoic acid and different auxiliary N-donor ligands exhibit different 1D to 2D topological networks and diverse luminescent properties. Highlights ► Four Cd(II) coordination polymers were constructed with flexible disulfide ligand. ► The coordination modes and conformations of ligands lead to structural differences. ► The auxiliary N-donor ligands show great effect on structural diversification. ► All materials exhibit strong fluorescent behavior. Four novel coordination polymers, [Cd(Hdtbb)(dtbb)0.5(DMF)] n (1), {[Cd(dtbb)(2,2′-bpy)(H2O)]·2DMA} n (2), {[Cd2(dtbb)2(1,4-bix)2]·3DMF} n (3) and [Cd(dtbb)(1,4-btx)] n (4) [H2dtbb=2,2-dithiobisbenzoic acid, 2,2′-bpy=2,2′-bipyridine, 1,4-bix=1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene, 1,4-btx=1,4-bis(triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene] have been synthesized and structurally characterized. Complexes 1 and 2 possess one-dimensional (1D) infinite structures. The structures of complexes 3 and 4 exhibit two dimensional (2D) frameworks, which mainly due to the differences in the bridging modes of dtbb2− ligand and the effect of the N-donor auxiliary ligands. The infrared spectra, thermogravimetric and luminescent properties were also investigated for these compounds. Keywords Coordination polymers 2,2-Dithiobisbenzoic acid Auxiliary ligands Luminescence 1 Introduction In the past decades, the realm of crystal engineering has achieved significant success in developing a variety of coordination networks [1–21]. The interest arise not only from their versatile fascinating architectures but also from their promising applications as functional materials [22–24,3,25–30]. Many works have been devoted to the selection or design of suitable ligands containing certain features. Among the reported studies, organic ligands with carboxylate groups are of especial interest because they can adopt a variety of coordination modes and result in diverse multidimensional frameworks [31–38]. To date, a number of rigid ligands, such as benzenedicarboxylate isomers [39–42], 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate [43–45], 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate [46,47] and pyridinedicarboxylate isomers [48–50], have been successfully employed and well documented in the preparation of various carboxylato-containing metal–organic coordination complexes with useful properties. However, there is an unfavorable investigation on the MOFs containing flexible bridging carboxylate ligands [51–55]. Compared with the rigid ligands, the skew and versatile coordination orientation of the flexible bridging ligands is favorable for constructing novel structures [56–59]. Disulfide bridging phenyl carboxylate ligands possess flexibility owing to the presence of –S–S– spacers between the phenyl rings and can adopt various conformations according to geometric requirements when they react with different metal salts, the flexible and multifunctional coordination sites provide a high likelihood for build novel coordination frameworks with high dimensions. Whereas, there have been few reports of studies on flexible disulfide derivatives of carboxylates [60–64]. Considering the points mentioned above, to further explore the coordination characteristics of flexible disulfide bridging aromatic dicarboxylate ligand, we chose 2,2-dithiobisbenzoic acid (H2dtbb, Scheme 1 (a)) as primary ligand to construct Cd(II) photoluminescent coordination polymers by taking advantage of its multicarboxylate bridging coordination ability together with the flexibility of its C–S–S–C bonds, incorporating the auxiliary ligands 2,2′-bipyridine (2,2′-bpy, Scheme 1(b)) for 2, 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (1,4-bix, Scheme 1(c)) for 3, and 1,4-bis(triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (1,4-btx, Scheme 1(d)) for 4. Herein, we report the syntheses, crystal structures and photoluminescent properties of four Cd(II) complexes with these ligands: [Cd(Hdtbb)(dtbb)0.5(DMF)] n (1), {[Cd(dtbb)(2,2′-bpy)(H2O)]·2DMA} n (2), {[Cd2(dtbb)2(1,4-bix)2]·3DMF} n (3) and [Cd(dtbb)(1,4-btx)] n (4). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods The ligand 1,4-bix and 1,4-btx were synthesized according to literatures [65,66]. All other reagents and solvents employed were commercially available and used as received without further purification. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were carried out using a Perkin–Elmer 240 elemental analyzer. The IR spectra were obtained as KBr pellets on a Bruker VECTOR 22 spectrometer in the 4000–400cm−1 region. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed on a TGAV5.1A Dupont 2100 instrument from room temperature to 600 or 800°C with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 in nitrogen environment. Luminescence spectra for the solid samples were recorded using a Hitachi 850 fluorescence spectrophotometer. 2.2 Synthesis of the complexes 2.2.1 [Cd(Hdtbb)(dtbb)0.5(DMF)] n (1) A mixture of CdCO3 (0.03g, 0.20mmol), H2dtbb (0.09g, 0.30mmol), DMF (2ml) , H2O (1ml) and NaOH (0.1mol/L, 2ml), was placed in a 25ml Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, which was sealed and heated at 80°C for 2d.

Empirical absorption corrections were applied by using the sadabs program [67]. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by the full matrix least-squares based on F 2 using shelxtl programe package [68]. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms except for those of water molecules were generated geometrically and refined using a riding model. Crystal data and details of the structure determination for complexes 1–4 are listed in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 2 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structure of complex 1 The crystallographic analysis reveals that 1 is a one dimensional chain coordination polymer. Complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic system, C2/c space group. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one crystallographically nonequivalent Cd(II) ion (Cd1), one Hdtbb− ligand, half dtbb2− ligand and one DMF molecule. Cd1 is six-coordinated by three oxygen atoms from two carboxylic groups of two dtbb2− ligands, two oxygen atoms from two carboxylic groups of two Hdtbb− ligands and one oxygen atom from DMF molecule, exhibiting the distorted octahedral geometry (Fig. 1 a). The six Cd–O distances range from 2.1796(14) to 2.5022(14)Å. The dtbb2− ligand adopts μ 4-η 1:η 1:η 1:η 1 coordination mode, and two carboxylate groups of ligand link to two Cd(II) ions in the bidentate bridging mode, while the partly deprotonated Hdtbb− anion employs μ 2-η 1:η 1:η 1 coordination mode and two carboxylate groups coordinate to two Cd(II) ions in the bidentate chelate and monodentate modes, respectively. The two aromatic rings of Hdtbb- ligands form dihedral angle and torsion angle (C3/S1/S1#4/C3#4) of 72.53(67)° and 89.63(92)°, the dihedral angle between the two phenyl rings of dtbb2− ligands and torsion angle (C14/S2/S3/C21) are 82.40(76)° and 88.42(99)°. Two Cd1 atoms are joined by carboxylate groups of two dtbb2− ligands construct a dimeric unit with Cd–Cd distance to be 3.654Å. These dimeric units are further organized into an infinite one dimensional chain through bidentate bridging mode dtbb2− ligands (Fig. 1b). While the other Hdtbb- anion connects this chain forming a one-dimensional triple chain structure (Fig. 1c). The O–H···O hydrogen bondings (O4···O6, 2.626(2)Å) stabilize the 1D chain structure. Further, such chains showing a parallel arrangement are connected by interchains C–H···O H-bonds between phenyl rings and carboxylic groups (Table S1, supporting information), forming a 3-D supramolecular network (Fig. S1). 3.2 Crystal structure of complex 2 X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that 2 crystallizes in a monoclinic space group P21/c and there are one Cd(II) ion (Cd1), one dtbb2− ligand, one 2,2′-bpy ligand, one H2O molecule and two free DMA molecules in the asymmetric unit. The Cd(II) ion is seven-coordinated by four oxygen atoms from two carboxylic groups of two different dtbb2− ligands, two nitrogen atoms from one 2,2′-bpy molecule and one O atom from water molecule in a pentagonal bipyramid geometry (Fig. 2 a). The five Cd–O distances range from 2.309(3) to 2.555(3)Å and the Cd–N bond lengths are 2.354(3)Å and 2.347(3)Å. The dtbb2− ligand is tetradentate, two carboxyl groups adopt bidentate chelating fashions. The pair of phenyl rings of dtbb2− employs a bended conformation, and the dihedral angle between the two phenyl rings and torsion angle (C7/S2/S1/C8) are 77.56 (11)°and 93.07(19)°. The Cd centers are linked together by the bis-chelating dtbb2− ligands to form a 1D chain (Fig. 2b). The 2,2′-bpy molecule coordinate to a Cd center in chelate mode. Interestingly, the DMA molecules is hydrogen bonded to coordinated H2O molecules and 2,2′-bpy phenyl rings, leading to the formation of a 3D supramolecular network (Table S1, Fig. S2). 3.3 Crystal structure of complex 3 Utilizing the bridging N,N′-donor ligand 1,4-bix, instead of the chelating ligand 2,2′-bipy, the 2D complex 3 is obtained. Complex 3 crystallizes in C2/c space group and the asymmetric unit contains one crystallographically nonequivalent Cd(II) ion (Cd1), one dtbb2− ligand, two half 1,4-bix molecules, one and a half DMF molecules (Fig. 3 a). Each Cd(II) ion is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from two carboxylic groups of two different dtbb2− ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two 1,4-bix molecules, resulting in a slightly distorted octahedral geometry. The four Cd–O distances fall in the range of 2.262(3)–2.522(3)Å and the Cd–N bond lengths are 2.227(3)Å and 2.262(3)Å. Each dtbb2− anion links two Cd(II) ions with its two carboxylate groups in bidentate chelating modes. The pair of phenyl rings of the ligand employs a bended conformation, the dihedral angle between the two phenyl rings and torsion angle (C7/S1/S2/C8) are 79.76(16)° and 88.65(20)°. Two crystallographically independent 1,4-bix ligands adopting trans conformations connect Cd1 atoms, alternately, to form a rare one dimensional meso-helical chain with a pitch of 23.925Å (Fig. 3b), which are further extended by the dtbb2− ligands to afford a 2D 4-connected staircase-like net (Fig. 3c and d). The adjacent 2D structure are linked together through both Cphenyl–H···Ocarboxylic and Cimidazol–H···Ocarboxylic hydrogen bonds (Table S1) to afford a 3D supramolecular network (Fig. S3). 3.4 Crystal structure of complex 4 Compound 4 crystallizes in the triclinic system, P 1 ¯ space group. It contains one crystallographically Cd(II) ion (Cd1), one dtbb2− ligand and one 1,4-btx ligand in the asymmetric unit. The coordination geometry for the six-coordinate Cd1 atom can be described as a distorted octahedral geometry (Fig. 4 a). The Cd1 atom is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from three different dtbb2− ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two 1,4-btx molecules. The Cd–O distances range from 2.232(4) to 2.374(4)Å and the Cd–N bond lengths are 2.291(4)Å and 2.382(4)Å. The two carboxylate groups of dtbb2− ligand adopt different coordination modes, namely bidentate bridging and chelating bidentate. The two aromatic rings of dtbb2− ligands form dihedral angle and torsion angle (C18/S1/S2/C19) of 84.80(22)° and 90.09(25)°. Cd1 atoms are connected by two carboxylate groups of two dtbb2− ligands construct a dimeric unit with Cd–Cd distance to be 4.407Å. Each Cd(II) dimeric unit connects with the other two neighboring ones by the dtbb2− ligands leading to an infinite one dimensional double chain (Fig. 4b). The cis-1,4-btx ligands linking one dimensional double chain further generate an infinite 2D framework (Fig. 4c). Binuclear Cd(II) units as 4-connected joints are bridged by two kinds of 2-connected struts: dtbb2− and 1,4-btx ligand, so the 2D net can be simplified to be a 44-sql net (Fig. 4d). The adjacent 2D nets pack to form the supramolecular network through intersheets C–H···O H-bonds (Table S1), C–H···πtriazol and C–H···πphenyl interactions (Table S2, Fig. S4). 3.5 The coordination modes of the multi-carboxylate dtbb2− ligands and effect of N-donor ligands It is known that multi-carboxylate ligands are good candidates for the construction of supramolecular frameworks with specific structure due to their varied coordination modes. According to the above structural descriptions of our example compounds, four kinds of coordination modes for the dtbb2− ligand are found as shown in Scheme 2 . In complexes 1–4, all the carboxylate groups of dtbb2− employ monodentate, bidentate chelating and bidentate bridging coordination modes. In 1, two carboxylate groups of dtbb2− ligand both adopt μ 2-η 1:η 1 bridging mode links to two Cd(II) ions, while those of another Hdbb- ligand coordinate to two Cd(II) ions in μ 1-η 1:η 0 and μ 1-η 1:η 1 modes (Scheme 2a and b). Two carboxylate groups in 2 and 3 both show chelating mode (μ 1-η 1:η 1) (Scheme 2c). Two carboxylate groups of dtbb2− ligand coordinated to Cd(II) ions in μ 1-η 1:η 1 and μ 2-η 1:η 1modes in the complex 4 (Scheme 2d). The results described above show that the bridging fashions of the dtbb2− ligand play an important role in the construction of supramolecular frameworks. In addition, the conformation of dtbb2− ligands impacts on the structures of coordination polymers. The S–S bond lengths, the C–S–S–C torsion angles, and the dihedral angle between two phenyl rings in dtbb2− ligands are listed in Table S3. The considerably larger dihedral angles, torsion angles and thus less repulsion between the two benzoate groups are believed to partially contribute to their thermodynamically and kinetically favored formation. A comparison of the crystal structures of 1–4 clearly indicates that the auxiliary N-donor ligands also have a significant influence on structural assembly of coordination architectures. When no auxiliary ligand or rigid chelating 2,2′-bpy is introduced, the expected low-dimensional species 1(1D) and 2 (1D) are obtained. However, when the semi-rigid bridging ligands 1,4-bix or 1,4-btx are introduced into the systems, the resulting complexes 3 and 4 show 2D coordination frameworks. 3.6 Thermal properties To examine the thermal stability of compounds 1–4, thermal gravimetric (TG) analyses were carried out (Fig. S5). Complex 1 gives a gradual weight loss of 11.24% in the range of 25–296°C, which corresponds to the loss of the DMF molecule (calculated 11.36%). The framework starts to decompose at 296°C. For complex 2, the weight loss between 95 and 218°C corresponds to the release of isolated DMA and coordinated H2O molecules (calcd 25.12%, obsd 25.55%), followed by losing the 2,2′-bpy molecules between 297 and 345°C (calcd 20.41%, obsd 20.96%), and then began to decompose upon further heating. For 3, the first weight loss of 13.86% (calcd 14.16%) in the range of 96–271°C reveals the exclusion of DMF molecule and immediately followed by the structure decomposition. In the case of 4, the 2D framework was stable up to 261°C, then a sharp weight loss occurs from 261 to 365°C(46.06%), and is attributed to the loss of the coordinated dtbb2− ligands (46.48%). 3.7 Photoluminescent Properties The solid-state emission spectra of the free H2dtsa ligand and complexes 1–4 were measured at room temperature (Fig. 5 ). The main emission peak of H2dtbb is at 465nm (λ ex =389nm), which may be attributed to π∗ →π transition. The compounds 1–4 show emissions at about 455nm (λ ex =396nm), 468nm (λ ex =395nm), 453nm (λ ex =403nm) and 452nm (λ ex =385nm), respectively. It should be pointed out that the emissions of compounds 1–4 are neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) in nature since the Cd2+ ions are difficult to oxidize or to reduce due to their d10 configuration, which are mainly based on the luminescence of ligands. They can probably be assigned to the intraligand π∗ →π transitions of dtbb2− ligand. Different intensity emission bands of 1–4 are probably due to the variation of the metal ions and the coordination environment around them because the photoluminescence behavior is closely associated with the metal ions and the ligands coordinated around them [69,70]. 4 Conclusion In summary, four novel Cd(II) coordination polymers have been synthesized based on 2,2-dithiobisbenzoic acid and different auxiliary N-donor ligands, which display various 1D and 2D topological networks. Our research results not only demonstrate that the coordination modes and conformations of the flexible dtbb2− ligand have a significant influence on the final supramolecular architectures of complexes 1–4, but also illustrate that the structural diversity in MOFs that can be achieved by adjustments of the auxiliary ligands in the present system. In addition, the photoluminescence investigation shows that all the coordination polymers 1–4 appear potentially applied as new luminescent materials.
