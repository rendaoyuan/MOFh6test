A coordination polymer [Cu(ONCP)(4,4′-BPDA)1/2(H2O)·(4,4′-H2BPDA)]n (1) has been hydrothermally synthesized. Compound 1 self-assembled with ligand 2-(2-carboxyphenyl)imidazo(4,5-f)-(1,10)phenanthroline (HONCP) and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (4,4′-H2BPDA) displays a 1D chain structure, which is further extended into a 2D layer structure through π–π stacking interactions. Compound 1 was characterized via single crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction and diffuse-reflectance UV–vis spectrum study. The degradation of organic dyes under UV–vis irradiation with 1 as the heterogeneous photocatalyst has been investigated and 1 shows a good photocatalytic property. Graphical abstract One CuII coordination compound with 2D structures based on 4,4′-H2BPDA and HONCP ligands has been hydrothermally synthesized. The behaviors of the title compound as the catalyst in photodegradation of organic dyes were also investigated. Keywords Copper(II) compound 2D layer structure Photocatalyst Degradation Organic dyes Currently, the design and synthesis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted a continual attention due to not only their attractive structural topologies, but also their versatile applications in gas storage [1], catalysis [2], optical applications [3], and magnetism [4]. In this field, mixed-ligand networks have received great attention recently. 1,10-Phenanthroline (phen), as a common organic ligand, has been widely used in the construction of metal–organic coordination polymers [5]. The phen derivative 2-(2-carboxyphenyl)imidazo(4,5-f)-(1,10)phenanthroline (HONCP) with both phenanthroline ring and carboxylate groups is a good building block for the construction of coordination polymers [6]. Moreover, the long-conjugated system and the carboxylate groups are inclined to form π–π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions, which are important factors in the formation of supramolecular architectures. However, to date, only a handful of supramolecular architectures based on HONCP molecules have been described [7]. Meanwhile, the organic aromatic poly-carboxylate ligands have been extensively applied in the construction of a rich variety of MOFs because of their diverse coordination modes and high structural stability [8]. 4,4′-Biphenyldicarboxylic acid (4,4′-H2BPDA) as a rigid aromatic multicarboxylate ligand with high symmetry may extend the structure into high dimensionality. Thus, the two special functionalized ligands would lead to novel coordination networks. Based on the above considerations, we selected 4,4-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (4,4′-H2BPDA) as a linker and HONCP as a secondary ligand, generating a new coordination polymer [Cu(ONCP)(4,4′-BPDA)1/2(H2O)·(4,4′-H2BPDA)]n (1), which is reported here. The crystal structure of 1 is presented and discussed. Furthermore, the behaviors of compound 1 as the catalyst in photodegradation of organic dyes were also investigated. Compound 1 was synthesized hydrothermally through self-assembly of Cu(NO3)2 with 4,4′-H2BPDA and HONCP in a molar ratio of 1.5:1:0.5 in water at 433K for 3days [9,10]. Compound 1 possesses a one-dimensional structure that crystallizes in space group P-1. The asymmetric unit of 1 (shown in Fig. 1 ) consists of one Cu2+, one ONCP- ligand, half 4,4′-BPDA2- ligand, one coordinated H2O molecule and half free 4,4′-H2BPDA ligand. Cu(II) center is five-coordinated with two chelating nitrogen atoms from ONCP- ligand and three oxygen atoms from ONCP- ligand, 4,4′-BPDA2- ligand and one coordinated water molecule. The coordination geometry of Cu1 can be described as a distorted trigonal bipyramid, the N3C, O1W, O1 atoms comprise the equatorial plane and N2C, O3 occupy the axial positions [N2CCu1O3=169.78(15)°]. The Cu1N and Cu1O bond lengths are in the range of 1.992(4) Å to 2.010(3) Å and 1.949(3) Å to 1.969(3) Å. The main distortions from the ideal trigonal bipyramid geometry occur in the axial position owing to the presence of ONCP− chelating ligands and result in the acute N2CCu1N3C and N2CCu1xO1 angles. Each ONCP− anion coordinates to two Cu(II) atoms in trident coordination mode and binuclear units with Cu1…Cu1 distance of 7.448Å, in which two ONCP− ligands are parallel. Then, neighboring binuclear units are bridged by 4,4′-BPDA2- ligands, forming a single-chain structure (Fig. 2 ). Interestingly, around each coordinated 4,4′-BPDA2- ligand, there are two free 4,4′-H2BPDA ligands. Besides, the adjacent chains are stacked to furnish a 2D layer structure (Fig. 3 ) via π–π interactions between the pyridine rings of ONCP− ligands (centroid-to-centroid distance of ca. 3.453Å). The advantages of MOFs as a photocatalyst based on the presence of organic linkers and transition metal centers, leading to different ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transitions, make MOFs versatile and potentially tunable photocatalysts. Herein, we chose compound 1 as the photocatalyst to degrade organic dyes. We also investigated its properties in powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and UV–vis diffuse-reflectance. The crystal structure of compound 1 after organic dyes a degradation reaction was recorded by PXRD analysis (Fig. 4 ). The almost identical diffraction pattern of compound 1 before and after the photocatalysis process illustrates that no structural transformation happened, but with the slight variations in the diffraction intensities. The diffuse-reflectance UV–vis spectra reveal the absorption features of compound 1 (Fig. 5 ). The spectra consist of absorption components in the UV and visible regions, whereas the main UV absorption bands at 255nm and 333nm can be attributed to π–π* transitions of the ligands. Furthermore, a clear peak for 1 in the visible region observed at 620nm, which probably originated from the d–d spin-allowed the transition of the Cu2+ (d7) ions [11]. Compound 1 exhibits absorption band in the visible region, which indicates that 1 may undergo photochemical processes and exhibit responses upon visible-light excitation. So we chose a tungsten lamp as the light source to study the photocatalytic activity of compound 1. Herein, four organic dyes, orange G (OG), rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB) and methyl violet (MV), were selected as model pollutants in aqueous media to evaluate the photocatalytic effectiveness of 1. The photodegradation experiment under UV–vis light irradiation was carried out after the dark adsorption equilibrium achieved according to the previous reported literature [12]. From Fig. 6a, we can conclude that 71.61% MB, 38.61% OG, 12.68% RhB, and 25.39% MV were successfully photodegraded with the presence of 1 under UV–vis lamp irradiation after 5h (Fig. 6a). The photodegradation of organic dyes over 1 photocatalyst follows the first-order kinetics model (Fig. 6b). The first-order kinetics can be written as ln(C0 /C)=−Kt according to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model, wherein, C0 is the initial concentration of the MV, C is the t time's concentration of organic dyes, t is the reaction time, and K is the kinetic rate constant. The values of K were obtained from the slope and the intercept of the linear plot, as listed in Table 1 . Compared with the work reported by J. J. Du et al., the compound 1 we synthesized exhibits better photocatalytic properties [13]. In addition, the stability of 1 was monitored using PXRD during the photocatalytic process. After photocatalysis, compound 1 displays a similar PXRD pattern to the original, implying that the stability toward photocatalytic reactions for 1 is excellent (Fig. 4). The present contribution suggests that compound 1 can be applied to photodegrade organic dye pollutants. The synthesis and structure of [Cu(ONCP)(4,4′-BPDA)1/2(H2O)·(4,4′-H2BPDA)]n (1) have been accomplished by employing hydrothermal method. The sample has been characterized using a variety of techniques such as powder XRD, single-crystal XRD, IR, UV–vis and photocatalytic studies. The compound 1 appears to be active for the photocatalytic degradation of common organic dyes (MB, OG, RhB and MV) used in textile industries, particularly suitable to MB dye. It may be a feasible way to the rational design and synthesis of metal–organic frameworks with a fascinating structure and photocatalytic property.

Cu(NO3)2 (0.15mmol, 0.0362g), 4,4′-H2BPDA (0.1mmol, 0.0242g) and ONCP (0.05mmol, 0.0170g) were mixed in 10ml deionized water. Its pH value was controlled in the range of 7–8 with 1moll−1 NaOH solution. The resulting solution was stirred for about 0.5h at room temperature, then sealed in a 25ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 433K for 3days under autogenous pressure. Afterward, the reaction system was cooled slowly to room temperature. Blue block-shaped crystals of complex 1 suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis were collected from the final reaction system by filtration, washed several times with distilled water and dried in air at ambient temperature (yield 65%, based on Cu).

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for complex 1 were recorded on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD area-detector diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073Å) using the ω scan technique. All the structures were solved by direct methods using the program SHELXS-97 (G. M. Sheldrick, SHELXS-97, Programs for X-ray Crystal Structure Solution, University of Göttingen, Germany, 1997.) and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques against F2 using the SHELXTL-97 crystallographic software package(G. M. Sheldrick, SHELXL-97, Programs for X-ray Crystal Structure Refinement, University of Göttingen, Germany, 1997). Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic temperature parameters, the hydrogen atoms associated with carbon and nitrogen atoms were generated geometrically. The H atoms of free water molecules in compound 1 could not be positioned reliably. [11] L.L. Wen F. Wang J. Feng K.L. Lv C.G. Wang D.F.
