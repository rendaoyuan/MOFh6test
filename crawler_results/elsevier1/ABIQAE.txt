Tel.: +91-342-255-8545; fax: +91-342-253-0452 Synthesis and X-ray structural characterisation of two neutral 1D polymers, [Cd(imH)2(NCS)(SCN)] n (1) and [Cd(pfan)(NCS)(SCN)] n (2) were carried out. In both polymers 1 and 2, octahedral CdII ions occupy centre of symmetry with a CdN4S2 chromophore. Supramers 1 and 2 display intraligand 1(π–π *) fluorescence and intraligand 3(π–π *) phosphorescence in glassy solutions (MeOH at 77 K). Treatment of Cd(NO3)2 ·4H2O with two equivalents of NH4NCS in combination with two equivalents of imH [imH=imidazole] or one equivalent of pfan [pfan=((pyridin-2-yl)formylidene)aniline] results neutral 1D polymers of the type [Cd(imH)2(NCS)(SCN)] n (1) or [Cd(pfan)(NCS)(SCN)] n (2). X-ray structure determinations show that in both polynuclear 1 and 2, octahedral CdII ions occupy centre of symmetry with a CdN4S2 chromophore. The metal ions are linked through N and S atoms of NCS− alternately in doubly bridged end-to-end fashion; two mutually trans N atoms of monodentate imH units complete hexacoordination of each metal centre in 1. Similar NCS-bibridging chain is present in 2 with one bidentate (N,N) Schiff base chelator (pfan) in cis orientation. The 1D chains in 1 are further engaged in intermolecular hydrogen bonding (N–H⋯S) between N of imH and coordinated S of NCS− along with aromatic π–π stacking of imH moieties that constrain the 1D chains to lie in bc-plane, which are further linked via C–H⋯π interactions. In 2, 1D chains participate in two kinds of π–π interactions. Supramers 1 and 2 display intraligand 1(π–π *) fluorescence and intraligand 3(π–π *) phosphorescence in glassy solutions (MeOH at 77 K). Keywords Cadmium(II)thiocyanate Polymer Schiff base Imidazole Supramolecular synthon 1 Introduction The construction [1] of sophisticated inorganic–organic hybrid [2] supramolecular networks [3] based on organised strong covalent interactions [4] and extensive lateral weak non-covalent forces like hydrogen bonding [5], π–π stacking [6] and C–H⋯π interactions [7] is an area of great activity due to fabrication of functional materials [8–13] utilizing the wide variety in properties associated with each suitably tailored component. Among the weak forces, hydrogen bonding is a general protocol for structure directing master key interaction, and has been widely used towards crystal design [5,14,15]. On the contrary, less attention [6,7,16,17] has been paid to cooperative weaker π⋯π and C–H⋯π interactions, which may tune topology [18] effectively and untangle the intrigue interactions in peptide and protein structures and associated properties [19]. Recently, we have established the composition tailored superstructures [20] on luminous zinc(II)azides containing a tailored diimine, 2,2′-dipyridylamine (dpa) with active amine (–NH–) hydrogen and aromatic π rings. In continuation of our research on congeneric cadmium, we have investigated its binding with thiocyanate in combination with a monodentate blocker, imidazole (imH), and bidentate Schiff base chelator, ((pyridin-2-yl)formylidene)aniline (pfan), with or without active hydrogen on ligand network coping with possible H-bonding, face-to-face π⋯ π and/or edge-to-face C–H⋯π interactions due to the presence of aromatic π-rings towards preparation of metallosupramolecules of different aggregates. Polynuclear cadmium complexes in which the metal centres are in close proximity has received much attention due to study of electronic and optoelectronic properties [21] towards designing of new inorganic materials [22]. Thiocyanate is a putative ambidentate ligand, which results in different molecular architectures through its versatile ligation modes [23]. Imidazole [24] with its active –NH– hydrogen and aromatic π-ring, is a versatile blocker and the interest in its chemistry arises from the use as ionic liquids [25] and in different compounds from a biological and pharmacological applications [26]. Schiff bases [27,28] have recently been focussed by the coordination chemists due to their preparational accessibilities, structural varieties and varied denticities. The present work stems from our interest to build new crystalline aggregates in cadmium bound states with such bridging units. Successfully we have prepared and X-ray crystallographically characterized two one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers of the type [Cd(imH)2(NCS)(SCN)] n (1) and [Cd(pfan)(NCS)(SCN)] n (2). 1 and 2 exhibit fascinating self-assembled structural topologies via cooperative H-bonds and aromatic face-to-face π⋯π and edge-to-face C–H⋯π interactions (in 1) or via π⋯π interactions (in 2). In this paper an emphasis has been made to show how use of such intermolecular cooperative forces may be harnessed to engineer novel crystalline architectures. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials High purity imidazole (SRL, India), aniline (E. Merck, India), pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde (Lancester, UK), cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (E. Merck, India) and ammonium thiocyanate (E. Merck, India) were purchased from respective concerns and used as received. The Schiff base (pfan) was prepared [28b] by condensing pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde with aniline in dehydrated alcohol in the 1:1 molar ratio. After 8 h reflux the reaction solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to a gummy mass, which was dried and stored in vacuo over CaCl2 for subsequent use. Yield: 0.137 g (70%). Anal. Calc. for C12H10N2: C, 79.10; H, 5.53; N, 15.37. Found: C, 78.98; H, 5.46; N, 15.65%. IR (KBr, cm−1): ν(CN), 1590 cm−1. UV–Vis (λ, nm): 254, 390. All other chemicals and solvents were AR grade and were used as received. 2.2 Physical measurements Elemental analyses (carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen) were performed on a Perkin–Elmer 2400 CHNS/O elemental analyzer. IR spectra (KBr discs, 4000–300 cm−1) were recorded using a JASCO FTIR model 420 spectrometer. Molar conductances were measured using a Systronics conductivity meter where the cell constant was calibrated with 0.01 M KCl solution and dry MeOH was used as solvent. Ground state absorption and steady-state fluorescence measurements were made with a JASCO model V-530 UV–Vis spectrophotometer and Hitachi model F-4010 spectrofluorimeter, respectively. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer Edinburgh Instruments, model 199; a hydrogen filled coaxial flash lamp with a pulse width of 1.2 ns at FWHM and a Philips XP-2020Q Photomultiplier tube were, respectively, used as the excitation source and the fluorescence detector. 2.3 Preparation of the complexes The complexes were prepared using 1:2:2 and 1:1:2 mole ratio of the metal, ligand and thiocyanate for 1 and 2, respectively. The typical syntheses are described below. 2.3.1 [Cd(imH)2(NCS)(SCN)]n (1) Solid imH (0.136 g, 2 mmol) was added slowly to Cd(NO3)2 ·4H2O (0.308 g, 1 mmol) dissolved in methanol (10 cm3). To this, a methanol solution (5 cm3) of NH4NCS (0.152 g, 2 mmol) was added (5 cm3). The resulting colourless solution was filtered and was kept for slow evaporation. After seven days colourless crystals that were separated, was collected by filtration, washed with toluene and dried in vacuo over silica gel indicator. Yield: 0.095 g (80%). Anal. Calc. for C8H8N6S2Cd (1): C, 26.34; H, 2.21; N, 23.04. Found: C, 26.52; H, 2.31; N, 22.31%. IR (KBr, cm−1): ν(N–H) 3310; ν(CN), 2120, 2106. Λ M (MeOH, Ω −1 cm2 mol−1): 5; UV–Vis (λ, nm): 311. 2.3.2 [Cd(pfan)(NCS)(SCN)]n (2) Pfan (0.182 g, 1 mmol) in MeOH (10 cm3) was added dropwise to a solution of Cd(NO3)2 ·4H2O (0.308 g, 1 mmol) in the same solvent (10 cm3). To the resulting yellowish brown mixture, aqueous solution (5 cm3) of NH4NCS (0.152 g, 2 mmol) was added slowly. The final mixture was filtered and the supernatant liquid was kept in air for slow evaporation. After about a week compound 2 was separated which was collected by filtration, washed with toluene and dried in vacuo over silica gel indicator. Yield: 0.093 g (70%). Anal. Calc. for C14H10N4S2Cd (2): C, 40.94; H, 2.45; N, 13.64. Found: C, 40.68; H, 2.57; N, 13.52%. IR (KBr, cm−1): ν(CN), 2120, 2104. Λ M (MeOH, Ω −1 cm2 mol−1): 5; UV–Vis (λ, nm): 328. 2.4 X-ray crystallographic analyses Single crystals of the title complexes were obtained by slow evaporation of methanol (1) and 4:1 methanol–water (2) solutions of the reaction mixtures at room temperature (298 K). Suitable colourless crystals were mounted on a Siemens SMART CCD (1) and Bruker-AXS SMART APEX/CCD (2) diffractometers equipped with a graphite-monochromator and Mo Kα (λ=0.71073 Å) radiation. Diffraction data for both 1 and 2 were measured using the ω-scan method. Crystal data, data collection parameters and the results of analyses can be found in Table 1 . The intensity data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects and an empirical absorption correction was employed using the saint [29] and sadabs [30] program for crystal 1, and no absorption correction was made for 2. The structures were solved by direct methods and the structure solution and refinement were based on |F|2. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters whereas hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions when possible and given isotropic U values 1.2 times that of the atom to which they are bonded. The final difference Fourier map showed the highest residual electron density of 1.091 e Å−3 at a distance of 0.62 Å from Cd(II) atom for 2, having no chemical significance. All crystallographic calculations were conducted with shelxl-97 [31], ORTEP-32 [32], platon programs [33] for 1 and the shelxtl v.6.1 program package [34] for 2. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and formulation The coordination polymer [Cd(imH)2(NCS)(SCN)] n (1) was prepared as a colourless powder through one-pot reactions of a 1:2:2 molar ratio of the metal nitrate, organic blocker and the pseudohalide from methanolic solutions. The other polymer [Cd(pfan)(NCS)(SCN)] n (2) was obtained with a 1:1:2 molar ratio of cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate, pfan and ammonium thiocyanate, respectively, in aqueous alcohol. The compounds have been characterized by microanalytical (C, H and N) results, IR, UV–Vis spectral data and other physicochemical properties. The air-stable moisture-insensitive complexes [Cd(imH)2(NCS)(SCN)] n (1) and [Cd(pfan)(NCS)(SCN)] n (2) are soluble in common organic solvents like, methanol, ethanol, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide. In methanol both behave as non-electrolytes as is evident [35] from their low conductivity values (ca. 5 Ω −1 cm2 mol−1). The IR spectra show two strong peaks at 2120, 2106 cm−1 in 1 and 2120, 2104 cm−1 in 2, which are assigned to ν as(CN) stretching vibrations [36]. The position (>2100 cm−1) and number of signals strongly suggest mutual cis alignment as well as N- and S-coordinated bridging nature of the bound thiocyanates. The X-ray diffraction study confirms this hypothesis. The solution of 1 in MeOH is colourless and exhibits absorption at 311 nm while the faint yellow solution of complex 2 displays bands at 328 nm. Reflectance spectra [1: λ, 310 nm; 2: λ, 325 nm] in nujol and electronic spectra in MeOH solutions are akin in both complexes reflecting similar gross structure and electronic structure in solid state and in solution in each case. 3.2 Structure The structural analyses show that 1 and 2 consist of strong 1D covalent chains cooperated by weak N–H⋯S hydrogen bonding, π⋯π stacking and C–H⋯π interactions in 1 and two kinds of π⋯π interactions in 2. The ORTEP diagrams of part of the chains with atom labeling scheme, perspective view of the 2D sheets and arrangement of these sheets are shown in Figs. 1–3 (for 1) and Figs. 4–6 (for 2), respectively. Selected interatomic bond distances and bond angles of 1 and 2 are set in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. The significant hydrogen bonding, π⋯π interaction and C–H⋯ interaction parameters can be found in Table 4 following the criteria of Janiak [37]. Complex 1 is made up of 1D chains along c-axis. The coordination environment around each cadmium(II) is best described as distorted octahedron with CdN4S2 chromophore (Fig. 1) in a trans,trans,trans geometry of imH nitrogens and nitrogen and sulphur atoms of coordinated NCS−. Each cadmium(II) is attached to four NCS− bridges and two pendant imH ligands. The metal ion occupies centre of inversion. Two N atoms (N1, N1a) of pendant imH ligands and two N atoms (N3c, N3b) of bridging NCS− form the equatorial plane. The trans axial positions are occupied by the two symmetry related S atoms. The distortion of each cadmium(II) is reflected from the cisoid angles [87.80(5)°–92.20(5)°] (Table 2). The eight-membered Cd–(SCN)2–Cd rings adopt chair conformation. The intrachain Cd⋯Cd separation is 5.769 Å. The polymeric chains of [Cd(imH)2(NCS)(SCN)] n (1) pack alongside each other to give a 2D sheet-like structure in bc-plane. Closest 1D chains are arranged side by side to facilitate a weak N–H⋯S hydrogen bond (Table 4). The 2D sheets are further stabilised by a face-to-face π⋯π interactions from two terminal imH rings of two closest chains (Fig. 2). Every such sheet is further locked by a C–H⋯π interaction (Table 4) to generate an aesthetically pleasant solid state continuum (Fig. 3). In 2 cadmium(II) centres are linked by bibridged end-to-end thiocyanato ligands resulting a 1D polymeric infinite chain (Fig. 4) which is composed of [Cd(pfan)(NCS)(SCN)] monomer where the metal centres are coordinated by both N and S in cis position. Each cadmium(II) ion is linked with two of its neighbouring symmetry related counterparts (Cd1*), by two end-to-end thiocyanate ligands, and effectively each metal centre is ligated with four bridging pseudohalides producing two eight-membered loops. Similar to 1, the eight-membered Cd–(SCN)2–Cd loops adopt chair conformation. Octahedral coordination around each metal centre is completed through binding to one bidentate pfan chelator forming a five-membered loop. This feature makes the polymeric structure unique. One nitrogen atom (N1) from bidentate Schiff base chelator, one nitrogen atom (N3#) and two sulphur atom (S1, S2) of the three NCS− define the equatorial plane around cadmium. The trans axial sites are occupied by nitrogen atom (N2) from bidentate organic blocker and fourth nitrogen (N4*) of the bridging thiocyanate. Deviation of cadmium(II) from the mean plane formed by four equatorial atoms (N1, N3#, S1, S2) is about 0.1713 Å. The Cd–N bond lengths are shorter than the bridging Cd–S distances (Table 3) and are consistent with the corresponding values of cadmium(II)thiocyanato bridging system [23]. Cd1-N1 [imine] distance is slightly greater than Cd1–N2 [pyridine] bond length. Angles in the equatorial plane are close to the ideal 90.00° and lie within a close range [86.21(3)°–93.73(8)°]. Trans axial angle N2–Cd1–N4* shows slight deviation from ideal 180.00°. The dihedral angle between the planar pyridine and benzene moieties of pfan ligand is 47.3(2)°. The nearest neighbouring Cd⋯Cd distances within the chain are 5.908 and 5.795 Å. The chains of [Cd(pfan)(NCS)(SCN)] n (2) pack alongside each other to give a sheet-like structure (Fig. 5) in bc-plane containing only π⋯π interactions. Here, two pyridyl rings from two closest chains are linked through face-to-face π-interactions (Table 4). The 2D sheets are further locked by another weaker face-to-face π⋯π interactions from two terminal benzene rings (Fig. 6), where the π-interactions (Table 4) are mainly responsible for the formation of solid state. Recent literature on π⋯π interactions in metal complexes containing pyridyl-type ligands [38,39] shows that such non-covalent interaction plays an important role on crystal packing, and aromatic N-heterocycles are well suited for fabricating congregated π⋯π motifs because of their low π-electron density. Likewise, the presence of two N atoms in imH blocker in 1 facilitates such relatively stronger non-covalent interactions as compared to that in 2. 3.3 Luminescence spectra The spectroscopic data in methanol solutions and glasses are listed in Table 5 . 1 shows emission spectrum at 348 nm while compound 2 has a band at 395 nm at 298 K (Fig. 7 ). These are assignable to intraligand 1(π–π *) fluorescence. 2 has very weak fluorescence; the lifetimes are 2.04 ns (1) and 2.42 ns (2), respectively. Though complex 1 shows overall stronger weak interaction, this higher lifetime in 2 may be due to the presence of a stronger π⋯π interactions (pyridyl–pyridyl), which is mainly responsible for fluorescence. In glassy solutions (77 K) a red shift is observable (417 nm for 1 and 470 nm for 2) which is presumably due to 3(π–π *) phosphorescence. 4 Conclusion Two new inorganic organic composite luminous polymers are synthesised through single-pot reactions of the building components with preassigned ratios. The C–H(imH)⋯π interaction in 1 indicates acidity of C–H proton of imH ring. No such hydrogen bonding in 2 indicates less acidity of the C–H proton in pfan Schiff base. The presence of more than one hetero N in imH compared to single N in pyridine ring of pfan facilitates such weak force, and topology is engineered accordingly. Structures 1 and 2 represent the reliability of combinations of strong/weak interactions in crystal engineering because of the concomitant predictability of the crystal design. This work reflects that a combination of a moderate to strong interaction and a weaker interaction seems to result synthon robustness giving variable architectures. In the future, we will expand the types of networks through change of organic blocker, metal template and bridging unit. 5 Supplementary data Crystallographic data (excluding structure factors) for the structures reported in this paper have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as supplementary publication nos.
