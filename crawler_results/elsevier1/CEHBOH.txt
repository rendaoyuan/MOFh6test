Graphical abstract Five compounds have been synthesized by hydrothermal reactions, from which three kinds of in situ ligands syntheses involving malic acid, addition, intra-molecular dehydration and isomeric transformation, have been discovered. According these discoveries, it can be concluded that the nature of metal atom strongly affects the in situ ligand synthesis, vice versa, the in situ ligand synthesis is benefit to the formation of coordination compound. Three kinds of in situ ligands syntheses involving malic acid, i.e. hydration, intra-molecular dehydration and isomeric transformation, have been found during studying on the syntheses of compounds 1–5. According these results, it can be concluded that the nature of metal atom affects strongly the in situ ligand synthesis, vice versa; the in situ ligand synthesis is favorable to the formation of coordination compound. Keywords In situ ligand synthesis Malic acid Metal nature Hydrothermal condition 1 Introduction Recently, in situ ligand synthesis as a new approach to the coordination complex has been noted extensively, in which ligand precursor is used in place of ligand to react with metal directly to produce single crystals containing novel organic ligands [1]. Novel complexes with in situ formed ligands are of great interest in coordination chemistry and organic chemistry for the discovery of new organic reactions and understanding their mechanisms. Although some of them were prepared by traditional synthesis methods, the hydro(solvo)thermal method has demonstrated increasing success in providing alternative pathways to complexes with in situ ligands syntheses, which not only provides a powerful synthesis method for organic ligands that cannot normally be obtained by traditional methods, but also represents a potential new direction for novel coordination compounds. More than ten types [2–20] of in situ ligand syntheses in hydrothermal conditions have been reported, such as hydrolyses, hydroxylation, acylate reaction, formation of triazoles and tetrazoles by cycloaddition, transformation between inorganic sulfur and organic sulfur, etc. All of these reports mainly researched on the topological structures and the potential applications of the coordination complexes and only few of them inferred the mechanisms of the in situ reactions. In this paper, we are discussing systematically all kinds of in situ ligand syntheses involving malic acid, among which three kinds have been found by us during studying on the syntheses of compounds 1–5. Among compounds 1–5, compounds 1 and 4 have been reported by others [21,22], but we synthesize them by different methods and report them in this paper in order to discuss the in situ ligand synthesis involving malic acid systematically. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All the chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Infrared spectra were recorded as KBr pellets using a Perkin–Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer in the 400–4000cm−1 region.

The hydrazine hydrate (1ml) was added to the Na3VO4 solution (0.8g, 15ml) at pH 1.0. After stirred 5min, malic acid (0.27g) and phen (0.4g) were added to the mixture, the blue solution was heated at 170°C for 3 days. Then, the dark-red solution was obtained and evaporated slowly at room temperature. The pH value of the final solution is 8. The dark-red crystals were filtered off after several days (yield 0.41g, 23.4% based on V), which dehydrate easily in atmosphere. Anal. Calc. for C38H62N6O14V: C, 52.90; H, 7.24; N, 9.74. Found: C, 52.83; H, 7.29; N, 9.68%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3427 (s), 1692 (m), 1631 (m), 1513 (w), 1454 (w), 1425 (m), 1382 (w), 1171 (w), 1046 (m), 843 (m), 774 (w), 723 (m). 2.3 Crystal structure determinations Data were collected with Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.71073Å) with a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID IP diffractometer for compounds 1 and 4, with a Siemens P4 diffractometer for compounds 2 and 3, and with a Siemens SMART CCD diffractometer for compound 5. Empirical absorption corrections were applied for all compounds. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined with full-matrix least-squares technique using shelxs-97 and shelxp-97 programs, respectively. Anisotropic thermal parameters were applied to all non-hydrogen atoms. For compound 1, the hydrogen atoms were located from difference maps and refined with isotropic temperature factors. For compounds 2–5, the hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms were placed geometrically, while no attempt was made to locate the hydrogen atoms for water molecules and hydroxy groups. Details of the final refinements of compounds 2, 3 and 5 are given in Table 1 . 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Crystal structures X-ray single-crystal structure analyses revealed that in compound 1, the Zn atoms are six coordinated by two carboxylate oxygen atoms and one hydroxy oxygen atom from malate, one water molecule and two nitrogen atoms from phen. The malate ligand, which is formed through hydration reaction of maleic acid, links Zn atoms to 1D supramolecular chain (shown in Fig. 1 ). The detail of the structure of 1 has been described in Ref. [21], in which compound 1 was synthesized from Zn(OAc)2, phen and fumaric acid. Compounds 2 and 3 are iso-structural with 1. For compound 4, the two crystallographic unique Cd atoms are both seven coordinated by five carboxylate oxygen atoms from fumarate and two nitrogen atoms from phen molecule. The fumarate ligands, formed by the isomer transfer reaction of maleic acid, display two kinds of coordination modes, and link the Cd atoms to 2D supramolecular network (shown in Fig. 2 ). Compound 4 can also be synthesized by hydrothermal reactions of Cd(phen)2(NO3)2 and fumaric acid, which was described detailed in Ref. [22]. ORTEP diagram of the cation [V(phen)3]4+ and the free fumarate dianion of compound 5 is shown in Fig. 3 (a). The vanadium atom is coordinated by six nitrogen atoms from three phen molecules with the mean V–N distance 1.991Å, which is shorter than the ones observed in vanadium coordination compounds reported previously [23–27]. The oxidation state of V(IV) is identified by ESR spectrum. The fumarate dianion, which is formed through the dehydration reaction of malic acid, acts as counter anion. The bond length and angles of compound 5 were listed in Table 2 . Fig. 3(b) displays the packing structure of 5, the coordination compound layers (containing [V(phen)3]4+ and (C4H2O4)2− moieties) and the water layers (containing water molecules and hydroxy groups) pack alternatively along a-axis. It is must be mentioned that the lattice water molecules hydrogen bond to each other to form the chair-configure hexamer and dimmer water clusters (see electronic supplementary information). Additionally, the carboxylate oxygen atom O1 hydrogen bonds to Ow8. It is the hydrogen-bonds and the π–π interactions stabilize the crystal structure. 3.2 Syntheses It is interesting that the ligands of all of the five compounds are generated by in situ syntheses. For compounds 1–3, maleate transferred to malate in the presence of Zn(II), Co(II) and Fe(II), respectively, at pH 8. And compound 1 can also be synthesized by the hydrothermal reactions of Zn(II), fumaric acid and phen in the similar condition [19]. So, both maleic acid and fumaric acid can in situ transfer to malic acid under hydrothermal condition in the presence of appropriate metal atoms. The mechanism of the two in situ ligand syntheses is probably similar to that of ethylene hydration reactions to form alcohols in basic conditions. It must be mentioned that if Zn(II) atom reacts directly with the malate and phen ligand, only phen molecules exist in products, which suggests that the in situ ligand synthesis is favorable to the formation of coordination polymers. It is surprised that the maleate did not transfer to malate but to fumarate in the presence of Cd(II) (for compound 4) in the same condition, which is very different to compounds 1–3. Although compound 4 can also be prepared through hydrothermal reactions of Cd(phen)2(NO3)2 and fumaric acid [20], the in situ cis–trans isomeric transformation of substituted ethylene promoted our interesting. To our knowledge, this is the second example of in situ isomeric transformation. The first one [17] is that trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene transferred to cis-isomer in the presence of Cu(I) in illumination condition, to form 1D zigzag supramolecular chain. Comparing compounds 1–3 to 4, it can be concluded that the in situ ligand synthesis is strongly affected by the metal nature. For compound 5, the malate acid can in situ intra-molecular dehydrate to form fumarate in the presence of vanadium in strong acid condition. It was reported by Zhang et al. [18] that malic acid can in situ intermolecular dehydrate to form 2,2′-oxydisuccinate in strong acid condition during the formation of compound [Cd2(meso-odsc)(H2O)] (odsc=2,2′-oxydisuccinate) 6, which was synthesized by hydrothermal reactions of Cd(II) and malic acid in pH 2. So, malic acid can in situ intramolecular and intermolecular dehydrate at strong acid condition in the presence of V(IV) and Cd(II), respectively, which further verify that the in situ ligand synthesis is strongly affected by the metal nature. Additionally, it was also reported that malic acid can in situ reacted with en (en=ethylenediamine) to form N-aminoethyl aspartate in hydrothermal condition at pH 6 (for compound [CoIII(aea)(2,2′-bipy)]·Cl·H2O (aea= N-aminoethyl aspartate dianion) 7) [28]. 4 Conclusion Studying on the in situ reactions occurred during the syntheses of compounds 1–7, we can summarize (Scheme 1 ) that: (a) both maleic acid and fumaric acid can in situ hydrate to form malic acid in weak basic condition in the presence of Zn(II)/Co(II)/Fe(II) (for compounds 1–3); (b) maleic acid can in situ isomeric transform to fumaric acid in the presence of Cd(II) in weak basic condition (for compound 4); (c) malic acid can in situ intra-molecular dehydrate to form fumaric acid in the presence of V(IV) in acid condition (for compound 5); (d) malic acid can also in situ intermolecular dehydrate to form odsc in the presence Cd(II) in strong acid condition (for compound 6); (e) malic acid and en can intermolecular dehydration to form aea (for compound 7). The relation of all these in situ reactions are summarized in Scheme 1, from which, some conclusions can be obtained: (1) the mechanism of isomeric transformation perhaps can be explained that the maleate hydrate to form malate, followed by the intermolecular dehydrating of malate to form fumarate. But no product was observed when metal atom react with malic acid directly; so, (2) in situ syntheses ligands is favorable to the formation of coordination compounds; (3) the metal acts as the important roles in the in situ ligand synthesis. 5 Magnetic properties The variation of the molar magnetic susceptibilities χ M were investigated for compounds 2 and 3 in the temperature range 5–300K in a 10kG applied field. Fig. 4 shows the magnetic behavior of 2 and 3 in the forms of μ eff versus T and χ M versus T plots. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the μ eff value is 4.92 μ e at 300K, and decrease gradually to 4.13 μ e during the temperature decreasing to 5K, which implies the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions between Co(II) ions in the 1D supramolecular chain of 2, which is further confirmed by a negative Weiss constant θ =−11.9K, derived from the Curie–Weiss law. Compound 3 also displays antiferromagnetic interactions between Fe(II) ions (shown in Fig. 4(b)) with the negative Weiss constant θ =−40.2K. 6 Summary Three kinds of in situ ligands syntheses, which are hydration, intra-molecular dehydration and isomeric transformation of substituted ethylene, have been achieved under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of appropriate metal atoms. The nature of metal atom strongly affects the in situ ligand synthesis and the in situ ligand synthesis is favorable to the formation of coordination compound.
