China ∗ Corresponding author. Tel./fax: +86-591-3729860 Three novel coordination polymers [Cd3(TMA)2(H-PRZ)(H2O)3(OH)]·H2O (1), Cd2Na2(TMA)2(H2O)4 (2) and [Cd2Co(TMA)2(H2O)4]·2H2O (3) have been synthesized via a hydrothermal route and characterized. Complex 1 is a sandwich-like 2D coordination polymer with a porous dimension of ca. 7.5×5.5 Å; complex 2 is a 3D polymer based on tetranuclear heterometallic clusters and the complex 3 is the first trimesate complex containing two different transitional metals. The hydrothermal reactions of H3TMA (or Na3TMA) with metal acetate yield three novel coordination polymers [Cd3(TMA)2(H-PRZ)(H2O)3(OH)]·H2O (1), Cd2Na2(TMA)2(H2O)4 (2) and [Cd2Co(TMA)2(H2O)4]·2H2O (3) (TMA=trimesic acid, PRZ=piperazine). The three Cd(II) centers in 1 are bridged by TMA ligands and a μ3-O atom of coordinated hydroxide to generate a sandwich-liked tri-layer motif. These motifs with a Cd3O core are further interlinked by hydrogen bond interactions to stack in a 3D coordination framework with a porous dimension of ca. 7.5×5.5 Å. Complex 2 is a three-dimensional polymer based on tetranuclear heterometallic clusters. The centrosymmetric tetranuclear heterometallic cluster contains a Cd2Na2 parallelogram cluster core. These clusters are connected through the coordination of carboxylate oxygen atoms of TMA ligands to form a 3D coordination framework. Complex 3 represents the first structural characterization of a trimesate complex containing two different transitional metals. Each TMA3− ligand in the Cd2Co(C9H3O6)2(H2O)4 structure unit of 3 binds to other three structure units, resulting in a 3D coordination polymer. The three complexes exhibit strong fluorescent emission bands at 420 nm (λ ex=314 nm) for complex 1, 424 nm (λ ex=314 nm) for complex 2, and 419 nm (λ ex=308 nm) for complex 3 in the solid state at room temperature. The preliminary magnetic property of complex 3 has been investigated. Keywords Supramolecular chemistry Self-assembly Polymers Transition metal Crystal engineering 1 Introduction The construction of inorganic coordination polymers with unusual electrical, magnetic, optical and catalytic properties is currently considered as one of the most important issues [1–3]. Hydrogen bonding and coordinative metal–ligand interactions are two principal methods for the construction of extended structural coordination polymer solids. The assembly of a wide variety of 1D, 2D and 3D extended porous metal–organic supramolecular polymers exhibiting unusual ion exchange, neutral guest exchange and selective adsorptive behavior from hydrogen bonding interactions has still to reach a new level as a hot subject [4], and yet the construction of extended metal–organic architectures from metal–ligand interactions has been widely studied. For example, some very interesting functional coordination solids with cyclic or porous structures based on metal ions and bridging ligands containing N-donors have been prepared [5–7]. Another approach to novel porous networks involves the reaction of organic ligands containing O-donors such as multicarboxylates with alkaline earths or transition metal ions under hydrothermal conditions [8]. As a building block to construct some porous or cyclic coordination polymer, the trimesic acid (H3TMA) ligand exhibits a variety of coordination fashions and holds the capability of generating coordination architectures of diverse sizes and shapes. Although there have been a lot of reports [9–14] on infinite 1D, 2D and 3D coordination polymers assembled by trimesate, however, so far as we know, most of them contain a single metal atom, whereas those constructed by two different metal atoms and TMA ligands are very rare, with the reported compound [NaCuTMA(H2O)4]·2H2O [10b]. In this paper, we report three novel compounds of metal-trimesate [Cd3(TMA)2(H-PRZ)(H2O)3(OH)]·H2O (1), Cd2Na2(TMA)2(H2O)4 (2) and [Cd2Co(TMA)2(H2O)4]·2H2O (3), measuring their strong fluorescence emissions in the solid state at room temperature, based on diverse coordination architectures. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All analytical grade chemicals and solvents were purchased commercially and used without further purification. 2.2 Preparations 2.2.1 Na3TMA Na3TMA was synthesized according to the chemical reaction equation: H3TMA+3NaOH→Na3TMA+3H2O. 2.2.2 [Cd3(TMA)2(H-PRZ)(H2O)3(OH)]·H2O (1) 0.134 g (0.502 mmol) cadmium(II) acetate dihydrate, 0.106 g H3TMA (0.504 mmol), 0.0493 g (0.254 mmol) piperazine hexahydrate (C4H10N2 ·6H2O) and 12 ml water were loaded into a 23 cm3 Teflon-lined stainless-steel vessel, which was then sealed and placed in a programmable furnace.

Elemental analyses were carried out by an EA1112 CHNS elemental analyzer. Fluorescent data were collected on an Edinburgh FL-FS920 TCSPC system, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was tested under nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using a Perkin–Elmer TGA-7 Thermal Analysis system. The magnetic susceptibility was measured on a SQUID magnetometer. 2.4 Crystal structure determination Crystals of a suitable size for the three title compounds were mounted on glass fibers. Intensity data were collected with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073 Å) and the ω scan mode, using a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID Weissengberg IP diffractometer. The structures were solved by direct methods using shelxs-97 [15] and refined by full-matrix least-squares calculations with shelxl-97 [16]. All non-hydrogen atoms in the three title complexes were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. Most of the hydrogen atoms in the three complexes were located in calculated positions or found from difference Fourier maps. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 A summary of coordination fashions for the TMA ligand As mentioned above, TMA has a great ability to construct different coordination frameworks with metal ions using various coordination fashions. We now summarized fifteen coordination models in Fig. 1 , three (Fig. 1, M–O) of which are discovered first in this work. It is noticeable that one carboxylic group of TMA contains a bridging μ3-O atom in coordination pattern N. 3.2 Structures The crystallographic data of complexes 1, 2 and 3 are given in Table 1 . 3.2.1 [Cd3(TMA)2(H-PRZ)(H2O)3(OH)]·H2O (1) As shown in Fig. 1, L and M, the TMA ligand has two coordination fashions in complex 1. In one fashion (Fig. 1, L), the three carboxylate groups of the TMA ligand bind to metal ions adopting unidentate, bidentate and bridging unidentate patterns. In the other fashion (Fig. 1, M), the three carboxylate groups of the TMA ligand link to metal ions using bidentate and chelating bis-bidentate forms. The local coordination environment of the three Cd(II) centers is described in Fig. 2 . The trinuclear Cd3O core, which is constructed by three Cd(II) centers and a capped μ3-O atom (O16 from a coordinated hydroxide ion), fabricates the principal architecture of complex 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table 2 . Bond lengths of Cd1–O16, Cd2–O16 and Cd3–O16 are 2.263(3), 2.203(3) and 2.303(3) Å, respectively; and distances of Cd⋯Cd separation are 3.3629(4) Å (Cd1⋯Cd2), 3.6612(4) Å (Cd2⋯Cd3) and 4.1762(5) Å (Cd1⋯Cd3). The bond angles of Cd1–O16–Cd3, Cd3–O16–Cd2, Cd2–O16–Cd1 and the interatomic angles of Cd3⋯Cd1⋯Cd2 and Cd1⋯Cd2⋯Cd3 are 132.3(1)°, 108.7(1)°, 97.7(1)°, 56.9(0)° and 72.8(0)°, respectively. The Cd1 atom is coordinated by four oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3A, O12B), a capped μ3-O atom (O16) and a nitrogen atom (N1) from a PRZ molecule, forming a distorted octahedral geometry. The O1 and O2 atoms come from a chelating bidentate carboxylate group (Fig. 1, M) of the first TMA ligand; O3A atom comes from a bidentate carboxylate group (Fig. 1, M) of the second TMA ligand; whereas the atom O12B comes from the bridging unidentate carboxylate group (Fig. 1, L) of the third TMA ligand. Similar to Cd1, besides being coordinated by the capped unitary μ3-O atom (O16), the six-coordinated Cd2 atom is coordinated by three oxygen atoms [O4A and (O5B, O6B)], which come from two different bidentate and chelating bidentate carboxylate groups (Fig. 1, M) of two separate TMA ligands; meanwhile, it is bound to two oxygen atoms (O10A and O12B) from two diverse bidentate and bridging unidentate carboxylate groups (Fig. 1, L) of two separate TMA ligands. The Cd3 atom is also six-coordinated by the capped unitary μ3-O atom (O16), three terminal coordinated water molecules (O13, O14 and O15), as well as two oxygen atoms (O8 and O9A) from two different unidentate and bidentate carboxylate groups (Fig. 1, L) of two separate TMA ligands. The non-coordinated nitrogen atom (N2) of piperazine is protonated. The rudimental building block of compound 1 is constructed by two TMA ligands with two diverse coordination fashions, three Cd(II) centers, a protonated PRZ molecule as well as a capped unitary μ3-O atom (from an hydroxide ion). As shown in Fig. 3 , the rudimental building blocks are interlinked along the ac-plane to yield a sandwich-like tri-layer molecular motif subunit with a porous dimension of ca. 7.5×5.5 Å (based on nuclei separation). These independent 2D sandwich-like sheet subunits are further interconnected by hydrogen bond interactions (Table 3 ) between layers to stack in a 3D coordination framework. 3.2.2 Cd2Na2(TMA)2(H2O)4 (2) Complex 2 is a three-dimensional polymer based on tetranuclear heterometallic clusters. Selected bond lengths and angles in 2 are listed in Table 4 . The coordination fashion of the TMA ligand in 2 is depicted in Fig. 1, N, where the TMA ligand possesses three different carboxylate groups of bidentate, bridging bidentate and chelating/bridging bidentate bonding modes. Different from complex 1, complex 2 contains two diverse metal ions [Cd(II) and Na(I)], which is rare in all coordination polymers of TMA [10b]. Fig. 4(a) reveals the local coordination environment around the Na(I) and Cd(II) centers. The metal atoms (Cd1 and Na1) are in distorted octahedral geometry. The Na1 atom is coordinated by six oxygen atoms (O1, O3C, O6G, O7, O7F and O8), three of which (O1, O3C and O6G) come from a bidentate carboxylate group, a chelating/bridging bidentate carboxylate group and a bridging bidentate carboxylate group (Fig. 1, N) of three separate TMA ligands, respectively; the remaining oxygen atoms (O7, O7F and O8) come from three terminal water molecules. The Cd1 atom is coordinated by six oxygen atoms (O2, O3C, O3H, O4H, O5E and O6I), of which atom O2 comes from a bidentate carboxylate group of TMA; O3C, O3H and O4H come from two chelating/bridging bidentate carboxylate groups of two separate TMA ligands; whereas the O5E and O6I atoms come from two bridging bidentate carboxylate groups of two separate TMA ligands. The tetranuclear heterometallic cluster in complex 2 and its parallelogram Cd2Na2 cluster core are shown in Fig. 4(b). The centrosymmetric tetranuclear cluster is constructed from two Cd atoms (Cd1 and Cd1A, symmetry code A: −x,−y+2,−z), two Na atoms (Na1 and Na1A), eight TMA ligands and four-coordinated water molecules. Two longer Cd–Na edges of 3.826(1) Å (Cd1–Na1 and Cd1A–Na1A) and two shorter Cd–Na edges of 3.642(1) Å (Cd1–Na1A and Cd1A–Na1) construct a parallelogram Cd2Na2 cluster core, angles of Na1A–Cd1–Na1 and Cd1–Na1–Cd1A being 114.99(2)° and 65.01(2)°, respectively. The symmetrical center (0,1,0) is between the two Cd atoms and between the two Na atoms in the tetranuclear cluster Cd2Na2 core. There are two μ3-O atoms from carboxylate groups (O3C and O3H) in the cluster core. These tetranuclear heterometallic clusters are connected through the coordination of carboxylate oxygen atoms of TMA ligands, forming a 3D polymer (Fig. 5 ). A 3D polymer based on tetranuclear heterometallic clusters is rarely found in all known coordination polymers of TMA complexes [10b]. As given in Table 5 , there are several intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the TMA ligands and the coordinated water molecules. 3.2.3 [Cd2Co(TMA)2(H2O)4]·2H2O (3) The selected bond lengths and bond angles of complex 3 are shown in Table 6 . To our knowledge, complex 3 is the first trimesate containing two different transitional metals. As illustrated in Fig. 6 , the coordination sphere in 3, Cd2Co(C9H3O6)2(H2O)4, has a crystallographic symmetry C 2, in which Co1 atom is on the twofold rotation axis 2[010], and two Cd(C9H3O6) groups and four-coordinated water molecules (O7, O8, O7A, and O8A, symmetry code A: 1−x,y,1/2−z) are on the two sides of the axis 2[010]. Each TMA3− ligand in the coordination sphere Cd2Co(C9H3O6)2(H2O)4 bridges to three other coordination spheres, resulting in a 3D coordination polymer (see Fig. 7(a) and (b) ). There is a channel with dimensions of ca. 6.5×6 Å (based on nuclei separation) in the 3D framework, and the Co(II) coordination spheres are located in the 1D channels (see Fig. 7(b)). The coordination fashion of the TMA ligand in 3 is illustrated in Fig. 1, O. The six-coordinated Cd1 and Co1 centers have a distorted octahedral geometry. The Cd1 atom is coordinated by six oxygen atoms from a chelating/bridging bidentate carboxylate group (O1, O2) and four different bidentate carboxylate groups (O3A, O4B, O5C, O6D) of five separate TMA ligands. The Co1 atom is coordinated by six oxygen atoms (O1, O1A, O7, O7A, O8, O8A), two of which (O1 and O1A) come from two different chelating/bridging bidentate carboxylate groups of two separate TMA ligands, the remaining four (O7, O7A O8 and O8A) come from four terminal coordinated water molecules. As shown in Table 7 , there are several intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the O–H group of coordinated water molecules and the carboxylate oxygen atoms. 3.3 Elemental analysis and TGA measurement The elemental analysis data for the three complexes are consistent with the formulas of [Cd3(TMA)2(H-PRZ)(H2O)3(OH)]·H2O (1), Cd2Na2(TMA)2(H2O)4 (2), and [Cd2Co(TMA)2(H2O)4]·2H2O (3). The TGA data of complex 1 indicates two obvious weight losses. The first weight loss starts at ca. 103–151 °C to give a total weight loss of ca. 11.2%, corresponding to loss of one guest H2O molecule and one PRZ molecule per formula unit. The second weight loss starts at ca. 314–462 °C to give a total weight loss of ca. 52.4%, corresponding to loss of 4H2O molecules and two TMA molecules per formula unit, which indicates that the framework of complex 1 is stable. The TGA data of complex 2 shows an obvious weight loss starting at ca. 100–150 °C to give a total loss of ca. 9.5%, corresponding to loss of 4H2O molecules per formula unit. TMA removal starts at ca. 355–492 °C, which suggests that TMA ligands are strongly coordinated with the metal centers to form a stable architecture. Similar to complex 2, the TGA of compound 3 exhibits an obvious weight loss starting at ca. 80–200 °C, to give a total loss of ca. 13.3% which corresponds to loss of 6H2O molecules per formula unit. TMA removal starts at ca. 350–512 °C, which accounts for the framework of 3 being rather stable, too. 3.4 Spectroscopy and fluorescent properties The IR spectra of these complexes show the characteristic bands of the TMA ligand at 1622–1551 cm−1 for the asymmetric vibration ν as(COO−) and at 1441–1367 cm−1 for the symmetric vibration ν s(COO−), and the broad bands of water at 3215–3442 cm−1. In the three complexes, the absence of the expected characteristic bands at 1730–1690 cm−1 attributed to the protonated carboxylate groups accounts for the complete deprotonation of H3TMA ligands in the course of the hydrothermal reactions [17]. For complex 1, the presence of characteristic bands at 1027–997 cm−1 are assigned to absorption vibrations of the PRZ ligand. The emission spectra of complexes 1–3 in the solid state at room temperature are depicted in Fig. 8 . It can be observed that intense emissions occurring at 420 nm (Fig. 8(a), λ ex=314 nm) for 1, 424 nm (Fig. 8(b), λ ex=314 nm) for complex 2, and 419 nm (Fig. 8(c), λ ex=308 nm) for complex 3 are attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) bands. It is worthy of statement that complex 1 exhibits a quenching of the fluorescence with τ=3.47 ns, which suggests that complex 1 may be an excellent candidate for potentially photoactive material. 3.5 Magnetic investigation of complex 3 The magnetic susceptibility of complex 3 was measured in the 5–300 K temperature range and is shown as χ M and χ M T versus T plots in Fig. 9 . The experimental χ M T value of the complex at room temperature is ca. 3.41 emu mol−1 K per Cd2Co unit, indicating significant contributions from the orbital momentum, typical of the Co(II) ion (4 T 1g) in an octahedral field. Upon cooling, the χT value decreases monotonously and reaches 2.09 emu mol−1 K at 5 K. Since the Co(II) ions are well isolated from one another by the TMA ligand and the Cd(II) ions, the magnetic interaction between Co(II) ions should be negligible. The temperature-dependent behavior should be mainly due to the combination of spin-orbit coupling and low-symmetry ligand field effects that cause splitting of the 4 T 1g levels [18,19]. 3.6 Reaction condition dependence of structures As illustrated in Fig. 1, the TMA ligand has a considerable variety of coordination fashions when it reacts with metal ions, and the resulting coordination polymer solids usually possess 1D, 2D or 3D structural characteristics. Yaghi et al. [9c] described that the dimensionality of the resulting coordination framework topology constructed by metal ions and TMA is extremely dependent on the deprotonation level of H3TMA. Another noticeable experimental phenomenon is that different polymer solids constructed by TMA and metal ions are often obtained synchronously in the same reaction vessel under hydrothermal condition, which indicates the mechanisms of those reactions are very complex. Of course, the temperature, crystallisation time, pH value and cooling rate are also important influential factors on the structures of the resulting coordination solids. Revelation of the microscopic reaction mechanisms of H3TMA may lead to new strategies for inorganic synthetic chemistry and design of supramolecular hosts. It has now been demonstrated that the three novel title polymer solids with 3D porous frameworks have been synthesized through hydrothermal reactions of TMA with transition metal ions. The title complexes 2 and 3 contain two different metal centers in the coordination architectures. Similar to zeolitic properties, the TGA data of the three title compounds indicate the backbones of the polymers are very stable. The intense fluorescent emissions show that the title complexes could have roles as potential photoactive materials. The experimental χ M T value of complex 3 at room temperature is ca. 3.41 emu mol−1 K per Cd2Co unit. Upon cooling, the χT value decreases steadily and reaches 2.09 emu mol−1 K at 5 K. 4 Supplementary material Crystallographic data for the structural analysis have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, CCDC Nos. 214205 for compound 1, 214204 for compound 2 and 214203 for compound 3.
