We showed a systematic investigation on the coordination polymers assembled from metal(II) benzoates and bpe ligands. 1-Mn and 5-Zn show ladder-type double chains, 2-Co does a simple linear chain, 3-Ni does a two-dimensional sheet, 4-Cu does a chain containing paddle-wheel dinuclear units, 6-Cd does a thick one-dimensional structure containing newly generated [2+2] addition product 4pycb ligands. In addition, light-induced [2+2] addition reaction occurs for CdII ions, and C=C double bonds that were aligned for photo-induced [2+2] cycloaddition in ZnII ion undergo the photo-induced cycloaddition by UV lamp. Luminescences of compounds 3 and 4 showed strong emissions, while relatively weak luminescences were observed for 1 and 2. Moreover, 4-Cu and 1-Mn have shown efficient catalytic reactivities, while 2-Co, 3-Ni and 6-Cd have displayed a very slow conversion. The reactivities of the compounds used in this study are in the order of 5-Zn>4-Cu>1-Mn>2-Co≫3-Ni>6-Cd. Graphical abstract Four novel MII coordination polymers (M=Mn, Ni, Cu, and Cd) were synthesized, and their structures (including known Co and Zn compounds) were systematically investigated. Moreover, light and photo-induced [2+2] cycloaddition is discussed. Highlights ►The coordination polymers were synthesized from metal(II) benzoates and bpe ligands. ►The light-induced [2+2] addition reaction occurs for CdII ions. ►The C=C double bonds in ZnII and MnII compounds were aligned for photo-induced [2+2] cycloaddition. Keywords 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene [2+2] cycloaddition Coordination polymers Transesterification Coordination polymers are of current interest in the fields of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering [1–5]. The physical properties of coordination polymers mostly depend on the topology of the overall structure of the frameworks [6–13]. One-, two-, and three-dimensional structures of coordination polymers are constructed by self assembly process from metal ions or metal clusters with appropriate organic ligands through coordination bonds [14,15]. Carboxylate-including ligands have been used to form coordination polymers due to their various coordination modes and bridging ability [2], and bipyridyl ligands have been commonly used as two-connecting linear bifunctional spacers [1,2,6,7,14]. In addition, acetate and trifluoroacetate have been efficiently utilized to orient the C=C bonds of trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene (bpe) ligands in ladder coordination polymers for photo-dimerization reactions [15]. In our efforts to investigate the control of the self-assembly of functional supramolecular complexes with intriguing structures and potential applications in catalysis, we have recently carried out a systematic study of zinc metal–organic complexes from the mixed-ligand systems of multifunctional organic ligand benzoate and bridging ligands such as pyrazine, its derivatives [16], and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane [17]. Moreover, the influence of the metal ion effects was also investigated from the reaction of various metal–benzoates with a rigid ligand 4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-bpy) [18] and a bridging flexible ligand 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpa) [19]. Importantly, the assembly process of metal–benzoates and bipyridyl ligands has been highly influenced by solvent system [17], pH [20], metal-to-ligand ratio [17], and the coordination geometry of metal ions [19]. We report here the syntheses, structures, thermal stabilities, and photoluminescence of four novel MII coordination polymers (1-Mn, 3-Ni, 4-Cu, and 6-Cd), and comparison of coordination geometries of metal ions including the previously known compounds 2-Co [12] and 5-Zn [21]. Moreover, light and photo-induced [2+2] cycloaddition is discussed. Various metal benzoates were reacted with 1,2-trans-(4-pyridyl)ethene (bpe) to produce [Mn2(O2CPh)2(μ-O2CPh)2(μ-bpe)2]∙(bpe) 1-Mn, [Ni(O2CPh)2(H2O)(μ-bpe)1.5]∙(OC(CH3)2) 3-Ni, [Cu2(μ-O2CPh)4(μ-bpe)]∙2(CH2Cl2) 4-Cu, and [Cd(O2CPh)2(H2O)(μ-4pycb)0.5]∙[(CH3OH)∙(H2O)] 6-Cd. 1 1 Synthesis of 1-Mn. 35.5mg (0.25mmol) of ammonium benzoate and 22.8mg (0.125mmol) of Mn(NO3)2·H2O were dissolved in 4mL H2O and carefully layered by 4mL methanol solution of trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene ligand (47.0mg, 0.25mmol).

Suitable crystals for X-ray diffraction data were obtained from the direct diffusion technique using two solvent systems (Table 1 and Table S1). All six M(O2CPh) compounds with bpe ligands including previously reported 2-Co and 5-Zn are shown in Scheme 1 . 1-Mn is a 1-D ladder-type polymer containing benzoate-bridged dinuclear unit [Mn2(O2CPh)2(μ-O2CPh)2] connected by bpe ligands (Fig. S1). The coordination geometry around a MnII ion is octahedral. The bridging bpe ligands are aligned parallel with about 3.8Å distances between double bonds. The previously reported 5-Zn [21] is also a 1-D ladder-type polymer similar to the structure of 1-Mn. In a dinuclear unit, two benzoate ligands bridge two Zn(O2CPh)+ ions, and there is an inversion center on the middle of the dinuclear unit (see Scheme 1). The coordination geometry of each ZnII ion is trigonal pyramidal constructed by three carboxylate oxygen atoms in an equatorial plane and two bpe nitrogen atoms in the axial positions. The bridging bpe ligands are parallel aligned with about 3.77Å distances between double bonds. These parallel alignments of double bonds in both 1-Mn and 5-Zn can provide [2+2] photo-cycloaddition. Previously reported 2-Co shows a 1-D linear chain structure containing [Co(O2CPh)2(CH3OH)2] units bridged by bpe ligands [12] (see Scheme 1). Two independent CoII ions provide two different 1-D chains propagated alternatively along the [110] and [1–10] directions. These 1-D polymers form layers, and the 1-D coordination polymers in the adjacent layers display π···π interactions between the centers of the pyridyl rings with a plane-to-plane distance of 3.557–3.618Å. In 3-Ni, [Ni(O2CPh)2(H2O)] units are bridged by bpe ligands to form a parallelogram-like 2-D sheet containing six metal atoms (Fig. S2). The intra-molecular hydrogen bonds between water hydrogen atoms and benzoate oxygen atoms stabilize the octahedral coordination around a NiII ion. 4-Cu is a 1-D linear chain containing paddle-wheel type [Cu2(O2CPh)4] units bridged by bpe ligands (Fig. S3). The Cu…Cu distance is 2.6806(11) Å. There is an inversion center on the middle of Cu…Cu, and the bpe ligands also have a crystallographic inversion symmetry. The coordination geometry around a CuII ion is a tetragonal pyramid constructed by four benzoate oxygen atoms in the plane and a bpe nitrogen atom on the apex position. In 6-Cd, the newly generated ligand 1,2,3,4-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)cyclobutane (4pycb) is obtained, and the 4pycb ligands bridge [Cd(O2CPh)2(H2O)] to form an 1-D polymer (Fig. S4). The benzoate ligands coordinate to CdII ions in an asymmetric chelating mode, and the coordination geometry around a CdII ion is a distorted pentagonal bipyramid constructed by four carboxylate oxygen atoms, a water oxygen atom, and two bpe nitrogen atoms. The 4pycb is newly generated by [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of bpe ligands only for 6-Cd. Among 4 possible regio-isomers [22–27], only rctt isomer was found in 6-Cd. These results indicate that the selection of appropriate metal ions can control the coordination geometry of each metal ion to form different crystal structures. In addition, M(O2CPh) system can help to orient C=C double bonds for [2+2] cycloaddition. For both ladder type coordination polymers 1-Mn and 5-Zn, C=C double bonds of bpe ligands are aligned parallel, and they are ready for [2+2] photo-cycloaddition. Especially for 6-Cd, the [2+2] cycloaddition occurred during the growth of the crystals under the natural light. To monitor the light-induced [2+2] cycloaddition in 6-Cd using NMR spectroscopy, we prepared several tubes containing an aqueous solution of Cd(NO3)2 and ammonium benzoate layered with an ethanol solution of bpe ligands. We isolated crystals from each tube after 10, 20, 50, and 60days, respectively. The 1H NMR spectra clearly revealed the complete photo-conversion (yield: ~100%) of 6-Cd after 60days (Fig. 1 ). A singlet at a lower field (4.66ppm) corresponds to C–H protons of cyclobutane rings with the rctt configuration. The chemical shifts of the remaining signals were consistent with the reported 1H NMR pattern for such an isomer [22–27]. At this stage, it is not clear whether [2+2] cycloaddition reaction occurs by a light-induced solid-state pathway or in the amorphous via light-induced rearrangement in solution. Because the C=C double bonds of bpe ligands are oriented for [2+2] photo-cycloaddition in ladder type coordination polymers 1-Mn and 5-Zn, we also carried out a photochemical reaction of 5-Zn using a UV lamp. Under the UV lamp, approximately 70% rctt products were formed with a 120h irradiation time as shown in Fig. 2 , and the amount of rctt products did not increase with a longer time. Since luminescent compounds are of great current interest due to their various applications in chemical sensors, photochemistry, and electroluminescent display [28], the luminescent properties of compounds 1–4 have been investigated. The luminescent spectra of compounds 1–4 and bpe ligand have been measured in the solid state at room temperature (the emission spectrum of 5-Zn was previously reported). Emissions of compounds 3, 4, and the ligand were observed at 449nm (λex =288nm) for 3, 445nm (λex =287nm) for 4, and 392 and 514nm for the bpe ligand (λex =287nm), while relatively weak luminescences were observed at 530nm (λex =289nm) for 1 and 451nm (λex =289nm) for 2 under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 3 ). Such emissions of complexes 3 and 4 can be tentatively assigned to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and/or ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), because they are red- or blue-shifted compared to the corresponding bpe ligand and ammonium benzoate has no fluorescence [21]. In addition, they might be a good candidate for a potential hybrid inorganic–organic photoactive material, because they showed the intense emissions at room temperature [29]. Transesterification reaction, one of the effective methods for ester synthesis, is important in organic synthesis in industrial as well as in academic laboratories [30–32]. Although there are many catalysts available for transesterification, it requires higher reaction temperature and acidic conditions [33,34]. With a need for new transesterification catalysts effective under mild conditions, therefore, the application of the polymeric compounds as catalysts to transesterification reactions is important and meaningful. Thus, we examined previously the catalytic activity of the polymeric compound 5-Zn for transesterification reactions and reported that the compound 5-Zn catalyzed the transesterification of a variety of esters [21] (1) . In order to compare the reactivity of the complexes containing Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Cd ions, therefore, we have examined the transesterification reaction with the compounds 1–4 and 6. This reaction produced quantitatively the corresponding product methyl acetate within 3–40days, while a control reaction carried out in absence of the complexes showed trace amounts of the conversion of the ester to the product in the same time period. 4-Cu and 1-Mn have shown efficient catalytic reactivities (3 and 5days, respectively), while 2-Co, 3-Ni and 6-Cd have displayed a very slow conversion (10, 39, and 40days). The catalyst 4-Cu also catalyzed the transesterification reactions of 4-nitrophenyl acetate and vinyl acetate within 0.2 and 0.5days, respectively. This result offers the opportunity to use many Cu-containing polymeric compounds reported to date as a potential catalyst for the transesterification reactions. The reactivities of the compounds used in this study are in the order of 5-Zn> 4-Cu> 1-Mn> 2-Co >> 3-Ni> 6-Cd. Based on present and previous results, we suggest that the nature of metals plays an important role to perform the specific reactions [35–42]. Moreover, it is possible to tune the catalytic activities by changing from Zn to those metals such as Cu and Mn. In summary, we showed a systematic investigation on the coordination polymers assembled from metal(II) benzoates and bpe ligands. Their structures show various coordination modes depending on metal ions: a tetragonal pyramidal (five-coordinate) CuII ion, a trigonal-bipyramidal (five-coordinate) ZnII ion, octahedral (six-coordinate) MnII, CoII, and NiII ions, and a pentagonal-bipyramidal (seven-coordinate) CdII ion. 1-Mn and 5-Zn show ladder-type double chains, 2-Co does a simple linear chain, 3-Ni does a two-dimensional sheet, 4-Cu does a chain containing paddle-wheel dinuclear units, 6-Cd does a thick one-dimensional structure containing newly generated [2+2] addition product 4pycb ligands. Since different structures provide different coordination polymers for each metal ion, it is clear that selection of appropriate metal ions can control the structure of coordination polymers. In addition, light-induced [2+2] addition reaction occurs for CdII ions, and C=C double bonds that were aligned for photo-induced [2+2] cycloaddition in ZnII ion undergo the photo-induced cycloaddition by UV lamp. Luminescences of compounds 3 and 4 showed strong emissions, while relatively weak luminescences were observed for 1 and 2. Moreover, 4-Cu and 1-Mn have shown efficient catalytic reactivities, while 2-Co, 3-Ni and 6-Cd have displayed a very slow conversion. The reactivities of the compounds used in this study are in the order of 5-Zn> 4-Cu> 1-Mn> 2-Co>> 3-Ni> 6-Cd.

<p>Supporting Information<br>Experimental Section<br>UV irradiation of 5-Zn<br>15 mg of a crystalline powder of 5-Zn was packed between Pyrex glass slides and irradiated<br>for 120 h using a 100-W Xenon lamp (LAX-Cute).<br>X-ray Crystallography<br>The diffraction data for 1-Mn, 3-Ni, 4-Cu, and 6-Cd were collected on a Bruker SMART<br>AXS diffractometer using Mo K ( = 0.71073 Å). The crystals were mounted on a glass<br>fiber under epoxy. The CCD data were integrated and scaled using a Bruker SAINT, and the<br>structures were solved and refined using SHELXTL. Hydrogen atoms were located in the<br>calculated positions. The selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table S1. The CIF<br>deposition numbers: CCDC 857197 for 1-Mn, 857198 for 3-Ni, 857199 for 4-Cu, and<br>857200 for 6-Cd.<br>17</p>

<p>Fig. S5. TGA result of compound 1-Mn. 1-Mn first lost its three coordinated-bpe ligands<br>between 221 and 350℃; the observed weight loss of 46.1% was consistent with that<br>calculated (47.9%). The second gradual weight loss of 36.1% in the temperature range of<br>350–600℃ corresponds to the loss of four coordinated-benzoate ligands (calcd. 42.5%).<br>23</p>

<p>Fig. S7. TGA result of 3-Ni. 3-Ni underwent a weight loss of 4.0% in the temperature range<br>of 28–124℃ which corresponds to the loss of two coordinated methanol molecules and one<br>coordinated water molecule (calcd. 11.7%). The difference of mass balance suggests that one<br>of the two methanols already dried off during a work-up process. The second weight loss of<br>35.1% from 124 to 353℃ is attributed to the loss of two coordinated benzoate ligands (calcd.<br>37.2%). The third gradual weight loss of 44.3% from 353 to 450 oC is attributed to the loss of<br>1.5 coordinated bpe ligands (calcd. 42.0%).<br>25</p>

The second gradual weight loss of 55.9% from 254 to 800℃ may be<br>attributed to the loss of one coordinated bpe ligand and one benzoate ligand (calcd 55.0%).<br>27</p>

<p>It is advisable to attempt to resolve as many as possible of the alerts in all categories. Often the<br>minor alerts point to easily fixed oversights, errors and omissions in your CIF or refinement<br>strategy, so attention to these fine details can be worthwhile. In order to resolve some of the more<br>serious problems it may be necessary to carry out additional measurements or structure<br>refinements. However, the purpose of your study may justify the reported deviations and the more<br>serious of these should normally be commented upon in the discussion or experimental section of a<br>paper or in the "special_details" fields of the CIF. checkCIF was carefully designed to identify<br>outliers and unusual parameters, but every test has its limitations and alerts that are not important<br>in a particular case may appear. Conversely, the absence of alerts does not guarantee there are no<br>aspects of the results needing attention. It is up to the individual to critically assess their own<br>results and, if necessary, seek expert advice.<br>Publication of your CIF in IUCr journals<br>A basic structural check has been run on your CIF. These basic checks will be run on all CIFs<br>submitted for publication in IUCr journals (Acta Crystallographica, Journal of Applied<br>Crystallography, Journal of Synchrotron Radiation); however, if you intend to submit to Acta<br>Crystallographica Section C or E, you should make sure that full publication checks are run on the<br>final version of your CIF prior to submission.<br>Publication of your CIF in other journals<br>Please refer to the Notes for Authors of the relevant journal for any special instructions relating to<br>CIF submission.<br>PLATON version of 18/07/2011; check.def file version of 04/07/2011</p>
