They all comprise 1D chains that are further interlinked via hydrogen bonds, resulting in the formation of 3D frameworks with channels. Four new coordination polymers, [M(Hiso)(H2O)3] n (M=Co (1); M=Ni (2)) and {[M2(Hiso)2(bipy)2(H2O)4]·2(bipy)} n (M=Co (3); M=Ni (4)) (H2iso=isoorotic acid, bipy=4,4′-bipyridine), were synthesized by hydrothermal reactions and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The four complexes all comprise 1D chains that are further interlinked via hydrogen bonds, resulting in the formation of 3D frameworks. There are small channels in 1 and 2 and two kinds of larger channels in 3 and 4, in which free bipy molecules residue. In 1 and 2, the Hiso2− anions act as tridentate ligands to link metal ions; in 3 and 4, the Hiso2− anions act as bidentate ligands and the metal ions are bridged by bipy. Keywords Isoorotic acid Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes Hydrothermal synthesis Hydrogen bonds Supramolecular frameworks 1 Introduction The rational self-assembly of supramolecular frameworks using noncovalent forces such as hydrogen bonds and π–π stacking interactions is a rapidly expanding field due to their fascinating crystal structures, electronic, optical and magnetic properties, and potential applications [1–5]. Hydrogen bonding, as the strongest and most directional intermolecular force, has been intensively investigated in organic crystalline solids [6–9]. Attempts have been made to combine both metal–ligand coordination bonds and hydrogen bonds in the crystal engineering of porous metal–organic hybrid materials. For example, the construction of a porous solid from hydrogen bonded metal complexes of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid with interesting properties has been achieved by Yaghi, and Munakata has described the design of 3D supramolecular channel-like copper compounds that host a variety of anions by changing the hydrogen-bonding modes and distances [10,11]. This approach provides a means to control the rigidity of a supramolecular framework joined by metal–ligand interactions by selectively incorporating more flexible hydrogen bonds between molecules. This should promote crystalization since hydrogen-bonded structures form reversibly and exhibit slower kinetics for nucleation and growth of crystals than coordination polymers. In this work, we used transition metal ions, 4,4′-bipyridine (bipy) and a multifunctional ligand, namely, isoorotic acid (5-carboxyuracil acid, H3iso) to construct coordination complexes. Bipy is an efficient ligand to link transition metal ions. The choice of H3iso was driven by following factors. First, H3iso possesses multiple coordination sites and can bond to metal ions with versatile coordination modes. Moreover, it can act as a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor. Finally, there are only a few reports on the coordination chemistry of H3iso [12–16]. Hydrothermal synthesis has been employed extensively to obtain single crystals because the properties and the interactions of the reactants are quite different from those under conventional conditions [17–20]. Herein, we report the hydrothermal syntheses and structures of four new complexes [M(Hiso)(H2O)3] n (M=Co (1), Ni (2)) and {[M2(Hiso)2(bipy)2(H2O)4]·2(bipy)} n (M=Co (3), Ni (4)). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and apparatus All reagents were used as received without further purification. The C, H, N microanalyses were carried out with a Vario EL elemental analyzer. The IR spectra were recorded with a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR spectrometer using the KBr pellet technique.

A semi-empirical absorption correction was applied using the sadabs program [21]. The structures were solved by direct methods [22] and refined by full-matrix least squares on F 2 using shelxs-97 and shelxl-97 programs, respectively [22,23]. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All hydrogen atoms were initially located in a difference Fourier map. The O–H distances were then fixed at 0.85 Å and Uiso(H) of the hydrogen atoms of H2O was 1.5 times of Ueq(O) in the next refinement. The crystallographic data for complexes 1–4 are listed in Table 1 , and selected bond lengths (Å) and bond angles (°) in Tables 2 and 3 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Description of the structures Complexes 1 and 2, 3 and 4 are two isomorphous pairs. Because of the different radii of the Co(II) and Ni(II) ions, there are corresponding differences in the distances of M–O and M–N (M=Co or Ni), but only the structures of 1 and 3 will be described in detail. 3.1.1 [Co(Hiso)(H2O)3]n (1) As shown in Fig. 1 , the Co(II) ion is six-coordinated and surrounded by two oxygen atoms from one Hiso2− anion, one nitrogen atom from another Hiso2− anion and three aqua ligands. In this complex the Hiso2− anion acts as a tridentate ligand through O(1), O(3) and N(2). This kind of coordination mode has not been reported before. The bridging Hiso2− anions link the Co(II) ions into infinite polymeric zigzag chains parallel to the c-axis. The Co⋯Co distance in the chain is 7.574 Å (7.488 Å for Ni) and the Co–Co–Co angle is 151.2° (151.5° for Ni). In 1, the amido groups, the carbonyl oxygen atoms, the carboxylate groups and the aqua ligands are all involved in hydrogen bonds. The amido groups and the aqua ligands act as hydrogen bonding donors, while the carboxylate and the carbonyl oxygen atoms act as hydrogen bonding acceptors. There are Ow–H⋯Ow (a), Ow–H⋯Occ (b), Ow–H⋯Ouc (c), Ow–H⋯Oc (d) and N–H⋯Oc (e) hydrogen bonds between the chains (Ow, water molecule oxygen atom; Occ, coordinating carboxyl oxygen atom; Ouc, uncoordinating carboxyl oxygen atom; Oc, uncoordinating carbonyl oxygen atom), resulting in the formation of a 3D-supramoleclar structure (see Fig. 2 ). There are two kinds of channels (A and B) in the structure, but they are too small for any host molecules to reside. The geometry of the hydrogen bonds is shown in Table 4 . There is a weak π–π stacking interaction between the pyramidine rings at a distance of 3.76 Å, which stabilizes the complex. 3.1.2 {[Co2(Hiso)2(bipy)2(H2O)4]·2(bipy)}n (3) There are two kinds of metal coordination environments in 3, as shown in Fig. 3 . Although Co(1) and Co(2) are both six-coordinate and their coordination geometries can be described as distorted octahedrons, the coordination environments around them are different. Co(1) is coordinated by four oxygen atoms belonging to two Hiso2− anions and two nitrogen atoms from two bipy molecules, while Co(2) is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms of bipy and four aqua ligands. Co(1) and Co(2) are in the center of symmetry and are connected by bipy at a separation of 11.365 Å (11.288 Å for Ni). In complex 3, the Hiso2− anion acts as a bidentate ligand through O(1) and O(3). It is worth noting that although N(2) in the Hiso2− anion is deprotonated, it is not coordinated as in 1 and 2 owing to the strong coordination ability of bipy to Co(II) ions. There are two kinds of bipy that have different roles in the structure (see Fig. 3). One kind of bipy bridges Co(II) ions and the dihedral angle of the two pyridine rings of this bipy is 6.1°; while the other kind, with the two pyridine rings being coplanar, is free and does not take part in coordination. As shown in Fig. 4 , the octahedral Co(II) ions are bridged into 1D infinite chains by bipy, and the Hiso2− ligands stay up and down the chains. The uncoordinating carbonyl oxygen atoms and amido groups of Hiso2− ligands form hydrogen bonds with the aqua water molecules of the adjacent chain (Ow–H⋯Oc and Ow–H⋯N hydrogen bond), building a rhomboid-type 2D network. The rhomboid-grid dimensions are about 11.365×9.579 Å (see Fig. 4, 11.288×9.570 Å for Ni). Furthermore, the uncoordinating carboxylate oxygen atoms of Hiso2− ligands also form hydrogen bonds with the aqua water molecules of the adjacent chain (Ow–H⋯Ouc hydrogen bonds), building a similar rhomboid-grid of 11.365×6.348 Å (11.288×6.345 Å for Ni). The 3D supramolecular structure of complex 3 is shown in Fig. 5 . Free bipy molecules residue in the channels. The details of the hydrogen bonds are listed in Table 4. Comparing the structures of 1 and 3, several differences are noted: (1) In complex 1, there is only one kind of metal environment, while in complex 3 there are two. The different coordination environments of Co(II) ions help to form the ordered packing. (2) In complex 1, Hiso2− acts as a tridentate ligand, coordinating through the carboxylate group, carbonyl oxygen and deprotonated amido group; while in complex 3, Hiso2− acts as a bidentate ligand, coordinating through the carboxylate group and carbonyl oxygen, but the amido group is left to form hydrogen bonds. (3) The channels in complex 3 are much larger than those in complex 1. This must be attributed to the introduction of bipy, which acts as a bridging ligand to link the metal ions, leaving Hiso2− anions to form hydrogen bonds and resulting in the formation of large channels. 3.2 Thermal analyses Thermogravimetric analyses of the four complexes were carried out to examine their thermal stabilities. The data for 1–4 are listed in Table 5 . The complexes 1 and 2 lost their aqua ligands at the first weight loss, while 3 and 4 lost their free bipy molecules. Taking 1 and 3 as examples, the TGA curves show that the first weight loss of 18.7% from 206 to 258 °C corresponds to the loss of three aqua water molecules in complex 1 (calcd 18.8%) and the first weight loss of 28.1% from 131 to 219 °C corresponds to the loss of two free bipy molecules in complex 3 (calcd 27.8%). Increasing temperature led to further decomposition of 1 and 3 at 276 and 342 °C. The final pyrolysis was completed at 615 and 537 °C, respectively, giving CoO powder. 4 Supplementary data Crystallographic data for the structural analyses have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, CCDC Nos. 218806, 218807, 234940 and 234939 for 1–4, respectively.
