Graphical abstract Herein we report the coordination chemistry of alkaline-earth metal with the potentially polydentate arenedisulfonates, 4,4′-diamino-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid. The crystal structures of [Mg(dsd)(H2O)4] n (1), {[Ca(dsd)(H2O)2]·H2O} n (2), {[Sr(dsd)(H2O)6]·H2O} n (3) and [Ba(dsd)(H2O)2] n (4) have been determined by X-ray diffraction. The dsd2− anions show three types of coordination modes in 1–4. Highlights ► Four alkaline-earth metal coordination polymers were synthesized using H2dsd. ► Three types of coordination modes of dsd2− were displayed. ► The emission of these complexes are red-shifted and enhanced when compared to ligand. Four novel alkaline-earth metal coordination polymers based on 4,4′-diamino-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid ligand (H2dsd), namely, [Mg(dsd)(H2O)4] n (1), {[Ca(dsd)(H2O)2]·H2O} n (2), {[Sr(dsd)(H2O)6]·H2O} n (3), [Ba(dsd)(H2O)2] n (4), were synthesized under hydrothermal conditions and structurally characterized by elemental analysis, IR, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. These complexes exhibit various polymeric networks due to the diverse coordination modes of dsd2−. Complexes 1 and 3 display a 1D zigzag chain structure with dsd2− group as a μ-bis(monodentate) ligand (denoted as μ2-η1η1 ligand). Complex 2 is a 1D ribbon chain coordination polymer in which dsd2− shows the μ3-η1η2η1 coordination mode, and complex 4 is a 2D coordination polymer in which dsd2− presents the unusual μ4-η1η2η1η1 coordination mode. The present four complexes exhibit different fluorescent emissions in the solid state at room temperature. Keywords 4,4′-Diamino-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid Crystal structure Alkaline-earth metal coordination polymers Luminescent properties 1 Introduction Over the past decades, the design and synthesis of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) built from aromatic multi-acid have attracted great interest, not only for the interesting molecular topologies and crystal packing motifs that they exhibit, but also for the fact that they may possess potential exploitable properties, such as magnetism [1,2], adsorption separation [3–6], gas storage [7–10], catalysis [11–13] and luminescence [14–16]. So far, large numbers of MOFs are constructed and modified by selecting the coordination geometry preferred by the metal ion and the chemical structure of the organic ligand chosen. It has been demonstrated that a series of MOFs are assembled by divalent metals and arenedisulfonates, and they show some unique networks with diverse coordination modes. For instance, several mononuclear and dinuclear cadmium(II) arenedisulfonate complexes with architectures from zero- to two-dimensional have been reported [17]. Moreover, a series of guest-defined metal-complex/disulfonate frameworks containing hydrogen-bonded [Co(en)2(ox)]+ and 2,6-naphtalenedisulfonate have been systematically investigated and elaborately elucidated by Sevov’s group [18]. Coordination and supramolecular network entanglements of organodisulfonates have been discussed by Videnova-Adrabinska Veneta [19]. The diverse guanidinium disulfonate system has been explored extensively by Ward’s group [20]. Many MOFs with direct sulfonate-to-metal coordination have been included in two recent reviews by Shimizu and Fromm [21,22]. Despite the important role that arenedisulfonate coordination polymers may play in MOFs chemistry, the structurally characterized complexes involved in alkaline-earth metal are rare and further research is necessary to enrich and develop this field. 4,4′-Diamino-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid has been widely used in the synthesis of dyes [23], dyestuff intermediate [24], optical brighteners or fluorescent whitening agents [25], polymer gels [26], and sun-care products [27]. Although it has been produced and used for a long time, to the best of our knowledge, studies on crystal structures of the association of the dsd2− anion with metal elements are still seldom [28,29]. In this work, the dsd2− ligand has been chosen on the basis of these considerations: (1) It is a flexible diamino-disulfonate ligand that could serve as a chelating and bridging ligand. (2) The sulfonate groups in dsd2− are weak coordination groups to most metal ions, while their alkaline-earth metal salts have suitable solubility and favor formation of crystals in hydrothermal reactions. (3) The amino groups in dsd2− could improve the solubility and crystallinity of their complexes because of the capacity for hydrogen bonding. (4) The dsd2− is a conjugated compound. Its alkaline-earth metal complexes may exhibit interesting luminescent properties. So we want to elucidate the diverse coordination modes of amino-sulfonate ligand in controlling the crystal structures of alkaline-earth metals arenedisulfonates and provide the family with potential application in photoactive materials. Our research effort has yielded four novel alkaline-earth metal coordination polymers based on this unique disulfonate ligand, namely, 1D coordination polymers [Mg(dsd)(H2O)4] n (1), [Ca(dsd)(H2O)2]·H2O} n (2) and {[Sr(dsd)(H2O)6]·H2O} n (3), as well as 2D coordination polymer [Ba(dsd)(H2O)2] n (4). Four compounds have three-dimensional structures by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and weak π–π stacking interactions, in which the dsd2− ligand displays various coordination modes (Chart 1 ). This work highlights the rich coordination chemistry of H2dsd ligands. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and general procedures All chemicals purchased were of reagent grade or better and were used without further purification. Elemental analyses were performed on a German Elementary Vario EL III instrument. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Magna 750 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400cm−1. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C unit at a heating rate of 10°C/min under flowing nitrogen. Photoluminescence analyses were performed on a Perkin Elemer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer. 2.2 Syntheses of complexes 2.2.1 Synthesis of [Mg(dsd)(H2O)4] n (1) Complex 1 was synthesized from the reaction mixture of 4,4′-diamino-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid (0.370g, 1mmol), Mg(OH)2 (0.058g, 1mmol) and 10mL 90% ethanol solution in a 23mL Parr Teflon-lined autoclave at 150°C for 3days, then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10°C/h. Yellowish crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis were washed by ethanol and dried in air. Yield: 41% based on Mg. Elemental Anal.

Diffractometer was equipped with a graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.71073Å). The intensity data were collected by the narrow-frame method at 293K. The data sets were corrected for Lorentz and polarization factors, as well as for absorption, by the sadabs program or multiscan method [30,31]. All structures were solved by the direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares fitting on F 2 by shelx-97 [32]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. All hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically and refined isotropically. Crystallographic data and structural refinements for complexes 1–4 are summarized in Table 1 , selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2 and H-bonding geometries are summarized in Table 3 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural description of complexes 1–4 All four complexes are readily soluble in water but insoluble in common organic solvents. The presence of the sulfonate groups in 1–4 was definitely confirmed by the strong peaks at 1187, 1082, and 1024cm−1 for 1, 1186, 1085, and 1027cm−1 for 2, 1166, 1082, and 1024cm−1 for 3 and 1178, 1085, and 1028cm−1 for 4 in their IR spectra. Moreover, the strong sharp peaks at 3558–3300cm−1 indicate the existence of amino groups in 1–4. Complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, and it shows a 1D chain structure. In the asymmetric unit of 1, half Mg2+ ion, half dsd2− ligand, and two coordinating water molecules are present. Two aryl units of the centrosymmetric anion are coplanar and conjugation. The E geometric isomer was exclusively found. The coordination geometry around Mg2+ ion is octahedrally coordinated by two sulfonate O atoms from two dsd2− ligands and four O atoms from four water molecules, as shown in Fig. 1 a. The Mg–O distances [2.0620(13)–2.0960(13)Å] are comparable to those in other Mg sulfonates [33]. The dsd2− ligand acts as a μ2-η1η1 ligand [34] and links two Mg2+ ions (Mg1, Mg1C) [Symmetry codes: (C) x −2, y, z −1] by two O atoms of two sulfonate groups. Thus, the coordination mode of dsd2− in 1 corresponds to mode A (Chart 1A). This local molecular disposition extends to generate a 1D zigzag chain along c direction (Fig. 1b). The packing of complex 1 in the crystal lattice is worth mentioning. Each 1D infinite zigzag chain interacts with two neighboring ones via O–H···O hydrogen bonds (O1W···O2, 2.995(3)Å, 154°; O2W···O1, 2.822(2)Å, 168°), and there is some overlap between the symmetrically related phenyl rings C1–C6 whose distance between the ring centroids is 3.89(3)Å (see Table S1), forming extended 2D layer-like structure. Further, the coordination water molecules interact with the amino N atoms from diverse layers via O–H···N hydrogen bonds (O1W···N1, 2.774(2)Å, 170°) (see Table 3), resulting in the formation of a 3D supramolecular network, as depicted in Fig. 1c. Complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c, and it exhibits an inorganic skeleton 1D infinite [CaS2O4] n ribbon chain with 4,4′-diamino-stilbene-2,2′-yl moiety. In complex 2 the asymmetric unit is composed of a neutral mononuclear motif, two coordination water molecules, and one free water molecules. The Ca2+ ion is six-coordinate and is bound by six O atoms from two coordination water molecules and four sulfonate groups in three dsd2− ligands. The resulting coordination polyhedra display distorted octahedral geometries, as shown in Fig. 2 a. The Ca–O distance [2.2965(17)–2.353(2)Å] are comparable to those in other Ca(II) sulfonates [35]. The dsd2− ligand acts as a μ3-η1η2η1 ligand to link three Ca2+ ions (Ca1, Ca1A, Ca1B) [Symmetry codes: (A) −x −1/2, y −1/2, −z −1/2; (B) x, y −1, z], in which the coordination mode of dsd2− corresponds to mode B (Chart 1B), resulting in the formation of a 1D polymeric ribbon chain along b direction (Fig. 2b). The dihedral angle of the two aryl rings in dsd2− ligand is 82.7°. Each 1D infinite chain interacts with two neighboring ones via O–H···N hydrogen bonds (O3W···N2, 2.824(4)Å, 174°), O–H···O hydrogen bonds (O2W···O1, 2.934(3)Å, 151°), and N–H···π interactions between the amino protons and a phenyl ring (N2···π, 3.350(3)Å, 162°, see Table S2), forming extended 2D layer-like structure. Then, the layers superimpose under the directions of N–H···N hydrogen bonds (N1···N1, 3.071(4)Å, 120°, see Table 3), C–H···π interactions between the phenyl proton and another phenyl ring (C5–H5···π, 3.729(3)Å, 156°, see Table S2), as well as π–π stacking interactions with a centroid-to-centroid distance of 3.66(8)Å between phenyl rings of dsd2− ligands (see Table S1), which are ultimately extended into a 3D supramolecular structure, as depicted in Fig. 2c. Compound 3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnma, and it features a zigzag 1D chain structure in which the asymmetric unit contains half a Sr2+ ion, half a dsd2− ligand, two coordinating water molecules, two half-water molecules and half a lattice water molecule. Each Sr center coordinates to two sulfonate O atoms from two dsd2− ligands and six water molecules, in which the four coordinated O atoms (O4W, O1, O1B, O4WB) are located on one square plane while the other four coordinated O atoms (O1W, O2W, O3W, O2WB) are settled in two intersecting planes (O1W, O2W, O2WB and O3W, O2W, O2WB) with 14.508° dihedral angle. So the local coordination geometry around each Sr center in 3 should be preferably described as a slightly distorted square antiprism geometry, as shown in Fig. 3 a. The Sr–O distances [2.501(3)–2.678(3)Å] are comparable to those in other Sr sulfonates [36]. In 3, similar to complex 1, the dsd2− ligand shows the familiar coordination mode A (Chart 1A), which links two Sr2+ ions (Sr1, Sr1A) [Symmetry code: (A) 1− x, 1− y, 1− z] with O1–Sr1–O1B angle of 69.47(8)°, resulting in the formation of a zigzag 1D chain along b-axis (Fig. 3b). As expected, in 3, the dsd2− ligand and the coordination water play a key role in the supramolecular arrangement. Various hydrogen bonds between coordination water molecules and the sulfonate O or amino N atoms can be responsible for the stabilization of crystal packing. It is noted that each 1D infinite zigzag chain interacts with two neighboring ones via O–H···O hydrogen bonds (O2W···O3, 2.912(3)Å, 170°; O3W···O2, 2.809(3)Å, 175°), forming extended 2D undulating layers structure (Fig. 3c and Table 3). Then the layers superimpose under the directions of O–H···N interactions between the coordination water protons and an amino N atom (O2W···N1, 2.884(3)Å, 159°), O–H···O interactions between the coordination water protons and a sulfonate O atom (O1W···O2, 2.991(3)Å, 156°), as well as π-stacking interaction between the symmetrically related phenyl rings C1–C6 whose distance between the ring centroids is 3.86(1)Å (See Table S1), which are ultimately extended into a 3D supramolecular structure (Fig. 3d). Compound 4 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, and it exhibits a 2D polymeric structure in which the local coordination geometry around each Ba2+ ion can also be described as a slightly distorted dodecahedron. In an asymmetric unit of 4, there are one Ba2+ ion, one dsd2− ligand, and two water molecules. As illustrated in Fig. 4 a, The Ba center is coordinated by four sulfonate O atoms from three dsd2− ligands, an amino N atom from one dsd2− ligand, and three aqua molecules. The Ba–O distances (2.6301(18)–2.973(2)Å) and Ba–N distances (2.968(2)Å) are comparable to those reported for other Ba(II) sulfonates [37,38]. As shown in Fig. 4b, complex 4 consists of 2D polymeric planes in which the dsd2− ligand acts as a μ4-η1η2η1η1 ligand and it bridges four Ba centers (Ba1, Ba1A, Ba1B, Ba1C) [Symmetry codes: (A) x, −y +1/2, z +1/2; (B) x, y, z +1; (C) x +1, −y +1/2, z +3/2]. The coordination mode of dsd2− in 4 corresponds to mode C (Chart 1C). Similar to complex 2, the dihedral angle of two benzene rings of dsd2− ligand is 79.7°. As expected, many hydrogen bonds formed from the amino groups and sulfonate groups (N1···O4, 3.073(4)Å, 159°), and C–H···π interactions between the phenyl proton and another phenyl ring (C5–H5···π, 3.710(3)Å, 155°, See Table S2), as well as π-stacking interaction between the symmetrically related phenyl rings C1–C6 whose distance between the ring centroids is 3.90(3)Å (See Table S1), construct the 2D layers to a 3D network, as shown in Fig. 4c. With the exception of the different coordination features in the four framework solids, many O–H···O, N–H···O, O–H···N and N–H···N hydrogen bonds were observed in these crystal structures. Generally, the coordinated water molecules and sulfonate O atoms or amino N atoms are the main part of hydrogen bonded motifs. It should be noted that, the interlayer benzene ring of all the four complexes contribute to bridge the discrete layers to a 3D network with π/π or CH/π weak interactions. For example, in 2 and 4, weak interactions such as π/π and CH/π play important roles in the molecular self-assembling into crystal structures and affect the crystal symmetry. 3.2 Thermal analysis TGA curves of complexes 1 and 3 are similar and each exhibits three main steps of weight loss (Fig. 5 ). The first step (65–250°C for complexes 1 and RT-250°C for complexes 3) corresponds to the release of the water molecules per formula unit. The observed weight losses of 14.9% and 20.1% are close to the calculated values (15.5% and 21.6%). The second step (about 350–470°C) corresponds to the partial decomposition of the two types of organic ligands. The third step (about 470–750°C) overlaps with the second one, during which the complexes are further decomposed. The final residuals are MSO4 (M=Mg2+, Sr2+). The total observed weight losses of 71.5% (for 1) and 68.1% (for 3) are close to the calculated values (74% and 68.4% for complexes 1 and 3, respectively). TGA curves of complexes 2 and 4 are similar and exhibit two main steps of weight losses. The first step (RT-245°C for 2 and 90–145°C for 4) corresponds to the release of aqua ligands and lattice water molecules. The observed weight losses of 11.3% and 6.4% match well with the calculated value (11.7% and 6.6%). The second step (about 280–750°C) correspond to the combustion of the organic ligands. The final residuals are MSO4 (M=Ca2+, Ba2+). The total observed weight losses of 66.8% (for 2) and 56.3% (for 4) are close to the calculated values (70.6% and 56.9% for complexes 2 and 4 respectively). 3.3 Luminescent properties The emission spectra of the free H2dsd and four complexes were investigated in the solid state at room temperature upon excitation at 340nm, as shown in Fig. 6 . The free H2dsd ligand exhibits a broad photoluminescence emission at 386nm which may be due to π∗ →n and π∗ →π transitions. Complexes 1–4 show the strongest peaks at 483, 478, 439, and 428nm, respectively, which may be attributed to the π∗ →π transition. Compared with the free ligand, the emission peak is red-shift about 97nm for 1, 92nm for 2, 53nm for 3, and 42nm for 4. It should be noted that, the red shift reduces gradually from 1 to 4, which is consistent with those of electronegativities of the coordinated metal ions and properties of π-conjugation between the benzene rings within the dsd2− ligands in these complexes. Therefore, the luminescence of compounds 1–4 should originate from the transitions between the energy levels of dsd2− and/or aqua ligand. The shifts of the emission bands are attributed to both the deprotonation of the sulfonic acid and the coordination action of the sulfonate anion or aqua ligand to alkaline-earth metal centers [39,40], as well as the change of the dihedral angles between the benzene rings within the dsd2− ligands in these complexes. 4 Conclusion In summary, four novel alkaline-earth metal coordination polymers have been synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction of alkaline-earth metal ions and H2dsd. Assemblies of four compounds generate two types of frameworks: three one-dimensional chains and one two-dimensional layer network. These diverse structures are largely controlled by the coordination modes of the dsd2− anion and solvents. The dsd2− anions in 1–4 display three types of coordination modes. The coordination spheres of alkaline-earth metal ions in 1–4 are mainly controlled by its ions radius. Intra- or inter-molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and π···π interactions, often contribute to the formation of supramolecular compounds, especially for low-dimensional entities into high-dimensional supramolecular networks, which may also offer us helpful clues to construct unique supramolecular architectures. Diverse structures of complexes 2–3 with lattice water molecules lead to less thermal stability than those of complexes 1 and 4. Both the electronegativities of coordinated metal ions and properties of π-conjugation within the dsd2− ligands in these complexes largely influence the position and strength of emission peaks in 1–4. Hence, the diverse structures lead to different functional properties, which is of great benefit for the design and control of the assembled frameworks for specific usage.

In<br>order to resolve some of the more serious problems it may be necessary to carry out<br>additional measurements or structure refinements. However, the nature of your study may<br>justify the reported deviations from the submission requirements of the journal and these<br>should be commented upon in the discussion or experimental section of a paper - after<br>all, they might represent an interesting feature.<br>If level A alerts remain, which you believe to be justified deviations, and you intend<br>to submit this CIF for publication in Acta Crystallographica Section C or Section E,<br>you should additionally insert an explanation in your CIF using the Validation Reply<br>Form (VRF) below. Your explanation will be considered as part of the review process.</p>
