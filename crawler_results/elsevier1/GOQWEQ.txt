Photocatalytic experiments for these complexes indicate that complex 1 and 2 present extremely good photocatalytic properties and can be rational candidates for the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes pollutants. Three Cd(II) coordination polymers, namely, {[Cd2(bptp)2(H2O)4]·3H2O} n (1), {[Cd2(Hbptp)(BTC)(H2O)]·4H2O} n (2) and {[Cd2(H2bptp)(BTEC)]·H2O} n (3) (1,3,5-H3BTC=1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and H4BTEC=1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid), have been successfully isolated by employing the rigid N-heterocyclic ligand 2,6-bis(3-(pyrid-3-yl)-1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine (H2bptp) and different aromatic polycarboxylates. Complex 1 performs a helical chain structure, which is extended into 3D supermolecular framework due to its strong hydrogen bonding interactions. 2 demonstrates a binodal 3,4-connected 2D grid with the point symbol of (42·62·8)(42·6), while complex 3 features an interesting 2D structure with its 1D double chain looking like a folded paper lantern. The optical band gaps were analyzed by diffuse-reflectance UV–Vis spectra. The photocatalytic experiments for these complexes reflect well on their activities for the decomposition of MB under the irradiation of high-pressure mercury lamp. Complexes 1 and 2 present extremely good photocatalytic properties with their photocatalytic activities increasing from 17% (without any catalyst) to 87% for 1 and 96% for 2 after 2h of irradiation. In addition, the luminescent properties of 1–3 have also been investigated. Keywords N-heterocyclic ligand Aromatic polycarboxylates Helical chain structure Photocatalytic properties Luminescent properties 1 Introduction Over the past few years, the emerging problems of water resources, especially treatment of contaminated water has presented one of the most crucial challenges and been a hot issue worldwide [1]. To date, numerous efforts have been devoted to dealing with wastewater by adopting a variety of conventional approaches, chemical treatments and photocatalytic methods [2,3]. Among them, photocatalysis has been proved to be a convenient and environmentally friendly approach that can efficiently decompose organic dyes in water [4–6]. However, this also raises a question about searching for reasonable materials with significantly good photocatalytic activities. To solve this problem, much work has been focused on the rational design and preparation of photocatalytic materials and a number of coordination complexes have been synthesized and investigated as a new class of photocatalysts for the decomposition of organic dyes in some previous work [7–9]. Moreover, physical and chemical properties of particles have a close relationship with their composition, structure, size, and so on [10,11]. With this understanding, it is anticipated that the rigid N-donor ligand 2,6-bis(3-(pyrid-3-yl)-1,2,4-triazolyl)pyridine (H2bptp) would be a good candidate to facilitate the synthesis of photocatalytically active compounds. The ligand can rotate freely around the central pyridine ring to adopt various conformations and the nitrogen atoms of the heterocyclic rings could directly coordinate with the metal center to generate mirable helical structures [10,12–14]. In addition, the large aromatic system of H2bptp can help to expand the extent of the conjugation, which may contribute to improve the photocatalytic activities of the coordination compounds. Finally, multidentate O-donor organic aromatic carboxylate ligands turn up to be excellent structural constructors owing to their diverse coordination modes to metal ions and the strong coordinating ability of carboxylates [15–20]. In this regard, it may be possible to construct some new classes of coordination polymers as a remarkable type of photocatalytic material through combining the two kinds of precursors. Based on all the above consideration, we have successfully synthesized three new coordination polymers with different structures and dimensionalities, namely {[Cd2(bptp)2(H2O)4]·3H2O} n (1), {[Cd2(Hbptp)(BTC)(H2O)]·4H2O} n (2) and {[Cd2(H2bptp)(BTEC)]·H2O} n (3) (1,3,5-H3BTC=1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and H4BTEC=1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid) by introducing two different aromatic polycarboxylate coligands into the Cd(II)-H2bptp synthesis system. Furthermore, the optical band gaps, photoluminescent and photocatalytic behaviors of complexes 1–3 have also been investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and physical measurements All reagents and solvents were commercially available and used without further purification. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrophotometer from KBr pellets in the range of 400–4000cm−1. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were carried out on a FLASH EA 1112 elemental analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded using Cu Kα1 radiation on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer. Thermal analyses were performed on a Netzsch STA 449C thermal analyzer from room temperature at a heating rate of 10°C/min in air. UV–Vis absorption spectra were put into effect with a TU-1901 double-beam UV–Vis Spectrophotometer. The luminescence spectra for the powdered solid samples were measured at room temperature on a Hitachi 850 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation slit, as well as the emission slit was 2.0nm. Diffuse reflectivity spectra were collected on a finely ground sample with a Cary 500 spectrophotometer equipped with a 110nm diameter integrating sphere, which were measured from 200nm to 800nm using barium sulfate (BaSO4) as a standard with 100% reflectance. 2.2 Preparation of the complexes 2.2.1 Synthesis of {[Cd2(bptp)2(H2O)4]·3H2O} n (1) A mixture of CdCl2·4H2O (22.8mg, 0.1mmol) and H2bptp (36.7mg, 0.1mmol), acetonitrile (1.0mL) and H2O (9.0mL) was sealed into a 25mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container and heated at 170°C for 72h and then slowly cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5°Ch−1. At last, light yellow crystals of 1 were obtained with 55% yield (based on Cd). Anal. Calc. for C38H36N18O7Cd2: C, 42.20; H, 3.35; N, 23.31. Found: C, 42.31; H, 3.41; N, 23.19%.

After the reactor cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5°Ch−1, colorless block crystals of 2 suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained with a yield of 47% (based on Cd). Anal.

Absorption corrections were applied by using a multiscan program. The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The structures of complex 1 and 2 were solved by direct methods and refined with a full-matrix least-squares technique based on F 2 with the shelxl-97 crystallographic software package [21]. For complex 3, the solvent molecules were removed by the squeeze program in PLATON. The final chemical formula was obtained by squeeze results combining with the TGA and elemental analysis. The hydrogen atoms were placed at calculated positions and refined as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters. Crystallographic crystal data and structure processing parameters for 1–3 are summarized in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and bond angles of 1–3 are listed in Table S1 in SI (Supporting Information). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structures of {[Cd2(bptp)2(H2O)4]·3H2O} n (1) Determination of the structure of 1 by X-ray crystallography indicates that complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. The asymmetrical unit of 1 consists of one crystallographic Cd(II) center, one bptp2− ligand, two coordinated water molecules and one and a half lattice water molecules. As exhibited in Fig. 1 a, the Cd(II) ion lies in a slightly distorted octahedral geometry defined by four nitrogen atoms (N3, N5, N8, N9A) of two bptp2− ligands composing the equatorial plane and two oxygen atoms (O1, O2) from two coordinated water molecules at the axial sites. The Cd−O/N bond lengths are 2.354–2.458Å and 2.278–2.341Å, respectively, which are all in the normal range according to previous reports for CdII coordination polymers [22,23]. In completely deprotonated bptp2− ligands, two symmetrical triazole nitrogen atoms (N3, N8) and N5 from central pyridine ring coordinate to one Cd(II) ion, while the terminal pyridine nitrogen atom N9 chelates one other Cd(II) ion. Therefore, the bptp2− bridges the Cd(II) centers to form the left- and right-handed helical chains viewed along the b axis with an identical pitch of 15.285Å, which is corresponding to the length of the b axis (Fig. 1b). Additionally, the 1D chains are connected through the intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the crystal of complex 1 between the coordinated water molecules and the uncoordinated nitrogen atoms of triazole moieties (O1⋯N6=2.903Å, O2⋯N2=2.799Å), thereby resulting in a final 3D supermolecular architecture, as depicted in Fig. 1c. 3.2 Crystal structure of {[Cd2(Hbptp)(BTC)(H2O)]·4H2O} n (2) Complex 2 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P 1 ¯ . It is a 2D coordination polymer with an asymmetric unit that consists of two crystallographically independent Cd(II) ions, one Hbptp− ligand, one BTC3− anion, one coordinated water molecule and four lattice water molecules. As illustrated in Fig. 2 a, Cd1 presents a slightly distorted octahedral environment with three carboxylate oxygen atoms (O5, O6 and O2A) and one nitrogen atom (N7) occupying the equatorial plane as well as one oxygen atom (O2B) and one nitrogen atom (N9A) at the apical site. Unlike Cd1, Cd2 is seven-coordinated, possessing a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry defined by one oxygen atom (O7W) of one coordinated water, three carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1A, O2B, O3B) derived from two BTC3− anions, as well as three nitrogen donors (N1, N5, N6) from one Hbptp− ligand. The Cd–O and Cd–N bond lengths lie in the ranges of 2.269–2.606 and 2.290–2.450Å, respectively, which are in the normal range and well comparable with such complexes [22,23]. Notably, as illustrated in Fig. 2b, three carboxylate groups derived from 1,3,5-BTC3− anions participate in coordination with the Cd(II) ions to produce a 1D double-chain, adopting two different coordination modes: one carboxylate group adopts μ2-η1:η2-bridging mode and the other two adopt monodentate and bidentate chelating modes (Fig. 2b). The H2bptp ligand, which exhibits asymmetrical cis-conformation, connect adjacent Cd(II) ions derived from different double chains to form a charming 2D (4, 4) grid net, as shown in Fig. 2c. From the topological point of view, each pair of Cd(II) ions (Cd1, Cd2) acts as a 4-connected node, the BTC3− anions act as 3-connected nodes and Hbptp− ligands serve as linkers, the whole structure can be described as a (3, 4)-connected network with a point symbol of (42·62·8)(42·6) (Fig. S1). 3.3 Crystal Structure of {[Cd2(H2bptp)(BTEC)]·H2O} n (3) The asymmetric unit of 3 contains two crystallographically independent Cd(II) ions, one H2bptp ligand, one BTEC4− anion and one disordered solvent water molecule modeled by squeeze. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 a, the coordination geometry of Cd1 might be considered as a slightly distorted pentagonal bipyramid that involves five carboxylic oxygen atoms from three BTEC4− anions (Cd−O=2.321–2.631Å) and two nitrogen atoms from two H2bptp ligands (Cd(1)–N(1)=2.301Å and Cd(1)–N(9A)=2.333Å, respectively). However, Cd2 atom is six-coordinated by three oxygen atoms from two BTEC4− anions (Cd−O=2.182–2.609Å) and three nitrogen atoms from one H2bptp (Cd−N=2.313–2.547Å), taking a distorted octahedral geometry. The Cd–O and Cd–N bond lengths are all within the normal distances of those observed in Cd(II)-contained complexes [22,23]. Each BTEC4− ligand connects adjacent Cd(II) atoms to form a 1D polymeric double chain, in which four carboxylate groups of BTEC4− take different coordination fashions: one carboxylate group adopts monodentate chelating mode, two bidentate while the other one adopts μ2-η1:η2-bridging mode. Moreover, two H2bptp ligands coordinate to Cd1 ion and Cd2 ions through the Cd–N coordination interactions to give rise to a 26-membered M4L2 macrocycle (Fig. 3b). Such metallomacrocyclic units are linked by two aforementioned polymeric double chains to further generate an infinite one-dimension chain which looks like a folded paper lantern. Finally, the 1D chains are further connected by an oxygen atom derived from one carboxylate group adopting η2-bridging mode to furnish a 2D framework (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, the adjacent 2D structures are held together by the π–π stacking interactions between the central pyridine rings and its adjoining terminal pyridine rings on both sides (the centroid-to-centroid distance: 3.567Å and 3.544Å, respectively) to afford a 3D supramolecular framework (Fig. 3c). To further understand the structure of the complex, topological analysis was performed on 3. If the two adjacent Cd1 are simplified as a 8-connected node, Cd2 is taken as another independent node, the BTEC4− is considered as a 4-connected node, and the H2bptp ligands are considered as connectors, therefore, the combination of nodes and linkers suggests the framework with a Schläfli symbol of (32·42·52)(32·4·52·6)(34·46·58·67·72·8) (Fig. S2). 3.4 Effect of H2bptp and auxiliary ligands on the structures of the compounds According to the above-mentioned structural descriptions, H2bptp can afford two potential bidentate sites, two monodentate ones, as well as a central tridentate coordination environment in order to generate different conformations and coordination modes (Scheme 1 ). H2bptp may first use the tridentate chelating site when it takes part in the coordination, thereby bringing about a steric hindrance. As a consequence, the pyridyl nitrogen may take precedent over the remaining triazole nitrogen atoms to participate in coordination in order to relieve the steric effect. Therefore, in complex 1, H2bptp coordinates to Cd(II) centers with terminal pyridine rings rotated, producing a helical motif. Besides that, aromatic polycarboxylates also play a significant role in the construction of the multidimensional coordination polymers, due to its diversiform coordination modes. Herein, through varying the geometry shape of the polycarboxylate anions, other structurally different coordination compounds were successfully obtained. In the aforementioned discussion, complex 2 demonstrates that the 1,3,5-BTC3− anions participate in μ1-η1:η1, μ2-η1:η1, and μ2-η1:η2 coordination mode connecting Cd(II) ions to produce a one-dimensional double-chain. The H2bptp ligands bridge these double-chains to obtain a (3, 4)-connected network with the point symbol of (42·62·8)(42·6). In case 3, BTEC4− anions take different coordination fashions of μ1-η0:η1, μ1-η1:η1, μ1-η1:η1 and μ2-η1:η2, respectively, connecting Cd atoms to form 1D infinite chains, which are decorated by M4L2-type macrocycles to give rise to a more interesting 1D chain finally connected by an oxygen atom from one carboxylate group adopting η2-bridging mode to construct a 2D framework. Moreover, weak π⋯π stacking interactions contribute to the formation of a 3D supramolecular framework. 3.5 PXRD studies and thermal analyses In order to confirm the phase purity of these complexes, the PXRD patterns were recorded for complexes 1–3, and they were well comparable to the corresponding simulated ones calculated from the single-crystal diffraction data (Fig. S3 in the Supporting Information), indicating a pure phase of each bulky sample. Thermal analyses were also carried out so as to examine the thermal stability of these complexes (Fig. S4). Complex 1 shows a weight loss of 8.51% from 130 to 200°C, which is resulted from the release of three lattice water molecules and two coordinated water molecules (calcd, 8.32%), and then a plateau phase occurs until the framework starts to collapse at 502°C. For complex 2, the first weight loss of 6.49% in the range of 111–210°C corresponds to the loss of three lattice water molecules (calcd, 6.08%), and the second step weight loss is obtained at about 502°C due to the decomposition of overall framework. The TGA curve of 3 shows preliminary weight loss of 2.32% at 60–145°C, consistent with the loss of the lattice water molecule (calculated, 2.10%), the further weight loss represents the decomposition of the anhydrous compounds. 3.6 Optical band gaps The UV–Vis absorption spectra of the ligands (H2bptp, H3BTC, H4BTEC) and complexes 1–3 were conducted in the crystalline state at room temperature (Fig. S5). The H2bptp ligand exhibits strong absorption bands from 200nm to 340nm with two peaks at 260 and 328nm. Meanwhile, the UV–Vis spectra of the two aromatic polycarboxylates display absorption bands with maxima at 238nm and 295nm for 1,3,5-H3BTC, 243nm and 304nm for 1,2,4,5-H4BTEC, respectively, which can be ascribed to π–π∗ transitions of the ligands. Furthermore, the lowest energy absorption bands in the H2bptp ligand is lower than that of 1,3,5-H3BTC and 1,2,4,5-H4BTEC in the energy level, indicating that it might be more influenced when coordinated with the transition metal ion. With this regard, it’s notable that the lowest energy absorption bands of complexes 1 (λ max =342nm, 29239cm−1), 2 (λ max =330nm, 30303cm−1) and 3 (λ max =334nm, 29940cm−1) are red-shifted at different levels when compared with the corresponding H2bptp ligand (λ max =328nm, 30487cm−1), which may be attributed to the decreased energy gap of the intraligand (IL) transition when coordinated to the metal center ion [24]. The optical band gap (Eg) have been reported to be one of the principal factors to affect the photocatalysis degradation process of the organic dye in previous literature [10,25]. Inspired by this, we explored the band gaps (Eg) of compounds 1–3 through the measurements of diffuse reflectivity for their powder samples. The band gaps (Eg) were determined as the intersection point between the energy axis and the line extrapolated from the linear portion of the adsorption edge in a plot of Kubelka–Munk function F versus energy E (F =(1− R)2/2R) [26–28]. The function was transformed from the recorded diffuse reflectance data, where R is the reflectance of an infinitely thick layer at a given wavelength. As depicted in Fig. S6, the Eg values evaluated from the steep absorption edge for complexes 1–3 are 3.00, 1.58, and 2.81eV, respectively, indicating that compounds 1–3 are potential wide gap semiconductive materials [10,29]. 3.7 Photoluminescence properties Photoluminescence research of coordination polymers with d10 metal centers have attracted increasing attention in recent years [29,30]. Herein, we investigated the solid-state photoluminescence properties of complex 1–3, together with the free H2bptp ligand and the aromatic polycarboxylic acids (H3BTC, H4BTEC) at room temperature. As can be seen in Fig. S7, the emission intensities of H3BTC (λ em =345nm, λ ex =306nm), H4BTEC (λ em =368nm, λ ex =313nm) are much weaker than that of N-donor ligand H2bptp (λ em =523nm, λ ex =371nm), so it is considered that they have no significant contribution to the fluorescent emission of the complexes with the presence of H2bptp. The intense bands of complexes 1–3 were observed at 410nm (λ ex =363nm) for 1, 464nm (λ ex =396nm) for 2, 456nm (λ ex =284nm) for 3, respectively. Notably, the emission bands of 1–3 present significant blue shifts of 110, 59 and 67nm in contrast to those of the free H2bptp. This blue shift may be tentatively ascribed to the metal–ligand coordination interactions [31,32]. From the above discussion, complexes 1–3, which have the same N-donor ligand, show different photoluminescence behavior. The differences between the emission peaks for 1–3 may result from the coordination environments around the central metal ions and the differences in the coordinated modes of H2bptp ligands as well as the aromatic polycarboxylate coligands, which may affect the rigidity of the whole network and further the energy transfer involved in the luminescence [33,34]. 3.8 Photocatalysis To investigate the photocatalytic performances of compounds 1–3 for the photodegradation of organic dyes, methylene blue (MB), which is difficult to degrade in wastewater, was chosen as a representative example in our present work. Typically, 30mg of powder of the title compounds and 0.5mL of 30% H2O2 were dispersed in a 75mLMB aqueous solution (3×10−5 molL−1), then magnetically stirred in the dark for 30min to ensure the establishment of an adsorption/desorption equilibrium of the working solution. The solution was then exposed to the irradiation from a 500W high pressure mercury vapor lamp and kept under continuous stirring. At ca. 20min intervals, 5mL samples were taken out and then analyzed by UV–Vis spectrometer. By contrast, the simple control photocatalysis experiment was also performed under the same conditions without any catalysts. The photocatalytic properties of the crystalline products are shown in Fig. S8 and Fig. 4 . Obviously, the irradiation caused a significant decrease of the absorption with increasing reaction time in the presence of the title compounds in all cases. The major absorption of methylene blue (MB) at about 664nm was selected to supervise the photocatalytic degradation process. Additionally, the concentrations of MB (C/C0) against reaction time (t) of compounds 1–3 were plotted. It can be seen from the calculation results that no more than 17% of MB had been decomposed after 2h of irradiation without any catalyst in the solution. In comparison with that, the systems with photocatalysts have shown much better photocatalytic activities during the dissociation processes (decomposition rate: 87% for 1, 96% for 2, and 32% for 3). These results indicate that compounds 1 and 2 are good candidates for photocatalytic degradation of MB in water, and may have potential photocatalytic application in the reduction of some other organic dyes. As illustrated in previous literature [2], the photocatalytic mechanism can be summarized as follows: electrons (e−) of the complexes in the valence band (VB) would be excited to the conduction band (CB) when under irradiation of high-pressure mercury lamp, retaining the same amount of holes (h+) in VB. After that, the electrons (e−) on the CB or the hole (h+) on the VB combine with O2 or hydroxyl (OH−) absorbed on the surfaces of the complexes respectively to finally form the hydroxyl radicals ( OH). The hydroxyl radicals ( OH) could effectively degenerate organic dye during the photocatalytic process. From above discussion, narrow band gap can contribute to the ease of the charge separation. In general, the photocatalytic decomposition rate of MB should follow the reverse order of band gaps of the complexes. However, it can be clearly seen that the photocatalytic efficiency 2 > 1 ≫ 3, which is not so perfectly agreeable with the reverse order of band gaps 2 < 3 < 1 (3.00eV for 1, 1.58eV for 2, 2.81eV for 3). The smallest band gap among the three compounds allowed 2 a sharp increase in the rate of photocatalytic degradation of the dye contaminant. For complex 1, the band gap of it is close to that of complex 3, while it emerges extremely higher photocatalytic activity than 3. This may be due to their structure discrimination. Complex 1 exhibit a 1D helical chain while 3 demonstrates a 2D layer network. The special construction of 1 may enhance the separation efficiency of the electron–hole pairs in photocatalytic reactions or promote the sorption process of O2/OH−, resulting in a higher photocatalytic activity [33]. The specific reasons about this issue need to be further investigated. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have successfully isolated and characterized three new interesting coordination polymers based on a rigid N-heterocyclic ligand H2bptp and different aromatic polycarboxylate ligands under hydrothermal conditions. The structural variation indicates that the use of organic carboxylic acid is a good strategy for tuning the dimension and increasing the complexity of the coordination complexes. Photocatalytic experiments for the obtained complexes demonstrate that complexes 1 and 2 can be rational candidates for the degradation of organic dyes pollutants, due to their highly active behavior during the decomposition of MB under high-pressure mercury lamp irradiation. Subsequent studies about this issue are underway.
