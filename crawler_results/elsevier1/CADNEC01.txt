Highlights ► The first silver(I) coordination polymer containing azelate ligand was synthesized and structurally characterized. ► The 2D double-layered net is observed in the coordination polymer. ► A discrete water hexamer is perpendicularly located in each hydrophilic cavity of the 2D bilayer. ► Thermal and IR behaviors of the coordination polymer were also discussed. The ultrasonic reaction of Ag2O, bipy and H2aze gave rise to a novel Ag(I) mixed-ligand coordination polymer, namely [Ag(aze)(bipy)]·(H2O)3 (1) (bipy=4,4′-bipyridine, H2aze=azelaic acid). In 1, Ag(I) ions are linked by bipy and aze ligands to form a single two-dimensional (2D) undulated net with a (6,3) topology, incorporating Ag6(bipy)4(aze)2 windows of 22.58×11.06Å based on Ag⋯Ag distances. A pair of identical 2D single nets are interconnected via π⋯π stacking and unsupported Ag⋯Ag interactions to generate a 2D double-layered net. A discrete water hexamer composed of a new planar tetrameric water ring and two pendent water molecules is perpendicularly located in each hydrophilic cavity of the 2D bilayer and acts as a ‘glue’ to assemble adjacent 2D double-layered nets into a three-dimensional (3D) structure.

Considerable attention has been paid to theoretical and experimental studies of small water clusters including decameric [1], octameric [2], hexameric [3], pentameric [4], tetrameric [5] and dimeric [6] found in different solid crystalline hosts, which provided novel structural aspects and insights of water with implications for biological environments. Among the water clusters, water hexamer and tetramer are markedly interesting. The former is considered the smallest subunit to exhibit the properties of bulk water [7] and the latter appears to be the principal species occurring in liquid water, according to a simple two-structure model for liquid water [8]. In a continuation of our efforts to structurally elucidate supramolecular systems containing hydrogen-bonded water clusters [9,10], we now describe here the formation of a well-resolved (H2O)6 cluster inside a two-dimensional (2D) silver(I) mixed-ligand coordination polymer [Ag2(bipy)2(aze)·3H2O] n (1) (bipy=4,4′-bipyridine, H2aze=azelaic acid). The water hexamer can be viewed as either two symmetry-related water trimers doubly interconnected or a combination of a new cyclic tetrameric core and two dangling water molecules. In addition, this study also shows that for the first time, azelate ligand with a longer and more flexible aliphatic chain is introduced into Ag/4,4′-bipyridine system. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and physical measurements All reagents and solvents for synthesis were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. The C, H and N microanalyses were carried out with a CE instruments EA 1110 analyzer. The FT-IR spectrum was recorded from KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400cm−1 on a Nicolet AVATAV FT-IR360 spectrometer. TG curve was performed from 25 to 800°C on a TA5200/MDSC2910 instrument at a heating rate of 5°Cmin−1 under N2 atmosphere. 2.2 Synthesis of [Ag2(bipy)2(aze)·3H2O] n (1) A mixture of Ag2O (116mg, 0.5mmol), bipy·2H2O (194mg, 1mmol) and H2aze (186mg, 1mmol) was stirred in CH3OH–H2O mixed solvent (10mL, v/v: 1/4) under ultrasonic treatment at ambient temperature for 15min. Then, an aqueous NH3 solution (25%) was dropped into the mixture to give a clear solution. The resultant solution was allowed to evaporate slowly in darkness at room temperature for several days to give colorless crystals of 1 (yield, 46%). They were washed with small volumes of cold CH3OH and diethyl ether. Anal. Calcd (%) for C29H36Ag2N4O7: C, 45.33; H, 4.72; N, 7.29. Found: C, 45.42; H, 4.79; N, 7.34.

Data were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID Image Plate single-crystal diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation source (λ =0.71073Å) operating at 50kV and 90mA in ω scan mode for 1. A total of 44×5.00° oscillation images was collected, each being exposed for 5.0min. Absorption correction was applied by correction of symmetry-equivalent reflections using the ABSCOR program [11]. The highest possible space group was chosen. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 [12] and refined on F 2 by full-matrix least-squares procedures with SHELXL-97 [13]. All non-hydrogen atoms were finally refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms of organic ligands were placed in calculated positions and included as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters 1.2 times U eq of the attached C atoms. Hydrogen atoms attached to oxygen were located by difference Fourier maps and then refined subject to the constraint O–H=0.85Å, and U iso(H)=1.2U eq(O). The structure was examined using the Addsym subroutine PLATON [14] to assure that no additional symmetry could be applied to the model. Crystal structure views were obtained using Diamond v3.1f [15]. Crystal data and further information on the structure determination are summarized in Table 1 . Selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in Table 2 . Hydrogen bond geometries are given in Table 3 . 4 Results and discussions 4.1 Synthesis and IR spectrum It is common knowledge that silver complexes are not stable in the light. So the synthesis of 1 was carried out in darkness to avoid photodecomposition and described in the Experimental Section. During the synthesis, precipitates were quickly formed when mixing the reactants. Therefore, ultrasonic treatment under the ammoniacal conditions is used as a synthesis strategy for solving the above problem of precipitates. Ag2O was used instead of AgNO3 or other common silver(I) salts in order to promote the carboxylates instead of small anions to coordinate to the silver(I) centers. Good crystals of 1 for structural data collection can be easily obtained within one week. The reproducibility for present compound is very nice and the formation of 1 is found to be not so sensitive by variations in the molar ratio of organic to metal ions. The resultant crystals are insoluble in water and common organic solvents. The composition of [Ag2(bipy)2(aze)·3H2O] n (1) is first documented from single-crystal X-ray crystallography at low temperature and further confirmed from elemental analysis and IR spectrum. IR spectrum exhibits a broad peak at ∼3430cm−1 attributable to the O–H stretching frequency of the water cluster. For comparison, the O–H stretching vibration in ice appears at 3220cm−1, while in liquid it shifts to 3490cm−1 [16]. Therefore, the O–H stretching frequency of the water cluster in 1 is more close to that of liquid water rather than ice with a slight variation attributable to its surroundings. The peaks around 1606, 1573 and 1413cm−1 for 1 can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate groups. There are no bands in the region 1690–1730cm−1 indicating complete deprotonation of H2aze molecules [17]. 4.2 Crystal structure of [Ag2(bipy)2(aze)·3H2O] n (1) As shown in Fig. 1 , the asymmetric unit of 1 contains two crystallographically independent Ag(I) ions, two bpp ligands, one aze anion and three lattice water molecules. The coordination environments around the two Ag(I) ions are different. The Ag1 coordinated by two N atoms from two different bipy ligands (Ag1–N1=2.175(3) and Ag1–N3=2.190(3)Å) and one oxygen atom from one monatomic bridging COO- group, is located in a T-shaped fashion. The N1–Ag1–N3 bond angle of 158.04(11)° indicates a distortion from linearity, which may be assigned to the coordinative interaction between Ag(I) and carboxylate oxygen atom (Ag1–O1=2.487Å). In addition to the strong coordination bonds, weak Ag⋯O interactions also exist (Ag1⋯O2=2.811(3)Å) which are a little longer but still fall in the secondary bonding range (the sum of van der Waals radii of Ag and O is 3.24Å) [18]. The Ag2 is located in a distorted tetrahedron geometry and coordinated by two bpp [Ag2–N2=2.191(3) and Ag2–N4=2.197(3)Å)] and one chelate aze [Ag2–O3=2.471(3) and Ag2–O4=2.669(3)Å]. Two oxygen atoms from the chelate bridging aze adopt positions resulting in a narrow O–Ag–O angle [50.66(10)°]. The distortion of the tetrahedron can be indicated by the calculated value of the τ 4 parameter introduced by Houser et al. to describe the geometry of a four-coordinate metal system, which is 0.74 for Ag2 [19]. Both Ag–N and Ag–O bond lengths are well matched to those observed in several related species [20]. As illustrated in Fig. 2 a, the Ag(I) ions are linked by bidentate bipy and aze ligands to form a single 2D undulated net incorporating Ag6(bipy)4(aza)2 window of 22.58×11.06Å based on Ag⋯Ag distances, in which aze dianion adopts μ 1:η 1 and μ 1:η 2 coordination modes with a gauche-anti-anti-anti-anti-gauche conformation (four C-atom torsion angles=63.0°, 175.2°, −179.4°, 179.3°, −177.7° and 69.3°) according to the stereochemistry terminology [21]. As demonstrated by a CSD (Cambridge Structure Database) survey with the help of ConQuest Version 1.3 [22], there are only 12 complexes containing aze ligands, of which 4 (33.3%) exhibit the anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti conformation, 2 (16.7%) the gauche-gauche-anti-anti-anti-anti conformation, 3 (25%) the gauche-anti-anti-anti-anti-gauche conformation, 1 (8.3%) the gauche-gauche-anti-anti-anti-anti conformation, 1 (8.3%) the anti-gauche-anti-anti-anti-anti conformation, 1 (8.3%) the gauche-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti conformation, while the complex 1 is the first example of Ag(I) complex which contains aze ligands showing the gauche-anti-anti-anti-anti-gauche conformation. Better insight into the structure of 1 can be achieved by topological analysis. The 2D net could be described as a (6,3) network topology when each silver(I) ion is regarded as a three-connected node, bipy and aze ligands as linear linkers (Fig. 2b), similar to other reported complexes [23]. The most interesting feature of the crystal structure is that although each Ag6(bpp)4(aze)2 window is large enough to allow the insertion of a rod of another window, a pair of identical 2D single nets are not interpenetrated but interacted through unsupported Ag⋯Ag interactions to generate a 2D double-layered net (Fig. 3 ). The corresponding Ag⋯Ag separations ranging from 3.151 to 3.242Å are comparable to those (3.116 and 3.286Å) found in two reported infinite molecular ladders ([Ag(bipy)X], X= MeCO 2 - and H 2 PO 4 - ) [24], indicating the presence of argentophilic interactions [25]. Within each bilayer, adjacent bipy ligands are aligned parallel to give π⋯π stacking interactions: the pyridyl rings of the neighboring bipy ligands are closely stacked with dihedral angles of 4.30 and 16.48°, and the centroid-to-centroid distances range from 3.599 to 3.658Å, indicating there are medium strong π⋯π stacking interactions. Undoubtedly, besides argentophilic interactions, aromatic π⋯π stacking interactions also contribute to the construction of the resulting 2D double-layered net. A discrete water hexamer guest is perpendicularly located in each hydrophilic cavity of the 2D double-layered net, and just like a ‘glue’ agglutinates and supports the host 2D bilayer to form a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular framework by abundant hydrogen bonding interactions between symmetry-related water molecules and symmetry-related carboxylate oxygen atoms from left and right 2D bilayer (O1w⋯O1=2.718(4), O3w⋯O4=2.779(4) and O3w⋯O2ix =2.824(4)Å; symmetry code: ix x +1, y +1, z), respectively, indicating that the water cluster may play a complementary role for stabilizing and strengthening the overall structure of 1 (Fig. 4 a). PLATON [14] calculation indicated that the resulting effective free volume, after removal of encapsulated guest water molecules, was only 10.5% of the crystal volume (154.8Å3 out of the 1472.8Å3 unit cell volume) because of the shorter span of bipy spacer [26]. The average occupied volume of 25.8Å3 for per water molecule within the hydrophilic cavity compares well with the volume of one molecule of water in bulk water (30.0Å3) [27]. The coordination environment of the water hexamer is shown in Fig. 4b. The hexameric water can be structurally viewed either two symmetry-related water trimers doubly interconnected or as a combination of a cyclic tetrameric core and two dangling water molecules. The cyclic water tetramer is found to be formed by the hydrogen bond interactions through O2w and O1wiv and their centrosymmetrically equivalent related atoms to give a planar square geometry, in which each water monomer acts as both single hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. The remaining hydrogen atoms of O1wiv and O2w are 0.60 and 0.06Å below the ring, respectively, while the remaining hydrogen atoms O1wvii and O2wviii are 0.60 and 0.06Å above the ring, respectively. Recall that the remaining hydrogen atom of O2w or O2wviii is almost exactly in the plane, forming a water tetramer structure that is different from those experimentally observed in different crystal hosts [28] (Chart 1 and Table 4 ). The cyclic water tetramer is further hydrogen-bonded to two neighboring free water molecules, O3w and O3wviii, yielding the discrete water hexamer. The average O⋯O distance of 2.82Å found in this (H2O)6 cluster is comparable to one found in liquid water (i.e. 2.85Å) [16] which is also convincingly evident from IR spectrum, and other discrete (H2O)6 clusters [29] which were trapped by various metal–organic matrixes composed of (i) a cyclic hexameric core of diverse conformations [29a,29b], or a cyclic tetrameric core with two pendent water molecules [29c]. The average O⋯O⋯O angle of 115.3° is a deviation of ca. 6° from the ideal tetrahedral angle found in ice I h [30]. (Symmetry codes: (iv) x, y +1, z; (vii) –x +2, −y +2, −z +1; (viii) –x +2, −y +3, −z +1.) The thermal stability of the water clusters was studied by the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of freshly grown air-dried crystals of 1. The first weight loss of 6.35% in the temperature range 30–125°C corresponds to loss of lattice water molecules (calculated 7.03%), subsequently the framework starts to decompose accompanying loss of organic ligands, which indicates the contribution of the water cluster to the stability of the crystal host and the role of cooperative association of the water cluster and the crystal host in the formation of the water cluster [3a,31]. 5 Conclusions In summary, we have synthesized one silver(I) coordination polymer [Ag(aze)(bipy)]·(H2O)3 (1) generated from the mixed-ligand 4,4′-bipyridine and azelate dianion, which features a novel 2D double-layered net constructed by 2D single nets through π⋯π stacking and unsupported Ag⋯Ag interactions. A discrete water hexamer consisting of a new cyclic tetrameric core and two pendent water molecules is perpendicularly located in each hydrophilic cavity of the 2D bilayer. The water cluster serves as a ‘glue’ to reinforce the 2D double-layered net forming an overall 3D structure, which indicates that hydrogen-bonded water clusters can play important roles in stabilizing the crystal host of 1.
