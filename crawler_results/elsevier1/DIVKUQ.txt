A novel three-dimensional (3-D) Dy(III)–Cu(I) heterometallic polymer, [Dy2(pca)2(npa)2(H2O)3](Cu2I2) (1, pca=2-pyrazinecarboxylic acid, npa=1,8- naphthalenedicarboxylic acid), has been synthesized by hydrothermal reactions of Dy2O3, CuI, 2-pyrazinecarboxylic acid, 1,8-naphthalene anhydride in water in the presence of HClO4. Compound 1 has been characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, respectively. The thermal stability and luminescence property of compound 1 have also been studied. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound 1 contains two distinct units of 1-D Dy–carboxyl belt and Cu–I chain. The two types of 1-D units are further linked via pca ligands to give a heterometallic Dy–Cu framework. Graphical abstract A novel three-dimensional (3-D) Dy–Cu heterometallic polymer 1 contains two distinct units of 1-D Dy–carboxyl belt and Cu–I chain. The two types of 1-D units are further linked via pca ligands to give a heterometallic Dy–Cu framework. The two different types of 1-D building units are rarely observed in the reported heterometallic framework. Keywords Hydrothermal Heterometallic Copper(I)–dysprosium(III) Dual ligand The rational design and synthesis of 4f–3d mixed metal compounds has been of great interest during the past decades for their structural diversity and potential applications in fluorescence, gas storage and magnetism [1–5]. Among the reported heterometallic compounds, the molecular chemistry of mixed Ln–Cu systems is of especially great interest since the pioneering work of Bencini and co-workers [6]. Up to now, hetero–Ln–Cu compounds have been well documented and three different types of metal building units have been classified in the existing Ln–Cu coordination polymers: (1) single lanthanide and copper ions [7], (2) heterometallic Ln–Cu clusters [8] and (3) lanthanide clusters and copper clusters [9–14]. However, different types of 1-D building units in heterometallic framework is still rarely observed. Generally, the construction of extended Ln–Cu mixed metal frameworks is rather a challenging task in crystal engineering because of the flexible geometry and high coordination number of Ln3+ ions, as well as the competition between lanthanide and copper ions. The selection of organic ligands is important to incorporate copper and lanthanide ions into the same molecular structure. As is well known, the lanthanide ions as hard acids have high affinity to bond to O-donor atoms, while the transition metal copper ions prefer to coordinate to N-donor atoms. Therefore, the multifunctional bridging ligand with both O and N-donors would be suitable candidates to construct 4f–3d compounds [15–21]. Furthermore, if two different types of ligands are involved in the same reaction system, the cooperativity of both ligands can be used to understand the effect of the ligands on the frameworks and may provide new opportunities for the discovery of interesting structures. Herein, we reported a novel 3-D Dy–Cu coordination polymer, [Dy2(pca)2(npa)2(H2O)3](Cu2I2) (compound 1, pca=2-pyrazinecarboxylic acid, npa=1,8-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid), which contains two distinct units of 1-D Dy–carboxyl belt and Cu–I chain. The two types of units are linked via pca ligands to give a mixed Dy–Cu framework with channels along [100] direction. The channels are partially blocked by the naphthalene rings of npa ligands. The hetero–Dy–Cu compound has been synthesized under mild hydrothermal condition [22]. The crystals of compound 1 are obtained by the reaction of Dy2O3, CuI, 2-pyrazinecarboxylic acid and 1,8-naphthalene anhydride in water in the presence of HClO4 at 140°C for 7days. 1,8-Naphthalene anhydride is generated into 1,8-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid when it encounters with water. The strong and broad absorption bands in the range of 3400–3700cm−1 in IR spectrum of compound 1 are assigned as the characteristic peak of OH vibration. The asymmetrical and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxyl group are fallen in the 1770–1740 and 1580–1430cm−1 regions. The absence of strong bands ranging from 1690 to 1730cm−1 indicates that the ligands are deproponated. Bands in the range of 1010–1390cm−1 are attributed to C–N and C–C vibrations. The O–C–O vibration in plane occurs in strong intensity peaks from 670 to 880cm−1 (Fig. S1). The experimental powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of compound 1 is in good agreement with the simulated PXRD pattern, indicating that the product is phase pure (Fig. S2). Single crystal X-ray diffraction shows that compound 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbca [23]. The asymmetrical unit contains two Dy3+ cations, two Cu+ cations, two I– anions, two deprotonated pca ligands, two deprotonated npa ligands and three coordinated aqua ligands (Fig. 1 ). The two independent pca ligands exhibit one coordination mode (Scheme 1a), which act as tridentate ligands, chelating to one Dy3+ cation and coordinating to a Cu+ cation. Each npa ligand coordinates to four Dy3+ cations through its four oxygen atom of the carboxyl groups (Scheme 1b). Dy1 has eight coordinates and has bicapped trigonal prism coordination environments: two coordinated aqua ligands, four carboxyl O atoms and two N atoms from two pca ligands and two npa ligands (Fig. S3a,b). The coordination environment of the Dy2 cation can be viewed as a capped trigonal prism: six carboxyl O atoms from six npa ligands and one coordinated water molecule (Fig. S3c, d). The Dy–O and the Dy–N bond lengths range between 2.227(8) and 2.633(9) Å (Table S1), and all of them are comparable to related Dy3+ compounds [24]. The connection between Dy3+ and npa ligands gives a 1-D Dy–carboxyl belt (Figs. 2a and S5a). There are two types of Cu+ ions in the structure, and Cu1 and Cu2 are both four-coordinated with a distorted tetrahedral geometry: three I– ions and one N atom from one pca ligand (Fig. S4). The bond lengths of Cu–N and Cu–I range from 2.055(10) to 2.058(10) Å and from 2.628(2) to 2.757(2) Å (Table S1), respectively. These bonds are in good agreement with related compounds in literature [25]. Cu1 and Cu2 ions are bridged by the inorganic μ 3–I to give a zigzag 1-D Cu–I chain via sharing edges (Figs. 2b and S5b). Finally, the connection between the 1-D Dy–carboxyl belts and the inorganic Cu–I chains through pca ligands gives a 3-D heterometallic Dy–Cu compound with channels along [100] direction. These channels are partially blocked by the naphthalene rings of npa ligands (Fig. 2c). It is interesting to note that compound 1 contains two kinds of 1-D building units, namely, Dy–carboxyl belt and Cu–I chain. The two different types of 1-D building units are rarely observed in the reported heterometallic framework. The solid-state luminescent property of compound 1 is investigated at room temperature (Fig. 3 ). Compound 1 does not show typical Dy3+ emissions. Broad luminescence emission bands are observed at 550–700nm (λ max =615nm) for compound 1 when excited at 405nm. According to the results of the similar Cu(I) halide and Dy(III)-Cu(I) halide structures, the emission bands might be assigned to a combination of iodide-to-copper charge transfer and d–s transitions by Cu–Cu interaction within Cu–I chains. There are no emission bands from the Dy3+ ion, indicating that the two kinds of ligands are not good sensitizers to the Dy3+ emission, i.e., they do not sensitize the luminescence of Dy3+ ions [25,26]. The thermal stability of compound 1 is conducted by TG analysis in dry-air atmosphere from 30 to 1000°C at the heating rate of 10°C∙min−1 (Fig. S6). It undergoes two steps of weight loss. The three coordinated water molecules are gradually lost in the temperature range 190–330°C (calculated/found: 3.8/3.4%). From 330 to 520°C, the second weight loss corresponds to the decomposition of organic ligands, the sublimation of iodine and the collapse of the whole framework. The observed weight loss of organic ligands and iodine is lower than the calculated value (calculated/found: 64.7/59.9%). This is because Cu+ ions are oxidized to Cu2+ under the air atmosphere. The residue has a composition of Dy2O3 and CuO, and the observed weight (36.7%) is in agreement with the calculated value (37.3%). In summary, we have successfully obtained a novel 3-D Dy–Cu compound 1 under mild hydrothermal condition that contains two distinct units of 1-D Dy–carboxyl belt and Cu–I chain using dual ligand approach. These two types of 1-D units are linked via pca ligands resulting in a mixed Dy–Cu framework with channels along [100] direction, which are partially blocked by the naphthalene rings of npa ligands. This work enriches the heterometallic coordination chemistry. Further work is in progress to obtain other Ln–Cu–organic compounds by using pca ligand with other smaller auxiliary ligand.
