Solvothermal reactions of CdSO4·8/3H2O with 1,3,5-tris(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (titmb) and HCl in H2O, MeOH or EtOH afforded three coordination complexes [Cd5Cl2(μ-Cl)4(μ3-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(H2O)2(Htitmb)2] n (1), [Cd4Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(MeOH)2(titmb)2] n (2) and [Cd4Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2] (3), respectively. All the compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 1 has a 1D chain in which each centrosymmetric double butterfly-shaped [Cd5Cl2(μ-Cl)4(μ3-Cl)2(H2O)2] unit interlinks with its equivalent ones via two couples of η,η,η-μ3-SO4 anions and two pairs of the Htitmb ligands. Compound 2 consists of one centrosymmetric [Cd5Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(MeOH)4(titmb)2] unit that interconnects with equivalent ones via sharing Cd3 and its symmetry-related ones, forming a 1D zigzag chain. Compound 3 consists of a [Cd4Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2] unit linked by a pair of titmb ligands. The results may provide some insight into solvent effects on the formation of different coordination compounds from the same components. Graphical Abstract Reactions of CdSO4·8/3H2O with 1,3,5-tris(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (titmb) and HCl in 1:1:1 molar ratio in H2O, MeOH or EtOH under solvothermal conditions gave rise to three different coordination complexes [Cd5Cl2(μ-Cl)4(μ3-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(H2O)2(Htitmb)2]n, [Cd4Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(MeOH)2(titmb)2] n and [Cd4Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2], respectively. The three complexes were structurally characterized by elemental analysis, IR, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray crystallography.

Keywords Solvothermal reactions Crystal structures Solvent effects 1,3,5-Tris(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene Cadmium In the past decades, interest in functional coordination compounds is dramatically expanding not only because of their potential applications in fluorescence, nonlinear optics, magnetism, catalysis, and electrical conductivity [1–3], but also due to their intriguing architectures and topologies [1–3]. In order to obtain these materials, the common approach is to use multitopic organic ligands containing pyridyl, pyrazolyl and imidazolyl groups to bind various metals [4–12]. In such an assembly process, some external factors such as solvents [13], pH values [14] and so on [15–17] are all known to play crucial roles in determining the structures of coordination complexes. Among these factors, the structural diversity induced by different solvents in the assembly system is always explored in the reported literatures [13]. However, the formation of three or more different compounds from the same components through solvent effects is less reported [13c,d]. Recently, we have been interested in the synthesis of coordination compounds from metal salts and multitopic N-containing ligands [10–13c,d,14]. In this work, we decided to employ a known polyimidazole ligand 1,3,5-tris(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (titmb). This ligand has been used to react various transition metals to form many interesting coordination compounds [18]. Among them, only four structures of cadmium complexes of this ligand have been reported [18h–k]. One two-dimensional coordination polymer [Cd3(titmb)2(SO4)4(H2O)2(EtOH)2][Cd(H2O)6]·2H2O, which was obtained by layering a solution of CdSO4·8/3H2O with an ethanol solution of titmb at room temperature, attracted our attention and activated us to consider one question: could other compounds be generated from CdSO4·8/3H2O/L in water or other solvents under solvothermal conditions? With this question in mind, we ran the reactions of CdSO4·8/3H2O with titmb and HCl in H2O, MeOH or EtOH and isolated three coordination compounds [Cd5Cl2(μ-Cl)4(μ3-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(H2O)2(Htitmb)2]n (1), [Cd4Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(MeOH)2(titmb)2] n (2) and [Cd4Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2] (3). The isolation of 1–3 showed that solvent effects did work in this system. Herein we report their syntheses, crystal structures and thermal properties. Hydrothermal reaction of a mixture of CdSO4·8/3H2O, titmb and HCl (molar ratio 1:1:1) in water at 150°C in a sealed Pyrex glass tube for 2days afforded colorless blocks of 1 [19]. Similar reactions of the same components with the same molar ratio in the solvents of methanol or ethanol generated colorless crystals of 2 and 3, respectively [19]. As described later in this paper, compounds 1–3 have three different kinds of structures. Solvent structure is a factor determining the products. However, the difference of dielectric constant of the solvents controls the binding of the ligand to Cd2+ in solvents. The binding power of solvents to Cd2+ and the hydrogen network may also play important roles for forming 1–3. The main difference of the three structures is the difference in the degree of polymerization. Water gave the most complicated structure and ethanol had the simplest structure. The results indicate the importance of hydrogen bonding of water molecules that can coordinate to Cd2+ and interact neighboring water molecules or ligands through hydrogen bonding interactions. That property of water gave the complex structure. However, ethanol having low dielectric constant afforded a simple structure and did not interfere the coordination of donor atoms of ligands. Because titmb has low solubility in the three polar solvents, addition of HCl may improve its solubility in these solvents and the resulting chloride may also work as a bridge to link metals in the final products. The final pH values of the three systems are different, 4.0 for 1, 3.2 for 2, and 3.0 for 3. Acidity increased in ethanol or methanol, which leads to protonation of the titmb ligand. But the protonation of the ligand occurred only in water, not methanol or ethanol, which may be due to the strong hydrogen bonding interactions among the water molecules and the protonated titmb (Htitmb) ligands. In addition, the reaction temperature 150°C and the sealed reaction vessel may also be important for the formation of 1–3. Compounds 1–3 are stable towards air and moisture. The elemental analyses were consistent with their chemical formulae. In the IR spectrum of 1, relative to the strong N–H stretching vibration of titmb at 3433cm−1 [20], one medium band of 1 at 3412cm−1 may be considered as the N–H stretching vibration of the protonated imidazol group of Htitmb. In addition, bands at 3630 and 3621cm−1 in the IR spectra of 1 and 2 may be assigned to be the ν(O–H) band of coordinated H2O and MeOH molecules [20,21]. The identities of 1–3 were finally confirmed by X-ray crystallography [22]. Compound 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group Pī, and its asymmetric unit contains half a [Cd5Cl2(μ-Cl)4(μ3-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(H2O)2(Htitmb)2] molecule. As shown in Fig. 1 , this molecule consists of a centrosymmetric double butterfly-shaped [Cd5Cl2(μ-Cl)4(μ3-Cl)2(H2O)2] unit in which two butterfly-shaped [Cd3Cl2(μ-Cl)2(μ3-Cl)(H2O)] fragments are interconnected by sharing Cd2. Each double butterfly-shaped unit is further linked by two pairs of η,η,η-μ3-SO4 anions and two pairs of the Htitmb ligands to form a one-dimensional chain [Cd5Cl2(μ-Cl)4(μ3-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(H2O)2(Htitmb)2]n (extending along the b axis). Both Cd1 and Cd2 have the same octahedron coordination geometry but different coordination spheres. Cd1 is coordinated by one N atom from Htitmb, two Cl atoms, one O atom from a water molecule and two O atoms from SO4 2− anions while Cd2 is coordinated by four μ-Cl and two μ3-Cl atoms. The mean Cd–μ–Cl bond length (2.624(2) Å) is slightly longer than those found in octahedrally-coordinated Cd complexes such as {[Cd(μ-Cl)(4-pya)(H2O)]2·4H2O}n (4-pya= trans-4-pyridylacrylate) (2.5941(7) Å) [23a], [Cd2(μ-Cl)2(H2O)3(L)2] (L=3-triphenylphosphine-propionate, 2.600(2) Å) [23b] and [Cd(μ-Cl)(L)(H2O)]2 (L=2,2′-dipyridylamine, 2.616(3) Å) [23c]. The average Cd–μ3–Cl bond length (2.628(2) Å) is much shorter than that of the corresponding one of [Cd4Cl2(μ 3-Cl)2L4] (2.946(3 Å, L=2-amino-1,1-dimethylethylmercapto) [23d]. The Cd1–O5(H2O) length (2.378(4) Å) is longer than those of {[Cd(μ-Cl)(4-pya)(H2O)]2·4H2O}n (2.282(2) Å) and [Cd2(μ-Cl)2(H2O)3(L)2] (L=3-triphenylphosphine-propionate, 2.279(2) Å), but comparable to that of the corresponding one in [Cd(μ-Cl)(L)(H2O)]2 (L=2,2′-dipyridylamine, 2.407(3) Å). The mean Cd–N and Cd(1)–O(SO4) (2.260(4) Å vs 2.345(3) Å) bond lengths are comparable to those of the corresponding ones in {[Cd(μ-Cl)(4-pya)(H2O)]2·4H2O}n (2.272(2) Å vs 2.370(2) Å). Cd3 adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, coordinated by one N atom, one O atom from SO4 2− anion, one terminal Cl atom, one μ-Cl atom and one μ3-Cl atom. The Cd3–N5A, Cd3–O4 and terminal Cd3–Cl1 bond lengths (2.245(4) Å vs (2.252(3) Å vs 2.4249(18) Å) are shorter than those of the corresponding ones of [Cd2Cl6L2]·2H2O (2.265(3) Å vs 2.698(3) Å vs 2.475(3) Å, L=thiamine) [23e]. The mean Cd–μ–Cl (2.5177(15) Å) bond length is shorter than that of [Ni2Cd2Cl2(2,2′-bipy)4(μ-Cl)6] (2.614(2) Å, 2,2′-bipy=2,2′-bipyridine) [23f]. The Cd–μ3–Cl (2.8252(14) Å) bond length is much longer than that of the corresponding ones of [Cd4Me4(μ3-Cl)2L2] (2.769(3) Å, L=1,3-bis(dimethylamino-2-(dimethylaminomethyl)propan-2-olato) [23g]. It is noted that one imidazolyl group of each titmb ligand was protonated to be Htitmb, which binds two Cd centers via its two N atoms from the rest two imidazolyl groups. This protonated imidazolyl group interacts with one μ-Cl and O atom from the SO4 2− anion to form two intramolecular hydrogen bonds [N3–H3N⋯Cl2 (N3⋯Cl2 3.19Å), N3–H3N⋯O3 (N3⋯O3 3.13Å)]. In addition, each coordinated water molecule also interacts with two O (O3 and O4) of the SO4 2− anion to form another two intramolecular H-bonds [O5–H2W⋯O4 (O5⋯O4 2.93Å) and O5–H1W⋯O3 (O5⋯O3 2.79Å)]. Compound 2 crystallize in the triclinic space group Pī, and its asymmetric unit contains half a [Cd4Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(MeOH)2(titmb)2] molecule. Two Cl atoms (Cl1 and Cl1A) bridge Cd1, Cd1A, and Cd2 to form a [Cd3Cl2(μ-Cl)2] subunit. Such a subunit and another two [Cd(MeOH)2] species are linked by a pair of SO4 2− anions to form a centrosymmetric [Cd5Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(MeOH)4] unit. Two titmb ligands cap this unit above and below by each binding three Cd centers to afford a [Cd5Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(MeOH)4(titmb)2] unit. Such units are further merged into a 1D zigzag [Cd4Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2(MeOH)2(titmb)2] n chain (extending along the c axis) via sharing Cd3 and its symmetry-related ones (Fig. 2 ). In 2, Cd1 atom is tetrahedrally coordinated by one terminal Cl atom, one μ-Cl atom, one N atom from titmb and one O atom from SO4 2− anion. The average Cd–O and Cd–N bond lengths (2.208(3) Å vs 2.193(3) Å) are comparable to those of the corresponding ones of [Cd2(OtBu)2(N(SiMe3)2)2] (2.198(3) Å vs 2.221(3) Å) [24a]. The Cd–Cl and Cd–μ–Cl bond lengths (2.3898(14) Å vs 2.4280(14) Å) are comparable to those of the corresponding ones of [PPh3(Ch2Ph)]2[Cd2Cl4(μ-Cl)2] (2.390(3) Å vs 2.532(3) Å) [24b]. Cd2 and Cd3 are octahedrally coordinated by two μ-Cl atoms, two O atoms from two SO4 2− anions and two N atoms from two titmb ligands (Cd2) or two O from two MeOH molecules, two O atoms from two SO4 2− anions and two N atoms from two titmb ligands (Cd3). The average Cd–μ–Cl bond length (2.7039(12) Å) is longer than that of 1. The terminal Cd–O(MeOH) (2.399(3) Å) and the mean Cd–N and Cd–O bond lengths (2.228(3) Å vs 2.383(3) Å) in 2 are similar to those of the corresponding ones in 1. Compound 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n, and its asymmetric unit contains half a [Cd4Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2] molecule. In 3, one terminal Cl2 binds to Cd2 while the bridging Cl1 links Cd1 and Cd2 to form a [Cd2(μ-Cl)Cl] subunit. Two SO4 2− anions link two [Cd2Cl(μ-Cl)] units to form one planar [Cd4Cl2(μ-Cl)2(η,η,η-μ3-SO4)2] unit. Two titmb ligands cap this unit top and below via each binding three Cd centers to form a centrosymmetric structure (Fig. 3 ). The Cd centers in 3 show two different coordination geometries. Cd1 or Cd1A adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, coordinated by one μ-Cl, two N atoms of the imidazol groups from two titmb ligands, and two O atoms from two SO4 2− anions. The mean Cd1–N bond length (2.212(3) Å) is slightly shorter than that of the corresponding one of 1 while the mean Cd1–O and Cd1–μ–Cl bond lengths (2.552(3) Å vs 2.7575(10) Å) are longer than those of the corresponding ones of 1. Cd2 or Cd2A is tetrahedrally coordinated by one N atom from one titmb ligand, one O atom from SO4 2− anion and one terminal and one bridging Cl atoms. The average Cd–O and Cd2–N bond lengths (2.229(2) Å vs 2.206(3) Å) are comparable to those of the corresponding ones of 2 while the Cd–Cl and Cd–μ–Cl bond lengths (2.4240(11) Å vs 2.4665(12) Å) are longer than those of the corresponding ones of 2. Besides, one weak interaction (2.820(3) Å) between Cd2 and O3 or Cd2A and O3A is observed. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis showed that 1 first lost weight corresponding to two coordinated water molecules (obsd, 2.36%, calcd, 2.00%) from 175 to 195°C. After ca. 340°C, the ligands in 1 started to decompose and the weight of the final residue (35.24%) was assumed to be CdO (calcd, 35.73%). (Fig. S1). 2 got its first weight loss corresponding to one coordinated methanol molecule (obsd, 4.55%, calcd, 4.09%) from 165 to 190°C. It continuously lost weight above 350°C, and the remaining weight corresponds to the formation of CdO (obsd, 32.27%; calcd, 32.75%). 3 is stable up to about 375°C. The final residue was assumed to be CdO (obsd, 34.16%; calcd, 34.14%).
