A cadmium phenylenediacetate isonicotinate network coordination polymer with new topology via in situ amide cleavage Jacob W. Uebler Robert L. LaDuca ⁎ Lyman Briggs College and Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48825, USA ⁎ Corresponding author at: Lyman Briggs College, E-30 Holmes Hall, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48825, USA. Hydrothermal reaction of cadmium nitrate, 1,4-phenylenediacetic acid (H21,4-phda), and 4-pyridylisonicotinate (4-pina) afforded the network coordination polymer [Cd3(1,4-phda)2(isonic)2(H2O)2] n (1, isonic=isonicotinate) via in situ 4-pina amide cleavage. Exotetradentate phda ligands connect cadmium ions into [Cd3(1,4-phda)2(OCO)2(H2O)2] n layer motifs featuring cadmium carboxylate dinuclear clusters. In turn these layers are pillared by isonic ligands into a non-interpenetrated 3-D network with a novel 3,4,6-connected {4.62}2{6482}{426883102} trinodal topology. Performing a similar reaction with zinc nitrate afforded the known 3-D phase [Zn(1,4-phda)] n , which possesses a previously unidentified 4,4,4-connected {4.6382}2{426282}{6284} topology. Thermal decomposition and luminescent properties of 1 are also discussed herein.

Keywords Coordination polymer Cadmium Crystal structure Luminescence Hydrolysis Recent efforts in research towards coordination polymer design and synthesis is driven by these materials' useful applications in hydrogen storage [1], molecular separations [2], ion exchange [3], catalysis [4], second harmonic generation [5], and luminescent sensing [6]. Among the most common ligands employed in the construction of these solids are aromatic dicarboxylates such as terephthalate [7] or isophthalate [8], which provide both the structural backbone and charge balance necessary for the self-assembly of crystalline frameworks. Differences in both metal coordination environments and carboxylate group binding modes provide access to a wide diversity of structural topologies [9]. The absence of crystal field stabilization in d 10 configuration divalent cadmium or zinc ions can cause the specific coordination environment to respond to the geometric, conformational, and steric requirements of the carboxylate ligands during self-assembly [10]. Additionally the dearth of visible light-absorbing d–d electronic transitions in d 10 ions provides the requisite spectral window for visible light fluorescence and molecular detection properties [11]. Inclusion of pyridyl co-ligands can enhance the useful properties of these materials. For instance, the two-fold interpenetrated 3-D phase {[Zn(tere)(4,4′-bipyridine)0.5]•DMF•0.5H2O} n can act as a stationary phase for the gas chromatographic separation of n-pentane from n-hexane [12]. Aromatic dicarboxylates with conformationally flexible acetate moieties, namely phenylenediacetate (phda) ligands, can be utilized in tandem with dipyridyl ligands towards the construction of series of coordination polymers whose topologies vary significantly depending on the geometric disposition of the two pendant arms [13–16]. For example, {[Zn(1,4-phda)(dpa)]•H2O} n (dpa=4,4′-dipyridylamine) shows simple (4,4) ruffled grid-like layers, while {[Zn(1,2-phda)(dpa)]•2H2O} n and [Zn(1,3-phda)(dpa)] n possess four-fold interpenetrated 42638 SrAl2 and 66 diamondoid 3-D networks respectively [13]. {[Cd(1,3-phda)(dpa)(H2O)]•0.5 H2O} n possesses a common (4,4) grid topology but with a rare ABCD stacking pattern [14], revealing an important structural dependence on metal coordination environment. We were thus inspired to attempt the synthesis of cadmium phda coordination polymers containing the 4-pyridylisonicotinamide ligand (4-pina, Scheme 1 ), structurally related to dpa but possessing an additional locus for hydrogen bonding acceptance and a slightly longer girth due to its formyl group. Hydrothermal reaction of cadmium nitrate, 1,4-phenylenediacetic acid, and 4-pina afforded crystals of [Cd3(1,4-phda)2(isonic)2(H2O)2] n (1, isonic=isonicotinate) in modest yield [17]. It is apparent that the 4-pina precursor molecules underwent in situ amide cleavage, resulting in the generation of the isonic ligands. Attempts to prepare compound 1 from the direct hydrothermal reaction of cadmium nitrate, 1,4-phenylenediacetic acid, and isonicotinic acid were unsuccessful; no single crystalline phase could be isolated. Apparently the slower in situ hydrolysis of 4-pina and resulting lower concentrations of isonicotinate during synthesis are crucial for the self-assembly and nucleation of 1. An in situ hydrolysis of 4-cyanopyridine to form isonicotinate was previously reported during the hydrothermal synthesis of the 3-D diamondoid non-linear optical material [Zn(isonic)2] n , presumably through a 4-pyridylformamide intermediate [18]. An attempt to prepare a zinc analog of 1 resulted in the exclusion of 4-pina or isonic ligands, and crystallization of the previously reported 3-D coordination polymer [Zn(1,4-phda)] n [19]. The infrared spectrum of 1 (Fig. S1) showed a broad feature around ~3150cm−1 ascribed to O―H vibrational modes within its aqua ligands. Peaks in the vicinities of ~1538cm−1 and ~1383cm−1 represent the asymmetric and symmetric C―O stretching frequencies of the 1,4-phda and isonic ligands. A cluster of spectral features between 680 and 870cm−1 corresponds to aromatic ring puckering modes within the various ligands. Single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that 1 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic space with an asymmetric unit containing two crystallographically distinct divalent cadmium atoms (one of which, Cd1, lies on an inversion center), one fully deprotonated phda ligand, one isonic ligand, and an aqua ligand (Fig. 1 ). The coordination environment at Cd1 is a {CdO4N2} octahedron with trans isonic pyridyl nitrogen donors, trans aqua ligands, and trans oxygen donor atoms from two 1,4-phda ligands. At Cd2, a slightly distorted {CdO5} square pyramidal environment is evident (τ=0.046 [20]). The basal plane is occupied by trans isonic carboxylate oxygen donors and trans oxygen donor atoms from two 1,4-phda ligands, while the apical site is filled by a carboxylate oxygen donor from a third 1,4-phda ligand. Bond lengths and angles within the two unique coordination environments are given in Table 1 . Carboxylate groups from 1,4-phda ligands bridge in a syn–syn fashion pairs of Cd2 atoms, which are also connected by a pair isonic carboxylate groups, thus forming paddlewheel {(Cd2)2(OCO)4} clusters with a Cd⋯Cd through-space distance of 3.284Å. These are organized into [Cd3(1,4-phda)2(OCO)2(H2O)2] n 2-D layers (Fig. 2 ) via anti-syn 1,4-phda carboxylate groups, which connect the {(Cd2)2(OCO)4} clusters to Cd1 atoms. The Cd1⋯Cd2 through-carboxylate distance is 4.769Å. The pendant acetate arms of the 1,4-phda ligands adopt a twisted anti conformation relative to each other, through the aromatic ring (C―C⋯C―C torsion angle=131.3°). Hydrogen bonding between the aqua ligands on Cd1 and 1,4-phda carboxylate oxygen atoms bound to Cd2 provide an ancillary structural stabilization (Table S1). In turn these [Cd3(1,4-phda)2(OCO)2(H2O)2] n layers are pillared into the full 3-D [Cd3(1,4-phda)2 (isonic)2(H2O)2] n coordination polymer lattice of 1 (Fig. 3 ) by the pyridyl groups of exotridentate μ3:κN:O:O′ isonic ligands. By treating the {(Cd2)2(OCO)4} paddlewheel clusters, Cd1 atoms, and exotetradentate 1,4-phda ligands as connecting nodes, a simplified representation of the underlying 3-D topology of 1 can be generated. The 1,4-phda nodes join one Cd1 node to two {(Cd2)2(OCO)4} cluster nodes in a single layer subunit. Each Cd1 atom connects to two cluster nodes in different layers through isonic ligands, and to two 1,4-phda nodes in the same [Cd3(1,4-phda)2(OCO)2(H2O)2] n layer. Finally, a single {(Cd2)2(OCO)4} cluster connects to four 1,4-phda nodes within a single [Cd3(1,4-phda)2(OCO)2(H2O)2] n layer, and to two Cd1 atom nodes in adjacent layers via isonic linkers. Thus the 1,4-phda nodes are 3-connected, the Cd1 atom nodes are 4-connected, and the paddlewheel cluster nodes are 6-connected. The resulting non-interpenetrated 3-D network of 1 exhibits an unprecedented 3,4,6-connected {4.62}2{6482}{426883102} topology (Fig. 4 ), as determined by TOPOS [21]. This result led us to evaluate the topology of the previously reported phase [Zn(1,4-phda)] n , which was not analyzed by the original authors [19]. This phase manifests Zn ions connected into a 3-D network by crystallographically distinct exotetradentate 1,4-phda ligands in a μ4:κO:O′:O′′:O′′′ binding mode. With the Zn ions and all 1,4-phda ligands treated as 4-connected nodes, a previously unidentified 4,4,4-connected {4.6382}2{426282}{6284} trinodal topology can be invoked in which the Zn nodes are tetrahedrally coordinated and the 1,4-phda nodes are coordinated in a square planar manner (Fig. 5 ). Irradiation of a solid sample of 1 with ultraviolet light (λex =240nm) caused a weak emission of violet light, centered on a λmax of 405nm (Fig. S2). By comparison to other d 10 metal-containing coordination polymers with aromatic ligands, the emissive behavior is best ascribed to π−π* or π− n molecular orbital transitions within the delocalized π systems of the 1,4-phda and isonic ligands [6]. The stability of the new trinodal network of 1 was evaluated by means of thermogravimetric analysis. The mass of 1 remained stable until 180°C, whereupon a mass loss of 24.0% occurred. This mass loss is roughly consistent with the loss of aqua and isonic lignads (27.9% calc'd). An additional 37.0% mass loss at ~390°C matches well with ejection of the 1,4-phda ligands (38.3% calc'd). The mass remnant at 500°C was consistent with a deposition of CdO (36.7% obs'd, 38.2% calc'd). The TGA trace for 1 is depicted in Fig. S3. In conclusion, in situ amide cleavage of 4-pyridylisonicotinamide during hydrothermal treatment with cadmium nitrate and 1,4-phenylenediacetic acid afforded a weakly luminescent cadmium 3-D coordination polymer with a unique and unprecedented 3,4,6-connected trinodal topology. Additional efforts to prepare coordination polymers containing the 4-pyridylisonicotinamide ligand are underway in our laboratory.

Often the<br>minor alerts point to easily fixed oversights, errors and omissions in your CIF or refinement<br>strategy, so attention to these fine details can be worthwhile. In order to resolve some of the more<br>serious problems it may be necessary to carry out additional measurements or structure<br>refinements. However, the purpose of your study may justify the reported deviations and the more<br>serious of these should normally be commented upon in the discussion or experimental section of a<br>paper or in the "special_details" fields of the CIF. checkCIF was carefully designed to identify<br>outliers and unusual parameters, but every test has its limitations and alerts that are not important<br>in a particular case may appear. Conversely, the absence of alerts does not guarantee there are no<br>aspects of the results needing attention. It is up to the individual to critically assess their own<br>results and, if necessary, seek expert advice.<br>Publication of your CIF in IUCr journals<br>A basic structural check has been run on your CIF. These basic checks will be run on all CIFs<br>submitted for publication in IUCr journals (Acta Crystallographica, Journal of Applied<br>Crystallography, Journal of Synchrotron Radiation); however, if you intend to submit to Acta<br>Crystallographica Section C or E, you should make sure that full publication checks are run on the<br>final version of your CIF prior to submission.<br>Publication of your CIF in other journals<br>Please refer to the Notes for Authors of the relevant journal for any special instructions relating to<br>CIF submission.<br>PLATON version of 18/07/2011; check.def file version of 04/07/2011</p>
