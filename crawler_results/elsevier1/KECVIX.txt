Two new 1:2 polymeric complexes of copper (II) azide with 3-ethylpyridine (1) and 4-ethylpyridine (2), have been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods. The structure of complex (1) contains a dimeric [Cu (3-Etpy)2 (N3)2]2 unit and a monomeric [Cu (3-Etpy)2 (N3)2] unit. Each copper atom in the dimeric unit attains a five coordination environment, whereas the copper atom in the second unit has an elongated octahedral geometry. In complex (2), each copper atom in the asymmetric unit is coordinated to the end nitrogens of two μ 2-1,3 azido ligands, a pair of trans 4-Etpy molecules and a nitrogen atom of a terminal azide group. This same nitrogen atom further links a neighboring copper atom at a long Cu–N distance of 2.920 (7) Å, thus connecting the asymmetric units giving rise to a 2D structure. The IR and electronic spectra are reported. Strong absorption bands due to N3 → CuIIMLCT transitions are observed in spectra of solids and solutions of both complexes. Magnetic susceptibility and EPR data of both complexes are presented and discussed.

Thus neutral complexes of copper (II) azide: ligand ratios of 1:1 [1–9], 1:2 [10–14] and 3:2 [15, 16], in addition to [CuL4 (N3)]+ cationic complexes [17] have been synthesized and characterized. In these complexes different types of bonding of azido ligands have been demonstrated. Thus, the 1:2 complexes of 4-picoline, which features oligomeric edge-sharing chains of polyhedra, contains terminal and μ 2-1,1 bridging azido ligands, the corresponding complex of 3-picoline contains both μ 2-1,1 and μ 2-1,3 bridging azides, whereas the 1:2 complex of 3-benzoylpyridine [18]possesses only μ 2-1,3 azido ligands. On the other hand, while the polymeric complex [Cu (N3)2 (DENA)] (DENA=diethylnicotinamide) contains μ 2-1,1 and μ 3-1,1,3 groups, the 3:2 complex of 2-benzoylpyridine possesses μ 2-1,1 and μ 3-1,1,1 bridging azides [16]. These examples demonstrate the versatility of the azide ligand. Moreover, this versatility reflects itself in the variety of magnetic behavior of the metal azido complexes from strong anti-ferromagnetic [19–21] to strong ferromagnetic [22–25] including ferro–antiferromagnetic [26, 27] depending upon the nature of the bridging azido ligand. We now isolated two new complexes of the formula CuL2 (N3)2, where L=3-, and 4-ethylpyridine (hereafter abbreviated as 3-, and 4-Etpy), of related structures. The synthesis and characterization of these complexes as elucidated by X-ray crystallography, spectroscopic and magnetic methods are presented in this paper. 2 Experimental 3-, and 4-ethylpyridine were purchased from Aldrich company and other chemicals were of analytical grade quality. 2.1 Preparation of polymeric [Cu (3-ethylpyridine) 2 (N3)2]n complex (1) Copper (II) nitrate trihydrate (0.72 g, 3 mmol) dissolved in ca. 30 cm3 acetone and 3-Etpy (0.75 g, 7 mmol) were mixed together, followed by addition of an aqueous solution (ca. 5 cm3) of NaN3 (0.52 g, 8 mmol). After filtration of the brown solution mixture, several drops of 3-Etpy were added to prevent the co-precipitation of the 1:1 complex. The final mixture was allowed to stand in an open beaker over ca. three weeks until black well-shaped crystals of the complex were separated along with a blue crystalline material. Yield, 40% with respect to copper. Anal.; Found; C, 46.3; H, 4.9; N, 30.6; Cu, 17.8. Calc.: C, 46.5; H, 5.0; N, 30.9; Cu, 17.6%. 2.2 Preparation of polymeric [Cu (4-ethylpyridine) 2 (N3)2]n complex (2) Copper (II) nitrate trihydrate (0.72 g, 3 mmol) and 4-ethylpyridine (1.07 g, 10 mmol) were mixed together in 40 cm3 acetone. To this mixture, an aqueous solution (ca. 5 cm3) of NaN3 (0.48 g, 7.5 mmol) was added with continuous stirring. The green precipitate was filtered off and then dissolved in DMF, followed by addition of several drops of 4-Etpy. The final mixture was filtered off and the filtrate allowed to stand in an open beaker over several weeks until dark green crystals of the complex deposited. Yield, 50%. Anal.; Found; C, 46.6; H, 5.0; N, 30.0; Cu, 17.4. Calc.: C, 46.5; H, 5.0; N, 30.9; Cu, 17.6%. Caution: both compounds are very sensitive to grinding and explode upon heating and friction. 2.3 Physical measurements The experimental procedures and instruments used for different physical measurements are as described previously [18, 26, 27]. 2.4 X-ray crystal structure analyses A modified STOE four circle diffractometer was used for single crystal X-ray measurements. Orientation matrix and lattice parameters were obtained by least-squares refinement of the diffraction data from 40 (compound 1) and 65 (compound 2) reflections in the 2θ range 10–32°. Data were collected at 293 (2) K using graphite crystal monochromatized Mo–Kα radiation (λ=0.71069 Å) and the ω-scan technique. The intensities were corrected for Lorentz-polarization effects, for absorption and also for intensity decay (intensities of two standard reflections dropped continuously during data collection by 19% and 9%, respectively). Crystallographic data and processing parameters are given in Table 1 . The structures were solved by direct methods and subsequent Fourier analyses. Anisotropic displacement parameters were applied to non-hydrogen atoms in full-matrix least-squares refinements based on F 2. The hydrogen atoms were assigned with isotropic displacement factors and included in the final refinement cycles by use of geometrical restraints. Analytical expressions of neutral-atom scattering factors were employed, and anomalous dispersion corrections were incorporated. The program DIFABS [28], and the SHELXTL⧹PC [29] program package were used for computations. Selected bond distances and bond angles are given in Table 2 Table 3 . Supplementary data consisting of fractional atomic coordinates, displacement parameters, observed and calculated structure factors and complete lists of bond distances and bond angles have been deposited, CCDC deposition numbers 101853 and 101854. 3 Results and discussion 3-ethylpyridine as well as 4-ethylpyridine interact with the copper (II) ions in presence of azide ions producing complexes of general formula CuL2 (N3)2. In case of 3-Etpy, crystals of the 1:2 azide complex were co-precipitated with blue crystals of a 1:2 nitrate complex. The sizes of both types of crystals are sufficient to separate them from each other after filtration and dryness. Both azide complexes are insoluble in non-polar solvents, e.g. benzene, carbontetrachloride, etc., and some polar solvents, e.g. methyl alcohol, chloroform and water. They are slightly soluble in acetone and ethanol but soluble in DMF and DMSO, giving non-conducting solutions. The colors of these complexes change to brown immediately in the last two solvents. 3.1 Structures Fig. 1 Fig. 2 illustrate the principle structural features of complex (1), for which selected bond distances and bond angles are collected in Table 2. The structure contains two different subunits; [Cu (3-Etpy)2 (N3)2]2 (I) and [Cu (3-Etpy)2 (N3)2] (II). Each copper atom in the dimeric unit (I) is coordinated by pairs of trans 3-Etpy molecules, terminal azido groups [N(21)–N(22)–N(23) and N(21a)–N(22a)–N(23a)] and nitrogen atoms of μ 3-1,1,3 bridging azido ligands [N(11)–N(12)–N(13) and N(11a)–N(12a)–N(13a)]. Thus each copper atom is pentacoordinated by four short Cu–N distances [from 1.981 (4) to 2.030 (3) Å] and a fifth long Cu–N bond length of 2.409 (3) Å, adopting a distorted square pyramidal geometry with N(11) at the apical site. The metal center, Cu (2), in unit (II), which is located at an inversion center, binds two azido ligands [N(31)–N(32)–N(33) and N(31b)–N(32b)–N(33b)], two 3-Etpy molecules and the other end nitrogen of the two μ 3-1,1,3 azido ligands at a long Cu–N distances of 2.658 (3) Å, giving rise to a (2+2+2) elongated distorted octahedral geometry. The distances between copper atoms of the two units, Cu (2). . .Cu (1) and Cu (2). . .Cu (1a) are 5.979 (2) and 6.459 (2) Å, respectively. The terminal azide groups [N(31)–N(32)–N(33) and N(31b)–N(32b)–N(33b)] from unit (II) have very long distances of 3.509 (4) Å, between the other end nitrogen atoms and copper atoms of neighboring dimeric units on both sides. The Cu. . .Cu distance of 3.323 (1) Å within the Cu2N2 ring of the dimeric unit (I) is longer than corresponding values [3.120 (2) and 3.071 (2) Å] found in the structure of [Cu (pyridine–N–oxide) (N3)2]n [14], shorter than that reported for [Cu (3-pic)2 (N3)2]n of 3.546 (2) Å [12], but comparable with that found [3.326 (2) Å] in the structure of [Cu (3-acetylpyridine)2 (N3)2]n [14]. Fig. 3 is a perspective drawing showing the principle structural features of complex (2) along with the atom labelling scheme. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are collected in Table 3. The coordination polyhedron around copper atoms may be described as (4+1+1) with four short bonds with N(1) and N(2) from 4-Etpy molecules and N(11) and N(21) from two azido ligands [Cu–N, av=2.0 Å] and nitrogen atom N(13a) of asymmetric μ 2-1,3 azido group which occupies an apical position at a long Cu–N distance of 2.658 (3) Å. Such tetragonal pyramids are connected to zig-zag chains. N(21) further links the former chains of polyhedra at a very long distance, Cu (1)–N(21a)=2.920 (7) Å. Thus azido ligand N(21)–N(22)–N(23) behaves as μ 2-1,1 bridging group and asymmetric di-μ 2-1,1 of such azides form Cu2N2 cyclic rings giving rise to sheets of poyhedra (Fig. 4 ). Although the structure of complex (2) differs from that of complex (1), steric and packing effects are operative and cause the connection of the chains of tetragonal polyhedra through such very long Cu–N distances giving rise to a two-dimensional structure. The structures of the title complexes (1) and (2) are closely related to those of diazido-2,2′-bipyridine copper (II) [30] and [ (2-aminoethyl)pyridine]copper (II) azide [1]. In the former the copper is described as being square-planar with two additional long bonds [Cu–N: 2.682 and 2.680 Å] leading, through semi-coordination, to polymerization in the x direction. In the latter, the coordination geometry around the copper atom is distorted from square planar by a tetrahedral twist of 28°. The copper coordination polyhedron is completed by short interactions, both above and below the mean plane, to the bonded azide nitrogen atoms of adjacent molecules related by the c-glide symmetry [Cu–N: 2.88 and 2.66 Å]. Long Cu–N distances are also observed in the linear systems: Cu (4-pic)2 (N3)2 [Cu–N: 2.52 (2)–2.79 (2) Å] [10]; [Cu (DENA) (N3)2] [2.755 (5) and 2.841 (5) Å] [4, 5]; Cu (3-pic)2 (N3)2 [Cu–N: 2.625–2.679 Å] [12]; Cu (3,4-lut) (N3)2 [Cu–N: 2.638 (3) Å] [15]; both modifications of Cu (py)2 (N3)2 [Cu–N: 2.50–2.76 Å] [31, 32]; Cu (NH3)2 (N3)2 [Cu–N: 2.56 (1) and 2.67 (1) Å] [33]; KCu (picolinato) (N3)2]n [Cu–N: 2.649 (4) Å] [34] and copper azido complex with tridentate ligand 1- (imidazol-4-yl)-2- (2-pyridylmethylene)-amino)-ethane [Cu–N: 2.797 and 2.804 Å] [35].Sheets of polyhedra are formed in case of copper complexes with the (3-aminopropyl)oxamidato ligand [Cu–N: 2.564 (3) and 2.859 (4) Å] [36] and [Cu2 (bpym) (N3)4] (bpym=2,2′-bipyrimidine) [Cu–N: 2.480 (2) and 2.743 (3) Å] [37], whereas Cu–N distances of 2.60 (2) and 2.70 (2) Å are observed in Cu (N3)2 [38] and a long Cu–N distance of 2.627 (6) Å in the 3:2 complex with 2-benzoylpyridine [16]. In case of the three copper azido complexes with tridentate ligand 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane dimeric units are formed by taking into account Cu–N distances from 2.709 to 2.944 Å [21]. 3.2 IR spectra X-ray structure determination showed complex (1) to have three asymmetric azides with δd values of 0.047, 0.033 and 0.028 Å, and complex (2) to contain two asymmetric azido ligands with δd values of 0.044 and 0.041 Å. While the number of ν asN3 bands are two (Table 4 ) as expected in case of complex (2), the appearance of only one ν asN3 sharp band is unexpected for complex (1). However, this result is not unusual. For example, the IR spectrum of Cu (pyridine)2 (N3)2, with two asymmetric azido groups showed only one ν as band at 2040 cm−1 [32]. For complex (2) the positions of the ν asN3 absorption bands are not consistent with the δd verses ν asN3 relationship given earlier [39, 40] which suggests two bands around 2040 cm−1. It is possible that some coincidence of the vibrations related to the azides with such very close δd values leads to some sort of resonance or configuration interactions. It is noteworthy to mention that the markedly strong band usually appeared around 1285 cm−1 associated with ν sN3 in copper (II) azido complexes containing one ore more di-μ 2-1,1 bridging azido systems [4–7], is not observed in the IR spectra of both complexes (1) and (2). Instead, a weak to medium band appears around 1284–1289 cm−1. 3.3 Electronic spectra The electronic spectra of the title complexes, 1 and 2, measured as Nujol mulls are given in Table 5 . These spectra exhibit d–d transitions as a broad band centered around 14700 and 15350 cm−1, for 1 and 2, respectively, suggesting a distorted six-coordinate copper (II) environment [41, 42] for both complexes. The spectra of these complexes also show at least three strong bands in the ranges 33000–22000 cm−1 and 31000–18400 cm−1, for 1 and 2, respectively. These bands are due to N3→CuII LMCT transitions. While two and four azide-to-copper charge transfer transitions have been predicted [43] for terminal and μ 2-1,1 or μ 2-1,3 bridging azido ligands in copper (II) complexes, respectively, only one feature is observed for terminal copper (II) azide monomers and two bands are reported for μ 2-1,3 or μ 2-1,1 dimers [36]. The present structure with terminal azides, μ 3-1,1,3 and μ 2-1,1 or μ 2-1,3 azides show at least three N3→CuII LMCT bands. In DMF and DMSO both complexes show a very strong band in the range 25250–24000 cm−1 due to N3→CuII CT transitions, in addition to the d–d absorption around 14000 cm−1 for DMF and 13000 cm−1 for DMSO. Thus these complexes in DMF and DMSO show only one LMCT absorption band and the d–d transition is shifted to lower wave numbers. The change of color of these complexes in both solvents from green to brown could be associated with a partial reduction of Cu (II) to Cu (I) leading to mixed-valence compounds which are well known to exhibit such brownish color. In EtOH, however, complex 2 retains its identity as suggested by its color and the position of the d–d absorption band at 14880 cm−1, a little lower value than of the solid sample. 3.4 Magnetic properties χ M T verses T plot, (referred to the three coppers molecular weight), of compound 1 and the χ M T verses T plot ( for two copper atoms), of compound 2 are shown in Fig. 5 . For 1, the χ M T plot shows a practically constant value close to 1.2 cm3·K·mol−1 in the temperature range 300–25 K, decreasing slightly at low temperature. The 4 K value reaches 0.93 cm3·K·mol−1. This magnetic behavior indicates a very weak overall antiferromagnetic interaction. Compound 2 shows a room temperature χ M T value of 0.86 cm3·K·mol−1, which increases up to 0.94 cm3·K·mol−1 at 20 K, decreasing slightly at lower temperatures, indicating a dominating weak ferromagnetic interaction in the 300–20 K temperature range and a weak antiferromagnetic coupling at low temperature. From the structural data, the two compounds show the azide bridges between equatorial-apical sites of square pyramidal or octahedral copper (II) environments. The unpaired electronic density is then largely localized in the xy plane, and all interactions involving the non-active d 2z atomic orbital should be very weak or even negligible. Compound 1 shows the unusual μ 3-1,1,3 azide bridges between each three copper atoms unit, for which two interactions of opposite sign may be expected: the double μ 2-1,1 bridges between Cu (1)–Cu (1a) may afford ferromagnetic coupling, whereas for the end-to-end bridges between Cu (1)⧹Cu (1a) and Cu (2) antiferromagnetic coupling may be expected. Moreover, all the azide bridges involve at least one axial coordination site of the corresponding copper environments: N(11) acts as a bridge between an equatorial Cu (1) and an axial Cu (1a) sites, as occurs for the Cu (1)–N(11)–N(12)–N(13)···Cu (2), whereas the interaction trough Cu (1a)···N(11)–N(12)–N(13)···Cu (2) involves two large axial sites. From these data, the magnetic behavior of the compound 1 may be reasonably assumed as very weak ferro–antiferro competing interactions which allows to an apparently non-coupled system, with a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction, evidenced at low temperature. Due to the small decay at low temperature, try to evaluate the J values of this system has no sense, and only the qualitative discussion of the observed properties was made. For compound 2, the interaction provided by the end-to-end bridge should be quasi-negligible due to the very large Cu (1)–N(13b)–N(12b) bond angle of 172.7 (6)°, according to previous MO calculations [26, 27]. Experimental magnetic data have been fitted as a dimeric CuCu ferromagnetic entity including a z J parameter to evaluate the weak antiferro–magnetic interactions [44], S=1⧹2 systems. The best fit parameters, referred to the Hamiltonian H=−JS 1 S 2 were J=−12.4 (5) cm−1, g=2.137 and J′=−0.37 (3) cm−1. 3.5 EPR spectra The X-band EPR spectra of solid samples of both complexes at room temperature consist of the typical axial copper (II) signals, with g par.=2.19, g perp.=2.07 for 1 and g par.=2.17, g perp.=2.09 for 2. Absence of half-field signals for the two compounds reinforced the assumption of very weak superexchange interactions.
