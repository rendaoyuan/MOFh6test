Baudron,*a Guillaume Rogezb and Mir Wais Hosseini*a While the numerous reported Ni(II) dipyrrin complexes are discrete species, derivatives bearing peripheral pyridyl or imidazolyl groups self-assemble into coordination networks. As reported with Cd(II) salts, reaction of the dipyrrin ligand functionalized with a 4-pyridyl moiety with Ni(OAc)2 affords a 2D coordination polymer in which the Ni(II) cation, in an octahedral environment, is bound to two dipyrrinato chelates and two pyridyl groups, in cis arrangement, belonging to neighbouring complexes. In the crystal, the layers are homochiral with a consecutive DLDL stacking. Interestingly, analogous reaction with the derivative bearing a peripheral phenyl-4-pyridyl unit forms a similar 2D organization, yet expanded owing to the presence of the phenyl spacer. In this case, the formation of homochiral sheets is also observed, however with a single enantiomer of the complex in the crystal. Furthermore, whereas a distorted 2D coordination polymer is obtained with the novel dipyrrin ligand appended with a phenyl-3-pyridyl group, a 3D coordination polymer is formed with the slightly more flexible derivative bearing an imidazolyl moiety. Introduction Known since the 1920s,1 dipyrrins2 (dpm, Scheme 1) have been used, especially over the past decade, as tectons3 for the formation of homo- and hetero-metallic crystalline discrete and infinite architectures.4–9 In particular, derivatives bearing a peripheral binding unit at position 5 (Scheme 1) have been investigated as ligands with an emphasis on the sequential formation of heterometallic MOFs.4,5 Regarding dpm-based homometallic infinite architectures, they result from self- assembly of metallatectons3 appended at their periphery by either a hydrogen bonding donor–acceptor group7 or a coordinating site.5c–e,8,9 In the latter case, the metal center must offer additional available binding sites to promote the formation of coordination polymers. Most of the examples of such compounds are based on (acacR)Cu(dpm) species (acacR = functionalized acetylacetonate ligands) (Fig. 1a) where the metal center is bound to the peripheral coordinating group of a neighboring complex, in addition to the dpm and acacR chelates.5,8 Recently, our group has reported that complexes of the Cd(dpm)2 type self-assemble to form luminescent 1-, 2- and 3-D coordination polymers, representing a novel class of dpm- based MOFs (Fig. 1b).9 For these species, based on pyridyl- or imidazolyl-appended dpm ligands (1 and 4, Scheme 1), the Cd(II) cations are bound to two dpm chelates as well as to the peripheral coordinating groups of neighbouring complexes. This strategy therefore relies on the ability of the metal cation to adopt a coordination number higher than four thus also allowing its binding to other ligands in addition to the dpms. It is worth noting that all M(dpm)2 complexes (M = Co(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), Pd(II)) reported to date are discrete species and do not feature the propensity to self-assemble into MOFs.2,4–8,10 Indeed, for the widely investigated Ni(dpm)2 complexes, the metal centre shows a coordination number of four with only few exceptions of dpm derivatives bearing carbonyl groups in aLaboratoire de Tectonique Mole´culaire, UMR UdS-CNRS 7140, Universite´ de Strasbourg, F-67000, Strasbourg, France.

View Article Online View Journal | View Issue positions 1 and/or 9.7d,g,10 In the course of our search for novel metallatectons useable for the preparation of M’MOFs5 and after our investigations on Cd(II)-based architectures,9 we have found that the reaction of pyridyl-appended ligand 1 with Ni(OAc)2?4H2O in a CHCl3/MeOH (1/1) mixture led to an insoluble compound. This suggested the formation of a coordination polymer following the self-assembly strategy presented in Fig. 1b. The preparation of homometallic MOFs based on Ni(dpm)2 complexes was thus further investigated using ligands appended with either a pyridyl group (1–3) or an imidazolyl unit 4 (Scheme 1). Ligands 1 and 4, already shown to form self-assembled MOFs with Cd(II) salts,9 ligand 2 and the novel derivative 3 incorporating a phenyl spacer and either a 4- or 3-pyridyl group respectively were chosen in order to investigate the possible effect of the distance between the two binding units and of the nature of the positional isomer of the pyridine. Results and discussion Ligands 1, 2 and 4 were prepared as described,4d,5c,7f whereas the novel dipyrrin 3 was synthesized in 45% overall yield (Scheme 2a) upon reaction of 4-(3-pyridyl)benzaldehyde, 5, with pyrrole to afford dipyrromethane 6 which was subse- quently oxidized with DDQ. Reactions of these derivatives with either Ni(OAc)2?4H2O or Ni(BF4)2?6H2O salts led to the formation of complexes 7–10 respectively in 73 to 93% yield (Scheme 2b). It is worth noting that only compounds 8 and 9 were sparingly soluble in CHCl3 and thus were characterized, whereas complexes 7 and 10, hardly soluble in common organic solvents, could not be studied in solution. Crystals of compound 7 were obtained by slow diffusion of a MeOH solution of Ni(OAc)2?4H2O in a DMF solution of dpm 1. It crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group with a complex on a two-fold axis. The Ni(II) center, in an octahedral environment, is coordinated to two dpm chelates and two pyridyl groups in a cis arrangement, albeit with a tilted orientation (Fig. 2a). Two-dimensional sheets are thus formed. It is worth noting that, within one layer, only one enantiomer, D or L, is present with an alternate DLDL stacking of the homochiral sheets, as observed for the Cd(II) analogue.9 Crystals of (D-8)(CHCl3)2(Et2O) were obtained by slow diffusion of Et2O vapor in a CHCl3 solution of the compound. This solvate crystallizes in the chiral trigonal P3221 space group with one complex, two CHCl3 molecules and one Et2O molecule on two-fold axes. Here again, the Ni(II) cation is in an octahedral coordination environment with two pyridyl units in Scheme 2 Synthetic route for the preparation of ligand 3 (a) and Ni(dpm)2 complexes 7–10 (b).

View Article Online cis positions leading again to a 2D arrangement similar to 7 (Fig. 2b), yet expanded owing to the presence of the phenyl spacer in ligand 2. Such an expansion has been reported for a heterometallic M’MOF.4c Interestingly, in the analyzed crystal, only the D enantiomer of the complex was found. The sheets stack to form channels occupied by solvent molecules. The solvent accessible void, as calculated by PLATON, amounts to 40.7% of the unit cell volume.11 In both structures, the Ni– Ndpm bond lengths (average = 2.051 Å) are shorter than the Ni– Npy distances (2.242 Å), in agreement with reported structures of (porphyrin)Ni(pyridine)2.12 The analogue 9, bearing a peripheral phenyl-3-pyridyl group, crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/n space group with a complex and a CHCl3 molecule in general position. The same coordination environment is observed around the Ni(II) center, albeit with one Ni–Npy distance being much longer (2.462(2) Å), leading to ruffled 2D sheets. As for 7, within one layer, only one enantiomer, D or L, is present with an alternate DLDL stacking of the consecutive homochiral sheets (Fig. 2c). Unlike for the structure of (D-8)(CHCl3)2(Et2O), no channels are observed for (9)(CHCl3) and the solvent accessible void represents only 16.5% of the unit cell volume.11 Network 10, prepared as for 7, crystallized as a DMF and MeOH solvate, (10)2(DMF)3(MeOH)2, in the monoclinic Cc space group with one complex and one DMF molecule in general position, as well as a DMF molecule and two MeOH molecules disordered over the same site. The Ni(II) cation is coordinated to two dpm chelates and two cis imidazolyl groups of neighbouring complexes leading to the formation of a 3D network comprising both D and L enantiomers (Fig. 3). It can be described as a 4-connected net of the cds type (ESI3). The Ni–Ndpm bond distance ranges between 2.0726(14) and 2.0971(17) Å while the longer Ni–Nimid distance is between 2.1918(14) and 2.2417(17) Å, in agreement with reported (porphyrin)Ni(imidazole)2 species.13 An isomorphous network has been obtained with the Cd(II) analogue, where disordered DMSO molecules occupied the pores.9 The solvent accessible void represents 31.8% of the unit cell volume, as determined using PLATON.11 X-ray powder diffraction studies on all four crystalline materials revealed pure phases for 7, (D-8)(CHCl3)2(Et2O), and (10)2(DMF)3(MeOH)2, whereas, for (9)(CHCl3), traces of an unidentified phase were also observed (ESI3). Thermo-gravi- metric analyses (Fig. 4) performed on compounds (9)(CHCl3) and (10)2(DMF)3(MeOH)2 indicated a weight loss of 15.0 and 16.2% respectively between 25 and 200 uC in agreement with the expected loss corresponding to the removal of solvent molecules. Between 200 and 300 uC, a plateau prior to decomposition is observed. For network (D-8)(CHCl3)2(Et2O), upon removal of crystals from the mother liquor, owing to the presence of Et2O molecules, immediate partial desolvation occurs. Consequently the TGA investigation does not show the percentage of the weight loss expected from the X-ray study. Coordination polymers 7 and 10 were chosen as represen- tative examples for the study of the magnetic properties of this class of compounds. Measurements were performed under a static field of 0.5 T. For both compounds, the xT value remains constant (for 7: 1.13 emu K mol21; for 10: 1.24 emu K mol21) from room temperature down to ca. 30 K, where it starts to Fig. 3 3D arrangement in the structure of (10)2(DMF)3(MeOH)2.

This behavior is the one expected for an isolated Ni(II) ion in an octahedral environment, with the decrease of the xT value ascribable to the effect of zero- field splitting. The data was fit using the following spin Hamiltonian H = gbHS + D[Sz 2 2 S(S + 1)/3], where g is the Lande´ factor, and D is the axial zero-field splitting parameter. The fit leads to g = 2.12 and |D| = 3.6 cm21 for 7 and g = 2.23 and |D| = 3.8 cm21 for 10 with a good agreement factor (R = 3 6 1025 and 1.8 6 1025 respectively). Attempts to fit the data considering only Ni–Ni interaction, in the mean field approach, did not give satisfactory results. Taking into account both zero-field splitting and Ni–Ni interaction does not significantly improve the fit and leads to over-parameteriza- tion. Conclusions The unprecedented self-assembly of Ni(dpm)2 complexes has been described leading thus to a series of analogous coordination polymers with different dimensionality. Whereas for pyridyl-appended tectons, 2D networks are obtained, a 3D architecture is observed for the imidazolyl analogue. The use of external chelating ligands for controlling the binding propensity of dpm based Ni metallatectons is currently under way.
