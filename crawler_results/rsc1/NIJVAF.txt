Compounds 1–3 display 3D 2-fold interpenetrat- ing 8-connected tsi net, 2D 4-connected sql net, and 3D 5-fold interpenetrating 4-connected dia net, respectively; while compound 4 features an extremely rare 3D 7-connected hxg-d cationic net and com- pound 5 adopts a 3D trinodal (4,4,6)-connected net with a new topology structure. For compounds 6 and 7, the topology in the structures were determined as 3D 3-fold interpenetrating 5-connected bnn net and 3D 2-fold interpenetrating binodal (3,5)-connected net, respectively. In the solid state, complexes 1, 4 and 5 exhibit nonlinear optical properties, and complex 5 has also been evaluated as a promising visible-light-driven photocatalyst for degradation of organic pollutants. The magnetic investigation of complexes 1 and 4 shows that there exists spin-canted antiferromagnetism for 1, whereas strong anti- ferromagnetic interaction and/or the depopulation of the higher energy Kramers doublets of the Co(II) centers are dominant in 4. Introduction The last two decades have witnessed significant progress in the design and synthesis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) which can be readily self-assembled by the coordination of metal cations/clusters with organic linkers. Extensive eﬀorts on such species have not only led to the creation of a huge number of MOFs of diverse topologies and aesthetic beauty, but also initiated a rational design strategy to construct porous materials targeted at some important applications.1–5 However, controllable synthesis of MOFs is a great chal- lenge because many factors may aﬀect their self-assembly, such as the chemical structure of the ligands chosen,6a the coordination geometry preferred by the metal,6b reaction temp- erature, the counterions,6c the solvent system,6d pH value,6e the metal-to-ligand ratio,6f and the methods of the crystalliza- tion,6g leading to their structural and dimensional variations.7 In contrast to plentiful research in bridging carboxylic acids, such as terephthalate and isophthalate, 2,5-thiophenedi- carboxylate (H2tdc) undertaken in MOFs is not yet well develo- ped.8,9 The ligand H2tdc is a particularly eﬀective building block, because (1) two carboxyl groups are oriented in a unique connecting angle (152°), allowing to establish bridges through various coordination modes, and may be more eﬀective to construct non-centrosymmetric structures—an essential requirement for nonlinear optical (NLO) properties; (2) the delocalization of a sulfur lone pair within the hetero- cyclic ring, facilitating charge transfer interactions of the †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Crystallographic data, additional crystal figures, TGA, PXRD for complexes 1–7.

To further understand the coordination chemistry of H2tdc and ancillary pyridine- or imidazole-based spacers, evaluate the influence of diﬀerent coordination geometry of metal ions on the resulting framework and explore new materials with beautiful architectures and good physical properties, we per- formed solvothermal reactions of H2tdc and N-auxiliary ligands with transition-metal centers (Co2+/Zn2+/Cd2+) to give seven new MOFs: [Co2(tdc)2(bpp)2(H2O)·(H2O)]n (bpp = 1,3-bis- (4-pyridyl)propane) (1), [Cd(tdc)(bpp)(H2O)·(H2O)2]n (2), [Zn2(tdc)2(bbi)2·(H2O)2]n (bbi = 1,1′-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imida- zole)) (3), [Co4(tdc)3(bimb)4(H2O)5·(tdc)·(DMF)·(H2O)2]n (bimb = 4,4′-bis(1-imidazolyl)biphenyl) (4), [Zn4(O)(tdc)3(bimb)4· (H2O)5.25·(CH3OH)]n (5), [Cd4(tdc)4(bimb)6·(H2O)2·(CH3OH)2· (DMF)4] (6) and [Co2(tdc)2(tib)2·(H2tdc)·(DMF)2] (tib = 1,3,5- tris(1-imidazolyl)benzene) (7). Experimental Materials and measurements Reagents and solvents employed were commercially available and used as received. Ligand bimb was prepared by literature methods.10 C, H and N microanalyses were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer 240 elemental analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on KBr discs on a Bruker Vector 22 spectrophotometer in the 4000–400 cm−1 region. Thermogravimetric analyses were per- formed on a simultaneous SDT 2960 thermal analyzer under flowing N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 between ambient temperature and 700 °C. The powder XRD data were collected on a Siemens D5005 diﬀractometer with Cu Kα radi- ation (λ = 1.5418 Å) over the 2θ range of 5–30° at room temp- erature. A pulsed Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm was used to generate an SHG signal from samples. The backward scattered SHG light was collected using a spheri- cal concave mirror and passed through a filter which transmits only 532 nm radiation. Fluorescence measurements were recorded with a Hitachi 850 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The solid-state diﬀuse-reflectance UV/Vis spectra for powder samples were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV/Vis spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere by using BaSO4 as a white standard. All magnetic measurements were performed on polycrystalline samples which were mounted in calibrated gelatin capsules held at the center of a polypropy- lene straw fixed to the end of the sample rod. The direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac) magnetic measure- ments were carried out on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 SQUID magnetometer. Magnetic data were corrected for mag- netization of the sample holder and for diamagnetic contri- butions, which were estimated from the Pascal constants.27 Photocatalytic experiments The visible light source was a 500 W halogen lamp with a UV cutoﬀfilter (providing visible light with λ > 400 nm).

X-ray crystallography The crystallographic data for 1–7 were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex CCD area-detector diﬀractometer with graphite- monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K using the ω-scan technique. The diﬀraction data were inte- grated by using the SAINT program,11 which was also used for the intensity corrections for the Lorentz and polarization eﬀects. Semi-empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program.12 The structures were solved by direct methods, and all non-hydrogen atoms were refined an- isotropically on F2 by the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXL-97 crystallographic software package except for the disordered atoms.13 The hydrogen atom positions were generated theoretically, allowed to ride on their respective parent atoms and included in the structure factor calculations with assigned isotropic thermal parameters. Disordered seg- ments were subjected to geometric restraints during the refine- ments. For 1, the H atoms on the coordinated aqua O5, as well as two free water molecules (O6, O7) could not be located. For 4, the distribution of peaks in the channels was chemically fea- tureless to refine using conventional discrete-atom models. To resolve these issues, the contribution of the electron density by the remaining water molecule was removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON. The number of solvent molecules in 4 was obtained by element analysis and TG. For 5, the H atoms of free water molecules (O16, O17) could not be found. For 6, The H atoms of free water molecules (O8) and oxygen (O6) atom of free CH3OH could not be located.

Results and discussion Description of crystal structures [Co2(tdc)2(bpp)2(H2O)·(H2O)]n (1). Interestingly, crystallo- graphic analysis revealed that compound 1 crystallizes in the chiral space group P42212. The asymmetric unit of 1 includes one Co(II) atom, one tdc2−anion, one bpp bridge and one-half μ2-bridging coordination aqua, as well as two one-quarter free water molecules. As shown in Fig. 1a, the Co1 atom, lying on a crystallographic 2-fold axis, is coordinated by three oxygen atoms from three individual tdc2−moieties and two nitrogen atoms from diﬀerent bpp ligands as well as one coordinated water (O5) to furnish a distorted octahedral geometry.

View Article Online tdc2−anion is associated with three Co(II) atoms by adopting bidentate-bridging and monodentate coordination modes, and each flexible bpp is ligated to two Co(II) ions with two terminal pyridine groups assuming a cis-conformation and steeply titled angle of 100.4°. In the current case, two carboxylate groups and one µ2-aqua (O5) bridge two symmetry-related Co1 atoms to form a dimer unit [Co2(COO)2(µ2-H2O)] with a nonbonding Co⋯Co distance of 3.657 Å (Fig. S1†). Apparently, each dimer unit is connected to another eight adjacent dimers via four shorter tdc2−and four longer bpp ligands to produce a 3D porous framework with large channels of size ca. 10.6 × 10.6 Å2 (based on Co⋯Co separation) along a- and b-directions (Fig. 1b). From the topo- logical view,14 if both tdc2−and bpp ligands can be considered as linear linkers, dinuclear cobalt subunits function as eight- connected nodes, the individual framework of compound 1 can be reduced to a uninodal 8-connected tsi net with the Schläfli symbol of (36·416·56) (Fig. 1c).15 Notably, the large voids formed by a single 3D network allow incorporation of another identical network. Therefore, the overall structure of 1 has two identical 3D nets, which mutually interdigitate to form a 2-fold interpenetrating 3D framework (Fig. 1d). Hence, the large pore void spaces of single net have been reduced sig- nificantly. Upon interpenetration, the compound only retains an eﬀective void volume of 403.1 Å3 per unit cell, which is 9.9% of the crystal volume.16 Obviously, the architecture of 1 is diﬀerent from the docu- mented complex [Co3(tdc)3(bpp)2]·2DMF17 to some extent though the starting composites are completely identical. Complex [Co3(tdc)3(bpp)2]·2DMF presents a 3D uninodal 8-connected framework without entanglement based on tri- nuclear cobalt units with the Schläfli symbol of (440·68). Subtly diﬀerent reaction conditions apparently generate structural diversifications, such as in the cases of 1 and [Co3(tdc)3(bpp)2]·2DMF, upon changing the reaction tempera- tures from 100 to 120 °C, and converting the metal-to-ligand ratio from 1 : 1 : 1 to 1.5 : 1 : 1. Similar phenomenon was observed in the literature.18 [Cd(tdc)(bpp)(H2O)·(H2O)2]n (2). The substitution of Co(Ac)2· 4H2O for the preparation of 1 by Cd(NO3)2·6H2O leads to a completely diﬀerent structure. Complex 2 was solved in the centric P21/c space group. The Cd(II) centers have pentagonal bipyramid coordination geometry defined by two chelate car- boxylate groups from two distinct tdc2−anions and two nitro- gen atoms from separate bpp ligands as well as one terminal water molecule (O5) (Fig. 2a). Obviously, each tdc2−anion coordinates to two Cd atoms with both deprotonated carboxy- late groups adopting bidentate-chelating coordination mode and each flexible bpp is ligated to two Cd(II) ions via cis mode with two terminal pyridine groups steeply titled at 90.1°. The extension of the structure into a 2D sheet is accomplished by tdc2−and bpp linking the metal centers (Fig. 2b). The Cd(II) centers were considered as four-connectors linking two tdc2−anions and two bpp ligands, and thus the topology of 2 is related to a 4-connected sql net with Schläfli symbol of (44·62). In compounds 1 and 2, although the organic compositions and the conformation of bpp ligands are essentially identical, the various dimensions and connections in both coordination networks are found, which are undoubtedly associated with the diﬀerences in metal coordinated environments and binding modes of tdc2−. [Zn2(tdc)2(bbi)2·(H2O)2]n (3). There are two crystallographi- cally independent Zn(II) atom, two tdc2−anions, one full and halves of two crystallographically distinct bbi ligands, one guest water molecule, as well as two free aqua with respective occupancy of 0.21 and 0.79 in the asymmetric unit of 3. Both Zn1 and Zn2 centers adopt distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry, composed of two oxygen atoms from two tdc2−moi- eties and two nitrogen atoms from separate bbi bridges (Fig. 3a). In compound 3, the two half bbi ligands sit on the inversion centers and all flexible bbi are ligated to Zn(II) ions via trans-modes. Each tdc2−moiety connects two Zn(II) atoms in monodentate coordination modes to form one-dimensional (1D) chains, which are pillared by bbi ligands to construct a 3D porous structure with large channels of size ca. 10.47 × Fig. 2 (a) Coordination environment of Cd atom with hydrogen atoms and free water omitted for clarity of 2.

The channels nearly disappear with a free volume of only 7.8% upon interpenetration. Further examinations reveal that 3 adopts a 5-fold interpenetrating 4-connected dia net with a Schläfli symbol of 66 (Fig. 3c). [Co4(tdc)3(bimb)4(H2O)5·(tdc)·(DMF)·(H2O)2]n (4). When the auxiliary ligand was changed from flexible bpp used in the preparation for 1 to rigid bimb, complex 4 was obtained. Inter- estingly, compound 4 features a cationic 3D framework with chiral space group P1. The asymmetric unit of 4 comprises four independent Co(II) atoms, four individual tdc2−anions, four distinct bimb bridges, two μ2-H2O, three terminal water, as well as three lattice water and one DMF molecule. All Co(II) centers are situated in distorted octahedral arrangement. Co1, Co2 and Co4 posses similar coordination spheres, surrounded by two oxygen donors from distinct tdc2−anions, two nitrogen atoms from separate bimb bridges, one μ2-H2O group and one terminally coordinated aqua. By contrast, Co3 exhibit slightly diﬀerent coordination environment, bound to four oxygen donors from three diﬀerent tdc2−moieties and one μ2-bridging aqua, two nitrogen atoms from separate bimb linkers (Fig. 4a). The three tdc2−anions (containing S1, S2 and S3) present identical coordination modes to that in compound 1, connect- ing Co ions to give 1D ladder chains along the a axis, which are further interconnected by linear exobidentate bimb ligands to achieve a cationic 3D architecture without interpenetration possessing large channels of size ca. 6.40 × 9.56 Å2 (based on C⋯C separation) along the a direction. Notably, the molecular size of tdc2−is ca. 5.97 Å. It is obvious that the presence of the large voids in 4 facilitates the residing of tdc2−(containing S4) inside the framework as a charge balance moiety (Fig. 4b). Next, guest tdc2−anion was not coordinated to metal Co(II) ions because of the larger steric hindrance compared with co- ordinated water molecules (O18 and O19). Finally, the struc- ture only retains 8.5% solvent accessible void volume, where accommodate free water and DMF molecules. Specially, in 4, two types of dinuclear cobalt subunits, [Co2(COO)(µ2-H2O)] (dimer I) and [Co2(COO)2(µ2-H2O)] (dimer II), similar to that observed in complex 1, are generated by one (or double) carboxylate groups and one µ2-aqua bridging an adjacent pair of independent Co(II) atoms. The intermetallic distances of Co1⋯Co2 and Co3⋯Co4 are 3.84 and 3.67 Å. Obviously, each dimer I links another six dimer I and one dimer II to serve as a 7-connected node, whereas each dimer II connects with another six dimer II and one dimer I to also form septahedral node via four bimb and three tdc2−linkers (Fig. 4c). Topologically, dimer I and dimer II are equal, because the presence of one more COO−group in dimer II does not aﬀect the intercluster connectivity. Therefore, the whole structure of 4 can be described as an uncommon unino- dal 7-connected hxg-d net with a Schläfli symbol of (418·63) (Fig. 4d). Considering the metal ions (metal cluster) as nodes and bridging ligands as linkers, even-numbered connecting nodes (4-, 6-, and 8-connected) and odd-numbered low-connected topologies (3- and 5-connected) are well documented in the lit- eratures, while 7-connected examples are rather rare and only a limited number of such molecular structures have been reported recently,19 such as (33·412·55·6)-vcn, (417·64)-sev20 and (42·68)-hxg-d-5-Imma21 nets. It should be mentioned that the hxg-d network topology is diﬀerent from the known, but rarely reported, 6-connected (46·69) hxg net.22 A detailed comparison of the two nets (hxg-d vs. hxg) is discussed below. For each periodic network, there is a unique ‘natural’ tiling.23 The hxg-d net has the natural tiling [46], whereas the tile [46·64] is found for the hxg net.

View Article Online of a tiling is derived by placing a new vertex inside each tile and connecting pairs of new vertices which are in adjacent tiles by a new edge through the face common to the two tiles.24 A tiling with transitivity pqrs shows a dual with transi- tivity srqp.25 Herein, the hxg-d net with 1211 transitivity is the dual structure of hxg net with 1121 transitivity. A noticeable observation is that both 1 and 4 feature 3D net- works based on very similar dinuclear cobalt subunits, however, the two complexes exhibit obviously diﬀerent crystal systems and space groups from each other, with 1 crystallizing in the higher symmetric tetragonal space group P42212, whereas 4 adopts the lower symmetric triclinic space group P1. The former has a higher point and lattice symmetry, resulting in a highly regular net arrangement, as verified by the Topos analyses (8-connected tsi for 1 and 7-connected hxg-d for 4). The structural diﬀerence could be related to the flexible or rigid nature of N-donor co-ligands and diﬀerent geometrical shapes of bpp and bimb. [Zn4(O)(tdc)3(bimb)4·(H2O)5.25·(CH3OH)]n (5). When Co(NO3)· 6H2O was replaced by Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, complex 5 was obtained. The framework of 5 crystallizes in the acentric space group Pc. The asymmetric unit of 5 contains four ZnII cations, three tdc2−anions, one μ2-O2−moiety, four bimb ligands, three and two half lattice water molecules, as well as one CH3OH with two-fold disorder. Atoms Zn1 and Zn2 were tetra- hedrally coordinated by two carboxylic oxygen atoms from two independent tdc2−and two nitrogen atoms from diﬀerent bimb. Centers Zn3 and Zn4 were also found in tetrahedral coordination geometries, furnished by one carboxylic oxygen atom from tdc2−, one μ2-O2−and two nitrogen atoms from two unique bimb (Fig. 5a). As observed in the case of 3, the tdc2− moieties connect Zn(II) atoms in monodentate coordination modes to form 1D chains, which are extended with rigid bimb ligands, thereby resulting in a 3D porous structure with large windows of size ca. 10.56 × 10.44 × 17.02 Å3 (based on Zn⋯Zn separation), respectively (Fig. 5b). Apparently, Zn3 and Zn4 are associated together by one μ2-O2−to form a dimer, which is surrounded by four bimb ligands and two tdc2−ligands to aﬀord a 6-connected node, while both Zn1 and Zn2 act as 4-connected nodes. As a consequence, the resulting 3D frame- work corresponds to a trinodal (4,4,6)-connected net with a point symbol of {3·4·5·62·7}{3·4·52·62}{3·42·53·66·73}, which rep- resents a new topology analyzed by the Topos 4.0 program (Fig. 5c). Because of the spacious nature of the single network, the potential voids are filled via mutual interpenetration of an identical 3D framework generating a 2-fold interpenetrating architecture (Fig. 5d). After interpenetration, the structure only retains 11.2% solvent accessible void volume. As expected, guest water and CH3OH molecules occupy the void of the inter- space region. [Cd4(tdc)4(bimb)6·(H2O)2·(CH3OH)2·(DMF)4] (6). In order to further understand the influence of metal ions on the self- assembly process, Cd(NO3)2·6H2O was used to react with H2tdc and bimb to obtain complex 6. There are one Cd(II) atom, one tdc2−moiety, one and a half bbi ligands, one-half free water plus one-half CH3OH molecule, as well as one DMF with two- fold disorder in the asymmetric unit. The Cd(II) centers display a similar pentagonal bipyramid coordination geometry to that of 2, except that the position of coordinating aqua was replaced by one bimb nitrogen atom (Fig. 6a). Obviously, each tdc2−anion joins two Cd atoms (via the same coordination modes to that in compound 2) to form 1D chains along the a axis, which are linked by rigid bimb to form a 3D porous framework. Larger rectangular channels with the window dimensions of ca. 33.6 × 17.7 Å2 and 10.7 × 18.2 Å2 (based on Cd⋯Cd distances) along the a- and c-directions are presented in the individual 3D network (Fig. 6b). Topologically, each Cd center is coordinated by two tdc2−ligands and three bimb bridges, hence, Cd(II) ions can be reduced to 5-connected Fig. 5 (a) Coordination environment of Zn atom with hydrogen atoms and free water as well as CH3OH molecules omitted for clarity of 5.

According to this simplification, the resulting structure features 3-fold interpenetrating 5-connected bnn net with a Schläfli symbol of (46·64) (Fig. 6c and 6d). Despite the frame- work interpenetration, the structure retains 26.2% solvent accessible void volume (965.1 out of the 3677.6 Å3 unit cell volume). Free water, CH3OH and DMF molecules are located in these pores. For complexes 2 and 6, all Cd(II) cations lie in pentagonal bipyramidal spheres except that the position of coordinating aqua in 2 was replaced by one exobidentate bimb nitrogen atom in 6. As a result, complex 2 shows a 2D layer whereas 6 features a complicated 3D array, implying that the more brid- ging coordination sites may facilitate the formation of a higher dimensional structure. [Co2(tdc)2(tib)2·(H2tdc)·(DMF)2] (7). To evaluate the role of the auxiliary co-ligand in the self-assembly of MOFs, when the neutral bridge was changed from exobidentate bpp (or bimb) used in the preparation for 1 (or 4) to trigonal tib,26 complex 7 was obtained. The fundamental building unit of 7 contains one Co(II) cation, one tdc2−anion, one tib ligand, one free DMF molecule, as well as one-half neutral H2tdc fragment with the sulfur atom localized on the mirror plane. Co1 is six- coordinated with distorted octahedral coordination geometry, by three oxygen atoms from two diﬀerent tdc2−and three nitro- gen atoms from three distinct tib (Fig. 7a). On the other hand, each tdc2−links two Co(II) in monodentate and bidentate- chelate binding modes to form a typical 1D chain along the c axis, which are further connected by divergent tib ligands to form a 3D framework (Fig. 7b). The Co1 center serves as a five- connected node since it links two tdc2−and three distinct tib, with tib representing a three-connector. Overall, the resulting structure of 7 is a binodal (3,5)-connected net with a Schläfli symbol of (42·65·83)(42·6) (Fig. 7c). Notably, the large voids in the single framework are filled by another identical framework in a typical 2-fold interpenetration fashion (Fig. 7d). Despite the interpenetration, the structure still retains 39.6% solvent accessible void volume (2333.2 out of the 5897 Å3 unit cell volume), which accommodates neutral H2tdc and DMF guests. As described above, complexes 1, 4 and 7 are constructed by the same metal ion and carboxylate moiety except diﬀerent flexible (or rigid) N-auxiliary ligands. In the three compounds, all Co(II) cations adopt octahedral geometry, and tdc2−anions illustrate identical binding modes (bidentate-bridging and monodentate coordination modes) both in 1 and 4. However, complexes 1, 4 and 7 exhibit distinct 3D arrays. Quite similar phenomena were observed in complexes 2 and 6 (all Cd(II) cations in pentagonal bipyramidal sphere, tdc2−in bidentate- chelating coordination mode), complexes 3 and 5 (all Zn(II) cations in tetrahedral environment, tdc2−in monodentate coordination fashion), which could be ascribed to the diﬀerent nature of N-auxiliary spacers. Despite the similarity of the chosen organic ligands, the structures of complexes 4, 5 and 6, as well as complexes 1 and 2, are significantly diﬀerent, owing to the diﬀerent coordination geometry around the central metal atoms. As expected, the coordination numbers increase as the cation size increases. The results imply that the metal center has a great impact on the resulting framework structures. Syntheses, PXRD, and thermal stabilities of the complexes In 1–6, the carboxylate groups of H2tdc are completely deproto- nated, which are in agreement with IR spectra analyses Fig. 6 (a) Coordination environment of Cd atom with hydrogen atoms, free water, CH3OH as well as DMF molecules omitted for clarity of 6.

By contrast, in 7, the presence of absorption bands at 1712 cm−1 indicates the guest H2tdc is protonated. The phase purities of the complexes 1–5 and 7 were confirmed by PXRD measure- ments, and each PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized sample is consistent with the simulated one (Fig. S2–S7†). For compound 6, although the syntheses were found to be fully reproducible, the yield was very low. Therefore, it is diﬃcult to collect enough pure samples for PXRD. In order to investigate the mobility of the solvent molecules within the MOFs, TGA was carried out for 1–7, and the results are shown in Fig. S8.† No obviously weight loss was found for complex 1 before the decomposition of the framework occurred at about 235 °C. Compound 2 shows a weight loss of 11.02% below 75 °C ascribed to the loss of lattice water and coordination water molecules (calcd 10.10%). The dehydrated phase remains stable up to 180 °C until the organic ligands start to be released. Complex 3 shows a weight loss of 4.00% below 116 °C, attributed to the release of the free water molecules (calcd 4.06%), and the decomposition of the backbone occurs at 280 °C. For 4, there is a weight loss of 8.51% below 170 °C corresponding to the departure of free DMF, coordinated and free water solvents (calcd 8.83%), the dehydrated phase remains stable up to 250 °C until the framework starts to decompose. For 5, there is a weight loss of 5.57% below 188 °C corresponding to the departure of free aqua and CH3OH sol- vents (calcd 5.93%), and the decomposition of the backbone occurs at 300 °C. Complex 6 shows a weight loss of 3.54% below 100 °C, attributed to the release of the free water and CH3OH molecules (calcd 3.12%), and further weight loss is observed at about 140 °C. No obvious weight loss was found for complex 7 before 160 °C, which shows a weight loss of 11.53% below 235 °C ascribed to the loss of free DMF mole- cules (calcd 11.00%). NLO properties 1, 4 and 5 crystallize in non-centrosymmetric space groups, which are associated with a second harmonic generation (SHG) response.27 Our preliminary measurements on pow- dered samples of 1, 4 and 5 at ambient temperature suggest that 1 and 4 are approximately 0.4 times as SHG active as urea, 5 is 0.3 times as active. Photocatalytic activities To elucidate the photoresponse wavelength region, the solid state diﬀuse-reflectance UV-vis spectra for the as-synthesized compounds were recorded (Fig. 8).28 Compounds 1–5 and 7 consist of absorption components both in the UV and visible region. The UV absorption bands are around 368, 353, 340, 356, 350, 370 nm for 1–5 and 7, respectively, which could be attributed to ligand-to-ligand charge transfer. Broad absorp- tion bands found at 423, 439, 489, 425, 481 and 416 nm for these compounds could be ascribed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). Additionally, clear peaks in the visible region were found at 602, 594, and 599 nm for compounds 1, 4 and 7, which probably originate from the d–d spin-allowed transition of the Co2+ (d7) ions. The presence of relatively broader visible region transitions motivated us to explore applications of 2, 3 and 5 in heterogeneous photocatalysis. The photodegradation experiment under visible irradiation was carried out after the dark adsorption–desorption equili- brium was achieved. The distinctly shortened degradation time compared with the control experiments underlines that only catalyst 5 is active for the decomposition of X3B under visible-light irradiation. In contrast, compounds 2 and 3 are unable to degrade X3B eﬃciently under the same conditions. The kinetic data for the degradation of X3B can be well fitted by the apparent first-order rate equation, the rate constant under visible-light irradiation was found to be 0.44 h−1 for that of 5 (Fig. 9). After photocatalysis, compound 5 was recycled by filtration and powder XRD demonstrates that complex 5 is rather stable during photocatalysis. In addition, the presence of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, a widely used •OH scavenger) greatly depressed the photodegradation rate of X3B on catalyst 5, that is, the relevant rate constant for 5 was sharply decreased to 0.06 h−1 under visible light. The •OH quenching experiment result suggests that the photodegradation of X3B by catalyst 5 is predominately through attack of •OH radicals.29 A simplified model of photocatalytic reaction mechanism was proposed as depicted in Scheme 1. Because the HOMO is mainly contribu- ted by oxygen and (or) nitrogen 2p bonding orbitals (valence band, VB) and the LUMO by empty transition metal orbitals (conduction band, CB).

The HOMO strongly demands one electron to return to its stable state. Therefore, one electron was captured from water molecules, which was oxygenated into •OH active species. Meanwhile, the electrons (e−) in LUMO could be combined with the oxygen adsorbed on the surfaces of MOF to form •O2 −, then they might transform to the hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Then the formed •OH radicals could cleave X3B eﬀectively to complete the photocatalytic process. Fluorescence properties Luminescence properties of MOFs have attracted much inter- est in view of potential applications as photoactive materials. The solid-state luminescence properties of complexes 1–5 and 7 as well as the free ligand H2tdc have been investigated at room temperature (Fig. 10). Emission bands were observed at 372, 366, 364, 367, 364 and 369 nm for 1–5 and 7, which were neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to- metal charge transfer (LMCT) in nature and could be assigned to a combination of the charge transfer process and intra- ligand emission states (π*–n or π–π*), because very similar emissions are observed for the free ligand (Fig. S9†). Magnetic properties of complexes 1 and 4 The magnetic susceptibility of complexes 1 and 4 containing dinuclear Co(II) subunits, were measured in the range of 2–300 K at 1000 Oe (Fig. 11). The values of χMT at room temp- erature are 6.62 cm3 mol−1 K (per CoII 2) and 12.01 cm3 mol−1 K (per CoII 4), which are greater than the expected spin-only values for magnetically isolated high-spin cobalt(II) ions and in agreement with the unquenched orbital contribution typical of the 4T1g ground state in octahedral cobalt(II) species. The χMT product for complex 4 showed continuously decrease with the decrease of temperature, implying that a strong antiferro- magnetic interaction and/or the depopulation of the higher energy Kramers doublets of the Co(II) centers are present over the whole temperature range.30 However, upon cooling, the χMT product for complex 1 decreases slowly and reaches a minimum value of 4.76 cm3 mol−1 K at 59 K, then, it exhibits an abrupt increase of χMT to a maximum of 12.61 cm3 mol−1 K ca. at 34 K and further decreases sharply at low temperature. At T < 46 K, the susceptibility is strongly field-dependent, and it increases as the measuring field decreases in small fields (Fig. 13 inset). This indicates that the magnetic property of complex 1 is typical of spin-canted antiferromagnetism system.31 The abrupt increase of χM under small field below 46 K clearly exhibits the onset of spontaneous magnetization. The ac magnetic susceptibilities of 1 were measured in zero dc field and ac field of 2 Oe with diﬀerent frequencies (Fig. 12). The temperature of the magnetic ordering (TC = 39 K) can be confirmed the maximum of the frequency-independent out-of-phase signals. The magnetization curve measured at 2 K shows a sigmoid shape characteristic of metamagnetism, which is confirmed by the disappearance of the maximum of χM as the applied field is larger than 3.3 T (Fig. 13). The M–H plot (−7 T to 7 T) shows a small hysteresis loop, revealing that complex 1 is a soft magnet with values of the coercive field (Hc) and remnant magnetization (Mr) of 1520 Oe and 0.055μB (Fig. 14). The mag- netization at 70 000 Oe is 4.66Nβ which is lower than the expected saturation value of 5.3Nβ for per CoII 2 (Seﬀ= 1/2 and Scheme 1 A simpliﬁed model to illustrate the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of X3B on catalyst 5.

Because of the saturation of the spin canting is not observed, we estimated roughly the spin canting angle (α = 0.59°) from the value of the remnant magnetization and the expected saturation magnetization.28 The origin of the spin canting in 1 can be attributed to the magnetic anisotropy of the high-spin cobalt(II) ion and the antisymmetric exchange.31–33 Conclusion In summary, solvothermal reactions of H2tdc and N-auxiliary ligands in the presence of cobalt(II), zinc(II) and cadmium(II) salts have given rise to seven new metal–organic frameworks, namely, [Co2(tdc)2(bpp)2(H2O)·(H2O)]n (1), [Cd(tdc)(bpp)(H2O)· (H2O)2]n (2), [Zn2(tdc)2(bbi)2·(H2O)2]n (3), [Co4(tdc)3(bimb)4- (H2O)5·(tdc)·(DMF)·(H2O)2]n (4), [Zn4(O)(tdc)3(bimb)4·(H2O)5.25· (CH3OH)]n (5), [Cd4(tdc)4(bimb)6·(H2O)2·(CH3OH)2·(DMF)4] (6) and [Co2(tdc)2(tib)2·(H2tdc)·(DMF)2] (7), which exhibit struc- tural diversity. Compounds 1–3 3D display 2-fold interpenetrat- ing 8-connected tsi net, 2D 4-connected sql net, and 3D 5-fold interpenetrating 4-connected dia net, respectively; while com- pound 4 features an extremely rare 3D 7-connected hxg-d cat- ionic net and compound 5 adopts a 3D trinodal (4,4,6)- connected net with a new topology structure. For compounds 6 and 7, the topology in the structures were determined as 3D 3-fold interpenetrating 5-connected bnn net and 3D 2-fold interpenetrating binodal (3,5)-connected net, respectively. In the solid state, complexes 1, 4 and 5 exhibit nonlinear-optic properties. Complex 5 has been evaluated as a promising visible-light-driven photocatalyst for degradation of organic pollutants. The magnetic investigation of complexes 1 and 4 show that there exists typical spin-canted antiferromagnetism in 1, whereas strong antiferromagnetic interaction and/or the depopulation of the higher energy Kramers doublets of the Co(II) centers in 4.

The crystallographic data for 1-7 were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex CCD area-detector diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K using the ω-scan technique. The diffraction data were integrated by using the SAINT program,11 which was also used for the intensity corrections for the Lorentz and polarization effects. Semi-empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program.12 The structures were solved by direct methods, and all non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically on F2 by the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXL-97 crystallographic software package except for the disordered atoms.13 The hydrogen atom positions were generated theoretically, allowed to ride on their respective parent atoms and included in the structure factor calculations with assigned isotropic thermal parameters. For Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Dalton Transactions This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 4, the distribution of peaks in the channels was chemically featureless to refine using conventional discrete-atom models. To resolve these issues, the contribution of the electron density by the remaining water molecule was removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON. The residual electron density count amounted to 61 e per unit cell, corresponding to nearly 1 molecules of DMF and 2 molecules of H2O, which was in agreement with the results of element analysis and TG. For 5, the H atoms of free water molecules (O17, O18, O20) could not be found. For 6, the H atoms of free water molecules (O8) and oxygen (O6) atom of free CH3OH could not be located. To assist the refinement, several restraints were applied: for 2, O-H bonds of coordinated water (O5) and free aqua (O6 and O7) were restrained by DFIX, the H···H distances were restrained by DANG; for 3, possible hydrogen atoms of the solvent water molecules were found from difference Fourier maps, and then initially refined making use of DFIX restraints; For 5, the free CH3OH is disordered over two positions with site occupancy factors of 0.50/0.50, the C-O bonds of CH3OH were restrained by DFIX; 'similar' Uij values of C91 and C91’, O19 and O19’ were obtained by using SIMU and ISOR instructions; the C1 and C2 atoms of imidazole group also exhibit disordered over two positions with site occupancy factors of 0.50/0.50, atoms C1, C1b, C2, C2b were restrained by SIMU, plus SADI restraints to make C1-C2 and C1b-C2b, N1-C1 and N1-C1b, N2-C2 and N2-C2b, C1-C3 and C1b-C3, C2-C3 and C2b-C3 distances approximately equal; for 6, the free DMF is disordered over two positions with equal site occupancy factors, the C-N and C-O bonds of free DMF were restrained by DFIX, equal C34 and C34’, C35 and C35’, C36 and C36’ displacement parameters were obtained by EADP instruction, the anisotropic displacement components of N7 and C36’ along the line joining them are restrained to be equal by DELU; for 7, atoms C26, C27 and O6 were restrained by ISOR, the C-N and C-O bonds of free DMF were restrained by DFIX. Crystallographic data and other pertinent information for 1-7 are summarized in Table S1, while the selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table S2. More details on the crystallographic studies as well as atom displacement parameters are presented in the CIF.
