Complex 1 exhibits a 1D ‘ladder’ chain structure, which is extended by the hydrogen-bonding interactions to form a 3D supramolecular network. Complexes 2, 3 and 5 display 2D (4,4) layer networks and are extended by the hydrogen-bonding, p…p stacking and C–H…p interactions to generate 3D supramolecular networks. Complex 4 is a 3D pillared layered framework by linking a 2D Cd(II)-ip double layer with L1 molecules.

Introduction The rational design and synthesis of mixed-ligand metal–organic coordination complexes1 are of great interest, not only for their fascinating ability to form a variety of architectures and topological networks, but also for their potential applications in the fields of molecular magnetism, gas absorption and storage, photoluminescence, catalysis.2–4 Despite the significant progress achieved, the predicted and controlled synthesis of coordination complexes is still a major challenge for the moment because the self-assembly of networks with unique structures and topologies are frequently influenced by many factors, such as the coordination geometry preferred by the metal cation,5 ligand structure,6 counterion,7 pH value of the reaction solution,8 reaction temperature,9 reaction solvent system,10 and the metal- to-ligand ratio.11 Among these factors, the judicious selection of multifunctional organic ligands and metal cations is an effective approach to construct mixed-ligand metal–organic coordination complexes. Therefore, how to employ proper metal cations and adjust the coordination geometries and coordination environ- ments through rational choice of ligand to construct novel complexes is still a funny and challenging work. To date, some excellent coordination complexes containing mixed-ligands, especially the polycarboxylate and multipyridyl ligands, have been widely reported,12 in which the nature of metal cations can significantly influence the structures of the mixed-ligand complexes due to the fact that different transition metals with different metal radii can form diverse coordination geometries and coordination environments even under the same reaction conditions, thus resulting in diverse structures and topologies of the complexes. Moreover, the two components incorporate merits of different functional groups and could more easily obtain diverse architectures by decorating or changing one of the two ligands above.

View Article Online / Journal Homepage / Table of Contents for this issue isophthalic acid (H2ip) is a good candidate for the construction of coordination complexes with diverse structures owing to its multiple coordination modes and unique bent angle of 120u and has been widely utilized to construct mixed-ligand coordination complexes,13,14 in which most of the multipyridyl ligands employed are the rigid or flexible 4,49-bpy like molecules with symmetrical spacers (Scheme 1a).13 By contrast, non-4,49-bpy like molecules with symmetrical spacers are rarely concerned (Scheme 1b–d),14 especially the molecules with flexible symme- trical spacers. Till now, only three such types of molecules have been employed, namely 2,29-bis(3-pyridylmethoxy)-1,19-biphe- nylene,14d 1,19-bis(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-2,29-biimidazole,14e and N,N9-bis(3-pyridinecarboxamide)-1,4-benzene14f. However, the flexible bis(pyridyl) ligands with unsymmetrical spacers have not been used to construct mixed-ligand coordination complexes with H2ip. With the aim of further understanding the coordination chemistry of mixed-ligand complexes, herein, we have designed and synthesized two flexible bis(pyridyl) ligand with a non- coordinating amine group in the unsymmetrical spacer, N- (pyridin-3-ylmethyl)pyridin-2-amine (L1) and N-(pyridin-3- ylmethyl)pyridin-3-amine (L2) (Scheme 2). The two pyridyls can freely twist around the –CH2–NH– group with different bond angles to meet the requirements of the metal centers. The amine group in the flexible spacer of the two ligands can potentially form hydrogen bonds with the acceptor groups to direct the self- assembly of interesting supramolecular systems. Meanwhile, the coordination direction and different positions of the pyridyl N atoms in the positional isomeric ligands may benefit the formation of different topological structures. To the best of our knowledge, the mixed-ligand coordination complexes containing a flexible bis(pyridyl) ligand with an unsymmetrical spacer are unreported. Hence, to this contribution, we report here the syntheses, structures and properties of eight new transition metal coordina- tion complexes based on different transition metals, H2ip and L1/ L2, namely, [Mn2(ip)2(L1)2(H2O)3]n?nH2O (1), [Co(ip)L1(H2O)]n (2), [Zn(ip)L1]n (3), [Cd2(ip)2L1]n (4), [Mn(ip)L2(H2O)]n?nCH3OH (5), [M(ip)L2(H2O)]n?nH2O [M = Co (6) and Ni (7)], and [Zn3(ip)2(OH)2(L2)2]n (8).{ Complex 1 exhibits a 1D ‘ladder’ chain structure, while complexes 2, 3 and 5 display (4,4) layer networks. These four complexes are further extended by hydro- gen-bonding, p…p stacking and C–H…p interactions to generate 3D supramolecular networks. Complex 4 is a 3D pillared layered framework by linking a 2D Cd(II)-ip double layer with L1 molecules. Complex 6 and 7 are isomorphous and exhibit a 3D tcb net. Complex 8 is a 3D framework and presents a new topology with the Schla¨fli symbol of (55?69?7). The structures and topologies of the eight coordination complexes are highly influenced by the versatile coordination modes of the ip dianions, conformations of L1 and L2, as well as the nature of the metal cations. Moreover, solid-state luminescent properties demonstrate that complexes 3, 4 and 8 exhibit strong blue emission at room temperature. Experimental Materials and methods All chemicals and solvents were of A. R. grade and used without further purification in the syntheses. The ligands L1 and L2 were synthesized according to the literature methods.15 Elemental analyses were carried out with a Vario MICRO from Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, and the infrared spectra (IR) were recorded from KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400 cm21 on a Bruker Equinox 55 FT-IR spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffrac- tion (PXRD) patterns were measured at 293 K on a Bruker D8 diffractometer (Cu-Ka, l = 1.54059 A˚ ). The TG analyses were carried out on a Perkin Elmer TG/DTA 6300 thermal analyzer under flowing N2 atmosphere, with a heating rate of 10 uC min21.

X-ray crystallographic measurements Table 1 provides a summary of the crystal data, data collection and refinement parameters for complexes 1–8. All diffraction data were collected at 295 K on a RIGAKU RAXIS-RAPID diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Mo-Ka (l = 0.71073 A˚ ) radiation in v scan mode. All structures were solved by direct method and difference Fourier syntheses. All non- hydrogen atoms were refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters. The hydrogen atoms attached to carbons were placed in calculated positions with C–H = 0.93 A˚ (aromatic H atoms), C–H = 0.97 A˚ (methylene H atoms), and U(H) = 1.2Ueq(C) in the riding model approximation. The hydrogen atoms of nitrogen atoms in complexes 2, 4, 6–8 were placed in calculated positions with N–H = 0.86 A˚ and U(H) = 1.2 Ueq(N) in the riding model approximation, while the hydrogen atoms of nitrogen atoms in complexes 1, 3 and 5 were located in difference Fourier maps and were also refined in the riding model approximation, with N–H distance restraint (0.86(1) A˚ ) and U(H) = 1.2 Ueq(N). The hydrogen atoms of water molecules (complexes 2–8) and hydroxyl groups (complexes 5 and 8) were located in difference Fourier maps and were also refined in the riding model approximation, with O–H distance restraint (0.85(1) A˚ ) and U(H) = 1.5 Ueq(O). The hydrogen atoms of water molecules in complex 1 and 7, O1w in complex 2, as well as O2w in complex 6 were fixed by WinGX with O–H = 0.82 or 0.85 A˚ and U(H) = 1.5 Ueq(O).

The crystals of complexes containing Mn(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) can be obtained at 120 uC with high quality and yield. However, only a few crystals of the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated from the large amount of powder crystals. Hence, the reaction temperature was increased to 140 uC, at which a high yield and quality of crystals were obtained. Meanwhile, during the experiments, the effects of anions on the structures were also explored by replacing nitrates with the acetates and chlorides. Single X-ray diffraction analyses indicate that the different anions exhibit no effect on the structures, i.e. the same structural complexes could be obtained in spite of the different anions. This result also demonstrates that the ip dianion exhibits stronger coordination ability in compar- ison with the aforementioned inorganic anions and is beneficial to the crystallization of the complexes. Structure description of [Mn2(ip)2(L1)2(H2O)3]n?nH2O (1) As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the asymmetric unit of complex 1 consists of two Mn(II) cations, two ip dianions, two L1 molecules, three coordinated water molecules and one free water molecule. The two Mn(II) cations are six-coordinated and display a slightly distorted octahedron geometry, in which the coordination sphere of Mn1 is (Ow)2O3N and the coordination sphere of Mn2 is OwO3N2. The two different ip dianions act in the same m2 (k1O:k1O:k1O) coordination mode to bridge adjacent Mn(II) cations into a 1D linear chain structure along the [100] direction, which is further interconnected to the other chain through the L1 molecules, thus generating a ‘ladder’ chain along the same direction (Fig. 1b). The Mn…Mn distances in the ‘ladder’ chain are 10.182(3) (Mn1…Mn1ii and Mn2…Mn2ii) and 9.824(3) A˚ (Mn1…Mn2), respectively. Adjacent ‘ladder’ chains are self-assembled to form the 2D (4,4) supramolecular layer as shown in Fig. 1b through the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the acceptor of N6 and donor of H2w2 with the hydrogen-bonding distances being 2.750(8) A˚ (Table S2, ESI{).

The ip dianions in the two components act in the same m2 (k1O:k1O:k1O) coordination mode as observed in complex 1 to bridge adjacent Co(II) cations into a 1D linear chain motif along the [101] direction, which is further connected by the L1 molecules to generate a 2D (4,4) layer structure (Fig. 2b).

Structure description of [Zn(ip)L1]n (3) As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the asymmetric unit of complex 3 consists of one Zn(II) cation, one ip dianion and one L1 molecule. The Zn(II) cation is four-coordinated by two carboxyl O atoms and two pyridyl N atoms and displays tetrahedron geometry. The ip dianion acts in the m2 (k1O:k1O) coordination mode to bridge adjacent Zn(II) cations into a 1D linear chain structure along the [010] direction, which is further intercon- nected by the L1 molecules along the [100] direction, thus generating a 2D (4,4) grid (Fig. 3b). The Zn…Zn distances between the ip spacer and L1 spacer are 10.167(2) and 9.194(2) A˚ , respectively. As observed in complex 2, adjacent grids are parallel with each other along the [001] direction and packed in an interlaced AB mode in which the grids of one layer are effectively blocked by the other layer. Meanwhile, these two layers are further connected by the p…p stacking interactions between the phenyl rings of ip dianions along the [100] direction, thus giving rise to a double layer structure as shown in Fig. 3c. Moreover, the adjacent double layers are further stabilized into a 3D framework by the C–H…p interactions17 between the p electron density of the phenyl ring and adjacent pyridyl C11– H11A with the distance of 3.690(4) A˚ (Fig. S3, ESI{). Structure description of [Cd2(ip)2L1]n (4) X-ray structure analysis reveals that complex 4 is a 3D pillared layered framework. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, the asymmetric unit of complex 4 consists of two Cd(II) cations, two ip dianions and one L1 molecule. The two Cd(II) cations are six-coordinated by five carboxyl O atoms and one pyridyl N atom and display octahedron geometry. Different from the above four complexes, the two ip dianions in the present complex act in a more complicated m4 (k2O:k1O:k1O:k1O) coordination mode and bridge adjacent Cd(II) cations into a 2D double layer (Fig. 4b) which can be understood in the following manner. Firstly, the m2 (k2O:k1O) carboxyl links adjacent two Cd(II) cations to form a dinuclear unit, which is further linked by the m2 (k1O:k1O) carboxyl to generate a 1D helical chain along the [010] direction. The adjacent Cd…Cd distances in the helical chain are 3.822(9) (m2 (k2O:k1O) carboxyl bridged) and 3.997(7) A˚ (m2 (k1O:k1O) carboxyl bridged), respectively. Subsequently, adjacent helical chains are bridged by the phenyl rings, giving rise to the 2D double layer. Meanwhile, the p…p stacking interactions between the phenyl rings with the centroid-to-centroid distances of 3.560(6) (C2-containing phenyl ring) and 3.563(8) A˚ (C10- containing phenyl ring) further intensify the stability of the 2D double layer (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the L1 molecules act as ‘pillars’ and extend the 2D layer into a 3D pillared layered framework as shown in Fig. 4c. Structure description of [Mn(ip)L2(H2O)]n?nCH3OH (5) As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the asymmetric unit of complex 5 consists of one Mn(II) cation, one ip dianion, one L2 molecule, one coordinated water molecule and one free methanol molecule. The Mn(II) cation is six-coordinated and displays slightly distorted octahedron geometry. The ip dianion acts in a m3 (k1O:k1O:k1O) coordination mode to bridge adjacent Mn(II) cations into a 1D double chain along the [010] direction (Fig. S4, ESI{), which incorporates alternate eight-membered Mn2C2O4 rings and sixteen-membered Mn2C10O4 rings. The Mn…Mn distances in the two types of rings are 5.073(2) (Mn1i…Mn1iv) and 7.911(2) A˚ (Mn1i…Mn1iv), respectively. Meanwhile, the L2 molecules connect adjacent double chains to form the 2D (4,4) layer by considering the above-mentioned Mn2C2O4 units as four-connected nodes (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, the free methanol molecules insert into the adjacent layers and interconnect adjacent layers into a 3D supramolecular network through the hydrogen-bonding interactions with the coordinated water molecules (O1w) and uncoordinated carboxylic oxygen atoms (O2) (Fig. S5, ESI{). Structure description of M(ip)L2(H2O)]n?nH2O [M = Co (6) and Ni (7)] X-ray structure analyses reveal that complexes 6 and 7 are isomorphous and racemic twins.

As illustrated in Fig. 6a, the asymmetric unit of complex 6 consists of one Co(II) cation, two half ip dianions, one L2 molecule, one coordinated water molecule and one free water molecule. The Co(II) cation is six-coordinated and displays a slightly distorted octahedron geometry. In comparison with complex 5, the two ip dianions act in different m2 (k1O:k1O) and m2 (k1O:k1O:k1O:k1O) coordination modes to bridge adjacent Co(II) cations into different 1D linear chain motifs along the [110] and [11¯0] directions, respectively. The L2 molecules interconnect these chain motifs along the a-axis, thus generating the intricate 3D coordination framework (Fig. 6b). Alternatively, this framework can be understood in the following manner. While neglecting one of the ip dianions, the other one and L2 bridge adjacent Co(II) cations to form a 3D porous framework with the channels along the [011] direction. The channels are too large to accommodate the other three identical nets, causing the 4-fold interpenetration of the networks by self-clathration as shown in Fig. 6c. Subsequently, the neglected ip dianions connect the 4-fold interpenetrated nets to form the above- mentioned intricate 3D coordination framework. Moreover, the free water molecules fill in the small channels of the 3D framework along the [100] direction and connect to the frame- work through the hydrogen-bonding interactions (Fig. S6 and Table S2, ESI{). A better insight into the nature of this intricate framework can be achieved by the application of a topological approach. As depicted above, each Co(II) cation can be regarded as being a 4-connected node, and the ip dianions and L2 molecules are Fig. 5 (a) Molecular structure of complex 5.

An analysis by TOPOS418 reveals that the network of complex 6 is a 4-connected tcb net with the Schla¨fli symbol of 86 (Fig. 6d, Fig. S7, ESI{). Structure description of [Zn3(ip)2(OH)2(L2)2]n (8) An X-ray structure study performed on complex 8 reveals that it is a racemic twin and presents a 3D coordination framework based on the linkage of 6-connected Zn(II) centers by ip dianions and L2 molecules. The content and topology of complex 8 is definitely different from those of complexes 6 and 7. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, the asymmetric unit of 8 consists of three Zn(II) cations, one ip dianion, two half ip dianions, two hydroxyl groups and two L2 molecules. The three Zn(II) cations exhibit three types of coordination geometry. Zn1 has a distorted tetrahedron arrange- ment with a coordination sphere provided by two carboxyl O atoms, one hydroxyl O atom, one pyridyl N atom, as well as a longer contact to O6 atom (2.728(5) A˚ ). Zn2 is six-coordinated by two carboxyl O atoms, two hydroxyl O atoms and two pyridyl N atoms and displays a slightly distorted octahedron geometry. Zn3 adopts distorted tetrahedron geometry with two carboxyl O atoms, one hydroxyl O atom and one pyridyl N atom. The three ip dianions here act in different m3 (k1O:k1O:k1O), m2 (k1O:k1O:k1O:k1O) and m4 (k1O:k1O:k1O:k1O) coordination modes to bridge adjacent Zn(II) cations into a 3D porous framework with the channels along the [001] direction (Fig. 7b). By considering the carboxyl assisted [Zn3(OH)2] cluster as a 4-connected node, this framework can be represented to be a dmp net with the Schla¨fli symbol of (65?8) (Fig. 7c).18 To the best of our knowledge, only one structure with such topology has been reported to date.19 The aforementioned channels, with diagonal lines approxi- mately 11.3 6 18.7 A˚ (the distance between Zn2 cations), accommodate two L2 molecules which link the two 4-connected nodes of the original 3D framework to build a complicated 3D framework (Fig. 7d). It should be noted that there exist N–H…p interactions between the p electron density of the N4-containing pyridyl ring and adjacent pyridyl N2–H2A with the distance being 3.460(6) A˚ . In fact, the [Zn3(OH)2] clusters are linked by the L2 molecules to form a 2D layer (Fig. S8, ESI{). Therefore, the 3D framework can also be viewed as ip dianions bridging the above 2D layers. From the view of topology, each [Zn3(OH)2] cluster links six other [Zn3(OH)2] clusters by ip dianions and L2 molecules to construct a 6-connected net. An analysis by TOPOS418 reveals that the network of complex 8 presents a new topology with the Schla¨fli symbol of (55?69?7) (Fig. 7e). Fig. 7 (a) Molecular structure of complex 8.

View Article Online Coordination conformations of the two bis(pyridyl) ligands Table 2 lists the conformations of the two bis(pyridyl) ligands in the present eight complexes. Owing to the flexibility of the two ligands, two pyridyl rings can rotate freely around the –CH2– NH– spacer with different angles to form syn- and anti- conformations (Scheme 2), which exhibit the special ability to coordinate to metal centers leading to interesting structure motifs. Structural analyses indicate that the L1 and L2 molecules exhibit syn-conformation when the H atom of the NH group forms hydrogen-bonding (in complexes 1–5) or N–H…p inter- actions (N1 containing molecule in complex 8), which limit the flexibility of the two molecules. By contrast, while the H atom of the NH group is not involved in any supramolecular forces, the ligand exhibits anti-conformation (in complexes 6, 7 and the N4 containing molecule in complex 8). The M(II)…M(II) distances bridged by the L2 molecules are evidently longer than those bridged by the L1 molecules. Meanwhile, the M(II)…M(II) distances bridged by anti-conformational L2 molecules are somewhat shorter than syn-conformational bridged L2 mole- cules (Table 2). Apparently, the torsion angles of the two types of conformations are different from each other (Table 2). For the syn-conformation, the torsion angles are smaller than 90u and range from 58.07 to 89.40u. However, the torsion angles in the anti-conformation are nearly close to 180u (164.30u in complex 6, 165.65u in complex 7 and 159.43u for the N4-containing molecule in complex 8). Moreover, it is found that the anti-conformation is easier than the syn to generate higher dimensional motifs, such as the 3D frameworks in complexes 6, 7 and 8. Therefore, the conformations of the two flexible ligands have an effective influence on the formation of structures and topological frame- works of the final complexes. Meanwhile, these results demon- strate that the flexible bi(pyridyl) ligands with an unsymmetrical spacer can also form novel architectures with new topologies as observed in the complexes constructed from flexible or rigid 4,49-bpy like molecules with symmetrical spacers. Effect of the ip dianion on the structures The ip dianion acts as a key role in determining the structures of the resultant complexes. As shown in Scheme S1 (ESI{) and Table 3, the ip dianion exhibits different coordination modes in these eight complexes, which results in complexes with different structures and topologies. In complexes 1, 2 and 3, the ip dianions exhibit modes B (1 and 2) and A (3) and connect adjacent M(II) cations into a 1D linear chain. These chains are further extended by the L1 and L2 molecules to form the 1D ‘ladder’ chain (complex 1) and 2D (4,4) layer (complexes 2 and 3). The ip dianions in complexes 6 and 7 present coordination modes A and C, linking adjacent Co(II) or Ni(II) cations into a 1D linear chain, which is further interconnected through the L2 molecules to form the 3D tcb net. In complex 5, the ip dianions exhibit mode D and connect adjacent Mn(II) cations into a 1D double chain, which is also extended by the L2 molecules to form the 2D (4,4) layer. By contrast, the ip dianion with an intricate coordination mode F connects adjacent Cd(II) cations in complex 4 to form the 2D double layer motif. Then, the bridging L1 molecules extend the double layer into the 3D pillared layered framework. In complex 8, the three ip dianions present different coordination modes C, D and E, which connect the Zn(II) cations to form a 3D dmp net with 1D channels. The L2 molecules fill in the channels and extend the net into an intricate 3D framework with the new Schla¨fli symbol of (55?69?7). Accordingly, we can see that the different coordination modes of the ip dianion can bridge metal cations to form diverse structural motifs and further influence the final structures of the complexes. Influence of metal cations on the structures Complexes 1–8 are all synthesized under similar conditions except for using different metal cations. Therefore, the structural diversities of the eight complexes are influenced by the metal cations besides the conformations of L1 and L2 ligands and coordination modes of ip dianions. According to the different N-heterocyclic ligand involved, the eight complexes can be divided into two series (series I covering 1–4, series II covering 5– 8), in which the five different metal cations present different coordination environments, coordination geometries, and metal radii. Such differences among the five different metal cations cause the structural diversities. The different coordination environments of the metal cations will undoubtedly influence the structures of the complexes owing to the different types and numbers of ligands coordinated to the metal cations. For example, although the metal cations in complexes 1 and 2 of series I have the same octahedral geometry and similar radii, they exhibit different structures which may be attributed to the different coordination environments of the metal cations. The two terminal molecules in complex 1 (two water molecules for Mn1, one water molecule and one L1 molecule for Mn2) make the Mn(II) cations a ‘T-shaped’ environment and results in a 1D ‘ladder’ chain.

Downloaded by Universitat Politècnica de València on 25/10/2014 04:06:17. View Article Online there is only one terminal water molecule around the Co(II) cation in complex 2. Thus, the crisscross environments of the Co(II) cations lead to the formation of the 2D (4,4) layer. For the same metal cation, such influence is more clear. In complexes 1 and 5, the Mn(II) cations present the same octahedral geometry and radii. However, the Mn(II) cation in complex 5 is only coordinated by one terminal water molecule, which generates the 2D (4,4) layer in complex 5. Furthermore, the different coordination geometries of the metal ions also play an important role on the structural diversities of the complexes as a result of different connection directions and connection numbers between metal cations. Complexes 1 and 3 exhibit different 1D ‘ladder’ chain and 2D (4,4) layer structures because of their different connection numbers, while complexes 5, 6 and 7 exhibit different 2D (4,4) layer and 3D tcb net structures because of the different connection directions of the same ‘‘effective’’ connection numbers (Table 3). Similarly, the same metal cation can also generate different structures. In complexes 2 and 6, although the Co(II) cations have the same ‘‘effective’’ connection numbers, the 2D (4,4) layer and 3D tcb net structures are formed due to the different connection directions. Besides, the metal radius can also influence the structures of complexes. For example, although the Zn(II) cation and Cd(II) cation in complexes 3 and 4 are all coordinated by the bridging ligands, their different metal radius result in different coordination geometries and coordination environments, thus generating different 2D (4,4) layer and 3D pillared layered framework structures. As discussed above, one can draw the conclusion that the metal cations are responsible for the structural diversities of the complexes. IR spectroscopy The IR spectra of the eight complexes exhibiting no CLO vibration band of isophthalic acid at around 1700 cm21 confirm the complete de-protonation of the carboxyl groups.20 The peaks observed at the range of 1615–1581 cm21 for these complexes are assigned to the stretching bands of nas(COO2), while the peaks observed at the range of 1438–1375 cm21 can be assigned to the stretching bands of ns(COO2). The stretching bands of the nC–N and nC–O appear in the range of 1338–1267 cm21 and 1166–1031 cm21 in the IR spectra of the eight complexes, respectively. The absorptions observed at 3332 cm21 for 1, 3326 cm21 for 2, 3328 cm21 for 3, 3321 cm21 for 4, 3323 cm21 for 5, 3294 cm21 for 6, 3304 cm21 for 7, 3338 cm21 for 8 can be attributed to the nN–H stretching band of the spacer of –CH2–NH– in the L1 and L2 ligands. In addition, the broad bands in the area of 3430 to 3400 cm21 represent O–H stretching modes within the free and coordinated water molecules, methanol and hydroxyl or the formation of hydrogen-bonding interactions in complexes 1, 2 and 5–8, respectively. Luminescent property Metal–organic coordination complexes with d10 configuration (such as Zn(II) and Cd(II)) are of great interest because of their potential application in chemical optical sensors, photosensitiza- tion and electroluminescent devices. In order to probe the influence of the ligands on the photo behaviors of the complexes, herein the luminescent properties of complexes 3, 4 and 8, the free ligands L1 and L2, as well as the H2ip in the solid-state at room temperature were investigated, in which the H2ip displays an emission band at 382 nm (lex = 340 nm). This value is nearly close to the reported value of 379 nm.21 As shown in Fig. 8, upon excitation at 328 nm, free ligand L1 and complexes 3 and 4 exhibit emission maximums at 380, 367 and 363 nm, respectively, while free ligand L2 and complex 8 exhibit emission maximums at 420 and 415 nm upon excitation at 352 and 340 nm. As known to all, the d10 configured Zn(II) and Cd(II) cations are electrochemically inert, and therefore, when coordinated by ligands, they cannot accept an electron from the ligand with their d-orbitals, nor donate an electron to the ligand. This being the case, the emissions of complexes 3, 4 and 8 are preferably ascribed to ligand-centered transitions rather than ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) or metal-to- ligand charge transfer (MLCT).22 Owing to the resemblance of the emission spectra among the complexes, H2ip and L1/L2, the origin of the emissive behavior of the three complexes is plausibly ascribed to p*–p electronic transitions within the molecular orbitals of the phenyl rings of the H2ip ligands and/or the pyridyl rings of the L1 and L2 ligands. Conclusions In summary, eight mixed-ligand metal–organic coordination complexes with 1D ‘ladder’ chain, 2D (4,4) layers, 3D pillared Fig. 8 (a) Emission spectra of complexes 3 and 4 in the solid-state at room temperature (inset: emission spectrum of L1).

View Article Online layered network, 3D tcb net and 3D (55?69?7) net have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions by the reaction of H2ip, a flexible bis(pyridyl) ligand with unsymmetrical spacer and transition metal cations. The structural diversities indicate that the versatile coordination modes of the ip dianions, conformations of L1 and L2, as well as the nature of the metal cations play important roles in modulating the formation of structures and topologies of resulting coordination complexes. Moreover, complexes 3, 4 and 8 exhibit strong blue emission at room temperature. This study demonstrates that the bis(pyridyl) ligands with an unsymmetrical spacer are prone to form crystals with non-centrosymmetric space groups (complexes 2 and 6–8) in comparison with the crystals containing symmetrical bis(pyridyl) ligands.13,14 Further investigation on the syntheses, structures and properties of mixed-ligand metal–organic coordination complexes containing bis(pyridyl) ligands with an unsymmetrical spacer are underway in our laboratory.

As shown in Fig. S10, the TGA curve indicates that complex 1 loses the lattice and coordinated water molecules from 50 to 157 °C with the observed weight loss of 8.24% (calcd 8.18%). The following gradually weigh losses correspond to the loss of the organic components occurs in the temperature range 265-870 °C. The remaining component corresponds to Mn2O3 (obsd 17.64%, calcd 17.93%). The weight loss corresponding to the release of the coordinated water molecules is observed from 70 to 180 °C (obsd 4.01%, calcd 4.23%) in complex 2. The following weight loss completes at 468 °C, leading to the formation of CoO as the residue (obsd 17.21%, calcd 17.58%). Complex 3 exhibits nearly one step loss with the decomposing of organic components occuring in the temperature range 230-650 °C, and the final remaining component is ZnO (obsd 19.82%, calcd 19.62%). The decomposing of organic components in complex 4 occurs between 304 and 730 °C with the remaining component being CdO (obsd 34.58%, calcd 34.79%). Complex 5 loses the free methanol and coordinated water molecules from 54 to 185 °C with the observed weight loss of 11.14% (calcd 11.02%). Then, the following weight loss with the decomposing of organic components occurs in the temperature range 348-864 °C, and the final remaining component is Mn2O3 (obsd 17.16%, calcd 17.37%). Complexes 6 and 7 exhibit the similar loss steps. The first step corresponds to the loss of lattice and coordinated water molecules in the temperature range 58-192 °C for 6 and 58-192 °C for 7 (obsd 8.01% for 6 and 8.08% for 7, calcd 8.11% for 6 and 7). Then, the following weight loss with the decomposing of organic components occurs in the temperature range 360-464 °C (complex 6) and 380-473 °C (complex 7), and the final remaining component corresponds to CoO (obsd 16.63%, calcd 16.86%) and NiO (obsd 17.06%, calcd 16.82%), respectively. Complex 8 also exhibits nearly one step loss with the decomposing of organic components occuring in the temperature range 202-524 °C, and the final remaining component is ZnO (obsd 26.37%, calcd 26.29%).
