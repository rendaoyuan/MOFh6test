Manuscript A lacuna in reticular chemistry: an unprecedented binodal (6,10)-connected network based on two distinct zinc clusters† Jie Qin, Chao Qin,* Cui-Xia Wang, Huan Li, Ling Cui, Ting-Ting Li and Xin-Long Wang* Received 20th June 2010, Accepted 3rd September 2010 DOI: 10.1039/c0ce00582g The ﬁrst binodal (6,10)-connected metal–organic network, based on an octahedral binuclear zinc cluster as a six-connected node and a dodecahedral pentanuclear zinc cluster as a ten-connected node, deﬁnes a new topology for three-periodic nets that is not only unobserved in crystal structures, but also unenumerated in electronic topological databases. Current interest in coordination polymer frameworks not only stems from their potential applications in microelectronics, non-linear optics, porous materials, and catalysis, but also from their intriguing variety of molecular architectures and topologies.1 An important subject within this area is the study and analysis of network topology, which is not only a powerful tool for simplifying structure of complicated compounds but also plays an instructive role in the rational design of certain functional materials with desirable prop- erties. To date, network topologies in coordination polymers have been discussed in several notable reviews2 following a seminal compilation by Wells decades ago.3 The analysis of data for existing materials reveals that the nets with high frequency are topologically symmetrical and, in particular, have small numbers of kinds of nodes and edges,4 such as 3-connected srs, 4-connected dia, and 6-connected pcu nets. Compared to these commonly encountered topologies, the development of higher connectivity nets, with neither high-symmetry nor low-symmetry structures, is still in its early stages, which can be attributed, at least partially, to the limited coordination numbers of single metal centers and steric hindrance of the most commonly used organic ligands. For binodal structures, it is even more difﬁcult to construct three-periodic nets with two kinds of high-connected nodes. 28 three-periodic nets with two kinds of vertex have identiﬁed by O’Keeffe et al.,5 however, out of them there are only four nets with node degrees both larger-than or equal-to six, namely (6,6)-connected nia, (6,8)-connected ocu, and (6,12)-connected alb, mgc. More recently, a most comprehensive analysis by Blatov and Proserpio reveals that only 18 binodal nets (0.39%) containing two 6–12-coor- dinated nodes are found (one alb and 17 nia nets) among the 2131 three-dimensional metal–organic polymeric frameworks and 2473 hydrogen-bonded organic and metal–organic frameworks.6 Thus, it can be seen that the construction of binodal nets with high coordi- nation numbers is still a challenging issue in coordination chemistry. One promising approach for the creation of highly connected topology is to use polynuclear metal cluster as nodes; their large surface areas means that they can more readily accommodate the steric demands of organic linkers.7 Borrowing ideas from triazole- metal coordination chemistry,8 where because of the position of the donor atoms in the ﬁve-membered ring, the triazole ligands possess the possibility of linking metal ions together, and thereby constitute a bridge between the metal ions, we chose 1,2,4-triazole (Htrz) as an initial object of study to generate high-nuclearity metal clusters. Additionally, introduction of small triazole ligands to second building units may be of interdisciplinary interest from the point of view of sorption properties, magnetic properties, and spin-crossover proper- ties. Meanwhile, to ensure the articulation of the clusters into an extended three-dimensional framework, a rigid linker, isophthalic acid (H2pt), is used concurrently. Herein we report, for the ﬁrst time, a binodal (6,10)-connected network based on an octahedral binuclear zinc cluster as a six-connected node, and a dodecahedral pentanuclear zinc cluster as a ten-connected node. To the best of our knowledge, this net deﬁnes a completely new topology for three-periodic nets that is not only unobserved in organic, inorganic and metal–organic compounds, but also unenumerated in the databases EPINET, RCSR and TTD,9 consequently ﬁlling a lacuna for binodal coordi- nation nets. A three-letter symbol for this net is still waiting for assignment. The reaction of Zn(NO3)2$4H2O with mixed ligands H2pt and Htrz under hydrothermal conditions resulted in a homogeneous microcrystalline materials.‡ The as-synthesized compound was characterized and formulated by elemental microanalysis and single- crystal X-ray diffraction studiesx as [Zn7(trz)6(pt)4(H2O)2]$12H2O (1). Single-crystal X-ray analysis shows that the structure of 1 contains two distinct zinc cluster, i.e. a dinuclear [Zn2(CO2)2N2(trz)2] cluster with non-bonding Zn/Zn distances of 3.757(5) A and a pentanu- clear [Zn5(CO2)6(trz)4] cluster with non-bonding Zn/Zn distances of 3.754(4) and 3.921(4) A (Fig. 1). In the pentanuclear cluster, there are three crystallographically independent Zn atoms, Zn(1), Zn(2), and Zn(3). The Zn(1) atom lies on a crystallographic inversion center and coordinates to two nitrogen atoms (Zn–N 2.168(3) A) from two trz ligands, two carboxylate oxygen atoms (Zn–O 2.226(3) A) from two independent pt ligands, and two aqua ligands (Zn–O 2.130(3) A) giving a distorted octahedral geometry. The Zn(2) and Zn(3) atoms, related to their crystallographically equivalent atoms by the symmetry operation ‘1  x, 1  y, 1  z’, exist in a distorted tetra- hedral geometry but lie in different types of coordination environ- ments: the Zn(2) atom is ligated by three nitrogen atoms from three trz ligands (Zn–N 1.994(4)–2.039(3) A) and one carboxylate oxygen from a pt ligand (Zn–O 2.034(3) A), whereas the Zn(3) atom is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two trz ligands Key Laboratory of Polyoxometalates Science of Ministry of Education, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China.

In contrast, the dinuclear cluster only contains one crystallographically independent Zn atom, Zn(4), that exhibits a tetrahedral geometry bonded by three nitrogen atoms (Zn–N 1.989(4)–2.014(3) A) from three trz ligands and one oxygen atom from a pt ligand (Zn–O 1.944(4) A), and is related to its crys- tallographically equivalent atom by the symmetry operation ‘1  x, 1  y, z’. Moreover, two coordination modes for the pt ligands have been found: one is bis(monodentate) and the other is mono- dentate-bidentate (ESI, Scheme S1).† As depicted in Fig. 1, a penta- nuclear zinc cluster is surrounded by six trz ligands and four pt ligands in all. This, therefore, from the topological point of view, deﬁnes a ten-connected node. Likewise, a binuclear zinc cluster is surrounded by four trz ligands and two pt ligands, thus deﬁning a six-connected node. As a result, the 3D structure that is formed adopts an unprecedented binodal (6,10)-connected topology with the short Schl€aﬂi symbol of (34$48$53)(38$420$512$65), in which each pen- tazinc core is linked to ten nearest-neighbours (six {Zn5} and four {Zn2} clusters) and each dizinc core is linked to six nearest-neigh- bours (six {Zn5} clusters) with distances of 7.650–12.802 A (centre to centre). The maximum symmetry net for this topology (with links equal to 2) is monoclinic C2/m (a ¼ 1.602, b ¼ 1.236, c ¼ 1.568, b ¼ 102.56) with the vertices at 0,0,0 and 0,0.5,0.5 (see ESI).† The augmented net is made up of linked octahedra and dodecahedra where the two polyhedra are achieved by connecting the carboxylate C atoms of pt and the imidazole N atoms of trz bound to each zinc clusters (Fig. 2). The natural tiles are [34$42] and [32$44], in the ratio 1 : 2. To aid understanding this intricate structure, the new approaches to the analysis of highly connected frameworks proposed by Hill et al.,10 are applied, namely visualization of the structures as combi- nations of interconnected 2D sheets or subnet tectons instead of considering 3D structures solely in terms of topology via ‘‘Schl€aﬂi’’ symbols. Based on the above strategy, the familiar six-connected pcu (a-Po) net can be described as being formed from parallel 44-nets with each center providing two links to centers in adjacent nets, one on each side ([4 + 2] model for short, see Fig. 3a); a ten-connected gpu net reported recently by our group can be described as being formed from parallel 36-nets with each center providing four links to centers in adjacent nets, two on each side ([6 + 4] model for short, see Fig. 3b).11 As far as the net of 1 is concerned, it contains both six- and ten-connected nodes, and thus can be described as being formed from parallel (32$42$52)(34$44$54$63)-nets with each four-connected center providing two links to centers in adjacent nets, one on each side, and each six-connected center providing four links to centers in adjacent nets, two on each side ([4 + 2] and [6 + 4] model for short, see Fig. 3c). Another visual insight into the nature of this unusual (6,10)-con- nected net can be obtained by considering the net derived from a pcu net that is intersected every other cube by parallel 44-nets at approximately 79 along the [110] direction (Fig. 4). Another noteworthy aspect of this structure is the fact that it is indeed an open 3D pillared network in which 2D [Zn7(trz)6]n sheets are pillared by pt ligands (Fig. 5). The framework has interlayer spaces (volume of the void Vvoid ¼ 25%), affording 1D channels along the c axis with window dimensions of 6.9  4.2 A that are occupied by solvent water molecules. TG curve of 1 indicates that a weight loss of 14.28% occurs between 110 C and 170 C, which corresponds to the loss of all the guest water molecules (expected 14.20%) to give the dehydrated from [Zn7(trz)6(pt)4]. The guest-free framework has a stability range of 170 C to 360 C, as evidenced by the fact that no additional weight loss was observed at those temperatures, after which the framework eventually decomposes (ESI, Fig. S1).† The emission spectrum of compound 1 in solid state at room temperature is depicted in ESI, Fig. S2.† It can be observed that an Fig. 1 The binuclear and pentanuclear zinc clusters within 1, which can be viewed as an octahedral (top) and a dodecahedral (bottom) building units, respectively.

To understand more thoroughly the nature of the emission band, we analyzed the photoluminescence properties of H2pt and Htrz ligands. The investigation revealed that the free H2pt ligand exhibits an emission at 385 nm upon excitation at 327 nm, corresponding to the p* / n transitions,12 while solid Htrz ligand is nearly non-ﬂuorescent at room temperature. Thus, the origin of the emission might be attributable to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). In conclusion, the ﬁrst binodal (6,10)-connected metal–organic network, based on binuclear zinc clusters as six-connected nodes and pentanuclear zinc clusters as ten-connected nodes, has been synthe- sized and its luminescent property characterized. The intrinsic value of the present research lies in use of simple triazole ligands to induce metal ions into high-nuclearity clusters. Hence, it is believed that this study will open up a promising way to construct high-connectivity networks.
