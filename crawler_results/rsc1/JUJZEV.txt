Compound 1 shows a layer structure in which chains containing alternatively arranged Co3O2 trimers and Co2 dimers are connected by pbtc5- ligands. The 1,2-bix co-ligand adopts a cis- mode, and coordinates to the cobalt atoms from the same chain. Upon dehydration, compound 1 experiences a single crystal-to-single crystal (SC–SC) structural transformation forming a new crystal phase Co5(1,2-bix)2(pbtc)2(H2O)4 (1a). The process is reversible on re-hydration, showing a breathing effect. In compounds 2 and 3, similar layers composed of cobalt phosphonate chains and pbtc5- linkages are also found, which are further cross-linked by 1,3-bix or 1,4-bix into 3D framework structures. The three compounds show different microporosities, as confirmed by the different N2 gas adsorption behaviors. Introduction Crystalline microporous metal-organic frameworks or coordination polymers are of increasing importance because of their potentials to be used in gas storage and separation,1 catalysis,2 drug delivery3 and proton conduction etc.4 Metal phosphonates often show high thermal and water stabilities and thus are promising in developing new porous materials for application purpose. Unfortunately, most of the metal phosphonates reported so far display layered or pillared layered structures without permanent porosity.5 In order to achieve porosity, an efficient route is to introduce smaller spacers into the pillared layered structures. However, this route resulted in a series of unconventional porous materials which are almost amorphous.6 Crystalline microporous metal phosphonates with permanent porosity are still sparse.7 Two approaches are commonly used to obtain such materials: (i) through direct reaction of metal salts with an appropriate phosphonic acid; (ii) through incorporation of co–ligands or templates. Elegant examples include STA–12,8 MIL–919 and STA–1610 with pore sizes 3-18 Å, where N,N ′ – piperazinebismethylenephosphonate and a related N,N′–4,4 ′ –bipiperidinebis(methylenephosphonic acid) are used. Another phosphonic acid with tetrahedral geometry, e.g. 1,3,5,7–tetrakis(4–phosphonatophenyl) adamantine, results in a copper compound with permanent porosity.11 Shimizu et al found that phosphonate monoesters can balance crystallinity and permanent porosity to produce porous hybrid materials.12 More recently, we employed 5-phosphonatophenyl-1,2,4- tricarboxylic acid (pbtcH5, Scheme 1) to react with cobalt salts in the presence of rigid 2,2’-bipyridine or 1,10-phenanthroline co-ligands.13,14 Microporous product was achieved successfully through a post-synthetic thermal treatment of the nonporous precursor of Co2(pbtcH)(2,2’-bpy)2(H2O).13 It is noted that metal phosphonates incorporating flexible N-donor co-linkers have rarely been described.15 In particular, the influence of the positional isomerism of co-linkers on the microporosity of these materials has never been documented.

In this paper, we report three new mixed-ligated cobalt phosphonates namely Co5(1,2-bix)2(pbtc)2(H2O)4·8H2O (1), Co5(1,3-bix)2(pbtc)2(H2O)4·7.5H2O (2), and Co5(1,4- bix)2(pbtc)2(H2O)4·6H2O (3) (pbtcH5 = 5-phosphonatophenyl- 1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid), where flexible 1,2-bis(imidazol-1- ylmethyl)-benzene (1,2-bix), 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)- benzene (1,3-bix) and 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-benzene Page 2 of 7 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 31 July 2015.

Compound 1 shows a layer structure, while compounds 2 and 3 display 3D open framework structures. In all cases, the inorganic chains are found, which are further linked by the phosphonate and secondary organic bridging ligands. More interestingly, the microporosity of these materials can be modulated by positional isomerism of the co-ligands. Experimental Section Materials and methods All reagents were commercially available and were used as received. The ligand pbtcH5 was synthesized following a similar procedure in the literature.16 Elemental analyses were performed in an Elementar Vario MICRO elemental analyzer. The room temperature infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vector 27 instrument. The powder X–ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected on a Bruker D8 advance X–ray diffractometer with Cu–Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out on a Mettler– Toledo TGA/DSC1 instrument in the range of 25–800 °C under a nitrogen flow at a rate of 10 °C/min. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured by BELSORP- max volumetric adsorption equipment. Syntheses of 1-3 Compounds 1-3 were synthesized following a similar procedure except using different bix co-ligands. Thus a typical procedure for the synthesis of 1 is described. A mixture of CoCl2·6H2O (0.15 mmol, 0.0248 g), pbtcH5(0.05 mmol, 0.0145 g), 1,2-bix (0.1 mmol, 0.024g) and H2O (8 mL) was stirred for 0.5 h and adjusted to pH ≈ 7 with 0.1 M piperazidine, placed in a 25 mL Teflon–lined stainless steel vessel. The mixture was sealed and heated at 160 °C for 72 h, and then the reaction system was cooled to room temperature. Blue lamellar crystals were obtained with a yield of 36.7% (based on pbtcH5).

Single-crystal structure determination Single crystals with dimensions of 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.08 mm3 for 1, 0.3 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm3 for 2 and 0.18 × 0.12 × 0.08 mm3 for 3 were selected for structural determination at 173 K on a Bruker X–ray APEX Duo CCD diffractometer using a graphite monochromated Mo–Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data collection for compound 1a was achieved by the in-situ thermal treatment of a single crystal of 1 (0.7 × 0.15 × 0.1 mm3) with a heating rate of 6 oC min-1 to 373 K and then kept at the same temperature during the measurement. Data were collected in the θ ranges of 2.01-26.00° for 1, 1.40-26.00° for 1a, 1.34-26.00° for 2, and 1.38-26.00° for 3. The numbers of observed and unique reflections are 10308 and 5435 (Rint = 0.027) for 1, 9428 and 5191 (Rint = 0.051) for 1a, 22316 and 10808 (Rint = 0.041) for 2, and 10459 and 5323 (Rint = 0.055) for 3, respectively. The Siemens SAINT program was used to integrate the data of all compounds,17 with the intensities corrected for Lorentz factor, polarization, air absorption, and absorption due to variation in the path length through the detector face plate. Empirical absorption corrections were employed. The structures were solved by the direct method and refined on F2 by full–matrix least–squares methods using SHELXTL.18 All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All the hydrogen atoms except those attached to water molecules were put in calculated positions. The hydrogen atoms of water molecules were found from the Fourier maps. The crystallographic data of the four compounds are listed in Table 1. The selected bond lengths and angles are given in Tables S1-S4. Results and discussion Crystal structure of 1 and thermo-induced single crystal-to-single crystal transformation Compound Co5(1,2-bix)2(pbtc)2(H2O)4·8H2O (1) crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1. The asymmetric unit contains 2.5 Co, one pbtc5-, one 1,2-bix, two coordinated and five lattice water molecules. Two lattice water molecules are disordered and the total occupancy of these five lattice water molecules is four. There are three crystallographically distinguished Co atoms. As shown in Figure 1a, both Co1 and Co2 atoms have distorted octahedral environment, while Co3 shows a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The Co1 atom locates at an inversion center. The six coordination sites are occupied by two phosphonate oxygen (O2, O2C) and four carboxylate oxygen (O4, O7A, O7B, O4C) atoms from four equivalent pbtc5- . While the Co2 atom is surrounded by one phosphonate oxygen (O2), two carboxylate oxygen (O4C, O6B) atoms from three Page 3 of 7 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 31 July 2015.

Four sites of the Co3 are occupied by two phosphonate oxygen (O3, O1D), one carboxylate oxygen (O8A) from three equivalent pbtc5- ligands and one nitrogen (N1) atom from 1,2-bix. The Co1-O and Co2-O(N) bond lengths are in the range of 2.047(2)-2.116(2) Å and 2.058(5)-2.273(2) Å, respectively, while the bond lengths of Co3-O(N) are in the range of 1.932(2)-2.002(2) Å. The pbtc5– acts as a nona-dentate ligand, chelating and bridging eight Co atoms through seven of its nine oxygen donors (Scheme 1). The remaining two carboxylate oxygen atoms (O5, O9) are pendent. The phosphonate oxygen O2 and carboxylate oxygen O4 serve as μ3-O bridging the Co1 and Co2 atoms. As a result, each {Co1O6} octahedron is edge-shared with two equivalent {Co2NO5} octahedra, thus forming a trimer of Co3O2. The Co1···Co2 distance within the trimer is 3.144(1) Å. The Co1-O2-Co2 and Co1-O4-Co2 bond angles are 98.7(1) and 91.4(1)o, respectively. The equivalent Co3 atoms are linked by O-P-O units forming a dimer of Co2P2. The Co3···Co3 distance within the dimer is 4.197(1) Å. The Co3O2 trimers and Co2P2 dimers are connected alternatively through O-P-O units, leading to an infinite chain running along the b- axis (Fig. 1b). The Co1···Co3 and Co2···Co3 distances within the chain are 4.506(1) and 6.344(1) Å, and 5.332(1) and 5.357(1) Å, respectively. These chains are connected through pbtc5- ligands, forming a two-dimensional layer in the ab plane (Fig. 1c). The shortest Co···Co distance between the chains is 6.648(5) Å. The 1,2-bix ligands are pendent on the two sides of the layer, and each coordinates to the Co2 and Co3 atoms from the same chain in a cis-mode. Neighboring layers are stacked and stabilized via extensive hydrogen bond interactions among the phosphonate and carboxylate oxygen atoms, the coordination and lattice water molecules to form a three dimensional supramolecular network structure. The π-π stacking is also observed between the phenyl rings of 1,2-bix, with the ring-to-ring and centroid- to-centroid distances of 3.279 Å and 3.671 Å, respectively.

(SC-SC) transformation, and a new phase Co5(1,2- bix)2(pbtc)2(H2O)4 (1a) is obtained, with all lattice water removed. Compound 1a also crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1, but the volume of unit cell shrinks slightly from 1392.3(4) Å3 in 1 to 1347.9(14) Å3 in 1a (Table 1). A layer structure is preserved in structure 1a, which is closely related to that of compound 1. Only small changes of the structural parameters are found (Tables S1-S2). For example, the Co1···Co2 distance and Co1-O-Co2 angles within the trimer are 3.179(2) Å and 101.1(1)o and 92.3(1)o, respectively, which are slightly larger than those in compound 1. But the Co3···Co3 distance [4.083(2) Å] within the Co2P2 dimer becomes a little smaller than that in 1 (Table 2). The most significant difference between the two structures is the stacking of the layers in the lattice. Compared with that in 1, the adjacent layers in 1a are shifted slightly such that the π-π interactions between the phenyl rings of 1,2-bix are destroyed (Fig. 2). Instead, the van der Waals interactions are dominant in compound 1a. The interlayer distance is slightly shortened from 14.8 Å in 1 to 14.5 Å in 1a. Compound 1a can be rehydrated by immersing in pure water for three hours with the recovery of 1, as confirmed by the single-crystal structural determination. Thus the SC-SC transformation between 1 and 1a is reversible during the dehydration and hydration process, showing the breathing effect.19 Figure 2.

Crystal structure of 2 Compound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Pc. The asymmetric unit contains five Co atoms, two pbtc5-, two 1,3- bix, four coordinated and 7.5 lattice water molecules (Figure 3). There are five crystallographically different Co atoms. The Co1, Co2 and Co4 atoms are six-coordinated with distorted Figure 3. (a) The inorganic chain in structure 2. (b) One layer in structure 2 made up of inorganic chains and pbtc5- linkages.

The Co- O(N) bond lengths are 2.053(6)-2.279(7) Å and 1.919(7)- 2.000(9) Å for the octahedral and tetrahedral cobalt atoms, respectively. Like in compound 1, the two crystallographically different pbtc5– ligands each chelates and bridges eight Co atoms (Scheme 1). In this case, however, the phosphonate oxygen (O3, O12) and carboxylate oxygen (O4, O13) atoms serve as μ3- O bridging the cobalt atoms (Co1, Co2, Co4) into a trimer of Co3O2, where the {CoO6} or {CoNO5} octahedra are edge- shared with each other. While the {Co3NO3} and {Co5NO3} tetrahedra are corner-shared with {PO3C} tetrahedra to form a dimer of Co2P2. The Co3O2 trimers and Co2P2 dimers are connected by {PO3C} tetrahedra in an alternative manner forming an infinite chain running along the a-axis (Fig. 3a).

One is trans-mode, linking the Co2P2 dimers from the adjacent layers (Fig. 3d). The other is cis-mode, and links the Co3O2 trimers from the adjacent layers (Fig. 3e). Therefore a three-dimensional framework structure is constructed which generates channels in the a-direction (Fig. 3c). The lattice water molecules fill in the channels, and form extensive hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate oxygen, phosphonate oxygen and water molecules. Crystal structure of 3 Compound 3 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1. The asymmetric unit contains 2.5 Co atoms, one pbtc5-, one 1,4-bix, two coordinated and three lattice water molecules. Three cobalt atoms are crystallographically distinguished. The Co1 atom sits in an inversion center, and the Co2 and Co3 atoms in general positions. Both Co1 and Co2 are octahedrally coordinated [Co-O(N): 2.044(3)-2.237(3) Å], while Co3 shows a distorted tetrahedral geometry [Co-O(N): 1.923(3)-1.992(3)Å]. Infinite chains made up of Co3O2 trimers and Co2P2 dimers are again observed (Fig. 4a), which are cross-linked by pbtc5- ligands into a layer (Fig. 4b). The coordination mode of the pbtc5- ligand is identical to those in compounds 1 and 2. The 1,4-bix adopts a trans-mode and bridges the Co3O2 trimers and Co2P2 dimers from the adjacent layers (Fig. 4c). Hence a three- dimensional framework structure is constructed which contains cavities to fill in the lattice water molecules. Figure 4. (a) The inorganic chain in structure 3. (b) One layer in structure 3 made up of inorganic chains and pbtc5- linkages. (c) Structure 3 packed along the a-axis. All H atoms except those in water molecules are omitted for clarity. Scheme 2. Bridging modes of the bix ligands in compounds 1-3. It is clear that compounds 1-3 contain similar inorganic chains composed of Co3O2 trimers, Co2P2 dimers and {PO3C} tetrahedra. The pbtc5– ligands are nona-dentate chelating and bridging eight Co atoms in a similar manner. Thus the layer topologies are identical in all three cases with slight differences in structural parameters, some of which are given in Table 2. Hence the remarkable difference in structures 1-3 originates from the positional isomerism of the bix co-ligands. In compound 1, the 1,2-bix ligand adopts a cis-mode and bridges the Co3O2 trimer and Co2P2 dimer within the same chain. Thus a layer structure is obtained. In compound 2, the 1,3-bix ligand adopts both cis- and trans-modes to link the layers into a 3D framework. The 1,3-bix in trans-mode links Co2P2 dimers from the adjacent layers. While the 1,3-bix in cis- mode links the Co3O2 trimers from the adjacent layers. In compound 3, the 1,4-bix ligand adopts only trans-mode connecting the Co3O2 trimer and Co2P2 dimer from adjacent layers into a 3D framework. Scheme 2 shows the differences in the bridging modes of bix ligands in compounds 1-3. Apparently, the structures of Co-pbtc system can be modulated by the positional isomerism of the bix co-ligands. Structures 1-3 are remarkably different from those of Co2(pbtcH)(2,2’-bpy)2(H2O) and Co2(pbtcH)(phen)2(H2O), where the same phosphonate ligand is involved.13 The latter show layer structures made up of Co4 tetramers and pbtcH4- linkages. The structural difference is attributed to the different co- ligands, e.g. flexible bridging ligands of bix in compounds 1-3 while rigid terminal ligands of 2,2’-bpy and phen in Co2(pbtcH)(2,2’-bpy)2(H2O) and Co2(pbtcH)(phen)2(H2O). Noting that both compounds 2 and 3 show open-framework structures with the cavities filled with lattice water molecules, the gas adsorption properties are investigated. Adsorption properties Figure 5. The N2 adsorption/desorption curves of 1-3 at 77 K. To measure the gas adsorption properties, compounds 1-3 were activated at 100 oC under vacuum to remove water molecules. The N2 adsorption behaviours were examined at 77 K. It is found that the BET surface areas are 1.56, 3.41, 9.09 (a) (b) (c) Page 6 of 7 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 31 July 2015.

Name., 2012, 00, 1-3 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins m2g-1 and Langmuir surface areas are 2.39, 5.02, 16.19 m2g-1 for compounds 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Figure 5 shows the N2 gas adsorption/desorption isotherms of the three compounds. Obviously, compound 1 shows the lowest uptake of N2, while compound 3 exhibits the highest uptake of N2. It is interesting that the adsorption/desorption curves of compound 3 display a hysteresis when the P/P0 value reaches above 0.48. This reminds us of the gate-opening phenomenon, which has been observed frequently in flexible porous coordination polymers.20 The gas adsorption measurements reveal that the pore sizes, although very small, follows the sequence: 3>2>1. While PLATON calculations based on the single crystal structural data show that the effective free volumes per 2.5 Co are 11.6% (161.5 Å3) for 1, 15.2% (214.5 Å3) for 2 and 13.6% (185.6 Å3) for 3, respectively. Surprisingly, although the free volume of compound 3 is not the largest, it shows the highest uptake of N2 gas at 77 K. A possible reason is that the porosity is well- retained in this compound even after fully dehydration. The poorest adsorption capability of compound 1 can be explained by the dense packing of the layers after dehydration. Indeed, the calculated effective free volume of compound 1a is reduced to 7.2% (97.1 Å3), the smallest among the three compounds. Conclusions We report three new cobalt phosphonates incorporating both 5-phosphonatophenyl-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (pbtcH5) and flexible bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-benzene (bix), namely, Co5(1,2-bix)2(pbtc)2(H2O)4·8H2O (1), Co5(1,3- bix)2(pbtc)2(H2O)4·7.5H2O (2), and Co5(1,4- bix)2(pbtc)2(H2O)4·6H2O (3). Compound 1 can experience an in- situ single crystal-to-single crystal structural transformation in a reversible manner upon dehydration and rehydration. More interestingly, the microporosity of the system can be modulated through the positional isomerism of the bix co- ligands.
