Single-crystal X-ray structures have revealed that these coordination polymers exhibit a structural diversification due to the different choices of metal salts and the effect of pyridyl nitrogen position. 10 Compounds 1-5 exhibited different fluorescence emission and lifetime upon excitation in the solid state. The sensing behavior of these polymers was also investigated upon exposure to vapors of various nitroaromatic molecules (analytes). The results show that all five polymers are capable of sensing these nitroaromatic molecules in the vapor phase through fluorescence quenching. Interestingly, 3 exhibits superior sensitivity to the analytes in comparison with other polymers. 2-Nitrotoluene quenches the 15 emission of 3 by as much as 96%. Introduction Coordination polymers (CPs), known as a fascinating organic- inorganic hybrid material class, are certainly very promising as a multifunctional luminescent material because both the inorganic 20 metal cations (or metal clusters) and the organic linkers can provide the platforms to generate luminescence.1-2 The variety of metal ions, organic ligands, and structural motifs affords an essentially infinite number of combinations.3 Furthermore, both postsynthetic modification and guest molecules can also emit 25 and/or induce luminescence.4 These features enable the electronic nature of luminescent CPs to be tailored for a particular application by varying the lumophore type, secondary building units, and their relative spatial arrangements.5-6 These merits also make them promising candidates for chemical sensing 30 applications.7 Recently fluorescence active CPs have been applied in the detection of hazardous substances,8-9 which is an important area of current research for homeland security, environmental safety, and human health. Developing sensitive and efficient explosive detection methods becomes especially urgent in recent 35 years due to the continuing rise of terrorist activities around the globe. In comparison with well-trained canines10 and sophisticated instrumental methods,11 optical sensing based on fluorescent materials has the advantages of cost effectiveness and portability.12 To tailor MOFs for chemical sensing, some CPs 40 with a specific structure and functionality were constructed by the deliberate design and selection of organic linkers and metal- containing units,13 such as the introduction of guest accessible functional organic groups,14 and the reservation of open metal sites15. The tuned geometry and functionalization of pore may 45 lead to selective adsorption and molecular sensing.7 Motivated by the success of tris(8- hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3) in vacuum-deposited LEDs, the Photoluminescent materials based on 8- hydroxyqunoline complexes have in particular attracted a lot of 50 attentions.16-17 8-hydroxyquinolinate (in its deprotonated form) can bridge the gaps between the neutral bipyridine and the dianionic catecholate because it contains one pyridine donor of bipy and one phenolate unit of catecholate. In addition, the geometry and chelating size of 8-hydroxyquinolinate are the same 55 as found for bipy and catecholate, which are very often used as appropriate building blocks for organic ligands. It has been demonstrated that the 8-hydroxyquinoline unit is an ideal building block in metallosupramolecular chemistry.16-17 With few notable exceptions, 8-hydroxyquinolinate-based coordination 60 polymers with desirable structures and functionalities have not yet been developed.18 In recent years, our research group has reported a series of photoluminescent complexes involving 2-substituted 8- quinolinolate ligands with NO donor set.19 Herein, we have 65 synthesized two bispyridyl-based quinoline ligands from the commercial available 8-hydroxyquinaldine to form five new Zn(II) and Cd(II) coordination polymers, and characterized the five polymers by a variety of techniques, including microanalysis, IR, and powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The 70 polymeric skeletons exhibit a structural diversification, which can be attributed to the different choices of metal salts and the effect of pyridyl nitrogen position. The investigation of their fluorescent properties shows disparate emission wavelengths and lifetimes in the solid state. In addition, we have also studied the applicability 75 of polymers 1-5 for sensing nitroaromatic molecules at room temperature. The results further suggest that both the electronic properties and supramolecular structures of coordination Page 2 of 9 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 14 October 2014.

Results and discussion Synthetic Chemistry The two ligands L1-MOM and L2-MOM (MOM: 5 methoxymethoxy) were synthesized in more than 90% yield by Suzuki coupling reaction between 3- or 4-pyridylboronic acid and 5,7-dibromo-2-methyl-8-methoxymethoxyquinoline. The L2- MOM ligand was fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, ESI- MS, and microanalysis. Single crystals of [Zn3(L1)6] (1), 10 [Zn(L1)2]·2MeOH (2), [Zn(L2)2] (3), [Cd(L2)2] (4), and [Cd4(L1)6]·13H2O (5) were readily obtained in good yield by heating the corresponding Zn(II) or Cd(II) salts and L-MOM in the mixture of MeOH/DMF/H2O (scheme 1). It is notable that an anion-dependent self-assembly behavior was observed in 1 and 2. 15 The –MOM group was completely removed from the starting ligands upon reactions with the metal ions. Coordination polymers 1–5 are stable in air and insoluble in water and common organic solvents, and were formulated on the basis of microanalysis, IR, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction 20 25 30 Scheme 1 Synthesis of ligands L1-MOM, L2-MOM and polymers 1-5. Structural description Single crystals of complex 1 was readily obtained in good yields 35 by heating Zn(OAc)2 and L1-MOM in a mixture of MeOH/DMF. Complex 1 crystallizes in the space group P21/n, with one Zn(II) ion and three L1 ligands in the asymmetric unit. The MOM groups were completely removed from the starting ligands upon complexation with the metal ions. The Zn1 centre is coordinated 40 by two nitrogen atoms from pyridyl groups, two nitrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms from quinoline rings, forming a ZnN4O2 slightly distorted octahedral coordination geometry (Fig. 1a). The bond lengths around Zn1 are 2.0338(3) Å for Zn–O, 2.2213(4) Å and 2.2495(4) Å for Zn–N, respectively. The Zn2 centre is five- 45 coordinated by one nitrogen atom of pyridyl group, two oxygen and two nitrogen atoms from two quinoline rings to result in a distorted trigonal biyramid coordination geometry (Fig. 1a). The distances of Zn-N and Zn-O bonds around Zn2 are 2.0887(4) – 2.2599(3) Å and 1.9336(2) –1.9612(2) Å, respectively. 50 In 1, six L1 ligands with eight uncoordinated pyridyl groups connect four Zn cations (two Zn1 and two Zn2 atoms) to form a cyclic tetramer Zn4(L1)6 (Fig. 1b), which is further linked into a 1D infinite chain along the crystallographic a-axis. The spacious nature of one single chain allows another two independent 55 identical chains to penetrate it in a normal mode, thus giving a 3- fold interpenetrated architecture (Fig. 1c and S3). The interdigitation of uncoordinated pyridyl rings from adjacent square grids has efficiently filled all the void space; No any solvent molecules are encapsulated in 1.

A single-crystal X-ray diffraction study shows that compound 2 is a 2D network, with one crystallographically independent Zn(II) ion, one L1 ligand and one uncoordinated CH3OH molecule in the asymmetric unit. It 5 crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c. Similar to 1, the MOM groups were also removed. The metal center Zinc is six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from pyridyl groups, two oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms from quinoline rings, showing a slightly distorted octahedral coordination geometry 10 (Fig. 3a). The bond lengths around Zn centre are 2.0199(2) Å for Zn-O, 2.2221(2) Å and 2.2428(2) Å for Zn-N, respectively. The Zn(II) metal centers are bridged by L1 ligands to form a 2D square grid in the bc plane (Fig. 3b). It is notable that a kind of meso-helical chains (P+M) constructed via the metal-ligand 15 coordination interactions are observed in the solid state of this compound (Fig. 4a). These meso-helical chains with a pitch of 10.2951(14) Å are alternately arranged along b axis, which is identical to the b axis length. The 2D layers are further stacked into 3D supramolecular structure (Fig. 4b) via nonclassical C- 20 H…N hydrogen bonds (C-H…N: 3.3489(4) Å) between the C-H group and nitrogen atom from the pyridyl group (Fig. S4). There is significant void space formed between the lamellae, and a space-filling model of 2 viewed along the a axis clearly indicates the presence of large channels with a largest dimension of 5.3 Å 25 (Fig. S5). PLATON calculations indicate that complex 2 contains 12.8% void space (222.0 Å3 per unit cell) that is accessible to solvent molecules. 30 35 40 45 50 Fig. 3 (a) View of the coordination geometries of Zn(II) atoms in 2; (b) 2D square grid of 2 in the bc plane (MeOH molecules are indicated by space-filling mode). 55 60 65 Fig. 4 (a) The meso-helical chains (P+M) constructed via the metal-ligand coordination interactions in 2; (b) View of 3D supramolecular structure in 2. 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 Fig. 5 (a) View of the coordination geometries of Cd(II) atoms in 4; (b) 105 2D square grid of 4 in the bc plane.

The coordination environment of Cd 2+ ions in complex 4 is shown in Fig. 5a, and it can be seen that Cd(II) is six-coordinated to two phenolate oxygen atoms and four nitrogen atoms from four ligands L2. The Cd(II) center adopts a octahedral 5 geometry with the equatorial plane occupied by two chelating NO donor sets from two ligands L2 and the apical position by two pyridyl nitrogen atoms of two other ligands. In the ab plane, each Cd atom is linked to four ajacent Cd atoms through the chelating NO donors and pyridyl nitrogen atoms of ligands L2 to form a 2D 10 grid structure (Fig. 5b). However, no obvious void space for solvent molecules was observed due to the difference of pyridyl nitrogen position compared with that of 2 (Fig. S8). The coordination polymer 3 is isostructural to 4. The main distinction is that the metal centre was replaced as Zn(II) ion so that there are 15 subtle differences between them. 20 25 30 35 40 Fig. 6 Views of the coordination geometries of Cd1 (a) and Cd2 (b) in 5. X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis reveals that complex 5 is a 3D network. It crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system with space group of R-3. The asymmetric unit contains two 45 crystallographically independent Cd(II) ions. Cd1 is six- coordinated to two nitrogen atoms of pyridyl groups, two oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms from quinoline rings, forming a slightly distorted octahedral geometry (Fig. 6a). The bond lengths around Cd1 centre are 2.2104(1) Å for Cd-O, 2.3734(2) Å and 50 2.3788(1) Å for Cd-N. The Cd2 centre is coordinated to six nitrogen atoms from pyridyl groups, showing an octahedral coordination geometry (Fig. 6b). The bond distance of Cd-N around Cd2 is 2.3849(1) Å. Two Cd1 ions and one Cd2 ion are held together by one L1 ligand to yield complicated 3D network 55 (Fig. 7b). The most fascinating structural feature of 5 is that six Cd1 centers are arranged around one Cd2 centre to form a chair conformation metallocycle (Fig. 7a). The six Cd1 centers occupy the edge of the chair, Cd2 centre is in the core of the seat. The distance between Cd1 and Cd2 is 9.1051 Å. One hexagonal 60 channel which is separated to six sections evenly by the pyridyl groups was observed along the c axis. PLATON calculations indicate that complex 1 contains 34.5% void space (3420.3 Å3 per unit cell) that is accessible to solvent molecules. 65 70 75 80 85 90 Fig. 7 (a) View of a chair conformation metallocycle fabricated by six Cd1 atoms around one Cd2 centers in 5; (b) The 3D framework of 5. Photophysical properties To confirm that the crystal structures of coordination polymers 1- 5 are truly representative of their bulk materials tested in 95 photophysical studies, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were carried out on the as-synthesized samples. As we can see from Fig. 8, the peak positions of the experimental and simulated PXRD patterns are in good agreement with each other. The differences in intensity may be owing to the preferred 100 orientation of the crystal samples. The luminescent behaviors of five complexes and their corresponding free ligands L1-MOM and L2-MOM were investigated in the solid state at room temperature. When excited with 300 nm light, the free ligands L1-MOM and L2-MOM 105 display maximum emission wavelengths at 404 and 415 nm, respectively (Fig. 9), which originated from charge transfer of the internal ligand. Coordination polymers 1-5 exhibit intense photoluminescences with the emission maximum at 511, 511, 506, 523, and 543 nm, respectively, upon excitation at 340 nm (Fig. 9). 110 Compared with the emission spectra of the corresponding ligands L1-MOM and L2-MOM, varying degrees of red shifts of 107 nm in 1 and 2, 102 nm in 3, 108 nm in 4, and 128 nm in 5 have been observed, which are considered to mainly arise from the coordination of metal centers to the ligands L1-MOM and L2- 115 (a) (b) (a) (b) Page 5 of 9 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 14 October 2014.

The incorporation of metal ion effectively increases the conformational rigidity of the ligand and reduces the loss of energy via vibration motions20. Additionally, the coordination of the ligand with Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions forms additional five- membered rings, which increases the π–π* conjugation length 5 and the conformational coplanarity, accordingly reduces the energy gap between the π and π* molecular orbital of the ligand21. From Fig. 9, the emission wavelengthes of polymers 4 and 5 are red-shifted in comparison with those of other three complexes, which may be attributed to their Cd(II) centers and close-packed 10 supramolecular structures. 15 20 Fig. 8 PXRD patterns of coordination polymers 1-5. 25 30 35 Fig. 9 Emission spectra of ligands L1-MOM and L2-MOM, coordination polymers 1-5 in the solid state. To further understand the fluorescent properties of coordination polymers 1-5, their fluorescent lifetimes were investigated at room temperature in the solid state (Fig. S12). The 40 average lifetime was determined by allowing αi and τi to vary, and then convoluting eq 1 with the instrument response function. The data was successfully modeled using double exponentials, and the average lifetime was determined using eq 2. In both equations t is time, τ is lifetime, and α is a pre-exponential factor19. The results 45 are summarized in Table 1. The shortest fluorescence lifetime of coordination polymer 5 (5.75 ns) may arise from a combined contribution from a competitive non-radiative decay process in the metal complex (such as the incompletely hindered electron transfer), and distinct supramolecular structures in comparison 50 with polymers 1-4. 55 Table 1.

Sensing of nitroaromatics Li and coworkers recently explored that many Zn(II) coordination polymers exhibit unique selectivity for the detection of high explosives and other environmentally deleterious aromatics via a fluorescence quenching and enhancement mechanism.8 This 60 stimulates us to probe the applicability of polymers 1-5 for the sensing of electron-deficient nitroaromatics (NACs). Fluorescent spectra were recorded on powder samples of 1-5 in thin-layer form, and it was found that all nitroaromatics act as fluorescence quenchers for 1-5 (Fig. S13-17). The quenching efficiency (%) 65 was estimated using the formula (I0 - I)/I0×100%, where I0 is the maximum fluorescence intensity of the polymers before exposure to the analyte, I is the maximum intensity after exposure to the analyte. Among these NACs used in this study, the most effective quencher is 2-nitrotoluene (2-NT) compared with nitrobenzene 70 (NB) and 3-nitrotoluene (3-NT) (Fig. 11). 2-NT quenches the emission by 61%, 72%, 96%, 44%, 51%, respectively, for polymer 1-5. For 1, 2 and 5, the order of quenching efficiency for the selected nitroaromatics is 2-NT > NB > 3-NT; for 3 and 4, the quenching efficiency of NACs was found to decrease in the order 75 2-NT > 3-NT > NB. Notably, this order is not in accordance with the trend of electron-withdrawing groups, which also cannot be explained when the vapor pressure of each analyte is also taken into consideration. The observed fluorescence attenuation can be explained by the donor-acceptor electron-transfer mechanism8. 2- 80 NT exhibits the strongest quenching effect may be attributed to its strongest polymer–analyte π-stacking compared with NB and 3-NT9. As shown in Fig. 10, the rates of quenching of Zn(II) polymers 1-3 were faster with NACs than that of Cd(II) polymers 4 and 5. In addition, a higher quenching effect was observed for 3 85 than isostructural 4 due to their different metal centers. From these data, fluorescence quenching is undergoing a mixed quenching pathway for polymers 1-5. The observed quenching trend is not controlled by a single factor but by a number of properties such as the nature of the analyte molecules, metal 90 centers and supramolecular structures of the coordination polymers, relative orbital energies and interactions between coordination polymers and analyte molecules.8-9 Page 6 of 9 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 14 October 2014.

Elemental analyses were performed with an EA1110 CHNS-0 CE elemental analyzer. The IR (KBr pellet) spectrum was recorded (400-4000cm-1 region) on a Nicolet Magna 750 FT-IR spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction 55 (PXRD) data were collected on a DMAX2500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The calculated PXRD patterns were produced using the SHELXTL-XPOW program and single crystal reflection data. All fluorescence measurements were carried out on a LS 50B Luminescence Spectrometer (Perkin 60 Elmer, Inc., USA). The room-temperature (RT) lifetime measurements were determined on a FLS920 time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments). 1H and 13C NMR experiments were carried out on a MERCURYplus 400 spectrometer operating at resonance 65 frequencies of 400 MHZ.

Preparation of thin layers for photoluminescence study For photoluminescence (PL) studies, samples were prepared in the form of thin layers on glass slides. Quartz slides of dimension 40 1×2 cm were first rinsed with de-ionized water and methanol, and then dried in the oven. Double sided tape was then applied to the upper half of the slide. For making the thin layers of the sample, the tape was peeled off from the slide after 5 minutes, so that the glue from the tape is stuck in the glass slide. well-ground powder 45 of the as-made sample was then sprinkled evenly onto the glued surface of the slide. The extra samples were removed by gentle tapping and putting the face of the slide down. By this process a very thin continuous layer of sample was formed on the glass surface. This glass was then used for the PL study of the sample. 50 New slides with a thin layer were used for each of the quenching experiment. The original fluorescence spectra of each layer were collected before placing the particular glass slides onto each of the analytes. The fluorescence response of the thin layers to the vapors of NACs was ascertained by inserting the prepared thin 55 layers into quartz cuvette at RT containing the analytes and cotton gauze, which prevents the direct contact of the thin layers with the analyte and helps to maintain a constant saturated vapor pressure. Thin layers were placed in the quartz cuvette and fluorescence spectra were measured after exposing the thin layers 60 for a specific interval time. X-ray crystallography Single-crystal XRD data for compounds 1-5 were all collected on a Bruker APEX area-detector X-ray diffractometer with MoKa radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The empirical absorption correction 65 was applied by using the SADABS program (G. M. Sheldrick, SADABS, program for empirical absorption correction of area detector data; University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany, 1996). The structure was solved using direct method, and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 (G. M. Sheldrick, SHELXTL97, 70 program for crystal structure refinement, University of Göttingen, Germany, 1997). In coordination polymers 1 and 5, the solvent- masking procedure (aka SQUEEZE) has been applied to the entire contents of the voids. Crystal data and details of the data collection are given in Table S1, whereas the selected bond 75 distances and angles are presented in Table S2-6. The CCDC numbers of 1-5 are 1016361-1016365, respectively. Conclusion In summary, five coordination polymers with different structures are prepared under solvothermal conditions, using Zn(II) or Cd(II) 80 salts and two bispyridyl-based quinolinate ligands synthesized from the cheap commercial available 8-hydroxyquinaldine. These polymers exhibited disparate fluorescence emission and lifetime upon excitation in the solid state due to their different metal centers and supramolecular structures. We have also evaluated 85 the fluorescence-based sensing properties of 1-5 at room temperature. Fluorescence quenching was observed when the coordination polymers were exposed to the vapor of aromatic compounds. However, compound 3 shows superior sensitivity to the analytes in comparison with other polymers. The rate of 90 quenching of polymers 1-5 was higher with 2-NT compared to those with NB and 3-NT. This work shows that fluorescence quenching is undergoing a mixed quenching pathway, and governed by a number of factors such as the nature of the analyte molecules, metal centers and supramolecular structures of the 95 coordination polymers, relative orbital energies and interactions between coordination polymers and analyte molecules.
