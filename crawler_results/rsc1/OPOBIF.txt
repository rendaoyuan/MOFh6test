Manuscript Ancillary ligand-mediated syntheses and ﬂuorescence properties of zinc(II) complexes based on ﬂexible benzene dicarboxylic acid† Guang-Zhen Liu, Ling-Yun Xin and Li-Ya Wang* Received 23rd November 2010, Accepted 10th February 2011 DOI: 10.1039/c0ce00873g This work presents a well-deﬁned synthetic system exemplifying the effect of N-donor ancillary ligands on the formation of complex architectures in a zinc(II)-H2hmph-H2O system by the mild hydrothermal route (H2hmph ¼ homophthalic acid). The single-crystal X-ray diffractions reveal that structure variation of isolated three complexes spans the range of dimensionalities from 2D lamella [Zn(hmph)(bpe)]n (1), 2D thick-layer [Zn(hmph)(bpp)]n (2) to 3D microporous framework {[Zn2(hmph)(trz)2]$H2O}n (3), showing the marked sensitivity of the structures to the ﬂexibility of varied N-donor ancillary ligands (bpe ¼ 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene, bpp ¼ 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane, and Htrz ¼ 1,2,4-triazole). The structures of three complexes can be considered as the assembly of various chain-like structure motifs. The 2D lamella structure of 1 features hmph-bridged binuclear zinc(II) chains joined by less ﬂexible trans-bpe ligands, whereas the 2D thick-layer of 2 manifests hmph-bridged mononuclear zinc(II) chains cross-linked further by ﬂexible bpp legands along two different directions. The alternate opposite chiral helixes, featuring rigid trz-bridged mononuclear zinc(II), and additional binuclear zinc(II) units are cohered together by hmph linkers yielding a 3D microporous coordination network of 3 with new framework topology. It is shown that the structures, packing densities, and thermal stabilities of all these complexes are markedly sensitive to the molecule size, conformation, and ﬂexibility of varied N-donor ancillary ligands. Furthermore, ﬂuorescence properties of complexes 1–3 are also investigated. Introduction The advent of desirable metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is of perpetual interest in supramolecular chemistry and crystal engi- neering for their high impact in the domain such as catalysis,1 molecule storage,2 ion-exchange,3 separations,4 magnetism,5 and photoactive materials.6 Though it is currently a great challenge for directional synthesis of such materials due to the lack of the understanding in formation mechanisms, the rational design and construction of the desirable MOFs can be realized by the judi- cious choice of the metal centers and organic linkers, as well as the synthetic routes considering the fact that the geometric orientation, binding mode and the coordination preferences at the speciﬁc metal ions of the linkers and the self-assembly of metal cluster subunits act synergistically to provide access to a vast diversity of structural topologies.7–9 Multi-carboxylate ligands are good candidates for the construction of MOFs that display rich structural diversity due to their excellent coordination capability. Rigid aromatic multi- carboxylate ligands have been universally employed in MOF chemistry,10 and several based on ﬂexible ones with longer carboxylate groups have been documented recently,11,12 whereas little research has been carried out in this synthesis by using aromatic multi-carboxylate ligands combined with rigid and ﬂexible carboxylate groups,13 which can probably be attributed to the unpredictable structure types or unfavourable crystalli- zation conditions. Furthermore, N-donor ancillary ligands can modify the structures and properties of the resulting materials by the cooperative coordination together with carboxylate group to meet the requirement of coordination geometries of metal ions in the assembly process,14 thus, molecule size and ﬂexibility of N- donor ancillary ligand may be also an important factor in determining the structure of the coordination architectures. With the aim of the understanding of the coordination chemistry of ﬂexible aromatic multi-carboxylate complexes, and investigating the effect of ancillary ligands with different ﬂexi- bility on the structures and physical properties of the resulted MOFs, a well-deﬁned synthetic system containing Zn/H2hmph/ H2O and three type of N-donor ancillary ligands with different the molecule size, conformation, and ﬂexibility (ﬂexible bpp, less College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Luoyang Normal University, Luoyang, Henan, 471022, P.

This strategy is to perform a series of reactions in similar conditions with only one factor varied, thus, the diversity in assembly and function- ality of MOFs can be exclusively attributed to the change of the factor.15 Herein, we describe the preparation and characterization of three Zn(II) complexes based on the ﬂexible and emissive linker molecule, H2hmph, the structures of which span the range of dimensionalities from 2D lamella [Zn(hmph)(bpe)]n (1), 2D thick-layer [Zn(hmph)(bpp)]n (2) to 3D microporous framework {[Zn2(hmph)(trz)2]$H2O}n (3) with a new framework topology. Thermal stabilities and ﬂuorescence properties of these complexes are also discussed. Experimental Materials and physical measurements All commercially available solvents and reagents for synthesis were of reagent grade and used without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were performed on a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. Infrared spectra (IR) were obtained from sample powder pelletized with KBr on an Avatar(tm) 360 E. S. P. IR spectrophotometer over a range 4000–400 cm1. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded with a Rigaku D/Max 3III diffractometer. The thermo-gravi- metric analysis (TGA) was performed on a STA449C integration thermal analyzer in ﬂowing N2 with a heating rate of 5 C min1. The luminescent spectra were performed at the room tempera- ture on an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrophotometer with xenon arc lamp as the light source. Syntheses of complexes Complexes 1–3 were prepared by following almost uniform hydrothermal procedure including various synthetic parameters except using different N-donor ancillary ligand for each run. Typically, a mixture of Zn(OAc)2$2H2O(0.10 mmol, 0.0219 g), H2hmph (0.20 mmol, 0.0400 g), N-donor ligand (0.20 mmol, 0.0364 g for bpe, 0.20 mmol, 0.0400g for bpp, or 0.20 mmol, 0.0138 g for Htrz), and deionized water (8 mL) was placed in a 25 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel. Subsequently, 0.50 mol L1 NaOH (0.1 mmol) was added while constant stirring. The vessel was sealed and heated at 120 C for 4 d under autogenous pressure and then cooled slowly to the room temperature. The resulting crystals were recovered by ﬁltration, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and allowed to dry in air. [Zn(hmph)(bpe)]n (1). Yield: 56%.

The PXRD patterns of the bulk products for complexes 1–3 are in agreement with the calculated patterns based on the single-crystal solutions (Fig. S1– S3).† X-Ray crystallography The crystallographic data collections for complexes 1–3 were carried out a Bruker SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (l ¼ 0.71073 A) by using the 4/u scan technique at room temperature. Absorption corrections were based on symmetry equivalent reﬂections using the SADABS program.16 The structure was solved by direct methods followed by successive difference Fourier syntheses. A full-matrix least-squares reﬁnement on F2 was carried out using the SHELX-97 program package17 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically except for those of isolated water molecule in 3 assigned by Fourier map with common isotropic displacement factors and included in the ﬁnal reﬁnement by use of geometrical restraints. A bpp molecule in complex 2 is disordered into two positions and some soft constraints were also applied. The details of the crystal param- eters, data collection and reﬁnement for complexes 1–3 are summarized in Table 1. Further details are provided in the ESI.† Results and discussion Hydrothermal synthesis The mixture of metal salt and H2hmph with N-donor ligand usually leads to precipitation in aqueous solution, which makes it difﬁcult to grow crystals of the complex, thus, single crystals of complexes 1–3 were synthesized by employing a hydrothermal route. To investigate the effect of ancillary ligands on the resulted structures, three type of N-donor ligands including ﬂexible ligand (bpp), less ﬂexible ligand (bpe), and rigid ligand (Htrz) is, respectively, introduced into Zn/H3hmph/H2O system by Scheme 1 Three type of N-donor ancillary ligands and coordination modes of H2hmph observed in complexes 1–3. 3014 | CrystEngComm, 2011, 13, 3013–3020 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Published on 02 March 2011.

In each synthetic process, NaOH was added as a mineralizer, and all the carboxylate groups of the H2hmph are found to be completely deprotonated as evidenced by the results of structure analyses and IR with the absence of the expected absorption band in the range of 1760–1680 cm1 for the protonated carboxylic groups. Various coordination modes of hmph anion observed in complexes 1–3 are shown in Scheme 1d–f, and the further structural details for the related complexes are described below. Description of crystal structures [Zn(hmph)(bpe)]n (1). Single-crystal X-ray analysis shows that complex 1 is a 2D lamella structure with binuclear zinc(II) as nodes and hmph and bpe as linkers. The asymmetric unit contains a crystallographically distinct Zn(II) cation, one completely deprotonated hmph anion and one bpe molecule, as shown in Fig. 1a. The Zn(II) atom is octahedrally coordinated by two apical N atoms from two bpe ligands respectively with Zn–N bond lengths of 2.142(3) and 2.154(3) A, and four equatorial oxygen atoms from three hmph anions with Zn–O bond lengths of 1.999(2)–2.027(3) A. The –COO group adopts a h1:h1 chelating coordination mode to connect one Zn(II) atom, while the ﬂexible –CH2COO groups exhibits a h1:h1 bridging coor- dination mode to link two Zn(II) atoms (Scheme 1d). Along the a axis, the Zn(II) ions are bridged by the hmph anions to generate 1D ladder-like chains containing an alternative arrangement of 8- and 16-MR (MR ¼ membered ring), as shown in Fig. 1b. The Zn/Zn separation is 3.97 and 5.85 A within the 8-MR and 16-MR, respectively. These ladder-like chains array in parallel fashion and are further linked by less ﬂexible trans-bpe ligands to produce a 2D lamella (Fig. 1c). Individual layers stack together with a –AAAA– sequence and are entirely cohered together by relatively weak van der Waals interactions to form a 3D supra- molecular network (ESI, Fig. S4)†; no signiﬁcant p–p interac- tions are observed between phenyl rings in the overall structure with phenyl–phenyl distances of 5.779 A between two adjacent lamellas. [Zn(hmph)(bpp)]n (2). The structure of complex 2 is a 2D thick- layer structure with mononuclear zinc(II) as nodes and hmph and bpp as linkers. The asymmetric unit contains two crystallo- graphically distinct molecule fragments with almost uniform conﬁgurations; thus, only one fragment is described as shown in Fig. 2a. Each molecule fragment consists of two crystallographically distinct Zn(II) cations, two completely deprotonated hmph anions, and two bpp molecules. No additional symmetry elements were detected when PLATON18 software was applied to the ﬁnal reﬁnement results for this structure. The Zn1 atom (or Zn3 atom) is octahedrally coordinated by two N atoms from two bpp ligands respectively, and four oxygen atoms from two hmph. Two carboxylate groups of one hmph all exhibit a h1:h1 chelating coordination mode to connect one Zn(II) atom, whereas the rigid –COO group and the ﬂexible –CH2COO groups of another hmph adopts, respectively, a h1:h1 chelating coordination mode and a h1 monodentate coordination mode to connect one Zn(II) atom (Scheme 1e and 1f). The Zn2 atom (or Zn4 atom) is tetragonal pyramidally coordinated by two N atoms from two bpp ligands, respectively, and three oxygen atoms from two hmph.

Two adjacent sheets are further connected by the coordination bonds of N atoms of bpp with the octahedrally coordinated Zn1 (or Zn3) atoms to produce a 2D thick-layer structure with a thickness of 17.6 A (Fig. 2c), which are further stacked in a –ABAB– sequence and entirely hold together by relatively weak van der Waals interactions to form a 3D supramolecular network (ESI, Fig. S5).† There exists relatively stronger p–p interactions between the parallel pyridyl rings of bpp molecules within the layer (pyridyl–pyridyl distance ¼ 3.8658–4.0364 A), which dominates seemingly the luminescence of 2 as discussed below, and the phenyl rings of hmph anions do not form any signiﬁcant p–p interaction in overall structure with phenyl–phenyl distance of 6.3734 A between two adjacent layers. {[Zn2(hmph)(trz)2]$H2O}n (3). The crystal structure of complex 3 reveals a 3D microporous architecture with a new framework topology composed of two crystallographically distinct Zn(II) cations, one completely deprotonated hmph anion, two depro- tonated trz, and one guest water molecule in the asymmetric unit, as shown in Fig. 3a. The Zn1 is octahedrally coordinated by three N atoms from three trz ligands, respectively, and two oxygen atoms from one hmph anion. The Zn2 is tetrahedrally coordi- nated by three N atoms from three trz ligands, respectively, and one O atom from hmph anion. All the Zn–N bond lengths are in the range of 1.991(3)–2.144(3) A, and the Zn–O bond distances are between 1.925(3)–2.401(4) A, which are comparable to the previously reported values.19 Fig. 1 (a) ORTEP plot of the asymmetric unit showing the coordination environment of Zn cation in 1, with the symmetry related part drawn in open circles.

View Article Online In fact, the hmph anions of complex 3 exhibit the same h1:h1 chelating coordination mode and h1:h1 bridging coordination mode as those in complex 1 (Scheme 1d), and both trz molecules adopt the N1, N2, N4-bridging mode to hold three Zn atoms together. The Zn2 atoms are linked together by m1,4-bridging trz to generate 1D chiral helixes with opposite chiral propagating along the c direction (Fig. 3b), and two adjacent Zn1 atoms are cohered together by m1,2-bridging trz to form a dinuclear zinc unit. The opposite chiral helixes, arraying alternatively in the cell unit, and the dinuclear zinc units are further cross-linked by the remaining N atom of each trz and two carboxylate groups of hmph anion producing a 3D microporous framework with 1D linear 48-MR channels running along the [001] direction (Fig. 3c and 3d). Each channel is enclosed by six-stranded alternative opposite chiral helixes linking the dinuclear zinc motifs by hmph anions forming thicker pore wall (Fig. 3e). The opening of each channel is asteroid in shape and delimited by the alternative arrangement of six Zn octahedra and two hmph anions with an approximate pore diameter of about 10.55  16.43 A (ESI, Fig. S6).† Fortu- nately, the guest water molecules in this structure are located in the thick porous wall leaving the channels unoccupied. A PLA- TON18 program analysis suggests that there is approximately 10.9% of solvent-accessible volume (861.0 A3 cavity volume). No signiﬁcant p–p interactions are observed in overall structure, all the adjacent phenyl rings and/or trz rings are almost perpendic- ular to each other. In complex 3, each hmph anion and both two trz ligands are all 3-connected, and Zn1 and Zn2 atoms are 4-connected and 5-connected, respectively, thus a ﬁve-nodal 3,4,5-connected network is formed (Fig. 3f). Topological analysis reveals that the architecture of 3 represents a new framework topology with (4$6$84)(4$6$8)2(4$82)(42$64$83$10) point (Schl€aﬂi) symbol (designated as LGZ). Effect of ancillary ligands. In this work, three types of N-donor ligands with different size, conformation, and ﬂexibility were used to investigate their inﬂuence on the formation of complex architectures in zinc(II)-H2hmph-H2O reaction system. As for the pillared bpe molecule with less ﬂexibility, the Zn carboxylate chains are linked by the trans-bpe molecules to result in the formation of 2D rigid layer with smaller ring size in 1. When more ﬂexible bpp ligand was taken into the reaction, the Zn carboxylate zigzag chains are linked by the bpp molecules producing the 2D ﬂexible sheet motifs with larger 56-MR. Two adjacent sheets are further cohered together by the additional bbp molecules to form the entire 2D thick-layer structure of 2, which may be attributed to the fact that three methylene groups in bpp can rotate freely and the larger degree of freedom permits the ﬂexible linker to be occluded between short-range sheet motifs. As for 3, the trz molecule and hmph anion link Zn polyhedra into an extended 3D rigid architecture with thick pore walls resulting from its higher crystal density and larger solvent- accessible volume compared to 1 and 2. The packing densities of the architectures increase as the reinforcement of the rigidity of ancillary ligands for three complexes (d2 ¼ 1.372 for 2 < d1 ¼ 1.572 for 1 < d3 ¼ 1.759 g cm3 for 3), in which the packing density for 2 is the smallest. This may be ascribed to smaller molecule size and high stiffness for the tridentate trz ancillary ligand. Therefore, the structures of three coordination architec- tures are strikingly sensitive to the molecule size, conformation, and ﬂexibility of varied N-donor ancillary ligands. Thermal stabilities. TGA analyses were performed on crys- talline samples from 25 to 800 C at a heating rate of 5 min1 under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1–3, as shown in Fig. 4. The framework of the complex 1 is stable up to ca. 300 C, subse- quently, a sharp weight loss is observed in a narrow temperature range 300–350 C, followed by a slowly weight loss until 800 C. The observed total weight loss of 79.52% is roughly in Fig. 3 (a) ORTEP plot of the asymmetric unit showing the local coor- dination environments of Zn cations in 3, with the symmetry related part drawn in open circles.

View Article Online accordance with the expected value of 80.88% due to the release of organic ligands with ZnO forms as the ﬁnal product. TGA data for 2 reveals that the elimination of the organic constituents occurred in the temperature range 240–800 C. The observed total weight loss of 81.47% is agreed with the calculated value of 81.58% by assuming the ﬁnal product to be ZnO. The TGA curve of 3 shows a two-step weight loss between 25 and 800 C. The ﬁrst weight loss of 3.96% from 25 to 150 C corresponds to the release of one guest water molecule per formula unit (calcd 3.89%). No weight loss was observed from 150 to 340 C, and the framework started to decompose at higher temperatures. The second weight loss of 60.17% (calcd 60.96%) between 340 and 800 C corresponds to the decomposition of the coordination framework. The ﬁnal residue of 35.86% is close to the calculated value of 35.15% based on a ﬁnal ZnO phase. Decomposition temperature of organic constituents in complexes 1–3 is about 300, 240 and 340 C, respectively, dis- playing that the stability of the architectures increases as the reinforcement of the rigidity of N-donor ancillary ligands (rigidity: bbp in 2 < bpe in 1 < trz in 3). It should be noted that high thermal stability of metal–organic frameworks is one of the most desirable qualities for application purposes. Photoluminescent properties. Coordination polymers with d10 metal centers are desired candidates for ﬂuorescence-emitting materials owing to their higher thermal stability than the pure organic ligand and the ability to affect the emission wavelength of the organic materials by metal coordination.20 Through a large number of the literature reports deal with the investigation of luminescent complexes,6 the lack of further discussion on lumi- nescence spectra of the cooperative coordinated complexes mixing two types of linkers can probably be attributed to the unpredictable luminescence features. The photoluminescent properties of 1–3 were detected in the solid states, as shown in Fig. 5. It is shown that complex 1 has two weak emissions with a maximum at 403 and 467 nm (lex ¼ 253 nm), while 2 and 3 displays a strong emission with a maximum at 437 nm (lex ¼ 315 nm) and 460 nm (lex ¼ 400 nm), respectively. In addition, the powdered free H2hmph and bpp ligand has an emission at 452 nm (lex ¼ 390 nm) and 440 nm (lex ¼ 348 nm) (Fig. 5), respectively, which could be attributed to the p–p* transitions, whereas there is no obvious emission observed for free Htrz ligand for excitation wavelength between 250 and 480 nm, and the free bpe ligand does not emit luminescence in the range 400–800 nm (only displaying violet luminescence in the higher energy range). It is proposed that all three complexes show ligand-based ﬂuorescence emission char- acterizations as discussed below. Luminescence of 1 can be considered as a hmph ligand-based ﬂuorescence emission. Compared with that of the free H2hmph ligand, the slightly red-shift emission at 467 nm for 1 may be assigned as the p–p*and/or n–p* transition of the hmph ligands since a similar emission is also observed for free H2hmph ligand,21 and the relatively larger blue-shift emission at 403 nm could be tentatively assigned to originating from the ligand-to- metal charge transfer (LMCT) according to the literature.22 The powdered free H2hmph and bpp ligand has a similar emission at 452 nm and 440 nm, respectively, thus the emission band at 437 nm for 2 with the spectrum characteristics similar to those of two free ligands may be result from the intraligand ﬂuorescent emissions related to H2hmph/bpp ligands. In addition, on the base of the non-ﬂuorescence for free Htrz ligand, the similar spectrum shape with free H2hmph ligand indicates that the emission peaks at 460 nm for 3 should be assigned as the p–p* and/or n–p* transition of the hmph ligands. Conclusions Similar mild hydrothermal route yields three zinc(II) complexes based on the ﬂexible H2hmph regulated by three type of N-donor ancillary ligands including ﬂexible bpp, less ﬂexible bpe, and rigid Htrz, respectively, which provides a case study to show the effect of the N-donor ancillary ligands on the structures and properties of the resulted coordination polymers. The structure variation spans the range of dimensionalities from 2D lamella, 2D thick- layer to 3D microporous architecture with a new framework topology, which are based on the assembly of chain-like structure motifs featuring zinc polyhedra in different coordination envi- ronments connected by the various linkers, with structure 1 containing only octahedra, while structures 2 and 3 showing additional tetragonal pyramidal and tetrahedral geometry, respectively.

View Article Online It is shown that the structures, packing densities and the thermal stabilities of these coordination frameworks are inti- mately related to the molecule size, conformation, and ﬂexibility of N-donor ancillary ligands. Moreover, all three complexes display various ligand-based blue ﬂuorescence emissions. Our preliminary data show that more complexes with novel frame- work topology and unique physical properties based on the ﬂexible H2hmph ligand can also be obtained by using the similar procedure reported here. Further work in this area is in progress.
