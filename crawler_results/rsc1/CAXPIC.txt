The three- dimensional compounds have Co5 (compound-I) and Co4 (compound-II and compound-III) clusters connected through the carboxylate and triazolate forming structures with pcu net (compound-I and compound-II) and a graphite-related net (compound-III). The water molecules (coordinated and lattice) can be readily re-adsorbed by the structure of compound-I, whereas the removal of the water molecule leads to a collapse of the structures of compound-II and compound-III. The TGA studies suggest the possibility of an intermediate structure for compound-1, which was investigated using in situ single crystal to single crystal (SCSC) transformations. The identiﬁcation of an intermediate structure during the dehydration/hydration cycle in compound-I is important and provides important pointers about the dynamics of the water molecules in these compounds. Compound-I was also investigated in detail using a variety of spectroscopic techniques such as IR, UV-Vis spectroscopy etc. Magnetic studies on the synthesized compounds indicate anti-ferromagnetic behavior. Introduction The last two decades witnessed the evolution of metal–organic framework (MOF) compounds as a potent and important class of solids due to their many functionalities. MOFs have been found to be superior to other traditional porous materials such as zeolites, activated carbon etc. in their structural tunability, versa- tility and ﬂexible behavior.1 Over the years, MOFs have been shown to be useful for many important applications in the areas of catalysis,2 ion-exchange3 and drug-delivery.4 Most often MOFs were found to provide good sorption and separation be- havior, which in some cases rival the aluminosilicate zeolites.5 The usefulness of combining different metals and organic linkers has been exploited by various researchers, the result of which is seen in the current literature. The overall topology as well as the functionality of the MOF structure appears to have a close relationship with the coordination geometry of the metal ion along with the binding mode and the polarity of the organic linkers. The rational design of such frameworks was not easy due to the ﬂexibility of the structure, resulting in inter- penetration. In many instances, the inter-penetration is due to the use of long and ﬂexible organic linkers, which impedes the porous properties of the structure. The choice of short rigid organic linkers helps in alleviating this problem. The use of poly-carboxylic acids, poly-pyridine ligands and the combination of them appears to have given rise to MOF structures of importance.6 The use of imidazole by Yaghi and co- workers has generated new materials, whose structures rival those of zeolites.7 This observation suggests the possibility of obtaining newer and more interesting frameworks by choosing suitable nitrogen containing heterocyclic ligands, which could either be neutral or charged. The use of aza-heterocycle based secondary ligands has also provided a wealth of new materials with interesting properties.8 The use of such aza heterocyclic ligands were found to be particularly effective in the synthesis of new magnetic MOFs.9 It is becoming clear that the aza- heterocyclic ligands facilitate signiﬁcant exchange between the participating transition elements. The use of 1,2,4-triazole in MOFs has been successful in generating new building units and interesting structures.10 In addition, the 1,2,4-trizole can participate in three types of binding modes: μ1,2, μ2,4 and μ1,2,4. The use of carboxylic acids in conjunction with the triazole enhances the chances of pre- paring new three-dimensional MOF structures. It has been established that the aza-heterocycles also favor the formation of –M–N–M/M–(O/N)–M– (M = metal, O = oxygen and N = nitrogen) types of clusters/chains and layers within the MOF structures.11 †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Simulated and experimental powder XRD patterns, TGA curves, IR spectra, bond angles of the compounds, and magnetism studies of the compounds.

Many cobalt containing MOFs exhibiting different coordination environments have been synthesized and characterized.12 In some of these MOFs, the cobalt species are not isolated, but exist as Co– (O/N)–Co based clusters, chains and layers connected differently by the carboxylates.13 The cobalt based compounds also exhibit many interesting magnetic properties.14 Poly-carboxylic acids such as tri- and tetra-carboxylic acids of benzene have been found to be of considerable use in the formation of important MOF structures.15 Of the poly-carboxylic acids, the symmetric tri acid, trimesic acid, is important and has been investigated by many researchers.16 We have been interested in investigating the formation of new MOF structures using acids that are closely related to the structure of trimesic acid. Our earlier studies using, 5-amino isophthalic acid, 5-nitro isophthalic acid and 5-sulfo isophthalic acid have given rise to new compounds with interest- ing magnetic, optical and related properties.17 It occurred to us that a combination of cobalt salt, 5-nitro isophthalic acid, and triazole could lead to the formation of interesting compounds. To this end, we have employed a hydrothermal method to investigate the formation of new cobalt based MOFs employing a family of triazoles such as 1,2,4-triazole, 3-amino-1,2,4- triazole and 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole along with 5-nitro isophthalic acid. Our efforts have been successful and we have isolated three new cobalt containing MOF com- pounds, [Co5(H2O)4{(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}4(C2N3H2)2]·2H2O, (compound-I), [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O){(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}(C2N4 H3)]·H2O, (compound-II) and [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O){(NO2)-C6H3- (COO)2}(C2N5H5)]·H2O, (compound-III). Of these, compound- II and compound-III have the well-known butterﬂy Co4 clusters whereas compound-I has linear Co5 clusters. Compound- I and compound-II have a cubic closed packed arrangement of cobalt clusters stabilized in the well-known pcu-related structure and compound-III has a hexagonal closed packed arrangement with a pillared graphite-like structure. In addition, we have also carried out in situ single-crystal to single-crystal (SCSC) trans- formation of compound-I. In this paper, we describe the syn- thesis, structure, topological relationships, the SCSC transformation and the magnetic properties of these compounds. Experimental Synthesis and initial characterization All the compounds were prepared by employing the hydrother- mal method. In a typical synthesis, for compound-I, Co(CH3 COO)2·4H2O (0.249 g, 1 mM) was dissolved in 10 mL of water. To this, 5-nitroisophthalic acid (0.211 g, 1 mM) and 1,2,4-tria- zole (0.035 g, 0.5 mM) were added under continuous stirring. The mixture was homogenized for 30 min at room temperature. The ﬁnal mixture was transferred, sealed in a 23 mL PTFE lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 220 °C for 1 day under autogeneous pressure. A similar synthesis procedure was employed for the preparation of compound-II and compound- III, but by using 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and 3,5-diamino-1,2,4- triazole in the place of 1,2,4-triazole. The pH of the initial reac- tion mixture was found to be 5.1, 5.3 and 5.7 while after the reaction, it was 4.5, 5.0 and 5.6, respectively, for compound-I, compound-II and compound-III. The ﬁnal product in all the cases contained large quantities of purple colored single crystals only, which were ﬁltered under vacuum, washed with deionized water and dried under ambient conditions. The yields of the reac- tions are 63%, 78% and 72% for compound-I, compound-II and compound-III, respectively (yields are based on Co). The pro- ducts were characterized by elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis and Infra-red (IR) spectroscopic studies. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded in the 2θ range 5–50° on crushed single crystals using Cu-Kα radiation (Philips X’pert) (ESI,† Fig. S1–3). The observed PXRD pattern was entirely consistent with the simu- lated PXRD pattern generated based on the structure determined using the single crystal X-ray studies. The IR spectra for the compounds were recorded as KBr pellets (Perkin-Elmer, SPEC- TRUM 1000) (ESI,† Fig. S4, Table S1). Elemental analysis: Anal.

Single crystal structure determination A suitable single crystal of each compound was carefully selected under a polarizing microscope and glued to a thin glass ﬁber. The single crystal data were collected on a Bruker AXS smart Apex CCD diffractometer at 293(2) K. The X-ray genera- tor was operated at 50 kV and 35 mA using Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation. Data were collected with a ω scan width of 0.3°. A total of 606 frames were collected in three different set- tings of φ (0, 90, 180°) keeping the sample-to-detector distance ﬁxed at 6.03 cm and the detector position (2θ) ﬁxed at −25°. The data were reduced using SAINTPLUS,18 and an empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program.19 The structure was solved and reﬁned using SHELXL9720 present in the WinGx suit of programs (Version 1.63.04a).21 The hydrogen position of some water molecules could not be located from the difference Fourier maps. All the other hydrogen positions for the compounds, compound-I, com- pound-II and compound-III, were initially located in the differ- ence Fourier maps, and for the ﬁnal reﬁnement, the hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically ideal positions and reﬁned in the riding mode. Final reﬁnement included atomic positions for all the atoms, anisotropic thermal parameters for all the non- hydrogen atoms, and isotropic thermal parameters for all the hydrogen atoms. Full-matrix least-squares reﬁnement against |F2| was carried out using the WinGx package of programs.20 Details of the structure solution and ﬁnal reﬁnements for the compounds are given in Table 1. Structure of [Co5(H2O)4{(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}4(C2N3H2)2]· 2H2O, compound-I The asymmetric unit of [Co5(H2O)4{(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}4(C2 N3H2)2]·2H2O, compound-I, consists of 41 non-hydrogen atoms. Three crystallographically independent Co2+ ions, two 5-nitroisophthalate anions (NIPA-1 and NIPA-2; hereafter 4136 | Dalton Trans., 2012, 41, 4135–4145 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Published on 26 January 2012. Downloaded by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on 31/10/2014 09:36:38. 5–nitroisophthalate is designated as NIPA), one triazolate, two coordinated water and one lattice water molecule contribute to the asymmetric unit (ESI,† Fig. S5). The cobalt atom, Co(2), occupies a special position (1g) with a site multiplicity of 0.5. The cobalt species are connected through the carboxylate oxygens (μ2-connection) forming a pentameric cluster (Fig. 1a). The Co2+ ions have distorted octahedral environment with the Co–O distances in the range of 1.976(2)–2.309(1) Å [av. = 2.138 Å] and the Co–N distances in the range of 2.034(2)–2.082 (2) Å [av. = 2.055 Å] (Table 2). All the carboxylate oxygens of NIPA-1 and NIPA-2 are con- nected with four cobalt centers. Two of the oxygens of NIPA-2 have μ2-connectivity (ESI,† Fig. S6 and S7). The nitro group of the NIPA anion does not participate in bonding with the cobalt centers. The triazolate ion connects the pentameric cobalt clusters forming a one dimensional chain (Fig. 1b, ESI,† Fig. S8). The connectivity between the carboxylate oxygens and the pentameric cobalt clusters gives rise to two dimensional layers (Fig. 1c). The two dimensional layers are cross-linked through the triazolate ions forming the three dimensional struc- ture (Fig. 1d). To understand the overall network/topological connectivity of compound-I one can consider the connectivity between the Co5 clusters through the triazolate and the NIPA units. Thus, the Co5 cluster is connected with six NIPA anions and each NIPA anion is connected with four Co5 clusters. Each triazolate unit connects with three cobalt centers, which are part of two different Co5 clusters. Thus, each triazolate unit connects two Co5 cluster units. The Co5 pentameric cluster, thus, is connected through six NIPA-units and four triazolate units to six different Co5 clusters and forms the octahedral node (ESI,† Fig. S9). The close packing of the anions (NIPA and triazolate) gives rise to the octahedral sites, where the Co5 clusters are situated. The overall structure can be considered as a cubic close packing of the anions where the Co5 clusters occupy the octahedral voids. The topological analysis, based on the Co5 cluster as the node suggests a uninodal net with the Schläﬂi symbol of 412.63. This is a well known topological arrangement and represents the pcu- net (Fig. 4a). Structure of [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O){(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2} (C2N4H3)]·H2O, compound-II The asymmetric unit of [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O){(NO2)-C6H3- (COO)2}(C2N4H3)]·H2O, compound-II, consists of 26 non- hydrogen atoms. Two crystallographically independent Co2+ ions, one NIPA, one 3-amino-1,2,4-triazolate, one μ3-OH group, one coordinated and a lattice water molecule contribute to the asymmetric unit (ESI,† Fig. S10). The cobalt atoms are con- nected through the μ3-hydroxyl groups forming the Co4 cluster units (Fig. 2a). The cobalt species have a distorted octahedral Table 1 Crystal data and structure reﬁnement parameters for the prepared phases, compound-I, compound-Ia, compound-1b, compound- II and compound-III Empirical formula [Co5(H2O)4{(NO2)- C6H3-(COO)2}4 (C2N3H2)2]·2H2O, compound-I [Co5{(NO2)-C6H3- (COO)2}4(C2N3H2)2], compound-Ia [Co5(H2O)2{(NO2)- C6H3- (COO)2}4(C2N3H2)2], compound-Ib [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O) {(NO2)-C6H3- (COO)2} (C2N4H3)]·H2O, compound-II [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O) {(NO2)-C6H3- (COO)2} (C2N5H5)]·H2O, compound-III Formula weight 1375.33 1267.24 1303.33 463.10 479.13 Crystal System Triclinic Triclinic Triclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Space group P1ˉ P1ˉ P1ˉ P21/c P21/c T, °K 298 503 423 298 298 a/Å 9.5395(2) 9.259(3) 9.202(3) 10.5193(2) 11.0633(6) b/Å 11.7926(2) 11.177(4) 11.088(4) 12.5170(2) 12.5347(5) c/Å 11.8861(2) 12.131(4) 11.992(3) 11.5835(2) 11.1579(7) α (°) 110.204(1) 108.02(3) 108.58(3) 90 90 β (°) 111.329(1) 91.64(3) 91.40(2) 103.723(1) 104.120(6) γ (°) 90.908(1) 105.27(3) 104.71(3) 90 90 Volume/Å3 1153.50(4) 1143.4(6) 1114.3(6) 1481.66(4) 1500.57(14) Z 1 1 1 4 4 T/K 293(2) 503(2) 423(2) 293(2) 293(2) ρcalc (g cm−−3) 1.962 1.840 1.936 2.058 2.112 μ (mm−−1) 1.876 1.876 1.931 2.303 2.280 θ range (°) 1.86 to 26.00 2.58 to 26.00 2.61 to 26.00 2.86 to 27.56 2.49 to 26.00 λ(Mo-Kα)/Å 0.71073 0.71073 0.71073 0.71073 0.71073 Rint 0.0200 0.1847 0.0986 0.0196 0.0806 Reﬂection collected 16645 18322 7158 11859 15573 Unique reﬂections 4514 4478 4281 3301 2960 Number of parameters 367 340 349 239 256 R indices [I > 2σ(I)] R1 = 0.0245 R1 = 0.1316 R1 = 0.1211 R1 = 0.0261 R1 = 0.0541 wR2 = 0.0737 wR2 = 0.3108 wR2 = 0.2804 wR2 = 0.0677 wR2 = 0.1391 R indices (all data) R1 = 0.0264 R1 = 0.2335 R1 = 0.2368 R1 = 0.0276 R1 = 0.0830 wR2 = 0.0747 wR2 = 0.3833 wR2 = 0.3461 wR2 = 0.0686 wR2 = 0.1534 R1 = Σ∥Fo| −|Fc∥/Σ|Fo|; wR2 = {Σ [w(Fo 2 −Fc 2)]/Σ [w(Fo 2)2]}1/2. w = 1/[ρ2(Fo)2 + (aP)2 + bP].

In compound-II, the amino group of the aminotriazolate also participates in bonding with the cobalt center (ESI,† Fig. S11). Thus, the connectivity between the aminotriazolate and the Co4 clusters result in a two dimensional layer in the ‘bc’ plane (Fig. 2b). All of the carboxylate oxygens of the NIPA anion are connected with the cobalt center (ESI,† Fig. S12). This connec- tivity between the carboxylate oxygen and the Co4 cluster results in a one dimensional ladder along the (1 0 0) axis (Fig. 2c). The 2D cobalt-triazolate layers and the 1D cobalt-carboxylate ladders are cross-linked to form the 3D structure (Fig. 2d). For the topological understanding, we can view the structure through the Co4 clusters. Thus, each Co4 cluster is connected with four aminotriazolate and each aminotetrazole connects two Co4 clusters – akin to a simple linear linker. Two NIPA anions, on the other hand, connect two Co4 clusters (one above and one below the Co4–aminotriazolate layer in the ‘bc’ plane). Thus, each Co4 cluster is octahedrally connected with the neighboring Co4 cluster through four aminotetrazole and four NIPA units (ESI,† Fig. S13). The anions (amino tetrazolate and the carboxy- late) packs in a cubic close packed arrangement in which the Co4 cluster units occupy the octahedral voids. This arrangement, again, would result in the pcu net with the Schläﬂi symbol of 412.63 (Fig. 4b). Structure of [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O){(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2} (C2N5H5)]·H2O, compound-III The asymmetric unit of [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O){(NO2)-C6H3- (COO)2}(C2N5H5)]·H2O, compound-III, consists of 27 non- hydrogen atoms. The contents of the asymmetric unit is compar- able to that observed in compound-II (two Co2+ ions, one NIPA, one 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazolate, one μ3-OH group, one coordi- nated water and a lattice water molecule) (ESI,† Fig. S14). The cobalt atoms are connected through the μ3-hydroxyl groups forming the Co4 cluster, similar to compound-II (Fig. 3a). The cobalt species have octahedral coordination with the Co–O dis- tances in the range of 2.042(4)–2.175(5) Å [av. = 2.097 Å] and the Co–N bond distance in the range of 2.083(4)–2.531(6) Å [av. = 2.220 Å] (Table 2). Both the amino groups of the 3,5-diamino triazole participate in bonding with the cobalt centers (ESI,† Fig. S15). The connec- tivity between the diaminotriazolate and the Co4 clusters result in a two dimensional layer in the ‘bc’ plane, similar to com- pound-II (Fig. 3b). Of the four carboxylate oxygens, three are bonded with the cobalt and the remaining oxygen is free (ESI,† Fig. S16). The NIPA anions cross-link the cobalt-triazolate layers giving rise to the three-dimensional structure (Fig. 3c). It can be noted that the connectivity observed in compound- III is closely related to that observed in compound-II. The par- ticipation of the extra amino group of the triazolate unit in bonding gives rise to an eight-connected node at the Co4 cluster center – each Co4 cluster is connected to eight nearest neighbor Co4 units through six aminotriazole and four NIPA units (Fig. 4c) (ESI,† Fig. S17). From a topological view, compound- III represents a structure that may be related to graphite. The graphite-like sheets in compound-III (formed by the con- nectivity between the aminotriazole and Co4 clusters) are cross- linked by the NIPA units. The Schläﬂi symbol for this net is (36.4185.3.6). Structural comparison The use of three different, but related, triazoles resulted in three closely related structures in the present study. The compounds have Co5 (compound-I) and Co4 (compound-II and compound- III) clusters connected through the carboxylate and triazolate units giving rise to three dimensional structures. Though the for- mation of different cobalt clusters are difﬁcult to rationalize due Fig. 1 (a) Figure shows the pentameric cobalt cluster in compound-I.

Downloaded by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on 31/10/2014 09:36:38. to the use of hydrothermal conditions, modest attempts can be made to correlate the observed differences between the struc- tures. In considering the connectivity between the Co-centers, the triazolate units, the simple 1,2,4-triazole (compound-I) form a one-dimensional Co-triazolate-Co structure (1D) whereas the amine substituted triazoles (compound-II and compound-III) form a two-dimensional layer arrangement involving the Co-tri- azolate-Co bonding (2D). It is likely that the differences in the basicity of the three different triazoles could have contributed to this observation. The pKb values of the three aza molecules are: triazole = 11,3-amino triazole (3-AT) = 9.5 and 3,5-diamino tria- zole = 7.95. This suggests that the 3-AT and 3,5-diamino triazole are stronger bases. The stronger bases (3,5-diamino triazole and 3-AT) resulted in the formation of the 2D cobalt-triazolate layers. In addition, 3,5-diamino triazole bonds through both the amino groups resulting in a eight-connected node compared to the six- coordinated node observed in the structures of compound-I and compound-II. These observations suggest the subtle role played by the amino triazoles in the stabilization of the pcu and graph- ite-related topologies in the present structures. The pcu and primitive hexagonal nets have been observed before.22 Recently, Batten and co workers have reported a pcu net based on tetrameric cobalt clusters in [Co4(2,5pydc)4(bpe)].23 The primitive hexagonal arrangement based on pentameric copper clusters was observed in Cu5(μ3-OH)2(H2O)6{(NO2)- C6H3-(COO)2}4]·5H2O.24 Thermogravimetric studies Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on all three compounds have been carried out in ﬂowing air (ﬂow rate = 20 ml min−1) in the temperature range 30–850 °C (heating rate = 5 °C min−1) (ESI,† Fig. S18). The TGA studies indicate that the com- pound [Co5(H2O)4{(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}4(C2N3H2)2]·2H2O, compound-I, exhibits an initial weight loss of ∼5% below 150 °C, which may be due to the loss of two lattice and two coordinated water molecules (calc. 5.2%). A second weight loss of ∼2.3% observed in the temperature range 150–230 °C may correspond to the loss of the remaining two coordinated water molecules. There is a continuous weight loss from 350 °C, which may be due to losses of the carboxylate and the triazolate moieties. The total observed weight loss of 76.8% compares reasonably well with the loss of all the water molecules (co- ordinated and lattice), carboxylate and the triazolate units (calc. 70.8%). The compound [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O){(NO2)-C6H3- (COO)2}(C2N4H3)]·H2O, compound-II, also exhibits an initial weight loss of ∼11.7% in the temperature range 250–280 °C, which may be due to the loss of the two water molecules along with the loss of the –OH group (calc. 11.3%). The continuous weight loss from 350 °C may be due to losses of the carboxylate and the aminotriazolate moieties. The total observed weight loss of 68.9% is due to the loss of all the water molecules (co- ordinated and lattice), OH moieties, carboxylate and the Table 2 Selected observed bond distances in compound-I, compound-Ia, compound-Ib, compound-II and compound-III Bond Distances (Å) Bond Distances (Å) Bond Distances (Å) [Co5(H2O)4{(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}4(C2N3H2)2]·2H2O, compound-I Co(1)–O(1)#1 1.976(2) Co(1)–O(2) 2.002(2) Co(1)–N(1) 2.082(2) Co(1)–O(3) 2.176(1) Co(1)–O(4) 2.216(2) Co(1)–O(5) 2.309(1) Co(2)–N(2)#2 2.034(2) Co(2)–N(2) 2.034(2) Co(2)–O(6)#2 2.061(1) Co(2)–O(6) 2.061(1) Co(2)–O(3) 2.247(1) Co(2)–O(3)#2 2.247(2) Co(3)–O(7)#1 2.052(2) Co(3)–N(3)#3 2.069(2) Co(3)–O(8)#4 2.111(2) Co(3)–O(5) 2.117(1) Co(3)–O(9) 2.135(2) Co(3)–O(10)#4 2.222(2) [Co5{(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}4(C2N3H2)2], compound-Ia Co(1)–O(1)#1 1.969(9) Co(1)–O(2) 1.957(9) Co(1)–N(1) 2.013(12) Co(1)–O(3) 2.255(8) — — Co(1)–O(5) 2.194(8) Co(2)–N(2)#2 2.054(11) Co(2)–N(2) 2.054(11) Co(2)–O(6)#2 2.083(8) Co(2)–O(6) 2.083(8) Co(2)–O(3) 2.236(8) Co(2)–O(3)#2 2.236(8) Co(3)–O(7)#1 2.009(10) Co(3)–N(3)#4 2.077(12) Co(3)–O(8)#3 2.026(9) Co(3)–O(5) 2.038(7) — — Co(3)–O(10)#3 2.253(10) [Co5(H2O)2{(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}4(C2N3H2)2], compound-Ib Co(1)–O(1)#1 1.951(8) Co(1)–O(2) 1.922(8) Co(1)–N(1) 2.033(12) Co(1)–O(3) 2.238(8) — — Co(1)–O(5) 2.140(7) Co(2)–N(2)#2 2.087(11) Co(2)–N(2) 2.087(11) Co(2)–O(6) 2.088(7) Co(2)–O(6)#2 2.088(7) Co(2)–O(3) 2.182(9) Co(2)–O(3)#2 2.182(9) Co(3)–O(7)#1 2.002(9) Co(3)–N(3)#3 2.025(15) Co(3)–O(8)#4 2.037(8) Co(3)–O(5) 2.077(8) Co(3)–O(9) 2.34(3) Co(3)–O(10)#4 2.202(10) [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O){(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}(C2N4H3)]·H2O, compound-II Co(1)–O(1)#1 2.074(1) Co(1)–N(1) 2.085(2) Co(1)–O(1) 2.087(1) Co(1)–O(2) 2.095(2) Co(1)–O(3) 2.188(2) Co(1)–N(2)#2 2.209(2) Co(2)–O(1) 2.039(1) Co(2)–O(4) 2.040(2) Co(2)–O(5)#3 2.051(2) Co(2)–N(3)#4 2.096(2) Co(2)–N(4) 2.161(2) Co(2)–O(8) 2.594(4) [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O){(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}(C2N5H5)]·H2O, compound-III Co(1)–O(1)#1 2.043(4) Co(1)–O(2) 2.062(4) Co(1)–O(3)#2 2.085(4) Co(1)–N(1)#3 2.133(4) Co(1)–N(2) 2.137(4) Co(1)–N(5) 2.531(6) Co(2)–O(3) 2.042(4) Co(2)–N(3) 2.083(4) Co(2)–O(3)#2 2.112(4) Co(2)–O(4) 2.163(4) Co(2)–O(5) 2.175(5) Co(2)–N(4)#4 2.217(4) Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms: For compound-I: #1 −x, −y + 1, −z + 1; #2 −x + 1, −y + 1, −z + 2; #3 −x + 1, −y + 1, −z + 1; #4 −x + 1, −y + 2, −z + 1 For compound-Ia: #1 −x, −y, −z + 1; #2 −x + 1, −y + 1, −z + 1; #3 −x, −y + 1, −z; #4 −x, −y + 1, −z + 1 For compound-Ib: #1 −x, −y, −z + 1; #2 −x + 1, −y + 1, −z + 1; #3 −x, −y + 1, −z + 1; #4 −x, −y + 1, −z For compound-II: #1 −x + 1, −y, −z; #2 x, −y + 1/2, z −1/2; #3 x −1, y, z; #4 −x + 1, y −1/2, −z + 1/2 For compound-III: #1 x −1, y, z; #2 −x, −y, −z + 1; #3 −x, y −1/2, −z + 3/2 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Dalton Trans., 2012, 41, 4135–4145 | 4139 Published on 26 January 2012.

The compound [Co2(μ3-OH) (H2O){(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}(C2N5H5)]·H2O, compound-III, exhibits an initial weight loss of ∼8.8% up to 270 °C, which may be due to the loss of the two water molecules (calc. 7.5%). The weight loss from ∼270 °C may be due to loss of the OH moieties, the carboxylate and the diaminotriazolate moieties. The total observed weight loss of 65.8% compares well with the loss of all the water molecules (coordinated and lattice), OH moieties, carboxylate and the diaminotriazolate units (calc. 65.3%) (ESI,† Fig. S18). The ﬁnal calcined product in all the cases was found to be crystalline by powder XRD and corre- sponds to Co3O4 (JCPDS: 78-1970). Removal and reinsertion of the water molecules The TGA studies indicated the possibility of the removal of the water molecules from the structures. In order to check and conﬁrm the reversible adsorption of the water molecules, the compounds were heated to the temperature at which complete Fig. 2 (a) The tetrameric cobalt cluster in compound-II.

The powder XRD investigations suggested that compound-II and compound-III decompose after the removal of the water molecules (ESI,† Fig. S19 and S20). Compound I, on the other hand, appears to retain the original framework structure. We have carried out detailed investigations on the dynamics of water molecules in compound-I. (a) Thermal studies. The TGA studies of compound-I clearly indicated that the water molecules (coordinated as well as lattice) were lost below ∼230 °C. The reversibility of water adsorption was carried out in a modiﬁed TGA set up containing a port for introducing the water vapor.17c We observed that compound-I reabsorbed the water molecules immediately and reached the original weights taken at the start of the experiment. Thus, 98% of the initial weight was observed from the dehydrated weight of 92% (Fig. 5). The sample reabsorbs ∼100% when kept exposed to atmospheric conditions for a longer duration (typically 24 h). In addition, we observed a stepwise behavior during the uptake of the water molecules. This suggests the possibility of adsorp- tion by two different water molecules (coordinated and lattice) present in compound-I. In order to check the recyclability of the dehydration–hydration behavior, the dehydration and rehydration cycles were repeated twice. The studies conﬁrm that the dehydration–rehydration behavior is reversible. (b) IR spectroscopic studies. To understand and learn the reversible hydration behavior we employed IR spectroscopic studies (Perkin-Elmer, SPECTRUM 1000) of compound-I as well as the D2O exchanged samples of compound-I. The D2O sample was prepared by soaking the dehydrated sample in dry D2O overnight. The IR studies exhibited the water bands at ∼3580 and ∼3539 cm−1. The deuterated sample exhibited the appearance of two additional peaks at ∼2360 and ∼2330 cm−1 (ESI,† Fig. S21). These bands may correspond to the coordi- nated and lattice D2O stretching vibration.25 This study conﬁrms that the water molecules can be replaced fully by the D2O molecule, establishing the reversibility of the water molecules. (c) Optical studies. The removal of water molecules affects the coordination around the cobalt centers. It is known that the coordination environment around cobalt can give rise to differ- ences in the color of the sample. During the dehydration, we observed that the color changes from purple to blue. The purple color reappears after exposure to the atmospheric conditions, as expected (ESI,† Fig. S22). We wanted to investigate the color changes during the dehy- dration/hydration of compound-I using UV-vis spectroscopic studies at room temperature. We have also recorded the UV-vis spectra for the NIPA anion (Na salt of NIPA), 1,2,4-triazole along with compound-I (ESI,† Fig. S23 and S24). The NaNIPA exhibited two main absorption peaks at ∼260 nm and 335 nm, whereas the 1,2,4-triazole has two main peaks at ∼260 nm and Fig. 5 Reversible water uptake study using the TGA for compound-I. The blue curve represents the heating and the cooling cycle and the red curve represents the weight loss and weight gain.

Downloaded by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on 31/10/2014 09:36:38. ∼330 nm. For compound-I, we observed two additional peaks at ∼530 nm and ∼695 nm, which could be due to the d–d transition of the d7 (Co2+) ion. These transitions can be assigned to the 4T1g →4T1g(P) and 4T1g →4A2g(F) transitions.26 We also observed intra-ligand charge transfer bands as well. The UV-vis spectra of the dehydrated sample of compound-I exhibited absorption bands at ∼590 nm and ∼835 nm (ESI,† Fig. S25). The absorption bands at ∼590 nm could be due to the 4A2′(F) → 4E′′(P) transition and the absorption band at ∼835 could be due to the 4A2′(F) →4A2′(P) transition of the square pyramidal d7 (Co2+) ion. The effect of exposure to the atmospheric conditions of the dehydrated sample was also examined using the UV-Vis spectro- scopic studies (ESI,† Fig. S26). As can be noted, the intensity of transitions corresponding to the dehydrated state starts to decrease slowly along with the increase in the intensity of the rehydrated state as a function of time. This clearly suggests that the absorption of the water molecules changes the coordination environment around the cobalt species in compound-I. In situ Single-Crystal-to-Single-Crystal (SCSC) transformation studies The TGA studies of compound-I showed that there are two pro- minent weight losses below 230 °C. The ﬁrst one corresponds to the loss of four water molecules at 150 °C (two lattice and two coordinated) and the second corresponds to the remaining two water molecules at 230 °C (coordinated). In addition, the cyclic TGA studies indicated a stepwise behavior suggesting a possible intermediate structure during the dehydration/rehydra- tion process. We desired to investigate the dehydrated phase more closely to determine the structure as well as the stability. Studies involving solvent removal, solvent exchange and other related behavior of MOF’s have been investigated using single crystal–single crystal (SCSC) transformations.27 As part of this study, we have carried out the in situ single crystal–single crystal transformations involving the removal of the water molecules of compound-I. Structure of [Co5{(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}4(C2N3H2)2], compound-Ia From the TGA studies it appears that heating compound-I to around 230 °C would remove all the water molecules. We have made attempts to investigate the fully dehydrated phase in situ employing single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The data was collected in situ at 230 °C. The fully dehydrated sample, com- pound-Ia, has a structure that is closely related to the parent hydrated sample, compound-I. The asymmetric unit of com- pound-Ia consists of three crystallographically independent Co2+ ions, two NIPA (NIPA-1 and NIPA-2) and one triazolate (ESI,† Fig. S27). The coordination environment around Co(1) and Co(3) changes to square pyramidal geometry due to the removal of the coordinated water molecules, whereas Co(2) still retains the octahedral geometry of the parent structure, compound-I. The fully dehydrated sample, compound-Ia, retains the dimen- sionality as well as the structural integrity of the parent phase, compound-I. During the in situ SCSC transformation studies, we have stabilized the partially dehydrated/hydrated phase by carefully controlling the temperature (150 °C). This could be the inter- mediate phase observed during the re-hydration cycle in the TGA studies. The partially dehydrated phase ([Co5(H2O)2 {(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}4(C2N3H2)2], compound-Ib, had only one cobalt [Co(1)] in the square-pyramidal coordination (ESI,† Fig. S28). The lattice water molecule is fully removed. The coordination geometry of Co(2) and Co(3) remained octahedral as that of the parent structure, compound-I. The intermediate structure, observed in the present study, suggests the relative stabilities of the cobalt species in the hydrated sample, com- pound-I. Studies of this nature are not extensive in the literature. We believe such studies are necessary to understand the complex dynamics of water molecules in this family of compounds. The summary of the Single-Crystal-to-Single-Crystal (SCSC) transformation of compound-I is presented in Fig. 6. Our efforts to exchange the water molecules with other commonly used sol- vents such as methanol, acetonitrile and DMF were not success- ful. The solvent accessible void (SAV) of compound-I after the removal of the lattice water molecules was calculated to be 36.4 Å3 (3.2%) and after the removal of both the coordinated and the lattice water molecules, it was 110 Å3 (9.5%). It is likely that the available space within the structure may not be sufﬁcient for these molecules to be incorporated. Magnetic studies The presence of the cobalt clusters in the compounds prompted us to investigate the magnetic behavior. Earlier studies indicated that compounds containing tetrameric28 and pentameric29 cobalt clusters exhibit interesting magnetic behaviors. Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility studies for all three com- pounds were performed on powdered samples using a PPMS magnetometer (Quantum Design Inc., USA). At room tempera- ture, the χMT value of compound-I is 14.77 emu mol−l K for ﬁve Co2+ ions, which is considerably higher than the spin-only value (5 × 1.875 = 9.375 emu mol−l K). This may be due to the Fig. 6 A schematic representation of the Single-Crystal-to-Single- Crystal transformation of compound-I. 4142 | Dalton Trans., 2012, 41, 4135–4145 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Published on 26 January 2012.

The χMT value decreases as a function of temperature and reaches a minimum of 4.04 emu mol−l K at 3.5 K (Fig. 7a). The χM value of compound-I increases from 0.049 emu mol−l at room temperature to a maximum value of 1.14 emu mol−l at 3.5 K (Fig. 7b). A plot of 1/χM vs. T for com- pound-I in the temperature range 50–300 K can be ﬁtted to the Curie–Weiss behavior with a value for C of 16.01 emu mol−1, and θP of −27.9 K (inset Fig. 7b). The negative values of θP indicate that the dominant exchanges between the cobalt ions are antiferromagnetic. The ﬁeld-cooled (FC) and zero-ﬁeld-cooled (ZFC) studies did not exhibit any appreciable differences in the χM behavior upto 3.5 K (ESI,† Fig. S29). The magnetization studies also did not reveal any hysteresis behaviour (ESI,† Fig. S30). At room temperature the χMT values of compound-II and compound-III are 5.18 emu mol−l K and 6.05 emu mol−l K. These values are higher than the expected value for two non-coupled Co2+ ions. The common trait in many cobalt containing compounds is the large orbital contribution and in the present compounds we also observed similar behavior. The χMT value of compound-II decreases continuously as a function of temperature and reaches a minimum of 0.24 emu mol−l K at 3.5 K (Fig. 8a). The χMT value of compound-III attains a Fig. 8 Variable temperature magnetic studies of compound-II and compound-III (a) χMT–T plot (b) χM–T plot. Inset shows the 1/χM vs. T plot.

The magnetic susceptibility (χM) value of compound-II exhibits an increase as a function of temperature from 0.0172 emu mol−l at RT to 0.0595 emu mol−l at 24 K. The magnetic susceptibility value starts to decrease up to 10 K, beyond which it exhibits an increase to reach a value of 0.0684 emu mol−l at 3.5 K (Fig. 8b). In the case of compound-III, the susceptibility, χM, value increases continuously as a function of temperature from 0.0202 emu mol−l at RT to 0.3131 at 3.5 K (Fig. 8b). The ﬁeld-cooled (FC) and zero-ﬁeld-cooled (ZFC) studies did not exhibit any appreciable differences in the χM behavior up to 3.5 K (ESI,† Fig. S31 and S32). The magnetization studies also did not reveal any possible hysteresis behavior (ESI,† Fig. S33 and S34). The studies indicate that no long-range magnetic correlations between the Co2+ ions are observed in the samples, compound- II and compound-III. The 1/χM vs. T data for the samples, com- pound-II and compound-III, can be ﬁtted in the temperature range 50–300 K for the Curie–Weiss behavior, which gave a value for C of 6.33 emu mol−1 and θP of −69.3 K for com- pound-II (Inset Fig. 8b) and a value of 7.62 emu mol−1 for C and θP = −85.2 K for compound-III (Inset Fig. 8b). The high negative values of θP obtained for both compound-II and com- pound-III indicates that the exchanges between the cobalt centers are anti-ferromagnetic in nature. The larger θP value for compound-III may be due to the differences in the connectivity between the cobalt clusters (in compound-III each tetrameric cluster is connected to six other clusters via diaminotriazolate compared to four by aminotriazolate in compound-II). Conclusions The synthesis and structures of three cobalt containing metal– organic framework compounds, [Co5(H2O)4{(NO2)-C6H3- (COO)2}4(C2N3H2)2]·2H2O, compound-I, [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O) {(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}(C2N4H3)]·H2O, compound-II, and [Co2(μ3-OH)(H2O){(NO2)-C6H3-(COO)2}(C2N5H5)]·H2O, com- pound-III, have been accomplished. The compounds have pcu net (compound-I and compound-II) and a graphite-related struc- ture (compound-III). The aza-hetrocyclic ligand appears to play an important role in the modulation and stabilization of the struc- tures. The in situ SCSC transformation study clearly establishes an intermediate structure during the dehydration of compound-I. Magnetic studies indicate that the interactions between the cobalt centers are antiferromagnetic.
