Manuscript Solid-state structural transformation doubly triggered by reaction temperature and time in 3D metal-organic frameworks: great enhancement of stability and gas adsorption† Ping Shen,a Wen-Wen He,a Dong-Ying Du,a Hai-Long Jiang,c Shun-Li Li,b Zhong-Ling Lang,a Zhong-Min Su,*a Qiang Fua and Ya-Qian Lan*ab In this work, we have demonstrated an unprecedented single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) transformation between two 3D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The centrosymmetric IFMC-68 ([(Zn4O)2(L)3]$10H2O$46DMA) transforms into a chiral IFMC-69 ([(Zn4O)2(L)3H2O]$H2O$4DMA) doubly triggered by reaction temperature and time simultaneously in the presence or absence of solvent. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst representative that the non-interpenetrated structure transforms into self- penetrated structure in MOFs. For the ﬁrst time, we have studied the inﬂuence of reaction temperature and time on SCSC transformation, simultaneously, and get the transformation relationship among IFMC- 68, IFMC-69 and the intermediate coming from the direct synthesis method and stepwise synthesis method at diﬀerent temperatures and for diﬀerent times. Meanwhile, we have achieved the conversion from an air-unstable to air-stable structure. Air-stable IFMC-69 exhibits the selective CO2 uptake over N2 and more excellent gas adsorption ability than IFMC-68. In addition, IFMC-69 shows an eﬃcient capability in reversible adsorption of iodine. The electrical conductivity value (s) of I2@IFMC-69 is much higher than the pristine MOF and thus is promising for potential semiconductor materials in the future. Introduction Single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) structural trans- formations, which involve cooperative movements of atoms in the solid state, are very fascinating and one of the hot topics in solid-state chemistry.1 The rst report of SCSC transformations was a photoreaction in organic complexes,2 and then the SCSC transformations were extended to other complexes.3 In the past decades, the studies of SCSC structural transformation in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been met with great interest and have developed rapidly, because it allows direct visualization of how the crystal structure is changing during the transformation process.4 Most of these reports are the trans- formations caused by sliding of layers or the breathing of 3D porous MOFs through guest removal or solvent exchange.5 The SCSC transformations caused by photochemical [2 + 2] cyclo- additions generating new organic molecules have been well studied in coordination polymers (or MOFs).6 However, the SCSC transformations including the cleavage and regeneration of coordination bonds remain less common.7 In particular, the SCSC transformations between 3D structures are still quite rare, because it is diﬃcult for 3D MOFs to retain their crystallinity aer breaking and forming coordination bonds in the solid phase.8 Hitherto, only limited examples of 3D / 3D SCSC transformations have been observed by the groups of Kim, zur Loye and Chen.9 Therefore, studying the SCSC transformation resulting from the cleavage and regeneration of coordination bonds between 3D structures is one of the most challenging issues in synthetic chemistry and solid-state chemistry. Almost all MOF materials that have been published thus far are synthesized in a solvothermal black box using the concepts of zeolite chemistry. The reaction process is so mysterious that it prompts us to investigate what on earth happened in it, especially for the crystals synthesis process of SCSC trans- formation in the solid state. SCSC transformation can be trig- gered by external stimuli, such as light, heat, guest removal, uptake or exchange, expansion of coordination numbers, oxidation of metal centers, or reactions between the ligands.10 In previous reports on SCSC transformation reactions caused by aInstitute of Functional Material Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, P.R.

View Article Online View Journal | View Issue heat, chemists have taken into consideration the temperature inuences on the reaction.1c,11 However, SCSC transformation studies involving both the reaction temperature and time are rarely reported, and may help us understand whether the formation process of crystals via SCSC transformation is kinetically or thermodynamically controlled. It is a challenge to nd a suitable system to investigate the inuence of both reaction temperature and time on the SCSC transformation simultaneously. Herein, we report an unprecedented SCSC transformation system between two 3D MOFs. The centrosymmetric IFMC-68 ([(Zn4O)2(L)3]$10H2O$46DMA) (IFMC corresponds to Institute of Functional Material Chemistry) transforms into chiral IFMC-69 ([(Zn4O)2(L)3H2O]$H2O$4DMA) doubly triggered by reaction temperature and time simultaneously in solvent and solid state, where H4L is methanetetra(tetrakis[4-(carboxyphenyl)oxamethyl]- methane acid). To our knowledge, there are no examples of SCSC transformations between 3D structures via the dimerization of Zn4O(CO2)6 clusters by one H2O molecule. More importantly, we have achieved the conversion from an air-unstable structure to an air-stable one. Meanwhile, it is the rst representative that the non-interpenetrated structure transforms into self-penetrated structure in MOFs. Air-stable IFMC-69 exhibits the more excellent gas adsorption ability than IFMC-68. In addition, IFMC-69 shows an eﬃcient capability in reversible adsorption of iodine, and the electrical conductivity value (s) for I2@IFMC-69 is 2.80  106 S cm1, which is obviously higher than that of IFMC-69 (1.25  1013 S cm1).‡ Results and discussion A single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction study reveals that IFMC-68 crystallizes in the trigonal space group R3c. The asymmetric unit (Fig. 1a) contains one Zn4O cluster consisting of four Zn cations, one m4-O atom, and one L4 ligand. The tetrahedral Zn4O cluster is encapsulated by six carboxylate groups from diﬀerent L4 to form a classic Zn4O(CO2)6 secondary building unit (SBU). The overall structure of IFMC-68 is a 3D (4,6)-con- nected network (Fig. S1†) with ideal corundum structure, in which the L4 is regarded as a four-connected node and the Zn4O(CO2)6 SBU is regarded as a six-connected node. The resultant non-interpenetrated IFMC-68 features a quadrangular opening, and two types of microporous and mesoporous cages (Fig. 1c). With such an assembly, each microporous cage is surrounded by eight mesoporous cages, which results in very high free porosities of 80% in IFMC-68 (Fig. 1e). The structure of IFMC-68 is isomorphic to the mesoporous MOFs in Lan and Xu’s paper,13 and the cage-based MOF has been reported by the Cao group.14 IFMC-69 crystallizes in the chiral space group of P23. The asymmetric unit (Fig. 1b) contains four kinds of Zn ions, two kinds of m4-O atoms, one L4 ligand and one coordination water molecule. Zn1 and Zn2 are ve-coordinated trigonal bipyra- midal geometries, which are surrounded by three carboxylic oxygen atoms from diﬀerent ligands, one m4-O atom and one water molecule. Zn3 and Zn4 show tetrahedral coordinated geometries which are formed by three carboxylic oxygen atoms from diﬀerent ligands and one m4-O atom. Diﬀerent from the structure of IFMC-68, there are two Zn4O(CO2)6 clusters in IFMC-69. These two Zn4O(CO2)6 clusters are connected by one water molecule to generate a new [Zn4O(CO2)6]2H2O SBU. To the best of our knowledge, it represents the rst example that the classic Zn4O(CO2)6 SBU connected by water to form a new [Zn4O(CO2)6]2H2O SBU. One Zn4O cluster is coordinated by six ligands and one water molecule, which can be regarded as a 7- connected node, and each L4 ligand is bonded to four Zn4O clusters (two kinds of clusters), acting as a 4-connected node. Therefore, the overall 3D framework can be regarded as a (4,7)- connected net (Fig. S2†), which has not been reported yet. In the (4,7)-connected topology, two kinds of rings (in red and green) interpenetrate with each other, and a linker (in purple) connects the two kinds of rings to form a self-penetrated structure of IFMC-69 (Fig. S3†). If regarding the [Zn4O- (CO2)6]2H2O SBU, which is connected by twelve ligands, as a 12-connected node and each L4 ligand as a 4-connected node, the 3D framework is going to be a (4,12)-connected topology (Fig. S4†). A more interesting feature in this resultant MOF is that there are interweaved channels along the three directions (Fig. 1f), the diameter of which is 6.46 ˚A (Fig. 1d and S8†). The calculated free volume in fully desolvated IFMC-69 is 37.9% by PLATON.12 Then we perform the further study into the nature of these intricate architectures. When taking no account of the Fig. 1 (a) and (b) show the coordination environments of Zn4O(CO2)6 SBU in IFMC-68 and [Zn4O(CO2)6]2H2O SBU in IFMC-69, respectively. (c) Two types of cages in IFMC-68.

View Article Online coordination water molecule in the [Zn4O(CO2)6]2H2O SBU (Fig. S5c†), one Zn4O cluster is coordinated by six ligands to be a 6-connected node and each tetratopic ligand is bonded to four Zn4O clusters (two kinds of clusters) to be a 4-connected node, and this results in a (4,6)-connected 3D MOF (Fig. S5d and S7b†). The whole structure is composed of three parts. Two of them are separated 2-fold units which can coincide with each other by a rotation of 45 in the plane. Additionally, these two units connect with each other by sharing the third part con- sisting of ligands (shown in black in Fig. S5g†) to form a complicated 3D structure with self-penetrated character (Fig. S5c, S5e and S6†). IFMC-68 was synthesized via solvothermal reactions of semi- rigid carboxylate linker H4L, Zn(NO3)2$6H2O and 5 mL DMA or DMF at 85 C for 72 h. For IFMC-69, the other synthetic condition is similar to that for IFMC-68 only by increasing the temperature to 140 C. Owing to the similarity and the conti- nuity of the synthesis process of these two crystals, we discuss the products obtained at 140 C for diﬀerent time. Powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) data (Fig. 2) shows the products are pure IFMC-68 heated at 140 C for 24 h. Aer 48 h, PXRD of the products shows that they are the intermediates including IFMC- 68 and IFMC-69, and the small single crystals in the interme- diate are determined as IFMC-69 by X-ray single-crystal diﬀraction. More importantly, we obtain the photos of the intermediates, which provide more direct evidence for the existence of intermediates (Fig. 2). The single crystal in red circle is determined as IFMC-69 by X-ray single-crystal diﬀrac- tion, and the remaining part is IFMC-68. Aer 72 h, IFMC-69 has been completely obtained based on the original reactant H4L and Zn(NO3)2$6H2O. These investigation results demon- strate IFMC-68 is a precursor in the formation process of IFMC- 69 in direct synthesis method. There may be a SCSC trans- formation from IFMC-68 to IFMC-69 during the process. Hence, we assume that IFMC-69 may be obtained by using the step-wise method. The as-synthesized IFMC-68 (50 mg) was put into a Teon liner with 5 mL DMA and heated at 140 C for 72 h. As expected, IFMC-69 is successfully obtained from the precursor of IFMC-68, and it may be a SCSC transformation. Experiments were performed following the reported method to explore whether the transformation from IFMC-68 to IFMC-69 belongs to a solid to solid mechanism or a dissolution and re- crystallization mechanism.15 One crystal of IFMC-68 was selected and inserted into a 0.8 mm diameter melting point tube 0.3 mL DMA (Fig. 3a), and then was heated at 140 C for 72 h. The outline of the gathered crystals remained the same as IFMC-68. When pressed lightly, we got the dispersive little single crystals of IFMC-69 which can be conrmed by X-ray single-crystal analysis (Fig. 3b). The photographs taken under the optical microscope prove that there is no dissolving or re- crystallizing of any crystals, so it is a real SCSC transformation (Fig. 3). The PXRD results show that the SCSC transformation from IFMC-68 to IFMC-69 can be successfully achieved in DMF or DMA, but failed in ethanol or methanol (Fig. S9†). We try to achieve this SCSC transformation in solid-state without any solvent. The single crystal of IFMC-68 was selected and sealed in a 0.8 mm diameter melting point tube without solvent (Fig. 3c), and then it was heated at 140 C for 72 h. The result of this solid transformation was similar to the solvent transformation described above, except the crystallization of IFMC-69 changed a little, meanwhile the cubic IFMC-68 trans- formed to smaller irregular shape microcrystalline of IFMC-69 (Fig. 3d). PXRD results indicate that the as-synthesized samples match the simulated pattern of IFMC-69 very well (Fig. S10†). The aforementioned transformation process can be also ach- ieved in a sealed Teon liner, and it proves that the solid-state SCSC transformation from IFMC-68 to IFMC-69 can be realized by thermal method without any solvent. Furthermore, we discussed the reaction conditions of the SCSC transformation from IFMC-68 to IFMC-69. Firstly, IFMC- 68 was heated at diﬀerent temperatures ranging from 85 C to 160 C for 72 h in Teon reactor without solvent, and the PXRD Fig. 2 Powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns of simulated IFMC-68 (dark red), the products from direct synthesis method at 140 C for 24 h (green), 48 h (pink), 72 h (red) and simulated IFMC-69 (blue).

Downloaded by National Dong Hwa University Library on 29/03/2014 08:31:26. View Article Online patterns reveal that the SCSC transformation can take place from 140 C to 160 C (Fig. S10†). Then 140 C was selected as a representative temperature to investigate the SCSC trans- formation in solid state. We also try to monitor the SCSC transformation by variable-temperature (VT)-PXRD of IFMC-68 under air, but the results show IFMC-68 can not transform into IFMC-69 (Fig. S11†). This may be because the testing time is so short that the transformation does not have enough time to complete. Keeping this in mind, we supposed that the reaction time may be another important factor during the SCSC trans- formation. Then the inuence of the reaction time has been studied. When IFMC-68 is heated at 140 C without solvent for 6 h, it is still IFMC-68; the product is intermediate for 12–21 h; aer 24 h until up to 72 h, IFMC-69 is obtained completely. The SCSC transformation without solvent can also be detected by PXRD patterns (Fig. 4). As shown in the shadow parts, the diﬀraction intensity corresponding to (1, 0, 2) and (1, 0, 8) crystallographic planes at 4.31 (peak 1) and 8.98 (peak 2), respectively, in 2q of IFMC-68 gradually decrease from 6 h to 24 h, and new peak corresponding to (3, 0, 0) crystallographic plane at 11.07 (peak 3) in 2q of IFMC-69 starts to appear more prominently from 6 h to 24 h. From 12 h to 21 h, the prole of the PXRD patterns does not show any evidence of IFMC-68 upon further time to 24 h, indicating completion of the trans- formation into IFMC-69. In summary, IFMC-68 can transform to IFMC-69 at 140 C without solvent aer 24 h. IFMC-69 can be obtained by direct synthesis and step-wise synthesis methods. In order to further understand the mecha- nism of the SCSC transformation and explore the inuence of reaction time and temperature on the products, similar exper- iments based on diﬀerent temperatures and time have been performed. The transformation relationship between IFMC-68 and IFMC-69 is in Scheme 1, and the experimental data are listed in Table S1.† According to the data, selecting time and temperature as X and Y-axis, we get the transformation rela- tionship diagrams of IFMC-68, IFMC-69 and the intermediate coming from the direct synthesis method and stepwise synthesis methods. For the direct synthesis method in DMA or DMF (Fig. S12†), when heated at 140 C for 24 h or 130 C for 36 h or 120 C for 48–72 h, the product is IFMC-68; when heated at 160 C for 24–48 h or 150 C for 36 h or 140 C for 72 h, IFMC- 69 is attained. The area between IFMC-68 and IFMC-69 repre- sents the synthesis condition for the intermediate. Similarly, for the step-wise synthesis method (IFMC-68) in DMA or DMF (Fig. S13†) and without solvent (Fig. S14†), the areas between IFMC-68 and IFMC-69 represent the synthesis condition for the intermediate, respectively. To sum up, the SCSC trans- formations between IFMC-68 and IFMC-69 are triggered by reaction temperature and time simultaneously in either solvent or solid state. When 50 mg IFMC-69 was sealed in a Teon liner with 5 mL DMA and heated at 85, 100, 120 or 140 C for 72 h, IFMC-69 still remained. IFMC-69 cannot turn to IFMC-68 in solvent under lower temperature. Therefore, the SCSC trans- formation is irreversible. According to the phenomenon occurring in the SCSC trans- formation, we suppose the solvent molecules move faster in channels with heating, which results in the partial coordination bonds of unstable IFMC-68 breaking. Then diﬀerent Zn4O(CO2)6 SBUs move closer to each other and coordinate with the water molecules to form new [Zn4O(CO2)6]2H2O SBUs which recombine to generate the new compound (IFMC-69) in certain time. IFMC-68 is a kinetic product, formed easily from the components at relatively low temperature. With the increasing the time and temperature, this unstable product progressively converts into the thermodynamic product of IFMC-69. During the SCSC transformation process, the transformation from the Zn4O(CO2)6 SBU to the [Zn4O(CO2)6]2H2O SBU is very crucial. In order to conrm this prediction, quantum chemical calcula- tions have been performed to simulate the reaction on the basis of density functional theory method (DFT) by selecting Zn4O(CO2)6 SBU and [Zn4O(CO2)6]2H2O SBU as simple models, with the benzenes substituted by H atoms (Fig. S15†). All calculations are performed at PCM/B3LYP/[LANL2DZ(Zn)/6-31 + g*(O, H, C)] level with Gaussian 09 soware package. According to the experimental conditions reported above, the formation of IFMC-69 is carried out at 140 C. Thus the calculation condition Fig. 4 Powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns of simulated IFMC-68 (dark red), IFMC-68 in a sealed Teﬂon reactor heated at 140 C for 6 h (gray), 12 h (blue), 18 h (green), 21 h (purple), 24 h (pink), 48 h (dark green) and 72 h (orange), and simulated IFMC-69 (red).

View Article Online has been set at 438.15 K and the standard atmosphere pressure. The calculated results demonstrate the generation process of the [Zn4O(CO2)6]2H2O SBU is strongly exothermic, with enthalpy of 180.60 kcal mol1. As a result, this enthalpic contribution may drive the formation of the complex IFMC-69. Moreover, DrG is an important parameter in thermodynamic analysis, and the Gibbs free energy for this reaction shows that the formation of the [Zn4O(CO2)6]2H2O SBU is spontaneous with value of 51.94 kcal mol1. Therefore, it is clear from the theoretical simulations that the formation of IFMC-69 is thermodynami- cally favorable. Stability is one of the most crucial properties in the practical application for MOF materials.16 Therefore the measurements of the stability based on IFMC-68 and IFMC-69 in air have also been conducted. When IFMC-68 is exposed in air for 6 h, the framework is collapsed (Fig. S16†). Nevertheless IFMC-69 can retain the integrity of the framework well aer exposure in air for 2 months (Fig. S17†), presenting remarkable stability. Through the SCSC transformation we have achieved the conversion from an air-unstable MOF to an air-stable MOF. The structure features of these two compounds encourage us to study the gas sorption properties of the evacuated frame- works. The samples were fully activated by the procedure described in ESI.† The PXRD results indicate that the integrity of IFMC-69 was well maintained (Fig. S19†), but the framework of IFMC-68 collapsed to some extent since some peaks of acti- vated-IFMC-68 weakened obviously (Fig. S18†). N2 adsorption of IFMC-68 and IFMC-69 were carried out at 77 K (Fig. 5a). On the contrary to the porosity of these two compounds calculated by PLATON,12 the high porosity crystal IFMC-68 only has a N2 adsorption amount of 4.50 cm3 g1. This may be attributed to the collapse of the framework of IFMC-68 aer the removal of the solvent molecules, which is consistent with the PXRD results (Fig. S18†). All of these results (the stability of these two compounds) well agree with those from the theoretical calcu- lations. IFMC-69 displays typical Type-I sorption isotherm for microporous materials. The BET and Langmuir surface areas are 581.00 and 664.33 m2 g1, respectively, and the pore volume of IFMC-69 is 0.25 cm3 g1. The adsorption amount of N2 at saturation is approximately 165.9 cm3 g1, which is equivalent to 71.4 N2 per unit cell. Using the Horvath–Kawazoe (HK) method on the N2 adsorption isotherms, the pore size distri- bution of IFMC-69 shows its pore size is about 5.9 ˚A (Fig. S20†). The H2 adsorption amount of IFMC-69 is 119.33 cm3 g1 (1.07 wt%) and 85.46 cm3 g1 (0.74 wt%) at 77 K and 87 K (Fig. S21†), which corresponds to 51.3 and 36.8 H2 per unit cell, respectively. The H2 adsorption enthalpy of IFMC-69 is 6.63 kJ mol1 at zero coverage, which is calculated from a variant of the Clausius–Clapeyron equation,17 shown in Fig. S22b.† We also study the possible application for IFMC-69 on selective gas separation. As shown in Fig. 5b, the N2 and CO2 sorption isotherms were measured at 273 K and 298 K, respectively, and the adsorption data was listed in Table S2.† To our delight, the CO2 uptake capacity is much higher than that of N2. The calculated CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity is 32.7 : 1 at 298 K, and it is higher than those of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with colossal cages, ZIF-100 (25.0  2.4 : 1) and ZIF-95 (18.0  1.7 : 1),18 which is regarded as excellent selective carbon dioxide reservoir. The CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity for IFMC-69 is also better than that of our reported zeolite-like MOF (IFMC-1, 26.9 : 1 at 298 K).19 In addition, the distinct diﬀerence of adsorption capacities between CO2 and N2 prompts us to survey the enthalpy of CO2 adsorption. The CO2 adsorption enthalpy of IFMC-69 is 17.45 kJ mol1 at zero coverage (Fig. S22a†). All the data reveals that IFMC-69 shows the ability to absorb CO2 selectively and may be used for potential materials to separate the CO2/N2 mixture. The existing microporous pores of IFMC-69 make it suitable as a host for absorbing small molecules.20 When IFMC-69 (100 mg) was immersed in a hexane solution of I2 (3 mL, 0.01 mol L1) at room temperature, colorless IFMC-69 gradually intensied to dark brown, and the dark purple solution faded in 2 h (Fig. S23a†). The entry of I2 into the IFMC-69 host framework leads to a distinct decrease of the emission intensity with the guest inclusion amount increasing (Fig. S26b†), which is ascribed to the host–guest photoinduced electron transfer (PET) eﬀect.21 TGA analyses (Fig. S29†) show that the encapsulated amount of I2 is 29.48% and each unit cell in IFMC-69 can accommodate about 15.86 I2 molecules according to the molar ratios of I2/Zn. IFMC-68 can also adsorb I2, however, the framework of IFMC-68 partially collapsed as adsorbing I2, just as shown in the picture (Fig. S30†). So we mainly study the Fig. 5 (a) The N2 gas–sorption isotherms for IFMC-68 and IFMC-69 at 77 K, 1 atm. (b) CO2 and N2 sorption isotherms of IFMC-69 at diﬀerent temperatures (blue: CO2, 273 K; pink: CO2, 298 K; red: N2, 273 K; black: N2, 298 K). The ﬁlled and open squares represent adsorption and desorption branches, respectively. 1372 | Chem.

When the crystals of I2@IFMC-69 were soaked in dry ethanol, the color of the crystals changed gradually from dark brown to light yellow in about 2.5 h and the colorless solution deepened into dark brown (Fig. S23b†). The release of I2 resulted in the emission spectra intensity recovering by degrees (Fig. S26c†), the concentration of I2 in ethanol increased with time. So the photographs and luminescent spectrum for IFMC-69 releasing I2 demon- strate that the I2 sorption progress of IFMC-69 is reversible. The tests of the electrical conductivity values (s) of I2@IFMC-69 and IFMC-69 were carried out. Notably, we get the electrical conductivity values (s) of 2.80  106 S cm1 for I2@IFMC-69 which is 2.24  107 times higher than IFMC-69 (1.25  1013 S cm1). When IFMC-69 is adsorbing I2, the potential intermolecular interactions between I2 and p-electron walls are important, as they allow a single path for I2 molecules to access and be restricted within well-regulated narrow limits within the channels, inducing n / s* charge transfer (CT).22,23 Such an arrangement can result in cooperative electrical conductivity for I2@IFMC-69. Therefore, I2@IFMC-69 could be used for poten- tial semiconductor materials in the future. Experimental Synthesis of IFMC-68 ([(Zn4O)2(L)3]$10H2O$46DMA) A solution of Zn(NO3)2$6H2O (0.150 g, 0.504 mmol) and H4L (0.050 g, 0.081 mmol) in DMA (5 mL) was heated at 85 C for 72 h in a Teon-lined steel container. The resulting colorless crystals were collected, washed with Et2O, and dried at room temperature (yield: 79% based on H4L).

The process of SCSC transformation Method 1: 50 mg IFMC-68 was sealed in a Teon liner with 5 mL DMA and heated at 140 C for 72 h, the colorless block single crystals of IFMC-69 were collected. Method 2: 50 mg IFMC-68 was sealed in a Teon liner without solvent and heated at 140 C for 24 h, the colorless block single crystals of IFMC-69 were collected. Conclusions In summary, we have reported here an interesting example of a solid-state SCSC transformation from an achiral MOF into a chiral MOF. To our knowledge, it is the rst representative that the non-interpenetrated structure transforms into a self-pene- trated structure in MOFs. There are the dimerization of Zn4O clusters [Zn4O(CO2)6]2H2O in IFMC-69, and it represents the rst example that the classic Zn4O(CO2)6 SBU connected by water. More importantly, we have achieved the conversion from an air-unstable structure to an air-stable one, and the air-stable IFMC-69 exhibits the selective CO2 uptake over N2 and more excellent gas adsorption ability than IFMC-68. We unprece- dentedly study the inuence of reaction temperature and time on SCSC transformation simultaneously, and then get the transformation relationship diagrams of IFMC-68, IFMC-69 and the intermediate coming from the direct synthesis method and stepwise synthesis method based on diﬀerent temperatures and time. Unusually, it is doubly triggered by reaction temperature and time simultaneously in either solvent or solid-state. I2 adsorption experiments of IFMC-69 exhibit a reversible process, and the electrical conductivity value (s) of I2@IFMC-69 is much higher than that of IFMC-69. Therefore, I2@IFMC-69 can be used for potential semiconductor materials. Taking advantage of the above-mentioned study, the progress and mechanism of the SCSC transformation have been well understood, which can help us to learn more about the conversion nature of SCSC transformation and synthesize more SCSC materials in the future.

Materials and instrumentations for measurements Tetrakis[4-(carboxyphenyl)oxamethyl]methane acid (H4L) was synthesized according to the published procedures.1 All of the chemical materials were purchased and used without further purification. The FT-IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the range 4000-400 cm-1 on a Mattson Alpha-Centauri spectrometer. The C, H, and N elemental analyses were conducted on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. The phase purities of the bulk samples were identified by X-ray powder diffraction on a Rigaku, Rint 2000 diffractometer. TGA was measured on a Perkin–Elmer TG-7 analyzer heated from room temperature to 1000 ºC at a ramp rate of 5 °C/min under nitrogen. The photoluminescence spectra were performed on a Perkin-Elmer FLS-920 Edinburgh Fluorescence Spectrometer. The N2, H2 and CO2 sorption measurements were performed on an automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (Belsorp mini II). Before gas adsorption measurements, the sample was immersed in methanol for 24 h, and the liquid was poured out. Fresh methanol was added subsequently, and the crystals were stay for an additional 24 h to remove the nonvolatile solvates (DMF). The extract was decanted and fresh methanol was added once more. The sample was collected by decanting and treated with dichloromethane similarly to remove methanol solvates. After the removal of dichloromethane by decanting, the sample was activated by drying under a dynamic vacuum at room temperature overnight. Before the measurement, the sample was dried again by using the ‘outgas’ function of the surface area analyzer for 12 h at room temperature. S2. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for IFMC-68 and IFMC-69 were recorded by using a Bruker Apex CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71069 Å) at 293 K. Absorption corrections were applied by using a multi-scan technique. All the structures were solved by the direct method of SHELXS-972 and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques using the SHELXL-97 program within WINGX3. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic temperature parameters. Contributions to scattering due to these solvent molecules were removed using the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON4; structures were then refined again using the data generated. The detailed crystallographic data and structure refinement parameters for IFMC-68 and IFMC-69 are summarized in article. S3. Electrical conductivity values (σ) of IFMC-69 and I2@IFMC-69 A bulk sample of colorless crystals of IFMC-69 was washed with anhydrous methanol (3×50 mL), and then the crystals were soaked for 24 h. Then the crystals were similarly washed three times with dichloromethane (3×50 mL)-again, and crystals were soaked for 24 hours before the dichloromethane was decanted. The solvent was decanted after the final dichloromethane wash, and the resultant crystals were evacuated with an oil pump at 45 °C for 2 hours to give 0.9 g of IFMC-69. Half of the activated IFMC-69 were immersed in the hexane solution of I2 (0.05 mol/L) for 24 hours, Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Science This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 and then were evacuated with an oil pump at 45 °C for 2 hours to give 0.49 g of activated I2@IFMC-69. Then the activated IFMC-69 and I2@IFMC-69 were grinded to powder and pressed into a 1 mm thickness film respectively. Square resistances are 3.57 × 105 Ω for I2@IFMC-69 and 8.00 × 1013 Ω for IFMC-69, respectively. Converted into electrical conductivity, the values (σ) are 2.80 × 10−6 S/cm for I2@IFMC-69 which is in the semiconductor range and 1.25 × 10−13 S/cm for IFMC-69, respectively. References: [S1] D.

Neglecting the coordination water molecules of IFMC-69, it can be regarded as a (4,6)-connected structure. Looking at the augmented forms in which the vertices are the points of extension. For example, the C atoms of the linker tetrahedron and the carboxylate C atoms of the metal SBU are the vertices. The cubic (4,6)-connected net is exceptional in the extent of self-entanglement. It is also very dense, the topological density is TD10 = 3326, comparing the topological density for IFMC-68 (TD10 = 1345). The short Schläfli symbol is (42∙63∙8)3∙(43∙66∙86)2, the long Schläfli symbol is (4∙4∙62∙62∙64∙810)3∙(4∙4∙4∙62∙62∙62∙62∙62∙62∙83∙83∙83∙85∙85∙85). The relatively large subscripts show that the rings are very non-planar. Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Science This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Scheme S1. The angles between ligand and Zn4O cluster in IFMC-68 and IFMC-69. The distances between the center carbon atom in the ligand and the center of Zn4O clusters are in the range from 11.35 to 11.39 Å for IFMC-68, and 11.19 to 11.30 Å for IFMC-69, respectively. It is obviously that the distances between the center carbon atom in the ligand and the center of Zn4O clusters are changed after the SCSC transformation. As is shown in Table S2, the angles of C1,2,3,4–Cc–C1,2,3,4 have changed in 1-2º after the SCSC transformation. And the angles of Cp–Cc–Cp are in the range from 86 to 136 º for IFMC-68, and 102 to 130 º for IFMC-69. The different distances between the center carbon atom in the ligand and the center of Zn4O cluster, and the different angles of Cp–Cc–Cp and C1,2,3,4–Cc–C1,2,3,4 result in the different conformations of the ligands in IFMC-68 and IFMC-69. Therefore, we consider that the cooperative bond breakage, formation and the comformational change of the ligand lead to the different structure of IFMC-68 Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Science This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 and IFMC-69. As is known to us, the angle of the centre tetrahedral geometrical conFigureuration is 109.28º. For IFMC-68, the four arms of the ligand are in a highly distorted tetrahedral orientation. For IFMC-69, the ligands also adopt a conformation that holds the four arms in a distorted tetrahedral orientation, it is closer to regular tetrahedral geometrical conFigureuration than that of IFMC-68.
