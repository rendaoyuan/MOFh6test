Dau, Luis R. Polanco, and Seth M. Cohen* Received (in XXX, XXX) Xth XXXXXXXXX 20XX, Accepted Xth XXXXXXXXX 20XX DOI: 10.1039/b000000x The synthesis and physical properties of dioxole functionalized metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are 5 reported. Combination of benzo[d][1,3]dioxole-4,7-dicarboxylic acid (dioxole-BDC) and Zn(II) under solvothermal conditions yields either an isoreticular metal-organic framework analog (IRMOF-1-dioxole) or a new MOF material (MOF-1-dioxole). With the addition of a co-ligand, namely 4,4'-bipyridine, a mixed-linker Zn(II)-paddlewheel MOF (BMOF-2-dioxole) is obtained. The structure of all three MOFs has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. MOF-1-dioxole reveals that the dioxole 10 group binds to the Zn(II) ions, while there is no such binding in IRMOF-1-dioxole or BMOF-2-dioxole, hence preserving the parent topology of these frameworks. Thermal gravimetric analysis and gas sorption studies reveal quite different physical properties for each of these functionalized MOFs. Introduction Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have become promising 15 materials for a wide range of applications such as catalysis,1 gas storage,2 separation3, 4 and biomedicine.5 Such applications have been advanced by the functional and structural diversity of MOFs. The functionalization of MOFs can be achieved via direct solvothermal synthesis6, 7 or postsynthetic modification (PSM).8 20 In both methods, the aim is to decorate a known MOF with desirable functional groups without changing the topology or crystallinity of the framework. The former point is particularly important because the topology of the framework plays a central role in the porosity and physical properties of the MOF.9 For 25 example, the functionalization of cubic IRMOFs (IRMOF = isoreticular MOF) has been successfully achieved via direct solvothermal synthesis.10 The direct synthesis of such materials requires that the functional groups on the ligand not interfere with the formation of the IRMOF. Properties such as the pore size of 30 the IRMOFs can be tuned via this method. The physical properties of MOFs can also be tuned via PSM.11, 12 The group of Matzger has pioneered the exploration of polymorphic frameworks,13, 14 where MOF ‘isomers’ are obtained from identical ligand-metal combinations, where synthesis 35 conditions such as metal-to-ligand ratio, solvent, reaction time, concentration, and temperature have been systematically changed. Such observations indicate that the synthesis conditions play a key role in the construction of a given MOF. Again, functional groups on the ligand can interfere with the synthesis of 40 a desired MOF isomer. For example, Cohen and co-workers illustrated that 2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (CAT-BDC) cannot be incorporated directly into UMCM-1 (UMCM = University of Michigan Crystalline Materials) presumably due to the metal-binding catechol group on the 45 ligand.15 However, CAT-BDC can be incorporated into the UMCM-1 framework via a postsynthetic deprotection (PSD) strategy, by first masking the catechol group with a photocleavable protecting group. In a related report, another protected version of the CAT-BDC ligand, benzo[d][1,3]dioxole- 50 4,7-dicarboxylic acid (dioxole-BDC) could be incorporated into UMCM-1 framework as well.16 Herein, we report further exploration of dioxole-BDC in three Zn(II)-based frameworks. Subtle changes in the solvothermal conditions yield two different isomeric MOFs, namely IRMOF-1-dioxole and MOF-1-dioxole. 55 The combination of dioxole-BDC, 4,4'-bipyridine (4,4'-bpy), and Zn(II) under similar solvothermal conditions yields the expected BMOF-2-dioxole (BMOF = 4,4'-bpy MOF, Scheme 1). The X- ray structures of the two isomeric MOFs reveal that the different topology arises due to coordination of the dioxole group to the 60 Zn(II) ions, an interaction not observed in any other dioxole-BDC derived framework. Interestingly, while the thermal and sorption properties of dioxole functionalized IRMOF and BMOF are similar to their isoreticular analogs, MOF-1-dioxole has notably different thermal and gas sorption properties. 65 Experimental Methods General Starting materials and solvents were purchased and used without further purification from commercial suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, EMD, TCI, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., 70 and others). Dioxole-BDC was synthesized as previously reported.16 MOFs synthesis Synthesis of IRMOF-1-dioxole. Dioxole-BDC (87 mg, 0.4 mmol) 75 and Zn(NO3)2•6H2O (346 mg, 1.1 mmol) were dissolved in N,N- dimethylforamide (DMF, 10 mL) in a scintillation vial. The vial was transferred to an isothermal oven at 100 °C for 18 h. Transparent, yellow, cubic crystals were obtained after 18 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the crystals were rinsed 80 Page 2 of 6 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by North Carolina State University on 08 January 2013 Published on 08 January 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3DT32588A View Article Online 2 | Journal Name, [year], [vol], 00–00 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry [year] with DMF (3×10 mL). The solvent was then exchanged with CHCl3 (3×10 mL) for 3 d, with fresh CHCl3 replaced every day. The crystals were stored in CHCl3 prior to further analysis. Synthesis of MOF-1-dioxole. Dioxole-BDC (87 mg, 0.4 mmol) 5 and Zn(NO3)2•6H2O (346 mg, 1.1 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (10 mL) in a scintillation vial. The vial was transferred to a programmable oven. The oven was programmed to ramp from 35 °C to 100 °C at 2.5 °C/min, and held at 100 °C for 18 h, followed by a ramping down to 35 °C at 2.5 °C/min. 10 Transparent, yellow, needles were obtained. After cooling down to room temperature, the crystals were rinsed with DMF (3×10 mL). The solvent was then exchanged with CHCl3 (3×10 mL) for 3 d, with fresh CHCl3 replaced every day. The crystals were stored in CHCl3 prior to further analysis. 15 Scheme 1. The synthesis of dioxole-functionalized MOFs. Synthesis of BMOF-2-dioxole. Dioxole-BDC (87 mg, 0.4 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2•6H2O (346 mg, 1.1 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (10 mL) in a scintillation vial. 4,4'-Bpy (31 mg, 0.2 mmol) was 20 added to the mixture. The mixture was then sonicated for ~5 mins to obtain a clear, yellow solution. The vial was kept either in an isothermal oven or a programmable oven following the synthetic procedures described for IRMOF-1-dioxole and MOF- 1-dioxole. In both cases, transparent, yellow, needles were 25 obtained. After cooling down to room temperature, the crystals were rinsed with DMF (3×10 mL). The solvent was then exchanged with CHCl3 (3×10 mL) for 3 d, with fresh CHCl3 replaced every day. The crystals were stored in CHCl3 prior to further analysis. 30 MOF Characterization Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD). Approximately 20-30 mg of MOF materials were air dried for ~1 min prior to the PXRD analysis. PXRD data was collected at ambient temperature on a 35 Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using a LynxEye detector at 40 kV, 40 mA for Cu Kα (λ= 1.5418 Å), with a scan speed of 1 sec/step, a step size of 0.02°, 2θ range of 2-45°. Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction. Single crystals of IRMOF-1- 40 dioxole, MOF-1-dioxole, and BMOF-2-dioxole taken from CHCl3 or DMF were mounted on nylon loops with paratone oil and placed under a nitrogen cold stream. Data was collected on a Bruker Apex diffractometer using either Mo Kα (λ= 0.71073 Å) or Cu Kα (λ= 1.5418 Å) radiation controlled using the APEX 45 2010 software package. A multi-scan method utilizing equivalents was employed to correct for absorption. All data collections were solved and refined using the SHELXTL17 software suite. Structures were treated with the “SQUEEZE” protocol in PLATON18 to account for partially occupied or 50 disordered solvent (e.g. CHCl3 or DMF) within the porous frameworks. Digestion and Analysis by 1H NMR. MOF materials (~10 mg) were dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight. MOFs 55 were then digested with DMSO-d6 (500 µL) and 35% DCl in D2O (100 µL). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1H NMR) were recorded by a Varian FT-NMR spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H). Chemical shifts were quoted in parts per million (ppm) referenced to the appropriate solvent peak or 0 ppm for TMS. 60 Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed using a ThermoFinnigan LCQ-DECA mass spectrometer and the data was analyzed using the Xcalibur software suite. The samples for MS analysis were 65 obtained from the 1H NMR digestion samples. Gas Sorption Analysis. ~15-90 mg of MOF was evacuated under vacuum for ~1 min at room temperature. Samples were then transferred to a pre-weighed sample tube and degassed at 105 °C 70 on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Adsorption Analyzer for a minimum of 12 h or until the outgas rate was <5 mHg/min. The sample tube was re-weighed to obtain a consistent mass for the degassed MOF. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (m2/g) measurements were collected at 77 K with N2 on a 75 Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The samples were then manually degased at 105 °C for at least 2 h under vacuum prior to N2 and CO2 sorption measurements. Thermal Analysis. Approximately 10-15 mg of MOF was used 80 for thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements, which were obtained immediately after collection of gas sorption data (i.e. activated samples). Samples were analyzed under a stream of N2 (10 mL/min) using a TA Instrument Q600 SDT running from room temperature to 600 °C with a ramping rate of 5 °C/min. 85 Result and Discussion In order to examine the effects of dioxole group on the topology of MOFs, we choose to combine dioxole-BDC with Zn(II) due to the variety of highly crystalline and high surface area MOFs that 90 can be obtained from carboxylic acid ligands and Zn(II) (e.g. IRMOF-1, UMCM-1, MOF-177, MOF-200).2 The combination between Zn(NO3)2•6H2O and dioxole-BDC (2.8:1 ratio) in DMF under isothermal condition yielded yellow, cubic crystals (Fig. Page 3 of 6 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by North Carolina State University on 08 January 2013 Published on 08 January 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3DT32588A View Article Online This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry [year] Journal Name, [year], [vol], 00–00 | 3 S1), which were determined to be IRMOF-1-dioxole. Single X- ray diffraction (XRD) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of the crystals revealed that they were isostructural to IRMOF-1 (Fig. 1 and 2). IRMOF-1-dioxole possesses discrete Zn4O secondary building units (SBUs), with the dioxole-BDC 5 ligands acting as bridges to connect the SBUs together (Fig. 1). The dioxole functional groups cannot be located in the crystal structure of IRMOF-1-dioxole due to the disordered nature of MOF crystals (space group Fm-3m). However, 1H NMR digestion and mass spectrometry (MS) of IRMOF-1-dioxole 10 confirm the intact dioxole-BDC ligands in the framework after the solvothermal synthesis (Fig. S2 and S3). Fig 1. Crystal structure of IRMOF-1-dioxole, highlighting the Zn4O SBU. The dioxole groups cannot be located, only disordered oxygen 15 atoms were found in the difference map (shown). Color scheme: carbon (gray), oxygen (red), zinc (green). Fig. 2. Simulated (dotted lines) and experimental (solid lines) PXRD patterns of dioxole functionalized MOFs. IRMOF-1-dioxole (black), 20 MOF-1-dioxole (blue), and BMOF-2-dioxole (green). Surprisingly, the same combination of Zn(NO3)2•6H2O and dioxole-BDC (2.8:1 ratio) in DMF under ramped thermal condition (see Experimental Methods) yielded yellow needles (Fig. S1), which were designated as MOF-1-dioxole. PXRD and 25 XRD analysis of MOF-1-dioxole reveals the framework possessed a distinct structure from the cubic IRMOFs (Fig. 2 and 3). MOF-1-dioxole possesses infinite SBUs that contain pseudo- octahedral Zn(II) ions (Fig. 3). The distorted-octahedral Zn(II) ion is coordinated by four dioxole-BDC ligands. Two of the 30 dioxole-BDC ligands act as monodentate ligands, while the other two are bound as bidentate ligands. One of the bidentate dioxole- BDC ligands bind via the oxygen of the dioxole group, which results in strict ordering of the dioxole groups that are clearly located in the XRD structure determination (unlike in IRMOF-1- 35 dioxole, Fig. 3). Nevertheless, both the monodentate and bidentate ligands act in a bridging manner to connect the Zn(II) ions together. Although the SBUs and strict topologies of IRMOF-1-dioxole and MOF-1-dioxole are very different, MOF- 1-dioxole still possesses a similar square, porous channel lattice 40 structure (Fig. 3). However, MOF-1-dioxole only possesses only 1-dimensional pores/channel due to the infinite SBU structures. Expectedly, 1H NMR and ESI-MS analysis of MOF-1-dioxole confirm the intact dioxole-BDC ligand in the framework (Fig. S2 and S4). 45 Fig 3. Crystal structure of MOF-1-dioxole, highlighting the infinite SBUs, the monodentate dioxole-BDC (black), and the bidentate dioxole- BDC (blue). On the right, the zinc atoms are displayed as cyan and green spheres, representing the different coordination environments of the two, 50 pseudo-octahedral Zn(II) ions in the framework. Color scheme on the left: carbon (gray), oxygen (red), zinc (green). To extend these studies, the dioxole functional group was utilized in a mixed-linker, Zn(II)-paddlewheel MOF. The combination of Zn(NO3)2•6H2O, dioxole-BDC, and 4,4'-bpy 55 (2.8:1:0.5 ratio) in DMF under both ramping and isothermal conditions yielded only one common crystal morphology (Fig. S1). PXRD analysis of the crystals from the two different solvothermal conditions revealed the same framework structure (Fig. 2). XRD analysis of BMOF-2-dioxole shows the 60 framework possesses the anticipated Zn(II)-paddlewheel SBUs, coordinated by four dioxoxle-BDC ligands and two pillaring 4,4'- bpy ligands (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the porous channels of the BMOF-2-dioxole are large enough for a second net to penetrate through the channels, resulting in 2-fold interpenetrated 65 framework (Fig. 4). In contrast to the crystal structure of IRMOF-1-dioxole, the dixole groups in BMOF-2-dioxole are not disordered and were located in the difference map (Fig. 4). The lack of disorder in this structure may be due to the framework interpenetration. 1H NMR and ESI-MS of BMOF-2-dioxole also 70 confirms the intact dioxole groups upon framework digestion (Fig. S2 and S5).

Crystal structure of BMOF-2-dioxole, highlighting the interpenetrated net (orange) and the SBU. Color scheme: carbon (gray), nitrogen (blue), oxygen (red), zinc (green). Due to the differences in structure, it is expected that IRMOF- 5 1-dioxole and MOF-1-dioxole will have different physical properties. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine the thermal stability of these frameworks (Fig. 5). Similar to functionalized IRMOFs or functionalized Zn(II)- paddlewheel MOFs, IRMOF-1-dioxole and BMOF-2-dioxole 10 degrade at ~450 °C and 350 °C, respectively.19-21 In contrast to IRMOF-1-dioxole, MOF-1-dioxole degrades more readily at ~350 oC. The difference in thermal stability between IRMOF-1- dioxole and MOF-1-dioxole is not unexpected due to the structural differences (e.g. connectivity, bonding). However, it 15 shows that the effect of dioxole group on the structure of MOFs can induce a change in thermal stability of the frameworks, even when the frameworks contained the same chemical compositions (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and zinc) with different chemical empirical formula (Table S2 and S3). The Brunauer-Emmett- 20 Teller (BET) surface areas of IRMOF-1-dioxole, MOF-1-dioxole, and BMOF-2-dioxole are 2516 ± 83 m2 g-1, 428±31 m2 g-1, and 5±2 m2/g, respectively (Table S1). While the BET surface area and N2 isotherm of BMOF-2-dioxole reveal that the framework is non-porous to N2 (Table S1 and Fig. 6), the BET surface areas of 25 IRMOF-1-dioxole is similar to IRMOF-1-NH2 (2409 m2 g-1) and ~6× greater than MOF-1-dioxole.22 Furthermore, the N2 isotherm of IRMOF-1-dioxole show similarly greater saturation uptake capacity compared to MOF-1-dioxole. Although the structures of MOF-1-dioxole and IRMOF-1-dioxole both show similar open 30 square channels, their diameters differ significantly based on the crystal structure (MOF-1-dioxole ~12.6 Å versus IRMOF-1- dioxole ~18.3 Å and BMOF-2-dioxole ~15.1 Å, respectively). In addition, the low BET surface area of MOF-1-dioxole is likely due to the dense packing of the framework. While N2 isotherm of 35 IRMOF-1-dioxole show no hysteresis, the N2 isotherm of MOF- 1-dioxole shows some hysteresis at low pressure (<100 mmHg) and at high pressure (>600 mmHg) (Fig. 6). The PXRD pattern of activated IRMOF-1-dioxole is similar to the PXRD pattern of the framework prior to activation, while the PXRD of activated 40 MOF-1-dioxole shows significant differences from as-prepared MOF-1-dioxole (Fig. S6). This suggests that MOF-1-dioxole undergoes a phase-change upon activation (e.g. flexibility or ‘breathing’).12, 20, 23 The phase-change of MOF-1-dioxole upon activation is the likely origin of the low N2 uptake capacity in 45 comparison with IRMOF-1-dioxole. Fig 5. TGA of IRMOF-1-dioxole (black), MOF-1-dioxole (blue), and BMOF-2-dioxole (green), highlighting the differences in thermal stability. 50 Fig. 6. N2 isotherms (77 K) of IRMOF-1-dioxole (black squares), MOF- 1-dioxole (blue triangles), and BMOF-2-dioxole (green circles). Filled symbols are adsorption and empty symbols are desorption. We further studied the CO2 sorption at 196 K of the dioxole- functionalized MOFs to probe the CO2/N2 uptake selectivity of 55 these MOFs. The CO2 and N2 isotherm sorption were not collected at the same temperature; however, these sorption experiments were collected at the standard temperature for each gas in order to measure the maximum uptake capacity of these frameworks.4 IRMOF-1-dioxole shows good CO2 uptake at 196 60 K, but does not display selectivity between CO2 and N2. MOF-1- dioxole and BMOF-2-dioxole show moderate CO2 uptake capacity at 196 K; however, the overall CO2 uptake capacity (~210 cm3/g at 196 K) of MOF-1-dioxole is ~25% greater than its N2 uptake capacity (~150 cm3 g-1 at 77 K), and BMOF-2-dioxole 65 shows very selective uptake for CO2 (196 K) over N2 (77 K) at 760 mmHg (Fig. 6 and 7). The selective CO2 uptake of BMOF- 2-dioxole is likely due to the breathing phenomena evidenced by the changes of PXRD analysis of the activated sample. The PXRD analysis of activated BMOF-2-dixole shows substantial 70 differences in comparison to the MOF prior to activation (Fig. S6) and suggests the framework undergo a phase-change upon activation. The selective uptake and phase-change of BMOF-2- Page 5 of 6 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by North Carolina State University on 08 January 2013 Published on 08 January 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3DT32588A View Article Online This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry [year] Journal Name, [year], [vol], 00–00 | 5 dioxole is not unexpected as many similar results on Zn(II)- paddlewheel MOFs have reported.11, 24, 25 Furthermore, the calculated void volume of BMOF-2-dioxole suggests that the low gas uptake is not solely due to interpenetration because the framework possesses a moderate void volume (Table S2). The 5 gas sorption selectivity of the framework isomers found here demonstrates the role of the functional groups and the synthesis conditions in both topology and resulting physical properties (i.e. gas separations) of the MOFs. 10 Fig. 7. CO2 isotherms (196 K) of IRMOF-1-dioxole (black squares), MOF-1-dioxole (blue triangles), and BMOF-2-dioxole (green circles). Filled symbols are adsorption and empty symbols are desorption. Conclusions In conclusion, we have presented the synthesis of two isomeric 15 MOFs and one interpenetrated mixed-linker MOF from dioxole- BDC. The pure phases of the two MOF isomers can be obtained by a subtle change in the synthesis condition and show structural differences due to the interactions between the dioxole groups and Zn(II) ions. The findings show that the same metal-ligand 20 combination can lead to very different MOF topologies by employing slightly different synthetic conditions. This suggests that many more frameworks may be accessible using existing ligand systems, by simply exploring new reaction conditions. Importantly, these isomeric frameworks display different physical 25 and gas sorption properties, which suggests that new frameworks with distinct properties may be discovered even with known metal-ligand combinations.
