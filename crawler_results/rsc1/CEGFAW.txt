Introduction Supramolecular isomerism is one of the most important aspect of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering and has attracted great interest in recent years.1–5 The most important challenge encountered in this area is the rational design and controlled syntheses of definite superstructures among the imaginable supramolecular isomers with the same composition. Since the crystal packing involves many factors such as intermolecular interactions including van der Waals interaction, actually in most cases the accurate prediction is unaccessible. For example, even in the simple systems of binary and linearly-coordinated univalent metal imidazolates and triazolates recently reported by us,3,4 in which the possible local superstructure could be approximately predicted, the crystal growth for specific isomers or com- pounds with desired superstructure is still a problem. Therefore variation of the reaction conditions for obtaining single crystals with specific superstructures is a necessary and effective approach. We have successfully employed a molecular templating strategy to isolate two pseudo-polymorphs of molecular polygons constructed by Cu(I) atoms and m-bridging 2-methyl- imidazolate recently.3a It is well-known that the possible superstructures for this simple binary univalent metal imida- zolate system could be categorized to three types: achiral chains, helical chains, and cyclic polygons, in which the first type was widely encountered while the latter two types remain rare and more interesting.4a,5 Unfortunately, the helical superstructure for copper(I) 2-methylimidazolate could not be acquired through many experimental methods, although a triple-stranded helical compund of copper(I) 2-ethylimidazo- late was isolated.3b A question naturally occurred on whether the aforementioned superstructures could be constructed if Cu(I) atoms are replaced by Ag(I) ones? Through similar reaction conditions, three one-dimensional (1-D) pseudo- polymorphs of silver(I) 2-methylimidazolate, or supramole- cular isomers containing different solvent molecules, namely [Ag4(mim)4?(C6H6)]‘ (Hmim 5 2-methylimidazole) (1a), [Ag4(mim)4?(C8H10)]‘ (1b), and [Ag(mim)]‘ (1c), have been isolated, which are quite different from the copper(I) analogues. Here we report the crystal structures of these pseudo-polymorphs, in which 1a exhibits peculiar pseudo-81 helices, and 1b shows S-shaped chains, whereas 1c exhibits zigzag chains. It should be mentioned here that a crystal structure having the same formula of 1c was recently reported,6 but the crystal structure should be wrongly determined and should not be an isomer of 1c.7 Experimental Commercially available reagents are used as received without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed on an Elementar Vario EL elemental analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded with Cu Ka radiation (1.5418 A˚ ) on a Rigaku D/max 2200 vpc X-ray diffractometer. The calculated PXRD pattern was produced using the SHELXTL-XPOW program and single- crystal diffraction data.

X-Ray crystallography Data collections for the three compounds were performed with Mo Ka radiation (l 5 0.71073 A˚ ) on a Bruker Apex CCD diffractometer (T 5 123(2) K for 1a and 1b, T 5 298(3) K for 1c). Absorption corrections were applied by using multi-scan program SADABS.8 All the structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 with SHELXTL.9 Non-hydrogen atoms except for solvent molecules in 1a and 1b were refined anisotropically. Solvent atoms in 1b were refined disordered in site occupancy. Hydrogen atoms on organic ligands of the three compounds were generated by riding mode (C–H 0.95 A˚ ). Crystallographic data for these compounds are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles were summarized in Table 2. CCDC reference numbers 298841–298843. For crystallo- graphic data in CIF or other electronic format see DOI: 10.1039/b602465c Results and discussion Synthesis In our previous report, the various hydro(solvo)thermal conditions were used to prepare the pseudo-polymorphs of copper(I) 2-methylimidazolate, wherein the different but appropriate sizes of solvent molecules play a key role in the formation of polygons with different sizes (octagons and decagons).3a In our current endeavour we wished to extend this methodology to incorporate Ag(I) ions in place of Cu(I) ions that have a similar coordination geometry in this kind of binary system. However, so far hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis for silver(I) 2-methylimidazolate could not give suitable single crystals for single-crystal diffraction, although we successfully used this method in obtaining some single crystals of analogous silver(I) imidazolates.3c Furthermore, because of the very low solubility of this kind of coordination polymers, common solvent evaporation is inaccessible for the crystal growth. Therefore the liquid diffusions with various molar ratios of reactants in the diffusion layers were utilized for the crystallization of the single crystals of silver(I) 2-methylimida- zolate. The single crystals of 1a could be obtained when the solution of Hmim in methanol/benzene was layered onto the solution of silver(I) salts in aqueous ammonia in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry; the presence of benzene and aqueous ammonia were essential for this process. The solvent benzene molecule can be regarded as the template for inducing the formation of 1a via host–guest supramolecular interactions, whereas the absence of benzene resulted in the generation of 1c with a dense packing pattern without any guest molecule in the crystal structure. Aqueous ammonia, acting as a competing ligand, strong base as well as solvent, could not be replaced by other organic bases such as triethyl amine, ethylene diamine, indicating that ammonia was critical for the production of this kind of pseudo-polymorphs, in accord with our previous experiments.3,4 Another guest-containing pseudo- polymorph 1b was produced while larger solvent molecules of Table 1 Crystallographic data and structure refinement details for the three pseudo-polymorphs 1a 1b 1c Empirical formula C22H26Ag4N8 C24H30Ag4N8 C4H5AgN2 Mr 833.99 862.04 188.97 Space group Pnna (no.52) P21/c (no.14) P21/n (no.14) a/A˚ 19.6228(8) 12.6836(16) 7.8906(7) b/A˚ 10.4307(4) 19.726(2) 5.9706(5) c/A˚ 12.7867(5) 11.1137(13) 10.8708(9) b/u 90 101.835(3) 92.452(1) V/A˚ 3 2617.18(18) 2721.6(6) 511.67(8) Z 4 4 4 Dc/g cm23 2.117 2.104 2.453 m/mm21 2.975 2.865 3.790 R1 [I ¢ 2s(I)] 0.0249 0.0423 0.0260 wR2 (all data) 0.0656 0.1094 0.0533 S 1.048 1.047 1.047 Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles (u) for the three pseudo-polymorphs 1a Ag1–N1 2.082(2) Ag2–N3 2.075(2) Ag2–N2 2.071(2) Ag3–N4 2.071(2) Ag1–Ag3B 3.2451(2) Ag2–Ag2D 2.9848(4) N1A–Ag1–N1 172.4(1) N4C–Ag3–N4 179.9(1) N2–Ag2–N3 176.2(1) 1b Ag1–N1 2.070(4) Ag3–N4 2.067(4) Ag1–N8A 2.075(4) Ag3–N5 2.086(4) Ag2–N3 2.089(4) Ag4–N6 2.082(4) Ag2–N2 2.094(4) Ag4–N7 2.091(4) Ag1–Ag3B 3.0224(6) Ag2–Ag4C 3.0744(6) N1–Ag1–N8A 175.0(2) N4–Ag3–N5 173.0(2) N2–Ag2–N3 173.5(2) N6–Ag4–N7 176.8(2) 1c Ag1–N1 2.067(2) Ag2–N2 2.082(2) N1–Ag1–N1A 180 N2–Ag2–N2B 180 a Symmetry code: (A) x, 2y 2 1/2, 2z 2 1/2; (B) 2x + 1, 2y, 2z 2 1; (C) 2x + 1/2, 2y, z; (D) x, 2y 2 1/2, 2z 2 3/2 for 1a; (A) x 2 1, 2y + 1/2, z + 1/2; (B) x 2 1, y, z; (C) 2x, y 2 1/2, 2z + 5/2 for 1b; (A) 2x + 1, 2y, 2z + 2; (B) 2x + 1, 2y + 1, 2z + 1 for 1c. 352 | CrystEngComm, 2006, 8, 351–355 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006 Published on 05 April 2006.

View Article Online p-xylene/ethylbenzene were used in place of benzene, which further implies the templating effect of the guest molecules. It should be noted that all the three pseudo-polymorphs were obtained as single crystalline products without contamination of any other pseudo-polymorphs, as verified by the XRPD patterns (see ESI).{ Among 1a–c, 1c should be the most kinetically favoured product and easier to obtain. However, because of the slow reaction processes (not less than one week), which may be attributed to the presence of ammonia and the diffusion process, as well as the trivial differences of stabilization energy for these three pseudo-polymorphs, the presence/absence of the templating molecules plays an essential role in the formations of the three pseudo-polymorphs. Crystal structures The three pseudo-polymorphs of silver(I) 2-methylimidazolate 1a–c crystallize in the space groups of Pnna, P21/c and P21/n, respectively. All of them exhibit similar local coordination environments with the Ag(I) atoms adopting usual linear coordination geometry (Ag–N 2.071(2)–2.082(2) A˚ , N–Ag–N 172.4(1)–179.9(1)u for 1a; Ag–N 2.067(4)–2.094(4) A˚ , N–Ag–N 173.0(2)–176.8(2)u for 1b; Ag–N 2.067(2) and 2.082(2) A˚ , N–Ag–N 180u for 1c), as shown in Table 2. In 1a, there are three crystallographically independent Ag(I) atoms and two mim ligands, in which two Ag(I) atoms are located at the special positions with 50% position occupancies. The chains are extended into crystallographic 21 helices along the b-axis, featuring Ag8(mim)8 subunits with a helical pitch of 10.4307(4) A˚ (the same as the b-axis length), where each pair of the mim ligands bonded to a metal ion are orientated in a syn fashion with the dihedral angles in the range of 13.9–34.7u. Such twisted orientation of the adjacent mim ligands leads to the formation of the helix with all of the methyl groups in mim ligands pointing towards the channel of the helix (Fig. 1a). It is noteworthy that the helix can be rationalized into an 81 one (Fig. 1b), which does not exist as a crystallographic symmetry, but can exist as a molecular symmetry. Therefore, this helix could be referred to as a pseudo-81 one, which has not been documented for coordination polymers in contrast to the common 21 and 41 helices.4a,10,11 It is also noteworthy that the inward orientation of mim ligands in 1a is similar to that of the octagonal pseudo-polymorph of copper(I) 2-methylimida- zolate,3a hence the formation of the infinite helical structure in 1a arises from the orientation of adjacent mim ligands twisted only in one direction. The formations of both 1a and the octagonal pseudo-polymorph of copper(I) 2-methylimidazo- late indicate that the curved imidazolate ligands and linearly two-coordinate M(I) ions can be interconnected into many different superstructures if one can appropriately control the crystallization conditions.

View Article Online In the crystal lattice, the helices with the same helicity in 1a are associated through interchain short Ag…Ag contacts (Ag2…Ag2 2.9848(4) A˚ , N–Ag…Ag–N ca. 87u) to give homochiral sheets as 2-D (6,3) nets (Fig. 2a). These sheets with opposite helicity are alternately packed with longer Ag…Ag contacts (Ag1…Ag3 3.2451(2) A˚ , N–Ag…Ag–N ca. 84u) to furnish the final racemic 3-D structure (Fig. 2b). The small channels (see ESI){ between the two sheets with opposite helicity in this 3-D network accommodate the guest molecules of benzene, which occupy ca. 22% of the whole volume (two benzene molecules per helical subunit). Being different from 1a, 1b contains four crystallographi- cally independent Ag(I) atoms and four mim ligands in a syn fashion with the dihedral angles of ca. 3.5–8.2u, giving rise into an arc-shaped Ag4(mim)4 fragment. Such fragments are interconnected to each other into an S-shaped chain with the pairs of mim ligands at the connecting points orientated in an anti fashion (Fig. 3). There are two types of interchain Ag…Ag contacts in 1b, where one (Ag1…Ag3 3.0224(6) A˚ , N–Ag…Ag–N ca. 86u) links the chains to give (6,3) sheets and the other (Ag2…Ag4 3.0744(6) A˚ , N–Ag…Ag–N ca. 82u) associate the sheets to extend into a complex 3-D network (Fig. 3). The channels between the two sheets within this 3-D network accommodate the guest molecules of p-xylene/ethylbenzene which occupy ca. 26% of the whole volume (two p-xylene/ethylbenzene molecules per Ag8(mim)8 subunit). The crystal structure of 1c exhibits simple zigzag chains, which contain two crystallographically independent Ag(I) atoms and one mim ligand, where two Ag(I) atoms are located at inversion centers, giving rise to the absolute 180u of N–Ag–N angles and the anti arrangement of neighbouring mim rings (Fig. 4). There are no obvious intermolecular interactions between the chains where the shortest interchain Ag…Ag contacts are up to 3.945(1) A˚ , much longer than the van der Waals radius sum of silver atoms (3.40 A˚ ).12 All the chains, running along in two directions, intersect with each other to give the crystal packing pattern of 1c which is dominated by weak van der Waals interactions without any other strong supramolecular interaction (see ESI).{ Discussion As noted above, though similar synthetic strategies of solvent templating were employed for the crystallizations of copper(I) and silver(I) 2-methylimidazolates, pseudo-polymorphs with different structural features were formed for these two analo- gues. In particular, for guest-containing metal(I) 2-methyl- imidazolates, both the copper(I) octagons and pseudo-81 silver(I) helices even accommodate the same templating benzene molecules in their structures, while the copper(I) decagons and S-shaped silver(I) chains contain the same templating p-xylene molecules in their structures! This fact can not only be attributed to the flexibility in the relative orientation of adjacent mim ligands, but also to the different sizes of M(1) ions. In fact, an Ag(I) atom can take part in significantly longer bond lengths of MI–N than a Cu(I) one (av. 1.9 A˚ for Cu(I), and 2.1 A˚ for Ag(I)), thus the possible polygons constructed by silver(I) and 2-methylimidazolate should have a greater inner diameter of the cavities, which is estimated to be greater by ca. 0.7 A˚ than the corresponding copper(I) polygons. This difference implies that different templating molecules are required for the formation of the polygons of silver(I) analogues. Unfortunately, although many trials have been performed, molecular polygons of silver(I) 2-methylimidazolates have not yet been successfully isolated so far. This failure once again indicates that many factors have trivial but significant influence on the formation of single crystals, such as the supramoelcular interactions between the solvent molecules and the host (during crystallization and in the final crystalline state), the conformational flexibility of the structural units, and even the metallophilicity in the cases of copper(I), silver(I) and gold(I) complexes. Conclusions Through the organic solvent templating strategy, three pseudo-polymorphs for silver(I) 2-methylimidazolate have been synthesized via liquid diffusions, which exhibit unusual pseudo-81 helical, S-shaped and zigzag chains, respectively. This work further demonstrates that even the simplest building blocks can be used to construct remarkable and unpredictable structural diversity afforded by supramolecular isomerism.
