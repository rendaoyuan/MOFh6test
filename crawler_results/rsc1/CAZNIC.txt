Commun., 2012, 48, 10419–10421 Chiral transformations of achiral porous metal–organic frameworks via a stepwise approachw Fei-Yan Yi,a Jian Zhang,b Hai-Xia Zhangb and Zhong-Ming Sun*ab Received 26th July 2012, Accepted 16th August 2012 DOI: 10.1039/c2cc35399g A family of chiral porous metal–organic frameworks were synthesized through an unprecedented chiral transformation process only involving achiral components. This method may provide a new point of view to rationally design targeted chiral MOFs and may shed light on the symmetry breaking mechanism. Chirality is an essential feature of life and spans many research ﬁelds over pharmaceutics, chemical industry, and biology, etc.1 During the past decade, chiral porous metal–organic frameworks (CPMOFs) have attracted great interest due to their potential applications in asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis, highly selective separation, gas storage and nonlinear optics.2 The most eﬀective strategy to prepare chiral MOFs is directly using enantiopure ligands as starting materials.3 Recently, chiral inﬂuences, such as chiral templates, ionic liquids with chiral anions or catalytic amounts of chiral spectators, were utilized to induce and achieve the controllable symmetry breaking crystallization of chiral MOFs.4,5 Such strategies undoubtedly oﬀer the great advantage to isolate a single enantiomer because one-pot spontaneous crystallization without involving any chiral components usually results in a mixture of racemic twins.6 Spontaneous symmetry breaking, however, still remains as a seldom achieved approach and rarely occurs in most reactions. Previous reports on symmetry breaking have the following two features: (1) they are random, as a batch of reactions between a ligand and a number of M2+ ions usually generate one rare example of chiral compounds; (2) as they are one-pot, it is hard to ﬁgure out the symmetry breaking mechanism from intermediate species. Very recently, stepwise assembly as a powerful technique has been used to fabricate new MOFs with high-connectivity metal complexes and extra-large channels.7 This synthetic method may be a good choice to rationally design chiral porous MOFs only using achiral components. To the best of our knowledge, such a process has never been made to succeed. To realize a stepwise synthetic scheme for the construction of targeted CPMOFs, three possible requirements are proposed: (1) the selected ligands should have a synergistic eﬀect on the formation of chiral MOFs and diﬀerent functions in the coordination directionality; (2) precursors with potential conformational chirality are preferable; and (3) the reaction intermediate should be in a meta-stable state or have speciﬁc coordination sites with weak interactions that could be further replaced by a secondary ligand. Bearing the aforementioned ideas in mind, we have selected a semi-rigid ligand hexa[4-(carboxyphenyl)oxamethyl]-3-oxapentane acid (H6L, Scheme 1) as the building block to construct new structures. H6L features ﬂexible backbones and multi-coordination sites and thus can be considered as an ideal ligand to assemble porous three-dimensional (3D) networks. The ligand (H6L) is also a potential source of conformational chirality and is basal for chiral generation and symmetry breaking. Reactions of H6L and M2+ (M = Cd, Co) in a mixed solvent system, dimethylacetamide (DMA)/H2O, at 85 1C resulted in two new porous compounds 1 (P-1) and 2 (C2/c).

Commun., 2012, 48, 10419–10421 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 two compounds are shown in Fig. 1a–c. It is worth noticing that 1 contains two distinct SBUs, one with two DMA ligands and one with four aqua ligands, 2 contains one type of SBU with two terminal DMA ligands. The terminal M2+ ions are coordinated by solvent molecules or aqua ligands. In principle, these weak coordinated sites could be substituted by pyridine ligands or their corresponding derivatives. Additional reactions of compounds 1 and 2 with a rigid ligand 4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)- 1,3,5-triazine (tpt, C3 symmetry) at 100 1C gave two new chiral compounds 3 and 4, respectively. When the solvent was changed to DMF/H2O, compound 5 (C2) was isolated between the reactions of 2 and tpt (Scheme 1). The phase purities of bulk samples 1–5 were conﬁrmed by powder XRD (see ESIw). It is noteworthy here that direct one-pot reactions of H6L, tpt and M2+ salts usually lead to a mixture of achiral intermediates (1 or 2) and chiral products. Attempts were made to synthesize the corresponding compounds with other M2+ ions (including Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+), but these failed. Compounds 3–5 are the only compounds obtained from the above reaction system. The SBUs among all ﬁve compounds are trinuclear clusters, and compounds 1 and 2 are composed of linear ones, whereas 3, 4 and 5 feature triangle shapes (Fig. 1, S1, S3, ESIw). The SBUs in 1 and 2 are further linked by the carboxylic ligands, resulting in a [4, 4] layered net and a binodal pts 3D porous net with a point symbol of {42.84} and vertex symbol of [4.4.87.87.87.87] [4.4.82.82.88.88] (Fig. S2, S3, ESIw). Compound 3 [Cd3(L)(tpt)(H2O)] crystallizes in chiral space group P1. The asymmetric unit contains three crystallo- graphically independent Cd2+ ions, all of which are octahedrally coordinated (Fig. 1d, S4, ESIw). Polyhedra containing Cd(1) and Cd(2) are edge-sharing and further link Cd(3) via vertex-sharing oxygen atoms to form one-dimensional (1D) chains along the a-axis (Fig. S5, ESIw). These 1D Cd chains are further linked by the carboxylic ligands to form a 3D porous framework (Fig. S5, ESIw). The tpt ligand serves as a two-coordinated node bridging two Cd atoms. The whole structure can be simpliﬁed as a sqc33 net after omitting the 2-coordinated node (Fig. S5b, ESIw). There are two types of 1D channels (15.6  9.2 A˚ 2 and 16.6  11.6 A˚ 2) along the c-axis. The solvent- accessible volume is approximately 806.9 A˚ 3 per unit cell volume, and the pore volume ratio is calculated to be 36.1% using a PLATON program.7 The measurement of second harmonic generation (SHG) shows that complex 3 exhibits a SHG eﬃciency B2.0 times that of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP). Compounds 4 [Co3(OH)(L)(tpt)(H2O)H2NMe2] and 5 [Co3(OH)(L)(tpt)H2NMe2] crystallize in chiral space groups P21 and C2, respectively. Their structures are only slightly diﬀerent, and once the aqua ligand (O1W) in 4 is replaced by a carboxylic oxygen atom, the higher symmetry compound 5 is generated (Fig. 1e and f, S6, ESIw). The asymmetric unit in compound 4 contains Co atoms, carboxylic ligands, tpt mole- cules, hydroxyl anions as well as aqua ligands (Fig. S6, ESIw). Every Co2+ is octahedrally coordinated and shares an OH anion with the other two cobalt atoms, resulting in a trinuclear cluster, which is further linked by tpt and carboxylate groups to aﬀord a highly porous anionic 3D framework with large channels (16.4  15.1 A˚ 2) along the c-axis (Fig. 2b, S7, ESIw). To keep the charge balance and structure stabilities of 4 and 5, protonated dimethylamines ﬁll the channels. Diﬀerent from that in compound 3, the tpt ligand is tridentate and links three Co3 clusters forming a 2D honeycomb layer (Fig. S7c, ESIw). The solvent-accessible volume is approximately 4835.8 A˚ 3 per unit cell volume, and the pore volume void ratio is 67.5% calculated by the PLATON program.8 The framework can be simpliﬁed as a 3-connected MnD.65 net (Fig. S8, ESIw). Some crystals were randomly picked from the batch of compounds 3–5 and their structural determinations and Flack absolute structure parameters are listed in Tables S2–S4 (ESIw). Solid-state circular dichroism (CD) spectra for several batches of these compounds have also been displayed (Fig. S10, ESIw). Both the crystal reﬁnements and the Cotton eﬀect strongly indicate that the bulk samples of all three compounds are in enantiomeric excess. Induction of the rigid tpt ligand clearly is a key factor to such unusual symmetry breaking. Further structure analyses indicates that the cooperative eﬀect of the dual-ligands contributes a lot to such unusual symmetry breaking. In compounds 1 and 2, a pair of H6L ligands coordinate to metal centers in an end-to-end fashion and an inversion center is formed (Fig. S11, ESIw). Metal centers are linked into two types of trimeric Cd3 SBUs (Fig. 1a and b) in 1, and trimeric Co3 SBUs in 2 (Fig. 1c), all of which Fig. 1 Secondary Building Units in achiral MOFs 1–2 (a–c) and chiral MOFs 3–5 (d–f) are shown.

View Article Online This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Chem. Commun., 2012, 48, 10419–10421 10421 are linear with inversion centers. These achiral SBUs contain coordinated small molecules, such as aqua ligands or solvent molecules. As is well known, nitrogen has stronger coordination ability than oxygen to Cd2+ and Co2+. Once the rigid tpt ligand was introduced into the reaction material, all coordinated solvent molecules and most aqua ligands were replaced by the nitrogen ligands as well as some coordination sites of the carboxylate groups were rearranged, resulting into more stable chiral compounds. As shown in Fig. 3, the H6L ligand is locked in a twisted chiral conformation, and the coordination modes of the carboxylic ligands to the metal centers exhibit mirror-related conformations. The resultant trinuclear metal building unit is non-symmetrical (Fig. 1d–e) or with two-fold rotational axis (Fig. 1f). Neither bidentate nor tridentate tpt ligands participate in the formation of 3D frameworks, but they direct the metal coordination and strengthen the whole 3D porous frameworks. These results conﬁrm that the tpt ligands exhibit a remarkable chirality induction eﬀect and control the absolute chirality of the 3D porous framework by direct binding to the frameworks, which is an essential driving force for chiral generation. Thermogravimetric analysis indicates that the framework of 3 is stable up to 300 1C, whereas 4 and 5 smoothly decompose starting from 100 1C (Fig. S12, ESIw). To conﬁrm and evaluate the porosity of highly stable 3, N2 and H2 isotherms on the guest-free samples were measured. Compound 3 exhibits type I sorption isotherms and takes up 158 cm3 g1 of N2 at 77 K and 1 atm. The calculated Langmuir and BET surface areas are 692 and 475 m2 g1, respectively. The H2 isotherm shows that it adsorbs 1.13 wt% at 77 K in 1 atm (Fig. S13, ESIw). In conclusion, we demonstrate here an unusual structural transformation from achiral MOFs to chiral MOFs induced by an achiral precursor via a two-step process. Structure analyses and experimental procedure conﬁrm the induction eﬀect of the rigid tpt ligand in this transformation. This work may provide a new strategy to rationally design targeted chiral MOFs and may shed new light on the symmetry breaking mechanism.

H6L was synthesized by a modified procedure previously documented.1-4 Ligand 4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tpt) was purchased from Jinan Henghua Sci. & Tec. Co., Ltd. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were carried out in DMSO-d6 solvent on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer at 298K. The chemical shift is given in dimensionless δ values and is referenced relative to TMS in 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was made using a SDT 2960 Simultaneous DSC-TGA of TA instruments up to 800 ºC, and the heating rate was 10 oC min-1 under an air flow. Powder X-ray power diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on a D8 Focus (Bruker) diffractometer with Cu K radiation Field-emission (λ = 0.15405 nm, continuous, 40 kV, 40 mA, increment = 0.02°). The measurement of the powder frequency–doubling effect was carried out on the sieved (80–100 mesh) powder sample of compound 3 by means of the modified method of Kurtz and Perry. The fundamental wavelength is 1064 nm generated by a Q–switched Nd: YAG laser. Sieved KDP powder (80–100 mesh) was used as a reference. 5 The fluorescence spectra were performed on a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 fluorescence spectrophotometer, equipped with a 450 W Xe-lamp as the excitation source and a monochromator iHR320 equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled R5509-72 PMT as detector. The solid-state CD spectra was carried out using a mixture of about 0.7-1.3 mg sample and 35-65 mg dried KCl powder, which was well grounded and then pressed into a disk for use in the CD measurement with a MOS-450 spectropolarimeter. The measurements (N2 and H2) were performed on ASAP 2020 and Autosorb MP-1 apparatuses. Prior to the measurement, the as-synthesized sample of 3 was immersed in ethanol and dichloromethane alternately. The resulting exchanged sample was then evacuated (10-3 Torr) successively at room temperature and 80 oC. Synthesis of the [Cd3(L)(H2O)2(DMA)•2DMA] (1): Cd(NO3)2•4H2O (0.12 mmol, 37.1 mg) and H6L (0.04 mmol, 39.0 mg) in mixed dimethylacetamide (DMA, 6 mL)/ distilled water (H2O, 1 mL) solvent were placed in a 20 ml vial. The sample was heated at 85 oC for 3 days, and then cooled to room-temperature. After washed by distilled water, the colorless crystals were obtained, yield 52.7 mg (82%). Synthesis of the [Co3(L)(DMA)2•3DMA] (2): Co(NO3)2•6H2O (0.12 mmol, 34.5 mg) and H6L (0.04 mmol, 39.0 mg) in mixed dimethylacetamide (DMA, 6 mL)/ distilled water (H2O, 1 mL) solvent were placed in a 20 ml vial. The sample was heated at 85 oC for 3 days, and then cooled to room-temperature. After washed by distilled water, red crystals were obtained, yield 55.0 mg (76%). Synthesis of the [Cd3(L)(tpt)(H2O)] (3) and [Co3(OH)(L)(tpt)(H2O)•H2N(CH3)2] (4): tpt (0.04 mmol, 12.5 mg) was added into the resultant solution of compounds 1 and 2, respectively, then the mixture were heated at 100 oC for 3 days, brown crystals of 3 and red crystal of 4 were obtained.

The sample was heated at 100 oC for 3 days, and then cooled to room-temperature. After washed by distilled water, red crystals were obtained, yield 32.8 mg (50%). X-ray Crystallography: Crystallographic data were collected at 293 K on a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data processing was accomplished with the SAINT program. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined on F2 by full-matrix least squares using SHELXTL-97. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters during the final cycles. All hydrogen atoms of the organic molecule were placed by geometrical considerations and were added to the structure factor calculation.

The CdOx (x = 5, 6) polyhendra and C4 tetrahedra are shaded in green and purple, respectively. The asymmetric unit of compound 1 contains four crystallline independant Cd2+ ions, one L6- anion, two aqua ligands, one coordinated-DMA and two DMA molecules. Cd(1) and Cd(3) locate at an inversion center. Cd(1) and Cd(3) are six-coordinated, in which four oxygen atoms in the equatorial plane are from two couples of chelating carboxyl groups of two L6- ligands, two oxygen atoms in the axial sites are from the other two L6- ligands. Cd(2) atom is coordinated by five oxygen atoms from three L6- ligands and one coordinated-DMA. Cd(4) is five-coordinated in a tetragonal pyramid geometry by three oxygen atoms from three L6- ligands and two aqua ligands. Four Cd2+ ions formed two types of Cd3 trinuclear SBUs with Cd(1) and Cd(3) for the center, repectively. Each Cd3 SBU is linked by four L6- ligands and each L6- ligand bridges four Cd3 SBUs, forming a 4,4-net layer.

The crystallographically asymmetric unit of compound 2 contains one and a half Co2+ ions, a half of L6- anion, one coordinated-DMA as well as three lattice DMA molecules. Six coordinated oxygen atoms of octahedral Co(1) atom are from four L6- anions. Co(2) atom is in a tetrahedral geometry by four oxygen atoms from three L6- ligands and one coordinated-DMA. Co(1) connects with two neighboring Co(2) atoms through carboxylate groups forming a trinuclear Co3 cluster, which is further linked by the ligands into a binodal 4-coonnected pts net with a point symbol of {42.84} and vertex symbol of [4.4.87.87.87.87] [4.4.82.82.88.88].

Cd, N, O, and C atoms are drawn as bright green, blue, red, and gray balls, respectively.

(a) Trimeric Cd3 SBUs are simplied into six-connected node and the H6L ligand is acted as four-connected node. (b) View the 3D porous framework (left) along a-axis, a containing 2-connected node net (middle), a sqc33 net (right). In the asymmetric unit of compound 3, there are three crystallographic-independent Cd2+ ions, one L6- anion, one tpt ligand and an aqua ligand. All of three Cd2+ ions are six-coordinated with different coordinated modes. In the octahedron of Cd(1), the four oxygen atoms in equatorial plane are from three L6- ligands, the axial sites are occupied by one nitrogen atom from one tpt ligand and an aqua ligand. The six coordinated oxygen atoms of Cd(2) are from four L6- ligands and an aqua ligand. Cd(3) are coordinated by one nitrogen atom from one tpt ligand and five oxygen atoms from three L6- ligands. Polyhedra containing Cd(1) and Cd(2) are edge-sharing and further link Cd(3) via vertex-sharing oxygen atoms to form one-dimensional (1D) chains along the a-axis. Each L6- site is 4-coonected despite it has six carboxyl groups, because two couples of carboxyl groups chelate to two Cd3 trimeric units, so each L6- site is bonded to four Cd3 trimeric units. These 1D Cd chains are further self-assembled into 3D frameworks by the L6- ligand. It is interesting that the tpt ligand bridged two Cd atoms, so it is acted as two-connected node. If the Cd3 trimeric units, L6- ligands and tpt ligands are considered as nodes, the framework of compound 3 can be simplified as a 2,4,8 net with a point symbol of {512.611.74.8}{52.64}{5}. Omitting the 2-connected nodes, the framework was simplified as a 2-connected sqc33 net with a point symbol of {412.616}{42.64} and vertex symbol of (4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.42.42.42.42.62.62.62.62.62.62.64.64.64.64.64.64.64.64.68.68)(42.42.617.617.617.617).

Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 8 Figure S8. (a) In compounds 4 and 5, trimeric Co3 cluster is acted as nine-connected node and H6L ligand is acted as six-connected node. (b) View the 3D porous framework along a-axis and a MnD.65 net. In compounds 4 and 5, each Co atom is octahedrally coordinated and shares an OH- anion with the other two cobalt atoms, resulting a trinuclear cluster. These Co3 trimer building unit are connected into 3D porous framework by L6- ligands, and a 2D honeycomb layered structure by tridentate tpt ligands (Figure S7). These 2D tpt-Co3 layers are inserted into 3D L6-Co3 structure along c-axis and strengthened 3D porous framework with 1D channels (13.50 × 12.289 Å) parallel to c-axis (Figure S7). In this 3D porous framework of compounds 4 and 5, each trimeric Co unit is connected to six L6- ligands and three tpt ligands, so it is nine-coonnected node, and each L6- ligand linked to six trinuclear Co units, it is acted as six-coonnected nodes. If the Co3 trimeric units, L6- ligands and tpt ligands are considered as nodes, the framework can be simplified as a 3-connected 3,6,9 MnD.65 net with a point symbol of {421.615}{43}{49.66} (Figure S8) and vertex symbol of [4(2).4(2).4(2).4(2).4(2).4(2).4(2).4(2).4(2).6(6).6(6).6(6).6(6).6(6).6(6)] [4(2).4(2).4(2)] [4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4(2).4(2).4(2).6.6.6.6(4).6(4).6(4).6(4).6(4).6(4).*.*.*.*.*.*] (By using TOPOS software, http://www.topos.ssu.samara.ru).

Solid-state emission spectra of ligands H6L and tpt, compounds 1 and 3 at room temperature. The solid state photoluminescent properties of compounds 1 and 3 have been investigated at room temperature. As shown in Figure S14, the free H6L displays two weak emission peaks at λmax = 382 nm, 401 nm and one very weak shoulder at 423 nm upon excitation at 348 nm. After its complexion with metal ions, the resulted compound 1 exhibits very similar fluorescence emission bands at λmax = 408, 434, 461 nm (λex = 376 nm). Free tpt ligands displays a broad emission peak at λmax = 459 nm (λex = 379 nm). Upon the complexion of both tpt and H6L ligands with Cd2+ ions, compound 3 displays a broad emission break centered at 485 nm (λex = 415 nm), whose pattern is nearly identical to the tpt ligand instead of the free carboxylic acid. These emissions can be attributed to the intraligand transitions.6 Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 15 References: (1) E.
