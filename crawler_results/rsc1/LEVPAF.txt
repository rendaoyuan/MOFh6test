Molecule recognition which is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates is attracting increasing attention in recent years.1 Crystalline metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been shown by recent research to have great potential for a wide range of applications, such as gas storage,2 separation,3 luminescent probes for small molecules4 and detection of high explosives in the vapor phase.5 Specific and unique molecular recognition between host porous MOFs and guest molecules is the design criteria to construct porous MOFs with functional pores to direct their functional properties and applications. Therefore, the rational design and facile synthesis of functional MOFs is still a challenge for chemists. Toward this aim, the synthetic strategies used are to control the pore size and pore geometry,6 to retain open metal sites,7,9 and to immobilize functional groups such as –NH2 on the pore surfaces, etc.8 Among a number of synthesized MOF materials, a series of isostructural M-MOF-74 (M/DOBDC)9 (M = Zn, Co, Ni, Mn, Mg, Fe; DOBDC = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) materials has aroused wide interest based on their tunable structures and applications, particularly in gas storage. According to the literature, the common feature of M-MOF-74 is DOBDC to bind infinite-rod shaped secondary building units (SBUs) with potential open metal sites. To the best of our knowledge, no examples of MOF-74 analogs with other non-DOBDC ligands and functional groups on their channel surfaces were reported. Herein, we report two novel MOF-74 analogs (labeled OH-MOF-74) with –OH groups on their pore surfaces that are constructed by functional phenyl-acrylic acid and 4,40-bipyridyl through multi-component self-assemble at room temperature, {[Zn(OCA-OH)2(4,40-bipy)0.5]1.67H2O}n (1, OCA-OH = (E)-3-(2- hydroxyl-phenyl)-acrylic acid); 4,40-bipy = 4,40-bipyridine) and {[Zn(MCA-OH)2(4,40-bipy)0.5]0.5CH3OHH2O}n (2, MCA-OH = (E)-3-(3-hydroxyl-phenyl)-acrylic acid) for the first time. Their luminescent properties for detecting aromatic molecules and sensing small molecules are studied. The facile synthesis of these two OH-MOF-74s is successfully based on the reasonable design. The OCA–OH or MCA–OH is a flexible monocarboxylate ligand in the view of coordination and supramolecular chemistry,10 and 4,40-bipy is one of the most widely used bridging ligands used to construct 1D, 2D and 3D coordination polymers. The key factor is that the two ligands have compar- able molecular size (Scheme S1, ESI†). Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis reveals 1 and 2 are isomorphous and crystallize in a Rhombohedral space group of R-3. They adopt similar framework structures and the coordi- nation environments of Zn(II) in 1 and 2 are the same. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Zn atom, two OCA–OH ligands, half of 4,40-bipy lies about an inversion centre, one disordered water molecule [O9], and one water molecule [O8] has been assigned half-occupancy and another [O7] lies at a site with 3 [bar-three] symmetry and thus has 1/6 occupancy. Each Zn center is in an NO3 distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry (Fig. 1a) with one 4,40-bipy nitrogen atom, one monodentate carboxyl oxygen atom and two bridging carboxylate oxygen atoms from three diﬀerent OCA–OH ligands. Zinc atoms are linked by bridging carboxylate groups to form 1D left/right- hand helical rod-shaped SBUs (Fig. S2, ESI†) that are further bridged by 4,40-bipy to result in a 3D framework with 1D hexagonal channels of diameter 1.10 nm, in which water guests reside along the c axis (Fig. 1b–d). The framework topology is identical to that recently described for MOF-74 (etb, Fig. 1i). Further examinations reveal that the functional OH groups of all the monodentate coordinated OCA–OH ligands are immo- bilized on the 1D hexagonal pore surfaces, and a group of six Key Laboratory of Cluster Science of Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, P.

Water molecules are arranged as a dextral propeller shape around the H2O molecules which are centrally located in the 1D channel to give idealized C6-symmetries in the channel (Fig. S5b, ESI†). The eﬀective free volume in 1 calculated by the program PLATON is 25.7% of the total volume when the guest molecules are removed. By merely lowering the concentration of reactant and using MCA–OH in place of OCA–OH, microporous complex 2 was obtained with the two MCA–OH ligands each equally disordered over two orientations. Similar to 1, complex 2 also possesses MOF-74 structure except for the orientation of OH groups from coordinated MCA–OH immobilized on the 1D hexagonal channel surfaces with a diameter of 1.08 nm (Fig. 1f–h). The oxygen atoms of the six OH groups formed chair-shaped clusters again as that in 1. However, the solvent molecules in 2 include H2O and CH3OH, which are arranged as a levorotatory propeller shape around the c-axis to give idealized C6-symmetries in the channel (Fig. S5d, ESI†). PLATON calculation gives a free volume in 2 of 23.0%, slightly lower than that of 1 (25.7%). TG analyses indicated that 1 and 2 can be stable up to a temperature of 200 1C and 235 1C respectively. The solid-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of as- synthesized 1, 2 and free ligands (4,40-bipy, OCA–OH and MCA–OH) were investigated under lex = 246 nm. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited strong bands (425 nm, 444 nm and 470 nm for 1, 452 nm and 471 nm for 2 respectively) and an obvious red shift compared with the free ligands (Fig. S29, ESI†) which could be attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). Interestingly, the PL spectra recorded on powder samples of 1a and 2a (the guest-free form of 1 and 2) revealed unique fluorescence quenching behavior (Fig. S29, ESI†) upon desolvation and presented similar emissions at 471 nm as those in 1 and 2, possibly due to the disappearance of the interactions between the framework and guest solvent mole- cules. The quenching eﬃciencies of 67.3% and 41.7% for 1 and 2 were estimated using the formula (I0  I)/I0  100%, where I0 is the maximum fluorescence intensity of 1 and 2 respectively. In addition, studies on the solid-state PL spectra of the guest- free framework 2a revealed unique fluorescence quenching and enhancement behavior upon immerging in the solvent of aromatic compounds of group A (having electron-withdrawing groups) and group B (having electron-donating groups) respec- tively (Fig. 2d, Fig. S30, ESI†). Among them, nitrobenzene and iodobenzene are fluorescence quenchers for 2a. Nitrobenzene quenches the emission by as much as 41.6%, and a lower quenching eﬃciency (29.0%) is observed for iodobenzene. This is in accordance with the trend of electron-withdrawing groups. An opposite eﬀect was observed for group-B analytes. Toluene enhanced the emission intensity most significantly (64.6%), followed by benzene (56.0%). The results demonstrate the exceptional ability of 2a to selectively detect diﬀerent types of aromatic molecules. On the other hand, the PL spectra of 1a and 2a in diﬀerent solvent emulsions exhibited excellent fluorescence sensing for small molecules. As shown in Fig. 2a and c, the PL intensity was strongly dependent on the solvent molecule. When 1a was dispersed in H2O, a remarkable red- shift (B90 nm) is observed for the emission of 1a relative to all the other solvent molecules. When 1a was dispersed in CH3OH, the fluorescence intensity at B500 nm gradually increased with increasing amounts of H2O (Fig. S15, ESI†). Specifically, a small amount of acetone can be easily sensed because of its signifi- cant luminescence diminishment, which is dependent on its content. As shown in Fig. 2b, Fig. S19 and S21 (ESI†), addition of acetone to the DMSO or H2O emulsion of 1a all led to a significant decrease of its fluorescence intensity, which almost disappeared at an acetone content of 3.56 vol% and 6.67 vol% respectively.

Commun., 2013, 49, 1699--1701 1701 acetone all could be well fitted with a first-order exponential decay (Fig. 2b, Fig. S20 and S22, ESI†). In addition, when 2a was dispersed in H2O, the fluorescence intensity gradually increased with increasing amounts of CH3CN (Fig. 2c), where the system rapidly reached the equilibrium state. It is assumed that the diﬀerent binding interactions of the functional OH groups with guest solvent molecules play an important role in such enhancing and quenching eﬀects of small solvent mole- cules. And the diﬀerent but not inverse sensing ability by 1a and 2a may be attributed to the diﬀerent orientation of hydroxyl groups in the 1D pore surfaces of the two compounds. TGA of all the solvent absorbed forms of the two compounds (1*Sol- vents and 2*Solvents) were measured and provided in the ESI† to demonstrate that the luminescence change of MOF emul- sions is solely arisen from the MOF itself after adsorbing solvents (Fig. S50–S65, ESI†). From the result of the TGA curves, we found that 1a and 2a absorbed diﬀerent amounts of small solvent molecules; the various binding interactions of the functional OH groups with these guest solvent molecules may lead to luminescence change of MOF emulsions. The rational results reveal 1a and 2a to be promising luminescent probes for sensing small molecules. As far as we know, 2a is the first report on a microporous MOF as a promising luminescent probe for detecting both diﬀerent types of aromatic molecules and small molecules simultaneously, although limited MOFs for detecting one of them were reported.4,5 In summary, the study opens up a new way to synthesize functional MOFs; two novel MOF-74 analogs based on inge- nious design and illustrate unique sensing and detection properties were prepared. Our studies on their guest-free forms, 1a and 2a, revealed that 1a and 2a could be potential lumines- cent probes for detecting small molecules, and 2a also demon- strated unique fluorescence quenching and enhancement behavior upon immerging in a solvent of aromatic compounds of group A (having electron-withdrawing groups) and group B (having electron-donating groups), respectively. Furthermore, the functional OH groups on large 1D hexagonal channel surfaces could be post-synthetically covalently modified or replaced by other groups for further applications. Eﬀorts to realize these aims are underway. Notes and references 1 (a) M. O’Keeﬀe and O. M. Yaghi, Chem. Rev., 2012, 112, 675; (b) A. Phan, C. J. Doonan, F. J. Uribe-Romo, C. B. Knobler, M.

Organic solvents with analytical purity were supplied by commercial sources and used as received. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed on a Flash EA1112 microanalyzer at the Beijing Institute of Technology. FT-IR spectrum is recorded in the Nicolet-360 FT-IR spectrometer as KBr pellets in the 4000–400 cm-1 region. The UV-vis absorption spectra were examined on a JASCO UV-1901 spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200~800 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded by using a Hitachi F-7000 luminescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp as the excitation source, and the measurements were performed at room temperature. The photomultiplier tube voltage was 700 V, the scan speed was 12000 nm∙min–1, and the slit width was 2.5 nm. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) were carried out on a SEIKO TG/DTA 6200 thermal analyzer from room temperature to 1000 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min in a flowing 150 mL/min nitrogen atmosphere. X-ray powder diffraction (XPRD) of samples were measured using a Japan Rigaku D/max γ A X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154060 nm). Nitrogen adsorption experiments and micropore analysis were conducted at 77K using a TriStarII3020 (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation) apparatus. Before adsorption measurements, the samples were degassed in vacuum at 333K for 2h and 403K for 6h. The specific surface areas (SSAs) of the freeze-dried samples were calculated by Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) analyses of their adsorption isotherms. Section 2.

In a Pyrex reaction tube, dried complex 1 (30mg) was prepared by evacuation at 60 ºC for 2 h, and then 130 ºC for 5 h; subsequently, it was immersed in CH3CN (1 ml) at room temperature. After excess CH3CN was completely removed by evacuation at room temperature for 5 h, the reaction tube was filled with nitrogen. 1⊃CH3OH, 1⊃CH3CH2OH, 1⊃acetone, 1⊃CH2Cl2, 1⊃H2O, 1⊃THF, 1⊃cyclohexane, 2⊃CH3CN, 2⊃CH3OH, 2⊃CH3CH2OH, 2⊃acetone, 2⊃CH2Cl2, 2⊃H2O, 2⊃THF, 2⊃cyclohexane, 2⊃C6H6, 2⊃C6H6CH3, 2⊃C6H6I and 2⊃C6H6NO2 were prepared same way by using corresponding guest solvent molecules, respectively. Section 3. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Suitable single crystals with dimensions of 0.25 × 0.07 × 0.07 mm and 0.50 × 0.14 × 0.14 mm for compounds 1 and 2 were selected for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis respectively. Data collection were performed on a Rigaku RAXIS-RAPID CZN diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromatic Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.71073 Å) using an ω scan mode for compounds 1 and 2 at 153(2) K. Unit-cell parameters were determined from automatic centering of 25 reflections and refined by a least-squares method. All non-hydrogen atoms were located by direct methods and subsequent difference Fourier syntheses. The hydrogen atoms bound to carbon were located by geometrical calculations, and their positions and thermal parameters were fixed during structure refinement. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques with I > 2σ(I). All refinements were performed using SHELXTL 97. The isolated solvent atom O9 and O7 are disordered to three positions (O9/O9’/O9’’ and O7/O7’/O7’’) in compounds 1 and 2 respectively. In compound 1, the restraint command ‘‘ISOR’’ was applied to the disordered O9 atom for obtaining reasonable thermal parameters. In compound 2, the restraint command ‘‘ISOR’’ was applied to the disordered C2, C6, C6’, C7, C7’, O7’’, O8, C24 and C24’ atoms, and the restraint command “EADP” is applied to the disordered O4, O4’, C7, C7’, C24 and C24’ atoms for obtaining reasonable thermal parameters. The bond distance restraint command “DFIX” is applied to the bonds C24−O8, C24’−O8, C7−C8 and C7’−O8 for obtaining reasonable bond distances. In compound 2, the two MCA-OH ligands are each equally disordered over two orientations, the refined occupancies have values 0.502(7) and 0.498(7) which do not differ from an exact 0.5 value. It is acceptable to only refine half-occupancy O and C atoms isotropically. CCDC-890826 (1) and CCDC-890827 (2) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

The fluorescence properties of compounds 1, 2, 1a and 2a in the solid state, and those of Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 S5 desolvated 1 and 2 in various solvent emulsions (designated as 1a-solvent and 2a-solvent respectively) were investigated at room temperature. Desolvated 1 and 2 were prepared as follows: after immersed in CH3OH for 3 days, the sample was evacuated at 60 ℃ for 1 h and then 120. ℃ for over 3h. The 1a-solvent and 2a-solvent emulsions were prepared by introducing 1.0 mg of 1a-solvent and 2a-solvent fine powder into 50 mL of MeOH, EtOH, CH3CN, CH2Cl2, DMF, DMSO, THF, distilled water, acetone, or cyclohexane respectively. After sonication treatment, aging for over 24 h and shaking, the fluorescence spectra were measured. For sensing properties with respect to solvents, desired amounts of desolvated-1 emulsion in distilled water (0.4 mg of fine powder of desolvated-1 in 10 mL of in distilled water) were added into a certain requirement amount of desolvated-1 emulsion in acetone (0.4 mg of fine powder of desolvated-1 in 10 mL of acetone), and desired amounts of desolvated-2 emulsion in distilled water (0.4 mg of fine powder of desolvated-2 in 10 mL of in distilled water) were added into a standard desolvated-2 emulsion in acetonitrile (0.4 mg of fine powder of desolvated-2 in 10 mL of acetonitrile). The photoluminescence spectra were investigated after sonication treatment, one-day aging and shaking vigorously before testing. For further detecting the sensing properties with respect to solvents, desired amounts of desolvated-1 emulsion in DMSO (0.4 mg of fine powder of desolvated-1 in 10 mL of in DMSO) were added into a certain requirement amount of desolvated-1 emulsion in acetone (0.4 mg of fine powder of desolvated-1 in 10 mL of acetone), and desired amounts of desolvated-1 emulsion in distilled water (0.4 mg of fine powder of desolvated-1 in 10 mL of in distilled water) were added into a standard desolvated-1 emulsion in methanol (0.4 mg of fine powder of desolvated-2 in 10 mL of methanol). The photoluminescence spectra were investigated after sonication treatment, one-day aging and shaking vigorously before testing. To detect luminescence diminishment properties of acetone to 1a, a small amount of acetone were added into a certain requirement amount of desolvated-1 emulsion in DMSO and H2O (0.4 mg of fine powder of desolvated-1 in 10 mL of in DMSO and H2O respectively). The photoluminescence spectra were investigated after shaking vigorously. To detect the solid-state PL properties of guest-free framework 2a upon immerging to the two diﬀerent categories of aromatic compounds, namely, compounds containing electron-withdrawing groups such as nitroaromatics (group A) and those having electron-donating groups such as CH3 (group B), the fine powder of 2⊃C6H6, 2⊃C6H6CH3, 2⊃C6H6I and 2⊃C6H6NO2 with the same amount and similar particle size (the good agreement of the XRPD patterns in intensity and position demonstrates that these powder have similar particle size) were investigated at room temperature. Luminescence control experiments were done in different small solvent molecules by using the ligands (OCA-OH+4,4'-bipy and MCA-OH+4,4'-bipy), ligands+metals (OCA-OH+4,4'-bipy+ Zn(ClO4)2 ּ◌6H2O and MCA-OH+4,4'-bipy+Zn(ClO4)2 ּ◌6H2O) to compare with the emission properties of MOF- desolvated (Zn-OCA-MOF- desolvated (1a) and Zn-MCA-MOF- desolvated Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 S6 (2a)) at the same concentration, to see the solvent effect on these different systems.
