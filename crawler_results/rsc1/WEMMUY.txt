The structures of the seven compounds have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses and further characterized by infrared spectra (IR), elemental analyses, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Compound 1 displays a 3D (4,8)-connected net with the rare (32?42?52)(36?48?510?64) topology. Compound 2 shows a typical 3D (4,6)- connected (44?62)(44?610?8) net. Compound 3 furnishes an unusual 3D (3,5,6)-connected net with (42)2(63)(42?68)3(42?86?103)2 topology. Compounds 4–6 exhibit similar 2D layer structures with (4,4)- connected (4?64?8)(42?64) topology. Compound 7 possesses a 3D 2-fold interpenetrating (3,4,6)-connected net with (4?62)(8?65)(42?68?83?102) topology. The effects of the Htrb ligand and anions on the structures of the coordination polymers have been discussed. In addition, photoluminescent properties of the compounds have also been investigated in detail. Introduction In recent times, the field of coordination polymers has been one of the most rapid growing areas of chemistry because of their potential applications in ion exchange, catalysis, sorp- tion, magnetism, luminescence, and onlinear optics as well as their versatile structures of topological aesthetics.1–3 Generally, the structure of the resultant coordination architecture greatly depends on some factors such as the neutral ligands, the organic anions, the metal atoms and so on.2–4 In this regard, the choice of the neutral ligand is the key factor that influences the construction of coordination polymers with distinctive structures.5 It is well established that the N-containing ligands are regarded as a class of excellent candidates for the construction of functional coordination polymers, which have gained the intense interest of chemists.6 In our previous work, we have systematically studied the coordination chemistry of the flexible poly(imidazole) and poly(triazole) ligands such as 1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propane, 1,3,5-tris(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethyl benzene, tri(4-imidazolylphenyl)amine and tetrakis(imidazol-1- ylmethyl)methane.7 Through the use of these ligands, a number of fascinating motifs have been constructed and reported.7 So far, tri- and tetra-(imidazole) or -(triazole) ligands have been studied in coordination chemistry. However, to the best of our knowledge, the coordination chemistry of the hexakis(triazole) ligand has never been investigated.8,9 Taking inspiration from the points mentioned above, we synthesized a new flexible hexadentate ligand hexakis(1,2,4- triazol-ylmethy1)benzene (Htrb). On one hand, the Htrb ligand with six triazole groups can coordinate with metals in varied coordination modes. On the other hand, when coordinated with the metals, the flexible nature of the –CH2– spacers allows the triazole group to bend and rotate freely so as to meet the geometry requirement.10–13 In this work, seven coordination polymers based on the Htrb and different anions, namely, [Zn2(Htrb)0.5(L1)(SO4)]?H2O (1), [Zn1.5(Htrb)0.5(L2)0.5(SO4)]? 5H2O (2), [Zn3(Htrb)(SO4)3(H2O)3]?H2O (3), [Zn(Htrb)0.5(L1)]? 3.5H2O (4), [Cd(Htrb)0.5(L1)(H2O)]?2.5H2O (5), [Co(Htrb)0.5(L1)(H2O)]? 2H2O (6), and [Cu2(Htrb)0.5(L1)2(H2O)]?1.5H2O (7), where H2L1 = 1,3- Key Lab of Polyoxometalate Science, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, People’s Republic of China.

Their structures have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses and further characterized by infrared spectra (IR), elemental analyses, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The topological analyses of the compounds, and the effects of the Htrb ligand and the anions on the structures of the compounds, have been discussed. In addition, the thermal behavior of the seven compounds and the photolumines- cent properties of compounds 1–5 have also been investigated in detail. Experimental Materials and methods The detailed synthetic procedure for the Htrb ligand is shown in the ESI.3 All other reagents for syntheses were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purifica- tion. General characterization and physical measurements. The C, H and N elemental analyses were carried out on a Perkin- Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. The FT-IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the range 4000–400 cm21 on a Mattson Alpha Centauri spectrometer. The photoluminescent properties of compounds 1–5 were measured on a Perkin- Elmer FLS-920 spectrometer at room temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer TG-7 analyzer heated from room temperature to 600 uC under nitrogen atmosphere. PXRD patterns of the samples were collected on a Rigaku Dmax 2000 X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu Ka radia- tion (l = 0.154 nm) and 2h ranging from 5 to 50u at room temperature. The experimental PXRD patterns are in good agreement with the corresponding simulated ones (Fig. S5 and S6 in ESI3). Synthesis of [Zn2(Htrb)0.5(L1)(SO4)]?H2O (1).

X-Ray crystallography Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for 1–7 were recorded on an Oxford Diffraction Gemini R Ultra diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Ka radiation (l = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K (Table 1). Absorption corrections were applied using a multi scan technique. All the structures were solved by direct method of SHELXS-97 and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques using the SHELXL-97 program within WINGX.13 Non hydrogen atoms of all the seven compounds were easily found from the Fourier difference maps and refined with anisotropic temperature parameters. All hydrogen atoms bound to carbon atoms were refined using a riding model with d(C–H) = 0.93 Å, Uiso = 1.2 Ueq(C) for aromatic, d(C–H) = 0.97 Å, Uiso = 1.5 Ueq(C) for CH2 atoms. Water hydrogen atoms were located from difference Fourier maps and refined as riding atoms with d(O–H) = 0.844–0.876 Å and Uiso = 1.5 Ueq(O). The disordered atoms (Cu2 and Cu2A, O1W and O1WA for 7, C9 and C9A, N6 and N6A for 3) were split over two sites, with a total occupancy of 1. The disordered atoms (O2, O2A and O2B for 7) were split over three sites, with a total occupancy of 1. Results and discussion Structure of [Zn2(Htrb)0.5(L1)(SO4)]?H2O (1) Selected bond distances and angles for all the compounds are listed in Tables S1–S7 (see ESI3). The asymmetric unit of 1 contains two Zn(II) ions, half of one Htrb ligand, one L1 anion, one coordinated sulfate anion, and one free water molecule. As shown in Fig. 1a, both Zn1 and Zn2 show the same tetrahedral coordination geometries, whereas their coordination environ- ments are entirely different. The Zn1 ion is four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two different Htrb ligands (Zn1– N1 = 1.978(3), Zn1–N7#2 = 2.038(3) Å), and two oxygen atoms from one L1 anion and one sulfate anion (Zn1–O5 = 1.982(3), Zn1–O4#1 = 1.898(3) Å). The Zn2 ion is coordinated by one nitrogen atom from one Htrb ligand (Zn2–N4 = 1.985(3) Å), and three oxygen atoms from two different sulfate anions and one L1 anion (Zn2–O6 = 1.948(2), Zn2–O8#3 = 1.986(2) and Zn2–O1 = 1.895(2) Å). It is interesting to note that two sulfate anions link four Zn(II) ions to yield a tetranuclear Zn(II) secondary building unit (SBU). Neighboring tetranuclear Zn(II) SBUs are linked by L1 anions to form an infinite two- dimensional (2D) network. The 2D networks are further connected by Htrb ligands to result in the three-dimensional (3D) framework of 1 (Fig. 1b). Topologically, if the L1 anion is considered as a single linker, the Htrb ligand is regarded as a four-connected node, and the tetranuclear SBU can be viewed as an eight-connected node, the structure of 1 can be classified as a 3D (4,8)- connected net with the (32?42?52)(36?48?510?64) topology (Fig. 1c). Structure of [Zn1.5(Htrb)0.5(L2)0.5(SO4)]?5H2O (2) When L1 anions were replaced by L2 anions, a quite different structure of 2 was obtained.

From a topological perspective, if the L2 anion is considered as a single linker, the Htrb ligand is considered as a four- connected node, and the trinuclear Zn(II) clusters can be viewed as a six-connected node, the structure of 2 can be classified as a 3D (4,6)-connected (44?62)(44?610?8) net (Fig. 2c).

As shown in Fig. 3b, each sulfate anion links three Zn(II) ions in different directions to form a 2D sheet. The 2D sheets are further connected by Htrb ligands to generate a 3D framework (Fig. S1, ESI3). From the topological point of view, if the Zn(II) ions are regarded as five-connected nodes, the sulfate anions are considered as three-connected nodes, and the Htrb ligands are viewed as six-connected nodes, the overall structure of 3 is a 3D (3,5,6)-connected net with (42)2(63)(42?68)3(42?86?103)2 topology (Fig. 3c). Structure of [Zn(Htrb)0.5(L1)]?3.5H2O (4) Compounds [Zn(Htrb)0.5(L1)]?3.5H2O (4), [Cd(Htrb)0.5(L1)(H2O)]? 2.5H2O (5) and [Co(Htrb)0.5(L1)(H2O)]?2H2O (6) show similar layer structures. As a result, compound 4 is described in detail as a representative structure. It should be pointed out that com- pounds 4–6 show the same (4?64?8)(42?64) topology, but the coordination numbers of their metal centers are different (seven for 5 and six for 6). The asymmetric unit of 4 contains one crystallographically independent Zn(II) ion, half of one Htrb ligand, one L anion, three and a half lattice water molecules. As shown in Fig. 4a, each Zn(II) center is four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two individual Htrb ligands (Zn1–N1 = 2.014(3), Zn1–N4#2 = 2.025(4) Å), and two oxygen atoms from two L1 anions (Zn1–O1 = 1.995(3), Zn1–O4#1 = 1.983(3) Å), displaying a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Neighboring Zn(II) ions are connected by L1 anions to form an infinite 1D chain (Fig. S2, ESI3). In this way, neighboring chains are further joined by Htrb ligands to generate a 2D layer (Fig. 4b). Topologically, if the L1 anion is considered as a single linker, and the Htrb ligand and the Zn(II) ion can be defined as four-connected nodes, the structure of 4 can be described as having (4,4)-connected (4?64?8)(42?64) topology (Fig. 4c). Structure of [Cu2(Htrb)0.5(L1)2(H2O)]?1.5H2O (7) When CuCl2?2H2O was introduced into the reaction system of 4 instead of Zn(NO3)2?6H2O, a different structure of 7 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 5a, the asymmetric unit of 7 contains two crystallographically independent Cu(II) ions, a half Htrb ligand, two L1 anions, one coordinated water molecule and one and a half free water molecules. Both Cu1 and Cu2 are five-coordinated in distorted square pyramidal coordination geometries, but their coordination environments are entirely different. The Cu1 center is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two different Htrb ligands (Cu1–N1 = 1.970(4), Cu1–N4#1 = 1.992(4) Å), and three oxygen atoms from Fig. 3 (a) The coordination environments of the Zn(II) ions in 3 (30% probability displacement ellipsoids).

Different from Cu1 ion, the Cu2 ion is coordinated by one nitrogen atom from one Htrb ligand (Cu2– N7#2 = 2.036(5) Å), and four oxygen atoms from two L1 anions and one water molecule (Cu2–O4#3 = 1.838(3), Cu2–O7 = 2.147(5), Cu2–O8 = 1.900(5), Cu2–O1W = 2.117(17) Å). Adjacent Cu(II) ions are bridged by L1 ligands to generate a 1D chain structure (Fig. 5b). Neighboring chains are further extended by Htrb ligands into a 3D framework structure (Fig. 5c). Topologically, if each binuclear Cu1 unit can be considered as a 6-connected node, each Cu2 ion can be regarded as a 3-connected node, and each Htrb ligand can be regarded as a 4-connected node, the resulting structure of 7 can be considered as a (3,4,6)-connected net with the (4?62)(8?65)(42?68?83?102) topology. The most fascinating fea- ture of compound 7 is that two identical 3D frameworks interlock each other, resulting in a 3D 2-fold interpenetrating framework (Fig. 5d). Coordination modes of the Htrb ligand. From the structure descriptions above, we found that the hexakis(triazole) of the Htrb ligand can adopt a variety of coordination modes due to the flexible nature of the –CH2– spacers between the host benzene and six triazole substituents. In fact, there exist four kinds of coordination modes for Htrb ligand in compounds 1– 7 (Scheme 2). The Htrb ligand displays 1,2,3-up/4,5,6-down (modes I and III) and 1,3,5-up/2,4,6-down (modes II and IV) conformations in 1–7. From the results above, we can see it is difficult for the six identical triazole substituents to locate on the same side of the benzene plane because of the steric hindrance of the giant hexakis(triazole) groups. In modes I and II, the Htrb ligand connects six metals in 1,2,3-up/4,5,6- down (compounds 1, 2 and 7) and 1,3,5-up/2,4,6-down (compound 3) fashions, respectively. While, in modes III and IV, the Htrb ligand connects four metals in 1,2,3-up/4,5,6- down (compounds 5 and 6) and 1,3,5-up/2,4,6-down (com- pound 4) fashions, respectively. The coordination modes of the Htrb ligands have significant effects on the resultant structures of compounds 1–7. In compounds 1, 2, and 7, each Htrb ligand links six metal ions in mode I to furnish the 3D framework. In compound 3, the Htrb ligand bridges six metal centers in a 1,3,5-up/2,4,6-down fashion (mode II) to form the 3D framework. Compounds 4–6 show similar layer structures. In compounds 5 and 6, each N-donor ligand links four metal centers in a 1,2,3-up/4,5,6-down fashion (mode III), yielding the 2D layer structure. In compound 4, the Htrb ligand links four Zn(II) ions in a 1,3,5-up/2,4,6-down fashion (mode IV) to generate a 2D sheet. Based on the above discussion, we can see that the flexible bridging N-donor ligands used here very easily form high dimensional structures. In modes I and II, the Htrb ligands are inclined to form 3D frameworks. Take compounds [Zn3(Htrb)(SO4)3(H2O)3]?H2O (3) and [Cu2(Htrb)0.5(L1)2(H2O)]? 1.5H2O (7) for example. In 3, each Zn(II) center bridges three adjacent sulfate anions and each sulfate anion links three Zn(II) ions in different directions to form a 2D layer. The layers are further extended by Htrb ligands to generate a 3D framework. In 7, the L anions connect the Cu(II) ions to furnish a 1D chain, which is further linked by Htrb ligands to form a 3D 2-fold interpenetrating framework. Nevertheless, in modes III and IV, the N-donor ligands tend to form 2D structures. Here, we take compounds [Zn(Htrb)0.5(L1)]?3.5H2O (4) and [Cd(Htrb)0.5(L1)(H2O)]?2.5H2O (5) for example. In compounds 4 and 5, the metal ions are connected by L1 anions to form an infinite 1D chain. These chains are further joined by Htrb ligands to generate a 2D layer. Effect of anions on the framework. In the mixed-ligand coordination polymers 1–7,14 the organic and inorganic anions play crucial roles on the final structures of the coordination polymers. Compounds 1 and 4 show the effects of inorganic anions on the complex structures. Compared with compound 4, compound 1 has an additional coordination sulfate anion. The presence of the sulfate anion is the main factor that led to the structure difference between 1 and 4. In compound 4, the only anion L1 linked the Zn(II) ions to form the 1D chains, which are further connected by the Htrb ligands to generate a 2D structure. However, in compound 1, the additional coordination sulfate anions linked four Zn(II) ions to yield a tetranuclear Zn(II) cluster. Neighboring tetranuclear clusters are linked by L1 anions to form an infinite 2D layer, which are further connected by Htrb ligands to result in the 3D framework of 1. On the other hand, the organic anions also can influence the complex structures. Generally, the role of the organic carboxylate anions may be explained in terms of the differences between them, such as the number of the carboxylate groups, the length and flexibility of the spacers, the positions of the carboxylate groups, the nature of the substituting groups and so on.15 Compounds 1 and 2 show the effect of the organic dicarboxylates (H2L1 and H2L2). Although both H2L1 and H2L2 are rigid dicarboxylate ligands, their structures are entirely different. The H2L1 contains a phenyl spacer between the two carboxylates, whereas the H2L2 has a – CLC– group between the two carboxylates. The angles between the two carboxylates in H2L1 and H2L2 are also different. In H2L1, the angle between two dicarboxylates is 120u, while it is 180u in H2L2. The structure difference between H2L1 and H2L2 influences their complex structures. In compound 1, the L1 anions link the tetranuclear Zn(II) units based on sulfate anions and Zn(II) ions to yield a 2D layer. The layers are further connected by Htrb ligands to result in a 3D (4,8)-connected framework. However, in compound 2, the L2 anions connect the trinuclear Zn(II) clusters constructed by sulfate anions and Zn(II) ions to form infinite 1D chains, which are further linked by Htrb ligands to yield a 3D (4,6)-connected framework.

View Article Online IR spectra In the IR spectra of compounds 1–7, the broad characteristic absorption bands of the water molecules are observed in the range of 3345–3648 cm21.2b For compounds 1, 2 and 4–7, the peaks in the range of 1500–1591 cm21 and 1315–1477 cm21 are attributable to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylate groups, respectively. The bands in the range of 1000–1697 cm21 and 3034–3150 cm21 can be assigned to the characteristic peaks of the Htrb ligands.16 Thermal analysis and PXRD patterns In order to estimate the stability of the coordination architectures of compounds 1–7, their thermal behavior was examined by TGA. The experiments were performed on samples consisting of numerous single crystals of 1–7 under a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 uC min21, Fig. S5 (see ESI3). For 1, the weight loss of 3.5% in the temperature range of 40 to 97 uC is attributed to the removal of two coordinated water molecules (obsd 3.5%, calcd 2.60%). The anhydrous com- pound starts decomposition at 361 uC. The decomposition does not end until the compound is heated to 600 uC. Compound 2 has two steps of weight loss. The first step is assigned to the release of five free water molecules from 27 to 143 uC (obsd 14.9%, calcd 14.43%). The second step is consistent with the decomposition of the anhydrous com- pound from 247 to 476 uC. The remaining weight corresponds to the formation of ZnO (obsd 18.7%, calcd 19.49%). For compound 3, the weight loss from 34 to 128 uC can be attributed to the release of free and coordinated water molecules (obsd 5.5%, calcd 5.75%). The anhydrous organic ligand decomposes from 236 uC. The residue corresponds to the formation of ZnO (obsd 20.8%, calcd 19.49%). Compound 4 undergoes dehydration in the temperature range from 40 to 118 uC (obsd 11.5%, calcd 10.96%). The decomposition of the anhydrous compound occurs from 347 to 522 uC. The departure of the structure leads to the formation of ZnO as the residue (obsd 13.2%, calcd 14.09%). For compound 5, the weight loss between 34 and 115 uC corresponds to the release of two and a half free water molecules and one coordinated water molecule (obsd 11.8%, calcd 10.13%). The weight loss corresponds to the release of organic ligands from 317 to 463 uC. The remaining residue is assigned to the formation of CdO (obsd 19.42%, calcd 20.91%). Similarly, compound 6 shows two steps of losing weight. The first loss step from 27 to 143 uC can be attributed to the removal of two lattice water molecules and one coordinated water molecule (obsd 10.1%, calcd 8.92%). The second step corresponding with the decomposi- tion of the anhydrous compound occurs from 316 to 462 uC. The final residue is assigned to the formation of CoO (obsd 12.8%, calcd 13.41%). For compound 7, the weight loss corresponding to the release of free water molecules and one coordinated water molecule is observed from 26 to 128 uC (obsd 6.65%, calcd 5.75%). The anhydrous organic ligand starts decomposition from 242 uC. The remaining residue corresponds to the formation of CuO (obsd 19.8%, calcd 20.44%). The XRPD patterns of compounds 1–7 were carried out so as to exam the purities of the compounds. The experimental PXRD patterns match well with the corresponding computer- simulated ones except for the relative intensity variation (Fig. S6, ESI3). Therefore, the phase purity of the synthesized bulk materials is substantiated. Luminescent properties Luminescent coordination polymers containing d10 metal atoms have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in chemical sensors, photochemistry, and elec- troluminescent display.17 In this work, solid-state luminescent studies were carried out for H2L1, H2L2, Htrb and compounds 1–5 (Fig. 6 and Table 2). The main emission peaks of the free Htrb ligand, H2L1 and H2L2 are at 501 nm (lex = 340 nm), 403 nm (lex = 355 nm) and 424 nm (lex = 350 nm), respectively,14 which may be attributed to the p* A n or p* A p transitions as previously reported.18 The emission spectra of Zn(II)-containing com- pounds exhibit emission peaks at 474 nm (lex = 311 nm) for 1, 449 nm (lex = 324 nm) for 2, 471 nm (lex = 317 nm) for 3, and 467 nm (lex = 322 nm) for 4. The emission spectrum for the Cd(II)-containing compound exhibits an emission peak at 492 nm (lex = 319 nm) for 5. The emission peaks of compounds 1– 5 are similar to that of the free Htrb ligand. Since the Zn(II) and Cd(II) ions are difficult to oxidize or to reduce due to their d10 configuration,19 the emissions of compounds 1–5 are neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to- metal charge transfer (LMCT) in nature.20 As a result, the emissions can be assigned to intraligand transitions. However, Fig. 6 Solid-state emission spectra of Zn-containing compounds (1, 2, 3, 4) and Cd-containing compound (5) at room temperature.

View Article Online the emission spectra of compounds 1–5 exhibit blue-shifts relative to the free Htrb ligands, which may result from the coordination effects of the Htrb ligands, dicarboxylate anions, and inorganic anions to the metal cations.21 Conclusions Seven new coordination polymers based on the Htrb ligand and various anions have been successfully prepared under hydrothermal conditions. These compounds display intri- guing and versatile 2D and 3D structures with different topologies. The results indicate that the coordination modes of the Htrb ligands and the anions play dominant roles in the assembly of the coordination polymers. The photoluminescent properties of compounds 1–5 have been investigated at room temperature. It is anticipated that other novel coordination polymers with various entertaining structures as well as physical properties will be synthesized through using the Htrb ligand.

The hexakis(bromomethyl)benzene was prepared according to the procedures reported previously.1 Bromine (17.5 mL) was added slowly over 2 h to a boiling solution of hexamethylbenzene (6.5 g, 0.04 mol) in 1,2-dibromoethane (150 mL) and refluxed continuously for 30 h. Then, the hexakis(bromomethyl)benzene was cooled down and collected by filtration (22.4 g, yield: 88%). Hexakis(bromomethyl)benzene (5.00 g, 7.86 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of 1,2,4-triazole (3.21 g, 47.16 mmol) and NaOH (1.89 g, 47.25 mmol) in 100 mL DMF. Then, the mixture was heated at 80 ℃ for 3 h, cooled and solvent removed. Washed with MeOH for three times and dried so as to get pure Htrb with a yield of 78.5%. 1 A. D. U. Hardy, D. D.
