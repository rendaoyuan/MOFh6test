MMPF-7 and MMPF-8 possess the pts topology and exhibit interesting CO2 adsorption properties. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)1 have been intensively developed as a promising new type of functional porous materials over the past two decades. The features of their designability of structures, tunability of pore sizes and modularity of properties,2 by virtue of crystal engineering strategies3 as well as their unprecedented permanent porosity afford them great potential for applications in gas storage,4 gas separation,5 heterocatalysis,6 sensors7 and other areas.8 In addition, under the concept of “reticular synthesis”,9 the properties of prototypal MOF platforms could be targeted via versatile functionalization or the custom-design of organic linkers, e.g. metallosalen ligands,10 metalloporphyrin-based ligands.11,12 Metal–metalloporphyrin frameworks (MMPFs), as one expanding branch of MOFs recently demonstrated by our group11 and several other groups,12 have been explored as candidates for a promising platform for the aforementioned applications, particularly towards biomimetic catalysis,11e,13 light harvesting14 and gas storage.15 Among the various metalloporphyrins, In–metallated porphyrins are known as anion carriers for ion-selective electrodes based on polymeric membranes.16 However, it occurred to us that indium-based MMPFs still remain underexplored. In this contribution, we report two rare indium-based porous MMPFs, dubbed MMPF-7 and MMPF-8, which are based upon 5,10,15,20- tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (tcpp) and 5,10,15,20- tetrakis(4-carboxybiphenyl)porphyrin (tcbpp), respectively (Scheme 1). Dark red block crystals of MMPF-7 and MMPF-8 were harvested by reacting In(NO3)2·xH2O with the tcpp ligand and tcbpp ligand, respectively, in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) under solvothermal conditions for 48 hours (see ESI†). Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that MMPF-7 crystallizes in the space group of C2/c.§ The asym- metric unit (Fig. 1a) of MMPF-7 contains one tcpp ligand and two In(III) cations, one of which resides in the porphyrin ring center of the tcpp ligand. The other In(III) ion is eight- coordinate via chelation in a bidentate manner with four car- boxylate groups from four different tcpp ligands. Every indium–metallated tcpp ligand connects with four In(III) ions to form an overall three-dimensional (3D) structure for MMPF-7 (Fig. 1b and c). Due to the strong π–π interactions among the porphyrin macrocycles (the distance between every two porphyrin rings is ∼4.2 Å), three-fold a Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, 4202 East Flower Avenue, Tampa, Florida 33620, United States.

Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic studies conducted using synchrotron radiation at the Advanced Pho- ton Source, Argonne National Laboratory, revealed that MMPF-8 crystallizes in the space group Cc.§ With regard to MMPF-8, the asymmetric unit is comprised of four tcbpp ligands and eight In(III) ions, four of which are located in the porphyrin macrocycles (Fig. 2a). Similar to the coordination mode in MMPF-7, each of the remaining four In(III) ions is eight-coordinate with eight oxygen atoms of four carboxyl groups from four different tcbpp ligands via a bidentate che- lation manner (Fig. 2b,c). In contrast, the extension from tcpp to tcbpp via the phenyl ring leads to a four-fold inter- penetrating 3D structure in MMPF-8 (Fig. 2d). Topologically, both MMPF-7 and MMPF-8 can be described as 4,4-connected pts networks, in which each In(III) ion, serving as the 4-connected node, is bridged by four In(III)–metallated porphyrin ligands (tcpp or tcbpp) serving as the 4-connected linkers through the carboxylate groups.17a Both MMPF-7 and MMPF-8 are porous and have a solvent accessible volume of 40.2% and 52.1%, respectively, calcu- lated using PLATON.17b The phase purity of MMPF-7 and MMPF-8 was verified by powder X-ray diffraction studies, which revealed that the dif- fraction patterns of the fresh samples are consistent with the calculated ones (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies were conducted on fresh MMPF-7 and MMPF-8 samples. MMPF-7 exhibits a continuous weight loss of ∼17% from 30 °C to ∼200 °C, corresponding to the loss of guest solvent molecules trapped in the channels and coordi- nated water molecules of the In ions within the porphyrin rings. The plot is followed by a relatively steady plateau from 200 to 400 °C before complete decomposition of the frame- work (Fig. S3, ESI†). MMPF-8 demonstrates a weight loss of ∼38% from 30 °C to ∼180 °C, corresponding to the loss of guest molecules. The plot is followed by a steady plateau from 180 to 400 °C before complete decomposition of the framework (Fig. S3, ESI†). On the basis of the thermogravimetric plots of these two samples, both of them share the same decomposition temperature of around 400 °C. The thermal behavior characterized by the TGA indi- cates the robustness of these frameworks. To evaluate the permanent porosity of MMPF-7 and MMPF-8, gas adsorption studies were performed on the acti- vated samples. As shown in Fig. S4, ESI,† the N2 adsorption isotherm collected at 77 K reveals that MMPF-8 exhibits an uptake capacity of ∼150 cm3 g−1 at one atmosphere pressure with typical type-I adsorption behaviour, as expected for microporous materials. Derived from the N2 adsorption data at 77 K, MMPF-8 possesses a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of ∼440 m2 g−1 (P/P0 = 0.01–0.10), corresponding to a Langmuir surface area of ∼510 m2 g−1 (P/P0 = 0.9). How- ever, the activated MMPF-7 did not show a significant uptake of N2 at 77 K, which can be presumably due to the relatively small pore size precluding the access of N2 molecules. We evaluated the CO2 uptake performances of MMPF-7 and MMPF-8. As shown in Fig. 3a, MMPF-7 can adsorb sub- stantial amounts of CO2 with an uptake capacity of 10.7 wt% (55 cm3 g−1) at 273 K and 6.6 wt% (34 cm3 g−1) at 298 K under 1 atm pressure. These values are moderate compared to some porous MOFs with open metal sites or amine func- tional groups. In comparison, MMPF-8, with a higher num- ber of interpenetration folds, demonstrated an enhanced CO2 uptake capacity with 16.2 wt% (82 cm3 g−1) at 273 K and 9.3 wt% (47 cm3 g−1) at 298 K under 1 atm pressure. Different from other reports of enhancing CO2 uptake via interpenetra- tion,18 we speculate that the higher CO2 uptake capacity of MMPF-8 should be mainly due to its larger surface area com- pared to MMPF-7 (910 m2 g−1 vs. 600 m2 g−1 calculated by non-local density functional theory19 on the basis of the CO2 adsorption isotherm at 273 K), since the calculated heat of adsorption of CO2 of MMPF-8 is lower than that of MMPF-7 (∼28 kJ mol−1 vs. ∼32 kJ mol−1) (Fig. 3b).

MMPF-7 and MMPF-8 exhibit permanent porosity and demonstrate interesting CO2 adsorption perfor- mances. Ongoing work in our laboratories includes the custom-design of new variants of porphyrin-based ligands for the construction of functional MMPF materials and exploring them for applications in sensors, catalysis and photoreaction systems.

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction for MMPF-7 and MMPF-8 The X-ray diffraction data for MMPF-8 were collected using synchrotron radiation, λ = 0.41328 Å, at Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Lab, Chicago. The X-ray diffraction data for MMPF-7 were collected using Bruker-AXS SMART-APEXII CCD diffractometer (CuKα , λ = 1.54178 Å). Indexing was performed using APEX22 (Difference Vectors method). Data integration and reduction were performed using SaintPlus 6.01.3 Absorption correction was performed by multi-scan method implemented in SADABS.4 Space groups were determined using XPREP implemented in APEX2.2 Structures were solved using SHELXS-97 (direct methods) and refined using SHELXL-97 (full-matrix least-squares on F2) contained in WinGX5,6,7,8 and OLEX2 programs.9 MMPF-7 All non-H atoms were found in the difference Fourier map and all (except disordered O1) were refined anisotropically. The position in the center of porphyrin core is partially occupied by In2 atom with refined occupancy of 0.284(2). The contribution of heavily disordered solvent molecules / counterions was treated as diffuse using Squeeze procedure implemented in Platon program.10, 11 Hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions and included in the refinement process using riding model with isotropic thermal parameters: Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(-CH). Crystal data and refinement conditions are shown in Table S1. Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for CrystEngComm This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 S7 MMPF-8 All non-H atoms were found in the difference Fourier map and were refined anisotropically. Despite the fact that synchrotron radiation have been used, diffraction data were observed only up to 1.05 Å resolution which could be attributed to solvent disorder. All atoms have been refined using restraints (DFIX, DANG, FLAT, DELU, SIMU, ISOR) and constraints for benzene rings (AFIX 66) in order to obtain chemically feasible model which would otherwise be distorted due to the lower resolution of diffraction data. The contribution of heavily disordered solvent molecules was treated as diffuse using Squeeze procedure implemented in Platon program.9,10 Hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions and included in the refinement process using riding model with isotropic thermal parameters: Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(-CH). Crystals has been racemic twin with BASF = 0.25(1). Crystal data and refinement conditions are shown in Table S2. Table S1.
