Compound 1 is a homochiral architecture with low connectivity, and compound 2 is an achiral 3D framework with high 12-connectivity. It is unprecedent to get 10 homochiral and achiral supramolecular isomers in one-pot synthesis. Since the term ‘supramolecular isomerism’ has been raised by Zaworotko and coworkers in 2001, construction of supramolecular isomers has gained a great deal of interest in the 15 last few years. 1 The investigation in this field is aimed not only to develop fundamental study of influencing factors in self- assembly process, but also to produce novel materials of different potential applications. It is well known that non-rigid ligands are usually typical 20 building molecules for the assembly of interesting entangled structures, attributed to their variable geometries.2 Therefore, we designed and synthesized a neutral tetradentate non-rigid ligand, 1,1'-oxybis[3,5-dipyridine-benzene] (L) (Scheme 1 of ESI†). The introduction of co-ligand, 4,4'-oxybis(benzoate) (H2OBA), has a 25 crucial effect on constructing architectures, which gives us additional options to tune the structures.3 Although one-pot synthesis of two and more supramolecular isomers has been reported,4 such synthesis of homochiral and achiral supramolecular isomers is not reported. The reaction of 30 Co(NO3)2 ． ． ． ．6H2O, H2OBA and L ligand produces purple prismatic crystals of {[Co(L)(OBA)]·(H2O)}n (1), and red block crystals of {[Co5O2(L)2(OBA)3]·(DMF)}n (2). Compounds 1 and 2 have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The results show that they are homochiral and achiral, 35 respectively. The purities of the bulk products have been independently confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements (Fig. S1 and Fig. S2). The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of one Co(II) cation, one L molecule, one OBA anion and one lattice water molecule (Fig. 40 S3a), which crystallizes in a chiral space group P65. The carboxylate groups of OBA anions adopt bidentate chelating coordination modes. Relying on the coordinate interaction between carboxyl oxygen and metal ions, the OBA anions bridge Co centers into a 65 helix with a helical pitch of 37.33 Å. Besides, 45 two coordinated pyridine groups also bridge Co centers. As a result, two unequal coaxial double-stranded helical chains are formed (Fig. 1a and Fig. S3b), they possess the same pitches. The resulting 65 helices with the same handedness are further linked up by the OBA anions to form a 3D framework. As shown in Fig. 50 S3c, the helical channel was occupied by the uncoordinated pyridyl groups of the L ligands. Attributed to the H-bond interaction between the uncoordinated N atoms and the lattice water, the water molecules form another helical chain inside the molecular helix (Fig. 1b). A better insight into the nature of this 55 intricate framework is provided by a TOPOS analysis software.5 The Co(II) cations and the L ligands both can be regarded as a 4- connected node. Therefore, the whole structure can thus be represented as a 4-c net qtz topology 6c (with the Schläfli symbol {64.82}). The potential voids are large enough to be filled via 60 mutual interpenetration of two independent equivalent frameworks, generating a 3-fold interpenetrating 3D architecture (Fig. S3d). An analysis of the topology of interpenetration, according to a recent classification,6 reveals that it belongs to Class Ia, Z = 3 (Zt=3; Zn=1). 65 Fig. 1. (a) A view of coaxial double-stranded helical chains along the b axis; (b) A view of the water helical chain inside the molecular helix along the c axis. The space group for compound 1 is P65, indicating the intrinsic 70 chirality of the framework. Despite tremendous improvement in the synthesis of 3D chiral framework materials in the past several decades,7 the study of 3D chiral framework materials, particularly those homochiral MOFs prepared from achiral starting precursors, is not extensive8. The result of second harmonic generation (SHG) 75 measurements revealed that compound 1 has a SHG response and the SHG efficiency is approximately 0.3 times that of urea.

Since complex 1 crystallizes in a chiral space group, it is associated with the point group of C6, one of the ten polar point 5 groups, which might display ferroelectric behavior. The ferroelectric data of the powder pellet samples of 1 were measured at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Experimental result (Fig. S5) indicates an electric hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization (Pr) of 0.055 µC/cm2 and a coercive field (Ec) of 10 2.65 kV/cm, respectively. The saturation of the spontaneous polarizations (Ps) is ca. 0.645 µC/cm2 (bule: 2400v, red: 2000v). Single-crystal X-ray analysis reveals that compound 2 crystallizes in the space group C2/c. There are three independent octahedral Co2+ cations in the asymmetric unit: Co2 and Co3 are 15 located at general positions, whereas Co1 lies on an inversion centre and one of the OBA ligands has the central oxygen O3 on a twofold axis. As shown in Fig. S6a, Co1 is coordinated to six oxygen atoms from four OBA anions and two µ3-O anions; Co2 is surrounded by three carboxylate oxygen atoms from three 20 OBA anions and one µ3-O anion with two additional coordinations to L ligands; and Co3 is also coordinated to three carboxylate oxygen atoms and one µ3-O anion, leaving another two coordination sites occupied by N atoms from two L ligands. There are two µ3-O anions, which connect five Co cations to form 25 a [Co5O2] cluster. The carboxylate groups from OBA anions further edge the [Co5O2] unit in the bi- and tridentate bridging modes to form a 4-c 3D cds architecture (Fig. S6b). While, not considering the OBA, the L ligands connect the clusters to get a 4,8-connect 3D alb framework (Fig.S6c). Therefore, we can 30 deﬁne the [Co5O2] cluster as a 12-connected node and the L ligand as a 4-connected node, which is depicted in Fig. 2. To the best of our knowledge, the network based on 12-connected nodes is less reported to date.9 Caculated by Platon, 10 the 3D framework 2 (Fig.S6d) occupies only 56.9 % of the total crystal 35 volume, and the remaining space is occupied by the DMF molecules. Fig. 2. Schematic representation of 4,12-connect topology. 40 The construction of pentanuclear cobalt unit has attracted us much interest. Topologically, it has great potential in building highly connected metal–organic frameworks, since it has more coordination sites and causes less steric hindrance. In terms of physical properties, the pentanuclear complex may exhibit 45 single-molecule magnet behavior at low temperature. 11 Direct-current (dc) magnetic susceptibility studies of polycrystalline samples (Fig. 3) reveal a room-temperature χMT value of 11.77 cm3Kmol-1, larger than that for five free S = 3/2 spins (χMT = 9.38 cm3Kmol-1 and g = 2) as a result of the orbital 50 contribution of the high-spin Co (II) to the magnetism. The χMT product gradually decreases with lowering temperature, reaching a minimum value of 2.1 cm3Kmol-1 at 10 K, which is mainly ascribed to the spin-orbit coupling effects of the cobalt (II) centers. The strong anisotropy of the Co(II) ion does not permit 55 us to quantify the magnitude of the coupling constants, but a qualitative approach to the interaction pattern may be deduced from the above data. The χMT value then declines slowly at 2 K, which suggests the presence of intramolecular ferromagnetic interactions between the metal Co centres. The M vs. H/T (Fig. 4) 60 data reveals a rapid increase of the magnetization at low magnetic ﬁelds, which eventually reaches the saturate value. The non- superimposed M vs. H/T curves confirm the presence of a signiﬁcant magnetic anisotropy and/or low lying excited states.12a The dynamic property was also investigated using temperature 65 and frequency dependent ac susceptibility measurements. The shape and frequency dependence of the in-phase (χ′) and out-of- phase signals (χ′′) observed in Fig. S7 of ESI† suggest that compound 2 is a SMM with a blocking temperature below 1.8 K. 12 70 Fig. 3. Temperature dependence of the χMT product at 2kOe; inset: χM vs. T plot at different temperatures. 75 Fig. 4. M vs. H/T plot. To evaluate the permanent porosity of the framework of compound 2, nitrogen sorption isotherm measurements were performed on the desolvated crystalline samples at 77 K. It 80 exhibits type I sorption isotherms and takes up 175.4 cm3g-1 of N2 (Fig. 5). Its Langmuir and BET surface areas of 720.8 and 493.4 m2g-1 are calculated, respectively. Low-pressure H2 uptake was further measured at 77K. Its uptake reaches about 151.7 (1.35 wt%) at 850 mmHg, which is higher than that of MOF-177 (1.24 85 Page 2 of 3 ChemComm Chemical Communications Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by Pennsylvania State University on 13 September 2012 Published on 12 September 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C2CC36003A View Online This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry [year] Journal Name, [year], [vol], 00–00 | 3 wt%).13 The result shows that compound 2 with permanent porosity shows good affinity for hydrogen. Meanwhile, CO2 and CH4 isotherms at 273 K reach the maximums of 101.6 cm3g-1 and 35.1cm3g-1, respectively (Fig. 6). When the pressure is increased, the CO2 adsorption capacity greatly exceeded that of CH4. It is 5 suggested that 2 has a potential application in gas separation processes of CH4/CO2. The median pore width is 7.142 Å (obtained from the Horvath-Kawazoe method), the selectivity for CO2/CH4 can not be attributed to the pores restricting the adsorption of gases. The lower CH4 adsorption is due to its 10 smaller quadrupole moment and lower polarisability than that of CO2. 14 Fig. 5. Nitrogen isotherms measured at 77 K.

CO2 (magenta) and CH4 (turquiose) sorption isotherms at 273 K. 20 In summary, two homochiral and achiral supramolecular isomers described herein were obtained in one-pot synthesis; they display quite different structures (low or high connectivity) and show significantly different physical properties. One contains coaxial 25 double-stranded helical chains and another helical water chain and exhibits homochirality; the other with permanent porosity shows good affinity for hydrogen and carbon dioxide and exhibits single-molecule-magnet behaviour.

Reagents and solvents employed were commercially available. L ligand was prepared on the basis of palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.1 IR absorption spectra of the compounds 1 and 2 were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm-1 on a Nicolet (Impact 410) spectrometer with KBr pellets (5 mg of sample in 500 mg of KBr). C, H and N analyses were carried out with a Perkin Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Mo-K radiation ( = 0.71073 Å), in which the X-ray tube was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a Perkin Elmer thermogravimetric analyzer Pyris 1 TGA up to 1023 K using a heating rate of 10 K min-1 under N2 atmosphere. The second-order nonlinear optical intensity was estimated by measuring a powder sample relative to urea. A pulsed Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm was used to generate a SHG signal. The backscattered SHG light was collected by a spherical concave mirror and passed through a filter that transmits only 532 nm radiation. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of 1 were recorded at room temperature with a Jasco J-810(S) spectropolarimeter (KBr pellets). The electric hysteresis loops were recorded on a Ferroelectric Tester Precision Premier II made by Radiant Technologies, Inc. Direct current (DC) magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements were carried out on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The alternating current (AC) susceptibility down to 1.8 K was performed in a zero DC field and a 5.0 Oe field oscillating at frequencies in the 1–1500 Hz range. The gas sorption isotherms were measured by Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M+C surface area analyzer.

Crystallographic data of 1 and 2 were collected on a Bruker Apex Smart CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) using the ω-scan technique. The intensity data were integrated by using the SAINT program.2 An empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program.3 The structures were solved by direct method and the nonhydrogen atoms were located from the trial structures and then refined anisotropically with SHELXTL using full-matrix least-squares procedures based on F2 values. The positions of the non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement factors. The hydrogen atoms were positioned geometrically by using a riding model. The distribution of peaks in the channels of 2 was chemically featureless to refine, using conventional discrete-atom models. To resolve these issues, Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 the contribution of the electron density by the remaining solvent molecules was removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON.4 The number of electrons thus located, 804 per unit cell, is included in the formula, formula weight, calculated density,  and F(000). This residual electron density was assigned to five of the DMF molecules, [804 /4 = 201e per two ligands]. Crystal data: for 1: [C46H32CoN4O7], Mr = 811.69, hexagonal, space group P65, a = 13.5091(7), b = 13.5091(7), c = 36.8157(19) Å, γ = 120.00, V = 5818.6(5) Å3, Z = 6, Dc=1.390 g·cm-3, µ(Mo-Ka) = 0.502 mm-1,T = 296(2) K, 33619 reflections measured, 7694 independent reflections (Rint = 0.0865), final R1 [I > 2σ(I)] = 0.0309 and final wR(F2) = 0.0567.

Gas Sorption Measurements In the gas sorption measurement, Ultra-high-purity grade, N2, H2, CO2 and CH4 (>99.999%) were used throughout the adsorption experiments. All of the measured sorption isotherms have been repeated several times to confirm the reproducibility within experimental error. Adsorption measurements (up to 1 bar) were performed on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M+C surface area analyzer. About 110 mg of samples 2 were activated at 80 °C for 10 hours by using the “outgas” function of the surface area analyzer. Helium was used for the estimation of the dead volume, assuming that it is not adsorbed at any of the studied temperatures. To provide high accuracy and precision in determining P/P0, the saturation pressure P0 was measured throughout the N2 analyses by means of a dedicated saturation pressure transducer, which allowed us to monitor the vapor pressure for each data point. A part of the N2 sorption isotherm in Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 the P/P0 range 0.05-0.3 was fitted to the BET equation to estimate the BET surface area and the Langmuir surface area calculation was performed using all data points. The pore size distribution was obtained from the Horvath-Kawazoe (micropore) method in the Micromeritics ASAP2020 software package based on the N2 sorption at 77K. The H2 isotherm was measured at 77 K and the CO2 and CH4 isotherms were measured at 273 K.
