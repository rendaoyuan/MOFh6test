In addition to serving 299 1074-1542/04/0500-0299/0 C⃝2004 Plenum Publishing Corporation 300 Davis et al. Scheme 1. as bidentate linkers of metal ions through their pyridyl nitrogens, these ligands are also capable of interacting through hydrogen bonding, which may enhance the binding and selectivity of poten- tial guest species. Characterization of [Co(saccharinate)2(L1)(H2O)2]n solvate In this paper we report the synthesis and char- acterization of the title compound in which L1 is utilized to link Co(saccharinate)2(H2O)2 units to form an interesting microporous coordination polymer. Our use of the saccharinate anion, which has thus far been under utilized in the fabrication of coordination polymers, stems from its ability to interact in a variety of interesting modes.23−30 For example,itmayserveasamonodentate,bidentate, or bridging ligand, forming N- or O-bonded metal complexes. Noncovalent interactions are also pos- sible, with the oxygen and nitrogen atoms being available for hydrogen bonding. Further, the ben- zene ring of the saccharinate anion offers the pos- sibility of aromatic interactions. In the title com- pound several of the above interactions are in- volved in the formation and stabilization of the extended 3-D framework. Experimental Materials All solvents and reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without fur- ther puriﬁcation. The ligand L1 was prepared as previously described.31 [Co(saccharinate)2· 4H2O]·2H2O was prepared by the literature method.32 Synthesis of [Co(saccharinate)2(L1)(H2O)2]n solvate A solution of [Co(saccharinate)2· 4H2O] ·2H2O (0.100 mmol) in warm ethanol (8 mL) was carefully layered onto a solution of L1 (0.200 mmol) in warm methylene chloride (8 mL). Dif- fusion between the two solutions over a period A new microporous coordination polymer 301 of 1 week produced orange block-shaped crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray analysis. Physical measurements The infrared spectrum of the title compound was recorded in the 500–4000 cm−1 region using a KBr disk on a Midac PRS-102s FT-IR spectrom- eter. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a powdered sample using a TA Instruments SDT 2960, simultaneous DTA-TGA. The sample was heated from 25 to 800◦C at 5◦/min in a helium atmosphere with a ﬂow rate of 70 cc/min. Crystal structure determination An orange block-shaped crystal of dimen- sions 0.48 × 0.42 × 0.24 mm3 was mounted onto the end of a thin glass ﬁber using inert oil. X-ray intensity data were measured at 150.0(2) K on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD-based diffractome- ter (Mo Kα, λ = 0.71073 ˚A). The raw data frames were integrated with SAINT+,33 which also ap- plied corrections for Lorentz and polarization effects. Analysis of the data showed negligible crystal decay during data collection. An empir- ical absorption correction based on the multiple measurementofequivalentreﬂectionswasapplied with the program SADABS.34 The title compound crystallizes in the tri- clinic crystal system. The space group P-1 was assumed and conﬁrmed by the successful solu- tion and reﬁnement of the data. The structure was solved by a combination of direct methods and difference Fourier syntheses, and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares against F2, using the SHELXTL software package.34 Despite several attempted models, no chemi- cally reasonable solution could be obtained for the disordered guest species present in the channels of the crystalline material. These were accounted for using SQUEEZE35/PLATON.36 The program calculated a solvent-accessible void volume in the unit cell of 193.6 ˚A3 (23.4% of the total cell vol- ume), corresponding to 63 electrons per cell. The contribution of these diffusely scattering species was then subtracted from the structure factor cal- culations. The tabulated crystallographic data re- ﬂect only the known cell contents. Eventually, all non-hydrogenatomswerereﬁnedwithanisotropic displacement parameters; hydrogen atoms except H1A and H1B of coordinated water were placed in geometrically idealized positions and included as riding atoms with reﬁned isotropic displacement parameters. H1A and H1B were located in the difference map and reﬁned subject to the restraint d(O H) = 0.84(2) ˚A with isotropic displacement parameters. Crystal data, data collection parameters, and reﬁnement statistics for the title compound are listed in Table 1. Atomic coordinates and isotropic displacement parameters are listed in Table 2.

The bond distances be- tween Co(II) and the coordinated atoms are typ- ical, with Co N1 = 2.2015(18) ˚A, Co N11 = 2.2044(18) ˚A, and Co O1 = 2.0414(18) ˚A. All bond distances and angles of L1, which also re- sides on a crystallographic center of symmetry, are similar to those found in other coordination poly- mers that we have prepared with this ligand.20−22 The saccharinate anion also displays structural parameters that are consistent with those of the parent [Co(saccharinate)2·4H2O]·2H2O starting compound and with other metal saccharinate complexes.29,30 All the ligands of the title compound partici- pate in hydrogen bonding.

In addition, there are weak interchain con- tacts involving the saccharinate sulfonyl oxygen atoms O(13) from one chain and H6 atoms from L1 of a neighboring chain (H6 · · · O13 = 2.494 ˚A, A new microporous coordination polymer 303 Fig. 1.

The extended framework is con- structed from linear chains composed of Co (saccharinate)2(L1)(H2O)2 building blocks that are linked by L1 through its coordinating pyridyl nitrogen atoms. Adjacent chains are connected via the two interchain hydrogen bonds mentioned earlier to form parallel 2-D sheets in which the benzene rings of saccharinate anions protrude out in a perpendicular orientation relative to the sheets. The packing of these 2-D sheets is achieved through two types of attractive aromatic inter- actions. First, there exists face-to-face (parallel- displaced arrangement) π–π interactions between the two benzene rings of saccharinate anions from adjacent layers, with a distance of 3.77 ˚A be- tween the centers of two interacting rings. Ac- companying these interactions are edge-to-face (T-shaped arrangement) aromatic interactions be- tween the benzene rings of saccharinate anions Fig. 3. Space ﬁlling diagram of the title compound viewed down the crystallographic a-axis. Disordered guests, which occupy the channels, are not shown. and the pyridyl rings of L1 ligands from adja- cent layers, with a distance of 4.84 ˚A between the centers of the two interacting rings. The distances for the above two aromatic interactions fall within the expected ranges.37−39 Concerning the edge- to-face interaction, to the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst reported case of such an interaction involving the saccharinate anion. As revealed by a space-ﬁlling model (Fig. 3), the packing arrangement creates inﬁnite channels that run parallel to the crystallographic a-axis. Using the Squeeze program we determined that the solvent accessible volume of the channels ac- counts for roughly 23.4% of the total cell volume. The channels contain guest molecules, which due to their extreme disorder, could not be identiﬁed crystallographically. That these guest species are weakly bound to the host framework and thus eas- ily removed is evidenced by the observation that upon overnight exposure of a crystalline sample of the title compound to the atmosphere at room temperature, the clear crystalline material loses its A new microporous coordination polymer 305 transparency, indicating that at least some guest molecules are lost. Infrared analysis The infrared spectrum of the title com- pound shows characteristic saccharinate ab- sorption bands at 1625 cm−1, s[νs(C O)]; 1279 cm−1, s[νas(SO2)]; 1262 cm−1, s[δ(C O)]; and 1152 cm−1, vs[νs(SO2)]. These absorp- tions match the corresponding saccharinate bands found in the [Co(saccharinate)2·4H2O]·2H2O32 complex, a result not surprising since the saccha- rinate C O and SO2 groups in this and the ti- tle compound display similar hydrogen bonding interactions. As expected, the IR spectrum also shows a fairly strong and broad band centered at 3341 cm−1, which is due to the ν(OH) vibration of coordinated water and uncoordinated water if present in the channels of the crystalline material. Thermal analysis Thermal analysis shows a weight loss of 11.54% starting at 120◦C and ending at 165◦C, corresponding to the loss of coordinated water and uncoordinated guest molecules. Evidence that co- ordinated water molecules are also lost in this step is provided by the observation that upon heating a separate sample of the title compound for 2 h at 160◦C and atmospheric pressure, the sample changed color from orange to deep blue, indi- cating that a decrease in the coordination num- ber about Co(II) occurred during the heating. The compound is stable to 360◦C, beyond which it begins to decompose, as indicated by a series of consecutive weight loss steps. Conclusions This study describes the crystal structure and characterization of a new open-framework co- ordination polymer and demonstrates the utility of two multifunctional ligands, namely L1 and the saccharinate anion, in the construction of mi- croporous materials. We are currently studying the inclusion chemistry of the title compound and are attempting to construct other coordina- tion polymers utilizing L1 and the saccharinate anion.
