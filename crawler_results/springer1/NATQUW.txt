Manuscript ORIGINAL PAPER Synthesis, Crystal Structures, Thermal and Luminescent Properties of Rare Earth Metal Complexes with 1,2,4, 5-Benzenetetracarboxylic Acid Li Guo • Gang Wu • Hui-Hui Li Received: 16 June 2011 / Accepted: 17 November 2011 / Published online: 30 November 2011  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract [Pr(Hbtca)(H2O)] (1), [Eu(Hbtca)(H2O)] (2), [Gd(Hbtca)(H2O)] (3) (H4btca: 1, 2, 4, 5-benzenetetra- carboxlyic acid) have been synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies, elemental analysis and FT-IR. Structural determination reveals that these three complexes are isostructural. In compounds, center atoms coordinate to one ligand (Hbtca)3- and one water molecule with nine-coordinated distorted mono- capped anti-square prism geometry. Four carboxyl groups of (Hbtca)3- adopt l2–g1:g2 and l1–g1:g1 two different coordination modes. The whole ligand (Hbtca)3- acts as a l6-bridge to connect six different rare earth M(III) ions to generate a 3D network. Thermal stability of three com- plexes and luminescent property of 2 are investigated. Keywords Rare earth complex  Carboxyl group  Thermal stability  Luminescent property Introduction Coordination polymers can exhibit a variety of regulated and interesting structural topologies [1–8], as well as many potential applications in photoluminescence [9, 10], mag- netism [11, 12], catalysis [13, 14], gas storage [15, 16], nonlinear optics (NLO) [17, 18], ion exchange [19, 20], ferroelectricity [21–23], optoelectronic effect [24], and spin-transition behavior [25]. Therefore, many experi- mental and theoretical efforts have been recently attracted to the rational design and controlled synthesis of metal– organic frameworks (MOFs), from predesigned bridging ligands and metal ions [26–32]. However, there are many factors which inﬂuence on the coordination polymeric structures and properties. Even small variations of only one of the several factors inﬂuencing the synthetic process (metal ion, ligand, solvent, temperature, pH, etc.) can dramatically change the framework structure [33–35]. Therefore, it is still a great challenge for the chemists in this ﬁeld to design rational strategies for the synthesis of networks having determined compositions and structures. The topologies and properties of coordination polymers are mainly affected by the strong coordinative bonds between the metal ions and ligands. Therefore, the correct choice of metal centers and the design of the ligands play a decisive role [36, 37]. Among numerous organic ligands, the ver- satile ligands with two or more carboxylic functional groups, which can be completely or partially deprotonated, can exhibit a great variety of diverse coordination modes. In addition, the carboxylic groups have both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor properties, which is important for the formation of complexes with higher dimensionalities. Benzene di- or multicarboxylic acids, such as 1,4-benzen- edicarboxylic acid, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, which possess di or multicarboxyl groups that can rotate against their attached benzyl ring and exhibit abundant coordina- tion modes, and have been widely used for the preparation of various MOFs [38–44]. Most of the reported studies so far have focused on coordination frameworks with transition metal salts. However, in comparison with transition metal ions, lan- thanide ions have higher coordination numbers and more ﬂexible coordination geometries, resulting in more diverse structures. In addition, the lanthanide ions have narrow emission bands and relatively long (millisecond order) L. Guo  G. Wu (&)  H.-H.

Their unique lumines- cent properties are advantageous in applications such as ﬂuoroimmuno-assays, light-emitting diodes, laser systems, and optical ampliﬁcation for telecommunications. There- fore, the use of trivalent lanthanide cations for constructing MOFs has recently been a rapidly developing area [45, 46]. Herein we report the syntheses, crystal structures, charac- terizations and properties of three lanthanide coordination polymers, [Pr(Hbtca)(H2O)] (1), [Eu(Hbtca)(H2O)] (2), and [Gd(Hbtca)(H2O)] (3), constructed from ligand 1,2,4, 5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid. Experimental Materials and Physical Measurements All reagents commercially available were of reagent grade and used without further puriﬁcation. C, H elements anal- yses were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrophotometer by using KBr pellet in the range of 4,000–400 cm-1. The luminescent spectra for the solid samples were recorded at room temperature on an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrophotometer with a xenon arc lamp as the light source. In the measurements of the emission and excitation spectra, the pass width is 5.0 nm. Thermo- gravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out with a SDT Q600 instrument under 100.0 mL/min ﬂowing nitrogen, and ramp rate of 20.00 C/min from 30 to 1,000 C.

X-Ray Crystallography The crystal data collection for complexes 1, 2 and 3 were carried out on Bruker CCD ApexII diffractometer at room temperature, using graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka radi- ation (k = 0.7107 A˚ ). The structures were solved by direct method using SHELX-97 and reﬁned by full-matrix least- squares methods anisotropically for non-hydrogen atoms. The crystal parameters, data collection and reﬁnement results for the compounds are listed in Table 1. The selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table 2.

Results and Discussion Crystal Structure Complexes 1–3 were successfully isolated and character- ized. Details of the crystal structure determination of 1, 2, and 3 are summarized in Table 1. Selected interatomic distances and angles are listed in Table 2. As evidenced by the X-ray crystallographic analyses, the space group and cell parameters similar to those listed in Table 1 indicate that J Chem Crystallogr (2012) 42:192–198 193 123 these three complexes 1, 2, 3 are isomorphous and iso- structural, and thus only the structure of complex 2 is described here in detail. In complex 2, there is a carboxyl group of the H4btca is protonated, in good agreement with the IR spectral data since strong band around 1,710 cm-1 for –COOH was observed. Complex 2 crystallizes in triclinic space group P-1 and possesses a 3D coordination frame- work. [Eu(Hbtca)(H2O)] crystallizes from aqueous solution with one water molecule and one (Hbtca)3- per formula unit. Each europium cation coordinated by eight oxygen atoms from ﬁve different (Hbtca)3- anions and one oxygen atoms from one water molecule forming an irregular monocapped quadratic antiprism (Fig. 1a). The Eu1–O bond distances range from 2.333(2) to 2.576(2) A˚ . The angles of Eu–O–Eu are in the range of 51.54(6)–146.54(7)8. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. The four carboxyl groups of the H4btca are partly deprotonated, in good agreement with the IR spectral data since strong band around 1,710 cm-1 for -COOH was observed. In (Hbtca)3-, the C–O distances of the deprotonated carboxyl groups are in the range of 1.222(5)–1.274(4) A˚ , the C–O distance of protonated carboxyl group is 1.318(5) A˚ (O6–C6) in 2. The C–O distances of the deprotonated carboxyl groups are typical, in the range of 1.221(3)–1.273(3) A˚ in 1. But in the protonated carboxyl group, the C–O distance (O6–C9) is 1.315(4) A˚ . In 3, The C–O distances of the deprotonated carboxyl groups are in the range of 1.225(3)–1.269(3) A˚ , the C–O distance of protonated carboxyl group is 1.312(3) A˚ (O7–C10). In complex 2, the carboxyl groups are not coplanar with centre benzene ring. The angles between benzene ring with carboxyl groups are 80.1 (O1–C4–O2), 4.1 (O3–C5–O4), 80.1 (O5–C9–O6), 4.1 (O7–C10–O8), respectively. In other two complexes, the angles between benzene ring with carboxyl groups are close to those of 2. In anion (Hbtca)3-, four carboxyl groups take two different coordination modes (Scheme 1). Two take a l1–g1:g1 did- entate chelating mode, while the other two adopt a l2–g2:g1 coordination mode. Then the asymmetric units are linked by the l2–g2:g1-bridging carboxylate groups, to generate a 1D chain with Eu–Eu distances of 4.3127(2) and 5.8474(3) A˚´ , respectively (Fig. 1b). Further, each (Hbtca)3- ligand links three Eu(III) centers to form a 2D network (Fig. 1c). Then the 2D networks are further linked by (Hbtca)3- ligand, to generate a 3D framework structure (Fig. 1d).

The crystal cell volume decreases in the decreasing sequence of ionic radii with Pr [ Eu [ Gd. Thermogravimetric Analyses In order to examine the thermal stability of complexes 1, 2, 3, the TGA was carried out in the range of 25–1,000 C under nitrogen atmosphere. The TGA curves of 1, 2 and 3 exhibit similar steps of weight loss. The TGA curves show that the thermolytic pathways for complexes degradation involve two successive steps (Fig. 2). The weight losses of 6.02% below 415 C (calcd 4.39%) for 1, 5.73% (calcd 4.28) below 446 C for 2, 4.85% (calcd 4.22%) below 406 C for 3, correspond to the loss of one coordinated water molecule per formula and adsorption water. All complexes experimental weight loss associated with the ﬁrst step is consistent with the theoretical value corre- sponding to the complete removal of the coordinated water molecules. The second segment of the complexes 1, 2, 3 decomposition pathway corresponds to the loss of the ligand via the generation carbon dioxide and benzene.

The solid residues formed of 1, 2, 3 are suggested to be a mixture of Pr2O3, Pr2(CO3)3 for 1, Eu2O3, Eu2(CO3)3 for 2, and Gd2O3, Gd2(CO3)3 for 3 [47, 48], with some further evaporation and decomposition of M2(CO3)3 occurring at higher temperature. Luminescent Properties of [Eu(Hbtca)(H2O)] (2) The solid-state luminescence of 2 was investigated at room temperature (Fig. 3). For 2, the emission spectrum shows three main and intense emission bands in the orange and red regions with the maximum wavelengths of 590, 614 and 696 nm upon photo-excitation at 394 nm, as shown in Fig. 5, corresponding to the characteristic emission 5D0–7FJ transitions (J = 1, 2, 4) of Eu3? ions. Except for these three emission bands, two small emission bands with the maximum wavelength of 580 and 654 nm were found, which are ascribed to the characteristic emission 5D0–7FJ transitions (J = 0, 3) of Eu3? ions, respectively [49]. Conclusions In summary, the hydrothermal syntheses, crystal structures and luminescent properties of three new rare-earth poly- mers have been described. Compounds feature a 3D net- work. The whole ligand (Hbtca)3- takes as a l6-bridge to connect six different rare earth M(III) ions to generate a 3D network. Thermal stability of three complexes and lumi- nescent property of 2 are investigated.
