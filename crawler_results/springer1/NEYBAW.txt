Manuscript ORIGINAL PAPER Syntheses and Crystal Structure of Two 1D Coordination Polymers Bridged by 1,4-Bis(Imidazol-1-yl)-Butane Yong-Hong Zhou • Yu-Peng Tian Received: 19 April 2012 / Accepted: 6 November 2012 / Published online: 20 November 2012  Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012 Abstract The hydrothermal reactions of Cd(CH3COO)2 2H2O or CoCl26H2O with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl)-butane ﬂexible ligands afford two new 1D coordination polymers, namely, [Cd(2,4-D)2 (bib)]n (1) and [Co(2,4-D)2(bib)]n (2) [2,4-DH = 2,4- dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, bib = 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl)- butane]. Both complexes were characterized by elemental analysis and IR. Their crystal structures were determined by X-ray single crystal structure analysis. Both complexes crystallize in the monoclinic C2/c space group. The 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ligand acts in three different coordination modes: bidentate chelating and bis-mono- atomic bridging for 1 and monodentate for 2. Polymeric chains of 1 and 2 are composed of Cd(II) or Co(II) ions bridged by bib ligands. The ﬂuorescent property of 1 was also investigated. Keywords Crystal structure  Coordination polymer  Cobalt(II) complex  Cadmium(II) complex  24-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid Introduction Recently, considerable attention has been paid to the design and synthesis of coordination polymers not only because their intriguing variety of architectures and topologies but also owing to their potential applications in the ﬁelds of molecular-based magnets, electrical conductivity, catalysis, and zeolite-like materials [1–5]. Among various coordination polymers, the metal–organic frameworks based on carboxylate ligands are extensively studied due to their interesting molecular topologies and diverse structural properties along with potential applications as functional materials [6, 7]. To design such coordination polymers, an effective synthetic approach is based on the deliberate combination of appropriate metal ions and multifunctional ligands. As a neutral ﬂexible bifunctional ligand, bib [1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl)-butane] is widely used as an excellent spacer in the construction of coordination frameworks. It has been shown that bib can hold the energetic minimum of the system and the ﬂexible nature of spacers allows bib to bend or rotate according to the geo- metric needs of different metal ions, and this often causes the structural diversity [8–10]. The coordination chemistry of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)—a widely used herbicide, has been extensively studied and well under- stood for mono-, dinuclear complexes but few polymers [11–17]. Additionally, it possesses ﬂexibility owing to the presence of a –OCH2– spacer between the phenyl ring and carboxylate moiety. Recently, Several coordination poly- mers based on 2,4-D and N-donor ligands such as 4, 40-bipyridine, pyrazine and imidazole have been reported, and the results reveal that 2,4-D exhibit versatile binding and coordination modes [18–21]. These interesting results encourage us to explore the related mixed-ligand coordi- nation systems and to further illuminate their intrinsic assembly rule. Therefore, we describe here two new coordination polymers of Cd (II) and Co(II), 1 and 2 respectively based on 2,4-D and bib. We also investigated the ﬂuorescence of 1 in the solid state. Y.-H.

The bib was synthesized according to the literature [22]. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were performed on a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. IR spectra were recorded for KBr pellets on a Nicolet 170SX FT-IR spectrophotometer in the 4,000–400 cm-1 region. Lumi- nescence spectra were obtained with a RF-5301PC ﬂuo- rescence spectrometer. Synthesis of [Cd(2,4-D)2(bib)]n (1) The mixture of Cd(CH3COO)22H2O (0.133 g, 0.5 mmol), 2,4-DH (0.110 g, 0.5 mmol) and bib (0.095 g, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 by addition of triethylamine. Consequently, the resulting mixture was transferred and sealed in a 25 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel, which was sealed and heated at 140 C for 72 h, and then the reaction system was slowly cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 C h-1. Pale yellow crystals of 1 were collected by ﬁltration and washed with water and ethanol several times with a yield of 60 %.

Consequently, the resulting solution was transferred and sealed in a 25 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel, which was heated at 140 C for 72 h. The solution was then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 C h-1, to yield a very ﬁne pink crystalline product of 2 in 50 % yield.

X-ray Crystallography Data were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex CCD area- detector diffractometer using Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.071073 nm). Semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied using SADABS [23]. The structures were solved using direct method and reﬁned by full-matrix least- squares on F2. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms were located from the difference map, and then added geometrically. All calcu- lations were performed using the SHELXTL-97 program package [24–26]. The atoms Cl(2)/C(5)/C(6)/C(7) of the 2,4-D molecule in compound 2 are disordered over two sites, with occupancies of 0.658 and 0.342. Crystal data and experimental details for compounds 1 and 2 are pre- sented in Table 1. Selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 2. Results and Discussion IR Spectra of Complex 1 and 2 The IR spectra of 1 and 2 clearly show both the presence of 2,4-D and coordinated bib. The absence of the expected absorption at 1,690–1,730 cm-1 in 1 and 2 for the pro- tonated carboxylate groups illustrates the complete depro- tonation of the ligands in the reaction with Cadmium(II) or Cobalt(II) salts. In the IR spectrum of complex 1, strong absorptions at 1,651 and 1,556 cm-1 can be attributed to asymmetric mas(COO) stretching vibrations, and absorp- tions at 1444, 1420 cm-1 can be attributed to symmetrical ms(COO) stretching vibrations of the coordinated carbox- ylate groups, respectively. The two separations (D) between mas(COO) and ms(COO) are 231 and 112 cm-1, in which the larger and smaller D values indicate that the carboxylate groups coordinate to metal atoms in mono- atomic and bidentate chelating fashions [27, 28]. The IR spectrum of 2 shows the characteristic bands of the car- boxylate groups of the 2,4-D ligand at 1,645 cm-1 for asymmetric stretching vibration and at 1,415 cm-1 for symmetric stretching vibration. The difference between mas(COO) and ms(COO) is 230 cm-1. According to Kazou Nakamoto [29], we can infer that the carboxylate groups in 2 are in monodentate coordination modes. The strong C–O stretching vibrations at about 1,240 cm-1 in the spectra of 1 and 2 suggest that the oxygen atom from phenoxyl may not coordinate to the metal centers. These are in accor- dance with the results of X-ray diffraction analysis. Description of the Structures Structure of [Cd(2,4-D)2(bib)]n (1) Crystal structure of compound 1 is a 1D polymeric chain of Cd(II) ion. As shown in Fig. 1, each pair of Cd(II) atoms is linked by two monoatomic carboxylate bridges. Each of the Cd(II) atoms is further coordinated by one additional che- lating terminal carboxylate, and two N-donors from two bib Fig. 1 ORTEP view of 1 showing the local coordination environment of the Cd(II) atom with hydrogen atoms omitted for clarity (20 % probability displacement ellipsoid) Fig. 2 View of the 1D double- chain arrangements of the complex 1 J Chem Crystallogr (2013) 43:31–35 33 123 ligands, forming two equivalent but distorted CdN2O4 octa- hedron joined at their shared side. The most distorted angle in the octahedron around the Cd(II) atom O(4)–Cd(1)– O(5) = 52.53(14) produces signiﬁcant differences in the coordination sphere with respect to regular octahedral coor- dination. The bond distances of Cd(1)–N(2) [2.262(5) A˚ ], Cd(1)–N(4) [2.270(4) A˚ ], Cd(1)–O(1) [2.324(4) A˚ ], Cd(1)– O(4) [2.346(4) A˚ ], Cd(1)–O(1A) [2.353(4) A˚ ], and Cd(1)– O(5) [2.579(4) A˚ ] are comparable with those of other Cd(II) complexes [30]. Adjacent binuclear units are joined together by bib ligands to form a 1D double-chain structure (Fig. 2). The most interesting observation in complex 1 is the symmetric monodentate acetato bridge, which is rarely observed in carboxylate coordination chemistry [31], in particular in cadmium carboxylate chemistry due to the larger radius of the Cd(II) atom. The difference (41.5) between the bond angles Cd(1)–O(1)–C(1) [146.5(3)] and Cd(1A)–O(1)–C(1) [105.0(3)] indicates signiﬁcant tilt of the carboxylate toward Cd(1A). Structure of [Co(2,4-D)2(bib)]n (2) Complex 2 also has a 1D structure, but the local coordi- nation geometry around the Co(II) ion is a distorted tetrahedron with N2O2 donor set (Fig. 3). This conﬁgura- tion is similarly adopted by [Co(5-iipa)(bib)3(H2O)]n (5- iipa = 5-iodo-isophthalic acid) [32], [Co3(SIP)2(bix)4(2- H2O)2H2O]n [SIP = 5-sulfoisophthalic acid monosodium salt, bix = 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-benzene] [33] and [Co2(OA)(bib)2]3H2O(H4OA = 3,30,4,40-oxidiphtha- lic acid) [34]. Two N donors from two different bib ligands coordinate to Co(II) ions with the Co–N distances of 2.017(4) A˚ . The N(2)–Co–N(2A) bond angle is 98.7(2). The other two positions are occupied by two O atoms from two different 2,4-D ligands in monodendate mode with the Co–O distance of 1.950(3) A˚ . The O(1)–Co–O(1A) bond angle is 94.6(2), and O–Co–N bond angles range from 111.25(16) to 121.45(15). The salient structural feature of compound 2 is that each bib possesses trans conforma- tion linking adjacent Co(II) ions to form an inﬁnite chain structure with Co–Co distance of 14.038 A˚ . The chains are decorated with 2,4-D ligands alternately at two sides in an outward fashion, as depicted in Fig. 4. Photoluminescent Property of 1 Coordination polymers with d10 metal centers and organic ligands are currently of great interest because of their various applications in chemical sensors, photochemistry, Fig. 3 Perspective view of the coordination environments of Co(II) in 2 with thermal ellipsoids at 20 % probability (hydrogen atoms and the minor disordered part have been left out for clarity) Fig. 4 The one-dimensional chain structure of complex 2 Fig. 5 Solid state emission spectra of bib, 2,4-D and complex 1 at room temperature 34 J Chem Crystallogr (2013) 43:31–35 123 and electroluminescent display [35]. In this paper, the solid state photoluminescent property of compound 1 has been investigated in the solid state at room temperature. Two emission peaks at about 395 nm (kex = 250 nm) and 392 nm (kex = 227 nm) were observed for free bib and 2,4-D. The emission bands for these free ligands are probably attributable to the p* ? n or p* ? p transitions. On complexation of these ligands with Cd(II) ions, intense ﬂuorescent emission occurs at 454 nm (kex = 280 nm) for 1 (Fig. 5). The emissions arising from the free ligands are not observable for compound 1. The absence of ligand- based emission suggests energy transfer from the ligands to the Cd(II) centers during photoluminescence. Thus, the photoluminescence can be attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transitions [36].
