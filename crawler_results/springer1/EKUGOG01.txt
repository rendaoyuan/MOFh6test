Manuscript Solvothermal Synthesis, Crystal Structure and DNA Binding Studies of a 3D Supramolecular Complex {[Cu(phen)CN][Cu(phen)][Cu(CN)2]}n Assembled by Double Curvy Chains Feng-Ying Dong Æ Yan-Tuan Li Æ Zhi-Yong Wu Æ Yun-Ming Sun Æ Wei Sun Æ Zhi-Qiang Liu Æ Yu-Lan Song Received: 11 March 2008 / Accepted: 16 April 2008 / Published online: 30 May 2008  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008 Abstract A new cyano-bridged copper (I) complex {[Cu(phen)CN][Cu(phen)][Cu(CN)2]}n (1) (phen = 1,10- phenanthroline) was synthesized under the solvothermal conditions, and characterized by elemental analysis, FI-IR spectra and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure analysis reveals that complex 1 contains two [Cu(phen)CN] [Cu(phen)][Cu(CN)2] subunits, being, respectively, con- structed into two chains with different cyano backbones. The resulting chains offer a double curvy chain by CuCu weak interactions and p–p stacking interactions. It is exciting that the double curvy chains adopt anti-parallel array and result in a novel 3D architecture through p–p stacking interactions. According to the supramolecular self-assembly of complex 1, four types of stacking mode of phenanthroline moieties are given and discussed. Absorp- tion and ﬂuorescence titration studies of complex 1 with calf thymus DNA are suggestive of the intercalation binding mode with a intrinsic binding constant of 7.52 9 103 M-1 and a linear Stern-Volmer quenching constant of 1.02 9 105 M-1.

The metal complexes can interact with nucleic acids by noncovalent interactions, such as p–p stacking interactions, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Especially, p–p stacking interactions are some strongly attractive act- ing forces because they can control such diverse phenomena as the vertical base–base interactions which stabilize the double curvy structure of DNA [9], the intercalation of drugs into DNA [9, 10], the tertiary structures of proteins [11], the conformational preferences and binding properties of poly-aromatic macrocycle [12], the complexation in many host–guest systems [13], and porphyrin aggregations [14]. One of the good bidentate ligands, 1,10-phenanthro- line (phen), has injected much energy in burgeoning supramolecular chemistry, owing to its large aromatic system, which may easily present p–p stacking force in the crystal [15]. Furthermore, the copper complexes of phe- nanthroline are extremely useful for the construction and characterization of DNA binding mode owning to their intense optical absorption and emission [16, 17]. Based on the above consideration, we synthesized a novel 3D supramolecular cyano-bridged copper(I) complex by the reactions of CuCl22H2O with phenanthroline and Na2[Fe(CN)5NO]2H2O under the solvothermal conditions, namely {[Cu(phen)CN][Cu(phen)][Cu(CN)2]}n (1), in which F.-Y.

The binding studies of the complex with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) are explored by using electronic absorption spectra and emission spectra mea- surements. To our best knowledge, up to now, only 27 cyano-bridged copper complexes containing phenanthro- line have been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and none of them are involved with the studies of DNA binding properties [18, 19]. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Chemicals CT-DNA was obtained from the Sigma Company. All other reagents and solvents were purchased commercially (A.R. grade) and were used as received unless otherwise noted. Tris–HCl buffer solution (pH = 7.66, Tris = tris(hydroxy methyl)aminomethane) was prepared usingredistilled water. 2.2 Physical Measurements The C, H and N microanalyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240 elemental analyzer. Infrared spectrum was recorded on a Nicolet-470 spectrophotometer in the spectral range 4000–400 cm-1 as KBr pellets. The electronic spectrum was measured on a Cary 300 spectro- photometer. The ﬂuorescence spectra were measured with Fp-750w Fluorometer. 2.3 Synthesis of Complex {[Cu(phen)CN][Cu(phen)][Cu(CN)2]}n (1) CuCl22H2O (1 mmol, 0.170 g) and Na2[Fe(CN)5NO]2H2O (1 mmol, 0.298 g) were solved in 10 mL deionized water, to which the solution of 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mmol, 0.198 g) in 6 mL ethanol was added. After stirred for about 20 min, the mixture was transferred into a 25 mL Teﬂon-lined reactor and heated at a rate of 25 C per hour. The mixture was heated at 150 C for 3 days under autogenous pressure. Upon cooling to room temperature at a rate of 20 C per hour, dark red block crystals of 1 were obtained.

Selected IR bands (cm): 2118(m), 2098(s), 1577(w), 1425(m), 843(s), 771(m), 723(s). 2.4 Determination of X-ray Crystal Structure The X-ray diffraction experiment for complex 1 was made on a Bruker Smart-1000 CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated MoKa (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) radiation at the temperature of 298(2) K. Data collection, cell reﬁnement, data reduction and correction for absorption are all per- formed using Bruker programs [20]. The structures were solved by direct method and expanded using Fourier techniques with Shelxl-97 program [21]. The non-hydro- gen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically by full-matrix least-squares calculations on F2. The C-bound H atoms were placed in calculated positions, with C–H distance of 0.93 A˚ , and reﬁned as riding, with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C). Detailed information about crystal data and structure determinations is summarized in Table 1. 2.5 DNA Binding Experiments All experiments involving CT-DNA were performed in Tris–HCl buffer solution. Stock solution of CT-DNA was stored at 4 C and used in not more than 4 days. A solution of CT-DNA in the buffer gave a ratio value of UV absor- bance at 260 and 280 nm of about 1.9, indicating that the DNA was sufﬁciently independent of protein [22]. The CT-DNA concentration per nucleotide was determined by absorption spectroscopy using the absorption coefﬁcient Table 1 Summary of crystallographic data for complex 1 Empirical formula C54H32Cu6N14 Color/shape Dark red/block Formula weight 1258.18 Crystal size (mm) 0.38 9 0.33 9 0.16 Temperature (K) 298(2) Crystal system Monoclinic Space group P2(1)/c a (A˚ ) 35.528 (2) b (A˚ ) 9.26920 (11) c (A˚ ) 14.9734 (16) b () 90.203 (2) V (A˚ 3) 4931.0 (6) Z 7 Dcalc (g cm-3) 1.316 Absorption coefﬁcient (mm-1) 0.324 Absorption correction SADABS Completeness to theta = 25.01 99.7% Maximum and minimum transmission 0.9499 and 0.8866 Data/restraints/parameters 8649/0/667 F(000) 314 Theta range () 1.15–25.01 Reﬂection collected 23191 Independent reﬂections 8649 Goodness-of-ﬁt on F2 1.086 R1, wR2 [I [ 2r(I)] 0.0519, 0.1188 R1, wR2 (all data) 0.0933, 0.1432 Largest diff. peak and hole (e A˚ -3) 0.645, -0.492 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2008) 18:398–406 399 123 (6600 M-1 cm-1) at 260 nm [23]. Absorption titrations were performed by adding increments of the CT-DNA solution to the complex 1 solution with a ﬁxed concen- tration. Complex–DNA solutions were allowed to incubate for 10 min before the absorption spectra were recorded. The ﬂuorescence titration experiment was performed by keeping the concentration of complex 1 constant while varying the CT-DNA concentration. The ﬂuorescence spectra of complex 1 were recorded by using the excitation wavelength of 258 nm and an emission wavelength of 365 nm. Fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out with CT-DNA pretreated with ethidium bromide (EB) in dark for over 2 h. To the pretreated CT-DNA solution various amounts of complex 1 solution were added and their effect on the emission intensity was measured. Sam- ples were excited at 522 nm and the emission was observed between 560 and 610 nm. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Synthesis Generally, this kind of cyano-bridged copper(I) complexes are synthesized using two methods. One is directly making Cu(CN) react with organoamine ligands [24], the other is using redox reaction between copper(II) salts with K3[Fe(CN)6] and organoamines via hydrothermal method [18, 25]. In the present experiment, we used CuCl22H2O, Na2[Fe(CN)5NO], phenH2O, CH3CH2OH and H2O in a molar ratio of 1:1:1:105:556 at 150 C to gain complex 1. However, Yu et al. obtained its isomer using Cu(CH3- COO)2H2O, K3[Fe(CN)6], phenH2O, and H2O in a different molar ratio of 2:1:1.5:300 at 160 C [26]. Liu and Ng gained another complex [Cu3(CN)3(phen)]n by the hydrothermal synthesis of CuCl22H2O, K3[Fe(CN)6], phenH2O, and H2O in a molar ratio of 1:1:1:833 at 403 K [27]. Obviously, the molar ratio of reactants, reaction temperature and other reaction conditions can inﬂuence the self-assembly of complex in the hydrothermal or solvo- thermal reactions. In this experiment, copper(II) ion is readily reduced to copper(I) by the cyanide under the high temperature and pressure. Copper(II) can oxidize cyanides to CuI(CN)3 2- and cyanogens (CN)2 on the stopped-ﬂow time scale [25]. A reasonable mechanism for the formation of complex 1 may be as follows: Fe CN ð Þ5NO  2þ 3phen ! Fe phen ð Þ3þ 3 þ 5CN þ NO 2CuII þ 8CN ! 2CuI CN ð Þ3 2 þ CN ð Þ2 CuI CN ð Þ3 2 þ CN !

Selected bond lengths and bond Fig. 1 The asymmetric structure unit of complex 1 with 20% probability ellipsoids 400 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2008) 18:398–406 123 angles of complex 1 are listed in Table 2. X-ray analysis reveals that complex 1 consists of a series of double curvy chains in which –CuCN–CuCN– and –CuCN–CuNC– act as two kinds of backbones with phen– and (phen)CuCN– side arms arranging alternatively along each backbone. The asymmetric structure unit of complex 1 contains six crys- tallographically independent copper(I) atoms, six cyano groups, and four chelate phenanthroline ligands. These form two [Cu(phen)CN][Cu(phen)] [Cu(CN)2] subunits. The coordination geometries of Cu1 and Cu4 are similar and both highly distorted tetrahedron with a wide range of bond angles of 78.02(19)–124.4(2) and 78.2(2)–124.3(3), respectively. Each of them is coordinated by one phenanthroline as side arm. The remaining coordi- nation sites of Cu1 are occupied by one N and one C atom from two cyano groups, but Cu4 atom is bound by two C atoms. Cu2 and Cu5 atoms are both coordinated by three atoms of bridging cyano. The relative angles range from 111.8(2) to 132.6(2), indicating the slightly distorted tri- gonal planes of Cu2N2C and Cu5N3 groups. In addition, Cu3 and Cu6 atoms are similar in coordination environment. Both are trigonally coordinated by two N atoms of one phen and one C atom of cyano to form (phen)CuCN– side arms. All Cu–N (phen), Cu–N (cyano) and Cu–C distances fall into the range of 2.021(5)–2.156(5), 1.919(6)–1.966(6) and 1.851(7)–1.904(6) A˚ , respectively, which are very reason- able and well compared with those of reported complex [25, 26]. As shown in Fig. 2, two [Cu(phen)CN][Cu(phen)] [Cu(CN)2] subunits, respectively, repeat permutation along the crystallographic c-axis to form two single chains. The resulting chains offer a double curvy chain by CuCu weak interactions and p–p stacking interactions. The CuCu interaction occurs between Cu3 and Cu6 with a distance of ca. 3.26 A˚ . This value is slightly longer than the reported (3.18 A˚ ) [28]. The p–p interaction is stacked by two phe- nanthroline moieties severally bound to Cu3 and Cu6. It is very exciting that p–p stacking interactions are not only intra-chain but also inter-chain. In 2004, we have success- fully given two kinds of stacking mode of naphthylene groups [29]. Herein, four types of stacking mode of phe- nanthroline moieties are observed and discussed as follows. 3.2.2 p–p Stacking Interactions To unequivocally describe the relative orientation of two stacked moieties, the deﬁnition of geometrical parameters is given in Fig. 4a. The data of p–p stacking interaction in complex 1 are summarized in Table 3, in which the interplanar separation (h) and dihedral angle (a) of the Fig. 2 The double curvy chain along the crystallographic c-axis in complex 1: (a) ellipsoid diagram; (b) space ﬁlling representation Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for complex 1a Cu1–N1 2.156(5) Cu4–C54#2 1.877(7) Cu1–N2 2.113(5) Cu5–N12 1.924(7) Cu1–N7#1 1.963(6) Cu5–N13 1.927(6) Cu1–C25 1.894(7) Cu5–N14 1.966(6) Cu2–N5 1.972(6) Cu6–N10 2.081(6) Cu2–N6 1.919(6) Cu6–N11 2.026(5) Cu2–C27 1.875(6) Cu6–C53 1.852(7) Cu3–N3 2.021(6) N5–C25 1.156(8) Cu3–N4 2.087(5) N6–C26 1.148(8) Cu3–C26 1.851(7) N7–C27 1.151(7) Cu4–N8 2.117(5) N12–C52 1.149(7) Cu4–N9 2.127(5) N13–C53 1.140(8) Cu4–C52 1.904(6) N14–C54 1.160(8) C25–Cu1–N1 126.0(2) C54#2–Cu4–N9 103.6(2) N2–Cu1–N1 78.02(19) C52–Cu4–N9 114.0(2) N7#1–Cu1–N1 100.74(19) N8–Cu4–N9 78.2(2) C25–Cu1–N2 105.5(2) N12–Cu5–N13 130.5(2) N7#1–Cu1–N2 112.7(2) N12–Cu5–N14 117.6(2) C25–Cu1–N7#1 124.4(2) N13–Cu5–N14 111.8(2) C27–Cu2–N5 112.2(2) C53–Cu6–N11 149.9(3) 6–Cu2–N5 115.1(2) C53–Cu6–N10 128.7(3) C27–Cu2–N6 132.6(2) N11–Cu6–N10 81.3(2) N3–Cu3–N4 81.6(2) N5–C25–Cu1 172.7(6) C26–Cu3–N4 131.5(3) N6–C26–Cu3 177.5(7) C26–Cu3–N3 146.8(3) N7–C27–Cu2 173.7(5) C54#2–Cu4–C52 124.3(3) N12–C52–Cu4 173.4(5) C54#2–Cu4–N8 123.0(3) N13–C53–Cu6 175.4(7) C52–Cu4–N8 104.3(2) N14–C54–Cu4#3 172.3(7) a Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms: #1 x, -y + 3/2, z - 1/2; #2 x, -y - 1/2, z - 1/2; #3 x, -y - 1/2, z + 1/2 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2008) 18:398–406 401 123 stacking groups are given. The slip angle (h) is deﬁned by the vector passing through the centroid of the aromatic groups in each stack with the normal to the best plane of those groups and calculated by the equation cos h = h/d. Centroid displacement (r) is calculated by r2 = d2 - h2. There exist four types of stacking interaction between phenanthroline moieties in complex 1. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the stacking style I occurs between two single- stranded chains and extends along crystallographic c-axis to contribute to the formation of double curvy chain. The plane of Cu3-bound phenanthroline (Cu3-phen) is nearly parallel to that of the Cu6-bound phenanthroline (Cu6- phen) with the interplanar separation of 3.492 A˚ . However, the sharp centroid–centroid distance (5.342 A˚ ), centroid displacement (4.042 A˚ ) and slip angle (49.17) indicate the p–p interactions in such an extended p system may only involve part of the ring system [30]. The N4-containing pyridine ring (N4-py) of Cu3-phen and N10-containing pyridine ring (N10-py) of Cu6-phen overlap with a near zero centroid displacement and favorable centroid–centroid distance of 3.533 A˚ , indicating these two pyridine moieties take part in the p–p stacking. This stacking style is similar to the pyridine–pyridine-type approach of stacked quino- line molecules [30]. Besides the above stacking interaction, Cu3-phen also stacks with the other Cu6-phen (symmetry code: x - 1/2, -y + 1/2, z - 1/2) of the adjacent double curvy chain. The arranging manner and related data reveal that only quinoline part of phenanthroline participates in the stack- ing interaction. This quinoline–quinoline-type stacking approach, namely style II, is present along the crystallo- graphic b-axis and makes double curvy chains construct into a 2D network (Fig. 3a). Because of the similar coordination environment of Cu1 and Cu4 atoms and the anti-parallel arrangement of curvy chains, Cu1-phen and Cu4-phen moieties adopt the ana- logical stacking styles, i.e. the stacking style III and IV (Fig. 4c). Take Cu1-phen moiety for example, in the stacking style III, two stacked Cu1-phen moieties (sym- metry code: -x, -y + 2, -z + 1) give the opposite orientation due to the electron-withdrawing perturbation of N heteroatom within the ring and hence inducing differ- entiation of electrons distributions. The centroid–centroid distance is 3.608 A˚ , the slip angle is 11.40 and the cen- troid displacement is only 0.713 A˚ , near to those of a perfect face-to-face alignment. The interplanar separation of 3.537 A˚ falls into 3.3–3.8 A˚ , indicating the moderate stacking interactions [30]. This kind of phenanthroline– Table 3 Data of p–p stacking interactions in complex 1a,b Stacking styles Stacking groups Dihedral angle, a/ Interplanar separation, h/A˚ Centroid–centroid (or atom–centroid) distance, d/A˚ Centroid displacement, r/A˚ Slip angle, h/ I N4-py and N10-py 3 3.434 3.533 0.832 13.59 Cu3-phen and Cu6-phen 2.3 3.492 5.342 4.042 49.17 II N4-quin and N10-quin 7.6 3.507 3.738 1.290 20.25 Cu3-phen and Cu6-phen 9.1 3.696 4.961 3.309 41.80 III Cu1-phen and Cu1-phen 0 3.537 3.608 (3.514 for H9, 3.646 for H10) 0.713 11.40 Cu4-phen and Cu4-phen 0 3.627 3.756 (3.665 for H36, 3.789 for H37) 0.973 15.01 IV Cu1-phen and Cu1-phen 31.2 4.994 6.052 (2.873 for H9, 2.947 for H10) 3.418 34.39 Cu4-phen and Cu4-phen 29.4 4.957 6.068 (3.035 for H36, 2.997 for H37) 3.500 35.22 a Symmetry codes: II, x - 1/2, -y + 1/2, z - 1/2; III, -x, -y + 2, -z + 1; IV, -x + 1/2, y + 1/2, -z + 1/2 b py = pyridine; phen = phenanthroline; N4-py represents a N4-containing pyridine moiety of phenanthroline; N4-quin represents a N4–containing quinoline moiety of phenanthroline; Cu1-phen represents a Cu1-binding phenanthroline Fig. 3 The 3D supramolecular architecture of the double curvy chains in complex 1: (a) along the crystallographic b-axis; (b) along the crystallographic a- axis 402 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2008) 18:398–406 123 phenanthroline offset approach involves two parallel ring planes with an slight centroid displacement and the whole p system of phenanthroline, and distinguishes from that found in complex Dichloro-bis(1,10-phenanthroline)- iron(III)tetrachloro-(1,10-phenanthroline)ferrate(III) aceto- nitrile solvate [31]. As for the stacking style IV, two international ring planes of Cu1-phen and Cu1-phen (symmetry code: -x + 1/2, y + 1/2, -z + 1/2) lie at an angle of more than 20, making clear its not regular offset p–p stacking [30]. This can be validated by the very long centroid–centroid distance (6.052 A˚ ) and the big slip angle (34.39). However, the atom– centroid distance of H9 and H10 are both\3.0 A˚ , which is obviously smaller than those of stacking style III. So this kind of aromatic interaction is intermediate between an offset p–p stacking and an edge-on pd interaction, leading to a herringbone appearance of the stacks [32]. Thus complex 1 is further assembled into a 3D supramolecular architecture by means of inter-chain stacking interactions of style III and IV along the crystallographic b-axis (Fig. 3b). 3.3 DNA Binding Studies 3.3.1 Electronic Absorption Titration Electronic absorption spectroscopy is an effective method to determine the binding mode of the metal complex with DNA. In general, the observation of hypochromism red Fig. 4 Stacking interactions in complex 1. (a) Deﬁnition of geometrical parameters of two stacked fragments. (b) Stacking style I and II.

The electronic absorption spectra of complex 1 in the absence and presence of CT-DNA are given in Fig. 5a, the complex 1 do not exhibit the intense d–d or charge transfer band to monitor their interaction with CT-DNA. So the intense ligand based on the (p ? p*) absorption band centered at the 269 nm is employed to monitor the complex 1 inter- action with DNA. With the increasing concentration of CT-DNA, it shows a signiﬁcant decrease ([DNA]/[com- plex] = 6, 13.86%) in molar absorptivity (hypochromism) as well as a slight red shift (1 nm), suggesting a binding mode of intercalation involving the stacking interaction between phen chromophore of complex 1 and the CT-DNA base pairs. Similar spectral characteristics and partially intercalative interaction also are observed for tris-chelated Ru(II) complexes of phen ligand [34]. In order to determine quantitatively binding afﬁnity of complex 1 with DNA, the DNA binding characteristics of complex 1, the intrinsic binding constant Kb is be deter- mined from the spectral titration data by Eq. 1 [35]: DNA=ðea  efÞ ¼ ½DNA=ðea  efÞ þ 1=Kbðea  efÞ ð1Þ where [DNA] is the concentration of CT-DNA; ef, ea and eb correspond to the extinction coefﬁcient, respectively, for the free complex 1, for each addition of CT-DNA to the complex 1 solution and for complex 1 in the fully bound form. The plot of [DNA]/(ea - ef) versus [DNA] gives the Kb value as the ratio of slope to the intercept. According to the plot in Fig. 5b, the intrinsic binding constant Kb for complex 1 is estimated as 7.52 9 103 M-1 (R = 0.9934 for six points), which is between the values of complex [Cu(phen)(L-Thr)(H2O)]ClO4 (L-Thr = L-threonine) (Kb, 6.35 9 103 M-1) [35] and [Ru(bpy)2ppd]2+ (ppd = pteri- dino[7,6-f][1,10]phenanthroline-1,13(10H,12H)-dione) (Kb, 1.3 9 106 M-1) [36]. This indicates complex 1 is a mod- erate binder of CT-DNA. 3.3.2 Fluorescence Titration Experiments The ﬂuorescence titration experiment has been widely used to characterize the interaction of complexes with DNA, by following the changes in ﬂuorescence intensity of the complexes. As shown in Fig. 6a, complex 1 emits strong ﬂuorescence in Tris–HCl buffer at ambient temperature, with a maximum at 365 nm. With addition of CT-DNA, the emission intensities of complex 1 gradually decrease, indicating that there exists strong interaction between the complex 1 and CT-DNA. The ﬂuorescence quenching behavior of the complex by DNA may be attributed to the photoelectron transfer from the guanine base of CT-DNA to the excited MLCT state of the complex, as reported in the case of [Co(bzimpy)2] (bzimpy = 2,6-bis(benzimi- dazo-2-yl) pyridine) [37] and [Ru(tap)3]2+ (tap = 1,4,5,8- tetraazaphenanthrene) [38]. In order to further investigate the interaction between complex 1 and CT-DNA, the EB ﬂuorescence displacement experiment has been employed. EB was known to emit intense ﬂuorescence light in presence of DNA due to the strong intercalation between adjacent DNA base pairs. The ﬂuorescent light of EB–DNA system can be quenched by the addition of a second agent (quencher), which is often regarded as the characteristic of intercalation [39]. The quenching degree of ﬂuorescence for EB–DNA system is usually used to determine the binding extent of the quencher and DNA. The ﬂuorescence spectra of EB–DNA system in the absence and presence of complex 1 are given in Fig. 6b. The ﬂuorescence intensity at 584 nm shows a remarkable decreasing with the increase of complex 1, which indicates that some EB molecules are replaced by Fig. 5 (a) Absorption spectra of complex 1 in Tris–HCl buffer at pH = 7.66, in the absence (A) and in the presence of increasing amounts of [DNA] (B–G). [Complex] = 1.0 9 10-5 M, [DNA] = 1.0–6.0 9 10-5 M. Arrow shows the absorbance change upon increasing DNA concentration. (b) Plot of [DNA]/(ea - ef) versus [DNA] for complex 1.

This behavior is analyzed through the Stern–Vol- mer equation (2) [40]: I0 = I ¼ 1 þ KSV ½Q ð2Þ where I0 and I represent the ﬂuorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively. [Q] is the concentration of quencher. KSV is a linear Stern–Volmer quenching constant and its value is given by the ratio of the slope to intercept in the quenching plot of I0/I versus [complex] (Fig. 6c). The KSV value for complex 1 is 1.02 9 105 M-1 (R = 0.9956 for eleven points) and lower than that of complex [Ru(bpy)2ppd]2+] (KSV, 1.4 9 106 M-1) [36], indicating the binding extend for the former is smaller than that of the latter. The results of the ﬂuores- cence titration experiments match well with that of the electronic absorption spectral experiments. 4 Conclusions The reactions of CuCl22H2O with Na2[Fe(CN)5NO]2H2O and 1,10-phenanthroline under the solvothermal conditions give one cyano-bridged copper(I) complex {[Cu(phen)CN] [Cu(phen)][Cu(CN)2]}n. The single-crystal X-ray diffrac- tion analysis reveals that the complex is assembled into a novel 3D supramolecular architecture through p–p stacking interactions. In the polymeric supramolecular array of complex, the adjacent phenanthroline moieties interplay by means of four types of p–p stacking mode, i.e. pyridine– pyridine-type offset; quinoline–quinoline-type offset; phe- nanthroline–phenanthroline-type offset and a herringbone array. The measurements of electronic absorption spectra and emission spectra for the complex show a signiﬁcant decrease in molar absorptivity with slight red shift and the ﬂuorescence quenching behavior to EB–DNA system, suggesting the moderately intercalative interaction with partial insertion of the aromatic system between adjacent base pairs on the CT-DNA duplex. The intrinsic binding constant of the complex is 7.52 9 103 M-1 and the linear Stern–Volmer quenching constant is 1.02 9 105 M-1. 5 Supplementary Material Crystallographic data for the structural analysis of complex 1 has been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, CCDC No. 672502.
