Due to their high nitrogen content, triazole and its derivatives are also widely used as energetic materials [9–12]. As one of the derivatives of triazole, 3,5-bis-pyridyl-1-H-1,2,4-triazole serves as an N,N′-donor ligand and acts as a bridging ligand, thus mediating exchange coupling. Furthermore, the proto- tropy and conjugation between the 1H-1,2,4-triazole and pyridyl groups alter the electron density in different sections of the molecules, making the ligand more flexible [13, 14]. In addition, the different possible positions of the pyridyl nitrogen atoms endow the ligands (Scheme 1) with versatile coordination modes, facilitating the formation of different topological structures [15]. Ammonium perchlorate (AP) is the most common oxi- dizer in composite solid propellants and the thermal de- composition characteristics of AP directly influence the combustion behavior of such solid propellants [16, 17]. The reaction rate and pyrolysis temperature of the thermal de- composition of AP are closely related to the combustion rate of the solid propellants, with lower pyrolysis tempera- tures resulting in faster combustion rates. In order to study the effects of compounds containing Hbpt on the thermal decomposition of AP, we chose co- balt(II) ions as the coordination center and pyromellitic acid 444 Xie G, et al. Sci China Chem March (2012) Vol.55 No.3 Scheme 1 The positionally isomeric bridging ligands. (H4pm) as an auxiliary ligand on the basis of the following considerations: (1) the cobalt(II) ion shows good catalytic performance for the decomposition of propellants [18]; (2) H4pm can improve the oxygen balance of propellant com- ponents [19–21]. Moreover, H4pm is a good candidate for the construction of MOFs through full or partial deprotona- tion [22–24]. In this paper, we report the syntheses and structures of three cobalt(II) coordination compounds with Hbpt isomers in the presence of the H4pm ligand, namely, [Co(3,3′-Hbpt)2(H2pm)(H2O)2]·2H2O (1), [Co(4,4′-Hbpt) (pm)0.5(H2O)]·3H2O (2) and [Co(3,4′-Hbpt)(pm)0.5(H2O)3]· 2H2O (3). Furthermore, the catalytic performances of 1–3 in the thermal decomposition of AP were explored. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Commercially available reagents were used as received without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were performed on a Vario EL III analyzer. Infrared spectra were obtained using KBr pellets on a BEQ VZNDX 550 FTIR instrument within the 400–4000 cm–1 region. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 400 instru- ment using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Thermal analyses were performed on a NETZSCH STA 449C instrument under an atmosphere of hydrostatic air at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. Differential scanning calorime- try (DSC) experiments were performed on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 6 DSC thermal analyzer (calibrated using pure indium and zinc as standards) from 50 to 500 °C. 2.2 Synthesis of Hbpt The 3,3′-Hbpt ligand was synthesized via an in situ met- al/ligand reaction and demetallation as follows (Scheme 2): A mixture of 3-cyanopyridine (1.04 g, 10.0 mmol), aqueous ammonia (1.0 mL), Cu(NO3)2·6H2O (0.296 g, 1.0 mmol) and water (5 mL) was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined auto- clave and treated at 140 °C for 60 h. The resulting mixture was filtered to give crystalline [Cu2(bpt)2] in 40% yield based on 3-cyanopyridine. The product then underwent a process of demetallation: The as-synthesized [Cu2(bpt)2] was placed in a 200 mL flask containing 100 mL of water, into which 2 mL of ammonium sulfide solution was added dropwise with stirring. After 0.5 h, the solution was boiled and filtered to give a colorless solution and then concen- trated to afford 3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole (3,3′- Hbpt) (260 mg, 25.0% based on 3-cyanopyridine).

Sci China Chem March (2012) Vol.55 No.3 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis 1,2,4-triazoles and their derivatives are generally prepared by multi-step procedures, which usually involve hydrazine derivatives as starting agents [29–31]. Since in situ met- al/ligand reactions show great merits in both coordination chemistry and organic synthesis [32–34], herein, 3,5- bispyridyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole has been synthesized via an in situ metal/ligand reaction, using a coordination compound as an intermediate. Such an approach not only represents a widely applicable nonhydrazine-based synthetic route for triazolates but also simplifies the synthesis and purification processes. 3.2 Structural analysis Single crystal X-ray analysis shows that 1 has a one- dimensional (1D) array structure. The asymmetric unit of 1 has one crystallographically independent Co(II) center, dis- playing a slightly distorted octahedral geometry involving coordination to two O atoms from H2pm2, two coordinated water molecules in the equatorial plane and two N atoms from two 3,3′-Hbpt ligands in the axial position (Figure 1(a)). The H2pm2– ligand acts as a bis(monodentate) mode to link the adjacent metal ions through its deprotonated carboxylic groups. It is worth noting that the 3,3′-Hbpt is not deprotonated, and a (4,4) topological layer is formed by the parallel 1D neighboring chains using O–H∙∙∙∙hydrogen bonding interactions between carboxylic groups and nitro- gen atoms of the 3,3′-Hbpt (Figure 1(b)). To examine the effect of positional isomerism on the structure, 2 was synthesized in the presence of 4,4′-Hbpt. The asymmetric unit of 2 consists of a pair of Co(II) ions, one Hbpt, one coordinated water molecule, half a pyro- mellitate ligand, and three free water molecules (Figure 2(a)). Co1 adopts a distorted octahedral geometry with two water molecules in trans apical position (Co1–O5 0.2105 (25) nm), two oxygen atoms from two different monoden- tate carboxylate groups (Co1–O2 0.2069(18) nm) and two nitrogen atoms of two Hbpt molecules (Co1–N2 0.2186 (27) nm) in the basal plane, in which the cobalt(II) ion and the basal atoms are absolutely coplanar. Meanwhile, Co2 lies on the symmetry center, and shows an elongated oc- tahedral coordination environment with axial Co2–N1 bonds of length 0.2163(22) nm to two Hbpt ligands, with the basal four oxygen atoms coming from two pairs of neighboring carboxylic groups (Co2–O1 0.2104(25), Co2–O4 0.2089(21) nm). In 2, H4pm is completely depro- tonated and exhibits monodentate and bis(monodentate) coordination modes. The pm4– moieties connect the Co(II) ions giving a two-dimensional (2D) layer pattern with (4,4) network topology, in which the grid size is 0.989 nm × 1.06 nm (Figure 2(b)).These sheets are further linked by Hbpt ligands along the c axis to form a pillared-grid three- dimensional (3D) open framework with 1D open channels. From a topological point of view, 2 can be described as a 3D NbO network with (64.82) topology. Surprisingly, there are three uncoordinated water mole- cules in every primary channel unit (Figure 2(c)). A calcu- lation using PLATON [35] leads to a potential solvent area of 0.1686 nm3 per unit cell volume of 0.9525 nm3, namely 17.7% of the total crystal volume. In view of such a low cavity ratio, the channel is filled by free water molecules, which can be attributed to larger space occupation and the longer distance of the bi-pillar shutters [36]. 3 is a 2D coordination polymer. The Co(II) ion is six- coordinated in a distorted octahedral coordination geometry by one oxygen atom from pm4, two pyridyl nitrogen atoms, and three water oxygen atoms (Figure 3(a)). The Co–O bond distances range from 0.2064(2) to 0.2135(2) nm, while the Co–N bond lengths are slightly longer, ranging from 0.2140(4) to 0.2143(2) nm. The adjacent Co(II) ions are linked together by N atoms from 3,4′-Hbpt to form a metal helical chain. Interestingly, such chains crystallize in both right- and left-handed fashions. The pm4– acts as a bridge in a bis(monodentate) binding mode linking adjacent helical chains through its para-positioned carboxylic groups, re- sulting in a regular 2D architecture (Figure 3(b)).

Figure 3 (a) Coordination environment of Co2+ in 3 (lattice water and H atoms are omitted for clarity); (b) 2D architecture assembled by both right- and left-handed helical chains. 3.3 Coordination modes for the positionally isomeric ligands It is noteworthy that the positionally isomeric ligands in MOFs 1–3 are all neutral but still exhibit a variety of coor- dination modes, as illustrated in Scheme 3. Hbpt acts as monodentate and bis (monodentate) connectors. Further- more, the triazole moiety in Hbpt is involved in strong hy- drogen bonds, which contributes to the supramolecular network. It is obvious that the introduction of the auxiliary H4pm greatly influences the final structures. The carboxylic groups adopt monodentate, chelating and bridging modes, which is mostly responsible for the structural diversity. With the variation in coordination patterns of Hbpt and H4pm, the network arrays show 1D chains, a 2D network and a 3D framework in 1–3 respectively. 3.4 Thermal gravimetric analysis Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out from 50 to 800 °C (see Figures S1–S3 for TGA curves). 1 loses lattice water at about 60 °C with a weight loss of 4.47% (calc. 4.34%), and then remains stable up to 360 °C before undergoing successive weight losses. 2 experiences consecutive weight loss steps, which do not end until 800 °C. 3 is stable up to 100 °C and then undergoes a two step weight loss of 10.2% from 100 to 360 °C, corre- sponding to the release of the lattice water molecules (calc. 10.8%). Scheme 3 Coordination modes of Hbpt. 448 Xie G, et al. Sci China Chem March (2012) Vol.55 No.3 3.5 Effects on the thermal decomposition of ammoni- um perchlorate Compounds 1–3 and AP were mixed in a mass ratio of 1:3 to prepare samples for thermal decomposition analyses. The total sample mass used was less than 1.0 mg for all runs. From Figure 4, the endothermic peak at 245 °C for pure AP is due to a crystallographic transition of AP from the ortho- rhombic to the cubic phase. The second and third peaks for pure AP are exothermic, and correspond to the low- temperature decomposition (LTD) process and the high- temperature decomposition (HTD) process [37, 38]. The exothermic peak of the LTD process occurs at about 290 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1, corresponding to the de- composition of AP with a heat of 0.735 kJ g–1. The exo- thermic peak for the HTD process is at 442 °C with a heat of 0.787 kJ g–1. The DSC curves of AP in the presence of compounds 1–3 are also shown in Figure 4. In each case, there is no effect on the crystallographic transition temperature of APP. In the presence of compound 1, the exothermic peak oc- curred at 318 °C, indicating that AP is completely decom- posed at a lower temperature than for pure AP. Similarly, in the presence of 2, a sharp decomposition peak was observed at 300 °C, showing that AP is decomposed in a much short- er time than for pure AP. In the presence of compound 3, the LTD and HTD peaks converged to 338 and 457 °C. The onsets of thermal decomposition of the pure AP and AP in the presence of compounds 1–3 were all at about 300 °C, while the end temperatures were about 490, 343, 335 and 476 °C, respectively. The thermal decomposition rate of AP in presence of compounds 1 and 2 occurs more rapidly than pure AP, while addition of compound 3 to AP reduces the rate of decomposition. Moreover, in the presence of com- pounds 1, 2 and 3, the decomposition heats are 2.58, 2.00, and 0.82 kJ g–1, respectively, significantly higher than the corresponding heat value for neat AP. It is known that the decomposition temperature is related Figure 4 DSC curves for AP, 1 + AP, 2 + AP and 3+AP. to the heating rate (as shown in the Supporting Information). The relationship between decomposition temperature and heating rate can be described by the Kissinger correlation, as shown in eq. (1). a 2 a p p ln ln E AR E RT T   (1) where Ea is the apparent activation energy, β is the heating rate, R is the gas constant, Tp is the peak temperature, and A is the pre-exponential factor. According to this equation, the values of the activation energy Ea were obtained by Kissin- ger’s method at four different heating rates (see Figures S4–S6 for DSC curves). For pure AP, the calculated activa- tion energy is 74.65 kJ mol–1. As shown in Table 2, in presence of 1, 2 and 3, the activation energies increased to 170.03, 249.47 and 124.31 kJ mol–1, respectively. The in- crease in activation energy and the corresponding increase in the A value can be attributed to the kinetic compensation effect as reported previously [39]. The ratio of Ea/ln(A) can be used to describe the reactivity [40]. Usually, a larger ra- tio means a much greater stability of the reactant. The ratios of Ea/ln(A) are 14.1, 13.06 ,12.13 and 14.81 for pure AP, AP with 1, AP with 2 and AP with 3, respectively. Obviously, 1 and 2 show a better catalytic activity toward AP decomposi- tion than 3, which is consistent with the single exothermic peak in the corresponding DSC curves,. 4 Conclusion We have demonstrated here three new Co(II) MOFs gener- ated from mixed-ligand systems containing three position- ally isomeric ligands (3,3′-Hbpt, 4,4′-Hbpt and 3,4′-Hbpt) and H4pm under coordination-driven assembly. The intro- duction of H4pm greatly influences the coordination modes of Hbpt as well as the final supramolecular structures. Moreover, the effects of the three compounds on the ther- mal decomposition of AP have also been studied. Com- pounds 1 and 2 show good catalytic performance in AP de- composition, which could make them promising energetic additives for AP-based propellants.
