Moreover, the new compound bulk-modiﬁed carbon-paste electrode (1-CPE) displays good electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of nitrite, and the result of the photocatalytic activities indi- cates that the new compound presents better degradation activity and may be a potential photocatalyst to oxidative decomposition of rhodamine B dye in the presence of crystals [Ag3(pytz)2(H2O)]2[HAgGeMo12O40]H2O cata- lyst under ultraviolet-light irradiation. Keywords Polyoxometalates  Pyridyltetrazole  Electrocatalytic activity  Photocatalytic activity 1 Introduction Polyoxometalates (POMs), an outstanding class of metal– oxygen clusters, have attracted long-lasting research interest in catalysis, electrochemistry, magnetism, biochemistry and photochemistry chemistry [1–5]. To extend their versatility and bring new and more selective applications, the function- alization of POMs [6–8] has been attracting much attention, because many of their intriguing structural chemistry and potential applications are directly related to their surface characteristics. Up to now, a large number of POM-based hybrids have successfully been assembled through POMs covalently linked with transition-metal complexes [9–14]. However, more examples are needed to enrich this family, in order to provide more evidences to investigate the mechanism of the assembly. Additionally, there is a general correlation between the complexity ofthe structure of the materialand the functionality that it displays [15], so the study about the high- dimensional and high-connected POM-based hybrids is still a challengeable endeavor to broaden applications of POMs in materials science. When summarizing the high-dimensional and high- connected POMs based hybrids [16–19], we ﬁnd that the construction of POM-based hybrids mainly depends on the coordination nature of the metal ions and ligands, and the geometrical relations of all subunits. Pyridyltetrazoles (pytz), a readily accessible family of polyazaheteroaro- matic derivates, are attractive ligands owning to their ability to bridge multiple metal sites and the smaller steric hindrance [13, 20], which are positive aspects for realizing the complexity of the structure and the functionality of POM-based materials. On the other hand, Ag ions can display different [AgOx] types-coordination and synergis- tic coordination mode to facilitate the formation of several types-clusters with low and high coordination number [21], Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10904-013-9951-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Therefore, on the basis of the above considerations, we have chosen Keggin POMs/Ag/pytz as building blocks to construct the new Keggin POM-based hybrids in this work. Luckily, we obtained this new compound represented as [Ag3(pytz)2(H2O)]2[HAgGeMo12O40]H2O, which repre- sents the highest dimensionality and the highest coordina- tion number of Keggin POMs. 2 Experimental Details 2.1 Materials and Measurements All reagents were purchased commercially from Sigma- Aldrich and used without further puriﬁcation. Na4Ge- Mo12O40 was prepared according to the reported procedures and veriﬁed by IR spectrum [23]. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were performed on a PerkinElmer 2400 CHN Ele- mental Analyzer and Ag was determined by a leaman inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer. The IR spectrum was obtained on an Alpha Centaurt FT/IR spec- trometer with KBr pellet in the 400–4,000 cm-1 region. The XRPD patterns were obtained with a Rigaku D/max 2500 V PC diffractometer with Cu-Ka radiation, the scanning rate is 4/s, 2h ranging from 5 to 40. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained with a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation at room temperature. Platinum gauze was used as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode was referenced. Chemi- cally bulk-modiﬁed carbon paste electrodes (CPE) were used as working electrodes. UV–Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a 756 CRT UV–Vis spectrophotometer. 2.2 Synthesis of New POMs Compound A mixture of Na4GeMo12O40 (240 mg), AgNO3 (150 mg), pytz (28 mg), NH4VO3(24 mg) and H2O (10 ml) in the mole ratios 1:1:2:2:1,000 was stirred for 1 h in air. The pH was then adjusted to ca. 3 with 1 M NaOH,and the mixture was transferred to an 18 ml Teﬂon-lined reactor. After heating at 160 C for 4 days, the reactor was slowly cooled to room temperature. Red block crystals of 1 were ﬁltered, washed with water, and dried at room temperature (36 % yield based on Mo). C24H23N20Ag7GeMo12O43 (3258.6): Calcd.

To the mixture 0.2 ml Nujol was added and stirred with a glass rod. Then the homogenized mixture was used to pack 3 mm inner diameter glass tubes, and the surface was wiped with weighing paper. Electrical contact was estab- lished with copper rod through the back of the electrode. 2.4 Crystallographic Analyses Crystal data for the new compound were collected on a Bruker SMART-CCD diffractometer with Mo-Ka mono- chromatic radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 293 K. All struc- tures were solved by the directed methods and reﬁned by full matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL crys- tallographic software package [24]. All the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. During the reﬁnement, the command ‘ISOR’ was used to restrain the non-H atoms with ADP and NPD problems, which led to relative high restraint values: 112 for the new compound. The command ‘‘ISOR’’ was used to reﬁne atoms O14, O17, O19, O20, O21, O23, O25 and C7 in the new compound. Additionally, restraint command ‘‘DELU’’ was used to average the thermal parameters of atoms with similar environments along the bond for the new compound. It reﬁned atoms C7, N1, N2, N3 and N4. In the end, restraint command ‘‘SIMU’’ was used to average the thermal parameters of atoms with same environments for the new compound. It reﬁned atoms O9, O14, O16, O17 and O19 for the new compound. The positions of hydrogen atoms on carbon atoms were calculated theoretically. The crystal data and structure reﬁnement of the new compound is summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for the new compound are listed in Table S1. CCDC reference numbers 932969. 3 Results and Discussions All molybdenum atoms are in ?6 oxidation states, which were conﬁrmed by charge neutrality, coordination envi- ronments and valence sum calculations [25]. Similar to the case of [Ag2(3atrz)2]2[(HPMo10 VIMo2 VO40)] [26], to balance the charge of the compound, the proton is added in the new compound. The networks of compounds were analyzed by using the TOPOS40 program [27]. 3.1 Structural Description of the New POMs Compound Crystal structure analysis reveals that the new compound consists of six Ag ions, four deprotonated pytz, one [Ag- GeMo12O40]3- polyoxoanion, two coordination water and one lattice water (Fig. 1 left). In the new compound, three- J Inorg Organomet Polym (2013) 23:1468–1476 1469 123 coordinated Ag1 is coordinated by two N atoms from two pytz and one O atom from [GeMo12O40]4- polyoxoanion, exhibiting a ‘‘T-shape’’ geometry; ﬁve-coordinated Ag2 is surrounded by three N atoms from three pytz and two O atoms from [GeMo12O40]4- polyoxoanion and coordina- tion water, exhibiting a trigonal biyramid geometry; four- coordinated Ag3 shows a ‘‘seesaw’’ geometry by three N atoms from three pytz and O atom from [GeMo12O40]4- polyoxoanion, and Ag4 is also four coordinated, which is surrounded by four bridging oxygen atoms from two [GeMo12O40]4- polyoxoanions. The bond distances around Ag ions are 2.154–2.291 A˚ for Ag–N and 2.291–2.818 A˚ for Ag-O bond. As a result, each [GeMo12O40]4- poly- oxoanion links with eight Ag centers (Fig. 1 right), which represents the highest coordination number of Keggin POMs up to date. In the new compound, there are two kinds of crystal- lographically unique pytz ligand (L-1 and L-2). Two kinds of ligands as short radiated linkers afford ﬁve bridging sites for L1 (Ag1, Ag2, Ag2, Ag3, Ag3) and three bridging sites for L2 (Ag1, Ag2, Ag3) from different directions, so a compacted 2D metal–organic subunit is generated shown in Fig. 2. Additionally, the radiated coordination style and the smaller steric hindrance of pytz provide considerable metal atoms for the coordination of POMs. All are positive aspects for the formation of the high-dimensional and high- connected POMs based hybrids. So the [GeMo12O40]4- polyoxoanions as secondary building blocks link with the 2D metal–organic subunits via Ag1, Ag2, Ag3 forming 3D POM-based hybrid compounds. Interesting that, along a axis, [GeMo12O40]4- polyoxoanions form an inﬁnite [AgGeMo12O40]n 3n- POM chains shown in Fig. 3. To better comprehend the structure, the complicated 3D structure can be rationalized as (3, 6, 8) connecting network with (362)(334453647) (3446566676) topology if we assign the pytz as the connectors and the Ag atoms and POM clusters as the nodes. In this simpliﬁcation, the 3-connected nodes are Ag1 atoms, the 6-connected nodes are Ag2–Ag3 (2-in-1) and the eight-connected nodes are the [GeMo12O40]4- polyoxoanions (Fig. 4). 3.2 FT-IR Spectrum and XRPD Patterns Analyses The IR spectrum of the new compound is shown in Fig. S1. Characteristic bands at 1 975,914, 793 and 781 cm-1 are attributed to m (Mo=O), m (Mo–Ob–Mo), and m (Mo–Oc– Mo) vibrations, respectively. Band in the regions of 1610–1179 cm-1 are attributed to the pytz ligands. Fig. S2 in the Supporting Information presents the XRPD for the new compound.

The differ- ence in reﬂection intensities between the simulated and the experimental patterns is due to the different orientation of the crystals in the powder samples. 3.3 Electrochemical Activity Analyses POMs have been exploited extensively in the electrocata- lytic reductions by chemically modiﬁed electrode (CME), because of the ability to undergo reversible multi-electron redox processes [28, 29]. However, due to the good solu- bility of the traditional CME with POMs, its application is limited [30]. The three-dimensional bulk-modiﬁed CPEs have been widely applied in electrochemistry with advan- tages: inexpensive, easy to handle, and easy to prepare. Herein, the electrochemical activities of the new compound were investigated under identical conditions by using 1- CPE.

As seen from the Fig. 5 left, it can be clearly seen that in the potential range three pairs of redox peaks (I–I0, II–II0 and III–III0) are observed for 1, ascribed to three consecutive redox processes of Mo atoms, respectively, and the mean peak potentials E1/2 = (Epc ? Epa)/2 are ?86, ?301 and ?840. With the increase of scan rate, the increasing extent of the anodic and cathodic peak currents are almost the same, and the peak potentials change gradually: the catho- dic peak potentials shift toward the negative direction and the corresponding anodic peak potentials to the positive direction, and the peak-to-peak separation between the corresponding cathodic and anodic peaks increases, but the average peak potentials don’t change on the whole. 3.5 Stability and Surface-Renewal of 1-CPE In the experiments, 1-CPE showed higher stability than that of the conventional POM gel ﬁlm electrode. When the scanning range was maintained from ?800 to -50 mV, the electrodes were stable over 500 cycles at a scan rate 100 mV s-1 and the current response remained almost unchanged. The remarkable stability for 1-CPE should be ascribed to the insolubility of the inorganic–organic hybrid POM nanoparticles. One of the main attractions of the use of 1-CPE is that squeezing a little carbon paste out of the tube can renew the bulk-modiﬁed CPE when needed. This is especially useful for electro-catalytic studies since cat- alytic activity decreases when the electrode is dirtied. 3.6 pH-Dependent Electrochemical Behavior of 1-CPE The pH of the supporting electrolyte has a slight effect on the electrochemical behavior of the 1-CPE in H2SO4 ?Na2SO4 aqueous solutions. As seen in Fig. 5 right, with the increase of pH, the three redox potentials all gradually shift to negative direction and the peak currents decrease. Reduction of hybrid 1 nanoparticles is similar to that of H4GeMo12O40 itself and is accompanied by the evolution of protons from solution to the nanoparticles of the elec- trodes surface to maintain charge neutrality. 3.7 Electrocatalytic Activity Analyses The reduction of nitrite to ammonia involves a six-elec- tron-eight-proton change. Owing to high overpotential required at most electrode surfaces for direct electrore- duction of nitrite ion, no obvious response is observed for nitrite at bare CPE in the range of ?800 to -50 mV. Fig. 6 shows the cyclic voltammograms of 1-CPE under scan rate 100 mV s-1 in an acid solution containing nitrite. The result indicates that 1-CPE has good electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of nitrite. With the addition of nitrite, all the three reduction peak currents increase markedly while the corresponding oxidation peak currents decrease, suggesting that the reduction of nitrite involves two-, four- and six-electron-reduced species. It is noted that the six-electron-reduce species has the largest catalytic activity towards the reduction of nitrite.

The introduction of transition- metal complexes as functional groups into POMs can enrich their potential applications, such as catalysis, non- linear optics, and electrical conductivity. Herein, to investigate the photocatalytic activities of the new com- pound as catalysts, the photodecomposition of Rhodamine- B (RhB) is evaluated under UV light irradiation through a typical process [33]: the power of 50 mg was mixed together with 100 ml of 1.0 9 10-5 mol l-1 (C0) RhB solution in a beaker by ultrasonic dispersion for 10 min. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h till reached the surface- adsorption equilibrium on the particles of the new com- pound. Then, the mixture was stirred continuously under ultraviolet irradiation from a 125 W high pressure Hg lamp. At 20, 40, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min, the sample (3 ml) of was taken out from the beaker respectively, fol- lowed by several centrifugations to remove the new com- pound and a clear solution was obtained for UV–Vis analysis. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, RhB has a major absorption peak at 554 nm, which decreases from 0.90 to 0.18 for 1 and from 1.065 to 0.59 for (NBu4)4[GeMo12O40], and after irradiation compound 1 for 150 min, the photo- catalytic decomposition rate, deﬁned as 1-C/C0, is 80.3 %. Moreover, in contrast, the photocatalytic decomposition rate using (NBu4)4[GeMo12O40] as catalyst is 44.8 % after UV light irradiation of 150 min shown in Fig. 7c. In order to quantitatively understand the reaction kinetics for the degradation of the RhB dye by catalyst compound 1, we applied the pseudo-ﬁrst order model [34] as expressed by eqn (1) to obtain the rate constant (j) ln Cn C0   ¼ jt ð1Þ where C0 is the initial concentration (0 min) of the RhB aqueous solution and Cn is the concentration of the RhB aqueous solution for different times of UV illuminations, t is the time and j is the pseudo-ﬁrst order, respectively. This equation is generally used for the photocatalytic degradation process if the initial concentration of pollutant is low (1.0 9 10-5) [35]. According to Eq. (1), if [-ln(Cn/ C0)] is plotted as a function of t, a straight line should be obtained whose slope is j (min-1). Fig. 7d indicates that the rate constants without catalyst for the degradation of RhB are very small, revealing that the dye practically do not degrade under UV-illumination. The rate constant values (j) for the degradation of RhB solutions are 0.0161 for new compound and 0.0059 for (NBu4)4[GeMo12O40], respectively. And the correlation coefﬁcient (R) also shows good statistics values of the new compound and (NBu4)4 [GeMo12O40]. These results illustrate that the formation of organic–inorganic hybrid compound could improve the photocatalytic performance of the (NBu4)4[GeMo12O40]. Additionally, the photocatalytic mechanisms may be deduced as follows: during photocatalytic reaction, [*GeMo12O40]4- (*POM) abstract electrons from H2O molecules and hold the electrons (reaction 2 and 3). The reduced POM (POM-) is quite stable but rapidly re- oxidized in the presence of O2 through reaction 4, and the main function of O2 in POM reactions seems to be the reoxidation (regeneration) of the catalyst [36–39]. The reoxidation (reaction 4) accompany the generation of superoxides. These cycles occur continuously while the system is exposed to the UV light [36]. Furthermore, the RhB dye is also excited by UV light to generate *RhB molecule as reaction5. Finally, after several of photo- oxidation, the degradation of RhB dye by the hydroxyl radicals and the superoxides occurs [40, 41] (reaction 6).

Based on our photocatalytic mechanisms, we assume that the Ag–O clusters modifying POMs may be the reason for the higher photocatalytic activity of new compound. On one hand, UV excitation of POMs induces a ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) with promoting an electron from Fig. 6 Cyclic voltammograms of 1-CPE in 1 M H2SO4 containing 0(a); 4(b); 8(c )mM NaNO2.

On the other hand, Ag–O clusters as bridging units linking POMs facilitate transfer of the electron from POM to POM due to the distortion of theMO6 octahedra. 4 Conclusions In summary, the complicated high-connected POM-based hybrid compound has been successfully synthesized and structurally characterized. In the structure point of view, the rich and novel coordination geometries of Ag atoms and pytz facilitate the formation of the highest coordination number of the Keggin POMs. The fact shows that pytz ligands are good candidates of linkages for the construction of compounds with high-dimensionality. Additionally, the new compound exhibits good electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of nitrite and good photocatalytic activities for the degradation of RhB dyes. So this work is signiﬁcant in the area of further development of the extended structures based on POMs. 5 Supplementary data Crystallographic data for the structural analysis have been deposited with the CambridgeCrystallographic Center, CCDC Nos. 932969 for the new compound.
