Keywords Fluorescence  Magnetic  dpa  Dipyridine Introduction Recently, the design and synthesis of the metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have led to a large number of coor- dination polymers. In essence, it is the process of assem- bling the designed MOFs based on coordination covalent bonding, non-covalent bonding (such as hydrogen bonding, p–p stacking), into high-dimensional structures [1–4]. Much attention has been devoted to design such com- pounds by chemists because of their potential applications as catalytic, conductive, luminescent, magnetic, spin- transition, non-linear optical or porous functional materi- als [5]. Molecular self-assembly under the direction of the crystal engineering has proved to be efﬁcient [6–9], however, the assembly process is highly inﬂuenced by lots of factors, and it is impossible to precise predict the ﬁnal structures. The biphenyl ligands bearing structural ﬂexibility and conformation freedom are good choice of O-donor ligands, and the ﬂexible nature of spaces allows these ligands to rotate when coordinate to metal centers so as to conform to the coordination geometries of metal ions [10, 11]. Signiﬁcant progress has been achieved in this area; however, the factors that affect the formation of coordi- nation polymers constructed form ﬂexible biphenyl ligands and the exploitation of novel strategies are still compara- tively less investigated. Previous investigations including ours indicate that 2,20-biphenyldicarboxylate (H2dpa) has a strong capability of affording new coordination polymers for several reasons: (a) it has four potential donor car- boxylic oxygen atoms to coordinate to metal ions with different connection modes [12–15], (b) the skew coordi- nation orientation of the carboxylic group, the hindrance between the 2,20-positioned carboxylic groups, and the nonlinear ﬂexibility around the two benzene groups make it quite a versatile ligand for constructing novel coordination polymers [16–21], and (c) it displays strong reactive ability with d and f block metal ions [22–25]. Our group is currently involved in the investigation of the complexes with the dpa ligand and different auxiliary ligands. In this paper, the synthese, single-crystal X-ray structural characterizations and some properties of the two novel complexes are presented. Y.-H.

Results and Discussion Crystal Structure Description [Zn(Hdpa)2(2,20-bipy)]2 (1) Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that com- pound 1 is a triclinic system, space group P-1. Compound 1 is a dual-core molecular structure of two Zn ions in the same coordination environment. As shown in Fig. 1, Zn2? ions adopt the slightly distorted octahedral coordination, and Zn ion is coordinated by two N atoms from 2,20-bipy which chelated with the Zn ion, [Zn(1)–N(1) = 2.0396(18) A˚ , Zn(1)–N(2) = 2.1108(16) A˚ ], and four O atoms from three carboxyl ligands. As known, dpa ligands are versatile building blocks for constructions of metal–organic poly- meric structures and their carboxylic groups link metal ions with various coordinated modes [12–15]. Two proton- ated carboxylic groups of dpa in compound 1 also behave differently: one acts as a bidentate ligand linking to Zn through O1 and O2, the other acts as a monodentate ligand linking to Zn through O3 and O5, respectively. [Zn–O = 1.9760(15)–2.2881(14) A˚ ]. This bridge mode of the ligand in compound 1 is the same as that in the reported compound [Eu2 (2,20-(dpdc)3(phen)(H2O)2]n (2,20-dpdc = 2,20-diphenyldicarboxylate) [16]. But it is different with that in the reported compound [Eu2(bpdc)3(phen)2(H2O)2]n nH2O (bpdc =biphenyl-2,20-dicarboxylate), in which a ligand acts as a tetradentate unit to connect two adjacent Eu(III) ions through chelating carboxylate groups [26]. [Mn(dpa)(4,40-bipy)]n (2) Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound 2 is a layer structure based on the one- dimensional chains bridged by 4,4-bipy. As shown in Fig. 2, the Mn2? adopt slightly distorted octahedral coordination. Mn ion is coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from three different dpa comprising an equatorial plane, two pyridyl nitrogen atoms from dif- ferent 4,4-bipy occupy the apical positions. The carbox- ylic groups of dpa in compound 2 act as monodentate ligand linking to Mn ion. O1 and O3 from different carboxyl in the same dpa linking to Mn, Mn(1)– O(3) = 2.1733 A˚ , Mn(1)–O(1) = 2.1733 A˚ , O2 and O4 from different carboxyl and different dpa, Mn(1)– O(2B) = 2.1477 A˚ , Mn(1)–O(4A) = 2.1607 A˚ . As shown in Fig. 3, the O atoms from H2dpa and Mn2? ions connected together to form a one-dimensional chain, 4,40-bipy to connect adjacent Mn2? ions to form another one-dimensional chain, two chains overlapped to form novel two-dimensional reticular structure. And for J Chem Crystallogr (2011) 41:1406–1410 1407 123 compound 2, a very similar compound [Mn2(dpa)2(4,4- bipy)2(H2O)2]n was reported in 2005 [24], using the dif- ferent salt and solvent, in which two H2O molecules are coordinated with the Mn2? ion. Fluorescence Spectra of Compound 1 Ligand and compound 1’s solid-state ﬂuorescence emission spectra were determined at the room temperature, which showed in Fig. 4. Compound 1 has an emission peak at 480 nm (400 nm excitation) and the ligand has a very similar emission peak at 471 nm (390 nm excitation). The increase of the ﬂuorescence for this compound may be attributed to the ligand and metal center constituted com- pound and lower its symmetry. Magnetic Property of Compound 2 The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility (vM) of compound 2 was measured in the temperature range 2–300 K under ﬁxed ﬁelds of 1 kOe, and the magnetic susceptibilities vM and effective moment leff versus T plots are shown in Fig. 5. At room temperature, the experimental effective moment value is 5.87 BM, which lower than the non-coupled Mn-ion spin-only value of 5.91 BM. As the temperature increased, the effective moment slowly rising, this can attribute to between Mn2? ions exists the weak antiferromagnetic interaction.

Conclusions In summary, two compounds are synthesized by hydro- thermal reactions and structurally characterized. This research shows that the deprotonated carboxylic groups of dpa ligands play an important role in linking metal ions with multi-coordinated modes and afford a broader way to generate unique structural motifs. Further through the dipyridyl bridging, the one-dimension chain motifs extend into layer and cavity structures in 2. And we studied the ﬂuorescence of compound 1 and magnetic property of compound 2, it displays weak antiferromagnetic interac- tions between the inter-chain Mn2? ions.
