Keywords Imidazoline  Hydrogen bond interactions  Supramolecular 1 Introduction In recent years the crystal engineering of supramolecular architectures based on metals and organic building blocks has been rapidly expanding owing to their novel and diverse topologies and potential applications in molecular catalysis, electrical conductivity, magnetism, and so on [1–10]. So far, a great of 1D, 2D, and 3D such supramolecular architectures have been achieved by utilizing coordination bonds and non- covalent interactions (hydrogen bond, p–p stacking etc.) as the driving forces [11–16]. Despite some advancement, the ability tocontrolsupramoleculararchitecturesremainsalongstanding challenge [17]. Generally, the key features that inﬂuence supramolecular complexes of self-assembled species are build blocks: the metal, which has a preferred coordination envi- ronment, and the ligand,which not only offers the donor atoms situated at speciﬁc positions [18], but also provides potential interaction sites to generate non-covalent interactions. It is well known that imidazole have been widely used and proven to be good N-donor ligands for the construction of coordination polymers and multidimensional supramolecu- lar networks [19–21]. Imidazoline, similar to imidazole, are also the ﬁve-membered nitrogen heterocycles [22]. How- ever, in contrast with imidazole, there are few reports on complexes based on imidazoline ligands. Until 1989, imi- dazoline attracted attention for the application in homoge- neous catalysis [23]. In the past years, it is found that imidazoline and their derivatives exhibit excellent activity against several diseases including hyperglycaemia, inﬂam- mation and cancer [24–26]. And some of them have been demonstrated to be adrenergic receptors and synthetic intermediates [27]. Among various imidazoline derivatives, the importance of 2-imidazoline is the highest for their wide applications in different ﬁelds of chemistry. They have been found in natural product chemistry, pharmaceutical chem- istry, organic synthesis, coordination chemistry, and homo- geneous catalysis [28, 29]. Recently, they have been developed as ligands in coordination chemistry and the substitutions on the nitrogen atom in the imidazoline ring provide opportunities for ﬁne-tuning the electronic effect [30].

In addition, NH– groups and CH2– groups from imidazoline rings can be act as potential hydrogen bond donors, affording the possibilities to form supramolecular com- plexes with higher dimensionalities. As far as we know, until now the detailed crystal structure and intermolecular interactions of PI complexes have never been reported, although a few transition-metal complexes have been studied [32–34]. The further study of PI complexes’ crystal structure will gain the knowledge of the coordination mode and supramolecular interactions of the PI ligand, and enhance the understanding of the close relationship between imidazoline and biological system. Thus, the blank of crystal structure and supramolecular behaviorsmotivateustostudythePIcomplexes.Inthispaper, two new coordination complexes, [Cu(PI)(OX)(H2O)]H2O (1) and [Cu(PI)(fum)(H2O)]H2O (2) (H2OX = oxalic acid and H2fum = fumaric acid), were synthesized with Cu(OAc)2 and aliphatic dicarboxylic acids. X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that the PI ligands combine with the center Cu(II) ions in the bidentate chelating mode in both 1 and 2. In 1, not only NH– group but also one CH2– group of imidaz- oline participate in hydrogen bond interactions, but in 2, only NH– group takes part in the hydrogen bonds. Complex 1 is a mononuclear structure which spreads into a 3D (4,9)-con- nected supramolecular network via hydrogen bond interac- tions, while complex 2 features a 1D zigzag chain with two different orientations. These two compounds are fully char- acterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Infrared spectra (IR), elemental analyses (EA) and TG analyses (TGA). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and General Methods PI ligand was prepared according to the literature method using our homemade catalyst [35] and all other the chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without further puriﬁcation. Infrared spectra (IR) were obtained with KBr discs on a Bruker EQUINOX-55 FT-IR spectrometer in the range of 4,000–400 cm-1. EA of C, H, and N elements were determined with a Perkin- Elmer 2400C Elemental analyzer. PXRD data were col- lected on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray powder dif- fractometer (Cu Ka, 1.5418 A˚ ). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out under nitrogen atmo- sphere using a Netzsch TG209F3 equipment at a heating rate of 10 C min-1. 2.2 Preparation of [Cu(PI)(OX)(H2O)]H2O (1) Cu(OAc)2H2O (0.1 mmol, 20.0 mg) was dissolved in 5 ml water, and carefully layered by 5 ml methanol solution of PI (0.1 mmol, 14.8 mg) and H2OX (0.1 mmol, 9.0 mg). Slow evaporation of the diffused mixture provided suitable blue block single crystals of 1 for X-ray crystallography after a week. Yield: 60 % (based on PI). Anal.

Compounds 1 and 2 are insoluble when soaked in a series of common organic solvents (CH3CN, EtOH, DMF, DMA, NMP) and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. 2.4 X-ray Crystallography Single-crystal diffraction data of the two complexes were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) by using u/x scan technique at room temperature. The structure were solved by the direct Fig. 1 View of coordination environment of Cu(II) ion for 1 (guest water molecule is omitted for clarity) J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:560–567 561 123 methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares reﬁnements based on F2 [36]. All non-hydrogen atoms were located successfully from Fourier maps and were reﬁned aniso- tropically. The hydrogen atoms of organic ligands were placed in calculated positions and the water molecules were added to their geometrically ideal positions. Crystal data as well as details of data collection and reﬁnements for these two complexes are summarized in Table S1. Selected bond lengths and angles for complex 1 and 2 are given in Table S2. Hydrogen bond geometries of complex 1 and 2 are listed in Table S3 and Table S4, respectively. Crystallographic data for the structural analyses have been deposited with the Cambridge crystallographic data center. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Crystal Structure of 1 X-ray crystallography shows that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with space group of P21/c. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of one Cu(II) ion, one PI, one OX2-, one coordinated water molecule and one lattice water molecule. As shown in Fig. 1, the central metal Cu1 is ﬁve-coordinated by two N atoms (N1, N2) from a che- lating PI ligand, and three O atoms (the O1, O2 coming from two carboxylate groups of one OX2- and O1W from coordinated H2O molecule), resulting a distorted square Fig. 2 (a) The 2D (4,4)-connected supramolecular [Cu(PI)(OX)(H2O)]-water layer (b) The 3D supramolecular architecture via hydrogen bond interactions (green dotted lines) of 1 and the hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity Fig. 3 (a) The free water molecule acts as 4-connected node by linking four mononuclear molecules. (b) The mononuclear molecule acts as 4-connected node by linking four water molecules. (c) The mononuclear molecule (purple) acts as 5-connected node by linking ﬁve adjacent ones (yellow) and the hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. (d) The mononuclear molecule acts as 9-connected node by linking ﬁve mononuclear molecules and four water molecules (Color ﬁgure online) 562 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:560–567 123 pyramid [s = 0.05; s = (b - a)/60, where a and b are the two biggest bond angles around Cu(II) center; s = 0 for ideal square pyramid; and s = 1 for ideal trigonal bipyra- mid] [37]. The O1, O2, N1, and N2 are in the basal plane (maximum atomic deviation being 0.1405 A˚ ) with Cu1– O1 = 1.933(2) A˚ , Cu1–O2 = 1.966(2) A˚ , Cu1–N1 = 2.027(3) A˚ , Cu1–N2 = 1.941(3) A˚ , and aqua oxygen O1W is in the apical site with Cu1–O1W = 2.328(3) A˚ . It can be seen that the bond distance of Cu–O in the apical is longer than that in the basal plane due to the Jahn–Teller effect [38]. The Cu(II) is shifted by 0.1598 A˚ from this plane towards the apical oxygen. PI ligand is essentially planar with the dihedral angle between the imidazoline and pyridyl rings being 0.778(1). This quasi planarity is derived from the signiﬁcant percentage of double bond character of the inter-ring carbon–carbon bond [1.475(4) A˚ for C1–C4]. The values of the bite angle subtended by the bidentate oxalate and PI ligands are 84.64(9) and 81.55(1), respectively. Each free water molecule links four mononuclear [Cu(PI)(OX)(H2O)] molecules and each mononuclear [Cu(PI)(OX)(H2O)] molecule links four free water molecules forming a 2D (4,4)-connected supramolecular [Cu(PI)(OX) (H2O)]-water layer (Fig. 2a) through hydrogen bond inter- actions (Table S3). Moreover, each discrete [Cu(PI)(OX) (H2O)] molecule links ﬁve adjacent ones via hydrogen bond interactions (Table S3) generating a 3D 5-connected honey- comb-like net (Fig. 4b). The supramolecular structure of complex 1 is composed by the 2D (4,4)-connected [Cu(PI) (OX)(H2O)]-waterlayerand3D5-connectedhoneycomb-like net. Thus, when [Cu(PI)(OX)(H2O)] units and free water molecules were considered nodes and hydrogen bond inter- actions as linkers, the whole structure can be rationalized to be a 3D (4,9)-connected supramolecular network with 4-con- nected water molecule nodes, and 9-connected [Cu(PI)(OX) (H2O)] molecule nodes (Figs. 3, 4). 3.2 Crystal Structure of 2 Similar to 1, compound 2 also crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with space group P21/c and the asymmetric unit consists of one Cu(II) ion, one PI, one fum2-, one coordinated water molecule and one lattice water molecule as shown in Fig. 5. However, the basal plane of the square pyramid Cu1 center (s = 0.14) is well-deﬁned by two N atoms (N1, N2) from a chelating PI ligand, one O atom (O1) belonging to carboxylate group of fum2- ligand and one aqua oxygen atom (O5), and the apical position is occupied by O4#1 from carboxylate group of fum2- ligand. It is worth noting that the distance of the Cu1O2 is 2.822(8) A˚ , which is smaller than the sum of vander Walls radius (2.92 A˚ ) [39, 40], indicating that there is a weak interaction between Cu1 and O2. If the Cu–O weak interaction is taken into consideration, the Cu1 center is six-coordinated with the distorted octahedron geometry. The imidazoline and pyridyl rings of PI is also coplanar with the dihedral angle of 1.041(3). The bond length of C5–C6 [1.483(9) A˚ ] and the angle of N1–Cu1–N2 [80.7(2)] are in agree with that of 1. Different with the oxalic acid of complex 1, each fumaric acid in complex 2 acts as a bridging ligand linking Fig. 4 (a) The simpliﬁed 2D (4,4)-connected supramolecular layer. (b) The simpliﬁed 3D 5-connected honeycomb-like net. (c) The simpliﬁed 3D (4,9)-connected supramolecular network of 1 Fig. 5 View of coordination environment of Cu(II) ion for 2 (guest water molecule is omitted for clarity) Symmetry code: #1 = 1 ? x, 0.5 - y, 0.5 ? z J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:560–567 563 123 two Cu(II) ions to generate a 1D zigzag chain with Cu–Cu– Cu angle of 92.18 and CuCu distance of 8.236 A˚ (Fig. 6a). However, it is found that the PI ligands show different spatial orientations, which lead to two types of zigzag chains (A and B). As illustrated in Fig. 6b, these 1D chains with same orientations are connected to each other through hydrogen bond interactions (Table S4) among free water molecules, coordination water molecules and fuma- ric acid ligands giving rise to a 2D supramolecular layer (A or B). Furthermore, these 2D supramolecular layers stack along b direction with a –ABAB– sequence to yield a 3D supramolecular framework via hydrogen bond interactions between PI and fumaric acid ligands (Table S4; Fig. 7). When viewed along the crystallographic a direction, 1D rectangular-shaped channel is observed. 3.3 Comparison of Supramolecular Structures Moreover, it should be pointed out that the structure of 1 is similar to that of reported complex [Cu(pyim)(C2O4) (H2O)]2H2O [1a, pyim = 2-(20-pyridyl) imidazole] [41]. Compared with 1, 1a, and 2, it is apparent to observe that the length and variable coordination modes of the carboxylate ligands directly resulted in the mononuclear structure or 1D chain structure of 1(1a) and 2, for the shorter oxalate combining with Cu(II) center in chelating bidentate mode but the longer fumaric acid linking two Cu(II) atoms in a bis-monodentate bridging mode. Through the further study, we found that there exist different supramolecular interactions and supramolecular structures in these complexes (Fig. 8). In 1a, due to the NH– group and one CH– group of imidazole forming the almost coplanar hydrogen bonds (N3–H31O3#1, N3– H31O2#1 and C8–H8O3#1) along the c direction, the [Cu(pyim)(C2O4)(H2O)] molecules self-assemble forming a 1D single supermolecular chain and are arranged nearly coplanar (Fig. 8a). In addition, the other CH– group (C7H7) in 1a is hydrogen bonded one free water molecule in the same plane. In 1, the mononuclear [Cu(PI)(C2O4) (H2O)] molecules are also constructed to be similar 1D Fig. 6 (a) The 1D A-type zigzag chain of 2. (b) The 2D A-type layer through hydrogen bond interactions (green dotted lines) between the A-type chains of 2 and the hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity Fig. 7 The 3D supramolecular network of 2 through hydrogen bond interactions (green dotted green lines) with –ABAB– sequence and hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity (Color ﬁgure online) 564 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:560–567 123 supramolecular chain through the N–HO hydrogen bond (N3–H3O4#2 and N3–H3O3#2) along one direction. However, one imidazoline CH2– group, along the approximately perpendicular direction to the N–HO hydrogen bond, interacts the adjacent 1D supramolecular chains via a pair of antiparallel weak hydrogen bonds (C2– H2BO2#1) generating a 1D double chain (Fig. 8b). Further examining the hydrogen bond interactions of 1a and 1 shows that the average distance of C–HO bond in 1a is shorter than that in 1, which suggests that imidazole is a signiﬁcantly stronger C–H donor than imidazoline. In 2, similar in 1, the imidazoline NH– group also creates hydrogen bonds N3–H3AO3#1 and N3–H3AO4#1, through which the individual zigzag chains joined together into a 2D layer (Fig. 8c). But the two imidazoline CH2– groups in 2 do not participate in hydrogen bond interactions. In light of these observations and the considerations discussed above, perhaps these differences can be attrib- uted to the difference between imidazole and imidazoline. The whole imidazole ring is a conjugated system, in which the C7 and C8 atoms are sp2 hybridization and the C7–C8 bond is a double bond [1.376(1) A˚ ] [42], and all atoms (C, Fig. 8 (a) The 1D single chain is formed via hydrogen bond interactions in 1a (The partial hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity) Symmetry code: #1 x, y, -1 ? z. (b) The 1D double chain is formed via hydrogen bond interactions in 1 (The partial hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity) symmetry codes: #1 = -x, 1 - y, -z; #2 = 1 ? x, y, 1 ? z. (c) The 2D layer is formed via hydrogen bond interactions in 2 (The partial hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity) symmetry codes: #1 = -x, -1/2 ? y, -1/2 - z Fig. 9 Comparison of PXRD patterns of the simulated pattern from the single-crystal structure determination and the as-synthesized products in 1 Fig. 10 Comparison of PXRD patterns of the simulated pattern from the single-crystal structure determination and the as-synthesized products in 2 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:560–567 565 123 N, and especially three H atoms) are almost coplanar. However, the corresponding imidazoline C2 and C3 atoms are sp3 hybridization (C2–C3 = 1.540 A˚ ) and its four hydrogen atoms (H2A, H2B, H3A, H3B) are non-coplanar with the imidazoline ring. Because the strength of the C–H hydrogen bond depends on the acidity of the hydrogen [43, 44], the imidazole C–H is a stronger donor than imidazo- line. So the C(imidazole)–HO hydrogen bonds in 1a could be stronger and shorter than C(imidazoline)–HO hydrogen bonds in 1. And the hydrogen atom’s orientation of the imidazoline C–H induced adjacent 1D supramolec- ular chains to arrange in a stagger fashion, as illustrated in Fig. 8b. In the case of 2, the weaker electronegativity of C atoms as compared with N atoms could be explain the preferential formation of the N–HO hydrogen bonds. From the discussion above, it can be concluded that the ﬁnal structure is determined by the collaboration action of the coordination covalent bonds and weak interactions non- covalent bonds [45]. 3.4 Powder X-ray Diffraction Analyses PXRD pattern measurements were carried out to examine the phase purity of complexes 1 and 2. As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, the experimental results demonstrate good con- sistence with the simulated, which indicates that these complexes were synthesized as a single phase. 3.5 Thermogravimetric analyses of 1 and 2 In order to estimate the thermal stabilities of complexes 1 and 2, TGA were carried out in N2 at a heating rate of 10 C min-1 (Fig. 11). For 1, the ﬁrst weight loss of 11.3 % before 157 C is consistent with coordinated water molecules and lattice water molecules (calc. 10.8 %). The second weight loss of 42.4 % between 200 and 256 C is attributed to the loss of PI ligands (calcd. 43.6 %). For 2, the ﬁrst weight loss before 137 C corresponds to the removal of lattice and coordinated water molecules (obsd. 11.0 %; calcd. 10.0 %). The second weight loss corre- sponding to the loss of PI ligands (obsd. 38.4 %; calcd. 40.6 %) starts at 172 C. 4 Conclusion In summary, two Cu(II) compounds with PI ligands and aliphatic dicarboxylic acids were successfully synthesized and studied. X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that the PI ligands combine with the center Cu(II) ions in the bidentate chelating mode in 1 and 2. Complex 1 is a mononuclear complex which spreads into a 3D (4,9)-connected supra- molecular network, While complex 2 features a 1D zigzag chain with two different orientations. The structural com- parison of 1, 1a, 2 indicates that the length and variable coordination modes of the carboxylate ligands exert a signiﬁcant impact on the formation of coordination com- plexes and the orientation of hydrogen bonds will directly affect the supramolecular structures. In a word, the coor- dination bonds and hydrogen bonds together determine the ﬁnal structures. This study enhances the understanding of the PI ligand’s coordination mode and supramolecular interactions, and gains the information of the imidazoline behavior in biological system. 5 Supplementary materials Crystallographic data for the compound 1 and 2 have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center as supplementary publications (CCDC: 958428 and 958429).
