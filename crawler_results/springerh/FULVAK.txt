Manuscript COMMUNICATION A Six-Connected 3D Europium Coordination Polymer Assembled by 5-Bromoisophthalic Acid (H2BIPA) and 1,10-Phenanthroline (phen): Synthesis, Characterization and Luminescent Property Guang-Xiang Liu • Rong-Yi Huang • Liang-Fang Huang • Heng Xu • Xiao-Ming Ren Received: 27 November 2007 / Accepted: 16 January 2010 / Published online: 2 February 2010  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010 Abstract A novel three-dimensional coordination polymer, [Eu2(phen)2(BIPA)3]2H2O (1) (BIPA = 5-bromoisophtha- late), has been synthsized by the reaction 5-bromoisophthalic acid with Eu(NO3)36H2O under the hydrothermal conditions and characterized by IR, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group Pı¯ and affords a three-dimensional (3D) six-connected a-Po network. Complex 1 showed the characteristic emission spectra of the EuIII and appeared to have good ﬂuorescence properties. Keywords Europium(III) coordination polymer  5-Bromoisophthalic acid  Crystal structure  Photophysical property Introduction In the past decade, Metal–organic Frameworks (MOFs) compounds with unique architectures and physical prop- erties have afforded a promising approach toward the design and synthesis of the materials with potential applications in gas separation, hydrogen storage, catalysis, optical and magnetic applications [1–3]. In the area of MOF compounds, there has been a growing interest in studying on rare-earth compounds for interesting lumi- nescence properties. Lanthanide compounds exhibit intense luminescence and are useful in biochemical ﬂuorescent probes in addition to other emission based applications [4–6]. In all the compounds, the f electron remains highly localized and the emission behavior of the rare-earth ions, based on the f-f transitions, have narrow wavelength ranges and high quantum yields, which make them attractive for light emitting device (LED) applications. The f-f transi- tions are spin and parity forbidden, and to exploit the luminescent properties, ligands that function as sensitizers are employed. Recent studies show that benzoic acid and its derivatives offer an excellent choice to sensitize and observe the lanthanide emission. Among the lanthanide ions, Eu3? is one of the most important elements to use as optical centers. Eu3? compounds are attractive for use in the visible region [7–10]. Despite the vast advances made in the understanding of the optical properties of the rare- earth ions, the subtle relationship that exists between the photophysical behavior and the structure points towards the need to explore many new structures for fruitfully exploiting the emission property of the rare-earth ions [11, 12]. In light of this, the recently discovered rare-earth benzene carboxylates are good candidates to investigate both the structure as well as the luminescent properties [13]. Lanthanide ions with high and variable coordination numbers and ﬂexible coordination environments have led to a limited success in the design of molecular architectures with predetermined structures [14]. During the course of such investigations, we have now discovered a novel europium coordination polymer, [Eu2(phen)2(BIPA)3]2H2O (1) with 3-D six-connected a-Po structures.

Solvents were puriﬁed according to the standard methods. C, H and N analyses were made on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer at the analysis center of Nanjing University. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded in the range 4000– 400 cm-1 on a Bruker Vector22 FT-IR spectrophotometer by using KBr discs. The luminescent spectra for the solid samples were recorded at the room temperature on an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrophotometer with xenon arc lamp as the light source. In the measurements of the emission and excitation spectra, the pass width was 5.0 nm. Synthesis of Complex 1 A mixture containing Eu(NO3)36H2O (0.05 mmol), H2BIPA (0.075 mmol), phen (0.05 mmol), NaOH(0.075 mmol) dis- solved in 8 ml H2O was sealed in a 16 ml Teﬂon lined stainless steel container and heated at 160 C for 5 days. Colorless block crystals of 1 were washed by water and ethanol several times and collected by ﬁltration with a ﬁeld of 82%. Anal. Calcd. for C48H29Br3Eu2N4O14: C, 40.33; H, 2.04; N, 3.92.

X-Ray Crystallography The crystallographic data collections for complex 1 were carried out on a Bruker Smart Apex II CCD with graphite- monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 293(2) K using the x-scan technique. The data were inte- grated by using the SAINT program [15], which also did the intensities corrected for Lorentz and polarization effect. An empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program [16]. The structures were solved by direct methods using the program SHELXS-97 and all non- hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically on F2 by the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXL-97 crystallographic software package [17, 18]. The hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically. All calculations were performed on a personal computer with the SHELXL-97 crystallographic software package [18]. The details of the crystal parameters, data collection and reﬁnement for four compounds are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bong angles for complex 1 are listed in Table 2. Results and Discussion Crystal Structure of Complex 1 Complex 1 is stable in air and insoluble in water and in common organic solvents. High yields of the target com- plex indicate that it is thermodynamically stable under the prevailing reaction conditions. In an asymmetric unit of 1, there are two crystallo- graphically independent Eu ions, three BIPA ligands, two coordinated phen molecules and two free water molecules. Figure 1 presents the coordination characteristics of Eu1 and Eu2. The coordination number of Eu1 is eight, while that of Eu2 is nine. The geometry around the Eu1 center can be described as a distorted bicapped prism, and it is coordinated by six oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O5A, O6A, O9A and O10A) from different BIPA ligands, two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2) from a phen molecule. The Eu1–O and Eu1–N bonds distances are in the range of 2.333(3)– 2.456(3) and 2.588(4)–2.621(4) A˚ , respectively. Two nitrogen atoms (N3 and N4) belonging to phen, seven BIPA oxygen atoms (O3, O4, O7, O8, O11, O12 and O11A) are ligated to the Eu2 center to form a distorted Table 1 Crystallographic data for complex 1 1 Empirical formula C48H29Br3Eu2N4O14 Formula weight 1429.40 Crystal system Triclinic Space group Pı¯ a (A˚ ) 12.847(4) b (A˚ ) 14.519(5) c (A˚ ) 14.741(5) a (deg) 105.293(12) b (deg) 114.991(7) c (deg) 90.503(14) V (A˚ 3) 2381.1(14) Z 2 Dcalc (g/cm-3) 1.997 l (mm-1) 5.200 T (K) 200 F(000) 1380 Reﬂections collected 22643 Unique reﬂections 10680 Rint 0.0686 Goodness-of-ﬁt on F2 1.092 R1 a/wR2 b [I [ 2r (I)] 0.0397/0.0832 R1/wR2 [all data] 0.0527/0.0940 Largest difference peak and hole (e A˚ -3) 1.087/-1.365 a R = R||Fo| - |Fc||/R|Fo|. b Rw = |Rw(|Fo|2 - |Fc|2|/R|w(Fo)2|1/2, where w = 1/[r2(Fo)2 ?

The Eu2–O and Eu2–N bonds distances are in the range of 2.385(3)–2.572(3) and 2.621(4)– 2.659(4) A˚ respectively, and slightly longer that those in Eu1. All bond lengths are in good agreement with those found in the other Eu-containing coordination frameworks [19]. Two Eu1 atoms are bridged by four BIPA carboxyl group to generate a dinuclear Eu2 fragment with a Eu1-Eu1 distance of 4.337 A˚ , which joins six BIPA in an g1:g1:l2 mode to furnish the six-connected secondary building unit (SBU). On the other hand, two Eu2 atoms are linked by four BIPA carboxyl group to produce a dinuclear Eu2 fragment with a Eu2-Eu2 distance of 4.011 A˚ , which joins six BIPA in g1:g1:l2 and g2:g1:l3 mode to furnish the six- connected secondary building unit (SBU). Consequently, a 3D Eu-containing framework structure is built, where each SBU connects six neighboring SBUs in six directions (Fig. 2). For clarity, we use the topological method to analyze this 3D framework: the six-connected SBU is viewed to be six- connected node; furthermore, based on the consideration of Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles (deg) for 1 Eu(1)–O(9)#1 2.333(3) Eu(1)–O(5)#2 2.358(3) Eu(1)–O(6)#3 2.363(3) Eu(1)–O(10)#4 2.376(3) Eu(1)–O(2) 2.423(3) Eu(1)–O(1) 2.456(3) Eu(1)–N(1) 2.588(4) Eu(1)–N(2) 2.621(4) Eu(2)–O(8)#5 2.385(3) Eu(2)–O(4) 2.387(3) Eu(2)–O(12) 2.405(3) Eu(2)–O(11)#5 2.406(3) Eu(2)–O(7) 2.529(3) Eu(2)–O(3) 2.543(3) Eu(2)–O(8) 2.572(3) Eu(2)–N(3) 2.621(4) Eu(2)–N(4) 2.659(4) O(9)#1–Eu(1)– O(5)#2 77.94(13) O(9)#1–Eu(1)– O(6)#3 79.04(12) O(5)#2–Eu(1)– O(6)#3 125.31(12) O(9)#1–Eu(1)– O(10)#4 125.51(12) O(5)#2–Eu(1)– O(10)#4 76.89(13) O(6)#3–Eu(1)– O(10)#4 77.60(13) O(9)#1–Eu(1)–O(2) 84.32(12) O(5)#2–Eu(1)–O(2) 80.20(13) O(6)#3–Eu(1)–O(2) 144.76(13) O(10)#4–Eu(1)–O(2) 136.29(12) O(9)#1–Eu(1)–O(1) 132.71(11) O(5)#2–Eu(1)–O(1) 74.08(12) O(6)#3–Eu(1)–O(1) 147.99(11) O(10)#4–Eu(1)–O(1) 83.86(12) O(2)–Eu(1)–O(1) 54.06(11) O(9)#1–Eu(1)–N(1) 142.57(13) O(5)#2–Eu(1)–N(1) 139.48(13) O(6)#3–Eu(1)–N(1) 76.00(12) O(10)#4–Eu(1)–N(1) 75.30(12) O(2)–Eu(1)–N(1) 100.57(12) O(1)–Eu(1)–N(1) 74.16(11) O(9)#1–Eu(1)–N(2) 82.45(13) O(5)#2–Eu(1)–N(2) 152.12(14) O(6)#3–Eu(1)–N(2) 68.92(14) O(10)#4–Eu(1)–N(2) 130.96(12) O(2)–Eu(1)–N(2) 78.30(13) O(1)–Eu(1)–N(2) 106.45(13) N(1)–Eu(1)–N(2) 62.75(13) O(8)#5–Eu(2)–O(4) 144.38(11) O(8)#5–Eu(2)–O(12) 75.12(11) O(4)–Eu(2)–O(12) 83.65(12) O(8)#5–Eu(2)– O(11)#5 73.40(11) O(4)–Eu(2)–O(11)#5 137.34(11) O(12)–Eu(2)– O(11)#5 136.92(11) O(8)#5–Eu(2)–O(7) 122.40(12) O(4)–Eu(2)–O(7) 79.55(12) O(12)–Eu(2)–O(7) 78.56(13) O(11)#5–Eu(2)–O(7) 94.33(13) O(8)#5–Eu(2)–O(3) 156.48(11) O(4)–Eu(2)–O(3) 53.27(11) O(12)–Eu(2)–O(3) 128.30(11) O(11)#5–Eu(2)–O(3) 85.15(11) O(7)–Eu(2)–O(3) 67.74(12) O(8)#5–Eu(2)–O(8) 72.06(11) O(4)–Eu(2)–O(8) 125.83(11) O(12)–Eu(2)–O(8) 68.48(11) O(11)–Eu(2)–O(8) 74.29(11) O(7)–Eu(2)–O(8) 50.68(11) O(3)–Eu(2)–O(8) 111.76(10) O(8)#5–Eu(2)–N(3) 96.38(12) O(4)–Eu(2)–N(3) 80.85(13) O(12)–Eu(2)–N(3) 138.53(12) O(11)#5–Eu(2)–N(3) 74.01(12) O(7)–Eu(2)–N(3) 134.83(13) O(3)–Eu(2)–N(3) 67.88(12) O(8)–Eu(2)–N(3) 148.20(12) O(8)#5–Eu(2)–N(4) 71.91(12) O(4)–Eu(2)–N(4) 75.60(12) O(12)–Eu(2)–N(4) 76.70(12) O(11)#5–Eu(2)–N(4) 119.16(12) O(7)–Eu(2)–N(4) 146.51(14) O(3)–Eu(2)–N(4) 112.20(12) O(8)–Eu(2)–N(4) 134.86(12) N(3)–Eu(2)–N(4) 62.25(13) Note: Symmetry codes: #1, x - 1, y, z - 1; #2, x, y, z - 1; #3,-x, -y, 1 - z; #4, 1 - x, -y, 1-z; #5, 1 - x, 1 - y, 2 - z Fig. 1 Perspective view of the coordination environment of the Eu ions in 1 at 30% probability J Chem Crystallogr (2010) 40:283–287 285 123 geometry of this node, this 3D frame is classiﬁed to be an a-Po net with 41263 topology (Fig. 3). FT-IR Spectroscopy The IR spectrum of complex 1 (Fig. S1) indicates the com- plete deprotonation due to the absence of the absorption peak at 1700 cm-1. Furthermore, the absorption peaks of 1547 cm-1 and 1411 cm-1 show the typical antisymmetric and symmetric stretching bands of carboxylate groups. The respective values of (tasym(COO-)-tsym(COO-)) suggest that the carboxylate group adopts three coordination modes, which are in agreement with the observed X-ray structure [20]. In addition, a strong and broad band has been observed at 3428 cm-1, and assigned to t(OH) absorption with the hydrogen bonds. Photoluminescent Property The solid state luminescent spectra of 1 showed the excellent luminescent properties of the EuIII ions. The emission spectrum of 1 at room temperature upon excitation at 394 nm displays intense red luminescence and exhibits the charac- teristic transition of 5D0 ? 7FJ(J = 0–4) of the EuIII ions (Fig. 4). The 5D0 ? 7F2 transition centered at 616 nm is clearly stronger than the 5D0 ? 7F1 transition centered at 589 nm,whichindicatesthe absence ofinversion symmetryat the EuIII site. The appearance of the symmetry-forbidden emission 5D0 ? 7F0 at 576 nm indicates that EuIII ions in 1 exist in a non-centrosymmetric ligand ﬁeld. The most intense red emission of the 5D0 ? 7F2 transition is very sharp, sug- gesting that the mixed ligands are suitable for the sensibilityof red luminescence for the EuIII ion [21]. Conclusions Insummary,a novel three-dimensionalcoordinationpolymer, [Eu2(phen)2(BIPA)3]2H2O (1), has been synthsized by the reaction 5-bromoisophthalicacidwith Eu(NO3)36H2O under the hydrothermal condition. The two Eu1 atoms are bridged by four BIPA carboxyl group to generate a dinuclear Eu2 fragment, which joins six BIPA to furnish the six-connected secondary building unit (SBU).
