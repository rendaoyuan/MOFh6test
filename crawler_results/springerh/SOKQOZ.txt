Complexes 1–3 exhibit three- dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs); 1 and 2 are assemblies of the same secondary building units (SBUs), linear inﬁnite chains {Mn(CO2)2}n, forming one- dimensional channel, while complex 3 is constructed by trinuclear clusters {Mn3(CO2)6} SBUs. Magnetic proper- ties of complexes 1 and 3 are also discussed with respect to the bridging mode of the carboxylate groups. Introduction In the past decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to extended metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on coordination polymers because of their fascinating archi- tectures and unexpected properties for potential applications in many ﬁelds, such as gas storage, ion exchange, catalysis, magnetism, and optoelectronic devices [1–6]. The self- assembly of MOFs through the deliberate selection of functionalized organic ligands and metal centers is consid- ered an efﬁcient way to construct one- to three-dimensional architectures with versatile topologies, and desirable phys- ical and chemical properties. Rigid polycarboxylates as anionic linkers are particularly attractive due to their high symmetry and structural predictability. For example, 1,4- benzenedicarboxylate, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate [7–9], and 2,6-naphthlalenedicarboxylate (ndc) have been widely applied in constructing the MOFs. Especially, ndc has been found to be a good candidate to fabricate porous networks with larger cavities, or channels, since it can provide longer linker, and there are a number of assemblies based on ndc ligand with lanthanide, zinc, and nickel in the literature [10–12]. It is worth noting that interpenetration often occurs when using long linkers for the design of the framework with large pores. For example, 3D networks of complexes [Zn2(ndc)2L] and [Co3(ndc) 3L01.5] exhibit two- and three- fold interpenetration, respectively [13, 14]. Generally, interpenetration eliminates most of void spaces of the open frameworks and thus hinders the utilities in terms of porosity. Therefore, how to avoid interpenetration and cre- ate highly porous open framework is still a great challenge. Up to date, several synthetic strategies have been proposed for preventing interpenetration. For example, some approaches, including the adjustment of solvent molecules, counter ions/anions [15–17], the modiﬁcation of ligands [18, 19], low-temperature reaction in nonaqueous media [20], and the use of secondary building units (SBUs) [21, 22] have been proven effective in the preparation of MOFs with non-interpenetration. On the other hand, the incorporation of appropriate auxiliary ligands, such as chelating multipyri- dine ligands 2,20-bipyridine (bpy) and 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) molecules, into metal organic network is also feasible [23]. Since these auxiliary ligands occupy some coordina- tion sites and affect the geometry of metal center ions, they prevent the network from interpenetrating effectively. Y. Jiang (&)  R. Yu  Y.

Three non-interpenetrating manganese coordination poly- mers with a 3D framework were successfully prepared by the hydrothermal method. The magnetic susceptibility measurement suggested that the complexes display anti- ferromagnetic properties. Experimental General marks All chemicals purchased were of analytical grade and used without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were carried out on a Vario ELIII CHN elemental analyzer. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FT- IR360 spectrometer with the samples prepared as a KBr pellet. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility data were collected on polycrystalline samples in the tempera- ture range of 2–300 K with an applied magnetic ﬁeld strength of 1000 Oe using a SQUID magnetometer.

X-ray crystallographic study The single crystal data collection for complexes 1–3 was performed on a Bruker Smart CCD 2000 diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromatized MoKa radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 293(2) K. Data reduction and empiri- cal absorption correction were applied with SMART and SADABS software packages, respectively [24, 25]. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS97 [26] and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F2 with SHELXL97 [26]. All non-hydrogen atoms were deﬁned with anisotropical displacement parameters. The hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically and treated by a mixture of independent and constrained reﬁnement. The carbon atoms C(3)–C(10) of 2,20-bpy molecule in complex 3 are disordered, showing high thermal motion. The crystallographic data for 1–3 are compiled in Table 1. The selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table 2. Results and discussion Description of structures Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that complex 1 is a 3D framework, which was built up from the connection of inﬁnite {Mn(CO2)2}n chains with naphtha- lene rings of the ndc ligand. As shown in Fig. 1a, there is only one metal coordination environment in 1. Each Mn(II) ion located on a two-fold rotation axis is in a severely distorted octahedral coordination geometry, consisting of four oxygen atoms from four different ndc ligands and two nitrogen atoms of one bpy molecule. The Mn–O bond lengths (2.075–2.171 A˚ ) fall within the range of reported values (2.0–2.2 A˚ ) in octahedral Mn(II) complexes, and the Mn–N(bpy) bond length (2.258 A˚ ) is also comparable with 1020 Transition Met Chem (2008) 33:1019–1026 123 known manganous complexes [27]. The cisoid and transoid bond angles around the central Mn(II) ion fall in the regions of 71.30–112.09 and 157.59–167.45, respec- tively. Adjacent Mn(II) ions are doubly bridged by carboxylate groups to form 1D zigzag chains that propa- gate inﬁnitely along the c-axis. The nearest MnMn distance within the chains is 4.498 A˚ (Fig. 1b). The inﬁnite 1D Mn(II) ion chains serve as SBUs, and are further in- terlinked one to another via naphthalene rings of ndc ligands to complete a 3D framework. The resulting Mn– NDC network contains 1D rhombic channels with dimen- sions of ca. 12.108 A˚ along the edge and 17.461 A˚ along the diagonal extending inﬁnitely along the [001] direction. Although the efﬁcient pore size was signiﬁcantly dimin- ished by the protruding bpy molecules, there is still sufﬁcient room for water enclathration. The lattice water molecule donates one hydrogen atom to carboxylate O(1) atom to generate a hydrogen bond (d(OO) = 2.862 A˚ ), which can help stabilize the whole structure. The structure of complex 2 is similar to that of complex 1. The differences between two complexes are the auxiliary ligand and the absence of lattice water molecule in com- plex 2, which do not have signiﬁcant effects on the structure. The Mn(II) ion shows similar coordination environment to that in 1, where Mn–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.076–2.180 A˚ and Mn–N bond distance is 2.290 A˚ . The cisoid and transoid bond angles around central Mn(II) ions are in the range of 71.55–112.70 and 158.10–167.45, respectively. The nearest MnMn dis- tance across the carboxyl is 4.557 A˚ , which is slightly longer than that in complex 1. All phen rings are parallel to each other, and the nearest face-to-face distance is 3.30 A˚ , which indicates the presence of p–p stacking interactions. The fundamental building unit of complex 3 is com- posed of three Mn(II) ions, three ndc ligands, and one bpy molecule. The structure of 3 contains two crystallograph- ically independent Mn(II) ions with different octahedral coordination geometries. As depicted in Fig. 2a, Mn(1) is coordinated to four oxygen atoms from three ndc ligands and two pyridyl nitrogen atoms of one bpy molecule. Most of the Mn–O and Mn–N bond lengths match well with those in complexes 1 and 2 except the Mn(1)–O(3) bond distance (2.387 A˚ ), which is signiﬁcantly longer than other Mn–O distances owing to the tridentate carboxylate coor- dination. The coordination geometry of Mn(1) is severely distorted from a regular octahedron, as seen from the bond Table 1 Crystal data for complexes 1–3 R1 = R||Fo| - |Fc||/R|Fo|, wR2 = {Rw(Fo 2 - Fc 2)2/ R[w(Fo 2)2]} Compound 1 2 3 Empirical formula C22H16MnN2O5 C24H14MnN2O4 C56H34Mn3N4O12 Formula weight 443.31 449.31 1169.69 Temperature (K) 293(2) 293(2) 293(2) Wavelength [A˚ ] 0.71073 0.71073 0.71073 Crystal system Monoclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Space group C2/c C2/c C2/c a [A˚ ] 21.009(1) 21.514(1) 21.081(1) b [A˚ ] 12.045(1) 11.510(1) 13.698(1) c [A˚ ] 7.318(1) 7.452(1) 17.531(1) a [] 90 90 90 b [] 99.247(1) 99.322(1) 94.734(1) c [] 90 90 90 V [A˚ 3], Z 1827.8(2), 4 1820.9(2), 4 5045.0(4), 4 Dc [g cm-3] 1.611 1.639 1.474 l [mm-1] 0.763 0.763 0.808 F(000) 908 916 2276 Theta range for data collection () 1.96–28.19 1.92–27.99 1.77–28.24 Limiting indices -24 B h B 27 -28 B h B 28 -27 B h B 27 -12 B k B 15 -15 B k B 14 -18 B k B 17 -9 B l B 9 -9 B l B 9 -23 B l B 23 Reﬂection unique 2138 2127 5947 Goodness-of-ﬁt on F2 1.151 1.073 1.074 Final R indices [I [ 2r(I)] R1 = 0.0439 R1 = 0.0443 R1 = 0.0458 wR2 = 0.1029 wR2 = 0.1105 wR2 = 0.1281 R indices (all data) R1 = 0.0470 R1 = 0.0493 R1 = 0.0497 wR2 = 0.1045 wR2 = 0.1137 wR2 = 0.1308 Transition Met Chem (2008) 33:1019–1026 1021 123 angles of O–Mn(1)–O (56.37–152.17), O–Mn(1)–N (82.48–166.21), and N–Mn(1)–N (71.66). Mn(1A) is equivalent to Mn(1) with respect to the inversion symme- try. Each Mn(2) atom locates in an inversion center, and is coordinated by six oxygen atoms from six carboxylate groups to complete a slightly distorted octahedron. The cisoid bond angles about the central Mn(2) atoms are in the regions 88.87–91.13, and the transoid ones are in 180. Mn(2) octahedra are each connected by two adjacent Mn(1) octahedra via sharing a vertex and three carboxylate groups with MnMn separation of 3.495 A˚ . This con- nectivity leads to a linear trinuclear {Mn3(CO2)6} cluster that can be viewed as a six-connected SBU (Fig. 2b). The SBUs are interlinked by naphthalene rings, resulting in 2D Table 2 Selected bond lengths [A˚ ] and angles [] for complexes 1–3 a Symmetry code: #1 - x ? 2, y, -z ? 3/2 b Symmetry codes: #1 - x ? 1, y, -z ? 3/2; #2x, -y, z ? 1/2; #3 - x ? 1, -y, -z ? 1 c Symmetry code: #1 - x ? 1/2, -y ? 1/2, -z Complex 1a Mn(1)–O(1) 2.171(2) Mn(1)–N(1) 2.258(2) Mn(1)–O(2) 2.075(2) O(1)–Mn(1)–O(2) 101.12(6) O(2)–Mn(1)–N(1)#1 89.04(7) O(1)–Mn(1)–N(1) 87.23(6) N(1)–Mn(1)–O(1)#1 82.57(6) O(1)–Mn(1)–O(1)#1 167.45(9) N(1)–Mn(1)–O(2)#1 89.04(7) O(1)–Mn(1)–O(2)#1 85.94(6) N(1)–Mn(1)–N(1)#1 71.30(9) O(1)–Mn(1)–N(1)#1 82.57(6) O(1)#1–Mn(1)–O(2)#1 101.12(6) O(2)–Mn(1)–N(1) 157.59(7) O(1)#1–Mn(1)–N(1)#1 87.23(6) O(2)–Mn(1)–O(1)#1 85.94(6) O(2)#1–Mn(1)–N(1)#1 157.60(7) O(2)–Mn(1)–O(2)#1 112.09(10) Complex 2b Mn(1)–O(1)#2 2.180(2) Mn(1)–N(1) 2.290(2) Mn(1)–O(2) 2.076(2) O(2)–Mn(1)–O(2)#1 112.70(10) O(2)#–Mn(1)–N(1)#1 158.10(7) O(2)–Mn(1)–O(1)#2 86.35(7) O(1)#–Mn(1)–O(1)#3 166.62(8) O(2)–Mn(1)–O(1)#3 101.12(7) O(1)#2–Mn(1)–N(1) 83.59(6) O(2)–Mn(1)–N(1) 158.10(7) O(1)#2–Mn(1)–N(1)#1 85.57(6) O(2)–Mn(1)–N(1)#1 88.35(6) O(1)#3–Mn(1)–N(1) 85.57(6) O(2)#1–Mn(1)–O(1)#2 101.12(7) O(1)#3–Mn(1)–N(1)#1 83.59(6) O(2)#1–Mn(1)–O(1)#3 86.35(7) N(1)–Mn(1)–N(1)#1 71.55(9) O(2)#1–Mn(1)–N(1) 88.35(6) Complex 3c Mn(1)–O(1) 2.200(2) Mn(1)–N(2) 2.213(2) Mn(1)–O(2) 2.059(2) Mn(2)–O(1) 2.182(1) Mn(1)–O(3) 2.387(2) Mn(2)–O(5) 2.123(2) Mn(1)–O(4) 2.068(2) Mn(2)–O(6) 2.155(2) Mn(1)–N(1) 2.263(2) O(1)–Mn(1)–O(2) 108.52(7) O(1)–Mn(2)–O(5) 91.13(6) O(1)–Mn(1)–O(3) 56.37(6) O(1)–Mn(2)–O(6) 90.04(6) O(1)–Mn(1)–O(4) 96.87(7) O(1)–Mn(2)–O(1)#1 180.0(1) O(1)–Mn(1)–N(1) 84.04(7) O(1)–Mn(2)–O(5)#1 88.87(6) O(1)–Mn(1)–N(2) 140.55(7) O(1)–Mn(2)–O(6)#1 89.96(6) O(2)–Mn(1)–O(3) 99.53(8) O(5)–Mn(2)–O(6) 89.53(7) O(2)–Mn(1)–O(4) 96.26(8) O(5)–Mn(2)–O(1)#1 88.87(6) O(2)–Mn(1)–N(1) 166.21(8) O(5)–Mn(2)–O(5)#1 180.0(1) O(2)–Mn(1)–N(2) 94.67(8) O(5)–Mn(2)–O(6)#1 90.47(7) O(3)–Mn(1)–O(4) 152.17(7) O(6)–Mn(2)–O(1)#1 89.96(6) O(3)–Mn(1)–N(1) 82.48(8) O(6)–Mn(2)–O(5)#1 90.47(7) O(3)–Mn(1)–N(2) 89.25(8) O(6)–Mn(2)–O(6)#1 180.0(1) O(4)–Mn(1)–N(1) 87.60(9) O(1)#1–Mn(2)–O(5)#1 91.13(6) O(4)–Mn(1)–N(2) 112.19(8) O(1)#1–Mn(2)–O(6)#1 90.04(6) N(1)–Mn(1)–N(2) 71.66(8) O(5)#1–Mn(2)–O(6)#1 89.53(7) 1022 Transition Met Chem (2008) 33:1019–1026 123 gridlike layers containing rhombic apertures extended along the (001) plane (Fig. 2c). Within the grid, the naphthalene rings propagate along the [010] and [110] directions, leading to the average MnMn separation across two ndc ligands being 13.22 and 12.48 A˚ , respec- tively. The adjacent 2D layers are then pillared by the naphthalene rings of other ndc ligands along the [001] direction to form a 3D framework with an average MnMn distance of 9.33 A˚ . The 3D framework displays three kinds of naphthalene rings that meet across at trinu- clear {Mn3(CO2)6} clusters, forming dihedral angles of 26.69, 27.27, and 44.53 with each other, respectively. Being similar to complex 1, the terminal bpy molecules coordinate to Mn(1) ions and ﬁll most of the void volume in the structure. In the complexes 1–3, there are two types of ndc ligands, which are distinguished by their bridging mode. Both carboxylato groups, R-CO2 -, of ndc ligands in complex 1 act as bridging bidentate in syn–anti conﬁguration (see Scheme 1a). The oxygen atoms of each carboxylato group link to two consecutive Mn(II) ions to form 1D metal carboxylate chains. Two of the ndc ligands in complex 3 act as the bis(bidentate) bridge as found in 1 and 2, while in the third one each carboxylato groups adopt the tridentate bridging mode (see Scheme 1b). The tridentate carboxylate chelates Mn(1) and bridges a neighboring Mn(2) in the syn–syn fashion. Such a coordination mode of ndc ligand is also observed in europium-ndc coordination polymers [10]. Magnetic properties The plot of temperature dependence of susceptibilities vm for complex 1 is shown in Fig. 3. The magnetic suscepti- bility data of 1 obey the Curie–Weiss law.

The value of C is slightly smaller than the value of 4.38 cm3 K mol-1 expected for spin only Mn(II) ions with S = 5/2. The negative Weiss constant indicates an antiferromagnetic interaction between the neighboring Mn(II) ions. In addition, the magnetic susceptibility vm exhibits a maximum at ca. 10 K, indicating a 1D long- range antiferromagnetic ordering. This magnetic behavior is similar to at reported Mn pseudo-chain structure [28]. In light of the structural data, the dominant magnetic inter- action for complex 1 should occur along the double syn– anti carboxylate bridges, and it can be treated as a 1D uniform chain along the c axis. Thus, the expression in the literature [29] for modeling a homonuclear uniform chain was used to ﬁt its experimental data (see Eq. 1), in which J represents the coupling interaction between adjacent Mn(II) ions in the [Mn(CO2)2]n chain. vchain ¼ Ng2b2 kT   A þ Bx2   1 þ Cx þ Dx3  1 ð1Þ where A = 2.9167, B = 208.04, C = 15.543, D = 2707.2, and x = |J|/kT. The best ﬁt parameters were obtained by a standard least-square calculation with the value g = 1.90 and J = -0.85 cm-1. J values are small and negative, which indicates the weak antiferromagnetic interactions of Mn(II) ions within the chain [Mn(CO2)2]n. The plot of temperature dependence of magnetic sus- ceptibilities vm of complex 3 is depicted in Fig. 4. Above 20 K, the vm -1 versus T curve is almost linear and obeys the Curie–Weiss law, giving a Curie constant C of 13.26 cm3 K mol-1 and a Weiss constant h of -22 K. The result suggests the presence of antiferromagnetic interac- tions between the neighboring Mn(II) ions. The vmT product at room temperature of complex 3 has a value of 12.24 cm3 K mol-1, which is slightly less than the value of 13.06 cm3 K mol-1 expected for three magnetically iso- lated Mn(II) ions (S = 5/2). In complex 3, the Mn(II) ions are grouped into trimers, linked by four l2 and two l3 bridging carboxylate groups in syn–anti and syn–syn fashions. The trimers are isolated at an average distance of 11.7 A˚ by ndc ligands. From the view of magnetism, the sample can be treated as a linear trimer. Thus, a model containing a linear Mn3 system was used for ﬁtting the experimental magnetic data of 3 by invoking a coupling pathway through the carboxylate bridges, in which J rep- resents the coupling interaction between adjacent Mn(II) ions (see Eq. 2) [30]. It is reasonable to ignore the mag- netic interaction between isolated Mn3 units due to the ndc Fig. 4 The temperature dependence of the susceptibilities vm for complex 3.

The value of J(1) is comparable to that of previously reported Mn(II) complex with similar carboxylate bridge mode, despite the MnMn distances being different [31]. T. Nagata etc. have compared the magnetic coupling interaction strength in various carboxylate-bridged Mn(II) complexes and summarized them in the following order: syn–anti l2-car- boxylate bridge \ l1,1-carboxylate bridge (monatomic) \ syn–syn l2-carboxylate bridge [32]. The magnitude in the absolute value |J|(1) is less than |J|(3), which is in good agreement with this rule. Therefore, the smaller |J| value of 1 is reasonably attributed to the syn–anti bridging mode of the carboxylate group, while stronger magnetic coupling interaction in 3 is due to the double l2 and one l3 carboxylate bridges in both syn–anti and syn–syn fashions. Conclusions In this paper, we have prepared and structurally character- ized three new 3D coordination polymers based on manganese(II) and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate, [Mn(ndc)- (bpy)]n  n(H2O) (1), [Mn(ndc)(phen)]n (2), and [Mn3(ndc)3- (bpy)2]n (3). Complexes 1–3 exhibit three-dimensional metal-organic frameworks constructed by secondary build- ing units (SBUs), 1D linear inﬁnite trains {Mn(CO2)2}n in 1 and 2, and linear trinuclear cluster {Mn3(CO2)6}in 3. The introduction of terminal ligands 2,20-bpy and phen leads to the formation of SBUs, which are successful in preventing the frameworks from interpenetrating. Magnetic character- ization indicates that the title complexes behave antiferromagnetically at low temperature and the magnetic ordering is strongly related to the bridging fashion of the carboxylate groups.
