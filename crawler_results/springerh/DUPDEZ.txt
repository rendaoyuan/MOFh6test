Manuscript Polyatomic anion versus acetonitrile in coordinating ability: structural properties of AgX-bearing 1,4-bis(2- isonicotinoyloxyethyl)piperazine (X2 5 NO3 2, CF3SO3 2, ClO4 2, BF4 2, and PF6 2) Chi Won Kim • Jungmin Ahn • Sung Min Kim • Tae Hwan Noh • Ok-Sang Jung Received: 13 April 2011 / Accepted: 6 May 2011 / Published online: 26 May 2011  The Author(s) 2011. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract Type studies on competitive polyatomic anion versus acetonitrile coordination in the self-assembly of a series of [Ag2(X)m(bip)(NCCH3)n](X)2-m (X- = NO3 -, CF3SO3 -, ClO4 -, BF4 -, and PF6 -; m = 0, 2; n = 0, 2, 4; bip = 1,4-bis(2-isonicotinoyloxyethyl)piperazine) were carried out. Each bip spacer acts as an N4 tetradentate ligand and is linked to four silver(I) centers through two pyridine and two piperazine moieties, producing a double strand consisting of two 20-membered ring units. The coordinating environment around the silver(I) center is subtly determined by the competition of the polyatomic anions with acetonitrile, that is, by the AgNCCH3 versus AgX interactions. The coordinating ability of acetonitrile is inversely proportional to the order of the coordination ability of the Hoffmeister series of polyatomic anions, NO3 -  CF3SO3 - [ ClO4 - [ BF4 -  PF6 -. Introduction Fascinating diverse coordination skeletons have been designed andconstructedvia the self-assemblyof basic componentswith varied properties such as metal center geometry, the binding sites of donating atoms and the lengths of spacers, and/or by the induction of weak intra- or intermolecular interactions [1–5]. Research on the rational design of coordination polymers is a fruitful ﬁeld: polymers have various potential applications in molecular separation, toxic materials adsorption, molecular containers, ion exchangers, molecular recognition, and luminescent sensors [6–10]. In order to effectively construct desirable coordination materials with task-speciﬁc motifs, the delicate coordination geometry around the central metal needs ﬁrst to be considered [11–13]. Anion coordination chemistry is an emerging topic of interest, particularly from environmental pollution, indus- trial chemical, biological process, ionic liquid, catalysis, lithium battery, and health-related perspectives [14–17]. Recent and promising anion chemistry advances have been made in anion template assembly, ion-pair recognition, and anion functionality [17–20]. Some polyatomic anions in fact play crucial roles in the self-assembly of coordination materials, owing to attributes such as negative charge, a wide range of geometries, signiﬁcant solvent effects, and pH dependence [21–23]. However, precise control of coordination geometry via (counter)anions remains a rare achievement, due to less effective electrostatic binding interactions. Our previous results on silver(I) complexes revealed a variable skeletal structure, labile anion exchange [4, 5], and a variety of silver(I) coordination geometries [24]. In the present study, for the purposes of elucidating the direct role and coordinating nature of polyatomic anions, the self-assembly of an AgX (X- = NO3 -, CF3SO3 -, ClO4 -, BF4 -, and PF6 -) series with 1,4-bis(2-isonicotinoyloxy- ethyl)piperazine (bip) as a function of the polyatomic anions and temperature was investigated. We discuss, here, the competitive polyatomic anion versus acetonitrile coordina- tion that is the basis of that self-assembly.

Elemental microanalyses were performed on crystalline samples (C, H, N) by the Pusan Center at KBSI using a Vario-EL III. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury Plus 300 operating at 300 and 75 MHz, respec- tively, and the chemical shifts were relative to the internal Me4Si. Infrared spectra were obtained on a Nicolet 380 FTIR spectrophotometer using samples prepared as KBr pellets. The melting points were determined with a Tho- mas-Hoover capillary melting point apparatus and were not corrected. Synthesis of 1,4-bis(2-isonicotinoyloxyethyl)piperazine (bip) Triethylamine (3.48 mL, 25 mmol) was added to a solution of isonicotinoyl chloride hydrochloride (1.958 g, 11 mmol) in chloroform (100 mL) at room temperature. Subsequently, 1,4-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine (0.871 g, 5 mmol) was added to the reaction solution, which was reﬂuxed for 12 h. The chloroform solution was successively washed with a 0.5 N NaOH solution, after which it was dried using magnesium sulfate and ﬁltered. Evaporation of the sol- vent produced crystalline 1,4-bis(2-isonicotinoyloxyethyl) piperazine in 82% yield. M.p. 129–131 C. Anal. Calc for C20H24N4O4: C 62.5; H 6.3; N 14.6.

Thirty-six frames of two dimensional diffraction images were collected and processed to obtain the cell parameters and orientation matrix. The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects, and the absorption effects were corrected using the multi-scan method. The structures were resolved by the direct method (SHELXS 97) and reﬁned using full-matrix least squares techniques (SHELXL 97) [27, 28]. The non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically, and the hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and reﬁned using a riding model. The crystal parameters and procedural information corresponding to the data collection and structure reﬁne- ment are listed in Table 1. Results and discussion Construction and crystal structures The reaction of AgX (X- = NO3 -, CF3SO3 -, ClO4 -, BF4 -, and PF6 -) with 1,4-bis(2-isonicotinoyloxyethyl)- piperazine (bip) in ethanol produced solid crude products (Scheme 1). These were recrystallized from acetonitrile to obtain single crystals of 2:1 (Ag/bip) complexes in high yields. All of the crystalline products are insoluble in water, chloroform, acetone, and alcohol, but soluble in acetoni- trile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and N,N-dimethylformamide. The products were stable colorless solids for several days even in aqueous suspensions. The IR frequencies of the NO3 -, CF3SO3 -, ClO4 -, BF4 -, and PF6 - appeared at 1365, 1286, 1090, 1065, and 831 cm-1, respectively (Supplementary material). The IR frequency of the ester moiety was in the 1720–1722 cm-1 range. The asymmetric unit and extended structure of [Ag2(CF3SO3)2(bip)(CH3CN)2] are shown in Fig. 1, and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. The local geometry of the silver(I) atom is a four-coordinate arrangement with three nitrogen donors and one oxygen donor (Ag–N(pyridine), 2.152(1) A˚ ; Ag–N(piperazine), Scheme 1 Fig. 1 X-ray structure of [Ag2(CF3SO3)2(bip)(CH3CN)2] with thermal ellipsoids shown at 50% probability (top) and inﬁnite structure (bottom).

Each bip ligand acts as an N4 tetradentate and is linked to the four silver(I) atoms through two pyri- dine and two piperazine moieties, producing a double strand consisting of two 20-membered ring units. The Ag(I)OSO2CF3 - (2.791(1) A˚ ) distance is less than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.20 A˚ ) of Ag and O [29]. Interestingly, one acetonitrile molecule is coordinated with the silver(I) center as a third ligand, and one triﬂate acts as a fourth ligand. The packing structure is depicted in Fig. 2. The structures of [Ag2(ClO4)2(bip)(CH3CN)2] and [Ag2(BF4)2(bip)(CH3CN)2] are very similar to that of [Ag2(CF3SO3)2(bip)(CH3CN)2] except for of the subtly different AgNCCH3 and AgX lengths (Table 2 and Figs. 3, 4). Contrastingly, for [Ag2(NO3)2(bip)], the NO3 - anion acts as a strong ligand (AgO = 2.554(2) A˚ ) rather than a simple counteranion. The bond angle of N–Ag–N (151.52(6)) is, concomitantly, bent. Thus, no acetonitrile is coordinated to the silver(I) center, resulting in tri-coor- dinate silver(I). For [Ag2(bip)(CH3CN)4](PF6)2, two ace- tonitrile ligands are coordinated to one silver(I) center (AgN(acetonitrile) = 2.672(4), 2.736(4) A˚ ) instead of the PF6 - anion. The PF6 - anion is a simple counteranion (the shortest AgF = 4.055(7) A˚ ). For all products, Ag–N(py) is slightly stronger than Ag–N(piperazine). Polyatomic anion effects on construction Our primary strategy was to appropriately combine silver(I) with a bidentate bip ligand. Unlike the case with the 1:1 cyclodimeric species [Ag(bpq)](BF4) (bpq = 2,3- bis(pyridyl)quinoxaline) [30], the present reaction based on our design strategy resulted in the self-assembly of a 2:1 double strand Ag(I) : bip (Scheme 1). The skeletal double strand was efﬁciently constructed irrespective of the reac- tant stoichiometry and concentration. A key driving force of the construction is the potential tetradentate ligation of the bip ligand. The nature of an anion is signiﬁcant to the coordination chemistry of the silver(I) center. For instance, the coordinating nature of NO3 - is an obstacle to the coordination of acetonitrile. Weakly donating anions such as CF3SO3 -, ClO4 -, and BF4 - afford complexes with a single acetonitrile ligand. The PF6 - anion, by contrast, induces two acetonitrile ligands. Thus, construction via coordination can be signiﬁcantly affected by subtle anion differences. These facts are consistent with the Hoffmeister series [31]. A combination of a variety of geometries of silver(I) ions and the appropriate L ligand length, conformation, angle, and steric effects seems to afford characteristic structures of anion-dependent acetonitrile/ silver(I) ratio. That is the acetonitrile/silver(I) ratio is strongly dependent on the nature of the anions. The PF6 - anion, which has been considered as a common ‘‘non- coordinating’’ anion [32], has little tendency to serve as a ligand in the present structure. Such non-coordinating anions afford acetonitrile-abundant products. Alternatively, a relatively coordinating anion, NO3 -, prevents acetonitrile coordination, resulting in a non-acetonitrile product, Table 2 Selected bond distances [A˚ ] and angles [] [Ag2(NO3)2 (bip)] [Ag2(CF3SO3)2 (bip)(CH3CN)2] [Ag2(ClO4)2 (bip)(CH3CN)2] [Ag2(BF4)2 (bip)(CH3CN)2] [Ag2(bip) (CH3CN)4](PF6)2 Ag–X (A˚ ) 2.554(2) 2.791(1) 2.821(3) 2.948(2) 4.055(7) Ag–NCCH3 (A˚ ) 2.794(3) 2.691(2) 2.645(3) 2.672(4), 2.736(4) Ag–N(pyridine) (A˚ ) 2.206(2) 2.152(2) 2.230(2) 2.168(2) 2.198(2) Ag–N(piperazine) (A˚ ) 2.285(2) 2.230(1) 2.264(2) 2.242(2) 2.257(2) N(1) Ag–N(2)0 () 151.52(6) 171.92(6) 159.62(6) 161.11(6) 169.17(9) Fig. 2 Side view (a) and top view (b) of packing structure of [Ag2(CF3SO3)2(bip)(CH3CN)2 Transition Met Chem (2011) 36:545–551 549 123 [Ag2(NO3)2(bip)]. A moderately coordinating anion, meanwhile, produces a single acetonitrile product. Aceto- nitrile/silver(I) ratios are exactly correlative with the order of the coordinating ability of polyatomic anions, reported in our previous paper [31]. Thus, the coordination as well as the local geometries of products appears to be subtly associated with the coordinating nature of the anions. The acetonitrile/silver(I) ratios increase with diminishing coordinating ability of the polyatomic anion (NO3 -  CF3 SO3 - \ ClO4 - \ BF4 -  PF6 -), as shown in Fig. 4. Concomitantly, the ligand conformation in each complex seems to be dependent on the nature of the anions. Thus, a salient feature is that the coordinating ability of polyatomic anions is inversely proportional to that of acetonitrile. Temperature effects In order to clearly understand the temperature effects of coordination, the crystal structure of [Ag2(ClO4)2(bip)- (CH3CN)2] was analyzed at both 170 and 298 K, and the results were compared. All of the crystallographic param- eters, including the cell volume and density, showed sig- niﬁcant 2% differences corresponding to the two temperatures (Table 1). As expected, for AgNCCH3 and AgOClO3 -, the distances (2.691; 2.821 A˚ ) at low tem- perature were shorter than those (2.760; 2.832 A˚ ) at high temperature. The difference in the AgNCCH3 length was the most signiﬁcant. The Ag–N (Py, piperazine) lengths were relatively unaffected by the temperature change. Of course, the temperature effect was less signiﬁcant than the anion effect. Conclusions The results of the present study are a good example of the fact that polyatomic anions are very competitive with acetonitrile in their ligation. Speciﬁcally, the acetonitrile/ silver(I) ratio increases with decreasing coordinating abil- ity. Our results also demonstrate that the present double strand skeleton is very stable against subtle changes in the nature of coordination. The construction and related properties of the molecular double strand could contribute to the construction and development of desirable molecu- lar-based coordination materials.
