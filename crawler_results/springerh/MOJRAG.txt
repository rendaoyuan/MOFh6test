Introduction The rational synthesis of metal-organic coordination polymers (MOCPs) attracts considerable interest, not only because of their potential applications as functional mate- rials [1–7], but also due to their fascinating architectures and topologies [8–10]. The construction of target MOCPs can be rationally designed and realized by judicious selection of various metal ions and organic ligands [11]. Generally, the multidentate organic ligands containing N and/or O donors coordination sites are widely utilized as building blocks in the construction of MOCPs. Among various N/O-donor ligands, pyridyl-amide-based ligands [12–14] have attracted more and more attention in the recent years. The coordination behavior of ﬂexible pyridyl- amide derivatives in MOCPs has been widely investigated by Chen et al. and our group [15–18]. However, the reports on the MOCPs constructed from semi-rigid pyridyl-amide derivatives are relatively limited [19, 20]. As an ongoing effort in pyridyl-amide-based ligands, a semi-rigid tri- pyridyl-bis-amide ligand L was designed and employed to construct the target MOCPs in this work. Comparing with the ﬂexible bis-pyridyl-bis-amide ligands, the L ligand not only has more N-donor coordination sites in the middle junction moiety, but also has a semi-rigid spacer to tune the rigidity of the whole ligand, which may help to construct novel MOCPs. On the other hand, the dicarboxylates, as a kind of typical multidentate O-donor ligand, have been proven to be good candidates for the self assembly of coordination polymers because they can provide both structural scaffolding and necessary charge equalization [21]. Oxalic acid (H2ox), trans- 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (H2chda), 5-methylisoph- thalic acid (H2mip) and 4,40-oxybis(benzoic acid) (H2oba) have been proven to be excellent structural elements owing to Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11243-014-9850-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Hence, in this work, the above four dicarboxylates were selected as the co-ligands to assemble with Co(II) ion and L ligand, aiming at investigating the effect of their rigidity and length on the ﬁnal structures. As a result, four new Co(II) coordination compounds, namely {[Co(L)(ox)]3H2O}n (1), [Co2(L)(chda)2]n (2), {[Co(L)(mip)(H2O)]H2O}n (3) and [Co(L)(oba)]n (4) were obtained under hydrothermal condi- tions. The effects of dicarboxylates with different rigidity and length on the structures of their Co(II) complexes are dis- cussed. In addition, the ﬂuorescence, thermal stability, pho- tocatalytic activity and electrochemical behaviors of the title complexes are reported. Experimental section Materials and general methods All chemicals for syntheses were purchased from commercial sources and were used as received without further puriﬁca- tion. The N-donor ligand L was prepared according to the literature [26]. The infrared (IR) spectra were obtained on a Varian FT-IR 640 spectrometer with KBr pellets in the 400–4,000 cm-1 region. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) investigations were carried out with an Ultima IV with D/teX Ultra diffractometer at 40 kV, 40 mA with Cu Ka (k = 1.5406 A˚ ) radiation. Thermogravimetric data for the complexes were carried out on a Pyris Diamond thermal analyzer. A CHI 440 electrochemical workstation connected to a Digital-586 personal computer was used for control of the electrochemical measurements and for data collection. A conventional three-electrode cell was used at room tempera- ture. The carbon paste electrode bulk-modiﬁed with com- plexes 3–4 (3–4—CPE) was used as the working electrode. An SCE and a platinum wire were used as reference and auxiliary electrodes, respectively. The luminescence spectra were measured on a HITACHI F–4500 Fluorescence Spec- trophotometer. UV–Vis absorption spectra were obtained using a SP-1901 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Preparation of {[Co(L)(ox)]3H2O}n (1) A mixture of CoCl26H2O (0.048 g, 0.2 mmol), L (0.032 g, 0.1 mmol), H2ox (0.014 g, 0.15 mmol), water (8 mL) and NaOH (0.012 g, 0.3 mmol) was placed in a 25-mL Teﬂon reactor. The mixture was heated at 120 C for 4 days, and then the autoclave was gradually cooled to room temperature. Blue block-shaped crystals of 1 were obtained, Yield 0.008 g (8 %). IR (KBr, cm-1): 3444 s, 1674 m, 1612 s, 1554 m, 1486 s, 1338 w, 1263 w, 1128 s, 816 w, 700 m, 619 s. Preparation of [Co2(L)(chda)2]n (2) The same synthetic method as that for 1 was used except that H2ox was replaced by H2chda (0.026 g, 0.15 mmol) and heated at 120 C for 6 days. Purple block-shaped crystals of 2 were gained. Yield: 0.012 g (11 %). IR (KBr, cm-1): 1608 s, 1558 w, 1543 s, 1421 s, 1327 w, 1277 m, 1119 s, 808 w, 769 w, 700 m, 619 m. Preparation of {[Co(L)(mip)(H2O)]H2O}n (3) The same synthetic method as that for 1 was used except that H2ox was replaced by H2mip (0.027 g, 0.15 mmol). Pink block-shaped crystals of 3 were gained. Yield: 0.028 g (27 %). IR (KBr, cm-1): 3437 m, 1699 s, 1614 s, 1587 m, 1553 s, 1427 s, 1366 w, 1294 m, 806 w, 773 m, 727 m, 702 m. Preparation of [Co(L)(oba)]n (4) The same synthetic method as that for 1 was used except that H2ox was replaced by H2oba (0.052 g, 0.2 mmol) and different amount of NaOH (0.016 g, 0.4 mmol). Pink block-shaped crystals of 4 were gained. Yield: 0.038 g (30 %). IR (KBr, cm-1): 1697 w, 1653 m, 1597 s, 1527 s, 1419 s, 1335 w, 1240 s, 1159 s, 877 m, 783 m, 700 m, 661 m, 619 w. Preparation of complexes 3–4 bulk-modiﬁed carbon paste electrodes (3–, 4–CPE) The compounds 3–4 bulk-modiﬁed carbon paste electrodes (3– and 4–CPE) were fabricated by the following steps. Graphite powder (0.50 g) and 3/4 (0.03 g) were ground together with an agate mortar for approximately 30 min to achieve an even, dry mixture; then 0.16 mL parafﬁn oil was added and stirred with a glass rod [27]. The homog- enized mixture was packed into a 3-mm-inner-diameter glass tube, and a copper stick was used as the electrical contact. The surface of the modiﬁed electrodes was pol- ished on a piece of weighing paper to achieve a mirror ﬁnish before use. X-ray crystallographic study Crystallographic data for compounds 1–4 were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX II diffractometer equipped with a CCD area detector and graphite-monochromated Mo Ka (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) by x and h scan mode. The crystal structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS program of the SHELXTL crystallographic soft- ware package and reﬁned by the full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 using the SHELXTL [28]. Non-hydrogen 682 Transition Met Chem (2014) 39:681–690 123 atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic temperature parame- ters. The hydrogen atoms of organic ligands were gener- ated geometrically and reﬁned isotropically. The water molecules were highly disordered and could not be mod- eled properly; thus the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON was applied to remove the contributions to the scattering from the solvent molecules. The amount of water came from the TG experiment. The crystal and reﬁnement data for 1–4 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table S1.

Results and discussion Description of crystal structures of complexes 1–4 {[Co(L)(ox)]3H2O}n (1) Single-crystal X-ray crystallography reveals that coordi- nation polymer 1 is in the monoclinic space group C2/c and shows a 2D layer structure with 4-connected network. As shown in Fig. 2a, 1 consists of one Co(II) ion, one L ligand, one ox anion and three crystalline water molecules. Each Co(II) ion is six-coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four carboxyl groups of two ox anions [Co(1)– O(1)=Co(1)–O(1)A = 2.095(2) A˚ , Co(1)–O(2)B=Co(1)– O(2)C = 2.107(2) A˚ (A: -x ? 1/2, -y ? 1/2, -z ? 1; B: x - 1/2, -y ? 1/2, z - 1/2; C –x ? 1, y, -z ? 3/2)] and two pyridyl nitrogen atoms from two L ligands [Co(1)– N(1) = Co(1)–N(1)A = 2.148(3) A˚ ], showing a CoN2O4 distorted octahedron environment. In 1, the ox anions adopt a l2-bridging coordination mode connecting the Co(II) ions to form a 1D [Co-ox]n linear chain, in which each carboxyl displays a l2–g1:g1, l1–g1:g1 coordination mode (Fig. 1). The CoCo distance bridged by ox is 5.357(5) A˚ (Fig. 2b). The Co(II) ions from these 1D [Co-ox]n chains are further linked by the l2- bridging L ligand to afford a 2D polymeric layer (Fig. 2b), in which the CoCo separation is 7.981(7) A˚ (Fig. S1). From a topological viewpoint, the ox anion connects two Co(II) ions, which can be viewed as a linear linker. The L ligand bridging two Co(II) ions acts as a ‘V’-shape spacer, and the Co(II) ions connecting with two ox anions and two L ligands are regarded as nodes, thus the structure of 1 can be described as a 4-connected network (Fig. 2c). Related but different coordination modes of ox anion have been Table 1 Crystal and reﬁnement data for complexes 1–4 a R1 = R||Fo|–|Fc||/R|Fo|; b wR2 = R[w(Fo 2–Fc 2)2]/ R[w(Fo 2)2]1/2 Complex 1 2 3 4 Empirical formula C19H19N5O9Co C33H33N5O10Co2 C26H23N5O8Co C31H21N5O7Co Formula wt. 520.34 777.50 592.42 634.46 Crystal system Monoclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Space group C2/c C2/c P21/c Pc T (K) 296(2) 296(2) 296(2) 296(2) a (A˚ ) 9.621(1) 21.892(5) 10.014(6) 13.909(1) b (A˚ ) 25.086(3) 20.441(5) 16.115(1) 10.747(1) c (A˚ ) 9.602(1) 8.531(2) 16.580(1) 10.119(1) a () 90 90 90 90 b () 112.263(2) 110.646(4) 105.420(1) 110.040(2) c () 90 90 90 90 V (A˚ 3) 2,144.8(5) 3,572.3(1) 2,579.0(3) 1,420.9(2) Z 4 4 4 2 Dcalc (Mg/m3) 1.611 1.446 1.526 1.483 l/mm-1 0.863 0.990 0.726 0.662 F(000) 1,060 1,600 1,220 650 hmax ( Æ ) 28.30 25.20 25.09 25.00 Rint 0.0446 0.0606 0.0342 0.0239 R1 a [I [ 2r(I)] 0.0513 0.0455 0.0337 0.0459 wR2 b(all data) 0.0853 0.0768 0.0844 0.0995 GOF 1.000 1.001 1.001 1.001 D qmax(e A˚ -3) 0.496 1.697 0.416 0.457 D qmin(e A˚ -3) -0.478 -0.507 -0.237 -0.231 Transition Met Chem (2014) 39:681–690 683 123 observed in [Zn2(L)(OX)2] [L = 1,4-di(1H-imidazol-4- yl)benzene] by Sun et al. [22], in which the two carboxyl groups adopt different coordination modes to connect three Zn(II) atoms: one with a l2–g1:g1, l1–g1:g1-mode and the other one with a l2–g1:g1, l1–g1:g1-mode. However, in complex 1, the two carboxyl groups of the ox anion only adopt a l2–g1:g1, l1–g1:g1 coordination mode connecting two Co(II) ions to display a 1D linear linker. The structural difference may be due to the difference of central metals and N-donor ligands. [Co2(L)(chda)2]n (2) When H2chda was used instead of the H2ox in 1 under similar synthetic conditions, a structurally different complex 2 was obtained.X-ray diffractionanalysisreveals that complex 2 isa 2D network containing dinuclear Co2(CO2)4 paddle-wheel subunits, and in monoclinic crystal system with C2/c space group. As depicted in Fig. 3a, each Co(II) atom is ﬁve-coor- dinated by four oxygen atoms from four carboxylic groups of four chda anions [Co(1)–O(1) = 2.098(5), Co(1)–O(2)A = 2.062(5), Co(1)–O(3)A = 2.013(5), Co(1)–O(4)B = 2.007 (5) A˚ (A: -x ? 3/2, -y ? 1/2, -z ? 1; B: x, y, z ? 1)] and one nitrogen atom from one L ligand (Co(1)–N(1) = 2.083(6) A˚ ) in a CoNO4 distorted squared pyramidal geometry. In complex 2, the chda anions take the l4-bridging bis(bidentate) coordination mode linking neighboring four Co(II) ions to form a [Co–chda]2n 1D double chain (Fig. 3b), in Fig. 1 Coordination modes of CoII ions, L and dicarboxylates in complexes 1–4 Fig. 2 a ORTEP drawing of CoII ion in complex 1 with thermal ellipsoids at 30 % probability. The hydrogen atoms and the water molecules are omitted for clarity (A: –x ? 1/2, –y ? 1/2, –z ? 1; B: x - 1/2, –y ? 1/2, z – 1/2; C –x ? 1, y, –z ? 3/2); b 2D layer of complex 1; c Simpliﬁcation of the structure to a 4-connected network 684 Transition Met Chem (2014) 39:681–690 123 which each carboxyl group adopts a l2–g1:g1, l1–g1:g1 coor- dination mode (Fig. 1) and a paddle-wheel subunit is formed. The CoCo separations are 8.531(2) and 2.790(2) A˚ . These double chains are further linked by L ligands to construct a 2D network (Fig. 3c). In the 2D network, considering the dinuclear Co2(CO2)4 subunits as nodes and keeping the chda anions and L ligandsas‘V’-shapespacers,the2Dnetworkcanbedescribedas a 6-connected network (Fig. 3d). Finally, a 3D supramolecular framework of 2 is generated through the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the oxygen atoms of chda anions and the nitrogen atoms of L ligands [N(2)–H(2B)O(2), NO = 3.02 A˚ ] (Fig. S2). Zheng et al. have reported a (3,5)-connected {[Co(TIPA)(trans-chdc)(H2O)]•H2O}n [TIPA = tris[4- (1Himidazol-1-yl)-phenyl]amine] [23], whose structure can be described as a combination of 2D ? 3D parallel/parallel inclined subpolycatenation and right-handed Co(trans-chdc) helicalchains.However,incomplex 2,pairsofchdaanionswith each carboxyl group adopting a l2–g1:g1, l1–g1:g1 coordination mode link the neighboring four Co(II) ions to construct [Co– chda]2n1Ddimetalchains,whichare further linkedbyLligands to furnish a 2D network. The structural difference may be due to the difference of N-donor ligands. {[Co(L)(mip)(H2O)]H2O}n (3) Single-crystal X-ray crystallography reveals that complex 3 features a 2D wave-like layer with P2(1)/c space group.

The hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity (A: –x ? 3/2, –y ? 1/2, –z ? 1; B: x, y, z ? 1); b the 1D [Co–chda]2n chain containing the Co2(CO2)4 paddle-wheel subunit; c 2D layer of complex 2; d simpliﬁcation of the structure to a 6-connected network Transition Met Chem (2014) 39:681–690 685 123 The asymmetric unit of 3 contains one Co(II) ion, one L ligand, one mip anion, one coordinated water molecule and one crystalline water molecule. As depicted in Fig. 4a, the coordination environment around the Co(II) ion is com- posed of two nitrogen atoms (N(1), N(5)B) from two L ligands, two oxygen atoms (O(1), O(3)A) of two carboxyl groups from two mip anions and one oxygen atom from a coordinated water ligand, exhibiting a distorted CoN2O3 trigonal bipyramid geometry. The Co–O bond distances are 2.051(2) [Co(1)–O(1)], 2.011(2) [Co(1)–O(3)A (A: x ? 1, y, z)] and 2.162(2) A˚ [Co(1)–O(1 W)], and the Co–N bond distances are 2.088(2) [Co(1)–N(1)] and 2.139(2) A˚ [Co(1)–N(5)B (B: –x ? 1, y - 1/2, –z ? 3/2)]. The mip anion adopts a type of bis(monodentate) bridging coordi- nation mode (Fig. 1), with each carboxyl group adopting a l2–g1:g1, l1–g1:g1 coordination mode. Adjacent Co(II) ions are bridged by the mip anions to form a 1D linear chain [Co-mip]n. A structural feature in 3 is the presence of left-handed helical chain, which is constructed by the L ligands and the Co(II) ions (Fig. 4b). These [Co–L]n helical chains are further linked by mip anions from [Co–mip]n chains to furnish a 2D layer structure (Fig. 4c). In the 2D network, if the L ligands and mip anions are considered as spacers, and the Co(II) ions are regarded as nodes, 3 can be described as a 4-connected network (Fig. 4d). Ma et al. have reported a 2D network {[Cd(mip)(1,4-btb)0.5(H2O)]H2O}n [29] [1,4- btb = 1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butane], in which the adjacent CdII ions are bridged by mip anions (with one carboxyl adopting a l2–g1:g1 and the other adopting a l1– g1:g1 coordination mode) to form a 1D ribbon chain con- taining 8- and 16-membered rings. Such 1D chains are further linked by the ﬂexible 1, 4-btb ligands to form a (3, 4)-connected 2D layer. However, in complex 3, the adja- cent Co(II) ions are bridged by L ligands to form a left- helical chain. The two carboxyl groups of mip anions only adopt a type of l1–g1:g0 coordination mode bridging the neighboring helical chains to form a 2D layer. The struc- tural difference may be due to the difference of metals and N-donor ligands. [Co(L)(oba)]n (4) When H2oba was used instead of the H2ox in 1 under similar synthetic conditions, a structurally different com- plex 4 was obtained. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography reveals that complex 4 features a 2D layer structure with Pc space group. As depicted in Fig. 5a, each Co(II) ion is six- coordinated by four oxygen atoms from two carboxylic groups of two oba anions [Co(1)–O(2) = 2.102(4), Co(1)– O(1) = 2.224(4), Co(1)–O(4)A = 2.063(5) and Co(1)– O(5)A = 2.246(5) A˚ (A: x - 1, y, z - 1)] and two nitro- gen atoms from two L ligands [Co(1)–N(1) = 2.105(5) and Co(1)–N(3)B = 2.121(4) A˚ (B: x, y, z ? 1)] in a distorted octahedron geometry. In complex 4, the oba anions only adopt a bis(chelating) l2-bridging mode with each carboxyl group exhibiting a l1– g1:g1 chelating coordination mode connecting the Co(II) ions to form a 1D linear [Co-oba]n chain. These [Co-oba]n chains are further linked by L ligands to furnish a 2D layer structure (Fig. 5d), in which the Co(II) ions are linked by L ligands (via ligation of the middle pyridyl N atom and a terminal pyridyl N atom) to give rise to a 1D right-helical chain [Co–L]n (Fig. 5b), and the L ligands and oba anions alternately connect CoII ions to form 1D left-helical Fig. 4 a The coordination environment of CoII ion in complex 3. The hydrogen atoms and the water molecules are omitted for clarity (A: x ? 1, y, z; B: –x ? 1, y – 1/2, –z ? 3/2); b The 1D [Co–L]n left- handed helix chain; c 2D layer of complex 3; d Simpliﬁcation of the 4-connected network 686 Transition Met Chem (2014) 39:681–690 123 architecture (Fig. 5c). In the 2D network, the Co(II) ion is linked by two L ligands and two oba anions, which can be considered as a 4-connected node. The oba anion connects two Co(II) ions, which can be viewed as a linear linker. The L ligand bridging two Co(II) ions also acts as a linear spacer. Thus, the structure can be classiﬁed as a 4-connected grid network (Fig. 5e). Zheng et al. have reported a 2D to 3D inclined polycatenation network [Co(TPPA)(oba)]n [30] [TPPA = tri(4-pyridylphenyl)amine], in which the TPPA ligands connect neighboring Co ions to build up a 1D chain. The 1D chains are further connected by oba ligands to form a 2D layer, in which one carboxyl group in the oba anion adopts a l1–g1:g0 coordination mode, and the other carboxyl group adopts a l1–g1:g1 coordination mode. However, in complex 4, the carboxyl group of the oba anion only adopts a l1–g1:g1 coordination mode. The structural difference may be due to the different of N-donor ligand. Effect of dicarboxylates on the architectures By tuning the dicarboxylate co-ligands, coordination com- plexes 1–4 with different architectures have been obtained. When a short and rigid dicarboxylate ox anion was used in 1, the Co(II) atom adopts six-coordinated mode with regular octahedral coordination arrangement (Fig. 1). The L ligands adopt a bidentate bridging coordination mode (via ligation of two terminal pyridyl N atoms) to link Co(II) ions into a 1D [Co–L]n wave chain. The ox anion shows a l2-bridging mode with each carboxyl group adopting a l2–g1:g1, l1–g1:g1 bridging coordination mode connecting the adjacent 1D [Co–L]n wave chain to afford a 2D polymeric layer. The nitrogen atoms NN (N1 and N1A) distance of the terminal pyridyl group from L ligand is 8.751(5) A˚ and the dihedral angles between the three pyridyl rings of 9.51 and 9.39, the two oxygen atoms of –C=O group turn the outside orienta- tion. When a semi-rigid dicarboxylate chda was used in 2, the coordination number of the Co(II) atom was 5, which is different from that in 1. Pairs of chda anions show a l4- bridging mode with each carboxyl group adopting a l2–g1:g1 bridging coordination mode connecting adjacent four Co(II) ions to form a [Co–chda]2n 1D dimetal chain. The L ligands adopt the same bidentate bridging coordination mode as that in 1 connecting the 1D dimetal chain to furnish a 2D network. The nitrogen-nitrogen (N1 to N1A) distance of the L ligand and the dihedral angles are 12.758(7) A˚ , 10.46 and 11.34, respectively, the two oxygen atoms of –C=O group turn the inside orientation. When a rigid dicarboxylate mip is used in 3, the Co(II) atom adopts penta-coordinated mode with distorted trigonal bipyramid geometry. The L ligands adopt bidentate bridging coordination mode, with the terminal pyridyl group bridging the Co(II) ions to form a left-helical chain. These helical chains are further linked by mip anions with each carboxyl group adopting a l1–g1:g0 monodentate coordination mode to furnish a 2D network. The corre- sponding nitrogen-nitrogen (N1 to N5) distance of the L ligand and the dihedral angles are 12.748(3) A˚ , 12.55 and 24.55, respectively, the two oxygen atoms of –C=O group turn the inside orientation. However, when a long and semi- rigid dicarboxylate oba was used, a structurally different complex 4 was obtained. The coordination number of the Co(II) atom is 6 in 4.

The hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity (A: x - 1, y, z - 1; B: x, y, z ? 1); b the 1D [Co–L]n right-handed helix chain; c the 1D [oba– Co–L]n left-handed helix chain; d 2D layer of complex 4; e Simpli- ﬁcation of the 4-connected network Transition Met Chem (2014) 39:681–690 687 123 pyridyl group and a terminal pyridyl group (N1 and N3) of L ligands link the Co(II) ions to give rise to a 1D right-helical chain [Co–L]n. The other terminal pyridyl group does not connect with the Co(II) ions. The oba anions with each carboxyl group adopting a l1–g1:g1 chelating coordination mode connect the adjacent helical chains to construct a 2D layer, in which the L ligands and oba anions alternately connect Co(II) ions to form 1D left-helical architecture. The corresponding nitrogen-nitrogen (N1 to N5) distance of the L ligand and the dihedral angles are 12.533(8) A˚ , 25.99 and 87.26, respectively, one of the two oxygen atoms of –C=O group turns the inside orientation and the other turns the outside orientation. The structural diversity of the title compounds can be attributed to the different rigidity, length and coordination characters of the dicarboxylate co-ligands in 1–4. PXRD results of coordination polymers 1–4 In order to conﬁrm the phase purity of the bulk materials, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were car- ried out for complexes 1–4 and are depicted in Fig. S3. The measured powder XRD patterns are in good agreement with the simulated patterns by X-ray single-crystal data, indicating phase purities of the samples. The difference in reﬂection intensities between the simulated and the experimental patterns is due to the different orientation of the crystals in the powder samples [31]. Fluorescence properties of complexes 1–4 The emission spectra of complexes 1–4 and free L ligand have been investigated in the solid state at room temperature under the same experimental conditions, as shown in Fig. 6. Free L exhibits an emission band with a maximum at 432 nm upon excitation at 315 nm. Emission peaks of complexes 1– 4 are found at 412, 398, 400 and 397 nm, respectively (kex = 320). Comparing with the emission of L ligand (p* ? p transition), the emissions of the title complexes exhibit blue-shifts of 20, 34, 32 and 35 nm. The carboxylate ligands show very weak p* ? n transitions and contribute little to the photoluminescence of the title complexes [32]. The different emission positions and intensities of 1–4 may be due to the different coordination environments of the L ligand and Co(II) ions, as well as the different structures caused by different organic dicarboxylates in this work [33]. Thermal stability analysis of 1–4 Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) of complexes 1–4 were performed to investigate their thermal stabilities, which were carried out in the temperature range of 30–800 C under N2 atmosphere, as shown in Fig. S4.The TG curves of complexes 1 and 3 exhibit two obvious weight loss steps. The ﬁrst weight loss of 10.41 % (from 75 to 102 C) and 5.20 % (from 77 to 96 C) for complexes 1 and 3, respectively, is assigned to the elimination of the water molecules (calc.: 10.38, 5.13 % for complexes 1 and 3). The secondweight lossoccurredat 423 C for 1, 392 C for 3, which corresponds to the decomposition of organic components. The TG curves of 2 and 4 only show one- step weight loss process; the overall frameworks of 2 and 4 begin to collapse at 381 and 408 C, respectively, which is the decomposition of organic components. Electrochemical behaviors of 3 to 4–CPEs Complexes 3–4 are all insoluble in water and common organic solvents. Thus, the 3–4 bulk-modiﬁed carbon paste electrodes (3–CPE, 4–CPE) were fabricated as the working electrodes, which become the optimal choice to study the electrochemical properties of these compounds [34]. Figure S5 show the cyclic voltammetric behavior for 3– CPE and 4–CPE in the 0.01 M H2SO4 ? 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at different scan rates. It can be seen Fig. 6 Emission spectra of L ligand and complexes 1–4 in the solid state at room temperature 688 Transition Met Chem (2014) 39:681–690 123 clearly that in the potential ranges of ?700–0 mV for 3, and ?950–0 mV for 4, a reversible redox peak is observed at the 3–CPE and 4–CPE, respectively, which could be attributed to the redox of Co(III)/Co(II) [35]. The mean peak potentials E1/2 = (Epa ? Epc)/2 are ?235 mV (200 mV s-1) for 3– CPE, and ?253 mV (200 mV s-1) for 4–CPE. With the scan rates varying from 100 to 450 mV s-1, the peak potentials changed gradually: The cathodic peak potentials shifted to the negative direction and the corresponding anodic peak potentials shifted to the positive direction with increasing scan rates. The peak currents were proportional to the scan rates (inset of Fig. S5), which indicated the redox process of 3– and 4–CPE is surface-controlled. Photocatalytic properties of 2–4 To study the photocatalytic activity of complexes 2–4, we selected methylene blue (MB) as a model dye contaminant to evaluate the photocatalytic activities in the puriﬁcation of wastewater. The experiments were investigated through a typ- ical process: 50 mg of the powderedtest complexwasdispersed in 100 mL of MB aqueous solution with the concentration of 10.0 mgL-1,magneticallystirredinthedarkfor0.5 htoensure the equilibrium of the working solution. Then, the solution was exposed to UV irradiation from an Hg lamp, kept continuously stirring. Five milliliters of the suspension was taken for cen- trifugal separation every 30 min. Then the transparent solution of the upper layer was taken out for analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the absorption peaks of MB decreased obviously under UV irradiation in the presence of 2–4. Besides that, changes in the concentration of MB solution were plotted versus irradiation time. The calculation results show that the MB degrades approximately 55 % for complex 2, 60 % for complex 3 and 62 %forcomplex4 after150 min,respectively.Ourgrouphave investigated the photocatalytic performance of a cobalt(II) complex [Co2(2-CMSN)2(biim-4)(H2O)4] (2-H2CMSN = 2- carboxymethylsulfanyl nicotinic acid, biim-4 = 1,10-(1,4-but- anediyl)bis(imidazole)) [36], which did not show photocatalytic activity. However,the title cobalt(II) complexes exhibit obvious photocatalytic activities. The different photocatalytic perfor- mance of these cobalt(II) complexes may be due to their dif- ferent components and structures [37, 38]. Conclusions The simultaneous use of the L ligands and Co(II) ions to react with four different dicarboxylates afforded four 2D networks. c Fig. 7 Absorption spectra of the MB solution during the decompo- sition reaction under UV irradiation with the presence of complexes 2–4 (a–c), and (d) photocatalytic decomposition rate of MB solution under UV irradiation with the use of the complexes 2–4 Transition Met Chem (2014) 39:681–690 689 123 Complexes 1–4 exhibit various 2D networks containing dif- ferent [Co–dicarboxylates]n chains and [Co–L]n chains. The Co(II) ions and the N-donor ligands in the title compounds exhibit different coordination characters and conformations. The dicarboxylates show various coordination modes. The dicarboxylate co-ligands with different rigidity and length play important roles in the construction of the title compounds with various structures, and further enrich the crystal engi- neering. Complexes 2–4 show photocatalytic activity.
