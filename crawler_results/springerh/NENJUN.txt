Manuscript ORIGINAL RESEARCH Benzenedicarboxylate-modulated zinc(II)-3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1H- 1,2,4-triazole frameworks: syntheses, structures and luminescent properties Bing Li • Sanping Chen • Gang Xie • Qi Yang • Shengli Gao Received: 4 March 2011 / Accepted: 17 September 2011 / Published online: 4 October 2011  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract Based on the polydentate ligand 3,5-bis(3-pyr- idyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole (3,30-Hbpt), three coordination compounds [Zn(3,30-Hbpt)(ip)]2H2O (1), [Zn(3,30-Hbpt) (5-NO2-ip)]H2O (2), and [Zn(3,30-Hbpt)2(H2pm)(H2O)2] 2H2O (3) have been hydrothermally constructed with H2ip, 5-NO2-H2ip and H4pm as auxiliary ligands (H2ip = isophthalic acid, 5-NO2-H2ip = 5-NO2-isophthalic acid, H4pm = pyromellitic acid). Structural analysis reveals that Zn(II) ions serve as four-coordinated, ﬁve-coordinated, and six-coordinated connectors in 1–3, respectively, while 3,30- Hbpt adopts l-Npy and Npy coordination modes in two typical conformations in these target coordination com- pounds. Dependently the applied ligand, compounds 1–3 exhibit either 1D channel, cage or chain structures, respectively. In addition, the luminescence properties of 1–3 have been investigated in the solid state at room temperature. Keywords Zinc(II) coordination compound  3,5-Bis(3-pyridyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole  Benzenedicarboxylic ligand  Crystal structure  Luminescence Introduction Luminescent stable organometallic polymers with metal nodes such as zinc have been an active research area for the last decades because of their potential applications in materials science [1–5]. In principle, the natures of the organic ligands make great differences on the desired structural features and physicochemical properties of the extended solid coordination frameworks [6, 7]. As an N,N0-donor ligand, 3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole (3,30-Hbpt) acts as a bridge ligand and, thus, mediates exchange coupling [8–14]. What’s more, the prototropy and conjugation among the 1H-1,2,4-triazole and pyridyl groups not only alter the electron density of the whole molecule, but also make the ligand more ﬂexible in coordination with metal ions [15, 16]. In addition, 3,30- Hbpt shows two typical conformations under appropriate surroundings (Scheme 1). As we knew, benzenedicarb- oxylic species such as isophthalic acid (H2ip), 5-NO2- isophthalic acid (5-NO2-H2ip) and pyromellitic acid (H4pm) have been extensively explored to produce robust crystalline materials due to their exclusive coordination abilities and versatile coordination modes [17–20]. In view of above points, we managed to prepare Zn(II) complexes with 3,30-Hbpt using the substituted benzen- edicarboxylic acids as auxiliary ligands, aiming to explore the effects of these substituents on the coordination struc- tures. As a matter of fact, these polycarboxyl compounds are chemically pertinent and differentiated. In this contri- bution, we report the syntheses, crystal structures, and luminescent properties of three new Zn(II) mixed-ligand complexes, [Zn(3,30-Hbpt)(ip)]2H2O (1), [Zn(3,30-Hbpt) (5-NO2-ip)]H2O (2), and [Zn(3,30-Hbpt)2(H2pm)(H2O)2] 2H2O (3).

Syntheses of the coordination compounds The synthetic procedures for the three complexes were similar to that of 1, except that 5-NO2-H2ip and H4pm were used for 2 and 3, respectively.

X-ray crystal structure determinations All diffraction data of complexes were collected on a Bruker/ Siemens Smart Apex II CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 296 K with x-scan mode. The program SAINT was used for inte- gration of the diffraction proﬁles [22], and a semiempirical absorption correction was applied using SADABS [23]. The structures were solved using direct methods and successive Fourier difference synthesis (SHELXS-97) [24], and reﬁned using the full-matrix least-squares method on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all nonhydrogen atoms (SHELXL-97) [25]. All hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and reﬁned using a riding model. During reﬁnement of the structures, one restraint was applied in distance restraint (dﬁx). Crystallographic details are sum- marized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles of the complexes are shown in Table S1 (Supplementary material). Possible hydrogen bond geometries of partial complexes are listed in Table S2 (Supplementary material). Results and discussion Asymmetric unit of 1 comprises a central Zn(II) ion ligated with one Hbpt and one ip2- groups along with two unco- ordinated water molecules (Fig. 1a). Spatially adjacent Zn- centers are connected by ip2- dianions to afford a chain, with only one of the O-atoms of each carboxylate groups Scheme 1 Two typical conformations of 3,30-Hbpt 418 Struct Chem (2012) 23:417–423 123 participating in Zn–O bond formation. Each pair of such chains connected by a (0,1,0) translation are linked at pairs of Zn and Zni atoms [symmetry code: (i) x, 1 ? y, z] with two l-3,30-Hbpt (Fig. 1b). Thus, pseudo-tetrahedral Zn atoms generated by the above mentioned symmetry opera- tions represent the knots of a pipe-like structure stretched in the b-axis direction. Noteworthy, that the ‘‘inter-pipe’’ non- hydrogen bindings are absent. This way formed 1D-chan- nels accommodate water molecules. Each pair of adjacent crystallographically independent H2O molecules forms an ‘‘inter-water’’ O5–HO6, O6–HO1ii, and O6–HN2 H-bonds [symmetry code: (ii) 1 - x, -y, 1 - z] (Fig. 1c). Differently, when 5-NO2-H2ip is used, the central Zn(II) ion of 2 is ﬁve-coordinated with a distorted trigonal bipyramidal conﬁguration. X-ray single-crystal structure determination reveals that 2 consists of one Zn(II) ion, one, 3,30-Hbpt, one ip2-, and one uncoordinated water molecule in a crystallographic unit. As shown in Fig. 2a, each Zn(II) ion is coordinated to three oxygen atoms from different carboxylic groups in the equatorial position and two nitrogen atoms from two 3,30-Hbpt ligands at the axial position. The same as 1, 3,30-Hbpt adopts cisoid confor- mation with l-Npy coordination fashions in 2. Two car- boxylic groups in the anion 5-NO2-ip2- show different coordination modes. One bidentately bridges two Zn (II) ions in a syn–syn fashion and the other monodentately connects one Zn (II) ion. Along the (010) direction, the Zn (II) ions are bridged by the 5-NO2-ip2- anions to generate 1D ribbon-like chains which contain an alternative arrangement of 8- and 16-membered rings (Fig. 2b). The resulting chains are linked by 3,30-Hbpt to form 1D cages (Fig. 2c). Moreover, there are cages in the structure that may contain skipped water molecules disordered around the inversion centers.

X-ray single-crystal structure determination reveals that 3 consists of one Zn(II) ion, one 3,30-Hbpt, half pm2-, one coordinated water molecule and one uncoordinated water molecule in a asymmetric unit. The Zn(II) ion, located at special position (an inversion center) is coordinated by two carboxylate O atoms from H4pm, two N atoms from two 3,30-Hbpt ligands and two coordinated water molecules with a slightly dis- torted octahedra coordination geometry (Fig. 3a). It is noteworthy that the 3,30-Hbpt adopts transoid conformation with Npy coordination fashion. In principle, H4pm may present as a tetranion, trianion, dianion, or monoanion under different conditions and the degree of deprotonation will greatly affect the supramolecular assembly [26–29]. In this case, the dideprotonated nature of a H2pm2- ligands deter- mines its bis(monodentate) mode and the adjacent Zn(II) ions are linked through its para-positioned carboxylic groups into 1D chains (Fig. 3b). All of these chains are assembled together through weak hydrogen bond interactions, namely O5-H5BO6, O5-H5AN3iii, O6-H6AO3iv, O6-H6BO2iv, O4-H4AN5v, N4-H4 NO2vi [symmetry code: (iii) x, y ? 1, z; (iv) x ? 1, y, z; (v) x - 1, y ? 1, z; (vi) 1 - x, 1 - y, -z] to form a supramolecular architecture (Fig. 3c). Structural diversiﬁcation is evidently observed in the present series of mixed-ligand coordination compounds. This may mainly arise from three reasons: (i) The different coordination numbers Zn(II) ion adopted. Zn(II) ions serve as four, ﬁve and six coordinated connectors exhibiting distorted tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral Fig. 1 a Coordination environment of Zn2? in 1 (lattice water and H atoms are omitted for clarity).

(ii) The differently ori- ented substituted groups in the benzenedicarboxylate anions. As a strong electron withdrawing group, the nitro group signiﬁcantly imposes on the electronic density of the whole ligand though it is not engaged in coordination with metal ions [30]. Furthermore, it can behave as a reliable hydrogen-bonding acceptor in coordination architectures. With regard to the carboxylic group, the different orien- tations of the carboxylate groups in the benzenedicarbox- ylate anions play dominating roles in the construction of the crystalline materials. (iii) The versatile coordination modes of 3,30-Hbpt. As stated above, the 3,30-Hbpt may exhibit two typical conﬁgurations and exhibits l-Npy and Npy coordination modes due to different degree of depro- tonation, which may play important roles in the con- struction of frameworks. 3,30-Hbpt connector with the cisoid conﬁguration prefers the l-Npy coordination mode, while the ligand with the transoid conﬁguration is inclined to Npy coordination mode (Scheme 2). In conclusion, a combination of the above factors has led structural diversiﬁcation. The infrared spectra of the complexes display some gen- eral features. The complexes 1–3 display broad bands over the range of 3150–3400 cm-1 which are attributed to the stretching frequency of m(O–H) of the water molecule. The strong bands at 1550–1608 and 1378–1403 cm-1 for com- pounds 1–3 correspond to the asymmetric (mas) and sym- metric stretching vibrations (ms) of the carboxylic groups, respectively. The D(mas - ms) values are 172–205 cm-1, indicating that carboxylic groups coordinate to Zn(II) ions in bidentate modes [31], what is consistent with the single- crystal X-ray diffraction analysis data. Unlike in 1 and 2, in the IR spectrum of 3, there is an absorption band at 1694 cm-1 related to -COOH, indicating the presence of protonated carboxylic groups. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) have been per- formed in air for compounds 1-3 from 50 to 800 C (Figs. S1–S3). Compounds 1 and 2 show similar degradation behaviors. Their TG curves exhibit three main steps of weight loss. Firstly, they release all lattice water molecules in the temperature range of 100–245 C for 1 (found: 7.29%, calcd: 7.37%), 105–163 C for 2 (found: 3.24%, Scheme 2 Two typical coordination modes of 3,30-Hbpt Fig. 3 a Coordination environment of Zn2? in compound 3 (lattice water and H atoms are omitted for clarity).

The second step corresponds to the release of benzenedicarboxylate, in the temperature range of 335–444 C for 1 (found: 31.82%, calcd: 32.01%), 229–429 C for 2 (found: 41.23%, calcd: 40.97%), respectively. Finally, the residues with 15.63% (calcd. 15.77%) for 1 and 15.63% (calcd. 15.77%) for 2 corre- spond to the complete conversion to zinc oxide and were further conﬁrmed by X-ray powder diffraction analysis. The TG curve for 3 exhibits only two main steps of weight loss. The weight loss of about 9.03% (calcd. 8.61%) in the range of 171–254 C attributes to the release of four water molecules. The second step (362–736 C) corresponds to the release of 3,30-Hbpt and H2pm, giving zinc oxides as the ﬁnal decomposition product with residue percent of 9.81% (calcd. 9.73%). Solid-state ﬂuorescent properties of the Zn(II) com- pounds have been investigated at room temperature. The compounds 1–3 are excitated at 280 nm, the luminescence emissions with maximal peaks appear at 397 and 420 nm for 1, 453 and 464 nm for 2, 366 and 453 nm for 3, respectively (Fig. 4a). To further explore the origin of these emission bands, the luminescence emissions of the free ligands (Fig. 4b) have also been analyzed under the same conditions, with emission maxima at 398 and 454 nm for 3,30-Hbpt, 379 nm for H2ip, 436 and 467 nm for 5-NO2-H2ip, 356 and 426 nm for H4pm. Thus, it can be presumed that the peaks appearing at ca. 397 and 453 nm for these compounds should be assigned to the intraligand p–p* transitions of 3,30-Hbpt. The emission peak (420 nm) for 1 is blue-shifted comparatively to that of 3,30-Hbpt (454 nm), which is the result of the incorporation of metal– ligand coordination interactions [32]. As for 3, the emis- sion peaks appear at around 366 nm. The small red shift with that of the H4pm (356 nm), may originate from an electric interaction between Zn2? and H4pm. The red shift indicates that the binding Zn2? stabilizes the excited state of H4pm comparatively to its ground state in the 1D chain coordination compound. Conclusions In summary, we presented here a new family of Zn(II) coordination compounds generated from mixed-ligand systems of 3,30-Hbpt and three substituent benzenedicarb- oxylic acid (H2ip, 5-NO2-H2ip, and H4pm). Structural analysis reveals that Zn (II) ions serve as four-coordinated, ﬁve-coordinated and six-coordinated centers, and the ligand benzenedicarboxylates, in cooperation with 3,30- Hbpt connectors, link the Zn(II) centers to form either channel, cage, or chain for 1–3, respectively. Moreover, all the three compounds display strong luminescence emis- sions at room temperature, which indicates that such compounds could be good candidates for potential photo- active materials.
