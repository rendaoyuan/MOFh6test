It consists of one-dimensional rod and loop chains featuring the combination of Zc-(anti, cis) and Zt-(anti, trans) mode conformations for the coordinated ligands. The one-dimensional chains are assembled in parallel and non-parallel directions into three-dimensional networks by complicated supramolecular interactions. The solid photoluminescence of 1 was also investigated at room temperature. Keywords Cd(II) complex  Semi-rigid 3,30-bipyridyl ligand  1D rod and loop chain  Non-parallel stacking  Supramolecular structure Introduction The study of coordination polymers of bipyridyl ligands is of great current interest not only for their potential application as functional solid state materials [1–3], but also for the appeal to prediction or control of the designed topological structures [4, 5]. In particular, T-shaped MPy3 building block relied on metal ion node and three bipyr- idyl ligands, can lead to a family of highly related 1D (common ladder [6] and sparse rod and loop chain [7, 8]), 2D (brick-wall [9, 10], herringbone [11] and bilayer [12]) and 3D frameworks [12]; moreover, the stacking of these low-dimensional motifs have relatively few different options except of a parallel fashion. On the other hand, as to the same building block, the arrangement of a bridging ligand could be changed by the variation of reaction conditions such as the solvent system, to yield different topological coordination polymer species (pseudo-poly- morphism) [13]. To date, efforts on 3,30-N-donor bipyridyl ligands are commonly limited in the rigid analogs [8, 14–20]. Recently, Jung et al. [21, 22] have tried a few ﬂexible 3,30- bipyridyl ligands, which have shown the formation of their polymeric networks was inﬂuenced by the chemical nature of the organic ligands and the coordination geometry of the metals. We have recently begun the investigation on the reactions of ﬂexible 3,30-bipyridyl-substituted ligands, in which ﬂexibility are limited by the characters of the non- coordinating diimide spacers, and the diimide cores endow the ligands with complementary C–HO hydrogen-bon- dings to build non-interpenetrating multi-dimensional networks and functional channels [23–25]. Herein, one of 3,30-bipyridyl ligand L (N,N0-bis(3-pyridylmethyl)-pyrom- ellitic diimide) was chosen to react with Cd(NO3)2 in dif- ferent solvent systems or either 3:1, 2:1 or 1:1 molar ratio, a unique cross-linked array coordination polymer of 1D rod and loop chain motifs [Cd(L)1.5(NO3)2]n2nCHCl3 (1) was obtained, and the composition of the product is insensitive to the reactant stoichiometry.

Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer Model 240C elemental analyzer. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker EQUINOX55 FT-IR spectrophotometer in the region 4000– 400 cm-1 in KBr pellets. The excitation and emission spectra were obtained on a HITACHI 850 spectrometer. The ligand N,N0-bis(3-pyridylmethyl)pyromellitic diimide (L) was prepared as a reported procedure [23–25]. Preparation of [Cd(L)1.5(NO3)2]n2nCHCl3 (1) A solution of Cd(NO3)26H2O (16.0 mg, 0.05 mmol) in acetone (8 mL) was layered onto a solution of L (39.8 mg, 0.10 mmol) in CHCl3 (8 mL). The solutions were left for a few days at room temperature to give colorless crystals of 1. Yield: 58%. Anal. Calc. for C35H23CdCl6N8O12: C, 39.19, H, 2.16, N, 10.45.

X-Ray Crystallography Single crystal of 1 with suitable size was mounted onto thin glass ﬁbers. All the intensity data were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer (Mo-Ka radiation, k = 0.71073 A˚ ) in / and x scan modes in the range of at 293(2) K. Absorption corrections were applied using SADABS [26]. The structure was solved by direct method followed by difference Fourier syntheses, and then reﬁned by the full- matrix least squares techniques against F2 using SHELXTL [27] with anisotropic thermal parameters for all the non- hydrogen atoms. All H atoms were placed in calculated positions and reﬁned using a riding model. Crystallo- graphic data and reﬁnements are presented in Table 1. Relevant inter-atomic distances (A˚ ) and bond angles (), and intermolecular hydrogen bond distances (A˚ ) and angles () for 1 are collected in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Results and Discussion Syntheses and General Characterization A related 2D (6,3) complex, [Cd(L)1.5(NO3)2]EtOH (1a), was prepared [23–25] in the same way as 1 except that EtOH–CHCl3 was used instead of CH3COCH3–CHCl3. The minor change of solvent system results in the signiﬁcantly different topological structures of their complexes as described later in this paper.

The IR spectrum for 1 shows two strong absorption bands at 1463 and 1295 cm-1 attributed to m(NO3 -) and the band appearing at 735 cm-1 tentatively assigned as a m(C–Cl) vibration. The characteristic absorptions of the pyromellitic diimide carbonyl groups were observed at 1724 and 1775 cm-1 for 1, all blue shifted relative to those of the free ligands (1706 and 1767 cm-1 for L), which may be related to the difference in hydrogen bond formation in 1 (vide infra). Description of the Crystal Structure of 1 The asymmetric unit of complex 1 contains one neutral [Cd(L)1.5(NO3)2] and two chloroform solvates. As shown in Fig. 1, The Cd(II) center lies in a hepta-coordinate environment of N3O4 where the 3 N atoms are from the 3-pyridyl groups of three individual L and 4O from two bidentately coordinated NO3 -. What is unusual is the fact that the semi-rigidity of the designed L ligand affords both the Zc-(anti, cis) and Zt-(anti, trans) modes (Fig. 1, right) of L possible, thus affording two of the three L in the Zc- mode (CdCd distance ca. 18.528 A˚ ) and the third in the Zt-mode (CdCd ca. 17.443 A˚ ), forming a distorted W- shape module for the CdL3 moiety, completely different from the common T-shaped species [28–30] recognized in the complexes of many bispyridyl derivatives. Such con- formational combination of the Zt-(extended mode) and Zc- modes (for the formation of M2L2 metallomacrocycle) of ligands, different from the single trans- or cis-conforma- tion of the low-symmetry rigid 3,30-bipyridyl ligands [21, 22] in their metal complexes, and only observed in our reported complexes[23–25] [Zn(L)1.5(H2O)2]n2n(ClO4) nCH3CN of L ligands leads to an inﬁnite rod and loop chain polymeric network, as shown in Fig. 2. A detailed examination of the crystal packing revealed the unusual feature of 1 is that the rod and loop chains span two directions to give rise to a cross-linked fashion. In Fig. 3a, parallel running chains in the same direction are linked with each other through multiple supramolecular forces involving weak pp interactions (3.674(2) A˚ ) and C–HO hydrogen bonds (HO 2.37–2.51 A˚ ) to form the 2D layers, and as shown in Fig. 3b, the near two parallel chains in different direction link through the supramo- lecular interactions of weak pp interactions (3.899 (2) A˚ ) and C–HO hydrogen bonds (HO 2.51 A˚ ), and the complementary C–HO supramolecular interactions Table 3 Intermolecular hydrogen bond distances (a˚) and angles () in 1 Donor–HAcceptor D–H H A DA D–H A C(35)–H(35)O(5) 0.98 2.37 3.177(7) 139 C(14)–H(14)O(6) 0.93 2.56 3.436(4) 158 C(28)–H(28)O(7) 0.97 2.46 3.322(5) 148 C(34)–H(34)O(8) 0.98 2.37 3.177(7) 139 Cg(4)Cg(4) 3.899(2) Cg(6)Cg(6) 3.674(2) Cg(4): the six-membered ring of N1–C1–C2–C3–C4–C5 Cg(6): the six-membered ring of N5–C23–C24–C25–C26–C27 Fig. 1 Structure of complex 1.

Different architectures for the complexes 1 and 1a [23–25] with similar N3O4 environment of the Cd ions and tris-pyridyl building block are an exhibition of one case of pseudo-polymorphism [8, 14–20]. Obviously, the different reaction media: CH3COCH3/CHCl3 (1) versus EtOH/ CHCl3 (1a) is the cause for the formation of the CdPy3 modes in different geometries. It is noteworthy that the few rod and loop motifs in 1 are just originated from the characteristic semi-rigidity with the 3,30-bipyridyl L ligand, not the result of the ﬂexibility with the reported 4,40-bipyridyl ligand in Cd(NO3)2 complex [7, 8]. In addition, the cross-link fashion of chain placement are the few exception rather than the rule, to the best of our knowledge, which has been reported in two Ag(I) one-dimensional zigzag chain complexes [31–33] with rigid linear bipyridyl ligands 4,40-bipyridine or 3,6-bis(40-pyridyl)tetrazine through ligand-unsupported supramolecular interactions (AgAg, 2.97 A˚ , or AgO, 2.79 A˚ ), and the rarity of ligands-supported supramolecular interactions endowed from the function of the designed ligand in both parallel and non-parallel fashions strongly limiting the stacking of 1D chain motifs is of signiﬁcant interest. Inorganic–organic hybrid coordination polymers have been investigated for potential application at luminescent materials, especially for d10 or d10–d10 systems [34, 35]. In the present work, we have explored the luminescent Fig. 2 Views of the 1D rod and loop chain motif in 1.

As shown in Fig. 5, the emission spectrum of free ligand L shows a broad range from 400 to 600 nm with a maximum at ca. 424 nm when excited at 365 nm. Complex 1 or 1a exhibits lumines- cent (kex = 380 nm) with maximum at 465 or 467 nm and shoulder at 424 or 425 nm, respectively, in which, the lower energy bands would be assigned to the ligand- to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) [36, 37], and the shoulder attributed to the intra-ligand emission [38, 39] from the semi-rigid L ligand. The minor change from the emission spectra of the two pseudo-polymorphism com- plexes could be the result of their supramolecular struc- tural difference from the same ligand at different solvent systems [40]. Conclusion In summary, we have synthesized a new pseudo-poly- morphism Cd(II) complex from the semi-rigid 3,30-bipyr- idyl ligand. The complicated supramolecular interactions endowed from the functional diimide spacer lead to the characteristic non-parallel stacking from the one-dimen- sional rod and loop motifs. The solid luminescence of the ligand and its two Cd(II) complexes was also reported.
