The three title supramolecular structures of [Cd(py)2{Ag(CN)2}2]-C6H6 la, [Cd(py)2. {Ag(CN)2}2].C4HsN lb and [Cd(py)2{Ag(CN)2}2] le (py = pyridine) have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, la: tetragonal I4122, a = 12.7816(8), c = 13.062(1) A., U = 2133.9(3) A, Z = 4, R = 0.030 for 958 reflections; lb: orthorhombic, I212121, a = 12.861(2), b = 12.438(3), c = 13.105(2) A, U = 2096.3(5) A 3, Z = 4, R = 0.045 for 1272 reflections; lc: C2/m, a = 8.665(2), b = 14.139(1), c = 7.549(1) A,/3 = 93.15(2) °, U = 923.3(3) A 3, Z =2, R= 0.043 for 977 reflections.

InWoduefion The varieties of Ag(CN)2-1inked multi-dimensional supramolecular structures obtained by us are the three-dimensional (3D) textile structure interwoven by two sets of two-dimensional (2D) network stacking in [Cd(NH3)2{Ag(CN)2}2 ] [ 1 ], the doubly interwoven 2D networks of [Cd(4-Mepy)2 {Ag(CN)2 }2]'4-Mepy (4-Mepy = 4-methylpyridine) accommodating 4-Mepy as the guest in the mesh of the wavy network [2], the Prussian blue-like 3D host structures in [K(15C5)2- 2C6H6][Cd{Ag(CN)2}3] and [Rb(15C5)z.ZPhMe][Cd{Ag(CN)2}3] (15C5 = 15- crown-5) [3]. In these structures dicyanoargentate(I) behaves as a rod ligand bridg- ing Cd atoms, to which a pair of secondary ligands, NH3 or 4-Mepy, coordinate at trans positions except for the last group whose host is built only by the bridges of the primary CN ligand between Cd atoms. Since the size of py (pyridine) is intermediate between NH3 and 4-Mepy, we examined the formation of multi- dimensional structures with py ligands at the Cd 2+ linked by [Ag(CN)2]- rods. [Cd(py)2{Ag(CN)2}2].G (G = C6H 6 la; C4HsN lb) clathrates and a complex [Cd(py)2{Ag(CN)2}2] le were obtained. Their single crystal structures revealed the role of the secondary ligand py and the flexibility of the Ag(CN)2-1inked multi-dimensional network. In this paper their structures are described in detail in comparison with the previously reported compounds [Cd(NH3)2{Ag(CN)2}2] 2 [1] and [Cd(4-Mepy)2{Ag(CN)2}2].4-Mepy 3 [2]; as for la a brief description of the structure has been reported [3]. 2.

X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY Table I summarises the crystallographic and experimental data for compounds la-c. The intensity data were collected at room temperature on a Rigaku AFC-5R diffractometer for la and on a Rigaku AFC-5S for lb and le, using graphite- monochromated MoKa radiation (A = 0.71069 A) by the 20-w scan technique. The unit cell dimensions were refined using 25 reflections in the 20 range of 48.05 ° < 20 < 49.75 ° for la, 30.38 ° < 20 < 39.15 ° for lb and 23.87 ° < 20 < 29.77 ° for le. Three standard reflections were monitored after ever 150 reflections; no significant decay was observed for each crystal. Empirical absorption corrections via ~b scans of three reflections were made for Lp-corrected intensity data for lb and le using the programme ADC80 in UNICSIII [4]. An extinction correction was applied for la using the equation Fcorr = Fc[1 - {z(Fc)2/sin 0}]; :c was refined to 5.6(3) x 10 -8. The structures were solved by the heavy-atom method. Cd and Ag were located by the direct method using SHELXS 86 [5]; the remaining non-H atoms were found from successive Fourier and Fourier-difference syntheses. These atoms were refined anisotropically by full-matrix least-squares procedures. In the final Fc calculation all H atoms fixed at calculated positions with the isotropic thermal parameters of 6.0 A 2 were included. Absolute configurations were determined for la and lb based on Flack absolute structure parameters z using SHELXL 93 [6]. Neutral atomic scattering factors including those for real and imaginary anomalous dispersion corrections for Cd and Ag were taken from Ref. 7; those for O, N and C from SHELX 76 [8]. The refined atomic parameters are listed in Table II; the selected bond distances and angles in Table III. The structures are illustrated in Figures 1 to 4 for la, lb, le and 2, respectively. 164 TAKAYOSHI SOMA AND TOSCHITAKE IWAMOTO Table I.

SUPRAMOLECULAR STRUCTURES BUILT OF [Cd(py)2 {Ag(CN)2}2]n NETWORK 167 I212121 led to the most reasonable crystal structure; the absolute configurations were determined for both based on the Flack absolute structure parameters x (cf. 2.2). As shown in Figures 1 and 2, each of the 3D host structures of la and lb is constructed of the flat 2D networks of [Cd(--NCAgCN---Cdl/4)4]~ stacked along the [110] and [220] directions respectively. The network has a rhombus mesh of a ca. 11.15 ~ edge length cornered by Cd to which a pair ofpy ligands coordinate at the trans positions. There are no direct chemical bonds between the 2D networks but each of the meshes in the network extending along one direction is interpenetrated by a pair of the networks extending along the other direction. Thus, the whole crystal structure is seen as a 3D textile interwoven by two sets of the 2D networks as warp and woof running orthogonally to each other. In la the two sets of the networks with an interlayer distance of 9.04/k are correlated to each other with the 41 screw axis to generate channels extending along the c axis at x = 1/4, y = 1/4, and x = 3/4, y = 3/4; these channels are occupied by the py ligands stacked along the c axis with a plane-to-plane distance of 3.27 A. A py ring from one set of the network is sandwiched by two py tings from the other set. Another kind of cavity is generated at the centre of the mesh of one set into which the two networks of the other set penetrate to give the interlayer space. The guest benzene molecule trapped here, e.g. at 0, 0, 1/2, takes a statistical disorder of molecular orientation about the twofold axis along the [ 1]-0] direction with the site occupancy of 0.5 for C(22) and C(23). The aromatic plane of the benzene molecule is inclined against the average mesh plane by ca. 27 ° . The 3D textile host of lb is topologically the same as that of la. The 2D networks stacking along the [110] and []-10] directions correlate to each other with the twofold axes along the a or b axes, the angle formed by the two layers deviating by 1.9 ° from the right angle, though the section of the channel viewed along the c axis is approximated to a square with an edge length of 8.95 A. The atom of the guest pyrrole on the twofold axis along the c axis was assignable to N(21) because of the smallest isotropic thermal parameter among the three crystallographically independent atoms in the ring that had been assumed to be C at the earlier stages of the refinement procedure. The inclination of the ring plane from the average mesh plane is ca. 23 ° comparable to that observed in la. 3.1.2. [Cd(py)2{Ag(CN)2}2] le The centrosymmetric C2/m space group was applied. As shown in Figure 3, complex lc has a layer structure of the almost fiat 2D [Cd(--NCAgCN---Cdu4)n]n network extending along (102), these networks being stacked with a shift of ca. 12.59 A along the [102] direction to give the interlayer distance of 3.84/k along the [020] direction. The structure of the network itself is similar to those in la and lb with the --NCAgCN-- span length of 11.05 • and the diagonal lengths of 14.14 and 22.09 A respectively.

SUPRAMOLECULAR STRUCTURES BUILT OF [Cd(py)2 {Ag(CN)2 }2In NETWORK 171 A layer structure of the Ag(CN)2-1inked 2D networks with the protrusion of the secondary ligands is known for [Cd(4,4r-bpy)2 {Ag(CN)2 }2] [9] where two sets of stacked 2D networks of [Cd{Ag(CN)2 }2] were supported by the 4,#-bpy pillars to give a doubly interpenetrating 3D lattice structure. The 4,41-bpy pillars penetrate into the meshes of the adjacent networks to link from Cd to Ag of the second next lower and upper networks giving an interlayer distance of ca. 6.42 A between the networks, a value greater than that in le. 3.2. DISCUSSION The present 3D textile structures of la and lb have a topology different from that of our precedent 3D textile in [Cd(NH3)2{Ag(CN)2}2] 2 [1], whose structure is shown in Figure 4a for the sake of comparison. Although the 2D network in 2 is puckered, the 3D textile is interwoven by two sets of the stacked networks running orthogonally, to the first approximation, similar to those in la and lb. The difference is seen in the number of--NCAgCN - threads in one network passing through the mesh of another network, the number being 2 in 1 but 1 in 2. Another contrast is observed between the structures of le (L = py) and 2 (L = NH3) with similar compositions [CdL2{Ag(CN)2}2]: the former has a lay- er structure. Including la and lb textile structures, the [Cd(py)z{Ag(CN)2}2] network 1 is flat with the mesh of wider opening than that in the puckered [Cd(NH3)2{Ag(CN)2}2 ] network 2. The structure with the wide opening appears to be stabilised by insertion of a pair of the py ligands in le and a pair of-- NCAgCN-- spans and guest molecule in la and lb. In other words, the ammine ligand in 2 is not bulky enough to keep a flat network structure like that in 1. The puckered network is favourable to the stabilisation of crystal packing in 2 with the narrow mesh-opening interpenetrated by only one --NCAgCN-- span. In this respect the layer structure of [CdO-Mepy)z{Ag(CN)2}2].4-Mepy clathrate 3 [2] should be compared with 1 and 2. The 2D network of [Cd(4-Mepy)z{Ag(CN)2}2] is far more smoothly puckered than 2 to form a doubly interpenetrating layer with a shape of a stationary wave, which can be described with a wavelength 26.95 A and amplitude 4.95 A (see Figure 4b). The puckering structure of 2 may also be approximated to a stationary wave of wavelength 11.50 A and amplitude 1.3 A for any pairs running in parallel. Introduction of a methyl group at the 4-position of py induces a drastic change in the clathrate structure of 2, in which every mesh is not only interpenetrated by a span of--NCAgCN--but also accommodates the guest 4-Mepy molecule. The interlayer and intralayer cavities formed in the layer structure of 3 are occupied by the 4-Mepy ligands coordinating to Cd at trans positions. In the 3D textile structure of 2, the channel cavity formed by one set of the stationary waves at the antinodal zone is occupied by the nodal parts of the other set and ammine ligands. These observations suggest that structural control is delicate for the multi- dimensional structures involving --NCAgCN-- spans between Cd atoms ligat- 172 TAKAYOSHI SOMA AND TOSCHITAKE IWAMOTO (a) (b) Figure 4.

The spanned structure is rather flexible. The selec- tion of secondary ligand and guest gives possibilities of demonstrating a vari- ety of unprecedented supramolecular structures.
