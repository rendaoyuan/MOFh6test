Manuscript Synthesis, crystal structures and catalytic properties of Ag(I) and Co(II) 1D coordination polymers constructed from bis(benzimidazolyl)butane Li Qin • Shu Lin Xiao • Pei Juan Ma • Guang Hua Cui Received: 16 April 2013 / Accepted: 7 May 2013 / Published online: 23 May 2013  Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013 Abstract Two metal–organic coordination polymers, {Co(bbbi)0.5(bm)(Hbtc)}n (1) and {Ag2(bbbi)2(ntp)(H2O) 4H2O}n (2), [bbbi = 1,1-(1,4-butanediyl)bis-1H-benzimid- azole, bm = benzimidazole, H3btc = 1,2,4-trimellitic acid, and H2ntp = 2-nitroterephthalic acid], have been hydro- thermally synthesized and characterized by physico-chemi- cal and spectroscopic methods and single-crystal diffraction. 1 Features a 1D ladder-like chain and is further connected by O–HO hydrogen bonding interactions to yield a 3D supramolecular architecture. 2 Possesses a 1D inﬁnite zigzag chain connected by bbbi ligands in bis-monodentate mode, which is further extended into a 3D complicated supramo- lecular network by face-to-face p–p stacking interactions and O–HO hydrogen bonds. Moreover, both compounds exhibit catalytic properties on degradation of methyl orange in Fenton-like process. Introduction The architecture of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been an active research area in recent years due to their tunable properties and functions. They were applied in many ﬁelds such as magneto optics/electronics, catal- ysis, molecular sieves, ion exchange, luminescence, nanoparticles, gas storage, corrosion inhibitors and anti- tumor agents [1–4]. In the engineering of coordination networks, the use of divergent polydentate ligand–metal coordination—in contrast to the traditional convergent coordination chemistry of chelating ligands—extends the coordination network through space in one-, two- or three- dimensional architectures [5, 6]. The dimensionality of the resulting coordination network can be increased by non- covalent interactions, like hydrogen bonds, pp, C–Hp and/or other van der Waals interactions, and such changes affect the ﬁnal properties of the supramolecular organi- zations [7–9]. However, it is still a challenge to predict the ﬁnal supramolecular architectures of the desired crystal- line products, because many factors such as the coordi- nation activity of the metal center, the nature of the ligands used, the metal–ligand ratio and various experi- mental conditions may have a great inﬂuence on the self- assembly process [10–16]. One of the key factors to generate target complexes is the careful selection of organic ligands containing appropriate coordination sites linked by proper spacers. Recently, the ﬂexible bis(benz- imidazole) ligands, such as 1,1-(1,4-butanediyl)bis-1H- benzimidazole (bbbi), can selectively adjust the arrange- ments via rotating and bending the –CH2– group to meet the requirements of the coordination geometries of metal atoms in the assembly process. And compared with those ﬂexible bis(imidazole) ligands, bis(benzimidazole) ligands have two extra non-coordinated phenyl groups and we are curious about the inﬂuence of non-coordinated groups on the structures of their complexes [17–21]. Furthermore, as an important family of multidentate O-donor ligands, organic polycarboxylate anions seem to be excellent sec- ondary building units with charge, versatile coordination modes as well as remarkable stability for the construction of high-connected MOFs [22]. We chose two kinds of rigid aromatic polycarboxylates 1,2,4-trimellitic acid (H3btc) and 2-nitroterephthalic acid (H2ntp) as co-ligands in this work since it is known that the two kinds of acids are good O-containing auxiliary ligands for the assembly of complexes [23, 24].

The ﬂuores- cence and catalytic performances of the complexes 1 and 2 for the degradation of methyl orange in a Fenton-like process have been reported. Experimental Materials and measurements Methyl orange, purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), was of commercial grade and used without further puriﬁcation. Other solvents and starting materials used in the syntheses were com- mercially available and used as received. The free ligand bbbi was prepared according to the literature [25] (Scheme 1). Elemental analyses were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. FT-IR spectra were obtained on an FTIR Avatar 360 (Nicolet) spectropho- tometer as a KBr pellet in the range of 4,000–400 cm-1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were taken on a Net- zsch TG 209 thermal analyzer from room temperature to 800 C under N2 with a heating rate of 10 C/min. The photoluminescence measurements were carried out on crystalline samples at room temperature, and the spectra were collected with a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) measurements were performed on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer oper- ated at 40 kV and 100 mA for a Cu-target tube and a graphite monochromator. The concentration of methyl orange solution was measured with a SHANGHAI JIN- GKE 722 N spectrophotometer at its maximum wavelength 506 nm (pH = 3.0). Synthesis of the {Co(bbbi)0.5(bm)(Hbtc)}n (1) A mixture of CoCl26H2O (0.1 mmol, 23.8 mg), bbbi (0.1 mmol, 29.0 mg), bm (0.1 mmol, 11.8 mg), H3btc (0.1 mmol, 21.0 mg) and H2O (6 mL) was stirred for 0.5 h, and then, the pH was adjusted to 6.5 by the addition of 0.1 M NaOH solution. Consequently, the resulting mixture was transferred and sealed in a 25 mL Teﬂon-lined stain- less steel vessel, which was heated at 140 C for 72 h, then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 C/h. Purple block crystals of 1 suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated by mechanical separation from amorphous solid in 25 % yield (based on CoII salt).

Synthesis of the {Ag2(bbbi)2(ntp)(H2O)4H2O}n (2) The synthetic procedure of 2 was similar to the synthesis of 1: A mixture of AgOAc (0.5 mmol, 83.5 mg), bbbi (0.5 mmol, 145.1 mg) and H2ntp (0.5 mmol, 105.6 mg) in H2O (10 mL) was stirred for 0.5 h, and then, the pH was adjusted to 5.5 by the addition of 0.1 M NaOH solution. White block crystals of 2 suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated by mechanical separation from amorphous solid in 30 % yield (based on AgI salt). Calcd. for C44H49Ag2N9O11 (Fw = 1,095.66): C 48.2, H 4.5, N 11.5 %; found: C 48.1, H 4.7, N 11.3 %. FTIR (KBr, cm-1): 3,414 s, 3,105 w, 2,945 w, 1,604 m, 1,557 w, 1,503 m, 1,461 w, 1,380 m, 1,360 w, 1,288 w, 1,152 m, 1,077 m, 950 w, 740 m. Catalysis experiments In catalysis experiments, 250 mL round-bottom ﬂask con- taining the solid catalysts 1 or 2 (50 mg) was mixed with the thermostated dye (methyl orange solution 150 mL with 10 mg/L) and a Na2S2O8 solution (0.2 mg/L) and the zero time was noted. The solution was stirred and 5 mL samples were taken at regular time intervals, then the dye concen- trations were measured spectrophotometrically at the cor- responding kmax of the dye. The degradation efﬁciency of methyl orange is deﬁned as follows: [26]: Degradation efficiency ¼ ðC0  CtÞ C0  100 % ð1Þ where C0 (mg/L) is the initial concentration of methyl orange, and Ct (mg/L) is the concentration of methyl orange at reaction time, t (min). X-ray crystallography The crystallographic data for the single crystals of com- pounds 1 and 2 were collected at 293 K on an Agilent Technology SuperNova Atlas Dual System with a Cu mi- crofocus source and focusing multilayer optics. CrysAlis PRO [27] software was used to collect, index, scale and N N N N bbbi N NH bm Scheme 1 The ligands bbbi and bm 628 Transition Met Chem (2013) 38:627–633 123 apply analytical absorption correction based on faces of the crystal. The structure was solved by the direct method and reﬁned by full matrix least-squares on F2 using the Bruker SHELXTL program package [28]. All the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned using anisotropic thermal parameters. The hydrogen atoms of organic ligands were generated theoretically and reﬁned isotropically with ﬁxed thermal factors. The aqua hydrogen atoms in 2 were located from difference Fourier maps and reﬁned with isotropic dis- placement parameters. The complex 1 N4 of benzimid- azole ring manifesting as disordered over 2 probable orientations was reﬁned with site occupation factor 0.4355. The complex 2 disordered C26, C27, C28, C29 of a butane spacer was reﬁned with a split model with site occupation factor 0.8039. The crystallographic data and selected bond lengths and bond angles for 1 and 2 are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Results and discussion Synthesis, IR spectra of compounds 1 and 2 Both complexes were synthesized by the hydrothermal method in H2O system with added NaOH solution (0.1 M) for adjusting the pH value. It is noteworthy that the bm ligand was involved in 1. However, without it, the reaction of CoCl26H2O, bbbi ligand and H3btc in the same situation did not afford 1, and the role of the bm ligand is not understood at present. The IR spectra display characteristic absorption band for water molecules, carboxylate, bbbi and bm ligands. For 1, the absorption bands at 1,637 and 1,334 cm-1 correspond to mas(C–O) and msym(C–O) of the carboxylate groups, indicating monodentate coordination of the carboxylate to the metal center [29]. For 2, it shows strong and broad peak around 3,410 cm-1 relating to the O–H stretching vibration modes of water molecules. The absorption band at 1,563 cm-1 is assigned to nitro groups of ntp2- ligand [30]. The bands in the 3,015–2,945 cm-1 range and 1,610–1,500 cm-1 range are related to m(C–H) and m(C–N) of the bbbi and bm ligands, respectively. Crystal structure of complex 1 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c. The asymmetric unit contains one CoII ion, half of one bbbi ligand, one bm ligand and one Hbtc dianion. Each Co(II) ion is four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from one bbbi and one bm ligand, respectively, and two oxygen atoms from two different Hbtc anions in a nearly perfect tetrahedron geometry, as shown in Fig. 1a.

Each Hbtc dianionic ligand cross-links [Co2(bbbi)2] units in which the bbbi ligands show bis-monodentate coordination mode, giving a 1D ladder-like chain (Fig. 1b). The adjacent non-bonding CoCo distances are 9.441(18) A˚ (Co1Co1B) and 13.243(16) A˚ (Co1Co1C) (symme- try codes: B: x ? 1, y, z; C: -x ? 2, -y ? 2, -z ? 2), respectively. And the bbbi ligands are all neutral, which have dihedral angles between the mean planes of the two benzimidazole rings of bbbi of 0. In addition, the 1D ladder-like chains are further connected by hydrogen bonding interactions (O–HO = 2.620(12) A˚ ) between two uncoordinated carboxylate O atoms of different Hbtc2- ligands to yield a 3D supramolecular architecture (Fig. 1c). Crystal structure of complex 2 The complex 2 displays the triclinic form with space group P - 1. The asymmetric unit of 2 consists of two inde- pendent Ag(I) atoms, one and two half of bbbi molecules, one ntp2- ligand, one coordinated water molecule and four uncoordinated water molecules. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the complex 2 contains two independent Ag(I) atoms with each Ag(I) atom forming a T-shape geometry: Ag1 is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms of different bbbi mol- ecules and one carboxylate oxygen atom (O2) from one ntp2- ligand; Ag2 also shows three-coordinated environ- ment; however, the difference is that Ag2 is ligated by one oxygen atom (O1 W) from one water molecule. The Ag–N (2.123(4)–2.172(3) A˚ ) and the Ag–O (2.562(3) and 2.614(5) A˚ ) bond distances are both within acceptable ranges [31, 32]. Extension of this network through the bisbridging/ bis(monodentate) bbbi linkers (bbbi-1, denoted by N1– N1D; bbbi-2, denoted by N3–N7; bbbi-3, denoted by N8– N8E) shows the formation of neutral 1D [Ag2(bbbi)2(ntp) (H2O)]n zigzag chains (Fig. 2b), wherein Ag1 is bound to other Ag1 atom through bbbi-1 and to Ag2 atom through bbbi-2; Ag2 is bound to other Ag2 atom through bbbi-3 and to Ag1 atom through bbbi-2 (symmetry codes: D: -x, -y ? 3, -z ? 1 E: -x ? 2, -y - 1, -z). The Ag–Ag distances through bbbi-1, bbbi-2 and bbbi-3 are 13.993, 13.675 and 13.622 A˚ , respectively. Differences observed in Ag–Ag distances through the bbbi ligands can be attributed to the slight adjustments in the dihedral angles between the imidazole rings (0 in bbbi-1, 4.380 in bbbi-2 and 0 in bbbi-3, respectively). In addition, the 1D zigzag chain is extended into a 3D supramolecular network by face-to-face p–p stacking interactions between imidazole and benzene rings of benzimidazole molecules of adjacent chains. The p–p stacking interactions have three centriod-to-centriod and perpendicular distances of 3.782 and 3.440A˚ , 3.720 and 3.340 A˚ , 3.545 and 3.410 A˚ , respectively (Fig. 2c). Moreover, strong hydrogen bonding interactions are also present between water and uncoordinated oxygens from carboxylates/water (Ow–HwO = 2.590–3.012 A˚ ), which build up more complicated structure and further stabilize the 3D network. [33]. Thermal analysis The thermal stability was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on polycrystalline samples in a nitrogen Fig. 1 a Coordination environment of the Co(II) atom in 1 with thermal ellipsoids drawn at 30 % probability. Hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity, and symmetry transformation was used to generating equivalent atoms: A = x - 1, y, z, C = -x ? 2, -y ? 2, -z ? 2; b 1D ladder-like chain connected by bbbi and Hbtc2- ligand in 1; c 3D supramolecular networks formed by Hydrogen-bonded (dashed lines) stacking interactions of 1 630 Transition Met Chem (2013) 38:627–633 123 atmosphere heated to 800 C at a rate of 10 C/min, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Compound 1 remains stable up to 260 C, then the removal of ligands occurs in the range of 260–556 C (calculated: 85.8 %, found: 84.0 %). The residue weight, 15.1 % (calcd 14.2 %), corresponds to CoO; for compound 2, the water molecules are lost from 45 to 125 C (calculated: 8.2 %, found: 7.5 %), and the net- work is stable upon to 206 C. Then, the weight loss occurs continuously and does not stop upon 600 C, which is assigned to ntp2- (residue one oxygen atom) and bbbi ligands (calculated: 70.6 %, found: 68.2 %). The residue is stable to 800 C. Photoluminescence properties Previous studies have shown that the metal–organic coor- dination polymers, especially zinc and cadmium carbox- ylate compounds, exhibit photoluminescence properties [34, 35]. Here, the photoluminescence properties of 1, 2 and free bbbi ligand in the solid state at room temperature have been measured. The free bbbi ligand displays emission maximum at 403 nm upon excitation at 350 nm (Fig. 4). Both 1 and 2 show emission bands, which are at 373 nm (kex = 325 nm) for 1 and 471 nm (kex = 320 nm) for 2, respectively. Compared with the free bbbi ligand, the emission maximum of 1 is blue-shifted, which may be attributed to the intraligand charge transfer transitions [36], while the emission peak of 2 is red-shifted, which may be assigned as the metal-to-ligand charge transfer [37]. XRPD analysis To conﬁrm the phase purity of the bulk materials, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) experiments have been carried out for complexes 1 and 2. The XRPD experimental and computer-simulated patterns of the corresponding com- plexes are shown in Fig. 5. Although the experimental patterns have a few un-indexed diffraction lines and some are slightly broadened in comparison with those simulated from the single-crystal models, it still can be well consid- ered that the bulk synthesized materials and the crystals used for diffraction are homogeneous. Catalytic degradation experiments Methyl orange is one of the well-known acidic/anionic dyes and has been widely used in textile, printing, paper, food and pharmaceutical industries and research laborato- ries [38]. It is potentially harmful to the environment, and therefore, the degradation of methyl orange dye has attracted much attention. Hence, methyl orange was selected as a model compound of organic pollutant. The degradation efﬁciency of the catalytic oxidation of methyl orange was studied using Na2S2O8 as oxidant and the compounds 1 and 2 as heterogeneous catalysts, respectively. [39]. In the absence of the catalyst, when a solution of methyl orange is mixed with Na2S2O8, the mixture is stable for a period of time without any noticeable change in the absor- bance of dye, that is, after 110 min, the degradation efﬁ- ciency of control experiments only reaches 18 %, which indicates that there is no obvious reaction taking place between the dye and Na2S2O8 (Fig. 6). However, when the MOF catalyst is added, a reaction takes place leading to a color removal of the dye. And some sorts of delayed estab- lishment of the heterogeneous Fenton-like oxidation during the initial reaction time followed by rapid oxidation of methyl orange for 1. An induction period is deﬁned as a period of time during which no measurable reactions occur or a time before a reaction suddenly increases in rate. Car- riazo et al. [40] suggested that the induction period is related to the adsorption of reactant onto the catalyst surface. Under the same conditions, the catalytic activity of 1 is more effective than that of 2. After 20 min, there is a fast degra- dation of the methyl orange dye in the case of 1. Fig. 2 a Coordination environment of the Ag(I) atom in 2 with thermal ellipsoids drawn at 30 % probability.

Furthermore, 1 is found to be a better catalyst for the degradation of methyl orange dye than 2 in a Fenton-like process.
