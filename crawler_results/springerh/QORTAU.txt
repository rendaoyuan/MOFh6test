In complex 1, the L anions and the phen ligands connect the Cu(II) ions to form a layer. The phen ligands act as arms and thread into the adjacent layer, forming a 2D ? 3D polythreaded architecture. In complex 2, the L anions and the phen ligands link the Ni(II) ions to form a layer. Further, the adjacent layers interdigitate each other through intermo- lecular p - p interactions to generate a 2D ? 3D inter- digitated architecture. Their structures have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses and further characterized by infrared spectra (IR) and elemental analyses. The thermal properties and optical band gaps of complexes 1 and 2 have also been investigated. Keywords Coordination polymers  Polythreaded  Interdigitated  Tetracarboxylic acids  1,10-phenanthroline  Optical band gaps Introduction In recent years, coordination polymers have attracted much attention in the ﬁelds of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering due to their fascinating structural diversities and potential applications in many ﬁelds, such as catalysis, sorption, magnetism, and so on [1–4]. Gen- erally, the ﬁnal structures of the coordination polymers are affected by several factors, such as the pH values, central metals, reaction temperatures, organic anions and N-donor ligands [5–7]. Among these factors, the organic anions play a crucial role in the design and construction of various coordination polymers. In this regard, the multicarboxylic acids were widely used to construct coordination polymers attributed to their variety coordination modes [8–10]. Out of the various multicarboxylic acids, tetracarboxylic acids possessing ﬂexible spacers between the two oxyisophthalic acid fragments, are of particular interest due to their ﬂex- ibility freedom, which may afford more possibilities for the construction of frameworks with novel structures and properties [11–20]. Among the various coordination polymers, entangled systems have attracted particular interest. Interpenetrating nets, as a main system of entanglement, in which only internal connections are broken to separate individual nets, have been widely reported [21]. Other types of entangled architectures such as interdigitated and polythreaded structures, which can be disentangled without breaking links, are far less explored [22–24]. In addition, these entangled networks can result in synthetic supramolecular arrays with potential applications in sensor device, drug- delivery vehicles, and asymmetric catalysis [25–29]. On the basis of the aforementioned points, in this work, we selected the ﬂexible 5,50-(ethane-1,2-diyl)-bis(oxy)dii- sophthalic acid (H4L) (Scheme 1) as the organic anion, and W.-Q. Kan  Y.-H.

These two com- plexes have been characterized by infrared spectra (IR) and elemental analyses. The thermal properties of complexes 1 and 2 have also been investigated. Experimental Section Materials and Physical Measurements H4L was prepared according to the procedures reported [12]. The phenanthroline ligand was purchased commer- cially. Other reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further puriﬁcation. The ele- mental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. The FT-IR spectra were measured with KBr pellets in the range of 4,000–400 cm-1 On a Mattson Alpha-Centauri spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed using a Perkin–Elmer TG-7 ana- lyzer at the rate of 10 C/min from room temperature to 800 C under nitrogen atmosphere. Syntheses of [Cu(phen)(L)0.5(H2O)] (1) A mixture of H4L (0.039 g, 0.1 mmol), Cu(OAc)2H2O (0.04 g, 0.2 mmol), NaOH (0.016 g, 0.4 mmol) and water (8 mL) was placed in a Teﬂon reactor (15 mL) and heated at 120 C for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature at a rate of 10 C/h, blue crystals of 1 were collected in 45 % yield. Anal. Calcd for C21H15CuN2O6 (Mr = 454.89): C, 55.44; H, 3.33; N, 6.16.

Absorption corrections were applied using a multi- scantechnique.ThestructuresweresolvedbyDirectMethodof SHELXS-97 [30] and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares techniques using the SHELXL-97 program [31]. Non-hydro- gen atoms of the compounds were reﬁned with anisotropic temperature parameters. All hydrogen atoms on carbon were generated geometrically and reﬁned using a riding model with d(C–H) = 0.93-0.97 A˚ and Uiso = 1.2Ueq(C). The hydrogen atoms of water molecules were located from difference Fourier maps and reﬁned as riding atoms with d(O–H) = 0.841–0.852 A˚ and Uiso = 1.5Ueq(O). The detailed crystallographic data and structure reﬁnement parameters for these compounds are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for compounds 1 and 2 are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Results and Discussion Structural Analysis of Complex 1 Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis reveals that the asymmetric unit of complex 1 consists of one Cu(II) ion, half a L anion, one phen ligand and one water molecule. The L anion contains a crystallographic inversion center at the middle of the C–C ethane group. As shown in Fig. 1, Cu1 is ﬁve-coordinated in a trigonal bipyramid coordina- tion environment, deﬁned by two nitrogen atoms from one phen ligand and three oxygen atoms from two different L anions and one coordinating water molecule. The Cu–N bond lengths are in the range of 2.014(2) to 2.055(2) A˚ and the Cu–O bond distances vary from 1.927(2) to 2.359(2) A˚ . The Cu–N and Cu–O bond lengths are within the normal ranges observed in other Cu(II) complexes [32–35]. Each L anion acts as a l4-bridge to link four Cu1 ions with all of the carboxylate groups in l1 - g1:g0 coordination modes. In this way, the L anions connect the Cu(II) ions to com- plete a 2D network, which is further coordinated by the phen ligands (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the phen ligands in one network act as dangling arms and thread into the adjacent networks, resulting in a 2D ? 3D polythreaded motif (Fig. 3). Up to now, reported examples of 2D ? 3D polythreaded frame- works are still relatively rare [36–42]. In addition, there are intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the O1 W atom of the coordinating water molecule and the O2 and O4 atoms of the carboxylate groups, which further consolidate the whole structure of 1 (Table 4, Fig. 4).

The asymmetric unit of 2 contains two Ni(II) ions, one L anion, two phen ligands, half a coordinating water mole- cule lying on a two-fold rotation axis and half a lattice water molecule. As shown in Fig. 5, both Ni1 and Ni2 are six-coordinated in octahedral coordination spheres, but their coordination environments are different. Ni1 is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from one phen ligand and four oxygen atoms from three distinct L anions and one water molecule. Ni2 is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from one phen ligand and four oxygen atoms from two individual L anions. It should be pointed out that there is a major difference between the two independent Ni atoms (Ni1 and Ni2) in this structure. Ni1 sits on a two-fold Fig. 1 ORTEP view of 1 showing the local coordination environments of Cu(II) ions with hydrogen atoms omitted for clarity Fig. 2 View of the 2D layer constructed by Cu1, L anions and phen ligands Fig. 3 View of the 2D ? 3D polythreaded motif of 1 Table 4 Hydrogen bonds in 1 and 2 (A˚ and) D–HA d(D–H) d(HA) d(DA) \(DHA) Compound 1 O(1 W)–H(1A)O(2)#4 0.84 2.09 2.806(2) 142.3 O(1 W)–H(1B)O(4)#5 0.85 2.13 2.887(2) 147.1 Compound 2 O(1 W)–H(1A)O(7)#6 0.97 1.69 2.579(3) 150.0 O(1 W)–H(1B)O(7)#2 0.97 1.69 2.579(3) 150.0 Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms: #4 x ? 1, y, z; #5 x ? 1, –y ? 1/2, z - 1/2; #2 –x ? 1, y - 1, –z ? 1/2; #6 x, y - 1, z Fig. 4 View of the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions in compound 1 (the blue dotted lines represent the hydrogen bonding interactions) (Color ﬁgure online) 530 J Chem Crystallogr (2014) 44:527–533 123 rotation axis, which results in the two Ni1 atoms forming a binuclear unit, where two Ni1 atoms are bridged by one water molecule and two carboxylate groups. However, the other Ni atom (Ni2) is not involved in a binuclear unit formation. The Ni–N distances range from 2.044(3) to 2.100(3) A˚ , and the Ni–O distances range from 2.031(3) to 2.113(3) A˚ . The Ni–N and Ni–O distances are all consis- tent with the corresponding bond lengths reported in the literatures [43, 44]. Each L anion acts as a l5-bridge to link ﬁve Ni1 ions with the carboxylate groups in l1 - g1:g0, l1 - g1:g1 and l2 - g1:g1 coordination modes, respec- tively. In this way, the L anions connect the Ni(II) ions to generate a 2D layer, which is further coordinated by the phen ligands (Fig. 6). Moreover, there are intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the O1 W atom of the coordinating water molecule and the O7 atom of the carboxylate group, which further stabilized the layer of 2 (Table 4, Fig. 7). It is noteworthy that the adjacent layers interdigitate each other through intermolecular p - p interactions Fig. 5 ORTEP view of 2 showing the local coordination environ- ments of Ni(II) ions with hydrogen atoms and lattice water omitted for clarity Fig. 6 View of the 2D layer constructed by Ni1, L anions and phen ligands Fig. 7 View of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions in compound 2 (the pink dotted lines represent the hydrogen bonding interactions) (Color ﬁgure online) Fig. 8 p - p interactions between the adjacent layers in complex 2 Fig. 9 View of the 2D ? 3D interdigitated motif of 2 J Chem Crystallogr (2014) 44:527–533 531 123 (Fig. 8) between benzene ring of the phen ligands (ring I: C13 to C16, C24 and N3; ring II: C19 to C23 and N4), generating a 2D ? 3D interdigitated framework (Fig. 9) (the centroid–centroid distance is 3.67 A˚ ). It should be noted that the L anion has a ﬂexible nature, which can be shown by the different O–C–C–O torsion angles in compounds 1 and 2. In compound 1, the O–C–C– O torsion angle is 1808 by symmetry (the L anion contains a crystallographic inversion center at the middle of the C–C ethane group). However, in compound 2, the O–C–C–O torsion angle is about 658. The ﬂexible nature of the O–C– C–O linker between the two oxyisophthalic acid moieties will cause the carboxylate groups to connect metal ions in different directions, offering various possibilities for con- struction of networks with unique structures and useful properties. IR Spectra The infrared spectra of complexes 1 and 2 have been measured in the range of 4,000–400 cm-1. The O–H stretching vibrations of the water molecules in complexes 1 and 2 are observed at 3,422 and 3,423 cm-1, respectively. For 1 and 2, the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylate groups are observed in the ranges of 1,519–1,612 and 1,332–1,465 cm-1, respectively. The absence of strong absorption bands around 1,700 cm-1 indicates complete deprotonation of the carboxylic groups in 1 and 2. Thermal Properties Thermogravimetric analyses are carried out to study the thermal behaviors of complexes 1 and 2. The experiments were carried out under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 C min-1, as shown in Fig. 10. Complex 1 shows a 4.5 % weight loss from room tem- perature to 267 C, corresponds to the loss of one coordi- nated water molecule (calcd 4.0 %). The second gradually weight loss from 267 to 606 C corresponds to the depar- ture of the framework. The remaining residue is 19.0 %, corresponds to the formation of CuO (calcd 17.6 %). For complex 2, the weight loss of 2.6 % from room tempera- ture to 75 C is attributed to the loss of one water molecule (calcd 2.0 %). There is no further weight loss from 75 to 279 C, and after that temperature, the organic components start to decompose. The remaining residue corresponding to the formation of NiO is 23.8 % (calcd 20.6 %). Optical Band Gaps To investigate the conductivity of complexes 1 and 2, the diffuse reﬂectivity spectra of 1 and 2 were measured on powder samples. The Kubelka–Munk functions converted from the diffuse reﬂectance data were plotted in Fig. 11. The band gaps (Eg), are deﬁned as the intersection point between the line extrapolated from the linear portion of the adsorption edge and the energy axis in a plot of the Kub- elka–Munk function F against E [45, 46]. The optical band gaps of compounds 1 and 2 are 2.82 and 2.77 eV, Fig. 10 The TGA curves of complexes 1 and 2 Fig. 11 Kubelka–Munk- transformed diffuse reﬂectance spectra of compounds 1 and 2 532 J Chem Crystallogr (2014) 44:527–533 123 respectively. The reﬂectance spectra indicate that com- pounds 1 and 2 may be potential semiconductive materials. Conclusions In summery, two novel coordination polymers with entangled structures have been synthesized under hydro- thermal conditions. Complex 1 has a 2D ? 3D poly- threaded structure, while complex 2 shows a 2D ? 3D interdigitated framework. The successful isolation of these two complexes provides intriguing examples of entangled structures. Moreover, the reﬂectance spectra indicate that complexes 1 and 2 may be potential semiconductive materials.
