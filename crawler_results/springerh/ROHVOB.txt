Manuscript One- and two-dimensional cobalt(II) coordination polymers derived from ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) and aromatic carboxylate co-ligands Xiao Xiao Wang • Yong Guang Liu • Yue Hua Li • Guang Hua Cui Received: 16 January 2014 / Accepted: 17 March 2014 / Published online: 5 April 2014  Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014 Abstract Two new coordination polymers, formulated as [Co(L1)(btec)0.5]n (1) and {[Co(L2)(bdc)]H2O}n (2) (L1 = 1,3-bis(2-methylbenzimidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene, H2bdc = 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, H4btec = 1,2,4,5-benzenetet- racarboxylic acid, L2 = 1,3-bis(benzimidazol-1-ylmethyl) benzene), have been hydrothermally synthesized and charac- terized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The cobalt atoms present differentenvironments,withatrigonalpyramidalgeometryin1 and a distorted octahedral conﬁguration in 2. Complex 1 shows a 2D (4,4) network linked by L1 and btec4- anions, giving an uninodal 4-connected sql topology with a point symbol of {4262}, while complex 2 displays a 1D ladder-like chain structure, which is further assembled into a 3D supramolecular architecture via C–Hp hydrogen bonding interactions. The ﬂuorescence properties of both complexes have been investi- gated in the solid state. Introduction In recent years, the design and synthesis of metal–organic coordination polymers (MOCPs) have been the subject of extensive research, not only due to their variety of structures and interesting properties, but also their potential applications in catalysis, luminescence, gas adsorption, molecular sieves, ionexchange,corrosioninhibition,andantitumoragents[1–4]. The self-assemblyofsuchpolymersbyhydrothermal reactions is heavily inﬂuenced by factors such as the selection of metal ions with different coordination geometries, the nature of the ligands used, the metal–ligand ratio, solvent, and so on [5–7]. Moreover, the architectures of the resulting coordination net- works and their supramolecular organization can also be changed by noncovalent interactions, including hydrogen bonds, pp, C–Hp and/or van der Waals interactions [8– 11]. Hence, systematic research on this topic is crucial in understanding how these factors affect the metal coordination framework for the rational design of crystalline materials. In recent decades, there has been increasing interest in coordi- nation architectures constructed from ﬂexible ligands. In par- ticular, ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) ligands have been widely used as classic N-containing ligands, which can satisfy the coordination needs of the metal centers and consequently create robust and intricate networks [12–16]. Moreover, this type of ligand contains both the imidazole ring and a larger conjugated p-system, capable of participating in hydrogen bondingandp–pstackinginteractions.Usingthemixed-ligand synthetic strategy [17–19], we selected two related ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) ligands (L1 and L2 only differ by a methyl group) and rigid aromatic polycarboxylate (see Scheme 1) co- ligands to construct two new MOCPs, namely [Co(L1) (btec)0.5]n (1) and {[Co(L2)(bdc)]H2O}n (2), where L1 = 1,3-bis(2-methylbenzimidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene, H2bdc = 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, H4btec = 1,2,4,5-benzene- tetracarboxylic acid, L2 = 1,3-bis(benzimidazol-1-ylmethyl) benzene. The thermogravimetric analyses and solid-state luminescence properties of the complexes are also reported. Experimental Materials and measurements Reagents and solvents were commercially available and used without further puriﬁcation. The ligands L1 and L2 were prepared by the literature method [20].

IR spectra within the range of 4,000–400 cm-1 were obtained on a Nicolet FTIR Avatar 360 spectropho- tometer with KBr pellets. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was obtained on a NETZSCH TG 209 thermal analyzer from room temperature to 800 C under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 C/min. The lumi- nescence spectra for the powdered solid samples were measured at room temperature on a Hitachi F-4500 ﬂuo- rescence spectrophotometer. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) investigations were carried out with a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer at 40 kV, 100 mA with Cu Ka (k = 1.5406 A˚ ) radiation. Synthesis of complex 1 A mixture of Co(OAc)24H2O (0.1 mmol, 25 mg), L1 (0.1 mmol, 36.7 mg), H4btec (0.1 mmol, 25.4 mg), and H2O (12 mL) was stirred for 1 h, and then, the pH was adjusted to 6.5 by the addition of 0.1 mol/dm3 NaOH solution. The resulting mixture was sealed in a 25-mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel, which was heated at 140 C for 72 h, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 C/h. Purple block-shape crystals of complex 1 suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were obtained in 45 % yield (based on Co(OAc)24H2O). Calcd. for C29H23CoN4O4 (Fw = 550.46): C 63.3, H 4.2, N 10.2 %; found: C 63.0, H 4.0, N 9.9 %.

Synthesis of complex 2 Complex 2 was synthesized by a similar procedure to that for complex 1, replacing L1 and H4btec with L2 (0.1 mmol, 33.8 mg) and H2bdc (0.1 mmol, 16.6 mg), respectively. Pink crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were obtained in 53 % yield (based on Co(OAc)24H2O).

X-ray crystallography X-ray diffraction data for complexes 1 and 2 were obtained at room temperature on a Bruker Smart 1000 CCD dif- fractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo–Ka radia- tion (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) and x-2h scan mode at 293 K. Semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied using the SADABS program [21]. Both the structures were solved by direct methods, and all non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically with the SHELXTL package using a full-matrix least-squares procedure based on F2 values Scheme 1 All ligands in this paper Table 1 Crystallographic data and structure reﬁnement for 1 and 2 Complex 1 2 Empirical formula C29H23CoN4O4 C30H24CoN4O5 Formula weight 550.44 579.46 Temperature 293(2) K 293(2) K Wavelength/A˚ 0.71073 0.71073 Crystal system Monoclinic Orthorhombic Space group P21/c Pnna Unit cell dimensions a/A˚ 12.020(3) 17.2366(18) b/A˚ 9.571(3) 12.5117(13) c/A˚ 21.090(6) 11.8458(13) b/ 92.244(4) V/A˚ 3 2,424.4(11) 2,554.7(5) Z 4 4 Dc/g cm-3 1.508 1.507 F(000) 1,136 1,236 Crystal size/mm 0.28 9 0.22 9 0.22 0.26 9 0.22 9 0.21 h Range/ 1.70–27.50 2.09–25.02 Index range h, k, l -9/15, -12/12, -27/26 -15/20, -14/13, -14/12 Reﬂections collected 14,198 12,160 Rint 0.0688 0.0455 Goodness of ﬁt on F2 0.884 0.864 Final R indices [I [ 2r(I)][a,b] R1 = 0.0599, wR2 = 0.1715 R1 = 0.0358, wR2 = 0.1078 R (all data)[a,b] R1 = 0.1171, wR2 = 0.2112 R1 = 0.0505, wR2 = 0.1234 Largest diff. peak and hole 0.607, -0.492 0.230, -0.381 a R1 = R||Fo|–|Fc||/R|Fo|; b wR2 = {R [w (Fo 2–Fc 2) 2]/R [w (Fo 2)2]}1/2 462 Transition Met Chem (2014) 39:461–467 123 [22]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions. H atoms of one water molecule for 1 were not located due to their disorder and high thermal parameters of O1W, whose occupation factor is 0.5. Crystallographic data and experimental details for structural analysis of the complexes are summarized in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. Results and discussion IR spectra In the IR spectra of the complexes, bands at 1,515 cm-1 for 1 and 1,542 cm-1 for 2 are assigned to the mC=N absorption of the benzimidazole rings of the ligands L1 and L2, respectively. A broadband around 3,426 and 3,462 cm-1 for 1 and 2, respectively, can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of lattice water molecules or the existence of hydrogen bonds. The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxyl groups are observed at 1,654 and 1,403 cm-1 for complex 1, and at 1,605 and 1,430 cm-1 for complex 2. The separations (Dm[mas(COO)–ms(COO)]) between these bands indicate the presence of monodentate (251 cm-1 for 1) and chelating (175 cm-1 for 2) carbox- ylate groups [23]. There is no characteristic band at around 1,700 cm-1, indicating that all carboxyl groups in both complexes are completely deprotonated. Structural analysis of the complexes Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that com- plex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/ c. The asymmetric unit contains one Co(II) center, one L1 ligand, and half a btec4- ligand. As shown in Fig. 1a, each Co atom is four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N1, Fig. 1 a Coordination environment of the Co atom in 1, and hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity; b 2D (4,4) supramolecular structure in 1; c The uninodal 4-connected 2D net with a point symbol of {4262} topology network in 1 Table 2 The selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for 1 and 2 Parameter Value Parameter Value [Co(L1)(btec)0.5]n (1) Co1–O2 1.942(3) Co1–N1 2.052(4) Co1–O3 1.951(3) Co1–N4 2.048(4) O2–Co1–O3 103.20(15) O2–Co1–N1 117.28(14) O2–Co1–N4 110.64(14) O3–Co1–N1 101.13(14) O3–Co1–N4 122.85(15) N4–Co1–N1 102.28(15) N2–C24–C28 111.8(4) N3–C17–C15 112.1(4) {[Co(L2)(bdc)]H2O}n (2) Co1–N1 2.083(2) Co1–O2 2.1228(19) Co1–O1 2.215(2) O1–Co1–O1C 83.97(11) N1–Co1–N1C 100.63(12) O2–Co1–O1 60.35(7) N1–Co1–O2 101.32(8) O2–Co1–O1C 94.98(7) N1C–Co1–O1 157.98(8) O2C–Co1–O2 148.15(10) Symmetry transformation used to generate equivalent atoms: C = -x ? 1, y, -z ? 3/2 Transition Met Chem (2014) 39:461–467 463 123 N4) from two different L1 ligands and two oxygen atoms (O2, O3) belonging to two different btec4- ligands to give a trigonal pyramidal geometry, with a s4 value of 0.85 [24]. The angle of O3–N1–N4 is 67.93(11). The bond lengths of Co–N1, Co–N4, Co–O2, and Co–O3 are 2.052(4), 2.048(4), 1.942(3), and 1.951(3) A˚ , respectively. The bond angles range from 101.13(14) to 122.85(15), which are comparable to values observed for similar cobalt(II) com- plexes [25]. In the structure of complex 1, the L1 ligand adopts cis- conformation, with the dihedral angle between the mean planes of the two benzimidazole rings being 89.64(2). These L1 ligands act in a bis-monodentate mode, bridging neighboring Co atoms into inﬁnite 1D [CoL]n zigzag chains with a distance between adjacent Co atoms of 11.290(1) A˚ . Furthermore, four carboxyl groups of the btec4- ligands assume monodentate coordination modes to extend the [CoL]n chains into a 2D (4,4) layer (Fig. 1b). In order to understand the architecture of complex 1 more fully, the topological method has been used to simplify and analyze the 2D structure by TOPOS 4.0 software [26]. The L1 ligands can be simpliﬁed to be linear connectors; the cobalt center should be considered as a 4-connected node, connected by two L2 and btec4- ligands. The btec4- ligands linking four Co atoms should also be viewed as 4-connected nodes. The network of 1 shows a uninodal 2D 4-connected sql topology with point symbol of {44.62} (Fig. 1c). As is shown in this ﬁgure, the grid-like layer is made of rhomboids and irregular squares with a through- ligand Co–Co distance of 5.5438(6) A˚ for anionic btec4- ligands, and 11.2859(5) A˚ for L1 ligand, providing a dis- torted (4,4) structure (the red nodes represent btec4- ligands, and the blue nodes are Co atoms). In addition, the crystal packing is enhanced by two kinds of weak C–HO hydrogen bonds (C19–H19O4A: 3.244(6) A˚ , 154; C27– H27O4B: 3.296(6) A˚ , 164, symmetry codes: A = 2-x, 2-y, -z; B = x, 5/2-y, 1/2 ? z) between L1 and atom O4 of the btec4- ligands. Complex 2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnna. X-ray crystal structural determination reveals that complex 2 has an inﬁnite 1D ladder-like chain structure. The asymmetric unit consists of one Co(II) center, one anionic bdc2- ligand, one L2 ligand, and one lattice water molecules. The Co atom is coordinated by four oxygens (O1, O2, O1C, O2C) from two different bdc2- ligands and two nitrogen atoms (N1, N1C) (symmetry code: C = -x ? 1, y, -z ? 3/2) from two L2 ligands in a distorted octahedral conﬁguration (Fig. 2a). The bond lengths of Co1–O1, Co1–O2, and Co–N are 2.215(2), 2.124(2), and 2.1228(19) A˚ , respectively. The coordination angles range from 60.35(7) to 157.98(8). In complex 2, each bdc2- ligand adopts a chelating coordination mode connecting two neighboring Co atoms to form a 1D [Co2(bdc)2] zigzag chain (Fig. 2b). Each L2 ligand adopts a cis-conformation to link [Co2(bdc)2] units, developing a 1D ladder-like chain (Fig. 2c). The adjacent non-bonding CoCo distances are 9.391(9) (Co1Co1D) and 12.512(8) A˚ (Co1Co1E) (symmetry codes: D = 2.5-x, 1-y, z; E = x, 1 ? y, z). In addition, these 1D chains are further extended into a 3D supramolecular architecture by ﬁve kinds of C–Hp hydrogen bonds (Table 3). The distances of HCg are from 2.73(3) to 2.93(3) A˚ , and the angles of C–HCg are in the range of 112(4)–155(4). These weak interactions play an important role in strengthening the stability in such metal–organic coordination polymers. Fig. 2 a Coordination environment of the Co atom in 2, hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity, and symmetry transformation was used to generating equivalent atoms: C = -x ? 1, y, -z ? 3/2; D = 2.5-x, 1-y, z; E = x, 1 ? y, z; b 1D zigzag chain connected by Co atoms and bdc2- ligands in 2; c 1D ladder-like chain connected by L2 and bdc2- ligands in 2 464 Transition Met Chem (2014) 39:461–467 123 The diversity of structures obtained in this and other studies results from factors including the conformation of the ligands and the choice of anions [27]. Complexes related to 1 and 2 were reported previously, namely [Co(L3)(btec)0.5]n (3), [CoCl2(L2)]n(DMF)n/2(CH3OH)n/4 (4), and [CoCl2(L2)]2(DMF)2 (5) (L3 = 1,4-bis(2-methyl- benzimidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene, DMF = N,N-dimethyl- formamide) [28, 29]. In all ﬁve complexes 1–5, the ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) ligands adopt cis- or trans-conforma- tions to connect the Co centers, but exhibit different tor- sional arrangements, leading to a variety of different non- bonding CoCo distances and distinct geometries. Table 4 compares the geometries obtained in these complexes. Complex 2 displays a 1D ladder-like chain structure, while 4 features 1D linear chain, and 5 is a dinuclear complex. The different structures can be attributed to distinct con- formations of the L2 in complexes 4 and 5. In complexes 1 and 3, the Co atom displays four-coor- dinated environment connecting btec4- and different ﬂex- ible bis(benzimidazole) ligands (L1 or L3) to perform two kinds of 2D layer structures. While 1 and 3 show different conﬁgurations (trigonal pyramid for 1, tetrahedron for 3), which may result from the different conformations of the ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) ligands (cis for L1, trans for L3), these results reveal that the conformations of such ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) ligands have an important effect on the ﬁnal structures of the complexes. Thermal properties and XRPD analysis Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were car- ried out to measure the thermal stabilities of complexes 1 and 2, as shown in Fig. 3. There is only one weight-loss stage for complex 1, but a two-step weight-loss process was observed for complex 2. For complex 1, a rapid weight loss in the range of 390–565 C corresponds to the decomposition of all organic ligand, and the remaining residue is CoO (calcd: 13.6 %; found: 14.3 %). The TGA curve of complex 2 shows that the compound begins to lose weight above 20 C. Water is lost steadily, giving an overall loss of 2.8 % at 160 C (calcd: 3.1 %). The weight loss continues from 351 to 502 C, and the ﬁnal residue is CoO (calcd: 12.9 %; found: 13.2 %).

The experimental and computer-simu- lated XRPD patterns of the complexes are shown in Fig. 4. The XRPD patterns of both as-synthesized products closely match the simulated ones from the single-crystal data, indicating that both complexes are in a pure phase. Photoluminescence properties The photoluminescence properties of complexes 1 and 2, and the free ligands L1 and L2 have been recorded in the solid state at room temperature (Fig. 5). The free ligands L1 and L2 display emission maxima at 305 and 345 nm, respec- tively (kex = 290 nm for L1, and kex = 280 nm for L2), which can be assigned to p ? p* transitions [30–32]. An emission peak can be observed at about 360 nm for complex 1 and 316 nm for 2, when both complexes are excited at 300 nm. For complex 1, the red shift of the emission peak, by 55 nm compared to free ligand L1, probably arises from ligand-centered p–p* electronic transitions within the benzimidazole rings of the L1 ligand [33]. Compared with the free ligand L2, the emission maximum of complex 2 is blue-shifted, which may be assigned to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition. Conclusion In summary, two Co(II) coordination polymers have been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized. The structural differences between complexes 1 and 2 probably arise from the different conformations (cis or trans) of the ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) ligand and the role played by the different anionic ligands in the assembly of the resulting frameworks.
