Manuscript Synthesis, ﬂuorescence, and sorption properties of cobalt coordination polymers of the N,N0-bis(4-pyridylmethyl)naphthalene diimide ligand Guo-Bi Li1 • Zhi-Hui Liao1 • Rong-Kai Pan1 • Jun-Min Liu2 • Sheng-Gui Liu1 • Zhong Zhang3 Received: 2 May 2015 / Accepted: 7 July 2015 / Published online: 16 July 2015  Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015 Abstract Three cobalt coordination polymers, namely {[Co(4-pmntd)2(CF3SO3)(H2O)](CF3SO3)(C2H5OH)0.5 (HCCl3)H2O}n (1), {[Co(4-pmntd)(H2O)4](NO3)2H2O}n (2), and {[Co(4-pmntd)(pta)(CH3OH)2]2(CHCl3)}n (3) (4- pmntd = N,N0-bis(4-pyridylmethyl)-naphthalene diimide; pta = terephthalate), have been synthesized by reactions of 4-pmntd with Co(CF3SO3)24H2O, Co(NO3)26H2O, and Co(pta), respectively. The complexes have been charac- terized by elemental analyses, powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analyses, IR spectroscopy, and single- crystal X-ray diffraction. In complex 1, the ligand adopts U-mode, resulting in a dumbbell-like 2D (4, 4)-sql net structure in a non-interpenetrating edge-to-edge arrange- ment. The Z-mode ligand arrangement leads to 1D zigzag chains for complex 2, and a 2D twofold interpenetrating bat-like (4, 4)-sql net for complex 3. A solution of complex 2 in DMF showed a change in color and remarkably enhanced ﬂuorescence upon the addition of two equiva- lents of acetate, whereas other anions did not induce a color change. Hence, complex 2 can act as a highly promising acetate-detecting reagent. Their thermal and the gas adsorption properties of complexes 1 and 3 were investigated. Introduction Over the past decade, the growing ﬁeld of the design and construction of porous coordination polymers (PCPs) has attracted much interest, not only because of their intriguing structural diversity but also their promise as materials for applications in photoluminescence, gas adsorption, catalysis, magnetism, sensing, and so on [1]. The construction of PCPs mainly depends on the nature of the metal ions and organic ligands [2]. In order to obtain predictable coordination polymers and functionalities, many researchers have focused on the design and synthesis of new organic ligands and their corresponding PCPs, including multidentate imidazoyl- or pyridyl-based derivatives, polycarboxylates. [3–5]. How- ever, many factors such as the coordination environment of the metal center, the donor sets of the ligand, solvent choice, temperature, template, and counterion can affect the self- assembly process [6, 7]. In particular, the topologies of coordination polymers constructed from neutral ligands depend on the counter-anions, which can either coordinate to the metal center or be accommodated in the framework, thereby greatly inﬂuencing the resultant coordination poly- mer architectures [8–11]. Consequently, it is also important to study the inﬂuence of anions on the resulting frameworks of coordination polymers.

However, bis-pyridyl ligands having a backbone capable of hydrogen bonding or pp interactions have not been explored in much detail. To get access to such N-donor ditopic ligands, much effort has been focused in the last decade or so to design bis-pyridyl ligands having a non-innocent backbone (capable of such interac- tions) [1]. Previously, we synthesized a semirigid ligand N,N0-bis(4-pyridyl-methyl)naphthalene diimide having such a non-innocent backbone. The assembly of this ligand with different zinc salts gave three 1D chain complexes [16]. As part of our ongoing study of coordination polymers of dii- mide ligands, this ligand reacted with Co(CF3SO3)2, Co(NO3)2, and Co(pta), in an effort to investigate the inﬂuence of the anions on the structural diversity and properties of the resulting complexes [17–19]. Three 1D and 2D cobalt complexes were obtained. Solutions of complex 2 in DMF showed obvious color variation and ﬂuorescence enhancement induced by the presence of acetate [20–22]. The thermal and gas adsorption properties of complexes 1 and 3 were investigated. The results of these experiments are reported in this paper. Experimental Materials and instruments Chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without further puriﬁcation. The 4-pmntd ligand was prepared according to our previous report [13]. Elemental analyses (C, H, N, S) were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400 cm-1 on a VECTOR 22 spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (Cu-Ka, 1.5418 A˚ ) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Thermal analyses were performed on a TGA V5.1A Dupont 2100 instrument from room temperature to 800 C with a heating rate of 10 C min-1 under nitrogen, and the data obtained were consistent with the crystal structures. Fluorescence mea- surements were performed on a Czemy-Turer FLS920 luminescence spectrometer. UV–visible absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-2501PC UV–visible spectropho- tometer. The adsorption isotherms of O2 and N2 at 77 K were measured using a BELmax 00027 adsorption instru- ment (BEL Japan). A precisely measured amount of the sample was introduced into the gas sorption instrument after pre-desolvation in a Schlenk tube at 120 C under vacuum for 24 h. The adsorbate was placed into the sample tube; then the change of pressure was monitored, and the degree of adsorption was determined by the decrease in pressure at the equilibrium state. The sorption properties were analyzed using Autosorb 1 for Windows 1.24 software. Synthesis of complex 1 EtOH (2 mL) was carefully added dropwise over a solution of 4-pmntd (40 mg, 0.1 mmol) in CHCl3 (10 mL). A solution of Co(CF3SO3)24H2O (54 mg, 0.125 mmol) in EtOH (3 mL) was been layered over the buffer layer. The solution was left to stand for 3 weeks at room temperature, and red crystals of {[Co(4-pmntd)2(CF3SO3)(H2O)](CF3- SO3)(C2H5OH)0.5(HCCl3)H2O}n, complex 1 were col- lected in 23 % yield based on ligand.

Structure determination Diffraction data were collected on an Oxford Gemini S Ultra diffractometer equipped with Cu-Ka radiation (k = 1.54178 A˚ ) for compounds 1, 2, and 3 at 150, 293, 692 Transition Met Chem (2015) 40:691–697 123 and 298 K, respectively, by u and x scans. Multiscan adsorption corrections were applied for each compound. The structures were solved by direct methods (SHELXS) and reﬁned by the full-matrix least-squares method against Fo 2 using the SHELXTL software [23, 24]. Coordinates of the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. Most hydrogen atoms were introduced in calculated positions and reﬁned with ﬁxed geometries with respect to their carrier atoms. The hydrogen atoms of the crystal water molecules could not be located and were not included in the reﬁnement, due to their weak diffraction and disorder. CIF ﬁles containing complete information on the studied structures have been deposited with the CCDC, and the deposition numbers of complexes 1, 2, 3 are 1,053,396, 1,045,750, and 966,853, respectively.

As seen from Fig. 1, the Co2? center in complex 1 is six-coordinated, having an octahedral CoN4- O2 environment consisting of four N atoms from four different 4-pmntd ligands occupying the equatorial plane, plus O atoms from a water ligand and a CF3SO3 2 anion at the apexes. As a ditopic ligand, 4-pmntd is composed of a large rigid spacer of three fused rings and two ﬂexible Py arms. Since the two Py arms can rotate freely around the methylene groups, two main conformations are possible, namely Z-mode with two Py rings at either sides of the spacer or U-mode with two Py rings at the same side of the spacer. One of the notable structural features of complex 1 is that the 4-pmntd ligands take the U conformation to act as connectors, while the Co2? ions are used as nodes. This results in a dumbbell-like M–L connected pattern, which can be represented by (4, 4) topological grids (Fig. 2). In contrast, in complexes 2 and 3, the ligand adopts the Z- mode, which is more commonly observed [1, 12–15]. The M4L4 rhombic grid has an average edge length of 15.2 A˚ , such that another non-coordinated CF3SO3 - ion is encap- sulated within the rhombic grid. In the dumbbell-like connections, two opposite ligands share a strong pp interaction between the inter-naphthalene diimide planes (with a core naphthalene centroid distance of 3.608 A˚ ); and the resulting layers are further stacked in an offset style into a 3D framework with 1D quadrangle channels (Fig. 3). Solvent molecules are located between the layers; the potential solvent volume in the complex 1 is 14.8 %. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic system with space group C2/c and features a 1D zigzag chain structure. Each Co2? center is six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two pyridine groups of two different 4-pmntd ligands on the apexes, plus four O atoms from four independent water ligands in the equatorial plane. The Co–N and Co–O bond lengths are 2.109(3), plus 2.104(3) A˚ and 2.136(3) A˚ , respectively, while the N–Co–O bond angles range from 88.97(12) to 89.92(11) (Fig. 4). The 4-pmntd ligand adopts the Z-mode conformation, acting as a bridge that links two Co2? centers into a zigzag chain (Figure S2). The NO3 - counter-anions are not coordinated to the Co atoms, hence complex 2 has a 1D zigzag chain structure. A normal parallel packing of the 1D chains generates quadrangle channels which are occupied by guest water molecules and NO3 - anions (Fig. 5). As seen from Fig. 6, the Co2? center in complex 3 is six- coordinated, having an octahedral CoN2O4 environment provided by the N atoms from two different 4-pmntd ligands, two O atoms from two different pta ligands in the equatorial positions, and two O atoms from methanol ligands at the apexes. A noteworthy structural feature of complex 3 is that the 4-pmntd ligands take Z conformation to act as connectors, while the Co2? centers are connected in a zigzag way to form a 1D polymeric chain. The pta counter- anions are coordinated to the Co atoms, connecting them into a linear chain, so giving complex 3 a 2D network structure. The 1D zigzag chains have a normal parallel Fig. 1 Coordination environment of the Co2? center in complex 1 Fig. 2 Dumbbell-like connection mode and (4, 4) net observed in complex 1 Fig. 3 Edge-to-edge packing scheme among (4, 4) net layers Fig. 4 Coordination environment of the Co2? center in complex 2 694 Transition Met Chem (2015) 40:691–697 123 packing arrangement, and the pta ligands act as linear bis- connectors, bridging the metal centers as pillars, resulting in a (4, 4) topological network (Fig. 7). The individual 2D (4, 4) networks in complex 3 are interpenetrating with adjacent networks, generating a 3D twofold interpenetrating network with 1D quadrangle channels which are occupied by chlo- roform guest molecules (Fig. 8). Since the primary ligand, metal ion, and synthetic method for complexes 1–3 are the same, the structural diversity of 1D coordination polymer chains, 2D non-in- terpenetrating dumbbell-like (4, 4)-sql network, and 2D twofold interpenetrating (4, 4)-sql network can be attrib- uted to the different coordination abilities and geometries of the counter-anions as well as the different conformations offered by the 4-pmntd ligand (Scheme 1). In complex 1, the CF3SO3 - anions participate in coordination, and there are pp stacking interactions between the naphthalene rings [14]. Hence, the 4-pmntd ligand replaces the coor- dinated solvent molecules, giving rise to six-coordinated Co2? centers with NPy–Co–NPy angles of 180.00(4). The 4-pmntd ligands take the U conformation to act as con- nectors, and the Co2? centers are used as nodes, resulting in dumbbell-like 2D sheets in a non-interpenetrating (4, 4) network. In complexes 2 and 3, the ligand adopts Z-mode. In complex 2, the NO3 - anion is not coordinated; instead, the small water molecules enter the coordination sphere, resulting in six-coordinated Co2? centers. The linear arrangement of the 4-pmntd ligands leads to formation of a relatively common 1D zigzag chain. In complex 3, the pta ligands act as linear bisconnectors, bridging the metal centers as pillars, resulting in a (4, 4) topological network. There are no pp stacking interactions between the adja- cent layers, so the individual 2D (4, 4) networks in com- plex 3 are interpenetrating with adjacent networks. Thermal stability The thermal stabilities of the complexes have been checked by recording thermogravimetric (TG) curves. Figure 9 shows the curve for the complex 1. Two main weight loss steps were observed in the temperature range from 25 to 600 C. The ﬁrst occurs in the range of 25–130 C, amounting to about 7.6 % and corresponding to escape of 1.25 ethanol molecules, 1.0 water molecules, and 0.25 chloroform molecules (calculated 7.8 %). The compound remains undecomposed up to 410 C, whereupon the second weight loss starts. Decomposition of the complex is complete at about 550 C. As to complex 2, two main weight loss steps were observed in the temperature range from 25 to 600 C. The ﬁrst occurs in the range of 25–155 C, amounting to about 11.8 % and corresponding to escape of 5.0 water molecules (calculated 12.5 %). The compound remains undecomposed up to the onset of the second weight loss at 300 C, and decomposition of the complex is complete at about 530 C. Complex 3 has two main weight loss steps in the temperature range from 25 to 600 C. The ﬁrst occurs between 25 and 110 C, amounting to about 8.5 % and corresponding to escape of one chloroform molecule Fig. 5 Parallel packing of 1D chains showing guest molecules ﬁlling fashion in complex 2 Fig. 6 Coordination environment of the Co2? center in complex 3 Fig. 7 2D network with the (4, 4) topology in complex 3 Fig. 8 Twofold interpenetrating (4, 4) net with 1D quadrangle channels occupied by chloroform molecules in complex 3 Transition Met Chem (2015) 40:691–697 695 123 (calculated 10.5 %). The compound is then stable up to 330 C, at which point the second weight loss starts. Decomposition of the complex is complete at about 450 C. UV–visible absorption and photoluminescence The UV–visible absorption spectra of the free ligand and its complexes 1–3 in DMF solution (1 9 10-5 mol L-1) are shown in Figure S3. The spectra of the complexes are similar to that of the free ligand, suggesting that the ligands provide the key absorption features for the complexes. Thus, the absorption bands from 280 to 350 nm are mostly attributed to the p–p* transitions of the ligands. The absorption spectrum of complex 2 shows remarkably enhanced intensity at 640 nm (Fig. 10), accompanied by a change in color from violet to blue (Figure S4), upon the addition of two equiva- lents of acetate (as NaOAc). For comparison, addition of two equivalents of Cl-, Br-, or I- to a DMF solution of complex 2 gave no obvious changes in its UV–visible spectrum or the color of the solution. The ﬂuorescence properties of the free ligand (4-pmntd) and its complexes were also studied at room temperature in DMF solution (10-5 mol L-1; Fig- ure S5). Here again, the emission spectra of complexes 1–3 resembled that of free 4-pmntd excluding peak positions and the emission intensity (with kmax = 420 nm upon excitation at 320 nm). Interestingly, the emission intensity of complex 2 increased gradually upon the addition of two equivalents of acetate. To further understand this phenomenon, the same experiments were performed with the introduction of F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, N3 -, SCN-, and Ox2- (Ox2- = oxalate2-), into the system (Fig. 11).When two equivalents of these anions were added to a DMF solution of complex 2, the luminescence intensity decreased, which is different from the effect of adding AcO-. (Figure S6). We speculate that the variation arises because AcO- anions can coordinate to Co2? centers in complex 2, leading to a change in coordi- nation environment of the Co2? centers, with associated changes in color and ﬂuorescence. Such speculation is sup- ported by M06L/DZP level calculations [25–28] as well as polarizable continuum models (PCM) in DMF solution [29], Scheme 1 Structural diversity in complexes 1–3 100 200 300 400 500 600 0 20 40 60 80 100 Weight/ % T/ 0C complex 2 complex 1 complex 3 Fig. 9 Thermogravimetric analysis of the complexes 1–3 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Abs wavelength/nm blank I- Br- Cl- AcO- Fig. 10 UV–visible absorption spectra of complex 2 in DMF with the addition of Cl-, Br-, I-, and AcO- anions 696 Transition Met Chem (2015) 40:691–697 123 since the calculations indicate that the simpliﬁed pyridine ligand could be easily dissociated from the mononuclear Co2? complex at ambient temperature (See Figure S1 in the ESI). Sorption properties The seemingly high thermal stability of the frameworks of complexes 1 and 3 inspired us to study their adsorption properties. Thus, gas sorption experiments toward O2 and N2 at 77 K were carried out. As seen from Figures S7–8, the desolvated solid complexes 1 and 3 both adsorb N2 gas to show a type I isotherm at low pressure, indicating permanent microporosity of both complexes. The gas sorption shows a small amount of hysteresis between the sorption/desorption curves and obvious capillary condensation at relatively high pressure, suggesting a small amount of mesoporosity in the desolvated material, which can be attributed to nanosized intercrystalline voids or mesopores within the mosaic pseudomorphs that remain after desolvation. Complexes 1 and 3 adsorb 120.15 and 138.16 cm3 g-1, respectively, (STP) N2 at P/P0 = 1.0. The Langmuir surface areas are estimated as 102.35 and 112.48 m2 g-1, respectively. For O2 uptake, complex 1 shows almost no sorption, only 7.15 cm3 g-1 (STP) at P/P0 = 1.0, hence demonstrating selective sorption behavior of N2 over O2. The O2 sorption of complex 3 increases abruptly at the beginning and reaches 53.5 cm3 g-1 (STP) at P/P0 = 1.0. Conclusions Three coordination polymers were constructed from the 4-pmntd ligand and cobalt, using different counter-anions. The structural diversity in these compounds is attributed to the coordination versatility of the primary ligand, together with the coordination preferences of the secondary ligand. Complex 2 showed remarkably enhanced ﬂuorescence intensity in the presence of acetate, together with a color change. Hence, complex 2 is a promising compound for the detection of acetate.

Theoretical predicted ligands dissociation Gibbs free energies (in kcal/mol). Our fluorescence experiments indicated that the 4-pmntd ligand(s) might be partially dissociated from cobalt complex 2 in the DMF solvent. In order to prove this assumption, simplified mononuclear complex, namely Co(Ac)2(H2O)(py), was investigated with respect to step-wise dissociation into Co(Ac)2 and free H2O or py ligands (Figure S1). The 19 electron Co(Ac)2(H2O) (py) was found to be unstable for giving free py ligand at ambient temperature condition, because of the very small dissociation Gibbs free energies (less than 4.7 kcal/mol in Figure S1). The original 4-pmntd ligand was replaced by smaller C5H5N group for reducing the computational time. The cobalt complexes were predicted in high spin states with three unpaired electrons.
