All three polymers crystallize in the same monoclinic space group P21/n. The complexes are assem- bled into 1D helical chains, and each adjacent helical chain of the same chirality is further connected to form a chiral layer by hydrogen bond interactions. The layers are packed in alternating left-(M) and right-handed (P) chirality arrays. Magnetic studies reveal the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling interactions in complexes 1 and 2. Introduction In recent decades, the study of helical coordination poly- mers has attracted a great deal of interest due to the formation of esthetically appealing topologies and their potential applications in the ﬁelds of enantiomer separa- tion, helical magnetic materials, nonlinear optics, asym- metric catalysis, biological sensors, and host–guest interactions [1–9]. In order to prepare such helical coor- dination polymers, much effort has been devoted to using appropriately designed bridging ligands, with individual building blocks connected through metal-ligand coordina- tion or weak interactions such as combinations of hydrogen bonding interactions and aromatic stacking effects [10]. Both Lin’s and Hong’s groups have designed a variety of bridging ligands based on atropisomeric 1,10-binaphthyl frameworks and have constructed some novel helical metal– organic complexes with promising applications [11–14]. 2,20-Dihydroxy-[1,10]-binaphthalene-3,30-dicarboxylate (H4bna) is a multifunctional ligand containing carboxylic groups in the 3,30- positions and phenoxy groups in the 2,20- positions of the binaphthyl framework, which can potentially afford various coordination modes, such as monodentate, chelating bidentate, bridging bis-bidentate, chelating bis- bidentate, and bridging hexadentate. Such V-shaped ligands also possess both rigidity and ﬂexibility due to the variable twist of the naphthyl rings across the C-C single bond at the 1,10-positions of the binaphthyl framework. However, so far the reported complexes containing a H4bna ligand have only focused on d10 metals [15–20] plus two examples of indium– binaphthalenyl dicarboxylate complexes [21], which display uncommon structural features and interesting photolumi- nescent activities. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of discrete polynuclear complexes or metal coordination polymers constructed with the other ﬁrst row transition metals and H4bna ligand so far. In this paper, we present the syntheses, structures, and characterization of three new metal complexes of H4bna, namely {[M(H2bna)(DMF)2(H2O)2]DMF}n (M = Co for 1, Mn Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11243-012-9588-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

The magnetic properties of complexes 1 and 2 have been investigated. Experimental All chemicals were commercially available and used as received without further puriﬁcation. Racemic 2,20-dihy- droxy-[1,10]-binaphthalene-3,30-dicarboxylate (H4bna) was prepared according to the literature method [22]. IR spectra were recorded as KBr pellets using a Nicolet 360 FTIR spectrometer. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were performed on a Vario EL analyser. Thermogravimetric analyses were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Dia- mond TG analyzer at a rate of 10 C/min from room temperature to 1,006 C (except 2 to 632 C) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected on a Rigaku D/max 2,200 diffractometer with Cu-Ka radiation. The magnetic sus- ceptibility measurements were carried out on polycrystal- line samples using a Quantum Design SQUID-MPMS-XL magnetometer in the temperature range 2–300 K and magnetic ﬁeld up to 5 T. Diamagnetic corrections were estimated from Pascal’s constants. Preparation of {[Co(H2bna)(DMF)2(H2O)2]DMF}n (1) A solution of Co(NO3)26H2O (0.0291 g, 0.05 mmol) and H4bna (0.0187 g, 0.05 mmol) in DMF/MeOH/H2O (4:1:1, 6 mL) was stirred for 20 min in air and then placed in a Parr Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL). After addition of 0.1 M NaOH (0.3 mL), the vessel was sealed and heated at 80 C for 72 h, then cooled to room tem- perature. Red crystals of 1 were collected by ﬁltration, washed with water, and dried in air (yield 45% based on Co). Anal. Calc. for C31H37N3O11Co (%): C, 54.4; H, 5.7; N, 6.5. Found: C, 54.2; H, 5.4; N, 6.1.

X-ray crystallography Suitable single crystals of 1–3 were selected and mounted onto thin glass ﬁbers. Measurements were taken at 185(2) K using a Bruker CCDArea Detector with graphite- monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). The structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-97 program package and reﬁned against F2 by full-matrix least-squares methods with SHELXL-97 [23, 24] with anisotropic thermal parameters for all the non- hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms were introduced into geometrically calculated positions and reﬁned riding on the corresponding parent atoms. A summary of crystallo- graphic and structural reﬁnement data for 1–3 is given in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table S1. Hydrogen bonds are listed in Table 2.

Results and discussion Synthesis and structure description Hydrothermal synthesis is a powerful technique for the synthesis of new materials with diverse structural archi- tectures. Under relatively high temperature and pressure, the problems associated with ligand solubility can be well solved. Hence, due to the low solubility of the H4bna ligand, a hydrothermal synthesis was adopted in this work. Crystals of three coordination polymers assembled from H4bna with metal(II) salts (metal = Co, Mn or Ni) were isolated under similar conditions. However, the equivalent reactions of Cu(II) or Fe(II) salts with H4bna give only unknown powder samples rather than crystals after using a wide variety of reaction conditions including pH value, reaction time, temperature, and molar ratio of reactants. The inﬂuences of anions on the formation of the complexes using metal salts with different anions (NO3 -, ClO4 - and 292 Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:291–296 123 Cl-) as starting materials have also been examined; how- ever, identical complexes were obtained in all the tested cases. Complexes 1–3 are isomorphous, so only the structure of 1 will be discussed in detail as representative. As shown in Fig. 1, the asymmetric unit of 1 has a crystallographi- cally independent Co center, displaying a slightly distorted Table 1 Crystallographic data and reﬁnement summary for 1–3 1 2 3 Empirical formula C31H37CoN3O11 C31H37MnN3O11 C31H37NiN3O11 Formula weight 686.57 682.58 686.35 Crystal system Monoclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Space group P2(1)/n P2(1)/n P2(1)/n a (A˚ ) 12.4406 (7) 12.4876 (8) 12.4098 (6) b (A˚ ) 11.0013 (6) 11.0763 (7) 10.8922 (6) c (A˚ ) 23.5199 (12) 23.6702 (15) 23.5728 (12) b () 91.2600 (10) 91.3480 (10) 90.8240 (10) V(A˚ 3) 3,218.2 (3) 3,273.1 (4) 3,186.0 (3) Z 4 4 4 DCalc (g cm-3) 1.417 1.385 1.431 l (Mo-Ka) (mm-1) 0.597 0.466 0.674 F(000) 1,436 1,428 1,440 h () 1.73–25.25 1.72–25.09 1.73–25.10 Reﬂections collected/unique (Rint) 18,735/5,822 (0.0234) 18,491/5,730 (0.0275) 18,358/5,651 (0.0272) GOF on F2 1.045 1.024 1.042 R indices [I [ 2r (I)] R1 = 0.0452, wR2 = 0.1179 R1 = 0.0445, wR2 = 0.1127 R1 = 0.0395, wR2 = 0.0997 R indices (all data) R1 = 0.0572, wR2 = 0.1268 R1 = 0.0576, wR2 = 0.1218 R1 = 0.0492, wR2 = 0.1053 Largest diff. peak and hole (e A-3) 0.862, -0.256 1.142, -0.345 0.348, -0.247 Table 2 Hydrogen bonds (A˚ and ) for 1–3 D–HA d (HA) d (DA) \DHA 1 O(3)–H(3A)O(1) 1.81 2.541 (3) 147.6 O(4)–H(4A)O(5) 1.79 2.529 (3) 148.8 O(9)–H(9B)O(2) 1.87 2.647 (3) 150.4 O(9)–H(9A)O(5)a 1.79 2.651 (3) 179.5 O(10)–H(10B)O(11)b 1.91 2.732 (4) 162.5 O(10)–H(10A)O(9)c 1.96 2.808 (3) 178.8 2 O(3)–H(3A)O(1) 1.79 2.534 (2) 146.8 O(4)–H(4A)O(5) 1.78 2.533 (2) 148.3 O(9)–H(9B)O(2) 1.90 2.667 (2) 149.1 O(9)–H(9A)O(5)a 1.81 2.674 (2) 178.1 O(10)–H(10B)O(11)b 1.90 2.726 (3) 163.1 O(10)–H(10A)O(9)c 1.93 2.775 (2) 175.9 3 O(3)–H(3A)O(1) 1.80 2.547 (2) 146.9 O(4)–H(4A)O(5) 1.80 2.547 (2) 146.9 O(9)–H(9B)O(2) 1.86 2.636 (2) 151.3 O(9)–H(9A)O(5)a 1.77 2.636 (2) 177.7 O(10)–H(10B)O(11)b 1.91 2.731 (3) 161.9 O(10)–H(10A)O(9)c 1.97 2.806 (2) 177.5 Symmetry codes: a -x ? 1/2, y - 1/2, -z ? 1/2; b x - 1/2, - y ? 3/2, z - 1/2; c -x ? 3/2, y ? 1/2, -z ? 1/2 Fig. 1 The coordination environment of Co(II) in complex 1.

The Co1 center is coordinated by four equatorial O atoms from two carboxylate groups of two H2bna ligands, plus two DMF ligands, and two apical O atoms from two water ligands. The trans angles around the Co center range from 176.58(8) to 177.45(7), while the cis angles range from 86.98(8) to 92.98(8). The coordi- nated carboxylate groups in the H2bna ligands are both monodentate. Thus, adjacent Co centers are linked by the H2bna ligands to form a 1D 21 helical chain along the b axis (Fig. 2). The naphthyl rings of the H2bna ligands subtend a dihedral angle of 79.705(44), which is consis- tent with the values reported for related complexes [18]. Each helix contains two Co(H2bna)(DMF)2(H2O)2 motifs with a pitch of 11.001(2) A˚ , and there is a degree of interlacing of the helices. Interestingly, the right-handed (P) helical chain is composed of only (Sa) enantiomers and the left-handed (M) helical chain is composed of only (Ra) enantiomers of the ligand, which demonstrates that the orientation of the helices is determined by the axial chi- rality of the ligand [21]. Each adjacent helical chain of the same chirality is further connected to form a chiral layer by the hydrogen bond interactions of O10–H10AO9 (sym- metry code: -x ? 3/2, y ? 1/2, -z ? 1/2), O9–H9AO5 (symmetry code: -x ? 1/2, y - 1/2, -z ? 1/2), and O9– H9BO2 in the ab plane (Fig. 3). It is worth emphasizing that the hydrogen-bonded chiral layers are packed in alternating left-(M) and right-handed (P) chirality arrays in the overall structure (Fig. 4), namely each layer con- structed from homochiral ligands is chiral while the ligands in two neighboring layers are enantiomeric. In addition, weak intramolecular hydrogen bond interactions between O3–H3AO1 and O4–H4AO5 provide further contri- butions to the stabilization of the structure. There are no signiﬁcant interactions between adjacent layers. So far, eight types of coordination modes of bna2-, including chelating bidentate, chelating/bridging plus che- lating bidentate, bridging bis-bidentate, chelating bis- bidentate, bridging hexadentate, monodentate-chelating, monodentate-bidentate and monodentate, have been described in the literature [15–21]. However, in the three complexes reported in this paper, the H2bna ligand acts in a bridging bis-monodentate coordination mode to link the adjacent M2? centers. This novel bridging coordination mode plays an important role in the formation of the 1D chains. Unlike the 1D ladder-like MOF [Cd(H2bna)(b- py)1.5(H2O)2] constructed by the cobridging of 4,40-bipy ancillary ligands [15], or the 1D ribbons [Zn(H2bna)(H2O)2] constructed by the mono bridging bidentate coordination mode to link the adjacent Zn(II) atoms [20], here, the rest of the coordination sites are occupied by DMF and water sol- vent ligands, so the twisted conformation of the ligand results Fig. 2 a Left-handed (M) helical chain viewed along the b direction (b) right-handed (P) helical chain viewed along the b direction.

All DMF are omitted for clarity 294 Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:291–296 123 in the formation of a 1D helical chains. As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst example of helical structure including the H2bna ligand. Physical properties of the complexes Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to examine the thermal stabilities of the three complexes. Their TG curves are very similar (Fig. S1, Supplementary mate- rial), so only the curve of 1 will be discussed in detail as representative. The ﬁrst weight loss of 16.3% in the tem- perature range of 40–125 C corresponds to the loss of guest DMF and two coordinated water ligands (calc. 15.9%). The next weight loss step of 20.8% occurred in the temperature range of 125–255 C, corresponding to the loss of two coordinated DMF ligands (calc. 21.1%). Further heating resulted in decomposition of the ligand. The phase purities of all the products were conﬁrmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses; the patterns measured on the bulk samples were consistent with those simulated from the corresponding single crystal data (Fig. S2, Supplementary material). Magnetic susceptibility measurements for complex 1 were taken on microcrystalline samples of the compound at 0.1 T ﬁeld in the temperature range 2–300 K. The value of vmT for 1 is 3.54 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K (Fig. 5), which is higher than the expected value of 1.88 cm3 K mol-1 for one magnetically isolated high-spin CoII center (S = 3/2) with a g value of 2.0, indicating relatively strong spin-orbit coupling [25]. Upon cooling, the vmT value decreases continuously, reaching a value of 1.27 cm3 K mol-1 at 2.0 K. The best linear ﬁt according to the Curie–Weiss law vm = C/(T - h) in the temperature range of 70–300 K gave a Curie constant of 3.985 cm3 K mol-1 and a Weiss constant of -34.785 K (Fig. 6). The negative Weiss con- stant suggests the presence of dominant antiferromagnetic coupling in complex 1. The temperature dependence of the molar susceptibility vm and the product vmT for complex 2, measured at a mag- netic ﬁeld of 1,000 Oe in the temperature range of 2–300 K, is shown in Fig. 5. In the high-temperature region, the vmT value of 300 K is 4.69 cm3 K mol-1, well in agreement with the theoretical value of 4.38 cm3 K mol-1 for one Mn(II) ion with S = 5/2 and g = 2.0. Upon cooling, the vmT value decreases slowly ﬁrst, then much faster in the low- temperature range to reach a value of 2.40 cm3 K mol-1 at 2.0 K, indicating the presence of antiferromagnetic cou- pling. The best linear ﬁt according to the Curie–Weiss law in the temperature range of 50–300 K yields C = 4.75 cm3 K mol-1 and a negative Weiss constant h = -3.55 K Fig. 4 Layer structure packed by the alternating left-(M) and right- handed (P) chirality arrays Fig. 5 Plots of vm and vmT versus T for 1 (solid box, black) and 2 (solid circle, red) measured at an applied ﬁeld of 1 kOe.

Conclusion In summary, three isomorphous coordination polymers were synthesized and characterized. In the three com- plexes, the H4bna ligand acts in a novel bridging bis- monodentate coordination mode to link the adjacent M2? centers to form interesting 1D helical chains, which is distinct from the reported 1D ribbons or the 1D ladder structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst example of helical structure including the H4bna ligand. The results further enrich the coordination modes of the H4bna ligand and show the orientation of the helices is closely correlated with the axial chirality of the H4bna ligand. Subsequent work will be focused on the examina- tions of more metal ions and the inﬂuences of different solvents. Supporting Information TG curves, PXRD plot, selected bond lengths and angles.
