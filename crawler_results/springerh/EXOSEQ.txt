These compounds were structurally characterized by ele- mental analysis, IR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compounds 1 and 2 have a mononuclear struc- ture and the same coordination mode. Compound 3 has a 1D polymeric chain structure. In 1–3, amido group (–NH2) of atza ligand forms hydrogen bond N(5)–H(5)N(O) with the neighboring carboxylate-O, tetrazolate-N or water molecule which stabilized the supramolecular assemblies. Keywords Alkaline earth metal  5-Aminotetrazole-1-acetic acid (Hatza)  Supramolecular coordination compounds Introduction In recent years, enormous efforts have been devoted to select suitable ligands with certain characters, such as ﬂexibility, versatile binding modes and the ability to form coordination compounds with suitable metals through self- assembled means. Therefore, in the self-assembled process, the shapes of the organic ligands play a very important role in the control of the frameworks [1–3]. Tetrazoles and its derivatives have been widely employed as polyfunctional ligands because of the aromaticity and multiple coordi- nating modes in the construction of coordination com- pounds [4–13]. However, tetrazolate–carboxylate ligands have only been the subject of a limited study with metal ions [14–21]. Especially, coordination compounds conju- gated by 5-aminotetrazole-1-acetic acid (Hatza) and alka- line earth metal cations have not been reported before, to the best of our knowledge [19–21]. Thus, it is interesting to study new s-block metal coordination compounds con- taining atza. Based on the soft and hard acid and base theory, alkaline earth metal ions as a hard acid favored to react with hard base which has comparatively strong ability to present electrons like oxygen of the carboxylate group in atza ligand [22, 23]. In this work, we select alkaline earth metal salts M(NO3)2 (M = Mg, Ca, Sr) and ligands Hatza through self-assembled means, produced three new com- plexes [Mg(atza)2(H2O)4] 1), [Ca(atza)2(H2O)4] (2) and [Sr(atza)2(H2O)3].2H2O (3). We report herein on the syn- thesis and structural characterization of the three alkaline earth metal coordination complexes. Experimental Section Materials and General Methods All the materials and reagents were obtained commercially and used without further puriﬁcation. The ligands Hatza were prepared according to a reported procedure [16, 17]. All infra-red (IR) spectra were recorded on KBr discs using a Nicolet Magna-IR 550 spectrometer. CHN microanalyses were performed on a Carlo-Erba EA1110 CHNO-S microanalyzer. J. Yang  Q.-Y. Li (&)  L. Shen  G.-W. Yang  X.-Y. Tang  C. Zhai  H.-D. Ding  J.-N. Jin  W.

Results and Discussion Crystal Structures The X-ray structural analysis reveals that complexes 1, 2, and 3 crystallize in the triclinic space group P ı¯. Complex 1 is a mononuclear structure and the asymmetric unit con- tains half of the [Mg(atza)2(H2O)4] molecule. As shown in Fig. 1, atom Mg(1) lies on an inversion center and is coordinated by four O atoms from the aqua ligands and two O atoms from two atza ligands, forming a slightly distorted MgO6 octahedral coordination geometry. The Mg–O(car- boxlate) bond length [2.070(1) A˚ ] and Mg–O(aqua) bond lengths [2.104(1) and 2.078(1) A˚ ] are comparable with those observed in other Mg(II) compounds, respectively [27–29]. Selected bond lengths and angles of 1 are reported in Table 2. Complex 2 is also a mononuclear structure and there are two crystallographically independent molecules with a minor differences between the coordination bond lengths (Table 3), both of which lie on inversion centres and forming a slightly distorted CaO6 octahedral coordination geometry (Fig. 2). All of the metal–ligand bonds in 2 are longer than the corresponding bonds in 1 due to the fact that the radius of Ca ion is longer than that of Mg ion, as compared in Tables 2, 3 [Ca–O(carboxlate) = 2.353(2), 2.400(3) A˚ ; Ca–O(aqua) = 2.316(3)–2.340(2) A˚ ]. The bond angles in both 1 and 2 also have small differences (Tables 2, 3). The asymmetric unit of complex 3 contains one [Sr(atza)2 (H2O)3] unit and two non-coordinating water molecules. Each Sr(II) center is nine-coordinated by three O atoms from three aqua ligands and six O atoms from four atza ligands that four of the oxygen atoms are from two che- lating atza ligands, while the other two come from atza Table 4 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for [Sr(atza)2(H2O)3]2H2O(3) Sr(1)–O5(B) 2.497(2) Sr(1)–O(7A) 2.531(2) Sr(1)–O(4) 2.577(3) Sr(1)–O(6) 2.692(3) Sr(1)–O(5) 2.697(2) Sr(1)–O(2) 2.703(2) Sr(1)–O(3) 2.723(3) Sr(1)–O(7) 2.744(2) Sr(1)–O(1) 2.764(2) O(5B)–Sr(1)–O(7A) 156.43(8) O(5B)–Sr(1)–O(4) 80.67(8) O(7A)–Sr(1)–O(4) 80.78(8) O(5B)–Sr(1)–O(6) 88.95(8) O(7A)–Sr(1)–O(6) 114.60(8) O(4)–Sr(1)–O(6) 142.77(8) O(5B)–Sr(1)–O(5) 66.30(8) O(7A)–Sr(1)–O(5) 119.86(7) O(4)–Sr(1)–O(5) 135.33(8) O(6)–Sr(1)–O(5) 68.29(8) O(5B)–Sr(1)–O(2) 114.10(7) O(7A)–Sr(1)–O(2) 74.60(7) O(4)–Sr(1)–O(2) 144.26(8) O(6)–Sr(1)–O(2) 72.30(8) O(5)–Sr(1)–O(2) 47.92(6) O(5B)–Sr(1)–O(3) 76.56(8) O(7A)–Sr(1)–O(3) 84.32(8) O(4)–Sr(1)–O(3) 73.59(9) O(6)–Sr(1)–O(3) 138.42(8) O(5)–Sr(1)–O(3) 70.20(8) O(2)–Sr(1)–O(3) 78.49(8) O(5B)–Sr(1)–O(7) 117.76(7) O(7A)–Sr(1)–O(7) 71.02(8) O(4)–Sr(1)–O(7) 75.57(8) O(6)–Sr(1)–O(7) 78.08(8) O(5)–Sr(1)–O(7) 146.19(7) O(2)–Sr(1)–O(7) 118.64(7) O(3)–Sr(1)–O(7) 143.05(7) O(5B)–Sr(1)–O(1) 71.98(7) O(7A)–Sr(1)–O(1) 117.72(7) O(4)–Sr(1)–O(1) 77.70(8) O(6)–Sr(1)–O(1) 65.10(8) O(5)–Sr(1)–O(1) 116.37(7) O(2)–Sr(1)–O(1) 136.96(8) O(3)–Sr(1)–O(1) 140.17(8) O(7)–Sr(1)–O(1) 47.19(6) Symmetry code: A: 1-x, 2-y, -z; B: -x, 2-y, -z Fig. 4 1D polymeric chain of Sr complex (hydrogen atoms and water molecules are omitted for clarity) 1486 J Chem Crystallogr (2011) 41:1483–1489 123 ligands chelating to adjacent Sr(III) centres (Sr1A and Sr1B) (Fig. 3), forming a monocapped square-antiprism coordination geometry. Because the radius of a Sr ion is bigger than that of a Ca ion, all of the metal–ligand bonds in 3 are slightly longer than the corresponding bonds in 2 (Table 4). The Sr–O (carboxlate) bond lengths [2.497(2)– 2.764(2) A˚ ] and Sr–O(aqua) bond lengths [2.572(3)– 2.723(3) A˚ ] are the typical values for Sr–O coordination distances [30–32]. Both O1–C3–O7 and O2–C6–O5 car- boxylate groups chelate the Sr(1), while O(7) and O(5) further bridge the Sr(1A) and Sr(1B), respectively, resulting in the formation of a one-dimensional chain extending along the a axis (Fig. 4). In which, the Sr(1)–O(7)– Sr(1A)–O(7A) deﬁne a parallelogram with the diagonals of 4.296(1) A˚ [Sr(1)Sr(1A)] and 3.069(3) A˚ [O(7)O(7A)], respectively, while the Sr(1)–O(5)–Sr(1B)–O(5B) aslo deﬁne a parallelogram with the diagonals of 4.350(1) A˚ [Sr(1)Sr(1B)] and 2.845(3) A˚ [O(5)O(5B)], respectively. The dihedral angle between planes Sr(1)–O(7)–Sr(1A)– O(7A) and Sr(1)–O(5)–Sr(1B)–O(5B) is 127.7. It is worth noting that the atza ligand in the Mg and Ca complexes acts as a monodentate ligand, with the Mg and Ca having four coordinated water molecules. This phe- nomena has also been spotted in Co complex[20], the atza Table 5 Hydrogen bond lengths (A˚ ) and bond angles () of compounds 1–3 D–HA D—H H…A D…A D—H…A 1 O(3)–H(3A)N(2)#1 0.84(3) 2.33(3) 3.121(1) 158(2) O(3)–H(3B)O(2) 0.84(3) 1.94(3) 2.732(2) 155(3) O(4)–H(4A)N(4)#2 0.97(3) 1.95(3) 2.910(1) 172(3) O(4)–H(4B)O(2)#3 0.80(3) 1.95(3) 2.743(1) 169(2) N(5)–H(5A)O(2)#4 0.841(19) 2.004(19) 2.844(2) 176.7(15) N(5)–H(5B)N(3)#5 0.89(2) 2.21(2) 3.074(2) 164.5(18) C(2)–H(2B)O(1)#6 0.952(18) 2.341(18) 3.270(2) 164.9(16) 2 O(4)–H(4A)O(6)#1 0.96(4) 1.85(4) 2.767(3) 159(4) O(4)–H(4C)N(8)#1 0.96(4) 2.54(4) 3.477(4) 166(3) N(5)–H(5C)N(4)#1 0.90(4) 2.39(4) 3.247(4) 159(4) O(7)–H(7A)N(2)#2 0.96(4) 2.39(4) 3.294(4) 158(3) O(8)–H(8B)N(5) 0.85(4) 2.31(4) 3.127(4) 162(4) N(10)–H(10B)N(3)#2 0.90(4) 2.28(4) 3.162(4) 168(4) N(10)–H(10B)N(4)#2 0.90(4) 2.25(4) 3.064(4) 151(3) N(10)–H(10A)N(3)#3 0.90(4) 2.15(4) 2.922(4) 144(3) 3 O(3)–H(3A)O(6)#1 0.81(4) 2.19(4) 2.977(4) 164(3) O(3)–H(3B)O(8)#2 0.81(3) 2.21(3) 2.978(4) 157(3) O(4)–H(4A)O(9)#3 0.82(3) 2.02(3) 2.834(4) 175(3) O(4)–H(4B)N(3)#2 0.82(2) 2.08(2) 2.891(4) 178(6) N(5)–H(5C)N(4)#4 0.92(3) 2.17(3) 3.077(5) 172(3) N(5)–H(5D)O(9)#3 0.86(4) 2.02(4) 2.870(4) 170(3) O(6)–H(6A)N(2)#5 0.81(3) 2.29(3) 3.041(4) 155(3) O(6)–H(6B)N(8)#6 0.816(10) 2.094(11) 2.886(3) 164(4) O(8)–H(8A)O(3)#1 0.82(3) 2.13(4) 2.946(4) 176(3) O(8)–H(8B)O(1) 0.82(3) 2.02(3) 2.791(3) 155(4) O(9)–H(9A)N(7)#6 0.75(5) 2.17(5) 2.884(4) 159(5) O(9)–H(9B)O(2) 0.86(4) 1.84(4) 2.689(3) 177(6) N(10)–H(10A)O(8)#1 0.78(4) 2.23(4) 3.001(5) 170(5) N(10)–H(10B)N(9)#7 0.88(4) 2.10(4) 2.979(5) 172(4) Symmetry codes:1: (#1) 1 ? x, -1 ? y, z; (#2) 1 ? x, y, -1 ? z; (#3) -x, 2-y, 2-z; (#4) -x, 2-y, 3-z; (#5) 1 ? x, y, z; (#6) -x, 3-y, 2-z. 2: (#1) 1-x, 1-y, 1-z; (#2) x, y, 1 ? z; (#3) 2-x, 1-y, 2-z. 3: (#1) -x, 2-y, -z; (#2) x, -1 ? y, z; (#3) 1-x, 2-y, -z; (#4) 1-x, 3-y, 1-z; (#5) 1-x, 3-y, -z; (#6) -x, 2-y, -1-z; (#7) -x, 1-y, -1-z J Chem Crystallogr (2011) 41:1483–1489 1487 123 acts only as a monodentate ligand coordinates to metal center via its one carboxylate group O atom in Mg, Ca and Co complexes. In Sr complex, carboxylate group from the atza ligand coordinates to metal center in a l1,1,3-COO bridging mode. Obviously, amido group(-NH2) of each atza ligand in complexes 1–3 forms hydrogen bond N(5)–H(5)N(O) with the neighboring carboxylate-O, tetrazolate-N or water mol- ecule (Table 5). These hydrogen bonding interactions and other kinds of hydrogen bonding interactions in 1–3 con- tribute to the formation of the 3D supramolecular architec- tures (Figs. 5, 6 and 7) Conclusions In the present work, three novel hydrogen-bonded supra- molecular networks [Mg(atza)2(H2O)4] (1), [Ca(atza)2 (H2O)4] (2) and [Sr(atza)2(H2O)3].2H2O (3) have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The successful syntheses of 1–3 demonstrate that alkaline earth metal ions as hard acid has a much easier acess to react with oxygen from the carboxylate group of the atza ligand, and amido group(–NH2) of atza ligand tends to form hydrogen bond N(5)–H(5)N(O) with the neighboring carboxylate-O, Fig. 5 The network structure of Mg complex formed via H-bonding interactions Fig. 6 The network structure of Ca complex formed via H-bonding interactions Fig. 7 The network structure of Sr complex formed via H-bonding interactions 1488 J Chem Crystallogr (2011) 41:1483–1489 123 tetrazolate-N or water molecule which can be considered as a stabilizing factor for the supramolecular assemblies.
