Keywords Cobalt(II) complex  Crystal structure  Coordination polymer  Magnetic properties  Dicyanamide  Benzimidazole Introduction In the recent years, metal coordination polymers have received increasing interest because of their intriguing structural topologies and their interesting applications in the areas of magnetic, optical and electronic properties [1–6]. The dicyanamide ligand (dca), [N(CN)2]-, is a remarkably versatile building block for the construction of coordination polymers, since it can act in a mono-, bi-, or tridentate coordination manner. The introduction of N-based bridging and terminal co-ligands into the metal- dca system has lead to many fascinating structures and magnetic properties [7–17]. In this work, a new cobalt(II) coordination polymer [Co(bim)2(dca)2]n (1), (bim = benz- imidazole, dca = dicyanamide) was synthesized. Experimental All reagents were of analytical grade and used without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C analyser. IR spectrum was obtained for KBr pellet on a Nicolet 170SX FT-IR spectrophotometer in the 4,000–400 cm-1 region. Magnetization measurements were carried out with a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. The experimental susceptibilities were corrected for the diamagnetism of the constituent atoms (Pascal’s tables). Synthesis of [Co(bim)2(dca2)n] (1) A methanolic solution (15 mL) of benzimidazole (bim) (0.117 g, 1.0 mmol) was added slowly to an aqueous solution (15 mL) of Co(NO3)2  6H2O (0.146 g, 0.5 mmol) with stirring. To this colorless transparent solution, an aqueous solution (10 mL) of sodium dicyanamide (0.089 g, 1.0 mmol) was slowly added with constant stir- ring. The resulting solution was ﬁltered and the ﬁltrate was allowed to stand in air at room temperature. After several days, the well-shaped pink single crystals 1 were obtained. Yield: 74%.

Crystal Structure Determination The single crystal 1 with approximate dimensions 0.52 9 0.20 9 0.06 mm3 was selected for lattice parame- ter determination and collection of intensity data using a Rigaku Mercury CCD diffractometer with graphite mono- chromated MoKa radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). Intensities were collected by the x scan technique. Data intensity was corrected with multi-scan mode and empirical absorption (R. Jacobson 1998, Private communication). The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned with full-matrix least-squares technique (SHELXTL-97) [18]. The positions of hydrogen atoms were determined with theoretical cal- culation. The parameters of the crystal data collection and reﬁnement of complex 1 are given in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are shown in Table 2. Results and Discussion Figure 1 shows the local coordination of the cobalt(II) atom in 1. Each cobalt(II) atom is situated at the center of the symmetry. The coordination geometry of the Co(II) atom is slightly distorted octahedral, coordinated equa- torially by four nitrogen atoms from four symmetry-related dca ligands [Co(1)–N(4) 2.1152(17) A˚ , Co(1)–N(5B) 2.1427(18) A˚ ], and axially by two nitrogen atoms from two benzimidazole molecules[Co(1)–N(1) 2.1492(16) A˚ ]. These Co–Ndca bond lengths are similar to the corre- sponding values in Co–dca complexes [11–17]. The nitrile C–N bond lengths of dca are 1.154(2) A˚ for N(4)–C(8) and 1.154(2) A˚ for N(5)–C(9). The bond angle related to amide nitrogen C(8)–N(3)–C(9) is 118.55(15)o, corresponding to the amide nitrogen atom N(3) with sp2 hybrid orbital. Those bond angle related to nitrile N(3)– C(8)–N(4) and N(3)–C(9)–N(5) are 173.97(18) and 174.65(17)o, respectively, corresponding to N(4), C(8), C(9) and N(5) with sp hybrid orbital. The dicyanamide (dca) adopts end-to-end coordination mode. Each dca links two cobalt(II) atoms into a two- Table 1 Crystallographic data for 1 CCDC deposit number 295951 Empirical formula C18H12CoN10 Formula weight 427.31 Temperature (K) 193(2) Wavelength (A˚ ) 0.71073 Crystal system Monoclinic Space group P21/n a (A˚ ) 9.168(5) b (A˚ ) 9.959(5) c (A˚ ) 9.850(5) b (o) 105.360(11) V (A˚ 3) 867.2(8) Z 2 F(000) 434 q (g cm-3) 1.636 l (mm-1) 1.019 Crystal size (mm) 0.52 9 0.20 9 0.06 h range for data collection () 3.08 to 27.46 Index ranges -11 B h B 11, -12 B k B 12, -12 B l B 12 Reﬁnement method Full-matrix least-squares on F2 Independent reﬂections 1978 [R(int) = 0.0265] Parameter 134 Max. and min. transmission 0.941 and 0.619 Goodness of ﬁt S 1.093 Final R1 and wR2 [I [ 2r(I)] 0.0308, 0.0728 R1 and wR2 indices (all data) 0.0351, 0.0750 Largest diff.

The distance between two Co atoms connected by dca bridge is 7.623 A˚ , which is similar to the corresponding distances 8.336 A˚ in [Co(dca)2(H2O)2] (2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine-dioxide)2.[17]. The two-dimensional sheets are parallel stacked. The benzimidazole rings are absolutely parallel the benzimid- azole rings (-x ? 2, -y ? 1, -z ? 1) from the adjacent sheets with the perpendicular distance 3.468 A˚ and the center-to-center distance 3.841 A˚ of benzimidazole rings, exhibiting obvious p–p stacking interactions [17, 19, 20]. The three-dimensional network is forms via the p–p stacking interactions of the benzimidazole rings of the adjacent two- dimensional sheets (Fig. 3). The shortest distance between two Co atom from two different two-dimensional sheets is 9.057 A˚ . The inter-plane distance between the Co atoms plane of one two-dimensional sheet and the Co atoms plane of adjacent two-dimensional sheet is 7.544 A˚ (Fig. 3). The C:N stretching vibrations of [N(CN)2]- of 1 are 2280, 2230 and 2164 cm-1, and are assigned to the C:N symmetric stretch band (msym), the asymmetric stretch band (masym) and the combination band of msym and masym of dca. The large shift towards high frequencies, compared with these of free dca in NaN(CN)2 (2232 and 2179 cm-1), conﬁrmed that dca bridged the metal centers [8–17]. The molar magnetic susceptibility vM is measured in the temperature from 1.8 to 300 K in the ﬁeld of 2 KOe, and the result is shown in Fig. 4 in the forms of vM versus T and vMT versus T plot. The vMT value is 3.01 cm3 K mol-1 at 300 K, which is signiﬁcantly larger than the spin-only value of the high-spin cobalt(II) 1.875 cm3 K mol-1 indi- cating a contribution of the orbital momentum typical for the 4T1g ground state and decreases upon cooling to 1.21 cm3 K mol-1 at 1.8 K. The magnetic susceptibility above 26 K obeys the Curie–Weiss law with the Weiss constant, h = 17.14 K, and the Curie constant, C = 3.17 cm3 K mol-1. From the ﬁtted Curie constant, C, one can deduce the g value to be about 2.60. From the structure information, we know that the Co(II) ions are well separated, so we can treat the magnetic data by considering a mononuclear Co2? with a spin-orbit coupling parameter k (H = -kLS) in a molecular-ﬁeld approximation. The vmono for mononuclear Co2? in an octahedral environment can be calculated from Eq. 1, with x = k/kBT [17, 21]. The parameter A gives a measure of the crystal ﬁeld strength relative to the inter-electronic Fig. 2 Two-dimensional network of 1 Fig. 3 The stacking of two adjacent sheets in 1 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 T / K χM / cm 3 mol -1 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 χMT / cm 3 K mol -1 Fig. 4 Temperature dependence of vM (O) and vMT (h) for 1.

Considering the molecular-ﬁeld approach with zJ as the total exchange coupling between Co2? ions, we can ﬁt our experimental data with Eq. 2 [22]. v ¼ vmono 1  2zJ=Ng2b2   vmono ð2Þ In Eqs. 1 and 2, N, g, b, kB and T have their usual mean- ings. The best ﬁtting of the susceptibility data in the temperature range of 28–300 K gives k = -121 cm-1, A = 1.17, and zJ = 0.648 cm-1 with R = 2.1 9 10-4 [R = [P(vobs - vcalcd)2/P(vobs)2]]. The positive zJ value indicates the overall weak ferromagnetic coupling between the Co(II) ions [17].
