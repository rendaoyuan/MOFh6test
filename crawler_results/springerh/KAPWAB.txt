Manuscript ORIGINAL PAPER One- and Two-dimensional Coordination Polymers of Cadmium Complexes Bridged by 4,40-Trimethylenebipyridine Ligands Chao Xu • Sheng-Bo Liu • Taike Duan • Qun Chen • Qian-Feng Zhang Received: 29 January 2011 / Published online: 16 February 2011  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract Three new cadmium coordination polymers, [CdBr2(tmdp)2(l-tmdp)2]n n(H2O) (1), [Cd(SCN)2(l-tmdp)2]n2n(PhS) (2) and [Cd(SCN)2(l-tmdp)2]nn(Ph2S2) n(CH3CN) (3) (tmdp = 4,40-trimethylenedipyridine), have been synthesized under solvo- thermal conditions and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction anal- ysis. The geometry around cadmium is a slightly distorted octahedron with four tmdp and two Br- or SCN- ligands. Complex 1 represents a one-dimensional structure, whereas complexes 2 and 3 are two-dimensional coordination polymers. The rhombic channels of the coordination network of 2 and 3 are occupied by 1D polymeric (PhS)n and diphenyl disulﬁde (Ph2S2) molecules, respectively. The photoluminescent properties of coordination polymers 1–3 were investigated in solid state at room temperature. The TGA experiments showed that these three complexes were quite thermally stable.

In special, ﬂexible long dipyridyl ligands can assume different conformations, for example, 4,40-trimethylenedipyridine (tmdp) can assume four conformations (TT, TG, GG, GG0, where T = trans, G = gauche) [12], they are often employed to form many different supramolecular arrays [13– 17], including interpenetrated [18–24] and helical [25] structures. These polymers usually contain large channels or cavities which can be occupied by guest molecules. For example, the channels of three-dimensional [Zn3(4,40-bipy)3 (H2O)6(SO4)4]2- [26] and [Cd(L)2(NO3)2] (L = pyCH2C10F6CH2py) [27] coordi- nation networks are occupied by large cationic [4,40-H2bipy]2? and naphthalene molecules, respectively. Extending our previous work on self-assembly of coordination networks based on metal salts and long bridging dipyridyl ligands [28, 29], we are now studying the reaction of ﬂexible pyridyl-donor ligands tmdp with d10 metal ions such as Zn(II) and Cd(II). Herein,we report the syntheses and structures of a one-dimensional interpenetrated single helical polymer [CdBr2(tmdp)2(l-tmdp)2]nn(H2O) (1) and two two- dimensional (4,4) topological network [Cd(SCN)2(l-tmdp)2]n2n(PhS) (2) and [Cd(SCN)2(l-tmdp)2]nn(Ph2S2)n(CH3CN) (3) with a one-dimensional (PhS)n polymer and large guest molecule Ph2S2 encapsulated in the rhombic channels, respectively. Experimental Materials and Measurements [Cd(SPh)2] was prepared according to the literature method [30]. CdBr2, thiourea, and tmdp were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as supplied. All other reagents and solvents were used without further puriﬁcation. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 170sx FT-IR spectrophotometer with use of pressed KBr pellets. Luminescence properties were measured and recorded using an FLS-920 ﬂuores- cence spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin–Elmer 240C Elemental Analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed by using a Delta TGA instrument.

Crystal Structure Determination The structures of 1, 2 and 3 were determined by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique. Diffraction data were collected on a Bruker SMART Apex CCD diffractometer with MoKa radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 296 K using x scan mode. The collected frames were processed with the software SAINT [31]. The data was corrected for absorption using the program SADABS [32]. Structures were solved by Direct Methods and reﬁned by full matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL software package [33, 34]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. The positions of all hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically (Csp3–H = 0.96, Csp2–H = 0.93 A˚ ) and included in the structure factor calcula- tions with assigned isotropic displacement parameters but were not reﬁned. The thiocyanate group in 3 was treated as disordered, which resulted in the R value in the ﬁnal reﬁnement being quite high at 7.68%. The largest peak in the ﬁnal difference map had height of 1.066 e A˚ -3 for 3 and is in the vicinity of the cadmium atom. The Flack parameter value of 0.00(1) for 2 indicates that the correct enantiomorph has been selected in the structure. Further details of the data determination, crystal data and structure reﬁnement parameters are summarized in Table 1. Crystal data (excluding structure factors) for the structures in this paper have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) as supplementary publication nos.

Results and Discussion Hydrothermal reaction of CdBr2 with tmdp in a 1:3 molar ratio at 110 C produced a new complex [CdBr2(tmdp)2(l-tmdp)2]nn(H2O) (1). Complex 1 is stable in air and insoluble in water and most common organic solvent except DMSO and DMF. In order to obtain higher dimensional framework, we attempted the reaction of Table 1 Crystallographic data and experimental details for [CdBr2(tmdp)2(l-tmdp)2]nn(H2O) (1), [Cd(SCN)2(l-tmdp)2]n2n(PhS) (2) and [Cd(SCN)2(l-tmdp)2]nn(Ph2S2)n(CH3CN) (3) Compound 1 2 3 Empirical formula C78H88N12O2Br4Cd2 C42H41N7S2Cd C80H72N12S8Cd2 Formula weight 1770.04 884.46 1682.78 Crystal system Orthorhombic Monoclinic Monoclinic a (A˚ ) 16.4953(15) 10.3042(2) 23.9721(4) b (A˚ ) 18.0452(16) 10.0251(2) 10.3929(2) c (A˚ ) 26.868(3) 21.0685(4) 18.0899(3) a () 90 90 90 b () 90 98.101(1) 110.214(1) c () 90 90 90 V (A˚ 3) 7997.5(13) 2154.67(7) 4229.32(13) Space group Ibca Pn C2/c Z 4 2 2 Dcalc (g cm-3) 1.470 1.363 1.321 Temperature (K) 296(2) 296(2) 296(2) F(000) 3760 908 1720 l(Mo-Ka) (mm-1) 2.581 0.738 0.748 Total reﬂn 31015 20267 20080 Independent reﬂn 4622 8840 4795 2h ranges () 0.99–27.64 1.00–27.43 0.99–27.47 Rint 0.0828 0.0173 0.0385 R1 a, wR2 b (I [ 2r(I)) 0.0512, 0.1229 0.0380, 0.0964 0.0768, 0.1153 R1, wR2 (all data) 0.0744, 0.1784 0.0434, 0.1005 0.1012, 0.2293 Parameter 233 488 244 GoFc 0.992 1.034 1.083 Flack parameter – 0.00(1) – Final max/min diff. peaks (e A˚ -3) ?0.828/-0.537 ?0.641/-0.442 ?1.066/-0.927 a R1 = RjjFoj - jFcjj/RjFoj b wR2 = [Rw(jFo 2j - jFc 2j)2/RwjFo 2j2]1/2 c GoF = [Rw(jFoj - jFcj)2/(Nobs - Nparam)]1/2 110 C. Xu et al. 123 CdBr2 and tmdp in ratios of 1:1 and 1:2. However, the X-ray diffraction analysis shows the structures of products in different ratios are the same as complex 1. Reaction of [Cd(SPh)2], KSCN and tmdp in a 1:2:2 molar ratio afforded [Cd(SCN)2- (l-tmdp)2]n(PhS)2n (2) at 110 C under solvothermal condition, [Cd(SCN)2 (l- tmdp)2]n(Ph2S2)nn(CH3CN) (3) was obtained when the reaction temperature was raised to 150 C in the similar reactants. The PhS- moieties in the starting were substituted by pyridyl ligands and further oxidized to be polymeric (PhS)n in 2 and diphenyl disulﬁde Ph2S2 in 3. The formation of such diphenyl disulﬁde dimeric units is due to the oxidation of the free PhS- fragment under the hydrothermal condition [13–17]. It is noteworthy that the polymeric (PhS)n is unstable and easily split up at a relatively higher temperature. The IR absorption bands with variable intensity in the range of 1430–1610 cm-1 for 1–3 correspond to C=C and C=N stretching vibration of pyridyl rings of tmdp ligands. The presence of high intensity absorption bands in 2056 and 2053 cm-1 indicates the presences of thiocyanate in complexes 2 and 3, respectively. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that complex 1 consists of one- dimensional zigzig complex chains and the lattice water molecules. Fig. 1 shows the coordination environment of the central cadmium atom in complex 1. The coordination geometry of the cadmium center is a distorted octahedron with four nitrogen atoms of different tmdp ligands and two bromine atoms. The slight distortion of each cadmium is reﬂected on the cis Cd–N–Cd bond angels ranging from 89.21(18) to 91.5(3), while trans N–Cd–N and Br–Cd–Br bond angles are 177.45(18) and 177.57(4), respectively. The average of Cd–N bond lengths is 2.390(5) A˚ , which is comparable to that in [Cd(NO3)2(tmdp)2(H2O)2]n (av. 2.355(2) A˚ ) [2c]. The Cd–Br band length is 2.7407(7) A˚ , which appears similar to that in [Cd(pyim)2Br2]n (pyim = N-(4-pyridylmethyl)imidazole) (av. 2.768(3) A˚ ) and [Cd(l-Br)2(bpy)2] (av. 2.772(2) A˚ ) [35, 36]. The lattice water molecules are weakly hydrogen-bonded to the nitrogen and bromine atoms with the accordingly hydrogen bonding distances [ON = 2.928(2) A˚ , O–HN = 146.43(2); OBr = 3.522(3) A˚ , O–HBr = 139.6(3)]. Four tmdp ligands are linked to the cadmium center, two tmdp behave as mono- functional pendant ligands, whereas the other two act as bridging connectors to form a 1D single helical-like chain, as shown in Fig. 2. Similar structure was also found in [Mn(tmdp)3Cl2] [2e], [Cu(tmdp)3Cl2]2H2O [5c] and [Mn(N3)2(tmdp)3]H2O [5 g]. All of the ﬂexible tmdp ligands present the TT conformation with the average NN separation of 9.924 A˚ . Two pyridine rings of tmdp are inclined to one another at an average angle of 70.9. Complex 1 consists of three interpenetrating 1D polymers with their dangling ligands along different symmetric planes, as shown in Fig. 3. The structures of complexes 2 and 3 were conﬁrmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The two coordination polymers have similar frameworks which exhibit two-dimensional grid networks. The building blocks of 2 and 3 in their 2D network are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Each cadmium center is linked by four nitrogen atoms of the bridging tmdp ligands and other two nitrogen atoms of thiocyanate anions. Four nitrogen atoms of the tmdp ligands locate in a plane and two thiocyanate groups occupy axial positions.

Disordered sulfur atoms of thiocyanate anions are observed in 2. S1 and S1a are located at two different sites and the occupational distribution is almost equivalent. The tmdp ligands show the TT conformation with the average NN separation of 9.646 A˚ . The average dihedral angles of two pyridine rings are 63.3 in 2 and 75.1 in 3. As shown in Figs. 6 and 8, Cd4L4 rhombic grids formed that are joined together by bridging tmdp ligands into 2D networks with (4,4) topology. It is noteworthy that the reported framework constructed with long dipyridyl ligands often contain small guest molecules such as solvent molecules encapsulating in the channels, example of even large guest molecules occupying the channels of coordination polymers is rather rare. The rhombic channels of the coordination network of 2 and 3 are occupied by 1D polymeric (PhS)n and diphenyl disulﬁde (Ph2S2) molecules, Fig. 6 Top view of the 2D supramolecular arrays of [Cd(SCN)2(l-tmdp)]n with interpenetrated (PhS)n polymers in 2 Fig. 7 Side view of 2D supramolecular arrays of [Cd(SCN)2(l-tmdp)2]n in 2, showing a topological framework and the (PhS)n polymers encapsulated in the channels One- and Two-dimensional Coordination Polymers of Cadmium 115 123 respectively. Figs. 6 and 7 show the top and side view of the 2D supramolecular arrays of [Cd(SCN)2(l-tmdp)]n and 1D zigzag (PhS)n polymers in 2, obviously, the polymeric (PhS)n thread the 2D network through the channels. The channels of the coordination network of 3 are occupied by large diphenyl disulﬁde (Ph2S2) molecules with the two terminal carbon atoms CC distance of 7.522 A˚ , as shown in Fig. 9. The dimensions of the channels are 7.89 9 13.33 and 7.90 9 13.49 A˚ 2 in 2 and 3, respectively. As we know, the metal–organic complex frameworks containing d10 metals usually exhibit photoluminescent properties [39, 40]. Based upon the previous work, we also investigated the photoluminescent properties of these three complexes in solid state at room temperature (see Fig. 10). Complex 1 shows intense photolu- minescent emission at 410 nm with shoulder peaks at about 393 and 434 nm upon excitation at 350 nm. Complexes 2 and 3 display two broad band ﬂuorescent emissions at 407 and 433 nm, respectively, upon photo-excitation at 370 nm. All the three complexes have similar excitation and emission wavelengths. According to the literature, the tmdp ligand exhibit emission band at 521 nm (kex = 400 nm) Fig. 8 Top view of the 2D supramolecular arrays of [Cd(SCN)2(l-tmdp)]n in 2. Lattice solvent and free Ph2S2 molecules excluded for clarity Fig. 9 Side view of 2D supramolecular arrays of [Cd(SCN)2(l-tmdp)]n in 3, showing a topological framework and the free Ph2S2 molecules encapsulated in the channels 116 C. Xu et al. 123 [41]. Therefore, the emissions of 1–3 may be assigned to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). The luminescent properties of complexes 1–3 may be attributed to the bridging tmdp ligands in the octahedral metal centers. In order to investigate the thermal stability of the three complexes, TGA and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were carried out for the three complexes between 20 and 800 C in a static air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 C/min. For 1, the ﬁrst loss of 2.3% (calcd.: 2.0%) from 110 to 140 C corresponds to the loss of one guest water molecules. The second loss of 67.1% (calcd.: 67.5%) from 213 to 390 C corresponds to the loss of three equiv. of tmdp ligands. The solid residue formed at around 800 C is suggested to be CdBr2. TGA shows compound 2 and 3 are stable up to 215 C and the decomposition of the compound involves two steps, the ﬁrst one occurs from 215 to 400 C corresponds to the loss of two equiv. of tmdp ligands, the second segment of the complex decomposition pathway from 500 to 760 C corresponds to the loss of the thiocyanate ions. The solid residue formed at 800 C is suggested to be metallic cadmium. In conclusion, we have successfully isolated three polymeric complexes by using ﬂexible ligand of tmdp and different type of cadmium salts under solvothermal condition. Complex 1 possesses a 1D zigzag chain structure, 2 and 3 have a 2D (4,4) topologic network with 1D polymer (PhS)n and large guest molecule of Ph2S2 in the channels respectively. Three complexes have similar excitation and emission wavelengths and are of obvious photoluminescent properties and good thermal stability in the solid state due to the bridging tmdp ligands around the octahedral metal centers.
