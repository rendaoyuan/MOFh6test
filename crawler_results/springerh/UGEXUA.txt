Manuscript Cobalt(II) complexes of a pyridyl/benzimidazol-1-yl-based ligand: syntheses, crystal structures, and photoluminescent properties Chun-Sen Liu Æ Song-Tao Ma Æ Liang-Qi Guo Æ Min Hu Received: 24 February 2009 / Accepted: 29 April 2009 / Published online: 26 May 2009  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009 Abstract Two new cobalt(II) coordination polymers with a pyridyl/benzimidazol-1-yl-based ligand, namely 1-(4- pyridylmethyl)-1H-benzimidazole (L), were synthesized and characterized structurally by single crystal X-ray dif- fraction as [Co(L)2(SCN)2]? (1) and [Co(L)2(N3)2]? (2). Complex 1 has a three-dimensional twofold interpenetrat- ing diamondoid network, while 2 possesses a one-dimen- sional chain structure, which is further interlinked into a higher-dimensional supramolecular framework by hydrogen-bonding interactions. The structural differences between complexes 1 and 2 are attributable to the different auxiliary ligands, SCN- for 1 and N3 - for 2. The lumi- nescent properties of the complexes and the free ligand have been investigated. Introduction Metal–organic structural chemistry has emerged as an attractive research area in recent years and considerable research has been conducted in this discipline, resulting in a great number of one-, two-, and three-dimensional net- works [1–3]. One driving force behind the syntheses of new network structures has been the concept that the simple association of a pair of starting compounds through metal coordination and/or noncovalent interactions can be used to assemble new coordination polymers exhibiting special topologies and interesting properties, such as electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic properties [4–9]. The most common strategy is to employ rationally designed ligands and suitable metal ions to construct novel architectures. In this way, the topology of the structure of the resulting product can be reasonably controlled and directed. Pyridyl/benzimidazol-1-yl-based ligands are rep- resentative examples in coordination and metallosupra- molecular chemistry [10–15]. They are a subject of interest to medicinal chemistry because of the broad spectrum of their biological and pharmaceutical properties, such as antibacterial, antiparasitic, and antitumor activities [16]. On the other hand, they can also construct different coordination architectures as different spacers, bridges, or terminal auxiliary ligands [17–19], which have been discussed in recent years [20–23]. Multidentate anionic ligands, such as SCN- and N3 -, have been utilized in the design and synthesis of many novel complexes [24]. These three-atom bridges are par- ticularly well suited for the construction of functional coordination complexes. As one of the most versatile ligands, azido ion (N3 -) has been used for the construction of enormous magnetic systems, because it has different types of bridging modes [24, 25]. In contrast, the thiocyano ion (SCN-) has two different donor atoms (S and N) and less versatility and is therefore less efﬁcient as a magnetic coupler. Compared with N3 -, there are much fewer reports on the divalent ﬁrst-row transition metal complexes bridged by SCN- [24, 25]. Considering these observations, we selected a pyridyl/ benzimidazol-1-yl-based ligand, namely 1-(4-pyridylmethyl)- 1H-benzimidazole (L) to construct new functional com- plexes. We report here the syntheses and structures of two Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11243-009-9223-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

The luminescent properties of L and its complexes are also discussed. Experimental General materials and methods 1-(4-pyridylmethyl)-1H-benzimidazole (L) was synthe- sized according to the reported method [21, 26]. All the reagents and solvents for synthesis were commercially available and employed as received without further puri- ﬁcation. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin- Elmer 240C analyzer and IR spectra on a Tensor 27 OPUS (Bruker) FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets. Thermal stability (TG-DTA) studies were carried out on a Dupont thermal analyzer from room temperature to 800 C under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 C min-1. Emission spectra in the solid state at room temperature were taken on a Cary Eclipse ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer. Preparations of complexes 1 and 2 [Co(L)2(SCN)2]? (1). A solution of L (11 mg, 0.05 mmol) in MeOH (5 mL) was carefully layered on top of a mixed solution of MeOH/H2O (v/v 1:1, 10 mL), and a H2O solution (10 mL) of Co(NO3)26H2O (15 mg, 0.05 mmol) and NH4SCN (4 mg, 0.05 mmol) in a test tube. Yellow single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis appeared at the tube wall after ca. 1 month at room temperature. Yield: *40% based on L. Anal.

X-ray powder diffraction studies of 1 and 2 The X-ray powder diffraction patterns (XRPD) of com- plexes 1 and 2 were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer, operated at 40 kV and 100 mA, using a Cu- target tube and a graphite monochromator. The intensity data were recorded by continuous scan in a 2h/h mode from 3 to 80 with a step size of 0.02 and a scan speed of 8 min-1. Simulation of the XRPD spectra was carried out by the single-crystal data and diffraction-crystal module of the Mercury (Hg) program available free of charge via the Internet at http://www.iucr.org. X-ray crystallographic studies of 1 and 2 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements for com- plexes 1 and 2 were carried out on a Bruker Smart 1000 CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite crystal monochro- mator situated in the incident beam for data collection at 293(2) K. The determinations of unit cell parameters and data collections were performed with Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) and unit cell dimensions were obtained with least-squares reﬁnements. The program SAINT [27] was used for integration of the diffraction proﬁles. Semi- empirical absorption corrections were applied using SAD- ABS program [28]. All the structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS program of the SHELXTL package and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares methods with SHELXL [29]. Co(II) atoms in each complex were located from the E-maps and the other non-hydrogen atoms were located in successive difference Fourier syntheses and reﬁned with anisotropic thermal parameters on F2. The hydrogen atoms were added theoretically, riding on the concerned atoms and reﬁned with ﬁxed thermal factors. Crystallographic data and experimental details for structural analyses are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond distances and angles of complexes 1 and 2 are listed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. CCDC Nos. 721335 and 721336 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for complexes 1 and 2, respectively.

Results and discussion Descriptions of crystal structure for 1 and 2 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the structure of [Co(L)2(SCN)2]? (1) consists of a 3-D two- fold interpenetrating diamondoid network (Fig. 1), which crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4(1)/a. As shown in Fig. 1a, each asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Co(II) ion, two L ligands and two SCN- ligands. Each Co(II) atom is six-coordinated by four N atoms [Co–N: 508 Transition Met Chem (2009) 34:507–512 123 2.154(2)–2.198(2) A˚ ] from four different L ligands, which are typical values for Co(II)–Npy [3, 30] and Co(II)–Nim coordination distances [31], and two N atoms [Co–N: 2.104(2) A˚ ] from two different SCN- ligands to complete a distorted octahedral coordination environment (Table 2). Each SCN- uses only a terminal N donor to coordinate to the Co(II) atoms. The Co(II) ion is thus connected to four adjacent Co(II) centers through the L bridges to result in a 3-D polymeric network with a diamondoid structure. The ﬁrst view of the structure displays a large cavity in every diamondoid cage with the adjacent CoCo separations of 10.351(1) A˚ . A more careful examination shows that such cavities are reduced by the other identical interpenetrated diamondoid net. If the L groups are in a di-coordinated linear fashion to be omitted, the CoCoCo angles in 1 range from 94.35 to 117.52  and so deviate signiﬁcantly from 109.45 , expected for an idealized diamondoid network [32]. As evidenced in Fig. 1b, a very large cavity exists within a single diamondoid network. However, in order to minimize the big void cavities in the diamondoid cages and to stabilize the whole framework, a twofold interpenetrating diamondoid framework is generated. In contrast to 1, [Co(L)2(N3)2]? (2) exhibits a 1-D chain structure by employing N3 - instead of SCN- (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2a, each Co(II) center is six-coordinated by four N atoms from four different L ligands and two N atoms from two N3 - ligands. Hence, L acts as a bridging ligand coordinating to the Co(II) atoms with the Co–N bond distances ranging from 2.1768(17) to 2.237(2) A˚ , which are typical values for Co(II)–Npy and Co(II)–Nim coordination distances [3, 30–32].

The Co(II) atoms are connected to each adjacent Co(II) center through a head-to-tail bridge fashion, forming a 1-D chain running along the ½110 direction (Fig. 2b). The 1-D chains are further assembled to form a 2-D layer by intermolecular C–HN hydrogen-bonding interactions [33, 34]. The C(5)N(6D) and C(7)N(6E) separations are 3.266(3) and 3.324(7) A˚ with C(5)–H(5)N(6D) and C(7)–H(7)N(6E) angles being 133 and 153  [symmetry codes: D, x, y-1, z; E, -x, -y ? 2, -z ? 1] (Fig. 2c). Generally, when thiocyanate and azide act as bridging ligands, there are many typical coordination modes [24, 25, 35, 36]. However, in complexes 1 and 2 reported here, SCN- and N3 - both adopt a single N-terminal unidentate coordination mode. Both coordinate two trans-positions around each Co(II) atom, thus leaving four equatorial positions for the pyridyl/benzimidazole groups of L ligands. Complex 1 can then be deeply interdigitated to give the 3-D architecture [35]. The radius of the S atom is larger than that of N atom and the length of the S–N bond in SCN- is also larger than that of the N–N bond in N3 -, and the distorted angle of Co–N–S around each Co(II) center is larger than that of Co–N–N. Thus, SCN- has a larger steric effect than that of N3 -, which causes L in 1 to be more ﬂexible than in 2, increasing the dimensionality of the structure in 1. These results indicate that the different auxiliary SCN- and N3 - ionic ligands play an important role in the supramolecular structures of complexes 1 and 2. IR spectrum of 1 and 2 In general, the IR spectrum of complexes 1 and 2 show features attributable to each component [37]. Both of the complexes have similar IR spectra, which show charac- teristic absorption bands resulting from the skeletal vibra- tions of the aromatic rings in the 1600–1400 cm-1 region. Additionally, abundant absorption peaks in the region 620– 770 strongly argue for the presence of pyridyl rings. The IR spectrum of complex 1 exhibits a very strong absorption at 2070 cm-1, indicating the presence of thiocyanate-N coordination. In 2, the IR spectrum shows a very strong absorption at 2051 cm-1 due to azide. Thermogravimetric analysis of 1 and 2 Complexes 1 and 2 are stable at ambient conditions, and thermogravimetric experiments were performed to explore their thermal stabilities. As shown in ESI-Fig. S1, the TGA curves of 1 and 2 are different, probably due to their different architectures. For 1, there are two separate two-step weight loss steps. The ﬁrst weight loss of 55.8% occurs from 280 to 400 C, which is attributed to the loss of one coordinated L and two SCN- ligands (calcd. 54.8%). The second weight loss of 28.8% from 480 to 550 C corresponds to the loss of all the remaining ligands (calcd. 29.9%). The remaining weight of 15.4% corresponds to the percentage (calcd. 12.6%) of the Co and O components, indicating that the ﬁnal product is CoO [38] (see ESI-Fig. S1a). While For 2, there Fig. 1 View of a the coordination environment of the Co(II) ion in 1 and b schematic representations of a single diamondoid framework (left and right) and the twofold interpenetrated diamondoid network (middle) in 1 (symmetry code: A –x ? 1, -y ? 1/2, z) 510 Transition Met Chem (2009) 34:507–512 123 are only one-step weight loss steps. The TGA measurements indicate that the 1D networks remain stable upon heating until 200 C(see ESI-Fig. S1b). XRPD results of 1 and 2 To conﬁrm whether the crystal structures are truly repre- sentative of the bulk materials, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) experiments have also been carried out for 1 and 2. The XRPD experimental and computer-simulated patterns of the corresponding complexes are shown in ESI-Fig. S2. Although the experimental patterns have a few unindexed diffraction lines and some are slightly broadened in comparison with those simulated from the single crystal models, it can be reasonably concluded that the bulk synthesized materials and the as-grown crystals are isomorphous for 1 and 2. Luminescent properties Aromatic organic molecules and mixed inorganic-organic hybrid coordination polymers are promising luminescent materials for their potential applications, such as light- emitting materials (LEDs), chemical sensors, photochem- istry, and electroluminescent (EL) displays [23, 39–41]. The luminescences of 1 and 2 as well as the free ligand L were investigated at room temperature (see Fig. 3). Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit intense luminescent emissions at kmax = 420 and 430 nm upon excitations at kex = 380 and 382 nm in the blue ﬂuorescent regions, respectively, while the free ligand L displays moderate luminescence in the solid state at kmax = 382 nm upon excitation at kex = 279 nm under the same experimental conditions. Compared with that of the free ligand L, the emission proﬁles of 1 and 2 are red-shif- ted, which may be due to the increase of conjugation upon metal coordination and originate from the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) [42]. Meanwhile, the emission proﬁle of 2 is a little red-shifted compared with that of 1, which may be attributed to the weak intermolecular inter- actions between L ligands, for example, hydrogen-bonding interactions [43]. Conclusion We have prepared two cobalt(II) complexes of 1-(4-pyri- dylmethyl)-1H-benzimidazole having a 3-D twofold Fig. 2 View of a the coordination environment of the Co(II) ion in 2, b the 1-D chain running along the ½110 direction, and c the 2-D layer formed by the intermolecular C–HN H-bonding interactions (red dashed lines) (a part of H atoms have been omitted for clarity; symmetry codes: A -x-1, -y ? 2, -z ? 1; B x-1, y ? 1, z; C -x, -y ? 1, -z ? 1; D x, y-1, z; E -x, -y ? 2, -z ? 1) 375 390 405 420 435 450 465 480 Em = 430 Em = 420 Em = 382 Intensity (a.u.)
