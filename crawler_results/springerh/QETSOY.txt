ECPC obtained was characterized by differen- tial thermal analysis/thermogravimetry (DTA/TG), single- crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis and FT-IR analysis techniques. The result of single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the ECPC crystallizes in monoclinic symmetry, and the space group P2(1)/n, a = 10.6933(15) Å, b = 7.1243(10) Å, c = 17.092(2) Å, α = γ = 90◦, β = 97.109(2)◦, V = 1292.1(3) Å3, Z = 4, R1 = 0.0286, wR2 = 0.0686. ECPC demonstrates a 3- D supramolecular framework containing nine-coordinate erbium centers and channels. The uncoordinated wa- ter molecules occupy the channels in ECPC. The re- sults of TG/DTA, IR and elemental analysis performed also give positive information of the proposed crystal structure. Keywords Solvothermal synthesis . Erbium . Carboxylate .

China Introduction Crystal engineering of organic supramolecular assemblies employing two or more components is a two-step process, i.e. the formation of a supramolecular between the constituents followed by self-assembly or packing of the supramolecular in the 3-D space [1–2]. In this direction, solid-state structures with well-deﬁned molecular networks of different types such as 3-D architectures possessing cavities and channels have been synthesized. However, evolution of an assembly, in all these cases, normally depends on the properties of the func- tional group under consideration. Therefore, the assembly of molecular materials from organic ligands and metal ion building blocks to generate new supramolecular architec- tures is still a challenge [3–4]. Having eight potential donor oxygen atoms [5], 1,2,4,5- benzenetetracarboxylic acid (H4btec) is a rather versatile ligand for the synthesis of polymeric complexes with metal cations [6–8]. It can also be considered as fragments with an enormous structural variety and a multitude of interest- ing properties [9]. Furthermore, its symmetry, supramolec- ular assemblies and molecular nature are highly attractive features [10]. On the other hand, apart from their intrinsic aesthetic appeal, interest in these new families of interlinked structures has been heightened by the fact that their resulting overall architectures are more ﬂexible than the usual net- works based entirely on coordination bonds [11]. Therefore, the exploitation of such species not only increases the struc- tural diversity of coordination polymers, but also provides new insights into the relationships between the structure and function of these materials. And the synthesis of this metal- organic hybrid compounds by metal ion directed assembly of organic molecular building blocks using the concept of supramolecular engineering represents one of the most active research areas in chemistry and materials science [12–13].

In this work, H4btec and Er were selected as ligand and metal ions respectively, mainly on the basis of the consideration that H4btec has four carboxylate groups, which may act as linkers to connect lanthanide metal ions in higher dimen- sional structures via varied coordination style. We hope to construct novel lanthanide coordination polymers with fas- cination structures. Herein, the solvothermal synthesis and structural characterization of a novel ECPC constructed from H4btec ligand are reported and its thermal stability and FT- IR modes are also discussed. To the best of our knowledge, it has not been reported so far in the literature. Experimental Crystal growth Reagents with A.R. purity were purchased commercially and used without further puriﬁcation. ECPC was prepared solvothermally from a mixture of ErCl3·6H2O, 1,2,4,5- benzentetracarboxylic dianhydride, acetic acid (36%) and H2O in a molar ratio of 1:1:160:900, heated in a Teﬂon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 180 ◦C for 7 days under static conditions and the ﬁlling volume is 75%. After cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, the pink prism-like crystals were separated and washed by distilled water and ethanol many times. Finally, the products were dried in air at room temperature. The average size of the crystals is about 7.0 mm × 1.0 mm × 1.2 mm, and no other phase was found in the ﬁnal product.

Crystal structure determination and reﬁnement A suitable single crystal with the dimensions of 0.48 mm × 0.46 mm × 0.40 mm was carefully selected un- der an optical microscope and glued to a thin glass ﬁber with epoxy resin. X-ray intensity data were measured at 298(2) K on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD-based diffractometer (Mo Kα radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å). The raw frame data for the compound were integrated into SHELX-format reﬂection ﬁles and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects using SAINT [14]. Corrections for incident and diffracted beam absorption effects were applied using SADABS [14]. ECPC crystallized in the space group P2(1)/n, as determined by the systematic absences in the intensity data, intensity statistics, and the successful solution and reﬁnement of the structure. The structure was solved by a combination of direct meth- ods and difference Fourier syntheses and reﬁned against F2 by the full-matrix least-squares technique. Crystal data, data collection parameters, and reﬁnement statistics for the ECPC are listed in Table 1. Selected bond distances and bond an- gles are given in Table 2. The atomic coordinates and thermal parameters of the ECPC are also listed in Table 3. Composition analysis The elemental analysis (C and H) was carried out on a Perkin- Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS/O elemental analyzer. The re- sults showed that ECPC contains 25.40 and 1.91 wt% of C and H, respectively (calculated corresponding value was 25.42 and 1.92 wt%, respectively). Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis of Er per- formed on a Perkin-Elmer Optima 3300 DV spectrometer indicates that ECPC contains 35.39 wt% of Er (calculated value was 35.40 wt%). Obviously, the composition analy- sis is in good agreement with calculated values based on the empirical formula of C10H9O11Er given by single-crystal structure analysis.

It is evident that there are two types of coordination modes for the carboxylate ligands. Firstly, two para-carboxyl groups are not deprotonated and remain free, the other two deprotonated ones bridge four erbium atoms as shown in Scheme 1; secondly, four deprotoned car- boxy groups all adopt a chelating-bridging mode, and the adjacent ones are interlinked by the same erbium. There- fore, the whole ligands btec4−coordinated to six erbium atoms is visualized in Scheme 2. The erbium atom is coor- dinated by nine oxygen atoms, six from btec4−ligands, two from H2btec2−ligands, and one from a coordinated water molecule as shown in Fig. 1. The carboxylic O–Er bond dis- tances range from 2.295(4) to 2.543(4) Å, and that of the H2O–Er bond is 2.323(4) Å. All of which are comparable to those reported for other nine-coordinate erbium-oxygen donor complexes in carboxylic acids [15–16]. More data on selected bond distances and angles are presented in Table 2. At the same time, a difference of C–O bond distances observed in the protonated carboxylic group (C(10)–O(7) 1.219(6) Å is shorter than C(10)–O(8) 1.292(6) Å, in agree- ment with the presence of the absorption peak at 1656 cm−1 for –COOH in IR spectrum (see Fig. 4). As a generally sim- ple rule, the non-ionized and uncoordinated COO−stretch- ing band occurs at about 1750–1700 cm−1. However, Fig. 4 shows a red shift from 1700 cm−1 of H4btec caused by Scheme 2 The local environment around the btec4−ion strong hydrogen bonding [17]. From Table 4, it can be seen that the example of the several kinds of hydrogen bonding for ECPC is presented as following: (a) hydrogen bonding between the two uncoordinated water molecules with an O(10) · · · O(11) distance of 2.848 Å; (b) hydrogen bonding of one uncoordinated water molecule and the co- ordinated water molecules with an O(10) · · · O(9) distance of 2.748 Å; (c) hydrogen bonding of uncoordinated water molecules/carboxylate oxygen atoms (O(10) · · · O(7) dis- tances range from 2.855 to 3.091 Å; (d) hydrogen bonding of coordinated water molecules/carboxylate oxygen atoms (O(9) · · · O(6) and O(9) · · · O(7) distances range from 2.686 to 2.941 Å between one uncoordinated water molecule and the protonated carboxyl group (O(7) · · · O(10) 2.855 Å). As depicted above (Fig. 1, Schemes 1 and 2), each btec4− ligand adopted chelating-bridging mode acts as a µ6-bridge linking six erbium centers and each erbium center attaches to three btec4−ligands to form a 2-D layer structure with the nearest erbium–erbium distance of 3.8817(5) Å. The 2- D layers are further linked by H2btec2−ligands adopting a bidentate-bridging mode. As a result, a 3-D supramolecular open framework structure with many irregular channels oc- cupied by the free guest H2O molecules was formed (Fig. 2). The open channels in the 3-D network of ECPC make it pos- sible to generate porous frameworks by removing the guest water and/or bound water molecules. On the other hand, the 3-D crystal packing also showed the presence of the in- termolecular hydrogen bonds by dashed lines as shown in Fig. 3. IR spectroscopy The FT-IR spectra of the sample were measured by a Perkin- Elmer FT-IR spectrometer in the 4000–200 cm−1 region with pressed CsI pellet. The main FT-IR spectra of ECPC are presented in Fig. 4. Adsorbed water absorbs at 3514 and 3468 cm−1 respectively, which attributed to the antisymmetric and symmetric OH stretching modes. Meanwhile, coordinated water exhibits the frequencies 657 and 591 cm−1, which assigned to ρr (H2O) and ρw (H2O) [18]. Stretching bands of O(1)–Er(1)–O(2), O(3)–Er(1)–O(4) and O(5)–Er(1)–O(6) have been assigned to 756, 777, 816, 840 and 885 cm−1, respectively similar to those of other rare earths [19–21]. Frequency at 1656 cm−1 is characteristic of the protonated carboxylic group (–C(10)–O(7)–(O8)–), and coordinated carboxylic groups (–C(1)–O(1)–O(2)–, –C(5)–O(3)–O(4)–, –C(1)–O(1)–O(2)– and –C(6)–O(5)–O(6)–) exhibit three frequencies 1561, 1578 and 1617 cm−1 according to the rule given by Bush and coworkers [22–24], which are consistent Springer Struct Chem (2006) 17:609–615 613 Table 4 Donor-H, donor-H distances, acceptor, intermolecular hydrogen bond distances, donor–acceptor distances, and angles of hydrogen bonds for ECPC D–H d(D–H) A d(H···A) d(D··A) <DHA O8–H8 0.820 O11 [x −1/2, −y + 1/2, z + 1/2] 1.820 2.639 176.58 O9–H9 0.850 O10 [x, y + 1, z] 2.098 2.748 132.88 O9–H10 0.850 O6 [ −x + 1/2, y −1/2, −z + 1/2] 2.199 2.686 116.22 O9–H10 0.850 O7 [x + 1/2, −y + 3/2, z −1/2] 2.305 2.941 131.75 O10–H11 0.850 O7 [ −x + 1, −y + 1, −z + 1] 2.022 2.855 166.45 O10–H12 0.850 O7 [x + 1/2, −y + 3/2, z −1/2] 2.320 3.091 151.03 O11–H13 0.850 O10 2.039 2.848 158.72 O11–H14 0.850 O1 [ −x + 3/2, y −1/2, −z + 1/2] 2.007 2.850 171.15 with the results of single-crystal X-ray analysis described above. TG/DTA analysis The thermal stability of the ECPC was examined by TGA- DTA experiments, which were carried out under a ﬂow of the dry air and at a heating rate of 10 ◦C min−1 from room tem- perature to 950 ◦C with a Perkin-Elmer Diamond TG/DTA instrument. From Fig. 5, we can see that the TG curve in- dicates that the weight loss of ECPC can be completely divided into three distinct stages. Below 130 ◦C, there is only one weight loss of 7.59% with an obvious endother- mal peak, corresponding to the successive release of the adsorbed water and water between layers, which is in good agreement with the calculated value (7.62%). A weight loss of 3.80% (where the calculated value is 3.81%) observed from 130 up to ca. 270 ◦C with a less endothermal peak, attributed to the release of coordinated water. Along with a strikingly exothermic peak in the temperature range 450– 600 ◦C, one weight loss of 50% was observed, which can be ascribed to the formation of metal oxides like Er2O3 by decomposing of ECPC. From 600–950 ◦C, no change in weight was found. The facts demonstrated clearly that the formula [{Er(H2btec)2/4(btec)3/6·([H2O)}·2H2O]n of the ECPC is reasonable, and also in agreement with the results of single-crystal X-ray analysis (vide supra). Conclusion A novel complex [{Er(H2btec)2/4(btec)3/6(H2O)}·2H2O]n has been prepared under solvothermal conditions (H2O/acetic acid) and characterized by single-crystal XRD, Fig. 2 The three-dimensional network structure with channels along the b-axis for ECPC Springer 614 Struct Chem (2006) 17:609–615 Fig. 3 The packing structure with intermolecular hydrogen bonds along the b-axis for ECPC elemental analysis, FT-IR and TG/DTA. Single-crystal XRD results showed that the central erbium ion is coordinated by nine oxygen atoms from H2btec2−and btec4−ligands with a monoclinic symmetry and the space group P2(1)/n. Six of the nine oxygen atoms coming from btec4−ligands coordinated to the erbium atom adopting a chelating-bridging mode, two from H2btec2−ligands adopting a bidentate-bridging mode, and one from a coordinated water molecule adopting monodentate-complexing mode. Three btec4−ligands coor- dinated to each erbium and generated a 2-D layer framework, which was further parallel-linked by H2btec2−ligands and resulted in the formation of a 3-D open conﬁguration with channels occupied by uncoordinated water molecules. The characteristic absorption at 1656 cm−1 in IR proved that the uncoordinated carboxyl groups exit indeed in the ECPC. 4.0k 3.5k 3.0k 2.5k 2.0k 1.5k 1.0k 500.0 20 40 60 80 1617 1578 1561 816 885 840 777 756 657 591 1656 3468 T % cm-1 3514 Fig. 4 FT-IR spectra for ECPC TG/DTA results showed that the loss of the guest water molecule and coordinated one is at about 130 and 270 ◦C, respectively.
