The crystal struc- ture of the complex has been determined by X-ray diffraction analysis to be orthorhombic, with the centrosymmetric space group Pbcm, where a = 11.6652(3) ˚A, b = 11.1709(3) ˚A, c = 14.0532(4) ˚A, V = 1831.28(9) ˚A3, Z = 4. The L2−(the acid radical of H2phth) ion is coordinated to the Cu2+ ion as a monodentate ligand. Each L2−ion bridges two adjacent Cu2+ ions with its two oxygen atoms from two carboxylic groups to form a one-dimensional zigzag chain. The coordination water and uncoordinated carboxylic oxygen atoms from neighboring chains are linked through hydrogen bonds to form a two-dimensional structure. There is a weak interaction between the coordination water molecule and the Cu2+ ion in the neighboring chain. KEY WORDS: Copper(II) complex; crystal structure; phthalic acid; 1,10-phenanthroline. Introduction The coordination chemistry of transition metal(II) complexes is of great interest due to their use as models for protein–metal binding sites in biological systems.1–4 The structures and properties of such compounds are inﬂu- enced by various factors, including the metal ion size and ligand topology, the type and number of donor atoms, and so on.5–7 Small (1) State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Materials Chemistry and Applications, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China.

In addition, it is well known that copper element is a kind of bio-microelement, and there is an abundance of heterocyclic com- pounds with nitrogen donor atoms that act as biological ligands. Therefore, it is necessary to study in detail the interaction between Cu2+ ions and heterocyclic nitrogen-containing ligands. The various copper complexes with heterocyclic nitrogen-containing ligands have been gained, and their crystal structure and some properties have been studied. The crystal structure of copper(II) complex [Cu(4apm)4(CF3SO3)2](H2O)8/3 (4apm: 4-amino-pyrimidine) has been investigated in 381 1074-1542/05/0500-0381/0 C⃝2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 382 Ye, Sun, Wang, Huang, Li, and Gao detail by spectroscopy, EPR, and X-ray crys- tal structure analysis in Gerard A.’s laboratory.12 Some copper(II) complexes with phthalic acid and heterocyclic nitrogen-containing ligands have been synthesized. Ma et al.13 have prepared binuclear complexes [Cu2(phth)(L)4](ClO4)2 [L: Phen,2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) or 4,4′-dimethyl- 2,2′-bipyridine (Me2bpy); phth: the dianion of phthalic acid] (The crystal structures of these complexes have not been reported.) An- other binuclear copper(II) complex with phtha- late and Phen, [Cu2(Phen)2(Hphth)2(NO3)(H2O)] NO3·2H2O (Hphth: hydrogen phthalate), has been synthesized by Li et al.14 The complex ob- tained by Evangelos et al. [(µ-phth)(pip)2Cu]n (pip: piperidine), is a one-dimensional, polymeric compound.15 We herein report the synthesis and crystal structure of a novel copper(II) complex with phthalic acid and a heterocyclic nitrogen- containing ligand. Experimental Synthesis of the title complex An aqueous solution of CuCl2 (0.3 mmol) was added drop-wise to a mixture of H2phth (0.3 mmol) Phen (0.3 mmol). The solution pH value was then carefully adjusted to ca. 4 with aqueous ammonia under stirring. After ﬁltering, the solution was left to stand at room temperature. Dark blue single crystals of the product complexes were obtained in ca. 40% yield after 2 weeks. Anal. Calculated for C20H16N2O6Cu: C, 54.12; H, 3.63; N, 6.31. Found: C, 53.86; H, 3.59; N, 6.03%. X-ray crystallography A blue single crystal with dimensions 0.15 mm × 0.10 mm × 0.05 mm was mounted on a NONIUS KappaCCD diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromatized Mo Kα radi- ation at 0.71073 ˚A wavelength at 293(2) K. Empirical absorption corrections were applied. The data were collected by KappaCCD (Nonius B.V., 1998)16 with θ angles range from 3.49 to 27.52◦. The cell was reﬁned by HKL Scalepack.17 A series of 32058 reﬂections was collected and 2184 of them were unique [Rint = 0.1009], giving 1615 observed reﬂections with I > 2σ(I). The structure was solved using the program SHELXS-9718 and reﬁned us- ing SHELXL-97.18 A series of 2184 reﬂec- tions and 170 parameters using three restraints were reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares on F2 (w = 1/[σ 2(F 2 o ) + (0.0574P)2 + 0.4267P ], where P = (F 2 o + 2F 2 c )/3). The largest differ- ence peak and hole had the values of 0.455 and −0.511 e/ ˚A−3, respectively. Hydrogen atoms of water molecules were located by different Fourier map and reﬁned with distance restrains for O---H and H · · · H (0.96 and 1.52 ˚A, respectively).

Results and discussion Single crystal X-ray analysis of the title complex has revealed a one-dimensional polymeric structure. As shown in Fig. 1, neighboring copper ions in the chain are bridged by two carboxylic groups from a L2−ligand, and all carboxylic groups of the L2−ligands are coordinated to Cu2+ ions in monodentate mode. Namely, each carboxylic group in the complex only provides one oxygen atom to participate in the coordination. Each Cu2+ ion in the structure is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from one Phen molecule, two carboxylic oxygen atoms from two L2−ligands and one water molecule. The oxygen atom [O(1W)] of the coordination water occupies the top of the square–pyramid. The Cu---O(1W) (H2O) bond length is 2.404(3) Fig. 1. ORTEP drawing of the complex [Cu(phth)(Phen) (H2O)]·H2O showing the thermal ellipsoids at the 30% prob- ability level. ˚A, the longest bond length relevant to Cu(I). Two of the Cu---O (carboxylic groups) bond lengths are the same (1.9327(18) ˚A). Two of the Cu---N bond lengths are also the same (2.012(2) ˚A), and are slightly longer than the Cu---O (carboxylic groups) bonds. The O(2)---Cu(1)---O(1W), O(2)#1---Cu(1)---O(1W), N(1)---Cu(1)---O(1W) and N(1)#1---Cu(1)---O(1W) bond angles are 91.27(7), 91.27(7), 90.77(8) and 90.77(8)◦, respectively; whereas the O(2)#1---Cu(1)---O(2), N(1)---Cu(1)---N(1)#1, O(2)---Cu(1)---N(1), O(2)#1---Cu(1)---N(1)#1, O(2)---Cu(1)---N(1)#1 and O(2)#1---Cu(1)---N(1) bond angles are 86.52(11), 81.88(12), 95.76(8), 95.76(8), 176.91(8) and 176.91(8)◦, respectively. Thus, the coordination sphere of Cu(1) can be best described as a distorted square pyramid, the apical Cu(1)---O(1W) bond length [2.404(3) ˚A] is considerably longer than the equatorial bond length (ca. 2.0 ˚A). The uncoordinated water molecules in the crystal lattice link with the coordination water molecules through hydrogen bonds (see Fig. 1), the O(2W)---H(4W)---O(1W) hydrogen bond angle and the O(2W)---O(1W) distance are 127(6)◦and 2.976(6) ˚A, respectively. Figure 2 shows that each coordination wa- ter molecule connects two oxygen atoms, which are from uncoordinated carboxylic groups in neighboring chains, through hydrogen bonds, to form a two-dimensional structure.

Crystal lattice water molecules are omitted for clarity. −x + 1, y −1/2, z) hydrogen bond angle is 169(3)◦ with an O(1W)---O(1) distance of 2.788(3) ˚A. The closest separation between the oxygen atom in a coordination water molecule and a Cu2+ ion in the neighboring chain is 3.3245(31) ˚A, indicating a weak interaction be- tween the coordination water molecules and the Cu2+ ions in neighboring chains (see Fig. 2). The crystal structure of the title complex is distinctly different from the structures reported in the literature.4,5 The two copper atoms in the bin- uclear copper(II) complex [Cu2(Phen)2(Hphth)2 (NO3)(H2O)]NO3·2H2O4 are bridged by two car- boxylic groups from two phth ligands. This com- pound is monoclinic with space group P21/n, and the coordination polyhedron around each cop- per(II) ion is distorted square–pyramidal. The co- ordination polymer[(µ-phth)(pip)2Cu]5 n,is mono- clinic with space group I2/a. In its one-dimension chain, two carboxylic groups from each phth lig- and are coordinated to two adjacent copper(II) ions in a bidentate chelate fashion, respectively. The coordination geometry around each cop- per(II) ion is distorted octahedral. In conclusion, the synthesis and crystal struc- ture of a copper(II) complex, {[Cu(phth)(Phen) (H2O)]·H2O}n, have been reported. The two car- boxylic groups of each phth ligand are coordi- nated to two adjacent Cu2+ ions, respectively, in a monodentate mode, to form a one-dimensional polymeric chain structure. The hydrogen bonds between the coordination water molecules and the uncoordinated carboxylic oxygen atoms link adja- cent chains forming a two-dimensional structure. In addition, a weak interaction exists between the coordination water molecules and the Cu2+ ions in the neighboring chain.
