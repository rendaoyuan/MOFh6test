Single crystal X-ray structure analysis reveals that compound 1 features a 3D porous pillar-layer structure with 6-connected pcu topology. The free water molecules are ﬁlled in the 1D channels. Thermal analysis reveals that it can be stable up to 347 C. Lumi- nescence investigation for 1 reveals that it can be used as a good candidate for sensing of nitrobenzene. Keywords Zn(II) compound  Hydrothermal synthesis  Pillar-layer framework  Luminescence 1 Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed from organic ligands and metal ions are of current interest owing to their intriguing architectures and diverse multifunctional applications in luminescence, gas storage, drug delivery, heterogeneous catalysis, molecular magnetism and so on [1–5]. Of particular interest is to construct luminescent MOF sensors. Over the past few decades, a large number of luminescent MOF sensors for detecting cations, anions, organic small molecules, explosives and temperature have been realized and reported [6–9]. Comparing with the traditional luminescent MOFs, the characteristics of the luminescent MOF sensors are the permanent porosity, high surface areas and structural ﬂexibility [10]. Nitrobenzene is notorious environment pollutant, which can cause serious health problems [11]. Therefore, the development of an effective method for detection of nitrobenzene and its derivatives becomes more and more important. Recently, MOF-based luminescent detection shows great promise due to its simplicity and operability, and a lot of lumi- nescent MOF sensors have been discovered which displays higher selectivity for sensing of nitrobenzene and its derivatives [12–14]. Herein, we reported another new Zn(II) compound, namely {[Zn(atz)(C2O4)0.5]H2O}n (1 Hatz = 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole), which is a 3D porous pillar-layer framework with 6-connected pcu topology and exhibits selective luminescent sensing property for detec- tion of nitrobenzene. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Methods All the starting materials and reagents used in this work were obtained commercially and used without further puriﬁcation.

The temperature was held for 60 h, then the vessel was cooled to room temperature over 60 h to lead to the formation of colorless crystals of 1 (yield: 65 % based on Zn).

Empirical absorption corrections were applied to the data using the SADABS program [15]. The structure was solved by the direct method and reﬁned by the full-matrix least- squares on F2 using the SHELXL-97 program [16]. All of the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically, and the hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms were located at their ideal positions. Experimental details for the struc- ture determination are presented in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for compound 1 are listed in Table 2. 3 Result and Discussion 3.1 Crystal Structure Description of Compound 1 Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that compound 1 crystallizes in monoclinic P21/c space group and features a 3D pillar-layer framework with 6-connected pcu topology. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Zn(II) ion, one atz- ligand, half of C2O4 2- ion and one free water molecule. As shown in Fig. 1, the Zn(II) ion is ﬁve-coor- dinated with a square-pyramidal geometry, which is com- pleted by three nitrogen atoms from three different atz- ligands and two oxygen atoms from one C2O4 2- ion. The Zn–N and Zn–O distances locate in the range of 1.995(4)– 2.094(4) A˚ , 2.043(4)–2.222(4) A˚ , respectively.

In this 2D layer, two adjacent Zn(II) ions are connected by two pyrazole nitrogen atoms to generate a coplanar 6-mem- bered ring, and four symmetry-related Zn(II) ions are linked by four imidazole nitrogen to fabricate a 16-mem- erbed ring. Finally, such layers are further pillared by the C2O4 2- ions to generate a 3D pillar-layered framework (Fig. 2b). In addition, intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the amino groups of atz- ligands and carboxylate oxygen atoms of C2O4 2- (N4O2 = 3.089 A˚ , \N4–H4AO2 = 127), which further consolidate the framework of 1. When viewing along the crystallographi- cal a direction, there are rhombus channels with the dimension of 6.1128(3) 9 6.0048(4) A˚ . The free water molecules are ﬁlled in these rhombus channels via the hydrogen bonds between the free water molecules and carboxylate oxygen atoms of C2O4 2- (O1wO1 = 3.249 A˚ , \O1w–H1wbO1 = 161), free water mole- cules and CH groups of atz- ligands (C2O1w = 3.358 A˚ , \C2–H2AO1w = 147). After removal of the free water molecules, the solvent accessible volume in 1 is approximate 208.0 A˚ 3 per unit cell, and the pore vol- ume ratio is calculated to be 28.6 % using the PLATON program. To better understand the structure, topological analysis was also performed on compound 1. If the dinu- clear Zn(II) unit which is linked by the pyrazole nitrogen atoms from two different atz- ligands can be treated as a 6-connected node, and atz- and C2O4 2- can be reduced into linear linkers, the whole framework of 1 can be described as a 6-connected pcu topological network with the schla¨ﬂi symbol of {412.63} (Fig. 2c). 3.2 PXRD and Thermal analysis As shown in Fig. 3a, the experimental pattern matches well with the simulated one based on the single crystal X-ray diffraction data, indicating that the bulk samples of com- pound 1 are in pure phase. In addition, thermal analysis of compound 1 was also performed on polycrystalline Fig. 2 a 2D Zn(II)-atz layer in the structure of 1. b Perspective view of the 3D framework of 1 with the free water molecules ﬁlled in the 1D channels (green dotted lines represent hydrogen bonds). c Schematic representation of 6-connected pcu topological network for 1 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:1027–1031 1029 123 samples under a ﬂowing N2 atmosphere from 30 to 900 C. As shown in Fig. 3b, the ﬁrst weight loss of 8.12 % occurs in the temperature range of 110–145 C, which is consis- tent with the removal of one lattice water molecule per unit cell (calcd: 8.55 %). Then, the skeleton of compound 1 can be stable up to 347 C. After 347 C, the further weight losses represent the decomposition of the framework of 1. The remaining weight corresponds to the formation of ZnO (obsd: 36.02 %, calcd: 38.48 %). 3.3 Luminescent Properties Luminescent MOFs constructed from d10 transition metal ions and organic ligands are of great interest owing to their potential applications in chemical sensors and photo- chemistry. Hence, the solid state luminescent properties of compound 1 were investigated at room temperature (Fig. 4). Upon excitation of 340 nm (Fig. S2), compound 1 has a maxima emission at 420 nm. In order to ascertain the luminescence origin, the luminescent property of free Hatz ligand was also investigated at the same conditions. As shown in Fig. S3, the maximum emission of free Hatz ligand is at 418 nm with the excitation of 345 nm. Com- paring the emission spectra of compound 1 and free Hatz ligand, we found that the emission spectrum of compound 1 is similar with that of the free Hatz ligand with a slight red-shift of 2 nm, and the complexation of Hatz ligand to Zn(II) ions enhances luminescence intensity. Therefore, the luminescence emission of 1 should be mostly derived from the intraligand charge transfer [17]. The corresponding luminescence lifetime of compound 1 is 0.1321 ns. Com- pound 1 possesses potential 1D channels which are occu- pied by the free water molecules, therefore, the potential sensing properties for organic small molecules were investigated. First, compound 1 was heated at 145 C to remove the free water molecules. Then the obtained porous samples were immersed in different solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, DMF, chlorobenzene and nitrobenzene. Compared to that of compound 1 and the desolvated samples, signiﬁcant luminescence quench effect was observed only for nitrobenzene, the other solvents did not affect the luminescent intensity of the desolvated samples. Such luminescence quench phenomenon was caused by the electron transfer from the atz- ligand to electron-deﬁcient nitrobenzene. These results demonstrated that compound 1 has higher selectivity for nitrobenzene compared to other organic molecules. The structures of the desolvated samples and desolvated samples after immersed in the organic solvents have no obvious changes compared with compound 1, which is conﬁrmed by the powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S1).

Luminescent investigations reveal that compound 1 exhibits intense room lumines- cence and has higher selectivity for sensing of nitrobenzene. 5 Supplementary Data CCDC No. 1019533 contains the supplementary crystal- lographic data for this paper.
