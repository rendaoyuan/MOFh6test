Manuscript Journal of Crystallographic and Spectroscopic Research, Vol. 19, No, 1, 1989 Crystal structure of copper(II)mellitate, [Cu3.sC6(COO)5(COOH)(OH)e(HzO)s.s] 9 4.5HzO HATSUE TAMURA,* KAZUHIDE OGAWA, and WASUKE MORI Institute of Chemisn% College of General Education Osaka University, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan (Received May 1, 1988) Abstract The crystal structure of copper(II)mellitate, Cu3.5C12H29027, has been deter- mined by X-ray analysis. The complex crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Iba2, with unit-cell dimensions a = 19.274(3), b = 21.054(7), c = 12.956(4) A. The structure was deduced by the direct method with the help of the Patterson method and refined by the block-diagonal least-squares technique to a final R value of 0.037 for 2995 observed reflections. Among six carboxyl groups of mellitic acid, five groups lose protons and form coordinate bonds to four copper atoms, and the remaining group forms hydrogen bonds to the water of crystallization and coordinated water. The configuration around copper is distorted-pyramidal, with the Cu--O bond distances of 1.896(7) to 2.425(7) Introduction Two types of copper(II)mellitate crystals have been isolated at 60~ and 50~ from aqueous solutions of copper(II)acetate and mellitic acid. The for- mer, type a, forms dark-blue crystals with a magnetic moment of 2.05 B.M., and the latter, type ~, light-blue crystals with 1.94 B.M. at room temperature (Mori et al., 1981). The magnetic susceptibilities (X) were measured in the range of 4.2 to 300 K. The plots of 1/X against temperatures for the tire com- pound (type c~) are divided into two parts at ca. 130 K. In each of the parts 1/ X obeys the Curie-Weiss law (1/X = C(T - 0)): at temperatures above 130 K the 0 value (+10 K) indicates the presence of the ferromagnetic interaction 203 0277-8068/89/0200-0203506.00/0 9 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation 204 Tamura et aL between Cu(II) ions, and at temperatures below 130 K the 0 value (-3 K) apparently shows the dominance of the antiferromagnetic interaction. The crys- tal structure analysis has been undertaken to clarify the relationship between the molecular structure and the magnetic behavior. Experimental Preparation Since the crystals(A) prepared from an aqueous solution of cop- per(II)acetate and mellitic acid did not give well-defined reflections for the X- ray analysis, the title compound(B) was prepared using copper(II)formate instead of copper(II)acetate by the following method. An aqueous solution of cop- per(II)formate (1 retool) was added to an aqueous solution of mellitic acid (0o3 mmot) for suspensions to be formed. After about 2 days, keeping the temper- ature at 60~ dark-blue crystals separated from the suspensions. The crys- tals(B) were shown to be the same compound as the crystals(A) by elemental analysis, the magnetic behavior and the X-ray powder pattern. Anal:Found: C, 17.56; H, 3.50%. Calcd for CH3.5Ct2H29027: C, 17.41; H, 3.53%. Data Collection Intensity data were measured by the ~0 - 20 scan technique on a Rigaku four-circle diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Kc~ radiation. The size of the crystal used was 0.2, 0.2, 0.3 mm~ The scan speed and scan width in ~0 were 2 ~ min -~ and (1.1 + 0.35 tan 0) ~ respectively. Of 3113 independent reflections collected up to 20 = 55 ~ , 2995 reflections with IF0] > 2~r(IF0!) were used in the subsequent calculations. Corrections were made for the Lorentz and polarization effects, but not for absorption.

Structure determination The systematic absences, hkl: h + k + 1 = 2n + 1; OkI: k = 2n + 2 (l = 2n + 1) and hOl: h = 2n + 1 (l = 2n + 1), indicate the probable space group Ibam (No. 72) or Iba2 (No. 45). The latter was confirmed by a statistical distribution of E values and a successful refinement of the structure. Using 300 Structure of C12I-I29Cu3.5027 205 reflections with IE[ _> 1.553, the crystal structure was deduced by the program MULTAN 78 (Main et al. 1978). To ascertain the positions of copper atoms, the Patterson method was adopted. The E-map and the subsequent weighted Fourier synthesis revealed the positions of all non-hydrogen atoms.

Several cycles of block-diag- onal least-squares refinement with isotropic temperature thctors brought the R value to 0.076. After several further cycles of block-diagonal least-squares refinement were carried out with anisotropic temperature factors, R dropped to 0.037. The function minimized was Sw(IFol - [Fcl) 2, with w = t.0 for all reflections. All the atomic scattering factors were taken from International Tables for X-Ray Crystallography (1974)~ The computations were carried out on an ACOS-S900 computer at Cry. s- tallographic Research Center, Institute for Protein Research Laboratory, Osaka University, with the Universal Crystallographic Computing System-Osaka (Ashida, 1979).

Structure of C12H29Cu3.5027 209 Geometry of the mellitic acid The environment of the six carboxyl groups of mellitic acid are classified into the following three types: (1) a carboxyl group forming a coordinate bond to a copper atom, and a hydrogen bond to water of crystallization or coordinated water, (2) a carboxyl group forming the coordinate bonds to two copper atoms, and (3) a carboxyl group forming the hydrogen bonds to water of crystallization and coordinated water. The carboxyl groups bonded to C(1), C(2), C(3), and C(5) of the benzene ring belong to the type (1). The bond lengths, C(7)--O(1), C(8)--O(3), C(9)--O(5) and C(11)--O(9) range from 1.27 A to 1.29 A, while the bond lengths, C(7)--O(2), C(8)--O(4), C(9)--O(6)and C(11)--O(10), are from 1.20 A to 1.23 A.. The carboxyl group bonded to C(6) belongs to the type (2). The two C--O distances are not greatly different, suggesting consid- erable resonance. The mean C--O bond length, 1.25 _~, is comparable to those in pyridinecopper(II)acetate dimer(monoclini c form) (Barclay et al., 1961), its orthorhombic form (Hanic et al., 1964) and copper(II)benzoate trihydrate (Koizumi et al., 1963). The carboxyl group bonded to C(4) belongs to the type (3)~ The two C--O bond lengths are equal within the experimental error.

The benzene ring is planar with the maximum deviation of 0.03 A. The carboxyl carbon atoms deviate from the least-squares plane of the benzene ring in the range of +0.11 A to -0.14 *. Each of the plane of the carboxyl groups is twisted out of the plane of the benzene ring in the range of 43.1 ~ to 74.0 ~ Environment of the copper atom The configurations of the copper atoms are distorted-pyramidal as shown in Fig. 3. The Cu(2) and Cu(3) atoms form the six-membered ring with the 0(24), O(Q), C(12) and O(J) atoms as shown in Fig. 4. The same arrangement of syn-syn Cu--O--C--O--Cu as in Cu(HCOO)(OH) (Tamura et al., 1981) is found in this six-membered ring.

Crystal structure The crystal structure is built up from layers of copper(II)mellitate and lay- ers of water of crystallization stacked alternately as shown in Fig. 5. The former layers, nearly perpendicular to the c axis, are formed in such a way that the five carboxyl groups of mellitic acid are coordinated to six copper atoms by losing protons, and the remaining one carboxyl group forms hydrogen bonds to water of crystallization and coordinated water. The coordinated water protrudes from the former layer into the latter layer of water of crystallization. The former layers and the latter ones are linked together by hydrogen bonds (Table 3).
