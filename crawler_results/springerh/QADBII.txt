Manuscript COMMUNICATION Syntheses and Characterization of 2D and 3D Organotin Polymers with Phenylsuccinic Acid and Trimethyltin Chloride Under Different Conditions Rufen Zhang • Yun Ren • Qingfeng Wang • Chunlin Ma Received: 9 November 2009 / Accepted: 27 January 2010 / Published online: 10 February 2010  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010 Abstract Two types of di- and trimethyltin(IV) polymers [(Me2Sn)4O2(C10H8O4)4]n 1 and [(Me3Sn)2(C10H8O4)]n DMF 2 have been synthesized by the reaction of trimeth- yltin chloride with (±)-phenylsuccinic acid under two different experimental conditions. Both of the complexes are characterized by elemental analysis, IR, NMR (1H, 13C, 119Sn) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallographic diffraction analysis. The structural analyses show that complex 1 is a two-dimensional corrugated sheet polymer consisting of dimeric tetraorganodistannoxane units and bridging ligands. Complex 2 is a 3D corrugated polymer in which the deprotoned acid occurs as a tetradentate ligand and is bonded by the four oxygen atoms. It is worth noting that the X-ray diffraction study reveals that complex 2 crys- tallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121, which is chiral space group.

Among these materials, organotin (IV) dicarboxylates have been studied in considerable detail. In general, the reported organotin (IV) dicarboxylates exist as dinuclear, one-dimensional zig-zag chain and cyclic struc- tures [6–9]. Interestingly, only a few chiral carboxylate organotin compounds have been obtained, whereas there has emerged great interest in chiral organotin complexes for their potential biocidal activities and cytotoxicities [10–12]. Some chiral ligands such as (S)-(?)-6-methoxy-a-methyl-2- naphthaleneacetic acid, (?)-(1R,3S)-camphoric acid and meso-cis-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, which form (a) an inter-helical meander-shaped network, (b) a parallel double helix structure and (c) a 3D framework, have been obtained [13–15]. It is with this in mind, and owing to the fact that our research has been concerned for many years with organotin chemistry, that we chose to react the dicar- boxylate acid, (±)-phenylsuccinic acid, which has a chiral atom, with trimethyltin chloride under different experi- mental conditions. We have succeeded in obtaining two different organotin polymers. Herein we report the synthe- sis, characterization and crystal structures of two organotin polymers, one of which has a chiral space group as deter- mined by X-ray diffraction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Instrumentation Trimethyltin chloride and (±)-phenylsuccinic acid were commercially available and were used without puriﬁca- tion. The melting points were obtained with an X-4 digital micro melting-point apparatus and were uncor- rected. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet-5700 spectrophotometer using KBr discs and sodium chloride optics. 1H, 13C and 119Sn NMR spectra were recorded on R. Zhang  Y. Ren  C.

The spectra were acquired at room temperature (298 K) unless otherwise speciﬁed; 13C spectra are broadband proton decoupled. The chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to external references; tetramethylsilane (TMS) for 1H and 13C NMR and Me4Sn for 119Sn NMR. Elemental anal- yses (C, H and N) were obtained with a PE-2400II. 2.1.1 Synthesis of Complex 1 The reaction was carried out in a sealed Teﬂon-lined stain- less steel autoclave. A mixture of (±)-phenylsuccinic acid (0.194 g, 1 mmol), sodium ethoxide (0.136 g, 2 mmol), trimethyltin chloride (0.398 g, 2 mmol) and H2O (20 mL) was heated under a hydrothermal method (130 C) for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, colorless crystals were collected and washed with hexane. Yield: 82%. M.P. [ 250 C. Anal. Calc. (%) for C28H40O10Sn4: C, 33.25; H, 3.99; Found: C, 33.51; H, 3.68.

Trimetyltin chloride (0.398 g, 2 mmol) was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred for 12 h at 40 C, and ﬁltered. The solvent of the ﬁltrate was gradually removed by evaporation under vacuum until solid product was obtained. The solid was recrystallized from a mixed solvent and a transparent colorless crystal was formed. Yield: 77%. M.P. [ 250 C. Anal. Calc. (%) for C19H33NO5Sn2: C, 38.49; H, 5.61; N, 2.36.

A semi-empirical absorption correction was applied to the data. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 [16] and reﬁned against F2 by full-matrix least squares using SHELXL-97 [17]. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions. Crystal data and experimental details of the structure determinations are listed in Table 1. 3 Results and Discussion The synthesis of polymer complexes 1 and 2 is summarized in Scheme 1. 3.1 Spectral Characterization The common stretching frequencies are those associated with the C(O)O, Sn–C and Sn–O groups. A strong absorption appears at about 435–443 cm-1 in the spectra of both polymer complexes, but absent in the spectra of the free ligand, and is assigned to the Sn–O stretching vibra- tion. This band is consistent with that detected in a number of organotin(IV)-oxygen derivatives [18, 19]. In addition, strong bands appear in the 1535–1569 and 1339– 1371 cm-1 regions and correspond to asymmetric and symmetric vibrations, respectively, of the COO moiety. The values of Dv[vas(COO) - vs(COO)] in the two com- plexes (196–198 cm-1) fall within the range for a vibra- tional mode associated with a bidentate ligand [20]. The 1H-NMR spectra show the expected integration and peak multiplicities. In the spectrum of the free ligands, the resonances observed at 10.50 ppm, which is absent in the complexes 1–2, indicates the formation of the Sn–O and is consistent with the IR data. In 13C-NMR spectra, the position of the carboxylate carbon moves to the lower ﬁeld relative to the free ligands. This indicates coordination of the carboxylic group to tin [21]. The single resonances at 175.2–175.7 ppm are attributed to the COO groups in the complexes. The 119Sn- NMR spectra reveal different environments of the tin atoms. For complex 1, the chemical shifts are -167.1 and -263.8 ppm, whereas only one resonance occurs at -179.5 for complex 2. These values fall within the normal range of ﬁve-coordinated tin complexes [22]. 3.2 Description of Crystal Structures 3.2.1 Crystal Structure of Complex 1 The repeating unit and 2D polymeric structure of complex 1 are illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 2. The X-ray analysis establishes that complex 1 is a 2D corrugated sheet polymer, which is 400 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2010) 20:399–404 123 connected by dimeric tetraorganodistannoxane units as nodes and (±)-phenylsuccinic acids as linkers. In the complex, the dimeric tetraorganodistannane is the pre- dominant structural form in constructing the framework. The central motif of this structure is a non-planar cyclic Sn2O2 ring. The oxygen atoms of this distannoxane ring are tridentate, as they link two endocyclic and one exocyclic tin centers.

In the confor- mation, the ladder type Sn4O10C4 molecular skeleton is formed by three-four-membered Sn2O2 and SnO2C1 units as well as two-six-membered Sn2O3C1 fused rings. It should be noted that the endocyclic and exocyclic tin atoms are ﬁve-coordination and six-coordination, respectively (Fig. 1). The endocyclic tin atom Sn(2) is bound to two methyl groups, two l3-oxygen atoms and one carboxyl oxygen atom deﬁning a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination mode in which the axial positions are occu- pied by the two oxygen groups with an axial angle [O(5)#3– Sn(2)–O(3)] of 163.78(12). For Sn(1), the exocyclic tin atom is bound to two methyl groups and four oxygen atoms, which are three carboxyl oxygen atoms from two ligands and one l3-oxygen atom. Two methyl groups occupy the axial positions; and, the axial angle [C(11)–Sn(1)–C(12)] of 137.0(3) is deviated from the linear arrangement, which is based on a distorted octahedron with a basal plane deﬁned by four O atoms. In this complex, a stable six-membered ring was formed in which the endocyclic and exocyclic Sn atoms lay 0.852 and 0.821 A˚ out of the plane deﬁned by three coordinate oxygen atoms. 3.2.2 Crystal Structure of Complex 2 The molecular and 3D corrugated polymeric structures of complex 2 are illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 3. Complex 2 is a 3D corrugated sheet polymer that contains only one type of tin nuclei. All of tin atoms are ﬁve-coordinated with distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination mode and surrounded axially by two oxygen atoms and equatorially by three car- bon atoms of the methyl groups. The two oxygen atoms from two different ligands occupy the axial sites. The axial angles of the two tin atoms are O(2)#1–Sn(1)–O(1) = 167.9(4) and O(3)–Sn(2)–O(4)#2 = 172.8(4), respectively (sym- metry codes: #1 -x ? 1,y - 1/2,-z ? 3/2; #2 x - 1/2, -y ? 3/2,-z ? 1). The two carboxylic ligands take part in the coordination, therefore, the ligands are tetradentate. Viewing through the a direction, the six tin atoms linked through four ligands construct a 36-membered corrugated lattice. This lattice is further linked to six nearest-neighbor lattices to give rise to a 2D corrugated sheet. The sheets are further interlinked to form a 3D corrugated framework by intermolecular C=O ? Sn coordination interactions, thus giving another 36-membered corrugated channels, which Fig. 1 Repeating unit of complex 1 Fig. 2 The 2D network of complex 1 (all of the hydrogen groups were omitted for clarity) 402 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2010) 20:399–404 123 contain six tin nuclei. All of the Sn–O bonds lengths lie between the covalent bond length and the van der Waals radii of the two atoms. Complex 2 crystallizes with a DMF molecule; and, there is no obvious interaction between the solvent and the 2 moiety. 4 Conclusions This work demonstrates different crystal structures derived from the same reagent but different conditions. For example, complex 1 is obtained under the hydrothermal condition, forming an organotin polymer consisting of dimeric dicarboxylatotetraorganodistannoxane unit that acts as metal–organic secondary building units in the extended structures [7, 23]. Also, there is a solvent effect, which may give rise to interconversion among the ligands, as that reported in our previous work [24]. 5 Supplementary Material Crystallographic data for the structure analysis of the compounds have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, CCDC No. 736318 1, 736317 2.
