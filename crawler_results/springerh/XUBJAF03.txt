The structural analyses reveal that polymer 1 is a 3D coordination polymer. Its asymmetry unit contains two crystallographically inde- pendent Sm(III) ions, both are eight-coordinated. The 1,3- bdc2- anions show three different coordination modes. The structureofpolymer2 isisomorphouswiththatof1.Polymer3 is also a 3D coordination polymer, its asymmetry unit contains one Sm(III) ion, which is nine-coordinate. The mal2- anions have two different coordination modes. The structure of polymer 4 is isomorphous with that of 3. The luminescent study shows that polymers 1, 2, and 4 exhibit characteristic emission bands in the visible region, corresponding to the transitions of the Ln(III) ions. By comparison and analysis of luminescence, it is found that the incidence of the same ligand on the corresponding spectra of different Ln(III) ions is dif- ferent, and the inﬂuence of different ligands on luminescence of the same Ln(III) ion is also very different. Keywords Ln(III) coordination polymer  Synthesis  Crystal structure  Photophysical property Introduction Ln(III) coordination polymers, due to their fascinating structure and unique physical property, always attract more and more attentions. The study for features and application exploration of such polymers are mainly focused on the luminescence, magnetics, molecular recognition and sep- aration, medical diagnosis, cell imaging, etc. [1–10]. The luminescence of Ln(III) coordination polymers originates from the f–f transitions of Ln(III) ions. The intrinsic dis- advantage of the f–f transitions is that the absorption coefﬁcient is lower, thus resulting in weak emission [11, 12]. However, this weak absorbance can be overcome and improved effectively by coordinating suitable ligands with the antenna effect to the Ln(III) ion [13–17]. Typical ligands, such as b-diketonate, porphyrin, ﬂuorescein, 8-quinoline as well as their derivatives, have been dem- onstrated the successful sensitization to the luminescence of Ln(III) ion. Apart from sensitizing the luminescence of Ln(III) ions, the different ligands are crucial to generation of the fascinating structures. As far as carboxylate ligands, the ﬂexible carboxylate ligands (such as succinate, malonic, citric acids, etc.), while usually making a small contribution to sensitization of luminescence of Ln(III) ions (even quenching the luminescence), is more favorable for generation of the novel architectures and topologies because of their rich conformation capable of meeting the requirement for coordination geometry of different Ln(III) ions [18–20]. For example, the suc2- anion (H2suc = succinate acid) can feature cis- and trans-con- formations to assembly with Ln(III) ions, generating various coordination frameworks from 1D to 3D [21, 22]; the mal2- anion (H2mal = malonic acid) can adopt chair, boat, and envelope three conformations to bridge Gd(III) ions to form a 2D layer structure; curiously, in another Gd-mal polymers, Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11224-012-9957-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Compared with the ﬂexible ligand, under common circumstance, the rigid carboxylic ligand with high degrees of conjugation (such as benzene carboxylic acid, pyridine carboxylic acid as well as their derivatives, etc.), can efﬁciently sensitize the luminescence of Ln(III) ions after coordinating to the Ln(III) ions, usually presenting long luminescence lifetime and high luminescence intensity as well as good stability [8, 25, 26]. Therefore, ascertaining the luminescence, the relationship between luminescence and structure for Ln(III) coordination polymers has an important signiﬁcance for in-depth investigation on various properties and exploiting their practical applications. In this study, we report four Ln(III) coordination polymers with 3D extended structure bridged by isophthalato and malonato ligands, respectively. Their structures were determined by single- crystal X-ray diffraction. The luminescent property of polymers 1–4 in visible region was analyzed and assigned. The inﬂuence of ligands on emission spectra of Ln(III) ions is discussed. Experimental Materials and measurements The salt of Ln(NO3)36H2O was prepared by dissolving the corresponding lanthanide oxide compound (purity is 99.99%) in the excess nitric acid, and then naturally crys- tallizing. Other starting materials and reagents were AR and used as purchased. The elemental analyses were per- formed on a PE-2400 elemental analyzer. The crystal structures were determined with Bruker Smart APEX-II CCD X-ray single-crystal diffractometer. The FT-IR spectra were recorded in 4,000–220 cm-1 scopes on a JASCO FT-480 spectrometer with pressed KBr pellets technique. The diffuse reﬂectance absorption spectra were obtained in 200–2,500 nm scopes on a JASCO V-570 UV– Vis–NIR spectrometer. The excitation and emission spectra in UV–Vis region were measured with a JASCO FP-6500 ﬂuorescence spectrometer. Syntheses of the polymers {[Sm2(1,3-bdc)3(H2O)4]DMFH2O}n 1 Sm(NO3)36H2O (0.22 g, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in aqueous solution (5.0 mL), to which a mixture of 1,3-H2bdc (0.06 g, 0.35 mmol) and water (5.0 mL) was added under stirring and heating (50 C). Then, to the resulting clear solution, an appropriate amount of 1.0 mol L-1 NaOH solution was added dropwise to adjust the pH value to about 6. While, some white precipitate occurred, but they were dissolved following addition of DMF solution (5 mL). Then, the ﬁnal solution was transferred into a Teﬂon bottle sealed in an autoclave, which was heated at 90 C for 120 h. After cooling to room temperature and a standing period of 3 days, the reaction solution was ﬁltered and the brown-yellow block crystals were obtained, washed out with mother liquid, and dried out in the air.

The col- orless block crystals were obtained. The yield was 42% (0.20 g) based on Eu. Calc. for C27H29Eu2NO18 2 (Found): C, 33.80 (33.62); H, 3.05 (3.03); N, 1.46 (1.45)%.

[Sm2(mal)3(H2O)6]n 3 Sm(NO3)36H2O (0.22 g, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in aqueous solution (5.0 mL), to which a mixture of H2mal (0.1 g, 1 mmol) and water (5.0 mL) was added under stirring and heating (50 C), getting colorless solution. An appropriate amount of 1 mol L-1 NaOH solution was added dropwise to adjust the pH value to about 4. Then, the ﬁnal solution was stirred for 10 min and transferred into a Teﬂon bottle sealed in an autoclave, which was then heated at 90 C for 120 h. After cooling to room temperature and a standing period of 2 days, the reaction solution was ﬁltered and the colorless block crystals were obtained, washed out with mother liquid, and dried out in the air. The yield was 40% (0.14 g) based on Sm. Calc. for C9H18Sm2O18 3 (Found): C, 15.12 (15.04); H, 2.54 (2.52)%.

Single-crystal structural determinations X-ray single-crystal diffraction data for polymers 1–4 were collected on a Bruker Smart APEX-II CCD diffractometer at 293(2) K with Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) by x scan mode. Empirical absorption corrections were applied to the data using the SADABS program. Structures were solved by the direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least squares on F2 using the SHELXTL version 5.1 [27]. All of the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms bound to carbon atoms were placed in calculated position and reﬁned isotropically with a riding mode. Hydrogen atoms of coordinated water molecules were found via Fourier difference map, then restrained and reﬁned iso- tropically. Hydrogen atoms of lattice water molecules did not ﬁnd further, so they could not be introduced in the reﬁnement, but were included in the structure factor cal- culation. All the structural calculations and drawings were generated with the SHELXL-97 crystallographic software package. The main crystallographic data and structural reﬁnement parameters of polymers 1–4 are summarized in Table 1. Results and discussion Structural descriptions Structural analysis shows that polymer 1 is a 3D coordi- nation polymer. Its asymmetric unit comprises two crys- tallographically independent Sm(III) ions (Sm1 and Sm2), three 1,3-bdc2- anions, four coordinated water molecules, one uncoordinated DMF molecule, and one lattice water molecule (Fig. 1). The Sm1(III) ion is coordinated by the eight O atoms from ﬁve different 1,3-bdc2- anions and two coordinated water molecules, forming a distorted square antiprism geometry (Fig. S1a in Supplementary material). The bond lengths of Sm1–O are in the range of 2.362(3)– 2.560(3) A˚ (Table S1 in Supplementary material). The Sm2(III) ion is also eight-coordinate with six O atoms from ﬁve different 1,3-bdc2- anions and other two O atoms from two coordinated water molecules, forming a distorted square antiprism geometry (Fig. S1b in Supplementary material). The bond lengths of Sm2–O are in the range of 2.367(3)–2.538(3) A˚ (Table S1 in Supplementary mate- rial). The three crystallographically independent 1,3-bdc2- anions bond to Sm(III) ions in three different coordination modes: I-type, II-type, and III-type, respectively (Fig. 2). Each of carboxylate groups of I-type 1,3-bdc2- anion bridges two different Sm(III) ions (Sm1 and Sm2 ions) with a bridging bidentate mode in syn–anti conﬁguration [28] (Fig. 2a). The separation of Sm1Sm2 is 4.929 A˚ .

The two carboxylate groups of III- type 1,3-bdc2- anion bridge two equivalent Sm(III) ions(Sm1 or Sm2 ions) with a bridging bidentate mode in syn–anti conﬁguration[28], respectively(Fig. 2c). The sep- arations of Sm1CSm1B and Sm2Sm2D are 4.689 and 4.705 A˚ , respectively. In the crystal of 1, ﬁrst, [Sm(H2O)2]3? cations are bridged by 1,3-bdc2- anions with I-type and III-type coordination modes, forming three different binuclear units of [Sm2(1,3-bdc)2(H2O)4], named A, B, and C, respectively (Fig. S2 in Supplementary material). These binuclear units exhibit an ABCBABCB sequence along the a axis, forming a 1D chain (Fig. 3, Fig. S3 in Supplementary material). Second, the remaining carboxylate groups of intra-chain I-type 1,3-bdc2- anions together with II-type 1,3-bdc2- anions all coordinate to the Sm(III) ions from the adjacent chains along the b axis, building the 2D layers in the ab plane as shown in Fig. 4. Finally, these layers are further extended along the c axis through the III-type 1,3-bdc2- anions with coordinate of Sm(III) ions from adjacent lay- ers, generating the 3D network (Fig. S4 in Supplementary material). Uncoordinated DMF molecule and lattice water molecule adhere to the framework of polymer 1 through hydrogen bonds (Fig. S5 in Supplementary material), which contributes to the stabilization of crystal structure. The structure of polymer 2 is isomorphous with that of 1, with the Eu(III) ion taking the place of the Sm(III) ion. The bond lengths of Eu1–O and Eu2–O are 2.351(4)– 2.544(3) and 2.350(3)–2.528(3) A˚ , respectively (Table S1 in Supplementary material). Polymer 3 is also a 3D coordination polymer. Its asymmetric unit comprises one Sm(III) ion, one and one- second mal2- anions, and three coordinated water mole- cules (Fig. 5). The Sm(III) ion is nine-coordinate with six O atoms from four different mal2- anions and three O atoms from three coordinated water molecules, forming a distorted monocapped square antiprism geometry (Fig. S6 in Supplementary material). The bond lengths of Sm–O are in the range of 2.319(5)–2.611(4) A˚ (Table S1 in Supple- mentary material). The mal2- anions bond to Sm(III) ions in two different coordination modes, which are described as l2-mal2- and l4-mal2-, respectively (Fig. S7 in Sup- plementary material). In the crystal of 3, ﬁrst of all, [Sm(H2O)3]3? cations are bridged by l2-mal2- anions, forming a 1D chain along b axis (Fig. 6). Second, the 1D chains are further linked by one carboxylate group of l4-mal2- anion in turn along c axis, resulting in formation of the 2D coordination layer in the bc plane as shown in Fig. 7. Finally, the left car- boxylate groups of intra-layer l4-mal2- ligands coordinate to the Sm(III) ions from neighboring layers, thus the 2D layers are linked in turn along a axis, building a 3D net- work (Fig. S8 in Supplementary material). The structure of polymer 4 is isomorphous with that of 3, with the Eu(III) ion taking the place of the Sm(III) ion. The bond lengths of Eu–O are 2.307(4)–2.605(4) A˚ (Table S1 in Supplementary material). These distances are com- parable to the corresponding values of the reported Eu–mal complexes [29]. Although the structure of polymer 4 is Fig. 1 Asymmetric unit of polymer 1 (free DMF and lattice water molecules are omitted for clarity) Fig. 2 The coordination mode of three 1,3-bdc2- anions with Sm(III) ions in 1.

In this paper, we mainly focus on the luminescent properties of the four polymers, and the inﬂuence of structures of polymers on the luminescent properties. Fig. 3 The 1D chain of polymer 1 along a axis Fig. 4 The 2D layer of polymer 1 in the ab plane (coordinated water molecules are omitted for clarity) Struct Chem (2012) 23:1523–1531 1527 123 Photophysical properties UV–Vis–NIR absorption spectra The UV–Vis–NIR absorption spectra of polymers 1–4 are shown in Fig. S9 in Supplementary material. The absorp- tion spectra of the polymers 1 and 3 are composed the absorption bands of ligand and the f–f transition absorption bands of Sm(III) ions (Fig. S9a, c in Supplementary material). The absorption bands of ligand mainly lie in the ultraviolet region, while the f–f transition absorption bands of Sm(III) ion appear in the visible and near infrared region. The UV–Vis–NIR absorption spectra of polymers 2 and 4 are very similar (Fig. S9b, d in Supplementary material), composed of the absorption bands of ligand and the ligand-to-metal charge transition absorption bands (LMCT). They do not show the characteristic absorption bands of Eu(III) ions. The assignments of absorption spectra of four polymers and the corresponding ligands are listed in Table 2. Fluorescence spectra At room temperature, luminescence properties of the four polymers are investigated in the solid state. With kEx = 311 nm, polymer 1 exhibits the characteristic emission bands of Sm(III) ion at 490, 546, and 589 nm (Fig. 8a), which can be ascribed to the 4G2/5 ? 6HJ (J = 5/ 2, 7/2, 9/2) transition of the Sm(III) ion, respectively. The emission band from the transition (4G2/5 ? 6H7/2) is the strongest, which is similar to that in other Sm(III) complexes [31–33]. Compared with the theoretical emission bands of the Sm(III) ion [34] and the emission bands of other Sm(III) complexes reported [31–33], the emission bands of Sm(III) ion in polymer 1 present obviously blue-shift. Polymer 2 reveals the characteristic emission bands of the Eu(III)ionuponexcitationat395 nm.AsshowninFig. 8b,the emission bands are attributed to 5D0 ? 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transition, i.e., 579.5 nm (5D0 ? 7F0), 589 and 592.5 nm (5D0 ? 7F1), 613.5 and 619 nm (5D0 ? 7F2), 652 nm (5D0 ? 7F3), and 697 nm (5D0 ? 7F4) [35, 36].Theemission band (5D0 ? 7F0) is strictly forbidden in a ﬁeld of sym- metry, thus, the presence of which in polymer 2 reveals that the Eu(III) ion features a low-symmetry coordination environment [37, 38], in agreement with the result of X-ray single-crystal structural analysis. This is also reﬂected by the fact that the intensity ratio (5D0 ? 7F2/5D0 ? 7F1) in the solid state is high up to about 6.89, much higher than the value (0.67) for a centro-symmetric Eu(III) complex [37, 39]. The most intense transition is 5D0 ? 7F2, which implies a red emission light of 2. The spectrum of polymer 2 is similar to those obtained for related Eu(III)–aromatic- carboxylate complexes [31, 38]. With kEx = 300 nm, the ﬂuorescence spectra of poly- mer 3 is obtained (Fig. 8c). Only the characteristic emis- sion bands of ligand appear in the range of 321–440 nm, while the emission bands of Sm(III) ion are not observed. Upon excitation at 395 nm, polymer 4 shows the char- acteristic emission bands of Eu(III) ion (Fig. 8d). The bands at 579, 590, 613, 651, and 695 nm are attributed to the f–f transition of 5D0 ? 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), respec- tively. The most intense transition is also 5D0 ? 7F2. The presence of only one sharp peak in the region of the 5D0 ? 7F0 transition suggests the existence of a single chemical environment around the Eu(III) ion [40], which is in good agreement with the X-ray crystal structure of 4. The emission spectrum of 4 is similar to that of Eu(III)–mal complex obtained at room temperature [29, 41]. The comparison and discussion of the luminescent properties of four polymers Comparing and analyzing the emission spectra of polymers 1–4, it can be found that (1) The characteristic emission bands of the Ln(III) ions are observed in polymers 1 (Sm), 2 (Eu), and 4 (Eu), Fig. 5 Asymmetric unit of polymer 3 (hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity) Fig. 6 The 1D chain of polymer 3 along b axis 1528 Struct Chem (2012) 23:1523–1531 123 while only the emission bands of ligand exist in polymer 3 (Sm). This indicates that the luminescence of Ln(III) ions in polymers 1, 2, and 4 get efﬁcient sensitization from ligands. (2) The same ligand shows different sensitization effects on luminescence of the different Ln(III) ions. For example, in polymers 1 (Sm) and 2 (Eu) bridged by 1,3-bdc2- anion, although the 1,3-bdc2- ligand efﬁciently sensitized the emissions of Sm(III) and Eu(III) ions with evidenced by quenching of the emissions of ligand (Fig. S10a in Supplementary material), the extent of the sensitization is different. In the same determination condition, even if the Ex. slit is (3, 3 nm) for polymer 1 and (3, 1 nm) for Fig. 7 The 2D layer of polymer 3 in the bc plane (coordinated water are omitted for clarity) Table 2 The assignment of UV–Vis–NIR absorption spectra of polymers 1–4 and ligands Polymer Absorption (nm) (assignment) Theoretical value [34] (nm) 1 (Sm) 1544, 1484, 1382, 1232, 1076, 940 1570, 1520, 1410, 1260, 1100, 955 (6H5/2 ? 6FJ, J = 1/2,3/2,5/2,7/2,9/2,11/2) 436 (6H5/2 ? 4F5/2) 453 314, 282, 254 (LLCT) 2 (Eu) 398 (LMCT) 282, 262 (LLCT) 3 (Sm) 1560, 1502, 1390, 1244, 1082, 942 1570, 1520, 1410, 1260, 1100, 955 (6H5/2 ? 6FJ, J = 1/2,3/2,5/2,7/2,9/2,11/2) 478, 404 (6H5/2 ? 4FJ, J = 5/2,7/2) 453, 404 314, 256 (LLCT) 4 (Eu) 392 (LMCT) 322, 258 (LLCT) 1,3-H2bdc 290, 248 (LLCT) H2mal 208 (LLCT) Struct Chem (2012) 23:1523–1531 1529 123 polymer 2, the emission intensity of polymer 2 is still much higher than that of polymer 1. Similarly, for polymers 3 (Sm) and 4 (Eu), the mal2- ligand only play the role of sensitization on the Eu(III) ions in polymer 4. This may be due to that the emissive energy levels of different Ln(III) ions are different. This also was presented in other Ln(III) complexes reported [31]. (3) The incidence of the structure of ligands and the coordination environment of Ln(III) ions obviously affect the luminescence of Ln(III) ions. The conju- gated extent of the ligand is better, the luminescence is stronger for corresponding ligand Ln(III) com- plexes. For example, the 1,3-bdc2- ligand has rigid cyclo-conjugated structure, while the mal2- ligand has not. Therefore, the emission intensity of polymer 2 is much stronger than that of polymer 4 under the same determination condition (the same kEx and Ex. slit) (Fig. 9b). For polymers 1 and 3, the emission bands of Sm(III) ion have not been observed in polymer 3 (Fig. 9a). This may be due to that the emissive energy levels of 1,3-bdc2- ligand with p-conjugated structure are richer than that of mal2- ligand, so they may match well with the emissive energy levels of Ln(III) ion (Fig. S11 in Supplemen- tary material). In addition, reducing the number of coordinated water molecules around Ln(III) ions can also be helpful for their luminescence, which is due to decreasing the non-radiative energy loss [37]. For example, there are two coordinated water molecules around Ln(III) ion for polymers 1 and 2, while there are three ones around Ln(III) ion for polymers 3 and Fig. 8 The emission spectra of polymers 1–4. a polymer 1 (Ex. slit: 3, 3 nm); b polymer 2 (Ex. slit: 3, 1 nm); c polymer 3 (Ex. slit: 3, 3 nm); d polymer 4 (Ex. slit: 3, 1 nm) Fig. 9 Comparison of the emission spectra of polymers: a polymers 1 and 3, b polymers 2 and 4 1530 Struct Chem (2012) 23:1523–1531 123 4. Therefore, the luminescence intensity of polymers 1 and 2 is stronger than that of polymers 3 and 4, respectively. Conclusions Four Ln(III) coordination polymers [Ln = Sm (1 and 3); Eu (2 and 4)] were hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Polymers 1 and 2 are isostructural, which possess 3D structure bridged by 1,3-bdc2- anion. Polymers 3 and 4 are also isostructural with 3D structure bridged by mal2- anion. The luminescence study shows thatpolymers1,2, and4 exhibit characteristic emission bands of corresponding Ln(III) ions beneﬁting from the sen- sitization of ligands; while polymer 3 mainly presents the emissions of ligand. By the comparative analysis of lumi- nescence, it is found that the structure of ligand, species, and coordination environment of central metal ions all obviously affect the luminescence of Ln(III) ions.
