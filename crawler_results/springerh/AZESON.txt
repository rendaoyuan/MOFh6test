Synthesis, crystal structure and magnetism of a 1-D polymeric manganese(II) complex with 2-hydroxyl-2-hydroxylate-malonate as bridging ligand Jing-Min Shi* and Si-Cheng Zhu Department of Chemistry, Shandong Normal University, Jinan 250014, PR China Wei-Dong Liu Department of Chemistry, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua 321004, PR China Received 12 September 2003; accepted 21 October 2003 Abstract A one-dimensional chain complex {Na[MnL(H2O)2]}n (L ¼ 2-hydroxyl-2-hydroxylate-malonate trivalent anion) has been synthesized and its crystal structure determined by X-ray crystallography. In the complex each Mn ion is located in a distorted octahedral environment with two oxygen atoms O(7) and O(8) from terminal ligands of two H2O molecules, and four other coordinating oxygen atoms O(1), O(5), O(3A) and O(6A) from two bridging ligands, respectively. Each bridging ligand provides four coordinating oxygen atoms, in which O(6) comes from the hydroxylate, O(5) from the hydroxyl, and O(1) and O(3) from two carboxylate groups, respectively. The O(1) and O(5) atoms coordinate to one Mn ion and the O(3) and O(6) atoms coordinate to another Mn ion; a one- dimensional chain is thereby constructed. The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility of the complex was measured in the 4–300 K range. The magnetic coupling parameter is consistent with an antiferromagnetic exchange and generates the antiferromagnetic coupling parameter, 2J ¼ )0.0544 cm)1. Introduction For a long time much research interest has been focused on coordination polymers because they provide new materials with useful properties such as catalytic activ- ity, microporosity, electrical conductivity, non-linear optical activity, co-operative magnetic behavior, and so on. Malonate and substituted malonates are useful bridging ligands and some coordination polymers have been synthesized with these ligands; their structures and physical properties have been studied [1–9]. However, complexes with the 2-hydroxyl-2-hydroxylatemalonate trivalent anion as a bridging ligand have not been reported hitherto. Here we describe the synthesis, crystal structure and magnetism of the title complex. Experimental All chemicals are analytical grade and were used without further puriﬁcation. {Na[MnL(H2O)2]}n An H2O solution (10 cm3) of sodium 2,2-dihydroxyl- malonate (0.1796 g, 1.21 mmol) was added to an H2O solution (8 cm3) of Mn(ClO4)2 Æ 6H2O (0.3925 g, 1.08 mmol). The mixture was then stirred for a few min. Colorless single crystals appeared after the ﬁltered solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 days. (Found: C, 14.2; H, 1.8; Mn 22.6%. C3H5 MnNaO8 calcd.: C, 14.6; H, 2.0; Mn, 22.2%.) Physical measurements I.r. spectra were recorded on a Bruker i.r. spectrophoto- meter using KBr discs. C, H and N elemental analyses were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer elemental analyzer, Model 240. The variable-temperature magnetic suscep- tibility measurement was performed using a crushed single crystal sample in the 4–300 K range with a SQUID magnetometer and applied magnetic ﬁeld of 3000 Oe.

A total of 4659 reﬂections were collected in the 2.11 £ h £ 26.37 range, of which 1687 reﬂections were independent [R(int) ¼ 0.0397] and 1206 reﬂections with I > 2r(I) were considered as being observed and used in the succeeding reﬁnement. Corrections for Lp factors were applied and all non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic thermal parameters. Hydrogen atoms were located from a diﬀerence Fourier map and reﬁned isotropically using a riding model with displacement parameters. The ﬁnal reﬁnement, including hydrogen atoms, converged to R ¼ 0.0456 and wR ¼ 0.0988. w ¼ 1/ [r2(F0)2 + (0.0566P)2] where P ¼ ðF 2 0 þ 2F 2 c Þ=3, S ¼ 0.937.

The programs for the structure solution and reﬁnement were SHELXS-97 (Sheldrick, 1990) and SHELXL-97 (Sheldrick, 1997), respectively. The goodness-of-ﬁt was on F2 ¼ 0.939. The selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 1, and the hydrogen bonding data in Table 2. Results and discussion I.r. spectra The i.r. absorption bands of sodium 2,2-dihydroxylma- lonate are 1604 cm)1 (vs) and 1378 cm)1 (s) for the mas(C@O) and ms(C@O) vibrations respectively, whereas in the complex the m(C@O) vibrational bands shift to 1616 cm)1 (vs) and 1372 cm)1 (s). The large separation between mas(C@O) and ms(C@O) suggests that the ACOO) groups take part in a monodentate structure, and the coordination is identical with the X-ray analy- tical result. The i.r. spectrum of the complex also exhibits a strong broad band for H2O at ca. 3312 cm)1. Crystal structure Figure 1 shows the coordination diagram for the com- plex with the atom numbering scheme. It indicates that the manganese(1) atom is coordinated by O(7), O(8), O(1), O(5), O(3A) and O(6A) atoms, in which the O(7) and O(8) atoms come from two H2O molecules, and the other four oxygen atoms are from two bridging ligands, respectively. The bond length data and associated angles dealing with manganese(1) indicate that the manga- nese(1) atom is located in a distorted octahedral environment.

The same NaAO distances range from 2.642(4) to 2.771(4) A˚ and indicate that the weak chemical bonds [10] exists between the Na and O atoms as shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 displays the unit cell and the one-dimensional chain. It indicates that the two neighboring branching chains are connected to each other through the NaAO bonds and lead to the formation of the one-dimensional chain. The hydrogen bonding between the chains leads to a two-dimensional sheet in the ac plane, and these sheets are stacked along the b-axis to form a three-dimensional crystal structure. The deposition number for the crystal at the CCDC is 205667. Magnetic properties In order to determine the magnetic coupling between the bridging manganese(II) ions in the one-dimensional chain complex, the formula of the one-dimensional manganese(II) chain magnetic susceptibility was used [11]. The experimental data ﬁt well with the formula as shown in Figure 3, which gives the best ﬁt parameters: 2J ¼ )0.0544 cm)1, g ¼ 2.00, h ¼ )0.0024 cm)1 and the agreement factor F ¼ [S(vm)obs ) S(vm)calcd]2/S(vm)2 obs ¼ 1.3 · 10)5. The very small J value indicates that there exists a very weak magnetic coupling between the bridging manganese(II)ions, and the very small h value also suggests a very weak magnetic interaction in the interchains. In multi-atom bridge complexes the mag- netic exchange interaction is generally propagated by a delocalized p orbital, whereas in the present complex there exists no such p orbital in the bridging ligand 2- hydroxyl-2-hydroxylate-malonate, which might have led to the very weak magnetic coupling.
