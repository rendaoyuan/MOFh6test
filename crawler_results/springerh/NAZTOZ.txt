Manuscript Syntheses, Characterization and Crystal Structures of 1D and 2D Organotin Polymers Containing 3-Methyladipic Acid Ligand Rufen Zhang • Shaoliang Zhang • Chunlin Ma • Qingfeng Wang Received: 22 August 2011 / Accepted: 29 October 2011 / Published online: 11 November 2011  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract Four new organotin (IV) complexes of two types [(R2Sn)2(C7H10O4)(l3-O)]n (R = Me: 1; nBu: 2; and {(R3Sn)2[C5H10(COO)2]}n (R = Me: 3; nBu: 4) have been synthesized by the reaction of 3-methyladipic acid with the corresponding R3SnCl (R = Me, nBu) under two different experimental conditions. All the complexes were charac- terized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, and NMR (1H, 13C, 119Sn) spectroscopy. Except for 2, all of the complexes were also characterized by X-ray crystallography. The structural analyzes show that complex 1 is a 1D inﬁnite chain polymer and forms a 2D organotin framework through intermolecular C–HO interactions and weak SnO interactions. Complexes 3 and 4 are 2D network polymers in which 3-methyladipic acid acts as a tetra dentate ligand coordinated to the trialkyltin (IV) ion.

Among them, self-assembly of organotin complexes are attracting more and more attention in view of their considerable structural diversity and topologies [6–12]. Organotin (IV) derivatives of carboxylates are attracting considerable attention due to their biological properties such as anti- fungicidal and promising antitumor activity [13–16]. In recent years [17–22], a large number of organotin polymers have been reported. Etaiw et al. have reported a 3D supramolecular coordination polymer containing quinoxa- line molecule, multidimensional supramolecular coordina- tion polymers containing triphenyltin cation and CuCN, and a novel 3D-supramolecular coordination polymer based on CuCN, Ph3Sn cation and quinoxaline. In our previous work, we have reported several interesting organotin structures derived from multi-ligands through self-assembly, such as six-tin-nuclear 32-member macro- cyclic complexes with o-mercaptobenzoic acid [23], a hexanuclear 60-membered macrocyclic complex with 1-(4-carboxyphenyl)-5-mercapto-1H-tetrazole and a 3D organotin polymer with phenylsuccinic acid [24, 25]. Although, considerable self-assembly of organotin complexes has so far been reported, most were synthesized by conventional synthetic methods, such as a standard Schlenk technique and reﬂux. Recently, solvothermal synthesis (STS) has become an efﬁcient method for pre- paring novel coordination complexes using the simple inorganic or organometallic compounds and organic ligands as starting materials. STS is also a superb technique for crystallizing products that hardly arise from other synthetic methods [26]. In our previous work, we have obtained a 12-member cyclic organotin complex [27], a 1D helical chain [28], a 3D corrugated sheet polymer with (±)-phenylsuccinic acid [29] using the STS method. To con- tinue research in this area, we selected the di carboxylate acid, 3-methyladipic acid, to react with trialkyltin (IV) under different experimental conditions and succeeded in obtaining four new organotin polymers. Herein we report the syntheses and crystal structures of these polymers. R. Zhang  S. Zhang  C. Ma Department of Chemistry, Liaocheng University, 252059 Liaocheng, People’s Republic of China C.

The melting points were obtained with a Koﬂer micro melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Elemental analyzes were performed with a PE-2400II apparatus. Infrared spectra were recorded with a Nicolet-5700 spectrometer using KBr disks and NaCl optics. 1H, 13C, and 119Sn NMR spectra were recor- ded with a Varian Mercury plus 400 spectrometer operat- ing at 400, 100.6, and 149.2 MHz, respectively. The spectra were acquired at room temperature unless other- wise speciﬁed. 13C NMR spectra are broadband-proton- decoupled. The chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to external tetramethyl silane for 1H and 13C NMR and to neat tetramethyltin for 119Sn NMR. 2.2 Synthesis of Complexes 1–4 2.2.1 Synthesis of Complex [(Me2Sn)2(C7H10O4)(l3-O)]n (1) The reaction was carried out in a sealed Teﬂon-lined stainless steel autoclave.

A semi-empirical absorption correction was applied to the data. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 and reﬁned against F2 by full matrix least-squares using SHELXL-97. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions. Crystal data and experimental details of the structure determinations are listed in Table 1. 3 Results and Discussion The synthesis of complexes 1–4 are shown in Scheme 1. 3.1 Spectral Characterization The IR spectra of complexes 1–4 were recorded from 4000 to 400 cm-1. The stretching frequencies of interest are those associated with the COO-, Sn–C, and Sn–O groups. A strong absorption at 448–454 cm-1 in 1–4, which is absent in the spectrum of the free ligand, is assigned to the Sn–O stretching vibration. Also strong absorptions at 1553–1582 and 1392–1410 cm-1 in 1–4 are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the COO- moiety. The strong peaks at 653–670 cm-1 in 1 and 2 are assigned to m(O–Sn–O) and indicate O–Sn–O bridging structures. These values are consistent with comparable bands detec- ted in other organotin (IV) derivatives [30, 31]. The 1H NMR spectra of the ligands show a signal for the –CO2H proton that is absent in the complexes, indicating the removal of that proton and formation of the Sn–O bond. This is consistent with the IR data. The 13C NMR spectra of the complexes show a signiﬁcant downﬁeld shift of all carbon resonances relative to the free ligand [e.g., 13C NMR (CDCl3, d ppm): 177.35 (COO); 41.80 (a-CH2); Table 1 Crystallographic data and structure reﬁnement parameters for complexes 1, 3, and 4 Complex 1 3 4 Empirical formula C11H22O5Sn2 C13H28O4Sn2 C31H64O4Sn2 Formula mass (g mol-1) 471.67 485.73 738.20 Wavelength (A˚ ) 0.71073 0.71073 0.71073 Crystal system Triclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Space group p-1 p21/c p21/c a (A˚ ) 9.3383(8) 9.8407(9) 10.2592(12) b (A˚ ) 9.4705(9) 16.1592(14) 10.3391(12) c (A˚ ) 9.9759(12) 12.9919(11) 19.213(2) a () 108.208(2) 90 90 b () 97.6470(10) 109.8800(10) 101.4450(10) c () 95.9290(10) 90 90 V (A˚ 3) 820.73(14) 1942.8(3) 1997.5(4) Z 2 4 2 Dcalc (Mg/m3) 1.909 1.661 1.227 l (mm-1) 3.052 2.577 1.276 F (000) 456 952 764 Crystal size (mm) 0.35 9 0.21 9 0.14 0.37 9 0.17 9 0.15 0.41 9 0.18 9 0.15 Reﬂections collected 4110 10085 9686 Independent reﬂections 2818 3432 3523 Rint 0.0537 0.0419 0.0834 Goodness-of-ﬁt on F2 1.091 1.036 1.023 R1 [I [ 2r(I)], R1 (all data) 0.1062, 0.1854 0.0380, 0.0590 0.0756, 0.1719 wR2 [I [ 2r(I)], wR2 (all data) 0.2568, 0.3544 0.0876, 0.0974 0.1974, 0.2474 502 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:500–506 123 29.52 (b-CH); 31.91 (c-CH2); 32.36 (d-CH2); 19.10 (–CH3)] owing to electron-density transfer from the ligand to the metal atom. The single resonances in 1–4 at 176.81–179.72 ppm are attributed to the COO- groups. These data are consistent with the structures of 1–4. Values of d(119Sn) from -210 to -400, -90 to -190 and 200 to -60 ppm are associated with six-, ﬁve-, and four-coordinated tin centers, respectively [32]. The 119Sn NMR spectra of 1 and 2 show two signals, respectively. The two signals lie in the range of six- and ﬁve-coordi- nated. On this basis, we conclude 1 and 2 in solution have two different coordination environments about tin, which are accordance with the structure in the solid state. It may be inferred that the structures are not affected in the pres- ence of DMSO solvent. The 119Sn NMR spectra of 1 and 2 are similar to the structure we have previously reported [25]. The 119Sn NMR spectra of 3 and 4 show one signal. The signal lies in the range of ﬁve-coordinated tin. Thus, 3 and 4 have only one coordination environment about the tin centers in solution, which is in accordance with their structures in the solid state. These analyzes are also con- ﬁrmed by the X-ray crystal structures of the 1, 3 and 4. 3.2 Description of Crystal Structures 3.2.1 Crystal Structure of Complex 1 The repeating unit, 1D polymeric chain, and 2D super- molecular structure of complex 1 are illustrated in Fig. 1; selected bond lengths and bond angles for this complex are given in Table 2. The X-ray analysis establishes that 1 is a 1D inﬁnite polymeric chain, which is connected by dimeric tetraorganodistannoxane units as nodes and 3-methyladipic acids as linkers. The predominant structural form of 1 is dimeric dicarboxylatotetraorganodistannoxane, which consists of a central planar (Me2Sn)2O2 four-membered ring and two peripheral Me2Sn units, where each bridging an O-atom in the Sn2O2 ring is attached to three Me2Sn Scheme 1 Synthesis procedures of 1–4 Fig. 1 a Repeating unit of 1. b The 1D polymeric chain structure of 1 (Green and pink polyhedra signify two types of tin centers). c 2D metal framework of 1 made up of intermolecular C–HO interactions and weak SnO interactions (Color ﬁgure online) J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:500–506 503 123 units. As a result these O-atoms are three-coordinate. It should be noted that the endocyclic and exocyclic Sn- atoms are six-coordinate and ﬁve-coordinate, respectively (Fig. 1a). In the case of Sn(2), there are six primary bonds to the central Sn-atom: two to the methyl groups, two to the l3 O-atoms, and two to the carboxyl O-atoms. Two CH3 groups occupy axial positions; the axial angle [C(10)– Sn(2)–C(11)] of 144.2(12) deviates from a linear arrangement, which is based on a distorted octahedron with a basal plane deﬁned by four O-atoms. For Sn(1), the exocyclic Sn-atom is bonded to two CH3 groups and three O-atoms, which are two carboxyl oxygen atoms from two ligands and one l3 O-atom. The geometry of Sn(1) can be described as a distorted trigonal bipyramid in which the apical positions are occupied by the O-atoms from two carboxylate groups [O(4)#1–Sn(1)–O(1) = 165.5(7)]. In this complex, a stable six-membered ring is formed in which the endocyclic and exocyclic Sn-atoms lie 0.039 and 0.033 A˚ out of the plane deﬁned by three-coordinate O-atoms. The Sn–O bond lengths in 1 ranges from 2.025(16) to 2.578(17) A˚ , which is consistent with the literature [33]. The Sn–C distances, which are almost identical, lie within the narrow range of 2.06(3)–2.16(3) A˚ and are in agreement with the values reported for related structures [29]. As shown in (Fig. 1b), 1 has a 1D inﬁnite chain structure constructed from approximately hexagonal rings. Each ring is composed of two deprotoned 3-methyladipic acid ligands and two dimeric tetraorganodistannoxane units. This structural feature of 1 is quite different from that of {(Me2Sn(OAc)2O)2}n, a 1D organotin polymer, in which the acetate links the dimeric tetraorganodistannoxane units in a tetradentate mode [34]. The most interesting aspect of this structure concerns the intermolecular C–HO and SnO interactions, which help in the construction of the supramolecule. In (Fig. 1c), the 1D chains are connected via intermolecular interactions C(8)–H(8B)O(2)#4 [C(8)O(2)#4, 3.08(4) A˚ ; H(8B)O(2)#4, 2.43 A˚ ; C(8)– H(8B)O(2)#4, 124.9], C(9)–H(9B)O(2)#4 [C(9)O(2)#4, 3.16(3) A˚ ; H(9B)O(2)#4, 2.54 A˚ ; C(9)–H(9B)O(2)#4, 122.7], and Sn(1)O(2)#4 into a 2D metal framework. The Sn(1)O(2)#4 distance (3.055 A˚ ) is considerably shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the Sn- and O-atoms (3.68 A˚ ) [35]. Thus, if a weak SnO interaction is taken into consideration, the geometry of Sn(1) is best described as distorted octahedron. 3.2.2 Crystal Structure of Complex 3 The repeating unit and 2D polymeric structure of 3 is illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 (the similar structure of 4 is not displayed); selected bond lengths and bond angles for this complex are given in Table 3. In 3, the trimethyltin (IV) groups are linked by a carboxylate group of each depro- tonated 3-methyladipic acid ligand, which in turn used its two bidentate carboxylate groups to coordinate to four metal centers. Thus, four ligands are linked by four metal centers into a 26-membered macro cycle, which is further linked to eight nearest-neighbor tin centers by four inde- pendent deprotonated 3-methyladipic acid ligands to give Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for complex 1 Complex 1 Sn(1)–C(8) 2.06(3) Sn(1)–O(1) 2.196(16) Sn(1)–C(9) 2.09(3) Sn(1)–O(4)#1 2.164(17) Sn(2)–C(10) 2.16(3) Sn(1)–O(5) 2.025(16) Sn(2)–C(11) 2.11(3) Sn(2)–O(1)#2 2.578(17) Sn(2)–O(3)#1 2.260(18) Sn(2)–O(5) 2.047(15) Sn(2)–O(5)#2 2.124(16) C(11)–Sn(2)–C(10) 144.2(12) O(4)#1–Sn(1)–O(1) 165.5(7) O(5)–Sn(2)–O(3)#1 88.8(7) O(5)–Sn(1)–C(8) 107.6(10) O(5)–Sn(2)–O(5)#2 76.8(7) O(5)–Sn(1)–C(9) 108.4(9) O(5)–Sn(2)–O(1)#2 143.0(6) C(8)–Sn(1)–C(9) 143.9(12) O(3)#1–Sn(2)–O(1)#2 128.1(6) Symmetry code: #1: x - 1, y - 1, z; #2: -x, -y, -z ? 1 Fig. 2 Repeating unit of complex 3 Fig. 3 The 2D polymeric structure of complex 3 504 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:500–506 123 rise to a 2D network polymer with a cavity whose size can be evaluated by the SnSn distances; i.e., 6.816–13.566 A˚ . Similar cavities have been found within the polymeric crystal structures of microporous metal–organic frame- works formed between 3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid and tin atoms [36]. In 3, as a result of the bidentate mode of coordination of the deprotonated dicarboxylic acid, each of the Sn-atoms has a coordination number of ﬁve. The geometry at each Sn center is a distorted trigonal bipyramid with the coordi- nated O-atoms occupying the axial sites. Three CH3 groups occupy the equatorial plane. The O–Sn–O angles in 3, [Sn1, 178.03(15); Sn2, 176.82(14)] are different from each other. The O–Sn–O skeleton, with average angle of 177.425, is similar to that of [EtPh2SnOC(O)CH3] [37], and is bent and slightly larger than that of di- and trior- ganotin carboxylates with hexameric structure [38]. The sum of the C–Sn–C bond angles in 3 (Sn1, 359.3; Sn2, 359.1) is close to ideal (360). All the Sn–O and Sn–C distances lie in the range of 2.185–2.384 A˚ (av. 2.282 A˚ ) and 2.101–2.131 A˚ (av. 2.113 A˚ ), which is consistent with those reported for other triorganotin carboxylates [39]. 3.2.3 Crystal Structure of Complex 4 The selected bond lengths and bond angles for 4 are given in Table 4. Similarly to 3, 4 is also a 2D network polymer, which is composed of 26-membered rings. Four Sn-atoms together with four ligands construct the basic unit for the framework. Each 3-methyladipic acid as a tetra dentate ligand affords by four O-atoms connecting four adjacent ligands to give rise to the 2D network; and, the width of 26-ring channel is 8.630–13.474 A˚ . Similar cavities have been found within the polymeric crystal structures of microporous metal-organic frameworks formed between 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and Sn-atoms [40]. The coordination environment of each Sn-atom in 4 is a distorted trigonal bipyramid, where the equatorial positions are occupied by three n-butyl groups and the axial positions are shared by two O-atoms from the ligands. The axial O(1)–Sn(1)–O(2)#1 angle of 4 is not 180, but 171.6(3), which supports a distortion of the geometry. The sum of the angles at the Sn-atom in the equatorial plane is 358.4 for Sn(1), Thus, the Sn(1), C(5), C(9), and C(13) atoms are almost in the same plane. The Sn(1)–O(1) distance [2.179(8) A˚ ] is slightly shorter than reported in other organotin complexes [41], and approaches the Sn–O covalent bond length (2.13 A˚ ). The Sn(1)–O(2)#1 distance [2.429(9) A˚ ] is longer than the Sn–O covalent bond length (2.13 A˚ ), but considerably shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two atoms (3.68 A˚ ) [35]. The Sn–C bond lengths [2.066(16)–2.075(14) A˚ ] are consistent with those reported for other triorganotin derivatives [42]. 4 Conclusions Four new organotin (IV) complexes of two types have been successfully synthesized and characterized by elemental analyzes, IR, NMR spectra and X-ray single-crystal dif- fraction. Both the spectra and crystal structures show that when 3-methyladipic acid reacts with triorganotin complexes under hydrothermal conditions, organotin polymers form that consist of dimeric dicarboxylatote- traorganodistannoxane units. However, when the reaction was carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere (standard Schlenk technique), 2D network polymers made up of 26-mem- bered rings form. In general, different crystal structures are derived from the same reagents but under different conditions.
