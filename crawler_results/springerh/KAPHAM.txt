Inorganic-organic hybrids constructed of bis(undecatungstogermanate)lanthanates polyoxoanions and oxalate-bridged dinuclear copper complexes and their magnetic properties. Chinese Sci Bull, 2011, 56: 2331−2336, doi: 10.1007/s11434-011-4488-x Recently, the successful design and synthesis of poly- oxometalates(POMs)-based hybrids has attracted consider- able interest because of their diverse structures and topo- logical properties, as well as their potential applications in catalysis [1–4]. Polyoxometalates with a strong ability to accept electrons, have been extensively used as inorganic building blocks for the construction of these materials con- taining organic complexes. An effective approach is to co- valently link transition metal-organic ligands with POMs [5–7]. The transition-metal (TM) copper centers can have various coordination numbers and elements as well as coor- dination modes. They can form expansive structures by a combination of donors containing N or carboxyl groups (such as acetates and oxalates) [8,9] or by bridging Cl at- oms to obtain highly nuclear magnetic clusters [10,11]. More attention has recently been given to the POM-based hybrids that have been modified by dinuclear copper com- plexes containing carboxyl ligands. The carboxylate bridg- ing ligand can mediate magnetic exchange interactions be- tween metal ions [12–16]. Many oxalate-bridged dinuclear copper hybrids have been constructed using classical poly- oxoanions such as the monosubstituted Keggin type [SiW11O39Cu]6− and the Anderson type [M(OH)7Mo6O17]2− (M=Al, Cr) by Reinoso et al. [16] and our group [17]. However, the use of bis(undecatungstogermanate)lanthan- ates as inorganic building blocks has not been widely ex- plored, possibly because they are difficult to assemble be- cause of their large size. Only our group has reported a simi- lar building block based on bis(undecatungstophosphate) lanthanates polyoxoanion inorganic-organic hybrids. Herein, we successfully isolated 5 inorganic-organic hybrids K2NamH9−m[{Ln(GeW11O39)2}{Cu2(bpy)2(μ-ox)}]·nH2O (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine and ox=oxalate; Ln=La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd; n = 19, 17, 22, 20, 19; m = 4, 4, 4, 9, 2) by introducing dinuclear copper (II)-oxalate into the bis(undecatungstoger- manate)lanthanates cluster. X-ray structural analyses show 2332 Sun P, et al. Chinese Sci Bull August (2011) Vol.56 No.22 that compounds 1–5 are isomorphic and consist of [Ln(GeW11O39)2]13− polyoxoanion building blocks and ox- alate-bridged dinuclear copper metalorganic complex with a 1D chain structure. The 1D chain further connects to the 3D framework by π–π interactions of the bpy groups with neighboring chains. The magnetic susceptibility data indicate that antiferromagnetic coupling between the neighboring Cu2+ ions in the structure and the rare earth ions influences the magnetic property of the structure. 1 Experimental 1.1 Materials and instrumentation The compound K8−xNaxGeW11O39·9H2O was prepared as previously described [19]. All the chemicals were used as purchased without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were performed using a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer; Cu, W, K, Na and Ln were deter- mined using a PLASMA-SPEC (I) ICP atomic emission spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded from 400 – 4000 cm−1 on an Alpha Centauri FT/IR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. Thermal stability analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 instrument in flowing N2 at a heating rate of 10°C/min. Magnetic susceptibility data were col- lected from 2–300 K under a magnetic field of 1000 Oe on a Quantum Design MPMS-5 SQUID magnetometer. Diamag- netic corrections were estimated using Pascal’s constants. 1.2 Synthesis of K2Na4H5[{La(GeW11O39)2}{Cu2(bpy)2- (μ-ox)}]·19H2O (1) A cationic complex [Cu2(2,2-bpy)2(μ-ox)]2+ (A) and the bis(undecatungstogermanate) anion [La(GeW11O39)2]13− (B) were prepared. For A: to an aqueous solution (20 mL) of CuCl2·2H2O (68 mg, 0.4 mmol) were successively added a solution of 2,2-bipyrine (62 mg, 0.4 mmol) in ethanol (10 mL) and oxalic acid (25 mg, 0.2 mmol) in water (10 mL). For B: to an aqueous solution (20 mL) of LaCl3·7H2O (37 mg, 0.1 mmol) was added a solution of K8−xNaxGeW11O39· 9H2O (610 mg, 0.2 mmol) in 1 mol/L (20 mL) potassium acetate buffer at pH 4.8. Then, solution A was added drop- wise to solution B and a blue precipitate appeared. The re- sulting mixture was heated to 80°C for 30 min, after cooling to room temperature, and the precipitate was removed by filtration. The filtrate was allowed to stand at room tem- perature for crystallization. Blue block-shaped crystals of compound 1 were obtained after about a week. Yield: 60% (based on W). Elemental Anal.

The structures were solved by the direct method and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method on F 2 using the SHELXTL crystallographic soft- ware package [20]. The hydrogen atoms were placed geo- metrically on the 2,2′-bipyridine ligands. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Synthesis and structure Compounds 1–5 were successfully isolated after the solution reaction of [Cu2(bpy)2(μ-ox)]2+ and bis(undecatungstoger- manate)[Ln(GeW11O39)2]13−. It is worth noting that the role of the potassium acetate buffer as an agent can be confirmed by the formation of bis(undecatungstogermanate) [Ln(Ge- W11O39)2]13− polyoxoanions. When the reaction was carried out without a potassium acetate buffer, the M/[α-GeW11O39] (M =Nd, Sm, Y, Yb) series of compounds formed [21]. It is obvious that the steady pH provided by the buffer solution is significant. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that compounds 1–5 are isomorphic only with slight differences in bond length, bond angle and the amount of lattice water (Table 1). Compound 1 is described as an example below. Compound 1 consists of [Cu2(bpy)2(μ-ox)]2+, [La(Ge- W11O39)2]13− and water molecules that are located inside the framework between the adjacent chains. The central Ln (III) ions are coordinated to eight unsaturated O atoms from the asymmetry of two [α-GeW11O39]8− ions and they exhibit a twisted square antiprismatic coordination geometry in the [La(GeW11O39)2]13− unit. In compounds 1–5, the bond lengths of Ln-OPOM (La-Gd) vary from 2.552 to 2.394 Å (Table 2) along with a decrease in lanthanide ion size, which corresponds to the lanthanide contraction effect [22]. The centrosymmetric [Cu2(bpy)2(μ-ox)]2+ consists of two copper atoms bridged by an oxalate in a bis-bidentate fash- ion. Each of the copper atoms is six-coordinated in a con- torted octahedral coordination geometry, and they are Table 1 Crystal data and structure refinement parameters for compounds 1–5 1 2 3 4 5 Empirical formula C22N4H55Ge2W22LaCu2- Na4K2O99 C22N4H59Ge2W22NdCu2- Na4K2O101 C22N4H65Ge2W22SmCu2- Na4K2O104 C22N4H56Ge2W22EuCu2- Na9K2O102 C22N4H61Ge2W22GdCu2- Na2K2O101 M 6585.55 6626.92 6687.08 6762.57 6595.96 Crystal system Monoclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Space group C2/c C2/c C2/c C2/c C2/c θ range(°) 3.00–25.00 1.09–25.00 1.09–25.00 3.01–25.01 1.09–25.00 a (Å) 15.737(3) 15.920(2) 15.8644(13) 15.963(3) 15.6336(13) b (Å) 19.923(4) 20.038(2) 20.0581(13) 19.965(4) 20.0523(13) c (Å) 37.805(8) 38.106(5) 38.060(3) 37.694(8) 38.027(3) α (°) 90.00(0) 90.00(0) 90.00(0) 90.00(0) 90.00(0) β (°) 101.69(3) 101.981(2) 101.8660(10) 101.74(3) 101.5860(10) γ (°) 90.00(0) 90.00(0) 90.00(0) 90.00(0) 90.00(0) V(Å3) 11607(4) 11891(2) 11852.3(16) 11762(4) 11678.2(15) Z 4 4 4 4 4 F(000) 11748.0 11440.0 11424.0 11864.0 11336.0 Dc(g cm−3) 3.838 3.660 3.667 3.823 3.698 Abs coeff (mm−1) 23.130 22.644 22.769 23.010 23.171 Total data collected 44497 29976 29939 44165 29419 Unique data 10227 10463 10435 10364 10283 Rint 0.1191 0.076 0.0682 0.1226 0.0703 GOF 1.027 1.043 1.052 1.063 1.057 R1[I > 2σ (I)] a) 0.0574 0.0537 0.0518 0.0562 0.0543 wR2(all data) b) 0.1253 0.1434 0.1384 0.0922 0.1444 a) R1 = Σ||Fo|−|Fc||/Σ|Fo|; b) wR2 = [Σw(Fo 2−Fc 2)2/Σw(Fo 2)2]1/2. 2334 Sun P, et al. Chinese Sci Bull August (2011) Vol.56 No.22 Table 2 Ln–O bond lengths in compounds 1–5 Compound Ln–O bond length 1 (La3+) 2.526 – 2.552 2 (Nd3+) 2.440 – 2.507 3 (Sm3+) 2.403 – 2.479 4 (Eu3+) 2.398 – 2.467 5 (Gd3+) 2.394 – 2.464 connected by two oxalate oxygen atoms and two bipyridine nitrogen atoms at the equatorial positions and two terminal oxygen atoms from the [Ln(GeW11O39)2]13− polyoxoanions at the axial positions with a Cu–Cu distance close to the average of 5.2 Å. The connection between [Cu2(bpy)2(μ- ox)]2+ and La(GeW11O39)2]13− gives a 1D chain (Figure 1). Adjacent bipyridine layers further result in a 3D structure by π–π stacking interactions (distance between the bpy lay- ers are approximately 3.7 Å) (Figure 2). 2.2 IR spectroscopy The IR spectra of compounds 1–5 are similar, as shown in Figure 3, there are 4 characteristic asymmetric vibrations that result from the [Ln(GeW11O39)2]13− polyoxoanions, namely, mas(W–Ot), mas(W–Ob), mas(W–Oc) and mas(Ge– Oa) that appear at 943, 872, 755 and 816 cm−1, respectively. By comparing the IR spectra of the polyoxoanions with those of α-H4GeW12O40 [23], shifts and splits are present because of the lower symmetry. The characteristic peaks that are present between 1100 and 1600 cm−1 are attributed to the 2,2′-bipyridine ligand, and these are of low intensity with respect to those of the polyoxoanions. The features at about 755 cm−1 are assigned to vas (CO) and those at 1315 and 1360 cm−1 are assigned to vs (CO) while the broad absorption at 1642 cm−1 corresponds to v(OCO) of the oxalate ligand in bisbidentate bridging mode [24]. 2.3 Thermogravimetric analyses For compounds 1–5, the amount of lattice water was deter- mined by thermal gravimetric analysis. The curve of com- pound 1 gives a total weight loss of 11.69% between 25–750°C, which agrees with the calculated value of 11.85%. The weight loss of 5.17% at 25–260°C corresponds to the loss of all non-coordinated and coordinated water molecules (calcd. 5.19%). The weight loss of 6.52% at 260–750°C arises from the decomposition of organic mole- cules (calcd. 6.66%). Compounds 2–5 also undergo a two-step weight loss. 2.4 Magnetic properties Oxalate dinuclear copper compounds are known to exhibit strong antiferromagnetic interactions [25]. When rare earth ions are added to the dinuclear compounds, the crystal Figure 1 1D structure of compound 1 and the coordination mode of La ion. Figure 2 3D structure of compound 1. Sun P, et al. Chinese Sci Bull August (2011) Vol.56 No.22 2335 Figure 3 IR spectrum of compounds 1–5. structure becomes complex as the two copper (II) ions and the free Ln3+ make the analysis of the observed magnetic behavior difficult. For example, despite the presence of strong antiferromagnetic interactions, no relative maximum is observed on the susceptibility versus temperature curve. It is possible that the expected maximum is outside the measured temperature range but it is also possible that the maximum is enveloped by the contributions of the Ln(III) ions. According to the change in the rare earth ion f-orbital electronic number from zero to partially full to half full, the thermal evolution of the magnetic molar susceptibility and the χmT product of 1, 2 and 5 in the temperature range 2–300 K are shown selectively in Figure 4. For compound 1, from 300 to 2 K, the χm value increases gradually with a decrease in temperature and no maximum is observed. The χmT value is equal to 0.609 cm3 K mol−1 at 300 K, which is lower than the expected value of 0.750 cm3 K mol−1 for the two S = 1/2 Cu2+ centers with χmT = μeff 2/8 (considering g = 2). Upon cooling the samples, the product χmT decreases from 300 to 50 K, and χmT remains constant around 0.0869 cm3 K mol−1 when the temperature is lower than 50 K and this may be attributed to a paramagnetic impurity. The de- crease in χmT indicates the antiferromagnetic coupling of the bridged-oxalate dinuclear copper; and the rare earth ion (La3+, 4f 0) does not contribute to the magnetic property of the whole structure. Thus the oxalate-bridged dinuclear copper complex has intrinsic magnetism in the inor- ganic-organic hybrids. For compound 2, the χmT curve is different to that of the former because of the existence of paramagnetic Nd3+ ions. This fact indicates the predomi- nance of antiferromagnetic interactions in compound 2, as confirmed by the rapid decrease in the effective magnetic moment with a decrease in temperature from 300 to 2 K. Moreover, the exchange coupling must certainly be strong considering that Curie-Weiss behavior is not observed even at a high temperature on the reciprocal susceptibility curve. The χmT value at room temperature is equal to 1.789 cm3 K mol−1, which is lower than the expected value of 2.386 Figure 4 Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of com- pounds 1, 2 and 5 are (a), (b), (c), respectively. cm3 K mol−1 for two S = 1/2 Cu2+ centers with χmT = μeff 2/8 (considering g = 2) and one free Nd3+ ion in the 4I9/2 ground state (g′ = 8/11). Upon cooling the samples, the product χmT decreases very sharply and reaches a minimum (0.475 cm3 K mol−1) at 2 K, and this may be attributed to crystal field effects because of the intrinsic nature of the lanthanide se- ries [26]. For compound 5, the magnetic coupling is de- pendent on the exchange transfer integral between the 3d orbital of Cu (II) and the 4f orbital of Gd (III); however, the long Cu–Gd distance (10.527 Å) may affect the magnetic interactions in the whole structure. According to the Curie- Weiss law, there is a dominant antiferromagnetic coupling in oxalate-bridging Cu(II) dimers. Similar magnetic curves were found for compounds 2 and 5. For compound 5, the χmT curve is different to that of the former because of the existence of half-full Gd3+ (4f7) ions. The relationship be- tween 1/χm and T from 2–300 K fits the Curie-Weiss law 2336 Sun P, et al. Chinese Sci Bull August (2011) Vol.56 No.22 (χm = C/(T−θ ), giving C = 9.2989 cm3 K mol−1 and θ = −7.9092 K. The negative Weiss constant indicates that a dominant antiferromagnetic coupling exists in the structure. The χmT value at room temperature is 9.140 cm3 K mol−1, which is higher than the expected value of 8.625 cm3 K mol−1 for the two S = 1/2 (χmT = 0.750) Cu2+ centers with χmT = μeff 2/8 (considering g = 2) and one S = 7/2 (χmT = 7.875) free Gd3+ ion in the 8S7/2 ground state (g′ = 2). Upon cooling the samples, the product χmT decreases continually from 300 K to 2 K in a near straight line because the rare earth ions play a role in the magnetic character of this structure. 3 Conclusions In this paper, we synthesized five novel inorganic-organic hybrid compounds using bis(undecatungstogermanate) and oxalate-bridged dinuclear copper complexes by conven- tional methods. Magnetic susceptibility studies reveal a strong antiferromagnetic coupling in the dinuclear copper complexes and the choice of different rare earth ions affects the magnetic property of the structure. 1 Gouzerh P, Proust A.
