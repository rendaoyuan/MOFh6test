Complex 1 consists of discrete 2D cadmium complex, 4-cpa counter ions and free water molecules, which are assembled into a 3D supramolecular structure through hydrogen bonds and pp stacking interactions. Three-dimensional ﬂuorescence spectra of 1 were detected at room temperature under the excitation and the emission wavelengths in the range of 300–600 nm with the interval of 5 nm. The lifetime of the excited state of 1 upon exci- tation of 443 nm in solid-state at room temperature is 30.21 ns. The 4-cpa ligand and complex 1 have been screened for their phytogrowth-inhibitory activities against Brassica campestris L. and Echinochloa utilis Ohwi et Yabuno, and the results are compared with the activity of sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate. Keywords Cadmium(II) coordination polymer  Synthesis  Luminescence  Phytogrowth-inhibitory activity Introduction The design and synthesis of metal-organic coordination polymers (MOCPs) have received widespread attention in recent years due to their potential applications in gas sep- aration, catalysis, magnetism, optics and so on [1–5]. The observation of MOCPs derived from organic ligands and metal ions through a self-assembly route has been explored intensively, and many efforts have been devoted to use of N- and O-donor organic ligands as co-ligands to bridge metal ions to form inﬁnite network structures, such as one- dimension (1D) chain structure, and 2- or 3-D frameworks [6]. However, it is still a great challenge in crystal engi- neering to obtain designed and predictable frameworks with potential properties assembled by coordination bonds and/or supramolecular interactions such hydrogen bonds, p–p stacking, and charge-transfer interactions, etc. [7–9]. The combination of carboxylic acid and neutral pyri- dine-containing ligand offers a facile strategy to construct mixed-ligand frameworks [10, 11]. 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4-Hcpa), a ﬂexible ligand with versatile binding and coordination modes, which has been proven to be useful in the construction of coordination polymers [12, 13]. This is because the ﬂexible 4-cpa ligand will reduce the steric hindrance when coordinated to metals ions through car- boxylate groups. On the other hand, 1,3-bis(4-pyri- dyl)propane ligand (bpp) is an excellent candidate for constructing novel structures as the auxiliary ligands and may act as a bidentate bridge with different conformations or in a monodentate terminal mode, leading to the forma- tion of a variety of 1D chain, 2D layer and 3D network motifs [14]. Although a variety of transition metal ions have been used to construct MOCPs, the Zn and Cd MOCPs are the most commonly reported transition-metal- based luminescent MOCPs because the d10 metal ions not D.-Y.

Liu et al. [16] prepared a Cd2? MOCPs Cd2(BPVIC)2(SCN)4 by using a large p-conju- gated bidentate organic linker, which the emission peak of Cd2? MOCPs is signiﬁcantly red-shifted to 562 nm under excitation at 480 nm and the luminescence lifetime of the resulting Cd2? MOCPs is three times longer than that of the free organic linker. Qiu et al. [17] also prepared a Cd2?-based MOCPs involving in situ tetrazole ligand synthesis and used for selective ion (NO2 -) sensing. Moreover, phenoxyacetic acid is an important class of herbicides due to their high efﬁciency, broad spectrum, low toxicity and good selectivity [18]. In this paper, Cd(NO3)24H2O, 4-Hcpa and bpp have been introduced into a one-pot hydrothermal reaction to afford a new 2D Cd(II) coordination polymer {[Cd(4-cpa) (bpp)2H2O](4- cpa)(H2O)}n (1). The 3D luminescence of 1 and phyto- growth-inhibitory activities of 1 and 4-Hcpa have been discussed. Experimental 4-Hcpa and bpp were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Cd(NO3)24H2O and NaOH were analytical reagents pur- chased from Aladdin. All chemicals were commercially available and used as received without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were carried out using a Vario EL III Elemental Analyzer. Infrared spectra were recorded (4,000–400 cm-1) as KBr disks on a Shimadzu IR-440 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on an automatic simultaneous thermal analyzer (DTG-60, Shimadzu) under a ﬂow of N2 at a heating rate of 10 C/min between ambient temperature and 800 C. Powder XRD investigations were carried out on a Bruker AXS D8-Advanced diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA with Cu-Ka (k = 1.5406 A˚ ) radiation. Lumi- nescence spectra and lifetime for crystalline samples were recorded at room temperature on an Edinburgh FLS920 phosphorimeter. Preparation of {[Cd(4-cpa) (bpp)2H2O](4- cpa)(H2O)}n (1) Complex 1 was prepared by addition of stoichiometric amounts of Cd(NO3)24H2O (0.077 g, 0.25 mmol) and bpp (0.137 g, 0.5 mmol) to a hot aqueous solution (12 mL) of 4-Hcpa (0.093 g, 0.5 mmol), which the pH was adjusted to 7–8 with NaOH (0.08 g, 0.2 mmol) in advance. The result- ing solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature and sealed in a 23 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 160 C for 3 days under autogenous pressure. Colorless single crystals of (1) were obtained (yield: 56 %, based on 4-cpa) upon cooling the solution to room temper- ature at 5 C/h. Anal. For C42H44N4Cl2O8Cd (%): Calcd.

Phytogrowth-Inhibitory Activity Tests The phytogrowth-inhibitory activities of the ligand 4-Hcpa and complex 1 were determined using Brassica campestris L. and Echinochloa utilis Ohwi et Yabuno as samples of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants, respec- tively. Solutions of 4-Hcpa, 1 and sodium 2,4-dic- hlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-d) were prepared by dissolving them in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) with the addition agar (0.8 %, Difco) to concentrations of 20, 40 and 60 ppm. An agar-containing chemical or DMSO along (control) was poured into a 500 mL sterilized biopot. Then, 20 seeds of each plant sterilized with 70 % EtOH and 1 % NaClO were put on the agar and left for 7 days under 9,000 lux illu- mination at 28 (±1) C. The lengths of the roots were measured and averaged. The phytogrowth-inhibitory activity was expressed as the ratio of the length of roots treated with the chemicals to that of the control (1.00). X-Ray Crystallographic Determination Single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses of complex 1 was performed on a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer oper- ating at 50 kV and 30 mA using MoKa radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). Data collection and reduction were performed using the APEX II software [19]. Multi-scan absorption corrections were applied for all the data sets using SADABS, as included in the APEX II program [19]. The structure was solved by direct methods and reﬁned by least squares on F2 using the SHELXTL program package [20]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms attached to carbon and oxygen were placed in geometrically idealized positions and reﬁned using a riding model. Water H atoms were located in difference Fourier maps and reﬁned with distance restraints of O–H = 0.82 A˚ and HH = 1.39 A˚ , with a standard deviation of 0.01 A˚ , and with Uiso(H) = 1.5 Ueq(O). The routine SQUEEZE (PLATON) [21] was applied to the structure in order to remove diffuse electron density associated with badly disordered free water mole- cule (the highest electron density peak (Q1: x = 0.427, y = 0.061, z = 0.563, height = 1.95) in the unassigned peaks). Crystallographic data are listed in Table 1. Selected 64 J Chem Crystallogr (2014) 44:63–69 123 bond lengths and angles, and H-bonding parameters for the compound are given in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Results and Discussion Structure of 1 Single-crystal X-ray structure analysis reveals that 1 crystal- lizes in the P-1 space group and has a 2D layer structure. A thermal ellipsoid plot of 1 is shown in Fig. 1. The asym- metric unit of 1 consists of two unique Cd2? ions, one coor- dinated 4-cpa ligand, two bpp ligands, one coordinated water molecule, one free 4-cpa anion and one free water molecule. Thefreewatermoleculewasbadlydisorderedwiththe highest electron density peak (1.95) in the unassigned peaks and was removed from the reﬂections data using the program SQUEEZE (PLATON).Cadmium,ionCd1issix-coordinated byfournitrogenatomsfromfourdifferentbppligandsandtwo oxygen atoms from two different 4-cpa ligands and displays anoctahedralcoordinationsphere; Cd2isalsosix-coordinated surrounded by four nitrogen atoms from four different bpp ligands and by two water molecules. The Cd–O, Cd–N dis- tances and O–Cd–O, O–Cd–N bond angles ranging from 2.325(3) to 2.382(3) A˚ and from 86.48(10) to 180.0, respectively, all of which are within the range of those reported in other six-coordinated Cd(II) compounds with nitrogen and oxygen donating ligands [22, 23]. The coordination mode of 4-cpa ligand in 1 is depicted in Scheme 1b, the carboxylate group connects to one Cd center through a monodentate coordination. The bpp ligand has TG conformation (the two pyridyl groups of bpp ligand show different trans(T) and gauche(G) orientations) [14] and acts as a trans bidentate bridging ligand to link two Cd(II) ions (Scheme 1a), with the CdCd separations being 12.697 and 13.470 A˚ , respectively. In this manner, each l2-bpp ligand links two Cd atoms in l2-bridging bidentate coordination mode to result in a 2D layer network, with 4-cpa ligands and water molecules pointing up and down. Adjacent layers are further interconnected via O–HO hydrogen bonds involving carboxylate O atoms and water molecules to form a three-dimensional supramolecular network (Fig. 2b; Table 3). These are also stabilized by pp stacking inter- actions. The centroid to centroid distances involving parallel pyridyl rings of neighboring bpp ligands (Cg1 and Cg2 are the centroid of the C17–C21/N1 ring, and the C38–C42/N4 ring, respectively) is 3.6754(2) A˚ . Powder X-Ray Diffraction Analysis In order to check the purity of complex 1, bulk samples were measured by X-ray powder diffraction at room tem- perature.

IR Spectra Analysis FT-IR spectra of 1 was recorded as KBr pellets (Fig. 4). The IR spectra have strong, broad bands at 3,423 cm-1, which may be assigned to the m(O–H) stretching vibrations of the water molecules. The moderate absorption band observed at 3,040 and 2,923 cm-1 are attributed to the m(Cmethenyl–H) vibration of bpp ligand. The features at 1,613 and 1,404, 1,380 cm-1 are associated with the Scheme 1 The coordination modes of 4-cpa and bpp ligands in title compound Fig. 2 a View of the 2D layer network of 1; b View of the 3D supramolecular structure of 1, which formed hydrogen bonds and pp stacking interactions (dashed lines) Fig. 1 Thermal ellipsoid plot of the asymmetry unit of 1 with numbering scheme (30 % probability ellipsoids).

The respective values of (masym(COO-)–msym (COO-)) suggest that the carboxylate groups adopt two coordination modes, which is in agreement with the observed X-ray structure [24]. TGA of Complex 1 The TG and DTA curves of 1 are shown in Fig. 5. Complex 1 shows a gradual weight loss of 24.03 % (25–200 C), cor- responding to the escape of one free 4-cpa anion, one free water molecule and one coordinated water molecule (Calcd. 24.18 %). Then a sharp weight loss occurs above 200 C due to decomposition of the cation. Finally, 1 was completely degraded into CdO with total loss of 85.95 wt% (calcd. 85.71 wt%). Luminescent Properties of 1 As part of a continuing program dedicated to luminescent d10 systems,the three-dimensionalﬂuorescenceofcomplex1 was investigated at room temperature under excitation and emis- sion wavelengths in the range of 200–400 and 300–600 nm with the same interval of 5 nm. As shown in Fig. 6, complex 1 Fig. 3 Experimental and simulated XPRD patterns of 1 Fig. 4 IR spectra of 1 Fig. 5 Thermogravimetric curves (TG and DTA) for complex 1 Fig. 6 View of the three-dimensional ﬂuorescence of 1 under the excitation of 200–400 nm at room temperature J Chem Crystallogr (2014) 44:63–69 67 123 exhibits indigotin photoluminescence with an emission maximum of 443 nm upon excitation in range of 325–350 nm. Complex 1 represents an obvious qualitative change of luminescence property resulted from the interaction between metal ions and ligands. The emission of 1 probably origins from ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) [25] excited state, because both organic ligands have relatively large p-conjugated system of benzene-pyridyl rings and uses carboxylate oxygen and nitrogen donors to coordinate to Cd(II) ions, which beneﬁts the charge transfer between Cd(II) ion and organic ligands. The luminescent lifetime of solid complex 1 using an Edinburgh FLS920 phosphorimeter with 450 W xenon lamp as excitation source show the lifetime of the excited state of 1 upon excitation of 443 nm in solid-state at room temperature is 30.21 ns (Fig. 7). Phytogrowth-Inhibitory Activity Tests The phytogrowth-inhibitory activity of ligand 4-Hcpa and complex 1 was investigated and shown to be strong in Table 4. Complex 1 completely inhibited the germination of the seeds of B. campestris L. and E. utilis Ohwi et Yabuno at the concentration of 60 ppm, which superior to 4-Hcpa. The growth-inhibitory activity of 1 on B. cam- pestris L. was higher than 2,4-d, while this activity on E. utilis Ohwi et Yabuno it was lower than 2,4-d at the low concentration of 40 and 20 ppm, respectively. 4-Hcpa exhibits good herbicidal activities against both plants at the concentration of 60 ppm, but the activities are not satis- factory at lower concentration (20 and 40 ppm). We found that the complex shows superior effectiveness than ligand 4-Hcpa. It is possible that the ligand 4-Hcpa may be acti- vated by the Cd2? ion [26]. Conclusion In summary, a new 2D Cd(II) coordination polymer based on 4-cpa and bpp ligands has been synthesized and struc- turally characterized. Hydrogen bonds and pp stacking interactions link the 2D network into a 3D supramolecular structure. The solid-state three-dimensional ﬂuorescence spectra show that 1 emits bright indigotin ﬂuorescence with the ﬂuorescence lifetime of the excited state upon excita- tion of 443 nm is 30.21 ns, and could be used for light- emitting luminescent materials. The phytogrowth-inhibi- tory activity tests showed that complex 1 exhibited excel- lent biological activity against B. campestris L. and E. utilis Ohwi et Yabuno.
