The solvothermal reaction of CoCl2·4H2O and 4,4-sulfonyl- dibenzoic acid (H2SDBA) resulted in the formation of a three-dimen- sional coordination polymer [Co3(C14H8O6S)3(DMA)2(MeOH)].DMA (Ia) consisting of trinuclear Co3 oxo-cluster units. The Co3 trimeric units are connected by SDBA2– anions leading to a three dimensional Introduction The metal organic framework (MOF) compounds or inor- ganic coordination polymers (CPs) provided opportunities to harness and explore the benefits of combining the inorganic and organic chemistries. Such combination has facilitated the preparation of compounds with precise control over the com- position, structure, and dimensionality.[1] The compounds thus prepared, appears to show considerable potential for applica- tions in the area of catalysis,[2] selective sorption,[3] proton conduction,[4] magnetism,[5] optics,[6] drug delivery[7] etc. The usefulness of the porous nature of the structure has also been exploited during the post-synthetic modifications, which pro- vide platforms for the creation of chiral centers.[8] The post- synthetic modifications are achieved either by using a coordi- natively unsaturated central metal atom or by exchanging/mod- ifying the labile ligands bound with the central metal atoms.[9] Metal oxo-clusters with distinct shape and size are important not only for the geometric symmetry but also for their proper- ties.[10] It has been shown in recent years that some of the metal oxo-clusters can be employed as building units in MOF structures.[11] During the assembly of such structures, new clusters have also been identified and stabilized.[12] We have previously reported inorganic coordination polymers formed with metal clusters of different shapes and sizes.[13] Presently, we have prepared a new compound with Co3 clusters [Co3(C14H8O6S)3(DMA)2(MeOH)].DMA (Ia).

The terminal methanol molecules could be exchanged in a single crystal to single crystal (SCSC) fashion by other similar solvent molecules (ethanol, acetonitrile, water, ethyl- eneglycol). Magnetic studies on the parent compound, Ia, indicate anti- ferromagnetic interactions between the central metal atoms. antly, we have been able to exchange the bound solvent molecules in a single crystal to single crystal fashion. In this paper, the synthesis, structure, and related studies are described. Results and Discussion Structure of [Co3(C14H8O6S)3(DMA)2(MeOH)].DMA (Ia) The asymmetric unit consists of 86 non-hydrogen atoms (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). There are three crystal- lographically independent Co2+ ions: Co(1) exhibits distorted octahedral arrangement formed by the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the SDBA2– anions, Co(2) exhibits distorted octahe- dral arrangement, formed by four carboxylate oxygen atoms, one DMA oxygen atom [O(7)], and one oxygen of methanol [O(11)], and Co(3) exhibits tetrahedral environment formed by carboxylate oxygen atoms and a DMA oxygen atom [O(14)]. Both methanol and DMA molecules are terminal and hang freely from the central metal atoms. The Co–O bond lengths are in the range of 1.941(5)–2.213(6) Å [av. 2.096 Å for Co(1), 2.099 Å for Co(2), and 1.954 Å for Co(3)]. The selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in the Supporting Infor- mation (Tables S1 and S2). The oxygen atom of the methanol molecule [O(11)] is involved in O–H···O type hydrogen bond- ing interactions with the DMA oxygen atom [O(22)], with the O···O distance of 2.797(1) Å (Table S3, Supporting Infor- mation). The three different SDBA2– ions show differences in the bonding behavior of the carboxylate groups with the metal ions. Acid-1 has one of the carboxylate groups coordinating in the μ2-η2:η1 mode, while the other carboxylate group coordi- nates in the μ2-η1:η1 mode. Acid-2 and acid-3 have both the carboxylate groups coordinated in the μ2-η1:η1 mode (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). The Co2+ ions are connected by Stabilization of Co3 – Oxoclusters in a pcu Net Figure 1. (a) The trinuclear cluster observed in compound Ia. Note the Tancoite fragment (see text).

The spheres represent the trinuclear Co3 clusters. carboxylate groups to give rise to a trimeric secondary building unit [Co3(CO2)6], which resembles a fragment commonly ob- served in Tancoite mineral (Figure 1a).[14] Each trimer units are connected to each other through SDBA2– anions forming a two dimensional layer (Figure 1b), which are further cross-linked by SDBA2– anions leading to the formation of a three-dimensional structure (Figure 1c). From a topological view, if the Co3 clusters are considered as a node, then it would lead to a simple cubic arrangement, which is a classic pcu net with a Schläfli symbol of [412.63] (Figure 1c).[15] Z.

KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 2923 Solvent Exchange Studies The presence of terminal and freely hanging DMA and methanol groups in the structure encouraged us to explore the possibility of the exchange of the bound solvent molecules with other similar solvent molecules. Initially we attempted to exchange the bound methanol molecules with ethanol (Ib), acetonitrile (Ic), water (Id), and ethyleneglycol (Ie). To this end, good quality single crystals of Ia were soaked in a mix- ture of DMA and the other solvents at room temperature for a period of 7–8 d. Earlier attempts to replace the solvent mole- S. Bhattacharya, S. Natarajan ARTICLE cules using this approach was found to be successful.[9n–9s] During the solvent exchange, we observed that the single crys- talline nature of the compound was not destroyed (Figure S2, Supporting Information). There was also no noticeable change in the morphology or color of the crystals during this exchange process. A single crystal X-ray diffraction study of the ex- changed crystals revealed that the methanol molecules were indeed exchanged by other solvent molecules. There were only minor variations around the coordination sphere of the Co2+ ions. Our efforts to exchange the second solvent molecule, DMA, however, were not successful in spite of many attempts by modifying the conditions. The solvent exchanged com- pounds were characterized by IR, TGA, and elemental analysis studies. The structures of compounds Ib–Ie were found to be iden- tical with minor differences in the coordination arrangements around the metal ions (Figure S3, Table S4, Supporting Infor- mation). Of the three Co2+ ions, Co(1) exhibits distorted octa- hedral environment formed by the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the SDBA2– anions in all the compounds. Co(2) exhibits distorted octahedral arrangement in Ib, Ic, and Ie, and in Id it exhibits a distorted trigonal bipyramidal environment (Table S4). Since compound Id appears to have a five coordinate cen- tral cobalt atom with a long Co–O bond, we employed the structural index parameter “τ”, hypothesized by Addison and Rao to arrive at the coordination geometry.[16] The parameter “τ” is dependent on the angle between the ligands and the central metal atom (Table S5). For a five coordinated central metal atom (M in Scheme S1, Supporting Information), the ideal square pyramidal arrangement will be observed if α = β = 180°, keeping A as the axial ligand (β = BMD). A perfect trigonal bipyramidal geometry will be observed when α be- comes 120° and BMD becomes the main axis. But in case of a square pyramidal geometry, M moves out of the plane BCDE due to which α and β becomes less than 180° and can be ra- tionalized by the value (β – α), which has a value of 0° for a C4v and 60° for a D3h coordination arrangement. Thus, the geometrical parameter τ = (β – α)/60 was defined by Addison and Rao for a five coordinated system wherein τ should be 1 for a perfect trigonal bipyramidal environment and 0 for a per- fect square pyramidal environment and any deviation from this should be considered as a distortion. The τ parameter for Co(2) in compound Id was found to be 0.615 which is more close to 1 and suggests that Co(2) adopts a distorted trigonal bipyrami- dal geometry. The overall structures in all the cases are similar to the parent structure of Ia. IR, UV, and Thermal Studies IR spectra, recorded at room temperature, exhibited charac- teristic bands (Table S6, Figure S4).[17] Broad bands centered around 3600–3400 cm–1 in the IR spectra of compounds Ia– Ib and Id–Ie correspond to the O–H stretching of methanol (Ia), ethanol (Ib), water (Id), and ethyleneglycol (Ie).[17] The bands at ca. 3070 cm–1 for all the compounds correspond to the aromatic C–H stretching frequency of the benzene rings of SDBA2– ions. The bands at 2930 cm–1 with a shoulder at www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2014, 2922–2930 2924 2870 cm–1 for all the compounds could be due to the asymmet- ric and symmetric C–H stretching of the methyl groups of the lattice DMA molecules. The bands at 2300 cm–1 for compound Ic correspond to the CN stretching of the acetonitrile group. The two sharp bands at 1390 and 1290 cm–1 for each of the compounds correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the S=O group of SDBA2– ions. The bands at ca. 570 cm–1 correspond to the stretching frequency of C–S bond in SDBA2– ions. The diffuse reflectance UV/Vis spectra was recorded at room temperature for the sodium salt of the acid (Na2SDBA) along with the compounds Ia–Ie (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35, USA) (Figure S5). UV/Vis spectroscopic studies on Na2SDBA exhibited three absorption bands at 217 240, and 287 nm, which may be due to the π π*(B-band), π π*(K-band) and nπ*(R-band) transitions, respectively.[18b] Thus, the absorp- tion bands observed at ~220, ~250 and ~290 nm for all the compounds Ia – Ie, correspond to the π π*(B-band), π π*(K-band) and nπ*(R-band)transitions, respectively, of the SDBA2–, ligand. The bands observed at 480 nm and at 612 nm could be due to the 4T1g(P)4T1g and the 4A2g4T1g transitions of the octahedral Co2+ ions, whereas the transitions at 520 nm and at 560 nm correspond to the 4T1(P)4A2 and the 4T1g(F)4A2 transitions, respectively, of the tetrahedral Co2+ ions.[18] Room temperature solid state photoluminescence studies were also carried out on the powdered samples of Na2SDBA and the compounds Ia–Ie (Perkin-Elmer L.S.55) (Figure S6). Both Na2SDBA as well as the compounds were excited using a wavelength of 260 nm. Emission bands observed at 390 nm along with a shoulder at 410 nm would correspond to the π*π and π*n transitions, respectively, of the SDBA2– li- gand. The emission spectra of the compounds Ia–Ie also have emissions at comparable wavelengths, ca. 400 nm and 420 nm, which can also be attributed to the π*π and π*n transi- tions, respectively.[19] The excitation spectra of Na2SDBA as well as of the compounds Ia–Ie exhibits three peaks at 230 nm, 250 nm, and 274 nm (λemm = 400 nm) corresponding to the transitions as observed in the UV/Vis spectrum (Figure S6). The luminescence lifetimes of the excited states of compound Ia were also studied. The π*π and π*n transitions were monitored in the lifetime studies by employing a 260 nm exci- tation at room temperature (Figure 2). The fit of the lumines- cent decay curve to a third order exponential decay function indicates lifetime values of 2.03 ns and 1.69 ns, respectively, for the π*π (400 nm) and π*n (420 nm) transitions. The thermal stability of the compounds was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA studies were carried out under a constant flow of air (flow rate = 20 mL·min–1) in the temperature range of 30–850 °C (heating rate = 5 °C·min–1) (Table S7, Figure S7). Two distinct weight losses were observed in the TGA curves of compounds Ia–Ie. The first sharp weight losses of 20.6% (calcd. 21.2%) for Ia, 20.9% (calcd. 22%) for Ib, 20.5% (calcd. 21.7%) for Ic, 19.9% (calcd. 20.4%) for Id, and 21.7% (calcd. 22.8%) for Ie in the region 200–300 °C correspond to the loss of the coor- dinated and lattice DMA molecules and the coordinated Xsolvent Stabilization of Co3 – Oxoclusters in a pcu Net Figure 2.

The final weight loss of 60.5% (calcd. 59.5%) for Ia, 59.4% (calcd. 58.9%) for Ib, 60.1% (calcd. 59.1%) for Ic, 61% (calcd. 60.1%) for Id, and 59.7% (calcd. 60.1%) for Ie in the temperature range of 400– 500 °C correspond to the release of the SDBA2–. The final product of TGA studies in all the cases was identified by PXRD to be Co3O4 (JCPDS: 43–1003). Magnetic Studies Magnetic studies were carried out on the parent sample, [Co3(C14H8O6S)3(DMA)2(MeOH)].DMA (Ia) in the tempera- ture range 2–300 K using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design Inc., USA) (Figure 3). The overall magnetic behavior was found to be antiferromagnetic. The room temperature Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2014, 2922–2930 © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 2925 values of χMT per Co3 unit in Ia was found to be 10.03 emu mol–1 K, which is higher than the expected spin only value of 5.7 emu mol–1 K. This indicates that there is con- siderable contribution due to the spin-orbit coupling of Co2+ ions. The field-cooled (FC) and the zero-field cooled (ZFC) susceptibilities as a function of temperatures did not exhibit any noticeable divergence even at low temperatures. This sug- gests that there are no long range magnetic ordering in this compound. From a Curie-Weiss fit of the 1/χM vs. T plot in the temperature range 75–300 K, θp value of –51 K was ob- tained, which indicates antiferromagnetic interactions. The magnetic behavior of Co3 cluster appears to depend on the connectivity between the three central cobalt atoms. Thus, fer- romagnetic, spin-canted behavior as well as anti-ferromagnetic behavior has been observed in many of the Co3 cluster contain- ing compound (Table 1).[20] S. Bhattacharya, S.

Conclusions A new cobalt based coordination polymer [Co3(C14H8O6S)3(DMA)2(MeOH)].DMA (Ia) consisting of a trinuclear secondary building unit was synthesized and charac- terized. Coordinated solvent exchange by a single crystal to single crystal transformation was successful as shown by the substitution of coordinated methanol by a number of different solvents. The resulting structures, Ib–Ie, were found to be identical with the parent structure Ia. Magnetic studies indi- cated antiferromagnetic behavior. Experimental Section Physical Measurements: Elemental analysis was carried out with a Thermo Finnigan EA Flash 1112 series instrument. PXRD data were recorded in the 2θ range of 5–50° using Cu-Kα radiation (Philips X’pert Pro). The simulated powder X-ray patterns of the structures were generated from the single crystal XRD by using Mercury soft- ware (version 1.4.1). The observed PXRD patterns were found to be consistent with the simulated PXRD patterns for all the compounds (Figure S8, Supporting Information). IR spectra for the compounds were recorded using KBr pellet method (PERKIN ELMER SPEC- TRUM 1000). Synthesis of [Co3(C14H8O6S)3(DMA)2(MeOH)]·DMA (Ia): A mix- ture of or CoCl2·4H2O (0.3 mmol) and H2SDBA (0.3 mmol) was dis- solved in a solvent mixture of DMA/methanol (6 mL/2 mL) under con- tinuous stirring. HBF4 (0.06 mL) and NH4OH (0.023 mL) were added and the reaction mixture was homogenized under continuous stirring for 20 min. The final reaction mixture with a composition of 1(CoCl2·4H2O):1H2SDBA:216DMA:165CH3OH:1HBF4:1NH4OH was transferred to a 23 mL PTFE lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 110 °C for 3 d. Blue rod shaped crystals of Ia were filtered, Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2014, 2922–2930 © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The initial and final pH of the reaction medium was found to be 2.1 and 5.2, respectively. Elemental analysis: found (calcd): C 47.12 (47.76), H 4.29 (3.98), N 3.11 (3.04), S 6.71 (6.95)%. Solvent Exchange Studies: Exchange of the coordinated solvents in the compound Ia was attempted in a single crystal to single crystal fashion using the crystals of Ia, which led to the formation of a series of compounds with the general formula [Co3(C14H8O6S)3(DMA)2(Xsolvent)]·DMA {where Xsolvent = ethanol in Ib, acetonitrile in Ic, water in Id, and ethyleneglycol in Ie}. Few suit- able single crystals of compounds Ia were taken in separate glass vials, to which 3 mL of DMA and 1 mL of Xsolvent was added. The vials were capped and kept standing at room temperature for 7–8 d. The solvent exchanged crystals were collected, washed with chloroform, and dried in vacuo after which single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies were performed on the crystals. The successful exchange of the coordi- nated solvent molecules leading to the formation of the compounds Ib–Ie prompted us to prepare the compounds in bulk by employing a synthesis procedure that is similar to that employed to prepare the parent compound Ia. The synthetic conditions and the elemental analy- sis of all the synthesized compounds are listed in Table 2 Single Crystal Structure Determination: Suitable single crystals of compounds Ia–Ie were mounted on top a glass loop with the help of paraton oil. The data sets were collected at 120(2) K with an Oxford Xcalibur (Mova) diffractometer equipped with an EOS CCD detector. The X-ray generator was operated at 50 kV and 0.8 mA using Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å). Cell refinements and data reductions were performed using Crysalis Red.[21] The structure was solved by direct methods and refined employing SHELX97 present in the WINGX suite of programs (version 1.63.04a).[22] In all the compounds, hydrogen positions could be located on the coordinated solvent molecules (methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, ethyleneglycol). The hydrogen position could not be lo- cated for the lattice water molecules in compound Id and for some of S. Bhattacharya, S. Natarajan ARTICLE Table 2.

The geometry of the thermally disordered DMA molecules was opti- mized by using DFIX and DANG commands. Final refinement in- cluded atomic positions for all the atoms, anisotropic thermal param- eters for all the non-hydrogen atoms and isotropic thermal parameters for all the hydrogen atoms. The full-matrix least square refinement against |F2| were carried out using WinGx package of programs.[23] The details of the structure and final refinement parameters are given in Table 3. Molecular formulae and weights were corrected, accounting for the unidentified hydrogen atoms. www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg.
