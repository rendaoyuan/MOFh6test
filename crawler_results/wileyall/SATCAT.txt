KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2012, 18, 2812 – 2824 2812 DOI: 10.1002/chem.201101963 Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have received consider- able attention due to their fascinating structures and topolo- gies and potential applications in gas storage, sensors, sepa- ration, magnetism, and catalysis.[1] The use of secondary building units (SBUs) instead of single metal ions at the net- work vertices is a powerful means of directing the final framework topology and structure and has a significant impact on the properties of the resulting MOFs.[2] Among the many types of SBUs, the tetranuclear [Zn4OACHTUNGTRENUNG(COO)6] and dinuclear [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(COO)4] SBUs are widely researched and used; both are synthesized in situ in self-assembly reactions and function as six-connected octahedral and four-connected tetragonal nodes, respectively.[3,4] In pursing new MOF-based materials using the SBU strat- egy, we are interested in a type of heterothiometallic com- pound, generally formulated as [NR4]+ (2+ba)ACHTUNGTRENUNG[WS4CuaXb](2+ ba) (X=Cl, Br, I, CN, SCN; R=Me, Et, Pr, Bu). One WS4 2 ion chelating a certain number of Cu+ ions forms the basic unit, and the X ions or other ligands coordinate to the Cu+ atoms at the periphery of the unit. The most inter- esting aspect of this type of cluster as SBUs is that the number and arrangement of the Cu+ atoms around the WS4 2 unit can be varied by changing the synthesis condi- tions,[5] and different combinations of WS4 2 and Cu+ afford SBUs with different geometries and connectivities, such as [WS4Cu6]4+, which can act as a tetrahedral node,[6] and [WS4Cu4]2+, which can act as a square-planar node.[7] The basic structures of the [WS4Cux]x2 units are summarized in Table 1; classes I–VI are named according to the number of Cu+ atoms, and subscripts a–c denote isomers. To under- stand the performance of the [WS4Cux]x2 cluster units as SBUs is significant and also challenging, since only classes IIa,[5] IIIa,[8] IIIb,[9] IVa,[10] and VIa [6] have been employed in building MOFs. Two methods can be used to synthesize a [WS4Cux]x2- based MOF. In the two-step method, a cluster compound is first synthesized, and then treated with organic ligands. For example, in the reaction of [Et4N]4 4+ACHTUNGTRENUNG[WS4Cu4I6]4 and 4,4’- bipyridine, the ligand can substitute some of the Et4N+ and I ions and link the cluster units into an extended frame- work.[11] In the other, one-step method [NH4]2WS4 and CuI are mixed with the organic ligands directly, and a cluster- based MOF is obtained in a self-assembly reaction.[12] In our experience, the former, two-step method could facilitate synthesis of MOFs with desired SBUs, since the basic struc- ture of the cluster precursor can be maintained in the final MOFs under certain conditions, while the latter, one-step method is very important for synthesizing new cluster units, since the [WS4Cux]x2 unit is formed in situ under the influ- ence of many synthesis conditions, including organic ligands. In our early work, an MOF with VIa unit as SBU, namely, [(VIa)I4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(timtz)8/3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)12]n (timtz=2,4,6-tris(1H-imidazol-1- yl)-1,3,5-triazine) was synthesized by the one-step self-as- sembly method, whereby the VIa SBU functions as a tetra- hedral node and the timtz ligand as a triangular connector, forming a network with ctn topology.[6] We here report five MOFs 1–5 with Va,b, IVa,b, and IIIa units as SBUs obtained by the one-step self-assembly Abstract: Five metal–organic frame- works (MOFs) formed by [WS4Cux]x2 secondary building units (SBUs) and multi-pyridyl ligands are presented. The [WS4Cux]x2 SBUs function as net- work vertexes showing various geome- tries and connectivities. Compound 1 contains one-dimensional channels formed in fourfold interpenetrating di- amondoid networks with a hexanuclear [WS4Cu5]3+ unit as SBU, which shows square-pyramidal geometry and acts as a tetrahedral node. Compound 2 con- tains brick-wall-like layer also with a hexanuclear [WS4Cu5]3+ unit as SBU. The [WS4Cu5]3+ unit in 2 is a new type of [WS4Cux]x2 cluster unit in which the five Cu+ ions are in one plane with the W atom, forming a planar unit. Com- pound 3 shows a nanotubular structure with a pentanuclear [WS4Cu4]2+ unit as SBU, which is saddle-shaped and acts as a tetrahedral node. Compound 4 contains large cages formed between two interpenetrated (10,3)-a networks also with a pentanuclear [WS4Cu4]2+ unit acting as a triangular node. The [WS4Cu4]2+ unit in 4 is isomeric to that in 3 and first observed in a MOF. Com- pound 5 contains zigzag chains with a tetrahedral [WS4Cu3]+ unit as SBU, which acts as a V-shaped connector. The influence of synthesis conditions including temperature, ligand, anions of CuI salts, and the ratio of [NH4]2WS4 to CuI salt on the formation of these [WS4Cux]x2-based MOFs were also studied. Porous MOF 3 is stable upon removal and exchange of the solvent guests, and when accommodating dif- ferent solvent molecules, it exhibits specific colors depending on the polari- ty of incorporated solvent, that is, it shows a rare solvatochromic effect and has interesting prospects in sensing ap- plications.

In 1, one WS4 2 ion chelates five Cu+ atoms in a square-pyramidal arrangement. A C2 axis passes through atoms Cu3 and W1 (Figure 1, top). The W···Cu distances are 2.689(1), 2.703(1), and 2.712(1) , Table 1.

Zheng et al. which are comparable to those in anionic–cationic cluster compounds.[13] Cu1 is tetrahedrally coordinated by two S atoms, one I ion, and one N atom of a dpmh ligand. Cu2 and Cu3 are all coordinated by two S atoms and two N atoms from dpmh ligands. As shown in Figure 1 (bottom), the dpmh ligands between two adjacent Va units form a pair with strong p–p interactions between pyridyl rings (3.697(1) ). We refer to the pair as a twin ligand because of their geometrical and topological identities; this twinned arrangement of ligands is rarely observed in other MOFs.[14] There are eight ligands around one Va unit, which form four dpmh twin ligands. The Va units, acting as distorted tetrahe- dral nodes, are linked with four Va units by four dpmh twin ligands into a diamondoid (dia) net (Figure 2). The W···W···W angles around one Va unit are in the range of 92.48(1)–137.50(1)8. The spacious nature of the single dia network allows three other identical networks to penetrate, resulting in a fourfold interpenetrating dia array (Figure 3). The adamantane cage is elongated along the a direction with maximum intracage dimensions of 51.500(4)36.658(3)38.717(3)  (between atom centers), corresponding to 4a2b2c. The interpene- tration vector of these four nets is the a axis. The interpene- tration mode of the four independent nets in 1 is the so- called normal mode, that is, the translation of 1/n times the length of the adamantane unit along the direction of the shared twofold axis corresponds to one of the unit-cell di- mensions.[15] Nanotubes are formed within the four dia nets along the a axis with a cross section of 6.66.6  when van der Waals radii are taken into consideration. Free I coun- terions and highly disordered solvent molecules reside in the tubes. The p–p interactions formed between twin ligands of the interpenetrated networks stabilize the overall nano- tubular architecture with average inter-twin-ligand distances of 3.948(1) , which are longer than the distance of the intra-twin-ligand p–p interaction (3.697(1) ). Crystal structure of 2: Compound 2 also contains a [WS4Cu5]3+ cluster cation, but as a new type of cluster unit. In contrast to the Va unit, the five Cu+ atoms in Vb are all in one plane with the W atom (Figure 4a, b). A mirror plane passes through atoms Cu3, S3, W1, S1, N2, and N3, which is normal to the plane formed by the five Cu+ atoms (Figure 4a); I3 is disordered between two positions by this mirror plane. Four Cu+ atoms are chelated by WS4 2, while Cu3 is coordinated by one S atom and bridged by two I atoms with two adjacent Cu+ atoms. The W1···Cu1 and W1···Cu2 distances of 2.706(1) and 2.698(1) , respectively, are comparable to those in the Va unit of 1, while the W1···Cu3 distance is much longer (4.181(3) ). The Cu1···Cu1A distance of 3.431(2)  is shorter than those of Cu2···Cu2A and Cu1···Cu2 (3.804(2) and 4.006(1) , respec- tively) due to the bridging coordination of the triazolate group of the ligand. The CuI bond lengths involving the bridging I atom (Cu2I2 2.659(2), Cu3I2 2.618(2) ) are longer than those involving the terminal I atom (Cu3I3= 2.514(1), Cu1I1=2.593(3) ). One Vb unit is coordinated by three dpta ligands acting as a T-shaped node, and the dpta ligand coordinates to three Vb units as a T-shaped linker. A two-dimensional brick-wall- like layer is formed by the Vb units and dpta ligands (Fig- ure 4c,d). Crystal structure of 3: One WS4 2 ion chelates four Cu+ atoms in a plenary configuration, forming a saddle-shaped IVa-type [WS4Cu4]2+ cluster unit, which can be described as a square-pyramidal Va cluster unit missing the axial Cu+ atom (Figure 5, left). The W···Cu distances of 2.688(1) and 2.707(1)  are comparable to those in the Va cluster unit in 1. Each Cu+ atom is tetrahedrally coordinated and has two coordination sites pointing outwards from the cluster unit. The eight peripheral sites of one IVa unit are occupied by two I and six dptz molecules, which form two single ligands and two twin ligands. The IVa units, acting as tetrahedral nodes, are linked by two twin ligands and two single ligands with four adjacent units into a dia network (Figure 5, right). The W···W···W angles around one IVa unit are in the range of 99.21(1)–119.32(1)8. Compound 3 consists of sixfold interpenetrating dia net- works, and square-shaped nanotubes are formed within these frameworks with an inner cross section of 5.45.3  when van der Waals radii are taken into consideration (Fig- Figure 2. The dia net of 1 (twinned dpmh ligands are represented by rods, and Va SBUs as tetrahedral nodes). Figure 3. Left: Nanotubular structure of 1 (H atoms and solvent guests are omitted for clarity). Right: Interpenetration of the four dia networks. Chem. Eur. J. 2012, 18, 2812 – 2824  2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 2815 FULL PAPER Metal–Organic Frameworks with [WS4Cux]x2 Units ure 6a). Since the size and shape of pores in the interpene- trating frameworks are related to the mode of interpenetra- tion,[16] a detailed analysis of 3 was performed. The six nets can be divided into two groups according to the symmetry relationship between nets. The nets in each group interpene- trate in the normal mode with the c axis as interpenetration vector, and the displacement vector between the two groups of nets is a/2+b/2=20.65 . According to Blatovs classifi- cation, which is mainly based on the symmetry relationships between the interpenetrating nets,[17] this [3+3] interpene- tration mode of 3 can be classified as Ib class [Z=6ACHTUNGTRENUNG(3*2)], which is a very rare type of interpenetration, with total cases amounting to less than 1.5% (calculated by us accord- ing to ref. [17]) of all the inter- penetrating metal–organic and inorganic networks. In 3, each tube is formed by six helical chains, which are constructed from the IVa unit and the single and twinned dptz ligands alternatingly with a helical pitch of 41.091(9) . The six helical chains in 3 are also in a [3+3] arrangement, as shown in Figure 6c and d. The square-shaped tube is formed at the overlapping part of the two groups of helical chains (Figure 6d). Strong C H···N hydrogen bonds are formed between the paired dptz ligands of the interpene- trated networks with average C···N distance of 3.291(2) , which stabilize the overall nanotubular architecture (Fig- ure 6b). Highly disordered DMF molecules reside in the tubes. Crystal structure of 4: The asymmetric unit of 4 contains one [WS4Cu4]2+ (IVb) unit, two tpt ligands, and one coordinated and one free I ions. The IVb unit has not been used in building MOFs as SBU before this case, and it can be described as a square-pyramidal Va cluster unit missing one Cu+ atom in the basal plane (Figure 7, top). The axial Cu1 atom has a longer distance to the central W atom (2.722(1) ) compared to those involv- ing the Cu+ atoms in the basal plane (av Cu···W 2.670(1) ). The Cu2 atom is coordinated by two S atoms and one I ion in a triangular coordination geometry. The other three Cu+ atoms are all coordinated by two S atoms and two N atoms of tpt ligands in tetrahedral coordination geometries. There are six tpt ligands around one IVb unit forming three pairs of tpt twin ligands with strong p–p inter- actions between the triazine rings (3.597(1) , Figure 7, middle). Therefore, the IVb SBU functions as a triangular node, and the tpt twin ligand as a triangular connector, giving rise to a three-dimensional framework with the over- all topology related to the SrSi2 [srs, (10,3)-a] net (Figure 7, bottom). Two srs networks are related by an inversion center. Large cages, with an inner diameter of about 11.0  when van der Waals radii are taken into consideration, are formed between the two frameworks (Figure 8a). Each framework forms a half-shell of the cage, which is defined by four IVb cluster units and three pairs of tpt twin ligands, as schemati- cally shown in Figure 8b. The cages exhibit face-centered distribution in the unit cell (Figure 8c).

The cages in the ab plane are con- nected by channels with a cross section of 3.23.8  when the van der Waals radii are considered, and two-dimensional pores are formed in the ab plane (Figure 8d). Crystal structure of 5: The asymmetric unit of 5 contains one [WS4Cu3]+ (IIIa) unit, one Cl atom, and two and a half dppz ligands. The [WS4Cu3]+ unit has three isomers (Table 1). In the IIIa unit, the WS4 2 ion chelates three Cu+ atoms, which are in the same plane with the W atom. The W···Cu distances in 5 are 2.632(2), 2.653(2), and 2.699(2)  (av 2.661 ). Cu1 and Cu2 are coordinated by two S atoms and two N atoms from dppz ligands in tetrahedral coordina- tion geometries, and Cu3 is coordinated by one Cl and two S atoms in a triangular coordination geometry. The two dppz ligands between two adjacent IIIa units also form a ligand pair, but the distance between the centers of the pi- perazine rings (4.728(1) ) is much longer than those within the twin ligands of 1, 3, and 4 because of the larger steric hindrance of the piperazine ring. The IIIa SBUs, acting as V- shaped nodes, are linked by paired and single ligands alter- nately into a zigzag chain with the terminally coordinated dppz ligands pendant on both sides of the chain (Figure 9).

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 2817 FULL PAPER Metal–Organic Frameworks with [WS4Cux]x2 Units Guest exchange and stabilities of the synthesized porous MOFs: Compounds 1, 3, and 4 all contain micropores within highly interpenetrated frameworks. The spaces occupied by solvent guests are 44.7, 29.4, and 28.0% of the total crystal volume in 1, 3, and 4, respectively, and hence we performed guest-exchange studies on these three compounds, and also tested the stability of their porous skeletons. The as-made compound 3DMF contains one-dimension- al channels of 5.45.3  with DMF as guests. The forces stabilizing the overall architecture are the aforementioned CH···N interactions between the interpenetrated frame- works. A thermogravimetric (TG) analysis showed that the DMF guests can be removed at 1008C. We placed crystals of 3DMF in the low-boiling point solvent CH3OH, and monitored exchange of DMF guests with CH3OH by means of the changes in IR spectra and TG results after 3 d. The disappearance of the strong peak at 1665 cm1 (C=O stretching band of DMF, Figure 10, top) indicated total ex- changing of DMF with CH3OH, and the CH3OH guests can be removed at a much lower temperature (608C, Figure 10, bottom), which confirms formation of new inclusion com- pound 3CH3OH. After removal of the solvent guests, the nanotubular architecture of 3 is stable up to 1708C (Figure 11, top). The crystal of 3CH3OH retains its single crystallinity when heated at 608C under vacuum for 10 h, and this enabled a crystal structure determination for desol- vated compound 3’. X-ray analysis revealed an intact nano- tubular skeleton, but the pore size had expanded slightly to 5.75.3  and the cell volume had increased by 1.5%. The CH···N hydrogen bonds between networks are weakened in 3’, with average C···N distance of 3.371(2) . The DMF guests can also be exchanged with other solvent molecules, such as C2H5OH, H2O, CHCl3, CH3CN, and ace- tone, forming other 3solvent inclusion compounds with un- changed host framework (Figure 11 bottom and Supporting Figure 8. a) The cage formed between two interpenetrated frameworks in 4. b) Schematic representation of one cage (the IVb SBUs are depicted as red balls and the tpt twin ligands as gray triangles.). c) The face-centered distribution of cages in the unit cell of 4. d) Schematic presentation of the cages (large light green balls) and small channels (semi-transparent light green pipes) between them; the IVb SBUs are depicted as small black balls and the tpt twin ligands as red or blue triangles.

The p–p interactions between dpmh twin ligands stabilize the overall architecture. A TG study showed that the highly dis- ordered solvent guests in as-made sample 1 (evacuation temperature: 1308C, Figure 12, top) can be exchanged with CH3OH solvent (evacuation temperature: 708C). However, XRD and N2 gas sorption data showed that the porous framework of 1 is not retained after removing solvent guests, probably because the p–p interactions are not strong enough to stabilize the porous architecture without solvent guests. Compound 4 contains two-dimensional pores with large round-shaped cages linked by small channels. The interac- tions between the two interpenetrating frameworks are the p–p interactions between the tpt twin ligands. From the point of view of crystal structure, the cages in 4 are large enough to incorporate many solvent guests, while the chan- nels between cages are small (cross section: 3.23.8  when the van der Waals radii are considered), and it is difficult for some large solvent molecules to pass through. The TG anal- ysis of the as-made sample shows that the weight loss of sol- vent guests involves two steps (Figure 12, bottom). Weight loss below 908C is fast, and should be ascribed to the small and volatile solvent guest CH3CN, which can pass through the small channels easily, and the weight loss from 90 to 3208C is slower, and may be ascribed to the loss of larger guests CHCl3 or the higher-boiling solvent DMF, which can hardly leave the cages without heating to higher tempera- ture. Compounds 1 and 4 lack stability or suitable pores for guest exchanges, while 3 is a stable porous material with suitable pore size, and also exhibits a rare solvatochromic effect on changing solvent guests.[19] Solvatochromism of 3: When the dark red as-made sample 3DMF was immersed in CH3CN or CHCl3, the resulting compound 3CH3CN changed to bright red color, while 3CHCl3 changed to totally black. With acetone, H2O, CH3OH, and C2H5OH, the resulting inclusion compounds change to different colors depending on the solvent guests included. The UV/Vis spectra and photographs of these in- clusion compounds are shown in Figure 13 (top), the UV/ Vis absorption bands are well consistent with their colors. On going from 3CH3CN to 3CHCl3, the absorption bands are redshifted by up to 245 nm with very high sensi- tivity to solvent guests. The bandgaps of the solvent-loaded compounds show excellent linear correlation with the polari- ty of the solvent guests (Reichardts EN T values,[20] Figure 13, bottom). The best fits of bandgaps against the EN T values are obtained by separately plotting nonhydroxylic solvents (slope 2.989, correlation coefficient 0.996) and hydroxylic solvents (slope 0.607, correlation coefficient 0.977). Such strong solvent dependence indicates that 3 can be a power- ful sensor for these solvents. With increasing of solvent Figure 11. Top: XRD of 3DMF before and after heating.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 2819 FULL PAPER Metal–Organic Frameworks with [WS4Cux]x2 Units guest polarity (CHCl3<…<CH3CN or C2H5OH<CH3OH <H2O), the absorption bands are blueshifted and show a negative solvatochromic effect, and the different response of 3 to hydroxylic and nonhydroxylic solvents should be as- cribed to the different hydrogen-bond donor abilities of these two kinds of solvents.[21] Solvatochromic porous MOFs are quite rare because of the challenge of generating both stable pores and solvato- chromism in a single material. In the reported cases, the sol- vatochromism originates from the d–d transitions of metal centers, and strong solvatochromism is always accompanied by large changes in the coordination sphere of metals and the overall structures of MOFs on changing solvent guests.[22,23] In the present case, the dptz ligand used is a sol- vatochromic compound which shows a negative solvatochro- mic effect in solution. To estimate the effect of the dptz ligand on the solvatochromic response of 3, comparative tests were performed with an analogous MOF, namely, {[(IVa)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy)4]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[(IVa)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpy)2I4]}n, (6, bpy=4,4’-bipyridine), which is similar to 3 in both structure and composition.[10] After the guest-exchange processes with the same solvents as used for 3, the colors and UV/Vis spectra of the obtained inclusion compounds 6solvent revealed no solvatochromic effect for 6 (see Supporting Information). Although the sol- vatochromism of 3 and the dptz ligand originate from differ- ent transitions (MLCT transition for 3 and p!p* transition for dptz), the result indicates that the dptz ligand plays an important role in the solvatochromic response of 3, which may be ascribed to its strong p-acceptor property and the la- bility of its electronic structure to solvent polarity.[24] Important synthesis parameters for [WS4Cux]x2-based MOFs from the one-step self-assembly method: Since the series of [WS4Cux]x2 units is characterized by their multi- formity in geometry and connectivity, it is helpful to under- stand which synthesis parameters have an important influ- ence on the [WS4Cux]x2 SBUs and the final MOFs. These parameters are mainly the ligand, the anion of the CuI salt, ratio of [NH4]2WS4 to CuI salt, temperature, and solvent. Since the formation of a MOF is always the cooperative result of these factors, the best strategy to evaluate the effect of a single factor is to change that factor and keep all others unchanged. To simplify the analysis processes, the ratio of [NH4]2WS4 to CuI salt was fixed to 1:4 in the synthe- sis of these five compounds, since reactions including degra- dation, expansion, or transformation would occur and form different kinds of cluster units in the one-step self-assembly process.[5a] Ligand: A special structural feature of [WS4Cux]x2-based MOFs is that the ligands are arranged in pairs. In the syn- thesis of 1, 3, and 5, the ligands are all linear bipyridyls with nearly identical lengths (dpmh: 11.3 , dptz: 11.1 , dppz: 11.1 ), the only difference in the ligands is the connecting groups between the two pyridine rings. From 1 to 3 and 5, with increasing ligand size, the paired ligands show longer intra-twin-ligand distances, the SBUs decrease from the hexaACHTUNGTRENUNGnuclear [WS4Cu5]3+ (Va) to pentanuclear [WS4Cu4]2+ (IVa) and to tetranuclear [WS4Cu3]+ (IIIa), and the number of ligands around each SBU decreases from eight dpmh to six dptz and to four dppz ligands. Of the three MOFs, 3 can be obtained under a wide range of conditions including those used to synthesize 1 or 5 (see Experimental Section), so the differences in [WS4Cux]x2 units between 1 and 3 and between 3 and 5 can mainly be ascribed to differences be- tween ligands. Clearly, the higher-nuclearity SBU has more coordination sites to bind more ligands, and these results imply that if a [WS4Cux]x2 unit has difficulty in accommo- dating a large number of ligands because of the large ligand size, it could reduce the number of Cu+ atoms to reduce the number of ligands and form an SBU with lower W/Cu ratio. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to consider that a “thin- ner” ligand could be advantageous for forming a MOF with higher-nuclearity [WS4Cux]x2 unit. Temperature: The temperatures for synthesizing the five complexes with the highest yields are reported in the Exper- imental Section. Formation of complexes 2, 4, and 5 is very sensitive to temperature, and when the temperature is changed by more than 158C, the desired compounds cannot be obtained as pure phases. An even more tempera- ture sensitive case is compound 1, which was synthesized at room temperature (about 258C). When the temperature was decreased to 58C, a totally crystalline different phase (named 1-Ix) was formed, as indicated by XRD patterns Figure 13.

In con- trast, compound 3 can be synthesized by diffuse reaction at 5–258C or by solvothermal reaction at 60–1208C. The MOFs based on IVa units make up a large proportion of the reported series of [WS4Cux]x2-based MOFs, a wide range of temperatures were reported for their synthesis, and IVa- based MOFs have also been obtained by using the two-step method with cluster compound [Et4N]4 4+ACHTUNGTRENUNG[WS4Cu4I6]4 as precursor,[10,11] probably because of the high stability of the IVa-type cluster unit. Anions: The anions of the CuI salts include halide and pseu- dohalide ions. However, pseudohalide ions such as CN and SCN are quite different from halide ions, because they have longer spans and stronger bridging coordination abili- ties, and should be treated as anionic bridging ligands rather than just counterions. Therefore, we only tested the effect of changing I, Br, and Cl in this work. In the synthesis of complexes 1–4, the CuI salts were changed from CuI to CuBr and then CuCl and all the other conditions were unchanged. In the case of 3, X-ray crystallo- graphic analysis revealed that the structures of the Br- and Cl-containing products 3-Br and 3-Cl are identical to that of 3, except for the bond lengths and angles, and the Br or Cl ions coordinate to the Cu+ atoms as terminal ligands and weakly interact with the dptz ligands by CH···Xhalide hydrogen bonding. Similar results were also observed for 1 and 4, for which XRD data showed unchanged framework structures on changing the halide ions (Figure 14). Compound 2 contains an unique [WS4Cu5]3+ (Vb) unit, in which one Cu+ ion has an unusual position relative to the W atom and unusual coordination environment involving one S atom, one terminal I ion, and two bridging I ions. It is of interest to find out the critical synthesis factor(s) for formation of this Vb unit, and the two bridging I atoms seem to play an important role in stabilizing the Cu+ ion with special position. Compound 2 was obtained with CuI and Et4NI as the sources of I, and many attempts without Et4NI or with Et4NI and CuI replaced by bromide or chlo- ride analogues did not afford the desired compound 2. This result shows that the presence and excess of I in the syn- thesis process are important for the formation of the Vb unit and compound 2, probably because of the stronger bridging abilities of the I ion compared to Br or Cl. The results of changing halide ions in the synthesis pro- cesses showed that the effect of halide ions is minor if they just function as counterions or are involved in weak interac- tions, but important if they are involved in strong bridging interactions. Conclusion We have described five MOFs formed by [WS4Cux]x2 SBUs and multi-pyridyl ligands. The [WS4Cux]x2 units function as network vertexes showing various geometries and connectiv- Figure 14. a) XRD spectra of 1-Ix, 1, 1-Br, and 1-Cl. b) Enlarged image of the XRD spectra of 1-Ix and 1. c) XRD of 3, 3-Br, and 3-Cl. d) XRD of 4, 4-Br, and 4-Cl.

The SBUs in 1 and 2 are isomeric hexanuclear [WS4Cu5]3+ units, the quadrangular pyramidal Va unit in 1 acts as a tetrahedral node, and the planar Vb unit in 2 is a new type of [WS4Cu5]3+ cluster unit and acts as a T-shaped connector. The SBUs in 3 and 4 are isomeric pentanuclear [WS4Cu4]2+ units, the saddle-shaped IVa unit in 3 acts as a tetrahedral node, and the IVb unit in 4 is observed in a MOF for the first time and acts as a triangular node. Com- pound 5 contains zigzag chains with tetranuclear [WS4Cu3]+ (IIIa) units acting as V-shaped nodes. The influence of synthesis conditions, including tempera- ture, ligand, halide ions of the CuI salts, and the ratio of [NH4]2WS4 to CuI salt on the structure and synthesis of the [WS4Cux]x2-based MOFs were briefly studied. In most cases, temperature and ligand are more important than the ratio of [NH4]2WS4 to CuI salt in synthesizing the [WS4Cux]x2-based MOFs, and the effect of changing halide ions is minor if they just func- tion as counterions or are in- volved in weak interactions, but important if they are in- volved in bridging interactions. Compounds 1, 3, and 4 all contain micropores within highly interpenetrated frame- works. Compounds 1 and 4 lack sufficient stability or suit- able pores for guest absorption or exchange, while 3 is a stable porous material with suitable pore size. When accommodat- ing different solvent molecules, 3 exhibits specific colors de- pending on the solvent incor- porated. Thus it shows a rare solvatochromic effect and has interesting prospects in sensing applications. Experimental Section General: [NH4]2WS4,[25] dpmh,[26] dpta,[27] dptz, tpt and dppz[28] were synthesized according to reported procedures. Other chemicals were ob- tained from commercial sources and used as received. Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic studies: Data were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex II CCD X-ray diffractometer at 291 K. Diffraction data collection and cell parameter re- finements were done by using SMART. Data reduction was per- formed with SAINT+, data were cor- rected for Lorentzian and polariza- tion effects, and absorption correction was done in multiscan mode with SADABS. The structure was solved by Patterson method and refined by full-matrix least-squares technique on F2 by using the SHELXTL software package. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters during the final cycles. Hydrogen atoms of ligands were calculated in ideal positions with iso- tropic displacement parameters. The solvent molecules in the structure were found to be highly disordered and were impossible to refine with conventional discrete-atom models. The diffuse electron densities result- ing from the residual solvent molecules were removed from the data set by using the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON and refined further using the data generated.[18] Crystallographic data are listed in Tables 2 and 3.

Thermogravimetric analysis: TG measurements were conducted on a TA-SDT 2960 with a heating rate of 108C min1 under a flow of nitro- gen. Powder X-ray diffraction: Powder XRD analysis was performed on a Philips X-pert X-ray diffractometer at a scanning rate of 48min1 in the 2q range from 5 to 608 with graphite-monochromatized CuKa radiation (l=1.5418 ). UV/Vis spectroscopy: UV/Vis spectra were collected on a UV-3600 spec- trophotometer working in diffuse-reflectance mode. The Kubelka–Munk equation was used to calculate absorption at the various wavelengths. From the absorption versus energy plot, the first derivative of the absorp- tion spectrum equation was calculated, and the inversion points were identified as bandgaps. Synthesis of 1: A solution of [NH4]2WS4 (0.1 mmol) and CuI (0.4 mmol) in DMF (10.0 mL) was stirred for 10 min. A portion of the solution (2.0 mL) was added at the bottom of a test tube, DMF:MeCN (4.0 mL, 1:1, v:v) as buffer layer, and a solution of dpmh (0.05 mmol) in MeCN (3.0 mL)on top. The test tube was sealed and allowed to stand at room temperature. After about 20 d, red prism crystals of 1 were collected, washed with DMF and MeCN, and dried in air at room temperature (yield: 30% based on ligand). The bromide and chloride analogues 1- Br and 1-Cl were synthesized with the same procedures except that the corresponding CuI salts were used. Synthesis of 2: A solution of [NH4]2WS4 (0.01 mmol), CuI (0.04 mmol), Et4NI (0.02 mmol), and dpta (0.02 mmol) in DMF (5.0 mL) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, heated at 908C for 1 d, and cooled to room temperature. A portion of the solution (3 mL) was placed in a test tube and diethyl ether (5.0 mL) was layered on top. The test tube was sealed and allowed to stand at room temperature. After about 10 d, red prism crystals were collected, washed with DMF and diethyl ether, and dried in air at room temperature (yield: 30% based on ligand). Synthesis of 3: Method A: A solution of [NH4]2WS4 (0.1 mmol), CuI (0.4 mmol,) and Et4NI (0.1 mmol) in in DMF (10.0 mL) was stirred for 10 min. A portion of the solution (3.0 mL) was layered on top of solution of dptz (0.05 mmol) in nitrobenzene (4.0 mL) in a test tube. The tube was sealed and allowed to stand at room temperature. After a month, dark red platelike crystals were collected, washed with DMF and diethyl ether, and dried in air at room temperature (yield: 80% based on ligand). Compound 3 can also be obtained under the synthesis conditions for 1 but in a lower yield of 50%). Method B: A solution of [NH4]2WS4 (0.05 mmol), CuI (0.20 mmol), and dptz (0.05 mmol) DMF:CH3CN (10 mL, 3:2, v:v) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 908C for 1 d and then cooled to room temperature. Small equal-sized crystals were obtained (yield: 70% based on ligand). The bromide and chloride analogues 3-Br and 3-Cl were synthesized with the same procedures except that the corresponding CuI salts were used. Synthesis of inclusion compounds 3solvent: As-made 3DMF was im- mersed in different solvents. The solvent was changed for fresh solvent every 12 h. Inclusion compounds 3solvent were obtained after 3 d. Synthesis of desolvated sample 3’: Crystals of CH3OH-exchanged 3CH3OH were prepared. The desolvated compound 3 was obtained by heating 3CH3OH at 608C under vacuum for 10 h. Synthesis of 4: A solution of [NH4]2WS4 (0.02 mmol), CuI (0.08 mmol), and tpt (0.01 mmol) in DMF:CH3CN:CHCl3 (5.0 mL, 3:1:1, v:v) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 758C for 1 d. Red octahedral crystals were obtained together with an orange precipi- tate. By washing with DMF several times and then diethyl ether a phase- pure sample was collected and dried in air at room temperature (yield: 55% based on ligand). The bromide and chloride analogues 4-Br and 4-Cl were synthesized with the same procedures except that the corre- sponding CuI salts were used. Synthesis of 5: A solution of [NH4]2WS4 (0.05 mmol), CuCl (0.20 mmol), and dppz (0.05 mmol) DMF:CH3CN (10 mL, 3:2, v:v) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 708C for 2 d and then cooled to room temperature. Small equal-sized crystals were obtained, washed with fresh DMF and then diethyl ether, and dried in air at room temperature (yield: 90% based on ligand).
