Compounds 1/2 and 3/4 were obtained by using the pH value and temperature as the only independent variable, respectively. Compound 1 possesses a (4,8)-connected net Introduction In the field of crystal engineering, coordination polymers (CPs) are extremely attractive because of their aesthetic architectures as well as their promising applications in areas such as luminescence, magnetism, catalysis, drug delivery, and so on.[1–4] Up to now, a number of CPs have been re- ported, and the research demonstrates that external stimuli such as pH value, solvent, temperature, and auxiliary ligand are effective for creating structural diversities and their structurally related properties.[5–8] Trigonal carboxylic acids, as a kind of classic tridentate ligand, are used widely owing to their sufficient coordinate sites and excellent angle orien- tation between carboxy groups.[9] Although a number of CPs with various structures have been prepared from trigo- nal carboxylic acids, systematic investigations on the exter- nal stimuli based on tricarboxylate ligands are still rare.[9e] It is well known that secondary building units (SBUs) such as dinuclear, trinuclear, tetranuclear, and octanuclear clusters play a great role in the syntheses of high-dimen- sional CPs.[10] Owing to its various coordination geome- [a] Key Lab of Polyoxometalate Science, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, People’s Republic of China E-mail: liuyy147@nenu.edu.cn majf247@yahoo.com http://pom.nenu.edu.cn/page/index.php [b] Department of Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Suihua University, Suihua 152061, People’s Republic of China Supporting information for this article is available on the WWW under http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejic.201402737.

Compound 3 displays a 4-nodal (3,4,7)-connected framework with 1D channels, whereas 4 reveals a (3,10)-connected net based upon trinuclear CoII clusters. The CO2-selective adsorption property of compound 3 was studied. In addition, the variable-temperature magnetic susceptibilities of compounds 1–4 were also investigated. tries, the CoII ion has been widely used to construct CPs based on SBUs.[7a,11] Up to now, many SBUs on the basis of diversified CoII clusters have been reported.[11] On the basis of the above considerations, we herein pres- ent a semirigid trigonal ligand, 5-(benzonic-4-ylmethoxy)- isophthalic acid (H3L), which can lead to diverse structures not only because of advantages of trigonal carboxylic acids but also because of the relative flexibility caused by the “–H2C–O–” spacer.[12] In addition, 1,2,4-triazole (Htrz) has been selected as an auxiliary ligand for its good coordina- tion ability and unique μ1,2,4-coordination mode.[13] Be- cause H3L and Htrz both possess favorable coordination sites, frameworks with several dimensions or special topologies might be obtained. Herein, four novel 3D CPs – namely, [Co2(L)(OH)(H2O)]· 1.5H2O (1), [Co(HL)(H2O)] (2), [Co4(HL)(L)(trz)3(H2O)]· 6H2O (3), and [Co3(HL)2(trz)2(H2O)2] (4) – have been successfully synthesized by changes in the reaction condi- tions (Scheme 1). The effects of pH value, reaction tempera- Scheme 1. Syntheses of compounds 1–4. www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER ture, and auxiliary ligand on the final structures are dis- cussed. Remarkably, compound 3 reveals CO2-selective ad- sorption behavior. In addition, the magnetic properties of compounds 1–4 have also been investigated. Results and Discussion The synthetic strategy is schematically depicted in Scheme 1. The topologies of compounds 1–4 were analyzed by using the OLEX program.[14] Structure of [Co2(L)(OH)(H2O)]·1.5H2O (1) In compound 1, the asymmetric unit contains two CoII cations, one L3– anion, one hydroxy group, and two-and-a- half water molecules (Figure 1, a). Co1 is five-coordinate in a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry, whereas Co2 is surrounded by six oxygen atoms in a distorted octahedral sphere. Interestingly, Co1, Co2, and their symmetry-related ones are bridged by two μ3-carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1) and two μ3-OH groups (O8) to form a tetranuclear CoII cluster (Figure 1, b). L3– anions adopt μ7-η1:η1:η2:η1:η1:η1 coordination modes (mode I in Scheme S1 of the Support- ing Information) and link the [Co4] clusters to give rise to a 3D framework (Figure 1, c). Topologically, the [Co4] cluster could be considered an 8- connected node, and the L3– anion could be simplified as a 4-connected node. In this way, the 3D framework can be simplified as a (4,8)-connected net with (46)(412·612·84) top- ology (Figure 1, d). Additionally, 1D channels are generated and completely filled with guest H2O molecules (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Structure of [Co(HL)(H2O)] (2) As shown in Figure 2 (a), the asymmetric unit contains one CoII ion, one HL2– anion, and one coordinated water molecule. Co1 is surrounded by six oxygen atoms in a dis- torted octahedral coordination geometry. Symmetrical ex- pansion of Co1 yields a [Co2] unit (Figure 2, b). Each [Co2] unit is connected with six HL2– anions, whereas each HL2– with μ4-η0:η1:η1:η1:η1:η1 coordination mode is surrounded by three [Co2] units (mode II in Scheme S1 of the Support- ing Information). In this manner, a 3D framework is formed (Figure 2, b). If HL2– anions and [Co2] units are viewed as 3- and 6-connected nodes, respectively, the whole 3D framework can be simplified as a (3,6)-connected net with (4·82)(42·73·83·93·102·112) topology (Figure 2, c). Structure of [Co4(HL)(L)(trz)3(H2O)]·6H2O (3) In compound 3, the asymmetric unit consists of four CoII ions, one HL2–, one L3–, one coordinated water, and six lattice water molecules (Figure 3a). The number of lattice H2O molecules was calculated by means of thermogravime- tric analyses and elemental analysis, and the SQUEEZE Eur. J. Inorg.

Notably, carboxylate anions HL2– and L3– also exhibit two different coordination modes: μ4- η0:η1:η1:η1:η1:η0 and μ5-η0:η1:η1:η1:η1:η2 (modes III and IV in Scheme S1 of the Supporting Information). In this way, Co1, Co2, and Co3 are linked together to form a [Co3] www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER Figure 2. (a) The coordination geometry of the CoII ion in 2.

[Co3] groups and Co4 ions are further fitted by trz– anions to generate a chain (Figure 3b). The carboxylate anions connect the neighboring chains to yield a 3D frame- work with channels (Figures S2 and S3). The accessible void was calculated by PLATON to be about 29.9%.[15] If carboxylate anions, Co4 ions, and [Co3] units are viewed as 3-, 4-, and 7-connected nodes, respectively, topological analysis reveals that the 3D framework can be symbolized as a 4-nodal (3,4,7)-connected net with (4·5·7)2- (42·5·62·7)(47·53·68·73) topology (Figure 3, c and d). Structure of [Co3(HL)2(trz)2(H2O)2] (4) Compound 4 contains one-and-a-half CoII ions, one HL2– anion, one trz– anion, and one coordinated water molecule (Figure 4, a). Both Co1 and Co2 are six-coordi- nate in [N2O4] octahedral coordination environments. Co1 lies on an inversion center. One Co1 and two Co2 ions are Eur. J. Inorg.

KGaA, Weinheim 6208 nects six HL2– anions and four [Co3] clusters, so it can be considered a 10-connected node. Therefore, the 3D frame- work can be symbolized as a (3,10)-connected net with (3·4·5)(34·46·518·614·72·8) topology (Figure 4, c). Effects of pH Value, Reaction Temperature, and Htra on the Structures of 1–4 By comparing the structures of 1–4, we can see that pH value, reaction temperature, and auxiliary ligand play pivotal roles in the synthesis. Compounds 1 and 2 show the effects of pH value on the final structures. The final mixture pH values of 1 and 2 were about 7.5 and 6.0, respectively. As a result, the carboxylic groups in the two compounds display fully and partially deprotonated patterns of L2– and HL2–, respectively. This leads to the different coordination modes of the anions, the formation of a tetranuclear CoII cluster and binuclear CoII unit, and different final frame- works of 1 and 2. Compounds 3 and 4 were obtained under similar reac- tions at different reaction temperatures. At higher tempera- ture, the carboxylate anions in 3 display two kinds of coor- dination modes (HL2– in mode III, and L3– in mode IV), whereas in 4, there is only one form coordination fashion (HL2– in mode III). This results in the different coordina- tion modes of the CoII ion and different frameworks of 3 and 4. In addition, the auxiliary ligand has an effect on the con- struction of the frameworks. The synthesis of 3 was similar to that of 1 except that Htrz was introduced. Compound 3 displays a more complicated network, and its topology has a higher number of nodes. Thermal Analyses Thermal analyses were measured to estimate the thermal stabilities of compounds 1–4 (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information), and detailed descriptions are given in the Supporting Information. Sorption Properties Compound 3 has potential channels, so the sample was soaked in methanol for three days and then evacuated at 100 °C for five hours to obtain the activated sample 3.[16] The sorption properties of 3 for N2 and CO2 were mea- sured under different experimental conditions. As shown in Figure 5 (a), compound 3 hardly adsorbs N2, but it does adsorb a significant amount of CO2 at 273 K (48.5 cm3g–1) and 298 K (36.7 cm3g–1). The calculated CO2/N2 selectivity of 3 is approximately 17 at 273 K and 20 at 293 K, respec- tively.[16a] This selectivity is normal relative to other CPs.[17] To further study the cyclability of the CO2-sorption prop- erty, the CO2 isotherms were carried out for three cycles at 298 K with 3 without reactivation (Figure 5, b). Only a slight decrease in the CO2-sorption amount was observed. www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER Figure 5. (a) CO2 (: 273 K; : 298 K) and N2 (♦: 273 K; : 298 K) sorption isotherms under different temperatures. (b) Three cycles of CO2 uptake at 298 K. There are also potential channels in compound 1. How- ever, compound 1 did not absorb N2 and CO2. It suggests that the introduction of an auxiliary ligand has a positive impact on the gas uptake. The first reason perhaps lies in the solvent-accessible volumes of the compounds. PLA- TON calculations reveal that the solvent-accessible volume in 1 is approximately 138.3 Å3 (15.8% of the unit-cell vol- ume), which is much less than that of 767.1 Å3 in 3 (29.9% of the unit-cell volume).[15] The auxiliary ligand might pro- mote the stability of the channel of the framework. Another reason might lie in the presence of electron-rich trz– ligands, which make the channels polar and generate an electric field that interacts with quadrupole molecules. According to the related literature, the electric quadrupole interaction be- tween the framework and CO2 is stronger than that of N2, which improves the selective adsorption capacity of CO2.[11d,11f] Magnetic Properties Magnetic measurements were carried out on pure samples confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2014, 6205–6211 © 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 6209 Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). The magnetic susceptibilities of 1–4 were collected with an applied field of 1000 Oe in the temperature range of 2–300 K. The χm–1, χmT, and χm versus T plots are shown in Figure 6 (see also Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). Figure 6. Temperature dependence of χm–1 and χmT versus T plots for 1–4. For [Co2(L)(OH)(H2O)]·1.5H2O (1), the χmT value for the [Co4] cluster at 300 K is 11.9 cm3Kmol–1, which is much higher than the spin-only value of 7.5 cm3Kmol–1 of four isolated CoII (S = 3/2 and g = 2.0). Upon cooling, the χmT value declines and reaches 0.4 cm3Kmol–1. The χm–1 versus T plots above 50 K following the Curie–Weiss law give C = 13.2 cm3Kmol–1 and θ = –26.8 K. For [Co(HL)(H2O)] (2), the χmT value for one CoII ion at 300 K is 2.7 cm3Kmol–1, which is also higher than the value of 1.9 cm3Kmol–1 for one isolated CoII (S = 3/2 and g = 2.0), and the χmT value at 2 K is 2.0 cm3Kmol–1. The χm–1 versus T plots is fitted to the Curie–Weiss law from 50 to 300 K, which gives C = 2.8 cm3Kmol–1 and θ = –5.1 K. For [Co4(HL)(L)(trz)3(H2O)]·6H2O (3), the χmT values for one CoII ion decrease from 2.6 cm3Kmol–1 at 300 K to 0.29 cm3Kmol–1 at 2 K. The maximum χmT value at 300 K is higher than the value of 1.9 cm3Kmol–1 for one isolated CoII (S = 3/2 and g = 2.0). The magnetic susceptibility above 50 K can be satisfactorily fit to the Curie–Weiss law with C = 2.7 cm3Kmol–1 and θ = –12.0 K. And for [Co3(HL)2(trz)2(H2O)2] (4), at 300 K, the χmT value for the [Co3] cluster is 8.8 cm3Kmol–1, which is higher than the spin-only value of 5.6 cm3Kmol–1 for three CoII ions with a spin value of 3/2 and a Lande g value 2.0. The χmT value decreases to reach 1.3 cm3Kmol–1 at the lowest measured temperature (2 K). The χm–1 versus T plot is described by the Curie–Weiss law with C = 9.8 cm3Kmol–1 and θ = –29.0 K. As above, the χmT values of 1–4 are higher than the corresponding spin-only values, which might be due to a possible orbital contribution.[12c,18] The θ values of 1–4 are negative, which indicates antiferromagnetic interactions be- tween the CoII ions.[12d,19] For compound 1, the magnetic susceptibility has a sharp maximum around 24 K, which also suggests antiferromagnetic ordering under 1000 Oe.[11b] www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER Table 1.

All of them demon- strate fascinating topological structures. The result deter- mines the influences of pH value, reaction temperature, and the auxiliary ligand on the formation of CPs. Compound 3 reveals temperature-dependent CO2-sorption behaviors and high CO2 selectivity over N2, which reveals that an N-rich ligand could improve the selective capacity of CO2 adsorp- tion. The variable-temperature magnetic studies indicate antiferromagnetic behaviors of compounds 1–4.

The C, H and N elemental analyses were measured on a Perkin–Elmer 2400 elemental analyzer. IR-spectra were carried out on a Mattson Alpha-Centauri spectrometer at the range of 4000–400 cm–1. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer TG-7 analyzer heated from room temperature to 600 °C under nitrogen. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility data were obtained using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS-5) with an applied field of 1000 Oe in the temperature range of 2-300 K. The gas adsorption-desorption experiments were performed on automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (V-Sorb 2800S). X-ray crystallography Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for 1-4 were recorded on an Oxford Gemini R Ultra diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K. All the structures were solved by Direct Method of SHELXS-97 and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques using the SHELXL-97 program within WINGX.[1] Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms were located at their calculated positions. Some solvent hydrogen atoms in compound 1 were not included in the model. The SQUEEZE function in PLATON was applied to remove residual electron density which could not sensibly modeled as solvents or anions.[2] References [1] a) G. M.

View of the 1D channel in 3. Thermal Analyses. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C/min to investigate the thermal stabilities of compounds 1-4 (Figure S3). For compound 1, the TG curve displays the first weight loss of 8.67% from room temperature to 115 °C, which is attributed to the release of water molecules (calcd 9.12%). Decomposition of the residual composition occurs from 310 °C to 470 °C, leading to the formation of Co2O3 as the residue (obsd 33.68%, calcd 33.63%). For compound 2, the weight loss corresponding to the release of coordinated water molecules is observed at 250 °C (obsd 4.56%, calcd 4.60%). Further heating results to the decomposition of the organic composition. The remaining residue is 22.05%, corresponds to the formation of Co2O3 (calcd 21.20%). For compound 3, the weight loss of 8.54% from rt to 135 °C is due to the loss of gust water molecules (calcd 9.05%), and the organic components decompose from 320 °C to 460 °C, leading to the formation of Co2O3 as the residue (obsd 28.87%, calcd 27.79%). For compound 4, the first weight loss from 215 °C to 250 °C is consistent with the loss of coordinated water molecules (obsd 3.61%, calcd 3.68%). The second weight loss from 320 °C to 460 °C is due to the collapse of the framework. The remaining residue corresponds to the formation of Co2O3 (obsd 26.23%, calcd 25.45%). Figure S4.
