Manuscript Deep-Eutectic Solvents DOI: 10.1002/anie.200900134 Versatile Structure-Directing Roles of Deep-Eutectic Solvents and Their Implication in the Generation of Porosity and Open Metal Sites for Gas Storage** Jian Zhang, Tao Wu, Shumei Chen, Pingyun Feng, and Xianhui Bu* Because of the unique integration of various properties such as excellent solvating properties, wide reaction temperature ranges, nonvolatility, and high thermal stability, ionic liquids have attracted increasing attention as solvents of choice for chemical synthesis.[1] In the past several years, the synthetic success using the ionothermal method has opened up a new route for the creation of novel inorganic and metal–organic framework materials.[2–7] Recently, Morris and Parnham reviewed this burgeoning area.[2b,h] Some ionic liquids (ILs) such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimida- zolium bromide are ionic compounds.[6] In addition to their solvent properties, the cations and anions of such ionic liquids can influence the synthetic process through direct incorpo- ration (either individually or in combination) into crystal structures.[7] There is also another type of ionic liquids: deep-eutectic solvents (DESs). Unlike ILs, DESs are mixtures for which the freezing point is lower than that of either of its two individual components. A DES consists of an ionic compound and a molecular compound. Examples of DESs include mixtures of quaternary ammonium salts (e.g., choline chloride) with neutral organic hydrogen-bond donors (such as amides, amines, and carboxylic acids).[5,8] As ionic liquids, DESs share many characteristics of conventional ILs. Furthermore, one advantage of DESs such as choline chloride/urea (or its derivatives) is their low cost, which makes DESs particularly desirable for applications in the large-scale synthesis of new functional materials. As mixtures, DESs (three-component systems with cat- ions, anions, and neutral ligands) are more complicated than ILs (two-component systems with anions and cations). In addition to cations and anions, DESs also contain neutral ligand molecules such as urea that can exert structure- directing effects. In this sense, DESs possess features of both ILs and molecular solvents. Each of the three individual DES components has the potential to participate in the self- assembly process, either individually or in combination with another component, making it possible to create new types of chemistry that are not accessible in either ILs or molecular solvents. We are especially interested in DESs because they provide a unique route for the creation of porosity and coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, which have been shown to be desirable for enhancing gas-storage capacity and for promoting catalytic activity.[3,9] These properties stem from the strong tendency of the neutral ligand, which is an inherent part of the solvent, to bind to metal sites. Upon removal of such neutral ligands, both porosity and open metal sites can be created. Furthermore, as shown herein, the DES is recyclable, because the neutral ligand that serves as the template to generate porosity and open metal sites can be completely recovered through crystallization immediately after its removal from the pore. This recyclability represents an additional advantage of the method reported herein. Prior to this work, DESs were shown to be effective solvents and structure-directing agents (SDAs) in the syn- thesis of a number of materials, generally with inorganic frameworks, such as various metal phosphates and phospho- nates.[2e,f] Of particular interest is the recent demonstration by Morris and co-workers that unstable DESs can serve as template-delivery agents through decomposition.[2f] For example, 2-imidazolidinone (ethyleneurea) can decompose to deliver ethylenediamine, which in the protonated form can direct the formation of zeolite-type metal phosphates. In comparison, there has been relatively limited research on the use of DESs for the synthesis of metal–organic framework materials.[5] Because the reaction temperature used for the synthesis of metal–organic framework materials is usually lower than that used for the synthesis of inorganic frame- works (e.g., phosphates), we anticipate that DESs would be less likely to decompose and could therefore exert structure- directing effects that differ from those observed in the synthesis of metal phosphates.[2f] Herein, we report a series of metal–organic frameworks synthesized using three deep-eutectic solvents (Scheme 1a). The self-assembly of the trivalent metals (In3+, Y3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Gd3+, Dy3+, Ho3+, and Yb3+), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (bdc), and one or two components of a DES generates ten different materials in six distinct framework topologies (Table 1). Of particular interest is the demonstration of the versatile structure-directing roles of DESs (Scheme 1b and Figure 1) [*] Dr. J. Zhang, Dr. S. Chen, Prof. Dr. X.

The first role, observed in compound 1, is the incorporation of both cations and anions. In 1, cationic choline ions act as extraframework SDAs while the Cl ions are bound to the polymeric layers (Scheme 1b, Figure 1a). In the second and third roles, cations and neutral ligands are incorporated into the structures. The incorporation of cations and neutral ligands results from the combined effect of the ionic compound and the neutral molecule in the DES. The second role is observed in three isostructural compounds 2, 2a, and 2b, in which choline ions perform the same role as in compound 1 (i.e., as extraframework SDAs). However, neutral urea molecules (instead of Cl in compound 1) are bonded to the framework (Scheme 1b, Figure 1b). The third role, observed in compound 3, is in fact the reverse of the second role, because choline ions are bonded to the framework through their OH groups, while the neutral m- urea molecules serve as extraframework SDAs (Scheme 1b, Figure 1c). Finally, the fourth role, observed in compounds 4– 6, is the direct bonding of neutral m-urea or e-urea to the polymeric framework (Scheme 1b, Figure 1d–f). Of these materials, 5, 5a, and 5b are most closely related to the four- connected silica-type structures, because they possess mogan- ite-type topology. It is worth noting that nine out of ten materials reported herein contain the neutral DES component (urea, m-urea, or e-urea). This finding underlines the strong tendency for the incorporation of neutral ligands when the synthesis is performed in a DES. This incorporation forms the basis for the creation of porosity and open metal sites. Compound 1 exhibits a 2D anionic (6,3) layer [{InCl- (bdc)3/2(H2O)2}n]n, and the guest choline ions are located in the 1D channel (along the c axis) formed from adjacent layers by hydrogen-bonding interactions (Figure S1 in Supporting information). Compounds 2, 2a, and 2b are isostructural, and all of them exhibit similar 3D anionic frameworks that are charge- balanced by guest choline cations. In 2, three independent bdc ligands adopt two coordination modes (Scheme 2a,c). The urea ligand uses the O donor to coordinate to the Yb3+ site, and its two amino groups form NH···O hydrogen bonds with the adjacent bdc ligands (Figure 1b). Each eight-coordinate Yb3+ site is connected by two m2-bdc ligands and three m3-bdc ligands, resulting in the formation of a 3D framework with large 1D channels along the b axis (Figure 2a). The quad- rangular channel with dimension of 10.89  14.85 2 is filled with guest choline cations.

KGaA, Weinheim www.angewandte.org the three-connected nodes and the Yb3+ sites as the five- connected nodes, the anionic framework of 2 can be represented as a (3,5)-connected net with the Schlfli symbol (42.65.83)(42.6).[10] Compared to the anionic frameworks of compounds 1, 2, 2a, and 2b prepared from the choline chloride/urea DES, compounds 3–6 were made using DESs containing the larger urea derivatives (m-urea and e-urea) and have neutral frameworks. The most unusual feature of compound 3 is that the positively charged choline ion serves as a ligand bonded to a metal cation, while neutral m-urea acts as an extraframework template. Such a reversal of roles (cf. compound 2) between the neutral urea-type ligand and the choline cation is quite unusual. Compound 3 features an eight-connected CsCl-type network based on dinuclear Nd3+ units. The bdc ligands adopt three different coordination fashions (Scheme 2a,d,e) to link the dinuclear Nd3+ units. Each Nd3+ ion is nine-coordinate, bound by eight O atoms from six bdc ligands and one O atom from the choline ion (Figure 1c). Each dinuclear Nd3+ unit is connected to eight adjacent dinuclear Nd3+ units by eight bdc ligands, resulting in an eight-connected framework with 1D channels filled with the guest m-urea molecules and dangling choline ions (Figure 2b). Compound 4 is also synthesized using the choline chloride/m-urea DES. However, in contrast to 3, only m- urea from the DES is included in the crystal. In 4, each dinuclear Gd3+ unit is bound by four m-urea ligands and six bdc ligands with two types of coordination (Figure 1d, Scheme 2a,f). The connectivity between the dinuclear Gd3+ units and the bdc ligands generates a neutral six-connected (3,6)-sheet (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The use of e-urea leads to a distinct neutral 3D framework 5, also with only the neutral ligand, as in 4. Three independent bdc ligands in 5 adopt two coordination geometries (Scheme 2a,f), and all are related by inversion. Each Yb3+ site in 5 acts as a four-connected node (Figure 1e) and is connected by four bdc ligands into a 3D framework with large 1D channels along the a axis (Figure 2c). By considering the m4-bdc ligands as the planar four-connected nodes, the frame- work of 5 can be represented as the four-connected moganite (denoted: mog) net. Thus, the use of DESs provides an alternative path for constructing low-connectivity frame- works from metal centers with high coordination numbers. The replacement of Yb(NO3)3·xH2O by Dy(NO3)3·xH2O or Ho(NO3)3·xH2O allows the preparation of the isostructural compounds 5a and 5b, respectively. On the other hand, the use of Sm(NO3)3·xH2O under similar conditions gives a distinct structure 6. The observation of two different struc- tures (compound 5 from Yb3+ and compound 6 from Sm3+) using the DES with e-urea is in distinct contrast to isostruc- tural compounds 2 (Yb3+) and 2a (Sm3+), thus demonstrating that the nature of the DES plays an important role in the self- assembly process. The e-urea ligand in 6 adopts a m2-bridging mode, and two e-urea ligands doubly link two symmetry-related eight- coordinate Sm3+ sites with a Sm···Sm distance of 3.959 . Each Sm3+ site is bonded to six O atoms from six bdc ligands and two O atoms from two e-urea ligands (Figure 1 f). The SmO bonds (2.533 and 2.607 ) between Sm and the e-urea ligand are longer than those between Sm and the bdc ligand (average 2.391 ). The carboxylate groups of the bdc ligands exhibit the same m2-bridging coordination (Scheme 2 f) and connect Sm3+ sites into a chain along the c axis. Two O donors of two e-urea ligands complete two sites of the half-paddle- wheel dinuclear unit. Each carboxylate-bridged Sm chain is further linked to six neighboring chains by the bdc ligands to generate a 3D neutral framework (Figure 2d). The frame- work topology can be represented as a (4,6)-connected net by reducing the bdc ligand as the planar four-connected node and each Sm3+ site as a six-connected node. The Schlfli symbol of this three-nodal (4,6)-connected net is (42.63.8)- (43.63)2(48.66.8)2.[10] Compound 6 has a very high thermal stability and was selected to demonstrate the porosity and gas-storage proper- ties of materials accessible through synthesis in DESs. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of 6 indicates that the first weight loss of 17.7% between 250 and 3008C corre- sponds to the full liberation of e-urea molecules (without Scheme 2.

Ed. 2009, 48, 3486 –3490 decomposition; calcd: 17.8%), and the remaining framework [{Sm(bdc)3/2}n] shows no weight loss up to 5258C. Powder X-ray diffraction further confirms that the frame- work [{Sm(bdc)3/2}n] does not change after the removal of the e-urea ligands at 3008C (the degas temperature), and the total solvent-accessible volume is estimated to be 36.0% using the PLATON program.[11] It is worth noting that the departure of the m2-e-urea ligand leaves two neighboring open Sm sites (Figure 3a). The e-urea that escaped from the pores under the degas conditions crystallized at the cold end of the sample tube.[12] This finding suggests that the ligand is completely recyclable. Gas adsorption measurements (N2, CO2, and H2) were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 surface-area and pore-size analyzer, which confirmed the permanent micro- porosity of 6. The sample was degassed at 3008C prior to the measurement. The N2 adsorption/desorption study reveals a reversible type I isotherm, indicating that 6 is microporous (Figure 3b). The BET and Langmuir surface areas are 186.3 and 261.5 m2g, respectively. A diameter of 8.0  was also calculated. The CO2 adsorption isotherm of 6 at 273 K exhibits the adsorption of 26.8 cm3g1 at approximately 1 atm (Figure 3c). It is worth noting that increased uptake is accompanied by an increase in pressure, and the adsorption capacity does not saturate at 1 atm. Therefore, the uptake of CO2 is expected to continue to increase at higher pressure. The H2 adsorption isotherm of 6 indicates an uptake of 74.9 cm3g1 (0.66 wt%) at 77 K and 1 atm (Figure 3d). Similar to the adsorption of CO2, the hydrogen adsorption isotherm does not reach a plateau at 1 atm. Thus, a higher hydrogen uptake is expected under higher pressures. Although the hydrogen uptake is lower than those reported for many other porous frameworks, the use of a DES to generate porosity and free metal sites represents a new approach for the creation of porous metal–organic frame- works with potential applications in gas storage. In summary, we report herein four different structure- directing roles of deep-eutectic solvents, leading to ten different materials with six distinct topologies. Using com- pound 6, we demonstrate the high thermal stability, perma- nent porosity, and promising gas-storage capabilities of such materials. The synthetic method described herein provides a versatile path for the creation of porosity and open metal sites, thus allowing the synthesis of porous materials with potential applications in gas storage and catalysis. Also worth noting is the role of urea-type ligands, in this case e-urea, which acts as a template for framework formation and yet can leave the pore without any decomposition, leaving behind permanent porosity and open metal sites. Experimental Section The deep-eutectic solvents (choline chloride/urea, choline chlor ide/m-urea, and choline chloride/e-urea) were synthesized by heating a mixture of choline chloride and the urea compound in a 1:2 ratio at 1208C for 20 min. 1: 1,4-Benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2bdc, 0.0887 g, 0.53 mmol), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO, 0.0622 g, 0.55 mmol), and In(NO3)3·xH2O (0.0846 g, 0.21 mmol) in choline chloride/urea (2.03 g) were placed in a 20 mL vial. The sample was heated at 1208C for 5 days and then cooled to room temperature. After washing with ethanol and distilled water, colorless crystals of 1 were obtained. 2: H2bdc (0.0943 g, 0.57 mmol), DABCO (0.0747 g, 0.67 mmol), and Yb(NO3)3·xH2O (0.1108 g, 0.24 mmol) in choline chloride/urea (2.172 g) were placed in a 20 mL vial. The sample was heated at 1208C for 5 days and then cooled to room temperature. After washing with ethanol and distilled water, colorless crystals of 2 were obtained. Compounds 2a and 2b can be obtained under similar conditions using Sm(NO3)3·xH2O (0.1289 g, 0.29 mmol) or Y(NO3)3·xH2O (0.0982 g, 0.26 mmol) instead of Yb(NO3)3·xH2O. 3: H2bdc (0.087 g, 0.52 mmol), DABCO (0.071 g, 0.66 mmol), and Nd(NO3)3·xH2O (0.101 g, 0.23 mmol) in choline chloride/m-urea (2.30 g) were placed in a 20 mL vial. The sample was heated at 1408C for 6 days and then cooled to room temperature. After washing with ethanol and distilled water, colorless crystals of 3 were obtained. 4: H2bdc (0.083 g, 0.50 mmol), DABCO (0.060 g, 0.51 mmol), and Gd(NO3)3·xH2O (0.115 g, 0.24 mmol) in choline chloride/e-urea (2.30 g) were placed in a 20 mL vial. The sample was heated at 1408C for 6 days and then cooled to room temperature. After washing with ethanol and distilled water, colorless crystals of 4 were obtained. 5: H2bdc (0.0883 g, 0.53 mmol), DABCO (0.0724 g, 0.66 mmol), and Yb(NO3)3·xH2O (0.1118 g, 0.24 mmol) in choline chloride/ e-urea (2.20 g) were placed in a 20 mL vial. The sample was heated at 1208C for 4 days and then cooled to room temperature. After washing with ethanol and distilled water, colorless crystals of 5 were obtained. Compounds 5a and 5b can be obtained under similar conditions by using Dy(NO3)3·xH2O (0.1102 g, 0.23 mmol) or Ho- (NO3)3·xH2O (0.1232 g, 0.24 mmol) instead of Yb(NO3)3·xH2O. 6: H2bdc (0.1601 g, 0.99 mmol), DABCO (0.0980 g, 0.84 mmol), and Sm(NO3)3·xH2O (0.1922 g, 0.46 mmol) in choline chloride/ e-urea (3.50 g) were placed in a 20 mL vial. The sample was heated at 1408C for 5 days and then cooled to room temperature. After washing with ethanol and distilled water, colorless crystals of 6 were obtained (0.195 g, 0.41 mmol, 88%).
