Enrique Oltra, Valentina Colombo, Angelo Maspero, Norberto Masciocchi, Simona Galli, Irena Senkovska, Stefan Kaskel, Elisa Barea,* and Jorge A. R. Navarro* The release of toxic pollutants into the environment, which includes oil spills, leaks of harmful industrial products, and the deliberate emission of chemical warfare agents is a risk of growing concern. Worthy of note, oil spill cleanups amount to over 10 billion dollars annually.[1] Remediation of these environmental problems involves the use of large amounts of adsorbents such as sand, activated carbons, or zeolites.[2] However, the effectiveness of such adsorbents is often limited by their affinity to moisture. Consequently, the search for highly hydrophobic porous materials to be used as suitable stopgap of harmful organics spills has become of paramount importance. In the past years, porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively studied to explore their possible applications in near future technologies for the safe storage of energetically and environmentally relevant gases.[3,4] The tunable nature of their pores might be beneficial also in cushioning environmental problems caused by the release of harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs).[5] A remarkable example of the design amenability of MOFs is the well-known isoreticular [Zn4OL3] series (L = arene-dicarbox- ylate), wherein the size and the functionality of the pores can be modulated in a highly rational and systematic way.[6,7] Nevertheless, the advantageous structural features of this family of MOFs are readily hampered by its high sensitivity to moisture, which limits its practical applications.[8] A similar size-scaling approach has been applied by Lillerud and co- workers on the isoreticular [Zr6O4(OH)4L6] series,[9] evidenc- ing that a significant improvement in the stability of the material can be achieved with an appropriate combination of dicarboxylate linkers and oxophylic metal fragments.[9] Alter- nately, it is possible to take advantage of the enhanced stability imparted by polyazolate-containing ligands in com- bination with borderline metal ions.[10,11] Accordingly, we designed and isolated an isoreticular series of porous MOFs, the pore size and polarity of which was modulated by coupling stiff bi-pyrazolate or mixed pyrazolate/carboxylate linkers (Scheme 1) to NiII hydroxo clusters acting as 12-connected nodes. This combination yielded the series of [Ni8(OH)4- (H2O)2(L)6]n MOFs (shortened as [Ni8(L)6]), exhibiting highly porous 3D networks analogous to those recently reported by us (Figure 1).[12,13] Noteworthy, no interpenetration occurred for any of the isolated solids which, therefore, do not suffer from a reduction in the accessibility of voids, as found for some MOFs containing dicarboxylate linkers in primitive cubic lattices,[14] or featuring extremely long (> 2 nm) spacers, in the less common Fd3m space group.[15] In the following, the synthesis, structural and textural characterization of the [Ni8(L)6] isoreticular series are pre- Scheme 1.

To facilitate the precipitation of powders with a high degree of crystallinity, Boc-protected pyrazole rings were employed in the case of the bipyrazole linkers (Boc2L4, Boc2L5-R; R = H, CH3, CF3; Boc = tert-butoxycarbonyl), favoring the slow release of the ligand in the reaction medium. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) structural analysis was extensively used as a means to characterize the isolated materials (see the Supporting Information). Noteworthy, all [Ni8(L)6] materials crystallize in the cubic Fm3m space group and contain ligand-bridged octanuclear [Ni8(OH)4(H2O)2] clusters, within a 3D porous framework of overall [Ni8(m4-X)6(m4-L)6] formulation (X = OH or H2O).[18] Each NiII ion is hexacoordinated in a fac-NiN3O3 fashion and shows intermetallic nonbonding distances close to 3.0 . The cubic clusters are connected to 12 adjacent ones by linear exo- tetradentate linkers to yield a face-centered cubic (fcu) topology. Their cubic close-packing (ccp) arrangement, analogous to that of the [Zr6O4(OH)4] nodes in the UiO (University of Oslo) series,[9] gives rise to one octahedral and two tetrahedral cavities per MOF formula unit (see Figure 1). A very similar series of MOFs showing the fcu topology and highly tunable sorption performances has been recently reported.[19] As expected from the increasing length of the organic linkers, the unit cell parameters (ranging from 17.17  for [Ni8(L1)6] to 32.53  for [Ni8(L5)6]), and void volumes (Table 1) of the isolated compounds become pro- gressively larger. Chemical stability tests demonstrated that the [Ni8(L)6] species survive at room temperature after suspension in basic, yet not in acidic, media for 24 h. As regards the thermal stability, the thermogravimetric (TG) curves show no other thermal event but a steep weight decrease, starting in the range of 300–3508C and completing near 4008C, clearly indicating the decomposition of the material (Figure S2). Noteworthy, [Ni8(L3)6], the bipyrazolate-containing species with a benzene residue only, exhibits the highest thermal stability and its decomposition starts around 3508C. Slightly lower decomposition onset temperatures are observed for the remaining materials, which can be reasonably attributed to decarboxylation paths (for L1 and L2) or to the intrinsically lower thermal inertness of alkynes (for L4 and the L5 series). Variable-temperature XRPD measurements carried out in air[20] demonstrated that all [Ni8(L)6] species 1) are thermally stable and rigid, 2) possess permanent porosity, and 3) maintain their thermal stability, together with their framework topology, along consecutive heating–cooling cycles (Figures S6–S8). On the basis of the latter occurrence, it might be proposed that also their adsorption performances are preserved along cycles of thermal activation followed by adsorption. The accessibility of the pore entrance and surface polarity along the [Ni8(L)6] series have been studied by N2 (77 K) and H2O (298 K) adsorption experiments (Figures 2 and 3, and Table 1). The N2 adsorption data indicate that the longer the linker, the higher the porosity, as evidenced by the progres- sively higher adsorption capacity and specific surface area. Noteworthy, all the MOFs of the series, except [Ni8(L5)6] and Figure 1.

KGaA, Weinheim www.angewandte.org its functionalized analogs, show type I isotherms, character- istic of microporous crystalline solids. The L5-based species feature pores in the mesopore range (2.4 nm wide); therefore, N2 uptake in the low-pressure region is not as steep as for the other compounds. The [Ni8(L5-R)6] (R = CH3, CF3) systems, sharing very similar unit cell parameters, exhibit almost the same uptake of N2 (Figure S3) with just minor differences, suggesting that ligand functionalization does not affect the accessibility of this probe molecule to the porous network, even if it significantly modifies the surface polarity. As mentioned above, stability towards hydrolysis is a major requirement for practical applications. On the other hand, surface hydrophobicity is also advantageous for appli- cations that involve capture of organic molecules in moist environments. The enhanced stability provided by metal– pyrazolate coordinative bonds can be exemplified by the sensitivity to water of the materials containing mixed pyrazolate/carboxylate-based ligands ([Ni8(L1)6] and [Ni8(L2)6]): after soaking them in water at room temperature for 24 h, a few minor changes are observed in their XRPD patterns (Figure S4); at variance, all the species containing bipyrazolate linkers remain completely unaltered. Measure- ment of cycles of water adsorption–desorption isotherms at 298 K is a highly valuable tool to evaluate both stability toward hydrolysis and pore surface hydrophobicity of MOFs.[21] Consequently, all the [Ni8(L)6] materials have been studied in this regard (Figure 3 and Figure S5). The behavior of the [Ni8(L)6] species has been compared to that of the highly hydrophobic, commercially available, activated carbon Blcher-101408 (provided by Blcher GmbH), the active species employed in the state-of-the-art Saratoga filtering systems.[22] The comparison shows that the maximum amount of adsorbed water is in line with the pore size and cell volume (see Figure 3 and Figure S5). Noteworthy, while the mixed carboxylate/pyrazolate [Ni8(L1)6] and [Ni8(L2)6] sys- tems are sensitive to moisture, those containing bipyrazolate linkers exhibit a low water affinity as well as a high stability in environmental moisture. Indeed, partial pressures corre- sponding to the beginning of water vapor condensation into the porous frameworks increase upon extension of the spacer (namely P/Po > 0.3 for [Ni8(L3)6], P/Po > 0.5 for [Ni8(L4)6], and P/Po > 0.6 for [Ni8(L5)6]) and augment even further upon inclusion of hydrophobic substituents on the benzene ring of H2L5 (namely P/Po > 0.65 for [Ni8(L5-CH3)6], and P/Po > 0.80 for [Ni8(L5-CF3)6]), which is indicative of the increasing hydrophobicity of the frameworks (Figure 3). The relevance of these results is further evidenced if compared to those obtained with prototypical mesoporous MOFs such as MIL- 100(Fe) and MIL-101(Cr). Indeed, [Ni8(L5)6] is more hydro- phobic than both MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Cr),[21] even if it is slightly less hydrophobic than Blcher-101408, since water vapor enters the structure of the latter only at relative pressures higher than 0.6. Remarkably, while the introduction of methyl groups, as in [Ni8(L5-CH3)6], slightly enhances the hydrophobicity, the functionalization with fluorinated resi- dues, as in [Ni8(L5-CF3)6], gives rise to a highly hydrophobic material, which clearly outperforms Blcher-101408. The low affinity of [Ni8(L5-CF3)6] to moisture is exemplified also by the narrowing of the hysteresis loop, which is in agreement with the narrow pore distribution and is also indicative of easy desorption of the adsorbed moisture. The latter feature further highlights the potential relevance of this MOF under operative humid conditions. In this regard, although Omary and co-workers[5] have shown that the introduction of fluoroalkane residues in a MOF gives rise to a highly hydrophobic material, no report on the systematic variation of the pore size and functionalization to modulate the surface hydrophobicity of the pore can be found in the literature. The hydrophobic nature of the bipyrazolate [Ni8(L)6] systems prompted us to study their possible use for air purification processes, in which moisture is unavoidably present and acts as a strong competitor with the adsorbates of interest. Consequently, we have investigated the ability of the activated [Ni8(L)6] systems to capture hydrophobic, harmful VOCs under dynamic conditions, in the presence and absence of moisture. As a case of study, we have essayed the performance of these materials for the capture of diethylsulfide (DES, a model of mustard gas, already used by us in previous studies; Scheme 2)[23] from dry and humid Ar/N2 streams. The experiments have been carried out by checking the dynamic weight increase of the activated bipyrazolate [Ni8(L)6] systems as well as of the Blcher- 101408 reference material, at room temperature, upon Figure 2.

Ed. 2013, 52, 8290 –8294 exposure to stream of VOCs under dry conditions or in 80% RH (Scheme S1). The experimental results are presented in Figure 4. The results under dry conditions are indicative of rapid incorporation of DES as well as of a high adsorption capacity for all tested materials. Both capacity and kinetics are comparable to those of the Blcher-101408 activated carbon. Indeed, in the case of dry DES streams, the kinetics of the incorporation process is basically independent on the tested material, suggesting that the process depends only on the DES flow, which determines the rate at which the saturation is reached. The best performing materials are [Ni8(L4)6] and Blcher-101408. However, the most significant results have been achieved in the case of strongly competitive moist atmosphere (up to 80% RH) as required under highly demanding operative conditions, for example, in military applications.[16] In this case, it was found that Blcher-101408 as well as [Ni8(L4)6] and [Ni8(L5)6] adsorb significant amounts of water, whereas [Ni8(L5-CF3)6] does not (Figure 4C), as a further proof of its high hydrophobic nature. Indeed, 1HNMR analysis of the adsorbate phase after the adsorption process of DES in highly competitive moist streams reveals that only [Ni8(L5-CF3)6] and Blcher-101408 efficiently capture DES under these conditions (Figure 4B), witnessing that the adsorption of DES by [Ni8(L5-CF3)6] is not affected by the presence of humidity. Aiming at the evaluation of the strength of the inter- actions of DES with the studied materials, we also performed pulse gas chromatographic experiments. The variation of the retention volumes (Vg) as a function of temperature, accord- ing to the Clausius–Clapeyron-type equation DHads = Rd- (lnVg)/d(1/T) (Figure S6),[24] allows the estimation of the zero- coverage adsorption heats (DHads). On the other hand, the direct relation between the retention volume (Vg) and the Henry constant (KH) allows to calculate KH values at 298 K (Table 2).[23] Noteworthy, the results show a strengthening of DES interactions with the framework on passing from [Ni8(L5)6] to [Ni8(L5- CF3)6], which is indicative of the positive effect of the surface functionalization of the pore with trifluromethane. The values of DHads and KH for the Blcher-101408 carbon material, although higher, lie in a similar range. These results further support the importance of being able to control the surface hydrophobicity of the adsorbent for the capture of harmful VOCs. In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the formation of highly porous 3D frameworks [Ni8(OH)4(H2O)2(L)6]n is decidedly favored. The strategy shown here reveals not only that it is possible to construct an isoreticular series of MOFs containing azolate ligands, but also that the use of metal–azolate coordinative bonds gives rise to materials with enhanced stability towards hydrol- ysis. Moreover, the length and functionalization of the linkers impact on the pore size as well as on the fine tuning of the surface polarity. Noteworthy, the incorporation of trifluoroalkyl residues gives rise to a significant increase of hydrophobicity, overcom- ing the problems associated with the adsorption of harmful VOCs in highly competitive moist environments. Accord- ingly, the performance in the capture of VOCs along the isoreticular series reported herein might be considered as a first step towards the rational design of MOFs for the capture of harmful VOCs under highly demanding environ- mental conditions.

Elemental analyses were performed with a THERMO SCIENTIFIC Flash 2000 equiipment. IR absorption bands were measured by a Midac FT-IR on KBr pellets. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were acquired on a 500 MHz Varian Equipment using CDCl3 as solvent. Thermogravimetric and differential calorimetric analyses were performed, under air, on a Shimadzu-TGA-50H/DSC equipment, at a heating rate of 20 ºC min-1. Except for the structural analysis, XRPD data were collected on a Bruker D2-PHASER diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The compounds were manually grounded in an agate mortar, then deposited in the hollow of a zero background silicon sample holder. N2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 77 K on a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 volumetric instrument. Prior to measurement, the DMF guest molecules of the powdered samples were exchanged with CH2Cl2 for 7 h; the CH2Cl2-exchanged samples were heated at 130 °C for 7 h and outgassed to 10-5 bar. Water adsorption isotherms were measured at 298 K and cycled up to three times in order to evaluate the reversibility of the adsorption- desorption process. X-ray Powder Diffraction Structural Analyses. Powdered, polycrystalline batches of compounds [Ni8(L)6] (L = L1, L2, L3, L5, and L5-CF3) were gently ground in an agate mortar; then, they were deposited in the hollow of an aluminum-framed, zero-background sample holder. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer, equipped with Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), a Lynxeye linear position-sensitive detector, and the following optics: primary beam Soller slits (2.3°), fixed divergence slit (0.5°), receiving slit (8 mm). The generator was set at 40 kV and 40 mA. As expected, a visual inspection of the preliminary acquisitions revealed that all the species are isostructural to Ni(II)-based MOFs previously characterized by us12. To carry out the structural analyses, overnight scans were performed in a wide 2θ range (see Table S1), with steps of 0.02°. A standard peak search below 30° was followed by indexing through the singular value decomposition method3 implemented in TOPAS-R,4 which allowed the determination of the lattice parameters. Systematic absences and the above mentioned isomorphism permitted to individuate the most probable space group. Prior to structure refinement, Le Bail refinements were carried out to confirm unit cells and space groups. The structural models were built up on the basis of our a priori knowledge.1 An idealized rigid model was used to describe the crystallographically independent portion of the ligand.5 The difference Fourier map calculated with the structure factors of the framework alone revealed that the solvent is highly disordered. Its electronic density was modelled by locating, within the cavities, the number of oxygen atoms whose S2 refined site occupation factors, combined with the site multiplicity, represent the total electron density of the solvent, as estimated from the elemental and TG analyses. Structure refinements were carried out by means of the Rietveld method6 with TOPAS-R. The peak shapes were described with the fundamental parameters approach.7 The background was modeled by a Chebyshev polynomial function. The thermal effect was simulated by using a single isotropic parameter for the metal ions, augmented by 2.0 Å2 for lighter atoms. Table S1 contains the most relevant crystallochemical data and structure refinement details. The final Rietveld refinements plots are collectively supplied in Figure S1.

For the structural details of species [Ni8(L4)6] the reader must consult reference 2. Variable-Temperature X-ray Powder Diffraction. Variable-temperature X-ray powder diffraction (VT- XRPD) experiments were performed in air on the as-synthesized species [Ni8(L)6] (L = L1 to L5) to highlight their structural response to temperature variations. To the aim, two different sets of measurements were accomplished: progressive heating up to decomposition was performed in order to assess the thermal robustness and the permanent porosity of the materials (Figure S6); a series of consecutive heating-cooling cycles was carried out to evaluate their stability during consecutive series of thermal activation (Figure S7). Both sets of experiments were performed in air in a pertinent low-angle 2θ range, using a custom-made sample heater assembled by Officina Elettrotecnica di Tenno, Ponte Arche, Italy. Powdered polycrystalline batches of [Ni8(L)6] were ground in an agate mortar and deposited in the hollow of an aluminum sample holder. The thermal behavior was followed up to decomposition heating the samples in situ with steps of 20 °C. The temperature cycles were performed varying the temperature, in situ, between 50 °C (to prevent possible undesired contribution by moisture) and 200 °C. When first reaching 200 °C, a number of XRPD traces was acquired till an asymptote was reached, to assure the removal of moisture potentially present. When comparing the TGA and VT-XRPD results, the reader must be aware that the thermocouple of the VT-XRPD set-up is not in direct contact with the sample, this determining a slight difference in the temperature at which the same event is detected by the two techniques. The TGA temperatures have to be considered more reliable. DES adsorption experiments. For the evaluation of the dynamic adsorption of DES vapours, the increase in weight of ca. 40 mg of activated solid was measured by means of a Sartorius M2P microbalance equipped with Sarto-Collect software (using the apparatus depicted in Scheme S1). The sample weight S3 was recorded every 60 s. In the case of adsorption in a dry environment, a constant flux of Ar (4 mL min- 1) was bubbled in a flask containing DES at room temperature. The Ar flow was then mixed with a N2 flow (16 mL min-1) before reaching the balance chamber where the adsorbent material was located. For experiments in the presence of 80% relative humidity, the N2 flow was bubbled in a flask containing distilled water at room temperature. The possible condensation of water on the MOFs (external and internal) surface upon exposure to 80 % humidity was additionally evaluated by using a dry Ar flow (4 mL min-1) and a humid N2 flow (16 mL min-1). Variable-temperature pulse chromatography. Gas-phase adsorption at zero coverage surface was studied by means of the pulse chromatographic technique8, employing a Varian 450-GC gas chromatograph equipped with a 15 cm-column (0.4 cm internal diameter) packed with ca. 1 g of the sample. In order to avoid pressure drops in the chromatographic column, the powders of the sample under investigation were mixed with sand before filling the column (70 % of sand and 30 % of MOF). This procedure was not necessary for Blücher-101408. For the activation of each material, a He flow (30 mL min-1) was passed through the column at 150 °C for 12 h. Later on, 0.2 µL of each VOC was injected at 1 bar on an He flow (15 mL min-1) and the separation performance of the chromatographic column was examined at different temperatures by using a flame ionization detector (FID). Synthesis of the organic ligands 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (H2L1). H2L1 was obtained according to a method reported in the literature9. In a typical synthesis, 2 mL (1.99 g, 24.2 mmol) of 4-methylpyrazole were dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water. 1.5 g of NaOH were added at 60 °C. Then, 11.5 g of KMnO4 dissolved in 250 mL of distilled water were added dropwise over a period of 4 hours at 80 °C. The reaction mixture was further heated at 90 °C for 1 hour and filtered while hot. The solvent was reduced to 100 mL and the pure product precipitated as a white solid upon acidification to pH < 2 (1.23 g, yield 45 %).
