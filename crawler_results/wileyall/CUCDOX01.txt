Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/chem.201001398 Crystal-to-Crystal Transformation from a Mononuclear Compound in a Hydrogen-Bonded Three-Dimensional Framework to a Layered Coordination Polymer Bin Zhang,*[a] Daoben Zhu,*[a] and Yan Zhang[b] In coordination compounds, the weak interaction of guest molecules, coordination geometry distortion, and coordina- tion number changes can effectively modulate the physical properties of magnetism, absorption, and chirality. There- fore, dynamic molecular crystals capable of crystal-to-crystal transformations, involving changes in the dimensionality, color, and physical properties, are very attractive for their potential applications in molecular devices such as switches and sensors.[1] Because it is usually difficult to obtain high- quality transformed crystals after removal of the bound water or solvent due to collapsing of the framework, only a few crystal-to-crystal transformations have been reported.[2] So far, the crystal-to-crystal transformations were observed between different dimensional coordination polymers, such as 1D to 2D, 1D to 3D, and 2D to 3D.[3] The crystal-to-crys- tal transformations from 0D polynuclear compounds to 2D and 3D coordination polymers have also been reported.[4] Herein, we present a crystal-to-crystal transformation from 0D mononuclear compound CuCl2(1,4-dioxane)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2 (1) into 2D coordination polymer Cu3Cl6(1,4-dioxane)2 (2) ac- companied by changes in the crystal color, cell parameters, space group, crystal structure, coordination environments of Cu2+, and magnetic properties. Blue crystal 1 was obtained from CuCl2·6H2O in a mix- ture of 3n HCl/CH3OH/(1,4-dioxane) with a yield of 60%. When 1 was heated at an elevated temperature (such as 1208C for 3 min) or exposure to air with a humidity lower than 50%, it transformed completely into brown crystal 2 and 2 remained stable until 2008C. During the transforma- tion, the weight loss was 44%. This value is much higher than those reported for crystal-to-crystal transformations with a dimension change from a 0D polynuclear compound: the weight loss was 5.6% from binuclear compound [Co2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(8- qoac)2(N3)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)] (8-qoac=quinoline-8-oxyacetate) to 2D coordination polymer [Co2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(8-qoac)2(N3)2]n, 20.7% from hex- anuclear compound [{FeIII(Tp)(CN)3}4ACHTUNGTRENUNG{FeIIACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH3CN)- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2}2]·10H2O·2CH3CN (Tp=hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate) to 1D coordination polymer [{FeIII(Tp)(CN)3}4FeII- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2FeII], 21.6% from hexanuclear compound [{FeIII(Tp)(CN)3}4ACHTUNGTRENUNG{CoIIACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH3CN)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2}2]·10H2O·2CH3CN to 3D coordination polymer [{FeIII(Tp)(CN)3}2CoII].[4] It is also higher than the value observed in porous molecular crystals in which the framework remains the same within transformation involving approximately 10% desolvation of [Mn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(HCOO)6] ·solvent or 28% dehydration of [Co2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H0.67bdt)3]·20H2O (H2bdt=5,5’-(1,4-phenylene)bis(1H-tet- razole)).[5] Attempts to resolvate 2 to obtain pure product 1 have not been successful yet; therefore, desolvation from 1 to 2 is irreversible. The crystal to-crystal transformation from 1 to 2 was con- firmed by the X-ray diffraction experiments. When 1 desol- vates into 2, the space group changes from C2/c into C2/m with changes in the cell parameters and crystal structures. As shown in Figure 1, compound 1 is composed of mono- nuclear compound CuCl2(1,4-dioxane)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2. Each Cu2+ is octahedrally coordinated by two Cl, two H2O, and two O atoms (one from each of two 1,4-dioxane molecules in the chair conformation) trans to each other. The CuO distance to H2O (1.962(1) ) is shorter than to the O atom of the 1,4-dioxane molecules (2.615(2) ). The shortest distance between Cu2+ ions is 5.937 . There are hydrogen bonds be- tween H2O and Cl: O3H1···Cl1 2.43 /1638, and H2O and 1,4-dioxane: O3H2···O1 2.74 /1668. The hydrogen bonds form a three-dimensional NaCl framework. [a] Prof. B.

J. 2010, 16, 9994 – 9997 9994 Compound 2 consists of layered coordination polymer of (CuCl2)3(1,4-dioxane)2 as shown in Figure 2.[6] Cu1 has a square-pyramidal geometry and is coordinated by four Cl (two Cl1, two Cl2) in the equatorial plane with a distance of 0.149  in the direction of the apex and one O (O1) atom with a CuO distance of 2.359(3)  from the 1,4-dioxane molecule in the chair conformation axially. The weaker Cu O bonds (O2) 2.823(3)  complete the distorted octahedra of Cu1. Cu2 is octahedrally coordinated by four Cl2 and two O2 from 1,4-dioxane with CuO 2.434(3) . Cl1 bridges Cu1 with a Cu1-Cl1-Cu1’ angle of 93.66(4)8, Cl2 connects Cu1 and Cu2 with a Cu1-Cl2-Cu2 angle of 85.26(3)8, the di- hedral angle between two CuCl4 in the plane of neighboring Cu1 and Cu2 is 50.11(3)8. The CuCl2 chain is formed along the c axis. CuCl2 chains are connected through 1,4-dioxane molecules along the a axis and form a long and short brick network with the Schlfli symbols of (4.62)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(42.62) on the ac plane. The Cu···Cu distance bridged by Cl is 3.3523(9)  between two Cu1 and 3.1119(5)  between Cu1 and Cu2; this is in the same range as reported compounds.[7] The Cu···Cu distance is 6.9577(6)  between two Cu2+ ions con- nected by 1,4-dioxane molecules. There are no weak interac- tions, such as hydrogen bonds, between the layers. The CuCl and CuO distances in 1 and 2 are in the same range as those of reported compounds.[7,8] When 1 was heated at 90–1608C or exposed to dry air, then H2O and 2/3 of the 1,4-dioxane content desolvated from 1 to form 2. The transformation suggests that the connecting mode of Cl and 1,4-dioxane changed from terminal mode in 1 to bridged mode in 2 and the mononuclear molecule CuCl2(1,4-dioxane)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2 transformed into layered coordi- nation polymer (CuCl2)3(1,4-dioxane)2 as Scheme 1. It is the first example of crystal-to-crystal transformation from mon- onuclear molecules to 2D coordination polymer. Due to the hydrogen bonds in 1 and (m-Cl)2 bridge in 2, the magnetic properties of these compounds have been stud- ies. The temperature-dependent magnetization was carried Figure 1.

On a c versus T plot of 1, a broad maximum was observed at 38 K (Figure 3) as observed for Cu2+ compounds.[9] At 300 K, the cT value was 0.59 cm3Kmol1, which is significantly larger than the value of 0.375 cm3Kmol1 expected for an isolated, spin-only ion with S=1/2 and g=2.00 and close to the reported value.[10] The cT value decreased smoothly upon cooling and reached 0.01 cm3Kmol1 at 2 K. The susceptibility data above 50 K fit the Curie–Weiss law well, giving Curie and Weiss con- stants of C=0.690(3) cm3Kmol1 and q=66.7(7) K, re- spectively, with R=1.23104. The negative Weiss value means strong antiferromagnetic interactions between Cu2+ ions. On the c versus T plot of 2, a maximum value of 0.0288 cm3mol1 was observed at 7.8 K. Below 7.8 K, the c value decreased and reached 0.0177 cm3mol1 at 2 K. At 300 K, the cT value was 0.56 cm3Kmol1, in the same range as that obtained for 1. The cT value remained the same above 80 K, then decreased upon cooling and reached 0.035 cm3Kmol1 at 2 K. The susceptibility data above 50 K fit the Curie–Weiss law well, giving Curie and Weiss con- stants of C=0.567(1) cm3Kmol1, q=3.2(1) K, respective- ly, with R=2.04105. The antiferromagnetic interaction in 2 is weaker than in 1. The isothermal magnetization was measured at 2 K. No hysteresis loop was observed in 1 and 2. The isothermal magnetization increased linearly as the field increased and reached 0.06 Nb at 65 kOe in 1, 0.33 Nb at 65 kOe in 2. These results confirmed that the antiferromagnetic interac- tion in 1 is stronger than in 2, although the Cu2+ ion is con- nected by a m-Cl2 bridge and a dioxane bridge in 2. Depend- ing on the crystal structures of 1 and 2, the weak hydrogen- bonding interactions play as important a role as the Cl and dioxane bridges on molecular magnetism. In summary, the crystal composed of mononuclear com- pound 1 in a hydrogen-bonded three-dimension framework can be transformed to a crystal composed of layered coordi- nation polymer (2) by desolvation with changes in the crys- tal composition, color, structure, and magnetism as the anti- ferromagnetic interaction decreased and the Weiss constants changed from 66.7 (1) to 3.2 K (2), and the temperature at which a maximum was observed on a c versus T plot de- creased from 38 to 7.8 K. These results show a way to obtain crystals quantitatively by crystal-to-crystal transfor- mation with drastic changes in the molecular formula, crys- tal structure, crystal color, and magnetism and provides crys- talline materials to be used as sensors or switches in the near future.

Physical characterizations: Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out on Shimadzu DTG-60 Analyzer with 108Cmin1 from room temperature to 6008C. There are two main mass losses in 1: 44% from 60 to 808C, and 17% from 180 to 2008C. There is one main mass loss in 2: 30% from 180 to 2208C. X-ray diffraction data was collected at 293 K on a Nonius KappaCCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated MoKa (l=0.71073 ) radia- tion.[11] The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full- matrix least-squares on F2 by using the SHELX program,[12] with aniso- tropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms of H2O in 1 were found by difference Fourier and refined isotropically. Hydrogen atoms of dioxane were located by calculations and refined iso- tropically.
