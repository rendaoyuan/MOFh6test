A detailed Introduction There has been a rapid development in the synthesis and application of metal–organic frameworks (MOF) during the last decade. A lot of effort has been invested to ration- ally design MOF materials in the fields of gas adsorption and storage, catalysis, and magnetic materials.[1–3] Among the different connecting ligands, aliphatic and aromatic car- boxylic acids (mono-, di-, tri-, etc.) proved to be the most demanding candidates, and their use led to a large class of desired MOFs. Notably, carboxylates have versatile bridg- ing modes; they can act as monodentate or bidentate li- gands, or they can have an even higher denticity.[4,5] Because of their different coordination modes of syn–syn, syn–anti, and anti–anti they are capable of tuning the effective mag- netic moment and also the surface properties of the MOFs. Moreover, the bridging carboxylate ligands can be function- alized and also post-modified quite easily. Framework ma- terials with carboxylates have a wide range of structural properties (from rigid to flexible). One can tune their struc- ture by introducing an appropriate ligand according to the desired properties. It is worth mentioning that MOFs with large pores are of wide interest because of their many po- [a] Department of Chemistry, CICECO, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal E-mail: rupamsen1@yahoo.com zlin@ua.pt Homepage: http://www.ciceco.ua.pt/ [b] Department of Chemistry, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700032, Kolkata, India Supporting information for this article is available on the WWW under http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejic.201300560.

The com- pound is catalytically active towards epoxidation reactions in heterogeneous medium with H2O2 as an oxidant. They cata- lyze the epoxidation of almost all types of olefinic substrates with good efficiency. After the reaction, the catalysts can be recovered quite easily, and they can be used for further reac- tions without any loss of activity for several cycles. tential applications in fields ranging from catalysis to gas adsorption. It is well reported that bifunctional dicarboxyl- ates can bridge various metal ions, affording a lot of highly porous and catalytically active frameworks.[6] The group of Yaghi has developed a family of compounds based on a structural arrangement, in which the pore size may be tuned over a wide range. By using longer or shorter organic mole- cules of similar geometry, Yaghi et al. have now prepared 16 variations of the MOF-5 structure with pores varying in diameter from 3.8 to 28.8 Å.[7] By tuning the porous chan- nel, one can rationalize adsorption and catalytic properties within the pores of the materials. Among the recent developments in the application of MOF materials as catalysts, the epoxidation of alkenes is one of the basic reactions in the industry, because epoxides are the key intermediate for the syntheses of several valu- able organic products.[8] By using stoichiometric amounts of peroxy acids we can successfully isolate epoxy olefinic products, which are widely used in the industrial synthesis of fine chemicals.[9] Hydrogen peroxide is the most attract- ive green oxidant, as it is environmentally benign and also quite cheap, and it affords water as the only waste product, which also simplifies the isolation of the desired prod- uct.[10,11] To date, a few truly heterogeneous and recyclable MOF-based catalysts have been established in the literature for H2O2-based alkene epoxidation, and the exploration of such catalysts is still a challenge for many chemists. The heterogeneous catalytic process, which eliminates the sepa- ration problem and reduces the generation of waste prod- ucts is of prime importance.[12] In this regard, the hetero- www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER geneous catalytic process is superior over the homogeneous process because of the easy recovery and the solution sta- bility. Several approaches have been made to heterogenize homogeneous systems in various catalytic reactions includ- ing the oxidation of C–H bonds or epoxidation reactions. Besides the traditional strategy of using polymer-supported homogeneous complexes,[13] other new efforts, such as en- capsulating molecular complexes in zeolites,[14] using poly- oxometalate(POM)–phosphonate cluster compounds,[15] mineral-based materials,[16] nanoparticle-based catalyst,[17] etc., and most remarkably, building up porphyrin-based metal-encapsulated MOFs, have recently been intro- duced.[18] More convincingly, in contrast to these systems, the direct use of MOFs as the catalysts is of wide interest. Recently a few MOFs have been developed, which are cata- lytically active. Herein, in continuation of our work, we in- troduce a new 3D carboxylate MOF, which can be used as a heterogeneous catalyst for olefin epoxidation reactions. In the present work, we used a new dihydroxy dicarboxylate, 2,5-Dihydroxy-1,4-benzenediacetic acid (H2-DHBDA), to construct the 3D MOFs. In the literature there are very lim- ited results reported for this dicarboxylate ligand. Cheng et al. constructed a 1D compound with Zn and 2,2-bipyr- idine,[19a] and in another study Zhang et al. reported a 1D coordination compound containing Cd and phenanthrolin as the blocking amine.[19b] In this paper, we report two new MOFs, [Co(H2-DHBDA)(bpe)]n (1) and [Co(H2- DHBDA)(bpee)]n (2) [bpe = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene, bpee = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane], which are well stable in the re- action medium and capable of catalyzing epoxidation reac- tions with H2O2 as the oxidant. Remarkably, they can be used for several cycles with good selectivity and without any loss of activity. Results and Discussion X-ray Structure of Compounds 1 and 2 Both compounds crystallized in the space group P21/n with Z = 4. ORTEP diagrams of compounds 1 and 2 with an atom numbering scheme are shown in Figures S1 and S2. A summary of bond lengths and angles is presented in Table S1. Because both compounds have a similar structure, only compound 1 is discussed here in detail. The asymmet- ric unit of compound 1 contains one independent cobalt(II) center in a distorted octahedral coordination environment. The basal plane is formed by the two chelating oxygen atoms (O15 and O16) and two bridging O atoms from three carboxylato groups (O1 and O2). The axial positions are occupied by two nitrogen atoms (N17 and N28) from two bridging co-ligands. The secondary building unit is a Co2 diad. The two Co centres are linked by two bridging biden- tate carboxylate groups (Co···O1–C3–O2···Co) to form a Co2 paddlewheel unit with a Co···Co separation of 4.02 Å (Figure 1). These carboxylate groups bridge the metal ions to form 2D layers through the crystallographic ab plane (Figure 1), which are further connected by the bridging amines to ultimately form a 3D network (Figure 2). The Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2013, 5103–5109 © 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 5104 main difference between the structures of 1 and 2 is the middle C–C bond length of the bridging amine ligand (1.33 Å and 1.53 Å for 1 and 2, respectively). To further understand the structure of 1, a topological analysis was performed by reducing the multidimensional structure to a simple node-and-linker net. The topological analysis by TOPOS[20] revealed that the structure is a 7-c uninodal net with the Schläfli symbol 33.413.54.6 and the vertex symbol [3.3.3.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.*.*.*.*.*.*]. The hydroxy groups remain free on the surface of the compounds, and they participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding {O(11)–H(11)·· O(16) [-x + 1, –y + 2, –z + 1], O(12)–H(12) ·· O(1) and O(12)–H(12)·· O(15) [x-1/2, –y + 3/2, z-1/2] (Table S2)}.

Thermogravimetric Analysis Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses between room tem- perature and 800 °C show the high thermal stability of com- pounds 1 and 2. Upon increasing the temperature, there was no mass loss up to 200 °C for both compounds. Com- pound 1 is somewhat more thermally stable (up to 295 °C) than the compound 2. Whereas compound 2 starts to de- www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER grade at approximately 215 °C and spontaneously loses mass until complete decomposition at 610 °C, compound 1 starts to lose mass at approximately 295 °C, and its decom- position completes at 600 °C (Figure S3). These results clearly indicate that the compounds are highly stable and can be used for catalytic reactions at higher temperatures. Catalytic Epoxidation Reactions Olefin epoxidation reactions catalyzed by various MOFs and molecular complexes have been reported in the litera- ture with H2O2[21] or TBHP[22] as oxidants, but there are limited studies, where the materials used as catalysts show true heterogeneity. Many approaches have been made in the literature to develope heterogeneous MOF catalysts. A new cobalt-based carboxylate framework has recently been in- troduced for different olefin epoxidations.[22d] In other stud- ies, Volkmer and co-workers described the epoxidation of cyclohexene by using pyrazolate MOFs.[22a–22c] In further studies, a metalloporphyrin-encapsulated zeolite-like 3D MOF has been used for the heterogeneous oxidation of cy- clohexane.[23] In our previous attempt, we reported layered metal carboxylates and lanthanide-based MOFs, which show good activity in epoxidation reactions of olefins under heterogeneous conditions.[24,25] In contrast to these systems, in this study we introduce a new 3D MOF, which is active towards epoxidation. The catalytic activity of 1 can be sum- marized on the basis of the results shown in Table 1. Be- cause the structures of 1 and 2 are very similar, all the reac- tions were performed by using compound 1, and to confirm the catalytic activity of compound 2, we tested it with two substrates under the same reaction conditions used for 1. Compound 1 catalyzes the epoxidation of almost all kinds of alkenes: terminal linear, cyclic, styrene, substituted styr- ene, stilbene, and also limonene (conversion plot derived from the GC data is shown in the Supporting Information S4–S11). As examples of cyclic olefins, cyclohexene and cy- clooctene were used. Cyclohexene was successfully con- verted up to 82% with an epoxide selectivity of 36% at 40 °C. For the cyclohexene oxidation, it is quite a challenge to increase the oxide yield. Hwang et al. recently used a carboxylate MOF (Ni–dihydroxyphthalate) for the oxi- dation of cyclohexene, and a maximum conversion of 39.7% was achieved at 60 °C, but the TOF remained within the range of 11.8.[26] Kholdeeve et al. achieved a good selec- tivity of 80% with a conversion of 84% at 50 °C by using a polyoxometalate/MIL-101 composite material.[27] In an- other study, Janiak and co-workers introduced a series of Mn-based dicarboxylate frameworks, with which they got good epoxide yields of 64% at 60 °C.[28] We also achieved quite a good epoxide selectivity for the oxidation of cyclo- octene. Cyclooctene was successfully converted with 100% epoxide selectivity and a maximum conversion of 86%. Jan- iak et al. reported a highest selectivity of 75% by using the Mn–MOFs as catalysts.[28] Kholdeeva and co-workers recently presented another example of the cyclooctene oxi- dation by using a MIL-101/polyoxometalate based catalyst, achieving 99% selectivity and a conversion of 76%.[27] Eur.

Although terminal alkenes need higher activation ener- gies, we got fair conversions of 88 and 71% for 1-hexene and 1-octene, respectively, with oxide as the sole product, which clearly demonstrates the good efficiency of the cata- lyst. To study conjugated olefins, styrene and 4-methylstyr- ene were used. The substrates were converted with 75 and 80% efficiency, respectively, and the product selectivity re- mained around 63 and 48%, respectively, with benzalde- hyde as the usual corresponding by-product. Generally, in the epoxidation of styrene catalyzed by transition metal im- mobilized on zeolites or supported molecular catalysts, ep- oxide yields of higher than 40% are hardly found in earlier studies.[25] Recently, we succeeded in improving the yield of styrene epoxide to up to 72% by using a layered transition metal carboxylate MOF.[24] In another recent attempt, Kholdeeva et al. highlighted a good example of using a MIL-101/POM composite, with which they successfully in- creased the epoxide selectivity to up to 73%, but the conver- sion remained low (30%).[27] Compound 1 exhibited a good efficiency for the trans-stilbene oxidation. After 24 h, we got 63% of conversion with 100% of product selectivity, which is quite remarkable with respect to the recently reported results. Janiak el al recently used Mn–carboxylate MOFs for trans-stilbene oxidation, but their selectivity did not ex- www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER ceed 7%.[28] In contrast to these systems, Kholdeeva et al. successfully achieved a good epoxide selectivity of 69%, but the conversion again remained around 35%.[27] A different substrate, limonene, was also subjected to oxidation reac- tion; the conversion was good (78%) with a product selec- tivity of 81% and along with some unidentified products. A comparison of the catalytic performances on the basis of different Co-based catalysts has been accumulated in Table 2. The overall reaction study shows that this new compound is a good candidate for catalyzing the epoxid- ation of olefins in a heterogeneous medium at moderate temperatures, and no induction period was observed in any of the catalytic reactions. On the other hand, Compound 2 was also employed for the oxidation of cyclooctene and styrene. This framework also shows similar reactivity for these oxidation. With cyclooctene, after 24 h, it achieved up to 78% of conversion with 100% epoxide selectivity, and with styrene, it produced 57% epoxide with a conversion of 68%. Table 2.

[a] Reaction conditions were the same as given in the footnote of Table 1; t.w.: this work. To observe the nature of the catalyst and to optimize the reaction conditions, we carried out some control experi- ments, varying different reaction parameters. At first we studied the oxidation reaction of cyclooctene without the MOF catalyst at the same reaction conditions, but after 24 h we did not get any conversion of the substrate. We also studied the reaction under homogeneous conditions by using Co(NO3)2 as the catalyst, but we only got a very poor conversion of 5%, which proves the activity of the present catalyst. We examined the epoxidation of 1-hexene and cy- clooctene in six different solvents to find the optimal sol- vent. The best conversion and selectivity were found in ace- tonitrile. This can be explained as follows: the optimum po- larity of the acetonitrile might be alleviating by allowing both the oxidant and the substrate in the same solution phase to carry out the epoxidation reaction smoothly. The conversion decreased in the order CH3CNCH3COCH3CHCl3CH2Cl2EtOHMeOH (Figure 3). This study evidences the necessity of the opti- Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2013, 5103–5109 © 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 5106 mum polarity of the solvent, which is needed for a higher conversion of the substrates. To monitor the temperature effect, we tuned the reaction temperature from 30–60 °C for the epoxidation of cyclooctene and 1-hexene, a good yield with good product selectivity was obtained at a moderate temperature of 40 °C. At higher temperatures the conver- sion decreases, as H2O2 starts to degrade at higher tempera- tures, which clearly demonstrates the vital influence of the temperature on the reaction course (Figure 4). Figure 3. Catalytic efficacy of 1 in different solvents. Reaction con- ditions were the same as given in the footnote of Table 1. Figure 4. Catalytic efficacy of 1 at different temperatures. Reaction conditions were the same as given in the footnote of Table 1. Thus, the overall reaction study shows that this com- pound is active and efficient besides the results published in recent studies.[25–28] To find out the surface nature of the MOFs, we carried out nitrogen adsorption studies, but there was no measurable pore volume found in the MOFs, which clearly indicates that there is no appreciable void space to accommodate any guest molecule within the pore. Therefore, we assume that the catalysis reaction takes place at the surface of the compounds and not in the pores. To understand the pathway of the reaction, it can be assumed that for the H2O2 catalyzed epoxidation the general reaction proceeds through the CoIII–peroxido intermediate by a con- certed oxygen atom transfer to the double bond to yield the epoxide. The proposed mechanism for the oxidation of alkene with H2O2 is illustrated in Scheme 1. The reversible www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER redox cycle from CoII to CoIII to CoIV and back to CoII, which involves the formation of a peroxo species and an oxygen atom transfer, is the key factor for these catalytic oxidations.[29a] Similar mechanisms via metal–peroxido in- termediates have been proposed in earlier studies.[29a–29c] Scheme 1. Proposed mechanism for the epoxidation reaction cata- lyzed by compound 1. Separation, Catalyst Reuse, and Heterogeneity Test The main advantages of the use of heterogeneous cata- lysts are the easy recovery of the catalyst from the reaction mixtures and its reuse. To test the leaching of the solid cata- lyst during reaction, the liquid phase of the reaction mix- ture was collected by filtration at the reaction temperature after 30% of the epoxidation reaction was completed, and the residual activity of the supernatant solution after sepa- ration of the catalysts was studied. Now, the organic phase of a first run was separated from the catalyst, and the com- position of the reaction mixture was determined by gas chromatography. This homogeneous reaction mixture was treated as a standard catalytic experiment. After 6 h of maintaining the reaction conditions, the composition was re-determined, and no progress of the reaction was ob- served, which confirms the absence of active species in the solution. These experiments clearly demonstrate that metal is not leached from the solid catalyst during epoxidation reactions. To check the stability of the catalysts, we charac- terized the solids after the reactions were over. After the catalytic reactions, the solid catalyst was recovered by cen- trifugation, washed several times with fresh acetonitrile, and dried in air in an oven. The recovered catalyst was then subjected to PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) and IR spectroscopic analyses. A comparison of PXRD patterns and IR spectra of the pristine complex and the recovered Eur.

KGaA, Weinheim 5107 catalyst convincingly demonstrates that the structural integ- rity of the complex 1 remained unaffected after the epoxid- ation reactions (Figures S12 and S13). Notably, the reco- vered catalyst can be reused in further epoxidation reactions without any considerable loss of activity (Figure 5). Figure 5. Catalytic activity of 1 in different catalytic cycles. Reac- tion conditions were the same as given in the footnote of Table 1. Conclusions In summary, two new 3D frameworks were prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction analyses. Both com- pounds have similar interesting 3D structures. The com- pounds are capable of catalyzing the epoxidation reaction in heterogeneous medium with H2O2 as the oxidant. The compound is equally active with all types of olefinic sys- tems. The frameworks behaved as heterogeneous catalysts, can be easily recovered after reaction by filtration and washing, and can subsequently be used without significant catalyst deactivation due to either leaching of active species or degradation of the structure. This study affords a new outlook for the design of new MOF oxidation catalysts. Experimental Section Materials and Physical Measurements: Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzenediacetic acid, 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane, 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, cyclohexene, cyclo- octene, styrene, 4-methylstyrene, trans-stilbene, and limonene were purchased from Aldrich and were used as received. 30% H2O2 was purchased from Merck India and used as received. FTIR spectra of samples suspended in KBr pellets were measured with a Unican Mattson Mod 7000 spectrophotometer equipped with a DTGS CsI detector. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out by using a Shimadzu TGA 50 with a heating rate of 5 °Cmin–1 under a continuous stream of nitrogen with a flow rate of 20 cm3min–1. Elemental analyses (CHN) were performed by using a Perkin–El- mer 240 elemental analyzer. The products of the catalytic reactions were identified and quantified with a Varian CP-3800 Gas Chroma- tograph by using a packed column. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the samples were recorded with a Scintag XDS-2000 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. N2 sorption mea- surements were performed with an Autosorb iQ (Quantachorme www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER Inc., USA) gas sorption system at 77 K. Prior to sorption experi- ments, samples were degassed at the desired temperature (80 °C) for approximately 3–4 h under vacuum (10–3 Torr). Synthesis and Preliminary Characterization of the Compounds Synthesis of the Compounds [Co(H2-DHBDA)(bpe)]n (1) and [Co(H2-DHBDA)(bpee)]n (2): Both the compounds were synthe- sized by using a hydrothermal method. Compounds 1 and 2 were obtained as dark-red needle crystals in a teflon-lined acid-digestion bomb, after it was kept at 160 °C for 3 d, which was followed by slow cooling to room temperature. For the digestion, Co(NO3)2 hydrate, 2,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,4-diacetic acid, and 1,2-bpe (for 1) or 1,2-bpee (for 2) were mixed in a 1:1:1 ratio. The obtained crystals were washed with ethanol and dried at ambient temperature. For catalysis, the phase purity of compound 1 was checked by PXRD (Figure S12). The nitrogen sorption study for compound 1 (Fig- ure S14) indicates that the framework is not porous in nature. Yields of 1 and 2 were in the range of approximately 60 and 55%, respectively, on the basis of the carboxylic acid. [Co(H2- DHBDA)(bpe)]n (1): calcd.

X-ray Crystallography: X-ray diffraction data for 1 and 2 were col- lected with a Bruker SMART APEX CCD X-ray diffractometer by using graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The determination of integrated intensities and the cell refinement were performed with the SAINT[30] software package by using a narrow-frame integration algorithm. An empirical absorption cor- rection (SADABS)[31] was applied. All the structures were solved by direct methods and refined by using full-matrix least-squares techniques against F2 with anisotropic displacement parameters for non-hydrogen atoms with the programs SHELXS97 and SHELXL97.[32] The hydrogen atoms of the C–H bonds were placed at geometrical positions and refined with Uiso = 1.2Ueq of the atom, to which they are attached, whereas the hydrogen atoms bonded to hydroxide oxygen atoms were obtained from the last final difference Fourier maps and refined isotropically. In the final difference Fou- rier maps there were no remarkable peaks except the ghost peaks surrounding the metal centres in both the compounds. A summary of the crystal data and relevant refinement parameters for com- pounds 1 and 2 are given in Table 3.

It can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. Catalytic Reactions: The catalytic reactions were carried out in a three-necked flask (50 mL) equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer. During the reactions the stirring speed was fixed at 300 rpm. Olefin (10 mmol), solvent (10 mL), and catalysts (2 mg) were first mixed. The mixture was then equilibrated at 40 °C in an oil bath. Hydrogen peroxide (14.4 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) was added to the reaction mixture in one portion with continuous stirring. Reac- tions were performed in air. The products of the epoxidation reac- tions were collected at different time intervals and were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. The compound was dried under vacuum (12 h) prior to its reuse as catalyst.
