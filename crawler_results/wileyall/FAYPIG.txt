Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/chem.201200696 Tailor-Made Metal–Organic Frameworks from Functionalized Molecular Building Blocks and Length-Adjustable Organic Linkers by Stepwise Synthesis Ya-Qian Lan,[a, b] Shun-Li Li,[b] Hai-Long Jiang,[a] and Qiang Xu*[a] Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been the focus of great interest due to not only their structural and chemical diversities but also the potential structure-related applica- tions, such as luminescence, gas storage, catalysis, separa- tions, and drug delivery.[1,2] In general, MOFs are assembled in “one-pot” solvothermal syntheses in which topology con- trol is accomplished only by careful selection of the metal, organic linker, and synthetic conditions.[3] Great successes have been obtained through this simple synthetic route, which is, however, limited for targeted syntheses and often uncontrollable. One of the most important goals in the syn- thesis of MOFs is to achieve “design” and “control” to obtain tailor-made compounds with expected structures and properties starting from well-characterized inorganic and or- ganic precursors.[4] A stepwise synthesis strategy undoubted- ly may help to shed light on this goal and lead to multifunc- tional MOFs with special characteristics. Recently, the molecular building block (MBB) approach has been a powerful strategy for the design and construction of MOFs.[5,6] The MBBs can act as secondary building units (SBUs),[7] which are theoretically connected by organic link- ers or metal cations to construct multifunctional MOFs from predesigned MBBs by using a stepwise synthesis strategy. However, it is largely limited in the construction of MOFs due to the difficulties of selecting MBBs and the restriction of solvothermal synthesis conditions. Hitherto, only a few MOFs have been observed using this synthesis strategy by the groups of Zhou, Zaworotko, and Su.[8] They have suc- cessfully demonstrated some examples from 0D metal–or- ganic polyhedra (MOP) to 3D MOFs by using predesigned MBBs, in which the MOPs (tetrahedron,[8a] octahedron,[8b] trigonal prism,[8c] and cuboctahedron[8d]) act as supramolec- ular building blocks. On the other hand, the functionalization of MOFs has at- tracted ever increasing scientific interest for expanding the chemical diversity and potential applications. The postsyn- thetic modification (PSM) approach has made great ach- ievements in the functionalization of MOFs.[9–11] The most common is covalent PSM of the organic linkers within the MOFs. Some discussion of dative PSM is the modification of unsaturated metal sites located at the SBUs of MOFs through a dative (i.e., metal–ligand) bond.[9e] However, there is an unfavorable lack of investigation on the function- alization of both the organic linker and SBU in the same MOFs. Moreover, the functional MOFs of PSM often dis- play poorer crystallinity and single-crystal data cannot be obtained upon PSM process, which means that the accurate structures cannot be determined. To overcome these diffi- culties, it is necessary to introduce a new synthetic strategy. If we can synthesize functionalized MBBs and combine them with some ligands that are modified by functional groups and alterable lengths, we will successfully achieve the functionalization of MOFs that consist of both the func- tionalized MBBs and length-adjustable and functional or- Abstract: In this work, we have dem- onstrated a family of diamondoid metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) based on functionalized molecular building blocks and length-adjustable organic linkers by using a stepwise syn- thesis strategy. We have successfully achieved not only “design” and “con- trol” to synthesize MOFs, but also the functionalization of both secondary building units (SBUs) and organic link- ers in the same MOF for the first time. Furthermore, the results of N2 and H2 adsorption show that their surface areas and hydrogen uptake capacities are determined by the most optimal combination of functional groups from SBUs and organic linkers, interpenetra- tion, and free volume in this system. A member of this series, DMOF-6 exhib- its the highest surface area and H2 ad- sorption capacity among this family of MOFs.

As shown above, we are looking for an ideal system of a stepwise synthesis of MOFs that can achieve not only design and control but also the functionalization of both SBUs and length-adjustable organic ligands while keeping the same framework topology. The four-connected diamond- oid network plays an important role in MOFs.[12] Metal–or- ganic materials first appeared on the scene when it was real- ized that the geometric features of tetrahedral cations could be used to design four-connected diamondoid networks[10] by simply bonding the metal cations to linear bifunctional organic ligands. We will use the predesigned tetrahedral MBB (TMBB) and a series of tetratopic ligands with func- tional groups and adjustable lengths to obtain the function- alization of a diamondoid MOFs system by using a stepwise synthesis strategy under solvothermal conditions. After care- ful consideration, we chose the nanoscale pentanuclear metal clusters [Zn5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(btz)6ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)] (TMBB-1), [Zn5- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dme-btz)6Cl4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2] (TMBB-2), and [Zn5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(me-btz)6Cl4- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2] (TMBB-3) (btz=benzotriazole, dme-btz=5,6-dime- thylbenzotriazole, me-btz=5-methylbenzotriazole, Figure 1 and Scheme S8 in the Supporting Information) as initial re- action precursors. We also deliberately designed a series of tetratopic ligands with functional groups and adjustable lengths (namely, H4L1, H4L2, H4L3, H4L4, H4L5, and H4L6, Figure 1 and Scheme S9 in the Supporting Information) as organic linkers. These precursors and ligands were chosen based on the following considerations: 1) The tetrahedral MBBs can be modified by changing the functional groups of btz to readily obtain functionalized MBBs. 2) The MBBs have the advantage of being readily soluble in some organic solvents while retaining their original structures according to previous literature,[4,8a] to ensure the feasibility of the sub- sequent cluster framework formation. 3) The tetratopic li- gands with functional groups and adjustable length show tet- rahedral coordination geometry, which facilitates the forma- tion of a diamondoid network and functionalization of MOFs. Fortunately, we have obtained a family of microporous di- amondoid MOFs (DMOF-n, n=1–15) (Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information) based on single-crystal X-ray structural and PXRD data, which are in agreement with our prior expectations. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples of MOFs based on functionalized MBBs and length-extendable and functional organic linkers by a stepwise synthesis strategy. Moreover, with the increase of the length of the organic linker, the degrees of interpenetra- tion have been regulated in the diamondoid topological MOFs system. The results of N2 and H2 gas adsorption show that their surface areas and hydrogen uptake capacities are not linear, but are determined by the most optimal combina- tion of functional groups, interpenetration, and free volume in this system. Results and Discussion Single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed that TMBB-1 or 2 consists of five Zn cations and six deprotonated btz ligands or their derivatives. The pentanuclear metal cluster shows a tetrahedral structure, in which four Zn2+ ions are located at each vertex of the tetrahedron and the fifth Zn2+ ion inlays the center with distorted octahedral coordination ge- ometry. Each Zn2+ ion at the apical positions bears a chelat- ing nitrate or Cl group (Figure 1 and Figure S1 in the Sup- porting Information). Comparison of the experimental PXRD pattern of as-synthesized TMBB-3 with the simulat- ed diffraction pattern of TMBB-2, the very high degree of correspondence between the patterns indicates that the bulk material has the same structure as TMBB-2 (Figure S23 in the Supporting Information). Isostructural [Zn5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(btz)6(L1)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)] (DMOF-1), [Zn5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bm- btz)6(L1)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)] (DMOF-2) and [Zn5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m-btz)6(L1)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)] (DMOF-3) have been obtained based on TMBB-n and tet- ratopic ligand H4L1 in DMF. DMOF-1 and DMOF-2 crystal- lize in the monoclinic space group C2/c and DMOF-3 crys- tallizes in the triclinic space group P1¯. As expected, all ni- trate or Cl groups that were bonded to the apical sites of TMBB-n were replaced by (L1)4. The asymmetric unit con- tains one pentanuclear metal cluster (named SBU-n), which is TMBB-n losing anions, one deprotonated (L1)4 ligand and one coordinated water molecule. Each SBU is connect- ed by four carboxylate ligands (L1)4 to be a 4-connected node, and each (L1)4 connects four SBUs, for which each carboxylic group binds to one SBU. Such connectivity leads to a highly porous extended 3D framework with a typically dia network. Further study into the nature of this architec- Scheme 1.

The above-mentioned results encouraged us to expand our studies to construct targeted networks based on func- tional and length-extendable organic linkers. When using longer H4L4 and H4L6 tetratopic ligands instead of the H4L1 ligand, for which the corresponding length increases from 8.5 to 10.6 and 12.7 , respectively (the distance is between the central C atom and the O atom of carboxyl group, Scheme S9 in the Supporting Information), DMOF-9 to 11 and DMOF-13 to 15 with the same framework topology were obtained. As noted previously for DMOF-1, DMOF-9, DMOF-11, and DMOF-13 all crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2/c. As anticipated, their structures are com- Figure 1.

Xu et al. posed of pentanuclear zinc clusters with different btz ligands (or its derivatives) that are joined through long deprotonat- ed (L4)4 and (L6)4 ligands, and again consist of similar dia frameworks. With the increase in the length of the organic ligands, the longest dimensions of cages change largely from 35.036 (DMOF-1) to 38.016 (DMOF-9) and 50.348  (DMOF-13) (Figure 1 and Figures S6–8 and S21 in the Sup- porting Information). Four such independent networks inter- penetrate to generate a fourfold interpenetrating dia frame- work architecture in DMOF-9, DMOF-11, and DMOF-13 (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information), which is consis- tent with the suggestion by Champness, Schçder, and co- workers that the longer ligands lead to a greater degree of interpenetration in the same topology.[14] The PXRD data of DMOF-10 and DMOF-14/15 are in good agreement with DMOF-9 and DMOF-13, respectively, which demonstrates that DMOF-10, DMOF-14, and DMOF-15 have the similar fourfold interpenetrating dia framework as DMOF-9 and DMOF-13 except the different functional groups of btz (Fig- ure S24 in the Supporting Information). When using the similar ligand H4L3 with a naphthyl group instead of H4L4, DMOF-7 and DMOF-8 [Zn15ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bme- btz)18(L3)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2] (DMOF-8) were isolated based on TMBB-1 and TMBB-2. DMOF-8 crystallizes in the chiral space group C2. The asymmetric unit contains 3/2 pentanu- clear metal clusters, 3/2 deprotonated (L3)4 ligands and two coordinated water molecules (Figure 1 and Figures S9 and S10 in the Supporting Information). The longest dimension between the centers of the two pentanuclear zinc clusters is 38.685  in the dia cages, which is similar to DMOF-9 (38.016 ) (Figure S21 in the Supporting Information). It is interesting that DMOF-8 is a threefold interpenetrating dia network, which is different from the fourfold interpenetra- tion in DMOF-9 and DMOF-11. The reason may be due to the larger steric hindrance from the naphthyl group of H4L3 than in H4L4, which is appropriate for the critical condition of interpenetrating change (Figure S5 in the Supporting In- formation). The experimental PXRD pattern of as-synthe- sized DMOF-7 matches the simulated DMOF-8 powder dif- fraction pattern, indicating that the microcrystal of DMOF- 7 has the same topological structure as DMOF-8 (Figure S24 in the Supporting Information). The organic linkers H4L2 and H4L5 with functional me- thoxy groups[15] were used to synthesize functionalized MOFs. [Zn5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(btz)6(L2)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2] (DMOF-4), [Zn5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dme- btz)6(L2)] (DMOF-5), [Zn5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(me-btz)6(L2)] (DMOF-6), and DMOF-12 were successfully obtained based on different TMBBs in the similar solvothermal synthesis conditions as for DMOF-1. Similar to DMOF-1, isostructural DMOF-4 to 6 all crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2/c and also have twofold interpenetrating dia frameworks (Figure 1 and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). However, the unit-cell parameters of DMOF-4 are different from those of DMOF-1; the asymmetric unit of DMOF-4 contains half of a pentanuclear metal cluster (SBU-1), half of a deprotonated (L2)4 ligand and one coordinated water molecule. The asymmetric units of DMOF-5/6 are similar to DMOF-2/3 except with (L2)4 instead of (L1)4 and the absence of coor- dinated water molecules (Figure 1 and Figures S11–13 and S21 in the Supporting Information). Most importantly, DMOF-5 and 6 have been successfully synthesized with the functionalization of both SBUs and organic linkers in one crystalline framework. The successful isolation of these com- pounds demonstrates a rational strategy for functionaliza- tion of MOFs, with which we can carefully select and effec- tively combine different functional groups from SBUs and organic linkers to synthesize targeted functionalized MOFs. The PXRD data of DMOF-12 are in good agreement with DMOF-9, which demonstrates that DMOF-12 has a similar fourfold interpenetrating dia framework as DMOF-9 except for the functional methoxy groups (Figure S24 in the Sup- porting Information). The family of microporous DMOF-n was successfully ach- ieved, which proves that we can design and control this system by using a stepwise synthesis strategy. To further confirm our viewpoint, as a representative of this system, we used btz ligands and Zn2+ ions as raw materials instead of TMBB-1 to synthesize DMOF-1 with the same stoichiome- try by using a one-pot reaction method. We obtained two compounds: one was a small amount of DMOF-1, and the other was 4,6-connected self-penetrating topological MOF- 01. The asymmetric unit of MOF-01 contains three depro- tonated btz ligands, four Zn atoms and 3/2 deprotonated (L1)4 ligands. Compared with DMOF-1, the SBU of MOF- 01 consists of three deprotonated btz ligands and four Zn atoms, which is different from the tetrahedral SBU-1 in DMOF-1 that contains six deprotonated btz ligands and five Zn atoms (Figures S14–16 in the Supporting Information). These experimental results indicate that the stepwise syn- thetic routes using TMBB can be easily controlled to obtain the targeted MOFs whereas it is difficult or uncontrollable with the one-pot reaction method (Figure 2). Figure 2. Stepwise and one-pot reaction methods for the synthesis of DMOF-n. Chem. Eur. J. 2012, 18, 8076 – 8083  2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 8079 FULL PAPER Tailor-Made Metal–Organic Frameworks The common nature of DMOF-n is that only two of the four hands from the tetratopic ligand link SBUs to form an infinite helical chain in one single diamondoid net. In two- fold interpenetrating compounds DMOF-1 to 6, two infinite helical chains from two individual diamondoid nets with the same chirality entangle each other to form a double helical unit (Figure S17 in the Supporting Information). In three- fold interpenetrating DMOF-8, three infinite helical chains from individual diamondoid nets show the same chirality and one chain enwinds simultaneously the other two helical chains that are arranged in parallel without intertwinement to form a special triple-stranded helix, which is different from conventional triple-stranded helices and a molecular braid reported recently[15] (Figures S18–S20 in the Support- ing Information). In DMOF-9, DMOF-11, and DMOF-13, four such helical chains from four individual dia nets are di- vided into two groups; each group is composed of a pair of non-intertwined helices of opposite helicity. Two groups of non-intertwined double helices are interwoven in such a way that the openings generated by one group of helices are alternately penetrated by two helices of the other group, thus resulting in an inextricable quadruple-stranded braid (Figures S19 and S20 in the Supporting Information). This peculiar entangled topology in MOFs was only reported re- cently.[8a] Furthermore, compared with the size of the adamantanoid cage in DMOF-n, we find that the degrees of interpenetra- tion are dependent on the shortest distances of cages, which are less than 28.972  in DMOF-1 to 6 showing a twofold interpenetrating dia framework, equal to 34.806  in DMOF-8 with threefold interpenetration, and larger than 36.494  in DMOF-9, 11, and 13 showing fourfold inter- penetrating networks (Figures S5 and S21 in the Supporting Information). Despite the interpenetration, the frameworks of DMOF-n remain microporous and have free porosities that are occupied by crystallographically unresolved solvent molecules. The space-filling models of DMOF-n along the different directions exhibit those feature of microporous ma- terials. DMOF-1 has microporous channels (about 48 2, the van der Waals radii are excluded) viewed along the b axes. The sizes of micropores are approximately 56 and 44/815 2 (the van der Waals radii are excluded) in threefold interpenetrating DMOF-8 and fourfold interpene- trating DMOF-11/13 viewed along the c-axis, respectively (Figure S22 in the Supporting Information). PLATON[17] analysis showed that the highest porosity is 66.4% in DMOF-1 and the lowest is 49.2% in DMOF-11, owing to the influence of different functional groups and the degrees of interpenetration in DMOF-n (Table S3 in the Supporting Information). The porosities of DMOF-n make their frameworks possi- ble for use in gas storage, and provide us with the chance to study the influence of the functional groups of the MBBs and organic linkers, and interpenetration on gas storage. The N2 sorption isotherms of DMOF-n at 77 K show charac- teristic type I behavior for microporous materials with a slight hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption, which can be explained by the dynamic feature and cage effect of the frameworks (Figure 3 and Figures S25–27 in the Supporting Information).[18] The H2 uptake capacity of two- fold interpenetrating DMOF-1 to 6 is 1.06, 0.69, 0.88, 0.59, 0.84, and 1.28 wt% (77 K, 1 bar), respectively. The trend of H2 uptake capacity is consistent with the change of their N2 adsorption amounts and surface areas in DMOF-1 to 6. The H2 adsorption capacity of DMOF-5 (0.84 wt%) and DMOF- 6 (1.28 wt%) with functional methoxy groups is higher than DMOF-2 (0.69 wt%) and DMOF-3 (0.88 wt%) without me- thoxy groups, respectively. The N2 adsorption amount of DMOF-7 (142.7 cm3g1) is higher than DMOF-8 (110.5 cm3g1) in the 3-fold interpenetrating framework, whereas it presents opposite results in the H2 uptake capaci- ty (DMOF-8, 1.02 wt% and DMOF-7, 0.84 wt%) (Fig- ure S28 in the Supporting Information). It is assumed that methyl groups favor H2 adsorption. The H2 uptake capacity is 0.55, 0.48, 0.74, and 0.30 wt% in 4-fold interpenetrating DMOF-9 to 12 based on the similar length of H4L4 and H4L5, respectively. Relative to their low BET surface areas (179, 43, 120, and 2 m2g1), the H2 adsorption capacity is gratifying, indicating that the catenation is beneficial to H2 loading at low pressure.[19] The H2 gas sorption isotherms for 4-fold interpenetrating DMOF-13 to 15 reveal that the H2 adsorption capacity of 15 (0.98 wt%) is higher than those of 13 (0.89 wt%) and 14 (0.76 wt%), which is consistent with the change of their surface areas. Among DMOF-n, DMOF- 6 with the functionalization of both SBUs and organic link- ers exhibits the highest BET and Langmuir surface areas (971 and 1106 m2g1), and H2 adsorption amount (142.9 m3g1, 1.28 wt%). For the DMOFs constructed from the organic linkers with the same length, the H2 adsorption capacity of DMOF based on TMBB-3 with one methyl group is higher than those based on TMBB-1 and TMBB-2 except for DMOF-3, which is lower than that of DMOF-1. From the N2 and H2 adsorption results, it is obvious that the surface areas and hydrogen uptake capacities are deter- mined by the most optimal combination of functional groups from SBUs and organic linkers, interpenetration, and free volume in the system.[20] Bearing this in mind, we may carefully select and effectively combine functional groups of SBUs and organic linkers to improve hydrogen uptake (Fig- ure 3and Table S3 and Figures S25–32 in the Supporting In- formation). Conclusion A family of microporous diamondoid MOFs was synthesized based on functionalized MBBs and length-extendable organ- ic linkers with functional groups by using a stepwise synthe- sis strategy. As expected, we successfully achieved not only design and control to synthesize the MOFs but also the functionalization of both SBUs and organic linkers in the same MOFs for the first time. Moreover, with the increase in length of the organic linker, the degrees of interpenetra- tion were regulated with the framework topology remaining www.chemeurj.org  2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In addition, the results of N2 and H2 adsorption show that the surface areas and hydrogen uptake capacities are determined by the most optimal combination of func- tional groups, interpenetration, and free volume in the system. DMOF-6 with the functionalization of both SBUs and ligands exhibits the highest surface area and H2 adsorp- tion capacity among this family of MOFs. With the stepwise synthesis strategy, as a general approach, rational choices of predesigned MBBs with different geometric polyhedra and functional organic linkers should lead to the discovery of abundant targeted porous materials with diverse characteris- tics in the near future.

X-ray crystallography: Single-crystal X-ray data of TMBB-1, TMBB-2, and DMOF-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, and MOF-01 were recorded by using a Bruker Apex CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated MoKa radiation (l=0.71073 ) at T=293 K. Absorption corrections were applied by using a multiscan technique. All the structures were solved by the direct method of SHELXS-97 and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques using the SHELXL-97 program within WINGX. The solvent molecules are highly disordered, and attempts to locate and refine the solvent peaks were unsuccessful. Contributions to scattering due to these solvent molecules were removed using the SQUEEZE rou- tine of PLATON; structures were then refined again using the data gen- erated. Crystal data are summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Infor- mation.

Materials and Instrumentation Chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was carried out with an X-ray diffractometer of Rigaku, Rint 2000. The FT-IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the range 4000-400 cm-1 on a Mattson Alpha-Centauri spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer TG-7 analyzer heated from room temperature to 600 ºC at a ramp rate of 5 °C/min under nitrogen. The N2 and H2 sorption measurements were performed on automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (Belsorp mini II). Before gas adsorption measurements, the sample was immersed in methanol for 24 h, and the extract was decanted. Fresh methanol was subsequently added, and the crystals were allowed to stay for an additional 24 h to remove the nonvolatile solvents (DMF/DEF and NMP). The sample was collected by decanting and treated with dichloromethane similarly to remove methanol solvents. After the removal of dichloromethane by decanting, the sample was activated by drying under a dynamic vacuum at room temperature overnight. Before the measurement of gas sorption, the sample was dried again by using the ‘outgas’ function of the surface area analyzer for 24 h at 90 ºC. S2 S2.

A white solid of dimethyl 4,4'-(2-((2-methoxy-4- (methoxycarbonyl)phenox-y)methyl)-2-((4-(methoxycarbonyl)phenoxy)methyl)propane -1,3-diyl)bis(oxy)dibenzoate formed immediately, which was isolated by filtration in 95% yield after drying in vacuum. The second step: In a round bottom flask, dimethyl 4,4'-(2-((2-methoxy-4- (methoxycarbonyl)phenoxy)methyl)-2-((4-(methoxycarbonyl)phenoxy)methyl)propane- 1,3-diyl)bis(oxy)dibenzoate (7.02 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (150 mL) and a solution of KOH (11.22 g, 200 mmol) in H2O (100 mL) was added. This mixture was refluxed for 12 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the THF was evaporated and the resulting water phase was acidified with conc. HCl until no further precipitate was detected. The white solid 4,4'-(2,2-bis((4- carboxyphenoxy)methyl)propane-1,3-diyl)bis(oxy)dibenzoic acid (H4L1) was collected S3 by filtration, washed with water and dried in vacuum (5.54 g, 90%).

The space-filling models of the two-fold, three-fold and four-fold interpenetration in DMOF-1, DMOF-8 and DMOF-9/13, respectively. Despite the interpenetration, the frameworks of DMOF-n remain micropores and free porosities that are occupied by crystallographically unresolved solvent molecules. The space-filling models of DMOF-n along the different directions exhibit those feature of microporous materials. DMOF-1 has microporous channels (about 4 × 8 Å2, the van der Waals radii are excluded) viewed along the b axes. The sizes of micropores are approximately 5 × 6 Å2 and 4 × 4 Å2 / 8 × 15 Å2 (the van der Waals radii are excluded) in three-fold interpenetrating DMOF-8 and four-fold interpenetrating DMOF-11/13 viewed along the c-axis, respectively.
