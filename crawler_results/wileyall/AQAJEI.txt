Three new cpt-metal complexes of different topology struc- tures were synthesized by solvothermal methods [Hcpt = 4-(4-carboxy- phenyl)-1,2,4-triazole]. The structure of [Mn(cpt)2·2H2O] (1) is essen- tially 0D monomeric, but extended into a 2D supramolecular network through cross-linking hydrogen bonds. In [Cu(cpt)(OH)·2H2O]·2H2O (2), the hydroxo groups as well as cpt ligands join the copper ions into an infinite polymeric [Cu(μ-cpt)(μ-OH)] chain, which is intercon- Introduction The interest in metal-organic frameworks (MOF) is rapidly increasing because of their intriguing structures and wide po- tential applications as functional materials.[1–11] Promising re- sults were achieved and startling applications are being devel- oped, however, the rational design and synthesis of coordination polymers with unique structure and function still remain a long-term challenge. The self-assembly process of coordination polymer is frequently influenced by various fac- tors such as medium, the nature of the organic ligands, pH value of solution, temperature, the nature of metal ions, coordi- nation arrangement, stereochemistry, and number of coordina- tion donors provided by organic ligands.[12–18] Among them, the nature of the organic ligand has a large impact on the build- ing of coordination polymers with novel structures. So, it is important to choose a suitable organic linker that can be much more effective to design metal-organic frameworks. The choice of 4-(4-carboxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazole (Hcpt) is based on following considerations: (1) the difference of the asymmetrical coordination sites based on the carboxyl and tri- azolyl functional group, which easily results in the formation of different topologies, (2) a rigid backbone, which is helpful to construct a stable metal-organic framework, (3) the rotation * Dr. J.

The complex [Zn(cpt)2]·0.5DMF·CH3CH2OH (3), which crystallizes in a 3D open framework with fourfold interpen- etrated diamondoid network topology, represents the first 3D structure based on cpt anions. The structure differences demonstrate that the reaction metal ions have an important effect on the structures of these complexes. around the C–C bond among the triazolyl ring, the benzene ring, and the carboxyl group will improve the coordination modes of Hcpt ligand, and (4) a bidentate-bridging coordina- tion mode similar to the 1,2,4-triazole ring results in the short distance of metal–metal.[19–22] Taking all these factors into con- sideration, we believe that Hcpt will be an ideal ligand for constructing novel metal-organic hybrid complexes. In 2005, Guo reported the first 0D monomeric cobalt com- plex of Hcpt, in which only one nitrogen atom of triazole ring of cpt– was involved in the coordination to the cobalt atom.[23] Three 0D isomorphous monomeric complexes (with copper, cadmium, and cobalt) based on the ligand Hcpt were reported by Lukashuk et al. in 2007, in which only the carboxylate oxy- gen atoms of cpt– were involved in the coordination with the metal atom.[24] Recently, three 0D isomorphous lanthanide complexes with cubane-shaped moieties were reported, in which a new coordination mode of cpt– was found.[25] The aforementioned results show that investigations on the coordi- nation chemistry of Hcpt are still in their early stages and more systematic research is needed in order to get a better under- standing of its coordination abilities. The present study investigated the effect of the reaction metal ions on the formation of different topology structures constructed by Hcpt ligand. Herein we report the synthesis and the crystal structures of three new coordination complexes [Mn(cpt)2·2H2O] (1), [Cu(cpt)(OH)·2H2O]·2H2O (2), [Zn(cpt)2]·0.5DMF·CH3CH2OH (3), as well as the reported complex [Co(cpt)2·2H2O] (4) [Hcpt = 4-(4-carboxyphenyl)- 1,2,4-triazole and DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide]. Com- plexes 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all obtained under solvothermal condi- tions. Isomorphous complexes 1 and 4 both display 0D struc- tures, however, complex 4 was already reported.[24] Complex 2 displays 1D chain topology constructed by Cu(H2O)2 2+ cati- J.-F. Song et al. ARTICLE ons, OH– ions and cpt anions. Complex 3 with large cavity exhibits fourfold interpenetrated diamondoid network topol- ogy. Experimental Section Materials and Methods All chemicals and solvents purchased were of reagent grade and used without further purification except Hcpt, which was prepared accord- ing to a literature procedure.[26] Elemental analysis (C, H, N) was performed with a Perkin–Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. IR spectra were measured with a Perkin– Elmer Spectrum One FT–IR spectrometer using KBr pellets. Thermo- gravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed with a Perkin–Elmer TGA-7000 thermogravimetric analyzer under flowing air at a tempera- ture ramp rate of 10 °C·min–1. The fluorescence spectrum of complex 3 was obtained with a LS 55 florescence/phosphorescence spectropho- tometer at room temperature. Syntheses of Complexes 1–3 [Mn(cpt)2·2H2O] (1): A solution of Hcpt (9.5 mg, 0.05 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) containing triethylamine (28 μL, 2 mmol) was directly mixed with a solution of MnCl2·4H2O in water (1 mL, 0.10 mol·L–1) at room temperature in a 15 mL beaker. 3 m HNO3 was added until the mixture became clear; afterwards, ethanol (2 mL) was added. The resulted colorless solution was transferred and sealed in a 25 mL Tef- lon-lined stainless steel reactor, and heated at 85 °C for 72 h. Upon cooling to room temperature, the pale pink crystals were filtered and washed with DMF and ethanol. Yield 75 % (based on Hcpt).

Crystal Structure Determination The crystal structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffrac- tion. The reflection data were collected with a Bruker SMART CCD area-detector diffractometer (Mo-Kα radiation, graphite monochroma- tor) at room temperature with ω-scan mode. Empirical adsorption cor- rection was applied to all data using SADABS program. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELXTL 97 software.[27] Non-hydrogen atoms were re- fined anisotropically.

Different metal salts such as MnCl2·4H2O, CuSO4·5H2O, ZnCl2·4H2O, CoCl2·6H2O, 3CdSO4·8H2O, or NiCl2·6H2O were added to Hcpt under mixed DMF/CH3CH2OH/H2O conditions at 85 °C. The 0D complexes containing cobalt, cadmium, or manganese ions were easily obtained, however, the corresponding com- plexes with higher dimensions were difficult to obtain. The three complexes were confirmed to be isomorphous by infrared spectroscopy (Figure S1) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Moreover, the yields may depend on the amount of triethylam- ine of reaction system, but the reaction was not significantly affected. The highest yields were achieved when the amount of triethylamine is 28 μL. Only unidentified green powders were obtained when cobalt, cadmium, or manganese ions were replaced by NiII ions. When MnCl2·4H2O was substituted by CuSO4·5H2O or ZnCl2·4H2O, complexes 2 or 3 were obtained. Crystal Structures Crystal Structure of Complex 1 X-ray crystallography reveals that complex 1 with 0D topol- ogy structure is isomorphous to the previously reported com- plexes constructed by the first-transition metal (copper) and cpt anions.[24] Complex 1 is composed of one MnII ion, two deprotonated cpt anions, and two coordinated water molecules (Figure 1a). The manganese atom with a slightly distorted oc- tahedral arrangement, where the basal plane is occupied by four carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O1a, O2, and O2a) from J.-F. Song et al. ARTICLE two chelating cpt– ligands, lies on a crystallographic inversion center, and two symmetry equivalent oxygen atoms of water molecules (O1w and O1wa) in axial positions forms a slightly distorted octahedral arrangement. The axial Mn–O1w bond length [d(Mn–O1w) = 2.143(2) Å] is slightly shorter than the equatorial Mn–O bond lengths [d(Mn–O1) = 2.205(2) and d(Mn–O4) = 2.224(2) Å]. The corresponding bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2, they further confirm the distorted octahedral arrangement of the manganese atom. In complex 1, the cpt– coordinates with MnII in a O,O-chelating mode, how- ever, the nitrogen atoms of the 1,2,4-triazole groups of cpt ani- ons are not coordinated to the metal atoms, similar to the re- ported coordination mode of cpt–.[24] Figure 1. (a) Coordination environment of manganese. (b) 2D supra- molecular layer along the ac plane constructed by hydrogen bonds in complex 1. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Each water molecule in complex 1 is involved in two inter- molecular O–H···O hydrogen bonds with two uncoordinated nitrogen atoms of the 1,2,4-triazole groups of cpt anions (N1 and N2) from two neighboring molecules to generate a 2D supramolecular structure (Figure 1b), in which two water mol- ecules and two triazole groups form an six-membered ring. The π–π interactions between cpt– stabilize the 2D supramolec- ular layer (face-to-face distance of 3.4924 Å and offset angle of 11.33°). The corresponding hydrogen bonding parameters are summarized in Table 3. Crystal Structure of Complex 2 The asymmetric unit of complex 2 contains half a CuII ion, half a μ2-cpt– anion, half a OH– ion, a coordinated water and a lattice water molecule. Each copper atom adopts a slightly distorted octahedral arrangement, where the basal plane is oc- cupied by two nitrogen atoms (N1) from two symmetry equiv- alent cpt– ligands and two oxygen atoms (O2 and O2a) from two symmetry equivalent OH– anions, and the axial positions are occupied by two symmetry equivalent oxygen atoms from coordinated water molecules (O1w) (Figure 2). Due to Jahn– Teller effect of d9 configuration, the distance of Cu–O1w (Cu– O1w = 2.536 Å) is longer than the other Cu–O distances. The 592 www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2011, 589–595 corresponding bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2, which further confirms the distorted octahedral arrangement of CuII in 2. In 2, the cpt– ligand coordinates with the CuII atoms in a μ2-N,N-bridging mode, which is reported for the first time. Figure 2. View of the infinite polymeric [Cu(μ-cpt)(μ-OH)] chain in complex 2. The copper atoms are joined into an infinite polymeric chain by the μ2-hydroxo groups together with μ2-cpt– along the b axis (Figure 2). It’s noteworthy that the coordinated water mol- ecules (O1w) are interconnected into a 1D water chain through O–H···O hydrogen bonds (O1w–H1wb···O1w) (Figure 3). The 1D water chains and 1D Cu(OH) chains are interconnected into a 2D puckered layer, in which another hydrogen atom (H1wa) is outstretched and acts as hydrogen-bond donor. The 2D layers are joined into a 3D supramolecular network by O1w–H1wa···O1 hydrogen bonds, with two kinds of different oriented channels of dimension 12.67 × 4.46 Å2. Interestingly, O2w and O3w reside in two kinds of different oriented chan- nels, respectively (Figure 4). Figure 3. View of the 2D supramolecular puckered layer constructed by 1D water chains and 1D Cu(OH) chains in complex 2. Cpt– ions are omitted for clarity. According to the Cambridge Structural Database (release 5.31), we found that dozens of complexes containing the frag- cpt-Metal Complexes Displaying 0D, 1D, and 3D Topology Figure 4. 3D supramolecular network in complex 2. ment [Cu(μ-L)(μ-X)] were reported,[29–33] L represents substi- tuted N-containing heterocycle molecules coordinated through the N–N bond in a bidentate bridging manner similarly to 2, and X is a simple bridging group such as OH, F, Cl, I, however, to the best of our knowledge, L, which plays a crucial role in the construction of the fragment [Cu(μ-L)(μ-X)], is not an ani- onic organic ligand but a neutral organic molecule. So, the fragment [Cu(cpt)(OH)] constructed by anionic N-containing heterocycle molecules coordinated by N–N bonds in a biden- tate bridging manner was reported for the first time. In addi- tion, compared with the reported similar complex, [Cu(μ-L)(μ- OH)(H2O)2]·Cl (5), the dihedral angle between the benzene ring and the triazole ring in complex 2 is smaller than that of complex 5 (3.01° for complex 2, and 90.00° for complex 5 [L = 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazole]).[29] Crystal Structure of Complex 3 Complex 3 exhibits a 3D open framework with fourfold in- terpenetrated diamondoid network topology and crystallizes in space group Pbcn. The asymmetric unit of complex 3 contains one ZnII ion, two kinds of deprotonated cpt– anions, one unco- ordinated ethanol molecules and half a DMF molecule. Each zinc ion adopts distorted tetrahedral arrangement and is coordi- nated by two nitrogen atoms (N5 and N2) and two monoden- tate carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2 and O3) from four μ2-cpt– anions (Figure 5). The Zn–O/N bond lengths are in the range 1.942(5)–2.040(5) Å, and the corresponding O/N–Zn–O/N bond angles range from 95.1(2)° to 130.5(2)° (Table 3), which indicate distortion of the zinc tetrahedral arrangement. The dif- ference in the cpt– anions is the deviation of dihedral angle between the carboxyl plane and the benzene ring or the ben- zene ring and the triazole ring (the dihedral angle of the car- boxyl plane and the benzene ring is 41.34° for cpt– containing O1, and 40.62° for the other; the dihedral angle of the benzene ring and the triazole ring is 14.22° for cpt– containing O1, and 1.89° for the other). This difference results from the rotation around the C–C bond among the carboxyl plane, benzene ring and triazole ring. Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2011, 589–595 © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 593 Figure 5. Coordination environment of zinc in complex 3. Different from complexes 1 and 2 as well as the reported complexes based on the ligand Hcpt, cpt– adopts a new coordi- nation mode in complex 3: μ2-N, O-bridging mode. Each ZnII atom is connected by four cpt– bridging ligands, which consist of two kinds of cpt–, propagating into a 3D metal-organic framework with diamond topology (Figure 6). The intracage Zn···Zn distances are 13.22 and 12.18 Å, which indicate a sig- nificantly large void space of the diamondoid network. In the crystal structure, this void space is filled by a fourfold inter- penetration of the diamondoid network and solvent molecules (DMF and ethanol) (Figure 6). The adamantanoid cages are strongly compressed in the interpenetration direction along b axis. The interpenetration mode of the four independent nets in complex 3 is the so-called “normal” type for diamondoid frames, which belongs to class Ia.[34–38] Interestingly, there ex- ists in a fourfold interpenetration of the diamondoid network in complex 3, however, very larger void space is still formed. Calculation performed using PLATON reveals a total solvent- accessible volume equal to 2073.6 Å3 per unit cell, which counts for 39.1 % of the cell volume,[28] offering possibilities of gas adsorption and gas separation, etc. Figure 6.

TG Curves of Complexes 1–3 The thermal behaviors of complexes 1–3 were studied from 25 °C to 700 °C in air (Figure 7). The weight loss of complex J.-F. Song et al. ARTICLE 1, which occurred at 240 °C, is assigned to the loss of coordi- nated water. The total weight loss of complex 1 amounts to 82.34 % (calcd. 83.31 %). For complex 2, the first weight loss 9.73 % occurred in the range 85–142 °C and is attributed to the loss of lattice water. The second weight loss of 65.36 % from 142 °C to 450 °C corresponds to the loss of coordinated water and the decomposition of the organic component. The total weight loss of complex 2 is 75.09 % (calcd. 76.67 %), whereas for complex 3, the first loss is approximately 22.57 % in the range of 143–316 °C, corresponding to the weight loss of solvent molecules (ethanol and DMF). The second weight loss (58.93 %) occurred between 316 and 530 °C and is char- acteristic of the combustion of cpt– ligand. The total weight loss of complex 3 amounts to 81.50 % (calcd. 84.55 %). Figure 7. TGA curves of complexes 1–3. Fluorescence Spectrum of Complex 3 The photoluminescence spectra of complex 3 and the ligand Hcpt in the solid state are shown in Figure 8. Hcpt exhibits blue photoluminescence with an emission maximum at 468 nm Figure 8. Solid-state emission spectra for complex 3 as well as Hcpt ligand at room temperature. 594 www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2011, 589–595 upon excitation at 360 nm. Similarly, complex 3 also exhibits blue photoluminescence with an emission maximum at 485 nm upon excitation at 360 nm, respectively. A comparison of the photoluminescence spectra of Hcpt and complex 3 showed that the maximum emission wavelength of complex 3 is similar to that of the ligand Hcpt in terms of position and band shape. Therefore, the emission bands of complex 3 are mainly due to an intraligand emission state similar to the reported d10 metal complexes with N-donor carboxylate ligands.[39,40] The inten- sity increase of the luminescence for these complexes than their corresponding ligands may be attributed to the chelation of the ligand to the metal atom, which increases the rigidity of Hcpt and reduces the nonradiative relaxation process. Conclusions Three new cpt-Metal complexes displaying 0D, 1D, and 3D topologies were synthesized under solvothermal conditions. Analyses of synthetic conditions, crystal structures and coordi- nation modes of cpt– revealed that the reaction metal ions have important effects on the structure of these complexes and coor- dination modes of Hcpt ligand. This study revealed that more new coordination polymers or porous materials with high di- mension could be synthesized by using Hcpt. Further research for the construction of new architectures with more transition metals is underway in our laboratory. Complex 3 shows strong blue photoluminescence in the solid state at room temperature.
