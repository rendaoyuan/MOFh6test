Lee,[a] Young Hee Lee,[b, c] Dongwon Min,[a] and Young-Uk Kwon*[a, c] Introduction With the potential for tailor-made syntheses of sorption hosts with molecule-specific adsorption properties, various kinds of porous materials have been investigated.[1,2] Metal- organic frameworks (MOFs) are the most recently highlight- ed class of materials in this regard.[3–9] Unfortunately, MOFs often have structures with interpenetrated frameworks pro- ducing only small pores, especially when synthesized under hydrothermal conditions.[8] This has been considered as a major obstacle for endowing sorption properties to MOFs, and several solutions have been proposed to prevent the for- mation of the interpenetration structures.[4,5] In fact, most of the MOFs with accessible pores described in the literature have been synthesized from low-temperature reactions in nonaqueous media (i.e., diffusion reactions).[6–9] In most of the MOFs, the (potential) pore walls are formed by the hydrophobic parts of ligand molecules. We envisioned that these pores tend to be small to avoid the un- favorable contact with solvent water molecules under typical hydrothermal reaction conditions. Conversely, if there are hydrophobic molecules present during MOF formation, they may function as guests occupying the pores through hydro- phobic interactions with the ligands and consequently pro- mote the formation of large pores. With this idea in mind, we have explored such possibilities and found a novel MOF system that formed either an inclusion compound with ben- zene as a guest or a simple triply interpenetrated structure depending on whether benzene was present in the reaction mixture during the syntheses. The MOF from the benzene- containing reaction shows specific adsorption properties for benzene and cyclohexene as opposed to other ring com- pounds. Herein, the details of syntheses and characterization are reported. [a] Dr. E.-Y. Choi, K. Park, H. Kim, J.-H. Son, Prof. Dr. S. W. Lee, Prof. Dr. D. Min, Prof. Dr. Y.-U.

Abstract: In this paper, we report two metal–organic frameworks [Co3(ndc)3- (bipyen)1.5]·H2O (1) and [Co2(ndc)2(bi- pyen)]·C6H6·H2O (2) (bipyen=trans- 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene, H2ndc=2,6- naphthalenedicarboxylic acid). These compounds were both synthesized from identical hydrothermal reaction conditions except that benzene was added to the reaction for 2. Crystal structures show that the two com- pounds have triply interpenetrated three-dimensional frameworks and these frameworks have the same pri- mary structure of a two-dimensional network of interconnected [Co2- (O2CR)4/2] (R=naphthalene group) paddle-wheels and bridging bipyen li- gands. Both compounds have guest water molecules and, in addition, 2 has guest benzene molecules. Structural transformations of the host accompa- nied guest removal, which can be monitored by powder X-ray diffraction. N2 adsorption data of 2 show that there are two different types of pores corre- sponding to the benzene and water pores. Upon exposure to vapors of sev- eral organic molecules, the heat-treated sample of 2 adsorbs benzene and cyclo- hexene, but does not adsorb toluene, (o-, m-, and p-)xylenes, cyclohepta- triene, or cyclohexane.

Two of the three frameworks are generated by the paddle-wheels of Co1/Co2 and the third one by those of Co3. The two types of framework have essentially the same structure and the one of Co3 is shown in Figure 1b with a schematic drawing of the unit mesh to show the dimensions of the framework. The interpenetrated structure leaves three-dimensional interconnected channels between the neighboring frameworks of Co1/Co2, which are occupied by water molecules. When benzene was added to the reaction mixture and the other conditions were kept unchanged, the reaction produced a different MOF [Co2(ndc)2(bi- pyen)]·C6H6·H2O (2) that shows another triply interpenetrat- ed structure of the same primary framework as 1 (Figure 2).

J. 2004, 10, 5535 – 5540 5536 FULL PAPER The unit mesh is considerably distorted compared with that of 1. Because of the distortion, there are free volumes gen- erated between the frameworks that are occupied by lattice water and benzene molecules. Based on the crystallographic data and the van der Waals radii of atoms, the pore cross sections are calculated to be 4.3K4.3 L2 in 1 and 6.6K6.2 (benzene pore) and 4.4K3.5 L2 (water pore) in 2 (Figure 3). There are two papers concerning benzene-clathrated crystals in the literature, one about a one-dimensional MOF[9] and the other about an organic crystal with internal hydrogen bonds forming a network structure.[10] Although there are already many examples of MOFs with incorporated guest molecules, it is notable that most of them are from diffusion reactions in nonaqueous solvents under ambient pressures and low temperatures.[6,7] The guest molecules in these cases are either the solvent molecules or molecules that dissolve in the solvents. Both of the benzene- clathrated crystals mentioned above were also formed from low-temperature reactions in nonaqueous solvents. In con- trast, our compound 2 is formed by means of a hydrother- mal reaction using high temperature, high pressure, and water as the solvent. Because of these conditions, hydrother- mal reactions typically produce MOFs with densely packed structures or a high degree of interpenetration. In order to overcome this problem, we used a hydrophobic template. Although the incorporation of benzene molecules does not in- fluence the primary structure of the framework or the triple-in- terpenetration structure, it changes the structure and cre- ates pores. The two compounds show contrasting sorption properties for the guest molecules. Ther- mogravimetric analysis (TGA) data of 1 show that it loses lat- tice water at 100–1408C by 1.8% (calcd 1.6%). The TGA data of 2 show a benzene-loss step below 1108C by 10.1% (calcd 9.4%) and water-loss step at 3208C by 1.8% (calcd 1.93%) (Figure 4a). We have found that the two MOFs undergo structural transformations on removing the guest molecules, which can be readily monitored by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As can be seen in Figure 5a, the water molecules of 1 can be removed by heating at 2008C for 2 h, but they cannot be re- inserted by exposing the water-desorbed crystals to water vapor at room temperature for 48 h. The benzene molecules Figure 3. Immediate environments around the guests: a) water molecules in 1, b) water, and c) benzene molecules in 2. Figure 4. TGA curves of a) 2 and b) 2a. Figure 5.

KGaA, Weinheim 5537 Benzene-Templated Hydrothermal Synthesis of Metal–Organic Frameworks 5535 – 5540 of 2 can be removed by heating at 1808C for 1 hour or by vacuum treatment at room temperature, as can be seen by the TGA data (Figure 4b). However, this process can be re- versed by exposing the benzene-desorbed sample (hereafter 2a) to benzene vapor for 7 days at room temperature (Fig- ure 5b). In addition to the XRD data, this benzene-readsor- bed sample of 2a shows practically the same TGA curve as the original crystals of 2, suggesting that the benzene de- sorption–adsorption processes of 2 are reversible. The larger pore size and the more favorable host–guest interactions of 2 compared with 1 are probably the main reasons for the different sorption characteristics of the two compounds. The N2 adsorption isotherm of 2, taken at 77 K after evac- uation at 1008C and 104 Pa for 2 h, shows two pore-filling steps at P/P0<0.01 and P/P0=0.1 (Figure 6). The steep uptake at P/P0<0.01, due to monolayer adsorption on mi- cropore walls, can be assigned to the micropore filling of N2 into the benzene pores that have enhanced adsorbent–adsor- bate interactions. The second steep uptake at P/P0=0.1 is assigned to a block in the entrance of the water pores, since the size of the water pore is almost equal to that of an N2 molecule. A similar pore-blocking phenomenon has been re- ported for another MOF crystal with a small pore.[11] This almost vertical adsorption uptake at P/P0=0.1 also strongly suggests that the size of the water pore is very uniform. The “knees” of the isotherm at points A and B are very sharp, indicating that pore-size distributions of both pores are ex- tremely narrow. Using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Dubinin– Radushkevich methods on the isotherm data, we have calcu- lated the specific surface areas and micropore volumes of the benzene and water pores of 2. The larger surface area (254 m2g1) and volume (0.11 mLg1) of the benzene pore compared with those of the water pore (230 m2g1 and 0.07 mLg1) are consistent with the crystallographic pore di- mensions. However, their differences are not as large as is expected from the crystallographic data. Such discrepancies can be explained by the different packing densities of N2 within the two pores because of the incompatible dimen- sions of the adsorbate molecules and the pores. Through the structural change accompanying the sorption–desorption of the guest molecules, the change in the pore dimensions from those of the crystal structure 2 may also contribute to these discrepancies. We have also studied the sorption properties of 2a for other organic molecules. On exposing 2a to a vapor of cy- clohexene for 10 days at room temperature, we obtained an XRD pattern similar to that of 2 (Figure 5b). However, the increased background and broadened peaks indicate that the adsorption of cyclohexene may induce structural tension, probably because of the (slight) difference in the dimen- sions. On the contrary, similar experiments with toluene, (o-, m-, and p-) xylenes, cycloheptatriene, and cyclohexane did not change the XRD pattern of 2a. Clearly, these experi- ments demonstrate that 2a has selective adsorption proper- ties for benzene and cyclohexene as opposed to toluene, xy- lenes, cycloheptatriene, or cyclohexane. These results bear significant relevance to the petroleum industry, such as in the separation of benzene and toluene from crude oil or gas- oline, and the separation of benzene and cyclohexene from cyclohexane. The prevailing methods for these have been fractional-distillation techniques; the products are mixtures with a certain degree of benzene or cyclohexene enrich- ments, requiring repetitive operations.[12] There are a few re- ports of using zeolites for these purposes, but the separation by zeolites is based mainly on preference not selectivity of target adsorbents; that is, a small amount of toluene is always adsorbed along with benzene.[13,14] Although not so important in terms of industrial applications, the distinction of benzene from cyclohexane, which have close kinetic di- ameters of 5.85 and 6.0 L, respectively,[15] by 2a is unprece- dented by any other sorption host ever reported. Zeolites and reported porous MOFs have selective sorption proper- ties based on the size of the pore openings; any molecules of sizes smaller than a critical kinetic diameter can be adsor- bed. On the contrary, with the crystal structure of 2 in which benzene molecules are nested in the pores, we believe that the selectivity of 2a for benzene over toluene by adsorption arises from the size of the pore, a “final-state effect”, rather than the size of the pore opening. Similar high specificity in the clathration was discovered in other MOFs and this dis- crimination of the isomers in the clathration has been ap- plied to their separation.[16] The sorption properties of crystal 2a specific for benzene and cyclohexene might be explained in terms of tailor-made pore structures. That is, because the pores are formed around benzene templates, they have just the right size and shape only for benzene molecules and the right environment to have favorable p–p interactions with benzene molecules. Using this principle, we have also attempted to synthesize other MOFs with hydrophobic guests. Unfortunately, our preliminary experiments employing many different combi- nations of metal ions (Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+), dicar- boxylate ligands (H2ndc, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate, iso- phthalate, 4,4-oxybisbenzoicdicarboxylate, and terephtha- late), bi-functional amine or imine ligands (4,4-bipyridine, trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene, and pyrazine), and guest solvents (benzene, toluene, xylene, and naphthalene) all failed in producing the desired MOFs. Probably, the success- ful synthesis of such MOFs requires very stringent condi- Figure 6. N2 adsorption isotherm of 2 at 77 K. E 2004 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Nevertheless, it is highly possible, with suitably se- lected reagents, to obtain MOFs with hydrophobic templates and thus specific adsorption properties for a variety of guest molecules. Recently, we have found an MOF system that can incorporate naphthalene as a guest.[17] Conclusion In conclusion, we have demonstrated a novel strategy to synthesize an MOF that forms with a benzene template from a hydrothermal reaction and shows specific sorption characteristics for benzene and cyclohexene over other ring compounds. Our synthetic strategy employing hydrophobic molecules in the synthesis of an otherwise undesirable multi- ply interpenetrated MOF can be adopted to other MOF sys- tems to obtain novel MOFs with tailor-made pore structures and molecule-specific sorption properties. In general, the formation of two different MOFs depending on the solvent system in our study implies that even presently well-known MOF systems may have a new dimension of structural vari- ability by simply modifying the solvent composition. Experimental Section General Methods: All chemicals purchased were of reagent grades and used without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were performed on an EA1110 elemental analyzer. Fourier-Transform infrared spectra were obtained with a Nicolet 1700 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr disks dispersed with sample powders in the 4000–400 cm1 range. Ther- mal gravimetric analyses were conducted on a TA4000/SDT 2960 instru- ment in flowing N2 with a heating rate of 108Cmin1. X-ray powder dif- fraction data were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-RC diffractometer at 30 kV, 40 mA for CuKa, (l=1.5406 L) with a scan speed of 28min1 and a step size of 0.028 in 2q. The calculated XRPD patterns were produced by using the atoms program with the single crystal data.

Black crystals were obtained along with orange powdery materials of un- known nature. The crystals lose crystallinity in air due to the loss of ben- zene and so were kept in the mother liquor.

A crystal of 1 glued on a glass fiber and a crystal of 2 sealed in a capillary tube to prevent benzene loss were used for the data collections. The data were collected at 293(2) K using a Siemens P4 four circle diffractometer. The crystal structures were solved with the direct methods (SHELXS-97, Sheldrick, 1990) and refined anisotropically with a full-matrix least- squares procedure on Fo 2 (SHELXL-97, Sheldrick, 1997). The hydrogen atom positions were program generated and refined with a riding model. The final-difference Fourier maps show the largest peak and hole as 1.137 and 0.736 eL3, respectively, for 1 and the largest peak and hole as 0.968 and 0.401 eL3, respectively, for 2.
