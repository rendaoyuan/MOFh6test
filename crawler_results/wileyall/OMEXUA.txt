Four new transitional metal supramolecular architectures, [Zn(cca)(2,2'-bpy)]n·n(2,2'-bpy) (1), [Cu(cca)(2,2'-bpy)]n (2), [Zn(bpdc)(2,2'-bpy)(H2O)]n·0.5nDMF·1.5nH2O (3), and [Co(bpdc)(2,2'-bpy)(H2O)]n·nH2O (4) (H2cca = p-carboxycinnamic acid; H2bpdc = 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid; 2,2'-bpy = 2,2'-bipyri- dine) were synthesized by hydrothermal reactions and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analyses, and IR spectro- scopy. Although the metal ions in these four compounds are bridged Introduction The design and synthesis of supramolecular architectures are an attractive area of research, not only because of their fasci- nating crystal structures, but also because of their potential as functional materials.[1–5] Much attention has been focused on the self-assembly of supramolecular architectures by using non-covalent forces, which mainly focuses on hydrogen bonds and aromatic π–π stacking interactions.[6–9] The strengths of these interactions are moderate, falling between the extremes of strong covalent bonds and weak van der Waals forces. So supramolecular architectures hold flexibility, and allow for more predictable control over directional assemblies. The formation of supramolecular architectures is influenced by many factors, such as metal ions, organic ligands, solvent, and pH of the reaction. Among these factors, the selection of metal ions and organic ligands are the most important aspects. Transitional metal ions, for their low coordination number and stable coordination arrangement, have been extensively used to construct supramolecular architectures with interesting structures and desirable properties.[10–14] Polycarboxylic acid, especially dicarboxylic acid, for their excellent bridging capability and intriguing variety of coordination modes, is of great interest in supramolecular chemistry.[15–20] The introduc- tion of auxiliary ligands often effects the construction of supra- molecular architectures.

Both compounds have open- frameworks. extend the structures, whereas terminal auxiliary ligands usu- ally result in lower-dimensional structures. In this work, two kinds of linear dicarboxylic acid p-carboxycinnamic acid (H2cca) and 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (H2bpdc) were se- lected to react with transitional metal ions to form supramolec- ular architectures, respectively. 2,2'-Bipyridine (2,2'-bpy) was introduced into the reaction system as auxiliary ligand. Four new supramolecular architectures were obtained, including [Zn(cca)(2,2'-bpy)]n·n(2,2'-bpy) (1), [Cu(cca)(2,2'-bpy)]n (2), [Zn(bpdc)(2,2'-bpy)(H2O)]n·0.5nDMF·1.5nH2O (3), and [Co(bpdc)(2,2'-bpy)(H2O)]n·nH2O (4). Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of these four compounds. Results and Discussion Description of the Structures Compounds 3 and 4 are isostructural except that the guest molecules are free DMF/water, and water, separately. So only the structures of compounds 1, 2, and 3 will be discussed in detail. The crystallographic data for the four compounds are listed in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and bond angles in Table 2 and Table 3. [Zn(cca)(2,2'-bpy)]n·n(2,2'-bpy) (1) There is one crystallographically independent ZnII ion in compound 1. But the cca ligands are disordered, which leads to different coordination environments for the ZnII ions. Figure 1 shows one of them. Each ZnII ion is hexacoordinated by four oxygen atoms of two cca ligands and two nitrogen atoms of one 2,2'-bpy molecule, and the coordination arrangement can be described as distorted octahedron.

The ZnII ions are bridged by cca ligands to form 1D infinite zigzag chains. It’s important for the construction of a 3D supramolec- ular network that the 2,2'-bpy ligands are placed up and down the chains. In fact, all 2,2'-bpy ligands are parallel and there are π–π stacking interactions between the 2,2'-bpy ligands of adjacent chains (the face-to-face distance is 3.33 Å), as shown in Figure 2(a), which causes the formation of layers. These layers are packed straight, forming a 3D supramolecular net- work with channels. There are free 2,2'-bpy ligands enclosed in the channels [see Figure 2(b)]. All free 2,2'-bpy ligands are parallel to each other, and the nearest face-to-face distance is Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2011, 276–281 © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

[Cu(cca)(2,2'-bpy)]n (2) The coordination environment of the CuII ion in compound 2 is shown in Figure 3. Each CuII ion is strongly coordinated to two oxygen atoms [O(1) and O(3A)] of two cca ligands and two nitrogen atoms of one 2,2'-bpy ligand in an actually square-planar fashion. There is only a slight difference be- tween the bond lengths of Cu–O (1.951 Å) and Cu–N (1.972 Å). Other two carboxylate oxygen atoms [O(2) and O(4A)] also interact with the copper(II) ion, though rather weakly, occupying the axial fifth and sixth positions of an dis- torted octahedron.

Chem. 2011, 276–281 O(4A) are 2.634 Å and 2.520 Å, respectively, which is in agreement with the corresponding values (≥2.770 Å) for all other related compounds with analogous Cu–O units.[21] So the octahedron can be viewed as an elongated one because of the Jahn–Teller effect. The coordination number can be de- scribed as “4 + 2” for the copper(II) ion.[22] In compound 2, Figure 3.

Open Frameworks with Linear Dicarboxylic Acid, and 2,2'-Bipyridine the cca ligands adopt a bis(chelating-bridging bidentate) mode and link copper(II) ions into 1D infinite chains, as shown in Figure 4(a). The 2,2'-bpy ligands are placed up and down the chains. But they are not parallel, which is different to those in compound 1. There are two kinds of orientation and the dihe- dral angle between them is 94.6°. The face-to-face distance of two parallel 2,2'-bpy ligands is 3.50 Å, which indicates the existence of π–π stacking interactions and the formation of a 3D complicated supramolecular network [see Figure 4(b) and Figure 4(c)]. [Zn(bpdc)(2,2'-bpy)(H2O)]n·0.5nDMF·1.5nH2O (3) Figure 5 shows the coordination environment of the ZnII ion in compound 3. Each ZnII ion is located in a distorted octahe- dron and coordinated by three oxygen atoms of two bpdc li- gands, one oxygen atom of one aqua ligand and two nitrogen atoms of one 2,2'-bpy ligand. The bpdc ligands adopt two kinds of coordination modes, bis(monodentate) and bis(chelat- ing-bridging bidentate), just as in the CuII complexes,[23] linking ZnII ions into 1D infinite chains. All 2,2'-bpy ligands are parallel and there are π–π stacking interactions between the 2,2'-bpy ligands of adjacent chains (the face-to-face distance is 3.59 Å), similar to those in compound 1, which causes the layers too. But these layers are stacked with displacement, which leads to the formation of a 3D supramolecular network with channels [see Figure 6(a)]. O–H···O hydrogen bonds are observed between the aqua ligands and the carboxylate oxygen atoms (the O(5)–H(5A)···O(2), O···O distance 2.770 Å), which brings further stability for the network. There are free DMF and water molecules, which are alternatively arranged and con- nected by hydrogen bonds (O···O distance 2.673, 2.742, and 2.775 Å), forming a guest column in these channels, as shown in Figure 6(b). In compound 4, free water molecules occupy the channels and no guest column is formed. Thermogravimetric Analyses Compounds 1–4 are very stable in air at ambient temperature and almost insoluble in common solvents such as water, alco- hol, and acetone. In order to examine their thermal stability, we carried out thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of com- pounds 1, 3, and 4. Figure 7 shows the TG curves of the three Figure 5.

Al- though the metal ions in all these are bridged to form 1D infi- nite chains by linear dicarboxylic acid, different π–π stacking interactions exist between the chains, which results in the con- struction of different 3D supramolecular networks.

A semi-empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program.[24] The structures were solved by direct methods[25] and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELXS 97 and SHELXL 97 programs, respectively.[25, 26] Non-hy- drogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions.
