Two novel coordination polymers, [Cu(H2L)(bipy)(H2O)2]· H2O (1) and [Ni2(H2L)(bipy)2.5(H2O)6]·(H2L)·7H2O (2) with the V- shaped diphosphonate ligand (2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3-phenylene)bis- (methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4L) were synthesized via hydrother- mal reactions in the presence of auxiliary ligand 4,4-bipyridine.

It is well-known that MOFs are organic-inorganic hybrid materials constructed from the assembly of the organic ligands (such as carboxylate and phosphonate ligands) with metal or metal clusters, in which the ligands act as linkers and metal/metal clusters act as nodes.[7] Compared to the conventionally used carboxylate and pyridine based ligands, phosphonate ligands were less fre- quently reported in the construction of coordination polymers. This is mainly because that they form stronger bonds with metal atoms than carboxylate ligands which results in lower solubility and accordingly lead to the difficulty in forming sin- gle crystals for structural determination.[8] In addition, phos- phonic acid group contains three oxygen atoms capable of bonding to metals, so it is difficult to predict the coordination mode and deprotonation state of the ligand.[9] But these char- acteristics make many phosphonate ligands based coordination polymers exhibit impressive properties, such as the unusual topology,[10] and ultra high thermal stability[11] which are the main drawbacks of many carboxylate based coordination poly- mers.

Compound 1 crystallizes in the Pnma space group and compound 2 crystallizes in the P21212 space group. They display square-grid layer and bilayer two-dimensional net- work, respectively. balt(II) and magnesium(II) salts, Distler et al. synthesized sev- eral phosphonate-based coordination polymers with 1D chain, 2D layer, and 3D network structures. The cobalt complexes exhibited antiferromagnetic properties.[12] Based on linear aro- matic diphosphonate ligand, Cao et al. synthesized two iso- structural 3D metal diphosphonates M2O3PC6H4PO3)(H2O)2 [M = CoII or NiII], in which, each [CPO3] tetrahedron is con- nected to four [MO6] octahedral forming inorganic layer and the further linking of these layers by phenyl groups of the diphosphonate ligands resulting in a pillared layered struc- ture.[13] Besides, some coordination polymers based on other linear aliphatic or aromatic diphosphonic acid ligands with dif- ferent sizes and configurations were synthesized.[14] However, the V-shaped phosphonate ligands, which were constructed by the substitution on the meta-position of the phenyl ring form- ing an angle of about 120° between two phosphonate groups, have been seldom used before. Previous studies[15] show that the V-shaped ligands are apt to afford the zeolite like struc- tures, such as imidazole based ligands,[16] isophthalate substi- tuted ligands,[17] etc. In additional, for metal carboxylates, studies have also shown that the resulting molecular architec- ture could be tailored by altering the bridging angle and the size of the linker.[18] In the context of this, we designed and synthesized a V-shaped ligand, H4L (2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3-phen- ylene)bis(methylene) diphosphonic acid), and obtained two novel coordination polymers, [Cu(H2L)(bipy)(H2O)2]·H2O (1) and [Ni2(H2L)(bipy)2.5(H2O)6]·(H2L)·7H2O (2), by using this ligand and transition metal salts. The structures were deter- mined from single-crystal X-ray analysis. In addition, we fur- ther studied the infrared spectroscopic and thermogravimetric properties of these two novel coordination polymers. Results and Discussion Description of the Structures The following structures discussion is based on CIF files of complexes 1 and 2, and the final formulas of the two com- X. Lv, S. Tang, L. Li, X. Xu, X. Zhao ARTICLE plexes are further determined by elemental analyses, infrared spectra, and thermogravimetric studies. Structure of Compound 1 The X-ray crystallographic analysis indicates that compound 1 crystallizes in the Pnma space group and the structure shows a square-grid 2D layered network. The asymmetric unit in- cludes one CuII ion, one partly deprotonated H2L2– ligand, one 4,4-bipyridine, two coordinated water molecules, and one guest water molecule (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The coordination arrangement around the copper atom is between trigonal-bipyramidal and square-pyramidal structure (τ = 0.425).[3a,19] The axial positions are occupied by two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2A; A: –1/2+x, y, 3/2–z) from two different 4,4-bipyridine molecules and there are three oxygen atoms (O3, O3B, O1W; B: x, 1/2–y, z) of two phosphonate groups from two different H2L2– ligands and one aqua ligand in the equatorial positions. The bond lengths of Cu–O (phosphonate), Cu–O (water), and Cu–N are 1.940 Å, 2.174 Å and 2.022 Å, respectively. The torsion angles of O3–Cu1–O3B in the equa- torial plane and N1–Cu1–N2A in the axial plane are 176.0(3)° and 150.5(3)°, respectively (see Table S1, Supporting Infor- mation). All of these are comparable to those reported for the bond lengths of Cu–O, Cu–N, and the torsion angles of O–Cu–O and N–Cu–N by Muppidi et al.[20] Both phosphonate groups of the H2L2– ligand are singly protonated based on the requirement of charge balance and P–O bond lengths, and each diphosphonate ligand bridges two CuII ions. Each adjacent two CuO3N2 polyhedra are bridged by phos- phonate groups of H2L2– and generated an infinite line-chain along the b axis through Cu–O bonds. A two-dimensional square-grid layer (Figure 1a) is constructed by interconnecting the neighboring chains through 4,4-bipyridine with Cu–N bonds. Figure 1b shows the separation of the layers as viewed down the a axis. Structure of Compound 2 Compound 2 exhibits a bilayered network structure (Figure 2b). As shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), each asymmetric unit contains two pseudo-octahedral nickel cations, two partly deprotonated H2L2– ligands (one is coordi- nated to the nickel ion Ni2 and the other is dispersed in the unit), two and half 4,4-bipyridine molecules, six coordinated, and seven guest water molecules. The first nickel cation, Ni1, is coordinated by three oxygen atoms from three water mole- cules and three nitrogen atoms from three 4,4-bipyridine to give a mer-octahedral arrangement with coordination angles in the range of 83.9(3)–175.9(4)°. The Ni2 ion is coordinated by four oxygen atoms (O4W, O5W, O6W, O1) and two nitrogen atoms (N3, N4) to attain a trans-octahedral arrangement. O4W, O5W, and O6W come from three water molecules, and O1 belongs to phosphonate group of diphosphonate ligand. N3 and N4 come from two 4,4-bipyridine. Mer-NiO3N3 and trans-NiO4N2 octahedral units are ar- ranged in turn to generate two similar dispersed 1D chains www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg.

Coordination Polymers with V-shaped Diphosphonate Ligand along the two cross diagonal directions in two parallel [100] and [1¯00] planes (Figure 2a). These 1D chains are joined by 4,4-bipyridine to construct a bilayered network (Figure 2b) like depicted by M. J. Zaworotko et al.[21] and Figure 2c shows the simplified supramolecular structure with NiO3N3 and NiO4N2 motifs. There are some dispersed H2L2– ligands be- tween each two neighboring bilayers and Figure 2d displays the whole structure excepting guest water molecules. Probably due to the existing of dispersed H2L2–, these bilayers do not form interdigitating structure but simple parallel packing.[22] PXRD and Thermogravimetric Analyses The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the two compounds are shown in Figure 3. Both of the two PXRD curves are consistent with the corresponding simulated patterns from the single-crystal structure data. It demonstrates that the as-synthesized samples are of high purity. Figure 3. Simulated PXRD pattern (gray) and experimental PXRD pattern (black) of 1 (a) and 2 (b). To disclose the stabilities of compounds 1 and 2, thermo- gravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed from room tem- perature to 800 °C (Figure 4). For compound 1, there are three weight loss steps. The first weight loss began at 60 °C and was completed at 160 °C. The observed weight loss of 9.2% corresponds to the removal of one lattice water and two coordi- Z. Anorg. Allg.

The other two steps indicate the successive decomposition of the two-dimension square-grid layer supermolecular structure, and at the end of the measurement (800 °C) the total weight loss is approxi- mately 52.4%. From the curve of compound 2, a steep weight loss in the temperature range from 40 to 145 °C corresponds to the removal of seven lattice water molecules and six coordi- nation water molecules (calculated: 17.31%; observed: 17.51%). Finally the total weight loss was about 54.64% at 800 °C. Figure 4. TGA diagrams of compound 1 (gray) and 2 (black). Conclusions In the presence of auxiliary 4,4-bipyridine, two supra- molecular coordination networks were constructed from self- assembly of flexible V-shaped diphosphonate ligand: (2,4,6- trimethyl-1,3-phenylene)bis(methylene) diphosphonic acid (H4L) with two central transition metal atoms CuII and NiII. The difference of these two structures could be ascribe to the different coordination mode of the central metal atoms or the ratios of metal, ligand, and second ligand 4,4-bipyridine. The structures and properties were confirmed by single-crystal X- ray diffraction, elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, pow- der X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. Other properties such as magnetism will be further studied. Experimental Section Synthesis:1,3-Bis(bromomethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene was synthe- sized by the procedure of Vander Made et al.[23] All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used without further puri- fication. (2,4,6-Trimethyl-1,3-phenylene)bis(methylene) Diphosphonic Acid (H4L): Triethylphosphite and 1,3-bis(bromomethyl)-2,4,6-trimeth- ylbenzene were dissolved in toluene and refluxed for 12 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. Afterwards the solvent was removed. Excessive 37% hy- drochloric acid was added into the resulting pale yellow oil and re- fluxed for 2 d. During this period white solid was formed. At last, the solid was filtered off, washed with water and dried in air (see Scheme S1, Supporting Information).

The SMART software was used for data acquisition and data integration was undertaken with SAINT program.[24] Multi-scan empirical absorp- tion corrections were applied to process the data using the SADABS program.[25] Crystal structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS.[26] Subsequent difference Fourier analyses and least-squares refinement with SHELXL-97 program package[27] allowed the location of the atom positions. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropi- cally and the organic hydrogen atoms were positioned geometrically. Most of the hydrogen atoms were located from the difference Fourier maps and refined isotropically. While other hydrogen atoms are added into a fixed geometry. Hydrogen atoms of guest water molecules in compound 2 were not included in the refinements. The protonation of the phosphonate groups are based on the requirement of charge balance and P–O bond lengths. Crystallographic details for compounds 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table S1.
