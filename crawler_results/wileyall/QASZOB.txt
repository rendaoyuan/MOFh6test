Manuscript FULL PAPER DOI: 10.1002/ejic.201101002 Guanidine Electron Donors and Silver Halides: Interplay and Competition between Redox, Coordination and Polymerization Reactions Dimitri Emeljanenko,[a] Julian Horn,[a] Elisabeth Kaifer,[a] Hubert Wadepohl,[a] and Hans-Jörg Himmel*[a] Keywords: Redox chemistry / Coordination compounds / Silver / Halides / Guanidine Redox reactions compete with coordination and polymeriza- tion reactions when the organic electron donor and ligand, 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(tetramethylguanidino)benzene (1), is dis- solved together with silver halides AgX (X = Cl, Br or I) in solvents of different polarity. The complex results obtained Introduction Aromatic compounds with amino substituents in a para position to each other are well-known organic electron do- nors. Examples include 1,4-bis(dimethylamino)benzene and 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(dimethylamino)benzene.[1] Oxidation of 1,4- bis(dimethylamino)benzene leads to “Wurster’s blue”, which was described as early as the end of the 19th cen- tury.[2] Recently, aromatic compounds functionalized by several guanidino groups in a para position to each other (GFA-n, whereby n denotes the number of guanidino sub- stituents) were introduced as a new class of strong organic electron donors.[3–9] Two examples for GFA-4 compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(tetramethylguanidino)benzene[3] (1) and 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(N,N-dimethyl-N,N-ethyleneguanidino)ben- zene[9] (2) (see Scheme 1). In comparison to the correspond- ing amines, 1 and 2 are much stronger Brønsted bases and exhibit a higher reduction capacity. For example, the oxi- dation potential E1/2(CH2Cl2) = 0.063 V for 1,2,4,5-tetra- kis(dimethylamino)benzene[10] but –0.32 V for 1[3] with re- spect to SCE. In addition, as shown in a massive body of work, guanidines are versatile ligands that have been used extensively for the synthesis of molecular compounds for manifold applications (e.g., catalysis or deposition of mate- rials from precursors).[11–15] GFA-4 compounds such as 1 could be engaged in dif- ferent reaction types like redox reactions, Brønsted acid– base reactions and reactions to give coordination com- pounds. In some cases, they compete with each other, and in others they are coupled. Of course, N ligands generally [a] Anorganisch-Chemisches Institut, Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 270, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany Fax: +49-6221-545707 E-mail: hans-jorg.himmel@aci.uni-heidelberg.de Supporting information for this article is available on the WWW under http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejic.201101002.

A variety of chain polymers have been synthesized in which the guanidine electron-donor building blocks are connected by silver halide clusters of dif- ferent sizes. Scheme 1. represent Brønsted bases, and in fact protonation can be considered the simplest model for complex formation. However, compounds such as 1 or 2 represent superior or- ganic Brønsted bases, much stronger than amines, for exam- ple, and therefore readily deprotonate weak proton acids and solvents such as CH3CN if supporting conditions {e.g., the presence of [Au(PPh3)Cl]} are fulfilled.[9] In the past we reported several examples of the chemistry of 1, in which oxidation and coordination are coupled.[4,5] This is possible because 1 could act as a ligand even after two-electron oxi- dation, thereby underlining its extremely strong Lewis base character. For example, treatment of a solution of 1 with Cu(BF4)2 in CH3CN yielded a dinuclear complex of the guanidine dication, [1{Cu(NCCH3)4}2](BF4)6.[4] In this case, a redox reaction is coupled with coordination. On the other hand, Brønsted acid–base reactions compete with co- ordination reactions and usually also with redox reactions. One example is provided by the treatment of a solution of 2 with [AuCl(PPh3)] and PhCCH in CH3CN.[16] In this case, the redox channel that leads to the salt 2[Au(CCPh)2]2 and the Brønsted acid–base channel that leads to the neutral Au complex [Au(PPh3)CCPh] exhibit similar kinetics in CH3CN. Consequently, a roughly equimolar mixture of H.-J. Himmel et al. FULL PAPER both product types results. Of course, the solvent is of great importance, and highly polar solvents favour the redox channel. Herein we present examples of the chemistry of 1 in which coordination, redox and polymerization reactions in- terplay and/or compete with each other. Variations in the experimental conditions, especially the polarity of the sol- vent, favour one channel over the other. Oxidation of the guanidine is accompanied by an intense green colouring of the solution. The reaction between a silver halide and a guanidine, which at first glance appears to be very simple, will be shown to be a complex story. Chain polymers that contain ordered arrays of silver halide clusters connected through guanidine electron-donor units are among the structurally characterized products. Results and Discussion In the following we discuss the reactions of 1 with silver halides in solvents of different polarities. In the reaction equations we took care to ensure that the stoichiometry of the reactants is correct; they generally are not balanced. The yields refer to the isolated crystalline material and are therefore generally lower bounds for the actual yield. Due to the manifold possible reaction pathways, most reaction products cannot be foretold; however, it will be shown that the reactions could be directed in one direction by optimi- zation of the reaction conditions. Reactions in MeOH When 1 was treated with AgCl or AgBr at room temp. in MeOH, the solution turned, after a few minutes, a deep green that is characteristic of oxidized 1. The analytical data (see the Experimental Section) show the products to be the salts (1)X2 [X = Cl or Br, formed according to Equa- tion (1)]. Hence the 1H NMR spectra of a solution of (1)Br2 in CD3CN displays signals of the dication 12+ (methyl groups and aromatic C–H) at δ = 2.88 and 5.16 ppm. (1) For comparison, the 1H NMR spectroscopic signals of the neutral guanidine 1, also dissolved in CD3CN, occur at δ = 2.63 and 5.54 ppm, and that of the dication in 1(I3)2 at δ = 2.88 and 5.17 ppm.[3] The UV/Vis spectrum of (1)Br2 dissolved in CH3CN (see Figure 1) contains three strong absorptions centered at λ = 218, 293 and 416 nm. In ad- dition, a weak and broad feature occurs at 589 (614) nm (see inset in Figure 1). Single crystals of (1)Cl2 and (1)Br2·4MeOH suitable for XRD were obtained from CH3CN/Et2O and MeOH/Et2O solutions, respectively. Fig- ure 2 illustrates the structures.

Guanidine Electron Donors and Silver Halides the guanidine dication can be described as a pair of bisgu- anidino-allyl monocations that are connected by two C–C single bonds [distances of 150.2(2) and 150.6(2) pm for C1– C2 and C4–C5 in (1)Cl2, and of 149.9(2) pm for C1–C2 in (1)Br2]. Treatment of 1 with AgI yielded a product mixture from which we isolated in a crystalline yield of 51% a brown-red chain polymer of the formula [1(Ag6I8)]n; see Equation (2). The polymer is insoluble in CH3CN, but to some degree soluble in DMF. Crystals of this polymer were obtained with and without cocrystallized DMF solvate mo- lecules. Fractions of the obtained structures are visualized in Figure 3. It can be seen directly that the structures are significantly different. In the case of [1(Ag6I8)·2DMF]n, the chain can formally be regarded to consist of [1(AgI2)2] units fused together by neutral chair-type-structured Ag4I4 clus- ters. The organic building blocks are directly incorporated into the main chain of the polymer. In the case of solvate- free crystals of [1(Ag6I8)]n, chains of rhombic Ag2I2 units connected through the corners can be identified. Every sec- ond rhombic unit is bound through the Ag atoms to two [1(AgI2)2] units. Hence in this case the organic building blocks are not incorporated into the polymer main chain. (2) Figure 3.

Reactions in CH3CN Reactions in CH3CN proceeded very differently. Hence in the case of AgBr and AgI, no oxidation of guanidine 1 Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2012, 695–704 © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 697 was observed. Instead, the guanidine acted as a chelating ligand and pale yellow coordination polymers [1(AgX)2]n (X = Br or I) were formed; see Equation (3). Crystals of the chain polymer [1(AgBr)2]n suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) were grown from concentrated CH3CN solutions. The structure is illustrated in Figure 4. Each AgI is tetrahedrally coordinated by two N and two Br atoms. The dihedral angle between the N–Ag–N and Br–Ag–Br planes is close to the ideal value of 90° for tetrahedral coor- dination. All polymer chains run into the same direction (see Figure 4). The Ag–N bond lengths measure 236.0(2) and 233.8(2) pm. With 72.6(1)°, the N–Ag–N bond angles are relatively small. The Br–Ag–Br angles [100.3(3)°] are close to the ideal value for tetrahedral coordination. The polymer [1(AgI)2]n was obtained in a similar way by reac- tion between 1 and two equivalents of AgI in CH3CN solu- tions. Crystals of [1(AgI)2·4DMF]n were obtained after sev- (3) Figure 4.

The cocrystallized DMF molecules separate two adjacent polymer chains. Unlike [1(AgBr)2]n, every second chain in [1(AgI)2·4DMF]n is tilted by approximately 90° around the chain axis (see Figure 5).

For treatment of AgCl with 1, a product mixture was obtained. In a crystalline yield of 23%, compound [1(AgCl)2] was isolated, which is a dinuclear coordination compound, unlike the polymers of similar overall formula obtained in the reactions with AgBr or AgI. Its structure is illustrated in Figure 6. The molecular units are arranged in stacks. In addition, the salt (1)Cl2 (11% yield) and the chain polymer [1(Ag4Cl6)]n (21% yield) were formed; see Equa- tion (4). The latter was crystallized either from CHCl3 as [1(Ag4Cl6)·4CHCl3]n or from CH2Cl2 as [1(Ag4Cl6)· 2CH2Cl2]n. The structures of the polymers with CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 solvate molecules are compared in Figure 7. The chains found in both compounds could be considered to consist of a cationic polymer {[1(AgCl)2]2+}n in which the building blocks are connected by halide bridges. The silver and halide atoms of each [1(AgCl)2]2+ unit interact with two [AgCl2]– anions. However, the conformation of the chains differs significantly. Hence the dihedral angle be- tween the central Ag2Cl2 ring plane and the N–Ag–N pla- nes amounts to 72° in [1(Ag4Cl6)·4CHCl3]n, and 34° in www.eurjic.org © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Guanidine Electron Donors and Silver Halides Reactions in Toluene If the reaction between 1 and AgCl was carried out in toluene, only the coordination compound [1(AgCl)2] with a neutral guanidine ligand was formed in 77% crystalline yield; see Equation (5). The same compound was already obtained as one of the products of the reaction between 1 and AgCl in CH3CN. Further experiments with this com- plex showed it to be stable only in apolar solvents. When it was dissolved under heat in CH2Cl2, a redox reaction was initiated to yield the coordination polymer [1(Ag4Cl6)]n – see Equation (6) – which was already shown to be one of the products of reaction between 1 and AgCl in CH3CN. (5) (6) Properties of the One-Dimensional Polymers [1(AgX)2]n (X = Br or I) The experiments described above showed that coordina- tion compounds of the neutral guanidines could be ob- tained by careful choice of the solvent. Whereas [1(AgCl)2] is a dinuclear compound, [1(AgBr)2]n and [1(AgI)2]n repre- sent chain polymers. Furthermore, [1(AgCl)2] is highly ame- nable to redox reactions when brought into contact with solvents of moderate to strong polarity. In further experi- ments described in this section, we analyzed the properties and redox chemistry of the polymers [1(AgBr)2]n and [1(AgI)2]n. Thermogravimetric (TG) and differential scan- ning calorimetric (DSC) measurements (see curves in Fig- ure 8) indicate that both compounds are stable up to tem- peratures of 250 °C. Their remission spectra (see the Sup- porting Information) contain broad absorptions below 500 nm. When the compounds were heated to a tempera- ture of 650 °C, gas evolution was monitored and the materi- als changed their optical properties dramatically. The ini- tially yellow colour of the intact polymer turned to black with a metal-like gleam after the heat treatment (see photos provided in the Supporting Information). Up to now we have been unable to characterize the structures of these products of pyrolysis. The elemental analysis showed them to contain substantial amounts of carbon and nitrogen. Further work, which is outside the scope of this article, is necessary to study the composition and properties of these materials. In our oxidation experiments, [1(AgBr)2]n and [1(AgI)2]n were treated with I2 as well as organic electron acceptors [2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ), tetra- chlorobenzoquinone (TCQ) and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ)].

In the case of reaction of an equimolar mixture of [1(AgBr)2]n and I2 at room temp. in CH3CN, the coordination polymer [1(Ag6I8–xBrx)]n with x = 0.7 was isolated in a crystal yield of 26%. Its structure is depicted in Figure 9 (a). It resembles that of [1(Ag6I8)]n. In the case of a 2:1 molar ratio of the two reactants (but otherwise unchanged reaction condi- tions), a different product was isolated in extremely small but reproducible yield. This product was unambiguously identified as the coordination polymer [1(Ag5Br4I3)]n (see Figure 9, b). The guanidine building blocks are incorpo- rated into the polymer main chain. The small yield is at (7) (8) (9) H.-J. Himmel et al. FULL PAPER least partially caused by the low solubility of the starting reagents. On the other hand, reaction between [1(AgI)2]n and I2 (0.5 equiv.) yielded not a polymer but the salt 1(AgI3) with separated guanidine dicationic and AgI3 dian- ionic units (see Figure 10). Figure 9.

Treatment of [1(AgBr)2]n or [1(AgBr)2]n with the organic electron acceptor DDQ (2 equiv.) gave a black product, which was identified as the donor–acceptor couple 1(DDQ)2; see Equation (10). The crystal structure is pro- vided in Figure 11. Clearly, this compound can be prepared more directly by reaction between 1 and DDQ. The donor and acceptor units are arranged in stacks. The packing as well as the black appearance of the material make it attract- ive for a future analysis of the electronic properties.

Conclusion Coordination, redox and polymerization reactions are either coupled or in competition with each other when the guanidine electron donor 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(tetramethylguan- idino)benzene (1) reacts with silver halides in solvents of different polarities. By choice of solvent, the reaction could Guanidine Electron Donors and Silver Halides be directed into the desired channel. The results of this work are of special importance for the use of guanidine electron donors as building blocks in coordination poly- mers. In these polymers, the guanidine units are generally highly oxidized and coloured, thus making them attractive for optical and/or electronic applications. This article shows how halide clusters of different sizes could be incorporated into the chain polymers, thereby opening an access route to well-defined arrays of photoactive silver halide clusters. As shown for the pairs of compounds [1(Ag6I8)·2DMF]n and [1(Ag6I8)]n as well as [1(Ag4Cl6)·4CHCl3]n and [1(Ag4Cl6)· 2CH2Cl2]n, the incorporation of solvent molecules leads to significant changes in the polymer structures. Experimental Section General: The synthetic work was carried out under an inert-gas atmosphere by using standard Schlenk techniques. All solvents were dried rigorously prior to their use. UV/Vis spectra were re- corded with a Varian Cary 5000 spectrometer. NMR spectra were measured with a Bruker Avance II 400 NMR machine. Elemental analyses were carried out at the Microanalytical Laboratory of the University of Heidelberg. IR spectra were recorded with a Biorad Excalibur FTS3000 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric (TG) and calorimetric (DSC) measurements were carried out with a Mettler TC15 and DSC30 apparatus under a N2 atmosphere in a tempera- ture range of 30–600 °C. The heating rate was varied between 2 and 10 °Cmin–1. Compound (1)Cl2: AgCl (135 mg, 0.934 mmol) was added to a solu- tion of 1 (100 mg, 0.188 mmol) in CH3OH (10 mL). The solution was stirred at room temp. for a period of 2 h, during which time the solution quickly adopted a deep green colour. After filtration, 4/5 of the solvent volume was removed, and the initial amount of solvent was restored by the addition of Et2O. A dark crystalline powder of (1)Cl2 precipitated; yield 80 mg (0.133 mmol, 70%). Sin- gle crystals suitable for XRD were obtained from CH3CN/Et2O. C28H58Cl2N12O2 [M + 2MeOH] (665.75): calcd.

X-ray Crystallographic Study: Suitable crystals were taken directly out of the mother liquor, immersed in perfluorinated polyether oil and fixed on top of a glass capillary. Measurements were made with a Nonius-Kappa CCD diffractometer with low-temperature unit using graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation. The tem- perature was set to 100 K. The data collected were processed with the standard Nonius software.[17] All calculations were performed with the SHELXT-PLUS software package. Structures were solved by direct methods with the SHELXS-97 program and refined with the SHELXL-97 program.[18,19] Graphical handling of the struc- tural data during solution and refinement was performed with XPMA.[20] Atomic coordinates and anisotropic thermal parameters H.-J.
