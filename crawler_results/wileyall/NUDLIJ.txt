Bohnsack, Nolan W. Waggoner, Kyung Ho Cho, Ji Sun Lee, Do-Young Hong, Vincent M. Lynch, Jong-San Chang,* and Simon M. Humphrey* Abstract: A new MgII-based version of the porous coordina- tion polymer CUK-1 with one-dimensional pore structure was prepared by microwave synthesis in water. Mg-CUK-1 is moisture-stable, thermally stable up to 50088C, and shows unusual reversible soft-crystal behavior: dehydrated single crystals of the material selectively adsorb a range of organic molecules at ambient temperature and pressure. Both polar and apolar aromatic compounds, including pyridine, benzene, p-xylene, and p-divinylbenzene (p-DVB), are all readily adsorbed, while other isomers from complex mixtures of xylenes or DVBs are selectively excluded. The solvent-loaded structures have been studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Time-dependent liquid sorption experiments using commer- cially available DVB demonstrate a high and rapid selective adsorption of p-DVB and exclusion of m-DVB and ethyl- vinylbenzene isomers. A number of porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have been shown to possess the ability to effectively separate complex mixtures of gases[1] and, less commonly, of liquid hydrocarbons.[2] The latter represents a tangible application for such materials, especially to achieve separations that cannot be easily performed using common large-scale sepa- ration methods (e.g., column chromatography, ion exchange, fractional distillation).[3,4] One such example concerns the separation of isomers of divinylbenzene (DVB): p-DVB is important in the manufacture of cross-linked styrene poly- mers, which, paradoxically, are utilized in the manufacturing of ion-exchange resins.[4] DVB is prepared by dehydrogen- ation of crude mixtures of o-, m-, and p-diethylbenzene. Commercially available DVB consists of approximately 80% m- and p-DVB along with the products of partial dehydrogen- ation, m- and p-ethylvinylbenzene (EVB). From an industrial standpoint, pure p-DVB is most preferred for the formation of ordered cross-linked styrene/p-DVB copolymers, but large- scale separation approaches have proven to be inefficient.[5] In 2007, we published the discovery of a highly porous cobalt(II)-based coordination polymer named CUK-1, which has received significant attention because of its exceptional ability to separate complex gas mixtures.[6] CUK-1 is based on 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (2,4-pdc) and contains one- dimensional channels with square pore windows. The material was shown to be highly robust, owing to the presence of infinite one-dimensional metal hydroxide chains that support a corrugated wall structure. One potential drawback of transition-metal-based materials is the potential for slow hydrolytic decomposition. Ongoing efforts to determine methods for the preparation of more highly stable phases of CUK-1 using alternative metals have ultimately yielded a fast, reproducible, and high-yielding method for the production of a MgII analogue. Mg-CUK-1 is conveniently prepared in water with a rapid and energy-efficient microwave(mw)- assisted method that yields a crystalline product in only 35 min at 20088C. Replacement of CoII with MgII was our ultimate goal, because the resulting Mg-CUK-1 is significantly (19.2%) lighter than the original material, and is thermally and chemically more stable because of the higher hardness of MgII. MgII is also cheaper and comparatively nontoxic compared to most transition metals, making it an ideal choice for scale-up purposes. The Mg analogue can also be prepared using a conventional (cv) heating method at 2208C in H2O for 15 h. Although the average crystallite size obtained from cv heating is significantly larger, the reaction yield and (more importantly) the bulk textural properties are both superior for mw-synthesized materials (see below). The MgII centers in Mg-CUK-1 are octahedrally coordi- nated and bridge into infinite chains of edge- and vertex- sharing Mg3OH triangles. The lattice connectivity of Mg- CUK-1 is identical to that of Co-CUK-1, but the space group of the as-synthesized material is different (P21/c versus C2/c). [*] B. Saccoccia, A. M. Bohnsack, N. W.

KGaA, Weinheim Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2015, 54, 5394 –5398 The lower symmetry of the new material can be explained with the positions of guest H2O molecules inside the channels (Figure 1A; yellow). A network of close-range H-bonding interactions that include m3-OH moieties resident in the pore walls results in the formation of a remarkably well-ordered pseudo-ice phase at room temperature; the solvent is so well ordered that all H atoms were directly located in the peak- difference map. Full resolution of the H2O structure revealed infinite chains of (H2O)16 cages comprised of face-sharing pentameric drums (Figure 1B,C). H···O contact distances lie in the range 2.71–2.96 è compared with 2.76 è in the Ih-ice phase.[7] A space-filling view of the one-dimensional “ice” chains provides a perspective of the channel topology in Mg- CUK-1, which takes the form of undulating channels that contain pockets linked by smaller apertures (Figure 1C). Despite the extended H-bonding network, Mg-CUK-1 is surprisingly easily dehydrated by gentle heating (5088C) under vacuum over 1 h, or alternatively at ambient pressure using a stream of heated (70–1008C) N2 gas. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed a rapid mass loss of 22 wt% between 20 and 5088C, after which there is a very large window of stability until the onset of polymer degradation at about 50088C (Figure S5 and S6 in the Supporting Information). Heating a single crystal in a stream of dry N2 and subsequent in situ X-ray diffraction analysis at 1008C revealed complete dehydration accompanied by retention of the three-dimen- sional order. Notably, the symmetry spontaneously changes to C2/c upon dehydration. In comparison to the as-synthesized structure, dehydrated crystals show a concertina distortion perpendicular to the direction of channel propagation (so- called soft-crystal behavior),[8] resulting in diamondoid- shaped channels (Figure S11). Cooling of a dehydrated crystal to ¢1438C under dry N2 did not result in further structural deformation (or reversion to the original primitive space group), which indicates that the concertinaing is simply due to loss of H2O from the pores and is not a temperature- dependent phase transition of the PCP. Dehydrated Mg-CUK-1 is stable when stored in air and when re-suspended in fresh H2O, as confirmed by bulk powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD; Figure S1 and S4). The bulk textural properties of the material were assessed as a function of the synthetic method, using a number of small- molecule probe gases in the range 0–1 atm (Figure S8 and S9). Regardless of the heating method, Mg-CUK-1 showed an adsorption preference of CO2 over H2, N2, and CH4. H2 and CH4 were more strongly adsorbed than N2, as was originally observed for the CoII-based analogue.[6] The total sorption capacities and estimated CO2 BET surface area of mw-Mg- CUK-1 were found to be higher than for cv-Mg-CUK-1 for all gases studied (Table 1). Fast crystallization under mw heating results in smaller crystallites, which should have more accessible pore openings and shorter channels that could be more efficiently filled by guest adsorbates. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the as-synthesized materials revealed average crystallite sizes of 150 × 250 and 10 × 30 mm for the cv- and mw-prepared samples, respectively (Figure S7). Interestingly, the measured CO2 BET surface area of cv-Mg- CUK-1 was increased by 12% by simple mechanical grinding of the crystallites to an average size resembling that of the as- synthesized mw-material (Figure S10). While the average particle size is obviously an important factor, it is plausible that other effects such as pore blocking by unreacted organic and inorganic components may also differ between the synthetic routes, or that the mw route provides Mg-CUK- 1 with fewer framework defects. We then explored the potential use of mw-Mg-CUK-1 for the selective adsorption/extraction of a range of aromatic molecules from the liquid phase. In all experiments, dehy- drated crystallites were suspended in the water-free solvents over 1–5 days at room temperature. The individual crystals retained their crystallinity during the adsorption process, and remarkably allowed for the collection of new single-crystal X- ray structures with completely resolved, ordered solvent Figure 1.

The sorption capacity of Mg-CUK-1 differs from solvent to solvent, as might be expected based on packing densities and the presence of favorable host–guest and guest–guest interactions (see below). The absolute adsorption capacities were assessed by comparing the model solvent occupancies obtained from the single-crystal studies to bulk samples of solvent-loaded crystals, analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy upon digestion in acidic [D6]acetone/D2O, and by TGA analysis (see Table S3). Adsorption of pyridine inside dehydrated Mg-CUK- 1 resulted in a zigzag packing arrangement directed by short-range (2.52 è) donor–acceptor contacts between pyr- idine N and hydroxide H atoms in the channel walls (Fig- ure 2a). Benzyl alcohol showed a similar behavior (Fig- ure S15). In contrast, apolar benzene becomes arranged in an undulating ribbon with six unique (and partially occupied) orientations based on a combination of face-to-face host– guest p–p interactions (centroid–centroid = 4.31 è) and T- shaped benzene H to channel wall (2,4-pdc)–p interactions (4.05 è; Figure 2b and S12A).[9] Toluene formed a simpler ordered phase, with similar p–p interactions (centroid–cent- roid = 4.30 è; Figure 2c and S16B). The adsorption of xylene isomers was then studied. A handful of PCPs have been shown to selectively separate xylene isomers.[10] Interestingly, in this case an ordered crystalline phase was obtained only for p-xylene-treated Mg-CUK-1 (Figure 2d); single crystals treated with o- and m- xylene remained highly crystalline, but electron density corresponding to less than one electron per site was smeared throughout the centers of the channel voids. TGA and elemental microanalysis of the materials indicated at least some adsorption for all isomers (see the Supporting Informa- tion). Liquid (vapor) sorption isotherms collected using each pure isomer in the range p/p0 = 0–0.7 at 5088C provide more valuable insight (Figure 3). It is apparent that dehydrated Mg- CUK-1 can adsorb each isomer, but the relative capacity is of the order p > o > m. The minimum guest-accessible dimen- sion of the pore openings in dehydrated Mg-CUK-1 is 8.0 è (obtained directly from the crystal structure; Figure S11); the critical diameters of the three xylene isomers (o: 6.6, m: 6.4, p: 5.7 è; Figure S12) should therefore permit easy access of each isomer to the interior of the channels. Notably, the crystal structure of the p-xylene-loaded material shows that guest– guest interactions are the dominant sorption force; however, close-range host–guest interactions that were dominant for smaller aromatic compounds were not evident. Instead, head- to-tail-type intermolecular CH3–p guest–guest interactions are prevalent (centroid–C = 4.24 è; Figure S16C).[9] The strong hysteresis observed in the desorption isotherms (open symbols; Figure 3) is also strong evidence for the presence of favorable guest–guest p–p interactions; similar Figure 2.

KGaA, Weinheim Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2015, 54, 5394 –5398 behavior has been observed in other micro- and mesoporous materials.[11] Furthermore, when activated Mg-CUK-1 was exposed to a 1:1:1 mixture of the three xylene isomers, single- crystal analysis revealed a p-xylene-loaded structure with an identical packing arrangement as obtained when pure p- xylene was the adsorbate. This indicated to us that Mg-CUK- 1 might have the ability to selectively adsorb other p- substituted aromatic molecules from mixtures of isomers, based on their preferential packing linearly within the undulating one-dimensional channels. Pure fractions of DVB isomers are not easily obtained, due to the inherent purification issues outlined above. Instead, we directly treated a sample of dehydrated Mg- CUK-1 with a commercially available technical-grade DVB, which contained  79% of a mixture of m- and p-DVB along with  21% of m- and p-EVB, naphthalene, and 4-tert- butylcatechol as stabilizer. Strikingly, after standing for three days, single crystals were found to contain only p-DVB (Figure 2e). The packing arrangement of p-DVB is very similar to that of p-xylene; guest–guest packing interactions are clearly dominant. Individual p-DVB monomers are planar and tightly packed into the one-dimensional chains with very close-range (3.63 è) p–vinylene interactions (Figure 2 f and S12D). Kitagawa and co-workers previously studied selective DVB adsorption and subsequent in situ polymerization by a terephthalate-based PCP with one-dimensional channels.[12] They found that smaller channels selectively gave p-substi- tuted polymers and it was concluded that the packing orientation of the monomers inside the pores affected the extent of polymerization: a face-to-face orientation of the monomers was thought to promote polymerization, but single-crystal structures of the loaded materials were not obtained. This study suggests that p-DVB is selectively adsorbed inside the one-dimensional channels because a head-to-tail orientation results in the most favorable adsorption enthalpy (the critical diameters of all DVB and EVB isomers are similar to those of the corresponding xylene isomers, so it is possible for all molecules to enter the channels; Figure S12). To further investigate the potential usefulness of Mg- CUK-1 as a medium for the separation of DVB isomers, larger quantities (ca. 1 g) of Mg-CUK-1 were employed to facilitate a time-dependent separation study. SEM imaging confirmed that the crystallites are very robust and retain their bulk structure upon loading (Figure S14). Commercially available DVB is notoriously difficult to handle at elevated temperatures because it tends to oligomerize. As the DVB isomers also have low vapor pressures, it is difficult to record useful vapor sorption isotherms. However, 1,4-dibromonaph- thalene can be used as a convenient GC-MS internal standard to allow for the accurate analysis of relative isomer amounts in liquid sorption studies. In direct support of the above single-crystal observations, liquid sorption results using bulk samples of Mg-CUK-1 treated with a crude DVB mixture at 2588C confirmed a very high sorption affinity of p-DVB over the three other major components, while m-DVB itself became enriched in the supernatant liquid (Figure 4). The adsorption selectivity for p-DVB in Mg-CUK-1 is consider- able after only 3 h exposure time, with a selectivity factor of 8.2. This value gradually increased with time up to 7 days, reaching a selectivity factor of 15.0 (1.18 mmolg¢1 corre- sponds to 0.154 g p-DVB per g Mg-CUK-1). There are two plausible explanations for the impressive selective adsorption observed: a) it is clear that the p-DVB monomers are most rapidly adsorbed into the channels, possibly because the inherent p conjugation and extended resonance in the p-DVB isomer maintains a planar structure that can more easily enter the channels; b) the resulting p- isomer-loaded structure is most stable because of the favorable resulting host–guest and guest–guest stacking forces. Head-to-tail m-DVB stacking is more difficult because of the substitution pattern. Ab initio DFT calculations of m- and p-DVB also suggest that fully planar conformations are energetically most favored in the gas phase (see the Support- ing Information). Meanwhile, the partially saturated EVB isomers would be unable to establish head-to-tail p–vinylene interactions that are necessary to promote ordered packing inside the channels, hence the very low uptake of these. A comparison of the theoretical void space in Mg-CUK-1 to the actual volume required per adsorbed molecule reveals that the pores are more fully occupied by smaller molecules such as pyridine, which can pack more efficiently and engage in host–guest H-bonding interactions; meanwhile, the total space occupied by other, larger adsorbates was in the range 72–89% (based on TGA loading data; Table S4). In conclusion, Mg-CUK-1 is a remarkably stable porous material that can be prepared in large quantities using a convenient and environmentally benign microwave-assisted aqueous method. The structural robustness of Mg-CUK-1 has enabled a detailed structural investigation of hydrocarbon adsorption, which provides a clear explanation for its ability to selectively adsorb p-isomers of xylene and DVB from complex mixtures of isomers. Experimental Section Synthesis of mw-Mg-CUK-1: 2,4-Pyridinedicarboxylic acid (170 mg, 1.0 mmol) and KOH (2.0m, 2.0 cm3) in H2O (2.0 cm3) were added to a stirred solution of Mg(NO3)2–hydrate (380 mg, 1.5 mmol) in H2O (3.0 cm3) to give a viscous, opaque slurry, which was heated to 2008C for 35 min in a MARS microwave (CEM Corp.) inside 100 cm3 Figure 4.

Vapour sorption isotherm of the p-DVB-rich mixture (85% p-DVB) for μw-Mg-CUK-1 at 50oC. 22 Methods S1. Vapour sorption and GC analysis details. Vapour sorption isotherms of p-DVB and xylene were obtained at 50 °C using an intelligent gravimetric analyzer (IGA, Hiden Analytical Ltd, U.K.) over μw-Mg-CUK-1. The Mg-CUK-1 sample (ca. 35 mg) was placed in a stainless steel sample bucket of fine mesh and was outgassed to constant weight, at a pressure of < 10-6 Torr at 300oC. Xylene isomers and p-DVB mixture were purchased from the Sigma- Aldrich Inc. The p-DVB mixture contained 85% p-DVB and about 10% m-DVB isomers. The liquids used to generate the vapour were degassed fully by repeated evacuation and vapour equilibration cycles of the liquid supply side of the vapour reservoir. p-DVB compound tended to easily form oligomerized or polymerized products at elevated temperature and higher vapour pressure. In this experiment, the adsorption isotherm of p-DVB was obtained only at less than vapour pressure of 3.5 mbar by careful pressure control. Otherwise it was not successful to collect vapour sorption isotherms due to the formation of polymeric gels in the reservoir of the sample liquid. The vapour pressure was gradually increased over a time scale of 30 s to prevent disruption of the microbalance, until the desired value was achieved. Pressure control was done by the use of two transducers with ranges 0-100 mbar and 0-10 bar, each with an accuracy of 0.02% of the specified range. The pressure was maintained at the set point by active computer control of the inlet/outlet valves throughout the duration of a series of experiments. After equilibrium was established for each pressure increment, the vapour pressure was changed to the next pressure and the mass change measured until equilibrium was re-established. Full buoyancy corrections for both the sample and counterbalance sides were carried out. Liquid sorption experiments of the technical grade DVB (80%, Sigma-Aldrich) using 1,4- dibromonaphthalene (DBN) (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) as a bulky internal standard have been performed at 25 oC. To obtain adsorption selectivity for p-DVB with sorption time, six individual experiments were carried out for various time conditions. The dehydrated Mg-CUK-1 (1 g) was added to the mixture of DVB (3 g) and 1,4-dibromonaphthalene (0.1 g) containing in a sample vial (10 ml) at 25 oC using a constant bath circulator (Julabo F-75). Liquid sorption was started with stirring the mixture and Mg-CUK-1 and was stop at a certain period of time. The mixture was filtered to remove Mg-CUK-1 by a syringe filter (0.45 µm pore), and then the mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A) with a flame ionization detector (FID) using a capillary column HP-INNOWAX (60 m x 0.32 x 0.5 µm, Agilent). Concentrations of DVB and EVB isomers in the sorption experiments were determined by calibrated peak areas using the software ChemStation (Agilent). In this case, we assumed that FID sensitivity factors for all isomers in the technical grade DVB would be identical in order to simplify the calculation of concentrations because we cannot purchase high-purity authentic samples for the DVB and EVB isomers from chemical companies. The molar sensitivity factor used for quantification of each compound was calculated to be 1.024 on the basis of the DBN standard. 23 5 6 7 8 9 10 22 23 0 10 20 30 40 DBN p-DVB m-DVB p-EVB Intensity (a.u.)

X-Ray Crystallography. Single Crystal X-ray Crystallography. Crystals were mounted on thin glass fibers using perfluoropolyether oil, which was frozen in situ by a nitrogen gas Cryostream flow. Data for all materials reported herein were collected on an Enraf Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer using monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). All non-hydrogen atoms belonging to the CUK-1 framework were refined anisotropically for all structures, and all H-atoms were located in the electron difference map and allowed to refine freely. Residual electron density found in the channel voids was assigned to solvent molecules. All non-hydrogen guest atoms were refined anisotropically; these were initially assigned a common free variable resulting in a common site occupancy that was fixed as the nearest sensible fraction of an entire molecule in the final cycle of refinement. All H-atoms of guest solvent molecules were added using idealized geometric considerations and were refined with values of Uiso set to 1.5 times that of the carrier atom. The SQUEEZE utility in PLATON was not applied in any instance. Full crystallographic parameters for the final refinements are given in Table S1 above. All CIF data is available free-of-charge from www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk. Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD). The phase purity of materials was confirmed by analysis of powdered crystalline samples placed inside borosilcate capillary tubes and spun in situ to prevent preferential orientation of the crystallites. Spectra were recorded on a Stoe Stadi-P diffractometer, operating in Debye-Scherrer geometry using Co Kα radiation (1.7902 Å). Reflection data was collected in the range 5.0–40.0° 2θ using multiple scans, which were subsequently averaged. The PXRD spectra were then compared directly to their corresponding simulated patterns that were generated in PLATON using hkl reflection data obtained from the single crystal experiment. 27 Table S2. Ab Initio DFT calculations for m- and p-DVB monomers. The gas-phase most favorable molecular geometries of m- and p-divinylbenzene were modeled using the Gaussian 09W software package. The calculated structures were optimized on a dual processor system running Windows XP. The geometric optimizations, single-point calculations, and frequency generations required between 30 and 120 processor minutes per structure. The structural optimizations (in vacuo) were performed using Gaussian 09W, 6-311G** (d,p) basis set, and the B3LYP functional. Structural analysis and graphics rendering were performed within the GaussView 5.0.9 software package. Geometries of the analyte molecules were verified to be global minima by numerical frequency calculations. In all instances, calculation showed that the preferred geometries were planarised.
