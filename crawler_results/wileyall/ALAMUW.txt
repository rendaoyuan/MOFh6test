Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/chem.201002135 High Gas Sorption and Metal-Ion Exchange of Microporous Metal–Organic Frameworks with Incorporated Imide Groups Thazhe Kootteri Prasad, Dae Ho Hong, and Myunghyun Paik Suh*[a] Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with pores and channels have attracted great attention because of their potential ap- plications in gas storage, gas separation, catalysis, and fabri- cation of nanoparticles.[1–4] The storage of H2 and CH4 gases and the capture of CO2 have become particularly important issues in MOF chemistry, because of the potential utility of H2 and CH4 as energy carriers, and the implications of CO2 in global warming. There are a number of MOFs that adsorb high levels of CO2 [4] and CH4 [5–7] at room tempera- ture, but their H2 storage capacities[1,3,8–10] are generally very low at room temperature because of the low isosteric heat of H2 adsorption. The isosteric heat of H2 adsorption can be increased by the creation of open metal sites, through syn- thesis of catenated frameworks, and by imbedding metal nanoparticles in the MOF.[1,2f,3] Gas sorption properties also depend on pore volume and ligand structures. It has been reported that curved ligands incorporated into a MOF can increase H2 adsorption because they provide a pocket for adsorption.[11] Various MOFs have been constructed from CuII and tetra- carboxylic acids,[3,5,6,8,11,12] some of which are reported to show high H2 adsorption capacities,[3,8,11,12a] but sorption properties for other gases have been less well explored.[6] In addition, the tetracarboxylate ligands used in the previous studies did not contain extra functional groups. This has prompted us to synthesize MOFs in which the organic ligand incorporates imide groups, and to explore their ef- fects on gas sorption. In addition, several recent reports show that the properties of MOFs can be altered by using postsynthetic modifications, such as covalent transforma- tions, tandem modifications, protonation, and doping with metals.[13] It has been also reported that the coordinated metal ions in the MOF can be reversibly exchanged while maintaining structural integrity.[14] In this work, we have prepared a new ligand N,N’-bis(3,5- dicarboxyphenyl)pyromellitic diimide (H4BDCPPI). We ex- Abstract: Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), {[Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdcppi)- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)2]·10DMF·2H2O}n (SNU-50) and {[Zn2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdcppi)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)3]·6DMF·4H2O}n (SNU-51), have been prepared by the solvothermal reactions of N,N’-bis(3,5- dicarboxyphenyl)pyromellitic diimide (H4BDCPPI) with CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 and Zn- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2, respectively. Framework SNU- 50 has an NbO-type net structure, whereas SNU-51 has a PtS-type net structure. Desolvated solid [Cu2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdcppi)]n (SNU-50’), which was pre- pared by guest exchange of SNU-50 with acetone followed by evacuation at 1708C, adsorbs high amounts of N2, H2, O2, CO2, and CH4 gases due to the presence of a vacant coordination site at every metal ion, and to the presence of imide groups in the ligand. The Langmuir surface area is 2450 m2g1. It adsorbs H2 gas up to 2.10 wt% at 1 atm and 77 K, with zero coverage iso- steric heat of 7.1 kJmol1, up to a total of 7.85 wt% at 77 K and 60 bar. Its CO2 and CH4 adsorption capacities at 298 K are 77 wt% at 55 bar and 17 wt% at 60 bar, respectively. Of par- ticular note is the O2 adsorption ca- pacity of SNU-50’ (118 wt% at 77 K and 0.2 atm), which is the highest re- ported so far for any MOF. By metal- ion exchange of SNU-51 with CuII, {[Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdcppi)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)3]·7DMF·5H2O}n (SNU-51-CuDMF) with a PtS-type net was prepared, which could not be syn- thesized by a direct solvothermal reac- tion.

By employing this long tetracarboxylate ligand, we synthesized {[Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdcppi)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)2]·10DMF·2H2O}n (SNU-50) and {[Zn2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdcppi)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)3]·6DMF·4H2O}n (SNU- 51), which have entirely different structures; namely, NbO- type and PtS-type net structures, respectively (see Scheme 1). The desolvated solid [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdcppi)]n (SNU-50’) exhibits high adsorption capacities for N2, H2, O2, CO2, and CH4 gases, which must be attributed to the presence of the vacant coordination site at every metal ion and the presence of imide groups in the ligand. The ZnII ions in SNU-51 were exchanged with CuII ions with retention of the PtS-type net—a structure that was impossible to prepare through sol- vothermal reaction. Results and Discussion Synthesis and X-ray structure of SNU-50: Bluish green crys- tals of SNU-50 were prepared by heating an acidified mix- ture of CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 and H4BDCPPI in DMF at 1108C for 12 h. The X-ray crystal structure of SNU-50 indicates that the CuII ions form a paddlewheel-type [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(OOC)4] cluster as a square-planar secondary building unit (SBU) that is linked with the rectangular organic building block BDCPPI4 to give rise to a NbO-type 3D network (see Figure 1). Each CuII ion shows square pyramidal geometry, with the coordination of four oxygen atoms from four differ- ent BDCPPI4 units and a DMF molecule coordinated at the axial position of the paddlewheel unit. The framework creates barrel-like cages, each of which is composed of 12 nodes occupied by [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(OOC)4] cluster units (see Figure 1a). The edge length of the external trian- gular ring of the cage is about 10 , as estimated from the centers of the paddlewheel units, while the diagonal distance for the internal hexagonal ring is about 28 . Because of the long organic linker, a huge void space is created in the lattice. The void volume of SNU-50 calculated by PLATON is 63% of the unit-cell volume without any guest molecules, and it increases to 74% upon removal of the coordinated DMF molecules. The framework contains three types of channels, two of which are similar. The cylindrical channel with an aperture diameter of 3  passes along the c axis of the unit cell. The two similar channels, with maximum in- circle diameters of 2.0 , pass along the a and b axes of the unit cell (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The channels are filled with DMF and H2O guest molecules. Be- cause the guest solvent molecules could not be located from the difference map due to their high thermal disorder in the large unit cells, the identity and numbers of guest molecules were determined from elemental analysis (EA) and ther- mogravimetric analysis (TGA) data. The channel size in- creases upon removal of the coordinated DMF molecules; the channel along the c axis increases to 4 , while the channels along the a and b axes change to triangular type with maximum in-circle diameters of 4.5  (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). TGA of SNU-50 indicates that the coordinated DMF molecules can be removed at 2208C, and the framework is stable up to 2908C (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). When SNU-50 was immersed in anhydrous acetone, the coordinated DMF molecules and the guest solvent mole- cules were exchanged with acetone to produce {[Cu2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdcppi)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH3COCH3)2]·5CH3COCH3·2H2O}n (SNU-50Ac). SNU-50Ac was characterized by IR, EA, and TGA. The co- ordinated acetone at the CuII ion could be clearly seen at 1689 cm1 in the IR spectra. A few X-ray structures have been reported for acetone-coordinated complexes.[15] Al- though the single-crystal X-ray structure of SNU-50Ac could not be determined because of the poor diffraction profile, the powder XRD (PXRD) pattern indicated that the frame- work structure changed very little with guest exchange (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). Gas sorption of SNU-50’: The preparation of SNU-50’ was achieved by heating SNU-50Ac at 608C for 24 h and then at 1708C for 4 h. The structure of SNU-50’ contains a vacant coordination site at every CuII ion, and is extremely mois- ture sensitive; its dark blue color changes instantly to pale green on exposure to air, and its PXRD pattern becomes broadened, although the peak positions are similar to those of SNU-50 and SNU-50Ac (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). Once SNU-50’ is exposed to air, it does not adsorb any gases even after it is reactivated. The permanent porosity of SNU-50’ was confirmed by the adsorption isotherms of N2, H2, O2, CO2, and CH4 gases (see Figure 2 and Table 1). The N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K Scheme 1.

KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2010, 16, 14043 – 14050 14044 shows Type-I sorption behavior, which is characteristic of microporosity. SNU-50’ adsorbs 641 cm3g1 of N2 at 77 K and 0.89 atm. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas are 2300 and 2450 m2g1, respective- ly, which are smaller than the accessible surface area (3455 m2g1) calculated for SNU-50 by simple Monte Carlo simulation with N2 as a probe molecule (probe diameter= 3.681 ).[16] The pore volume calculated by using the Dubi- nin–Radushkevich method was 1.08 cm3g1, which is slightly smaller than the value (1.11 cm3g1) calculated from the X- ray crystal structure of SNU-50 by using PLATON.[17] The reduced surface area and pore volume, compared with those of the theoretical values, indicate that the framework shrinks on removal of the coordinated solvent molecules as well as the guest molecules. The pore diameter calculated with the Saito–Foley model[18] was 11.0  (see the Support- ing Information). The density of N2 adsorbed in SNU-50’, as calculated by using the pore volume (1.08 cm3g1) estimated from the N2 adsorption data, is 743 kgm3, which is close to the liquid N2 density of 807 kgm3 at 77 K and 1 atm. The H2 adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K show the high H2 uptake capability of SNU-50’. It adsorbs up to 2.10 wt% of H2 (233 cm3g1 at standard temperature and pressure (STP), 6.9 H2 molecules per formula unit) at 77 K and 1 atm, and up to 1.39 wt% (154 cm3g1 at STP, 4.5 H2 molecules per formula unit) at 87 K and 1 atm. The isosteric heat of H2 adsorption calculated by using the virial equation[10b,19] is 7.1–4.7 kJmol1, depending on the amount of H2 uptake (see Figure S12 in the Supporting Informa- tion). The values are comparable with those of previously reported CuII MOFs that contain the accessible metal sites on CuII and the long tetracarboxylate ligand.[3,8,11] The densi- ty of adsorbed H2 in SNU-50’ at 77 K and 1 atm, as calculat- ed by using the pore volume (1.08 cm3g1) estimated from the N2 adsorption data, is 19 kgm3, which is much lower than that of liquid H2 (71 kgm3 at 1 atm and 20 K). The O2 gas adsorption isotherm of SNU-50’ was measured up to 0.20 atm because the saturation pressure of O2 at 77 K is 147.8 Torr. SNU-50’ adsorbs 829 cm3g1 (118 wt%) of O2 at 77 K and 0.20 atm, and 774 cm3g1 (110 wt%) at 87 K and 0.7 atm. These values are the highest yet observed for any MOF. Previously, the highest adsorption data reported for O2 was 618 cm3g1 (88 wt%) at 77 K and 0.19 atm for CoACHTUNGTRENUNG(BDP).[20] In addition, SNU-50’ adsorbs much higher amounts (1.5) of O2 than N2 at 77 K and 0.2 atm. This may be attributed to the fact that the vacant coordination sites on the CuII centers of the framework interact with O2 more strongly than with N2.[21] In addition, O2 is more accessible to the channels with smaller apertures because of its smaller kinetic diameter (3.47 ) than that of N2 (3.64 ). The den- sity of adsorbed O2 in the framework, as calculated by using the pore volume (1.08 cm3g1) estimated from the N2 ad- sorption isotherm, is 1098 kgm3 at 77 K and 0.20 atm, which is close to the liquid O2 density (1204 kgm3) at 77 K and 0.20 atm. The CO2 adsorption isotherms of SNU-50’ show CO2 uptake capacities of 454 cm3g1 (81 wt%) at 195 K, 120 cm3g1 (21 wt%) at 273 K, and 80 cm3g1 (15.7 wt%) at 298 K under 1 atm of CO2 pressure. The highest CO2 uptake capacities reported so far for MOFs under similar conditions is 114 wt% in SNU-6 at 195 K and 1 atm.[4a] The isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption calculated by using the Clausius– Figure 2.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 14045 FULL PAPER High Gas Sorption and Metal-Ion Exchange of MOFs Clapeyron equation is 25.8 kJmol1 at low coverage range (see Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). The value is higher than that (15.8–16.5 kJmol1) for MOF-5,[22] but simi- lar to that of Prussian blue analogues.[23] Interestingly, the isosteric heat of adsorption only changes from 25 to 23 kJmol1 as CO2 loading increases from 5 to 16 wt%, which indicates the strong interaction between SNU-50’ and CO2 even at high loading. The CH4 uptake capacities of SNU-50’ at 1 atm are 166 cm3g1 (12 wt%) at 195 K, 21 cm3g1 (1.5 wt.%) at 273 K, and 17 cm3g1 (1.2 wt%) at 298 K. The heat of CH4 adsorption calculated by using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation is 26.8 kJmol1 at low coverage of CH4, which indi- cates the strong interaction between the host framework and CH4 gas at low coverage (see Figure S14 in the Support- ing Information). The highest heat of CH4 adsorption re- ported so far is 30 kJmol1 for PCN-14.[6] Contrary to CO2 adsorption, the isosteric heat of CH4 adsorption changes drastically from 25 to 17 kJmol1 as the loading increases from 0.5 to 1.2 wt%. The higher adsorption capacities of CO2 relative to CH4, and the higher isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption (slightly depending on the amount of CO2 load- ing) must be attributed to the quadrupole moment of CO2 (1.341039 Cm2). High-pressure gas-sorption properties of SNU-50’: The high- pressure gas-sorption isotherms were measured for H2 at 77 K, and for H2, CO2, and CH4 gases at 298 K (see Figure 3). SNU-50’ adsorbs an excess of 5.53 wt% H2 at 77 K and 60 bar with no hysteresis. The total H2 adsorption, which is the sum of the adsorbed amount on the pore sur- face and the amount of pressurized gas in the pore, is 7.85 wt% at 60 bar. To the best of our knowledge, only four MOFs have higher H2 uptake capacities than this; MOF-5 (11.5 wt%, 170 bar, 77 K), MOF-177 (11.0 wt%, 70 bar, 77 K), SNU-6 (10 wt%, 50 bar, 77 K),[1] and NOTT-112 (10 wt%, 77 bar, 77 K).[24] At 298 K, the H2 uptake capaci- ties are reduced significantly to the excess adsorption of 0.40 wt% and the total uptake of 0.97 wt% at 60 bar.[10] NOTT-103, constructed from CuII and a long tetracarboxy- late, showed a BET surface area of 2930 m2g1 and a pore volume of 1.14 cm3g1.[8] It exhibited a total H2 uptake ca- pacity of 7.22 wt% at 77 K and 60 bar. Despite the lower BET surface area (2300 m2g1) and lower pore volume esti- mated by N2 sorption data (1.08 cm3g1), SNU-50’ shows higher H2 uptake capacity (7.85 wt%) than NOTT-103 under similar conditions, which indicates that a MOF with imide groups is better for H2 uptake than a MOF containing simple benzene rings. The CO2 adsorption isotherm at 298 K also shows rela- tively high uptake. SNU-50’ adsorbs CO2 with an excess ad- sorption of 64 wt% and a total uptake of 77 wt% at 298 K and 55 bar. The CO2 uptake decreases slightly as the pres- sure increases above 45 bar, due to saturation, and the sorp- tion isotherm shows no hysteresis. The highest CO2 uptake capacity reported so far is 176 wt% at 304 K and 50 bar for MIL-101c(Cr).[4b] SNU-50’ adsorbs CH4 with an excess adsorption of 12 wt% and a total uptake of 17 wt% CH4 at 298 K and 60 bar. The highest CH4 uptake capacity reported so far is an excess adsorption of 18.1 wt% (220 v/v) with a total uptake of 18.9 wt% (230 v/v) at 35 bar and 290 K in PCN- 14.[6] The high adsorption capacities for H2 and CH4 gases at high pressures may be attributed to the large pore volume, exposed metal sites, and the incorporation of imide groups in SNU-50’.[1,6,8] Synthesis and X-ray crystal structure of SNU-51: Framework SNU-51 was synthesized by heating ZnACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 and H4BDCPPI in DMF at 1108C for 12 h, similarly to SNU-50. The X-ray crystal structure indicates that the framework structure of SNU-51 is entirely different from that of SNU- 50. Instead of the paddlewheel-type SBUs in SNU-50, dis- torted tetrahedral [Zn2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(OOC)4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)3] SBUs are formed, and they are linked with the square-planar tetracarboxylate, which gives rise to a PtS-type network (see Figure 4). In SNU-51 there are two crystallographically independent Zn atoms, Zn1 and Zn2. They both have distorted octahedral geometry; one through coordination of six oxygen atoms of four BDCPPI4 units, and the other through coordination of three carboxylate oxygen atoms and three DMF oxygen atoms. The network contains two types of rectangular chan- Figure 3. High-pressure gas-adsorption isotherms of SNU-50’. a) H2 at 77 K and 298 K, b) CO2 and CH4 at 298 K.

Along the b axis, there are also two types of channels with effective aperture sizes of 313 and 210 2. The channels running parallel to the c axis are completely blocked by the coordinated DMF molecules, but channels of 3  in diameter are generated on removal of the DMF (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The guest mole- cules in the framework could not be determined from the difference map due to their severe thermal disorder in the large unit cell, and thus they were characterized by EA and TGA. The void volume of the framework without any guest solvent molecules is 50% of the cell volume, while the void volume increases to 69% on removal of the coordinated DMF molecules, as estimated by PLATON.[17] The measured PXRD pattern of SNU-51 is not coincident with the simulat- ed pattern derived from the single-crystal X-ray data due to changes in the framework structure on release of the guest molecules during powder sample preparation. TGA shows that all guest molecules can be removed below 1208C, while the coordinated DMF molecules are removed slowly at 120– 4308C (see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The desolvated framework collapses according to the PXRD pat- tern. The activated solid does not absorb any gas independ- ent of the activation temperature (between 25 and 1508C under vacuum), which confirms the collapse of the frame- work. Metal-ion exchange of SNU-51: The structure of SNU-51 is composed of relatively uncommon SBUs[25] and has a large crystallographic free volume. Therefore, we explored the possibility of replacing the ZnII ions in SNU-51 with other metal ions, such as CuII, by a postsynthetic method; whereby crystals of SNU-51 were immersed in a 0.1m solution of Cu- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·2.5H2O in MeOH. The color of the crystals changed from pale yellow to green–blue in a few minutes, and then to a more intense blue over four days, as observed under an optical microscope (see Figure 5). During this process, the thin platelike crystals developed cracks and, although their transparency was retained, a single-crystal X-ray structure could not be determined for the CuII structure. Inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) for the resulting crystals indicated that 97% of the ZnII ions had been exchanged with CuII over the four days. Interest- ingly, in the MeOH solution that contained the mixture of CoII, NiII, CuII, and CdII ions, the ZnII ions in SNU-51 were exchanged only with CuII ions. In particular, the metal ex- change was very sensitive to the solvent used. For example, when DMF or 1-pentanol was used instead of MeOH, the ZnII ions in SNU-51 were not exchanged with CuII, and color of the crystals did not change. In acetone, the ex- change was extremely slow. This indicates that the diffusion of metal ions into the channels is sensitive to the size of the solvated metal ion and counteranion. To prepare the metal-ion-exchanged sample on a bulk scale, SNU-51 was pulverized and stirred in a solution of 0.1m CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·2.5H2O in MeOH for two days. The isolated powder was suspended in fresh MeOH for a further three days to remove any extra CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 inclusions from the pores. The process yielded {[Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdcppi)- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(MeOH)3]·6MeOH·7H2O}n (SNU-51-CuMeOH) as confirmed by IR, TG, and EA. The counteranion (NO3 ) of the substi- tuting metal ion was not detected in the IR spectra for any samples taken during the ion-exchange process. The PXRD pattern of SNU-51-CuMeOH was significantly broadened. However, when SNU-51-CuMeOH was immersed in DMF for 24–48 h, the PXRD pattern became similar to that of SNU- 51 (see Figure 6). In addition, the color of SNU-51-CuMeOH changed from blue to green after immersion in DMF for a few minutes, which indicated that DMF molecules had become coordinated at the CuII ions. IR, EA, and TGA con- firmed that {[Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdcppi)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmf)3]·7DMF·5H2O}n (SNU-51- CuDMF) had formed. The PXRD pattern of SNU-51-CuDMF was similar to that of SNU-51, which indicated that the framework structure was maintained during the metal ex- Figure 4.

The CuII-exchanged sample, SNU-51- CuDMF, did not undergo ion exchange with ZnII even in a concentrated solution of ZnACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 (ca. 0.1m) in MeOH. The kinetics of metal-ion exchange were followed by measuring the relative amount of ZnII to CuII in the solid at specific time intervals. During the reaction, a small portion of the solid sample was removed and converted to SNU-51- CuDMF, and the ratio of ZnII to CuII was determined by ICP- AES. The exchange of ZnII with CuII was very fast during the initial stage; 27% conversion took place within 10 min, 44% within 30 min, and 75% within 2 h. Within 6 h, 97% of ZnII in SNU-51 had been replaced with CuII (see Figure 7). This fast exchange process excludes the possibility of disso- lution followed by recrystallization; rather, it indicates direct metal-ion exchange. This type of metal-ion exchange is important for the prep- aration of new MOFs that cannot be synthesized by direct solvothermal reactions, although the mechanism is unclear at this point. The exchange described herein between ZnII and CuII in a 3D MOF is unprecedented. It had been report- ed previously that a Cd MOF could be converted to a Pb MOF, which could then be transformed back to the Cd MOF by metal-ion exchange.[14] In that case, the Cd and Pb MOFs had the same structures and could also be synthe- sized by direct solvothermal reactions. In the present work, a direct solvothermal reaction of CuII with the BDCPPI ligand yielded a NbO-type net structure, whereas the reac- tion of ZnII with the same ligand yielded a PtS-type net structure. The CuII MOF with the PtS-type net topology could be prepared only by using the postsynthetic metal-ion exchange strategy. Conclusion We have synthesized new porous MOFs, SNU-50 and SNU- 51 by utilizing a long tetracarboxylate with imide groups, H4BDCPPI. The desolvated solid (SNU-50’) adsorbs high levels of N2, H2, O2, CO2, and CH4 gases due to the presence of vacant coordination sites at the metal ions, and to the presence of imide groups in the ligands. The framework ad- sorbs 2.10 wt% of H2 at 1 atm and 77 K with an isosteric heat of H2 adsorption of 7.1 kJmol1, and a total 7.85 wt% of H2 at 77 K and 60 bar. Of particular note is the O2 ad- sorption capacity (829 cm3g1 at 77 K and 0.20 atm), which is the highest yet reported for any MOF. The solvothermal reaction of ZnII with the same ligand under similar condi- tions gives rise to SNU-51, with a PtS-type net that is entire- ly different from the NbO-type net of CuII MOF (SNU-50). Interestingly, the ZnII ions in SNU-51 could be exchanged with CuII ions to afford the CuII MOF with a PtS-type net, which could not be produced from direct solvothermal syn- thesis. This result suggests that the metal-ion-exchange strat- egy can be utilized for the synthesis of new MOFs that cannot otherwise be obtained by direct solvothermal reac- tions. Experimental Section Ligand synthesis: The synthesis of N,N’-bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)pyromel- litic diimide (H4BDCPPI) was achieved by using a modified version of a previously reported procedure:[26] 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylate dia- nhydride (2.18 g, 10 mmol) and 5-aminoisophthalic acid (3.62 g, 20 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (40 mL). The solution was heated at reflux for 8 h, and then allowed to cool to room temperature. A pale yellow crystal- line precipitate (2.80 g, 51%) was formed, which was filtered, washed with MeOH, and dried under vacuum. 1H NMR (300 MHz, [D6]DMSO, 258C): d=8.36 (s; 4H), 8.43 (s; 2H), 8.55 ppm (s; 2H); IR (KBr): n˜ = Figure 6.

Preparation of {[Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdcppi))ACHTUNGTRENUNG(MeOH)3]·6MeOH·7H2O}n (SNU-51- CuMeOH): Crystals of SNU-51 (0.75 g) were pulverized and added to a solution of CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.1m, 100 mL) in methanol, which was then stirred for 48 h. The color of the solid changed from pale yellow to blue. After 6 h and then 24 h of immersion, the CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 solution was removed by decanting, and replenished with fresh CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 solution in methanol. The compound was isolated and suspended in fresh MeOH for three days at 508C to remove any Cu or Zn salt present in the pores of the framework. During this process, the MeOH was removed by decant- ing, and was replaced with fresh MeOH at least twice.

Kinetics of metal-ion exchange: The pulverized crystals of SNU-51 were immersed in a solution of CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·2.5H2O in MeOH. A small amount of solid sample was removed at specific time intervals and suspended in DMF. The SNU-51-CuDMF was decomposed with concentrated HNO3, and the ratio of Zn/Cu was determined by ICP-AES. Selective metal-ion exchange experiment: Crystals of SNU-51 were im- mersed in a mixture of CoACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·6H2O, NiACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·6H2O, Cu- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·2.5H2O, and CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1m, 15 mL). The crystals were iso- lated from the solution after 24 h, and suspended in fresh MeOH for three days. The crystals were filtered and decomposed with concentrated HNO3. ICP-AES analysis gave the following composition: 77.4% Cu, 18.3% Zn, 1.2% Co, 1.3% Ni, and 1.9% Cd, which indicated that metal exchange was selective. X-ray crystallography: Data were collected on an Enraf Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer by using graphite-monochromated MoKa radiation (l=0.71073 ) at 298 K. Each crystal was sealed in a glass capillary to- gether with the mother liquor. Preliminary orientation matrices and unit cell parameters were obtained from the peaks of the first ten frames and then refined with the whole data set. Frames were integrated and correct- ed for Lorentz and polarization effects by using DENZO.[27] Scaling and global refinement of crystal parameters were performed by using SCA- LEPACK.[27] The structure was solved by using SHELXS-97.[28] All hy- drogen atoms were assigned on the basis of geometrical considerations and allowed to ride on the respective carbon atoms. The solvent mole- cules could not be located from the difference maps, and the residual electron density corresponding to the solvent molecules were ignored by using the SQUEEZE[29] option of PLATON.[17] Because of the disorder in the benzene rings, all atoms except Cu and O in SNU-50 were refined isotropically. CCDC-760674 and 760675 contain the supplementary crys- tallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. Crystallographic data for SNU-50 and SNU-51 are summarized in Table 2. Gas sorption measurements: Low-pressure gas adsorption–desorption measurements were performed by using Autosorb-1 or Autosorb-3B (Quantachrome Instruments). All gases used were of 99.999% purity. After gas sorption measurements, the sample was precisely weighed again. The surface area and total pore volume were determined from the N2 gas isotherm at 77 K. For multipoint BET and Langmuir surface area estimations, the data were taken in the range of P/P0=0.001–0.08 and P/ P0=0.0001–0.016, respectively. High-pressure gas sorption isotherms of SNU-50’ were measured for H2 (77 K), CO2 (298 K), and CH4 (298 K) in the range 1–60 bar by the gravimetric method with a Rubotherm magnet- ic suspension balance (MSB). Crystals of SNU-50Ac were heated at 608C Table 2. Crystallographic data for SNU-50 and SNU-51 (squeezed data).

The equation was fit with the R statistical software package,[S2] and m and n were gradually increased until the contribution of the extra added a and b coefficients became statistically insignificant in the overall fit. In this paper, m = 2 and n = 1 were employed. The isosteric heats of H2 adsorption were estimated by applying the equation, where R is the universal gas constant 0 m i st i i Q R a N = = −∑ [S1] a) L. Czepirski, J. Jagiello, Chem. Eng.

[S2] R statistical software package is available online at http://www.r-project.org. 2 Calculation of isosteric heats of adsorption for CO2 and CH4 gases: The isosteric heat of adsorption of CO2 and CH4 were calculated by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation Qst = - R*d(lnP)/d(1/T) by using the isotherms at 195, 273, 298 K. Estimation of total amounts of adsorbed gas at high pressures: The total amount of adsorbed H2 and the pore volume are expressed as follows; Ctot = Cexc + 100 1 g pore g pore d V d V × × + × Ctot is the total adsorption capacity in wt%, Cexc is the excess adsorption in wt% (i.e. the quantity measured), dg is the density of compressed gas at given temperature and pressure in gcm-3, Vpore is the pore volume in cm3g-1. Vpore = 1 1 bulk skeletal d d − where dbulk is the crystallographic density of the sample and dskeletal is the skeletal density of the material. dskletal = m/Vskeletal For high pressure H2 adsorption capacity of SNU-50’, the bulk density of the framework without coordinated DMF molecules was 0.6499 gcm-3 and dskeletal measured by He displacement was 2.8986 gcm-3. 3 Figure S1.
