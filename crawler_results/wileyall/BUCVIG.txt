Young,[c] and Jian- Ping Lang*[a,b] Keywords: Coordination polymers / Photocatalysis / Zinc / Cobalt / Doping / N ligands / Carboxylate ligands The coordination polymers (CPs) [Zn2(tipm)(1,3-BDC)2] (1) and [Co2(tipm)(1,3-BDC)2]·0.5CH3CN (2·0.5CH3CN) were synthesized by the reactions of Zn(NO3)2 or Co(NO3)2 with tetrakis[4-(1-imidazolyl)phenyl]methane (tipm) and benz- ene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1,3-H2BDC) under solvothermal conditions. Compounds 1 and 2 are isostructural and possess complicated three-dimensional frameworks with the Schläfli Introduction Photocatalysis is an environmentally friendly method for destroying organic dyes and other industrial pollutants.[1,2] Suitable coordination polymers (CPs) can exhibit excellent photocatalytic efficiencies and stabilities.[3,4] Photocatalytic efficiency can be improved by doping specific transition metal ions into CP frameworks.[5] Liu reported that the photocatalytic activity of [Zn(cca)(4,4-bipy)]n (cca = 4- carboxycinnamate dianion, 4,4-bipy = 4,4-bipyridine) towards the decomposition of rhodamine B (RhB) was en- hanced by doping with Fe3+, Cr3+, Ru3+, Co2+ or Ni2+ ions through a simple ion-exchange process.[5c] This phenome- non may be explained by the narrower band gaps (Eg) of the doped CPs. Multidentate N-donor ligands, multicarb- oxylates and their admixtures are powerful building blocks for the construction of CPs.[6] Among the various multiden- tate N-containing ligands, multipyridyl, multiimidazolyl, and multipyrazolyl ligands as well as their derivatives are commonly used, particularly bidentate examples.[6e–6h,7] Tri- and tetradentate ligands are harder to prepare and harder [a] Key Laboratory of Organic Synthesis of Jiangsu Province, Col- lege of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, P.

Cobalt ions were incorpo- rated into the Zn-based CP framework 1 during solvothermal crystallization to yield [Zn(2–2x)Co2x(tipm)(1,3-BDC)2]·bH2O (x = 2.4%, b = 0 for 1a, x = 23%, b = 1 for 2a·H2O). Doped CPs 1a and 2a·H2O exhibited greater catalytic photodegrad- ation of the dye rhodamine B (RhB) than the undoped com- plexes 1 and 2 and many literature examples. to control in designed CP syntheses.[8] The rigid ligand 3,3,5,5-tetra(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-1,1-biphenyl (L) and the auxiliary 1,3,5-tri(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene (H3BTB) have been combined with ZnSO4·7H2O to yield the two-dimen- sional network [Zn(L)0.5(CO3)]·H2O.[8e] Rigid ligands with longer branched chains were used in this case to prevent the formation of chelate compounds. In our previous studies, we have constructed CPs with imidazole ligands as the building blocks and investigated their photocatalytic activity.[9] In this work, we designed and synthesized the rigid tetraimidazolyl-based ligand tet- rakis[4-(1-imidazolyl)phenyl]methane (tipm). This four- connected ligand can be topologically represented as a tet- rahedral node and has not, to the best of our knowledge, been used hitherto to construct CPs. This ligand was chosen because (1) four imidazole N atoms of the tipm ligand can act as four potential coordination nodes and (2) the four phenyl groups can lengthen the distance to the quaternary carbon atom (Ccentre) to meet the requirements of the coor- dination geometries. We have successfully synthesized the tipm ligand in high yield through microwave heating. The solvothermal reactions of tipm and 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid (1,3-H2BDC) with Zn(NO3)2 or Co(NO3)2 gave rise to the coordination polymers [Zn2(tipm)(1,3-BDC)2] (1) and [Co2(tipm)(1,3-BDC)2]·0.5CH3CN (2·0.5CH3CN). Coordi- nation polymers 1 and 2 are isostructural and possess com- plicated 3D frameworks with the Schläfli symbol (4·72)(62·73·12)(4·62·73). The doping of different amounts of Co2+ ions into 1 during the solvothermal crystallization yielded the doped isostructural CPs [Zn(2–2x)Co2x- (tipm)(1,3-BDC)2]·bH2O (x = 2.4%, b = 0 for 1a, x = 23%, b = 1 for 2a·H2O). The photocatalytic activities of these www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER undoped and doped products were investigated with the de- gradation of RhB as a model reaction, and the results indi- cated that the doped CPs 1a and 2a exhibited higher photo- catalytic activities than the undoped 1 and 2 and many lit- erature examples. Results and Discussion The ligand tipm was synthesized by a microwave-assisted solid-state Ullmann coupling reaction between tetrakis(4- bromophenyl)methane and imidazole. The traditional solu- tion reaction requires reflux in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 2 d.[10a] The convenient method reported herein is com- plete in 90 s and uses less organic solvent. Excess imidazole was used to compensate for the possible sublimation of this reagent. The ligand tipm is stable in air and soluble in com- mon solvents such as MeOH, EtOH, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, N,N- dimethylformamide (DMF) and DMSO but insoluble in H2O. In the 1H NMR spectrum of tipm in CDCl3 at 298 K (Figure S1), three singlets at δ = 7.87, 7.29 and 7.21 ppm could be assigned to be the proton signals of the imidazole groups, and one singlet at δ = 7.38 ppm was assigned to be the proton signal of the phenyl group. The 13C NMR spec- trum of tipm in CDCl3 at 298 K exhibited signals for seven different carbon atoms of the imidazole and phenyl rings at δ = 117.9–144.7 ppm and that of the quaternary carbon atom (Ccentre) at δ = 63.7 ppm (Figure S2). The hydrother- mal reactions of Zn(NO3)2 or Co(NO3)2 with tipm and 1,3- H2BDC (molar ratio 2:1:2) in H2O/CH3CN (4:1 v/v) at 150 °C for 1 d afforded yellow blocks of 1 (62% yield) or blue blocks of 2 (54% yield). When zinc(II) and cobalt(II) nitrates were added at the ZnII/CoII/tipm/1,3-H2BDC ratios of 2:2:1:2 and 1:2:1:2, 1a and 2a could be separated with the Zn/Co ratios of 97.6:2.4 (1a) and 77:23 (2a), respectively. Increasing the percentage of Co from 1 to 1a, 2a and 2 changed the colours of these compounds from yellow (1) to orange (1a), red (2a) and blue (2; Figure S3). Complexes 1, 2, 1a and 2a are stable in air and insoluble in common solvents such as H2O, CHCl3, CH3CN, DMF and DMSO. Their elemental analyses were consistent with their chemi- cal formulas. The Zn/Co ratios in 1a and 2a were deter- mined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) analyses. The observed powder XRD (PXRD) patterns for each com- pound correlated well with the simulated ones generated from their single-crystal X-ray diffraction data (Figure S4). The IR spectra of 1, 2, 1a and 2a exhibited strong absorp- tion bands in the ranges ν˜ = 1524–1614 and 1313– 1374 cm–1, which indicated that they all contain coordi- nated carboxylic groups. The strong peaks at ν˜ ≈1068 and 655 cm–1 confirm the existence of imidazolyl groups in these complexes. The coordination polymers 1, 2·0.5CH3CN, 1a and 2a·H2O crystallize in the monoclinic space group C/2c. The asymmetric units contain two crystallographically unique MII ions, one tipm ligand, two 1,3-BDC ligands and CH3CN (2·0.5CH3CN) or H2O (2a·H2O) solvent molecules. The 3D supramolecular architectures of 1, 2, 1a and 2a are Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2015, 1981–1988 © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1982 similar except for the central metal atoms. Thus, only the structure of 1 (Figure 1, Table 1) is described in detail. Each Zn atom in 1 is tetrahedrally coordinated by two N atoms from two different tipm ligands and two O atoms from two different 1,3-BDC ligands. The average Zn–N [2.001(6) Å] and Zn–O bond lengths [1.961(5) Å] in 1 are shorter than those in [Zn2(tib)2(HBDC-OH)2(BDC-OH)]·2H2O [2.017(2) and 1.972(2) Å, respectively; tib = 1,3,5-tris(1- imidazolyl)benzene].[11] The orientations of the 1,3-BDC molecules connecting Zn1 and Zn2 are different (Figure 1, a and b); thus, the coordination sphere of Zn1 differs some- what from that of Zn2. The two 1,3-BDC ligands around Zn1 are trans with an O1–Zn1–O3A angle of 98.5(2)° and connect two neighbouring Zn1 atoms to form a 1D [Zn2(1,3-BDC)2]n chain extending along the b axis (Fig- ure 1, c). By comparison, the 1,3-BDC molecules bonded to Zn2 are cis with an O5–Zn2–O7C angle of 119.3(3)° and lead to the formation of a cyclic dinuclear [Zn2(1,3-BDC)2] unit (Figure 1, d). The 1D [Zn2(1,3-BDC)2]n chain connects to adjacent chains through tipm ligands to form a 2D [Zn2(tipm)2(1,3-BDC)2] layer (Figure 1, e), which is further interpenetrated with an adjacent layer along the bc plane (Figure 1, f). An important structural feature of these com- plexes is that each of them possesses an array (Figure S5) formed from weak edge-to-face π-π stacking interactions. The distances between the imidazole proton and the phenyl ring centroid are ca. 3.2406(4) Å (1), 3.1508(4) Å (2), 3.1769(7) Å (1a) and 3.1590(1) Å (2a), and these interac- tions play a significant role in the stabilization of the corre- sponding framework. This interpenetrated double 2D layer is connected by the aforementioned [Zn2(1,3-BDC)2] units to form a 3D framework (Figure 1, h). If each Zn1 centre, each Zn2 centre and each tipm ligand are regarded as a four-connecting node, a three-connecting node and a four- connecting node, respectively, the whole net can be simpli- fied as a 3D (3,4,4)-connected net. Compounds 1 and 2 are isostructural and possess complicated 3D frameworks with the Schläfli symbol (4·72)(62·73·12)(4·62·73) (Figure 1, i). The solvent-accessible void volumes calculated with PLA- TON24 are 25.1% for 1, 25.6% for 2, 25.1% for 1a and 24.1% for 2a. The framework stabilities of 1, 2, 1a and 2a were investi- gated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under an ambi- ent atmosphere (Figure S6). The first weight losses (1.86% for 2 and 1.57% for 2a; calculated: 1.95% for 2 and 1.70% for 2a) from 20 to 150 °C correspond to the loss of the acetonitrile molecules or water solvate. For all samples, the main weight loss was produced in the temperature range 350–600 °C and can be attributed to the decomposition of the organic linkers. The residual weights (16.03% for 1, 14.76% for 2, 15.02% for 1a and 16.21% for 2a) were calcu- lated, and the residual species were assumed to be ZnO for 1 (calcd. 15.60%), CoO for 2 (calcd. 14.25%), ZnO/CoO for 1a (calcd. 15.60%) and ZnO/Co2O3 for 2a (calcd. 15.44%). The band gap energy (Eg) of a photocatalyst is a factor in its photocatalytic efficiency.[12] The optical diffuse reflec- tance spectra of crystalline solids 1, 2, 1a and 2a (Figure S7) were recorded at room temperature, and the absorption www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER Figure 1.

(α/S) data were calculated from the reflectance by using the Kubelka–Munk (K–M) function:[13] α/S = (1 – R)2 2R α is the absorption, S is the scattering coefficient, and R is the reflectance at a given energy. The band gap energies (Eonset) obtained by extrapolation of the linear portion of the absorption edges were estimated to be 2.25 (1), 1.38 (2), 1.80V (1a) and 1.77 eV (2a), which are in the semiconductor range (Figure 2).

The photocatalytic activities of the undoped CPs 1 and 2 and the doped CPs 1a and 2a were evaluated by measur- ing the degradation of RhB in aqueous solution by absorp- Eur. J. Inorg.

The λmax at 554 nm for RhB (Figure S8) decreased with the irradiation time and particularly in the presence of 1, 2, 1a and 2a. RhB decomposed very slowly without any catalyst under the same conditions (Figure S9). Plots of log(ct/c0) versus irradiation time are given in Fig- ure 3. When the reaction solutions were mixed with equi- molar catalyst and irradiated by UV light, each substrate was almost completely decomposed within 4 h (for 1 at 4 h, 95%; for 2 at 3 h, 97%; for 1a at 2.5 h, 94%; and for 2a at 2 h, 90%). A comparison of the photodegradation param- eters for reactions catalyzed by 1, 2, 1a, 2a and some known catalysts is presented in Table 2. The times required for al- most complete degradation of RhB in the presence of 1a and 2a were comparable to those of Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2/ graphene oxide (2 h, 92%)[14a] and Ag/Pt@TiO2 (2.5 h, 99%)[14b] and significantly shorter than those (9 h) required with the photocatalysts (3-H2pya)[(3-Hpya)2Ag]- [AgAlMo6H6O24]·3H2O [pyrolysis, 3-Hpya = 3-(3-pyridyl)- acrylic acid], HNa2[(3-pya)(3-Hpya)Ag]2[AlMo6H6O24]· 8H2O (pyrolysis) and [(3-Hpya)2Ag][(H2O)2Ag]2[Al- Mo6H6O24]·2H2O (pyrolysis).[14c] The degree of degrada- tion after 4 h for reactions catalyzed by [La(HL)(L)(H2O)6- {La(H2L)0.5(α-PW11O39H)La(H2O)4}]2·8H2O, [Ce(HL)(L)- (H2O)6{Ce(H2L)0.5(α-PW11O39H)Ce(H2O)4}]2·12H2O and [Pr(HL)(L)(H2O)6{Pr(H2L)0.5(α-PW11O39H)Pr(H2O)4}]2· 8H2O (H2L = 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid) were 60, 56 and 45%, respectively.[14d] These results indicate that the doped CPs 1a and 2a are superior photocatalysts than the undoped CPs 1 and 2 and that all four CPs are comparable or better than previously reported photocatalysts, for which comparison is possible. Moreover, 2a could be recovered from the catalytic system by centrifugation and reused for a fresh photodegradation. This catalyst showed no significant decrease in efficiency even after five cycles (Figure S10). The PXRD patterns of the recycled catalyst were almost identical to those of the freshly made material; therefore, its original structural framework was retained during the photocatalytic degradation process (Figure S11). After the Figure 3. Photocatalytic degradation rate of RhB as a function of irradiation time in the presence of catalysts 1 (green), 2 (blue), 1a (yellow) and 2a (pink).

No other organic species were ob- served; thus, we assumed that the RhB was converted into CO2 and H2O.[15] To exclude the possibility that soluble metal ions assisted the RhB degradation, two control experiments were con- ducted (Figures 4 and S12). In the first, RhB solution was stirred with the catalysts overnight. In the second, the RhB solution was readjusted to 310–4 m by the addition of RhB into the centrifuged solutions after the photocatalytic degradation. As indicated in Figure 4, the degradation of RhB in the two control experiments was almost identical to the rate of the catalyst-free reaction. However, Zn(NO3)2 and Co(NO3)2 (110–4 m) could gradually degrade RhB (ca. 75% after 4 h, Figure S13) under similar conditions. These results indicated that there were no soluble metal ions in the degradation system and that the catalysts did not decompose or leach ions during this reaction. Figure 4.

The mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation of or- ganic molecules by metal catalysts in aqueous solution was reported[4a,4b] to involve the following steps: electrons (e–) of the metal complexes are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), and simultaneously, the Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2015, 1981–1988 © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1985 same number of holes (h+) are formed in the VB. Then, O2 or OH– adsorbed on the surfaces of the complexes interact with the electrons (e–) of the CB or holes (h+) in the VB, respectively, to form hydroxy radicals (·OH). The hydroxy radicals are highly active and decompose the organic pol- lutants into CO2 and H2O (Scheme S1a). The doped cata- lysts possess a narrower band gap (Eg) than the undoped catalysts, which may accelerate this photocatalytic activity (Scheme S1b). Conclusions We have demonstrated the formation of the isostructural coordination polymers 1 and 2 from the reactions of Zn(NO3)2 or Co(NO3)2 with tipm and 1,3-H2BDC under solvothermal conditions. These coordination polymers have a unique 3D framework with a Schläfli symbol (4·72)(62·73·12)(4·62·73). Under the irradiation of UV light (365 nm), compounds 1 and 2 exhibit good catalytic activity in the photodegradation of RhB. The partial isomorphic substitution of Zn by Co ions is described, and the resulting doped CPs 1a and 2a have higher photocatalytic activities than the undoped catalysts 1 and 2. As a representative ex- ample, 2a can be recycled and reused at least five times without the loss of catalytic photodegradation performance. These results further demonstrate the importance of metal doping to the tuning of the properties of materials. Experimental Section General Methods: Chemicals and reagents were obtained from com- mercial sources and used as received. Tetrakis(4-bromophenyl) methane was prepared from tetraphenylmethane by a literature method.[10] Infrared spectra (KBr disk, 400–4000 cm–1) were ob- tained with a Nicolet iS10 spectrometer. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were performed with a Carlo–Erba CHNO-S microana- lyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a TA SDT-2960 analyzer (heating rate of 10 °C/min). The PXRD mea- surements were performed with a PANalytical X’Pert PRO MPD system (PW3040/60). The solid-state UV/Vis spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrometer at room temperature in the range λ = 200–800 nm. The UV/Vis absorption spectra of RhB aqueous solutions were recorded with a Varian Cary-50 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER Tetrakis[4-(1-imidazolyl)phenyl]methane (tipm): A mixture of tet- rakis(4-bromophenyl)methane (0.636 g, 1 mmol), imidazole (0.68 g, 10 mmol), K2CO3 (0.828 g, 6 mmol) and CuI (0.076 g, 0.4 mmol) was finely ground and then heated under microwave ir- radiation (720 W) for 90 s (Scheme 1).

Crystallographic Data Collection and Refinement: Single crystals of 1, 2·0.5CH3CN, 1a and 2a·H2O suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained directly from the above preparations. With an enhanced X-ray source (Mo-Kα, λ = 0.71073 Å), the data for 1 and 1a were recorded with a Rigaku Saturn 724 CCD diffractometer, the data for 2 were recorded with a Bruker D8 QUEST diffractometer, and the data for 2a were recorded with an Aglient Gemini Atlas dif- fractometer. Each single crystal was mounted on a glass fibre at 293 K. The cell parameters were refined with the programs Crys- talClear (version 1.3, Rigaku Inc.), Bruker-SAINT and CrysAlis- Pro (version 1.171.36.32, Agilent Technologies), respectively, and absorption corrections (multiscan) were applied. The reflection data were also corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The crystal structures were solved by direct methods and refined on F2 by full-matrix least-squares methods with the SHELXL-2013 program.[16] A large amount of spatially delocalized electron den- sity in the lattice of each compound was found, but acceptable refinement results could not be obtained for this electron density. Thus, the water solvent contribution to the scattering factors has been taken into account with SQUEEZE in the Platon program suite. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically idealized positions and constrained to ride on their parent atoms. Selected bond lengths and bond angles for 1 and 2 are listed in Table 1. A sum- mary of key crystallographic data for 1, 2, 1a and 2a is given in Table 3. CCDC-1033791 (for 1), -1033792 (for 2·0.5CH3CN), -1041854 (for 1a) and -1041844 (for 2a·H2O) contain the supplementary crystal- lographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/datarequest/cif. Photocatalytic Activity Study: The photocatalytic activities of the solid samples 1, 2, 1a and 2a were evaluated for the model degrada- tion of RhB in aqueous solution. An aqueous solution (50 mL) of RhB with a concentration of 0.14 gL–1 (ca. 310–4 m) was mixed with the catalyst (10 mg), magnetically stirred in the dark for 2 h to ensure the equilibrium of adsorption/desorption and then irradi- ated with a 400W (365 nm) high-pressure mercury lamp. The mix- ture was stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer. At regular time intervals, a 1 mL sample was collected, filtered and diluted to 10 mL in a volumetric flask. The UV/Vis absorption maxima of RhB at 554 nm was chosen to monitor the photocatalytic degrada- tion process.
