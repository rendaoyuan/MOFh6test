Introduction Supramolecular isomerism presents a common phenomenon in crystal engineering covering both hydrogen-bonding and coordination frameworks.[1–3] If they show identical composi- tion, we call them “polymorphs”, whereas, as defined recently by Zhou and co-workers,[4 ]compounds with the same frame- work formula but different guest molecules are called “frame- work isomers”. The driving force for the formation of the latter is typically triggered by diverse perturbation factors, such as the conformation of ligands, pH value, solvent, temperature, reagent concentration, as well as template molecules.[5] Thus, it is believed that the rational synthesis of such materials remains even more elusive and further systematic studies by means of diversified conditions are important and of great interest. The motivation for such framework isomers is driven not only by the tremendous challenge in their synthesis, contain- ing the preparation of high-quality single crystals for structure solution and the purity for each isomer, but also by the signifi- cant application towards tunable porosity or even exquisite changes in physical or chemical properties.[4] Thereby, a large number of polymorphs or framework isomers were deliberately obtained, but rarely more than two isomers were disclosed.[4,6] Moreover, more and more framework isomers were manifested to display fine-tuned porosity,[7] especially regarding aspects of controlling interpenetration towards non-interpenetration.[8] However, due to the difficult synthesis of such compounds, ex- amples with periodic-increased porosity were also seldom documented in the literature.[9] Therefore, the design and syn- thesis of multiple types and periodic-increased porosity of such materials are still challenging aspects of crystal engineering. We became interested in the design and preparation of MOFs based on big-skeleton acylamide ligands, because of its various ways of forming connections containing both coordi- nation sites and H-bonding sites, making it thus valuable for the construction of porous and luminescence MOFs, and espe- cially because of the functional acylamide group, which shows high-affinity towards CO2.[10] However, its big-skeleton-nature often induces interpenetration typically largely decreasing the porosity of the resulting MOFs. To avoid this was one of the main goals. Furthermore, the abundance of conformations of the acylamide ligand is proposed to bring structural diversities. In this regard, a systematic research of big-skeleton acylamide- based MOFs by means of modulating various reaction condi- tions is of great interest and important. Herein, a variety of reaction conditions such as reaction time, reaction temperature, and concentration of solution were Three new metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were prepared by solvo(hydro)thermolysis and further characterized as frame- work isomers. The structural transformation from non-porous to porous MOFs and the purity of these products can be modulated by controlling the reaction temperature. The peri- odic-increased porosity observed was further confirmed by CO2 adsorption isotherms. Owing to the presence of acylamide groups in the pore walls and the flexible nature of the skeleton of these MOFs, highly selective CO2 adsorption over N2 was ob- served, as well as structure-dependent periodic varieties in lu- minescence properties.

KGaA, Weinheim ChemPhysChem 2013, 14, 3594 – 3599 3594 CHEMPHYSCHEM ARTICLES systematically explored for the four-connecting diamondoid (dia) net structure, consisting of Zn(L)(bpdc)·(H2O)0.5 (1, L=N,N- bis(3-pyridyl)benzene-1,3-dicarboxamide, H2bpdc=biphenyl- 4,4’-dicarboxylic acid) with a nine-fold interpenetration. Three framework isomers, including different numbers and species of solvent molecules, can be generated and their formation is solely controlled by the variation in reaction temperature af- fecting structural features and the periodic-increased porosity. 2. Results and Discussion Crystal Structure The framework isomers Zn(L)(bpdc)·(H2O)0.5 (1, Cc), Zn(L)- (bpdc)·(DMF) (2, DMF=dimethylformamide, P2/c), and Zn(L)- (bpdc)·(H2O)2·(DMF) (3, P21/c) were prepared by solvo- (hydro)thermolysis of Zn(NO3)2, H2bpdc, and L in the ratio of 1:1:1 in DMF/H2O (4:1). As the solvents could not be exactly determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, thermogravimet- ric (TG) and elemental analyses were used to confirm the structures. The structure of 1 was determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography studies, giving a monoclinic acentral Cc space group. The tetracoordinated ZnII site binds to two bpdc2 oxygen atoms and two L nitrogen atoms, creating a tetrahedral geometry. The bpdc2 ligand adopts a bi(monodentate) mode, and both ligands bpdc2 and L connect each to two ZnII ions. Ligand bpdc2 is substantially twisted with a dihedral angel of approximately 47.78 for two benzene rings. Typically, both the bpdc2 and the L ligands connect ZnII ions to generate a four- connecting dia net with a nine-fold interpenetration in the 3+ 3+3 mode. (Figure 1) The acentral Cc space group is mainly due to the existence of two unequal organic ligands and the odd number of interpenetration. Interpenetrating of dia nets is known in the literature; numerous cases show lower and even number interpenetrations. In contrast, only few MOFs display higher and odd number interpenetrations.[11] Moreover, due to interpenetration, the free volume is largely reduced to only 3.0%, indicative of the almost non-porous framework of 1.[12] In contrast to 1 synthesized at 1208C, the same material at a lower reaction temperature of 1008C, gives rise to polymer 2. Interestingly, the framework formula of 1 and 2 is identical, indicative of their framework isomerism. Although the coordi- nation surrounding, the coordination geometry of the ZnII ion, and the coordination mode of both ligand species is the same as observed in 1, the final structure of 2 is very different. Poly- mer 2 shows a 2D four-connecting square (sql) net with a three-fold interpenetration in parallel fashion. The dihedral angel for the two benzene rings of the bpdc2 ligand is now approximately 34.98. Despite interpenetration, regular 1D chan- nels with a diameter of 7.1  occupied by DMF molecules are observed along the c direction (Figure 2). The solvent-accessi- ble volume, calculated by the PLATON program,[12] is approxi- mately 36.2% of the unit cell, much higher than that ob- served for 1 (3.0%). Strikingly, the interpenetration mode of 2 has not been observed before, showing special triple-stranded molecular braids consisting of ZnII and bpdc2 ligands (see the Supporting Information, Fig- ure S1). In the literature reports on triple-stranded molecular braids in discrete 1D arrays can be found,[13] but 2D net forma- tion based on such triple- stranded molecular braids has, to the best of our knowledge, never been disclosed before. To gain further insight into the effect of the reaction tem- perature on the net structure, a low temperature of 808C was chosen, and yet another frame- work isomer (3) was obtained. It is necessary to point out that no such severe changes were observed as presented for 1 and 2. Moreover, 2 and 3 are highly similar in their coordina- tion surrounding, geometry, and Figure 1. Coordination surrounding of ZnII, framework topology, and interpenetration of polymers 1, 2, 3.  2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the combination of ZnII and bpdc2 ligands in 3 are organized in a common, parallel fashion, rather than in the triple-stranded molecular braid as discovered for 2. Moreover, in 3 the coordination ge- ometry of ZnII is rather of square-planar-nature with the li- gands L effectively in anti-position, that is, on opposite sides. The dihedral angel is changed to approximately 38.68 for the two benzene rings of the bpdc2 ligand. The porosity is ex- panded to 42.3% of the cell volume, calculated by the PLATON program (Figure 3).[12] Optimization of Reaction Conditions To confirm whether the formation of polymers 1–3 is only tem- perature-dependent and to test the purity of the bulk samples at various temperatures from 80–1208C, a systematic investiga- tion based on various synthesis conditions (SC), including reac- tion time, concentration of solution, and reaction temperature, was carried out. The results are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the formation of polymers 1–3 is only tempera- ture-dependent, indicative of a completely thermodynamic process. At intermediate temperatures such as 90 and 1108C mixed phases of 3+2 or 2+1 were obtained. Thus, the role of various reaction temperatures in the case of controlling multi- ple types of framework isomers and periodic-increased porosi- ty can be rationalized in such way that higher temperatures afford a more thermodynamically stable, denser interpenetrat- ed framework, whereas lower temperatures generate less ther- modynamically stable, porous interpenetrated frameworks. Moreover, in order to determine the relatively structural stabili- ty of these isomers presented herein and to deepen the under- standing of their formation pathways controlled by various re- action temperatures, a density functional theory (DFT) calcula- tion was carried out to analyze the relative energies of the three isomers. The results indicate that polymer 3 is more stable than polymers 1 and 2, as the relative energy order is 1(0 kcalmol1) > 2(8.06 kcalmol1) > 3(19.92 kcalmol1). Furthermore, the results also imply that the transformation barrier between them is relatively low, such as 8.06 kcalmol1 for 2!1 and 11.86 kcalmol1 for 3!2, suggesting that the higher temperature clearly enhances the tendency for transfor- mations of 3 into 2, or of 2 into 1, in agreement with the cur- rent results and the suggestion that the formation of polymers 1–3 is a thermodynamic process. Adsorption and Luminescence Properties To evaluate the thermostability of the framework skeleton and to confirm the permanent porosity of these materials, ther- mogravimetric analysis, various temperature powder X-ray dif- fraction (PXRD) studies, as well as N2 adsorption was investigat- ed. There is almost no weight loss of 1 until 3858C, indicative of high thermostability, in good agreement with the structure, whereas the loss of 9.8% below 2908C and 14.9% below 3008C correspond to the removal of guest molecules for 2 (one DMF) and 3 (one DMF and two water molecules), respec- tively (Figure 4). The XRD pattern of the as-synthesized poly- mers 1–3 showed good agreement with the simulated pattern based on their X-ray crystal structures, indicative of the purity of their phases.

Given the thermodynam- ically stable nonporous structure of 1, its various temperature XRDs were not explored. Furthermore, samples of 2 and 3 with methanol as solvent guest molecules (the exchange took 2 days) were degassed under high vacuum at 1008C for 12 h to carry out N2 adsorption, showing almost no N2 adsorption (Figure 5). Given the aperture of the polymers 2 (diameter of 7.1 ) and 3 (3.75.2 ) and the kinetic diameter of N2 (3.64 ), it is proposed that the removal of guest molecules causes a movement in the interpenetrating nets, and conse- quently leads to constricted pore sizes.[14] In contrast, the CO2 isotherm of 2 and 3 at 273 K reveal a typical CO2 adsorption behavior and are marked by a pronounced hysteresis between adsorption and desorption and a step-like or even multistep adsorption isotherm (Figure 5). This suggests that the adsorp- tion mechanism proceeds over guest-responsive structural re- arrangements and supports the proposed dynamic framework behavior of polymer 2 and.[14] Generally speaking, the distor- tion of organic/inorganic building blocks, movements of inter- penetrating nets, or conformational changes of organic ligands are common signs of the dynamic properties of MOFs.[15] In the present cases, the movements of interpenetrating nets are viewed as important contributors to the adsorption behav- ior. The flexibility of the interpenetrating frameworks of poly- mers 2 and 3 should be distinct, as the existence of the triple- stranded molecular braids in 2 restricts the movements of the interpenetrating nets more or less. Accordingly, the relatively bigger hysteresis and multi-step adsorption isotherm of 3 can be rationalized as a cause of the higher flexibility of the inter- penetrating framework. The CO2 adsorption capacities at 1 atm are 45.4 cm3g1 (2) and 55.9 cm3g1 (3), comparable with re- ported results in the literature.[16] Two additional factors such as favorable host–guest interactions derived from the acyla- Table 1.

The higher CO2 ad- sorption capacity of polymer 3 compared to 2 should be corre- lated with the relatively higher porosity and higher flexibility of the interpenetrating net of 3. The luminescence properties of polymers 1–3 in the solid were also explored. The excitation and emission spectra are shown in Figure 6. If excited at 334, 322, and 320 nm, polymers 1–3 emit at 417, 370, and 348 nm, respectively, implying that the luminescence properties are structure-dependent. The fluo- rescence lifetimes of 1–3 were also measured, giving 10, 5.8, and 22 ns, respectively. Both the bpdc2 and the L ligand are luminescent in the emission region of blue light, thus it is be- lieved that the blue emission observed in the polymers 1–3 is derived from their ligands. The different solvent molecules contained in the various polymer structures might then be re- sponsible for the structure-dependent luminescence properties. 3. Conclusions We reported the synthesis, structure, luminescence and ad- sorption properties of three framework isomers in detail. Their structural features are a nine-fold interpenetrating dia net, and two three-fold interpenetrating sql nets. We systematically investigated for the first time big-skeleton acylamide-based MOFs by modulating various reaction condi- tions and revealed several exciting results involving multiple types of framework isomers, periodic-increased porosity, and structure-dependent periodic-changed luminescence proper- ties, as well as selective CO2 absorption over N2. Both experi- mental and DFT studies revealed that the formation of the pre- sented framework isomers are only temperature-sensitive. To some extent, this work thus opens up a promising way to control structure diversity, interpenetration, porosity, and even physical properties in big-skeleton acylamide-based MOFs. Experimental Section Synthesis of Polymers 1–3 A DMF/H2O solution (5 mL, 4:1) of Zn(NO3)2, H2bpdc, and L in a ratio of 1:1:1 was sealed in a Teflon reactor, heated at 1208C (1) / 1008C (2) / 808C (3) for 2 days, and then cooled to room tempera- ture at 38Ch1. Subsequently, block crystals were obtained in 79% (1) / 76% (2) / 84% (3) yield based on Zn. Elemental analysis (%) for 1: calc: C 61.59, H 3.55, N 8.97; found: C 60.89, H 3.38, N 8.82; for 2: calc: C 60.31, H 4.19, N 10.05; found: C 61.23, H 4.01, N 10.14; and for 3: calc: C 57.34, H 4.54, N 9.55; found: C 58.23, H 4.61, N 9.37. X-ray Crystallography Diffraction intensities of all compounds were collected on a Bruker Apex CCD area-detector diffractometer (MoKa, l=0.71073 ). Absorption corrections were applied by using the multi-scan pro- gram SADABS. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined with a full-matrix least-squares technique within the SHELXTL program package. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. The organic hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically (CH 0.96 ), except for those on the acylamide groups which were found first then restricted by NH=0.850.01 . The guest molecules of polymers 2 and 3 could not be exactly determined and were treated by the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON.[12] For all structures, the amount of the guest molecules was determined by TGA results and element analysis.
