Cheetham et al., Bu et al., and Henderson et al. prepared Mg-based chiral materials.[8c,10] Maji et al. re- ported temperature-and stoichiometry-controlled dimen- sionality in a magnesium–4,5-imidazoledicarboxylate sys- tem.[11] Zhou et al. reported the role of open metal sites in [a] Department of Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, P.

The metal-only structure of 2 is a hexagonal network, in which the cavities are occupied by free water molecules. The adsorption properties of 1 and 2 have been investigated. The hydrogen adsorption and desorption curves of the two polymers show an unusual, pronounced hysteresis behavior. MOFs, Thomton et al. reported Mg-decorated fullerenes in MOFs for methane and hydrogen storage, and Zhang et al. reported Mg-based MOFs that exhibited hydrogen sorption hystereses.[12] Compared to the many reported 3d- and 4f- metal-based MOFs, it is clear that reports on Mg-based MOFs are scarce.[13] To the best of our knowledge, the ap- plication of LnIII–MgII heterometallic frameworks on the adsorption of hydrogen has not been reported. Multidentate carboxylic acids, such as oxydiacetic acid (H2oda) and pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (H2pda), have proved to be ideal ligands for forming coordination poly- mers with special properties.[14,15] In our investigations on heterometallic MOFs with these ligands, we found that the polymers bear a high concentration of unsaturated metal centers, which can potentially adsorb H2 on removal of the coordinated water molecules. Inspired by these results, we set out to prepare two new heterometallic polymers using LaIII and MgII with H2oba and H2pda. We describe the preparation, structures, and adsorption properties of the two new LaIII–MgII hetero- metallic polymers {[La2(oda)6Mg2] [Mg(H2O)6]·6H2O}n (1) and {[La2(pda)6Mg3(H2O)6]·11H2O}n (2). Results and Discussion Crystal Structure of 1 X-ray structure analysis reveals that 1 crystallizes in the cubic crystal system, space group Fd3¯c. Most of the re- ported Ln3+–M2+ (M = Co, Mn, Cu, etc.) polymers based on H2oda crystallize in hexagonal crystal systems,[14d–14i] and those that crystallize in cubic crystal systems are rela- tively rare.[14a,14j,14k] The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of one independent La3+ ion, two independent Mg2+ ions Y. Xu, Y.-X. Che, F.-Y. Cheng, J.-M. Zheng FULL PAPER (Mg12+ and Mg22+), one independent oda2– anion, one in- dependent coordinated water molecule, and one indepen- dent free water molecule. The coordination environments of La1, Mg1, and Mg2 are presented in Figure 1. La3+ is nine- coordinate with a distorted tricapped trigonal-prismatic ge- ometry, which is composed of six carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2) and three alkoxo oxygen atoms (O3) from three oda2– anions to form an [La(oda)3]3– unit [La1–O2 2.505(4), La1– O3 2.540(5) Å]. Mg12+ is six coordinate with a regular octa- hedral geometry, which is composed of six carboxylate oxy- gen O1 atoms from six neighboring [La(oda)3]3– units [Mg1–O1 2.057(4) Å]. Mg22+ is also six-coordinate with an octahedral geometry, which is composed of six O4 atoms from six water molecules to form an [Mg2(H2O)6]2+ unit [Mg2–O4 2.095(6), La1···Mg2 5.656(3), Mg1–Mg2 5.656(3) Å]. Each oda2– anion acts as a pentadentate ligand, which bridges one La3+ and two Mg12+ ions in a μ3:η1,η1,η1,η1,η1 coordination mode. Each [La(oda)3]3– unit is surrounded by six Mg12+ ions, which creates a cubic lattice with 3D cavities in the structure [La1–Mg1 6.531(4), Mg1–Mg1 9.236(8) Å]. As shown in Figure 2, there are two types of cavities that are arrayed alternatively along three directions, in which the larger cavities are occupied by [Mg2(H2O)6]2+ units, which is the thermodynamically stable species required to neutralize the charge of the MOF, whereas the smaller cavities are occupied by free water mo- lecules. In view of the topology, the metal-only matrix of LaIII and Mg1II ions can be described as an NaCl network (Figure S1). Further analysis of the crystal packing reveals that this structure contains extensive hydrogen bonding be- tween the coordinated (O4) and free (O5) water molecules. The most significant of these are O4···O5 [3.216(1) Å] and O5···O5 [2.440(4) Å], which afford an (H2O)4 hydrogen- bonding chain to link adjacent [Mg2(H2O)6]2+ units and form an interesting twofold 3D supramolecular network. The twofold 3D supramolecular networks interpenetrate with the metal-only NaCl network and form a threefold interpenetrated topology (Figure 3). Additionally, the carb- oxylate O2 atoms are involved in hydrogen-bonding interac- tions with water molecules (O4) from the [Mg2(H2O)6]2+ units [O2 ···O4 3.594(3) Å], which play an important role in Figure 1.

The total volume access- ible for potential water molecules determined by PLATON calculations is about 14.0% of void per unit volume (poten- tial solvent area volume 2501.3 Å3, per unit-cell volume of 17831.0 Å3).[16] Figure 2.

C and H atoms are omitted for clarity. Crystal Structure of 2 X-ray structure analysis reveals that 2 crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system, space group P6/mcc. The asym- metric unit of 2 consists of one independent La3+ ion, one independent Mg2+ ion, one independent pda2– anion, one independent coordinated water molecule, and three inde- pendent free water molecules. La3+ is nine-coordinate, and its coordination is completed by six carboxylate O2 atoms and three N1 atoms from three pda2– ligands to form an [La(pda)3]3– unit [La1–O2 2.518(1), La1–N1 2.629(2) Å] Two New LaIII–MgII Heterometallic Polymers (Figure 4). Mg12+ is six-coordinate in a slightly distorted octahedral geometry with four oxygen (O1) atoms from [La(pda)3]3– in the equatorial plane and two oxygen (O3) atoms from two free water molecules at the apical sites [Mg1–O1 2.085(3), Mg1–N1 2.107(4) Å]. Each pda2– anion acts as a pentadentate ligand, which bridges one La3+ and two Mg2+ ions in a μ3:η1,η1,η1,η1,η1 coordination mode. Each [La(pda)3]2– unit links six adjacent Mg12+ ions through the carboxylate groups to generate a new 3D hex- agonal network structure with 1D cavities along the c axis. The metal-only lattice in the packing diagram can be de- scribed as a 4,6-connected hexagonal topology (Figure S2). Further analysis of the crystal packing reveals that this structure also contains extensive hydrogen-bonding interac- tions between the coordinated O3 and free O4, O5, and O6 water molecules [O4···O6 2.724(3)/2.810(2), O4···O3 2.884(1)/3.029(4) Å] where each free water oxygen atom po- sition was refined disordered equally between OA and OB with equivalent thermal parameters.

KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 5301 H2O6 molecules form a coplanar water cluster with a hex- agonal gear-wheel geometry by O4···O6 and O4···O3 hydro- gen-bonding interactions. The average O···O distance is ca. 2.86 Å, which is slightly longer than the corresponding value of 2.759 Å in ice.[17] In addition, two O5 atoms lie on the center of the plane of the water cluster with an O5A···O6A interaction [2.701(6) Å], which links neigh- boring water clusters into a unique 1D chain (Figure S3). These free water molecules abound in the cavities of the structure (Figure 5). The total volume accessible for poten- tial water molecules determined by PLATON calculations is about 22.6% of void per unit volume (potential solvent area volume 727.6 Å3, per unit-cell volume of 3213.9 Å3).[16] Adsorption Properties of 1 and 2 The dehydration of 1 and 2 will leave many cavities and unsaturated metal ions, which can potentially adsorb H2 molecules; therefore, the adsorption properties of 1 and 2 were studied. The solid–gas adsorption properties of 1 and 2 were evaluated towards H2 (77 and 305 K) and N2 (77 K). At 305 K, they exhibited a low hydrogen uptake, and the maximum hydrogen adsorption capacity under 5000 mbar for 1 and 2 was 0.05 and 0.20%, respectively. At 77 K, the maximum hydrogen adsorption capacity reached 0.27 and 0.73% under approximately 5000 mbar for 1 and 2, respec- tively (Figure 6). Under low pressure, the two polymers showed pronounced hysteresis in their adsorption and de- Figure 6.

Y. Xu, Y.-X. Che, F.-Y. Cheng, J.-M. Zheng FULL PAPER sorption H2 isotherms, which may be ascribed to the dehy- drated MgII sites and the indented narrow channels of the two structures.[18] To date, only a few MOFs have shown such a pronounced hysteresis adsorption behavior.[18b,19] Conversely, 1 and 2 only adsorb a negligible amount of N2 (Figure S4). Desolvated 1 and 2 show Brunauer–Emmett– Teller (BET) surface areas of 6.39 and 8.57 m2g–1, respec- tively (measured by using nitrogen). Compared to some re- ported polymers with large hydrogen adsorptions,[20] the amounts of adsorbed hydrogen in 1 and 2 are smaller; how- ever, these compounds will enrich the exploration of hydro- gen storage in heterometallic frameworks. Thermal Properties and PXRD The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves show that free and coordinated water molecules are removed in the range 25–300 and 25–220 °C for 1 and 2, respectively. Poly- mers 1 and 2 showed 15.78 and 18.16% weight loss of the guest and coordinated water molecules, which is in agree- ment with the calculated values of 15.89 and 18.57%, respectively. The decomposition of 1 occurred at 370 °C, and the framework of 2 was stable up to ca. 450 °C (Fig- ure S5). The simulated and experimental powder X-ray dif- fraction (PXRD) patterns of 1 and 2 at room temperature are in good agreement, which proves the phase purity of the as-synthesized product. The thermal stability of 1 and 2 was also demonstrated by variable-temperature PXRD from 20–370 °C for 1 and 20–450 °C for 2 (Figure 7). Above 95 °C for 1 and 180 °C for 2, variations in the diffraction intensities were observed in the PXRD patterns, which may be ascribed to small structural rearrangements that occur Figure 7.

Chem. 2011, 5299–5304 5302 with the departure of the water molecules.[21] Above 370 °C for 1 and 450 °C for 2, the order disappears, and amorph- ous phases are observed. Photoluminescent Properties Photoluminescence experiments were performed at room temperature on 1 and 2 in the solid state. A blue emission with a maximum at 395 nm was detected when 1 was irradi- ated at 255 nm (Figure S6). This emission was very weak, because there are too many water molecules in 1 and no π– π* transition of the oda2– ligand. Polymer 2 exhibits an in- tense blue emission peak at 413 nm (λex = 310 nm), which can be assigned to the π–π* transition of pda2–.[22] Conclusions Two new 3D LaIII–MgII heterometallic frameworks were successfully obtained under solvothermal conditions. Poly- mer 1 is an unusual, anionic, porous MOF, which contains interesting twofold interpenetrating 3D hydrogen-bonded supramolecular networks. Polymer 2 is a porous MOF whose cavities are occupied by 1D water molecules. The two polymers are the first examples of LaIII–MgII heterometallic frameworks used to investigate hydrogen adsorption. The two polymers show pronounced hysteresis in their H2 ad- sorption and desorption isotherms. Although the amounts of adsorbed hydrogen in 1 and 2 are small, they are helpful examples for the exploration of hydrogen gas storage prop- erties of heterometallic frameworks. It is believed that more LnIII–MgII heterometallic polymers with interesting struc- tures as well as excellent physical properties will be synthe- sized. Experimental Section Materials and General Procedures: All reagents were commercially available and used as received without purification. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were carried out with a Perkin–Elmer analyzer. TGA experiments were performed with a NETZSCH TG 209 instrument with a heating rate of 5 °Cmin–1. PXRD measure- ments were recorded with a D/Max-2500 X-ray diffractometer by using Cu-Kα radiation at room temperature. The pressure–compo- sition–temperature curves for hydrogen adsorption were carried out with a computer-controlled “gas reaction controller” apparatus, which was manufactured by the Advanced Materials Corp. and Hiden Isochema (IGA 001, Hiden Analytical Ltd.),[23] and ultra- high-purity hydrogen (99.999%) was used. For the measurements, approximately 500 mg of sample was taken in a stainless-steel sam- ple holder outgassed at 300 °C for 1 and 250 °C for 2 under 10–1 Pa vacuum for about 8 h. The volume in the hydrogen adsorption pro- cess was carefully calibrated before the measurement. The hydrogen adsorption was carried out at 77 and 298 K. The hydrogen adsorp- tion amount was defined as the ratio of the mass gain and the mass of the starting polymers plus adsorbed hydrogen. The surface area and micropore volume of 1 and 2 were measured with an ASAP 2020 V3.00 H apparatus by using nitrogen gas. Synthesis of {[La2(oda)6Mg2][Mg(H2O)6]·6H2O}n (1): A mixture of La2O3 (0.5 mmol, 0.16 g), MgO (1.5 mmol, 0.06 g), and H2oda Two New LaIII–MgII Heterometallic Polymers (3 mmol, 0.40 g) was dissolved in distilled water (8 mL) and ethanol (2 mL). The pH was adjusted to 4 with triethylamine. The resulting solution was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel ves- sel, which was sealed and heated at 140 °C for 72 h. After the reac- tor had been cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C/h, color- less cubic crystals were collected by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried in air.

The pH was adjusted to 5 with triethylamine. The resulting solution was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel ves- sel, which was sealed and heated at 160 °C for 72 h.

X-ray Crystallographic Determinations: Single-crystal analyses were performed with a Bruker SMART 1000 CCD diffractometer with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) by the ω-2θ scan technique. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 fol- lowed by structure refinement on F2 with SHELXL-97.[24] All non- hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Aromatic and ali- phatic hydrogen atoms were assigned to calculated positions with isotropic thermal parameters. The hydrogen atoms bonded to oxy- gen atoms of coordinated water molecules were located from differ- ence maps and refined subject to O–H distance restraints. The hy- drogen atoms of free water could not be located due to the disorder of the free water molecules in 2; the final formula of this polymer was determined from elemental analysis and TGA.
