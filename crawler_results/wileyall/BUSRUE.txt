Venkata Rao,[c] Srinivasan Sampath,[b] Subi J. George,*[c] and Tapas Kumar Maji*[a, c] Abstract: Molecular organization of donor and acceptor chromophores in self-assembled materials is of paramount interest in the field of photovoltaics or mimicry of natural light-harvesting systems. With this in mind, a redox-active porous interpenetrated metal–organic framework (MOF), {[Cd(bpdc)(bpNDI)]·4.5H2O·DMF}n (1) has been constructed from a mixed chromophoric system. The m-oxo-bridged secondary building unit, {Cd2(m-OCO)2}, guides the parallel alignment of bpNDI (N,N’-di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene- diimide) acceptor linkers, which are tethered with bpdc (bpdcH2=4,4’-biphenyldicarboxylic acid) linkers of another entangled net in the framework, resulting in photochro- mic behaviour through inter-net electron transfer. Encap- sulation of electron-donating aromatic molecules in the electron-deficient channels of 1 leads to a perfect donor– acceptor co-facial organization, resulting in long-lived charge-separated states of bpNDI. Furthermore, 1 and guest encapsulated species are characterised through electrochemical studies for understanding of their redox properties. The spatial organization of organic chromophores in self-as- sembled scaffolds is important for understanding and control- ling the processes in artificial light-harvesting systems and in various optoelectronic devices.[1] However, the development of such supramolecular organizations that can harvest visible light and guide excitation energy or electron transfer in a con- trolled manner impose a real challenge. Recently, the percep- tion of photofunctional metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with chromophoric linkers as an organised matrix of light harvesters has moved to the fore.[2] The concept of crystal engineering and reticular chemistry based on predesigned organic linkers and secondary building units (SBU) allows the desired spatial organization of organic chromophores in MOFs and, hence, the intermolecular distances and angles between the organic linkers can be controlled.[3] MOFs have already drawn substan- tial attention for their potential applications in several fields, such as gas storage, separation, catalysis and drug delivery, based on their permanent porosity.[4] However, the well-de- fined nanopores provide additional design potential for in- corporating chromophoric guest molecules to modulate the photophysical processes.[5] This design has been extensively used for light harvesting in MOFs with tuneable luminescent properties.[2a,e,5c] On the other hand, redox-active multichromo- phoric frameworks that exhibit electron transfer between the linkers or with guest molecules have been underexplored. Such a design would give extended donor–acceptor arrays with specific organization, which would exhibit interesting charge-transport or ferroelectric properties or may act as shape-selective sensors.[6] Although co-facial donor–acceptor assemblies, which often lead to partial charge-transfer com- plexes, are well studied, achieving complete electron transfer requires better control of the spatial organization of the mo- lecular components.[1c] In this respect, we envisaged that mixed chromophoric MOFs can be useful for grafting suitable donors (D) and acceptors (A) with long range order. Entangle- ment of frameworks would be one of the strategies for achiev- ing close contacts of D and A chromophoric linkers to realise photoinduced charge or electron transfer. For this purpose, we have turned our attention to the aro- matic redox-active naphthalenediimides (NDIs). NDIs are planar, chemically robust and easily reducible molecules that have been utilised as efficient electron-accepting chromo- phores (n-type) in different applications, such as in photosyn- thesis, solar energy conversion, electrochromic devices, mo- lecular electronics, and as photochromic materials.[7] We have chosen a pyridine-substituted NDI derivative, that is, bpNDI (N,N’-di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide) as the pillar[8] and bpdcH2 (4,4’-biphenyldicarboxylic acid) as the linker for the construction of a novel redox-active framework {[Cd(bpdc)(bpNDI)]·4.5H2O·DMF}n (1), which is a twofold inter- penetrated 3D multichromophoric porous framework. In this communication, we show that this framework exhibits unique photochromic behaviour resulting from the long-lived charge- separated chromophores, as a result of inter-net strut-to-strut electron transfer (Scheme 1).

KGaA, Weinheim 11701 Communication DOI: 10.1002/chem.201501614 electron-rich guest molecules [for example, 1,5-/2,6-dinaphthol (1,5/2,6-DAN) and 4,N,N-trimethylaniline (DMPT)] into the elec- tron-deficient channels of this framework leads to very stable charge-separated states in the ground state. Although, NDI and dinaphthols are a well-known charge-transfer pair,[7f,g] this is the first report of the incorporation of them into a MOF that results in the formation of a highly stable bpNDI radical anion by complete electron transfer. The compound 1 was synthesised by using solvothermal conditions and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis suggests that 1 crystallises in the monoclinic P21/n space group. The CdII metal centre is heptacoordinated and two such metal centres form a {Cd2(m2-OCO)2}n SBU and these SBUs are connected by bpdc linkers to form an extended 2D rhombic network along the (101¯) plane (Figure 1a). This 2D layer is further bipillared by bpNDI linkers to form a (2,8)-c connected 3D framework structure (Figure 1b). It is worth mentioning that the m2-oxo bridged dinuclear SBU ensures the two bpNDI units stack in a face-to-face fashion (cg···cg distance 3.844 æ), resulting in a bipillared layer framework. The NDI cores of the pillar bpNDI linkers maintain the perfect parallel arrangement with respect to each other (the dihedral angle between the NDI cores is 08). However, the pyridine ring of bpNDI is not in the same plane as the NDI core and the corresponding tilting angle between them is 58.328. Moreover, the presence of long linkers results in a large void space in the 3D net and, hence, induces twofold interpenetration in the framework (Figure 1c). Upon interpene- tration, the framework shows a 1D rectangular channel with di- mensions of 6.4Õ7.1 æ2 along the [101¯] direction (Figure 1d); the channel is filled with guest water and DMF molecules. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the guest molecules are removed in a stepwise manner (in the tempera- ture range 55–2408C, Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) and the desolvated state of 1 (1’) remains stable up to 3458C. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of 1’ (Figure 2a) shows no distinct change compared with that of 1, suggesting a robust nature of the framework. As seen from the single-crys- tal structure, 1 contains a high amount of void space, but it does not show any N2 uptake at 77 K (Figure S2 in the Sup- porting Information). This might be due to the low thermal energy of the adsorbate relative to the high diffusion barrier as the framework contains a 1D channel structure.[9] However, CO2 adsorption measurements at 195 K showed a typical type I profile (Figure 2b and Figure S2), unveiling the microporous nature of the framework. The saturated CO2 uptake is 92 cm3g¢1 (18 wt%, 3.2 CO2 molecules per formula unit), which corresponds to a Langmuir surface area of 286 m2g¢1. 1’ is also able to capture CO2 at 298 K at a relatively high value of 34 cm3g¢1 (6.8 wt%, 1.1 CO2 per formula unit; Figure S2). The uptake of CO2 in 1’ can be accounted for by the quadrupolar nature of the CO2 molecules (quadrupole moment of CO2: 4.3Õ1026 esu¢1 cm¢2), which interact with the pendent carbon- yl oxygen atoms of the bpNDI pillars that are aligned along the pore surface.

KGaA, Weinheim 11702 Communication The compound 1 shows broad absorption in the range of 200–400 nm, characteristic of typical p–p* and n–p* transi- tions. The presence of a very weak band in the visible region (400–600 nm) corresponds to p-stacked bpNDI chromophores, as is evident in the crystal structure as well. The origin of this band is further confirmed by the solution-state self-assembly studies of bpNDI chromophores in DMF/water solvent mix- tures. A higher percentage of water induced aggregation of these chromophores, which resulted in similar features in ab- sorption bands (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). We further studied the photophysical responses of this framework upon exposure to UV-light irradiation, where two chromo- phores of different electronic nature are parts of the integrated framework. Interestingly, shinning UV light (365 nm) for as little as 20–30 s on crystals of 1 resulted in an immediate drastic colour change (Figure 3a and Figure S4 in the Supporting In- formation) from golden yellow to dark brown, while the crystal structure remained intact as supported by the PXRD pattern (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). The colour of these crystals was reverted to yellow by keeping them in air for 7 to 8 h (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The UV/Vis spec- tra of irradiated crystals of 1 showed the appearance of new bands with maxima at 478, 617, 737 and 821 nm, the intensity of which increases on longer exposure to UV light (Figure 3c). The possible origin of these peaks is the formation of radical anions of the bpNDI linker molecules (see below). The forma- tion of the radical anion is further confirmed by the chemical reduction of the bpNDI linker with tert-butylammonium fluor- ide and by comparing the corresponding UV/Vis spectra (Fig- ure S7 in the Supporting Information).[10a] Appearance of a strong EPR signal with a g value of 2.001 for the irradiated crystals of 1 corroborates the formation of radical anions of bpNDI, where the radical is on the carbon atom (Figure 3d).[7e] On the other hand, free bpNDI ligands also showed similar photochromic behaviour (radical anion formation) upon UV ir- radiation owing to the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the pyridine nitrogen to the NDI aromatic core (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information).[7e] The PET mechanism operating in the free bpNDI linkers is supported by the fact that the diprotonated bpNDIH2 2+ showed no colour change upon irradiation. We envisage a similar diprotonated coordination environment for the bpNDI linker in framework 1 after binding with CdII and, hence, it is clear that the PET mechanism in the framework is quite different from that in the free linker molecule. Hence, we believe that the PET mech- anism operating in the framework should be an intermolecular phenomenon, possibly between different strut molecules. Thus, control experiments were performed to understand the possible origins of the PET pathways. Interestingly, a 1:1 mix- ture of biphenyldicarboxylate (bpdcNa2) with bpNDIH2 2+ showed similar photochromic behaviour upon UV irradiation (Figures S9 and S10 in the Supporting Information). These link- ers mimic the coordination environment of the framework and the formation of the radical ion was again confirmed by UV/Vis spectroscopy and EPR measurements (Figures S11 and S12 in the Supporting Information). It is important to note that UV ir- radiation of the bpNDIH2 2+ and bpdcH2 (1:1) mixture did not show any photochromic behaviour. These results clearly indi- cate that the photochromic behaviour in such systems is indeed due to an inter-strut photoinduced electron-transfer process and in the present case it is from the bpdc to the bpNDI acceptor linkers. This is only possible because of the perfect orientation of the struts in the framework, credited to the {Cd2(m2-OCO)2}n SBU and the framework interpenetration, which causes close contacts of the struts (Figure 3b and Fig- ure S13 in the Supporting Information). The donor component in this PET process can be either the carboxylate oxygen of the bpdc or the bpdc chromophoric linker itself, which are located at distances of 3.9 and 2.59 æ, respectively, from the electron- deficient bpNDI linker (Figure 3b).[10b] Although similar photo- chromic behaviour in NDI-based MOFs has been ascribed to a so called “p–p* electron transfer”,[8d,e] we show here that the reduction of bpNDI acceptors to radical anions would indeed require a PET mechanism wherein the presence of an electron- donor group/molecule is mandatory. Host–guest chemistry in luminescent porous MOFs is of great interest as various bimolecular photophysical properties, such as exciplex emission, charge-transfer or energy-transfer processes, can be modulated in a unique manner in the con- strained spaces available inside the frameworks.[2,5] We further envisaged guest-induced modulation of the charge-transfer properties of this MOF with electron-deficient channels. Three different electron-rich guest molecules, that is, 4,N,N-trimethyl- aniline (DMPT) and 1,5-/2,6-dinaphthol (1,5-/2,6-DAN), were en- capsulated successfully into 1’ (1@DMPT, 1@1,5-DAN and 1@ 2,6-DAN) and striking colour changes were immediately ob- served, from golden yellow to dark brown, green and dark green, respectively, suggesting ground-state interactions be- tween the host and guest chromophores (Figure 4a). The guest loading was confirmed through 1H NMR (Figures S14– S16 in the Supporting Information), TGA (Figure S1), PXRD (Fig- Figure 3. Reversible photoinduced strut-to-strut electron transfer: a) photo- graphs of 1 before and after UV radiation (365 nm); b) possible supramo- lecular interactions between two different struts realised by interpenetration (cyan=CdII, red=oxygen, green=C atoms of bpdc, grey=C atoms of bpNDI, blue=N and yellow=hydrogen); c) UV/Vis time-dependent absorb- ance spectra on UV irradiation; d) EPR spectra of 1 (blue=1 without irradi- ation, black=3 min of irradiation, red=7 min of irradiation).

Changes in powder diffraction patterns of 1 on encapsulation also reiterate the successful loading of guest molecules. Furthermore, CO2 ad- sorption isotherms (Figure 2b) for guest encapsulated com- posites 1@2,6-DAN and 1@1,5-DAN were measured at 195 K. As expected, both of the guest-loaded frameworks do not show any uptake of CO2 up to 1 atm, unequivocally proving that 2,6/1,5-DAN occupy the regular channel of 1. However, 1@DMPT exhibits a type I profile with total CO2 uptake of 72 cm3g¢1 (2.49 CO2 molecules per formula unit), which is smaller than that of framework 1’. It is probable that as DMPT is smaller in size than 2,6/1,5-DAN, there is sufficient void space for further CO2 inclusion. The dark colours of the three composites are indicative of ground-state charge-transfer inter- actions and this is distinctly reflected in the appearance of broad bands in entire visible region of the UV/Vis spectra (Fig- ure 4b). Specifically for 1@DMPT, the bands are well resolved and the newly appeared bands at 513, 630, 728 and 792 nm can be attributed to the radical anion of bpNDI, suggesting a guest-to-host electron-transfer process. Furthermore, EPR measurements were carried out and strong EPR signals were obtained for each case, clearly confirming the fact of guest-to- host electron transfer (Figure 4a). Hence, it can be stated that the occlusion of suitable guest molecules in the functionalised channels gives rise to an extended co-facial arrangement be- tween the guests and the pillars of the host, hence reflecting the importance of confinement effects in porous frameworks. It is worth mentioning that even after three to four months, the colour of the guest-encapsulated compounds do not change and the EPR signals remain the same, suggesting long- lived charge-separated states of bpNDI and guest molecules. As the bpNDI linker is redox- active, electrochemical studies of frameworks 1 and 1@2,6-DAN were performed to test their chemical change after guest in- clusion on electrodes passing electrical energy.[7a,11] The cyclic voltammogram of pristine bpNDI exhibits two sets of fully reversible redox peaks that cor- respond to [bpNDI]0/C¢ at E1/2= ¢0.52 V and [bpNDI]C¢/2¢ at E1/2= ¢0.94 V (Figure S18 in the Sup- porting Information). The redox peaks obtained in the case of pure bpNDI are retained even after formation of the MOF ([bpNDI]0/C¢ at E1/2=¢0.49 V and [bpNDI]C¢/2¢ at E1/2=¢0.94 V), confirming that 1 is a redox- active porous framework (Table S4 in the Supporting Infor- mation and Figure 4c, inset). However, the feature is quasi-re- versible in nature, unlike that of pristine bpNDI;[11] this might be due to the integrated bpNDI, electronic environment of which is not same as that of the free ligand. On the other hand, drastic changes in the voltammogram of guest-encapsu- lated 1@2,6-DAN were observed compared with pristine bpNDI and 1 (Figure 4c). The very small current density of peak I ([bpNDI]0/C¢ at E1/2=¢0.49 V) compared to peak II ([bpNDI]C¢/2¢ at E1/2=¢0.91 V) suggests that bpNDI is in a mono radical anion state formed by electron transfer from 2,6-DAN. The small current density of peak I suggests that minute amounts of bpNDIs are present in the system, but are not involved in the electron-transfer process. These results fur- ther suggest the role of the included guest (2,6-DAN) in the electron-transfer process in guest-loaded framework. The high peak current for peak II can be attributed to the combination of both electrochemical reduction and chemically generated mono anion radicals ([bpNDI]0/C¢ and unreduced bpNDI linker. In the next step, the potential scan is inverted and the pres- ence of two anodic peaks corresponds to the oxidation of bpNDI2¢ to bpNDIC¢ followed by further oxidation of bpNDIC¢ to bpNDI. In conclusion, we have reported the synthesis and character- isation of a multichromophoric 3D interpenetrated redox- active porous framework with unique photoinduced inter-net strut-to-strut electron-transfer characteristics. Furthermore, electron-deficient and dynamic-coordination spaces enabled facile encapsulation of different electron-rich aromatic mol- ecules, which results in strut-to-strut long-lived charge-separat- ed states in the ground state. The unique ability of such multi- chromophoric system to encapsulate various guest molecules with an electron-transfer response holds great promise for de- signing novel functional redox-active materials. Therefore, such host materials can alter their physical and chemical properties in the presence of guest molecules in their cavities, thereby, Figure 4. a) Encapsulation of electron-rich aromatic guest molecules (1,5-/2,6-DAN and DMPT) in 1’ with corres- ponding colour change and EPR spectra (cyan=CdII, red=oxygen, grey=C atoms, blue=N); b) UV/Vis spectra of 1 and guest-encapsulated compounds (black=1, blue=1@2,6-DAN, purple=1@1,5-DAN, red=1@DMPT (100%)); c) cyclic voltammogram of 1@2,6-DAN (inset: 1) in 0.1m TBAP in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mVs¢1.

Physical measurements Elemental analysis was carried out using a Thermo Fischer Flash 2000 Elemental Analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer UTAR with a Frontier IR system. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Mettler Toledo TGA850 under a nitrogen at- mosphere (flow rate=50 mLmin¢1) in the temperature range 30– 7008C (heating rate 38Cmin¢1). Powder XRD patterns of the com- pounds were recorded by using CuKa radiation (Bruker D8 Dis- cover; 40 kV, 30 mA). Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV-Vis-NIR Spectrometer and emis- sion spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Ls 55 Luminescence Spectrometer. NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker AVANCE 400 (400 MHz) Fourier transform NMR spectrometer with chemical shifts reported in parts per million (ppm). For EPR spectra measure- ments, a Bruker EMX spectrometer was used in the X-band operat- ing at 9.43 GHz. Electrochemical studies All the electrochemical measurements were carried out using a CHI 660A electrochemical analyzer (CH instruments, USA). Electrochem- ical measurements were carried out with a conventional three-elec- trode system, wherein the compound-coated glassy carbon elec- trode acts as a working electrode and a large Pt foil and an Ag wire act as auxiliary and reference electrodes, respectively. A known amount (7 mg) of bpNDI/1/1@2,6-DAN was dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol and 20 mL of Nafion solution for 30 min. A 20 mL aliquot of the above dispersion was drop-cast onto the precleaned glassy carbon electrode and dried under ambient conditions for fabrication of the working electrode. Electrochemical measure- ments were performed in distilled acetonitrile under deaerated conditions. 0.1m TBAP ([(nBu)4N]PF6) acted as the supporting elec- trolyte. Acknowledgements We thank Prof. S.

Metal salt was obtained from Spectrochem. 4,4-biphenyldicarboxylic acid, 1,5- dinaphthol, 2,6-dinaphthol and 4,N,N-trimethylaniline were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Co. N,N′-di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide was synthesised following the literature procedure [1]. [1] P. H. Dinolfo, M. E. Williams, C. L. Stern, J. T. Hupp, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 12989-13001. X-Ray crystallography X-ray single crystal structural data of 1 was collected on a Bruker Smart-CCD diffractometer equipped with a normal focus, 2.4 kW sealed tube X-ray source with graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) operating at 50 kV and 30 mA. The program SAINT[2] was used for integration of diffraction profiles and absorption correction was made with SADABS[3] program. The crystal structure was solved by SIR 92[4] and refined by full matrix least square method using SHELXL-97.[5] All the hydrogen atoms were fixed by HFIX and placed in ideal positions. All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Crystal data and structure refinement parameters of 1 are given in Table S1. Selected bond lengths and angles of 1 are given in Table S2-S3. All calculations were carried out using SHELXL 97, PLATON,[6] SHELXS 97[7] and WinGX system, Ver 1.70.01.[8] CCDC- 1051763 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

Adsorption Study The adsorption isotherms of CO2 (at 195 and 298 K), H2 (at 298 K), N2 (at 77 and 298 K), Ar (at 298 K) and O2 (at 298 K) using the dehydrated sample of 1 (1) was measured by using QUANTACHROME QUADRASORB-SI analyser. CO2 adsorption isotherms for 1@1,5/2,6- DAN and 1@DMPT were also measured at 195 K. The compound 1 has been activated at 160 C for 24 hour, whereas 1@1,5/2,6-DAN and 1@DMPT are heated at 140 C respectively for 8 hour under 1×10-1 Pa vacuum prior to measurement of the isotherms. All the gases used for adsorption measurement are of scientific/research grade with 99.999% purity. Dead volume was measured with helium gas. The adsorbates were placed into the sample tubes, and then the change of the pressure was monitored and the degree of adsorption was determined by the decrease in pressure at the equilibrium state. All operations were computer-controlled and automatic. Table S1: Crystal data and structure refinement parameters of 1.
