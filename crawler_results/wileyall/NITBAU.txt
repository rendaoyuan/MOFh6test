Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/chem.200700600 Linking Two Distinct Layered Networks of Nanosized {Ln18} and {Cu24} Wheels through Isonicotinate Ligands Jian-Wen Cheng,[a] Jie Zhang,[a] Shou-Tian Zheng,[a] and Guo-Yu Yang*[a, b] Introduction In the past decade, nanoscale wheel clusters have attracted extensive interest due to their fascinating structures and po- tential applications in nanoscience,[1] host–guest chemistry,[2] supramolecular chemistry,[3] and magnetochemistry[4,5] As a result, many large homometallic cyclic clusters of transition metals (TMs)[3–10] and lanthanides (Ln)[11] have been success- fully synthesized. Recently, the synthesis of hetero-TM wheels has undergone great progress, such as isolated [Fe6Mn6],[12] [CrmMn] (m=6–10, n=1–2),[13a–g] and dimeric [Cr7Ni]2L (L=diamines), and [Cr7Ni]2[M2] (M=Cu, Ni, Co, Ru).[13h,i] However, the analogous chemistry of hetero-Ln- TM wheels is still underdeveloped. Generally, the choice of ligands is critical to construct and link metal clusters or wheels.[14] Previously we reported the first Ln-TM frameworks, [Ln14ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m6-O)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-OH)20(IN)22Cu6X4- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)8]·6H2O (Ln=Y, Gd, Dy, Er, Tb, X=Cl; Ln=Er, Gd, Y, X=Br)[14a] and [Er7ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-OH)6ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdc)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ina)9ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Cu3X4] (FJ-2, FJ =Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter), X=Cl, Br; IN=ina: isonicotinate, bdc=1,2-benze- nedicarboxylate).[14b] The former is based on the linkages of nanosized hydroxo {Ln14} clusters and [Cu2X2]/Cu centers by IN ligands; the latter is based on the links by ina ligands of layered networks, built from {Er36} wheels and [Cu3X4] clus- ter cores. Notably, the Ln clusters in the frameworks above change from {Ln14} cores to networks made of {Er36} wheels owing to the synergistic coordination between both ligands of ina and bdc, whereas the TM clusters form dimeric [Cu2X2] to trimeric [Cu3X4] cores containing one m3-X atom. Based on this chemistry we were intrigued as to whether the size of halogen atoms as inorganic ligands influence the ag- gregation of metal-halide clusters and whether the larger TM clusters, wheels, or networks of wheels could be intro- duced in Ln cluster or Ln wheel-cluster polymers under ra- tional conditions. As a continuation of our search for new open-frameworks built from Ln and TM clusters, we have introduced a larger halogen, iodine, based on the following considerations: the I ion has a larger ionic radius than Cl and Br, and may Abstract: A new series of heterolanthanideACHTUNGTRENUNG(III)-copper(I) wheel- cluster complexes [Ln6ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)2](IN)18- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Cu8ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m4-I)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m2-I)3]·H3O (IN=isonicoti- nate; Ln=Y 1, Nd 2, Dy 3, Gd 4, Sm 5, Eu 6, Tb 7) were prepared by hydro- thermal reaction at low pH. X-ray crys- tallographic studies reveal that two un- usual trinuclear [Ln3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)] and tetra- nuclear [Cu4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m4-I)] cores are successful- ly used as secondary building units to make two different nanosized wheels [Ln18ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)6ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CO2)48]6, {Ln18}, and [Cu24ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m4-I)6ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m2-I)12]6+, {Cu24}, with 12- rings and a diameter of 26.7 and 26.4 D, respectively. The wheels are further assembled into two-dimensional (2D) {Ln18} and {Cu24} networks, the linkages between two distinct layered networks of {Ln18} and {Cu24} wheels by IN pillars along the c axis giving a series of unprecedented three-dimen- sional (3D) sandwich frameworks. To our knowledge, compounds 1–7 are the first examples containing two different layered networks of nanosized Ln and transition metal (TM) wheels in wheel- cluster chemistry. The IR, UV/Vis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), lu- minescent, and magnetic properties of these complexes were also studied.

Herein, we report seven novel wheel-cluster polymers: [Ln6ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)2](IN)18ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Cu8ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m4-I)2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m2-I)3]·H3O (FJ-4, Ln=Y 1, Nd 2, Dy 3, Gd 4, Sm 5, Eu 6, Tb 7, respectively). The structures are the first sandwich frameworks based on linkages of two distinct layered net- works of nanosized wheels with 12-rings, [Ln18ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)6- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CO2)48]6, {Ln18}, and [Cu24ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m4-I)6ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m2-I)12]6+, {Cu24}, formed by using IN ligands. To our knowledge, no systematic inves- tigation has been conducted on wheel-cluster polymers in which the distinct networks of metal wheels, especially where two networks of Ln and TM wheels are linked to to- gether by organic ligands, except for two Ln and two TM wheel-cluster polymers containing layered networks of {Er36},[14b] {Mo154},[15a] and {Mo152}[15b] wheels. Results and Discussion Red prismatic crystals of 1–7 were obtained in the hydro- thermal reaction of Ln2O3, CuI, HIN, and 2-pyrazinecarbox- ylic acid (pca) in water in the presence of HClO4 (pH 2). In addition, light yellow rectangular crystals were also obtained at the same time.[16] X-ray structure analyses reveal that 1–7 are isomorphous and crystallize in the high-symmetry rhom- bohedral space group R3¯c (Table 1). Therefore, only the structure of 3 is described in detail. The asymmetric unit of 3 contains one unique Dy3+, two Cu+, two I ions, and three IN ligands with only one coordination mode (Fig- ure 1a, Scheme 1). The Dy3+ ion is seven-coordinate and has a capped trigonal prism coordination geometry: one m3- O, and six carboxylate oxygen atoms (OCOO) from six bridg- ing IN ligands (Figure 1b). The DyO bond lengths range from 2.261(5) to 2.372(5) D. The general trend of decreasing LnO distances with increasing atomic number has been ob- served throughout the series of compounds in line with the lanthanide contraction effect (Table 2). Three Dy3+ ions are linked by one m3-O group to give a trinuclear core of [Dy3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)] that was further stabilized by six carboxyl groups of six IN ligands, forming a [Dy3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CO2)6], {Dy3}, cluster (Figure 2a,b). This type of corner- sharing trimeric oxo-centered carboxylate-bridged cluster formulated as [M3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2CR)6]+ is well known for Al3+ Table 1.

So far, only several trimeric Ln complexes with a different configuration were reported, in which each Ln ion shares a triangular face with the other two.[18] Six {Dy3} clusters are further linked by twelve carboxyl groups of twelve IN ligands to form a nanosized {Dy18} wheel with a 12-ring and the diameter of 26.7 D (Figure 2c–e), which is another novel nanosized Ln wheel that remarkably differs from the {Er36}[14b] wheel in linkage modes. Compared with TM wheels containing trinu- clear building blocks, the {Ni24}[5a]/ACHTUNGTRENUNG{Fe18}[7b] wheels can be described as an oligomer of eight/six trinuclear building blocks, whereas each {Dy18} wheel is linked to the adjacent wheels by sharing {Dy3} bridg- ing building blocks, resulting in a highly ordered layered {Dy18} wheel-cluster network with hexagonal, honeycomb arrays (Figure 2 f). Notably, the previously reported Ln wheels are formed not only by bridging organic ligands, but also by sharing Ln ions. In {Ln8}/ACHTUNGTRENUNG{Ln10}/ACHTUNGTRENUNG{Ln12} wheels, for example, the Ln ions are linked by ligands with the O atom donor to form 8-/10-/12-rings in which the center is empty;[11a,f,g,h] whereas in {Ln12}/ACHTUNGTRENUNG{Ln15} wheels, four or five {Ln4} cores share Ln vertices to form 4-/5-rings with one or two halide ions in their central cavity.[11c,d] Remarkably, the construction mode of the wheel-shaped {Dy18} reported here is signifi- cantly different from the above-mentioned discrete Ln wheels. The {Dy18} wheel with a 12-ring is made up of six Figure 1. a) The asymmetrical unit of compound 3; b) the coordination environments of Dy atom in 3; c) the coordination environments of the Cu1 atom: one I and three N atoms from three IN ligands with mode I.

Yang et al. {Dy3} cores linked by the bridging IN ligands, each {Dy18} is linked to surrounding wheels by sharing [Dy3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)], form- ing a highly ordered layered wheel-cluster network. Addi- tionally, the layered {Dy18} wheel is also remarkably differ- ent from the layered {Er36} wheel in FJ-2.[14b] The {Er36} wheel in FJ-2 is made up of strictly alternating {Er4} and {Er2} cores sharing m3-OH groups, whereas the bdc ligands are trapped in the 18-ring to further stabilize the {Er36} wheel. Each {Er36} wheel is linked to surrounding wheels by sharing -Er1-OH-{Er2}2-OH-Er1- bridges, forming a highly ordered layered wheel-cluster network.[14b] Two Cu centers in 3 are four-coordinate in distorted tetra- hedral geometries with different coordination environments, comprising one m4-I1 and three N atoms from three bridging IN moieties for Cu1N3I, and one m4-I1, one m2-I2, and two N atoms from two bridging IN ligands for Cu2N2I2 tetrahedra (Figure 1c,d, Figure 3a); the CuI and CuN bond lengths range from 2.630(1)–2.801(1) D and 2.016(5)–2.122(6) D, for the two tetrahedra, respectively. Four Cu ions are bridged by corner-sharing one m4-I1 atom to form an unprecedented tetrameric I-centered tetra- hedral [Cu4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m4-I)], {Cu4}, cluster core (Figure 3a,b) that dif- fers from the reported tetragonal pyramid of {Cu4}, in which the m4-I atom is the vertex.[19] Six {Cu4} cores are linked by six m2-I2 atoms to form another nanosized {Cu24} wheel with a 12-ring and a diameter of 26.4 D (Figure 3c–e). Compared with the {Cu4} core here, the {Cu3} cores in FJ-2 are not linked to each other.[14b] In addition, the cyclic {Cu24} cluster is the largest halide-bridged Cu wheel to date.[6a] Notably, six Cu1-centered tetrahedra are grouped into threes to form triangles with reverse orientation that are linked on two sides of the 12-ring in the ab plane. Adjacent {Cu24} wheels are further linked to each other by m2-I2 atoms, forming an- other layered network of {Cu24} wheels, with hexagonal hon- eycomb arrays (Figure 3f, Figure 4). Generally, it is not pos- sible to form a large 3d metal wheel with only one type of bridging interaction.[5a,7c] For example, the famous “ferric wheel” can be accurately described as [{FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(OMe)2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2CR)}10] (R=Me, CH2Cl, CH2CH2C(O)C6H4Me),[7a,c] a series of CuII wheels can be summarized as [{Cu(OH)(pz)}n] (pz=pyrazololato anion, C3H3N2 ; n=6, 8, 9, 12, 14),[6b] and a family of heterometallic octanuclear wheels can be formu- lated as [M7M’F8ACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2CR)16] (M=a trivalent metal of Cr, Fe, V, Al, Ga, or In; M’=a divalent metal of Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Mg, Zn, Cd; O2CR=one of around twenty carboxylates),[13j] an so on, these discrete TM wheels are linked by two differ- ent bridges. Therefore, the construction mode of the layered wheel-shaped {Cu24} in FJ-4 is significantly different from the above-mentioned discrete TM wheels. In FJ-4, the {Cu24} wheel only bridged by I atoms is unprecedented. In contrast to other TM wheels based on edge-sharing metal tetrahedra,[7d,e] the {Cu24} wheel comprises two different tet- rahedra of Cu1N3I and Cu2N2I2 through shared vertices. Such a {Cu24} wheel with a 12-ring and corner-sharing tetra- hedra is analogous to zeolite/zeolite-like open-frame- works,[20] in which the O atoms are usually bi- or tricoordi- nate. Unlike the I-centered tetrahedra in {Cu24} wheel net- Figure 2. a) The trimeric {Dy3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CO2)6} cluster unit.

In addition, the {Mo154}[15a] and {Mo152}[15b] wheels are formed based on the linkages between polyhedra through sharing vertices and edges, but all the polyhedra are octahedra and pentagonal bipyramids, with no tetrahedra in such huge wheels. Also no m4-O atoms and [OMo4] tetrahedra, unlike m4-I atoms and [ICu4] tetrahedra in FJ-4, exist in the {Mo154}/ACHTUNGTRENUNG{Mo152}[15] wheels because of steric effects, that is, the small/large size for O/Mo atoms, respectively. Like the {Er36} wheel-cluster networks formed in FJ-2 due to the synergistic coordination between two different organic ligands,[14b] the {Cu24} wheel- cluster networks in FJ-4 can also be described as the generation under the synergistic coordination between Figure 3. a) The tetrameric [Cu4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m4-I)] cluster core linked by corner-sharing a centered m4-I atom. b) Side view of the coordination environment of [Cu4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m4-I)] core in 3.

The linkages between two distinct layered networks of {Ln18} and {Cu24} wheels by IN pillars along the c axis, leads to an unprecedented 3D sandwich framework (Figure 5a,b) with multidimensional channels along the [481¯], [44¯1¯], [841], and [88¯1] directions (Fig- ure 5c). The channels are filled with protonated water mole- cules for the charge balance. In addition, the layered net- works of {Dy18} and {Cu24} wheels are stacked along the [22¯1] direction to form two types of hexagonal channels that interpenetrate (Figure 6). With one of the largest unit- cell dimensions (c=93.975 D) among all non-protein struc- tures, both layered networks of {Dy18} and {Cu24} wheels are stacked in parallel with -ABCDEF- alternations along the c axis, each layer is shifted by (a/3+b/3+c/6) with re- spect to the next one (Fig- ure 5a,b). Remarkably, the structure of 3 consists of strict- ly alternating {Dy18} and {Cu24} wheel-cluster networks pillared by IN ligands to form a 3D framework, in which adjacent layered networks of {Cu24}/ACHTUNGTRENUNG{Dy18} wheels have op- posite orientations along the c axis. The distance between two adjacent layers of {Dy18}/ACHTUNGTRENUNG{Cu24} wheels, and between adjacent layers of {Dy18} and {Cu24} wheels is 15.65 and 7.82 D, re- spectively (Figure 5b). As many as 60 IN ligands are bonded to the {Dy18} wheel: six {Cu24} wheels cap two sides of the {Dy18} wheel through 18 IN (mode I), and other 42 IN ligands (modes II and III) are bonded to Cu1 and Cu2 atoms. Whereas six {Dy18} wheels cap two sides of the {Cu24} wheel through 54 IN ligands: 36 ina ligands (modes I and II) are only coordinated to interior [Dy3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)] cores, which are further bridged and linked through another 18 IN ligands (mode III).

On ac- count of the isomorphic features of 1–7, 1 as a typical exam- ple is described in detail. The TG curve of 1 shows a weight loss of 0.65% (calcd 0.48%) from 30 to 3008C, which corre- sponds to the release of a protonated water molecule. Be- tween 300 and 6008C, the weight loss corresponds to the de- composition of IN ligands and assuming that the residue corresponds to 3Y2O3·8CuO, the observed weight (33.92%) is in good agreement with the calculated value (33.47%). The TG curves of 2–7 are similar to that of 1, the weight loss of protonated water is 0.86, 1.23, 0.73, 1.1, 0.84, and 1.2%, for 2–7 (calcd 0.45, 0.43, 0.44, 0.44, 0.44, and 0.44%), respectively. Assuming that the residue corresponds to 3Ln2O3·8CuO (Ln=Nd, Dy, Gd, Sm, Eu) and 3/ 2Tb4O7·8CuO for 2–7, the residual weights of 39.61, 40.50, 38.61, 39.65, 38.66, and 39.69% in 2–7 are in good agree- ment with the calculated values 38.66, 40.20, 39.76, 39.18, 39.32, and 40.46%, respectively (see Figure S1 in the Sup- porting Information). IR spectroscopy: The IR spectra of 1–7 are similar. The characteristic features of the IN ligand dominate the IR spectrum. The strong and broad absorption bands in the range of 3000–3700 cm1 in 1–7 are assigned as characteristic peaks of OH vibrations. The strong vibrations appearing at 1582 and 1402 cm1 correspond to the asymmetric and sym- metric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate group, re- spectively. The absence of strong bands in the range 1690– 1730 cm1 indicate IN ligands are deproponated (see Fig- ure S2 in the Supporting Information). Optical properties: The optical absorption spectrum reveals that 1–7 exhibit strong and similar optical absorption in the visible region, with optical band gaps of 2.19, 2.17, 2.17, 2.12, 2.07, 2.21, and 2.23 eV, respectively, these band gap sizes are significantly smaller than CuI (2.92 eV) (see Fig- ure S3 in the Supporting Information). Thus, a much larger fraction of visible light is absorbed by these lanthanide-con- taining heterometallic complexes. Luminescence properties: The profiles of the emission bands for 2 are in agreement with previously reported spec- tra of Nd3+ complexes.[22] Under excitation of 476 nm, 2 dis- plays the characteristic emission bands for the Nd3+ ion in the near-IR region: the strongest emission band is at 1058 nm (4F3/2!4I11/2) and a weak band is found at 1330 nm (4F3/2!4I13/2). Compounds 3, 5, 7 show similar broad fluores- cent emission spectra from 450 to 800 nm in the solid state, with an intense emission occurring around 650 nm when ex- cited at 420, 438, and 320 nm, respectively, at room tempera- ture (Figure 7). According to the results of the similar cop- per(I) halide clusters, the emission band might be assigned to a combination of iodide-to-copper charge transfer (LMCT) and d–s transitions by Cu–Cu interaction within Cu24 clusters.[23] The fluorescence spectrum of complex 6 was also measured in the solid state at room temperature, the excitation wavenumber was selected as the maximum of the solid-state excitation spectrum at 280 and 357 nm, but no useful emission spectra were observed. Magnetic properties: The magnetic susceptibilities of pow- dered samples of 1–4 were measured in the temperature range 2–300 K. The molar magnetic susceptibility of 1 is negative and independent of temperature within 50–300 K, consistent with the assigned structure containing diamagnet- ic Cu+ and Y3+ ions. At room temperature, the cMT value is equal to 9.87, 84.9, and 46.62 cm3mol1 K for 2–4 (Figure 8), respectively, which are close to the expected values of 9.84, 85.02, and 47.28 cm3mol1 K for six noninteracting Ln3+ ions. On lowering the temperature, the cMT value of 2 de- creases monotonically and finally reaches 3.64 cm3mol1 K at 2 K. Such a magnetic behavior is typical for Nd3+ com- plexes due to the populations of the Stark levels and a weak antiferromagnetic interaction between Nd3+ ions.[24] For 3, cMT decreases slowly with decreasing the temperature to about 50 K and then more rapidly below 50 K, reaching a Figure 7. Emission spectra of: a) Compound 2; b) Compounds 3, 5, and 7 in the solid state at room temperature when excited at 476, 420, 438, and 320 nm, respectively. www.chemeurj.org L 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2008, 14, 88 – 97 94 G.-Y. Yang et al. value of 33.35 cm3mol1 K at 2 K. This behavior might be considered as a result of the ligand field splitting of the Dy3+ ions together with a contribution from the weak anti- ferromagnetic coupling within the {Dy18} cluster unit. The thermal variation of cMT of 4 is similar to that of 3, and almost obeys the Curie–Weiss law over the whole tempera- ture range with a negative Weiss constant (q) of 0.61 K and the Curie constant of 46.3 cm3mol1 K. Considering the shorter Gd···Gd separations within the m3-O bridged trinu- clear core of {Gd18} cluster, and a stronger ability of m3-O bridge to mediate magnetic coupling than that of syn–anti carboxylate bridge linking trinuclear cores, the magnetic sus- ceptibility data of 4 were analyzed approximately based on the expression for the coupling system of trinuclear Gd3+ in a triangular skeleton,[25] derived from the isotropic Hamilto- nian h=2J(Sˆ 1·Sˆ 2+Sˆ 1·Sˆ 3+Sˆ 2·Sˆ 3). The intertrinuclear inter- action was taken into account by using the mean field ap- proximation (zj’).[26] The best fit for 4 leads to J= 0.031 cm1, g=1.98 and zj’=0.011 cm1 (R=1.83T105). The small and negative J value suggests a very weak antifer- romagnetic interaction between Gd3+ ions. The alternating current (ac) susceptibility measurements of 4 performed under a zero direct current (dc) magnetic field and a 3.0 Oe ac field oscillating in the frequency range of 111–3511 Hz reveal that the in-phase signal (c0 M) hardly shows frequency dependence whereas the out-of-phase signal (c00 M) can be clearly increased with an increase of the frequency, although no maximum was observed down to 2.0 K (Figure 9a). As the dc field increases at 2 K, the c0 M signals almost exhibit a continuous decrease up to 20 kOe, but a maximum of c00 M can be observed at around 3 kOe (Figure 10). With the dc field constants held at 3 kOe, a shoulder around 4 K for c0 M and a peak at about 3 K for c00 M are observed in c0 M(T) and c00 M(T) curves, and are obviously frequency-dependent (Figure 9b). There are antiferromag- netically coupled triangular sublattices within the layered Gd3+ wheel-cluster network. Such a frustrated spin geome- try has ever been inferred to play a crucial role in the field- induced frequency-dependent magnetic behaviors of some lanthanide complexes.[27] However, with the development in magnetochemistry of lanthanide complexes, this field-in- duced relaxation process tends to be explained by the mag- netic behavior of an isolated ion, the lifting of the Kramer degeneracy by the applied magnetic field is responsible for this magnetic phenomenon.[28] The exchange coupling con- stant between the adjacent Gd3+ ions in 4 is 0.031 cm1, which is so small that the exchange coupling interaction can be ignored, thus the latter mechanism is more reasonable for explaining this frequency-dependent magnetic behavior in the present system. Conclusion We have successfully made a series of novel 3D sandwich frameworks under hydrothermal conditions that contain two distinct layered networks of mixed {Ln18} and {Cu24} wheels. The synthetic procedure has been well established. The unique m4-I tetrahedral coordination in the structure plays a key role in forming and stabilizing the {Cu24} wheel and its network; whereas trinuclear [Ln3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)] cores are responsi- ble for the formation of the {Ln18} wheel and its network. Furthermore, the synergistic coordination between IN and m3-O ligands, as well as IN and m4-I ligands results in the for- mation of two distinct networks of {Dy18} and {Cu24} wheel- clusters. The linkages between layered {Ln18} and {Cu24} wheel-cluster networks through IN ligands result in a series of novel Ln-TM sandwich frameworks with multidimension- Figure 8.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 95 FULL PAPER Networks of Nanosized {Ln18} and {Cu24} Wheels al channels. This is the first observation that two different layered networks of nanosized Ln and TM wheels are pil- lared by IN ligands in wheel-cluster chemistry. It is noticea- ble that the unusual trinuclear [Ln3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m3-O)] and tetranuclear [Cu4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m4-I)] cores are successfully used as building blocks to make large oligomers of {Ln18} and {Cu24} wheels that fur- ther link to 2D {Ln18} and {Cu24} networks, respectively, sug- gesting that the “oligomerization of low-nuclearity building blocks”[5a] may make larger wheels or wheel-cluster poly- mers. Further work is in progress to make other new Ln-TM wheels and wheel-cluster polymers by using either larger oligomers of tri- or tetranuclear fragments, or oligomers of higher nuclearity building blocks, whereas simultaneously we are trying to make still larger wheels and wheel-cluster polymers, especially mixed Ln and TM wheels, by selecting another type of ligand or introducing second ligands. Experimental Section Materials and physical measurements: All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and were used without further purification. Ele- mental analyses for C, H, N were performed on a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. The FTIR spectra (KBr pellets) were recorded by using an ABB Bomen MB 102 spectrometer, and the UV/Vis spectra by using a Lambda900 spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analyses were per- formed on a Mettler TGA/SDTA 851e analyzer with a heating rate of 108Cmin1 under air atmosphere. Photoluminescence analyses were per- formed by using an Edinburgh Instrument F920 fluorescence spectrome- ter. The magnetic susceptibilities were measured by using a Quantum Design MPMS-5S superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in the temperature range of 2–300 K, and the experimental susceptibilities were corrected for the Pascal constants. Syntheses of 1–7: A mixture of Ln2O3 (Y2O3 0.113 g, Nd2O3 0.168 g, Dy2O3 0.189 g; Gd2O3 0.181 g; Sm2O3 0.174 g; Eu2O3 0.176 g; Tb4O7 0.187 g), HIN (0.246 g), pca (0.154 g), CuI (0.055 g), H2O (10 mL), and HClO4 (0.385 mmol, pH 2) was sealed in a 30-mL teflon-lined bomb at 1708C for seven days which was then slowly cooled to room temperature. Red prismatic crystals of 1–7 and light-yellow rectangular crystals[16] were recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water and dried in air, re- spectively. Two phases could be manually separated. Interestingly, the syntheses of 1–7 rely on subtle control over various hydrothermal param- eters, especially the starting materials (not only pca, but also the I ion). It is noteworthy that pca played a critical role in the formation of 1–7, though pca was not present in 1–7. When pca was removed from the re- action system, attempts to make 1–7 were unsuccessful under same con- ditions, except for phase-pure orange crystals which were isomorphous with those in our previous work based on {Ln14} cores with iodine bridge- s.[14a] In addition, a similar reaction that used Cl and Br ions as halide sources could not produce the isomorphous products of 1–7, indicating that the I ion is indeed critical for the formation of the {Cu24} wheel and its network. The larger size of I ion induces a coordination number easily up to 4, resulting in a tendency to form tetrahedral coordination. Though the mechanism for forming the {Cu24} wheels of 1–7 was unclear, the steric effects involving the size of halide atoms are likely to be re- sponsible for the formation of {Cu24} wheel and its network.

[16] Light yellow rectangular crystals: [Dy2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(pca)(IN)6Cu5I4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2]·H2O (Dy-Cu), orthorhombic, Pca21, a=21.296(2), b=7.2116(7), c= 35.191(4) D, V=5404.5(9) D3, Z=4. X-ray crystal structure analyses show that the existence of Dy–pca layers and Cu–I chains which are further pillared by IN ligands. Other Ln–Cu analogous to Dy–Cu were also obtained (CCDC-621167–CCDC-621172 for Y, Gd, Tb, Dy, Er, Yb, respectively). Full details of the structures, discussion of the reaction with different starting materials, and the fluorescent and magnetic properties of these compounds will be published later. [17] T.

The IR spectra of 1-7, respectively. Figure S3. Optical absorption spectrum of CuI and 1-7 transformed from diffuse reflectance data. The band gap energy value was determined by extrapolation from the linear portion of the absorption edge in a (a/S) versus energy plot.[1] The energy band gaps of the 1-7 are 2.19, 2.17, 2.17, 2.12, 2.07, 2.21, and 2.23eV, respectively. The narrow spectral lines in complex 2 attribute to the f-f transitions of Nd3+. [1] O. Schevciw, W. B.White, Mater. Res. Bull. 1983, 18, 1059.
