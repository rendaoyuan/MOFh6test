O’Donovan,[a] Peter E. Kraft,[b] Jessica E. Mizzi,[a] and Robert L. LaDuca*[a] Keywords: Hydrothermal synthesis; Cadmium; Isophthalate; Coordination polymer; Crystal structure; Luminescence Abstract. Hydrothermal reactions of cadmium nitrate and 4-pyridyl- nicotinamide (4-pna) with a 5-substituted isophthalic acid derivative afforded four coordination polymers, whose structural chemistry de- pends on the nature of the substituent. The crystalline phases produced using bromo and carboxylic acid substituents, [Cd(Brip)(4-pna)]n (1) (Brip = 5-bromoisophthalate) and [Cd(Hbtc)(4-pna)]n (2) (btc = 1,3,5- benzenetricarboxylate), have similar structural chemistry. They both exhibit anti-syn {Cd2(OCO)2} dimeric units that serve as 6-connected nodes for 3D twofold interpenetrated 41263 pcu networks, which are constructed by the linkage of [Cd2(carboxylate)2]n ribbons by tethering Introduction Research effort into the design, structure, and physical prop- erties of coordination polymer solids remains intense because of their potential utility as gas storage substrates,[1] selective absorbents,[2] ion-exchange media,[3] heterogeneous cata- lysts,[4] and explosives trace sensors.[5] The undeniable aesthe- tic appeal of their underlying molecular frameworks and top- ologies provides an additional driving force for stimulating continued investigation in this field over the past decade.[6] Divalent cadmium ions have been effectively employed as the cationic components for the construction of coordination poly- mers. The flexible coordination environment provided by the lack of crystal field stabilization moves ligand donor disposi- tion and steric effects to the fore during self-assembly. Ad- ditionally the closed shell d10 electronic configuration provides a spectral window for visible-light emission important in fluo- rescence applications[7] or second harmonic generation.[8] Aro- matic dicarboxylates such as phthalate (pht),[9] terephthalate (tp),[10] or isophthalate (ip)[11] have proven to be the most pop- ular ligand choices for the design and construction of divalent cadmium polymers, as they impart the structural robustness and requisite charge balance for the formation of a stable * Dr. R.

An in situ amide hydrolysis of the 4-pna precursor was observed when a bulkier substituent (tert-butyl or methoxy) was uti- lized. The resulting nicotinate (nic) anions were incorporated into {[Cd2(tbip)(nic)2(H2O)4]·H2O}n (3) (tbip = 5-tert-butylisophthalate) and [Cd2(meoip)(nic)2(H2O)2]n (4) (meoip = 5-methoxyisophthalate) which both display an overall (6,3) hexagonal grid layered topology. However, 3 shows isolated cadmium atoms while 4 manifests {Cd2(OCO)2} anti-syn bridged dimeric clusters. Luminescent and ther- mal properties of these materials are also reported. framework. A tremendous diversity of coordination polymer topologies has been achieved by taking advantage of differ- ences in metal coordination geometry preference, carboxylate donor disposition, carboxylate binding mode, and also the in- clusion of other neutral co-ligands.[12] One tactic used to enhance the topological diversity of isophthalate-containing coordination polymer solids has been to include substituents at the aromatic 5-position.[13–17] A trend of decreasing dimensionality with increasing 5-position steric bulk has been reported by Yang in a zinc isophthalate series with monodentate pyridine (py) ligands.[13] From the unsubsti- tuted derivative [Zn4(H2O)(ip)4(py)6]n, to {[Zn2(OHip)2(py)4]2· (py)}n (OHip = 5-hydroxyisophthalate), and on to [Zn(tbip)(py)2]n (tbip = 5-tert-butylisophthalate), a reduction in dimensionality 2D (4,4)-grid to 1D double-stranded and sin- gle-stranded chains is seen. Nevertheless, systematic studies of the isophthalate substituent structural effect in series of related cadmium coordination polymers with a particular dipyridyl co- ligand have not been undertaken. In comparison to the rigid-rod tethering ligand 4,4-bipyr- idine (bpy), the simple hydrogen-bonding capable dipyr- idylamide ligand 4-pyridylnicotinamide (4-pna) (Scheme 1) has seen less frequent use in the construction of coordination polymer solids.[18–23] Due to its central amide moiety, 4-pna can engage in supramolecular hydrogen bonding pathways in- accessible to bpy. To date, there have not been many reports of divalent cadmium coordination polymers containing 4-pna. {[Cd(succinate)(4-pna)(H2O)]·2H2O}n shows a vanishingly rare self-penetrated layer topology formed by the cross-pil- laring of [Cd(succinate)]n helical chain motifs,[18] while the Cadmium Isophthalate Coordination Polymers with a 4-Pyridylnicotinamide Precursor adipate derivative {[Cd(adp)(4-pna)2(H2O)2]·2H2O}n shows a simple 1D chain structure.[19] We have recently reported the efficacy of 4-pna as a neutral coligand in the construction of cadmium coordination polymers with aromatic dicarboxylates such as phthalate or homophthalate (hmph). {[Cd2(pht)2(4- pna)(H2O)]·0.25H2O}n has tetranuclear cluster-based [Cd4- (phth)4(H2O)2]n ribbons, connected into grid-like layers by 4- pna tethers.[20] [Cd(hmph)(4-pna)]n possesses [Cd2(hmph)2] dimers conjoined into a 1D ladder polymer by 4-pna li- gands.[21] At longer reaction times and under more acidic pre- parative conditions, the 4-pna ligand underwent in situ hydrol- ysis, forming the nicotinate (nic) ligands present in the simple 1D chain phase [Cd(Hhmph)(nic)(H2O)2]n.[21] It is therefore clear that the dicarboxylate component exerts an extremely substantial structure-directing role during self-assembly of co- ordination polymers solids containing 4-pna, with a potential sensitivity to synthetic conditions. Scheme 1. 4-Pyridylnicotinamide. We thus sought to probe the structural effect imparted by various 5-position substituents in a related series of cadmium isophthalate solids containing the dipodal, hydrogen-bonding capable 4-pna ligand. In this contribution we report the synthe- sis and single-crystal structural characterization of four new coordination polymer solids: [Cd(Brip)(4-pna)]n (1, Brip = 5-bromoisophthalate), [Cd(Hbtc)(4-pna)]n (2, btc = 1,3,5- benzenetricarboxylate), {[Cd2(tbip)(nic)2(H2O)4]·H2O}n (3), and [Cd2(meoip)(nic)2(H2O)2]n (4, meoip = 5-methoxyisoph- thalate). Thermal and luminescent properties of these solids are also discussed herein. Experimental Section General Considerations: Metal salts and 5-substituted isophthalic ac- ids were commercially obtained. The dipyridyl ligand 4-pyridylnico- tinamide (4-pna) was prepared by literature procedures.[24] Water was deionized above 3 MΩ-cm in-house. Elemental analysis was carried out with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS/O Analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on powdered samples with a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One instrument. The luminescence spectra of 1–4 were obtained with a Hitachi F-4500 Fluorescence Spectrometer on solid crystalline samples anchored to quartz microscope slides with Rexon Corporation RX-22P ultraviolet-transparent epoxy adhesive. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed with a TA Instruments Q50 thermal analyzer in flowing nitrogen.

X-ray Crystallography: Diffraction data for 1–4 were collected with a Bruker-AXS SMART-CCD X-ray diffractometer using graphite-mono- chromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The data were processed by SAINT,[25] and subjected to Lorentz and polarization effect and ab- sorption corrections using SADABS [26] for 2–4 or TWINABS [27] for 1. The structures were solved by direct methods with SHELXTL.[28] All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms bound to carbon were placed in calculated positions and refined iso- tropically with a riding model; those bound to nitrogen or oxygen atoms were located by Fourier difference map, and restrained with isotropic displacement parameters. The crystal of 1 was non-merohedr- ally twinned; its twin law was determined using CELL NOW.[29] The R. L. LaDuca et al. ARTICLE Table 1.

Results and Discussion Synthesis and Infrared Spectroscopy Compounds 1–4 were prepared cleanly by hydrothermal re- action of a cadmium salt, the requisite substituted isophthalic acid, and 4-pyridylnicotinamide. Infrared spectra were consis- tent with the structural components as ascertained by X-ray diffraction. Broad, weak bands at ca. 3500 cm–1 signify the O– H bonds in the water molecules of crystallization and amide or pyridyl N–H bonds. Weaker, high energy bands at 3000– 3200 cm–1 are attributed to C–H bond stretching modes in all cases. Asymmetric and symmetric C–O stretching modes of the dicarboxylate or nicotinate ligands are indicated by slightly www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg.

Sharp, medium intensity bands in the range of 1600 cm–1 to 1200 cm–1 are ascribed to stretching modes of the pyridyl rings of the 4-pna or nicotinate coligands and the aromatic rings of the dicarboxylate li- gands.[30] Features corresponding to pyridyl and aryl ring puckering are observed in the region between 800 cm–1 and 600 cm–1. Sharp, moderate intensity bands at 1675 cm–1 (1) and 1683 cm–1 (2) signifies the presence of the amide C=O bond within the intact 4-pna ligands. Structural Description of [Cd(Brip)(4-pna)]n (1) The asymmetric unit of compound 1 consists of a divalent cadmium atom, a 4-pna ligand, and a fully deprotonated Brip ligand (Figure 1a). The coordination sphere of cadmium is a {CdO4N2} distorted octahedron, with the equatorial positions occupied by a chelating carboxylate group from a Brip ligand, an oxygen atom donor from the carboxylate group of a second Brip ligand, and a nitrogen atom donor from the 4-pyr- idylamine side of a 4-pna ligand. The axial positions are occu- pied by an oxygen atom donor from the carboxylate group of a third Brip ligand, and a nitrogen atom donor from the nicotinamide group of a second 4-pna ligand. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination environment are listed in Table 2. Cadmium Isophthalate Coordination Polymers with a 4-Pyridylnicotinamide Precursor Figure 1.

The non-chelating carboxylate group bridges two cad- mium atoms in a syn-anti fashion. Pairs of these bridges create {Cd2(OCO)2} dimers with crystallographic inversion centers situated at their centroids. The Cd···Cd distance within each dimer is 4.455 Å. Each Brip ligand chelates a cadmium cation belonging to another dimer, connecting the {Cd2(OCO)2} di- mers into one-dimensional [Cd(Brip)]n ribbons aligned along the c crystal axis (Figure 1b). Each individual [Cd(Brip)]n ribbon is connected to four others by bridging 4-pna ligands, which span a Cd···Cd dis- tance of 12.862 Å. Through these dipyridyl linkages, a [Cd- (Brip)(4-pna)]n 3D coordination polymer network (Figure 2a) is formed. Considering the center of each {Cd2(OCO)2} dimer to be a six-connected node reveals the topology of the network to be that of a 41263 pcu primitive cubic lattice. Extensive void space within a single net allows interpenetration of a second identical net (Figure 2b). Hydrogen bonds between the 4-pna amide N–H groups and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of other 4- pna ligands provide the supramolecular interaction between the interpenetrated nets (Table 3). Structural Description of [Cd(Hbtc)(4-pna)]n (2) The asymmetric unit of compound 2 consists of a divalent cadmium atom, a 4-pna ligand, and a 1,3,5-benzenetricarb- oxylate (btc) ligand protonated at one of its three carboxylate termini (Figure 3a). The coordination sphere of cadmium is a {CdO4N2} distorted octahedron, with the equatorial positions occupied by a chelating carboxylate group from an Hbtc li- gand, an oxygen atom donor from a carboxylate group of an- other Hbtc ligand, and a 4-pyridylamine nitrogen atom donor Z.

(b) Twofold interpenetration of 6-connected pcu nets in 1. belonging to a 4-pna ligand. Axial positions are taken up by an oxygen atom donor from the carboxylate group of a third Hbtc ligand, and a nicotinamide nitrogen atom donor from an- other 4-pna ligand. The protonated carboxylate group of the Hbtc ligand remains unligated. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination environment are listed in Table 4. Similar to the Brip ligands in 1, the Hbtc ligands in 2 pos- sess an exotridentate η3-κ4O,O:O:O binding mode. Thus two of the carboxylate groups of the Hbtc ligands adopt chelat- ing and bis(bridging) binding modes, whereas the third does not ligate at all. The bis(bridging) carboxylate group bridges two cadmium atoms in a skewed syn-anti fashion. As in 1, pairs of these bridges form {Cd2(OCO)2} dimers centered over crystallographic inversion centers. The Cd···Cd distance within each dimer is 4.445 Å. The {Cd2(OCO)2} dimers are con- nected into [Cd(Hbtc)]n ribbon patterns parallel to the c crystal axis (Figure 3b). Similar to 1, the [Cd(Hbtc)]n ribbons are linked to four others by bridging 4-pna ligands, forming a [Cd(Hbtc)(4- pna)]n 3D coordination polymer network (Figure 4a). The 4- pna ligands span a Cd···Cd distance of 12.842 Å. The {Cd2(OCO)2} dimer act as six-connected nodes, enforcing a twofold interpenetrated 41263 pcu primitive cubic lattice (Fig- ure 4b). The interpenetrated nets are anchored to each other by two different hydrogen bonding patterns (Table 3). The proton- ated carboxylate groups of the Hbtc ligands in one net serve as hydrogen bonding donors to bound oxygen atoms belonging to chelating Hbtc carboxylate groups in the other net. Ad- ditionally, the N–H bonds in the amide moieties of the 4-pna ligands in one net act as hydrogen bonding donors to the carb- onyl oxygen atoms of 4-pna ligands in the other net.

While not specifically tested, it is most likely that the bulk sample is a racemic mixture of enantiomerically pure crystals.

These different distances are enforced by the different carboxylate binding modes, with the monodentate carboxylate of nic-A causing the longer Cd···Cd internuclear span. The {Cd2(nic)2(H2O)4}n chains are oriented along the [1 1¯ 2] crystal direction. In turn, the {Cd2(nic)2(H2O)4}n chain motifs are pillared into [Cd2(tbip)(nic)2(H2O)4]n coordination polymer layers (Figure 6) by monodentate/chelating tbip ligands that conjoin Cd1 and Cd2 atoms in neighboring parallel chains. The tbip ligands span a Cd···Cd internuclear distance of 9.447 Å. Con- sidering each cadmium cation to be a three-connected node reveals that the layer topology is that of a simple hexagonal (6,3) grid. Projecting into the grid apertures are the tert-butyl groups of the tbip ligands. The large aperture sizes, as delin- eated by Cd···Cd through-space distances of 16.499, 17.695, and 17.967 Å, provide ample room for the sterically bulky sub- stituents. Isolated water molecules of crystallization also sit within the grid apertures, held to the coordination polymer layer by hydrogen bonding donation to bound nic-A and nic- B carboxylate oxygen atoms (Table 3). Interlayer interaction is provided by hydrogen bonding be- tween aqua ligands bound to Cd1 and the unligated oxygen atoms of the monodentate tbip carboxylate groups, and be- tween aqua ligands bound to Cd2 and the ligated oxygen atoms of the chelating tbip carboxylate groups. Hydrogen bonding between the aqua ligands and the unligated oxygen atoms of the nic-A ligands also plays a role in the supramolecular interac- tion between neighboring layers. Through these various hydrogen bonding pathways (Table 3), the [Cd2(tbip)(nic) 2(H2O)4]n layers stack in an offset ABCD pattern along the a crystal direction (Figure 7).

There are no water molecules of crystalli- zation, unlike 3. The Cd1 atoms display a distorted {CdO5N} octahedral coordination environment, whereas Cd2 features a {CdO6N} pentagonal bipyramidal coordination sphere. At Cd1 the equatorial positions are filled by a chelating meoip carb- oxylate group, a single oxygen donor from a nic ligand, and a pyridyl nitrogen donor atom from a second nic ligand. The axial positions are taken up by an aqua ligand and a single oxygen donor atom from a second meoip ligand. For Cd2, the equatorial plane of the seven-coordination environment is oc- cupied by a chelating carboxylate group from a meoip ligand, a chelating carboxylate group from a nic ligand, and a pyridyl nitrogen donor atom from a second nic ligand, while the axial sites are filled by an aqua ligand and a single oxygen donor atom from a second meoip ligand. As in 3, the nic ligands are formed from in situ hydrolysis of the 4-pna precursor, and again the 4-aminopyridine byproduct is not incorporated into the resulting crystal.

The meoip ligands in 4 adopt a chelating/chelating-bridging η3-κ4O,O:O,O:O binding mode. One of the nic ligands rests in an exotridentate monodentate/bridging η3-κ3N:O:O binding mode, whereas the other nic ligand has a simple mono- dentate/chelating binding mode with notation η2-κ3N:O,O. Chelating-bridging carboxylate groups from a meoip ligand and from a nic ligand thus form an anti-syn bridged {Cd2(OCO)2} dimeric unit with a Cd···Cd through-space dis- tance of 4.134 Å. Then, the chelating-only carboxylate termini of the meoip ligands connect two dimeric units into [Cd4(meoip)2(nic)2(H2O)2]2+ cationic tetrameric units (Fig- ure 8b) within an interior Cd···Cd distance of 7.513 Å. In turn these are connected by the monodentate/chelating nic ligands into [Cd2(meoip)(nic)2(H2O)2]n coordination polymer layers (Figure 9a). Treating the {Cd2(OCO)2} dimeric units as con- necting nodes reveals an underlying (6,3) graphitic layer top- ology (Figure 9b), similar to that based on the isolated cad- mium atoms in 3. Adjacent [Cd2(meoip)(nic)2(H2O)2]n layers aggregate by hydrogen bonding donation (Table 3) from the Figure 9. (a) [Cd2(meoip)(nic)2(H2O)2]n layer in 4.

Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2014, 1922–1929 1928 aqua ligands in one layer to meoip carboxylate oxygen atoms in the two neighboring layers. Luminescence Spectra Due to the closed shell d10 electronic configuration of the cadmium ions in these three new coordination polymer solids, visible light d–d absorptions are forbidden. Thus a spectral window exists between 400 and 700 nm, allowing the possibil- ity of ligand-based visible-light luminescence. The excitation spectra for 1–4 were monitored at an emission of 400 nm, with maximum excitation wavelengths of 215 nm for 1–3, and 245 nm for 4. Using these particular excitation wavelengths, modest blue-violet visible light fluorescence was observed in all cases. The emission maxima for 1–4 were as follows: 381 nm (1), 390 nm (2), 391 nm (3), and 402 nm (4). All fluo- rescent behavior in 1–4 is attributed to π–π* molecular orbital transitions within the aromatic rings belonging to the dicarb- oxylate and either dipyridyl ligands (1, 2) or nicotinate ligands (3, 4).[7] Differences in excitation and emission wavelengths arise from variances in dicarboxylate binding mode and the specific supramolecular environments. Emission spectra for 1–4 are shown in Figures S1–S4 (Supporting Information). Thermal Properties Compound 1 showed a largely steady mass until 200 °C. A slight mass loss of 2.7% was observed between 200 °C and 350 °C, likely ascribed to partial decarboxylation. The organic ligands combusted above this temperature. The final remnant of 30.8% at 600 °C correlated well with a deposition of CdCO3 (31.7% calculated). The mass of compound 2 largely remained stable until ca. 150 °C. A mass loss of 7.2% by 330 °C is attributed to some decarboxylation (8.5% calculated for one equivalent of CO2). Ligand combustion occurred above 400 °C. Dehydration of compound 3 was observed between 25 °C and 145 °C, with a mass loss of 10.0% roughly corre- sponding to ejection of five molar equivalents of water (11.6% calculated). Ligand ejection occurred above 250 °C. Aqua li- gand loss and decarboxylation of 4 occurred between 25 °C and 1525 °C, with a total mass loss of 10.9% corresponding to loss of two equiv. of water and one equiv. of CO2 (total 10.2% calculated). A rapid mass loss above 325 °C represents catastrophic ligand ejection. TGA traces for 1–4 are shown in Figures S5–S8 (Supporting Information). Conclusions Synergistic interplay between isophthalate substituent steric bulk and covalent and supramolecular structure-directing inter- actions provided by the seldom-used 4-pyridylnicotinamide coligand resulted in a series of 2D or 3D divalent cadmium coordination polymers. In the case of moderately sterically bulky substituents such as a bromo group or carboxylate group, dimer-based twofold interpenetrated primitive cubic net top- ologies were observed. Higher temperatures appear to promote Cadmium Isophthalate Coordination Polymers with a 4-Pyridylnicotinamide Precursor the in situ hydrolysis of the 4-pyridylnicotinamide precursor to form nicotinate anions. These tend to cause the generation of 2D graphite net coordination polymer topologies. The smaller methoxy substituent permits the formation of dimeric units as seen in the bromo and carboxylate cases. Such dimeric units are absent in the tert-butyl derivative, perhaps due to the extreme steric bulk imparted by the substituents. In this case, isolated divalent cadmium ions are the connecting nodes for the construction of the graphite net topology. It is clear that substantial coordination polymer structural diversity can be achieved by variance of the substituent in isophthalate type ligands.
