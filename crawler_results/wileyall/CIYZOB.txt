Manuscript & Bimetallic Helices Multifunctionality in Bimetallic LnIII[WV(CN)8]3 (Ln=Gd, Nd) Coordination Helices: Optical Activity, Luminescence, and Magnetic Coupling Szymon Chorazy,[a, b] Koji Nakabayashi,[b] Mirosław Arczynski,[a] Robert Pełka,[c] Shin- ichi Ohkoshi,*[b, d] and Barbara Sieklucka*[a] Abstract: Two chiral luminescent derivatives of pyridine bis- (oxazoline) (Pybox), (SS/RR)-iPr-Pybox (2,6-bis[4-isopropyl-2- oxazolin-2-yl]pyridine) and (SRSR/RSRS)-Ind-Pybox (2,6- bis[8H-indeno[1,2-d]oxazolin-2-yl]pyridine), have been com- bined with lanthanide ions (Gd3+, Nd3+) and octacyanotung- state(V) metalloligand to afford a remarkable series of eight bimetallic CN-bridged coordination chains: {[LnIII(SS/RR-iPr- Pybox)(dmf)4]3[WV(CN)8]3}n·dmf·4H2O (Ln=Gd, 1-SS and 1-RR; Ln=Nd, 2-SS and 2-RR) and {[LnIII(SRSR/RSRS-Ind-Pybox)- (dmf)4][WV(CN)8]}n·5MeCN·4MeOH (Ln=Gd, 3-SRSR and 3- RSRS; Ln=Nd, 4-SRSR and 4-RSRS). These materials display enantiopure structural helicity, which results in strong optical activity in the range 200–450 nm, as confirmed by natural circular dichroism (NCD) spectra and the corresponding UV/ Vis absorption spectra. Under irradiation with UV light, the GdIII-WV chains show dominant ligand-based red phosphor- escence, with lmax660 nm for 1-(SS/RR) and 680 nm for 3- (SRSR/RSRS). The NdIII-WV chains, 2-(SS/RR) and 4-(SRSR/RSRS), exhibit near-infrared luminescence with sharp lines at 986, 1066, and 1340 nm derived from intra-f 4F3/2!4I9/2,11/2,13/2 tran- sitions of the NdIII centers. This emission is realized through efficient ligand-to-metal energy transfer from the Pybox de- rivative to the lanthanide ion. Due to the presence of para- magnetic lanthanide(III) and [WV(CN)8]3 moieties connected by cyanide bridges, 1-(SS/RR) and 3-(SRSR/RSRS) are ferrimag- netic spin chains originating from antiferromagnetic cou- pling between GdIII (SGd=7/2) and WV (SW=1/2) centers with J1-(SS)=0.96(1) cm1, J1-(RR)=0.95(1) cm1, J3-(SRSR)= 0.91(1) cm1, and J3-(RSRS)=0.94(1) cm1. 2-(SS/RR) and 4- (SRSR/RSRS) display ferromagnetic coupling within their NdIII- NC-WV linkages. Introduction The quest for sophisticated materials displaying various coex- isting magnetic, conductive, luminescent, and nonlinear optical properties is one of the most challenging topics in chemistry and materials science.[1–4] A rational approach for the design of multifunctional molecular materials involves judicious selection of molecular building blocks, each of which imparts a desired chemical or physical property.[5–8] Using a molecular building block approach, several interest- ing combinations of functionalities have been reported for molecule-based materials.[6–8] Among the most promising mul- tifunctional materials are molecular magnets combining mag- netic phenomena (magnetic coupling, long-range magnetic or- dering, slow magnetic relaxation, spin bistability) with a second functionality.[7,9–13] In these materials, the intrinsic magnetic nature and the other physical property can simply coexist, modify each other, or strongly interact giving unique cross-effects.[11,12] The combination of chirality and long-range magnetic ordering in 2D and 3D coordination networks can strongly enhance magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and mag- neto-chiral dichroism (MChD) signals below the critical temper- ature. For example, an enhanced MCD effect has been ob- served in cyanido-bridged MnII(L)-CrIII (TC=38 K, L=(S)-1,2-di- aminopropane)[14] and MnII(L)-NbIV (TC=23.5 K, L=(S/R)-a- methyl-2-pyridinemethanol) ferrimagnets,[15] and an enhanced MChD effect has been observed in an oxalate-bridged MnII-CrIII (TC=7 K) ferromagnetic network with chiral [N(CH3)(n-C3H7)2(S/ R)-{CH(CH3)C2H5}]+ counterions.[16] The nonlinear optical effect [a] S.

This cross-effect, called magnetization-induced second harmonic generation (MSHG), has been reported in unique cyanido-bridged MnII(L1/L2)-NbIV molecular ferrimagnets (TC=48 K, L1=pyrazine; TC=43 K, L2= urea),[17,18] a CsI-CoII-CrIII Prussian Blue analogue (TC=46 K),[19] and an MnII-CrIII (TC=7 K) oxalate ferromagnet with a chiral [N(CH3)(n-C3H7)2(S/R)-{CH(CH3)C2H5}]+ counterion.[20] There have been a few reports on the introduction of chirality in low-di- mensional systems displaying slow magnetic relaxation,[21–23] and the influence of magnetic hysteresis, which is characteris- tic of single-molecule magnet behavior, on the MCD effect has been demonstrated for an Mn6-[(R)-sao] ((R)-sao=chiral salicyl- aldoxime derivative) cluster.[24] Magnetic phenomena have also been combined with lumi- nescence properties in unique examples of bifunctional molec- ular materials. Magnetic coupling leading to long-range mag- netic ordering together with significant emission were found for a carboxylate-bridged NiII network (TC=9.5 K),[25] a cyanido- bridged TbIII-WV system (TC=2.8 K),[26] and an oxamato-bridged CoII-CuII coordination assembly (TC=19 K) with embedded lu- minescent [RuII(L)3]2+ (L=2,2’-bipyridine) complexes.[11] Modifi- cation of the emission intensity and wavelength below TC was noticed in the case of NiII and CoII-CuII systems, but the origin and details of this cross-effect were not clarified. Luminescence has also been observed for quantum molecular magnets, mainly single-ion magnets based on DyIII, and correlations be- tween the luminescence characteristics and the electronic structure responsible for slow magnetic relaxation were pre- sented.[27–29] The first reports on the combination of luminescence or chirality with molecular magnetism show great promise for finding unique magneto-optical phenomena. However, the number of known materials combining these functionalities is very limited, and most of them have been found by serendipi- ty rather than by rational design. In this context, we have fo- cused on a quest to devise efficient synthetic approaches lead- ing to such multifunctional materials. Our aim has been to design and synthesize magnetic systems combining chirality and luminescence. To achieve this, the selected building blocks have to impart magnetic coupling, a distinct luminescence signal, and chirality. Bimetallic coordination polymers based on lanthanides and octacyanidometallates are capable of meeting these requirements.[26] Most lanthanide(III) ions are paramag- netic, often associated with significant magnetic anisotropy, permitting observation of slow relaxation of magnetization.[30] They are often luminescent in either the visible (e.g., EuIII, TbIII) or near-infrared range (e.g., NdIII, ErIII).[31] Octacyanides of MoV, WV, and NbIV are paramagnetic, and bear eight cyanide ligands capable of mediating magnetic coupling through superex- change interaction.[32] In contrast to most transition metal ions, they do not absorb visible or near-infrared light, which allows the detection of lanthanide- or ligand-based luminescence.[26] Additionally, chirality can be easily introduced into such bi- metallic systems by the coordination of appropriate ligands at the lanthanide centers.[32] In the last few years, our group and others have synthesized several bimetallic LnIII-[MV(CN)8] (Ln=lanthanide ion, M=Mo, W) coordination systems.[26,32–40] Near-infrared luminescence combined with ferromagnetic coupling was found for one-di- mensional {[NdIII(phen)2(dmf)2(H2O)][MoV(CN)8]}·2H2O and {[NdIII- (phen)(dmf)5][MV(CN)8]}·H2O (M=Mo, W; phen=1,10-phenan- throline, dmf=N,N’-dimethylformamide) systems,[36] while visi- ble luminescence with long-range magnetic ordering was de- tected for a series of canonical {[MIII(H2O)5][MV(CN)8]} (MIII=Eu, Tb, Eu-Gd=1:1, Eu-Tb=1:1, Tb-Sm=1:1; MV=Mo, W) coordi- nation layers.[26,35] All of these compounds crystallized in a cen- trosymmetric space group, and thus exhibited only bifunction- al magneto-luminescent character. Very recently, we opened a new perspective, reporting a pair of enantiomorphic {[EuIII(SS-iPr-Pybox)(dmf)4]3[WV(CN)8]3}·dmf·8H2O and {[EuIII(RR- iPr-Pybox)(dmf)4]3[WV(CN)8]3}·dmf·8H2O (iPr-Pybox=2,6-bis(4- isopropyl-2-oxazolin-2-yl)pyridine) helical chains that displayed chirality, paramagnetism, and thermally switchable lumines- cence between blue ligand-based and red f-centered emis- sion.[37] We achieved this by the application of chiral Pybox (Pybox= pyridine bis(oxazoline)) derivatives, which are intrinsically fluo- rescent and phosphorescent, and have been shown to be effi- cient sensitizers for f-centered luminescence in chiral lantha- nide-based coordination systems.[41–44] Unfortunately, the re- ported EuIII-WV system showed only paramagnetism with negli- gible magnetic coupling due to the diamagnetic ground state of EuIII.[37] Therefore, for the construction of helical magnetic chains, we have now applied NdIII and GdIII centers exhibiting paramagnetic ground states of 4I9/2 and 8S7/2, respectively. Moreover, NdIII compounds exhibit near-infrared phosphores- cence due to 4F3/2!4I9/2,11/2,13/2 transitions, while GdIII is non-lu- minescent in the Vis-NIR range, allowing the observation of ligand-based emission.[31] To induce chirality and enhance lumi- nescence, we continued our investigations of chiral Pybox de- rivatives, specifically iPr-Pybox and Ind-Pybox (Scheme 1). Herein, we report the synthesis and comprehensive structur- al, optical, and magnetic study of four pairs of enantiomorphic coordination helices: {[LnIII(SS/RR-iPr-Pybox)(dmf)4]3[WV(CN)8]3}n ·dmf·4H2O (Ln=Gd, 1-SS and 1-RR; Ln=Nd, 2-SS and 2-RR) and {[LnIII(SRSR/RSRS-Ind-Pybox)(dmf)4][WV(CN)8]}n·5MeCN ·4MeOH (Ln=Gd, 3-SRSR and 3-RSRS; Ln=Nd, 4-SRSR and 4- RSRS).

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, performed at low temperature, of crystals coated with Apie- zon N revealed 1-(SS), 1-(RR), 2-(SS), and 2-(RR) to be one-di- mensional cyanido-bridged coordination polymers aligned along the [101] crystallographic direction (Figure 1, Table 1, Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The chains are con- structed from alternately connected {[LnIII(SS/RR-iPr-Pybox)- (dmf)4]3+ (1-(SS) and 1-(RR): Ln=Gd; 2-(SS) and 2-(RR): Ln=Nd) and [WV(CN)8]3 ions. The asymmetric units contain three LnIII complexes, three [WV(CN)8]3 ions, one non-coordinated dmf molecule, and four water molecules of solvation (Figure 2). Each octacyanotungstate(V) moiety forms two cyanide bridges, while the six remaining cyanide ligands are terminal. Thorough investigation of the coordination polyhedra by continuous shape measure analysis and the dihedral angles method re- vealed that all of the cyanide complexes of WV adopt a geome- try very close to the ideal square antiprism (SAPR-8) of D4d symmetry (Tables S3 and S4).[45,46] Lanthanide(III) sites are nine- coordinated and exhibit a geometry intermediate between a capped square antiprism (CSAPR-9, C4v) and a tricapped trigonal prism (TCTPR-9, D3h) (Tables S5 and S6).[45,47] Each LnIII is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms of bridging cyanide li- Figure 1.

The cyanide Ln-NC-W bridges are only slightly bent, giving long Ln-W distances of 5.81, 5.88, and 5.91  for GdIII- containing 1-(SS) and 1-(RR) and of 5.86, 5.93, and 5.95  for 2- (SS) and 2-(RR) with the larger NdIII centers. Due to the presence of sterically expanded and chiral (RR/ SS)-iPr-Pybox ligands coordinated to LnIII, the chains of 1-(SS), 1-(RR), 2-(SS), and 2-(RR) are not linear but display helicity (Figure 1). The structures and geometries of these helices are determined by the triangular alignment of the metal centers: Ln atoms create large triangles, while W centers are arranged Table 1.

The bridging cya- nide ligands connect the metal ions in an Ln1-W1-Ln2-W2-Ln3- W3 sequence, which results in a clockwise rotation and exclu- sively right-handed helices in 1-(SS) and 2-(SS), and an anti- clockwise rotation giving left-handed helices in 1-(RR) and 2- (RR). Molecular chains of 1-(SS), 1-(RR), 2-(SS), and 2-(RR) are ar- ranged in parallel along the [101] direction (Figure 3a). This alignment is mainly controlled by the steric effects on the pyri- dine rings of the Pybox ligands of neighboring chains, and in- teractions with non-coordinated water and dmf molecules. The shortest interchain metal–metal distances for 1-(SS) and 1-(RR) within the bc plane are 9.57 (Gd1-W3), 9.68 (Gd2-W2), 10.12 (Gd2-W2), and 10.22  (Gd3-W1) (Figure 3b). Slightly longer distances of 9.60 (Nd1-W3), 9.71 (Nd2-W2), 10.19 (Nd2-W2), and 10.30  (Nd3-W1) are found in 2-(SS) and 2-(RR) containing larger NdIII centers. Similar closest contacts are observed in the ac plane: 9.97 (Gd3-W2) and 10.24  (Gd1-W1) for 1-(SS) and 1- (RR); 10.04 (Nd3-W2) and 10.28  (Nd1-W1) for 2-(SS) and 2- (RR) (Figure 3c). The interchain space is filled by non-coordinat- ed dmf and disordered water molecules, both creating supra- molecular layers within the ab plane (Figure S3). Taking into ac- count the metric parameters of the coordination skeleton, the geometries at the metal centers, and the supramolecular net- works, 1-(SS) is a perfect structural mirror image of 1-(RR). Due to the presence of NdIII, which is slightly larger than GdIII, the structural parameters of 2-(SS/RR) are somewhat larger than their equivalents in 1-(SS/RR), but 2-(SS) and 2-(RR) are again perfectly isostructural mirror images (Figures 1–3, Table S1). Crystal structures of 3-(SRSR), 3-(RSRS), 4-(SRSR), and 4-(RSRS) Needle-shaped single crystals of 3-(SRSR), 3-(RSRS), 4-(SRSR), and 4-(RSRS) were grown by slow diffusion of diethyl ether into solutions of the Ind-Pybox ligand, the lanthanide(III) ni- trate, and the tetrabutylammonium salt of octacyanotungsta- te(V) in a mixed solvent system of acetonitrile/dichlorometh- ane/methanol/N,N’-dimethylformamide. Single-crystal X-ray dif- fraction analysis performed at low temperature for crystals coated with Apiezon N indicated that 3-(SRSR), 3-(RSRS), 4- (SRSR), and 4-(RSRS) consist of cyanido-bridged 1,1-chains ar- ranged along the crystallographic a-axis (Figure 4, Table 1, Table S2). The one-dimensional polymers consist of [LnIII(SRSR/ RSRS-Ind-Pybox)(dmf)4]3+ (3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS): Ln=Gd; 4- (SRSR) and 4-(RSRS): Ln=Nd) and [WV(CN)8]3 ions connected in an alternating manner. The asymmetric units comprise one LnIII complex, one [WV(CN)8]3 ion, five molecules of acetoni- trile, and four molecules of methanol (Figure 5). Two cyanide li- gands of each octacyanotungstate(V) moiety are bridging, while the other six are terminal. Continuous shape measure analysis in conjunction with the dihedral angles method showed that the [WV(CN)8]3 ions adopt an almost ideal square antiprism (SAPR-8, D4d) geometry (Tables S7 and S8). The lanthanide(III) centers are nine-coordinated, and display an in- termediate geometry between a capped square antiprism (CSAPR-9, C4v) and a tricapped trigonal prism (TCTPR-9, D3h) (Ta- bles S9 and S10).

KGaA, Weinheim 7148 Full Paper sphere made up of two N atoms of bridging cyanide ligands, three N atoms of Ind-Pybox, and four O atoms of dmf mole- cules. The W-CN-Ln bridges are almost linear, resulting in long Ln-W distances of 5.88 and 5.91  in GdIII-containing 3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS) and of 5.92 and 5.94  in 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS) with the larger NdIII centers. The steric effect and chirality of the (SRSR/RSRS)-Ind-Pybox ligand, originating from the expanded indole groups attached to the Pybox skeleton, gives rise to the helical shape of the molecular chains found in 3-(SRSR), 3-(RSRS), 4-(SRSR), and 4- (RSRS) (Figure 4). Looking along the axes of their helices, their structures are controlled by the quadrilateral arrangement of alternately connected Ln and W centers. For 3-(SRSR) and 4- (SRSR), a clockwise rotation and exclusively right-handed heli- ces are observed, whereas an anticlockwise rotation and left- handed helices are induced in 3-(RSRS) and 4-(RSRS). The coordination chains of 3-(SRSR), 3-(RSRS), 4-(SRSR), and 4-(RSRS) are aligned in a parallel fashion along the [100] direc- tion, which is determined by the spatial arrangement of the pyridine and indole groups of the Ind-Pybox ligands, as well as weak interactions between numerous solvent molecules (Fig- ure 6a). The interchain contacts are the same within the (011) and (011¯) crystallographic layers, both perpendicular to the di- rection of the cyanido-bridged polymers. The shortest inter- chain metal–metal distance in 3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS) is 8.64  (Gd1-W1), whereas that in 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS) is slightly longer at 8.68  (Nd1-W1) (Figure 6b). The interchain space is filled by a number of acetonitrile and methanol solvent mole- cules, which are only weakly bonded through hydrogen bonds between the OH groups of methanol and the N atoms of the terminal cyanide ligands (Figure S4). All metric parameters of the coordination skeleton and the supramolecular network are, within experimental error, the same for 3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS), indicating perfect isostructurality of these two enantiomorphs.

KGaA, Weinheim 7149 Full Paper The NdIII-containing 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS) display a slight ex- pansion of the whole structure in comparison to the GdIII com- pounds, which is simply a consequence of the increased ionic radius of NdIII, but 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS) are still perfectly iso- structural mirror images (Figures 4–6, Table S2). Optical activity The natural optical activities of compounds 1–4, expected on the basis of their chiral crystal structures, were investigated by means of natural circular dichroism (NCD) spectroscopy to- gether with UV/Vis/NIR diffuse-reflectance spectra, and the re- sults are shown in Figures 7 and 8. The strong absorptions of 1-(SS), 1-(RR), 2-(SS), and 2-(RR) range from the UV region up to 450 nm, with prominent maxima at 255, 288, and 368 nm (Figure 7). The UV bands are the complex sum of components originating from p-p* transitions of the iPr-Pybox ligands and N,N’-dimethylformamide, as well as from CN to WV ligand-to- metal charge transfer (LMCT).[41,48] Above 310 nm, exclusively E’’(2B1)!E’(2A2) and E’’(2B1)!E’(2E) transitions of LMCT character are observed for the [WV(CN)8]3 moieties. For NdIII-containing 2-(SS) and 2-(RR), additional weak absorption is detected in the visible and near-infrared range, with relatively sharp maxima at 520, 580, 622, 682, 745, 802, and 870 nm resulting from parity- forbidden f-f transitions (Figure S5).[31] In NCD spectra, 1-(SS) exhibits a positive Cotton effect in the regions 200–255 and 380–420 nm, while negative bands are detected in the regions 255–380 and 420–460 nm (Figure 7a). The NCD spectrum of 1- (RR) is a perfect mirror image of the pattern for 1-(SS), which unequivocally proves the enantiopure nature of both com- pounds. Additionally, the NCD signal is related to the whole absorption, indicating an efficient transfer of chirality from the iPr-Pybox ligands to the metal centers.[49] Similar relationships between the NCD spectra are observed for 2-(SS) and 2-(RR), but the spectra are of a different shape to that for 1-(SS/RR). That of 2-(SS) displays a positive signal between 200 and 275 nm, while a broad negative band with multiple maxima is observed between 275 and 455 nm (Figure 7b). The homochi- ral character of 2-(SS) and 2-(RR) can be easily deduced as the NCD spectrum of the RR-enantiomer is a perfect mirror image of the pattern found for the SS-enantiomer. Optical activity was not found for 2-(SS) and 2-(RR) above 500 nm in the visible and near-infrared range, which can be attributed to very low absorption coefficients of the f-f transitions responsible for weak absorption in this region. The natural optical activity of 3-(SRSR), 3-(RSRS), 4-(SRSR), and 4-(RSRS) was also investigated by solid-state UV/Vis ab- sorption and NCD spectra (Figure 8). The strong absorptions of compounds 3 and 4 start in the UV region and cover the wavelength range to 450 nm, with a relatively strong tail up to 480 nm, which is slightly longer than that for 1-(SS/RR) and 2- (SS/RR). Three prominent maxima are observed at around 255, 300, and 370 nm. The UV absorption is related to both ligand- centered p-p* and [WV(CN)8]3-based LMCT transitions, while the visible part is only connected with LMCT, as neither Ind- Pybox nor dmf possesses appropriate low-lying excited states.[41] An additional weak absorption in the Vis-NIR region with maxima at 520, 580, 628, 682, 746, 800, and 870 nm is ob- served for 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS) due to NdIII-centered f-f transi- tions from the 4I9/2 ground state (Figure S5). The NCD spectra of 3-(SRSR) and 4-(SRSR) are very similar, and consist of a weak negative signal from 200 to 288 nm, followed by a positive Cotton effect to 330 nm and a relatively strong and broad pos- itive band to 460 nm. The NCD spectra of 3-(RSRS) and 4- (RSRS) are precise mirror images of the patterns found for 3- (SRSR) and 4-(SRSR), respectively, which indicate the enantio- pure character of these compounds and efficient transfer of chirality from the Ind-Pybox ligands to the metal centers.

KGaA, Weinheim 7150 Full Paper to the very weak electronic absorption, no optical activity could be detected for 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS) above 500 nm in the visible and near-infrared range. Luminescence properties The photoluminescence properties of 1-(SS/RR), 2-(SS/RR), 3- (SRSR/RSRS), and 4-(SRSR/RSRS) were investigated by means of solid-state emission and excitation spectra collected at liquid- nitrogen temperature, and the experimental results are pre- sented in Figures 9 and 10 and Figures S6 and S7. Under exci- tation with UV light at lexc=340 nm, GdIII-containing 1-(SS/RR) and 3-(SRSR/RSRS) exhibited strong red luminescence due to broad emission bands with their maxima at 660 and 680 nm, respectively (Figure 9a,b). This emission can be attributed to T1!S0 phosphorescence of the Pybox derivatives, since poten- tially emissive 6PJ (J=3/2, 5/2, 7/2) excited states of GdIII can be assumed to be too high-lying to observe any lanthanide- based luminescence in the visible range (Figure 9c).[50] Howev- er, the presence of heavy GdIII centers coordinated to the Pybox derivatives gives rise to a heavy-atom effect (HAE) pro- moting S1!T1 intersystem crossing (ISC), which results in strong ligand-centered phosphorescence.[51] Due to this HAE phenomenon, both 1-(SS/RR) and 3-(SRSR/RSRS) show only re- sidual S1!S0 self-fluorescence of the organic ligands in the range 400–500 nm, which is much weaker than that observed for pure iPr-Pybox and Ind-Pybox (Figure S6). The excitation spectra monitored at an emission wavelength of 655 nm con- sist of broad bands with maxima at 325 and 330 nm for 1-(SS/ RR) and 3-(SRSR/RSRS), respectively. These bands are compara- ble to the excitation spectra of pure iPr-PyBox and Ind-Pybox, confirming the ligand-based character of the luminescence of these materials. The emission properties of 1-(SS/RR) and 3- (SRSR/RSRS) are very similar and are independent of the enan- tiomorph as the whole emission light, without resolution into right- and left-polarized components, is analyzed in the experi- ment. The ratios between intensity of phosphorescence and fluorescence were around 7.5 and 28 for 1-(SS/RR) and 3- (SRSR/RSRS), respectively. This proves that a more efficient HAE-enhanced intersystem crossing process is observed for Figure 9.

KGaA, Weinheim 7151 Full Paper the Ind-Pybox ligand compared to iPr-Pybox, which leads to relatively stronger phosphorescence in 3-(SRSR/RSRS). The photoluminescence properties of NdIII-containing 2-(SS/ RR) and 4-(SRSR/RSRS) were also determined, as presented in Figure 10. Under irradiation with UV light at T=77 K, powder samples of both 2-(SS/RR) and 4-(SRSR/RSRS) displayed near-in- frared luminescence with three bands at 896, 1066, and 1340 nm. This emission is related to f-f 4F3/2!4IJ (J=9/2, 11/2, 13/2) transitions.[31,36,52] The excitation spectra for emission monitored at 1065 nm exhibit large bands with maxima at 315 and 335 nm for 2-(SS/RR) and 4-(SRSR/RSRS), respectively (Fig- ure 10a,b). This can be ascribed to excited states of Pybox, suggesting a ligand-to-Nd3+ energy-transfer mechanism. The excitation UV light is absorbed by the Pybox ligands due to their S0!S1 transition, which is followed by S1!T1 intersystem crossing, enhanced by the heavy atom effect arising from the presence of the heavy lanthanide ions. The energy is subse- quently transferred from the ligand T1 state to the emissive 4F3/2 state of NdIII, ultimately resulting in an f-based emission in the NIR range (Figure 10c). This interpretation is not only strongly supported by the excitation spectra, but also by the low residual self-fluorescence of the Pybox derivatives and the absence of T1!S0 ligand-centered phosphorescence (Fig- ure S7). Besides the energy-transfer mechanism, both 2-(SS/RR) and 4-(SRSR/RSRS) display visible-light direct intra-f excitation, as manifested in a series of sharp excitation lines at 455, 510, 575, 620, 675, 735, 795, and 870 nm attributable to 4I9/2! 2K13/2,15/2, 2G9/2,7/2, 4G11/2,9/2,7/2,5/2, 2H11/2,9/2, 4F9/2,7/2,5/2,3/2, and 4S3/2 transitions. The emissions of 2-(SS/RR) and 4-(SRSR/RSRS) are generally the same, and independent of the enantiomorph. The average ratio between emission intensity under ligand ex- citation and direct f-excitation is higher for 4-(SRSR/RSRS), indi- cating that Ind-Pybox is a better sensitizer for NIR emission. This is due to the fact that the triplet state of Ind-Pybox is situ- ated closer to the emissive 4F3/2 state of Nd3+ than the T1 state of iPr-Pybox, favoring more efficient energy transfer in 4-(SRSR/ RSRS).[52] Magnetic properties of 1-(SS) and 1-(RR) The direct-current (dc) magnetic properties of 1-(SS) and 1-(RR) are presented in Figure 11 and Figure S8. Room temperature cMT values for the GdIII 3WV 3 units were determined as 24.0 and 24.1 Kcm3mol1 for 1-(SS) and 1-(RR), respectively. These are slightly lower than the value of 24.7 Kcm3mol1 expected for free-ion contributions from three WV (SW=1/2, gW=2) and three GdIII (SGd=7/2, gGd=2) centers. On cooling, the cMT prod- uct decreases slowly down to 50 K and then more sharply below this point. The minimum cMT of 21.7 Kcm3mol1 for both enantiomorphs is reached at 6.5 K, and thereafter an in- crease in cMT up to 26.2 Kcm3mol1 (SS and RR) at T=2 K is observed (Figure 11a). Curie–Weiss fits of the T dependences of the inverse magnetic susceptibilities yielded Curie constants of C1-SS=24.1 Kcm3mol1 and C1-RR=24.2 Kcm3mol1, close to the free-ion value, and a small Weiss constant of q=0.77 K for both 1-(SS) and 1-(RR) (Figure S8). The minima in the cMT versus T plots indicate the presence of antiferromagnetic cou- pling between the metal centers. The negative value of q is in- dicative of weak antiferromagnetic interchain coupling. Fig- ure 11b shows the field dependences of magnetization for 1- (SS) and 1-(RR) at T=2 K and T=4 K. In a field of H=70 kOe, the monotonically increasing M curves reach values of 20.7 (T=2 K) and 20.0 Nb (T=4 K) for 1-(SS) and of 20.5 (T=2 K) and 20.1 Nb (T=4 K) for 1-(RR). These values are close to the 18 Nb expected for antiferromagnetic coupling between GdIII and WV before spin reorientation transition and lower than the saturation value of 24 Nb corresponding to ferromagnetic cou- pling. This again indicates that the Gd-W interaction is of an antiferromagnetic nature, leading to ferrimagnetic spin chains of 1-(SS) and 1-(RR). Due to the very low magnetic anisotropy of GdIII and WV centers, neither enantiomorph shows any signal in alternating current (ac) magnetic measurements, even in the presence of a dc magnetic field, which excludes slow relaxation of the magnetization in these systems. To estimate the strength of the GdIII-WV magnetic coupling, the magnetic properties of 1-(SS) and 1-(RR) were simulated using Seiden’s model as these systems consist of infinite chains, in which the large spin of GdIII (SGd=7/2) alternates with the small spin of WV (SW=1/2).[53] The Hamiltonian of such a model can be expressed according to Equation (1): ^H ¼ X N i¼1  JðSi þ Siþ1Þ  si þ mB~H X N i¼1ðGSzi þ gsziÞ ð1Þ where the upper-case letters correspond to the spin of GdIII and the lower-case letters denote the spin of WV. G and g are the Land factors of the related spins. The T dependences of Figure 11.

KGaA, Weinheim 7152 Full Paper susceptibility and isothermal M were simultaneously fitted to find optimal values of the average exchange coupling constant J and the G factor for GdIII (for details, see the Supporting Infor- mation). The best fit gave J=0.96(1) cm1 and G=1.97(1) for 1-(SS) and J=0.95(1) cm1 and G=1.97(1) for 1-(RR). The best-fit magnetic curves are in good agreement with the ex- perimental data (Figure 11). The calculated cMT values at the lowest T are slightly higher than the experimental values, sug- gesting that weak antiferromagnetic interchain interactions are neglected in the model. Simulation of the magnetic properties confirmed the antifer- romagnetic nature of the GdIII-WV exchange coupling, leading to ferrimagnetic character of the coordination chains in 1-(SS) and 1-(RR). Magnetic coupling with the same sign and magni- tude has been found in other reported Gd-W cyanido-bridged systems.[33,34,38] No significant differences were observed be- tween 1-(SS) and 1-(RR), which can be attributed to the perfect isostructurality of these enantiomorphs. Magnetic properties of 2-(SS) and 2-(RR) The dc magnetic properties of 2-(SS) and 2-(RR) in the form of cMT–T and M–H plots are presented in Figure 12. At T=300 K, the cMT products for the NdIII 3WV 3 units were measured as 4.5 and 4.6 Kcm3mol1 for 2-(SS) and 2-(RR), respectively. These are lower than the value of 6.0 Kcm3mol1 corresponding to the free-ion contributions from three WV (SW=1/2, gW=2) and three NdIII (J=9/2, gJ=8/11) centers. This may be attributed to crystal field effects, through which the 4I9/2 ground state of Nd3+ is splitted. Upon cooling, cMT decreases steadily, reaching a minimum value of 3.2 Kcm3mol1 at 13.5 K for 2-(SS) and of 3.3 Kcm3mol1 at 12.5 K for 2-(RR). Thereafter, the cMT values increase abruptly to 4.3 (2-SS) and 4.5 Kcm3mol1 (2-RR) at T= 2 K (Figure 12a). Fitting of the Curie–Weiss law to the inverse magnetic susceptibility versus T curve over the range 50–300 K yielded Curie constants of C2-SS=4.3 Kcm3mol1 and C2-RR= 4.8 Kcm3mol1, lower than the free-ion value, and Weiss con- stants of q2-SS=18.2 K and q2-RR=16.9 K (Figure S9). The continuous decrease in cMT on cooling can be ascribed to pro- gressive depopulation of the Stark levels arising from the split- ting of the 4I9/2 ground state of NdIII. The significant negative Weiss constant can also be ascribed to crystal field effects rather than intrachain interactions. Figure 12b presents the experimental data for the H de- pendences of the magnetization for 2-(SS) and 2-(RR) at T=2 K and T=4 K. The curves display a monotonic increase with in- creasing field, and at a field of 70 kOe attain values of 6.8 Nb at T=2 K and 6.3 Nb at T=4 K for both enantiomorphs. These values are much lower than the saturation value of 12.8 Nb ex- pected for three isolated NdIII and three isolated WV centers. However, it is anticipated that at low temperatures only the lowest-lying Kramer’s doublet of NdIII will be populated. There- fore, assuming non-interacting spins, we compared the experi- mental data with the sum of the Brillouin functions calculated with an expected S=1/2 for WV and an effective spin of S= 1/2 for NdIII. The comparison gave an averaged gNd of 2.5, which is within the range typically observed for low-symmetry NdIII.[33,40] The experimental magnetization lies visibly above the Brillouin contribution, indicating the presence of Nd-W ferro- magnetic interactions. This feature is consistent with the abrupt increase in the cMT signal at low temperatures, and is also in good agreement with the ferromagnetic coupling re- ported in other CN-bridged NdIII-WV compounds.[33,36,40] At- tempted modeling of the magnetic properties of 2-(SS) and 2- (RR) was unsuccessful. This may be ascribed to the low symme- try of the NdIII centers and the large asymmetric NdIII 3WV 3 unit, both of which preclude simulation of the crystal field parame- ters of NdIII and calculation of the Nd-W coupling constant. No significant signal was observed in ac measurements, even with the addition of a dc field. This rules out the possibility of slow magnetic relaxation. The magnetic natures of 2-(SS) and 2-(RR) are identical, confirming the perfect isostructurality of these enantiomers. Magnetic properties of 3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS) The results of dc magnetic measurements on 3-(SRSR) and 3- (RSRS) are shown in Figure 13 and Figure S10. The cMT product of the GdIIIWV unit was measured as 8.2 Kcm3mol1 (SRSR and RSRS), which is in excellent agreement with the value of 8.3 ex- pected for the uncoupled GdIIIWV moiety, assuming SW=1/2, gW=2, SGd=7/2, and gGd=2. With decreasing temperature, the cMT product decreases slowly down to 50 K and then more sharply below this point, reaching a minimum of 7.4 Kcm3mol1 at 6.9 K for both enantiomers. On further cool- ing, the signal increases once more, to 8.9 and 9.0 Kcm3mol1 for 3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS), respectively (Figure 13a). The tem- Figure 12.

KGaA, Weinheim 7153 Full Paper perature dependence of cM 1 obeys the Curie–Weiss law in the range 50–300 K, giving Curie constants of C=8.2 Kcm3mol1 (SRSR and RSRS) and Weiss constants of q=0.57 (3-SRSR) and 0.60 K (3-RSRS). The small negative values of q indicate an antiferromagnetic nature of the interchain coupling. The minima in the cMT–T plots prove the presence of antiferromag- netic coupling between GdIII and WV. This is also supported by the field dependences of the magnetization at T=2 K and T= 4 K (Figure 13b). The M–H curves display a monotonic increase, and at a field of H=70 kOe attain values of 6.9 (T=2 K) and 6.8 Nb (T=4 K) for both 3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS). This saturation magnetization is close to the value of 6 Nb corresponding to GdIII-WV antiferromagnetic coupling, and much lower than the value of 8 Nb characteristic of the ferromagnetic alignment of spins. In ac magnetic measurements, neither 3-(SRSR) nor 3- (RSRS) showed any signal, which may be ascribed to low mag- netic anisotropy, thus precluding single-chain magnet behavior. Similarly to those of 1-(SS) and 1-(RR), the magnetic systems of 3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS) are composed of infinite chains, with the large 7/2 spins of GdIII connected with the small 1/2 spins of WV. Therefore, the same theoretical approach as used for 1- (SS) and 1-(RR) was also applied to simulate the magnetic properties of 3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS). The results are shown in Figure 13 and Figure S10. The 3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS) systems are simpler than 1-(SS/RR), as their crystal structures consist of only two-centered GdIIIWV units, giving rise to only one ex- change coupling constant, J. Seiden’s model was applied in the simultaneous fitting of cMT–T and M–H plots, in order to optimize the values of J and the G factor for GdIII. The best-fit curves were in good agreement with the experimental data, giving the parameters J=0.91(1) cm1 and G=1.96(3) for 3- (SRSR) and J=0.94(1) cm1 and G=1.99(2) for 3-(RSRS) (Figure 13). At the lowest temperatures, the calculated cMT values are slightly higher than the experimental values, sug- gesting the occurrence of additional weak antiferromagnetic interchain interactions. Calculation of the magnetic properties unequivocally proved that the GdIII-WV magnetic coupling in 3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS) is antiferromagnetic, leading to cyanido-bridged ferrimagnetic chains. The strength of the exchange coupling is very similar to that in 1-(SS/RR), which may be ascribed to the close similar- ity of the lengths of the cyanido bridges and the geometries of the LnIII and [WV(CN)8]3 complexes in all of these coordina- tion systems. The perfect isostructurality between 3-(SRSR) and 3-(RSRS) results in identical magnetic properties for both enan- tiomorphs. Magnetic properties of 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS) The T dependence of the cMT product and the field depend- ence of M for 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS) are presented in Figure 14. At room temperature, cMT for the NdIIIWV entity attains values of 1.6 and 1.5 Kcm3mol1 for 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS), respective- ly, which are lower than that of 2.0 Kcm3mol1 calculated for isolated WV (SW=1/2, gW=2) and NdIII (J=9/2, gJ=8/11). This can be attributed to crystal field effects leading to splitting of the 4I9/2 ground state of NdIII. On cooling, the cMT product mo- notonously decreases to a minimum value of 1.1 Kcm3mol1 at 11.0 K. At the lowest temperatures, the signal quickly increases to a level of 1.4 Kcm3mol1 at T=2 K (Figure 14a). Curie–Weiss fitting of the inverse magnetic susceptibility versus T curves gave Curie constants of C4-SRSR=C4-RSRS=1.6 Kcm3mol1, lower than the free-ion approximation value, and Weiss constants of q4-SRSR=17.9 K and q4-RSRS=18.8 K (Figure S11). The cMT(T) dependences arise from progressive depopulation of the Stark levels of the 4I9/2 state of NdIII. The sizeable value of q can again be attributed to crystal field effects rather than inter- chain coupling. The isothermal magnetization curves exhibit a monotonic in- crease with increasing field, and at a field of H=70 kOe attain values of 2.2 Nb at T=2 K and 2.0 Nb at T=4 K for both 4- (SRSR) and 4-(RSRS) (Figure 14b). These values are much lower than that of 4.3 Nb expected for isolated NdIII and WV. This may be ascribed to the fact that at very low temperatures only the lowest-lying Kramer’s doublet of NdIII is populated. Assuming this to be the case, we used non-interacting spins of WV (S= 1/2) and an effective spin of S=1/2 for NdIII to simulate the Brillouin function. This gave a powder-averaged gNd of 2.5, sim- ilar to the value found for 2-(SS/RR) and previously reported values for NdIII centers of low symmetry.[33,40] The experimental points for M are situated above the Brillouin curve, indicating the existence of ferromagnetic coupling in the NdIII-NC-WV link- ages. This interpretation is supported by the abrupt increase in cMT at low temperatures. The absence of a signal in ac meas- urements, even under an applied dc field, precludes slow mag- netic relaxation in 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS). Figure 13.

KGaA, Weinheim 7154 Full Paper The chains of 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS) consist of simple NdIIIWV units, which makes it possible to model the magnetization signal. The 4f3 configuration of NdIII results in a 4I9/2 ground state (gJ=8/11) with a non-vanishing contribution from orbital angular momentum. It is then necessary to consider the crystal field splitting effect within the framework of the extended op- erator equivalent approach, where the crystal field is described by the parameters Bk q (k=2,4,6; q=k,..,0,..,k).[54,55] Due to the low symmetry of NdIII, the number of essential crystal field pa- rameters is large. Thus, we applied a simplified approach with only one crystal field parameter of axial symmetry. Assuming a single coupling constant Kc, the Hamiltonian model can be expressed as [Eq. (2)]: ^H ¼ KC X N i¼1^sið^Ji þ ^Jiþ1Þ þ mB~H gJ X N i¼1^Ji þ g X N i¼1^si h i þD X N i¼1^J2 zi ð2Þ where periodic boundary conditions are assumed, that is, ^JNþ1  ^J1. The ^si operators denote the spins of WV, and ^Ji is the NdIII total angular momentum operator. The first term in Equa- tion (2) describes the exchange interaction, the second de- notes the Zeeman coupling with the external magnetic field, and the last is related to the axial crystal field anisotropy para- metrized by D.[56] Using this approach, it was possible to simu- late M–H curves at T=2 K and 4 K (Figure 14c), reflecting the fact that at low T only the lowest-lying levels are important, and that a single crystal-field parameter gives a good approxi- mation. The best-fit curves yielded Kc=1.8(2) cm1 and D= 0.045(1) cm1 for 4-(SRSR) and Kc=1.8(3) cm1 and D= 0.052(1) cm1 for 4-(RSRS). The constant Kc shows the coupling between the WV spin, ^si, and the NdIII momentum, ^Ji. The rela- tionships ^Li þ 2^Si ¼ gJ^Ji and ^Li þ ^Si ¼ ^Ji, where ~Li and ^Si denote the orbital and spin angular momenta of NdIII, imply that ^Si ¼ ðgJ  1Þ^Ji. There is a negative factor ðgJ  1Þ between Kc and the coupling constant ~KC and between the spin of NdIII, ^Si, and the spin of WV, ^si. This gives positive values of ~KC, confirm- ing a ferromagnetic exchange coupling. Both experimental and theoretical considerations prove that NdIII-WV exchange coupling in 4-(SRSR) and 4-(RSRS) is of a ferro- magnetic nature, leading to cyanido-bridged ferromagnetic chains. The same coupling was found for 2-(SS/RR), which can be ascribed to the same Nd-W distances and geometries in 2- (SS/RR) and 4-(SRSR/RSRS). The magnetic properties of both enantiomers are identical due to the perfect isostructurality be- tween these systems. Conclusion and Outlook We have reported a new class of multifunctional molecular ma- terials combining optical activity, luminescence, and magnetic coupling. We have explored the potential of bimetallic chains constructed from lanthanide(III) (NdIII and GdIII) complexes with Pybox derivatives and octacyanotungstate(V) ions, specifically {[LnIII(SS/RR-iPr-Pybox)(dmf)4]3[WV(CN)8]3}n·dmf·4H2O (Ln=Gd, 1- SS and 1-RR; Ln=Nd, 2-SS and 2-RR) and {[LnIII(SRSR/RSRS-Ind- Pybox)(dmf)4][WV(CN)8]}n·5MeCN·4MeOH (Ln=Gd, 3-SRSR and 3-RSRS; Ln=Nd, 4-SRSR and 4-RSRS). The chirality of iPr-Pybox and Ind-Pybox induced the formation of enantiopure helical structures, which are rather rare among heterobimetallic lan- thanide-based coordination polymers.[57–59] The chirality of the organic ligands is efficiently transferred to the metal centers, which extends the range of strong optical activity towards the visible region. GdIII-containing 1-(SS/RR) and 3-(SRSR/RSRS) dis- play strong red ligand-based phosphorescence, enhanced by a heavy-atom effect. The presence of NdIII in 2-(SS/RR) and 4- (SRSR/RSRS) results in an f-centered near-infrared emission, which is enhanced by efficient sensitization through ligand-to- metal energy transfer. Finally, the existence of cyanide bridging between the paramagnetic GdIII or NdIII and the WV centers leads to exchange magnetic coupling, which is of an antiferro- magnetic nature for the Gd-W compounds and a ferromagnetic nature for the NdW compounds. All of these features show that various functionalities can be introduced into bimetallic CN-bridged systems through judicious choice of the molecu- lar building blocks. Figure 14.

KGaA, Weinheim 7155 Full Paper The synthesized materials show great potential in the quest for more sophisticated magneto-optical effects. The chiral structures of all of the reported compounds, which break the spatial symmetry, together with the applied magnetic-field breaking of time-reversal symmetry, should give the physical cross-effect of magneto-chiral dichroism (MChD). As systems 1–4 display both strong absorption in the UV/Vis range and lu- minescence in the Vis-NIR region, these materials can display the MChD effect in both absorption and emission.[16,60] Addi- tionally, the observation of a nonlinear effect of the second harmonic generation (SHG) is also expected for the reported materials.[10] All of these possibilities are currently being investi- gated in our laboratories. Furthermore, we also plan to replace the GdIII and NdIII centers by highly anisotropic TbIII and DyIII, which may induce single-chain magnet (SCM) behavior in addi- tion to the chirality and luminescence characteristics.

Physical measurements IR spectra were recorded on a JASCO FTIR-4100 spectrometer in the range 4000–400 cm1 from samples pressed with KBr into transparent discs. Elemental analyses of Gd, Nd, and W were per- formed on an Agilent 7700 Series inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), while those of C, H, and N were determined by standard microanalytical methods. Thermogravimetric measure- ments were made on a Rigaku Thermo Plus TG8120 apparatus at a heating rate of 28Cmin1. UV/Vis/NIR diffuse-reflectance spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3100 spectrometer from powder samples mixed with barium sulfate. CD spectra were measured from powder samples dispersed in Nujol using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. UV/Vis/NIR emission and excitation spectra were measured on a Horiba Jobin–Yvon Fluorolog-3 (FL3–211) spectrofluorimeter (model TKN-7) with an Xe (450 W) lamp as exci- tation source. For the UV/Vis range (250–850 nm), a room tempera- ture R928P emission detector operating in photon-counting mode was used. For measurements in the NIR region (800–1550 nm), a liquid-nitrogen-cooled version of an InGaAs photodiode detector DSS-IGA020L was applied. The emission and excitation data were collected and analyzed using FluorEssence software. All measure- ments were performed at 77 K in a cryostat filled with liquid nitro- gen. It is important to note that the samples were sensitive to the UV light used as excitation source. During prolonged irradiation with strong UV light, the intensity of the whole emission spectrum gradually decreased, which can most probably be ascribed to UV- induced photoreactivity connected with the reduction of WV. This phenomenon has been observed for other luminescent systems based on lanthanide ions and octacyanidotungstate(V).[35] Magnetic measurements were carried out using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS-7) in the range 2–300 K. It was ensured that the magnetic properties of the crystals left in the mother solution and those of the dried powder samples were completely the same. Measure- ments from the dried powder samples are presented. The magnet- ic signals also proved to be reasonably stable after desolvation upon heating to 1308C (Figure S12). The magnetic susceptibility data were corrected for the diamagnetic contributions using Pascal constants.[62] Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies Single-crystal diffraction data of well-shaped crystals of 1-(SS), 1- (RR), 2-(SS), 2-(RR), 3-(SRSR), 3-(RSRS), 4-(SRSR), and 4-(RSRS) were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID imaging plate area detector using graphite-monochromated MoKa radiation.

The first indicated step in each compound corresponds to the remove of non-coordinated water, while the second step can be assigned to the loss of some dmf molecules (see Figure S2). S3 Figure S2 TGA curves (top) and their first derivative curves (middle) coupled with QMS analysis (bottom) for 1-(SS) (a) and 3-(SRSR) (b). The first step at 40 °C corresponds to the loss of water (QMS S4 peaks: m/z = 18, m/z = 17). The second step at 115 °C (1-SS) and 130 °C (3-SRSR) is related to the removal of dmf (QMS peak: m/z = 73, m/z = 58). The third step at 225 °C corresponds to the loss of further dmf molecules. Cyanides are removed at higher temperatures (QMS peaks: m/z = 27, m/z = 26).

Details concerning the calculations of magnetic properties for 1-(SS/RR) and 3-(SRSR/RSRS) 1-(SS/RR) and 3-(SRSR/RSRS) consists of an infinite chain of alternately connected GdIII and WV centers. While WV is treated as pure 1/2 spin center, lanthanide(III) ions usually demand to take into consideration the spin-orbit coupling effect. The orbital angular momentum of Gd3+ vanishes (ground state 8S7/2), leaving the total angular momentum equal to the spin angular momentum of 7/2. Therefore, the ligand field effects for Gd3+ can be neglected leading to a satisfactory and reliable approximation. A complication occurs in 1-(SS/RR) systems as the chains are built of large GdIII 3WV 3 units. No model exists which can take into account such a complicated structure involving in a generic case six different exchange coupling constants. Thus, we apply an approximated approach in which we treat all the in-chain exchange pathways as equivalent, thus assuming a single uniform averaged exchange coupling constant J. In the case of 3-(SRSR/RSRS), this approximation is not necessary as the chains are built of simple GdIIIWV dinuclear units. The hamiltonian for both cases reads: S16 where capital letters correspond to the spin of the GdIII ion and small letter denotes the 1/2 spin of the WV ion. G and g are the spectroscopic Landé factors of the corresponding spins. Such a spin alternating chain can be analysed using Seiden’s model, in which one of the spins is sufficiently large to be treated as a classical vector.[53] For a case of 1-(SS/RR) and 3-(SRSR/RSRS), GdIII spins of 7/2 are large enough to be analysed classically, while small WV spins of 1/2 are treated as quantum spins. In the method presented by Seiden, the closed formula for the zero-field susceptibility was derived in the course of the rigorous mathematical calculation. The final result can be written as follows: 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 ( 1) ( 1) 2(1 ) ( 2 ) 3 A B B N G S S g s s P G S P GSgsQ g s Q k T µ χ − ⎡ ⎤ = + + + + − − + ⎣ ⎦ where 2 1 3 1 3 1 1 (1 12 )sinh (5 12 )cosh 12 sinh cosh P γ γ γ γ γ γ γ γ γ γ γ − − − − − − − + − + − + = − + 2 1 2 1 1 (1 2 )cosh 2 sinh 2 sinh cosh Q γ γ γ γ γ γ γ γ γ − − − − − + − − = − + with γ = -JS/kBT. Unfortunately, such a rigorous result cannot be obtained for the field dependence of the magnetization. However, there is an approach developed by Verdaguer et al. which makes it possible to calculate magnetic properties in an approximate way.[S7] To this end first the quantum degrees of freedom associated with the 1/2 spins are summed over to yield the partition function: { } 1 Tr ( , 1) i N S i Z P i i = = + ∏ where 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 ( , 1) 2exp cosh 2 2 2 B zi i B B zi P i i G H J g H g HJ β µ µ µ ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ + = − + − ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥ ⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦ Σ Σ Σ , with Σi = Si + Si+1, where only the large spin variables appear. Now, the main concept developed consists in treating the remaining capital spin variables as quantum operators again and to calculate the trace over their corresponding (2S+1)N quantum states. The calculation can be performed using the technique of the transfer matrix T, so the partition function can be written as Z = Tr[TN], where 1 1 1 1 { , } , , , , , , , ( , 1) , i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i M m m m m m m M M m m M P i i M + + + + Σ ′ ′ ′ ′ = Σ Σ Σ + Σ ∑ T denotes eigenstates of operators Σi and Σzi, is the Clebsh-Gordan coefficient allowing the transformation from the to the representation, and the sum over Σi runs from to . In the thermodynamic limit (N → ∞) the partition function is dominated by the contribution from the S17 larges eigenvalue of the transfer matrix and the free energy of the chain can be obtained through the statistical relation . In the final step the magnetization of the chain can be calculated as appropriate derivative of the free energy F: . Apart from the Seiden’s model, it was possible to apply a phenomenological approach based on simple observations of χMT signal for ferrimagnetic chains.[S8] Two contributions are considered. Firstly, the divergence of χMT in the low temperature regime may be described by a power law variation aT-β in agreement with the findings for Heisenberg ferrimagnetic chains. For such chains β was shown to be close to 1. Secondly, the high temperature behaviour is calculated using an Arrhenius-like expression, giving as T → the value of the Curie constant, C. The resulting analytical form reads: The above expression contains four adjustable parameters a, b, J and β, and can give reliable insight into the magnitude of intrachain exchange coupling. The χMT – T plots for 1-(SS) and 1-(RR) were successfully simulated using this approach, and the best-fit curves are presented in Figure S5. The parameters found for 1-(SS) are: J = -0.79(1) cm-1, a = 25.03(1) K cm3 mol-1, b = 1.7(1), C = 24.26(4) K cm3 mol-1, β = 1.02(5), while for 1-(RR): J = -0.79(1) cm-1, a = 26.10(1) K cm3 mol-1, b = 1.90(9), C = 24.13(4) K cm3 mol-1, β = 0.97(4). The parameters found for 3-(SRSR) are: J = -1.07(1) cm-1, a = 9.07(2) K cm3 mol-1, b = 1.8(2), C = 8.25(1) K cm3 mol-1, β = 1.08(8), while for 3-(RSRS): J = -1.07(1) cm-1, a = 9.04(3) K cm3 mol-1, b = 1.6(2), C = 8.27(1) K cm3 mol-1, β = 1.1(1). The obtained coupling constants are slightly lower than the value corresponding to the Seiden’s model (for comparison, see the main text). However, the model can be said to give an accurate order of magnitude of the exchange coupling. Parameter β for both enantiomers attain the value very close to 1, as expected for ferrimagnetic chains. The value of Curie constant is also in a good agreement with the value found in the Curie-Weiss fit. S18 Figure S8.
