They display exactly the same framework structures, notwithstanding different substituents at the 10,20-meso-positions of the dipyridylporphyrin back- bones. Both substituents, –Cl for I and –CN for II, are com- pletely exposed to the open space of solvent-free I and II. Therefore, the two MOFs have the same framework struc- tures with distinct pore functionalities. Solvent-free I and II Introduction Current investigations of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) to explore new functional MOFs with unique properties aim to obtain well-defined crystalline porous ma- terials.[1] To achieve this goal, many attempts have been made to introduce new functional ligands in the frame- works of MOFs.[2] An attractive method is to chemically modify the reactive framework ligands incorporated into the MOF frameworks on demand.[3] Very recently, func- tional porphyrin-based linkers have also drawn attention, because they may have advantages over more commonly adopted rigid aromatic polycarboxylate-based linkers.[4] [a] Department of Chemistry and Protein Research Center for Bio-Industry Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Yongin 449-791, Republic of Korea E-mail: shuh@hufs.ac.kr https://sites.google.com/site/hufsnanolab [b] Department of Chemistry, Research Institute for Natural Science Korea University Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea E-mail: slee1@korea.ac.kr http://inmlab.korea.ac.kr [c] Department of Chemistry and Nano Science Ewha Womans University Seoul 120-750, Republic of Korea E-mail: ymeekim@ewha.ac.kr https://www.ewha.ac.kr Supporting information for this article is available on the WWW under http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejic.201500294. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2015, 2989–2995 © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2989 have solvent-accessible void volumes of 17.3 and 14.9%, respectively. The thermal properties of I and II are very sim- ilar, but the gas sorption properties strongly depend on the pore dimensions and functionalities. Compound I has a higher uptake of CO2 compared with that of II due to its larger void volume. Particularly, CO2 sorption isotherms at 196 K indicate dramatically different patterns depending on the meso-substituents. Whereas I shows S-shape isotherms for CO2 adsorption/desorption at 196 K, II does not. The sorption of N2, H2, and CH4 by the two MOFs was also inves- tigated. One of the most attractive advantages of porphyrin-based linkers is the fact that porphyrin itself can exhibit a wide range of physicochemical properties, which are very useful for diverse advanced applications that might otherwise be difficult to achieve. For instance, photophysically active porphyrin MOFs were easily prepared and found to be use- ful for several important applications including catalysis,[5] photosensitization,[6] photovoltaics,[7] and photodynamic therapy.[8] Additionally, Harris and co-workers successfully isolated and characterized biomimetic porphyrin MOF PCN-224, which contains a five-coordinate heme-O2 com- plex.[9] In addition to these examples, the physical dimensions of porphyrin-based linkers are usually larger than those of most rigid polycarboxylate-based linkers. As a result, stable mesoporous MOFs containing porphyrin linkers with suit- able metal ions were recently prepared by a simple method. Zhou and co-workers prepared and structurally charac- terized topologically interesting isoreticular ZrIV-based por- phyrin MOFs with mesoporosity, Zr6(OH)4O4(TCP-X)3 (TCP-1, PCN-228; TCP-2, PCN-229; TCP-3, PCN-230), where TCP-X are a series of tetracarboxylate porphyrin lin- kers.[10] Additionally, the combination of porphyrin linkers and ZrIV ions led to hydrolytically stable MOFs.[11] Pyridyl-based porphyrin ligands can also be used for the construction of porphyrin-based MOFs. Self-assembly of MII–TPyP units [TPyP = meso-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin] led to 3D networks presenting hexagonal channels[12–14] for www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER CoII, MnII, ZnII, and an unexpected 1D ribbon structure[15] for ZnII in CHCl3/MeOH solution. DPyDIP [5,15-di(4-pyr- idyl)-10,20-di(4-iodophenyl)porphyrin] was used to con- struct a robust 3D hexagonal framework by polymeric self- coordination in the presence of a ZnII ion.[16] Very recently, we reported a thermally very robust 3D Co-DpyDtolP MOF containing 5,15-di(4-pyridyl)-10,20- di(4-methylphenyl)porphyrin (DpyDtolP) with well-defined hexagonal pore symmetry and selective uptake of CO2 over N2.[17] The Co-DpyDtolP MOF, heat-treated under high vacuum at 250 °C, gave good diffraction data for X-ray crystallography. In the Co-DpyDtolP MOF, two 4-meth- ylphenyl groups at the meso-position are completely ex- posed to the micropores. The evacuated Co-DpyDtolP MOF could effectively encapsulate I2 in solution and form a 1D polyiodine molecular wire that is uniformly sur- rounded by the hydrophobic 4-methylphenyl groups. For further systematic investigation of the isostructural MOFs with different functionalities inside the micropores, we have prepared two new porphyrins containing 4-chloro- phenyl and 4-cyanophenyl groups instead of 4-methyl- phenyl at the 10- and 20-meso-positions of DpyDtolP: 5,15-di(4-pyridyl)-10,20-di(4-chlorophenyl)porphyrin (DpyDClP) and 5,15-di(4-pyridyl)-10,20-di(4-cyanophen- yl)porphyrin (DpyDCNP) (Scheme 1). Isostructural MOFs Co-DpyDClP and Co-DpyDCNP were successfully pre- pared and structurally characterized. Their gas sorption properties were systematically investigated by using N2, H2, CO2, and CH4 at varying temperatures. Scheme 1. Chemical structures of DpyDtolP, DpyDClP, and DpyDCNP. Different functional groups at 10,20-meso-positions are represented in blue. Results and Discussion The metallation of both DpyDClP and DpyDCNP with Co(NO3)2·6H2O in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) af- forded two new 3D porphyrin-based MOFs, [Co(DpyDClP)]6·18H2O (I) and [Co(DpyDCNP)]6·18H2O (II). These two new Co-porphyrin MOFs are isostructural with the previously reported Co-DpyDtolP MOF,[17] pos- sessing a hexagonally arranged micropore network, as shown in Figure 1 and described in Table 1. The unit cell dimensions of I and II are very similar, but they are a little bigger than those of the Co-DpyDtolP MOF with R3¯ space group, a = b = 32.6467(1) Å, c = 9.2525(4) Å, and V = 8540.2(5) Å3. Water molecules are present in the voids of I Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2015, 2989–2995 © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2990 and II, but they could not be refined because of disordering problems. The contents of solvate water molecules were therefore estimated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and elemental analysis of the as-prepared I and II. Figure 1. Structures of 3D I (a) and II (c) indicating hexagonally arranged micropores and formula units of I (b) and II (d) with atomic labeling schemes.

In the hexagonally arranged micropore networks of I and II, four pyrrole nitrogen atoms coordinate a cobalt ion, and both pyridyl nitrogen atoms also coordinate to the neigh- boring cobalt ions to form a distorted octahedral geometry around a cobalt ion (Figure 1). The porphyrin core contain- ing a CoII ion is planar, and the coordination sphere com- posed of four N atoms from the porphyrin core [Zn–Npyrrole distances of 1.990(2)–1.992(2) Å for I and 1.991(4)– 1.998(4) Å for II] and two pyridyl N atoms [Zn–Npy dis- tance of 2.319(1) Å for I and 2.312(1) Å for II] (Table 2). In addition, two coordinated pyridyl groups are tilted from the N4 porphyrin core ring with tilting angles of 86.6° for I and 86.44° for II; these tilting angles are less than that reported for the Co-DPyDtolP MOF.[17] The actual free radii of I and II are about 8.13 Å and 9.07 Å, respectively, which were estimated by measuring the distance between the channel center and one of the Cl atoms or N atoms in the six Cl or CN groups forming a hexamer and subtracting the van der Waals radii of Cl, 1.8 Å, or N, 1.5 Å (Figure S1). As-prepared I and II exhibited very similar thermal weight loss profiles, as shown in Figure 2. The samples completely lost their solvated water molecules at 408.2 and 489.8 °C, respectively. After the complete loss of solvated water, the solvent-free samples maintained their weight un- www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER Table 1. Crystallographic data for I and II.

TGA profiles of as-prepared I (a) and II (b) under a con- stant flow of nitrogen. til around 500 and 560 °C, respectively. We had previously observed that the thermal stability of the Co-DpyDtolP MOF was exceptionally high.[17] The isostructural I and II are similarly thermally stable. PLATON analysis[18] indi- cated that solvent-accessible void volumes of the solvent- free I and II were 17.3 and 14.9%, respectively. These vol- umes correspond to 1512.2 and 1284.9 Å3, respectively. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2015, 2989–2995 © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2991 The Connolly surfaces of solvent-free I and II are de- picted in Figure 3. It can be observed that I contains slightly more open space than II. Thus, I possesses a larger void volume than II. It is interesting to note that as-pre- pared II contained the same number of water solvate mo- lecules, despite its smaller void volume compared to I. Al- though we were not able to locate all solvate water mo- lecules in I and II, the same number of water molecules in the as-prepared II compared to those in I could be ac- counted for by the effective packing of water solvate mo- lecules in the CN-functionalized II. Figure 3. Connolly surfaces of solvent-free I (a) and II (b) along the c-axis with a probe radius of 1.0 Å. Gray and orange colors indicate the exterior and interior of the surfaces, respectively. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns for the bulk samples of I and II are compared to the simulated data from X-ray crystallography in Figure 4. The patterns of the as-prepared MOFs are in good agreement with the simulated patterns. Thus, the bulk samples are phase-pure. Like the Co-DpyDtolP MOF, I and II were found to be thermally very robust when they were heat-treated under vacuum at 200 °C. The PXRD patterns of I and II after heat treatment did not give any sign of changes in the framework. Therefore, the evacuated I and II maintain their original pore structure and functionalities. www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER Figure 4. The PXRD patterns of I (a) and II (b). On the basis of the Connolly surfaces shown in Figure 3, it is clear that both MOFs contain isostructural hexago- nally arranged cage-like micropore networks despite small discrepancies in their pore/window dimensions. The evacu- ated I and II are permanently microporous, as demon- strated by N2 gas sorption measurements shown in Fig- ure 5a. Both MOFs exhibit type I isotherms.[19] The cryo- genic N2 sorption analysis indicated that the respective Bru- nauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of the evacuated I and II are 329.8 and 249.9 m2g–1 and the corresponding pore volumes are 0.15 and 0.13 cm3g–1, respectively. Both I and II display slight hysteretic behavior between the ad- sorption and desorption branches, as depicted in Figure 5a. The cage-like pore structures with small window dimen- sions are responsible for the hysteretic N2 sorption.[20] The lower BET surface area and pore volume of II compared to I are in good agreement with the PLATON analysis re- sults. The determined micropore dimensions of I and II are 0.56 and 0.46 nm, respectively, based on the Horváth– Kawazoe method, as shown in Figure S2. Figure 5. The adsorption–desorption isotherms of I (blue dia- monds) and II (red circles) for N2 (a) and H2 (b) measured at 77 K. Solid and empty symbols represent the adsorption and desorption isotherms, respectively. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2015, 2989–2995 © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2992 The H2 sorption measurement at 77 K also indicated en- hanced H2 uptake by I (0.77 wt.-%) compared to II (0.52 wt.-%), as shown in Figure 5b. The hysteretic behavior be- tween adsorption and desorption for both MOFs are more pronounced for the N2 isotherms. The hysteretic behavior between adsorption and desorption isotherms can also be accounted for by the small window dimensions between the cage-like micropores. The H2 uptake level of I is not low when we consider its relatively low BET surface area com- pared with other MOFs.[21] The different adsorption amounts of both N2 and H2 for I and II can be mainly attributed to the difference in void spaces. CO2 sorption experiments were also performed to inves- tigate the uptake ability of the two MOFs. We had pre- viously observed very interesting CO2 sorption isotherms for the Co-DpyDtolP MOF.[17] There was a clear sudden increase of uptake around P ≈0.4 atm when the sorption measurement was conducted at 196 K. The CO2 uptake for the Co-DpyDtolP MOF was 142.8 cm3g–1 (6.37 mmol g–1). Among I and II, only I exhibited a very similar sorption pattern at the same temperature. The CO2 adsorption iso- therm for I exhibited a clear step of uptake around P ≈0.57 atm, as shown in Figure 6a. The uptake was 144.6 cm3g–1 (6.45 mmolg–1). Despite the similar range of sorption amount relative to that of the Co-DpyDtolP MOF, the sudden step appeared at a higher pressure than that for the Co-DpyDtolP MOF. This sudden step can be attributed to the large additional uptake of CO2 upon increase of CO2 pressure above a certain level due to the possible reorgani- zation of previously adsorbed CO2 molecules. In contrast, II showed a gradual increase of CO2 uptake without the sudden step up to 1 atm. The sorption amount (84.3 cm3g–1, 3.76 mmolg–1) was much smaller than those of both I and the Co-DpyDtolP MOF. Therefore, the iso- therm patterns, as well as the uptake amounts of CO2 among these isostructural MOFs, strongly depend on the BET surface areas, pore dimensions, and functionalities. Both I and II exhibited relatively low levels of CO2 uptake at 273 K, as depicted in Figure 6b. The respective sorption amounts measured at 273 K are 20.4 and 25.3 cm3g–1. The low surface coverage isosteric heats (Qst) of CO2 adsorption Figure 6. CO2 adsorption–desorption isotherms for I (blue dia- monds) and II (red circles) measured at 196 K (a) and 273 K (b). Solid and empty symbols represent the adsorption and desorption isotherms, respectively. www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER for I and II are 36.1 and 14.2 kJmol–1, respectively (Fig- ure S3). The much smaller negative value of isosteric heat of II as compared to that of I reflects the lower level of CO2 uptake for II at 196 K. It is noteworthy to mention that small differences in the BET surface areas and pore volumes of I and II result from the fact that different func- tionalities lead to dramatically different CO2 sorption be- havior at low temperature. The gas sorption isotherms for large nonpolar CH4 mo- lecules at 196 and 273 K are depicted in Figure 7. The up- take of CH4 by compounds I and II was 31.3 cm3g–1 (1.40 mmolg–1) and 26.6 cm3g–1 (1.19 mmolg–1), respec- tively, at 196 K. The large kinetic diameter of CH4 (3.80 Å) may lead to relatively lower CH4 sorption amounts com- pared to those of CO2, whose kinetic diameter is 3.30 Å.[22] The low surface coverage isosteric heats of CH4 adsorption for I and II are 34.6 and 47.5 kJmol–1, respectively (Fig- ure S4). It is noteworthy that II exhibited a higher value of negative isosteric heat for CH4 compared to I. The different trend of Qst values between CO2 sorption and CH4 sorption clearly suggests that both the available pore space and the functionality inside the micropore are important param- eters for gas sorption. Figure 7. CH4 adsorption–desorption isotherms for I (blue dia- mond) and II (red circle) measured at 196 K (a) and 273 K (b). Solid symbols and open symbols represent the adsorption and de- sorption isotherms, respectively. Based on these gas sorption measurements, we revealed that I, having –Cl meso-substituent with more void space, is generally a better sorbent material than II for N2, H2, CO2, and CH4 at low temperature. Additionally, only I ex- hibited pronounced sorption selectivity of CO2 over N2 and CH4. Conclusions Two new isostructural 3D Co–porphyrin MOFs, [Co(DpyDClP)]6·18H2O (I) and [Co(DpyDCNP)]6·18H2O (II), were prepared and structurally characterized. They ex- hibit exactly the same framework structure as that of the previously reported [Co(DpyDtolP)]6. These three MOFs have very similar cell dimensions. They possess well-defined hexagonally arranged micropores, and the pore dimensions and functionalities inside micropores can be varied system- Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2015, 2989–2995 © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2993 atically. The gas sorption properties of the two MOFs were investigated by using N2, H2, CO2, and CH4 at varying tem- peratures. Both I and II displayed different characteristic sorption behavior, especially for CO2 at 196 K. Overall, I exhibited larger gas uptake at low temperature compared to II, which possesses smaller void space. We envision that fur- ther systematic variations of pore functionalities in similar types of porphyrin-based MOFs are possible. Experimental Section Materials: meso-(4-Chlorophenyl)dipyrromethane, meso-(4-cyano- phenyl)dipyrromethane, 5,15-di(4-pyridyl)-10,20-di(4-chlorophen- yl)porphyrin (DpyDClP), and 5,15-di(4-pyridyl)-10,20-di(4-cyano- phenyl)porphyrin (DpyDCNP) were synthesized according to modified procedures outlined in the literature.[12] All other chemi- cals were obtained from commercial sources and used without fur- ther purification. All of the reactions and manipulations of the porphyrin building blocks were carried out under N2 with the use of standard inert-atmosphere and Schlenk techniques, unless other- wise noted. The solvents used in inert-atmosphere reactions were dried and degassed by using standard procedures. Flash column chromatography was carried out with 230–400 mesh silica gel from Sigma–Aldrich by using a wet-packing method. All deuterated sol- vents were purchased from the Cambridge Isotope Laboratory. Instrumentation: NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian AS400 (399.937 MHz for 1H and 100.573 MHz for 13C) spectrometer. The 1H chemical shifts are referenced to the proton resonance resulting from the protic residue in deuterated solvent, and the 13C chemical shifts are recorded downfield in ppm relative to the carbon reso- nance of the deuterated solvents. The absorbance and emission spectra were obtained with an Agilent UV/Vis/NIR spectropho- tometer by using quartz cells. The matrix-assisted laser-desorption- ionization time-of-flight mass spectra (MALDI-TOF) were ob- tained with a Bruker Daltonics LRF20 MALDI-TOF Mass Spec- trometer at the Industry–Academic Cooperation Foundation, Yon- sei University (Seoul, Korea). The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer by employing Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) (40 kV, 40 mA, step size = 0.02°). The TGA for the bulk MOF samples was carried out with a TGA Q5000 (TA Instruments) in- strument under a nitrogen atmosphere (ramping rate = 15 °C min–1). The cryogenic N2 adsorption–desorption analysis was per- formed with a Belsorp-miniII instrument (BEL Japan) at 77 K. The as-prepared MOFs were evacuated at 473 K for 3 h under high vacuum before the measurements were taken. The low-pressure CO2 sorption measurements were made with the same equipment at 196 K (2-propanol/dry ice bath) and 273 K (ice bath). The H2 sorption measurements were also made with the same equipment at 77 K. The adsorption–desorption isotherms of CH4 were mea- sured on the same equipment as well at 196 K and 273 K. The isosteric heats (Qst) of the CO2 and CH4 adsorptions were obtained by using the subroutine implemented in the BEL Master software of the Belsorp-miniII equipment. The subroutine uses the Clausius–Clapeyron equation to estimate the adsorption enthalpies from the adsorption data measured at 196 K and 273 K for CO2 and CH4. The infrared spectra were obtained by using KBr pellets with a Bomen MB-104 spectrometer. The elemental analysis was performed at the Organic Chemistry Research Center, Sogang Uni- versity (Seoul, Korea), with an EA1112 (CE Instruments, Italy).

[Co(DpyDCNP)]6·18H2O (II): This compound was prepared by using a method similar to that used for the preparation of I, except that DpyDCNP (0.067 g, 0.1 mmol) was used instead of DpyDClP. The purple crystalline needles were retrieved by filtration, washed with DMF, and dried in air for 1 d. The yield was 0.061 g (78%). The single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography were directly chosen from the as-prepared crystals. C44H30CoN8O3 (777.69): calcd. C 67.95, H 3.89, N 14.41; found C 66.63, H 3.42, N 12.81. X-ray Crystallography The X-ray diffraction data for I and II were collected with a Bruker SMART APEX diffractometer equipped with a monochromator in a Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) incident beam. Each crystal was mounted on a glass fiber. The CCD data were integrated and scaled by using the Bruker-SAINT software package, and the structure was solved and refined with SHELXTL V6.12.[23] All hydrogen atoms were placed in the calculated positions. The crystallographic data for I Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2015, 2989–2995 © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2994 and II are listed in Table 1. The selected bond lengths are listed in Table 2. CCDC-1030288 (for I) and 1030289 (for II) contain the supplemen- tary crystallographic data for this paper.
