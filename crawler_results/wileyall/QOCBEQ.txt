Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/chem.200701813 Multifunctional Fourfold Interpenetrating Diamondoid Network: Gas Separation and Fabrication of Palladium Nanoparticles Young Eun Cheon and Myunghyun Paik Suh*[a] Introduction Porous coordination polymers (PCPs) with well-defined channels or cavities have attracted much attention because of their potential applications as new materials in gas stor- age,[1–5] molecular adsorption and separation processes,[6–12] ion exchange,[13,14] and heterogeneous catalysis.[15–17] In par- ticular, redox-active porous coordination polymers are useful even though they are extremely rare, because they can oxidize or reduce certain substrates and include them in the PCPs.[9,18–20] Previously, we reported that coordination polymers incorporating NiII macrocyclic complexes pro- duced small (<5 nm) silver and gold nanoparticles when they were immersed in AgI and AuIII solutions, respectively, owing to the redox reactions between the NiII macrocyclic species incorporated in the coordination polymers and the metal ions.[18,19] Recently, we have been interested in fabrica- tion of palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) in PCPs. PdNPs may enhance the hydrogen storage capacity of porous coor- dination polymers[21] and catalyze organic reactions.[22] Fabri- cation of palladium nanoparticles (1.40.1 nm) in MOF-5, in which the [(h5-C5H5)PdACHTUNGTRENUNG(h3-C3H5)] complex was intro- duced to the MOF-5 and then reduced with H2 gas, has been reported.[23] Although the nature of the palladium was not characterized, palladium infiltration into MOF-5 by in- clusion of [PdACHTUNGTRENUNG(acac)2] followed by reduction with H2 gas has also been reported recently.[24] Here, we report a new fourfold interpenetrating 3D dia- mondoid network, [{[NiACHTUNGTRENUNG(cyclam)]2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(mtb)}n]·8nH2O·4nDMF (1) (MTB4=methanetetrabenzoate, DMF=dimethylform- ACHTUNGTRENUNGamide), which generates 1D channels. Solid 1 exhibits selec- tive gas sorption properties for H2, CO2, and O2 rather than N2 and CH4. We have fabricated palladium nanoparticles (2.00.6 nm) in the network at room temperature simply by immersion of 1 in the PdII solution without precursor compounds or reducing agents. Results and Discussion Preparation and X-ray structure of 1: Our design strategy was to build a 3D diamondoid network by using methanete- trabenzoate (MTB4) as a tetrahedral building block and a square-planar NiII macrocyclic complex as a linear linker (Scheme 1). Then, contrary to common coordination poly- mer frameworks, organic MTB4 units would be located at the nodes of the diamondoid network and the NiII macrocy- clic species would link them linearly. The self-assembly of Abstract: A fourfold interpenetrating diamondoid network, [{[NiACHTUNGTRENUNG(cyclam)]2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(mtb)}n]·8nH2O·4nDMF (1) (MTB= methanetetrabenzoate, DMF=dime- thylformamide), has been assembled from [NiACHTUNGTRENUNG(cyclam)]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ClO4]2 (cyclam= 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) and methanetetrabenzoic acid (H4MTB) in DMF/H2O (7:3, v/v) in the presence of triethylamine (TEA). Despite the high- fold interpenetration, 1 generates 1D channels that are occupied by water and DMF guest molecules. Solid 1, after removal of guest molecules, ex- hibits selective gas adsorption behavior for H2, CO2, and O2 rather than N2 and CH4, suggesting possible applications in gas separation technologies. In addi- tion, solid 1 can be applied in the fabri- cation of small Pd (2.00.6 nm) nano- particles without any extra reducing or capping agent because a NiII macrocy- clic species incorporated in 1 reduces PdII ions to Pd0 on immersion of 1 in the solution of PdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·2H2O in MeCN at room temperature.

Solid 1 is insoluble in common solvents such as H2O, MeOH, EtOH, MeCN, DMF, and di- methylsulfoxide. The X-ray structure of 1 (Figure 1) shows that each MTB4 binds four NiIIcyclam complexes in a tetrahedral fashion with an average core angle of 106.75(25)8, and each NiII ion is coordinated with two different MTB4 ligands at the axial sites to display octahedral coordination geometry, which gives rise to a diamondoid network. The adamanta- noid cages of the diamondoid network have edge C···C dis- tances of 17.1 L and maximum pore dimensions of 33.5 L (Figure 1a). Such large cavities induce fourfold interpenetra- tion of the network, whose interpenetration vector runs along the c axis (Figure 1b). Despite the fourfold interpene- tration, the structure generates 1D channels along the c axis. There are some examples in which open structures result de- spite the high-fold interpenetra- tion,[10,25] and they sometimes provide very robust porous sol- ids.[25a] The 1D channels are formed from repeated jar-like cavities that have a narrow en- trance (2.05M2.05 L) and a wider inside pocket (13.36M 13.36 L). The channels are filled with four DMF and eight water guest molecules per unit formula of the host, as evi- denced by the IR as well as the elemental analysis and ther- mal gravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) data. The void space in 1 is 31.6%, as estimat- ed by PLATON.[26] TGA of 1 reveals a weight loss in two steps, 9.4% at 808C and 21.9% at 1808C, which correspond to eight water molecules (calcd. 9.95%) and four DMF molecules (calcd. 20.2%), respectively, per formula unit (see the Supporting Information). The guest-free framework is thermally stable up to 3508C. The crystal structure is retained up to 1758C, as evidenced by the temperature-dependent X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns (see the Supporting Informa- tion). When the guest molecules of 1 were exchanged with EtOH and then heated at 608C under vacuum for 24 h, des- olvated solid 1’ resulted which had a very broad XRPD pat- tern. However, when 1’ was exposed to DMF/H2O vapor (10:0.7, v/v) at 388C for five days, the resolvated solid (1’’) was generated with the same XRPD pattern as 1. There are many frameworks that collapse upon removal of guest mole- cules, but restore the original structure on exposure to the vapor of the guest.[7,10,27] Selective gas sorption properties: Gas sorption was mea- sured for desolvated solid 1’ with N2, H2, O2, CH4, and CO2 gases. The samples for gas sorption experiments were pre- pared by exchange of the guest molecules of 1 with EtOH followed by removal of the EtOH. Solid 1’ does not adsorb N2 and CH4 gases. However, it adsorbs H2, CO2, and O2 gases to show Type I isotherms, characteristic of micropo- rous material (Figure 2a). The selective sorption of H2, CO2, and O2 rather than N2 and CH4 gases may be attributed to the smaller kinetic diameters of H2, CO2, and O2 than those of N2 and CH4 (H2, 2.8; CO2, 3.3; O2, 3.46; N2, 3.64; CH4, 3.8 L).[28] The selective sorption of CO2 rather than N2 gas can also be attributed to the significant quadrupole moment of CO2 (1.4M1039 Cm2), which induces specific interac- tions with the host framework.[29] Solid 1’ adsorbs H2 gas up to 0.7 wt.% at 77 K and 1 atm (78.75 cm3g1 at STP, 3.6 H2 molecules per formula unit). At 77 K and 40 bar, it adsorbs H2 gas up to 1.25 wt.% (Fig- Scheme 1. Design strategy for framework 1. Figure 1.

J. 2008, 14, 3961 – 3967 3962 ure 2b). This H2 adsorption capacity is much inferior to that of the MOF that we previously reported (1.9 wt.%[1a] and 2.87 wt.%[1c] at 77 K and 1 atm). Solid 1’ also adsorbs O2 gas up to 3.6 wt.% at 77 K and 0.19 atm (25.13 cm3g1 at STP, 1.1 O2 molecules per formula unit). Since the saturation vapor pressure of O2 is 147.8 torr at 77 K, we could not measure the O2 sorption at higher pressures than 0.19 atm. Solid 1’ adsorbs CO2 gas up to 11.2 wt.% (2.53 mmolg1, 56.78 cm3g1 at STP) at 195 K and 1 atm (Figure 2a). The BET surface area and pore volume, 141.2 m2g1 (Langmuir surface area 154.2 m2g1) and 0.055 cm3g1 respectively, were estimated from the CO2 sorption data because 1’ does not adsorb N2 gas. The gas sorption isotherms show hystere- sis between the adsorption–desorption curves, which must be attributed to the intercrystalline voids.[30,31] Although sorption capacities for H2, CO2, and O2 are not so great as those of other MOFs, the selective gas sorption behavior of 1’ suggests that the present solid can be applied in gas separation processes: for example, for the separation of N2 and O2 from air, a process currently performed on a scale of billions of tons per year in the US alone, as well as for the H2 enrichment of the N2/H2 exhaust mixture result- ing from ammonia synthesis. Fabrication of small palladium nanoparticles: The NiII aza- macrocyclic complex coordinating anionic ligands at the axial sites can be oxidized to NiIII species by the appropriate oxidizing agents.[32,33] Therefore, the coordination polymers that incorporate NiII macrocyclic species can be redox-active and react with certain metal ions. Previously we reported the reactions of redox-active coordination polymers incorpo- rating NiII macrocyclic species with AgI and AuIII ions to produce Ag0 and Au0 nanoparticles, respectively.[18,19] In this study, we tried the reaction of 1 with PdII ions. The standard reduction potential in water for PdII to Pd0 (+0.987 V versus SHE) is more positive than that (+0.799 V) of AgI to Ag0. When pale purple solid 1 was immersed in a solution of PdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·2H2O (1.0M102m) in MeCN at room temperature for 5 min, it turned yellow immediately. The high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image of the yellow solid showed the formation of Pd0 nanoparticles, di- ameter 2.00.6 nm (Figure 3). Even when the solid was im- mersed for 16 h, the size and shape of the nanoparticles did not change. Although the solution of PdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 in MeCN alone spontaneously produces nanoparticles, they have a wide size distribution (20–25 nm) and are much bigger than those produced from the reaction with 1 (see the Supporting Information). In general, the size, shape, and crystallinity of the nanoparticles depend on the concentration and counter- anions of the metal ions, the temperature, and the type of solvent.[34,35] To investigate these effects, our experiments were conducted under various conditions (PdII concentra- tion, 1.0M103–1.0M101m; counteranion, nitrate and ace- tate; temperature, room temperature to 828C; solvent, MeCN and acetone). The results (see the Supporting Infor- mation) indicated that these conditions did not affect the size of the nanoparticles significantly. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum (Figure 4) of the resulting solid shows anisotropic signals at g ? =2.175 and gk =2.016, which are indicative of the tetrag- onally distorted NiIII species,[18,19,32,33] and a peak at g=1.992 for Pd0 nanoparticles. The bulk metallic state of Pd0 is not EPR-active, but the small Pd0 particles show a broad con- Figure 2.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 3963 FULL PAPER A Nickle-Based Diamondoid Network duction electron paramagnetic resonance (CEPR).[36] When the metal particles are sufficiently small, a narrowing of the CEPR line results because the average electronic energy level spacing becomes greater than the Zeeman energy and the spin relaxation processes are quenched by quantum size effects.[36] The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1379 cm1 that corre- sponds to free NO3  anions. Since the host solid becomes positively charged because of the oxidation of NiII macrocy- clic species incorporated in the host solid to NiIII species, it includes NO3  as the counteranions. The elemental analysis data indicate that Pd2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(mtb) salt was formed and mixed with the nanocomposite, owing to the partial dissociation of 1 in the PdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 solution, as noted in the Experimental Sec- tion. The inductively coupled plasma (ICP) results and the elemental analysis data indicate that a stoichiometric amount (Pd0/NiIII=1:2) of palladium nanoparticles was formed from the reaction between NiII macrocyclic species of 1 and PdII ions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy-dis- persive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data indicate that PdII, Pd0, and NiIII coexist in the solid (Figure 4 and in the Sup- porting Information). In the XPS traces, the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks for NiIII appear at 855.7 and 873 eV, respectively, which are similar to the values previously reported.[18,19] The 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks of PdII appear at 337.6 and 342.7 eV and those of Pd0 appear at 336.2 and 341.5 eV. These values are coincident with the reported values for PdII (337.8 and 343.3 eV) and Pd0 (335.0 and 341.1 eV).[37] The peaks for PdII in XPS must be attributed to Pd2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(mtb) that is mixed with the Pd0 nanocomposite. When hydrogen gas was passed over the nanocomposite at room temperature for 1 h, the XPS lines of PdII moved to the lower binding energy regions (335.7 eV for 3d5/2, 341.1 eV for 3d3/2), indicating that Pd2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(mtb) was converted to Pd0. After the hydrogen gas was passed over them, the nanoparticles became bigger and the lattice fringes become more distinct in the HRTEM images (see the Supporting In- formation). The XRPD patterns (Figure 5) indicate that even after the formation of Pd0 nanoparticles, the peaks corresponding to the (001), (200), and (201) planes of 1 are retained al- though many peaks are significantly broadened. This means that the fourfold interpenetrating 3D diamondoid structure generating 1D channels is maintained even after the net- work oxidation, introduction of NO3  anions, and formation of Pd0 nanoparticles that are bigger than the channel aper- tures. We suggest the mechanism for the formation of the Pd0 nanoparticles is such that PdII ions are introduced to the 1D channels of 1 and react with the NiII species incorporat- Figure 4.

Previously, we reported that metal ions or complexes were included in the pores of the coordination polymers, and the host–guest bind- ing constants and amounts of included metal ions depended on the size and nature of the complexes.[6,38] We also re- vealed that the redox-active bilayer open framework reacted with I2 to produce a positively charged network that includ- ed I3  anions in the channels in a single-crystal to single- crystal manner.[9] These results support the proposition that PdII metal ions and NO3  ions included in the channels react with the host solid. The palladium peaks in these XRPD patterns are extremely weak, probably because the Pd0 par- ticles are too small and scarce compared with the host solid. Another research group also has reported that nanoparticles of Pd0 (1.4 nm), Cu0 (3–4 nm), and Au0 (5–20 nm) were pro- duced when metal precursor complexes were introduced to the 3D channels of MOF-5 with a pore size of 0.8 nm and then reduced with H2 gas. The XRPD patterns indicated that the MOF-5 framework was retained even after the for- mation of nanoparticles 2–25 times bigger than the channel apertures.[23] Host-free palladium nanocrystals capped with poly(N- vinyl-3-pyrrolidone) (PVP) were isolated by treatment of the Pd–host nanocomposite with H2SO4 (1.0M102m) in the presence of PVP. The HRTEM image of the isolated solid indicated that 15–20 nm Pd0 nanoparticles were formed (see the Supporting Information). The XRPD pattern (see the Supporting Information) exhibited intense peaks at 2q= 40.1, 46.7, 68.4, 82.2, and 86.98, which were similar to the re- ported values (40, 46, 68, 82, and 868) for the crystalline Pd0.[39] The palladium dimension, which was estimated by the Scherrer equation[40] from the peak width at 2q=40.18 (Figure 5), was approximately 15 nm, coincident with the size shown in the HRTEM images (see the Supporting In- formation). Increased hydrogen adsorption by palladium infiltration into MOF-5 has been reported recently, although the nature of palladium was not characterized.[24] In this case, the [Pd- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(acac)2] complex was included in MOF-5 followed by reduc- tion with H2 gas. By immersion of 1 in the solution of Pd in MeCN (1.6M103m, 8.5 mL) for 30 min, we loaded 1.0 wt.% of palladium nanoparticles into the host, and tested whether the PdNPs enhanced the H2 adsorption capacity of 1. How- ever, PdNPs(1.0 wt.%)@1 did not adsorb H2 gas, contrary to our expectation. This must be attributed to the inclusion of NO3  anions that block the free space of the host solid. Conclusion We have assembled a new fourfold interpenetrating dia- mondoid network, [{[NiACHTUNGTRENUNG(cyclam)]2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(mtb)}n]·8nH2O·4nDMF (1). Despite of the high-fold interpenetration, 1 generates 1D channels. The desolvated solid of 1 exhibits selective gas sorption properties for H2, CO2, and O2 rather than N2 and CH4 gases. These selective gas sorption properties can be applied to the separation of N2 and O2 from air as well as to H2 enrichment from the N2/H2 mixture resulting from am- monia synthesis. Solid 1 can be also applied in the fabrica- tion of small Pd nanoparticles (2.00.6 nm) at room tem- perature simply on immersion in a solution of PdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 in MeCN at room temperature. Further studies on the applica- tion of the present palladium nanocomposite solid are under way. Experimental Section General methods: All chemicals and solvents used in the syntheses were of reagent grade and were used without further purification.

To determine the effect of temperature, the experiments were also performed at 828C. To explore the effect of solvent, similar experiments were performed in a solution of Pd- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·2H2O in acetone (1.0M103m) at room temperature. To find the effect of the anion of the PdII salt, the experiments were also performed with PdACHTUNGTRENUNG(OAc)2 (1.0M102m) in THF and in toluene. The results are sum- marized in the Supporting Information. Preparation of host–free palladium nanoparticles: Solid 1 was immersed in a solution of PdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·2H2O in MeCN (1.0M102m, 10 mL) for 5 min, and then filtered. The nanocomposite solid (0.144 g) was refluxed for 2 h in EtOH/H2O (1:1, v/v, 10 mL) in the presence of PVP and H2SO4 (1 mL). The solution turned yellow as the host framework was dissociat- ed into the building blocks. PdACHTUNGTRENUNG(pvp) nanoparticles were precipitated by the addition of diethyl ether, and isolated by filtration. Low-pressure gas sorption studies: A measured amount of solid 1’ was in- troduced into a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 gas sorption apparatus, and then evacuated at 608C and 105 torr to remove all guest molecules. Gas sorption isotherms for N2, H2, and O2 were monitored at 77 K, and those for CO2 and CH4 were measured at 195 K at each equilibrium pressure by the static volumetric method. High-pressure gas sorption study: A measured amount of solid 1’ was in- troduced into a Rubotherm MSB (magnetic suspension balance) appara- tus, and then evacuated at 608C under vacuum to remove all guest mole- cules. The data were corrected for the buoyancy of the system, sample, and adsorbate. The sample density used in the buoyancy corrections was determined from He isotherm up to 100 bar at 298 K. The gas sorption isotherm for H2 was monitored at 77 K at equilibrium pressure up to 50 bar by the gravimetric method. X-ray crystallography: The diffraction data were collected at 100 K with synchrotron radiation (l=0.76000 L) on a 6BX Bruker Proteum 300 CCD detector with a platinum-coated double-crystal monochromator at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Pohang, Republic of Korea. The crystal was coated with Paraton oil to prevent loss of guest molecules. Proteum 2 (version 1.0.22)[43] was used for data collection, cell refine- ment, and reduction. The data were corrected for absorption. The crystal structure was solved by direct methods,[44] and refined by full-matrix least-squares refinement using the SHELXL-97 computer program.[45] The positions of all non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement factors. The hydrogen atoms were positioned geometrically and refined using a riding model. The density of the disordered guest molecule was flattened by using the SQUEEZE option of PLATON.[46] The crystallographic data and selected bond distances and angles are summarized in the Supporting Information, Tables S1 and S2.
