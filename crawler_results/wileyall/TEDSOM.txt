Two coordination polymers based on 1,6-bis(2-methyl-imid- azole-1-yl)-hexane (bimh), namely {[Zn3(BTC)2(bimh)]·(bimh)}n (1) and {[Zn(IPA)(bimh)]·(CH3CH2OH)0.5}n (2) (H3BTC = trimesic acid, H2IPA = isophthalic acid), were synthesized through hydrothermal re- actions. In compound 1, the zinc(II) ions are bridged by BTC3– ligands to form an undulating infinite two-dimensional (2D) polymeric net- work. The 3D networks of 1 show a twofold interpenetrating net. In Introduction The design and construction of coordination polymers (CPs) with flexible N-bridging ligands, especially bis(imidazole) li- gands has attracted much more attention. Modern coordination chemists have comprehensively developed and researched their intriguing structural topologies and various potential ma- terials applications, such as nonlinear optics, biological ac- tivity, catalysis, magnetism, sensors, and molecular recogni- tion.[1] The bis(imidazole) ligand with flexible nature of –CH2– spacers is a good representative of nitrogen-donor bridging ligands. The ligand is able to bend and rotate freely when coordinating to central metal atoms.[2] Generally, CPs with long flexible bis(imidazole) lead to interpenetrating struc- tures and helical modes.[3] Recently, significant work has been carried out by using dif- ferent metal ions assembly with flexible bis(imidazole) li- gands, a series of outstanding examples of which are (N-im) 2(CH2)n (n = 1–6).[4–12] Upon careful inspection of the reported cases, we found that when n = 6, the exploration of metal–bis(imidazole)–organic counterion (such as BTC3–, IPA2–) system is less devel- oped.[13–15] In our previous work, we reported the unusual three-dimensionnal fivefold interpenetrating microporous structure {[Cd(oba)(bib)]·2H2O}n [bib = 1,4-bis(2-methyl- * Prof. Dr. K.-F.

It tends to form strong coordination bonds to central metal atoms in the process of coordination and exhibits the ability to produce unique interwoven motifs and larger voids with the more flexible conformation. Scheme 1. Synthesis of bimh and compounds 1 and 2. In this paper, we chose the ligands bimh, trimesic acid (H3BTC), isophthalic acid (H2IPA) to react with zinc(II) under hydrothermal conditions and report herein the preparations, X- ray crystal structures, and photoluminescent spectra of two new zinc(II) coordination polymers {[Zn3(BTC)2(bimh)]· (bimh)}n (1) and {[Zn(IPA)(bimh)]·(CH3CH2OH)0.5}n (2). Results and Discussion Description of Crystal Structures Structural Analysis of {[Zn3(BTC)2(bimh)]·(bimh)}n (1) X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound 1 exhibits a twofold interpenetration structure with space group P21/n. In this structure, the bimh ligand adopts an anti–anti coordinating fashion, and the completely deprotonated BTC3– ligands dis- play a tri(monodentate) coordinating mode.

The Zn–O/N bond lengths are in the range of 1.9619–2.004 Å [Zn(1)–O(1) 1.9619(17) Å, Zn(1)–O(3) 1.9786(17) Å, Zn(1)– O(5) 1.9488(17) Å, Zn(1)–N(1) 2.004(2) Å] (Figure 1). The selected bond lengths and angles for 1 are listed in Table 1. As illustrated in Figure 2a, polymer 1 affords a 3-connected two- dimensional (2D) net, if the metal atoms and the BTC3– anion are viewed to be the 3-connected nodes, respectively. Further- more, the 2D frameworks are extended to (3,4)-connected three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular frameworks through Zn–N bonds between 2D nets and bimh molecules. Polymer 1 shows a 3D twofold interpenetrating net (Figure 2c). This compound exhibits void space, but the cavities are largely re- duced by guest bimh molecules and the mutual interpenetration of the networks (Figure 2d). Figure 1.

The selected bond lengths and angles for 2 are listed in Table 1. As shown in Figure 4a, the arrangement of zinc(II) and IPA2– gives the 1D helical chain of {Zn(IPA2–)}n, and such chains are further connected by bimh molecules via Zn–N coordina- tion bonds to form 2D frameworks as illustrated in Figure 4b. A better insight into the 2D frameworks can be accessed by topological methods. Each zinc(II) ion connects to three other zinc(II) ions by two IPA2– and two bimh spacers. Hence, it can be viewed as 3-connected nodes (Figure 4c). These 2D structures are further assembled into a 3D network through aromatic π–π stacking interactions between imidazolyl rings of bimh ligands (face to face distance: 3.525 Å) (Figure 4d). The resulting 3D network contains one-dimensional channels, and the effective free volume is only 7.3%, as calculated by PLATON.[17] Thermal Properties of Complexes 1 and 2 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that compound 1 is stable up to 362 °C, and subsequently begins to decom- pose. Compound 2 is stable up to 295 °C, a total weight loss of 4.7% occurred in the range 78–132 °C, corresponding to the removal of guest ethanol molecules (calcd. 4.6%), from 132 to 295 °C, the TGA curve of 2 passes through a flat area, and decomposition of organic components (Figure 5). Fluorescent Properties of Complexes 1 and 2 The solid-state photoluminescent spectra of 1 and 2 and the bimh ligand are depicted in Figure 6. An intense band in the emission spectra of 1 and 2 is observed at 408 nm (λex = 320 nm) and 474.8 nm (λex = 320 nm), respectively. Whereas the pure bimh ligand exhibits a fluorescent emission band at 440.2 nm (λex = 320 nm), the emission peak of 1 is blue- 15213749, 2012, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zaac.201100397 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

According to the litera- ture,[18,19] these emission bands can be assigned to the intrali- gand π–π* transition. In addition, the relatively efficient π–π interactions between imidazolyl rings of bimh ligands in 2 may be a reason for the red-shift of the emission peak in the spec- trum of the free ligand. The lifetime in 1 and 2 was monitored at room temperature upon excitation at 320 nm, all data were well fitted as shown in Figure 7. The lifetime at 408 nm emis- sion of 1 shows 1.34 ns (47.17%) / 3.93 ns (52.83%), χ2 = 1.149 and the lifetime at 474.8 nm emission of 2 shows 1.35 ns (31.80%) / 4.24 ns (68.20%), χ2 = 1.203. Additionally, in or- der to confirm the phase purity of compounds 1 and 2, the original samples were both characterized by X-ray powder dif- fraction (XRPD) at room temperature. The patterns simulated from the single-crystal X-ray data of 1 and 2 are in good agree- ment with those observed (Figure 8). www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z.

In com- pound 1, the zinc(II) ions are bridged by BTC3– ligands to form an undulating infinite two-dimensional (2D) polymeric network. Furthermore, the 2D frameworks are extended to 3D supramolecular frameworks through the Zn–N bonds between 2D nets and bimh molecules, showing a 3D twofold interpen- etrating net. In compound 2, the zinc(II) ions are bridged by IPA2– ligands to form one-dimensional (1D) helical structures, a left-handed and a right-handed helical chain, these chains are further connected by bimh via Zn–N coordination bonds to form 2D frameworks. The 2D structures are further assembled into 3D networks through aromatic π–π stacking interactions. Both compounds exhibit acceptable thermal stability and strong photoluminescence at room temperature.
