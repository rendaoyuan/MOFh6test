Molecular engineering has now reached a higher level of sophistication and has considerably matured, with rich knowledge on how to control the structures of materials. Self-assembly process- es involving metal ions have attracted increased attention in the fields of supramolecular chemistry[1] and crystal engi- neering,[2] especially from the viewpoint of the development of novel multifunctional materials. The essential feature of self-assembly is the use of modular building blocks that con- tain sufficient structural information to guide the assembly process. A metal ion bound by ligands contains a variety of structural information to guide the self-assembly reaction, and a number of interesting self-assembled systems have been reported in the past decade.[3] Research in the area of fabricating metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) continues to be intriguing by virtue of their unique topologies and tuna- ble properties.[4] Interest in MOF compounds is focused on catalysis,[5] molecule-based magnetic materials,[6] artificial nucleases for the hydrolytic cleavage of DNA and RNA,[7] contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging,[8] and fixa- tion media for atmospheric gases.[9] It is a great challenge to control framework structures due to the variability of many synthetic parameters. Attempts have been made to construct different topological frame- works by tuning the temperature and pH of the reaction medium. Cheetham et al. reported on the role of tempera- ture in the formation of the various cobalt succinate phases from a single reaction mixture.[10] Rao et al. successfully de- veloped a temperature-controlled progressive assembly of Zn oxalate and Ni succinate systems.[11a] In another study, Bu et al. developed a new temperature-dependent system based on camphorate.[11b] Recently, Yao et al. devised a new series of triazole-based frameworks, the members of which were obtained by varying the reaction temperature, solvent, and molar ratio.[12] A similar type of system has also been developed by Kitagawa et al. in relation to cobalt pyridine dicarboxylates.[13] Natarajan et al. studied the influences of time and temperature on the controlled synthesis of open frameworks.[14] Matsumoto et al. demonstrated an intercon- version between a monomer and an oligomer by varying the pH of the medium.[15] Besides, the variation of pH has proved critical in the preparations of various kinds of poly- oxometalate-based materials. Ozeki et al. produced different types of high-nuclear Mo-based aggregates by tuning the pH.[16] Cao et al. produced a new series of silver-based poly- oxometalates by regulating the pH of the medium.[17a] Abstract: The role of pH in the forma- tion of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been studied for a series of magnesium-based carboxylate framework systems. Our investigations have revealed the formation of five dif- ferent zero-dimensional (0D) to three- dimensional (3D) ordered frameworks from the same reaction mixture, merely by varying the pH of the medium. The compounds were synthe- sized by the hydrothermal method and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Increase of the pH of the medium led to abstraction of the imine hydrogen from the ligand and a con- comitant increase in the OH ion con- centration in the solution, facilitating the construction of higher dimensional framework compounds. A stepwise in- crease in pH resulted in a stepwise in- crease in the dimensionality of the net- work, ultimately leading to the forma- tion of a 3D porous solid. A gas ad- sorption study of the 3D framework compound confirmed its microporosity with a BET surface area of approxi- mately 450 m2g1. Notably, the 3D framework compound catalyzes aldol condensation reactions of various aro- matic aldehydes with acetone under heterogeneous conditions.

Chem. Eur. J. 2012, 18, 5979 – 5986  2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 5979 FULL PAPER Herein, we wish to report a new approach of pH-con- trolled synthesis of MOFs involving magnesium and pyra- zole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid (H3L), which allows a progressive increase of dimensionality from zero-dimensional to three- dimensional frameworks. The porous 3D compound has been found to efficiently catalyze aldol condensation reac- tions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of magnesium-based porous framework compounds capable of catalyzing aldol condensation reactions under heteroge- neous conditions. Results and Discussion Synthesis of the compounds: Heterocyclic carboxylate li- gands, with diverse dimensionalities, are very useful for pre- paring metal–organic frameworks. With much promise for versatility, the H3L ligand contains three different types of hydrogen atoms, that is to say, one N-heterocyclic hydrogen atom and two different types of carboxylate hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen of the carboxylate group adjacent to the imine group is more easily removed as the resulting anion forms a stable chelating complex with the metal center. The hydrogen atom attached to the imine nitrogen dissociates a little less readily than the carboxylate hydrogen atoms. Therefore, a slow increase in pH might facilitate stepwise deprotonation of the molecule to form the multi- dentate ligand and assist the construction of a higher dimen- sional framework in a controlled way. The multifunctional coordination sites of H3L and its capacity for deprotonation at different pH levels helps us to study the effect of pH on the formation of coordination networks. In this study, a sys- tematic approach has been made to progressively deproto- nate the pyrazole dicarboxylic acid molecule by varying the pH of the medium. By slowly changing the pH, we observed that the hydrogen atom of the N-heterocycle was dissociated at higher pH, and solids with a variety of frameworks were obtained under hydrothermal conditions. As the ligand pos- sesses multifunctional coordination sites involving both ni- trogen atoms and carboxylate oxygen atoms, it can exhibit various coordination modes in bridging metal ions (Scheme 1). X-ray structure of compound 1: Compound 1 is mononu- clear with one pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylate ligand and four coordinated water molecules around an MgII ion. An ORTEP diagram of compound 1 is shown in Figure S1 (see the Supporting Information). Selected bond distances are collated in Table 1 and the bond angles in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The central metal ion resides in a distorted octahedral geometry and the pyrazole-3,5-dicar- boxylate anion acts as a bidentate chelating ligand. The basal plane of the coordination geometry of 1 is generated by the bidentate pyrazolate carboxylate ligand (O1 and N1) and two water molecules (O8 and O9), while the apical po- sitions are occupied by two further water molecules (O6 and O7). The carboxylate ligand is also deprotonated, satisfying the charge of the metal center (Figure 1). Cheetham et al. have introduced a notation rule to categorize the inorganic and organic connectivities in framework structures.[17b] Ac- cording to this rule, compound 1 may be symbolized as type I0O0 (where I=inorganic and O=organic connectivity). The crystal packing in 1 is stabilized by intermolecular hy- drogen bonds (Table S2, see the Supporting Information).

X-ray structure of compound 2: Compound 2 is dinuclear, with two magnesium centers residing in distorted octahedral geometries. Selected bond distances are collated in Table 1 and the bond angles in Table S1 in the Supporting Informa- tion. An ORTEP diagram with the atom-numbering scheme is shown in Figure S2 (see the Supporting Information). The basal plane of the coordination geometry of compound 2 is formed by a chelating bidentate carboxylate ligand (N2 and O4) and one water molecule, while the O4 oxygen atom bridges two MgII centers in a m2-bridging mode and the re- maining two apical positions are occupied by water mole- cules (O1 and O3). In fact, the two magnesium-centered oc- tahedra in compound 2 share a common edge formed by O4 and its symmetry-related O4* atom (*=1x, 1y, 1z) (Figure 3). This compound can be symbolized as I0O0. The crystal packing in 2 is also stabilized by intermolecu- lar hydrogen bonds (Table S2 in the Supporting Informa- tion). In compound 2, the dimeric units are fused together by strong intermolecular O–H···O and O–H···N hydrogen bonds (O1–H6···O5, O3–H7···O5, O3–H8···O5 (x, y, z), N1– H2···O6 (x, 2y, z), O2–H5···O1 (x, y, z), and O2– H4···O6 (x, 2y, z)) to produce a 3D supramolecular ar- chitecture (Figure 4). X-ray structure of compound 3: Upon increasing the pH of the medium to 6, hydrothermal treatment of the reaction mixture afforded the one-dimensional ladder-type frame- work compound 3. Compound 3 crystallizes in the space group P21/c with Z=1. Selected bond distances are collated in Table 1 and the bond angles in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. An ORTEP diagram showing the atom-num- bering scheme is given in Figure S3 (see the Supporting In- formation). The asymmetric unit consists of one Mg1 center with distorted octahedral geometry. The basal plane is formed by the bidentate pyrazole carboxylate ligand (N2 and O6) and oxygen atoms from two other carboxylate li- gands (O3 and O6i, i=x, 1=2 +y, 1=2z). The apical posi- tions are occupied by the oxygen atoms of two water mole- cules (O4 and O5). One carboxylate group of the pyrazolate ligand participates in bonding, while the other remains as a free carboxylic acid. The carboxylato oxygen atom O6 bridges two Mg centers. The Mg centers are interconnected to form a ladder-type zig-zag 1D infinite chain that extends parallel to the crystallographic b axis (Figure 5). In the crys- tal packing, these chains are connected by hydrogen bond- ing mediated through the free carboxylic acid groups (O4– H7···O1ii, O5–H5···O2iii, O5–H4···O1iv, where, ii=x, 1=2y, Figure 1.

According to the connectivity, this compound can be classified as type I0O1. X-ray structure of compound 4: Upon adjusting the pH to neutral, a new kind of 2D framework compound crystallized in the space group P21/c with Z=8, along with one water molecule of crystallization, one free pyrazole dicarboxylate ligand, and one methanol molecule. An ORTEP diagram showing the atom-numbering scheme is given in Figure S4 (see the Supporting Information). There are four magnesi- um centers, Mg1, Mg2, Mg3, and Mg4, each of which has a distorted octahedral geometry. The Mg1/Mg4 pair and Mg2/Mg3 pair possess identical coordination environments. The basal planes of Mg1 and Mg4 are formed by bidentate chelating carboxylate ligands (N6, O19 and N5, O20, respec- tively) and two m2-bridging oxygen atoms (O13 and O14). The apical positions of the octahedra around Mg1 and Mg4 are occupied by water molecules (O7, O8 and O11, O12). The Mg1 and Mg4 centers are connected by doubly bridg- ing (m2-) oxygen atoms (O19 and O20). Similarly, the basal planes of Mg2 and Mg3 are formed by bidentate chelating carboxylate ligands (N4, O14 and N3, O13, respectively) and two further carboxylate ligands (O15, O21 and O16, O22, respectively), while the axial coordination sites are oc- cupied by the oxygen atoms of two water molecules (O9, O10 and O5, O6, respectively). The octahedra surrounding Mg1 and Mg4 share an edge, while the octahedra surround- ing Mg1 and Mg2 as well as Mg3 and Mg4 share corners. Extension of this moiety ultimately forms a two-dimensional structure (Figure 6). The uncoordinated carboxylic acid li- gands and solvent molecules are entrapped within the layer of the two-dimensional network by hydrogen bonding and non-bonding attraction. According to Cheetham et al., the compound is two-dimensional in terms of the organic con- nectivity and therefore it can be classified as type I0O2.[17b] X-ray structure of compound 5: When the pH of the reac- tion mixture was adjusted to the basic range (pH8), a new kind of 3D open framework compound crystallized in the space group P43212 with Z=4, with one water molecule of crystallization. The structure of 5, with three magnesium centers in the asymmetric unit, is completely different from those of 1–4. All of the magnesium centers possess distorted octahedral geometry. A secondary building unit of 5 is the Mg3 triad. An ORTEP diagram of compound 5 is shown in Figure S5 (see the Supporting Information). The basal plane of the Mg1 center is formed by three carboxylate oxygen atoms (O3, O4, and O4i) and one m3-hydroxo oxygen atom (O5), while the axial positions are occupied by one carbox- ylate oxygen atom and one m3-hydroxo oxygen atom (O3ii and O5iii, respectively) (where i=2x, 2y, 1=2 +z, ii=x, y, z, and iii=1=2 +x, 3=2y, 1=4z). The basal plane of the Mg2 center is formed by a bidentate chelating carboxylate ligand (N2 and O2), one carboxylate oxygen atom, and one m3-hydroxo oxygen atom (O2iv and O3, iv=1=2 +x, 3=2y, 3=4z), while the apical positions are occupied by one car- boxylate oxygen atom (O1) and one m3-hydroxo oxygen atom (O3). The basal plane of the Mg3 center is formed by two bidentate bridging carboxylate ligands (N1, N1v, O5, O5v), while the axial positions are occupied by two water molecules (O6 and O6v) (v=2x, 2y, 1=2 +z). The octa- hedra surrounding the Mg2 centers share edges to afford a 1D helical chain, while the octahedra surrounding the Mg1 centers share their corners with two adjacent Mg2 cen- ters. The Mg3 centers share an edge with the Mg1 centers, and the Mg3 centers are again bonded with the Mg2 centers to form the 3D open framework (Figure 7). The water mole- cules of crystallization entrapped in the pores of the open framework generate a hydrogen-bonded 1D helical chain (O7–H1···O7), which is tightly held in these pores by strong hydrogen bonding O6–H6···O7vi (vi= 3=2x, 1=2 +y, 1=4 +z) (Figure 8) (Table S2). According to the connectivity, this compound can be symbolized as I0O3. Figure 6. Polyhedral representation of compound 4, showing the propaga- tion in 2D parallel to the crystallographic ab plane. Figure 7. Polyhedral representation of compound 5, showing the construc- tion of the Mg3 triad secondary building unit and a 1D helical chain formed by the edge sharing of Mg2 centers. www.chemeurj.org  2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The MgO bond distances in compounds 1–5 are in the usual range and are consistent with the literature value.[18] It was of interest to determine whether the low-dimensional compounds were intermediates of the framework structures. To ascertain this, we subjected the low-dimensional com- pounds to hydrothermal treatment, maintaining the required pH of the medium for the respective high-dimensional com- pounds. Interestingly, the monomer could be converted into the dimer and 1D compounds by following the above proce- dure, while the dimer was converted to the 1D compound. However, upward conversion stopped at the 1D structure. No upward conversion, other than up to 1D, is possible from the monomer, dimer, or 1D and 2D compounds. Thermal analysis of compound 5: Thermogravimetric analy- sis confirmed that compound 5 was thermally stable up to approximately 808C (see the Supporting Information; Fig- ure S6). The TG curve indicates that 5 starts to lose water molecules at about 808C and that dehydration is complete at around 1708C. The TG curve shows a small break at ap- proximately 1408C. The mass loss of approximately 5.5% in the range 80–1408C corresponds to the loss of one molecule of water. Subsequently, in the temperature range 140– 1708C, the rather sharp mass loss of approximately 10.9% corresponds to the loss of two coordinated water molecules. The corresponding DTA curve shows two endothermic peaks at approximately 110 and 1608C. Nitrogen sorption study of compound 5: Nitrogen sorption measurements were undertaken to verify the porous nature of compound 5 as well as to calculate the surface area of the framework. Prior to the sorption experiments, samples were degassed at 708C for 3 h under vacuum (103 Torr). The weight loss measured after degassing the sample was ap- proximately 5.4%, which corresponds to the loss of one water molecule of crystallization. The BET (Brunauer– Emmett–Teller)[19] surface area of 5 was calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherm. The adsorption–desorption iso- therm of 5 is shown in Figure 9. The adsorption of N2 fol- lows a type II isotherm, and indicates a surface area (SBET) of 450 m2g1. This corroborates the information obtained from X-ray crystallographic analysis as regards the micropo- rous nature of the compound. Catalytic aldol condensation reactions: Environmentally friendly heterogeneous catalytic processes are attracting in- creasing attention in the chemical industry. The identifica- tion of highly active solid Brønsted-type basic catalysts ca- pable of performing CC bond formation remains a chal- lenge. The main drawbacks of using NaOH or KOH as ho- mogeneous catalysts are separation difficulties, corrosion problems in the equipment, and the generation of large amounts of waste. To overcome these disadvantages, several efforts have been made to prepare new catalytic systems with controlled basic properties in order to increase the effi- ciency of the process. Among various magnesium com- pounds that are used as mediators or catalysts for several or- ganic reactions,[20] magnesium oxide is a versatile catalyst for carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions.[21] Magnesium oxide nanoparticles have also been studied for their efficacy in catalyzing aldol condensation reactions.[22] Magnesium car- boxylate compounds have attracted little attention with re- spect to CC bond-formation reactions due to their limited synthetic accessibility and hygroscopic nature.[23] Recycling of catalysts is a task of great economic and environmental benefit in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, hence heterogeneous catalysis is advantageous. We report here the catalytic activity of compound 5 in aldol condensation reac- tions in heterogeneous media (Scheme 2). The catalytic reactions were performed with a large excess of acetone to prevent self-condensation and to ensure effective use of the aldehyde.[24] During the catalytic reaction, the temperature of the reaction medium was main- tained in the range 5–108C. With increasing reaction tem- perature, benzylideneacetone (condensed product) was ob- tained from the b-aldol. The results of the aldol condensa- tion reactions are shown in Table 2. Nitro-substituted ben- zaldehydes were converted into their respective b-aldol Figure 8. 1D helical chains formed by the water molecules of crystalliza- tion present in the pores of the 3D open framework of 5. Figure 9. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of compound 5 at 77 K. Chem. Eur. J. 2012, 18, 5979 – 5986  2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 5983 FULL PAPER pH-Dependent Assembly of Metal–Organic Frameworks products as the sole products within 6 h. With benzaldehyde and p-methoxybenzaldehyde, however, trans-benzylidenea- cetone was obtained without formation of the b-aldol prod- uct. No conversion was observed in the absence of the cata- lyst. The catalytic reaction did not occur in the absence of a base. The yield of the b-aldol product decreased in the se- quence p->o->m-nitrobenzaldehyde. A nitro substituent at the ortho or para position may give rise to both a negative inductive effect and a negative mesomeric effect, increasing the electrophilicity of the C=O groups of these nitrobenzaldehydes, whereas substitution at the meta position affords only the negative induc- tive effect. Comparing p-nitrobenzaldehyde and o- nitrobenzaldehyde, more steric crowding at the ortho position may lead to lower conversion for this isomer. The presence of an electron-donating group on the ring, such as methoxy, decreases the conver- sion as trans-benzylideneacetone products are formed by dehydration of the b-aldol. To verify that the catalysis was indeed heteroge- neous, we performed a hot filtration test. The solid catalyst was filtered off when the catalytic reaction was 30–40% complete and the liquid phase of the reaction mixture was kept under the reaction conditions for a further 8 h. Analysis of the products of the catalytic reaction con- firmed that there was no further increase in the contents. No reaction occurred in the absence of the solid catalyst. This result suggests that there was no leaching of Mg from the solid catalyst during the reactions. To check the stability of the catalyst, we characterized the recovered material. After completion of a catalytic reaction, the solid catalyst was recovered by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with tetrahydrofuran, and dried. The recovered catalyst was then subjected to X-ray powder diffraction analysis and IR spectral analysis. Comparison of the IR spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns of the pristine com- pound and recovered catalyst convincingly demonstrates that the structural integrity of the compound was retained after the aldol condensation reaction (see the Supporting In- formation; Figures S7 and S8). Furthermore, the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the dehydrated species of 5 was also measured at 708C (Figure S9; see the Supporting Information). Compound 5 was kept at 708C for 3 h prior to X-ray measurement to ensure complete dehydration of the sample. Comparison of the X-ray diffraction patterns of {[Mg3(L)(OH)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2]·H2O}n (5) and the dehydrated spe- cies indicates that the framework structure of the compound remained unaltered after dehydration. Upon exposure to a humid atmosphere (relative humidity 90%), the dehy- drated species absorbs water and reverts to its original hy- drated form. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the rehy- drated species and compound 5 were in good agreement. For the recycling study, an aldol condensation reaction was performed with p-methoxybenzaldehyde and p-nitro- benzaldehyde. After the first cycle of reaction, the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation and then washed as de- scribed above. The recovered catalyst was dried under vacuum overnight. The performance of the recycled catalyst in CC coupling reactions over three successive runs is sum- marized in Table 3. The catalytic efficacy of the recovered catalyst remained almost the same in each run. An advantage of our system is that the catalyst is not air- or moisture-sensitive; hence, there is no need to carry out the reaction under an inert atmosphere. The catalyst could be easily prepared from magnesium nitrate, was easily re- Scheme 2. Catalytic aldol condensation. Table 2.

The reactants were converted into their respective products in high yield and with greater selectivity in a short time by virtue of the high surface area of the catalyst. Compounds 1 and 2 also cata- lyze aldol condensation reactions between aromatic alde- hydes and acetone in tetrahydrofuran under homogeneous conditions. The results of aldol condensation reactions using compounds 1 and 2 are given in Table S3 (see the Support- ing Information). In contrast, compounds 3 and 4 do not cat- alyze the aldol condensation reaction. Conclusion We have successfully developed a new series of MOF sys- tems, among which we tactically increased the dimensionali- ty from 0D to 3D merely by tuning the pH of the medium. The pH of the medium plays a vital role in the construction of framework materials of the desired dimensionality. The porous three-dimensional compound {[Mg3(L)(OH)3- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2]·H2O}n displays excellent catalytic activity in aldol condensation reactions of various aromatic aldehydes, giving remarkable yields with high selectivities within short reac- tion times under heterogeneous conditions. Notably, the cat- alyst can be recycled and reused several times without any loss of activity. Experimental Section Materials and physical measurements: Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid, sodium azide, and substituted benzalde- hydes were purchased from Aldrich and were used as received. Other chemicals were purchased from Merck (India). Benzaldehyde, acetone, and tetrahydrofuran were distilled before use. Benzaldehyde was kept over NaA molecular sieves to trap possible traces of benzoic acid. Ele- mental analysis was performed on a Perkin–Elmer 240C elemental ana- lyzer. Fourier-transform infrared spectra of samples in KBr pellets were measured on a Perkin–Elmer RX I FTIR spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded with a Scintag XDS-2000 diffractometer using CuKa radiation. TG/DT analyses were performed on a Perkin–Elmer (Singapore) Pyris Diamond TG/DTA unit. The heating rate was programmed at 58Cmin1 with a protecting stream of N2 flowing at a rate of 150 mLmin1. N2 sorption measurements were performed on an Autosorb iQ (Quantachrome Inc., USA) gas sorption system at 77 K. Samples were degassed at 708C for 3 h under vacuum (103 Torr) prior to nitrogen sorption measurements. Synthesis of the compounds: All of the compounds were synthesized by the hydrothermal route. The compounds were obtained as colorless block-shaped crystals after heating in a Teflon-lined Parr acid digestion bomb at 1708C for 3 days followed by slow cooling at a rate of 58Ch1 to room temperature. The initial reaction mixture was prepared by mixing magnesium nitrate and pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid in a 2:1 ratio in water. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted by changing the molar proportion of the weak base sodium azide. The pH of the medium was thereby adjusted to 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 to obtain monomer, dimer, 1D, 2D, and 3D framework compounds, respectively. The bulk compounds were characterized by elemental analysis and IR spectroscopic studies.

X-ray crystallography: X-ray diffraction data for 1–5 were collected at 293(2) K on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD X-ray diffractometer using graphite-monochromated MoKa radiation (l=0.71073 ). Integrated in- tensities were determined and the cell was refined with the SAINT[25] software package using a narrow-frame integration algorithm. An empiri- cal absorption correction[26] (SADABS) was applied. All of the structures were solved by direct methods and refined against F2 using full-matrix least-squares techniques with anisotropic displacement parameters for non-hydrogen atoms with the programs SHELXS97 and SHELXL97.[27] Data for compound 2 were not of good quality and there was some disor- der in the positions the water oxygen atoms, so the hydrogen atoms of the water of crystallization were not included in the refinement for this compound. For the other compounds, hydrogen atoms were placed in cal- culated positions using suitable riding models with isotropic displacement parameters derived from their carrier atoms. There were no remarkable peaks in the final difference Fourier maps, except for ghost peaks sur- rounding the metal centers in each of the compounds. A summary of crystal data and relevant refinement parameters for complexes 1–5 is given in Table S4 (see the Supporting Information). CCDC-821016 (1), CCDC-821017 (2), CCDC-795755 (3), CCDC-821018 (4), and CCDC- 795756 (5) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. Catalytic reactions: The catalytic reactions were carried out in a glass batch reactor according to the following procedure. Acetone (580 mg, 10 mmol), triethylamine (2 mmol), tetrahydrofuran (2 mL), and catalyst (5 mg) were placed in a round-bottomed flask. The flask was then placed in an ice-bath, maintaining the temperature at 5–108C. The requisite al- dehyde (2 mmol) was then added to the solution and the reaction mix- ture was stirred for 6 h. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated by filtration and the product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (60–120 mesh) eluting with n-hexane/ethyl acetate. The product was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, and the data were compared with those of authentic samples.

All solvents used were analytical grade and were used as received from Merck India Pvt. Ltd. Benzaldehyde, acetone and tetrahydrofuran was distilled before use. Benzaldehyde was kept over NaA molecular sieves to trap possible traces of benzoic acid. All reactions were carried out in air, without any special precautions. Column chromatography was performed over silica gel (mesh 60-120) and hexane/ethyl acetate combination was used as the eluent. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature in CDCl3 with tetramethylsilane as internal standard. The chemical shifts (d) and coupling constants (J) were expressed in ppm and Hz, respectively on Bruker Avance 300 instrument. Gas chromatography was performed to identify and quantify the products of the reaction by a Varian CP-3800 Gas Chromatograph using a CP-Sil 8 CB capillary column. Elemental analysis of the products was performed by using Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer.
