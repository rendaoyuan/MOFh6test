Romero*[a] Keywords: Magnetic properties / Heterometallic complexes / N ligands / Copper / Iron Control of the Cu2+ ion coordination environment affords a 1D, magnetically diluted compound, [Cu(cis-chxn)2]3- [Fe(CN)6]2·7H2O (1) and the 2D ferromagnetic material [Cu(cis-chxn)]3[Fe(CN)6]2·6H2O (2) with a critical temper- ature, Tc, of 3.5 K. Introduction The search for bimetallic cyanide systems based on Prus- sian blue has given rise to a rich and well-documented fam- ily of molecule-based magnets. Most of these systems are obtained from the assembly of unsaturated cations of the [MII(L)n]2 type (where M  Ni[19] or Cu;[1,918] L  po- lydentate ligand) and hexacyanometallate anions: [MII(CN)6]4 or [MIII(CN)6]3 (where MII  FeII; MIII  FeIII, MnIII, CoIII, or CrIII). The choice of the polydentate ligand, the metal ion and its number of free coordination sites in the cationic unit endow us with potential control over the dimensionality and magnetic properties of these systems. Ni2 ions invariably present six-coordination, whereas d9 Cu2 ions are stereochemically more versatile and can be either tetra-, penta- or hexacoordinate. There- fore, the use of [Cu(L)n]2 building blocks should enable the preparation of new compounds with novel structures and perhaps improved magnetic properties. However, not very many examples of these have been reported to date. Only two of such copper-containing compounds, [Cu(Et- OH)2][Cu(en)]2[Cr(CN)6]2 (en  1,2-diaminoethane)[15] and [Cu(tn)]3[Cr(CN)6]2·3H2O (tn  1,3-diaminopropane),[18] have been structurally characterised and exhibit spon- taneous magnetisation, with critical temperatures, Tc, of 57 K and 9.5 K, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, no CuIIFeIII cyanide-bridged compounds showing mag- netic ordering have been reported so far, as most of the CuIIFe bimetallic systems are indeed formed by diamag- netic hexacyanoferrate(II) units. By stoichiometric control of the copper-coordination environment, allowing either axial or equatorial coordination of the hexacyanometallate [a] Institut de Cie`ncia Molecular, Universitat de Vale`ncia, Dr. Moliner 50, 46100 Burjassot, Spain Fax: (internat.)  34-963544859 E-mail: fmrm@uv.es Eur.

Herein we report their syntheses, structural characterizations and magnetic properties. Results and Discussion Compound 1 crystallises in the centrosymmetric P1¯ space group. A view of the crystal structure along the a axis (see Figure 1) shows the existence of Cu(1)NC Fe(1)CNCu(2) zigzag chains running along the [011] di- rection and composed of alternating trans-[Cu(cis-chxn)2]2 cations and [Fe(CN)6]3 anions. The latter exhibit an octa- hedral environment and bind axially to the copper ions in a µ2-mode. The Cu(1) and Cu(2) atoms of the cationic unit show centrosymmetric, elongated, octahedral geometries due to JahnTeller effects, with long axial CuN distances as compared to those of equatorial ligands [Cu(1)N(ax): 2.818(3) A˚ ; Cu(1)N(eq): 1.995(3) A˚ and 2.027(2) A˚ ; Cu(2)N(ax): 2.676(3) A˚ ; Cu(2)N(eq): 1.996(3) A˚ and 2.017(2) A˚ ]. CuNC angles within the chain deviate greatly form linearity, with values ranging between 120.8° and 109.4°. Similar values have been reported for other cop- per-containing compounds.[4,1214,17,18] Isolated from the chain, square planar [Cu(cis-chxn)2]2 cations compensate the charge of the polymer. The shortest Cu(3)N[Fe(1)] distances is 3.123(3) A˚ . Seven water molecules of crystallis- ation are present in the structure per formula unit. Four of them [O(1) and O(2)] are hydrogen-bonded to each other and to terminal cyanide groups belonging to adjacent chains, leading to a two-dimensional network. The thermal variation of the χmT product for 1 is shown in Figure 2. At room temperature χmT equals 2.42 emu·K·mol1. This value differs from the spin-only value E. Coronado, C. Gime´nez-Saiz, A. Nuez, V. Sa´nchez, F. M. Romero SHORT COMMUNICATION Figure 1. View of the crystal molecular structure of 1 along the a axis; dashed and dotted lines refer to hydrogen bonds of 1.875 emu·K·mol1 calculated for uncorrelated spins, owing to the orbital contribution in low-spin FeIII com- plexes. Spin-orbit coupling accounts for the smooth de- crease in χmT observed on cooling. Below 4 K, χmT de- creases on lowering the temperature, indicating the exist- ence of weak intermolecular magnetic interactions. Figure 2. Temperature dependence of the χT product for 1 Compound 2 also crystallises in the P1¯ space group. It presents a structure similar to that reported previously for compound [Cu(tn)]2[Fe(CN)6]·KCl·5H2O[18] (see Figure 3). The binding of [Cu(cis-chxn)]2 cations and [Fe(CN)6]3 anions yields a two-dimensional [Cu(cis-chxn)]2[Fe(CN)6] monocationic assembly made up of defective cubane units. The structure can also be viewed as a hexagonal close pack- ing of copper ions, in which the iron atoms occupy the octa- hedral sites (CdCl2-type layered structure). Thus, every [Fe(CN)6]3 moiety links to six copper atoms in a µ6-mode, whereas each copper ion presents a square-based pyramidal geometry and links to three iron units. Two cyanide ligands and a bidentate cis-chxn ligand bind to the equatorial posi- tions of the square-based pyramids and the apical sites are occupied by the third bridging CN anion (see Table 1). One cis-chxn ligand is disordered over two positions in the coordination sphere of the Cu(3) metal centre. CuNC 2003 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 42894293 4290 angles are close to linear; the values range between 163.9° and 177.3°. Fe(2) ions occupy an inversion centre in the structure. A view along the b axis (see Figure 3) shows all iron atoms lying in the same ab plane and all copper atoms, as well as bulky cyclohexane rings, lying on both sides of this central plane. A very long interlayer Cu···Cu separation of 12.290 A˚ results. It should be noted that the presence of isolated [Fe(CN)6]3 anions between the layers ensures electroneutrality and yields an overall two-component material. The value of the χmT product of 2 at room temperature (2.32 emu·K·mol1) is slightly higher than the spin-only value and accounts for the orbital contribution of the low- spin iron() ions. A continuous decrease of χmT is observed on cooling (see Figure 4), as expected from the spin-orbit coupling of the iron sites. Below 15 K, χmT increases shar- ply, pointing to the onset of long-range ferromagnetic order. The first magnetisation curve performed at 2 K reaches a value of 4.69 µB at 5 T, close to the one expected for com- plete saturation. AC susceptibility measurements performed between 2 and 5 K show the appearance of an out-of-phase signal below the critical temperature, Tc  3.5 K (Figure 4, inset). The frequency dependence of this signal appears to be a common feature in bimetallic magnets based on chxn ligands.[7,8] Finally, the magnetic order was confirmed by specific-heat measurements. The typical metamagnetic be- haviour reported for several bimetallic cyanide systems was not observed in our case, a result that is attributed to the large interplanar distance induced by the presence of the bulky chxn ligands.[1,8] Conclusion Simple molecular orbital considerations predict the ob- servation of ferromagnetic interactions between hexacyano- ferrate(III) anions (t2g5 electronic configuration) and cop- per() ions (t2g6 eg3) in octahedral geometry. Surprisingly, this type of interaction has rarely been observed in such bimetallic systems and there is no previously reported ex- ample of a CuIIFeIII cyano-bridged magnet, despite the fact that several two-dimensional structures have been de- Magnetic Properties in Copper(II) Cyano-Bridged Bimetallic Complexes SHORT COMMUNICATION Figure 3. Crystal structure of 2: (top) projection of the 2D monoc- ationic network showing the defective cubane units (cyclohexane rings have been omitted for clarity); (bottom) view along the b axis of the interlayer arrangement and the isolated hexacyanoferrat- e(III) anions scribed. It can be anticipated that the use of [Cu(L)2]2 pre- cursors (where L  diamine) in the synthesis of Cu3Fe2 bimetallic complexes compels axial coordination of the cy- anide ligands. In fact, the soft, stronger diamine ligands are expected to occupy the equatorial positions of the Cu2 coordination sphere. Due to the JahnTeller effect, long intrachain Cu···N(Fe) distances result and a magnetic be- haviour of quasi-isolated spins is observed. As shown here, compound 1, obtained from the [Cu(cis-chxn)2]2 precursor (either prepared in situ or isolated), follows exactly the same behaviour. These occurrences are overcome by the use of [Cu(cis-chxn)]2 building blocks, enabling cyanide-bridging ligands to bind to the equatorial positions in the CuII coor- dination environment. Shorter Cu···N(Fe) distances and higher dimensionality are achieved in this coordination Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 42894293 www.eurjic.org 2003 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is also interesting to compare the quasi-linear Cu···Fe bridges of 2 with the extremely bent angles ob- served in 1. This is expected to enhance the ferromagnetic components of the magnetic interactions for the former compound. All these features allow the observation of long- range magnetic ordering, despite the poor energy match be- tween the orbitals of the different metal centres. Indeed, compound 2 is the only CuIIFeIII cyano-bridged ferro- magnet reported to date. In addition, it exhibits a two-com- ponent structure comprising ferromagnetic layers and para- magnetic ferricyanide anions located in between. Experi- ments in progress (Mössbauer and single-crystal EPR) may provide information about the magnetic environment of the different sites present in the structure. Experimental Section General Remarks: Compounds Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Panreac), K3[Fe(CN)6] (Fluka) and cis-chxn (Fluka) were of reagent grade and used without further purification. E. Coronado, C.

Romero SHORT COMMUNICATION [Cu(cis-chxn)2(NO3)2]: This precursor was prepared by a method similar to that reported previously for the trans-chxn analogue.[19] A solution of cis-chxn (228 mg, 2 mmol) in methanol (5 mL) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (242 mg, 1 mmol) in the same amount of methanol. The violet precipitate was filtered off, washed with methanol and air-dried. C12H28CuN6O6 (415.94): calcd. C 34.65, H 6.79, N 20.2; found C 34.60, H 7.08, N 20.91.

Slow diffusion of this solution and an aqueous solution of K3[Fe(CN)6] (66 mg, 0.2 mmol) produced brown crystals of the title compound. Complex 1 was also obtained by slow diffusion of [Cu(cis-chxn)2(NO3)2] (125 mg, 0.3 mmol) and K3[Fe(CN)6] (66 mg, 0.2 mmol) in water. C48H98Cu3Fe2N24O7 (1425.80): calcd.

Magnetic Measurements: Variable-temperature susceptibility meas- urements were carried out on polycrystalline samples in the 2300 K temperature range at magnetic fields of 1 T (1) and 0.1 T (2) using a magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS-XL-5) equipped with a SQUID sensor. Diamagnetic contributions were corrected with Pascal’s constants. Isothermal magnetization meas- urements at 2 K were carried out up to 5 T by using the same equipment. X-ray Crystallographic Study: X-ray diffraction data of 1 and 2 were collected at room temperature with a NoniusKappaCCD diffractometer using a graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation source (λ  0.71073 A˚ ). Denzo and Scalepack[20] programs were used for cell refinements and data reduction. The structures were Table 2.

The structure refinements were carried out with SHELX-97.[23] All non-hydrogen atoms were re- fined anisotropically. Multiscan absorption corrections, based on equivalent reflections, were applied to the data using the program SORTAV.[24] Crystallographic data are summarized in Table 2. For 1, three independent H2O solvent molecules were found in the asymmetric unit and were well behaved. The sample, however, showed the presence of further disordered water molecules. Calcu- lations with PLATON[25] indicated a solvent-accessible void centred around the inversion point (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) with an area of 73 A˚ 3. There was some indication of electron density at this site. The presumed solvent was heavily disordered and no realistic atomic model could be satisfactorily refined. Therefore, the SQUEEZE procedure of Spek and van der Sluis[26] was used to accommodate this extra density. A total of 20 electrons per unit cell were recovered and they fit quite well with one water molecule. This extra H2O molecule was added to the final formula of 1. H atoms of water molecules were found in difference maps and re- fined positionally with geometric restraints (OH  0.82 A˚ , NH  0.90 A˚ and H···H  1.35 A˚ ) and with Uiso(H)  1.2Ueq(O). The remaining H atoms were placed in calculated posi- tions and refined with a riding model, with CH  0.97 A˚ , NH  0.90 A˚ and Uiso(H)  1.2Ueq(C, N). In compound 2, one of the three independent cyclohexanediamine ligands [coordinating to Cu(3)] shows a positional disorder over two sets of sites having refined occupancies of 0.668 and 0.332. This disorder only affects three atoms of the ligand: N(11), C(28) and C(29). H atoms on O(1 W), O(2 W), O(3 W) and N atoms were found in difference maps and refined positionally with geometric restraints as described previously. The H atoms on atoms O(4 W), O(5 W) and O(6 W) could not be found clearly in difference maps. For both compounds, six low-angle reflections were omitted from the final cycles of refinement because the observed intensities were much lower than the calculated values, as a result of being partially obscured by the beam stop.
