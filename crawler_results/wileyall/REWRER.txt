Manuscript FULL PAPER DOI: 10.1002/ejic.200600743 Two- and Three-Dimensional Coordination Polymers From the Reaction of Bis- and Tris(2-aminoethyl)amine with Titanium and Zirconium Alkoxides Helmut Fric,[a] Michael Puchberger,[a] and Ulrich Schubert*[a] Dedicated to Professor Bernhard Kräutler on the occasion of his 60th birthday Keywords: Titanium / Zirconium / Coordination polymers / N ligands The reaction of bis(2-aminoethyl)amine with M(OiPr)4 (M = Ti, Zr) affords the chain-like coordination polymers [M2(OiPr)8- (H2NCH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2)], where only the NH2 groups of the amine are coordinated to the M2(OiPr)8 units. 2D NMR spectroscopy shows that the adducts dissociate into the starting compounds when dissolved in CD2Cl2 but are slowly re-formed in solution over a period of two weeks. Puckered layers of condensed six-membered rings of [Ti2(OiPr)8]3[N(CH2CH2NH2)3]2 are formed when [Ti(OiPr)4] Introduction An understanding of the Lewis acidity of metal alkoxides is the key for understanding their chemistry, for example in sol–gel processes or as catalysts. One consequence of the acidic properties of the metal center in these alkoxides is their tendency to form oligomers [M(OR)x]n with alkoxido bridges between two or three metal atoms, i.e. by interac- tion of the Lewis basic alkoxido groups with the Lewis acidic metal centers. The physical properties as well as the chemical reactivity of the metal alkoxides are influenced by the degree of aggregation. In alcoholic solution, for in- stance, addition of solvent molecules to the metal center competes with the formation of alkoxido bridges. The sta- bility of the adducts increases for given alkoxido groups with increasing Lewis basicity of the alcohol, increasing Lewis acidity of the metal atom, and increasing coordina- tion number of the metal. Thus, the adducts [M2(OiPr)8- (iPrOH)2] (M = Ce,[1,2] Zr,[2] Hf[2,3]) can be isolated, whereas the analogous adducts [Ti2(OR)8(ROH)2] are only stable when the Lewis acidity of the metal is raised by more elec- tronegative substituents.[4–6] The metal atoms in the dimeric adducts [M2(OR)8(ROH)2] are octahedrally coordinated owing to both the formation of alkoxido bridges and the coordination of alcohol molecules (Scheme 1, LH = ROH). The coordinated alcohol is stabilized by hydrogen bonding with the neighboring alkoxido ligand.

In contrast, chains of [Zr2(OiPr)8- (H2NCH2CH2NRCH2CH2NH2)]{R=CH2CH2NH2[Zr2(OiPr)8- (HOiPr)]} are formed upon treatment of tris(2-aminoethyl)- amine with [Zr(OiPr)4]. (© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2007) Scheme 1. General structure of the adducts [Ti2(OR)8(LH)2] (LH = ROH or RNH2; --- represents hydrogen bonds) and polymeric [Ti2(OR)8(NH2XNH2)]. The stability of the adducts can also be increased by stronger Lewis bases. We recently succeeded in crystallizing a number of amine adducts [M2(OR)8(NH2R)2] (M = Ti, Zr) when M(OR)4 was treated with the corresponding pri- mary amines.[7,8] These amine adducts (Scheme 1, LH = RNH2) have similar structures to the alcohol adducts [M2(OR)8(ROH)2], including the hydrogen bond between the amino group and the adjacent OR ligand. However, comparison of the adducts of different amines showed that Two- and Three-Dimensional Ti and Zr Coordination Polymers FULL PAPER the Lewis basicity of the amine nitrogen is not the decisive parameter for the stability of the adducts. Instead, the strength of the NH···O hydrogen bond appears to be the main parameter. Any electronic or steric effect weakening the hydrogen bond thus weakens the stability of the ad- ducts. The general structure of [Ti2(OiPr)8(NH2R)2] was ex- tended to insoluble coordination polymers with the chain structures shown in Scheme 1 when [Ti(OR)4] was treated with diamines H2NXNH2 (X = hydrocarbon spacer).[7–9] An open question of previous work was whether the ob- served structures are retained in solution and whether coor- dination equilibria exist, because the obtained 15N NMR spectra were rather inconclusive. The use of NH(CH2CH2NH2)2 and N(CH2CH2NH2)3 has now al- lowed us to answer this question. This is discussed in this paper, together with the interesting structural chemistry of the corresponding adducts. Results and Discussion Solid-State Structures When bis(2-aminoethyl)amine was treated with an equi- molar amount, or a slight excess, of [Ti(OiPr)4] in 2-propa- nol or [Zr(OiPr)4] in heptane, the compounds [M2(OiPr)8- (H2NCH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2)] (1: M = Ti; 2: M = Zr) were obtained in high yield. Although the starting amine contains three basic nitrogen atoms, only the two primary amino groups were found by X-ray structure analysis to coordinate to the metal alkoxide moieties. As a result, chain-like coordination polymers are formed (Figures 1 and Figure 1. The chain structure of [Ti2(OiPr)8- (H2NCH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2)] (1). The dotted lines represent NH···O hydrogen bonds.

We have observed previously that secondary amines are less prone to coordinate to M(OR)4 and have attributed this finding to the less pronounced ability of secondary amines to engage in the hydrogen bonding that stabilizes the M–N interaction.[8] Although the NH group in 1 and 2 does not interact with the metal alkoxides, it is probably responsible for the much better solubility of 1 and 2 compared to re- lated coordination polymers with hydrocarbon spacers X. As will be discussed later, this fact allows us to investigate the solution structures by NMR spectroscopy. Apart from different conformations of the bis(2-amino- ethyl)amine units, the polymeric structures of 1 and 2 follow the same construction principle. The amine is a two-direc- tional linker for the M2(OiPr)8 units, i.e. each NH2 group of bis(2-aminoethyl)amine is coordinated to another M2- (OiPr)8 unit. The chains are close-packed, with an inter- chain distance of about 870 pm in 1 and 910 pm in 2 The metal alkoxide units are centrosymmetric dimers of the general composition M2(OR)8(NH2R)2 in which the oc- tahedrally coordinated metal atoms are bridged by two OR groups. The amines are coordinated axially to the M2(µ- OR)2 ring and hydrogen-bonded to neighboring alkoxido ligands (see Scheme 1 and Figures 1 and 2). The N···O sep- arations [293.7(3) and 294.1(3) pm for 1; 308.8(5) and 315.2(5) pm for 2] are in the typical range of NH···O hydro- gen bonds.[10] To enable hydrogen bonding, the M–M–N angles are reduced to 76–78° by bending of the amino li- gand towards the center of the M2(µ-OR)2 ring. The M–O distances trans to the amine ligand are in between the (long) M–O distances of the bridging OR groups and the (short) M–O distances of the equatorial terminal OR groups. H. Fric, M. Puchberger, U. Schubert FULL PAPER When [Ti(OiPr)4] was treated with 0.67 molar equivalents oftris(2-aminoethyl)amine,colorlesscrystalsof[{Ti2(OiPr)8}3- {N(CH2CH2NH2)3}2·Ti2(OiPr)8] (3) were obtained after recrystallization from CH2Cl2. All NH2 groups of tris(2- aminoethyl)amine coordinate to Ti2(OiPr)8 units. The crys- tal structure of 3 is thus a two-dimensional coordination polymer with N(CH2CH2NH2)3 as a three-directional linker and the Ti2(OR)8 units as two-directional connectors. The framework of 3 is formally related to that of black phosphorus, i.e. the framework of 3 is a puckered layer of condensed six-membered, centrosymmetric rings (Figures 3 and 4) with CH2CH2NH2[Ti2(OiPr)8]NH2CH2CH2 edges and pyramidal nitrogen atoms as the corners.

Furthermore, the Ti–N distances in 3 [230.5(4)– 231.9(5) pm] are the same as in molecular or chain-like complexes with mono- or diamines. The [Ti2(OiPr)8]3[N(CH2CH2NH2)3]2 network structure contains a large free volume due to the very large ring size (about 1.4 nm in diameter). In the crystals obtained in the reaction of [Ti(OiPr)4] with N(CH2CH2NH2)3, the voids in the center of the rings are filled with Ti2(OiPr)8 guest mole- cules, which do not undergo any bonding interaction with the host structure.

The structure of the entrapped titanium alk- oxide dimers can be described as two trigonal bipyramids sharing a common axial–equatorial edge. Related structures of dimeric, nonsolvated titanium alkoxides with five-coordi- nate titanium atoms are known for bulky OR groups, such as [Ti2(OCH2tBu)8],[11] [Ti2(OiPr)6(OAr)2] (Ar = 2,4,6- Me3C6H2[12] or 2,6-iPr2C6H3[13]) and [Ti2(OiPr)4{OCH- (CF3)2}4].[4] The crystal structure of 3 thus contains two structurally different Ti2(OiPr)8 moieties: the guest mole- cules with five-coordinate titanium atoms and the Ti2- (OiPr)8 units with six-coordinate titanium atoms being part of the framework structure. Framework structures such as 3 have not yet been observed in the chemistry of transition metal alkoxides. It may be speculated that other guests could be incorporated in the same way into the host struc- ture of [Ti2(OiPr)8]3[N(CH2CH2NH2)3]2. The analogous reaction of [Zr(OiPr)4] with tris(2-amino- ethyl)amine resulted in a compound with different composi- tion and crystal structure. The structure of the obtained complex [Zr2(OiPr)8][Zr2(OiPr)8(HOiPr)][(H2NCH2CH2)3- N] (4) can be formally derived from the layer structure of 3 by decoordinating one NH2 group per N(CH2CH2NH2)3 and replacing it with an 2-propanol molecule. This results in a chain structure of the type Zr2(OiPr)8(H2NCH2CH2- NRCH2CH2NH2), where R is a CH2CH2NH2[Zr2(OiPr)8- (HOiPr)] moiety (Figure 5). Formation of a layered struc- ture is thus inhibited because one coordination site at one zirconium is blocked by an alcohol molecule. As mentioned in the Introduction, alcohol adducts of [Zr(OiPr)4] are stable while those of [Ti(OiPr)4] are not; this allows the alcohol to compete with the amine for coordination. It is interesting to note at this point that reaction of M(OiPr)4 Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2007, 376–383 © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 379 with benzylamine results in the same structure [M2(OiPr)8- (NH2CH2Ph)2] for both Ti and Zr.[8] The bond lengths and angles of the zirconium atoms in 4 coordinated to NH2 groups are basically the same as those in 2, while those of the sixth zirconium atom, to which an 2-propanol molecule is coordinated, are very similar to those in [Zr2(OiPr)8- (iPrOH)2], including the hydrogen bond between the coor- dinated alcohol and the adjacent OiPr ligand.[2] NMR Investigations in Solution The coordination polymers 1–4 described above can be recrystallized, which is a strong indication that the amine adducts are relatively stable and may persist in solution. Nevertheless, coordination equilibria may exist upon dissol- ution of the compounds. This is not simply an academic question but is also important for the use of metal alkoxides in sol–gel processes, where coordination polymers may offer the possibility to pre-organize metal alkoxides prior to hy- drolytic polycondensation. A section of the 1H NMR spectrum of the dissolved crys- tals of 1 is reproduced at the top of Figure 6. The 1H/13C HSQC spectrum shows one correlation at δ = 4.51 (1H) and 76.5 ppm (13C) for a CH unit of the time-averaged isoprop- oxide ligands and two correlations at δ = 2.84 (1H)/ 52.8 ppm (13C) and 2.54 (1H)/42.2 ppm (13C) corresponding to the two CH2 units of the amine ligand. The latter two signals are very similar to the signals of the free ligand at δ = 2.57/2.68 ppm (1H) and 41.7/57.7 ppm (13C), respectively. The 1H/15N HMBC spectrum of 1 (Figure 7, left) shows two correlations at δ = 9.1 (NH) and –3.2 ppm (NH2), which are almost the same as the shifts for the uncoordi- H. Fric, M. Puchberger, U. Schubert FULL PAPER nated ligand (δ = 9.1 and –2.3 ppm). The two protons of the NH2 groups appear as a broad signal at δ = 1.09 ppm. This indicates that most of the amine ligand is not coordi- nated to the metal center. Figure 6. 1H NMR spectra of [Ti2(OiPr)8- (NH2CH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2)] (1) in CD2Cl2. Top: immediately after dissolving the crystals; center: after one week; bottom: after two weeks. Figure 7. 1H/15N HMBC spectrum of 1 in CD2Cl2. Left: immedi- ately after dissolving the crystals; right: after two weeks. This picture changed completely when NMR spectra of the same solution were recorded again after one week. The CH2 region of the amine now showed five new broad and unresolved multiplets beside the previous two signals, which were broader (Figure 6, center) and with lower intensity. In a third spectrum measured after two weeks (Figure 6, bot- tom), nearly no starting signals were left, but instead four new broad multiplets were observed. The signals for the two nitrogen atoms had shifted to δ = 14.0 (typical shift range for coordinated NH2) and 26.5 ppm (NH) (Figure 7, right). This indicated strongly that the amine is now coordinated. This conclusion was supported by the pair-wise splitting of the proton signals of the CH2 groups in the 1H/13C HSQC spectrum (Figure 8). Correlations were found at δ = 3.32/ 2.86 (1H) and 48.7 ppm (13C) as well as δ = 3.33/3.02 (1H) and 39.6 ppm (13C). The splitting of the proton resonance is due to the fact that the protons become non-equivalent upon coordination of the NH2 groups to the metal centers. www.eurjic.org © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2007, 376–383 380 The two protons of the NH2 group are also split into two broad signals (proton trace in Figure 8) at δ = 5.69 and 2.39 ppm. This is evidence for the formation of stable N– H···O hydrogen bonds, as observed in the solid-state struc- ture. Four different signals of isopropoxide groups were identified in the 1H/13C HSQC spectrum at this point (Fig- ure 8). Two signals overlap in the proton region at δ = 4.69 ppm (1H) and show 13C correlations to the signals at δ = 78.3 and 76.7 ppm; the third is located at δ = 4.51 (1H) and 76.1 ppm (13C). The signals at δ = 3.97 (1H) and 64.1 ppm (13C) are due to non-coordinated iPrOH. The NMR spectra after two weeks, especially the number and intensity ratio of the OiPr ligand signals, correspond with the local symmetry [two axial OiPr (trans to NH2), four equatorial and two bridging] of 1 in the solid-state struc- ture. The presence of noncoordinated 2-propanol is either due to incomplete removal of adsorbed alcohol during dry- ing of the crystals or minor hydrolysis during the long mea- suring period. Figure 8. 1H/13C HSQC spectrum of 1 in CD2Cl2 after two weeks. The two proton signals marked with an asterisk are from NH2. We interpret the spectroscopic findings by proposing that the polymeric adduct of 1 dissociates into [Ti2(OiPr)8] and NH(CH2CH2NH2)2 upon dissolution in CD2Cl2. The NMR spectra measured immediately after dissolution of the crystals thus correspond to a mixture of the starting compounds. The adduct is formed again in a slow reaction in solution, and the NMR spectra after two weeks corre- spond to the amine adduct 1. This notion was supported by the following experiment. When [Ti(OiPr)4] and bis(2- aminoethyl)amine were mixed in a 2:1 ratio (same Ti:amine ratio as in crystalline 1) in CD2Cl2 the same changes in the spectra were observed over a period of two weeks as when crystals of 1 were dissolved. Only the signals of the starting materials were present after mixing, whereas an identical signal pattern was observed after two weeks as for the dis- solved crystals. The corresponding complex [Zr2(OiPr)8(NH2CH2CH2- NHCH2CH2NH2)] (2) shows almost the same solution be- havior as 1, with the exception that 2 is less soluble, which leads to rather faster crystallization in the NMR tube. The crystals recovered from the NMR tube had identical cell parameters as the original crystals. Two- and Three-Dimensional Ti and Zr Coordination Polymers FULL PAPER As a result of the NMR investigations described above, it is now possible to prove adduct formation even if the compounds do not crystallize and thus no solid-state struc- tures are available. Figure 9 shows the NMR spectra of a 1:1 mixture of [Ti(OiPr)4] and N-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)- ethylenediamine in CD2Cl2. To prove whether coordination occurs in solution, spectra were recorded over a period of two months. New signals were observed one week after mixing the starting compounds (Figure 9, center), and after two months (Figure 9, bottom) almost no signals of the starting compounds were left. 15N NMR signals at δ = 14.3 (NH) and 2.7 ppm (NH2) were found after mixing the com- pounds, compared to δ = 13.4 (NH) and –4.0 ppm (NH2) for the ethylenediamine derivative before addition of [Ti(OiPr)4], which shifted to δ = 37.8 (NH) and 31.3 ppm (NH2) after two months. The signals for the iOPr ligands after two months correspond roughly to the symmetry of a [Ti2(OiPr)8(NH2R)2] complex. These NMR spectra thus strongly indicate that the ligand is almost completely coor- dinated and compound 5 is formed. Figure 9. 1H NMR spectrum of [Ti(OiPr)4] and H2NCH2CH2NHCH2CH2CH2Si(OMe)3 in a 1:1 ratio in CD2Cl2. Top: after mixing; center: after one week; bottom: after two months. In the 1H NMR spectrum of [{Ti2(OiPr)8}3- {N(CH2CH2NH2)3}2·Ti2(OiPr)8] (3) (Figure 10, top) four broad multiplets were observed between δ = 3.40 and 2.80 ppm immediately after dissolving the crystals, and the CH2 region in the 1H/13C HSQC spectrum (Figure 11) showed four different pairwise correlations to 13C atoms, with two of them belonging to the same CH2CH2 unit (δ = 36.4–53.3 and 38.6–60.0 ppm). An EXSY spectrum of this compound showed exchange peaks between these CH2CH2 Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2007, 376–383 © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 381 units along the diagonal. An explanation for this observa- tion might be that not all three CH2CH2 units are coordi- nated in solution and therefore show time-averaged 1H and 13C signals. The 15N signals were found at δ = 36.3 (N) and 14.8 ppm (coordinated NH2). Figure 10. Top: 1H NMR spectrum of [{Ti2(OiPr)8}3- {N(CH2CH2NH2)3}2·Ti2(OiPr)8] (3) immediately after dissolving the crystals in CD2Cl2. Bottom: [Ti(OiPr)4] and tris(2-aminoethyl)- amine in CD2Cl2 mixed in a 2:1 ratio after two weeks. Figure 11. 1H/13C HSQC spectrum of the CH2 region of 3 in CD2Cl2. Mixing [Ti(OiPr)4] and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine in a 2:1 ratio in CD2Cl2 again showed a very similar peak pattern for the CH2 region of the amine after two weeks (Figure 10, bottom). It is worth mentioning that the signals in the CH region of the isopropoxide ligand have different intensities, which might be due to either different concentrations of the product or to different amounts of free 2-propanol. The spectra of 3 suggests that this compound does not dissoci- ate (completely) into the starting compounds, contrary to what had been observed for 1 and 2. We cannot exclude that part of the NH2 groups dissociate, but the observed spectra after dissolution of the crystals of 3 are distinctly different to a mixture of [Ti(OiPr)4] and tris(2-aminoethyl)- amine. The interpretation of the OiPr signals in the spectra was complicated by the presence of the Ti2(OiPr)8 guests in the crystal lattice. H. Fric, M. Puchberger, U. Schubert FULL PAPER The corresponding zirconium derivative 4 is almost insol- uble in CD2Cl2, therefore no detailed NMR investigations were carried out. Conclusions We have shown that the previously observed formation of chain-like coordination polymers upon reaction of [M(OR)4] (M = Ti, Zr) with diamines can be extended to the formation of layered structures. Layers of [Ti2(OiPr)8]3- [N(CH2CH2NH2)3]2, consisting of condensed six-mem- bered rings, are obtained from [Ti(OiPr)4] and tris(2-amino- ethyl)amine. The voids of the rings are occupied by Ti2(OiPr)8 nonsolvated guest molecules. The amine adducts of [M(OR)4] (M = Ti, Zr) are re- tained in solution. Although 1 and 2 dissociate into [M(OiPr)4] and bis(2-aminoethyl)amine when dissolved in CD2Cl2, the adducts slowly form again in solution. We are aware that this may be different in other solvents. There is strong spectroscopic evidence that the network structure of 3 is retained upon dissolution of the crystals, at least par- tially. An important consequence for sol-gel processing is that amine adducts must be taken into account when [M(OR)4] is used in the presence of compounds with NH2 groups. Adduct formation will probably influence the reactivity of the alkoxides and may also result in morphological changes of the gels. We will further investigate the possibility to pre- organize gels by di- and triamine adducts. Experimental Section All operations were carried out in a moisture- and oxygen-free at- mosphere of argon. [Ti(OiPr)4] (97%, Aldrich), [Zr(OiPr)4] (70– 75% in heptane, ABCR), bis(2-aminoethyl)amine (99%, Aldrich) and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (96%, Aldrich ) were used as received. The solvents were dried and purified by standard techniques. Synthesis of [Ti2(OiPr)8(H2NCH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2)] (1): Bis(2- aminoethyl)amine (315 mg, 3.05 mmol) was added, whilst stirring, to a solution of [Ti(OiPr)4] (882 mg, 3.10 mmol) in 1 mL of 2-pro- panol at room temperature.

X-ray Structure Analyses: The crystals were mounted on a Siemens SMART diffractometer (area detector) and measured in a nitrogen stream. Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 71.069 pm, graphite monochroma- tor) was used for all measurements. The data collection at 173 K covered a hemisphere of the reciprocal space, by a combination of three or four sets of exposures. Each set had a different φ angle for the crystal, and each exposure took 15 or 20 s and covered 0.3° in ω. The crystal-to-detector distance was 5 cm. Further details can be found in Table 1. The data were corrected for polarization and Lorentz effects, and an empirical absorption correction (SADABS) was employed. The cell dimensions were refined with all unique reflections. The structures were solved by direct methods Two- and Three-Dimensional Ti and Zr Coordination Polymers FULL PAPER Table 1.

(SHELXS-97). Refinement was performed by the full-matrix least- squares method based on F2 (SHELXL-97) with anisotropic ther- mal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms were inserted in calculated positions and refined as riding on the corre- sponding atom. The C–O and C–C distances of the Ti2(OiPr)8 guest molecule in 3 were refined using geometric restraints (DFIX, DANG). CCDC-616750 (for 1), -616751 (for 2), -269602 (for 3) and -616752 (for 4) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

NMR Investigations: All NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer (1H at 300.13, 13C at 75.47 MHz, 15N at 30.41 MHz) equipped with a 5 mm, inverse-broadband probe head with a z-gradient unit at room temperature. 2D NMR spectra (EXSY, mixing time was usually 1 s; HSQC; HMBC) were mea- sured with Bruker standard pulse sequences. Gas-tight Young tubes were used for all measurements, and CD2Cl2 (99.8%, euriso-top) was used as the solvent. 15N shifts were referenced externally against an aqueous solution of 15NH4Cl. To remove most of the residual amine and free alcohol previous to the measurement, the crystals were dissolved in CD2Cl2, the solvent was removed again in vacuo, and the residue was dried for more than 8 h at 410–4 mbar. The dried precipitate was then used for NMR in- vestigations. Acknowledgments This work was supported by the Fonds zur Förderung der wissen- schaftlichen Forschung (FWF), Austria.
