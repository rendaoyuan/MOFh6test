The crystal structure Introduction Currently, the increasing interest in the field of the crystal engineering of inorganic-organic hybrid materials is justi- fied by the potential applications of these materials as ca- talysts, zeolite-like materials, biology, magnetic functional materials, and so on [1]. There is also an aesthetic perspec- tive: for the vast amount of inorganic-organic hybrid mate- rials, the intriguing variety of the structures and topologies that can be obtained by self-assembling metal ions and mul- tifunctional ligands attract chemists. In recent years, al- though the synthesis of inorganic-organic hybrid materials based on transition metals has become widespread [2], there are relatively few reports on lanthanide-based inorganic- organic hybrid materials despite their potential applications in luminescence and other fields [3]. To our knowledge, lanthanide-based inorganic-organic hybrid materials with aromatic carboxylic acids exhibit good thermal and luminescent stability for practical application. Furthermore, LN-TM-based (LN  lanthanide, TM  Transition Metal) inorganic-organic hybrid materials with aromatic carboxylic acids as ligands maybe have novel structural topologies and properties. Therefore, our group recently became interested in the crystal engineering of LN- TM-based inorganic-organic hybrid materials with iso- nicotinic acid as ligand.

Experimental Section Physical measurements All reactants, A. R. grade quality, were obtained commercially and used without further purification. The fluorescent data were col- lected at room temperature on a computer-controlled JY Fluoro- Max-3 spectrometer. The UV/vis spectra were recorded at room temperature on a computer-controlled PE Lambda 35 UV/vis spec- trometer equipped with an integrating sphere in the wavelength range 1902500 nm. BaSO4 plate was used as a reference (100 % reflectance), on which the finely ground powder of the samples were coated. The absorption spectra were calculated from reflection spectra by the Kubelka-Munk function: α/S  (1-R)2/2R, α is the absorption coefficient, S is the scattering coefficient which is practi- cally wavelength independent when the particle size is larger than 5 μm, and R is the reflectance. The energy band gaps were deter- mined by extrapolation from the linear portion of the absorption edge in a (α/S) versus energy plot from the UV-vis diffuse spectra [4]. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurement of the title complex on polycrystalline samples was performed on a PPMS 9T Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. All data were corrected for diamagnetism estimated from Pascal’s constants. Preparation of [{Er(NC5H4COOH)(H2O)2}2- (H5O2)(HgCl5)(HgCl4)2(H2O)2]n The title complex was prepared by mixing ErCl3·6H2O (1 mmol, 382 mg), HgCl2 (1 mmol, 272 mg), isonicotinic acid (1 mmol, 123 mg) and 10 mL distilled water in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 3 days. After being slowly cooled to room temperature at 6 °C/h, pink crystals suitable for X- ray analysis were obtained. The yield was 73 % (based on erbium). W.-T. Chen, Y.-P. Xu, Q.-Y. Luo, X.-N. Fang, H.-L. Chen Crystallography The intensity data set was collected on a Rigaku Mercury CCD X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo-K radi- ation (λ  0.71073 A˚ ) by using a ω scan technique. CrystalClear software was used for data reduction and empirical absorption cor- rections [5]. The structure was solved by the direct method using the Siemens SHELXTLTM Version 5 package of crystallographic software [6]. The difference Fourier maps based on these atomic positions yield the other non-hydrogen atoms. The structures were refined using a full-matrix least-squares refinement on F2. All atoms were refined anisotropically. Crystallographic data are given in Table 1, and selected bond distances and bond angles are given in Table 2. Table 1 Crystallographic data for 1.

Chem. 2008, 529533 530 Results and Discussion The structure of 1 consists of [Er(NC5H4COOH)(H2O)2]6 2 cationic chains, (H5O2) cations, [HgCl5]3 and [HgCl4]2 anions, and isolated water molecules. The Hg1 atom is tetrahedrally bounded by four chlorine atoms to form a [HgCl4]2 anion, while the Hg2 atom is coordinated by five chlorine atoms to form a [HgCl5]3 anion. In contrast to the numerous complexes containing [HgCl4]2 anions, only two complexes containing [HgCl5]3 anions were reported thus far [7]. The bond lengths of Hg-Cl range from 2.278(2) to 2.604(2) A˚ with an average value of 2.470(2) A˚ , which are similar to the counterparts found in the literature [8]. The Hg2 atom is positional disordered and the occupancy of Hg2 must be set to 0.5 to get rational structure model and thermal displacement parameters. The erbium atom is octahedrally coordinated by eight oxygen atoms, of which two are from two water molecules and six are from six iso- nicotinic acid ligands, yielding a distorted square anti-prism with the top and bottom planes defined by O(1), O(2)- (x, y, 0.5z), O(5), O(6)(x, y, 0.5z) and O(3), O(3W), O(4), O(4W)(0.5x, 0.5y, 1z) atoms, respectively. The bond lengths of Er-Oisonicotinic acid range from 2.293(3) to 2.335(3) A˚ with an average value of 2.317(3) A˚ , which is obviously shorter than that of Er-Owater being of 2.424(2) and 2.452(2) A˚ , indicating that isonicotinic acid ligand has a stronger affinity to Er3 ion than that of water. The erbium atoms are alternately bridged by two or four μ2- isonicotinic acid ligands in a 2-4-2 (the number indicates the number of the bridges) mode to construct a 1D chain with the Er···Er distances of ca. 5.029 and 4.496 A˚ , respec- tively (Fig. 1 and Scheme 1d). It is noteworthy that, up to date, the types of the chains formed by RE and isonicotinic acid that have been documented are mainly 1-1-1, 2-1-2 and 2-2-2 types (Scheme 1a, b and c, respectively). However, the 2-4-2 type is very rare. In 1, no π···π stacking interactions were established between the adjacent isonicotinic acid Scheme 1 Important chain-like structural types of isonicotinic acid bridging RE centers: (a), 1-1-1; (b) 2-1-2; (c) 2-2-2 and (d) 2-4-2 types, in which the number indicates the number of the bridges.

The 1D chains, [HgCl4]2 moieties and water mol- ecules are linked by hydrogen bonds to yield a 3D network with [HgCl5]3 anions located in the cavities (Fig. 2).Results of the bond valence calculations indicate that the erbium and mercury atoms are in 3 and 2 oxidation states, respectively (Er1: 3.240, Hg1: 2.121, Hg2: 2.430) [9]. It is proposed that O1W hydrogen-bonds to its symmetry-re- lated O1W to form a (H5O2) moiety. Other crystallo- graphic independent water molecules cannot form the (H5O2) moiety, because they cannot hydrogen-bond to their symmetry-related water molecules. The position of the proton between O1W and its symmetry-related O1W could not be structurally located due to the existence of the heavy erbium and mercury atoms. However, the existence of (H5O2) has been confirmed by the MS spectra showing (H5O2) at m/z  37.0164. Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2008, 529533 © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 531 Fluorescent Properties: The solid-state emission spectra of the title complex were investigated at room temperature (Fig. 3). The fluorescent spectrum study shows that the title complex exhibits interesting emission bands with two maxi- mum wavelengths of 438 and 461 nm upon photo-excitation at 388 nm. Besides these two main emission bands, there are several shoulder bands, i.e. 499, 536, 556 and 675 nm. The emission should probably be assigned to the LMCT transition (charge transfer from isonicotinic acid ligand to RE metal). Thus, this complex may be a candidate of lumi- nescent materials. Fig. 3 Solid-state emission and excitation spectra. Full line: emis- sion spectra; broken line: excitation spectra. UV-vis Spectroscopy: Optical absorption spectrum of 1 reveals the presence of an obviously optical gap of 3.45 eV (Fig. 4), which suggests that complex 1 may be a potential wide-gap semiconductor. The gradual slope of the optical absorption edge for 1 is indicative of the existence of in- direct transitions [10]. The mainly optical absorption of 1 is likely originated from the charge-transfer excitations mainly from the valence band of the chloride ligands to the con- duction band of the mercury atom, similar to those re- ported in the references [11]. Erbium atoms probably con- tribute the small absorption bands in ca. 0.82, 1.89, 2.37, 2.53 and 3.26 eV. Fig. 4 Solid-state diffuse reflectance spectrum. W.-T. Chen, Y.-P. Xu, Q.-Y. Luo, X.-N. Fang, H.-L. Chen Fig. 5 A graph of χM and χMT vs T of 1. The red full line corre- sponds to the best data fit. Magnetic Properties: The magnetic susceptibility of 1 was investigated from 300 to 2 K at 5000 Oe on the polycrystal- line samples (Fig. 5). The mercury ions are not involved into the magnetic interactions, due to the diamagnetism of the Hg2 ion. At 300 K, the xMT value is 11.3 cm3 K mol1, slightly smaller than the expected value in the free- ion approximation for one isolated Er3 ion (11.5 cm3 K mol1). When decreasing the temperature, the xMT of 1 decreases gradually from 11.3 cm3 K mol1 at 300 K to reach 10.5 cm3 K mol1 at 50 K. On further cooling, xMT decreases rapidly to about 5.2 cm3 K mol1 at 2 K. This behavior is typically observed for paramagnetic systems that exhibit dominating antiferromagnetic interactions. Curve fit for xM versus T plot of 1 with the Curie-Weiss law in the whole range of 2-300 K give good result with C  10.8 cm3 K mol1 and θ  2.3 K for 1. The small negative Weiss constant suggests weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the Er3 ions in the [Er(NC5H4- COOH)(H2O)2]6 2 cationic chain. Further analysis of the magnetic data will be carried out later when suitable model is found to fit the data. The field dependence of the mag- netization for 1 measured at 2 K reveals a hysteresis loop with a coercive field of ca. 23 Oe and remnant magnetiz- ation of ca. 7.4103 Nβ, suggesting the paramagnetic be- havior of 1 (Fig. 6). The magnetization increases fast with Fig. 6 Magnetization vs. H at 2 K for 1. Inset: Expansion showing the small coercivity. www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Clearly, the saturation of magnetization for 1 is still not reached up to 80 kOe with a value of 3.55 Nβ. In conclusion, we have successfully prepared the first heterometallic 4f-5d metal-isonicotinic acid complex via hydrothermal reaction. The crystal structure of the title complex is characterized by a one-dimensional chain-like structure. It may be found its potential application in the areas of luminescence, semiconductor, magnetism and so on. It is believed that more and more LN-TM-based inorganic-organic hybrid complexes with good properties can be developed.
