Hybrid organic-inorganic materials of the type (diamine)- MeSO4 (Me = Cd, Zn) [diamine = p-xylylenediamine (PXDA) or m- xylylenediamine (MXDA)] have not been described in the literature to date. Four compounds of this type, namely, (MXDA)ZnSO4 (1), (MXDA)CdSO4 (2), (PXDA)ZnSO4 (3), and (PXDA)CdSO4 (4), were synthesized by solvothermal methods. Since all compounds crys- tallized as very fine powders, crystal structure studies were performed using powder diffraction methods. All compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic crystal system and the cell parameters are: a = 9.8004(4) Å, b = 10.7829(3) Å, c = 4.88473(19) Å for 1; 9.8824(10), Introduction As has been recently found, even simple inorganic salts (e.g. sulfates) create interesting layered or linear structures under solvothermal conditions in the presence of amines. A number of compounds, which belong to this class, have been described in the literature.[1–4] These materials are interesting because of their potential applications in catalysis, as sorption or ion exchange materials, etc. While studying the MeSO4-diamine system (Me = Zn or Cd), a new group of compounds was obtained. These materials with the formula (diamine)MeSO4 formed using solvothermal methods. Their diffraction patterns and unit cell parameters are similar to typical MeQ(amine)1/2 compounds (Q = S, Se, Te).[5–10] Because these new materials crystallize as very fine, greasy powders, the formation of a novel type of complexes was proved by X-ray powder diffraction data analysis. The new compounds feature a unique structural architecture. They are built of parallel monolayers consisted of Zn2+ or Cd2+ and sulfate anions. Amines, MXDA, or PXDA, are connecting adjacent layers, by the covalent bonds with metal atoms from the 2D inorganic slabs –Me–SO4–, forming a 3D network. * Prof. W.

The compounds with MXDA as a linker, crystallize in the space group P21ma, those with PXDA in Pnma. These hybrid materials are built of inorganic monolayers [–Me–(SO4)–] joined by organic linkers created by di- amines (PXDA or MXDA). Me metal ions and SO42– anions form layers with a honeycomb structure. In addition to crystal structure, chemical analyses and SEM investigations were performed. Thermal stability of the compounds was also investigated using TG-DSC meth- ods and XRD as a function of temperature. The obtained materials were the subject of wide-range re- search aimed at their full structural characterization based on powder diffraction data. Their morphology and thermal sta- bility were also investigated. Results and Discussion X-ray Powder Diffraction Since all compounds crystallize as very fine powders, struc- tural investigations were performed using X-ray powder dif- fraction (XRPD). Firstly, XRPD data were recorded using a diffractometer working in Bragg-Brentano geometry, if further studies indicate the presence of texture, for purpose of struc- tural studies, additional measurements were performed in DSH geometry (samples loaded into capillaries). XRPD patterns for (MXDA)ZnSO4 (1) and (MXDA)CdSO4 (2) were recorded with a diffractometer working in Debye- Scherrer geometry (capillary size 2r = 0.7 mm). Cell param- eters were found using the WinPLOTR program package.[11] The space group was obtained with the program EXPO2009,[12] which calculates normalized structure factors, prepares intensity statistics; subsequently the program suggests space groups ranked in the order of their probability. Positions of heavy atoms and atoms of organic parts were found using direct methods and global optimization techniques. Calcula- tions were performed using the EXPO2009 and FOX[12,13] pro- grams. The structure models were refined with the Rietveld method (JANA2006 program[14]). Using LeBail fitting, the background, zero shift, unit cell, and profile parameters, in- cluding asymmetry, were refined one by one. Afterwards, the W. Łasocha ARTICLE positions of atoms were fitted. For all atoms isotropic thermal displacement parameters were applied. The absorption correc- tion was introduced, assuming a cylindrical sample shape. Geometric restraints on bond lengths and angles and con- straints on atomic displacement parameters were used to im- prove the stability of the refinement.

All steps in the refining pro- cedure were essentially the same as in the case of compounds 1 and 2. In these cases, only small preferred orientation was detected and taken into account in Rietveld refinement (March- Dollase texture function, direction [010]).

Compounds 1, 2 and 3, 4 are isostructural, and all compounds show significant similarities. This is demon- strated clearly in Figure 5A and B, where basic structures’ fragments are presented. Z.

In each compound, the atoms Me (Zn, Cd) are surrounded by six ligands, two nitrogen atoms (in cis position to each other) and four oxygen atoms, forming a distorted octahedron. The sulfur atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms. The –Me–SO4– layers in all compounds are essentially sim- ilar; they are flat as being located exactly on the crystallo- graphic mirror plane. A –Cd–SO4– layer is shown in Fig- ure 6A. Interestingly, from the viewpoint of topology, the lay- ers –Me–SO4– are similar to the layers in MeQ(amine)1/2 com- pounds.[5] In both cases, there exist fused six-membered rings, their vertices are alternately occupied by the three Me atoms and by three anions (SO42– in our studies). Each vertex is com- mon to three rings. Inorganic layers can be described by topo- logical index 63. However, in the presented cases, each Me atom is coordinated by two amine groups; this results in dif- ferent stoichiometry, octahedrally coordinated central metal atoms can be more easily accommodated in flat Me–SO4 lay- ers, whereas in MeQ(amine)1/2 such layers are puckered. The use of different amines determines the space group, in which these type of compounds [(amine)MeSO4] crystallize. All compounds with MXDA as an organic linker crystallize in the space group P21ma, whereas compounds with PXDA crystallize in Pnma. This could be related to the arrangement of the linking fragment and the preference of terminal –CH2– NH2 groups to adopt cis or trans conformation (mutual orien- tation). Such a phenomenon was observed in the case of MeQ(diamine)1/2,[5] where two different space groups accord- ing to an even or odd number of carbon atoms in aliphatic diamine NH2–(CH2)n–NH2 were found. Figure 6B and C show layered structures, the alignment of the diamines, and linking fragments in the structures of (MXDA)ZnSO4 and (PXDA)ZnSO4. 15213749, 2013, 12-13, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zaac.201300171 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

Łasocha ARTICLE Figure 6. Structure of (amine)MeSO4, (A) layer of –Zn–SO4–. View along layers: (B) (MXDA)ZnSO4, (C) (PXDA)ZnSO4. In all structures the diamine rings are perpendicular to each other. The arrangement of amines is shown in Figure 7. More- over, in compounds 1 and 2 the MXDA molecules are arranged orthogonally to –Me–SO4– layers (lying exactly on the plane of symmetry m), in contrast to compounds 3 and 4 (Figure 8). In these compounds the LS planes of diamines are perpendicu- lar, but their long axes are arranged obliquely to the –Me– SO4– layers. This is the result of the different mutual positions of –CH2–NH2 groups in both amines (p-xylylenediamine and m- xylylenediamine). www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The alignment of amines between inorganic layers in (A) (1, 2) (amine – MXDA), (B) (3, 4) (amine – PXDA). The materials obtained are similar to reported recently re- ported open-framework sulfates.[1–4] Nevertheless, some dif- ferences can be observed. The most important is the way of connection of the organic components. In case of the new com- pounds, the amine molecules are linked directly by covalent bonds to the metal atoms, whereas in the open-framework compounds[1–4] ammonium fragments are connected by ionic forces and hydrogen bonds. Also, only the new compounds 15213749, 2013, 12-13, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zaac.201300171 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Pillared Metal Sulfates (Diamine)MeSO4, (Me = Zn, Cd) were obtained as three-dimensional hybrid inorganic-organic materials. An interesting representative of such a kind of open-framework compound is [H3N(CH2)3NH3][Cd2(H2O)2- (SO4)3].[4] It is a lamellar material with a 44 topology of the Cd–SO4– layer. In this case fused rings in the layer are built of two octahedrally coordinated cadmium atoms and two sulfate groups, whereas in our compounds three metal atoms and three sulfate groups are involved. Chemical Analyses The obtained compounds provided good diffraction images, but they were greasy materials, difficult to properly wash and drain. The chemical analyses are in general agreement with the results of the structure solution, but indicate also that samples (particularly MXDA complexes) are significantly contami- nated by amorphous or liquid admixtures. (PXDA)ZnSO4: ZnSO4C8H12N2 (297.65 g·mol–1): C 33.92 (calcd. 32.28), H 4.22 (4.06), N 9.61 (9.41), S 9.79 (10.77)%. This result indicates a small excess of amine. (MXDA)ZnSO4: ZnSO4C8H12N2 (297.65 g·mol–1): C 38.95 (calcd. 32.28), H 4.16 (4.06), N 9.63 (9.41), S 10.70 (10.77)%. In this case the chemical analysis also indicates an excess of amine, but in larger quantities. (PXDA)CdSO4: CdSO4N2H12C8 (344.57 g·mol–1): C 29.88 (calcd. 27.88), H 3.59 (3.48), N 8.29 (8.12), S 9.02 (9.31)%. These slight differences can be explained by an excess of amine. (MXDA)CdSO4: CdSO4N2H12C8 (344.57 g·mol–1): C 24.31 (calcd. 27.88), H 3.15 (3.48), N 7.07 (8.12), S 10.03 (9.31)%. That indicates the presence of impurities (synthesis substrates). SEM (MXDA)ZnSO4 (1): SEM images of 1 (Figure 9A) show that the obtained crystallites share uniform morphology. Domi- nant are thin plates (thickness from 10 to 50 nm) with very uneven surfaces. The crystallites are complex aggregates. (MXDA)CdSO4 (2): SEM images show aggregates of plate-like crystallites with irregular edges and heterogeneous surfaces. Their shape and thickness vary greatly (from 0.1 μm to 1 μm). The crystallites are shown in Figure 9B. (PXDA)ZnSO4 (3): The crystallites are rectangular and of different sizes, with a thickness of about 0.1 μm. The edges of the crystallites are regular and the surfaces are homogeneous (Figure 9C). (PXDA)CdSO4 (4): SEM images show that the crystallites are of different sizes, from 0.1 μm to several μm, and with thicknesses of about 1 μm or less. The surfaces are quite homogeneous and the edges are rather regular (Figure 9D). TG-DSC and XRPD versus Temperature Using TG-DSC, thermal stability of the compounds was in- vestigated. For all compounds, the results obtained through TG-DSC exhibit multi-step weight losses. Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2013, 2195–2201 © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

(MXDA)ZnSO4: Three weight loss steps, 21.04%, 14.79%, and 22.81% (in the range 210 °C to 520 °C), correspond to releases of amine. It is also possible that in the last mass loss (22.81%), two combined effects occur: the release of amine and the first step of decomposition of ZnSO4 to ZnO. Total loss of weight is 81.64% and the product is ZnO. TG-DSC results of (MXDA)ZnSO4 are shown in Figure 10. Figure 10. TG-DSC analysis of (MXDA)ZnSO4. (MXDA)CdSO4: The weight loss steps (16.55%, 16.96%, 3%) can be explained by the sequential release of two nearly equal amounts of amines. The total weight loss is 38.72% and the final product is CdSO4. TG-DSC results of (MXDA)- CdSO4 are shown in Figure 11. (PXDA)ZnSO4: The weight loss steps around 300 °C to 510 °C, connected with the first two exothermic peaks, corre- spond to the loss of amines pertaining to (PXDA)ZnSO4 as a result of its decomposition 48.96 (calcd. 46%). The last exo- thermic peak (at 559 °C) is a consequence of zinc sulfate de- composition with release of SO3 (19.00% loss of mass). The total mass loss in is between 72–74% (cal. 73%) and the final product is ZnO. TG-DSC results of (PXDA)ZnSO4 are shown in Figure 12. 15213749, 2013, 12-13, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zaac.201300171 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

(PXDA)CdSO4: The two weight loss steps (20.33% and 21.09%) in the range 300 °C to 650 °C correspond to the com- plete loss of amine belonging to the (PXDA)CdSO4 (calcd. 39.5%). In turn, the two exothermic peaks that appear at 800 and 854 °C may be caused by the melting of some products of thermal decomposition, such as CdSO4. The final product of the TG-DSC analysis is cadmium sulfate (CdSO4). TG-DSC results of (PXDA)CdSO4 are shown in Figure 13. Figure 13. TG-DSC analysis of (PXDA)CdSO4. Summing up the TG-DSC experiments, the obtained com- pounds are stable to about 300 °C. Next, two-step removal of www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2013, 2195–2201 2200 amine is observed. Nearly equal amounts of released amine suggest the formation of intermediate compounds with the for- mula (diamine)1/2MeSO4. In the case of zinc compounds 1 and 3, final decomposition leads to formation of ZnO (ca. 670 °C), whereas CdSO4 is formed (500–550 °C) in the case of cad- mium-amine sulfates 2 and 4. The TG-DSC results were verified by temperature-depend- ent XRPD measurements. (PXDA)ZnSO4 and (PXDA)CdSO4 were investigated in this way (see Figure 14 and Figure 15). High temperature XRPD data indicate that the samples are stable until ca. 300 °C and proved the type of final products of thermal decomposition (ZnO, CdSO4). They also indicate that the intermediate product formed with one amine per for- mal molecule (ca. 300–400 °C) is different from the initial product. The cell parameters of those intermediate products are: a = b = 10.074(4) Å, c = 21.864(8) Å for (PXDA)CdSO4 and a = b = 9.961(5) Å, c = 21.181(9) Å for (PXDA)ZnSO4. It seems that the initial orthorhombic structure with formula (PXDA)Me]SO4 recrystallized to a tetragonal material with the formula (PXDA)1/2MeSO4. It was tried to isolate and examine the intermediate phase. However, our efforts have yielded in complex two-phase mixtures, leading to difficulties in determi- nation of the space group, which prevented structural studies. The temperature-dependent XRPD patterns are shown in Fig- ure 14 and Figure 15. Figure 14. XRPD pattern vs. temp. for (PXDA)CdSO4. Figure 15. XRPD pattern vs. temp. for (PXDA)ZnSO4. Conclusions Four new hybrid compounds (diamine)MeSO4, (Me = Cd, Zn) were synthesized under solvothermal conditions (2 d, 160 °C). All materials crystallize in the orthorhombic crystal system: (PXDA)MeSO4 in space group Pnma and 15213749, 2013, 12-13, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zaac.201300171 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

The cell parameters for compounds with the same amine but varied metal atoms are slightly dif- ferent because of the different zinc and cadmium ionic radii. These three-dimensional hybrid materials are built of infinite parallel layers –Me–(SO4)–, connected by diamines (MXDA, PXDA) forming coordination bonds with metal ions. SEM images showed that the obtained compounds are aggregates of plate-shaped crystals. TG-DSC analyses showed that all com- pounds are stable to about 300 °C, after which a two-step re- lease of amine is observed. In the case of (MXDA)ZnSO4 and (PXDA)ZnSO4 the final product is ZnO, whereas for (PXDA)CdSO4 and (MXDA)CdSO4 the final product is CdSO4. Although they comprise of more complicated building blocks, the inorganic layers in MeQ(amine)1/2 and (amine)MeSO4 are similar from a topological point of view. Experimental Section Materials: Zinc sulfate hydrate (ZnSO4·7H2O) and cadmium sulfate hydrate (CdSO4·8H2O) were purchased from Fabryka Odczynników Chemicznych Gliwice (POCH); p-xylylenediamine and m-xylylenedia- mine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Synthesis of (MXDA)MeSO4 (1, 2): (MXDA)ZnSO4 was obtained by solvothermal route using ZnSO4·7H2O (0.01 mol) and m-xylylenedi- amine (MXDA) (0.01 mol). Zinc sulfate hydrate was thoroughly ground and placed into a 63-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and the amine (MXDA) was added. The mixture was heated at 160 °C for 2 d and cooled naturally to room temperature. The product 1 was washed with a mixture of 2-propanol and water (2:1) and finally dried at room temperature for 24 h. Similar conditions were used for the synthesis of [(MXDA)Cd]SO4 (2), but in this case the source of Me atoms was CdSO4·8H2O. Synthesis of (PXDA)MeSO4 (3, 4): The synthesis was performed using ZnSO4·7H2O (0.01 mol) and p-xylylenediamine (PXDA) (0.0125 mol). Zinc sulfate hydrate and p-xylylenediamine were ground, mixed, and placed in a 63-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel auto- clave. The mixture was heated at 160 °C for 2 d and cooled naturally to room temperature. The product 3 was washed with a mixture of 2- propanol and water (2:1) and finally dried at room temperature. A similar method was used to synthesize (PXDA)CdSO4 (4), however CdSO4·8H2O was used instead of zinc sulfate. Crystal Structure Determination: X-ray powder diffraction patterns (XRPD) of the samples were recorded with a X’PERT PRO MPD diffractometer, working in Bragg-Brentano or Debye-Scherrer geome- try; incident and antiscatter slits were 1/4 and 1/2°, respectively (detec- tor X’CELERATOR, radiation Cu-Kα, X-ray tube working conditions 40 kV and 30 mA). The measurement range was from 4° to 65° 2θ with interpolated step size 0.02°.

The measurements were performed in an air atmosphere. The heating rate was 10 °C·min–1; the initial temperature was 20 °C, the final 1000 °C. The morphology of the samples was investigated with a JEOL JSM- 7500F Scanning Electron Microscope. The samples were applied on brass stubs and sputter-coated with chrome. The accelerating voltage was 15 kV. Chemical analysis was performed with a Euro Vector EA 300 Elemen- tal Analyzer. Thermal analysis was performed in air, or helium using an XRK cham- ber produced by Anton Paar. The heat rate was 10 °C·min–1. After reaching the desired temperature the sample was stabilized for 10 min. The initial temperature was equal to room temperature; subsequent temperatures were 100 °C, 200 °C, 300 °C, etc. up to 700 °C.
