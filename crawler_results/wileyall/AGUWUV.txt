Manuscript ARTICLE DOI: 10.1002/zaac.200900278 An Unusual Linear Trinuclear NiII-based MOF with an Unprecedented μ4- κ2N1,N5:κ1N2:κ1N6 Binding Mode by 5-(Pyrazinyl)tetrazolate Ligand Yan Feng,[a] En-Cui Yang,[a] Min Fu,[a] and Xiao-Jun Zhao*[a] Keywords: Metal-organic frameworks; In situ reaction; Nickel; X-ray diffraction; 5-(Pyrazinyl)tetrazolate Abstract. A photofluorescent linear trinuclear NiII-based three-dimen- sional (3D) metal-organic framework (MOF) with tfz-d topology, {[Ni3(H2O)4(ptz)2(btec)]·4H2O}n (1) (ptz– = 5-(pyrazinyl)tetrazolate, btec4– = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate), was achieved by in situ hy- drothermal reaction of 2-cyanopyrazine with NaN3 in the presence of Introduction Since Xiong and co-workers borrowed Sharpless' idea [1] and prepared a series of tetrazole-based coordination polymers by in situ tetrazole synthesis from various nitriles and azides [2, 3], the design and construction of metal-organic frame- works (MOFs) with tetrazolyl ligands are of great interest be- cause of the effectiveness, simplicity, and environmental friendliness of the in situ synthetic route as well as the poten- tial applications of crystalline MOFs in gas storage [4], second order nonlinear optics [5], luminescence [5–7], and magnetism [7–8]. To date, lots of functional MOFs with pyridyl- [2], phe- nyl- [9], pyrazinyl- [10–12], pyrimidyl- [6b], aliphatic- [3], di- tetrazolate ligands [13–15], as well as ZnII [5], CdII [5, 10], CuI/II [10, 11, 16], MnII [17], AgI [9, 16], CoII [11], NiII [18], FeII [19], and PtII [20] ions, have been successfully generated by in situ reactions with special interest on the tuning of the organic nitrile and Lewis acid combinations. However, to the best of our knowledge, little investigation has been performed on the roles of the functional secondary ligands in the in situ reaction by far. It is well known that the co-coordination of the auxiliary ligands can significantly dominate the overall ar- chitectures and functions of the target MOFs. Therefore, to explore the intrinsic co-coordination of the aromatic polycar- boxylate co-ligand on the resulting MOF herein, the in situ hydrothermal reaction of 2-cyanopyrazine with sodium azide in the presence of Ni2+ as Lewis acid and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetra- carboxylic acid (H4btec) as auxiliary ligand was performed. * Prof. Dr. X.-J.

Interestingly, the ptz– ligand in 1 represents an unprecedented tetradentate μ4- κ2N1,N5:κ1N2:κ1N6 chelating-bridging mode and contributes to the extension of the 1D ribbons into a 3D framework. Unexpectedly, the first NiII-ptz–-based three-dimensional (3D) MOF with an unusual linear trinuclear motif, {[Ni3(H2O)4(ptz)2(btec)]·4H2O}n (1) (ptz– = 5-(pyrazinyl)tetra- zolate), was successfully isolated, which exhibits a (3,8)-con- nected tfz-d topological structure and strong fluorescent emis- sion. More importantly, the ptz– ligand in 1 presents an unprecedented tetradentate μ4-κ2N1,N5:κ1N2:κ1N6 chelating- bridging mode, which essentially contributes to the extension of the high-dimensional framework of 1. Experimental Section Reagents and Instruments 2-Cyanopyrazine was purchased from TCI and other analytical-grade starting materials were obtained commercially and used as received without further purification. Doubly deionized water was employed for the conventional synthesis. The IR spectrum was performed in the range 4000–400 cm–1 with a Nicolet IR-200 spectrometer as KBr pel- lets. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were determined with a Per- kin–Elmer 2400C elemental analyzer. The TG-DTA measurement was carried out with a Shimadzu simultaneous DTG-60A thermal analysis instrument with a heating rate of 8 °C·min–1 from room temperature to 800 °C under nitrogen (flow rate 10 mL·min–1). Fluorescence spec- tra of the polycrystalline samples were performed with a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian) equipped with a xenon lamp and quartz carrier at room temperature. Synthesis {[Ni3(H2O)4(ptz)2(btec)]·4H2O}n (1): NiCl2·6H2O (47.5 mg, 0.2 mmol), H4btec (25.4 mg, 0.1 mmol), 2-cyanopyrazine (10.5 mg, 0.1 mmol), and NaN3 (13.0 mg, 0.2 mmol) were dissolved in water (10 mL) and stirred for 10 minutes. Afterwards, the resulting mixture was transferred into a parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (23 mL) and heated to 160 °C for 96 h under autogenous pressure. Green block- shaped crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained directly, washed with ethanol, and dried in air. Yield: 56 % based on 2-cyanopy- razine.

X-ray Crystallography Diffraction intensity for 1 was collected on a computer controlled Bruker APEX–II CCD diffractometer equipped with graphite-mono- chromated Mo-Kα radiation with radiation wavelength 0.71073 Å by using ω-φ scan technique. The program SAINT [21] was used for integration of the diffraction profiles. Semi-empirical absorption cor- rections were applied using SADABS [22] program. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined with the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 programs [23]. An- isotropic thermal parameters were assigned to all non-hydrogen atoms. The organic hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically. The start- ing positions of hydrogen attached to oxygen atom were located in difference Fourier syntheses and then fixed geometrically as riding atoms. One lattice water molecule (O8) was found disordered over three positions and refined with the sum of the occupation factors re- strained to one (0.20, 0.30 and 0.50 for O(8), O(8'), and O(8'') respec- tively).

Results and Discussion Synthesis and FT-IR Spectra In situ [2+3] cycloaddition reaction of 2-cyanopyrazine and NaN3 with a molar ratio of 1:2 in the presence of NiCl2·6H2O as Lewis acid catalyst and H4btec as coligand under hydrother- mal conditions directly gave green block-shaped crystals, {[Ni3(H2O)4(ptz)2(btec)]·4H2O}n (1). In the IR spectrum of 1, the strong and broad adsorption band at ca. 3431 cm–1 repre- sents the characteristic vibration of hydroxyl group, which confirms the existence of lattice water molecules. The absence of the band for stretching vibrations of the cyano group at 2200 cm–1 and the appearance of bands at 1567 and 1486 cm–1 for the stretching vibrations of a tetrazole group [9, 20] suggest the formation of the ptz– ligand. The absence of the band at ca. 1700 cm–1 suggests the deprotonation of H4btec in 1. In addition, the differences (Δν˜) in ν˜(COO–) and ν˜(COO–) in 1 (81 and 177 cm–1) indicate that the carboxylate groups adopt the chelating bidentate and monodentate coordination mode [24], which are also in agreement with the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Structural Description of 1 Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that {[Ni3(H2O)4(ptz)2(btec)]·4H2O}n (1) crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1¯, displaying a robust 3D MOF with unusual linear trinuclear [Ni3(H2O)4(btec)]2+ cation as a core subunit and a pair of ptz– anions as linkers. As shown in Figure 1, the core subunit of 1 consists of three NiII atoms with Ni1 located at the crystallographic symmetry center, one fully deprotonated btec4– anion at another inversion center, and two pairs of coor- A Trinuclear NiII-based MOF with μ4-κ2N1,N5:κ1N2:κ1N6 Binding Mode dinated water molecules. Both crystallographically independ- ent NiII atoms reside in distorted octahedrons, in which Ni1 is surrounded by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from two differ- ent btec4– ligands, which occupy an equatorial plane and two pyrazinyl nitrogen atoms from two separate ptz– anions located at the axial positions. Instead, Ni2 is coordinated by three ni- trogen atoms from two ptz– ligands (one tetrazolyl N2 atom from one ptz– molecule and chelated pyrazinyl N5 and tetra- zolyl N1 donors from the other ptz– molecule), one carboxylate oxygen donor of the btec4– anion and two coordinated water molecules, respectively (see Supporting Information Figure S1). The Ni–O bond lengths [2.0161(18) – 2.059(2) Å] are generally shorter than those of Ni–N [2.064(2) – 2.145(2) Å, see Table 2], although they are similar to previously reported values [18, 25]. Figure 1.

Ni2A is related to Ni2 by the symmetry-generated code (A: 1–x, 1–y, 1–z). Ni1, Ni2, and Ni2A are doubly held together by two carboxylate groups of the btec4– anions in bidentate Figure 3.

KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 255 bridging and monodentate modes to generate a linear trinuclear [Ni3(H2O)4(btec)]2+ subunit with coordinated water molecules as terminal ligands (Figure 1). The Ni···Ni separation within the trinuclear subunit is 5.0464(1) Å, and the bond angle of Ni2–Ni1–Ni2A is 180 °. Previously, some analogous trinuclear motifs constructed from metal ions and carboxylate groups of aromatic ring, M3(COO)n, have also been observed (M = ZnII, CdII, CoII, LaIII [13, 26, 27], MnII [28], MgII [29], ZnII/CoII, ZnII/NiII and ZnII/CdII [30]), although the source of the carbox- ylate groups is different from each other. Herein, the first Ni3(COO)4 subunit was obtained by introducing the btec4– an- ion in the in situ reactions, suggesting that M3(COO)n can be considered as a fundamental subunit upon the controlled con- struction of the MOFs with variable dimensions. Owing to the presence of centrosymmetric btec4– anions, the trinuclear subunits are infinitely extended to generate a 1D rib- bon along the crystallographic b direction (Figure 2). A pair of head-to-tail arranged ptz– ligands doubly link the paralleled ribbons in a tridentate μ3-κ2N1,N5:κ1N2 chelating-bridging Figure 2. 2D layer structure of 1. Y. Feng, E.-C. Yang, M. Fu, X.-J. Zhao ARTICLE Figure 4. Coordination modes of 5-(pyrazinyl)tetrazolate ligand. mode, which leads to the formation of a 2D layer (Figure 2). These layers are then covalently stacked together by the coor- dination bonds of the pyrazinyl N6 of ptz– and Ni1 to produce a robust 3D MOF (Figure 3a). Thus, the ptz– anion in 1 adopts a tetradentate μ4-κ2N1,N5:κ1N2:κ1N6 chelating-bridging mode, which significantly contributes to the extension of the 1D rib- bons to 3D MOF. More interestingly, the tetradentate binding mode presented by the ptz– ion is unprecedented, although six different kinds of coordination modes (μ2-κ2N1,N5, μ2-κ1N1:κ1N3, μ3-κ2N1,N5:κ1N2, μ3-κ2N1,N5:κ1N6, μ4-κ2N1,N5:κ1N3:κ1N6 and μ4-κ1N1:κ1N2:κ1N3:κ1N6, see Figure 4) were observed in previous reports [10–12, 31]. If the [Ni3(H2O)4(COO)4]2+ and ptz– ions are considered as two topologically different nodes, 1 can be simplified as a (3,8)- connected net with the (43)2(46·618·84) topology symbol. And the topological structure is in agreement with the tfz-d net [27]. On the other hand, the (3,8)-connected framework is micropo- rous with 200 Å3 cavity volume when removing the lattice and coordinated water molecules [32]. The resulting solvent-acces- sible cavities were estimated to be 25.3 % of the unit cell vol- ume. Thermal Stability and Luminescent Properties Although the 3D framework of 1 can be considered as trinu- clear [Ni3(H2O)4(btec)]2+ cations linked by ptz– anions, the thermogravimetric measurements (see Figure 5) indicate that there are no direct connections between the two subunits ([Ni3(H2O)4(btec)]2+ cation and ptz– anion). Compound 1 loses its lattice and coordinated water molecules from room tempera- ture to 258 °C (expt. 16.0 %, calcd. 17.5 %), accompanying an obviously endothermic effect. And the mixed organic ligands, ptz– and btec4– anions, are removed between 367 °C and 463 °C, accompanying the collapse of the 3D framework of 1. The final residue is calculated to be NiO (expt. 27.1 %, calcd. 25.9 %). To investigate the stability of the framework, com- pound 1 was heated at 270 °C for four hours and afterwards the powder X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out (see Supporting Information Figure S2). The results indicate that the framework of complex 1 does not collapse after the loss of the water molecules. At room temperature, solid 1 exhibits a 256 www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2010, 253–257 considerably intense luminescence emission at 421 nm upon excitation at 370 nm (see Figure 6), which is similar to the intraligand charge transfer of the ptz– ligand [10, 31c].

Conclusions In conclusion, the first mixed-ligand 3D MOF with unusual linear trinuclear NiII as core subunit, {[Ni3(H2O)4- A Trinuclear NiII-based MOF with μ4-κ2N1,N5:κ1N2:κ1N6 Binding Mode (ptz)2(btec)]·4H2O}n, was successfully obtained by introducing H4btec as co-ligands into the traditionally hydrothermal in situ synthesis of tetrazolyl ligands. Unexpectedly, the ptz– ligand in 1 adopts an unique μ4-κ2N1,N5: κ1N2:κ1N6 binding mode and significantly contributes to the 3D periodic extension of the high-dimensional framework.
