Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/asia.200700209 A Zeolite-Like Zinc PhosphonoACHTUNGTRENUNGcarboxylate Framework and Its ACHTUNGTRENUNGTransformation into Two- and ACHTUNGTRENUNGThree-Dimensional Structures Zhenxia Chen, Yaming Zhou, Linhong Weng, Chao Yuan, and Dongyuan Zhao*[a] Introduction Open-framework inorganic materials represented by alumi- nosilicates and metal phosphates have been intensely inves- tigated owing to their structural diversity.[1,2] Their structures are constructed by polyhedral centers of relatively small size, which limits the pore size of these inorganic materials. The demand for developing materials with large pores has led to increasing interest in the design of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) that contain organic functional link- ers.[3,4] The decoration and expansion of the topologies of zeolites has been proven to be an effective and powerful synthetic strategy for zeolite-like MOFs.[5–7] The preparation of zeolite-like metal phosphonate frameworks by expanding phosphate tetrahedrons with phosphonocarboxylates is somewhat difficult, although some progress has been made in the construction of microporous metal phosphonate mate- rials.[8] One requirement for metal phosphonates with such topology is that all metal ions and phosphonic acids must be rigidly four-connected. This results in a structure similar to the (4,2)-connected topology of zeolites. Until now, only two metal phosphonocarboxylates with the topology of zeolites have been reported, namely, Zn(O3PC2H4COOH)·1.5H2O[9] and Na[Zn(O3PC2H4COO)]·H2O;[10] however, no porosity has been discovered in either material. To prepare porous metal phosphonates, the rigid aromatic carboxylate-type ligands, which have been extensively em- ployed in the preparation of large-pore MOF materials,[11–13] were adopted in the reactions. We used an aromatic phos- phonocarboxylic acid, 4-phosphonobenzoic acid (H3pbc), prepared as shown in Scheme 1, as a building unit based on the following considerations: 1) This ligand has a rigid con- formation and usually behaves as a four-connected unit that can result in structures with the zeolite topology. 2) The co- ordination between metal ions and phosphonocarboxylates tends to create infinite secondary building units (SBUs), in- Abstract: Three zinc phosphonocar- boxylates, Zn2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(pbc)2·Hdma·H3O·2H2O (1), ZnACHTUNGTRENUNG(pbc)·Hdma (2), and Zn4.5 ACHTUNGTRENUNG(pbc)3(OH)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)0.5·Hdma (3) (H3pbc=4-phosphonobenzoic acid, dma=dimethylamine) were synthe- sized by the mixed solvothermal reac- tion of Zn(Ac)2·2H2O and 4-phospho- nobenzoic acid in N,N-dimethylforma- mide (DMF) and water. The zigzag and ladderlike chains completely con- structed by triply fused 4-membered rings (denoted SBU-1) are linked by the organic moieties to form the 3D zeolite-like structure 1 and the layered structure 2, respectively. As for struc- ture 3, a new second building unit (SBU-2) formed by the inset of the [Zn3O12] trimer into the 4-membered ring as well as SBU-1 is observed. The connections between the two types of SBUs lead to a “zinc phosphate” layer, which is linked by the organic groups to generate a 3D pillar-layered struc- ture. Both solution-mediated and solid- state transformations of 1 to 2 and 3 were observed. A possible mechanism for the transformation is proposed. Gas sorption studies show that 1 has acces- sible pores for methanol and water and exhibits size selectivity for alcohols.

The monomeric Zn2P2 four-membered rings (4- MRs)[14] or Al2P2 1D chains[15] were proposed as the progen- itors of 2D and 3D frameworks based on hydrolysis and condensation. If a phosphonic acid (HOOC-C6H4-PO3H2) instead of phosphoric acid reacts with [Zn2+], the pathway may be applicable to MOFs and other metal phosphonate systems; this process remains an unknown field. Although H3pbc has been used for the synthesis of calci- um and strontium compounds, structural studies based on powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that all those compounds have 1D struc- tures.[16,17] It is mainly the high coordination affinity of Ca2+ and Sr2+ ions that makes it dif- ficult for one to build a zeolite- like (4,2)-connected topology. In this paper, we used a typical four-connected Zn2+ ion as a tetrahedral unit, and the 3D zeolite-like open framework Zn2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(pbc)2·Hdma·H3O·2H2O (1; dma=dimethylamine) was suc- cessfully synthesized under mixed solvothermal conditions. Two other zinc phosphonocar- boxylates, ZnACHTUNGTRENUNG(pbc)·Hdma (2) and Zn4.5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(pbc)3(OH)- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)0.5·Hdma (3), were ob- tained by the prolonged reaction of 1. Remarkably, both so- lution-mediated and solid-state transformations of 1 to 2 and 3 were observed. Framework 1 exhibits accessible pores with high adsorption ability for water and size selectivity for alcohols. Results and Discussion Synthesis and Structures Compound 1 was prepared by the mixed solvothermal reac- tion of Zn(Ac)2·2H2O and H3pbc with a low ratio of 0.5–1 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and water at 1708C for 48 h. Single-crystal XRD measurements (Table 1) reveal that structure 1 consists of zigzag chains formed by alternat- ing corner-shared ZnO4 and O3PC tetrahedrons that are cross-linked by pbc to generate a 3D zeolite-like open framework. The framework of 1 contains two crystallo- graphically unique zinc atoms and two pbc3 anions. Zn1 is tetrahedrally coordinated to two PO3 oxygen atoms and two carboxylate oxygen atoms from four different pbc ligands. On the other hand, Zn2 is coordinated to four phosphonate oxygen atoms. Both pbc3 ions coordinate to four Zn atoms through three phosphonate oxygen atoms and one carboxyl- ate oxygen atom, thus leaving the other carboxylate oxygen atom uncoordinated. The connectivity between the ZnO4 and O3PC tetrahedrons gives rise to 4-MRs, which are con- nected edgewise to form a 1D zigzag chain along the b axis (Figure 1a). Each chain is linked with four neighboring chains by organic pillars along the a and c axes to result in a 3D open framework (Figure 1b). Large intersected channels of size 10.58L15.41 and 8.58L12.91 M2 (estimated by meas- uring the distances between the centers of opposite atoms; hereafter, all dimensions are reported in this way) were ob- Abstract in Chinese: Table 1.

KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Asian J. 2007, 2, 1549 – 1554 FULL PAPERS served along the b and c axes, respectively. The solvent, DMF, is partly decomposed to dma, which acts as a struc- ture-directing agent; these molecules are protonated and lo- cated in the channels with water. Calculations performed with PLATON[18] showed that the effective volume for the inclusion is 2668.1 M3 per unit cell, which is about 46.4% of the crystal volume. Structure 1 exhibits a zeolitic (4,2)-connected framework in which the Zn and P centers occupy vertices of the net- work, and the two-connected connectors are the O atom and the C6H4-C-O pillar. Therefore, the 3D structure can be described as a (4,8) sheet packed along the c axis or a (4,6) sheet packed along the a axis, both as ABAB sequences. Figure 1c and d show schematic views of the 2D (4.8) and (4,6) sheets in 1, respectively. The frame- work of 1 with such a specific connectivity represents a topology that has not yet been observed in structures of molecular sieves. Relative to the known metal phos- phonocarboxylates Zn(O3PC2H4COOH)·1.5H2O[9] and Na[Zn(O3PC2H4COO)]·H2O,[10] which are constructed by thick inorganic layers connected to flexible organic ligands, our structure 1 contains significantly larger intersected chan- nels, which are underpropped by the rigid benzene-ring li- gands. The zigzag chains in structure 1 is similar to those found in the large-pore aluminophosphate JDF-20[19,20] and some zinc phosphates.[21,22] As the latter were shown to undergo transformation into other structures, this observation prompted us to investigate the transformation of 1 under various conditions. Thus, structures 2 and 3 were obtained as single-crystal phases (Table 1) by the prolonged solvother- mal reaction of 1. When the Zn(Ac)2·2H2O/H3pbc ratio was lowered to 0.25, a mixture of 1 and 2 was obtained. The pure phase of 2 could be obtained at a Zn(Ac)2·2H2O/H3pbc ratio of 1 after a long reaction time of 120 h. Structure 2 also shows a (4,2)-connected framework. However, the 4- MRs similar to those in 1 are connected to form ladderlike chains, which are linked together by the organic parts to generate a 2D layer in the bc plane (Figure 2a). The 2D layers stack in an AAAA arrangement along the a axis, and the protonated dma molecules occupy the interlayer space and interact with the framework through hydrogen bonds (Figure 2b). In the same Zn(Ac)2·2H2O/H3pbc/DMF/H2O synthesis system, when the Zn(Ac)2/H3pbc ratio was as high as 1.5–3, compound 3 was obtained. When the ratio was kept at 1, compound 3 was the product at the high temperature of 2008C. Interestingly, product 3 was also obtained by heating 1 or 2 in water and DMF at 2008C, or by treating 1 with Zn(Ac)2·2H2O in water and DMF at 1708C for 48 h. XRD measurements showed that heating crystals of 1 at 2008C under vacuum for several hours also resulted in 3 in powder Figure 1. a) Zigzag chain formed by ZnO4 and CPO3 tetrahedrons in structure 1.

Therefore, we concluded that both solution-mediated and solid-state transformations from 1 to 3 can occur. Unlike structures 1 and 2, compound 3 shows a pillar-lay- ered structure. The inorganic layer of 3 is composed of not only ZnO4 and CPO3 tetrahedral units, but also of ZnO5 and ZnO6 polyhedral units. Distorted triple 4-MRs (denoted SBU-1) formed by four ZnO4 and four CPO3 tetrahedrons (Figure 3a) were observed. Furthermore, a Zn3O12 core is formed by edge sharing of two ZnO5 square pyramids and one ZnO6 octahedron. The Zn3O12 trimeric core is then inset into the 4-MRs by four three-coordinate oxygen atoms, thus resulting in another building unit (named SBU-2) (Fig- ure 3b). Each SBU-1 unit connects with four SBU-2 units by three-coordinate oxygen atoms to give an infinite inor- ganic layer. The connectivity gives rise to 6-MRs and 12- membered ellipse-shaped apertures within the layer (Fig- ure 3c). The pbc ligands act as pillars that link the adjacent layers with an interlayer spacing of 10.1 M. The arrangement of these layers is of type AAAA, which results in a straight 1D channel along the a axis. Structural Relationship and Solution-Mediated Transformation The inorganic blocks in structures 1–3 are closely related as illustrated in Figure 4, based on consideration of the tetrahe- dral units (T atoms). Starting from a commonly observed 4- MR constructed by alternating 2-T1 (Zn atoms) and 2-T2 (P atoms) (Figure 4a), two such rings can link together to form a structure of triply fused 4-MRs (SBU-1; Figure 4b), which may condense further to give zigzag chains (Figure 4, 1) or ladders (Figure 4, 2) along two directions. With an increase in reaction time, two connected triply fused 4-MR units in 1 could cleave and reconnect by double Zn–O–P linkages to generate the ladderlike chains observed in structure 2. This rearrangement may result in the transformation of 1 into 2. In the case of structure 3, the incorporation of trimeric zinc oxide leads to the breakdown of the 4-MR, thus resulting in another building unit (SBU-2; Figure 4c). Those new build- ing units connect with SBU-1 to form the inorganic layer of structure 3 (Figure 4, 3). It is speculated that the solution- mediated transformation of 1 into 2 and 3 involves decom- position and reformation. A key feature in this evolution is the existence of SBU-1 in all these structures. The role of SBU-1 is similar to that of the highly reactive species isolat- ed in the synthesis of metal phosphates.[22,23] The results of the solution transformation confirm that structure 1 is a dy- namically controlled phase, which can transform into meta- stable phase 2 and thermodynamically stable phase 3. To the best of our knowledge, such a transformation has not been observed in the synthesis of metal phosphonates before. Figure 3.

Asian J. 2007, 2, 1549 – 1554 FULL PAPERS D. Zhao et al. Solid-State Transformation and Thermal Stability It is surprising that structure 1 can be turned into the pillar- layered structure 3 by a heat-induced solid-state transforma- tion. In situ powder XRD patterns obtained at increasing temperatures (Figure 5) show that structure 1 can be re- tained after heating at 1008C, and that the structural trans- formation from 1 to 3 occurs at 2008C, because the experi- mental XRD pattern of compound 1 at 2008C matches that simulated from the single-crystal data of structure 3. As shown in Figure 5, structure 3 can be stable up to 4008C. It then collapses to form an amorphous phase and recrystalliz- es to yield condensed b-Zn2P2O7 (No. PDF: 390711) after heating at above 5008C. XRD measurements showed that the solid-state transformation could not be observed be- tween the anhydrous structure 2 and 3, thus suggesting that crystalline water plays an important role in the structural transformation. It is speculated that the transformation be- tween 1 and 3 undergoes a quasi-solvent-mediated recrystal- lization process, in which the little amount of water present acts as a solvent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) provides the further evidence for the solid-state transformation. Structure 1 showed distinct weight losses of 3.3 wt% for up to 1008C, which corresponds to removal of the adsorbed water, 12.0 wt% at 200–3508C, which corresponds to the departure of crystalline water and dimethylamine in the process of structural transformation, and 35.3 wt% at 350–6308C, which is caused by the collapse of structure 3 and decom- posed pbc molecules. No weight loss occurred below 2508C for structure 2 and 3608C for structure 3, which suggests that both 2 and 3 have a higher stability than 1. Adsorption Properties Methanol, ethanol, and water were used as probe molecules to acquire the adsorption isotherms at 298 K. The methanol adsorption isotherm of structure 1 reveals a typical type-I curve for microporous materials (Figure 6), thus suggesting microporosity. However, the water adsorption isotherm is a little different from that of methanol: it shows a weaker in- teraction with the framework than methanol. XRD patterns after adsorption show that the framework retains its rigidity even throughout the process. The maximum amount ad- sorbed onto 1 is 63 mgg1 for MeOH and 66 mgg1 for H2O at P/P0=0.9, which are equivalent to the adsorption of about 1.2 MeOH and 2.3 H2O molecules per formula unit. The Langmuir surface area is estimated to be 213 m2g1, which is comparable to those for zeolites with smaller pores. The ethanol adsorption measurement shows an isotherm similar to that for nonporous behavior, which indicates that 1 exhibits selectivity toward the size of the guest. Conclusions Three zinc phosphonocarboxylates have been successfully synthesized by using 4-phosphonobenzoic acid as a ligand under solvothermal conditions. Single-crystal X-ray structur- al measurements revealed that their structures are zeolite- like (1), layered (2), and pillar-layered (3). Structure 1 is constructed by the triply fused 4-MRs (SBU-1) to form a 3D organic–inorganic hybrid framework. Structure 2 also contains SBU-1 units with ladderlike chains linked by the organic group to form a 2D layer structure. Structure 3 is constructed by SBU-2 with ZnO4, ZnO5, and ZnO6 poly- hedrons as well as SBU-1. The structural transformations between them were observed after solution-mediated and thermal treatments, which would help in the understanding of the evolution of metal phosphonates. Adsorption meas- urements showed that 1 exhibits accessible channels for methanol and water and size selectivity for alcohols. Figure 5.

After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the resulting precipi- tate of 4-(diethoxyphosphoryl)benzoic acid ethyl ester was filtered off and then hydrolyzed in aqueous HCl for 10 h to give H3pbc (68.2 wt%) as colorless crystals.

For a typical preparation, Zn(Ac)2·2H2O/H3pbc/DMF/water (molar ratio 1:1:64.9:278) was heated at 1708C for 48 h in a teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (33 mL). The pure single-crystal phase of 2 was prepared in 73.4% yield by heating Zn(Ac)2·2H2O/H3pbc/DMF/water (1:1:64.9:278) at 1708C for 120 h. Crys- tals of 2 were also obtained as a mixed phase with 1 by reaction of Zn(Ac)2·2H2O/H3pbc/DMF/water (0.25:1:64.9:278) at 1708C for 48 h. Crystals of 3 were obtained in 72.3% yield from Zn(Ac)2·2H2O/H3pbc/ DMF/water (1.5–3:1:64.9:278) at 1708C after 48 h. Compound 3 was also prepared by heating the initial mixture of 1 at 2008C for 48 h, by heating crystals of 1 (0.158 g) with water (2.5 mL) and DMF (2.5 mL) at 2008C for 48 h, or by adding Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (0.081 g) to a mixture of crystals of 1 (0.165 g) with water (2.5 mL) and DMF (2.5 mL) at 1708C for 48 h. Measurements IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets by the use of a Nicolet FT- IR 360 spectrometer at 4000–400 cm1. TGA was performed on a MET- TLER TOLEPO TGA/SDTA851 analyzer in air with a heating rate of 5 Kmin1 from 30 to 9008C. Powder XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D4 diffractometer with CuKa radiation (l=1.5418 M). Thermodif- fractometric experiments were performed on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with CuKa radiation. A small amount of powder was deposited on a Pt strip electrically connected to heating resistances. XRD patterns were collected in air from room temperature to 6008C. Elemental analysis was carried out on an Elementar Vario EL III microanalyzer. The sorption isotherms for methanol, ethanol, and water were recorded with an auto- matic gravimetric adsorption apparatus (IGA-003 series, Hiden Isochema Ltd.) at 298 K. The samples synthesized (30–50 mg) were dried under high vacuum at 373 K for 12 h prior to measurements. X-ray Crystallography Suitable single crystals of H3pbc, 1, 2, and 3 were subjected to XRD stud- ies on a Bruker Smart APEX diffractometer equipped with a normal- focus 2.4-kW sealed-tube X-ray source (MoKa radiation, l=0.71073 M) operating at 50 kV and 30 mA. A hemisphere of intensity data was col- lected at room temperature with a scan width of 0.608 in w. Empirical ab- sorption corrections were based on the SADABS program.[24] The struc- tures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least- squares refinement with the SHELXTL-97 program.[25] The positions of all non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement fac- tors. Hydrogen atoms were positioned geometrically and refined by using a riding model. Crystallographic data for H3pbc, 1, 2, and 3 are summar- ized in Table 1.
