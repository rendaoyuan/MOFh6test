Rogers,[a] Erika J. Glatz,[a] and Robert L. LaDuca*[a] Keywords: Nickel; Copper; Coordination polymer; Crystal structure; Water aggregation Abstract. Hydrothermal reaction of the requisite metal nitrate, carb- oxycinnamic acid (H2cca), and the long-spanning dipyridylamide bis(4-pyridylformyl)piperazine (4-bpfp) generate crystalline coordina- tion polymers whose topology depends critically on the metal coordi- nation geometric preference. These two new phases were structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. {[Cu(cca)(4- bpfp)]·2.5H2O}n (1) manifests a non-interpenetrated 6-connected pcu net based on chain motifs featuring carboxylate-bridged {Cu2(OCO)2} Introduction The synthesis and characterization of crystalline metal-or- ganic coordination polymers remains a very active field of modern research in inorganic chemistry. In addition to their significant utilitarian potential in hydrogen storage,[1] molecu- lar separation,[2] CO2 sequestration,[3] catalysis,[4] and security applications,[5] the aesthetics of coordination polymer structure and topology continues to be a driving force for exploratory synthesis.[6] Except in a few limited systems, a priori structure prediction for this class of materials remains an elusive goal.[7] Aromatic dicarboxylates have proven to be a most effi- cacious choice for the linking agents necessary for the self- assembly of coordination polymers, as they provide both a ri- gid backbone for framework stability and the requisite charge balance. The inclusion of neutral dipyridyl coligands such as the rigid-rod tether 4,4-bipyridine (bpy) or longer and kinked variants has not only enhanced the topological scope of this class of solid state compounds, but produced some phases with intriguing multifunctional properties. For example, the 3D in- terpenetrated material [Zn(terephthalate)(bpy)0.5]n can adsorb significant amounts of CO2,[3] serving as proof of concept for the potential use of coordination polymers towards successful trapping of atmospheric gases implicated in climate change. Other cases with more limited physical property utility can still exhibit striking topological features such as self-penetration.[8] * Dr. R. L.

Variable temperature magnetic studies performed on 1 revealed very weak antiferromagnetic coupling within its dinuclear units. Thermal properties of these two new materials are also discussed. One such example is [Cd(Hpht)2(bpy)]n (pht = phthalate), which possesses a 6-connected 3D self-penetrated 510647 topo- logical network constructed from the dipyridyl linkage of a diamondoid [Cd(Hpht)2]n sublattice.[9] Adjustment of the di- pyridyl component can induce significant structural changes, for instance in {[Cd(pht)(dpa)(H2O)]·4H2O}n, which shows a unique 7482 self-penetrated yyz topology based on helical mo- tifs.[10] The dipyridylamide ligand bis(4-pyridylformyl)piperazine (4-bpfp, Scheme 1) has structure-directing advantages over the shorter bpy analog or its related congener 4-bpmp (bis(4-pyr- idylmethyl)piperazine). Although similar in span to 4-bpmp, 4-bpfp can serve as a hydrogen bonding acceptor or an oxygen atom donor in coordination polymers due to the carbonyl groups absent in its congener 4-bpmp.[11] Conformational flex- ibility of the 4-bpfp ligand, defined by the central O···N···N···O torsion angle Ψ (Ψ = 0° for syn, Ψ = 180° = anti), can result in different metal–metal contact distances. {[Co(pht)(4- bpfp)(H2O)2]·H2O}n displayed acentric (4,4) grid layers, whereas {[Cu2(pht)2(4-bpfp)(H2O)2]n exhibited bpfp formyl group binding and a previously unreported 4,4-connected bi- nodal layer structure. {[Cd2(pht)2(4-bpfp)(H2O)2]n manifested a 3D structure built from pillaring of [Cd(pht)(H2O)]n layers Scheme 1.

[Cd(cca)(bpy)]n possesses a (4,4) grid 2D layer built from [Cd2(cca)2] double chains pillared by bpy ligands,[12] while use of the longer bis(4-pyridylmethyl)piperazine (4-bpmp) ligand produced the (6,3) herringbone layered phase {[Cd(cca)(4-bpmp)(H2O)]· 2H2O}n.[13] [Cd(cca)(4-bpfp)]n manifests a {Cd2(OCO)2} di- mer-based 6-connected 41263 pcu 3D network,[13] different from the 2D topologies seen in the bpy and 4-bpmp cases. The π bond within the long carboxylate arm of cca also proved susceptible to in situ reaction chemistry under hydrothermal conditions, likely via nucleophilic attack at antibonding π* or- bitals. Reaction of divalent metal nitrates with H2cca and 3- pyridylisonicotinamide (3-pina) caused in situ rearrangement of the acid precursor to the anionic lactone 1,3-dihydro-3-oxo- 1-isobenzofuranacetate (dibf), with formation of an iso- structural series of (4,4) grid coordination polymers [M(3- pina)2(dibf)2]n (M = Zn, Cd, Co, Mn, Ni).[14] Scheme 2. Binding modes of the cca ligands in 1 and 2. We thus hoped to probe the structural chemistry and possible in situ reaction chemistry of other divalent metal cca coordina- tion polymers containing the conformationally flexible 4-bpfp ligand. In this article we report the synthesis, single-crystal structural characterization, and thermal degradation behavior of two new coordination polymers, {[Cu(cca)(4- bpfp)]·2.5H2O}n (1) and {[Ni(cca)(4-bpfp)(H2O)2]·3H2O}n (2), along with the variable temperature magnetic properties of 1. The resulting topology of these 3D coordination polymer phases show a marked dependence on coordination environ- ment preference, including the presence of any bound water molecules on the divalent metal ion. Experimental Section General Considerations: Metal nitrates and 2-carboxycinnamic acid were commercially obtained. The dipyridylamide ligand bis(4-pyr- idylformyl)piperazine (4-bpfp) was prepared by a literature pro- cedure.[15] Water was deionized above 3 MΩ per cm in-house. Elemen- tal analysis was carried out with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS/ O Analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on powdered samples with a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One instrument. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed with a TA Instruments Q50 thermal analyzer in a flow- ing nitrogen atmosphere. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2015, 1560–1565 © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1561 data for 1 (2 K to 300 K) were collected on a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID magnetometer at an applied field of 0.1 T. After each tempera- ture change the sample was kept at the new temperature for 5 min before magnetization measurement to ensure thermal equilibrium. The susceptibility data was corrected for diamagnetism using Pascal’s con- stants,[16] and for the diamagnetism of the polyethylene sample holder. Powder X-ray diffraction on ground samples of 1 and 2 for phase purity verification were obtained via Θ–2Θ scans performed with a Rigaku Rotaflex instrument. Preparation of {[Cu(cca)(4-bpfp)]·2.5H2O}n (1): Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (32 mg, 0.14 mmol), 4-bpfp (42 mg, 0.14 mmol), and 2-carboxycin- namic acid (27 mg, 0.14 mmol) were mixed with 5 mL of distilled H2O in a 15 mL glass vial. Aqueous NaOH solution (0.5 mL, 1.0 m) was added to encourage deprotonation of the 2-carboxycinnamic acid. The vial was sealed, heated in an oil bath at 85 °C for 24 h, and cooled slowly to 25 °C. Blue crystals of 1 (38 mg, 46% yield based on Cu) were isolated after washing with distilled water, ethanol, and acetone and drying in air. C26H27CuN4O8.5: calcd.

X-ray Crystallography: Diffraction data for 1 and 2 were collected with a Bruker-AXS SMART-CCD X-ray diffractometer using graphite- monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The data were pro- cessed via SAINT,[17] and subjected to Lorentz effect, polarization ef- fect and absorption corrections using SADABS.[18] The structures were solved by direct methods with SHELXTL[19] using the OLEX2 soft- ware suite.[20] All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and refined iso- tropically with a riding model. Crystallographic details for 1 and 2 are given in Table 1.

Results and Discussion Synthesis and Infrared Spectroscopy Compounds 1 and 2 were prepared cleanly by hydrothermal reaction of the requisite metal nitrate, 2-carboxycinnamic acid, and 4-bpfp in the presence of aqueous base. Phase purity was indicated by powder XRD spectra (Figures S1 and S2, Sup- porting Information) that matched well with calculated spectra based on the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Infrared spectra were consistent with the structural components as de- termined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Broad, weak bands at ca. 3300 cm–1 signify the O–H bonds in the water molecules of crystallization. Weaker, high energy bands at 3000–3200 cm–1 are assigned to C–H bond stretching modes in all cases. Asymmetric and symmetric C–O stretching modes of the cca ligand carboxylate groups are marked by slightly broadened bands at 1557 cm–1 and 1363 cm–1 (1) and 1536 cm–1 and 1366 cm–1 (2). Sharp, medium intensity bands in the range of 1600 cm–1 to 1200 cm–1 are attributed to the stretching modes of the pyridyl rings of the 4-bpfp ligands.[21] Features corresponding to pyridyl and aryl ring puckering are observed in the region between 800 cm–1 and 600 cm–1. Sharp, moderate intensity bands at 1632 cm–1 and 1621 cm–1 denotes the C=O stretching bands within the amide moieties of the 4- bpfp ligands for 1 and 2, possibly overlapped with the tradi- tional C=C stretching bands provided by the long cca carb- oxylate arm.

Structural Description of {[Cu(cca)(4-bpfp)]·2.5H2O}n (1) The asymmetric unit of compound 1 contains a divalent cop- per atom, a fully deprotonated cca ligand, halves of two crys- tallographically distinct 4-bpfp ligands whose piperazinyl ring centroids are situated over inversion centers (bpfp-A, bpfp-B), and net two-and-one-half water molecules of crystallization. A distorted square pyramidal {CuO3N2} coordination environ- ment is observed at copper (Figure 1), with an Addison t value[22] of 0.408 indicating a significant variance from ideal- ized geometry tending towards a trigonal bipyramidal arrange- ment of donors. Pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from one bpfp- A ligand and one bpfp-B ligand occupy trans coordination sites in the basal plane. The other trans positions are taken up by a short-arm carboxylate oxygen donor atom from a cca li- gand, and a long-arm carboxylate oxygen atom from another cca ligand. The Jahn-Teller elongated apical position is filled by a long-arm carboxylate oxygen atom donor from a third cca ligand. Bond lengths and angles within the coordination environment at copper in 1 are listed in Table 2. Figure 1. {CuO3N2} square-pyramidal coordination environment in 1.

The cca ligands in 1 adopt a η3-κ3O:O:O exotridentate binding mode, with pairs of long carboxylate arms bracketing two copper atoms to form {Cu2(OCO)2} dinuclear units with a Cu···Cu through-space distance of 4.597 Å. Within the dinu- clear units, the cca carboxylate groups bridge a basal coordina- tion site at one copper to a long apical coordination site at the other. The full span of the cca ligands connects adjacent Journal of Inorganic and General Chemistry Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie www.zaac.wiley-vch.de ARTICLE {Cu2(OCO)2} dinuclear units into [Cu(cca)]n coordination polymer chain motifs arranged parallel to the a crystal axis (Figure 2). The longest through-ligand Cu···Cu distance of 9.998 Å thus matches the a lattice parameter. Figure 2. Dimer-containing [Cu2(cca)2]n coordination polymer chain motif in 1. Each [Cu(cca)]n chain motif, with embedded dinuclear units, connects to four other chain motifs via the tethering bpfp-A and bpfp-B ligands, which span Cu···Cu distances of 16.154 and 16.122 Å, respectively. Both bpfp ligands adopt an anti conformation, with the Ψ torsion angle in both cases being symmetry restricted 180° due to the presence of inversion cen- ters. By these dipyridylamide linkers, a [Cu(cca)(4-bpfp)]n 3- D coordination polymer net is constructed (Figure 3). Treating the dinuclear units as connecting nodes results in a 6-con- nected net with a common 41263 pcu “primitive cubic” top- ology (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Solvent-accessible voids comprising 11.5% of the unit cell volume according to PLATON[23] contain D(5) classification discrete water mo- lecule chains (Figure S4).[24] These are anchored to the coordi- nation polymer network by donating hydrogen bonds to 4-bpfp carbonyl oxygen atoms and cca carboxylate oxygen atoms. The lack of 4-bpfp carbonyl binding and aqua ligands in 1 prevents formation of the 2D binodal net seen in the previously reported copper phthalate derivative {[Cu2(pht)2(4- bpfp)(H2O)2]n.[11] Figure 3.

KGaA, Weinheim 1563 Structural Description of {[Ni(cca)(4-bpfp)(H2O)2]·3H2O}n (2) Compound 2 crystallizes in the acentric orthorhombic space group P21212 with the Flack parameter[25] of –0.013(14) indi- cating enantiomeric purity within the crystal, within experi- mental error. The asymmetric unit of compound 2 contains a divalent nickel atom, a cca ligand, a full 4-bpfp ligand, two bound water molecules, and net three water molecules of crystallization. Unlike the distorted square-pyramidal coordi- nation sphere seen in the copper derivative 1, the nickel atoms in adopt a slightly distorted octahedral {NiO4N2} coordination environment (Figure 4). The two aqua ligands are disposed in a cis fashion, as are pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from two different 4-bpfp ligands. The remaining two trans coordination sites are taken up by an oxygen atom donor from a short cca carboxylate arm, and an long carboxylate oxygen atom from another cca ligand. Bond lengths and angles within the coordi- nation sphere in 2 are listed in Table 3. Figure 4. {NiO4N2} coordination environment in 2. Thermal ellipsoids are drawn at 50% probability.

Bis(monodentate) cca ligands link adjacent nickel ions into [Ni(cca)(H2O)2]n chain motifs oriented along a (Figure 5a), with a Ni···Ni through-ligand distance of 8.013 Å. Nickel atoms are along connected by 4-bpfp ligands along the b crys- tal direction into undulating [Ni(4-bpfp)]n chain motifs (Fig- ure 5b). The linking 4-bpfp ligands adopt a slightly skewed anti conformation (Ψ torsion angle = 166°), and span a Ni···Ni distance of 16.137 Å. This twisted, locked 4-bpfp conforma- tion prevents the location of crystallographic inversion centers within the piperazinyl rings, and thereby enforces the observed acentricity. The two distinct chain motifs intersect to construct a full 3D [Ni(cca)(4-bpfp)(H2O)2]n coordination polymer net- Journal of Inorganic and General Chemistry Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie www.zaac.wiley-vch.de ARTICLE work. Large apertures within this net (ca. 18 Å19 Å) allow interpenetration of a second identical network (Figure S5, Sup- porting Information). Figure 5. (a) [Ni(cca)(H2O)2]n coordination polymer chain motif in 2. (b) [Ni(4-bpfp)]n coordination polymer chain motif in 2. An analysis performed with TOPOS[26] software revealed the presence of a twofold interpenetrated 66 diamondoid net topology in 2 (Figure 6). Incipient solvent-accessible voids comprising 14.5% of the unit cell volume contain isolated water molecules and hydrogen-bonded water molecule aggre- gations of five molecules each. In contrast to the straight chain D(5) classification water aggregation seen in 1, those in 2 adopt a R(4)A(1) classification water molecule ring motif (Fig- ure S6, Supporting Information). These are anchored to the coordination polymer network by donating hydrogen bonds to both unligated cca carboxylate oxygen atoms and 4-bpfp for- myl groups. Although the analogous cadmium coordination polymer [Cd(cca)(4-bpfp)]n also shows {MO4N2} octahedral coordination environment similar to that of 2,[13] its lack of aqua ligands encourages formation of {Cd2(OCO)2} dimeric units and a non-interpenetrated pcu topology similar to 1, in- stead of the twofold interpenetrated diamondoid net of 2. The 3D structure of 2 also contrasts with the 2D layered structure Figure 6. Schematic perspective of the twofold interpenetrated dia- mondoid network topology of 2.

KGaA, Weinheim 1564 of {[Co(pht)(4-bpfp)(H2O)2]·H2O}n,[11] although {MO4N2} octahedral coordination arrangements are present in both. Cis disposition of the bound water molecules in the nickel cca de- rivative, as opposed to trans disposition in the previously re- ported cobalt phase, is the likely source of the preference of 3D structure of 2. Here, the linking ligands are not arranged in a single plane as a result. Variable Temperature Magnetic Susceptibility of 1 Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were undertaken for 1 to probe spin communication within the {Cu2(OCO)2} dimers. The data over the entire temperature range fit the Curie-Weiss law (Figure S7, Supporting Infor- mation), with C = 0.370 cm3·K·mol–1 and a Weiss constant Θ value of –2.1 K denoting likely weak antiferromagnetic cou- pling. For 1, the χmT value at 300 K was 0.373 cm3·K·mol–1, close to the value expected for an uncoupled S = 1/2 spin with g = 2. The χmT value decreased very slowly to 0.362 cm3·K·mol–1 by 100 K, 0.348 cm3·K·mol–1 by 42 K, and 0.343 cm3·K·mol–1 at 2 K. The profile of the χmT vs. T curve thus shows extremely weak antiferromagnetic coupling within the {Cu2(OCO)2} dimeric units, likely mediated by the nearly orthogonal overlap between dx2–y2 magnetic orbitals via the axial-equatorial bridging carboxylate binding mode of the cca carboxylate groups.[27] The data was fit to the standard Bleaney-Bowers Equation [Equation (1)] for a Heisenberg iso- tropic pair of S = 1/2 ions.[28] The best fit to the data (Figure S8) yielded g = 1.944(4), and J = –0.3(1) cm–1, with R = 8.0410–5 = {Σ[(χmT)obs – (χmT)calc]2/Σ[(χmT)obs]2}. The very slightly negative value of J corroborates the contention of very weak antiferromagnetic superexchange within the dimeric units of 1. χmT = Ng2β2 k[3 + exp(–J/kt)] (1) Thermal Properties Compound 1 underwent dehydration between 25 °C and 50 °C, with a mass loss of 5.3%. The difference between this value and the calculated mass loss of 7.6% indicates the some co-crystallized water was lost on standing. The ligand combus- tion occurred above 210 °C. Loss of co-crystallized and bound water molecules for 2 occurred between 100 °C and 170 °C, as marked by a mass loss of 12.8% (14.2% calcd). The ligand combustion occurred above 280 °C. TGA traces for 1 and 2 are shown in Figures S9 and S10 (Supporting Information), respectively. Conclusions The particular divalent metal present in three-dimensional coordination polymers containing the ortho-dicarboxylate li- gand 2-carboxycinnamate and the long-spanning dipyridyl- diamide ligand bis(4-pyridylformyl)piperazine plays a signifi- cant role in structure direction, along with the presence or ab- Journal of Inorganic and General Chemistry Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie www.zaac.wiley-vch.de ARTICLE sence of aqua ligands. In the case of square pyramidally coor- dinated copper or octahedrally coordinated cadmium, without aqua ligands, dimeric units with bridged carboxylate groups are formed. In turn these are connected by the cca and 4-bpfp ligands into 6-connected pcu topology networks. Octahedrally coordinated nickel, with two cis-disposed bound water mo- lecules, results in a 4-connected network with a twofold inter- penetrated diamondoid topology and enhanced thermal sta- bility. The unique container environments within apertures in the respective networks permitted trapping of different co- crystallized water molecule clusters comprising five water molecules each, including discrete chain and ring morpho- logies. The 4-bpfp carbonyl groups help to stabilize the dif- ferent water molecule clusters by means of their hydrogen bonding acceptance ability in lieu of ligation to the central metal atoms.
