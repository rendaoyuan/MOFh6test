[Eu(H(OAc)2)3](H2O) (3) crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Introduction Single crystals of rare-earth acetate-hydrates M(OAc)3(H2O)x (OAc  acetate) are quite easily obtained from aqueous solutions by isothermal evaporation of the solvent water. Crystal structures were determined for hy- drates with x  1, 1.5, 3, and 4 [16]. As the relatively large trivalent rare-earth cations afford coordination numbers of at least six and up to twelve, the individual coordination polyhedra which consist of one- or bidentate acetate ions and water molecules, need to be connected. Dimers (x  3, 4), chains (x  1) as well as dimers and chains (x  1.5) have been observed. Water can also act as crystal water fill- ing otherwise empty space in the solid-state structure. Quite a while ago, single crystals of many of the anhy- drous rare-earth acetates could be grown. Crystal structures were determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for the examples of La(OAc)3 with a coordination number * Prof. Dr. G.

The linear chain structure of 1 is modi- fied by the addition of one coordinating water molecule in 2 to a corrugated chain whose packing leaves room for crystal water. In 3 the same dimers are observed as in [Eu2(OAc)6(HOAc)2(H2O)2] (4) itself which had previously been synthesized from an ammonium acetate melt. With a higher acetic acid pressure, four molecules of acetic acid per dimer are included in the structure in 3. Keywords: Europium; Acetate; Acetic acid; Hydrate; Crystal struc- ture of lanthanum(III) of ten (CN(La3)  10 [7]), as well as Pr(OAc)3 (CN(Pr3)  10 and 9 [8]), Ho(OAc)3 (CN(Ho3)  8 [9]), Lu(OAc)3 (CN(Lu3)  7 [7]), and Sc(OAc)3 (CN(Sc3)  6 [10]). Anhydrous europium(III) acetate, Eu(OAc)3, as verified previously, in 1993, from powder X-ray diffraction data alone, crystallizes isotypic with Ho(OAc)3. Eu(OAc)3 (1, monoclinic, C2/c) undergoes a phase transition to the higher symmetrical structure of Sc(OAc)3 (hexagonal, P63/mcm, [10]) at 181 °C and decomposes at 339 °C [9]. Single crystals of the anhydrous europium(III) acetate were now obtained by direct oxidation of europium metal with anhydrous acetic acid at 130 °C in a sealed glass ampoule. A higher concentration of anhydrous acetic acid resulted in the formation of the “hydrogendiacetate” [Eu(H(OAc)2)3](H2O), which is in fact [Eu2(OAc)6- (HOAc)2(H2O)2](HOAc)4, and, under slightly modified conditions, the sesquihydrate [Eu2(OAc)6(H2O)](H2O)2 emerged as single crystals. Experimental Details Eu(OAc)3 (1): 151.9 mg (1 mmol) europium metal (Chempur, 99.9 %) and 0.2 ml (3.5 mmol) of anhydrous acetic acid (100 %) were filled under exclusion of air/humidity in a dry box (argon, MBraun, Garching) in a glass ampoule, acetic acid with the aid of S.

Results and Discussion The action of anhydrous acetic acid (maybe with some water content) on europium metal in sealed glass ampoules with different Eu:CH3COOH ratios yielded single crystals of Eu(OAc)3 (1), Eu(OAc)3(H2O)1.5 (2) and of [Eu(H(OAc)2)3](H2O) (3). 1 and 2 were obtained when a 1:3.5 molar ratio was applied and 3 with a 1:5 molar ratio, all with a maximum temperature of 130 °C. The formation of these compounds may be understood in the following way, with HOAc  acetic acid and AcOAc  acetic anhy- dride: Eu  3 HOAc  Eu(OAc)3  3/2 H2 (1) Eu  3 HOAc  1.5 H2O  Eu(OAc)3(H2O)1.5  3/2 H2 (2a) Eu  6 HOAc  Eu(OAc)3(H2O)1.5  3/2 AcOAc  3/2 H2 (2b) Eu  8 HOAc  [Eu(H(OAc)2)3](H2O)  AcOAc  3/2 H2. (3) Whether equation (2a) or (2b), or a combination of both, tells the truth about the formation of the sesquihydrate, and the “hydrogendiacetate” as well, is not clear. An alternative route, the reaction of previously dried acetates or oxides with a melt of ammonium acetate in sealed glass ampoules at 140 °C had yielded compounds of the composition [M(OAc)3(HOAc)(H2O)] (M  Nd-Ho) (4) and [M(OAc)3(H2O)2](HOAc) (M  Gd-Lu,Y) (5) [15]. These are (formally) mono- and dihydrates of rare-earth acetates with acetic acid in the inner coordination sphere in the for- mer 4 and as crystal-acetic-acid in the latter 5, making clear that water is a stronger ligand than acetic acid. An acetic acid adduct of samarium of the same composition as 5, [Sm(OAc)3(H2O)2](HOAc), both with dimers but with different crystal structures, was obtained by isothermal evaporation of a solution of freshly precipitated Sm(OH)3 in conc. acetic acid. The addition of water to the mother liquor and slow evaporation leads to the tetrahydrate [Sm(OAc)3(H2O)2](H2O)2 [16]. The anhydrous rare-earth acetates M(OAc)3 with M  Sc, Y, Lu-Sm have similar structures which can best be de- rived from that of Sc(OAc)3 [10]. Sc3 as the smallest rare- earth cation is six-coordinate, three bidentate-Z,Z-bridging [17] acetate anions lead to a chain. For M(OAc)3 with M  Lu-Tm, the coordination number is enhanced to seven, one of the bidentate-Z,Z-bridging acetate ligands becomes tri- dentate-bridging, bidentate to one and monodentate to the neighbouring M3 cation [9]. This procedure is repeated for M(OAc)3 with M  Er-Sm, including Y, such that now two bidentate-Z,Z-bridging acetate ligands become tridentate- bridging. The crystal structure was determined from single- Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2006, 19891994 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It was then concluded from powder X-ray diffraction data that Eu(OAc)3 is isostructural. By a different synthetic route, from the oxidation of eu- ropium metal with anhydrous acetic acid, single crystals of Eu(OAc)3 (1) were now obtained (Table 1). Lattice con- stants from previous powder data, a  1118.9(26), b  2918.6(22), c  796.7(18) pm, β  132.2(1)°, and now from single-crystal data, a  1126.0(3), b  2900.5(6), c  799.1(2) pm, β  132.03(2)°, agree sufficiently well. The crystal structure of anhydrous europium(III) acetate may thus be described as follows: Each Eu3 is surrounded by two bidentate-Z,Z-bridging acetate ligands and four tridentate-bridging acetate ligands of which the former contribute twice and the latter six times to the coordination number of eight of any individual of the two crystallographically independent Eu3 central cat- ions. The [EuO8] polyhedra are functionally equal and their individual parameters are very much alike, with mean EuIII-O distances of 242.5 (Eu1-O) and 242.2 pm (Eu2-O), respectively, see for individual values Table 2. The chains 1[Eu(A12/2)2(A23/2)4] (Fig. 1a) run along [001] and are not further connected to each other, bonding between them must be purely dispersive. A1 and A2 stand for the two differently functioning types of ligands. Two chains run parallel to each other and these are surrounded by eight other such chains, see Figure 1b. Two europium(III) acetate-hydrates are, so far, known, the tri- and the tetra-hydrate: In the trihydrate there are two bidentate and one biden- tate-bridging acetate ions attached to the central Eu3 and two of the water molecules, the third is a crystal water molecule, hydrogen-bonded to one of the coordination- water molecule [4]. Through the bridging, dimers are obtained. Eu(OAc)3(H2O)2 may be written as S. Gomez Torres, I. Pantenburg, G. Meyer Fig. 1 Anhydrous Eu(OAc)3 (1): (a) Part of one chain of [Eu1O8] and [Eu2O8] polyhedra connected via tridentate-bridging acetate ligands.

[Eu2(OAc)6(H2O)4](H2O)2 with the coordination around EuIII as follows: [Eu(A12/1)2(A23/2)2(H2O)2/1], hence a coor- dination number of nine. In the tetrahydrate, Eu(OAc)3(H2O)4, the coordination number is also nine, again with two bidentate, one triden- tate-bridging acetate ions and two water molecules consti- tuting dimers in [Eu2(OAc)3(H2O)2](H2O)4. The only major difference is the two crystal water molecules. The crystal structure was determined from single crystal data for M  Gd, Ho, Er [2, 3]. Lower hydrates are, so far, only known with the larger lanthanides, monohydrates M(OAc)3·H2O with M  Ce, Pr, Nd with the formation of chains, and sesquihydrates M(OAc)3·1.5H2O with M  La, Ce, Pr, Nd with both di- mers and chains, see for an overview [6]. From the reaction of europium metal with acetic acid in a sealed ampoule, we have now obtained single crystals of Eu(OAc)3(H2O)1.5 (2), see eq. (2) (ab) above. In this hy- drate the chain structure of Eu(OAc)3 is preserved but one water molecule enhances the coordination number of one out of two symmetrically independent europium atoms to nine such that the compound may be formulated as follows: www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2006, 19891994 1992 [Eu2(OAc)6(H2O)](H2O)2. The coordination number of Eu1 in (2) is nine, <d(Eu1-O)>  244.7 pm for the acetate-oxy- gen atoms plus d(Eu-O010)  239.3 pm for the water mol- ecule. Eu2 is eight-coordinate with <d(Eu2-O)>  241.5 pm. These values are much like those observed in an- hydrous Eu(OAc)3, 242.5 and 242.2 pm, respectively. In contrast to the anhydrous acetate, the chains [Eu2(OAc)6(H2O)](H2O)2 are corrugated with the ad- ditional water ligand pointing up and down. Two water molecules fill as crystal water empty space (Fig. 2). The reaction of europium metal with “excess” anhydrous acetic acid yielded colourless single crystals of, what might be called a hydrogendiacetate, [Eu(H(OAc)2)3](H2O), which should be written as follows, [Eu2(OAc)6(HOAc)2(H2O)2]- (HOAc)4 (3). This compound could be understood as an acetic acid adduct of the still elusive monohydrate of europium(III) acetate. Similar compounds were previously obtained, [M(OAc)3(HOAc)(H2O)] (4), with M  Nd-Ho, the crystal structure was determined for [Nd(OAc)3(HOAc)(H2O)] and [Ho(OAc)3(HOAc)(H2O)] [15]. These are formally acetate-monohydrates with coordinating acetic acid.

The present [Eu2(OAc)6(HOAc)2(H2O)2](HOAc)4 (3) is, therefore, a mix of both, with acetate, acetic acid and water coordinating and acetic acid filling otherwise open space. In contrast to 1 and 2, where linear and corrugated chain structures occur, important features of the crystal structures S. Gomez Torres, I. Pantenburg, G. Meyer Scheme 1 of 3, 4 and 5 are dimers with the central MIII cations nine- coordinate. In 3, these dimers are centrosymmetric, Eu3 cations occupy only one crystallographically independent position (Fig. 3a). It is nine-coordinate with one bidentate (A1), two bidentate-bridging (A2) and two tridentate-bridg- ing (A3) acetate ligands and, additionally one (monodent- ate) acetic acid and one water molecule as ligands, accord- ing to [Eu(A12/1)1(A22/2)2(A23/2)2/2(HOAc)1/1(H2O)1/1]. Eu-O distances are, at the average, 242.8 pm for the acetate- oxygen atoms, d(Eu-O140)  248.3 pm to the coordinated acetic acid, d(Eu-O100)  238.8 pm to the water molecule. The dimers are arranged in layers, parallel to (001) inclined by an angle of 13°. These “layers” are stacked in the [010] direction and, because of the screw axis 21 in this direction, the inclination angles are positive and negative, respectively. Two acetic acid molecules per formula unit of 3 fill other- wise open space, as Fig. 3b exhibits. The crystal structure of [Eu(OAc)3(HOAc)(H2O)] (4), isotypic with [Nd(OAc)3(HOAc)(H2O)] [15], which is built of the same dimers [Eu2(OAc)6(HOAc)2(H2O)2], is, of co- urse, more dense because it does not contain non-coordi- nated acetic acid. Therefore, the layer-like arrangement changes to hexagonal packing of dimers in (100) (Fig. 3c). The higher acetic acid pressure in the present case obviously leads to the inclusion of four molecules of acetic acid per dimer in the crystal structure of 3. In conclusion, we have shown that europium metal may be oxidized directly by acetic acid in sealed glass ampoules. Almost stoichiometric reactions yield the anhydrous euro- pium(III) acetate, [Eu2(OAc)6] (1), with a chain structure with eight-coordinate Eu3. With an “excess” of acetic acid, the “hydrogendiacetate” [Eu2(OAc)6(H2O)2(HOAc)2](HOAc)4 (3) is formed, built up of dimers with nine-coordinate Eu3. The coordinated water arises either from water “impurities” in the anhydrous acetic acid used, or, more probably, from the dehydration of acetic acid with the formation of acet- anhydride and water. Water is also needed for the formation of the sesquihydrate [Eu2(OAc)6(H2O)](H2O)2 (2) in which the chain structure of 1 is preserved with one molecule of water added to every second Eu3, hence with coordination numbers of 8 and 9, respectively. An “acetic acid adduct“, www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2006, 19891994 1994 [Eu2(OAc)6(H2O)2(HOAc)2] (4), had been obtained previously with the same dimers as in 3. The tri- and tetrahydrates of europium(III) acetate also contain chains and dimers, respectively. Thus, europium in the middle of the lanthanide series optimizes its preferred eight- and nine- coordinate surrounding in chains and, when more co- ordinating ligands are available, in dimers.
