The reaction of ZnBr2 with L forms the two-dimen- sional coordination polymer [ZnBr2(L)1/2]n (1). In the two-di- mensional domain, the 68-membered metallomacrocycles as well as 12-membered 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (cy- clen) units propagate into two-dimensional extended struc- tures. Interestingly, the metallomacrocycles are stacked to form one-dimensional parallelogram channels in the solid state. In addition, the reaction of CdX2 (X = Br, I) with L forms Introduction The widespread use of the coordinative-bond approach in the construction of supramolecular coordination com- pounds by self-assembly is well established.[1] So far, a vari- ety of one-, two-, and three-dimensional infinite solid-state coordination architectures[2] as well as discrete molecular structures have been isolated and structurally charac- terized.[1] Applications, including chemical sieving, sensing, and catalysis based on the supramolecular coordination compounds have been discovered, and some have shown really exciting and valuable progress.[3] Surprisingly, the li- gands used in the assembly of materials are generally diden- tate, with some tridentate ones;[1,2] tetradentate ligands are relatively scarce.[4] A macrocyclic ligand with a tetraaza macrocycle seems a good candidate in this regard since macrocyclic compounds have long attracted great interest owing to their intriguing structural and spectroscopic prop- erties as well as host–guest chemistry.[5] In addition, tet- raaza macrocycles can be easily functionalized by several groups, such as alkynyl,[6] phosphanylmethyl,[7] carboxyl,[8] and pyridyl[9] on their secondary N-sites to produce some novel properties in coordination, electro- and photolumi- nescent, and catalytic chemistry.

(© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2006) We have previously reported a study of metal-containing cyclic amides based on a didentate N-pyridylcarboxamide ligand – N,N-bis(4-methylpyridyl)oxalamide – where inter- esting solid-state frameworks featuring cyclic peptides are constructed from hydrogen bonding/π···π interactions.[10] Organic amides have proved to be very useful in self- assembly through hydrogen bonding, and the assembled products often have relevance to biological systems. Most remarkably, cyclic oligoamides can give rise to interesting nanotube frameworks through inter-ring NH···O=C hydro- gen bonding, as reported by Ghadiri et al.[11] A new N- pyridylcarboxamide ligand (L) is used here as a tetradentate ligand for a crystal-engineering study. We report the design and synthesis of N,N,N,N-tetra(pyridin-4-yl)-1,4,7,10- tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetracarboxamide (L), which contains four N-(pyridin-4-yl)carboxamide groups as functional appendages, as well as the structural and lumi- nescence properties of its Zn2+ and Cd2+ complexes. Supramolecular Coordination Networks Containing Zn2+ or Cd2+ Ions FULL PAPER Results and Discussion Hosseini and co-workers[4c] have recently reported an interesting porphyrinic ligand with four N-pyridylcarbox- amides as appendages for the construction of one- and two- dimensional Cu2+-containing coordination networks as an example of supramolecular isomerism. Another new type of tetraaza macrocycle that contains four N-(pyridin-4-yl)- carboxamide groups as functional appendages for the con- struction of supramolecular coordination frameworks has also been designed and synthesized in this study. Unlike most of the literature studies, the tetradentate ligand (L) studied here is a rare example of a tetradentate ligand in a crystal-engineering study. A methanolic solution of ZnBr2 and CdX2 (X = Br, I) was carefully layered on top of a DMSO solution of L to give pale-yellow crystals of 1·DMSO·4CH3OH or colorless crystals of 2·4DMSO and 3·4DMSO, respectively, in good yield (70–80%) within a couple of days. The compounds are all air stable and photo- luminescent in the solid state. Description of the Crystal Structures Complexes 1–3 were isolated and their molecular struc- tures determined by an X-ray diffraction study, which con- firmed the formation of coordination polymers in the solid state. The molecular structure of 1 (Figure 1, a) displays a two-dimensional coordination polymer where L acts as a tetradentate ligand. The cyclen macrocycle contains four N- pyridylcarboxamide appendages, each of which coordinates to tetrahedral Zn2+ ions; the Zn2+ ions coordinate to two bromides and another N-pyridylcarboxamide appendage. In the two-dimensional domain, the 68-membered metallom- acrocycles built from four L and four ZnBr2 units, as well as the 12-membered macrocycles of the cyclen units, propa- gate into two-dimensional extended structures. Interest- ingly, the metallomacrocycles are stacked to form one-di- mensional parallelogram channels (as viewed along the a axis) in the solid state, as shown in Figure 1 (b); the diago- nal distances of these parallelogram channels are 26.59 and 15.73 Å. In addition, doubly hydrogen-bonding interactions [N(3)–H(3A)···O(3): N(3)···O(3) = 3.041(7) Å, N(3)–H(3A)··· O(3) = 159.95°; N(5)–H(5A)···O(3): N(5)···O(3) = 2.913(9) Å, N(5)–H(5A)···O(3) 167.09°] between the sol- vated DMSO molecules and amide groups are observed in the solid state; the channels are also filled with methanol molecules. Although 1 has a high R value due to the fast loss of solvated solvents, there is no doubt that the struc- tural framework of 1 can be still corroborated by the X-ray diffraction study. Both 2 and 3 are essentially isomorphous, therefore the molecular structure and the extended structural framework of 3 are shown in Figure 2, parts a and b, respectively, as a representative example. Unlike the two-dimensional coordi- nation network of 1, 2 and 3 both form three-dimensional coordination networks with octahedral Cd2+ ions coordi- nating to two anionic (Br, I) and four bridging L ligands, Eur.

ORTEP diagram shows 50% probability ellipsoids, and (b) its two-dimensional ex- tended framework showing a 1-D channel structure with solvates omitted (viewing through the a axis) in the solid state. as shown in part a of Figure 2. In more detail, the four N- pyridylcarboxamide appendages of the cyclen macrocycle each coordinate to octahedral Cd2+ ions, which also coordi- nate to two bromides and another three N-pyridylcarbox- amides. The cyclen plane is approximately perpendicular to that of the CdN4 (pyridyl) unit, with two pyridyl groups (at positions 1 and 7) roughly coplanar with the cyclen plane and the other two (at positions 4 and 10) above and below the plane. This different orientation of L results in the for- mation of interesting three-dimensional coordination net- works. Furthermore, the metallomacrocycles with 34-mem- bered rings built from two CdBr2 and two L units are packed into columns that form interesting tubular channels (viewed along the b axis) in the solid state, as shown in Figure 2 (b). Thus, the metallamacrocycles and cyclen macrocycles also propagate into three-dimensional ex- tended structures. Hydrogen-bonding interactions [N(6)– H(6A)···O(4): N(6)···O(4) = 2.955(7) Å, N(6)–H(6A)···O(4) = 153.31°] between the solvated DMSO molecules and amide groups are observed in the solid state, and the chan- nels are also filled with DMSO molecules. Upon changing the anion from Br– to I–, the trans-CdN4X2 geometry re- mains unchanged, and thus the structural frameworks also retain a similar structural motif. 10990682c, 2006, 8, Downloaded from https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejic.200501060 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025].

ORTEP diagram shows 30% probability ellipsoids, and (b) its three-dimensional extended framework showing a 1-D channel structure with solvates omitted (viewing through the b axis) in the solid state. Very recently, Cao et al.[4a] reported a cyclam (1,4,8,11- tetraazacyclotetradecane)-based tetradentate ligand con- taining pyridylmethyl groups as appendages as well as the structural study of its two novel Cd2+ polymeric metallo- macrocyclic complexes, where the ligand adopts µ2- or µ4- coordination modes in the structural framework. Indeed, the different coordination modes that co-exist in the same structure result in the formation of interesting three-dimen- sional coordination networks. In this study, it is interesting to find that given the same bridging ligands (L) and only one coordination mode (µ4) in the system, the structural motif changes dramatically and the supramolecular com- plexity increases upon changing the metal ions from tetra- hedral (four-coordinate) Zn2+ to octahedral (six-coordi- nate) Cd2+ ions. Unlike the structures reported by Cao et al.,[4a] which contain two coordination modes for the li- gands in the same framework, the structures of 2 and 3 also www.eurjic.org © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2006, 1698–1703 1700 form three-dimensional networks with tubular channels only due to the different orientation of the N-pyridylcar- boxamide appendages of the cyclen moieties. In this con- text, L has been shown to be a tetradentate ligand that acts as a versatile connector in the construction of interesting supramolecular coordination networks. Unfortunately, crystals of 1–3 easily lose solvent, which causes the crystal lattices to collapse instantaneously and thus prevents fur- ther studies by TGA and powder XRD analysis that might allow us to gain some insight into the channel structures. Solid-State Emission Spectra L and 1–3 are all luminescent in the solid state, as shown in Figure 3 (a), at room temperature. Upon photoexcitation at 325 nm, 1 shows a broad emission with a maximum at around 412 nm, whereas L displays a similar emission at around 403 nm. Given the high similarity between these emissions, they were tentatively assigned to an intraligand (IL) transition. The solid-state emission of 2 (Figure 3, b) at room temperature has an emission maximum at around Figure 3.

Thus, it seems reasonable that the excited state responsible for the emission for 2 is also an IL transition. Most import- antly, 3 shows a solid-state emission with an emission maxi- mum at around 439 nm, which is red-shifted with respect to those of 1 and 2. In light of previous studies[10,12] and the red-shift in emission energy on going from the bromo to the iodo complex, this emission can tentatively be as- signed to a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transi- tion, although intraligand transition mixing with LMCT cannot be excluded. Intraligand transitions as excited states are not uncommon for Zn2+ and Cd2+ complexes, but charge-transfer excited states are so far still rare.[13] Conclusion A new type of tetraaza macrocycle (L) containing four N-pyridylcarboxamide groups as functional appendages has been designed and synthesized in this study, which is a rare example of the use of a tetradentate ligand in a crystal- engineering study. Complex 1 can be isolated as a two-di- mensional coordination polymer upon reaction of ZnBr2 with L. In the two-dimensional domain, the 68-membered metallomacrocycles built from four L and four ZnBr2 units, as well as the 12-membered macrocycles of cyclen, propa- gate into two-dimensional extended structures. Interest- ingly, the metallomacrocycles are stacked to form one-di- mensional parallelogram channels in the solid state. In ad- dition, reaction of CdX2 (X = Br, I) with L leads to the formation of 2 and 3, respectively, which form isomorphous three-dimensional coordination networks with tubular channels due to the different orientation of the N-pyridyl- carboxamide appendages of the cyclen moieties. Again, the 34-membered metallomacrocycles built from two CdX2 and two L units, as well as the 12-membered macrocycles of the cyclen units, propagate into three-dimensional extended structures in 2 and 3. Unlike those of 1 and 2, the emission Table 1.

The channel structure, as well as the luminescence properties, of these tetraaza- macrocycle-based materials may be anticipated to hold po- tential for use as luminescent sensors. Moreover, the cyclen moiety acts as a versatile connector in the construction of supramolecular coordination networks, and is also capable of functioning as a receptor site for recognition events. Experimental Section General Information: All solvents for syntheses (analytical grade), which were used without further purification, and metal salts [ZnBr2, CdX2 (X = Br, I)] are commercially available. N,N,N,N-Tetra(pyridin-4-yl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane- 1,4,7,10-tetracarboxamide (L) was prepared following literature methods.[14] MS: positive-ion FAB mass spectra were recorded with a Finnigan MAT95 mass spectrometer. Steady-state emission spec- tra were recorded with a SPEX Fluorolog-2 spectrophotometer. Synthesis of N,N,N,N-Tetra(pyridin-4-yl)-1,4,7,10-tetraaza- cyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetracarboxamide (L): Isonicotinic acid (2.00 g, 16.24 mmol) was put into a 250-mL, two-necked flask with toluene (100 mL), under an atmosphere of nitrogen, and the mix- ture was stirred for ten minutes after addition of triethylamine (2.72 mL, 19.49 mmol). After addition of phosphorazidic acid di- phenyl ester (3.15 mL, 14.62 nm) the solution was stirred for one hour; it gradually became colorless. The solution was later refluxed for three hours at 90 °C (it became yellow) and was then cooled to room temperature. 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane (0.56 g, 3.25 mmol) dissolved in 100 mL of toluene was slowly and carefully transferred into the above two-necked flask to give a pale-yellow precipitate after stirring for two days at room temperature. The toluene was then removed under vacuum and the ligand was recrys- tallized from 200 mL of methanol to give a pure and white solid (0.64 g, 0.975 mmol) in 30% yield.

X-ray Crystallography: Suitable single crystals of 1·DMSO·4CH3OH, 2·4DMSO, and 3·4DMSO were mounted on a glass capillary respectively, and data collection was carried out on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer with Mo radiation (0.71073 Å) at 295(2) K. A preliminary orientation matrix and unit cell parameters were determined from 3 runs of 15 frames each, each frame corresponding to 0.3° scan in 15 s, followed by spot integration and least-square refinement. Data were measured using an ω scan of 0.3° per frame for 20 s until a complete hemisphere had been collected. Cell parameters were retrieved using SMART[15] software and refined with SAINT[16] on all observed reflections. Data reduction was performed with the SAINT soft- ware and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. Absorp- tion corrections were applied with the program SADABS.[17] The structure was solved by direct methods with the SHELX93[18] pro- gram and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 with SHEXLTL–PC V 5.03.[18] All non-hydrogen atomic positions were located in difference Fourier maps and refined anisotropically.
