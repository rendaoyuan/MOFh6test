Manuscript Metal–Organic Frameworks DOI: 10.1002/anie.201003377 Single-Crystal to Single-Crystal Cross-Linking of an Interpenetrating Chiral Metal–Organic Framework and Implications in Asymmetric Catalysis** Liqing Ma, Chuan-De Wu, Marcela M. Wanderley, and Wenbin Lin* Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have received extensive interest in the past decade because of their interesting properties.[1] MOFs exhibit exceptional gas-uptake capacity owing to their extreme porosity.[2] The ability to incorporate desired functional groups allows MOFs to perform in a variety of applications, such as catalysis,[3] chemical sensing,[4] and drug delivery.[5] In particular, MOFs represent ideal candidates as heterogeneous catalysts by simultaneously imparting porosity and introducing catalytic sites into MOFs. Unlike other catalyst heterogenization strategies, the MOF-derived heterogeneous catalysts can remain single- crystalline, thus providing a unique opportunity for detailed structural interrogation and therefore delineating the rela- tionships between the MOF structures and their catalytic activities and selectivities. Moderate hydrolytic and thermal stabilities of most MOFs limit the scope of reactions that can be heterogene- ously catalyzed by MOFs. We have recently focused our efforts on the design of chiral porous MOFs for heteroge- neous asymmetric catalysis as most asymmetric catalytic reactions are carried out under mild conditions in aprotic solvents.[6] In order for chiral MOFs to be useful asymmetric catalysts, they must possess large nanometer-scale open channels for the facile transport of sterically demanding substrates and products. We have recently synthesized isoreticular chiral MOFs based on tetracarboxylate bridging ligands derived from 1,1’-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) and copper paddle-wheel secondary building units (SBUs), and observed the remarkable dependence of the enantioselectivities of the addition of Et2Zn to aromatic aldehydes on the MOF open- channel sizes.[7] In order to expand the scope of applications of such chiral tetracarboxylate ligands, and to further under- stand the relationships between framework structures and catalytic activities, we have used these ligands in combination with other metal-connecting points or metal-cluster SBUs. Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of two interpenetrating chiral MOFs [Zn2(L)(dmf)- (H2O)]·2EtOH·4.3DMF·H2O (1, where L is (R)-2,2’-dieth- oxy-1,1’-binaphthyl-4,4’,6,6’-tetrabenzoate) and [Zn2(L’)- (dmf)(H2O)]·2EtOH·4.3DMF·4H2O (2, L’ = (R)-2,2’-dihy- droxy-1,1’-binaphthyl-4,4’,6,6’-tetrabenzoate), which are con- structed from dizinc SBUs and chiral tetracarboxylate ligands. More importantly, we observed unprecedented single-crystal to single-crystal crosslinking of the two interpenetrating networks in 2 by Ti(OiPr)4 to lead to intermolecular [Ti- (BINOLate)2] complexes that exhibit modest enantioselec- tivity in catalyzing the addition of diethylzinc to aromatic aldehydes to afford chiral secondary alcohols. This result provides unambiguous structural identification of an immo- bilized homogeneous catalyst and has significant implications in rational design of MOF-based heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts. MOF 1 was synthesized by heating a mixture of ZnI2 and (R)-H4L in DMF/EtOH at 908C for five days, while MOF 2 was produced by heating ZnI2 and (R)-H4L’ in DMF/EtOH at 1008C for one week (Scheme 1). The formulae of 1 and 2 were established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, NMR analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Crystals of 1 and 2 are isostructural and crystallize in the orthorhombic I212121 space group.[8] Here we only discuss structure 2, which contains two Zn atoms, one L’ ligand, one water molecule, and one DMF molecule in the framework in each asymmetric unit. The two Zn atoms have distinct coordination environments: one atom coordinates to four carboxyl oxygen atoms of four different L’ ligands and one water molecule in square-pyramidal geometry, and the other atom coordinates to three carboxyl oxygen atoms and one DMF molecule in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The two distinct Zn atoms are triply bridged by carboxylate groups to Scheme 1. Synthesis of homochiral MOFs 1 and 2. [*] Dr. L. Ma,[+] Dr. C.-D. Wu,[+] M. M. Wanderley, Prof. W.

Ed. 2010, 49, 8244 –8248 form {Zn2(m2-CO2)3(m1-CO2)} SBUs. The fourth carboxylate group of L’ coordinates to the square-pyramidal Zn atom in a monodentate fashion. Consequently, each L’ ligand, as well as each Zn2 unit, acts as a four-connecting linker that leads to a 3D network (Figure 1). Topological analysis of 2 reveals a four-connected uninodal net with a Schlfli symbol of {66}, which is a known topological type of unc (one of the uninodal 4-connected 3D nets).[9] The non-interpenetrating unc network of 2 possesses an extremely large void space with the largest channel dimen- sions of approximately 1.5  3.0 nm2 along the a axis. To avoid the formation of such an open structure, 2 forms a twofold interpenetrated network (Figure 1c). The shortest distance between the naphthyl rings of the two interpenetrating networks is 4.05(2) . Even after twofold interpenetration, 2 still possesses large channels (ca. 1.5  2.0 nm2) along the a axis. PLATON calculations indicate that the effective volume for solvent molecules in framework 1 is 7932.7 3 per unit cell, which is 49.2% of the crystal volume. Compound 2 has a void space of 7825.5 3 per unit cell, which is 51.6% of the unit-cell volume. TGA analyses indicated solvent weight losses of 34.9% and 38.8% for 1 and 2, respectively. The phase purity of 1 and 2 is supported by a good match between powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of bulk samples of 1 and 2 and those simulated from their single- crystal structures. The evacuated sample of 2 shows peak broadening at 2q values larger than 158, thus suggesting slight framework distortion upon solvent removal; this phenom- enon is not uncommon for MOFs with elongated ligands.[10] The crystallinity of 1 and 2 is recovered after soaking the desolvated samples in a DMF/EtOH (1:1 v/v) solvent mixture for 24 h at room temperature (Figure 2). In spite of frame- work distortion, 1 and 2 are highly porous, as shown by N2 and H2 adsorption experiments. The N2 gas-sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K in order to evaluate the permanent porosity of 1 and 2. Fresh crystals of 1 or 2 were washed with a DMF/EtOH (1:1 v/v) mixture followed by a brief wash with CH2Cl2. Compound 1 or 2 was then evacuated at 608C for 16 h under vacuum to remove the remaining solvent molecules before N2 adsorption measurements. As shown in Figure 3, both 1 and 2 show type I adsorption isotherms, thus indicating microporous structure for these frameworks. By assuming a monolayer coverage of N2 and applying the Langmuir model, we found that the apparent Langmuir surface areas of evacuated samples of 1 and 2 are 1481 m2g1 and 1847 m2g1, respectively (the P/P0 = 0.001 to 0.1 pressure range was selected). The BET surface area is 1335 m2g1 for 1 and 1657 m2g1 for 2. The calculated BET surface areas based on grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are 1720 m2g1 and 1877 m2g1 for 1 and 2, respectively (Figures S5 and S7 in the Supporting Information).

KGaA, Weinheim www.angewandte.org of 1 and 2 is supported by the smaller observed pore sizes, which are reduced by approximately 2  compared to those calculated from GCMC simulations (Figures S6 and S8 in the Supporting Information). To further characterize the gas- sorption properties of 1 and 2, hydrogen-uptake experiments were carried out. At 1 atm and 77 K, 1 and 2 exhibit high hydrogen uptakes of 1.1 and 1.3 wt%, respectively. We have also evaluated the accessibility of the open channels in 1 and 2 to large molecules, as this factor is important for asymmetric catalytic reactions. The uptake of Brilliant Blue R-250 dye by 1 and 2 are 8.0 and 10.6 wt%. These dye uptake amounts correspond to effective dye concentrations of 131 and 167 mm in the open channels of 1 and 2, as compared to a dye concentration of 24 mm in the original MeOH solution. The fact that 1 and 2 can host a dye molecule with approximate dimensions of 1.8  2.2 nm2 sug- gests their ability to transport large substrate and product molecules in asymmetric catalytic reactions. We evaluated potential applications of 2 in heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis. The dihydroxy groups in 2 can be transformed into an active Lewis acidic catalyst by post- synthesis modification with Ti(OiPr)4.[6,7,11] As shown in Table 1, Ti(OiPr)4-treated 2 is highly active in the addition of diethylzinc to aromatic aldehydes to afford secondary alcohols. However, only very modest enantioselectivity was observed in these reactions (17.4% ee for benzaldehyde at 13 mol% catalyst loading). This result is in stark contrast to our earlier results from MOF-catalyzed diethylzinc additions, which gave very high ee values (up to 93% ee), which rival the values obtained with corresponding homogeneous cata- lysts.[6,7] Structural analysis and dye-uptake studies indicated that the channels of the doubly interpenetrating networks in 2 are accessible to aldehyde and Et2Zn reagents. In order to understand the origin of the low enantioselectivity, single- crystal diffraction studies were carried out on Ti(OiPr)4- treated 2 (denoted as Ti-2), which was obtained by the treating single crystals of 2 suspended in toluene with Ti(OiPr)4 for three days. Compound 2 turned to from colorless to light yellow and then orange upon treatment with Ti(OiPr)4 (Figure 2, inset), as a result of ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitation in TiIV naphthoxide complexes. This color change indicates the reaction of the BINOL moieties in 2 with Ti(OiPr)4 to form catalytically active titanium BINO- Late species. Interestingly, when the structure of Ti-2 was resolved, the formation of intermolecular [Ti(BINOLate)2] species by single-crystal to single-crystal crosslinking of the two interpenetrating networks in 2 was revealed (Fig- ure 4a,b). Although a number of single-crystal to single- crystal transformations of MOFs have been reported in recent years, these results represent the first example of converting a MOF to a catalytically active material in a single-crystal to single-crystal fashion.[12,13] The proximity of the two inter- penetrating networks has led to short distances between OH groups from L’ ligands in different networks, thus allowing the reaction of Ti(OiPr)4 with two different BINOL moieties in the two adjacent L’ ligands to form intermolecular [(OiPr)2Ti- (BINOLate)2] complexes (Figure 4b,c). The [(OiPr)2Ti- (BINOLate)2] complex is disordered in three possible posi- tions. Ti1 (1/4 occupancy) sits in general positions, and Ti2 (1/ 2 occupancy) sits on the two-fold axis along the c axis (Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). Every pair of L’ ligands shares a total of one Ti(OiPr)2 fragment in Ti-2. Table 1: Addition of diethylzinc to aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by 2/ Ti(OiPr)4.[a] Entry Ar Conv.

Communications 8246 www.angewandte.org  2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2010, 49, 8244 –8248 Although Ti-2 has the same space group as 2, careful comparisons of their structures revealed significant changes in unit-cell dimensions and molecular conformations of the L’ ligands. The a and b axes of Ti-2 increase by 3.1% and 18.8%, while the c axis shrinks by 12% when compared to those of 2. While the BINOL moieties in 2 adopt a transoid conforma- tion with a dihedral angle of 1118 between the naphthyl groups, the BINOL moieties adopt a cisoid conformation with a dihedral angle of 78.78 in Ti-2. In the structure of 2, the hydroxy groups between adjacent BINOL moieties from two interpenetrating networks have the shortest hydroxy O–O distance of 3.74(2) . This O–O distance is shortened to 3.52(2)  in Ti-2. In contrast, the two hydroxy groups in the same BINOL moiety in 2 have an O–O distance of 4.16(2) , which is too far away to simultaneously coordinate to a Ti center to form a [(OiPr)2Ti(BINOLate)2] complex. As a consequence of the crosslinking of the two interpenetrating networks by the Ti centers, the other inter-BINOL hydroxy O–O distance is shortened from 4.46(2)  to 3.06(2)  and also engages in forming intermolecular [(OiPr)2Ti- (BINOLate)2] complexes (Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). Space-filling models indicated the presence of substrate- accessible open channels in the framework Ti-2 after the formation of intermolecular [Ti(BINOLate)2] species. We believe that the intermolecular [Ti(BINOLate)2] species should be less enantioselective in Et2Zn addition reactions because of the smaller steric influence of the naphthyl rings on the Ti center. As a result, 2/Ti(OiPr)4 exhibits much lower enantioselectivity than our previously reported MOF systems that can form desired intramolecular Ti BINOLate species (Figure 4c).[6,7,14] Control experiments with 1/Ti(OiPr)4 indi- cated a significant background reaction that is non-enantio- selective and further contributes to the low ee values observed for 2/Ti(OiPr)4. To this end, when the loading of 2/Ti(OiPr)4 was tripled, the ee value of the product increased from 17.4% to 29.8 mol% (Table 1, entry 5). ICP-MS (ICP = inductively coupled plasma) analyses indicate the binding of TiIV to the framework of 2, with a Ti/Zn ratio of 0.42.[15] The PXRD patterns of 2 remained essentially unchanged after TiIV loading and the Et2Zn addition reaction, thus indicating that the framework crystallinity is well maintained during the catalytic reaction. In conclusion, we have synthesized two 3D chiral MOFs based on tetracarboxylate bridging ligands and dizinc SBUs. Both MOFs 1 and 2 display very large 1D channels, even after twofold interpenetration, and exhibit high porosity, as char- acterized by N2 and H2 adsorption experiments. Modest enantioselectivity was observed for Et2Zn addition reactions catalyzed by Ti-2. Single-crystal structure determination revealed that 2 underwent single-crystal to single-crystal crosslinking upon treatment with Ti(OiPr)4 to form intermo- lecular [Ti(BINOLate)2] complexes that are less enantiodis- criminating than intramolecular titanium BINOLate cata- lysts. This work highlights the important influence of frame- work structures on the enantioselectivity of MOF-derived asymmetric catalysts and the opportunity to obtain high- precision structural information of MOF-derived catalysts that is typically not available for their homogeneous counter- parts. The rational design of MOF-derived catalysts can be greatly facilitated with the delineation of the relationship between their structures and catalytic properties. Experimental Section Synthesis of [Zn2L(DMF)(H2O)]·4.3DMF·2EtOH·H2O (1): A mix- ture of ZnI2 (31.9 mg, 0.10 mmol), H4L (41.1 mg, 0.05 mmol), DMF (2 mL), and EtOH (2 mL) was heated in a capped vial at 908C for 3 days. Colorless crystals of 1 were filtered, and briefly dried on filter paper at room temperature. Yield: 46 mg (63%). [Zn2L’(DMF)- (H2O)]·4.3DMF·2EtOH·4H2O (2) was similarly synthesized in 51% yield. Diethylzinc addition experiments: Fresh prepared crystals of 2 (9.2 mg, 6.3 mmol) were washed repeatedly with anhydrous MeOH, CH2Cl2, and toluene. Ti(OiPr)4 (19 mL, 63 mmol) was added with vigorous stirring to the crystals of 2 suspended in toluene (1 mL). After 1 h, Et2Zn (1.0m in toluene, 147 mL, 147 mmol) and benzalde- hyde (5 mL, 49 mmol) were added. The mixture was allowed to stir overnight, and then quenched by the addition of 1 mL of 3m HCl. The organic layer was passed down a short silica column and analyzed by GC. Received: June 3, 2010 Published online: September 21, 2010 .

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in air using a Shimadzu TGA-50 equipped with a platinum pan and heated at a rate of 5 °C per minute. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of 1 and 2 were collected on a Siemens SMART CCD diffractometer using Mo- Kα radiation, single crystal data of 2-Ti and all powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker SMART Apex II diffractometer using Cu radiation. The PXRD patterns were processed with the APEX 2 package using PILOT plug-in. Nitrogen and hydrogen adsorption experiments were performed with Autosorb-1C from Quantachrome, Inc. 2. Ligand syntheses and crystal growth 2.1 Ligand H4L was synthesized according to our previously reported procedure.1 2.2 Synthesis of (R)-2,2’-dihydroxy-1,1’-binaphthyl-4,4’,6,6’-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) (L’-H4). A methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) solution of L-Me4 (0.50 g, 0.57 mmol) was cooled to 0 oC in an ice/H2O bath, and 0.6 mL boron tribromide (6.2 mmol) was added slowly via a syringe. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After being stirred overnight, the mixture was poured into 100 mL of ice/H2O. The product was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was washed with H2O, and dried with MgSO4. The solvent was then removed S2 with a rotary evaporator. H4L´ was obtained as pale yellow powder with quantitatively yield. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): δ 9.59 (br, 4H); 8.54 (s, 2H); 8.37(d, J=16.4 Hz, 2H); ); 8.04 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 4H); 7.99 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 4H); 7.94 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H); 7.74 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H); 7.73 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H), largely obstructed by peaks at 7.74 and 7.70; 7.70 (d, J = 10.6 Hz, 2H); 7.38(d, J = 15.6 Hz, 2H); 7.35 (d, J = 16.5 Hz, 2H); 7.08 (d, J = 9.2 Hz, 2H). 13C NMR (DMSO-d6): δ 172.7; 167.83; 167.78; 154.2; 142.5; 142.2; 136.0; 135.1; 132.1; 131.0; 130.5; 129.9; 128.4; 127.8; 127.1; 126.9 117.6.

Colorless crystals of 1 were filtered, and briefly dried on filter paper at room temperature. Yield: 46 mg (63%). Solvent content calc. from the proposed formula: DMF, 26.4%; EtOH, 6.3%; H2O, 2.5%; determined by 1HNMR/TGA: DMF, 26.6%; EtOH, 5.8%; H2O, 2.5%. 2.4 Synthesis of [Zn2(L’)(dmf)(H2O)]·4.3dmf·2EtOH·4H2O (2) A mixture of ZnI2 (32.0 mg, 0.10 mmol), H4L´ (40.0 mg, 0.052 mmol) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of DMF/EtOH (5 mL/5 mL) in a vial, and 80 μL of HCl (3M, aq) was added. The vial was then capped and heated at 100 oC for three days. The resulting crystals with pale yellow color were obtained after filtration and briefly dried on filter paper. Yield: 39 mg (51%). Solvent content calc. from the proposed formula: DMF, 26.5%; EtOH, 6.3%; H2O, 6.2%; determined by 1HNMR/TGA: DMF, 26.7%; EtOH, 6.0%; H2O, 6.1%. 2.5 Synthesis of Ti-2. Freshly prepared crystals 2 (10 mg, 6.8 μmol) were washed repeatedly with anhydrous MeOH, CH2Cl2, and toluene. To the crystals of 2 suspended in toluene (1 mL), Ti(OiPr)4 (40 μL, 133 μmol) was added. The color of the crystals changed from colorless to light orange after hours. The mixture was gently shaken for 3 days to ensure the completion of the reaction. The resulting orange single crystals were suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. 3. X-ray Structure Determination Crystallographic measurements of 1 and 2 were made on a Siemens SMART CCD diffractometer system operated at 1500 watts power (for Mo-target X-ray tube); crystallographic data of 2-Ti were collected on a Bruker SMART Apex II CCD-based X-ray diffractometer S3 system equipped with Cu–target X-ray tube that was operated at 1600 watts. The frames were integrated with the Bruker SAINT© using a narrow-frame integration algorithm, which also corrects for the Lorentz and polarization effects. Absorption corrections were applied using SADABS. All of the structures were solved by direct methods and refined to convergence by least squares method on F2 using the SHELXTL software suit. All non-hydrogen atoms are refined anisotropically. SQUEEZE subroutine of the PLATON software suit was applied to remove the scattering from the highly disordered solvent molecules. The resulting modified HKL4 files were used to further refine the structures. During the structure refinement of 2-Ti, two Ti atoms with partial occupancy were located in the form of BINOLate-Ti(OiPr)2. Partially occupied -OiPr groups were located in the electron density map, and were restrained as rigid groups during the structure refinement. Table S1.

Fresh crystals were harvested by quick filtration, and briefly dried on filter paper under air for 2 minutes. The sample was then loaded into NMR tube (or the TGA sample tray for TGA analyses). To the weighted (20.53 mg for 1 and 13.57 mg for 2) sample in the NMR tube with a Teflon cap, 0.75 mL CD2Cl2 was added. Then 10 μL mesitylene (Mes) was added as an internal standard. After soaking overnight, the 1HNMR spectrum was taken at a 400 MHz Burker NMR spectrometer. Since the dmf or EtOH is miscible with CD2Cl2, their exact amount is then calculated against the internal standard. The total amount of solvent can be obtained by TGA, the amount of water molecules can be thus calculated by subtracting dmf and EtOH from the total solvent amount.
