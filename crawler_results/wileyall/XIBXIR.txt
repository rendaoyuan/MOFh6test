Two bis-triazole-bis-amide-based copper(II) coordination polymers, [Cu4(μ3-OH)2(dtb)(DNBA)6(H2O)2]·2H2O (1) and Cu(dtb) (DNBA)2 (2) [dtb = N,N-bis(4H-1,2,4-triazole)butanamide and HDNBA = 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid], were synthesized and structurally characterized. Polymer 1 shows a one-dimensional (1D) chain based Introduction Coordination polymers have attracted extensive attention not only because of their various structures, but also their po- tential applications in magnetism, gas adsorption, lumines- cence, and catalysis, etc.[1–4] Especially, coordination polymers with multinuclear metal clusters and multidentate ligands are currently of great interest owing to their potential applications in the area of molecular magnetism.[5–9] It is a great challenge to obtain the desirable cluster-based coordination polymers due to the variability of synthetic parameters, such as the coordina- tion arrangement of central metal atoms, the structural charac- teristics of ligand molecule, temperature, pH of medium.[10–13] Among the diverse synthetic methods of cluster-based coordi- nation polymers, a combination of triazole/tetrazole or their derivatives with carboxylates is one of the effective strate- gies.[14] Yang and co-workers reported a series of cluster-based coordination polymers based on the triazole/tetrazole or their derivatives and aromatic carboxylate ligands.[15,16] However, the multinuclear metal cluster-based coordination polymers constructed from the bis(triazole) or bis(tetrazole)-based li- gands and carboxylates are still limited, to the best of our knowledge.[17,18] Thus, in this work, we designed and synthe- sized a new flexible bis-triazole-bis-amide ligand N,N-bis(4H- 1,2,4-triazole)butanamide (dtb) to combine with carboxylate for constructing metal cluster-based complexes (Scheme S1, * Dr. J.-W.

The pH values have a crucial influence on the formation of 1 and 2. In addition, the electrochemical and luminescent properties of 1 and 2 as well as magnetic properties of 1 were investigated. Supporting Information), not only the triazole and carboxyl groups can hold the metal ions into the polynuclear clusters, but also the flexibility of amide group of dtb ligand may result in the novel target cluster-based coordination polymers. On the basis of the above considerations, in this work we utilized dtb as the main ligand and 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (HDNBA) (Scheme S1) as the auxiliary ligand, combining the CuII ions, to construct the target coordination polymers. We obtained two new distinct coordination polymers [Cu4(μ3-OH)2- (dtb)(DNBA)6(H2O)2]·2H2O (1) and Cu(dtb)(DNBA)2 (2). The pH of the medium has an important influence on the for- mation of 1 and 2. In addition, the electrochemical and lumi- nescence properties of 1 and 2, as well as magnetic properties of 1 were investigated. Results and Discussion Synthesis The dtb ligand was prepared according to the literature method.[19–21] Compounds 1 and 2 can be synthesized in one autoclave under the same conditions (120 °C for 72 h). Many factors can influence the crystallization of products under hy- drothermal conditions. To further investigate the formation conditions of 1 and 2, we carried out a series of experiments by tuning the pH values of medium, copper salt, and solvent. When the pH of the medium was between 2.0 and 3.0, all products afforded pure purple crystals of 2. If the pH values varied from 3.0 to 4.5, both blue crystals of 1 and purple crys- tals of 2 were obtained, and the yield of 1 gradually increased with pH increasing from 3.0 to 4.5, while the yield of 2 grad- ually decreased. Unfortunately, when the pH of the medium was above 4.5, no crystal products were observed. Thus, pure blue crystals of 1 could not be obtained in our experiments. The results indicate that the pH of the medium dominates the formation of 1 and 2. On the other hand, there was no good J.-W. Zhang, X.-L. Wang et al. ARTICLE crystal of 1 and 2 appearing when we changed copper salt and solvent. In addition, we found that employment of amide-based ligand dtb tends to generate multiple crystal phenomena in one-pot by lots of experiments. Crystal Structures of Compounds 1 and 2 Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Table 1) reveals that polymer 1 shows a 1D linear chain based on tetra-nuclear CuII clusters. As shown in Figure 1, four crystallographically independent CuII ions are supported by two μ3-OH groups, two neutral dtb ligands, and four DNBA anions to form a tetra- nuclear CuII cluster with the intermetallic distances of 3.1529(12), 3.4001(13), 3.2465(13), 3.2186(13), 3.4338(13), and 5.8551(15) Å for Cu1···Cu2, Cu1···Cu3, Cu1···Cu4, Cu2···Cu3, Cu2···Cu4, and Cu3···Cu4, respectively. Both Cu1 and Cu2 are pentacoordinate by one nitrogen atom from one dtb ligand and four oxygen atoms from two μ3-OH groups and two DNBA anions in a distorted square-pyramidal arrange- ment. In contrast, both Cu3 and Cu4 are hexacoordinate by one nitrogen atom from a dtb ligand and five oxygen atoms from one μ3-OH group, one water molecule, and three DNBA anions in a distorted octahedron arrangement. The Cu–N and Cu–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.002(5)–2.021(5) and 1.924(4)–2.314(4) Å (Table S1, Supporting Information), respectively, which are comparable to those of the similar cop- per(II) complexes.[22,23] Table 1.

In 1, the dtb ligands connect the CuII4 clusters to form a 1D linear chain (Figure 2). The adjacent 1D chains are further extended into a two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular layer through the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

(Figure S1, Table S2). In 1, the dtb ligand shows a bridging bis(bidentate) coordination mode (Scheme S2a), and the DNBA anion adopts three types of coordination modes, namely, bridging bismonodentate, monodentate, and bridging monodentate modes (Scheme S2c–e), which have been ob- served in the reported DNBA metal complexes.[24–26] Figure 2. 1D linear chain of 1 formed by the CuII4 clusters and dtb ligands. Polymer 2 displays a 1D linear chain. As shown in Figure 3, the CuII ion features a distorted octahedral arrangement, coor- dinated by two nitrogen atoms from two dtb ligands and four oxygen atoms from two DNBA anions. The Cu–N bond length is 1.979(2) Å, and the Cu–O bond lengths are 1.9467(17) and 2.7668(23) Å (Table S3), which are shorter than those of 1. In 2, the CuII ions are bridged by the dtb ligands to generate a 1D linear chain (Figure 4), and the adjacent 1D linear chains are further packed into a 2D supramolecular layer by the inter- molecular hydrogen bonding interactions (Figure S2, Table S4). In 2, the dtb ligand exhibits a bridging bidentate coordina- tion mode (Scheme S2b), and DNBA adopts a chelating biden- tate coordination mode (Scheme S2f), which are different from those in 1. Electrochemical Properties The electrochemical properties of 1 and 2 were investigated in 0.5 m Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 2 adjusted by H2SO4). Figure 5 shows the cyclic voltammograms of com- pound 1 bulk-modified carbon paste electrode (1-CPE) at dif- ferent scan rates in the potential range of +200 to +600 mV.

All hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Symmetry codes: A 1/2+x, 1/2–y, 1/2+z. Figure 4. 1D linear chain of 2 formed by the CuII ions and dtb ligands. CuI are observed at the cyclic voltammogram (100 mV·s–1) of 1-CPE, and the mean peak potential E1/2 = (Epa + Epc)/2 is +362 mV.[27] When the scan rates are varied from 40 to 500 mV·s–1, the peak potentials gradually change: the cathodic peak potentials move toward the negative direction, and the corresponding anodic peak potentials shift toward the positive direction. Furthermore, the anodic and cathodic peak currents are proportional to the scan rates (Figure S3), indicating that the redox process of 1-CPE is surface-controlled. The redox behavior of 2-CPE is a little different from that of 1-CPE, as shown in Figure S4. The mean peak potential is +50 mV, which can be attributed to the redox of CuII/CuI.[27,28] The difference of the peak potentials between 2-CPE and 1-CPE may be due to the different coordination environments of CuII ions and final structures.[29] The anodic and cathodic peak cur- rents are proportional to the scan rates (Figure S5), which indi- cate that the redox process of 2-CPE is also surface-controlled. Fluorescent Properties The fluorescent properties of 1, 2, and the free dtb ligand were investigated at room temperature in the solid state (Figure S6). The emission peak of free dtb is observed at 457 nm when it is excited at 300 nm, which is assigned to the π*π elec- tronic transitions of free dtb. Polymers 1 and 2 exhibit strong emission peaks at 464 nm (λex = 290 nm) and 432 nm (λex = 270 nm), respectively, which may be attributed to ligand-to- metal charge transfer (LMCT) and/or the intraligand fluores- Z.

Cyclic voltammograms of 1-CPE in 0.5 m Na2SO4 solution (pH = 2) at different scan rates (from inner to outer: 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 mV·s–1). cent emission.[30,31] Although 1 and 2 have the same central metal atoms, O-donor and N-donor ligands, they show dif- ferent luminescent properties, which can be attributed to the differences of coordination environments around the metal ions.[32,33] Magnetic Properties The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility of 1 was measured in the temperature range of 2–300 K at an applied field of 1000 Oe, owing to the multiple superexchange pathways within the CuII4 cluster of 1. The χmT vs. T plot for 1 is shown in Figure 6. The χmT value at 300 K is 1.84 emu·mol–1·K, which is higher than the theoretical value (1.50 emu·mol–1·K) for four spin-only CuII (S = 1/2, g = 2) ions.[34,35] From 300 K to 2 K, χmT decreases gradually to a minimum of 0.03 emu·mol–1·K, which suggests that the strong antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor in- teractions within the CuII4 cluster of 1 lead to an S = 0 ground state at low temperature. Such a spin ground state can be further confirmed by the nearly zero magnetization value of 1 even at 70 kOe (Figure S7).[18] The χmT vs. T curve indicates that the dominant antiferromagnetic interactions between the paramag- netic centers exist in 1. The antiferromagnetic behavior should be originated from the superexchange interactions between Cu1 and Cu3 (Cu2 and Cu4) by the mixed μ-κ2N3:N4-dtb/ μ-κ2N1:N2-dtb and μ3-OH pathways, as well as between Cu1 and Cu4 (Cu2 and Cu3) by the mixed syn,syn-μ2-η1:η1-COO–, μ2-η2:η0-COO– and μ3-OH pathways.[3b] In contrast, the superexchange interactions between Cu1 and Cu2 by the double μ3-OH pathways often result in a weak ferromagnetic cou- pling.[36,37] In addition, the sharp increase of χm for 1 below 30 K (Figure 6) implies the presence of a paramagnetic impurity, as is usually observed in the antiferromagnetic clusters.[38,39] J.-W. Zhang, X.-L. Wang et al. ARTICLE Figure 6. Plots of χm vs. T and χmT vs. T for 1. Conclusions We have successfully obtained two novel 1D copper(II) co- ordination polymers based on a new bis-triazole-bis-amide li- gand under hydrothermal conditions. The pH of the medium plays a vital role in the formation of 1 and 2. The polymers 1 and 2 exhibit good physicochemical properties and suggest their potential applications as multifunctional materials. Experimental Section Materials and Methods: All chemicals purchased were of reagent grade, and used without further purification. FT-IR spectra (KBr pel- lets) were taken with a Magna FT-IR 560 spectrometer in the 500– 4000 cm–1 region. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were performed with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer. A CHI 440 Elec- trochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance was used for the electro- chemical experiments and the compounds 1 and 2 bulk-modified car- bon paste electrodes were used as working electrodes. Fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Hitachi F-4500 fluo- rescence/phosphorescence spectrophotometer. Magnetic data were col- lected with a Quantum Design MPMSXL7 (SQUID) magnetometer. The diamagnetic corrections were made by using Pascal’s constants.

Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2013, 587–591 590 (1-CPE) was fabricated by mixing compound 1 (0.01 g) and graphite powder (0.10 g) in an agate mortar for approximately 30 min to achieve an even, dry mixture. Afterwards, paraffin oil (0.05 mL) was added and stirred with a glass rod. The homogenized mixture was packed into a 3 mm inner diameter glass tube and the tube surface was wiped with weighing paper. The electrical contact was established with the copper wire through the back of the electrode. The preparation method of 2 bulk-modified CPE (2-CPE) is similar to that of 1-CPE.

The structures were solved by the direct method and refined by the full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXL software.[40,41] Metal atoms in the complexes were located from the E-maps. All the non-hydrogen atoms were re- fined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms of the ligands were gener- ated theoretically onto the specific atoms.
