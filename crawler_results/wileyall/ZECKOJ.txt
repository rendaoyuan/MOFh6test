R. Navarro,*[a] Satoshi Horike,[b] and Susumu Kitagawa*[b, c] Introduction The use of porous materials is of paramount importance for industrial applications, especially in separation processes[1] and catalysis.[2] In this regard, zeolites are currently the ma- terials of choice as a consequence of their molecular-sieving features and their robustness under typical working condi- tions.[3] Their rigidity and high stability at high temperatures are the trademarks of zeolites, but at the same time, these features can also be considered as a limit, because no versa- tility or dynamic modification can be achieved in the vast majority of cases.[3] The scientific interest for the search for alternative mate- rials that may combine the soft nature of enzymes with the periodic structures of zeolites has fructified in the develop- ment of the field of soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs). Soft PCPs exhibit dynamic flexible behavior upon incorporation/release of guest molecules, thus changing their crystal lattice according to a guest-responsive behavior.[5,6,7] Thus, this type of materials combine the transformability of enzymes with the pore regularity and accessibility typically found in crystalline porous materials. The characteristic be- havior of this class of materials is the consequence of a “soft” periodic network with bistability associated to a con- tracted or expanded phase as a response to external stimuli. Of these compounds, particular attention is devoted to those polymers exhibiting a breathing effect, that is, those flexible structures that, under certain conditions, maintain their crys- tallinity, but change their crystal lattice and, consequently, pores size and shape. For breathing porous coordination polymers, the original crystal structure can always be re- Abstract: Herein, the synthesis, crystal structure, and full characterization of a new soft porous coordination polymer (PCP) of ([Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(OH2)]DMF1.5)n (1) formulation, which is easily obtained in the reaction of CuX2 (X=Cl, NO3) salts with 3,5-di- methyl-4-carboxypyrazole (H2dmcapz) is present. Compound 1 shows a cop- per(II) dinuclear secondary building unit (SBU), which is supported by two pyrazolate bridges and an unprecedent- ed H2O bridge. The dinuclear SBUs are further bridged by the carboxylate ligands to build a diamondoid porous network. The structural transforma- tions taking place in 1 framework upon guest removal/uptake has been studied in detail. Indeed, the removal of the bridging water molecules gives rise to a metastable evacuated phase (1b) that transforms into an extremely stable porous material (1c) after freezing at liquid-nitrogen temperature. The soak- ing of 1c into water allows the com- plete and instantaneous recover of the water-exchanged material (1a’). Re- markably, 1b and 1c materials possess structural bistability, which results in the switchable adsorptive functions. Therefore, the gas-adsorption proper- ties of both materials have been stud- ied by means of single-component gas adsorption isotherms as well as by vari- able-temperature pulse-gas chromatog- raphy. Both materials present perma- nent porosity and selective gas-adsorp- tion properties towards a variety of gases and vapors of environmental and industrial interest. Moreover, the flexi- ble nature of the coordination network and the presence of highly active con- vergent open metal sites confer on these materials intriguing gas-adsorp- tion properties with guest-triggered framework-breathing phenomena being observed. The plasticity of CuII metal center and its ability to form stable complexes with different coordination numbers is at the origin of the structur- al transformations and the selective-ad- sorption properties of the studied ma- terials.

The milestone of these flexible PCPs is MIL-53, published in 2004 by Frey and co-workers.[8] Herein, we take advantage of the coordination versatility of the pyrazolate ligands[9,10] for porous-materials construc- tion[11] to build the new bistable plastic porous framework [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2OH2]n·1.5nDMF (1; Figure 1) exhibiting un- usual gas adsorption properties. Results and Discussion Structural characterization and framework flexibility of 1: The crystal structure of 1 is based on C2v binuclear cop- ACHTUNGTRENUNGper(II) metal fragments supported by two pyrazolate bridges and an unusual m2-OH2 bridging ligand (Figure 1). The CuN2O3 coordination polyhedron exhibits a distorted square-pyramidal geometry. The basal positions are occu- pied by two N donor atoms from two different pyrazolate moieties and two O donor atoms from a carboxylate group acting in a bidentate coordination mode. The apical position is occupied by a O donor group from the bridging water molecule, which gives rise to an elongated CuO coordina- tion bond of 2.400(2) . It should be noted that the octahe- dral coordination of the Cu atoms is prevented by the steric hindrance of the methyl groups of the dmcapz ligands. The CuCu distance within the binuclear unit is 3.270(1) . The 3D structure is generated by the binuclear Cu2 units acting as four connecting nodes through m3–dmcapz bridges, which gives rise to the formation of a 3D diamond-like open framework with pore windows openings of 6.77.2 and 9.7 9.6 2 along [100] and [111] crystallographic directions, re- spectively (Figure 2). The channels are filled with disordered DMF molecules as well as a small amount of free H2dmcapz as was confirmed by both IR spectrum (two frequencies in the C=O stretching region) and NMR spectrum of 1 sus- pended in [D6]DMSO (see the Supporting Information). Therefore, the formulation of the bulk solid 1 is [Cu2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2OH2]n·1.5DMF·0.1nACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2dmcapz). Noteworthy, the presence of bridging water molecules is a rather unusual feature in 3D PCPs with no precedents in copper based materials.[12] Although the quality of the single-crystal diffraction data does not permit to locate the hydrogen atoms, the nature of the m2-OH2 bridge can be confirmed taking into account the CuO bond lengths and Cu-O-Cu bond angles, which are typical for a weakly bonded m-OH2 bridges[13] and discard the presence of either m-OH[14] or m-O2.[15] Additional XPS analysis of 1 also dis- carded the presence of m-Cl (Cl=0.083 mol%, see the Sup- porting Information) and confirms the divalent charge state of copper center (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Moreover, the use of CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 instead of CuCl2 as the metal source in the synthesis of 1 further exclude the pres- ence of m-Cl bridging ligands. Indeed, for the latter case, no peaks corresponding to the NO stretching-vibration mode were found in the IR spectrum of 1, which also confirms the absence of NO3  bridging ligands. Finally, the thermal pa- rameters for the bridging atom in 1, further agree with its oxygen nature, because this value is lower for oxygen than for any other atom. It should be noted that the evacuation of the as synthe- sized 1 at 1208C under vacuum, afforded a partially desol- vated framework [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2OH2]n·0.9nDMF (1a, sky blue color), which maintains the original I4md space group, but showed some changes in the unit cell parameters, which are indicative of the framework flexibility of 1. Indeed, there is a small expansion of a and b axes (Da=4.0%) and a larger contraction of the c axis (Dc=13.6%) resulting in a small contraction of the cell volume (DV=6.7%). Inter- estingly, single crystals of 1a, suitable for X-ray diffraction, can be obtained by soaking crystals of 1 in dry CH2Cl2 for three days. The experimental powder-diffraction pattern of 1a perfectly matched the one simulated from single-crystal diffraction data (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). Remarkably, the structure of 1a retains the basic features of 1. The main differences are related to the bending of Figure 1.

When 1a was suspended in distilled water for 24 h, the complete removal of any DMF and H2dmcapz residual mol- ecules could be achieved (as was confirmed by IR spectro- scopy, Figure S5 in the Supporting Information), and a water-exchanged material [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2OH2]n·4.5nH2O (1a’) was obtained. Material of 1a’ maintained the same powder-diffraction pattern of 1a, which is indicative that the porous framework remained unchanged (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). Therefore, the difference between 1a and 1a’ solids is limited to the change in the nature of the molecules hosted in the channels. The study of the thermal stability of 1 and 1a’ materials have been performed by using thermogravimetric analysis. The thermogravimetric diagram of 1 shows a large weight loss (30%) around 1008C that corresponds to the removal of the guest DMF molecules and the aqua bridge (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). A second and well-defined drop in sample weight started between 270 and 3008C, which corresponds to framework decomposition process. The thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) curve of the water exchanged 1a’ solid was slightly different, when the first step (15%) ended at lower temperature (808C) and clear- ly corresponded to the loss of guest water molecules (4.5 per formula unit, calculated 16.1%). Around 1208C, a second small step revealed the loss of one H2O molecule per [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2] unit (experimental 3.8, calculated 4.3%) that is attributed to the water molecule bridging the two copper central atoms. After this event, there is a flat plateau up to temperatures above 3008C when a steep weight loss took place indicating framework decomposition. It is worth noting that the overall amount of water mole- cules in 1a’ material determined by TGA (namely, 5.5 mole- cules per [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2] unit) is in perfect agreement with the water-vapor adsorbed amount obtained for 1b solid at 298 K (5.4 molecules per [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2] unit, see below). Taking into account the guest exchange properties of 1 and the TGA curves, it is clear that pore guest molecules have an impact in the activation conditions, and that gas-ad- sorption properties may strongly depend on them. There- fore, it is necessary to obtain a completely evacuated frame- work (without any solvent molecules and/or free ligand inside the pores) to optimize the gas-adsorption properties of this material. With this aim, we decided to activate the as-synthesized 1 as follows: 1) evacuation at 1208C for 7 h under high vacuum; 2) soaking in H2O for 24 h (to remove any impurity of unreacted H2dmcapz ligand, CuCl2 or DMF); 3) evacuation at 1508C for 7 h under high vacuum. In this way, a dark blue fully activated 1b material was ob- tained. Compound 1b is extremely sensitive to ambient moisture, which is manifested by a rapid color change to sky blue upon exposure to open air (within few minutes). This feature is consistent with the loss of the m2-OH2 bridge be- tween the Cu atoms to yield the fully activated [Cu2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2]n (1b) material. Indeed, the weight loss at 1208C in the TGA trace and the concomitant marked color change are indicative of a change in the coordination environment of the Cu centers upon the formation of the 1b phase (see above). This process can be related to the one taking place during the activation of the known [Cu3(benzene-1,3,5- tricarboxylate)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)3] (HKUST-1), for which an apprecia- ble color change takes place upon the loss of the water mol- ecules coordinated to the Cu centers.[16] In both cases, the metal atom reduces its coordination number from five (dis- torted square-pyramidal geometry) to four (distorted square planar). The structural changes taking place during the 1a’!1b transformation have been monitored by variable- temperature XRPD and were indicative of changes in the cell parameters, even if the transformation to 1b phase was not clearly defined (Figure 3). Indeed, at 508C the powder- diffraction pattern of the solid did not correspond to the one measured for 1a’ indicating that a structural transforma- tion took place in the low temperature range. The most evi- dent change occurred between 90 and 1108C, when the re- flection at 2q=20.58 shifted to higher angles and split into two peaks (2q=21.6 and 21.98). We suppose that, in this temperature range, the H2O bridging molecule was progres- sively removed. The small difference in the temperature, at which the water molecule was lost, in comparison with the TGA trace (1208C), should be attributed to the different heating rate used in both experiments: namely, 108C min1 for the thermogravimetric analysis and temperature kept constant for 1.5 h for each temperature step in the variable- temperature XRPD experiment. Unfortunately, the transi- tion 1a!1b is not single-crystal-to-single-crystal, due to the breakage of the 1a crystal as possible consequence of the profound structural modification, and therefore, no exact structural information (i.e., bond lengths and angles) could be obtained for 1b material. Noteworthy, a further phase transition 1b!1c took place at 77 K under dynamic vacuum, which was manifested by the change of sample color from dark blue to forest green (Scheme 1). The new green phase (1c) is very stable in air and, unlike 1b, does not adsorb ambient moisture to turn Figure 3. Variable-temperature XRPD on 1a’ showing the formation of 1b above 1008C. Temperature range: 50–1708C. Temperature program: steps of 208C; temperature was kept constant for 1.5 h for each step. Chem. Eur. J. 2012, 18, 13117 – 13125  2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Compound 1c only reverts to 1a’ phase, if soaked in distilled water (Scheme 1). Indeed, the TGA curve of 1c (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information) showed no weight loss until de- composition of the material around 2808C. Consequently, 1c can be considered as a new completely evacuated porous phase with a reduced hydrophilicity compared with 1b (see below). The change in color from dark blue in 1b to forest green in 1c evidenced a further change in the stereochemistry of the metal centers.[17] We presume that this change might be promoted by a small twist of the dmcapz ligands, which may lead to a distortion from the original square-planar geome- try in 1b to a distorted-tetrahedral environment in 1c. Un- fortunately, it has not been possible to register the electronic spectra of 1b as a consequence of its moisture sensitivity. However, the supposition of a tetrahedral distortion is also supported by the comparison of the UV/Vis spectra of 1a’ and 1c materials (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information) and magnetic measurements (see below). In both UV/Vis spectra, a well-defined peak at 15300 cm1 corresponding to the d–d transition of CuII spe- cies and a broad edge at higher energies (much broader and red shifted for 1c compound than for 1a’) can be seen. The redshift of the latter transition, attributable to a ligand– metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition, can be explained considering that the removal of water molecules from the copper dimeric unit increases the electron density on the carboxylate and pyrazolate groups still coordinated to CuII centers. This local structural change leads to an increase of the ionicity of CuII ions and a redshift of the LMCT transi- tion.[18] Moreover, the difference in the intensity ratio be- tween d–d and MLCT transitions for the two materials sug- gest a different degree of p–d hybridization that is caused by a change in the geometry around copper ions, namely, form distorted octahedral (1a’, higher hybridization) to dis- torted tetrahedral (1c, lower hybridization).[19] The local structural information of the CuII centers was deeply investigated from the magnetic point of view, be- cause it is expected that the magnetic exchange will mainly take place through the pyrazolate bridges from a CuII binu- clear system. The thermal behavior of the magnetic suscepti- bility for 1a’ and 1c has been measured in the 2–300 K tem- perature range (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). Compound 1a’ showed the typical cM versus T plot for a moderately strong antiferromagnet. The cMT values decayed continuously to reach a zero value at low temperatures, and the cM values increased gradually up to a maximum of 0.0028 cm3mol1 at 150 K, which is typical of a copper(II) binuclear system. Interestingly, the magnetic measurements on 1c showed a very similar trend with the maximum of cM being shifted down to 125 K. The fitting of the experimental data to Bleaney–Bowers Equation gave a value of g=2.08 and 2J=163 cm1 for 1a’ and g=1.99 and 2J=149 cm1 for 1c (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information).[20] These values are consistent with the efficiency of pyrazolate bridges to transmit an antiferromagnetic interaction in cop- per(II) binuclear systems.[21] The slight difference found in the magnetic exchange for both materials is probably relat- ed to the stereochemical modification concomitant to the re- moval of the bridging water molecule in 1c. However, it should be noted that the m2-OH2 bridge is probably not af- fecting significantly the magnetic properties of the copper binuclear system as a consequence of the weak interaction with the axial positions of the copper coordination polyhe- dra. Therefore, the small differences found in the magnetic behavior of both systems should be attributed to a probable tetrahedral distortion of the metal centers and to deviations of the pyrazole ring from Cu-N-N-Cu plane.[22] The above described ionicity change of the coordination bond and coordination geometry will also reduce the acces- sibility of guest molecules to the open-metal sites. More- over, it will lead to a larger exposition of the hydrophobic methyl groups of the dmcapz ligand preventing the entrance of moisture water molecules into the cavities. Therefore, water can only diffuse into the porous structure at relative higher moisture pressures for 1c compared with 1b (see below). Static solid–gas adsorption studies: The flexibility of the porous framework 1, as well as the formation of accessible open-metal sites prompted us to investigate the adsorptive properties of this system. With this purpose, the solid–gas adsorption features of 1c towards a wide variety of gas and vapor probe molecules was studied in detail. Compound 1c exhibited reversible typeI adsorption iso- therms towards N2 (kinetic diameter 3.64 ), Ar (3.4 ), and O2 (3.46 ) at 77 K, which are typical of crystalline mi- croporous materials (Figure 4).[23] The N2 isotherm revealed the reversible uptake of 7.5 mmolg1 at p/po=0.5, which corresponds to a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area of 539 m2g1 and a pore volume of 0.227 cm3g1 (at p/ po=0.981). The adsorption capacity for O2 and Ar is quite similar, however, in the pressure range 0.1<p/po<0.2 the Ar adsorption isotherm showed some steps, which are char- acteristics of a flexible framework and are in agreement with the above-described results.[24] The adsorbed gas amount reached 10 mmolg1 (at p/po=0.5) for both O2 and Ar, and the corresponding Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface areas account for 663 and 643 m2g1, respectively.

These values are slightly larger than those obtained with N2, which is in agreement with the decreasing kinetic diameters of the essayed probe gases (N2>Ar>O2). The gas adsorption isotherms of 1b at 195 K for a variety of probe molecules, namely, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO2 (Figure 5), CO, and N2 (Figure S11 in the Supporting Infor- mation) was also measured, inspired by the growing interest in separation of complex mixtures of these molecules.[25] For methane, the adsorption capacity is very low, and the ad- sorption branch of the isotherm can be considered of typeII, which is characteristic of a weak interaction of this probe molecule with the framework. However, the desorption branch follows a typeI isotherm giving rise to the formation of a wide hysteresis loop. This type of behavior is in agree- ment with the flexible nature of 1b framework and super- critical nature of CH4 at this temperature. By contrast, ace- tylene, ethane, ethylene, and carbon dioxide are strongly ad- sorbed by the porous framework. Noteworthy, acetylene exhibited a typeI adsorption iso- therm, whereas the rest of the gases (C2H4, C2H6, CO2) ex- hibited an unusual two-step shape. In the case of acetylene, we can take into account its large quadrupole moment that would lead to a better accommodation of the molecules into the channels.[26] Differently, for C2H4, C2H6, and CO2, in the very low pressure region, a steep uptake of 2.3 mmolg1 took place corresponding to the adsorption of one molecule of gas per each Cu2 dinuclear unit, suggesting that a strong host–guest interaction with the convergent open-metal sites is involved in this first step. Afterwards, at P=10 kPa, a second step for ethane and ethylene isotherms was ob- served, giving rise to an uptake of 3.5 mmol of gas per g of 1b, indicating a gate-opening behavior with the concomitant entrance of further guest molecules, which are physisorbed into the pores. Interestingly, the desorption branch of the isotherm did not follow the adsorption branch at pressures below 20 kPa and, as a consequence, a hysteresis loop was formed. This behavior implies that ethane and ethylene mol- ecules are strongly retained in the porous framework and are only released at low relative pressures. The similar be- havior of both molecules should be related to an optimal fit of these two hydrocarbons in the cavities of 1b material. Noteworthy, for CO2 the gate-opening effect is more pro- found permitting the final accommodation of more than 6 mmol of CO2 per g of PCP. It should also be noted that the desorption branch was not recovering the adsorption one, and a larger hysteresis loop was observed. However, in contrast to the previous cases, the loop closing took place at higher pressures, which means that CO2 interaction with the pore surface in the framework is less strong than with light hydrocarbon molecules, because CO2 is no longer retained by the framework at pressures as high as 15 KPa. On the other hand, N2 and CO adsorption at 195 K is almost negligible indicating a low interaction of these probe molecules with both the metal active sites and the pore sur- face of the framework (Figure S11 in the Supporting Infor- mation). As a consequence, in the low pressure range, that is, at P<10 kPa, the framework showed a partial adsorption selectivity of C2H2 versus C2H4, C2H6 and CO2, whereas a very high selectivity of all the adsorbed probe molecules (i.e., C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO2) towards CO and N2 gases (Table 1). In the higher pressure region, that is, P=50 kPa, the adsorption selectivity of C2H2 versus C2H4 and C2H6 di- minished, whereas adsorption of CO2 overcame the values of the rest of the probe gases.

It is also possible to calculate the partition coefficients from the results obtained in pulse-gas-chromatographic ex- periments on 1b. In this case, the best performances of the material reward the separation of C2Hn gases from CO2, be- cause the latter component is not strongly retained by the framework at high temperatures. It is worth noticing that the results presented in Table 1 show some differences, if the two methods are compared. We can justify this taking into account the very low gas partial pressures in pulse–GC experiments and the different temperature range of the ex- periments. In addition, we were also interested in investigating the effect of the 1b!1c phase transition as switchable adsorp- tive properties. With this purpose, the adsorption isotherms of CO2 and C2H2 probe gases in the 195–303 K temperature range for both 1b and 1c phases were measured (Figures 6 and S12 in the Supporting Information). The results showed that the porous structure of 1b is able to uptake a larger amount of gasses in the low pressure range than 1c, which agrees with a more accessible porous structure for the former material. Noteworthy, for 1c, there is hysteretic be- havior as well as a stronger temperature dependence for the adsorption of acetylene than for 1b. For example, the amount of C2H2 adsorbed in 1b at P=100 kPa and 195 K reached 4.6 mmolg1 and it diminished to 2.3 mmolg1 at 293 K. In contrast, in the case of 1c, the adsorbed amount at 195 K was 5.2 mmolg1 and it diminished to 0.6 mmolg1 at 293 K. The observed difference should be explained consid- ering the better accessibility to the porous structure and open-metal sites in 1b than in 1c. In the case of CO2, at temperatures close to ambient conditions, the maximum amount of adsorbed gas is similar to the C2H2 one, however, it should be noted that the shape of the isotherm is highly dependent on the nature of the probe gas, namely, of type III with hysteresis loop formation for CO2 versus reversible typeI for C2H2. These results should be taken as a proof of highly selective porous networks, which are able to distin- guish between two very closely related probe guest mole- cules with the same kinetic diameters (3.3 ), similar shape, and physical properties. Vapor adsorption studies: To put further light on the ad- sorptive differences between 1b and 1c, the vapor adsorp- tion of H2O and MeOH at 298 K was also studied (Figure 7). In the case of water adsorption, an initial step for 1b at very low pressures can be appreciated, which should corre- spond to the incorporation of the bridging water molecules to the open metal sites. This step is followed by a pro- nounced gate opening at P=1.0 kPa for both 1b and 1c, which should be related to the concomitant entrance of the probe molecules into the porous structure. Interestingly, al- though for 1b there is a single step in the adsorption branch, in the case of 1c, this step is smaller and is followed by a second step at high pressures of 2.3 kPa. Probably, the accommodation of the bridging water molecule (one mole- cule per Cu2 unit at P=1.0 kPa) is not providing the driving force required to twist the dmcapz ligands and restore the square-planar geometry around the metal center. This con- formational change can take place just when a higher pres- sure is forcing the vapor molecules to enter the structure. It should also be noted that, as was previously found for CO2 and C2H2, the guest accessibility to the porous structure of 1c is smaller than for 1b, which is manifested by the higher gate pressure for 1c. As was previously found for the essayed probe gases (see above), the desorption branches of the vapor-adsorption isotherm for both phases did not re- cover the adsorption one, and consequently large hysteresis loops were found. In the case of methanol adsorption, 1b and 1c phases again showed large differences. As in the case of water ad- sorption, the gate pressure for 1b is lower than for 1c and below the values found for water. Noteworthy, for 1c, it is again possible to appreciate a second step in the adsorption branch of the isotherm. The total amount of adsorbed meth- anol reached 5.8 mmolg1 for both samples. Regarding the desorption branches of the isotherms, one can conclude that Figure 6.

Summarizing, all the results point to a less accessible porous structure of 1c com- pared with 1b and reveal that a higher energy input is nec- essary in 1c than in 1b to rearrange the network into the wide open form. Dynamic gas-adsorption studies: Variable-temperature pulse-gas-chromatographic studies have been carried out for NO, CO2, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, Ar, Kr, and CO gas mixtures to establish the thermodynamic aspects of the adsorption, as well as the separation abilities of 1b and 1c.[28] To quantify the strength of the interaction of these guest molecules, the zero-coverage adsorption heats (DHads) from the variation of the retention volumes (Vg) as a function of temperature according to the equation DHads=R[@ACHTUNGTRENUNG(lnVg)/@ACHTUNGTRENUNG(1/T)] was calculated.[29] The direct relationship between the retention volume (Vg) and the Henry constant (KH) also allowed to calculate values of the Henry constant under ambient condi- tions (298 K). These studies revealed relatively high reten- tion times for ethane, ethylene, acetylene, and carbon diox- ide, as well as relatively high adsorption heats indicative of a strong interaction of these probe gas molecules with the porous frameworks 1b and 1c (Table 2). These results agree with the single gas-adsorption isotherms presented above, and are indicative of the interaction between guest probe molecules and the open-metal sites. In contrast, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrogen monox- ide, argon, and krypton were characterized by low retention times. Although the strength of the host–guest interaction is generally higher for 1b framework than for 1c, only slight differences between these two materials were found, which can be explained taking into account their closely related nature. Finally, breakthrough curve measurements performed on 1b with stream of CO2/CH4 1:1 shows that carbon dioxide is retained in the final amount of one molecule per CuII dimer, whereas methane has no interaction with the framework, thus, confirming once again the consistency of the results obtained for single-component adsorption measurements (Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). Conclusion Herein, the synthesis and full characterization of a new Cu– PCP of formulation ([Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2OH2]·ACHTUNGTRENUNG(DMF)1.5)n (1), which combines a set of unusual features: 1) this material has an unprecedented H2O bridge between the two copper atoms in the dimeric building unit; 2) the removal of these water molecules by thermal treatment gave rise to the bista- ble [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2] (1b, 1c) open network, which combines framework flexibility with unusual coordinatively unsaturat- ed convergent adsorption active sites; 3) moreover, 1b con- verts into a new 1c phase by simple freezing at liquid-nitro- gen temperature. The latter phase transition is accompanied by a concomitant drastic change in color, from dark blue to forest green, thereby confirming a change in coordination stereochemistry of the metal centers. The extremely high stability of 1c in air is also a rare feature for an open frame- work. The higher hydrophobicity of 1c material (compared with 1b) is a proof of the structural reorganization taking place during the freezing process. The selective gas-adsorption properties of 1b and 1c ma- terials have been studied and compared. The adsorptive properties of both materials are dominated by the presence Figure 7.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 13123 FULL PAPER A Soft Copper(II) Porous Coordination Polymer of highly active adsorption sites on the convergent coordina- tively unsaturated metal centers and by framework flexibili- ty, which give rise to gated adsorption with many of the es- sayed probe gases. Noteworthy, 1b gives rise to large parti- tion coefficients thus suggesting a possible application of this material in gas-separation processes. On the other hand, 1c at temperatures close to room temperature has a reduced adsorption capacity compared with 1b. This is a direct con- sequence of the reduced accessibility of the porous structure in 1c compared with 1b, which is confirmed by lower values of the interaction energy between the framework and gas guest molecules, obtained in the dynamic gas-adsorption ex- periments. Summarizing, the studied system is very intriguing materi- al, which combines the presence of coordinatively unsaturat- ed metal centers with framework plasticity giving rise to un- usual gas-adsorption properties. The origin of this behavior is the coordination versatility and plasticity of copper(II) centers. Experimental Section Physical section: XPS measurements were performed on a ULVAC-PHI Model 5500 spectrometer with 15 kV, 400 W MgKa emission as the X-ray source. UV/Vis spectra of solid samples were recorded on a HITACHI U-3500/U-4000 spectrophotometer over the range 250–900 nm at room temperature. Elemental analyses were carried out on a Flash EA 1112 series, Thermo Finnigan instrument. IR spectra were recorded on a NICOLET iS5, Thermo Scientific. XRPD data were collected on a Rigaku RINT-200 HF (Ultima) diffractometer with CuKa radiation. TGA were carried out on a Thermo plus TG8120, Rigaku instrument in a ni- trogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 Kmin1. The adsorption iso- therms of gases were carried out on Belsorp-max and Belsorp-18. The ad- sorption isotherms of gaseous H2O and MeOH were measured by using a Belsorp-aqua. The gas-separation properties of the systems have been studied by means of variable-temperature pulse GC method[28] and meas- urements of breakthrough curves. These studies were performed by using 10 mLmin1 He flux as gas carrier flowed through the activated samples packed into a 15 cm length, 0.4 cm inner diameter glass column. Helium gas was initially purged into the packed column. The relative amounts of the gases passing through the column were monitored on a mass spec- trometer gas analysis system (Pfeiffer Vacoon) detecting ion peak at the appropriate m/z value. Single-crystal X-ray measurements: Data were recorded on a Rigaku/ MSC Saturn CCD diffractometer with confocal monochromated MoKa radiation (l=0.7107 ) and processed by using the CrystalClear Program (Rigaku). The structures of 1 and 1a were solved by a direct method (Sir 97)[31] and refined by full-matrix least squares refinement using the SHELXL-97 computer program.[32] The positions of non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement factors. The hydrogen atoms were refined geometrically by using a riding rigid model. The void volume of each framework was estimated by the PLATON program.[30] CCDC-882685 (1) and 882686 (1a) contain the supplementary crystallo- graphic data for this paper.
