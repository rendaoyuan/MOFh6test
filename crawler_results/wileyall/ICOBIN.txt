Dawe,[a] Muhammad U. Anwar,[a] and Laurence K. Thompson*[a] Keywords: Hydrozone ligands / Magnetic properties / Cobalt / Manganese The coordination chemistry of a group of hydrazone-based ligands, modified with carboxylate and heterocyclic terminal donor groups, with MnII and CoII has been investigated. The multifunctional nature of the ligands allows coordinative flexibility based on the hydrazone core, which is well estab- lished to lead to spin-coupled polymetallic assemblies through μ-Ohydrazone bridging. Examples of dinuclear, tetra- Introduction Functionalized hydrazone-based ligands have enjoyed considerable success as platforms for the synthesis of square [nn] (n = 2–5) grid complexes by self-assembly, as a result of the contiguous arrangement of coordination pockets containing hydrazone oxygen and nitrogen donor atoms, in addition to donors from terminal groups. A selection of ditopic, tritopic, tetratopic and pentatopic ligands is illus- trated in Scheme 1, which produce M4, M9, M16, and M25 complexes with MnII, CoII, NiII, CuII and ZnII.[1] Typically, the end pieces are heterocyclic N-donor groups. The hydraz- one oxygen atoms bridge adjacent metal ions leading to spin-exchange interactions. Modifying the hydrazone func- tionality with, for example, oxime groups leads to the pos- sibility of additional further assembly processes involving the formation of triangular groups of metal ions, which is frequently observed with simple oximes.[2] This has been observed with the modified hydrazone ligands HL3C and H2L4, which produce Cu6 and Cu36 assemblies, respectively, in which the hydrazone groups act in a bridging capacity, but the oxime ends bind three CuII ions in [Cu3(μ2-NO)3- (μ-O)] triangular groups connected to hydrazone-bridged subunits.[3,4] In this study we have used the hydrazone group as a building block and extended it on one end with a carboxyl- ate group and at the other end with a potentially bridging heterocyclic donor group, viz. triazole and pyrazine (Scheme 1; ligands shown in their carboxylic acid form). Reaction with MnII and CoII salts produced crystalline complexes, in which examples of triazole bridging, carb- oxylate bridging and pyrazine bridging were observed in [a] Department of Chemistry, Memorial University, St. John’s, NL, A1B3X7, Canada E-mail: lk.thompson@mun.ca © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Structures of dinuclear, tet- ranuclear and chain complexes are described in addition to magnetic data and an analysis of the intramolecular ex- change interactions. Results and Discussion Structural Descriptions Crystallographic details for 1–4 are listed in Table 5. [C28H30MnN8O10]n (1) The structure of 1 is illustrated in Figure 1, and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 1. The structure consists of a 1D chain of metallacyclic rings with each ring comprising two MnII centres and two ligands. The ligands adopt an unusual open bidentate bonding mode involving a 4-pyrazine nitrogen atom and a carboxylate oxygen atom with two pairs of N and O donor atoms from separate li- gands occupying cis positions around each six-coordinate MnIIN2O4 ion. The other two trans coordination sites are occupied by water molecules. The C5–O1 hydrazone bond length is 1.23 Å, which indicates ketone double bond char- acter, with a proton residing on the adjacent nitrogen atom N3. Each ligand therefore behaves as a monoanion, which leads to overall charge neutrality. The Mn–Mn separation is 10.22 Å. One feature, which may in part be responsible for the chain structure, is the proximity of the pyrazine rings within each metallacyclic ring in addition to the pyrazine and phenyl rings. Centroid–centroid distances of 4.40 and 3.78 Å suggest that the pyrazine–phenyl contacts represent the only significant π contacts (Figure 1).

The structure contrasts sharply with that of 1, as it is a dinuclear complex with two ligands bridging two seven-coordinate MnII ions in a [μ-Ohydrazone]2 capacity, with further ligand binding in the pentagonal plane through the carboxylate oxygen, Ndiazine and pyrazine nitrogen atoms. Axial positions at each MnII centre are occupied by oxygen atoms from one coordinated methanol molecule and an unusual partial oc- cupancy situation involving a combination of water and methanol at the other position. The excellent data quality for this sample, and the presence of all protons in differ- ence-map positions, revealed this unusual occupancy model expressed in the formula. Figure 2 shows this coordination site represented by just the methanol component (O5). The Figure 2. Structural representation of 2. Table 2. Selected bond lengths [Å] and angles [°] for 2.

Bettle, L. N. Dawe, M. U. Anwar, L. K. Thompson FULL PAPER Mn–L distances fall in the range 2.18–2.37 Å, typical for MnII, the Mn–Mn distance is 3.78 Å, and the Mn–O–Mn angle is 114.0°. [(C13H9N4O3)4(C13H8N4O3)2Mn4(H2O)5](H2O)2- (CH3OH)2 (3) The molecular structure of 3 is shown in Figure 3, and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 3. The complex consists of a linear chain of four seven-coordinate Mn centres bound within a group of six ligands. The Mn– L distances fall in the range 2.14–2.38 Å, typical of MnII. Two tetradentate ligands play the most important role in creating the chain of MnII ions and binding through their terminal pyrazine N, hydrazone N and O and carboxylate O atoms. The hydrazone oxygen atoms bridge the outer Mn1 atoms to the inner Mn2 atoms, and the terminal carb- oxylate groups surprisingly link the central pair of Mn centres through μ2-O single atom bridging. A third μ-O bridge between Mn2 and Mn2 is provided by a water mole- cule (O11). The triple oxygen bridging arrangement brings the metal ions into close proximity [Mn2–Mn2 3.1565(14) Å]. Two other tridentate ligands bind to the outer Mn centres through the hydazone N and terminal hydrazone O atoms, but once again a μ-Ocarboxylate atom (O2) bridges Mn1 and Mn2. The Mn–O–Mn angles within the central Mn2 subunit are  90° (Mn2–O5–Mn 89.22°, Mn2–O11–Mn2 88.00°), whereas angles on the outer Mn2 subunits are much larger (Mn1–O2–Mn2 103.6°, Mn1–O4– Figure 3.

The final pair of ligands bind in an unusual monodenate manner to Mn1 and Mn1 through the carboxylate groups and appear to dangle from the ends of the chain. The two bridging ligands bear a –2 charge, whereas the others have –1 charges, thus producing a charge-neutral complex. [(C6H5N5O3)Co(H2O)2]2(H2O)4 (4) The structure of 4 is shown in Figure 4, and selected dis- tances and angles are listed in Table 4. Two distorted octa- hedral cobalt ions are bound in an almost planar arrange- ment of two tetradentate ligands, with two deprotonated triazole groups bridging the metal centres. The Co–L dis- tances fall in the range 2.02–2.23 Å, typical of CoII, with short contacts to the triazole nitrogen atoms. The Co–Co distance is 3.75 Å. The Co–N–N–Co torsion angles are  4°, which indicates essential planarity of the metal ions and the triazole rings. Each triazole ring provides two equa- torial nitrogen donors at each Co ion, with water molecules occupying the axial positions and pyruvate oxygen and hy- drazone nitrogen donor atoms completing the equatorial coordination. Each ligand has a –2 charge, which results in a charge-neutral species. Figure 4. Structural representation of 4. Table 4. Selected bond lengths [Å] and angles [°] for 4.

Vari- able-temperature magnetic data for 2 are shown in Figure 5 as plots of molar susceptibility and moment as a function of temperature. The overall smooth drop in moment with decreasing temperature indicates the presence of intramo- lecular antiferromagnetic exchange, and the shoulder on the susceptibility plot suggests a small amount of paramagnetic impurity. The data were fitted to a simple isotropic ex- change Hamiltonian for two spin-coupled S = 5/2 centres [Equation (1)], using MAGMUN4.1.[5] Hex = –J1{S1·S2} (1) Figure 5.

KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 5039 On examining the structure of 3 and the bridging con- nections within the dinuclear MnII2 subunits, there is an obvious difference between the central and outer subunits based on the Mn–O–Mn bridging angles. All Mn–O–Mn angles in the central subunit are  90°, whereas the angles in the outer subunits are 103.6°and 115.6°. The classical exchange paradigm for O-bridged dinuclear species is asso- ciated with the magnitude of the M–O–M angle, particu- larly in the case of copper,[7,8] and on the basis of overlap arguments involving metal ion orbitals and the oxygen p- orbitals, angles of around 90° represent a changeover region from ferromagnetic ( 90°) to antiferromagnetic ( 90°) behaviour. On this basis the magnetic behaviour of 3 was fitted to Equation (2), which assumes a positive J value for the central subunit (J2) and negative J values (J1) for the outer subunits. A good fit was obtained with the software package MAGMUN4.1,[5] to give g = 2.03(1), J1 = –2.9(1) cm–1, J2 = 2.5(1) cm–1 and TIP = 0, θ = 0.4 K (102R = 3.1), and the solid line in Figure 6 was calculated with these parameters. The presence of both ferromagnetic and anti- ferromagnetic exchange in 3 is unusual but in agreement with orbital arguments based on M–O–M bridge angles. Examples of μ-O-bridged MnII dinuclear complexes exhib- iting ferromagnetic exchange are rare. However, one exam- ple with two μ-Ocarboxylate bridges and Mn–O–Mn bridge angles of 101.8° exhibits ferromagnetic exchange (J = 0.462 cm–1), supported by theoretical calculations.[9] The much smaller Mn–O–Mn angles in 3, would be expected to lead to enhanced ferromagnetic exchange, as is observed. Hex = –J1{S1·S2 + S3·S4} – J2{S2·S3} (2) Variable-temperature magnetic data for 4 are shown in Figure 7 as plots of molar susceptibility and moment as a function of temperature. A characteristic maximum in χmol at 12 K signifies the presence of intramolecular antiferro- magnetic exchange between the two CoII centres. The mo- ment drops steadily from 6.7 μB at 300 K to 1.05 μB at 2 K, which suggests a ground-state singlet. The orbital contri- butions to the magnetic properties of high-spin CoII species (S = 3/2) are associated with the 4T1g ground state and should be taken into account, unless their effect is effec- Figure 7.

Thompson FULL PAPER tively quenched due to large distortions from octahedral symmetry.[10,11] Complex 4 is quite distorted, and so an at- tempt was made to fit the data to a simple isotropic dinu- clear exchange expression [Equation (1), S = 3/2], which as- sumes orbital-moment quenching. Surprisingly, a reason- ably good fit was obtained over the full temperature range with MAGMUN4.1,[5] to give g = 2.43(8), J = –5.3(1) cm–1 and θ = –0.2 K (102R = 2.4). The solid line in Figure 7 was plotted with these parameters. The single-ion excited states for octahedral high-spin CoII are well separated from the ground state, and the Kra- mer’s doublet component of the 4T1g ground state, which arises from spin–orbit coupling, is the only one significantly populated at low temperatures ( 30–40 K). Consequently, an isotropic fitting of the magnetic data to Equation (1) (S = 3/2) is perhaps considered more valid in this temperature range and should yield a more reasonable estimate of J. The magnetic data from 2–40 K were therefore fitted to the isotropic exchange expression [Equation (1), S = 3/2] to give g = 2.28(2), J = –4.0(1) cm–1, TIP = 15010–6 cm3mol–1 and θ = –1 K (102R = 2.07). The fit is shown in the inset of Figure 7. The reduced value of –J using this treatment is reasonable, based on an expected overestimation of J when orbital contributions are ignored at higher tempera- tures.[10,11] In an attempt to evaluate the single-ion CoII contributions more thoroughly, Sakiyama’s approach was adopted by using the software package MagSaki.[12–14] Al- though an exactly comparable geometric model for the dis- tortion in 4 was not available, an axial, anisotropic dinu- clear CoII model was used. A good fit was obtained for J = –3.9 cm–1, gz = 2.20, gx = 4.95, λ = –158 cm–1, κ = 0.93 and Δ = 793 cm–1 (102R = 2.3) (λ = spin–orbit coupling constant, κ = orbital reduction factor, Δ = axial splitting parameter), and the result is shown in Figure 8. This model cannot be considered rigorous, but the parameters evalu- ated are reasonable compared with related dinuclear CoII systems,[10–14] and in particular the J value is entirely consis- tent with simpler models based on isotropic exchange (vide supra). It is clear from all fitting attempts that the antiferro- magnetic exchange is based on the dinuclear structure and is propagated through the almost planar arrangement of the two N2 triazole bridges, as expected.

Chem. 2011, 5036–5042 5040 Conclusions The incorporation of multiple sites in a polyfunctional ligand creates donor complexity, and it is difficult to predict a priori which particular group will dominate on coordina- tion. The hydrazone group has been shown to produce μ- Ohydrazone-bridged complexes in simple polytopic ligands with one type of substituent other than the hydrazone (e.g. poap, 2poap and related ligands Scheme 1) with grid sys- tems prevailing.[1] The introduction of carboxylate groups creates opportunities for new coordination motifs and the possibility of forming charge-neutral complexes. Ligands H2L5 and H2L6 also include heterocyclic components, which can bridge in their own right. With MnII and CoII, three structural types were observed: 1D chain, dinuclear and tetranuclear, with short-range bridging through μ2- Ohydrazone-, μ2-Ocarboxylate- and μ2-triazole-based groups. Spin–spin interactions through these bridges resulted in antiferromagnetic exchange in most cases, except for the central dimanganese portion of the Mn4 chain cluster, where rare ferromagnetic coupling was observed as a result of the acute average Mn–O–Mn angles ( 90°). Experimental Section Experimental Methods: Commercially available solvents and chemi- cals were used without further purification. Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained as Nujol mulls between KBr discs with a Mattson Polaris FT-IR instrument. Mass spectra were recorded with an Ag- ilent 1100 Series LC/MSD in atmospheric-pressure chemical-ion- ization positive (APCI+) mode with methanol/acetonitrile mixtures as solvents. Variable-temperature magnetic data were collected with a Quantum Design MPMS5S Squid Magnetometer by using field strengths of 0.1–5 T and in the temperature range of 2–300 K. Background corrections for the sample holder assembly and dia- magnetic components of the complexes were applied.

Synthesis of Complexes [C28H30MnN8O10]n (1) and (C13H8N4O3)2Mn2(CH3OH)(H2O)3 (2): Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.10 g, 0.41 mmol) was dissolved in meth- anol (10 mL) in a round-bottomed flask. H2L5 (0.10 g, 0.34 mmol) was added to methanol (10 mL), and the solution was warmed. The two mixtures were combined to give a cloudy orange solution. H2O was added dropwise, but the precipitate still did not dissolve. The reaction mixture was then stirred and heated gently for 24 h. A cloudy orange solution resulted, which was gravity-filtered to give a clear light yellow filtrate, and an orange precipitate. Attempts to redissolve the precipitate were unsuccessful. The yellow filtrate was left to slowly concentrate at room temperature. Colourless crystals of 1 suitable for X-ray diffraction formed after 2 weeks (yield 45 mg, 16% based on metal salt).

[(C13H9N4O3)4(C13H8N4O3)2Mn4(H2O)5](H2O)2(CH3OH)2 (3): MnCl2·4H2O (0.090 g, 0.46 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (10 mL) in a round-bottomed flask. H2L5 (0.10 g, 0.34 mmol) was added to the flask with a methanol/water (5:1) mixture (12 mL). The ligand did not dissolve initially, so triethylamine (4 drops) was added, which produced a dark yellow solution. The solution was gravity-filtered to give a dark yellow clear filtrate. The filtrate was left to slowly concentrate at room temperature. Orange, rod-shaped crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction formed after 1 week (yield 24.1 mg, 10.5% based on metal salt).

X-ray Crystallography: Crystals of 1–4 were mounted on low-tem- perature diffraction loops and measured with a Rigaku Saturn 70 CCD area detector with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radia- tion (Table 5). The structures were solved by direct methods[15] and expanded by using Fourier techniques.[16] Neutral atom scattering factors were taken from Cromer and Waber.[17] Anomalous disper- sion effects were included in Fcalcd.,[18] and the values for Δf and Δf were those of Creagh and McAuley.[19] The values for the mass attenuation coefficients are those of Creagh and Hubbell.[20] All calculations were performed by using the CrystalStructure[21,22] crystallographic software package except for refinement, which was performed by using SHELXL-97.[15] All non-hydrogen atoms were 10990682c, 2011, 32, Downloaded from https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejic.201100746 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

Bettle, L. N. Dawe, M. U. Anwar, L. K. Thompson FULL PAPER refined anisotropically. All O–H and N–H hydrogen atoms were located in difference-map positions. They were refined positionally with distance restraints and with fixed displacement ellipsoids (1.2 Ueq for N–H, and 1.5 Ueq for O–H). All other hydrogen atoms were introduced in calculated positions and refined on a riding model. Solution and refinement proceeded normally for 1, 3 and 4. For 2, a complicated solvent model was required, however; excel- lent data quality revealed all protons in difference-map positions, and therefore allowed the refinement of several partial occupancy molecules. Of particular interest is the identity of O5, which was a member of two SHELXL parts; the first, at 0.464(4) occupancy, revealed that Mn1 was coordinated to a methanol molecule con- sisting of C15, H15(a,b,c), O5 and H5, with no uncoordinated lat- tice methanol present; the second, at 0.536(4) occupancy, revealed that Mn1 was coordinated to a water molecule consisting of O5, H5 and H5a. An additional lattice solvent methanol molecule was present, consisting of C16, H16(a,b,c), O6 and H6.
