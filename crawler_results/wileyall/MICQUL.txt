Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/chem.200501067 Guest-Dependent Flexible Coordination Networks with Fluorinated Ligands Kayoko Kasai*[a] and Makoto Fujita[b] Introduction Infinite coordination networks derived from metal ions and bridging ligands have attracted much attention in recent years due to the challenge of constructing novel metal– ligand architectures[1,2] as well as their potential in applica- tions such as optical,[3] magnetic,[4] electronic,[5] and porous materials.[6] In particular, coordination networks with inner cavities and channels capable of clathrating guest species are of interest as zeolite-like materials for gas adsorption,[7] chemical adsorption,[8] ion-exchange,[9] and heterogeneous catalysis.[10] Their well-defined hydrophobic cavities and channels surrounded by organic components are important for specific functions, and key factors for success in fabricat- ing such materials are the selection and combination of metal ions and bridging ligands. We have reported the first typical coordination zeolite [CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bipy)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]n, which is prepared from the rod-like bi- dentate ligand 4,4’-bipyridine (bipy) and CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2.[10a] The two-dimensional square grid network has functions includ- ing selective heterogeneous catalysis and separation of iso- mers such as those of dichlorobenzene and dibromobenzene. Kitagawa and Kondo et al. have reported the preparation of a series of [M2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bipy)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)4]n complexes (M=CoII, NiII, ZnII) that show reversible adsorption/desorption of gases such as CH4, N2, CO2, and Ar.[7a] These networks have tongue-and-groove structures in which two-dimensional bi- layer frameworks pack by partial interdigitation and one-di- mensional channels run through the structures. Yaghi et al. have reported the synthesis of charge-neutral porous coordi- nation networks containing multitopic benzenecarboxylates as building blocks, in which aromatic solvents may be selec- tively included.[8a,c] The design of multidentate bridging ligands is a predomi- nant factor in determining the structures and functions of coordination networks. The bipyridine network [CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bipy)2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]n, for example, can form a clathrate complex with o- dihalobenzenes but not with m- or p-dihalobenzenes.[10a] This high selectivity, which is based on the size- and shape- specificity of the inner cavity, may be attributed to the ri- gidity of the bidentate bipy ligand and the octahedral coor- dination geometry of the CdII ion, with four pyridine rings at the equatorial positions and two monodentate nitrate anions at the axial positions. In the aromatic carboxylate network {[CoC6H3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(COOH1/3)3(py)2]·2/3py}n, the solid materi- al can selectively adsorb aromatic molecules such as benzo- Abstract: Guest-dependent flexible co- ordination networks are formed from 1,4-bis(4-pyridylmethyl)tetrafluoroben- zene (bpf), 4,4’-bis(4-pyridylmethyl)oc- tafluorobiphenyl (bpfb), 2,6-bis(4-pyri- dylmethyl)hexafluoronaphthalene (2,6- bpfn), and 2,7-bis(4-pyridylmethyl)hexa- fluoronaphthalene (2,7-bpfn) with Cd- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 in the presence of various or- ganic compounds. The reaction of bpf affords one-dimensional cyclic chains, two-dimensional rhombus grid sheets, and three-dimensional diamond frame- works with threefold interpenetration. The reaction of bpfb mainly affords two-dimensional rhombus grid sheets with twofold parallel interpenetration. The reaction of 2,6-bpfn affords a one- dimensional ladder and two-dimension- al rhombus grid, twisted grid, and her- ringbone sheets. The reaction of 2,7- bpfn affords two-dimensional rhombus grid sheets and grid sheets with dumb- bell-shaped cavities. This diversity of network topologies is induced by inter- actions between the guest molecules and the flexible ligand frameworks.

The use of such rigid ligands allows selective enclathration of guest organic compounds with size- and shape-specificity. In contrast to rigid ligands, flexible ligands with conforma- tional freedom have significant potential for forming the basis of coordination networks with a large variety of struc- tures and topologies. Zaworotko et al. have reported the oc- currence of supramolecular isomerism in coordination net- works with the flexible ligand 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpe).[11] Its complex with CoACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 can afford 1D rod-to- ring chains, bilayers, or ladder arrays with identical molecu- lar formulae [CoACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpe)1.5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2] and asymmetric units. The supramolecular isomerism results from gauche or anti con- formations of the bpe ligand. Stang et al. have reported an assortment of different structures with a single metal-ligand system using 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane as ligand.[12] The supramolecular topologies are dependent on simple organic guests such as benzene, toluene, or cis-stilbene to afford closed dinuclear macrocycles and infinite helical and wedge- shaped one-dimensional networks. The network structures are influenced by intermolecular host–guest and/or guest– guest interactions. The introduction of electron-deficient substituents into the ligand framework is one of the most promising methods to improve the enclathration ability of coordination net- works with electron-rich aromatic ring compounds because of the efficient intermolecular interactions between aromatic and fluorinated aromatic rings. Based on this concept, we have designed and prepared the fluorinated flexible ligands 1,4-bis(4-pyridylmethyl)tetrafluorobenzene (bpf), 4,4’-bis(4- pyridylmethyl)octafluorobiphenyl (bpfb), 2,6-bis(4-pyridyl- methyl)hexafluoronaphthalene (2,6-bpfn), and 2,7-bis(4-pyr- idylmethyl)hexafluoronaphthalene (2,7-bpfn), in which two pyridylmethyl groups are bridged by perfluoroaromatic rings[8e,13] (Scheme 1). Herein, we report a comprehensive overview of the metal–ligand network architectures with flu- orinated flexible backbones in which the coordination net- works contain guest organic molecules derived from the flu- orinated ligands, CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2,[1m] and various aromatic com- pounds. Results and Discussion We used various combinations of CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2, fluorinated flexible ligand (bpf, bpfb, 2,6-bpfn and 2,7-bpfn), and aro- matic compounds in H2O:EtOH (1:4), and obtained nearly forty coordination networks in satisfactory yields (19–73%). All of them were characterized by single-crystal X-ray dif- fraction analysis. The reactions with bpf resulted in the formation of many types of host framework whose network topologies vary sig- nificantly depending on slight differences in the structures of the guest molecules. They include 1) a 1D chain network composed of a cyclic linkage with stoichiometry ML2·G (1a, b), 2) 2D grid networks with stoichiometries ML2·G (2a–d), ML2·G2 (3), ML2·G3 (4), and ML2·G4 (5a, b), and 3) a 3D di- amond network with stoichiometry ML2·G2 (6a–h). The 2D grid structures are relatively common host frameworks that appear throughout our experiments. The cavity in the grid network is composed of four metal ions and four ligands, which form a rhombus-like shape. Remarkably, the 2D grid sheets can swell when the number of guest molecules per cavity increases. The reactions with bpfb afforded 2D grid structures that incorporate two guest compound molecules in each cavity and have the stoichiometry ML2·G2 (7, 8a–e). The reactions with 2,6-bpfn afforded a 1D ladder with stoi- chiometry ML1.5·G (9) and three types of 2D networks, namely a 2D rhombus grid with stoichiometry ML2·G2 (10a–c), a twisted 2D thick grid with stoichiometry ML2·G2 (11a–g), and a 2D herringbone pattern with stoichiometry M2L3·G (12). In contrast, 2,7-bpfn, which is a regioisomer of 2,6-bpfn, afforded two types of 2D structures with stoichi- ometry ML2·G2, namely a 2D rhombus grid (13) and a 2D rhombus grid with dumbbell-shaped cavities (14a, b). These networks are summarized in Scheme 2. {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpf)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·PhtBu}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(1a): The coordination geometry of 1a is shown in Figure 1a as a typical example. Two crys- tallographically independent cadmium ions adopt an octahe- dral geometry with four bpf pyridine rings at the equatorial positions and two monodentate NO3  anions at the axial po- sitions. Both ligands adopt cis conformations to form a cyclic framework. The extended structure forms a polymeric 1D chain network by infinite linking of boat-shaped cyclic frameworks (Figure 1b). The adjacent CdII ions are bridged by two cis ligands with a distance of 12.15 O, and one guest molecule of tert-butylbenzene is packed into each cyclic cavity. The cyclic shape is suitable for a guest aromatic com- pound with a bulky substituent; the benzene ring of the guest molecule is packed between two bpf pyridine rings, while the opposite side of the cavity is spacious enough for the bulky tert-butyl group. The aromatic ring of the guest Scheme 1. The fluorinated flexible ligands bpf, bpfb, 2,6-bpfn, and 2,7- bpfn. www.chemeurj.org H 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur.

The H2A···C39 and H35A···C41 distances are 2.938 and 2.978 O, respectively (Figure 1d). A side view of the chains is shown in Figure 1c. These zig-zag 1D coordination poly- mers are linked by hydrogen bonds to form a 2D flat layer. Either coordinating or noncoordinating oxygen atoms of ni- trate anions bind to the methylene groups of both the neigh- boring chains (N5O1···H13B 2.429, N5O3···H31A 2.439, N6O4···H24B 2.442, N6O6···H6A 2.385 O). The guest ar- omatic rings are linked by CH···F hydrogen bonds with neighboring chains. The H39A···F7 and H41A···F2 distances are 2.734 and 2.675 O, respectively. These layers are stacked parallel to each other through CH···F hydrogen bonds (H6B···F1 2.458, H15A···F3 2.587, H24A···F6 2.743, H31B···F8 2.386 O), as shown in Figure 1e. {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpf)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·PhNMe2}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(2a): The coordination envi- ronment of CdII in 2a is octahedral, similar to that of 1a. The crystal structure of 2a belongs to the space group P1¯ and contains half of a CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 moiety, a bpf molecule, and half of an N,N-dimethylaniline molecule per unit cell. The sheet structure is shown in Figure 2a. All the ligands adopt trans conformations, in contrast to the cis conformations found in the 1D chain structures of 1a and 1b. The network topology is a 2D rhombus grid in which the diagonal-to-di- agonal distances and dimensions are 29.79R13.11 and 16.87R15.64 O, respectively. Each cavity surrounded by four CdII ions and four ligands contains one molecule of N,N-di- methylaniline. The aromatic ring of N,N-dimethylaniline is packed between two pyridine rings by edge-to-face interac- tions. The H4A···centroid distance is 2.499 O (Figure 2a). The 2D sheet is relatively flat and is made into layers stacked on each other with an interplanar distance of 5.3 O linked by two types of hydrogen bonds. The N3O3···H12A and H11A···F3 distances are 2.462 and 2.517 O, respectively (Figure 2b). Moreover, the guest molecules are linked by CH···F hydrogen bonds with neighboring sheets (H20A···F4 2.638, H24A···F4 2.284 O), as shown in Fig- ure 2c. The p-xylene clathrated network 2b is isostructural with 2a and has the same space group. {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpf)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·o-C6H4BrOMe}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(2c): The structure of 2c is analogous to that of 2a except that it is about twice the length along the c axis (2a: c=10.717(5); 2c: c= 21.438(4) O).

The sheet structure of 2c is shown in Figure S2a (see Sup- porting Information). In contrast to 2a, whose N,N-dimethyl- aniline guest molecules are present in a disordered pattern, the o-bromoanisole molecules in 2c are clathrated alternate- ly in each cavity. {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpf)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·naphthalene}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(2d): The structure of 2d is also analogous to 2c except that the unit cell consists of one and a half equivalents of CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2, two bpf molecules, and a naphthalene molecule and the corresponding dimension of the c axis is 31.774(5) O. The sheet structure of 2d is shown in Figure S2b (see Supporting Information). There are two types of cavities with slightly different sizes which are alter- nately linked to each other. The naphthalene molecules are also clathrated in each cavity. {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpf)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·(p-C6H4BrMe)2}n (3): The sheet structure of 3 is shown in Figure 3a. It contains four crystallographi- cally independent p-bromotoluene molecules whose bro- mine atom and methyl group are disordered. There are two types of cavities with alternate linking of alignments, each of which contains three p-bromotoluene molecules. Cavities A and B have diagonal-to-diagonal distances of 29.48R14.93 and 28.44R16.34 O and dimensions of 16.56R16.48 and 16.56R16.34 O, respectively. The 2D sheet is relatively flat, Figure 1.

Fujita and is made up into layers stacked and eclipsed on each other along the a axis, with an interplanar distance of 5.6 O (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). It is clear that two guest molecules on each side of the cavity are clathrated across adjacent sheets. {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpf)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·ACHTUNGTRENUNG(C6H6)3}n (4): The sheet structure of 4 is shown in Figure 3b. The diagonal-to-diagonal distances are 29.28R15.03 O and the dimensions of the grid are 16.69R 16.69R16.52R15.95 O. Three benzene molecules are clath- rated in each cavity. This sheet is made up into layers stacked and eclipsed on each other along the c axis. The in- terplanar distance is 5.8 O. {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpf)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·(o-C6H4Me2)4}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(5a): The sheet structure of 5a is shown in Figure 3c as a typical example. The diago- nal-to-diagonal distances are 29.43R16.24 O and the dimen- sions of the grid are 16.97R16.97R16.69R16.69 O. Four o- xylene molecules are clathrated in each cavity. One of the guest molecules is clathrated between two tetrafluoropheny- lene rings with separations of 3.7 and 4.2 O, while one of the other guest molecules is clathrated through the pyridine ring with a separation of 3.6 O. The enclathration ability of the o-xylene network 5a appears to be different to that of the benzene network 4, in which three guest molecules are accommodated, because the benzene molecule is significant- ly smaller than o-xylene. Two of the four guest molecules in the cavity of 5a are, in fact, clathrated across adjacent sheets (pink and light blue molecules in Figure 3c). A side view of the stacking of 5a is shown in Figure S4a (see Sup- porting Information). Interestingly, the adjacent sheets are enantiomers of each other and are stacked alternately. The same enantiomers are eclipsed whereas the opposite enan- tiomers are staggered with an interplanar distance of 6.4 O. {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpf)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·ACHTUNGTRENUNG(PhOCOMe)2}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(6a): In addition to the 1D chain and 2D sheet structures, 3D networks with a dia- mond topology are also formed from CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 and bpf with only very small changes in guest structures. The 3D dia- mond network in 6a–h seems to be the most stable structure for Cd/bpf networks as most varieties of guest organic mole- cule afford this structure. The coordination environment at CdII is the same as those of the other bpf complexes. The crystal structure of 6a belongs to space group C2/c and con- tains half a molecule of CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2, one bpf molecule, and one phenyl acetate molecule per unit cell. All the ligands adopt trans conformations. The resulting extended structure is a 3D diamond framework. The diamond net can be broken down into an adamantane skeleton that consists of four six-membered windows. The adamantane skeleton structure of 6a is shown in Figure 4a. The distances between adjacent CdII ions are 16.62 and 16.60 O, while the Cd-Cd- Cd angles range from 58.26 to 148.738, thereby creating large cavities. This shows that the diamond framework is considerably deformed due to the flexibility of the ligand. The phenyl acetate molecules are clathrated near the pyri- dine rings in the large adamantane unit through a CH···F hydrogen bond with an H23A···F4 distance of 2.509 O. The bulk of the void space is filled by threefold interpenetration of the identical frameworks (Figure 4b) linked by two types of hydrogen bonds. The N3O3···H6B, H10A···F1, Figure 3.

It is noteworthy that all the fluo- rine atoms participate in hydrogen bonds. {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpfb)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)2}n (7): The reaction of CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 with bpfb in the absence of aromatic compounds afforded the simple 2D rhombus grid network 7, as shown in Figure 5. The diagonal-to-diagonal distances are 35.20R 15.05 O and the dimensions of the grid are 19.28R19.28R 19.00R19.00 O. Two molecules of EtOH are clathrated in each cavity. Because the fluorine atoms of the ligands tend toward the inner cavity, the grid structure is considerably distorted to fit around guest molecules that are smaller than aromatic compounds. {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpfb)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(PhOCOMe)2}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(8a): The reac- tion of bpfb with CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 in the presence of aromatic com- pounds such as phenyl acetate, N,N-dimethylaniline, or m-di- methoxybenzene afforded inter- penetrating 2D rhombus grid sheets with an ML2·G2 composi- tion. The sheet structure of 8a, which contains phenyl acetate molecules as guests, is shown in Figure 6a. The crystal structure belongs to space group Pccn and all the ligands adopt trans conformations. Each cavity sur- rounded by four CdII atoms and four bpfb ligands contains two molecules of phenyl acetate as guests. The diagonal-to-diago- nal distances and the dimen- sions of the 2D rhombus grid are 34.10R16.45 O and 18.93 O, respectively. Each guest mole- cule is packed between the per- fluoroaromatic rings of the host framework with face-to-face in- teractions. The shortest inter- molecular contact (C16···C27) is 3.245 O, with an interplanar angle of about 118. The guest aromatic rings are also linked to the opposite perfluoroaromatic ring through CH···F hy- drogen bonds (H26A···F3 2.572 O). The large cavity is filled by twofold parallel interpenetration of the identical frame- works. The puckered sheet of 8a is shown in Figures 6b and 6c; two sheets engage complementarily in parallel inter- penetration to form a planar layer. The mode of interpene- tration is topologically identical to the recently reported in- terpenetrating coordination network structures of [Co- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(Py2S)2Cl2]n,[14] [Cd2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(Py2C3H6)4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)]n,[15] [Mn2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NCS)4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(Py2C3H6)4]n,[16] and [Fe(N3)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(Py2C3H6)2]n.[17] The in- terpenetrating cyclic framework is shown in Figure 6d. Each framework is linked by two types of hydrogen bonds. The N3O2···H19B and H11A···F3 distances are 2.539 and 2.635 O, respectively. Interestingly, the adjacent layers are eclipsed by a 1808 rotation around the vertical c axis of the layers. These layers are stacked in a staggered manner and alternate layers are eclipsed completely, with an interplanar distance of 10.5 O (Figure 6e). Each layer is linked by C H···F hydrogen bonds, as shown in Figure 6 f. The H6A···F7 and H6B···F7 distances are 2.647 and 2.719 O, respectively. The structures of 8b and 8c are identical to that of 8a and have the same space group (Pccn). {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpfb)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·ACHTUNGTRENUNG(biphenyl)2}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(8d): Although the host framework of 8d is a rhombus-based 2D grid with twofold Figure 5.

The two benzene rings of the guest biphenyl molecule are in simul- taneous contact with two tetra- fluoroaromatic rings of the ligand. The shortest intermolec- ular contacts (C16···C29 and C9···C35) are 3.545 and 3.583 O, respectively. The guest aromatic rings are also linked to the opposite perfluoroaro- matic ring by CH···F hydrogen bonds (H29A···F1 2.734, H30A···F3 2.773 O). The layers slide to align CdII ions along the a axis, which results in a lengthening of the interplanar distance from 10.5 to 12.5 O (Figure 7b) and a different space group (Pcca). These layers are actually staggered, as can be seen in the side view down the b axis, and alternate layers are completely eclipsed. Solvent molecules of EtOH and H2O fill the vacan- cies between the layers. Nevertheless, channels are still ob- served in the solid along the a axis (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpfb)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·(naphthalene)2}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(8e): Remarkably, for- mation of an asymmetrical alignment of layers occurs in 8e (space group Cc). The host framework is analogous to those of 8a–d, as shown in Figure S6a (see Supporting Informa- tion). The diagonal-to-diagonal distances are 33.75R16.96 O and the dimensions of the grid are 18.96R18.96R18.81R 18.81 O. Both of the guest naphthalene molecules, which are crystallographically independent, are in contact with two perfluoroaromatic rings of alternate ligands. However, the face-to-face interactions are weaker than those in 8a and 8d. The shortest intermolecular contacts (C14···C67 and C35···C49) are 3.881 and 3.771 O, respectively. The guest ar- omatic rings are linked with perfluoroaromatic ring by C H···F hydrogen bonds (H59A···F3 2.616, H67A···F3 2.754, H64A···F4 2.531, H54A···F13 2.647, H49A···F14 2.744, and H49A···F16 2.784 O). The packing mode of the layers is shown in Figure 7d. All the layers are stacked in an eclipsed manner with an interplanar distance of 10.6 O. In conse- quence, channels run in the solid between the a and b axes (see Figure S6b in the Supporting Information). {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(2,6-bpfn)1.5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·EtOH}n (9): The reaction of 2,6- bpfn with CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 in the absence of aromatic compounds afforded the 1D ladder network 9. Solvent EtOH molecules are clathrated in the coordination ladder. The coordination geometry is heptacoordinate, as shown in Figure 8a. Three ligand pyridyl moieties, all of which adopt trans conforma- tions, form a T-shaped arrangement at the metal ion, and the remaining coordination sites are occupied by two biden- tate nitrate anions. The T-shaped connecting units are linked to give a 1D ladder framework, as shown in Figure 8b. Each Figure 7.

These zigzag 1D ladder frameworks align parallel to each other to fill the bulk of the void space in each cavity (Figure 8d). {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(2,6-bpfn)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·ACHTUNGTRENUNG(p-C6H4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(OMe)2)2}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(10a): A top view of the 2D rhombus grid sheet of 10a is shown in Fig- ure 9a. The crystal structure belongs to the space group C2/ c, and all the ligands adopt trans conformations. Each cavity clathrates two p-dimethoxybenzene molecules as guests. The distances between diagonal CdII ions are 33.63R13.60 O, and the grid dimensions are 18.14 O. There are effective face-to-face interactions between the perfluoroaromatic ring of the host and the aromatic ring of guest in which the shortest intermolecular contract (C10···C28) is 3.411 O. A side view of the sheetsS stacking is shown in Figure 9b. Inter- estingly, adjacent sheets are enantiomers of each other, with alternate stacking: the homochiral species are eclipsed whereas the heterochiral species are staggered, with an in- terplanar distance of 6.3 O. Each layer is linked by two types of hydrogen bonds, as shown in Figure 9c. The N3 O3···H20A and H4A···F3 distances are 2.525 and 2.520 O, respectively. Moreover, the guest aromatic rings are linked by CH···F hydrogen bonds with neighboring sheets (H27A···F2 2.653 O). The structure of 10b is identical to that of 10a and has the same space group (C2/c). {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(2,6-bpfn)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·ACHTUNGTRENUNG(biphenyl)2}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(10c): The sheet struc- ture of 10c is shown in Figure 10. There are two cavities with alternate linking of alignments; these cavities are exact- ly rhomboid. The diagonal-to-diagonal distances are 35.34R 15.36 and 33.71R16.03 O and the dimensions of the grid are 18.83R19.69 and 18.83R18.49 O in cavities A and B, respec- tively. Although three biphenyl molecules are apparently en- closed in each cavity, these are disordered and/or are clath- rated across the sheets. As a consequence, the grid frame- work is capable of swelling (cf. the shorter diagonals of 10a). These layers are stacked on each other in an eclipsed manner, with an interplanar distance of 6.4 O (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(2,6-bpfn)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·(p-C6H4Me2)2}n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(11a): The most common framework with 2,6-bpfn is a twisted 2D grid-type sheet with an ML2·G2 stoichiometry. A top view of the sheet structure is shown in Figure 11a. The coordination environ- ment of CdII in 11a is similar to those in 10a–c. All the li- gands adopt cis conformations, unlike the 2D grid sheet structures of 10a–c, in which all ligands adopt trans confor- mations. The topology of this sheet is the same as the grid structures with a [4,4] topology; each cavity is surrounded by four CdII ions and four ligands. Two types of cavities are alternately repeated, and each encloses two p-xylene mole- cules. The larger cavity (cavity A) can enclose two p-xylene molecules edge-to-edge. In the smaller cavity (cavity B), the host framework ring is extremely twisted and each half-iso- lated void is filled with a p-xylene molecule. Efficient face- to-face interactions between the perfluoroaromatic rings of the host framework and the guest molecules are observed. Two guest molecules in the twisted smaller cavity B are clathrated between two perfluoroaromatic rings, with a shortest intermolecular contact (C15···C29) of 3.762 O, while two guest molecules in the larger cavity A are clathrated be- tween two perfluoroaromatic rings of adjacent layers with a shortest intermolecular contact (C10···C25) of 3.353 O (Fig- ure 11c). The layer is flat and thick, which results in large channels between the a and b axes in which the guest mole- Figure 9.

ACHTUNGTRENUNG{[Cd2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(2,6-bpfn)3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)4]·PhNHMe}n (12): The coordination geometry around the CdII ion in 12 is heptacoordinate, as for 9. Figure 12a shows a herringbone sheet with disordered guest molecules. Each cavity is surrounded by six CdII ions and six ligands and can apparently clathrate three guest molecules. The large cavities are filled by two adjacent sheets and the guest molecule is clathrated between the flu- orinated naphthalene rings of ligands from different frame- works, with effective face-to-face interactions (Figure 12b). One guest molecule is clathrated in the center of a large cavity in a herringbone topology. Each guest molecule is clathrated between two perfluoroaromatic rings of adjacent layers, with a shortest intermolecular contact (C8···C38) of 3.407 O. This puckered sheet is made up into layers stacked on top of each other, with an interplanar distance of 2.9 O. As a consequence, the sequence of the three herringbone sheets is of the ABC type with an M2L3·G composition. Channels run along the a axis, as shown in Figure S8 (see Supporting Information). {[CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(2,7-bpfn)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m-C6H4ACHTUNGTRENUNG(OMe)2)2}n (13): A top view of 13, whose structure is identical to those of 2,6-bpfn net- works 10a and 10b, with the same space group (C2/c), is shown in Figure 13.

The coordination geometry around the CdII ion is similar to that of 13, except for the cis conformation of the 2,7-bpfn ligand. Although the topology is same as that of a grid, the appearance of the sheet is far from it. Each cavity is shaped like a dumbbell, and two m-xylene mole- cules are clathrated in both “weights” of the dumbbell by face-to-face interaction with the perfluoroaromatic rings of the host, with a shortest C···C intermolecular contact (C11···C24) of 3.620 O. A side view of the stacking is shown in Figure 14b. The parallel infinite layers of the puckered sheets are eclipsed, with a separation of 8.0 O. Each layer is linked by hydrogen bonds, as shown in Figure 14c. The N3 O2···H9 and N3O2···H11 distances are 2.524 and 2.614 O, respectively. Channels with dumbbell shapes run perpendic- ularly to the planes along the grid sheets (Figure 14d). The influence of fluorine atoms: The remarkable enclathra- tion ability of these coordination networks is caused by the fluorine atoms contained in the flexible ligands. The impor- tance of the perfluoroaromatic rings was demonstrated by controlled experiments with the nonfluorinated ligand 1,4- bis(4-pyridylmethyl)benzene (bpb), which is an analogue of bpf. We attempted to obtain clathrate networks from Cd- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 and bpb in the presence of a large excess of N,N-di- methylaniline, m-xylene, or phenyl acetate under the same reaction conditions as for bpf. All the attempts were unsuc- cessful and we obtained an interpenetrating infinite ladder structure that has been reported previously.[13,18] The fluorine atoms of the ligands are mainly responsible for their high enclathration ability. Ever since a stable 1:1 complex of benzene and perfluorobenzene consisting of a face-to-face stack of alternating molecules was reported in 1960,[19] arene–perfluoroarene interactions have been utiliz- ed as organizational motifs in crystal engineering.[20] In addi- tion to the face-to-face interactions, CH···F interactions have been discussed in the crystal structures of hydroaro- matic and perfluoroaromatic molecules with a H···F separa- tion of around 2.3–2.7 O.[20e,21] Most flexible coordination networks have effective CH···F interactions between the host perfluoroaromatic frameworks and guest aromatic rings, as well as between the individual host networks through the methylene or pyridine H atoms. Interestingly, bpfb, 2,6-bpfn, and 2,7-bpfn networks have more efficient face-to-face interactions than bpf networks because of their larger perfluoroaromatic rings, with the shortest C···C con- tact ranging from around 3.2 to 3.8 O. The flexibility of the ligands is affected by the guest mole- cules: The flexibility of the bridging ligands is very impor- tant for constructing clathrate coordination networks that vary in the size, shape, and number of guest organic molecules. In the case of bpf networks, guest aromatic compounds containing bulky groups, such as tert-butyl- benzene, are suitable for a 1D chain structure with a cyclic cavity in which all the ligands adopt cis conformations, where- as planar guest molecules such as N,N-dimethylaniline prefer a 2D grid sheet in which all the ligands adopt trans conforma- tions. The presence of methyl- ene groups between the pyri- dine and tetrafluorophenylene moieties causes a dependence of the network structure on the guest molecules. A typical ex- ample of the cis–trans conver- sion can be seen for 13, 14a, and 14b, which have the same Figure 13. Top view of the 2D sheet of 13. Hydrogen atoms, nitrate anions, and clathrated solvent molecules have been omitted for clarity. Figure 14.

Fujita 2,7-bpfn ligand. All the ligands in 13 (rhombus 2D grid framework) adopt a trans conformation, while in 14a,b (2D grid with dumbbell-shaped cavity) they adopt a cis confor- mation, with the same topology of the rhombus grid. Interestingly, 2D grid networks with bpf can be elastic de- pending on the number of guest molecules. A comparison of the structures of 2a, 3, 4, and 5a shows that the size of each cavity becomes larger as the number of guest molecules per cavity increases, as shown in Figure 15. Note that three guest molecules per cavity are considered for 3. The bulk of the void space increases gradually with the number of guest molecules due to structural variation of the coordination framework. Focusing on the arrangement of pyridine and tetrafluorophenylene in 2a, the edges of two opposing pyri- dine rings point towards the inside of the cavity, and two neighboring tetrafluorophenylene groups are in contact through edge-to-face interactions, with a shortest C···F dis- tance of 3.63 O. Consequently, the cavity has no space around the metal cations and is filled with only one guest molecule at the center of the cavity. In contrast, the cavities of 3, 4, and 5a have enough space for three or four guest molecules because the planes of the tetrafluorophenylene groups tend to face towards the inside of the cavity. These differences are attributed to the conformational freedom around the methylene group between the pyridine and tetra- fluorophenylene rings. Figure 16 shows Newman projections of the ligands contained in 2a and 5a. The dihedral angles in 2a are 92.438 and 112.198, and those in 5a range from 91.068 to 101.768. A high value for this angle means that the tetrafluorophenylene ring occupies a space in the cavity, whereas a value near to 908 results in a void space in the cavity. The metal–metal distances in a cavity can also vary accordingly. The shorter diagonal–diagonal distances in- crease from 13.11 to 16.24 O as the number of guest mole- cules increases (the mean distance in 3 is 15.73 O, which is between those of 4 and 5a). These values are consistent with their enclathration abilities. Conclusion We have demonstrated that the fluorinated flexible ligands bpf, bpfb, 2,6-bpfn, and 2,7-bpfn form a variety of clathrate coordination networks with CdII in the presence of organic molecules. The diversity of network topologies is induced by interactions between the guest molecules and the flexible ligand frameworks. While host networks are mainly retained by O···H hydrogen bonds with the nitrate anions, guest or- ganic molecules are mainly retained by the host networks by forming intermolecular interactions with the perfluoroaro- matic rings. Host–guest CH···F hydrogen bonds are formed for all the networks, whereas efficient face-to-face interac- tions between hydroaromatic and perfluoroaromatic rings are formed predominantly in the bpfb, 2,6-bpfn, and 2,7- bpfn systems. We have therefore developed a series of guest-dependent flexible coordination networks that open the way to new possibilities for metal–ligand architectures with novel structures and topologies.

Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C60H40CdF12N6O10 ([CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(2,7-bpfn)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]·ACHTUNGTRENUNG(PhOCOMe)2): C 53.56, H 3.00, N 6.25; found: C 53.56, H 3.09, N 6.28. X-ray structure determinations: The data for all the structures were mea- sured with a Bruker SMART/CCD diffractometer (MoKa radiation, l= 0.71073 O) by the w–2q scan technique using frames of 0.38 oscillation. An empirical absorption correction was applied using SADABS. All the structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least- squares against F2 of all data using the SHELXTL program package. The positions of the hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically, assigned isotropic thermal parameters, and allowed to ride on their respective parent atoms before the final cycle of least-squares refinements.

Attempts to obtain clathrate networks from bpb: The reaction of Cd- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·4H2O (9.3 mg, 0.03 mmol) in H2O (0.25 mL), bpb (16 mg, 0.06 mmol) in ethanol (1 mL), and phenyl acetate (0.24 mL, 1.9 mmol) was attempted under the same reaction conditions as for bpf. After the mixture was allowed to stand for 48 h at room temperature, [CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpb)1.5- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]n was obtained as colorless, pillar-shaped crystals in 31% yield (6.1 mg). The structure was identified by preliminary X-ray measurement of a single crystal to determine the unit cell parameters and space group. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C27H24CdN5O6 ([CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpb)1.5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]n): C 51.73, H 3.86, N 11.17; found: C 51.71, H 3.20, N 11.05. The same reac- tion in the presence of N,N-dimethylaniline or m-xylene also gave [Cd- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bpb)1.5ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2]n in 33% (6.2 mg) and 32% (6.1 mg) yield, respectively. These structures were identified by preliminary X-ray measurements of single crystals.
