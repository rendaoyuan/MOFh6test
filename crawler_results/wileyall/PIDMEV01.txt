Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/chem.200601534 Reversible Transformation of ZnII Coordination Geometry in a Single Crystal of Porous Metal-Organic Framework [Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)2]·4EtOH Myunghyun Paik Suh,* Young Eun Cheon, and Eun Young Lee[a] Introduction Metal-organic open frameworks (MOFs) have diverse po- tential applications as new materials in gas storage,[1–5] mo- lecular adsorption and separation processes,[6–12] ion-ex- change,[13–15] catalysis,[16–18] sensors,[19–21] and fabrication of metal nanoparticles.[22,23] In particular, the MOFs that trans- form their structures reversibly with retention of the single crystallinity in response to external stimuli are important for the development of new and technologically useful materials including devices and sensors. For a general applicability, MOFs should have permanent porosity and high thermal stability. However, when MOFs are prepared, they often contain metal ions that are coordinated to solvent mole- cules; also, the open structures commonly collapse on re- moval of the coordinating solvent molecules. Therefore, the chance of finding the MOFs that exhibit permanent porosity after removal of coordinating solvent molecules is extremely rare.[24–28] MOFs that released the coordinating solvent mole- cules are seldom characterized by the X-ray crystallography due to the loss of single crystallinity.[28–30] Despite the lack of X-ray crystal structures, however, it has been generally be- lieved that MOFs generate vacant coordination sites when coordinating solvent molecules are removed from the metal ions; such MOFs have been anticipated to enhance the hy- drogen storage capability.[27,31–33] Here we report, based on the single-crystal X-ray struc- tures, that a porous 3D metal-organic framework [Zn3- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntbB)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)2]n·4nEtOH (1) changes the coordination ge- ometry of ZnII ions reversibly from/to trigonal bipyramid to/ from tetrahedron (both of which are the thermodynamically most stable coordination forms) upon removal and rebind- ing of coordinating solvent molecules rather than simply generating vacant coordination sites. Despite this coordina- tion flexibility of metal ions, the host framework structure as well as single crystallinity is retained during the desolva- tion and resolvation processes. The desolvated solid [Zn3- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2]n (1’), which lost a coordinating EtOH as well as guest EtOH molecules, exhibits permanent porosity (Lang- muir surface area = 419 m2g1; pore volume = 0.15 cm3cm3) and remarkable gas storage capabilities for N2, H2, CO2, and CH4. Abstract: A 3D porous metal-organic framework [Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)2]n·4nEt- ACHTUNGTRENUNGOH (1) that generates 1D channels of honeycomb aperture has been pre- pared by the solvothermal reaction of ZnACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·6H2O and 4,4’,4’’-nitrilotris- benzoic acid (H3NTB) in EtOH at 1108C. Framework 1 exhibits reversible single-crystal-to-single-crystal transfor- mations upon removal and rebinding of the coordinating EtOH as well as the EtOH guest molecules, which give rise to desolvated crystal [Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2]n (1’) and resolvated crystal [Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)2]n·4nEtOH (1’’). The X-ray structures indicate that 3D host frame- work is retained during the transforma- tions from 1 to 1’ and from 1’ to 1’’, but the coordination geometry of ZnII ions changes from/to trigonal bipyramid to/ from tetrahedron, concomitant with the rotational rearrangement of a car- boxylate plane of the NTB3 relative to its associated phenyl ring. To retain the single crystal integrity, extensive coop- erative motions must exist between the molecular components throughout the crystal. Framework 1’ exhibits perma- nent porosity, thermal stability up to 4008C, and blue luminescence, and high storage capabilities for N2, H2, CO2, and CH4.

J. 2007, 13, 4208 – 4215 4208 Results and Discussion Preparation and X-ray structure of 1: A metal-organic open framework [Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)2]n·4nEtOH (1) has been pre- pared by the solvothermal reaction of ZnACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·6H2O and H3NTB in EtOH at 1108C. Previously, we reported a differ- ent porous framework [Zn4OACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2]n·3nDEF·nEtOH (2; DEF = diethylformamide), which was prepared from the same starting materials but in the different solvent system, DEF/EtOH/H2O (5:3:2 v/v/v).[2] Upon desolvation of 2, the framework structure changed as a result of the rotation of mo- lecular components, but upon resolvation with EtOH, pyri- dine, or benzene, 2 was regener- ated. However, when the same solvothermal reaction was car- ried out in EtOH in the present study, we obtained framework 1, which has an X-ray structure and properties completely dif- ferent from those of 2. The X-ray crystal structure of 1 is shown in Figure 1. In 1, each NTB3 coordinates six ZnII ions because every carbox- ylate group behaves as a biden- tate to bind two ZnII ions. The NTB3 looks like a propeller since the average dihedral angle between the phenyl rings is 71.3(1)8. The central nitrogen of NTB3 exhibits sp2 hybridiza- tion, showing C-N-C average angles of 119.1(2)8 and a unusu- ally short NC bond lengths [av 1.423(3) K]. There are crystal- lographically independent two ZnII centers: Zn1 and Zn2. They form a Zn3 cluster unit in the sequence of Zn1–Zn2–Zn1 by binding to the carboxylate groups of NTB3 with a two- fold rotational symmetry at Zn2 (Figure 1a). Zn1 shows a distorted trigonal bipyramidal (tbp) coordination geometry, being coordinated with four carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2, O4, O5, and O6) of four dif- ferent NTB3 ligands and with an oxygen atom (O7) of EtOH at the axial site of tbp geometry. Although alcohols are extremely weak ligands, there are a few reports on MeOH coordination to ZnII ion.[25,34] In 1, a EtOH molecule coordinates a ZnII ion with the ZnO bond length of 2.261(5) K, which is significantly longer than Zn1O- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NTB3) bond lengths [av 1.992(2) K]. Zn2 shows distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry, being coordinated with four oxygen atoms, each from four different NTB3 ligands. The Zn3 cluster units are connected repeatedly by O5 and O6 of NTB3 to form a 1D chain that extends along the [101] direction (Figure 1a). One of the Zn1 atoms of a Zn3 cluster unit and the nitro- gen atom of NTB3 are located alternately at the corners of hexagonal compartments, which gives rise to a 2D honey- comb-like layer extending parallel to the (001) plane (Fig- ure 1b). Since each of the two Zn1 atoms in a Zn3 cluster unit is involved in the formation of the 2D layer, a bilayer Figure 1.

The bilayers with Zn3 pillars are linked infinitely through O5 and O6 atoms of the NTB3 (Figure 1c), which gives rise to a 3D framework generating 1D channels of honeycomb aperture. The edge length of a hexagonal compartment is 8.04 K, and the effective size of the hexagonal pore is about 7.72 K. The channels are occu- pied by EtOH molecules coor- dinating Zn1 ions as well as EtOH guest molecules. The void volumes of 1 with and without coordinating EtOH molecules are 39 and 48%, re- spectively, as estimated by PLATON.[35] In the 3D frame- work, two phenyl rings of each NTB3 are involved in the edge-to-face p–p interactions with those of the adjacent layer {the shortest C–C distance: C10–C16 (x0.5, y+1.5, z), 3.828(6) K; dihedral angle, 78.9(2)8}. Thermogravimetric analysis of 1 reveals 22% weight loss at 25–1168C (see Supporting Information), which corresponds to all coordinating EtOH as well as EtOH guest molecules (calcd 22.6%). The host framework is thermally stable up to 4008C, as evi- denced by the temperature de- pendent XRPD patterns (see Supporting Information). Solid 1 and its desolvated solid (1’) exhibit luminescence at lmax= 482 and 475 nm, respectively, upon photo-irradiation at 340 nm (see Supporting Infor- mation). Single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations of 1: These transformations involve reversi- ble coordination geometry changes of ZnII upon removal and rebinding of coordinating EtOH molecules. The X-ray crystal structures of MOFs, where coordinating solvent mol- ecules are removed, are extremely rare.[28–30] This is because single-crystallinities and/or open framework structures are commonly destroyed when coordinating solvent molecules are removed from MOFs. Contrary to the common MOFs, when crystal 1 was heated at 1508C under vacuum for 5 h to remove the coordinating EtOH as well as the guest EtOH molecules, [Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2]n (1’) was obtained with retention of the single crystallinity. The X-ray crystal structure of 1’ re- veals that the framework structure and the packing mode of 1 are retained (Figure 2), but the molecular rearrangements involving alteration of coordination geometry of Zn1 occur in 1’. The coordination geometry of Zn1 changes from a trigonal bipyramid to a coordinatively saturated tetrahe- dron, instead of a trigonal pyramid that contains a vacant coordination site at the apical position (Scheme 1).

Rearrangement of coordination geometry of Zn1 on removal and rebinding of a coordinating EtOH molecule. www.chemeurj.org G 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2007, 13, 4208 – 4215 4210 M. P. Suh et al. ticular, the O4-Zn1-O5 angle increases from 91.7(2) to 106.8(1)8, and the bond length of Zn1O4 decreases from 2.138(3) to 1.943(2) K. Furthermore, the carboxylate plane of O5-C15-O6, which connects two Zn3 cluster units via ter- minal Zn1 atoms, undergoes a rotational motion relative to its associated phenyl ring, and alters the dihedral angle be- tween them from 8.7(8) to 17.7(5)8 (Figure 3a). Interestingly, this crystal dynamics are reversible. When desolvated crystal 1’ is exposed to EtOH vapor for 3 h, re- solvated crystal 1’’ results. The X-ray crystal structure of 1’’ indicates that the original structure of 1 is restored (Fig- ure 3b). That is, even though Zn1 of 1’ is in a coordinatively saturated tetrahedron geometry, it provides a coordination site for the EtOH molecule and rearranges to a trigonal bi- pyramidal coordination geometry. In the transformation of 1’ to 1’’, the O4-Zn1-O5 angle decreases from 106.8(1) to 88.7(2)8 and the bond length of Zn1O4 increases to 2.164(3) K. In addition, the carboxylate plane of O5-C15-O6 undergoes a reverse rotational motion with respect to its as- sociated phenyl ring to restore the structure of 1. In short, the single crystal transformations of 1 ! 1’ ! 1’’ involve dy- namic motions altering the coordination geometry of ZnII from/to trigonal bipyramid to/from tetrahedron as well as the rotation of a carboxylate plane relative to its associated phenyl ring of NTB3. In order for the material to retain its single crystal integrity, extensive cooperative movements must exist between the molecular components throughout the crystal. There have been only three reports so far for the X-ray crystal structures of the MOFs that released the coordinat- ing solvent molecules from the metal ions.[28–30] In one MOF, the CuII ion loses a water molecule from the axial site of the square pyramidal geometry to provide the square planar CuII ion.[28] In the other MOF, the CoII ion in the octahedral geometry loses a water molecule to give a square pyramidal CoII ion.[29] In both cases, metal ions do not rearrange the coordination geometries and generate vacant coordination sites. However, in the third MOF, the CoII ion in octahedral geometry rearranges to trigonal bipyramid upon removal of coordinating water molecules.[30] Based on the present re- sults together with the previous reports, we suggest that the metal ions in MOFs transform their geometry to thermody- namically the most stable ones on release and uptake of the coordinating solvent molecules, instead of simply generating vacant coordination sites. Gas-sorption properties: To verify the porosity of solid 1’ that lost the coordinating EtOH molecules as well as the EtOH guest molecules, gas sorption isotherms were mea- sured with N2, H2, CO2, and CH4 (Figure 4 and Table 1). Solid 1’ adsorbs N2 to show a reversible type I isotherm, which indicates a permanent microporosity. The gas sorption shows a little hysteresis between adsorption/desorption curves, suggesting a small amount of mesoporosity that is at- tributed to the intercrystalline voids.[36,37] The Langmuir sur- face area and pore volume, estimated by applying the Lang- muir and Dubinin–Radushkevich equations, are 419 m2g1 and 0.14 cm3g1 (0.15 cm3cm3), respectively. A plot of pore size distribution based on Horvath–Kawazoe (HK) model[38] indicates that pore diameter of 1’ is about 4.6 K (see Sup- porting Information). Solid 1’ also adsorbs H2 up to 1.0 wt% at 77 K and 1 atm (112 cm3g1 at STP, 4.7 H2 molecules per formula unit). This weight percent of H2 adsorption is not so high, but the den- sity of adsorbed H2 at 77 K and 1 atm (0.072 gcm3) is extra- ordinarily high and comparable to that (0.072 gcm3) of the supercritical fluid at 77 K and 478 atm.[39] Furthermore, a higher hydrogen sorption capacity is expected under higher pressures because the H2 sorption isotherm of 1’ is not yet fully saturated at 1 atm. Solid 1’ reveals high CO2 and CH4 sorption capacities. It adsorbs 29.7 wt% (6.75 mmolg1, 151 cm3g1 at STP) of Figure 3.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 4211 FULL PAPER Porous Metal-Organic Frameworks CO2 at 195 K and 1 atm, and 6.9 wt% (1.57 mmolg1, 35.3 cm3g1 at STP) of CO2 at 273 K and 1 atm. For the CO2 sorption data also a hysteresis exists between adsorption/de- sorption curves, which is attributed to the intercrystalline voids.[36,37] The gas isotherms for CH4 indicate that 1’ stores CH4 up to 5.7 wt% (3.55 mmolg1, 79.4 cm3g1 at STP) at 195 K, and 2.8 wt% (1.72 mmolg1, 38.5 cm3g1 at STP) at 273 K. These data are superior to those of other MOFs that stores CO2 and CH4.[40,41] These gas sorption properties may be applied in gas stor- age and/or separation. For instance, 1’ can be applied in pu- rification of H2 since it has much higher adsorption capabili- ties for N2 and CO2 than H2 in the low-pressure range. The removal of small amounts of contaminant gases from H2 is important for the economical use of hydrogen as a fuel. In addition, it can be also applied in CO2 removal from the natural gas since its adsorption capacity for CO2 at 195 K is higher than that of CH4. Ethanol vapor sorption of 1’: The X-ray crystal data suggest that the transformation of 1’ to 1’’ involves two types of EtOH binding: one is direct coordination to the metal ions and the other is inclusion in the channels. The EtOH vapor sorption isotherm indicates that solid 1’ adsorbs ethanol in the two step-wise manner (Figure 5). At low pressure re- gions with a shallow plateau (p=0–0.03 atm), the amount of uptake is 2.0 molmol1 for 1’. At higher pressure regions (p=0.03–0.05 atm), the ethanol vapor adsorption sharply in- creases and the amount of uptake at near saturation pres- sure is 3.5 molmol1 for 1’. This corresponds to the two EtOH molecules coordinating ZnII ions and four EtOH guest molecules included in the channels per formula unit of 1’, which is in agreement with the X-ray structure of 1. Conclusion We have demonstrated by complete X-ray single crystal analyses of 1, 1’ and 1’’ that the metal ions in MOF rear- range the coordination geometry to the thermodynamically Figure 4.

This is contrary to our general expectation that MOFs would generate vacant coordination sites when coordinating solvent molecules are removed from the metal ions. Despite the coordination flexibility, the pres- ent MOF retains its framework structure as well as the single crystallinity during the release and uptake of the coor- dinating EtOH as well as EtOH guest molecules. The mate- rial exhibits permanent porosity and remarkable gas sorp- tion capabilities for N2, H2, CO2, and CH4 even after loss of coordinating EtOH as well as EtOH guest molecules. The interesting reversible single-crystal dynamics and the signifi- cant gas-sorption capabilities of the present MOF can find useful applications in sensors as well as gas storage and/or separation materials. Experimental Section General methods: All chemicals and solvents used in the syntheses were of reagent grade and were used without further purification. 4,4’,4’’-Nitri- lotrisbenzoic acid (H3NTB) was prepared according to the method previ- ously reported.[42] Measurements: Infrared spectra were recorded with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR spectrophotometer. UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda35 UV/Vis spectropho- tometer. Emission spectra were recorded with a Perkin Elmer LS55 lumi- nescence spectrophotometer. Elemental analyses were performed by the analytical laboratory of Seoul National University. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were per- formed at a scan rate of 58Cmin1 using TGA Q50 and DSC Q10 of TA instruments, respectively. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data were recorded on a Mac Science M18XHF-22 diffractometer at 50 kV and 100 mA for CuKa (l=1.54050 K) with a scan speed of 58min1 and a step size of 0.028 in 2q. ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)2]n·4nEtOH (1): A EtOH (10 mL) solution of H3NTB (0.120 g, 3.2Q104 mol) and a EtOH (2 mL) solution of ZnACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·6H2O (0.160 g, 5.4Q104 mol) were mixed in a Teflon vessel within the auto- clave. The vessel was heated at 1108C for 24 h and then cooled to room temperature. Brown rod-like crystals formed, which were filtered, and washed briefly with EtOH. Yield: 0.153 g, 78%; FT-IR (KBr pellet): n˜ = 1592, 1537 (O-C=O), 3070 (C-H of NTB), 2972 cm1 (C-H of EtOH); UV/Vis (diffuse reflectance spectrum): lmax=257, 316, 378 (sh), 426 nm (sh); elemental analysis calcd (%) for Zn3C54H60N2O18 (1221.24): C 53.11, H 4.95, N 2.29; found: C 51.82, H 4.78, N 2.53. ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2]n (1’): Single crystal 1 was introduced in a glass capillary with an open end and was desolvated at 1508C under 1 Torr for 5 h. After des- olvation, drying pistol was filled with dry air (1.0 atm), and then the ca- pillary was taken out, and sealed for X-ray structure determination. For bulk preparation, crystals of 1 were heated at 1508C under vacuum for 5 h. FT-IR (KBr pellet): n˜ =1595 (O-C=O), 3066 cm1 (C-H of NTB); UV/Vis (diffuse reflectance spectrum): lmax=259, 315, 385 (sh), 430 nm (sh); elemental analysis calcd (%) for Zn3C42H24N2O12 (944.74): C 53.39, H 2.56, N 2.97; found: C 51.64, H 3.13, N 2.88. ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)2]n·4nEtOH (1’’): After the cell parameters of single crystal 1’ were determined in a sealed capillary, one side of the capillary was broken, and then EtOH vapor was allowed to diffuse into the crystal for 3 h. The opening of the capillary was sealed again for collection of the X-ray diffraction data of 1’’. For bulk preparation, 1’ was exposed to EtOH vapor for 3 h, or immersed in EtOH for 5 min. Gas-sorption study: Gas-sorption isotherms for 1’ were measured on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 instrument. Solid 1 was dried at 608C under vacuum for 2 h. An exactly measured amount of the dried solid was in- troduced into the gas-sorption apparatus, and evacuated at 308C under ca. 105 Torr for 24 h. Gas sorption isotherms for N2 and H2 were moni- tored at 77 K and those for CO2 and CH4 were measured at both 195 K and at 273 K, at each equilibrium pressure by the static volumetric method. X-ray crystallography: Diffraction data for 1, 1’, and 1’’ were collected with an Enraf Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer (MoKa, l=0.71073 K, graphite monochromator). Preliminary orientation matrices and unit cell parameters were obtained from the peaks of the first ten frames and then refined using the whole data set. Frames were integrated and cor- rected for Lorentz and polarization effects by using DENZO.[43] The scal- ing and the global refinement of crystal parameters were performed by SCALEPACK.[43] No absorption correction was made. The crystal struc- tures were solved by the direct methods[44] and refined by full-matrix least-squares refinement using the SHELXL-97 computer program.[45] The positions of all non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement factors. The hydrogen atoms were positioned geometrically and refined using a riding model. For 1 and 1’’, four EtOH guest mole- cules per formula unit of host framework were refined. The crystallo- graphic data and the selected bond lengths and angles for 1, 1’, and 1’’ are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.
