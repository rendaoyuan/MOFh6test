In this paper, phosphine has been successfully incorporated for the first time into three-dimensional (3D) MOFs. The MOFs are based on rigid L2M2 dimeric secondary building blocks assembled from Cu(I) and a pyridyl diphosphine ligand, 4-(3,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)phenyl)pyridine, with Br−(CuL-Br), Cl−(CuL-Br), or PF6 −(CuL-PF6) as counteranions. The structures have a 4.122 net topology, which can be further simplified to 64.82-qtz. The MOFs contain 1D homochiral channels. The PF6 −anions hosted in the 1D channel of CuL-PF6 can be readily exchanged with Br−or Cl−while keeping the framework intact. The materials show anion-tunable flexible porosity. CuL-Br reveals gradual uptake of MeOH, while CuL-PF6 exhibits stepwise sorption for MeOH. The heterogeneous Lewis acid catalytic activity of the MOFs has been shown in ketalization reaction. CuL-Br and CuL-PF6 are active in the reactions between ethylene glycol and 2-butanone/cyclohexanone, up to 93% yield with 0.2 mol % catalyst loading. In contrast, no reaction happens between ethylene glycol and bulky benzophenone, suggesting profound size selectivity. The catalysts can be reused with the framework left intact for three runs without loss of activity. KEYWORDS: metal−organic framework, phosphine, copper, sorption, catalysis 1. INTRODUCTION The chemistry of metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) has been developing rapidly in last two decades,1 while phosphine-based networks are less studied, in comparison with the large number of metal carboxylate MOFs.1a Phosphines are a type of ligands in which electronic and steric properties can be tuned over a wide range. Phosphine based ligands are extremely attractive not only in coordination chemistry but also in homogeneous catalysis. Metal complexes with (chiral) phosphorus ligands are among the most efficient and selective catalysts for organic transformations including many industrial processes such as hydrogenation, hydroformylation, coupling reaction, asymmet- ric synthesis, etc.2 Although MOFs are expected to be successful heterogeneous catalysts similar to zeolites,3,4 only handful two-dimensional (2D) phosphine materials have been reported so far.5 As a good example, James et al. reported that benzene-1,3,5-diphenylphosphine and Ag+ yield a 2D MOF with adjacent “chickenwire” layers directly on top of each other, to give 16 Å channels occupied by counteranions and solvent molecules.5c Several tris(4-carboxylphenyl)phosphine oxide- based 3D MOFs were reported by Humphrey and others,6 but phosphine-based 3D MOFs still remain unknown partly because the supramolecular coordination behavior of phos- phine complexes is less predictable. The pyramidal geometry at phosphorus and relatively free P−C rotation allow a range of accessible orientations of the lone pairs, and steric effects also need to be considered.1a In our efforts for phosphine-based self- assembly, we have developed an approach to synthesize 2D polymeric networks on the basis of rigid L2M2 dimeric secondary building blocks (L is a T-shaped pyridyl diphosphine).7 In this paper, novel 3D Cu(I) MOFs containing pyridyl diphosphine are generated, which represent the first examples of 3D phosphine-based MOFs, to the best of our knowledge. 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Design and Synthesis. 4-(3,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)- phenyl)pyridine (L) was chosen as a T-shaped pyridyl diphosphine because L2M2 dimerized subunits are apt to adopt a divergent conformation for further construction of polymeric structures.7 Such a divergent conformation efficiently restricts the accessible orientations of the phosphorus lone pairs so that the L2M2 subunits can be considered as a rigid 4- connecting node. Moreover, pyridylphosphines combine phosphorus and pyridyl nitrogen donors, possibly inducing electronic asymmetry on the metal.8 By slow diffusion of a solution of CuX (X = Br, Cl, or PF6) in MeCN into a solution of L in CHCl3 or toluene, three MOFs, {(LCuBr) ⊃xCHCl3}∞ (denoted CuL-Br to highlight the structural difference in counteranions), {(LCuCl) ⊃xCHCl3}∞(CuL-Cl) and Received: September 2, 2011 Revised: December 3, 2011 Published: December 13, 2011 Article pubs.acs.org/cm © 2011 American Chemical Society 480 dx.doi.org/10.1021/cm202608f | Chem. Mater. 2012, 24, 480−485 {(LCuPF6) ⊃xH2O}∞(CuL-PF6), were successfully synthe- sized. FT-IR spectra (4000−450 cm−1) were recorded to determine the coordination mode of the ligand, showing the characteristic CN stretching vibrations of the pyridyl groups at 1601 cm−1 for CuL-Br and CuL-Cl and 1609 cm−1 for CuL- PF6. In comparison to the vibration band of the free ligand (1592 cm−1), the blue-shifts (9−17 cm−1) are attributed to the coordination of the nitrogen atom from the pyridine ring to the metal center. The IR spectrum of CuL-PF6 shows the characteristic band of PF6 −at 841 cm−1. Crystal Structures. The crystal structures of CuL-Br and CuL-Cl could be unambiguously established by single crystal X- ray crystallography (Figure 1; Figure S1, Supporting Information). CuL-Br and CuL-Cl are isostructural with different counteranions, and only the former is discussed in detail hereinafter. CuL-Br crystallizes in the chiral space group P3221. The asymmetric unit consists of one crystallographically independent Cu(I) ion, one L ligand, and a Br−anion. Each L ligand binds three Cu+ ions with all three P and N donors, while each Cu+ is coordinated with three ligands to form a 3D network. The Cu+ ion is tetracoordinate with a distorted tetrahedral CuP2NBr coordination geometry. Every Cu+ ion coordinates one N donor and two P donors from three different ligands (Cu−P = 2.285(4), 2.270(3) Å; Cu−N = 2.065(9) Å). The charge of the network is balanced by one coordinated Br−ion per copper ion (Cu−Br = 2.422(3) Å). The net topological analysis of CuL-Br reveals a 3D 3- connected Archimedean 4.122 topological network if both Cu and the ligand are simplified as 3-connecting nodes. This simple topology represents a novel uniform 3-connected topology. The 4.122 net can be simplified to a chiral quartz net (or 64.82-qtz net) if each L2M2 subunits is considered as 4- connecting tetrahedral node. As predicted by Wells,9 replacement of the node of the NbO net by 4-gons gives a 4.122 net,10 while the present case reveals an unprecedented way to generate 4.122 net by replacing the node of the qtz net with 4-gons. Different from square-planar nodes in NbO-type net and the reported 4.82 networks,7 the dimeric Cu2L2 subunits of CuL-Br are twisted away from planarity and can be regarded as tetrahedral nodes (Figure 2). The Flack parameter with values close to zero implies high enantiopurity of CuL-Br in single crystals, and the network possesses an open structure with 1D homochiral channels along the c axis. All the chiral channels have the same handedness, with 32 helical symmetry, and are polygonal, measuring approximately 18.56 Å (a) in diameter. The open channels are lined with Br−ions and one of the PPh2 phenyl rings. The rest of open channels are filled with CHCl3 solvent molecules. CHCl3 resides in the 1D channels with the C−H group pointing to the X−ion via weak C−H···X interaction11 (C···Br 3.38−3.94 Å and ∠C−H···Br 154.5−168.9 for CuL-Br; C···Cl 3.43−3.68 and ∠C−H···Cl 155.8−167.8 for CuL-Cl). Calcu- lations using PLATON12 show that the solvent accessible volume of CuL-Br is 2385.8 Å3 per unit cell volume and the pore volume ratio is 37.6%. The crystallization of CuL-Br is expected to be racemic with equivalent enantiomeric crystals crystallized in P3221 and P3121.13 However, we failed to determine the other P3121 enantiomeric form despite numerous attempts.14 Single-crystal structural determination of CuL-Br and CuL- Cl and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) show that CuL-Br, CuL-Cl, and CuL-PF6 are isostructural (Figure 3a−d). The bulky purity of all the complexes was confirmed by PXRD analysis, and the results show that the experimental PXRD pattern for each complex is consistent with the simulated ones obtained from the single crystal structures of CuL-Br and CuL- Figure 1.

The resulting frameworks do not depend on the nature of the counteranion (strongly coordinating Br−, Cl−or weakly coordinating PF6 −). Br−or Cl−coordinates to the copper center, while PF6 −is expected to reside in the channels, with the tetrahedral geometry of copper(I) probably completed by solvated molecules, considering the structural feature. CuL-PF6 contains 1D channels where the weakly coordi- nated PF6 −anions are located, and an anion exchange study was performed and monitored using FT-IR and PXRD (Figure 4). After immersing CuL-PF6 in a toluene-MeCN (v/v = 1:1) solution of Bu4NBr or Bu4NCl, the FT-IR spectrum shows that the strong band of PF6 −anion at 840 cm−1 disappears and the resulting spectrum matches well that of CuL-Br or CuL-Cl, indicating the PF6 −anions located in the 1D channels were completely exchanged. The PXRD patterns of the exchanged solid are identical to CuL-Br or CuL-Cl, revealing that crystalline CuL-Br and CuL-Cl were obtained, respectively, without framework change. Thermostability. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that CuL-Br, CuL-Cl, and CuL-PF6 have similar weight loss processes (Figure 5). The guest molecules were released from room temperature (RT) to ca. 190 °C for CuL-Br and CuL-Cl, and from RT to ca. 230 °C for CuL-PF6. All the frameworks began to collapse from ca. 330 °C upon further heating. Removal of the guest molecules by treating CuL-PF6, CuL-Br, or CuL-Cl under vacuum at 50 °C causes a change on the framework, revealed by the PXRD patterns of the materials showing significant peak broadening (Figure 3e; Figures S2− S4, Supporting Information). However, the desolvated materials still possessed some degree of crystallinity, especially for CuL-PF6, suggesting only partial loss of long-range order. The crystalline solids can be fully regenerated upon exposure to CHCl3 or MeOH vapor/liquid, as indicated by the PXRD measurements (Figure 3f, g). The PXRD patterns are in good agreement with those of as-synthesized and simulated from single-crystal data. Therefore, the original crystal structure came back completely. No dissolution occurred in this process to rule out the possibility of recrystallization. Although the structures of guest-free solids were inaccessible, such guest-induced recovery may imply that the overall frameworks were kept intact. The partial loss of long-range order may result from unrestricted P−C rotation and framework distortion in the absence of guest. The recovery of CuL-Br and CuL-Cl may be partly driven by C−H···X (X = Br−, Cl−) weak host−guest interactions between guest and host framework, as revealed by structural analysis. Sorption Studies. To study the porosity of the materials, sorption isotherms have been measured (Figure 6; Figure S6, Supporting Information). Both MeOH and CHCl3 sorption studies of CuL-Br reveal gradual uptake with increasing pressure and final uptakes of 92 and 76 mL g−1 without saturation, corresponding to 2.7 and 2.2 molecules of MeOH and CHCl3 per copper, respectively. The amount of CHCl3 is consistent with the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (two CHCl3 molecules per copper). The desorption curves do not trace the adsorption branches and form hysteresis loops. In contrast, the MeOH profile of CuL-PF6 displays prominent stepwise adsorption and repeated hysteresis. It reveals a gradual uptake at the low P/P0 region and a steep uptake as the Figure 3.

Mater. 2012, 24, 480−485 482 pressure increases to 0.20 P/P0. The isotherm reaches saturation at 111 mL g−1, corresponding to 3.6 molecules of MeOH per copper and 15.9 wt % uptake by the framework. The sudden adsorption jump of CuL-PF6 in the isotherm may originate from the breathing effect of the framework with bigger PF6 −anions, disclosing anion-responsive dynamic behavior upon removal and readsorption of guests.15 Similar sorption properties have also been revealed by the CO2 profiles of CuL- Br and CuL-PF6 at 195 K. The CO2 isotherms of CuL-Br reveal a gradual uptake (final uptake 47 mL g−1) without apparent hysteresis, while those of CuL-PF6 show stepwise sorption (final uptake >103 mL g−1) with large hysteresis. In addition, both the MOFs favor CO2 over Ar in porous adsorption. The reasons may be that CO2 with a quadrupole moment of −1.4 × 10−39 C m2 interacts with the framework more effectively.16 Thus, the present MOFs have flexible porous behavior at low pressure, and the guest uptake is triggered by synergistic interactions of guest molecules and counteranions (PF6 −). As shown above, weak host−guest interactions between probe molecules and the host framework and relatively free P−C rotation may play key roles in the structural flexibility. Catalytic Properties. The framework materials are stable in usual solvents such as CHCl3, CH2Cl2, MeCN, toluene, water, and alcohols, as revealed by PXRD analyses (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The materials also have good stability in weak acidic/basic media. Thus, further evaluation of their catalytic performance as well as their adsorption for small molecules is possible. The catalytic activity of the phosphine- based MOFs in heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysis was measured by using a ketalization reaction as a model reaction.17 Guest-free CuL-Br and CuL-PF6 (dried in vacuum at 50 °C for 10 h) were used for catalysis. The crystallinity was examined after immersing the guest-free CuL-Br in the substrates (ethylene glycol and ketones) or the solvent (toluene) used, showing that the crystalline solids can be regenerated in toluene, 2-butanone, cyclohexanone, and a solution of benzophenone in toluene, and partly regenerated in acetophe- none (Figure 7). Both materials display heterogeneous catalytic activity in ketal formation with 0.2 mol % catalyst loading (Table 1; Figure S8, Supporting Information). CuL-PF6 shows signifi- cantly higher activity than CuL-Br, such as in transforming 2- butanone to 2-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane (93% vs 67%), indicating that the activity is anion responsive. Such a responsive behavior is probably because PF6 −is a weakly coordinating anion, so that the Cu(I) coordination sphere is easily accessible for the substrate. 2-Butanone, cyclohexanone, acetophenone, and benzophe- none were chosen as substrates with varied sizes and shapes to test the size selectivity of the MOFs. Compared with the activity in 2-butanone transformation, the conversions drop to 36 and 17% for the size enlarged substrates cyclohexanone and acetophenone, respectively, catalyzed by CuL-Br. A similar trend was also observed when catalyzed by CuL-PF6. When using bulky benzophenone as substrate, no conversion was detected when catalyzed by CuL-Br or CuL-PF6. Therefore, both materials reveal remarkable size dependence on the substrate. However, the reactivity may be affected by electronic effects as well, because the weak Cu(I) Lewis acidicity3a of the present MOFs is expected to boost the catalysis of electron-rich substrates (2-butanone and cyclohexanone) rather than more electron-deficient substrates (acetophenone and benzophe- none). Further control experiments were performed for a related 2D coordination network, 2D-Ag, based on AgOTf and 3-(3,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)phenyl)pyridine.7b The Ag(I) Lewis acidic center of 2D-Ag has a similar MP2N coordination environment. The activity of 2D-Ag is mainly affected by electronic effects, and the reactions of 2-butanone, cyclo- hexanone, acetophenone, and benzophenone yielded the corresponding products in 63%, 99%, 47%, and 16% yield, respectively (Table 1). Compared with 2D-Ag, the different reactivity pattern observed for CuL-Br and CuL-PF6 further confirms the size selective effect. The MOFs were readily isolated from the reaction mixture by simple filtration. 31P NMR spectroscopy shows that the supernatant was free from ligand contamination.3c The reaction Figure 6.

Mater. 2012, 24, 480−485 483 was apparently catalyzed heterogeneously, as evidenced by the conventional filtration test that no reaction took place after removal of the catalyst (Figure S9, Supporting Information). PXRD experiments were conducted to study the stability of the materials before and after ketalization (Figures S10 and S11, Supporting Information). The recovered catalysts had a powder XRD pattern similar to that of the guest free materials, while an identical diffraction pattern to the as-synthesized material was obtained after the recovered catalysts were immersed in toluene-MeCN for CuL-Br or CuL-PF6. The results suggest that the framework structure survived the reactions. The cycling results reveal that there was no obvious loss of catalytic activity for three successive runs.18 3. CONCLUSIONS In summary, three isostructural 3D phosphine-based MOFs have been successfully synthesized with Br−, Cl−, or PF6 −as counteranions on the basis of Cu2L2 dimeric subunits. These complexes have 3-connected networks with an unprecedented chiral 4.122 topology and can be further simplified as a 64.82-qtz net arising from the rigid Cu2L2 tetrahedral node. The complexes possess 1D chiral channels to show anion-tunable flexible sorption properties. Preliminary study indicates that the materials have size-selectivity for ketalization reaction. Future work will focus on synthesis of enantiopure 3D phosphine materials with larger porosity, on the basis of tailored achiral subunits and chiral reticular synthesis,1d,19 which may find potential application in asymmetric catalysis and separation. 4. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION All starting materials and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. 4-(3,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)phenyl)- pyridine (L) was prepared according to published procedures.7a The sorption isotherms were measured with a BELSORP-max automatic volumetric sorption apparatus. Before sorption measurement, the as-synthesized samples were dried at 50 °C under high vacuum for 10 h to remove the solvated molecules. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were measured on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA with a Cu target tube and a graphite monochromator. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed in nitrogen and under 1 atm at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 on a NETZSCH Thermo Microbalance TG 209 F3 Tarsus. Synthesis of CuL-Br. A mixture of CHCl3-MeCN (v/v = 1:1, 4 mL) was carefully layered over a solution of L (5.2 mg, 0.01 mmol) in CHCl3 (1 mL). Then, a solution of CuBr (1.4 mg, 0.01 mmol) in MeCN (2 mL) was layered over the mixture layer. The solution was left to stand at ∼40 °C, and pale yellow block crystals appeared after about 4 days (5.0 mg, 73%).

Single-Crystal Structure Analyses. Determination of the unit cell and X-ray crystallographic data collection were performed on an Oxford Gemini S Ultra diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromated Enhance (Cu) X-ray source (λ = 1.54178 Å) at 150(2) K. The structures were solved by direct (CuL-Br) or Patterson (CuL-Cl) methods, following different Fourier syntheses, and refined by the full- matrix least-squares method against F0 2, using SHELXTL software.20 Anisotropic thermal factors were assigned to the non-hydrogen atoms, except those showing severe disorder. Hydrogen atoms were introduced in calculated positions. For CuL-Br, two CHCl3 guests and one PPh group show crystallographically imposed disorder over two positions, and fractional occupancies, 0.45/0.25, 0.35/0.45, and 0.51/0.49, were assigned to the two positions, respectively, and restrained refinement was carried out. For CuL-Cl, restraints on anisotropic displacement parameters were applied to the disordered phenyl rings.

CCDC-824217. Catalytic Acetalization. Prior to catalysis, as-synthesized CuL-Br or CuL-PF6 was dried at 50 °C in vacuo for 10 h to remove the guest molecules. 7.5 mmol of ketone (2-butanone, cyclohexanone, acetophenone, or benzophenone), 7.5 mmol of ethylene glycol, and 0.015 mmol of catalyst were introduced into 9 mmol of toluene. The reaction mixture was refluxed under Dean−Stark conditions for 12 h. CDCl3 (2 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and the resulting suspension was centrifuged for 1H NMR study. The quantitative analysis of the products was determined by 1H NMR. For subsequent run, the catalyst was recovered by filtration, washed fully with toluene and Et2O in turn, immersed in toluene-MeCN for ca. 6 days, and degassed in vacuo at 50 °C for 10 h.

(14) In most of our efforts, we only obtained tiny crystals that were too small for single-crystal X-ray analysis; thus, we failed to determine the other P3121 enantiomeric form. For the same reason, only negative CD signals were detected for the batches examined when we investigated the chirality of bulk crystals by solid-state circular dichroism (CD) (Figure S5, Supporting Information). No CD signal was detected for the bulk sample. (15) (a) Maji, T. K.; Matsuda, R.; Kitagawa, S. Nat. Mater. 2007, 6, 142−148. (b) Wang, S.; Li, L.; Zhang, J.; Yuan, X.; Su, C.-Y. J. Mater.

(18) The catalysts were found to trap the product/substrate in the pore channels after catalysis, and thus, they needed to be reactivated to remove the absorbed chemicals. For subsequent use, the recovered catalyst was immersed in toluene-MeCN for ca. 6 days and dried in vacuum at 50 °C for 10 h. (19) (a) Morris, R. E.; Bu, X. Nat. Chem. 2010, 2, 353−361.

The results imply that both CuL-Br and CuL-PF6 do not adsorb N2 and Ar gases at 77 and 87 K, respectively, while uptake of CO2 was observed at 195 K. The CO2 isotherms of CuL-PF6 have abnormally higher desorption amounts than adsorption amounts, which may be explained by that the real equilibrium time needed for the sorption process is much longer than the experimental time scale (see D. Zhao, D. Yuan, R. Krishna, J. M. van Baten, H.-C. Zhou, Chem. Commun. 2010, 46, 7252-7354). The BET surface areas are 119 and 199 m2 g-1 for CuL-Br and CuL-PF6, respectively, estimated from the CO2 sorption isotherm. 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 d c b a 2θ (deg) Figure S7.
