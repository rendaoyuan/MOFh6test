China Received June 23, 2006 Reactions of [WES3]2- (E ) S, O) with CuX (X ) NCS, CN, I) in the presence of bix (bix ) 1,4-bis(imidazole- 1-ylmethyl)benzene) in DMF or CH3CN resulted in the formation of two novel 2D f3D interpenetrating coordination polymers [S2W2S6Cu4(bix)2]n (1) and {[WS4Cu4(NCS)2(bix)3]‚CH3CN}n (2), a noninterpenetrating 3D polymer {[WS4Cu2(bix)]‚DMF}n (3), and two 2D sheet polymers [WS4Cu3(CN)(bix)]n (4) and {[OWS3Cu3(bix)2][I]‚DMF‚ 2H2O}n (5), depending on the reaction temperature and the reagents used. Compound 1 contains a hexagonal prism of W2Cu4S6 cluster core, which serves as a 4-connecting node to link equivalent nodes via bix ligands, forming a 2D (4,4) net. In 2, a WCu4S4 core, which also acts as a 4-connecting node, connects the neighboring nodes either through single or double bix bridges, affording a different 2D (4,4) sheet. Inclined interpenetration occurs between two stacks of 2D sheets in the total structure of 1, while 2 involves a parallel interpenetration between the adjacent layers, both creating a 3D network. Compounds 1 and 2 represent the first examples of interpenetrating (4,4) frameworks with clusters as nodes and bidentate pyridyl-based ligands as linkers. Unlike 1 and 2, compound 3 has a noninterpenetrating 3D network, which is composed of the inorganic 1D (WS4Cu2)n chains linked by cis and trans bix ligands. Compound 4 features an inorganic 1D (WS4Cu3)n chain structure, which is linked by CN groups and bix ligands to form an infinite 2D network. Compound 5 is a 2D layer polymer with large inner cavities. Introduction The designed syntheses of new coordination polymers have attracted great attention in recent years because of not only their intriguing variety of architectures and topologies but also their potential applications in catalysis, ion exchange, nonlinear optics, and chemical absorption.1 This type of research began with the use of metal ions and organic bridging ligands to construct numerous one-, two-, and three- dimensional polymeric networks.2 Recently, there has been increasing interest in applications of metal clusters as fundamental building blocks and polydentate organic ligands as linkers to build polymeric arrays.3 For example, several multidimensional molecular tubes based on dimetal building units and the extended supramolecular arrays containing hexanuclear rhenium clusters have been reported.4 Such cluster-based coordination polymers are of particular interest because the clusters normally have larger size and multiple coordination sites which, when combined with suitable organic ligands, may lead to a variety of unusual shapes and novel properties. In effect, by careful choice of cluster subunits and linkers, polymeric frameworks with large voids * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In these compounds, the Mo(W)/Cu/S cluster subunits are normally connected by bridging ligands such as halide ions, cyanide, thiocyanate, and thiolates.8 Recently, pyridyl-based ligands, in particular 4,4′-bipyridine, have been used to construct Mo(W)/Cu/S polymeric frameworks such as {[NEt4][Mo2O2S6Cu6I3(4,4′-bipy)5]‚MeOH‚H2O}n and {[WS4- Cu4(4,4′-bipy)4][WS4Cu4I4(4,4′-bipy)2]‚4H2O}n.9 The former compound is a 2D polymer with incomplete cubanes {OMoS3Cu3I} as subunits and 4,4′-bipy as linkers while the latter is a 3D polymer containing interpenetrating diamondoid cationic clusters [WS4Cu4(4,4′-bipy)4]2+ and anionic clusters [WS4Cu4I4(4,4′-bipy)2]2-. In contrast to the rigid 4,4′-bipy, the bix (bix ) 1,4-bis(imidazole-1-ylmethyl)benzene) ligand has been proven to be more flexible and is able to connect various metal ions forming multidimensional infinite net- works.10 However, examples of cluster-based polymers with bix ligands have not been seen in the literature. In this paper, we report the synthesis and crystal structures of novel cluster- based polymers [S2W2S6Cu4(bix)2]n (1), {[WS4Cu4(NCS)2- (bix)3]‚CH3CN}n (2), {[WS4Cu2(bix)]‚DMF}n (3), [WS4Cu3- (CN)(bix)]n (4), and {[OWS3Cu3(bix)2][I]‚DMF‚2H2O}n (5), in which the bix ligands serve as linkers to connect W/Cu/S cluster subunits giving rise to 2D sheet structures and interpenetrating or noninterpenetrating 3D networks. Experimental Section Material and Methods. All operations were carried out in a vacuum, and the reactants were sealed with solvents in glass tubes (15 × 0.8 cm). The starting materials [X]2[WES3] (X ) NH4, Et4N; E ) O, S) and [Et4N]3[Cu4(NCS)5WS4] and the bix ligand were prepared according to literature procedures.10a,11,12 Other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used as received. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Magna 750 FT-IR spectrophotometer as KBr pellets. UV-vis diffuse reflectance measurements were made at room temperature in the 330-1100 nm range with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-35 UV/vis spectrophotom- eter. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by BDX300 X-ray diffraction with Cu KR radiation (λ ) 0.154 nm). Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C unit at a heating rate of 15 °C min-1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Crystal Structure Analyses. The intensity data sets for com- pounds 1-5 were collected on a Rigaku Mercury CCD diffrac- tometer with graphite-monochromated Mo KR radiation (λ ) 0.710 73 Å) at 293 K (173 K for 2).13 The structures were solved by direct methods with the SHELXS-97 program,14 and heavy atoms were located from E-maps. Other non-hydrogen atoms were derived from successive difference Fourier syntheses. The structures were refined on F2 by full-matrix least squares using SHELXL-9715 with anisotropical thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms except those of the disordered imidazole ring. The positions of H atoms were generated geometrically (C-H bond fixed at 0.96 Å), assigned isotropic thermal parameters, and allowed to ride on their parent carbon atoms before the final cycle of refinement. One of the imidazole rings in 2 is disordered over two sets of positions and was refined with restraints. The CN group of CH3CN molecule in 2 was disordered and also refined with restraints. Crystallographic data are presented in Table 1. [S2W2S6Cu4(bix)2]n (1). A mixture of CuNCS (0.33 mmol, 40.14 mg) and [NH4]2[WS4] (0.11 mmol, 38.30 mg) was stirred with 2 mL of DMF for 3 h.

Reactions of [WES3]2- (E ) S, O) with CuX (X ) NCS, CN, I) and bix by the solvothermal method resulted in the formation of compounds 1-5, depending on the reaction temperature, copper sources, and the solvents (DMF or CH3CN) used (Scheme 1). Treatment of a mixture of [NH4]2WS4 and 3 or 2 equiv of CuNCS in DMF with bix at 120 or 90 °C led to the formation of an interpenetrating 3D polymer 1 or a noninterpenetrating 3D polymer 3. The IR spectra of 1 and 3 displayed no absorptions due to NCS groups, suggesting that they were replaced by bix ligands during the reactions. Although compounds 1 and 3 have similar compositions, they have different structural types of the cluster building blocks. Compound 1 contains a closed structure of W2S6Cu6 hexagonal prism as a fundamental building block while 3 features a novel inorganic (WS4Cu2)n chain structure. When using CuI as the copper salt, the reaction with [WOS3]2- and bix and a small amount of CH2I2 in DMF at 90 °C yielded product 5. It is noticed that, in acetonitrile solution, CuNCS can readily react with [WS4]2- to form cluster units [WS4(CuNCS)4] and [WS4(CuNCS)3], where [WS4]2- act as tetradentate ligands to combine with Cu atoms and give a WS4Cu4 or WS4Cu3 “open structure”.12 It is therefore possible to obtain polymers with WS4Cu4 or WS4Cu3 as basic building blocks in similar reactions with those for 1 and 3 by using acetonitrile as solvent instead of DMF. The reaction of [Et4N]2[WS4] and bix with CuNCS or CuCN in CH3CN gave completely different types of coordination polymers, namely compounds 2 and 4, respectively. The IR spectra of 2 and 4 showed the presence of NCS, CN, and bix ligands, indicating that the NCS and CN groups were partially replaced by bix ligands. The molecular structure of 2 indeed consists of a WS4Cu4 cluster core as that observed in [WS4(CuNCS)4], while 4 contains a rare inorganic (WS4Cu3)n chain structure. Table 1.

Multidimensional Coordination Polymers Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 45, No. 25, 2006 10157 Compound 2 can also be prepared in a more reasonable way by the ligand substitution reaction of [Et4N]3[Cu4(NCS)5- WS4]12 with bix in acetonitrile at 120 °C. Although the solvothermal method has been widely used in the syntheses of organic-inorganic hybrids to obtain new compounds with novel structures, it has scarcely been used in the preparation of W/Cu/S clusters. In fact, the crystals of compounds 1-5 cannot be obtained if the reactions are carried out at room temperature. Besides, the presence of CH2I2 is crucial to the preparation of 5. In the absence of CH2I2, no desirable crystals were obtained. Crystal Structure of 1. The crystal structure of 1 reveals a distorted hexagonal prism of W2S6Cu4 that contains a center of symmetry (Figure 1a). The tungsten and sulfur atoms occupy alternate vertexes of the cage. One additional sulfur atom is externally bonded to each tungsten as was inferred from spectroscopic data. The structure of the cage can be regarded in terms of two incomplete cubanelike WS3Cu3 units fused together in a way that the sulfide ions from one unit serve as ligands for the Cu atoms in the other. The bond lengths and angles within the cage are unremarkably close to those reported for similar W/Cu/S clusters. However, the cage appears more compact than that of other most related clusters which also contain a similar prismatic W2S6Cu4 unit. For example, the mean distances of W-Cu and Cu‚‚‚Cu in 1 are 2.702 and 2.735 Å, respectively, which are shorter than those of [W2Cu4S6(PPh3)4O2] (2.780 and 2.867 Å) and {W2Cu4S6[(C7H7)3P]4O2} (2.784 and 2.801 Å).16 Bix groups are attached to each copper atom, forming an extended 2D sheet with (4,4) grid topology. The macrocyclic ring {(S2W2S6Cu4)4(bix)4} can be viewed as the basic building blocks of the structure, in which the apexes are occupied by the S2W2S6Cu4 clusters and the sides by the bix ligands. The grid motif has the dimensions of 17.55 × 17.92 Å (based on the centers of the cage clusters), the diagonals are 21.49 × 28.22 Å, and the interior angles are 74.57 and 105.43°, respectively. Because of the length and flexibility of the bix ligand, the (4,4) networks do not lie in the same plane but represent a chair conformation. In the polymeric structure of 1, each (4,4) net has an infinite number of identical sheets passing through it, inclined at ca. 38°. Two rods from an inclined sheet pass through every window of the other sheet in a parallel-parallel fashion, producing an interlocked 3D structure (Figure 1b). Thus, the large cavities formed by one stack of parallel nets are blocked due to the interpenetration with the other stack of nets. It should be noted that 1 is the first example of a hexagonal prism cluster being incorporated into an interpenetrating 3D network, though similar cage clusters of [Cu6X6] (X ) Cl, Br and I) with a tripyridine ligand have recently been reported. The latter complexes are noninterpenetrating 2D-sheet polymers.17 Crystal Structure of 2. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the fundamental building block of 2 is a pentanuclear cluster WS4Cu4(NCS)2 rather than a hexa- nuclear cluster as in 1 (Figure 2a). In the WS4Cu4(NCS)2 cluster unit, both W and Cu atoms are tetrahedrally coordi- nated. There are two types of Cu atoms; one is coordinated by two bix ligands, and the other is coordinated by a bix and a NCS group. The structural parameters of the WS4Cu4- (16) (a) Mu¨ller, A.; Bo¨gge, H.; Hwang, T. K. Inorg. Chim. Acta 1980, 39, 71. (b) Doherty, R.; Hubbard, C. R.; Mighell, A. D.; Siedle, A. R.; Stewart, J.

Song et al. 10158 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 45, No. 25, 2006 (NCS)2 fragment are typical, and those for the thiocyanate groups are within the range usually reported for the N-bonded terminal NCS groups.12,18 From a topological perspective, each cluster serves as a 4-connecting node in an infinite 2D sheet. The bix ligands link the WS4Cu4(NCS)2 units in a trans arrangement resulting in a strongly distorted rectangular macrocyclic ring {[WS4Cu4(NCS)2]4(bix)6}. The size of each ring is ca. 17.50 × 15.02 Å (based on the connections between cluster centers) with the long edge being a pair of bix ligands and the short edge being a single bix unit. Due to the tetrahedral geometry at the W centers and a significant bending of the bix ligands, the rectangular ring in 2 is also nonplanar. The adjacent rings share edges and vertexes to form highly undulating (4,4) 2D layers parallel to the crystallographic bc plane. There are two sets of parallel noncatenated “wavy” layers which are displaced in such a way to give a 3D polycatenated array, with each layer catenated by two others (“above” and “below”) (Figure 2b). This parallel interpenetration causes blocking of the cavities, leaving room only for small CH3CN solvent molecules. Crystal Structure of 3. The structure of 3 features a 3D framework constructed from the 1D inorganic (WS4Cu2)n chains linked by bix ligands (Figure 3a, top). In 3, the bix ligands display two kinds of molecular configuration (cis and trans) on the basis of the two amidazole groups in the relative orientation respected to the benzene plane. Interest- ingly, each inorganic (WS4Cu2)n chain is constructed from WS4Cu3 cluster units by sharing two bridging Cu atoms (Cu2 and Cu2A) each of which is coordinated by four sulfur atoms from two neighboring WS4 subunits in chain. The remaining Cu atom (Cu1) has a tetrahedral coordination geometry with two sulfur atoms from WS4 and two N atoms from the cis and trans bix ligands, respectively. Each cis bix ligand connects two Cu1 atoms from the adjacent (WS4Cu2)n chains forming a undulated bricklike layer (Figure 3b). Furthermore, the trans bix ligands align in a tilted fashion between the adjacent bricklike layers and bridge Cu1 atoms from two layers, forming a noninterpenetrating 3D architecture. As shown in Figure 3c, the 3D architecture of 3 possesses approximately hexagonal channels along the [101] direction with an effective size of ca. 13 × 7 Å2. In 3, the DMF molecules are located in the channels and there are a number of C-H‚‚‚O hydrogen bonds present between the DMF molecules and the bix ligands (Figure S2). Presumably, these weak intermolecular interactions contribute to the stabiliza- tion of the noninterpenetrating 3D structure of 3. Removing the DMF molecules from 3 in a vacuum at ca. 120 °C causes a significant phase change and produces compound 1, which was confirmed by the XRD (Figures S3 and S4), IR, and element analysis. These observations indicated that the solvated DMF molecules might play an important rule in the stabilization of 3 and prevent the polymeric framework of 3 from forming interpenetration. Crystal Structure of 4. The asymmetric unit of the crystal structure of 4 contains a WS4Cu3 unit, a cyanide ligand, and bix ligand (Figure 4a). As illustrated in Figure 4b, compound 4 consists of a 2D polymeric sheet formed by linking inorganic (WS4Cu3)n chains via cyanide bridges and bix ligands. Each (WS4Cu3)n chain is constructed from WS4Cu4 cluster units by sharing two bridging Cu atoms. This structural type is unique for the W/Cu/S compounds but similar to that found in [WAgS4NH4‚NH3C(CH2OH)3‚ 2DMF]n and [W4Ag4S16‚2Ca(DMSO)6]n, where the poly- meric chains are formed through the connection of adjacent, nearly perpendicular [-WS2Ag-] rhomboidal fragments.19 The Cu atoms in 4 which connect two neighboring WS42- anions are tetrahedrally coordinated with four S atoms, while the other Cu atoms also exhibit tetrahedral geometry through coordination to two sulfur atoms, a single bridging cyanide, and a N donor from bix ligand. The Cu-(µ-CN)-Cu portion in 4 is slightly bent, with Cu(1)-C(15)-N(3) and C(15)- N(3)-Cu(2)* angles of 177.5(9) and 172.0(8)°, respectively. The mean W‚‚‚Cu distance of 2.737 Å is longer than that found in four-coordinate Cu clusters such as [Et4N]2[WS4Cu4- (NCS)4] (2.691 Å)12 but shorter than that of [WS4Cu4(dppm)4]- (18) Beheshti, A.; Clegg, W.; Fallah, H.

Multidimensional Coordination Polymers Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 45, No. 25, 2006 10159 (PF6)2 (2.760 Å).20 While the cyanide groups serve as bridges between two neighboring (WS4Cu3)n chains, the bix ligands, which are in a trans conformation, cross-link two (WS4Cu3)n chains. The interchain W‚‚‚W distance within a layer is ca. 9.5 Å. Compounds 4 and 3 are notable as two-dimensional and three-dimensional polymers composed of rare inorganic (WS4Cu3)n or (WS4Cu2)n chains supported by cyanide and/ or bix ligands, respectively. Such structures are unprec- edented in Mo(W)/Cu/S coordination polymer system. Crystal Structure of 5. The basic building block of the polymer 5 is an incomplete cubanelike cluster cation [OWS3Cu3]+ which is composed of one W atom, one terminal O atom, three Cu atoms, and three µ3-S atoms. The Cu centers have different coordination environments. Each of the atoms Cu2 and Cu3 is surrounded by one N atom from bix and two µ3-S atoms in a distorted trigonal environment while Cu1 is tetrahedrally bound by two N atoms from bix and two µ3-S atoms. The bix ligands bridge between Cu atoms of adjacent [OWS3Cu3]+ cores in a trans conformation forming a large rhombic grid with side lengths 12.62 × 18.07 Å and diagonal distances 12.66 × 28.36 Å on the basis of the cluster-cluster interval (Figure 5). These (4,4) grids are further extended into a 2D wavelike layer by sharing [OWS3Cu3]+ joints and bix edges. In contrast to 1 and 2, the 2D coordination networks of 5 do not inter- penetrate each other, which is rare in such large macro- metallacycle frameworks. Packing views of the complex 5 are shown in Figure 6. The grid layers are closely stacked with strong interlayer π-π interactions between parallel aromatic imidazole rings of the bix of nearest neighboring layers (the offset face to face separation is ca. 3.20 Å; the centroid-centroid distance is ca. 3.59 Å). Further inspection of the structure reveals that there exist very large inner cavities (ca. 16.8 × 22.3 Å) along the crystallographic a direction, which are filled with DMF and water molecules as well as noncoordinating I- counteranions. These dimen- sions are close to those reported in a 2D network complex with {OMoS3Cu3I} cluster cores and 4,4′-bipy bridges.9b Infrared Spectra and Optical Absorption Spectra. The infrared spectra for compounds 1-5 are similar, showing characteristic bands for bix in the 1638-656 cm-1 range. In addition, bands were observed in the spectra of 2 and 4 at 2086 and 2130 cm-1, respectively, assigned to νCtN from NCS and CN groups. The W-Sbr stretching vibrations for compounds 1-5 were observed at 436 (1), 430 (2), 439 (3), 437 (4), and 431 (5) cm-1, respectively. Different from those of compounds 2-4, the spectrum of 1 showed an additional νWdS stretching vibration at 498 cm-1 while that of 5 displayed a νWdO band at 924 cm-1. Optical absorption spectra of compounds 1-5 (Figure 7) have been measured by diffuse-reflectance experiments. The UV-vis absorption data were calculated from the reflectance data using the Kubelka-Munk function:21 R/S ) (1 - R)2/ 2R, where R is the experimentally observed reflectance, R the absorption coefficient, and S the scattering coefficient. By the use of straightforward extrapolation method, the band gaps for 1-5 are about 1.98, 2.09, 2.10, 2.11, and 2.25 eV, respectively.22 These results show that the present compounds may be classed as semiconductors. Thermogravimetric Analysis. The TGA curves for compounds 1-5 are shown in Figure S1. Compounds 1 and 4 are stable up to 313 and 305 °C, respectively, from which they begin to dramatically lose their organic components. For 2, the weight loss (ca. 2%) before 316 °C could be assigned to the escape of CH3CN molecules which is a little smaller than the expected value (2.85%) probably due to the efflorescence of solvent molecules. The second step of weight loss begins at 316 °C, from which the organic components were burnt. In the TGA curve of 3, the initial weight loss between 165 and 174 °C corresponds to the release of DMF (20) Lang, J. P.; Tatsumi, K. Inorg. Chem. 1998, 37, 6308. (21) (a) Kotu¨m, G.

Song et al. 10160 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 45, No. 25, 2006 molecules (observed, 10%; calculated, 9.7%). The second step of weight loss, occurring between 316 and 374 °C is due to the decomposition of organic components. The weight loss of 5 in the range 114-180 °C could be assigned to the escape of H2O and DMF molecules. The observed weight loss of ca. 8.8% is close to the theoretical value (9.1%). The second step of weight loss begins at 299 °C, from which the organic groups were burnt. Conclusion In summary, we have demonstrated herein a facile synthesis of several coordination polymers of W/Cu/S clusters containing inclined (4,4) or parallel (4,4) interpen- etrating and noninterpenetrating multidimensional frame- works. Although the (4,4) grid network is one of the most frequently encountered types of coordination polymers with ditopic spacers, the connecting nodes are usually single metal ions rather than cluster compounds.23 Multidimensional networks with clusters behaving as shared corners and bidentate bix ligands as spacers have not previously been reported. Under similar reaction conditions, the employment of different solvents or copper sources resulted in different structures for the copper thiotungstate cluster building blocks as well as differences in the networks’ interpenetration modes. By the choice of appropriate cluster components and connecting elements, other metal-sulfur cluster supported supramolecules with interesting topologic structures and molecular architectures can be obtained.
