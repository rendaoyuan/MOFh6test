KEYWORDS metal-organic frameworks; aluminium carboxylates; porous materials; nonlinear optical properties; isoreticular chemistry Supporting Information Placeholder ABSTRACT: Employing high-throughput methods, the synthesis conditions for a series of six new MOFs based on aluminium ions and the V-shaped linker molecule 1,3-benzene dicarboxylic acid, denoted as CAU-10-X (CAU = Christian-Albrechts-University) with the sum formula [Al(OH)(C8H3O4X)]·solvent, were established (X = functional group in 5-position of the aromatic ring; X = H (1), CH3 (2), OCH3 (3) NO2 (4), NH2 (5), or OH (6)). Due to the absence of macroscopic crystals, the obtained compounds were structurally characterized employing XRPD-methods. The crystal structures of 1, 2 and 3 were refined using Rietveld methods. Although the described MOFs are isoreticular, they crystallize in several, sometimes non-centrosymmetric space groups (1, 4, 6), due to slight structural changes induced by the functionalization. These space groups were confirmed with second-harmonic gener- ation measurements. All compounds are highly stable as confirmed by temperature-dependent XRPD- and IR-experiments and de- compose at temperatures above 350 °C. The stabilities of all compounds in aqueous solutions of varying pH were confirmed by XRPD-measurements and their sorption properties towards nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor at low pressures are reported. A drastic influence of the functional group on affinity, capacity and accessibility of the pores for these gases is ob- served. These properties depend on the polarity and size of the functional group as well as on subtle structural differences between the CAU-10-X compounds. Introduction Metal-organic frameworks are often objected to as potential materials for a variety of applications like gas storage, sepa- ration processes, as sensor materials or in pharmaceutical applications.[1,2,3,4] Their main advantage is the modular building principle rooted in the assembly of separate organic and inorganic building units. This allows in theory the facile tuning of their properties, either by the chemical functionali- zation of the organic building units or by replacement of the inorganic units. This approach is known as isoreticular chemistry, which is supposed to result in “tailored” proper- ties, suitable to the application of interest.[5] This principle has shown to be valuable for a small number of compounds, while the majority of structures remains unique. Prominent examples of the successful isoreticular synthesis are most often based on linear aromatic dicarboxylate ions, which are varied in size and by additional functional groups.[6,7] This is most probably due to the commercial availability of a rather large number of linker molecules exhibiting this linear ge- ometry. As an example, a large number of compounds based on the MIL-53-topology are known and well characterized (MIL stands for Matériaux d’Institute Lavoisier). The inor- ganic unit in this type of framework is a chain of trans- connected M(III)O6-polyhedra, which are connected by line- ar dicarboxylate ions.[8] The size of these dicarboxylate ions can be varied in a wide range, thus the smallest linker incor- porated until now is the fumarate ion (trans-1,2- ethylenedicarboxylate).[9] The largest molecule used for the synthesis of the MIL-53-topology is the 4,4’- biphenyldicarboxylic acid.[10] Furthermore, a manifold of compounds based on functionalized 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid can be synthesized.[11,12] The diversity of this topology is increased due to the large number of cations that can act as inorganic unit, like Al3+[8], Sc3+[13], Fe3+[14], Cr3+[15], In3+16 or Ga3+[17]. Among these compounds, especially the MOFs based on aluminium and chromium have shown to be chemi- cally and thermally stable.[1819] Moreover, the low price and the low toxicity of aluminium salts have resulted in a pro- found interest of industrial research groups in these materi- als.[9] These are the reasons for our interest in the synthesis of new MOFs based on aluminium. While a large number of compounds based on the MIL-53-topology can be readily synthesized, there is no example for MOFs based on alumin- ium and the V-shaped 1,3-benzene dicarboxylic acid (iso- phtalic acid or 1,3-H2BDC). To the best of our knowledge there is no example at all for a porous compound based on this linker molecule and one of the mentioned trivalent cati- ons, although the isophthalic acid is non-toxic and available at low cost. This is very surprising since a variety of modi- Page 1 of 13 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Chemistry of Materials 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 2 fied isophthalic acids are commercially available, which in principle eases the synthesis of isoreticular MOFs. Therefore, we started a systematic investigation of the sol- vothermal system Al3+ / isophthalic acid / solvent. For this investigation, we took also the requirements of industrial research into account, i.e. the preferable use of Al2(SO4)3·18H2O, a low amount of organic solvents and rather mild synthesis conditions.[9] By applying high- throughput (HT-) methods,[20,21] we discovered a new porous aluminum isophthalate, denoted as CAU-10-H with the sum formula [Al(OH)(1,3-BDC)]. Using the reaction conditions for the synthesis of CAU-10-H as a starting point, the HT- methods were further employed to optimize the synthesis conditions for five other members of this series bearing NO2- , NH2-, CH3-, OCH3- or OH-groups. For a detailed character- ization of all members of the CAU-10-series sorption exper- iments were carried out with N2 and H2 at 77 K and with CO2 and H2O at 298 K. In addition, thermogravimetric ex- periments as well as temperature dependent XRPD- and IR- measurements were performed and stability tests in a wide pH-range were carried out. To identify structural transitions and to confirm the chirality and polarity of some of these MOFs, the CAU-10-series was further characterized by means of SHG-measurements. Experimental Section Materials and Methods. All chemicals are commercially available and were employed without further purification. A detailed description of our HT-methods is given elsewhere. [22] The HT-studies for the discovery and optimisation of CAU-10-H are described in the supporting information. For the upscaled reactions, custom made teflon-reactors in steel autoclaves with a volume of 37 mL or glass reactors for sol- vothermal conditions with a volume of 100 mL were em- ployed. The initial characterization by means of XRPD- methods was carried out on a STOE-Stadi-P diffracometer (Cu Kα1-radiation) equipped with a xy-stage and an image- plate-detector. The data for the structure solution and re- finement was collected on a STOE-Stadi-P diffractometer (Cu Kα1-radiation) equipped with a PSD-detector. The syn- chrotron-XRPD data for the refinement of CAU-10-H was measured at the beamline P8 of the PETRA-accelerator ring at the DESY in Hamburg. The wavelength was set to 0.495 Å and the pattern was recorded on a 2D-CCD-detector. The raw data was converted with the fit2D-program.[23] The suit- ability of this setup was confirmed by the successful refine- ment of the NIST-standard CeO2 and the Al-based MOF CAU-1-NH2.24 Temperature dependent XRPD-data was measured in capillaries on a STOE-Stadi-P diffractometer equipped with an image plate detector using Cu Kα1- radiation. The software used for the structure determination was Expo2009,[25] the refinements were performed with TOPAS.[26] The software used for force-field-calculations, to complete structural fragments and to optimize some of the structures by forcefield-calculations was Materials Studio 5.0.[27] IR-spectra measured ambient conditions were meas- ured with a Bruker ALPHA-FT-IR A220/D-01 spectrometer equipped with an ATR-unit. The Raman-spectra were meas- ured with a Bruker IFS 66 FRA 106 spectrometer in the range of 0-3300 cm-1 using a Nd/YAG-Laser (1064 nm). NMR-spectra in solution were measured on a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer. Solid-state CP-MAS-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DSX Avance 400 FT NMR spectrome- ter in a 7 mm ZrO2-rotor at a rotation frequency of 5 kHz. Thermogravimetric measurements were performed on a NETZSCH STA 409 CD analyzer under a flow of air with a heating rate of 4 K/min in Al2O3-crucibles. The data was corrected for buoyancy and current effects. EDX- measurements were performed with a Phillips ESEM XL-30. SEM-micrographs were recorded with a Zeiss Gemini Ultra Plus. Sorption experiments were carried out with a BEL JAPAN INC. Belsorpmax. Temperature dependent IR-spectra were recorded with a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector and working with the spec- tral resolution of 2 cm-1. All presented spectra, except the ones at RT, were measured at 50 °C. For the IR experiment a silicon wafer was covered by a thin layer of the material by evaporating on its surface a few drops of the corresponding dispersion in methanol. In the SHG microscope the sample is illuminated wide-field under normal incidence with femtosecond pulsed infrared (IR) laser light at 800 nm (Spectra Physics, Tsunami ®). The polarization of the incident IR light is varied by a zero-order half-wave plate for 800 nm. The sample is irradiated by a long focal length lens (f=7.5 cm), so that the incident fun- damental light can be considered in good approximation as a collimated beam, and electric field components along the propagation direction (Z) can be neglected. Behind the sam- ple, a high-power objective (Thorlabs, LMU-15X-NUV) collimates the transmitted light. An interference filter (Melles-Griot, FWHM) centered at 400 nm selectively transmits the second-harmonic light. A Glan-Taylor polarizer can be inserted as analyzer. Finally, an EM-CCD camera (C9100, Hamamatsu) collects the transmitted light. Synthesis. CAU-10-H (1) was synthesized from a mixture of 200 mg 1,3-H2BDC (1.20 mmol), 800 mg of Al2(SO4)3·18H2O (1.20 mmol), 1 mL N,N-dimethylformamid (DMF) and 4 mL H2O. The reactants were dosed into a tef- lon-lined steel-autoclave with a volume of 37 mL and placed in an oven for 12 h at 135 °C. After cooling to room temper- ature, the product was filtered off and the obtained solid was redispersed in water by sonication and stirring, until a ho- mogenous mixture was obtained. The dispersion was filtered again and the white microcrystalline solid was dried in air. Elemental analysis: C 40.2 %, H 4.6 %. Calculated values based on the deduced sum formula [Al(OH)(O2C-C6H4- CO2)]·1.7 H2O: C 40.2 %, H 3.1 %. This synthesis procedure is also applicable in larger teflon reactors with a comparably low filling degree (15 to 20 %), while in glass reactors the formation of an unknown crystalline byproduct was ob- served. The methylated MOF CAU-10-CH3 (2) was synthesized in a 100 mL glass reactor with screw cap. Therefore 0.80 g (4.44 mmol) 5-methylisophthalic acid, 2.96 g Al2(SO4)3·18H2O (4.44 mmol), 4 mL DMF and 16 mL H2O were mixed thor- oughly and heated for 12 h to 130 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the filtered product was redispersed in ~ 200 mL water by sonication and stirring. Afterwards, the mixture was filtered again and the pale yellow solid was dried under Page 2 of 13 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Chemistry of Materials 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 3 ambient conditions. Elemental analysis: C 46.1%, H 4.1 %, N 1.4 %. Calculated values based on the deduced sum for- mula [Al(OH)(O2C-C6H4OCH3-CO2)]·0.73 H2O· 0.25 DMF: C 46.1 %, H 4.1, N 1.4 %. The synthesis in teflon-lined au- toclaves results in the formation of the same reaction prod- uct, but DMF-molecules are occluded inside the pores of this product, which could not be removed by heating or evacua- tion. The OCH3-functionalized MOF CAU-10-OCH3 (3) was also synthesized in a 100 mL glass reactor with screw cap. 1.20 g (6.12 mmol) 5-methoxyisophthalic acid, 2.04 g Al2(SO4)3·18H2O (4.44 mmol), 3 mL DMF and 12 mL H2O were mixed thoroughly and heated for 12 h at 130 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the white microcrystalline product was processed in the same way as CAU-10-CH3. Elemental analysis: C 44.9 %, H 3.6 %, N 1.2 %. Calculated values based on the deduced sum formula [Al(OH)(O2C- C6H4OCH3-CO2)]·1.3 H2O ·0.24 DMF: C 42.9 %, H 4.1, N 1.2 %. For the other three compounds, we had to develop a different synthesis route, since the stronger polarity of the NO2-, the NH2- and the OH-group led to the occlusion of sulfate ions inside the channels of the MOF, as measured by EDX- analysis. The NO2-functionalized CAU-10-NO2 (4) was synthesized using a 2 M solution of AlCl3·6H2O in water as the Al3+- source. Thus, 1440 mg (6.82 mmol) 5-nitroisophthalic acid, 3.4 mL Al3+-solution (6.80 mmol), 4 mL DMF and 12.6 mL H2O were filled into a 100 mL glass reactor with screw cap. The mixture was heated at 120 °C for 12 h, and the product was worked up in the same way as the other compounds. Elemental analysis: C 38.1 %, H 2.5 %, N 6.8 %. Calculated values based on the deduced sum formula [Al(OH)(O2C- C6H4NO2-CO2)]·0.41 DMF: C 39.1 %, H 2.4, N 7.0 %. The NH2-functionalized CAU-10-NH2 (5) was synthesized by dosing 1200 mg (6.63 mmol) 5-aminoisophthalic acid, 3.3 mL Al3+-solution (6.6 mmol), 4 mL DMF and 12.7 mL H2O into a 100 mL glass reactor with screw cap. The mixture was heated at 120 °C for 12 h, and the resulting pale pink solid was filtered off. The reaction product was redipersed in water by sonication for 30 minutes, filtered off again and dried for one hour at 200 °C in air. Elemental analysis: C 42.8 %, H 2.9 %, N 6.4 %. Calculated values based on the deduced sum formula [Al(OH)(O2C-C6H4NH2-CO2)]: C 42.8 %, H 2.9, N 6.4 %. Although the analysis matches the chem- ical formula, NMR-experiments indicate that the NH2-group is partially formylated during the synthesis (see SI, paragraph XI). The OH-functionalized CAU-10-OH (6) was synthesized by dosing 1000 mg (5.49 mmol) 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid, 2.8 mL Al3+-solution (5.6 mmol), 4 mL DMF and 13.2 mL H2O into a 100 mL glass reactor with screw cap. The mixture was heated at 120 °C for 12 h, and the resulting white solid was filtered off. The reaction product was redipersed in water by sonication for 30 minutes, filtered off again and dried for one hour at 200 °C in air. Elemental analysis: C 41.3 %, H 4.5 %. Calculated values based on the deduced sum formula [Al(OH)(O2C-C6H4OH-CO2)]·0.5 H2O: C 41.2 %, H 2.6. The compounds contain no residual chloride or sulfate ions, according to the EDX analysis. The yield is in all cases be- tween 60 % and 70 % based on the amount of linker. Tem- perature-dependent IR-spectra and Raman-spectra measured under ambient conditions of all compounds can be found in the supporting information (Fig S23-S34). Structure determination and refinement of 1, 2 and 3. All compounds were obtained as microcrystalline powders, therefore the structures had to be determined from powder diffraction data. Indexing of the powder pattern of CAU-10-H (1) suggested a tetragonal cell with the space group I41. Based on this cell, the structure was solved from in-house XRPD-data by direct methods using the program Expo2009 [25]. The inorganic building units were unambiguously located while the organic parts of the framework were inserted as recently de- scribed.[28] Utilizing the program Materials Studio[27] the aromatic moieties were introduced at the appropriate posi- tions and the structure was optimized by force-field calcula- tions keeping the positions of the inorganic units fixed. Em- ploying this model as a starting structure, the crystal struc- ture was successfully confirmed by Rietveld-methods using synchrotron XRPD data (Fig. 1). For the measurement at the synchrotron, the sample was heated to 180°C to remove ad- sorbed solvent molecules and filled into a 0.7 mm capillary which was immediately sealed. This procedure was neces- sary since the occluded solvent molecules had a strong influ- ence on the observed intensities. Some parameters of this refinement are summarized in Tab.1. Further details are summarized in the supporting information. 5 10 15 20 25 30 10 15 20 25 30 intensity / a. u. 2Θ / ° measured fit difference 2Θ / ° Figure 1: Rietveld plot for the refinement of activated CAU-10- H (λ = 0.495 Å).

For CAU-10-CH3 (2), a symmetry transition was observed upon removal of the occluded solvent molecules. The com- pound crystallizes in a tetragonal cell with extinction condi- tions matching the chiral space group P41 in its as(as synthe- sized)-form (Fig. S4). The chirality was confirmed by se- cond-harmonic generation measurements (vide infra). Heat- ing of 2-as at 200 °C for one hour in air resulted in small changes in the unit cell parameters. However, indexing of the XRPD pattern led to the space group I41/amd. We did not observe any reversibility of this transition under ambient conditions even after several months. The structure of this Page 3 of 13 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Chemistry of Materials 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 4 activated compound 2 was solved from in-house XRPD-data using Expo2009.

The structure of the CAU-10-OCH3 (3) was also solved from XRPD-data. The pattern measured for the as synthesized compound could be indexed in the space group I41/a. Using direct methods, all framework atoms except the methyl group could be located, and therefore the linker molecule was completed using Materials Studio. This model was suc- cessfully refined by Rietveld-methods using TOPAS (Fig. 3). Table 1: Results of the Rietveld refinements.

Second-harmonic generation (SHG) or frequency doubling is a second order nonlinear optical process in which photons of frequency ω are converted in photons with the doubled fre- quency 2ω. Within the electric dipole approximation, SHG is described by the second-order nonlinear polarization P(2)(2ω) as in following equation: (2) (2) (2 ) : ( ) ( ) ω χ ω ω = P E E Eq. 1 with χ(2) the second-order susceptibility and E(ω) the electric field of the incoming light at frequency ω. For a centrosym- metric medium the electric field and polarization transform under the action of a centre of inversion as P  -P and E  -E. This means that equation 1 transforms to (2) (2) (2) (2) : ( )( ) : χ χ − = − − = = P E E EE P Eq. 2 which implies that χ(2) must be zero. Thus centrosymmetric media cannot generate SHG. In fact SHG is especially sensi- tive to the symmetry relations and organization of a system. As a consequence SHG-microscopy is increasingly used to deduce structural information from materials. Examples in- clude determination of domain structures,29,30 host/guest systems31,32 and structural transitions.33 Recently, a methodology based on polarization dependent SHG-microscopy to determine the point group symmetry of non-centrosymmetric structures has been developed by some of us.34 The methodology has been verified experimentally on systems of known symmetry35 and employed to determine the symmetry of molecular crystals of unknown structure successfully.36 Here we used a derivative methodology, only including the tetragonal non-centrosymmetric point group symmetries. Two polarization dependent tests were used for the determi- nation: in test 1 the plane of polarization of the linearly po- larized light incident on the sample is rotated over 360° while all second-harmonic light is detected, test 2 is identical except that an analyzer is placed in front of the detector, meaning that only the second-harmonic light of one linear polarization is detected. These tests lead to polarization plots Page 4 of 13 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Chemistry of Materials 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 5 in which the number of null points – called zeroes ‘z’ - and the number of times the plot behaves as an even function around a maximum or minimum intensity can be counted – called symmetry axes ‘sa’. For monocrystalline, tetragonal structures the expected observables are listed for each point group symmetry. Depending on whether the crystals are aligned with their crystallographic c-axis with the sample plane of the microscope, or have a different (called arbitrary) orientation, these differ, as can be seen in table 2. As can be seen from this table, the results of test 1 and 2 can be used to distinguish between the different non-centrosymmetric point group symmetries. If the material is not SHG-active, it means it belongs to a centrosymmetric point group, more specifically C4h or D4h. Indeed, for activated CAU-10-CH3 (2) and CAU-10-OCH3 (3), we could detect no SHG-activity, which confirms the space groups assigned via Rietveld refinement of the XRPD- data. In contrast, for the non-activated compound CAU-10- CH3 (2) we could detect SHG-activity. An SHG-image is shown in figure 5a. To assign a point group symmetry via polarized SHG-microscopy, we need to ensure that the analyzed parti- cles are indeed monocrystalline products. Via scanning elec- tron microscopy we confirmed that structures with a size of several µm with a distinct crystal habit are present (Fig. S38). For the analysis particles in the range of 2-3 µm were selected. In a first step the polarization dependency of the SHG intensity in test 1 and 2 was compared between differ- ent parts of the same particle. Only those particles that showed the same (albeit differently scaled) polarization de- pendence for all parts were chosen. Of these the majority showed the following observables in both test 1 and 2: 0 z and 0 sa. A minority of the particles showed the following observables: 0 z and 4 sa for test 1, and 0 z and 0 sa for test 2 (see figure 5b-e). This corresponds to the point group C4. The possible space groups derived from the le Bail fit are P41, and P4122 but only the first belongs to the point group symmetry C4. Thus, the SHG-results allow to assign the cor- rect space group and confirm the symmetry transition of CAU-10-CH3 (2) upon activation from a non- centrosymmetric to a centrosymmetric structure. Recently, for amino-functionalized MIL-53(Al) also a symmetry transi- tion that greatly diminshed the SHG-activity was observed, not upon activation, but upon adsorption of guest mole- cules.37c The same analysis was performed for CAU-10-H (1) with qualitatively the same results (Fig. S43), meaning that also this structure belongs to the point group C4, which is also in accordance with the determined space group I41. The compounds 4, 5 and 6 crystallize in primitive tetragonal space groups, as determined by indexing of their powder patterns and the observed extinction conditions. The cell parameters were confirmed by Le Bail-methods for these compounds (Tab. S2, Fig. S5-S7), but due to the crystallo- graphic complexity of these structures it was not possible up to now to refine the structural models. In fact it’s also diffi- cult to unambiguously assign a space group by the observed extinction conditions. One reason is the fact, that several space groups show identical extinction conditions in the XRPD-pattern. Moreover, in the case of the CAU-10-series, the differences between the extinction conditions are mar- ginal. Therefore the results of the SHG-measurements great- ly enhance the information about the non-refined members of the CAU-10-series. For compound 5 CAU-10-NH2 no SHG can be detected. This is in accordance with the assignment of a centrosymmetric space group by the Le Bail method. Compound 4 and 6 also showed SHG-activity, proving their non-centrosymmetric nature. However, SEM images (Fig. S40 and 42) show that only polycrystalline particles are present, meaning that a point group symmetry assignment based on SHG- microscopy cannot be performed. By XRPD we cannot dis- tinguish the space groups P41 and P4122 for CAU-10-NO2 (4). However, performing SHG measurements using parallel polarizers a distinction can be made, since only the space group P4122 belongs to D4-symmetry. A structure with point group D4 regardless of its orientation cannot generate SHG when placed between parallel polarizers (SI paragraph VIII). An agglomeration of such structures or polycrystalline sam- ple will neither generate SHG under these conditions, if the plane of polarization of the incident and second-harmonic generated light is not significantly rotated while passing through the polycrystalline particle. The latter condition was experimentally verified When measuring compound 4 be- tween parallel polarizers, a distinct SHG-signal was ob- served (Fig. 4). Thus the space group P41 is the correct one for this compound.

The inorganic building unit of the CAU-10-framework is a chain of cis-connected, corner shar- ing AlO6-polyhedra. Four of the oxygen atoms are part of four different carboxylate groups, while two bridging OH- ions in cis-position to each other complete the octahedral coordination of the Al-center. By this connectivity mode, helices are formed (Fig. 6). This helical inorganic building unit is remarkable since most often linear chains of trans- connected M(III)O6-polyhedra are observed in MOFs with one-dimensional inorganic units. Examples are the frame- work compounds with MIL-53 topology. Chains of edge- sharing AlO6-polyhedra are also known[38] but to the best of our knowledge there are only two Sc-based MOFs which contain such fourfold helical cis-connected chains of M(III)O6-polyhedra.[39] Page 6 of 13 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Chemistry of Materials 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 7 Figure 6: A dimeric unit of corner-sharing AlO6-octahdera on the left. A trimeric subunit is shown on the right, which hints at the formation of a helical arrangement. Aluminium atoms are shown in grey, oxygen in red and carbon in black. The framework of CAU-10 is formed by the connection of each helix to four adjacent inorganic building units of alter- nating rotational orientation via the organic linker molecules (Fig.7). Thus, square-shaped, sinusoidal channels are formed, which exhibit a maximum diameter of ~ 7 Å. Figure 7: A 2 x 2 supercell of the framework of CAU-10-H (1) as seen along the c-axis, showing the fourfold connectivity of the helices and the square-shaped channels that are formed. Depending on the functional groups, the framework struc- tures are only slightly changed while the topology itself is retained. Due to the size of the channels in the sub- nanometer range, these small changes have a massive impact on the accessibility of the pores for guest molecules. There- fore the structures of 2 and 3 are described herein in detail. While two symmetry independent helixes are observed in 1, the change of the linker molecules to methylisophthalic acid in 2 leads to a more symmetric structure (I41 vs. I41/amd). The adjacent AlO6-helices are related by a mirror plane which is parallel to the b-c-plane (Fig. 8) and passes through the carbon atoms in 2- and 5-position and the methyl-group of the organic moieties. Figure 8: The arrangement of the helices in the framework of CAU-10-CH3 (2) as seen along the b-axis. AlO6-polyhedra are shown in grey, oxygen atoms in red and carbon atoms in black. In the structure of CAU-10-OCH3 (3) which crystallizes in the space group I41/a, only one crystallographically inde- pendent helix is observed. The helices are related by an in- version axis, which is running parallel to the c-axis between four helices (Fig.9). Figure 9: The arrangement of the helices in the framework of CAU-10-OCH3 (3) as seen along the b-axis. AlO6-octahedra are shown in grey, oxygen atoms in red and carbon atoms in black. The different arrangements of the helices result as well in different alignments of the organic building units. The framework of CAU-10-CH3 (2) has the structure of highest symmetry. This results in functional groups which are pro- truding directly into the channels (Fig. 10, right). The short- est distance between two methyl-carbon atoms is 5.8 Å (cen- ter to center). The lower symmetry in CAU-10-OCH3 (3) results in a distortion of the framework, which gives rise to a slightly larger distance between the oxygen-atoms of the functional groups of 6.4 Å (center to center) (Fig. 10, left). In CAU-10-H (1), the distance of the aromatic carbon atoms in 5-position is 6.8 Å. The exact structures of the NO2-, NH2- and OH- functionalized MOFs remain yet unknown due to their crys- tallographic complexity and/or the rather insufficient crystal- linity. However, the sorption behavior points at structural similarities between CAU-10-NO2 (4) and CAU-10-H (1) as well as CAU-10-NH2 (5) / CAU-10-OH (6) and CAU-10- CH3 (2) / CAU-10-OCH3 (3).

AlO6-octahedra are shown in grey, oxy- gen atoms in red and carbon atoms in black. The differences in the CAU-10-X structures are due to a combination of the differences in the steric requirements of the functional groups and the interactions (inter ring distanc- es < 3.4 Å) of the aromatic moieties. We object to the framework topology of CAU-10 as an ar- chetype, which should be likely to form with several other trivalent cations as well as further V-shaped linker mole- cules, in analogy to the diversity observed for MIL-53- topology. This is supported by the recent discovery of a very similar MOF based on Sc3+ and the V-shaped 2,5- thiophenedicarboxylic acid.[39] Sorption behaviour. The subtle structural differences of these microporous compounds, i.e. the diameter of the pore aperture and the flexibility of the organic building units should result in drastically altered sorption properties. There- fore, the sorption behavior of all six members of the CAU- 10-series in the low pressure regime (up to 1 bar) was meas- ured using nitrogen and hydrogen at -196 °C and carbon dioxide and water vapor at 25 °C. Prior to every measure- ment, the samples were activated in vacuum (o.1 mbar) at 200 °C. The sorption isotherms for N2 at -196 °C are shown in Figure 11. For CAU-10-H (1) and CAU-10-NO2 (4), a type I isotherms was observed, indicating microporosity. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0 50 100 150 200 -H -CH3 -NO2 -OH Vads / cm³/g p/p0 Figure 11: Sorption isotherms of CAU-10-X compounds for nitrogen at -196 °C. Filled symbols represent the adsorption, empty symbols the desorption branches. While we observed isotherms typical for non porous com- pounds for 2 and 6 (-CH3 and –OH), for CAU-10-OCH3 (3) and –NH2 (5) (not shown) only an initial uptake of gas was measured. Due to the very slow equilibration, it was not pos- sible to measure full curves for 3 and 5 with appropriate precision. However, higher tolerance values for the pressure fluctuation during the measurements hint at the existence of accessible micropores. We attribute this behavior to the nar- row channels, which slow down the free diffusion of gas molecules in case of N2-adsorption, and thus extend the equilibration times. Thus, the functional groups have a mas- sive impact on the accessibility of the channels in the case of N2-sorption. The specific surface areas SBET are 635 m2/g and 440 m2/g for CAU-10-H (1) and CAU-10-NO2 (4), respec- tively. Their micropore volumes, determined by single point calculation at p/p0=o.5, are 0.25 cm3/g (for 1) and 0.18 cm3/g (for 4). The experimental value for the CAU-10-H (1) is in very good agreement with the theoretical pore volume of 0.23 cm3/g as obtained from a single point adsorption simu- lation by force-field methods.[40] The curves for the hydrogen adsorption show an uptake of this gas for all members of the series except CAU-10-CH3 (2) (Fig. 12). 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 -H -CH3 -OCH3 -NO2 -NH2 -OH mads / mg/g p / kPa Figure 12: Adsorption isotherms of 1 - 6 for hydrogen at -196 °C. The influence of the functional groups on the adsorption is clearly demonstrated. Their impact on the capacity is not only due to their size but also to the subtle structural differ- ences caused by these groups. Moreover the affinity towards H2 is varied. Although the micropore volumes of CAU-10-H (1) and CAU-10-NO2 (4) differ substantially, similar H2 up- takes at pressures below 40 kPa are observed. The reason for this result is probably the polar nature of the functional group, which induces a stronger affinity towards H2 in 4. The accessibility of the channels for H2 molecules is hardly influ- enced due to its smaller kinetic diameter (N2: 3.6 Å, H2: 2.6 Å), except for CAU-10-CH3 (2). The adsorption isotherms for CO2 were measured at 25 °C and clearly prove the porosity of all members of the CAU- 10-series (Fig. 13).

Even the pores of CAU-10-CH3 (2) are accessible towards CO2 molecules which can be attributed to the higher experi- mental temperature of 25 °C and stronger host-guest interac- tions. Although the kinetic diameter of CO2 molecules (3.3 Å) is larger than the one of H2 molecules (2.6 Å), the in- creased flexibility of the framework at 25 °C makes the pores of 2 accessible for CO2, while H2 is not adsorbed at -196 °C. Similar trends for capacities are found, as observed for the H2 adsorption. In comparison with the unfunctional- ized compound 1, substantially lower uptakes of gas are observed for 2, 3 and 6. The NO2-group in 4 and the NH2- group in 5 lead to intermediate capacities for these two MOFs. A pronounced influence of the functional groups was ob- served for the adsorption of water vapor, measured at 25 °C (Fig. 14). 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0 100 200 300 400 500 Vads/cm³/g p/p0 -H -CH3 -OCH3 -NO2 -NH2 -OH Figure 14: Adsorption isotherms of 1 - 6 for H2O at 25 °C. All MOFs show an uptake of water vapor and the amount is mainly determined by the size of the functional group. CAU- 10-NH2 (5) and CAU-10-OH (6) show pronounced uptakes of H2O molecules at low relative pressure which can be ex- plained by the existence of strong hydrogen-bonds between the functional groups in the MOF and the adsorptive (the broad band of the hydrogen-bonded water molecules are visible for non-dehydrated sample in the IR-spectra – Fig. S31, S33). Besides this, the point of condensation, at which the pores are filled with liquid adsorbate, is altered by the functionalization. The highest affinity towards H2O is ob- served for the highly polar groups in CAU-10-NH2 (5) and CAU-10-OH (6). The exact amounts of H2 and CO2 ad- sorbed at 100 kPa and the amount of H2O that was adsorbed after condensation are summarized in Table 3. Table 3: Total amounts of adsorbed gas or vapour.

For all the samples, molecular water is removed already during evacua- tion at RT. The fingerprint region of the CAU-10-X are not changed after water desorption (Fig. S23-S34). This suggests that dehydration leads at most to minor changes in the struc- ture. Correlation of Sorption Properties and Structure. In the framework of CAU-10-H (1), the channels are open and easily accessible for all measured gas molecules. The framework of CAU-10-CH3 (2) is only able to adsorb CO2 at 25 °C, but at -196 °C, no adsorption could be observed. In CAU-10-OCH3 (3), the size of the adsorbate seems to be the crucial parameter which determines the accessibility of the pores. To understand this sorption behavior, the H-atoms must be added to the framework structure. This was accom- plished by an automatic algorithm implemented in the Mate- rials Studio software.[27] The van-der-Waals-model of CAU-10-CH3 (2) shows, that only a very small aperture with a diameter of 1.4 Å allows the diffusion into the channels (Fig. 15). Figure 15: Unit cell of CAU-10-CH3 (2) on the left and CAU- 10-OCH3 (3) on the right, shown as van-der-Waals models. Aluminium atoms are light grey, oxygen atoms are red, carbon atoms are black and hydrogen atoms are dark grey. In the framework of CAU-10-OCH3 (3), this smallest diame- ter is 2.5 Å. This increase of the diameter by ~ 1 Å is mainly Page 9 of 13 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Chemistry of Materials 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 10 due to the functional group. In 2, the protons of the methyl- group limit the accessibility. In 3, the hydrogen atoms can be almost neglected, since the unprotonated oxygen-atoms of the methoxy-groups are limiting the diameter of the aperture (Fig.12). In the unfunctionalized CAU-10-H (1), the accessi- ble diameter according to the crystal structure is 4 Å, which allows the adsorption of all measured gases (Fig. 16). Figure 16: Van-der-Waals model of CAU-10-H (1). Aluminium atoms are light grey, oxygen atoms are red, carbon atoms are black and hydrogen atoms are dark grey. Therefore, the accessibility of 1 for all gases is in agreement with its crystal structure. For CAU-10-OCH3 (3), we must assume that the framework possesses a certain degree of flexibility, since the kinetic diameters of the gas molecules are larger than the channel openings. In the framework of CAU-10-CH3 (2), the flexibility of the MOF must be even higher than in 3, since the pore opening is smaller. There- fore, only at an elevated temperature of 25 °C, gas molecules can be adsorbed in 2. At -196 °C, its flexibility is too low to permit the adsorption of gases. An additional influence on this sorption behavior is given for sure by the higher mobili- ty of the gas molecules at 25 °C compared with -196 °C. However, since the pore diameter is nevertheless limiting the accessibility of the channels, we consider the framework flexibility as a crucial parameter. Stability measurements. The stabilities in aqueous solu- tions depending on the pH-value as well as under solvother- mal conditions in water were investigated by XRPD- and IR- measurements (Fig. S11-S16). For these tests, 50 mg of each MOF were stirred for 18 hours at room temperature in 4 mL of 0.01 M hydrochloric acid or 0.01 M sodium hydroxide solution. According to these results, the MOFs are stable in a pH-range from 2 to 8. Stirring under more basic conditions does not lead to a complete decomposition, but the pH-value is lowered to 8, indicating that the compounds are dissolved until a final pH-value of 8 is reached. The treatment in acidic solution (pH of 2), does not lead to additional bands in the IR-spectra, indicating that no isophthalic acid derivatives are formed by solvolysis of the MOFs, confirming their stability. Upon treatment with water at 130 °C under stirring for 3 hours, no decomposition is observed as well. This stability is lower compared to the series of zirconium based MOFs[7] but it is nevertheless very remarkable, especially in comparison with several MOFs based on divalent metal ions.[18] According to the thermogravimetric experiments, all of the MOFs decompose at temperatures around 400 °C (Fig. S17- S22). The temperature dependent XRPD-measurements for CAU-10-H (1) show a decomposition at ~ 430 °C (Fig. 17 and Fig. S8). While the removal of the adsorbed solvent molecules leads to changes in the relative intensities, the broadening of the reflections at 430 °C marks the beginning of the decomposition of the framework. These observations were also supported by temperature-dependent FTIR spec- troscopy (see SI). 10 20 30 500 410 320 230 140 2Θ / ° T / °C Figure 17: Temperature dependent XRPD-data of CAU-10-H measured in a capillary. For CAU-10-NO2 (4) and CAU-10-OH (6) we observed sim- ilarly high thermal stabilities in the temperature dependent XRPD-measurements (Fig. S9-S10). The decomposition starts at temperatures above 410 °C. During the heating, we observed almost no shift of the reflections for 1. For 4, a shift towards lower angles is observed. Thus, the unit cell of CAU-10-NO2 (4) is slightly expanding upon heating while it remains rather rigid in case of CAU-10-H (1). A slightly lower stability is observed in the temperature de- pendent IR-spectra (Fig. S23-S33), mainly attributed to the different measurement conditions in vacuum. Thus CAU-10- H (1) and CAU-10-CH3 (2) decompose at 350 °C, while the decomposition of CAU-10-NO2(4) starts already at 300 °C in vacuum. From the CAU-10-series, CAU-10-NH2 (5) and CAU-10-OCH3 (3) revealed the highest thermal stability under vacuum, decomposing only at 450 °C. The lowest stability was observed for CAU-10-OH (6), for which sam- ple damage appeared already at 250 °C. The lower stability compared to XRPD experiments can be attributed to the different measurement conditions. Temperature dependent IR spectra allowed also to follow the removal of traces of DMF and water molecules occluded inside the pores, which are removed up to 150 °C. In neither sample free isophthalic acid was observed in the IR-spectra. Nonlinear optical properties. While inorganic materials are still nearly exclusively used in practical applications of non- linear optical (NLO) materials, it is widely recognized that Page 10 of 13 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Chemistry of Materials 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 11 molecular-based materials can surpass these materials in their nonlinear optical characteristics: ultrafast response times, higher NLO-responses and a better processibility into devices.41,42 Metal-organic frameworks have been investigat- ed as a route to obtain nonlinear optical molecular-based materials.43,44 We quantified the SHG-response for the structure that has the highest SHG activity, namely CAU-10-NO2 (4). Assum- ing monocrystalline particles, the effective second order nonlinear optical coefficient averaged over all orientations <deff> was found to be 0.0002 pm/V (SI paragraph X). How- ever, the generated SHG intensity scales quadratically with the thickness of a single crystal, but only linearly with the number of crystallites. As the CAU-10-NO2 (4) sample con- sists in fact of a polycrystalline powder, this determined val- ue is an underestimation of the effective nonlinear optical coefficient with at least several orders of magnitude. Typical commercial NLO materials (such as KDP, BBO, KTP and LiIO3) show deff values between 0.4 and 15 pm/V. The true value of deff CAU-10-NO2 (4) will likely be in this range. The origin of the observed non-centrosymmetry must be attributed to the functional groups. While activated CAU-10- CH3 (2) exhibits the space group of highest symmetry I41/amd, the interactions between the linker molecules (dis- tance between adjacent linker molecules < 3.4 Å) in the oth- er MOFs induce a distortion of this ideal structure to space groups with lower symmetry which are subgroups of I41/amd. Another reason for this observation may be the existence of guest molecules inside the channels. For exam- ple, CAU-10-CH3 containing H2O crystallizes in the non- centrosymmetric space group P41. After thermal activation CAU-10-CH3 is found to crystallise in the centrosymmetric space group I41/amd. Therefore, the interactions inducing the SHG-activity are complex and can’t be attributed to one clearly defined interaction as observed in other MOFs.45 Conclusions Summarizing the results, a series of six MOFs was synthe- sized exhibiting the same framework topology, but different functional groups. The detailed characterisation clearly shows that subtle structural differences have a massive im- pact on the sorption capacity and affinity, as well as on the second-order nonlinear optical activity. The combination of XRPD and SHG measurements allows following structural changes upon activation and the determination of the correct space group. The straightforward synthesis of the com- pounds under very similar reaction conditions could be help- ful in tuning the sorption properties by using mixed linker systems. Moreover the topology of the CAU-10-series could be starting point for the synthesis of isoreticular compounds based on V-shaped ligands and trivalent cations. This would expand the range of opportunities for the modulation of the sorption behavior. Supporting Information available.

Vibrational spectra 3600 3200 2800 2000 1600 1200 800 absorbance / a. u. ν, cm -1 RT, air RT, vac 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 ν, cm -1 Fig. S23: Temperature dependent IR-spectra of CAU-10-H (1). By application of vacuum, the broad band of the hydrogen-bonds of adsorbed water molecules around 3300 cm-1 disappears. The peak of the νOH-vibration at 3615 cm-1 is therefore shifted to 3685 cm-1 after solvent removal. Furthermore, the νCH-vibration of the aromatic ring at 3075 cm-1 is clearly observed. The bands at 755 cm-1 and 724 cm-1 are characteristic for 1,3-substituted benzene-rings (out-of-plane-deformation of C-H bonds). The absence of a band at ~1685 cm-1 proves that no DMF is occluded inside the pores. The broadening of the peaks at 350 °C marks the beginning decomposition of the MOF. 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 intensity / a. u. wavenumber / cm -1 Fig. S24: Raman-spectrum of CAU-10-H (1). 22 3600 3200 2800 2000 1600 1200 800 absorbance / a. u. ν, cm -1 RT, vac 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 ν, cm -1 Fig. S25: Temperature dependent IR-spectra of CAU-10-CH3 (2). The peak of the νOH-vibration at 3676 cm-1 is prominent in the spectrum. Beside the νCH- vibration of the aromatic ring at 3075 cm-1, the νCH-vibrations of the CH3-group 2916 cm-1 (asymmetric) and 2845 cm-1 (symmetric) are clearly observed. The bands at 777 cm-1 and 730 cm-1 are characteristic for 1,3,5-substituted benzene-rings (out-of-plane-deformation of C-H bonds). The band at ~1685 cm-1 which belongs to the νCO-vibration of DMF disappears already at 100 °C.

Besides the νCH-vibrations of the aromatic ring at 3092 and 3006 cm-1, three bands of the νCH-vibrations of the OCH3-group at 2975 and 2945 cm-1 (asymmetric) and 2845 cm-1 (symmetric) are clearly observed.

The bands at 787 cm-1 and 724 cm-1 are characteristic for 1,3,5-substituted benzene-rings (out-of-plane-deformation of C-H bonds).

The peak of the νOH-vibration at 3693 cm-1 is very weak in the spectrum as well as the νCH- vibrations of the aromatic ring at 3068 cm-1. The broad band at 3330 cm-1 (νNH-vibration) and the band at 2845 cm-1 (νCH-vibration) can be explained by the partial formylation of the NH2- group during the synthesis (see paragraph XI). This is further confirmed by the νCO-band for amides at 1682 cm-1. The bands at 786 and 727 cm-1 are characteristic for 1,3,5-substituted benzene-rings (out-of-plane-deformation of C-H bonds).

By application of vacuum, the broad band of the hydrogen-bonds of adsorbed water molecules around 3300 cm-1 disappears. The peak of the νOH-vibration at 3615 cm-1 is thus only visible upon activation, as well as the peak at 3450 cm-1 which belongs to the νOH-group at the aromatic ring. The bands at 786 cm-1 and 727 cm-1 are characteristic for 1,3,5- substituted benzene-rings (out-of-plane-deformation of C-H bonds).

Description of the HT-experiments CAU-10-H (1) was discovered as the first MOF of the CAU-10-series. The investigated system was Al3+ / isophthtalic acid / DMF-water mixture and the 24-reactor HT-setup was used. Two different aluminium salts were employed as Al3+-source in different molar ratios Al3+ : linker. A 4:1 mixture of water and DMF (500 µL) was used as solvent (Tab. S4). The reactions were carried out at 145 °C for 12 h. Tab.

Employing AlCl3·6H2O as the Al3+-source, 1 could be synthesized but not as pure compound. In most cases, recrystallised isophthalic acid was observed as byproduct or in its pure form, no matter which molar ratio Al3+:linker was employed. In the last row, the Al3+-source was changed to the sulfate. In most reactions, the formation of 1 was observed accompanied by an unknown byproduct. Only for the molar ratio Al3+:linker 3:1, CAU-10-H was obtained as a single phase product. Further optimization of the reaction conditions and composition led to the optimized synthesis conditions described in the article. For the synthesis of the functionalized analogues of 1, an archetypical HT-experiment is described in Tab. S5 and Fig S36. Two different aluminium sources were employed. Different concentrations of reactants were employed at a constant ratio Al3+:linker in mixtures of water and DMF in varying ratios. The synthesis was carried out at 135 °C for 12 h. 29 Tab.

In this experiment the role of DMF for the synthesis becomes clearer. The use of pure water as solvent (reactions 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21) results not in the formation of a MOF, but in the recrystallization of the linker molecule. CAU-10-NO2 (4) is only obtained, if mixtures of water and DMF are employed. The formation of the MOF is apparently almost independent of the Al3+-source but strongly depends on the amount of Al3+ salt and DMF employed. Further optimization of the synthesis conditions led to the procedure described in the paper. 31 VII. Scanning electron microscopy images Fig. S37: SEM-Micrograph of CAU-10-H (1).

SHG intensity of this structure for tests 1 and 2 resp. corresponding to an arbitrarily oriented crystallite (b and c resp.) and a crystallite oriented with its c-axis aligned with the sample plane (d and e resp.) while varying the plane of polarization of the incident light (α). The incident light is linearly polarized and rotated along the direction of light propagation. Note that when the plane of polarization is 180° different, the plane of polarization of the incident light is identical. 35 IX. Theoretical treatment of SHG for D4 symmetry Equation 1 of the main text of the article can be rewritten as (2) (2) , i ijk j k i j P E E χ = ∑ Eq. S 1 in which the indices ijk refer to the Cartesian coordinates. Equation S 1 connects the components Pi (2) of the polarization vector with the components Ei of the electric field vector via the susceptibility tensor components χijk (2). For a structure with D4 only following susceptibility tensor components are non-zero: χxyz=χxzy= -χyzx=-χyxz and χzxy= -χzyx. In the latter tensor components the indices refer directly to the natural coordinate system of the structure with D4 symmetry. The measured SHG intensity IL 2ω polarized along the L direction is directly related to the polarization PL (2): 2 2 (2) ~ ω L L I P Eq. S 2 Employing equation S 1 and S 2 for a structure of D4 symmetry of any orientation yield following equation 2 (2) 2 2 2 ~ ( cos( ) sin( )) sin (2 ) ω χ ϕ ϕ θ − X xyz Y X Y I E E E Eq. S 3 in which θ and φ described the orientation of the crystal with respect to the Cartesian laboratory XYZ frame. θ is the angle between the z and the Z axis, φ is the angle between the projection of the z axis in the XY plane with the X axis. For light polarized parallel with the polarization direction of the detected second-harmonic intensity X, the component of the electric field of the incident light EY is zero. As can be seen from Eq. S 3 this means that the detected second harmonic intensity IX 2ω is zero. Thus a structure of D4 symmetry, regardless of its orientation, cannot generate SHG when placed between parallel polarizers. 36 X. Determination of the effective second-order nonlinear coefficient As a reference material a thin (100 µm thick) beta barium borate (BBO) crystal of which the second-order nonlinear properties are very well characterized was used. The crystal was cut to achieve type I phase-matching and optimize the quadratic nonlinear response (θ = 29.2°, φ = 90°; Eksma optics, BBO-601H). We compared the intensity of the second-harmonic light of activated CAU-10-NO2 (5) with that of the reference crystal by placing them consecutively in the SHG-microscope. Following equations describes the intensity of the SHG-light I2ω of the CAU-10-NO2 (5) crystallites (Eq.1) and the reference crystal (Eq. 2): 2 2 2 2 2 2 ( ) ω ω ω ω < > = eff d I A r I n n Eq. S 4 2 2 2 2 2 ,2 , ( ) ω ω θ ω ω = ooe o d I A L I n n Eq. S 5 In which A contains all variables that are identical in both equations, and Iω is the intensity of the incident laser light. In equation S 4, nω and n2ω are the refractive index of CAU-10-NO2 at the frequency of the incident light and second-harmonic light respectively, r is the size of the crystallites and <deff> is the effective nonlinearity coefficient averaged over all orientations of the particles. In equation S 5 no,ω is the ordinary refractive index of BBO at the frequency of the incident light and nθ,2ω the extraordinary refractive index at the frequency of the second- harmonic light propagating at an angle θ with the optical axis of the crystal, L is the thickness of the crystal and dooe is the effective nonlinearity coefficient for the Type I phase-matched interaction. Reported values for the refractive index of metal-organic frameworks vary between 1.2 and 1.65 in the VIS to NIR spectral region (Adv. Mater. 2008, 21, 1931–1935; Inorg. Chem. 2010, 49, 10283–10290; Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2012, 14, 4713–4723). We used here the intermediate value of 1.4 for both nω and n2ω of CAU-10-NO2. For determination of the intensity of the second-harmonic light linearly polarized incident light was used, while all generated second-harmonic light was collected. The intensity per particle was averaged for four different orientations of the plane of polarization of the incident light (all 45° apart) and corrected with the size of the particle estimated from the microscopic image was used for r (typically 3-4 µm). The average SHG intensity of 15 particles corrected for their size was used to compare with the SHG intensity of the reference. 37 Eq. S 4 is deduced for monocrystalline particles. However, as can be seen from the SEM- image (see figure S 40) these are not present. However as the SHG intensity I2ω scales quadratically with the crystallite size but only linearly with amount of crystallites, deducing <deff> via eq. S 4 leads to a coefficient that is a gross underestimation for polycrystalline particles. 38 XI. In-situ-formylation of CAU-10-NH2 (5) To prove the partial formylation of the amino-group, a 1H-NMR-spectrum of CAU-10-NH2 (5) dissolved in 5% NaOD in D2O was measured (Fig. S 44). 10 8 6 4 2 0 ppm Fig. S44: 1H-NMR-spectrum of CAU-10-NH2 (5) dissolved in 5% NaOD in D2O (reference: TMS). The signals at 7.53 ppm (triplet) and 7.18 ppm (duplet) are the signals of the H-atom in 2- position and the H-atoms in 4- and 6-position of the benzene ring, respectively. The signal at 2.06 ppm (singlet) corresponds to dimethylamine and the signal at 8.26 ppm (singlet) to formic acid. Both species are observed due to the solvolysis of DMF in basic solution, but the ratio of integrals of 1:1 does not match the expected value of 6:1 for HN(CH3)2 : HCOOH. Thus only a minor amount of formic acid is observed due to traces of DMF in the MOF, but the main amount is obtained by solvolysis of the formylated aminoisophthtalate. The degree of formylation based on integrals is ~ 50%. This was further confirmed by solid-state NMR-spectra. The signals of the CP-MAS-13C- spectrum (Fig. S45) are attributed to the respective atoms in Tab. S6. 39 200 180 160 140 120 100 * * * * ppm * Fig. S45: CP-MAS-13C-NMR-spectrum of CAU-10-NH2 (5) at a rotation frequency of 5 kHz.
