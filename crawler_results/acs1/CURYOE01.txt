China Received November 10, 2009; Revised Manuscript Received February 24, 2010 ABSTRACT: The use of the planar tetradentate ligands 1,2,4,5-tetra(4-pyridyl)benzene (bztpy) and 1a,4a-dihydroxy- 1e,2e,4e,5e-tetra(4-pyridyl)cyclohexane (chtpy) obtained by hydrothermal in situ metal/ligand reactions enabled the isolation of three metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) related to ligand-influencing factors with the formulas R-[CdCl2(bztpy)] 3 H2O (1), β-[CdCl2(bztpy)] 3 H2O (2), and [Cd4(O2CPh)2Cl2(OH)(chtpy)2(H2O)2](NO3)3 3 4.5H2O (3). 1 and 2 are two supramolecular isomers featuring a two-dimensional (2D) (4,4) net and three-dimensional (3D) NbO net that result from the conformational freedom of the bztpy ligands. 3 has a novel 3D MOF structure based on cuboidal {Cd4} clusters. The high-connected {Cd4} clusters connected to each other through planar tetradentate ligands in 3 ensured its uncommon (4,8)-connected scu topology. A discussion of the crystal structures, as well as the coordination behavior of the special tetradentate ligands upon differences geometries of the central connector, is provided. Introduction The rapidly expanding field of crystal engineering of multi- dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is of great current interestfor bothstructural andtopologicaldiversity as well as for their potential application as functional materials.1 Crystal engineering principles provide a facile approach to the controlled assembly of one- to three-dimensional (1-3D) extended networks,2 which has recently become marvelously state-of-the-art. Recent elaboration has demonstrated the dramatic influence of the building-block approach on the framework of inorganic materials, and much effort has been made toward the connecting of suitable predetermined build- ing blocks into networks in order to obtain the desired mate- rals.3 A potentially efficient way to synthesize high dimen- sional MOFs should be to focus on the organic ligands with specific structrual features. In this regard, development of new multitopic building blocks is one of the central tasks. As a nonconventional method, hydrothermal in situ metal/ ligand reactions provide not only novel functional MOFs, but also unusual organic ligands that are inaccessible or not easily obtainable by conventional methods.4 We have been recently investigating a novel in situ metal/organic reaction of an unprecedented dehydrogenative coupling and hydroxylation of 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp) into a dihydroxylcyclo- hexane ligand a,a-1,4-dihydroxy-e,e,e,e-1,2,4,5-tetra(4-pyri- dyl)cyclohexane (chtpy) in its CuI coordination polymers, which could be isolated by demetallization with Na2(H2edta). Fortunately, the 1,2,4,5-tetra(4-pyridyl)benzene (bztpy) has also been successfully isolated from the powder product of the above hydrothermal systems, which can be applied to con- struct a series of novel 2D and 3D MOFs.5a,b Tetradentate nitrogen-containing ligands with novel structrual features offer the possibility to realize MOFs with specific topologies.6 In our previous investigation, we pre- pared and characterized a (4,4) net, a rare moganite net, a PtS net, and a (3,4)-connected net with tetrahedral CuI atoms and the planar tetratopic ligands chtpy generated in situ.5a Gen- erally, employing a planar tetratopic bridging ligand pro- motes the formation of 2-3D MOFs. However, the topological tunable properties of MOFs are also influenced by factors of the coordination nature of the central connec- ter of metal ion or cluster subunit.7 As part of our ongoing efforts in the extension of these functional four-connected ligands to other metal salts or polynuclear metal cluster blocks, we report herein three new MOFs, namely, R-[CdCl2- (bztpy)] 3 H2O (1), β-[CdCl2(bztpy)] 3 H2O (2), and [Cd4(O2- CPh)2Cl2(OH)(chtpy)2(H2O)2](NO3)3 3 4.5H2O (3). Two su- pramolecular isomers 1 and 2 were obtained by adjusting the template and reaction temperature, displaying (4,4) and NbO net topologies, respectively. 3 is a rare, bcu-tpye framework, assembled from chtpy as a bridging liands and an eight- connecting tetracadmium cluster as a building block. 3 is a good candidate for the MOFs constructed from a high- connected polynuclear metal cluster unit and a predesigned polydentate ligand.

Solution of (NH4)2S (0.681 g, 10 mmol) was dropwise added to a stirred suspension of the powder and crystal products (1.250 g), which were obtained from the hydrother- mal treatment of in situ synthesized fresh Cu(OH)2 (from Cu- (NO3)2 3 3H2O and NaOH) with 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp) and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid,5a in chloroform (120 mL) and water (40 mL) at room temperature.

The diffraction data for compounds bztpy 3 EtOH, bztpy 3 2H2O, and 1-3 were recorded on a Bruker Smart Apex CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo-KR radiation (λ = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 123 K (for bztpy 3 EtOH, 2 and 3) and 293 K (for bztpy 3 2H2O and 1). Processing data was accomplished with use of the program SAINT; an absorption correction based on symmetry equivalent reflections was applied using the SADABS program.8 The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method on F2 with SHELXTL program package.9 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters except for the disordered groups. The disordered guest molecules were subjected to geometric restraints during the refinements. The crystallographic details and selected bond lengths and bond angles are provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Results and Discussion Synthesis and Characterization. As the ligand was isolated from a copper coordination polymer, we found that bztpy has many desirable characteristics, including two stereoi- somers (staggered and eclipsed conformations in bztpy 3 EtOH and bztpy 3 2H2O, respectively, see Scheme 1). The two kinds of conformation isomers, in which four pyridyl rings oriented as left- and right-handed propellers around the central phenyl rings differ. The energy barrier for the inver- sion of a propeller should be low enough that bztpy can exist in two forms at room temperature. Therefore, in a coordina- tion network, there is a chance that one of the two supra- molecular isomers will be favored over the other at a certain temperature.10 This speculation did lead to the isolation of two supramolecular isomers 1 and 2. Reaction of CdCl2 3 4H2O, bztpy, and water at 160 C for 72 h yielded colorless needle crystals of 1 in a single phase. Interestingly, pale Table 1.

An appro- priate auxiliary small ligand is an important consideration to fulfill its geometric limitation in the construction of metal cluster SBU.11 As an addition of terminal benzoic acid to the CdCl2 and tetradentate ligand reaction system results in the formation of a high-connected cluster-based coordination polymer 3, a cooperative assembly process different from the single metal species is indicated. Phase purity of the bulk materials was confirmed by comparison of its powder diffraction pattern with that calculated from the single crystal study (Figures S1-S3 in Supporting Information). Crystal Structures. X-ray structural analysis shows that 1 crystallized in the monoclinic space group of P2/n. The asymmetric unit contains one half of a formula unit, that is, half of a crystallographically unique CdII atom, half of the bztpy ligand, one coordinated Cl- counterion and half of the lattice water molecule. The metal ion and the organic ligand are situated on a 2-fold rotation axis. The cadmium adapts an octahedral geometry with four bztpy units on the equa- torial plane and accordingly, along with the four-bridging ligands, form a two-dimensional (4,4) coordination layer. A perspective view of the coordination environment of the CdII atom and the bridging planar 4-connected bztpy ligand is given in Figure 1a. The vertices are octahedral Cd atoms with equatorial planes filled by pyridyl nitrogen atoms from four different bztpy liangds (Cd-N = 2.389(3)-2.396(3) A˚ ). The axial sites are filled by two symmetry-related Cl atoms (Cd-Cl = 2.562(1) A˚ ). It is worth noting that bztpy ligand in 1 adopts a staggered conformation, the same as the origi- nal conformation in bztpy 3 EtOH that crystallized in etha- nol; the dihedral angles between the centered benzene ring and pyridyl rings are 45.27 and 53.76, respectively, and the dihedral angle of two opposite pyridyl rings is 81.00. Each bztpy ligand acts as a tetradentate bridge to connect the CdCl2 motifs into a 2D (4,4) net, which lies in the bc crystallographic plane and contains two square openings of ca. 4.06  4.06 and 3.03  3.03 A˚ as defined by the shor- test transannular distance factoring van der Waals radii, respectively (Figure 1b). The adjacent grids are stacked offset with respect to each other in an ABAB fashion. The most interesting structural feature is the alternat- ing layers are connected by O-H 3 3 3 Cl hydrogen-bonds (Owater 3 3 3 Cl = 3.112-3.287 A˚ ) between coordinated Cl atoms and the disorder guest water molecules clathrated in the grids, thereby generating two identical interpene- trated 3D hydrogen-bonded supramolecular frameworks (Figure 1c). In contrast to 1, it is interesting that the assembly of the same [CdCl2] building fragments and planar tetratopic bztpy linkers forms an extended 3D non-interpenetrated frame- work 2. Owing to the conformation freedom in the geometry, the dihedral angles between the pyridyl rings and centered benzene ring are all distorted to 46.91, the two opposite pyridyl rings are completely eclipsed in 2, and the symmetry of the crystal system is higher from monoclinic to trigonal. A perspective view of the asymmetric unit of 2 with an atom numbering scheme is given in Figure 2a. In 2, the asymmetric unit contains a quarter of the formula unit and there is one octahedral CdII atom, which lies in a special position (SOF = 0.25), one quarter of the bztpy ligand lying on a special position, and one-half of Cl- atom and one- quarter of guest water molecule. The two symmetry-related terminal Cl- atoms coordinate axially to the CdII atom (Cd-Cl = 2.561(1) A˚ ), the pyridyl rings of four distinct bztpy ligands are found to occupy the equatorial positions about the metal center; the four Cd-N bond lengths are 2.418(4) A˚ . From the point of view of structural description of the coordination polymer, the CdII atom may be consi- dered equivalent to a 4-connecting square-planar node, as the Cl- atoms merely serve to fill the coordination sphere. Thus, the coordination polymer built up of 4-connecting D4h-symmetric metal ions and square-planar tetratopic bztpy ligands in the ratio 1:1 is precisely equivalent to the NbO network12 (Figure 2d). Such a net structure can be characterized by a short vertex symbol of 64.82. The long Sch€afli symbol is 62.62.62.62.82.82. However, because of the large twist (open angle: 69.5 and 110.4) between the pyridyl rings in ortho and meta position in the bztpy link the neighboring Cd square units are not strict perpendicular, which leads to an oblique NbO-like extended network (Figure 2b). The 3D propagation of these adamantanoid units relative to their 3-fold screw axis (pitch: 6.6 A˚ ) leads to the large left- and right-handed alternate hexagonal channels along the c-axis (Figure 2c); when the van der Waals radii are Table 2.

Scheme 1. Hydrothermal in Situ Metal/Ligand Reactions in Our Previous Worka a Two novel tetradentate ligands chtpy and bztpy were isolated by demetallization with different precipitating agents (a). The staggered (b) and eclipsed conformations (c) of bztpy are found when bztpy molecules cocrystallized with two different solvents. These two different morphologies are also found in compounds 1 and 2 in the present work which is forthcoming. 1746 Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 4, 2010 Hu et al. considered, it is about 11.38 A˚ in diameter. The Vvoid of 2 (without guest water molecules) is 44.9% as calculated by PLATON.13 The disordered guest water molecules are located in the hexagonal channels. The structure of 3 is built around crescent-shaped [Cd4Cl2- (OH)(O2CPh)2]3þ clusters. The utilization of polynuclear metal clusters as building blocks creates more opportunities to construct highly connected MOFs due to their large surface areas (sometimes even nanoscale) meaning they can more readily accommodate the steric demands of organic linkers.14 Another suitable square-planar tetratopic chtpy ligand, which was also obtained from our previous investiga- tion, was selected for the present high-connected assembled system. In 3, the asymmetric unit contains a quarter of the formula unit and consists of two half-occupancy cadmium atoms, one-half μ3-OH or one-half μ3-Cl atom residing on the same symmetry site with 0.5 probability, one-quarter- occupancy μ-Cl atom and one-half-occupancy benzoate ligand, one-half chtpy ligand lying proximate to inversion center, two uncoordinated NO3 - counteranion (SOF = 0.5 and 0.25), one-half-occupancy coordination water molecule, and 4.5 disorder guest water molecules. The {Cd4}8þ core is held together by one μ3-OH, one μ3-Cl, and one μ-Cl atom. Peripheral ligation is provided by two μ3-benzoate groups, two terminal coordination water molecules, and eight pyr- idyl groups from eight different chtpy ligands (Figure 3a). Cd1 is bound to two benzoate oxygen atom (Cd-O = 2.348(5) A˚ ), one terminal water molecule, two pyridyl nitrogen atoms and one μ3-OH/μ3-Cl atom (Cd-O/Cl = 2.432(6) A˚ ), and Cd2 is bound to two benzoate oxygen atom (Cd-O = 2.274(9) A˚ ), one μ-Cl- atom, two pyridyl nitrogen atoms and two μ3-OH/μ3-Cl atom (Cd-O/Cl = 2.573(4) A˚ ). Each chtpy ligand acts as a tetradentate bridge and coordi- nates through all four pyridyl groups. All of the Cd-N distances are in the range between 2.306(6) and 2.319(7) A˚ . Moreover, the tetranuclear cadmium can also be considered as one distorted cuboidal Cd4O3Cl core with the four octahedrally coordinated cadmium atoms occupying four alternating corners of a cube. The other corners are occu- pied by Cl atom and oxygen atoms of benzoate groups and OH group. The Cd 3 3 3 Cd distances in the cuboidal core span the range of 3.329(1)-4.099(1) A˚ . The overall arrange- ment of the cuboidal tetranuclear cadmium cluster has idealized D2d symmetry. Each metal center on the corners of the cuboidal {Cd4} core acts as a point of network extension and links two different chtpy ligands, so that each cluster serves as a cubic-like node (Figure 3b) and is coordinated by eight bridging chtpy ligands, which link 24 equivalent cluster cores, forming a 3D noninterpenetrated cationic net of 3 (Figure 3c). Interestingly, two distinct channels exist in two directions within the cationic frame- work of 3: along the b axis the channels have an rhombus shape of about 3.23  3.23 A˚ and along the c axis rectan- gular channels can be observed with dimensions of about 6.85  2.50 A˚ (taking account of the van der Waals radii). An analysis with PLATON13 suggests that the channels occupy 33.7% of the total volume. The uncoordinated NO3 - counteranions and guest water molecules are located in these channels. The novel binodal high-connected topology can be simplified by considering just the tetradentate ligands (represented by a square-planar node) and the {Cd4} clusters (represented by a cubic node). The resulting net is shown in Figure 3d, which is a rare (4,8)-connected net with square-planar nodes and cubic nodes in the ratio 2:1. A topological analysis of this net was performed with OLEX.15 The long topological vertex symbol (O’Keeffe) is 4.4.43.43.818.818 for the chtpy node, and 4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.4.89.89.89.89.89.89.89.89 for the Cd4 node, which gives the short vertex symbol (44.62)2- (416.612). Thanks to the novel square-planar tetratopic chtpy ligand, compound 3 is a rare example of MOFs having (4,8)- connected scu16 topology consisting of square-planar and cubic Figure 2.

Of the important (4,8)-connected topological nets, there is another possible topology that is based upon tetrahedral and cubic nodes, the 3D networks of fluorite (CaF2 or flu) (46)(412.612.84), which also have been seldom observed.17 Conclusions In summary, we successfully synthesized and characterized three new MOFs based on two novel tetradentate ligands isolated from our previously hydrothermal in situ metal/ ligand reactions. Ligand oriented effects are exhibited in two supramolecular isomers 1 and 2 which possess a 2D (4,4) net and 3DNbO net, respectively. Anevenmore important aspect is the high possibility to use these bulky tetradentate ligand skeletons for construction of more complicated 3D MOF structures with defined connectivity. 3 is a rare microporous, (4,8)-connected scu-type structure that contains an eight- connected polynulear cluster unit and a planar tetradentate ligand. These results confirm the potential for synthesizing new MOF structures of functional materials using the un- common planar tetradentate ligands isolated from an inge- nious hydrothemal in situ metal/ligand reaction. Further research is currently in progress. Acknowledgment.
