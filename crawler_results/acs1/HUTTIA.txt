Blake, Claire Wilson, Peter Hubberstey, Neil R. Champness,* and Martin Schr€oder* School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham NG7 2RD, U.K. Received July 22, 2009 We have synthesized five new metal-organic coordination polymers incorporating the bent ligand H2hfipbb [4,40-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid)] with different transition metal ions and co-ligands via solvothermal reactions to give [Zn2(hfipbb)2(py)2] 3 DMF (1), [Zn2(hfipbb)2(4,40-bipy)(H2O)] (2), [Zn2(hfipbb)2(bpdab)] 3 2DMF (3), [Cd2(hfipbb)2(DMF)2] 3 2DMF (4), and [Co(hfipbb)(dpp)] 3 MeOH (5) (py = pyridine, 4,40-bipy = 4,40-bipyridine, bpdab = 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene, dpp = 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane). Compound 1 displays a 2-fold 2Df2D parallel interpenetrated layer network with one-dimensional (1D) helical channels, while 3 exhibits a three-dimensional pillared helical-layer open framework of R-Po topology based upon binuclear paddlewheel units. In compounds 2 and 5, binuclear motifs with double carboxylate bridges are linked by hfipbb2- ligands into a 1D ribbon, which are further assembled into two-dimensional non-interpenetrated (4,4) layers via bipyridyl co-ligands. However, the different bridging modes of hfipbb2- ligands and the different disposition of the coordinated co-ligands around metal ions result in subtle differences in the final architecture. Thus, 2 is based on a binuclear cluster node, double-stranded hfipbb2- linkers, and single-stranded 4,40-bipy linkers, while 5 is based on a binuclear cluster node and hfipbb2- and dpp linkers which are both double-stranded. Among these compounds, the Cd(II) complex 4 is possibly the most interesting because it represents a rare example in which metal centers are linked by carboxylate groups into infinite chains further joined together by hfipbb2- spacers to form a 2D network with tubular helical channels. All these coordination polymers exhibit low solvent-accessible volumes. Both 3 and 4 retain structural integrity and permanent microporosity upon evacuation of guest molecules, with hydrogen uptakes of 0.57 and 0.78 wt %, respectively, at 20 bar and 77 K. Introduction The design and synthesis of metal-organic coordination polymers have drawn significant interest in recent years,1 not only for their structural diversity and intriguing mole- cular topologies2,3 but also for their potential as a new class of porous materials applied in the fields of separation,4 *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In particular, variation of ligand confor- mations often plays a key role in the self-assembly processes to give metal-organic coordination polymers with different structural topologies. By adjusting the shape, functionality, flexibility, length, and symmetry of the spacers, a remarkable range of materials containing various architectures and functions can be prepared.1,8-11 Carboxylate O-donors have the ability to coordinate to metal centers in a variety of modes, ranging from mono- or bis-chelate fashion to μ3-η2:η, μ4-η2:η2, and μ5-η3:η3 bridging modes.9-13 The wide variety of coordination modes of carboxylates and their high affinity for metal ions give metal carboxylate complexes a rich structural chemistry. In addi- tion, the carboxylate unit can bind together with a phosphate group or an N-containing heterocycle to give intriguing hybrid structures.14 Thus, polycarboxylate ligands, in parti- cular, aromatic di- and multibranched carboxylates (i.e., terephthalic, isophthalic, trimesic, and pyromellitic acid) and various pyridine- and imidazole-dicarboxylates, have been widely used in the rational design of metal-organic coordination polymers.9-18 Recently, strategies have been reported using combinations of appropriate N,N0-donor bidentate ligands to introduce pillars to link well-defined two-dimensional (2D) metal-carboxylate layers.19 In this way the structures of a wide variety of coordination polymers can be predicted, and the pore size and chemical functionality of the resultant open frameworks readily controlled via a modification of the pillars.20 One of the best-known exam- ples is the series [M2(2,3-pyzdc)2Lpillar]n [M = Cu and Cd; 2,3-pyzdc2-=pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylate; Lpillar=pyrazine, 4,40-bipyridine, 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)glycol, 1,4-diazabicyclo[222]- octane, and py-NdN-py/py-CHdCH-py (py = pyridin- 4-yl)].20,21 These microporous materials incorporate pillar ligand bridges between the neutral layers of [M2(2,3- pyzdc)2]n. Other examples of porous pillar-layered architec- tures are based upon binuclear paddlewheel building blocks bridged by linear anionic dicarboxylates to form 2D square grids further extended by various neutral N,N0-donor pillars to give three-dimensional (3D) R-Po porous structures with one-dimensional (1D) channels.19,22 Some of these layer- pillared architectures display a degree of hydrogen storage capacity.19,22a-c We report herein the use of the commercially available 4,40-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) (H2hfipbb) asa tectoninthesynthesis of novelcoordination frameworks. The hfipbb2- ligand incorporates a C(sp3) fluorinated spacer which forces it to be bent, thus enhancing the potential (5) (a) Wu, C. D.; Hu, A.; Lin, W. B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 8940.

Experimental Section General Procedures. All chemicals for synthesis were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification, with the exception of 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene (bpdab), prepared according to the literature procedure.24 Ele- mental analyses of C, H, and N were performed by the Ele- mental Analysis Service of the School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham. Infrared spectra were measured as KBr discs on a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR system over the 400-4000 cm-1 range. Thermal gravimetric (TG) measurements were per- formed on a Rheometric Scientific STA 1500H thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 1 C/min-1 under nitrogen flow (generally 60 mL/min). X-ray powder diffraction data were collected on a Philips X’pert powder diffractometer with Cu KR radiation from samples mounted on the flat glass plate sample holder. Scans of approximately 90 min were run for each sample over the range 5 e 2θ e 60 with a step size of 0.02 in 2θ.

X-ray Crystallography. Suitable crystals were glued to glass fibers and mounted on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD area detector diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystems open-flow cryostat and graphite monochromated Mo KR radia- tion (λ = 0.71073 A˚ ). Data were collected at 150 K, reduced and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects using the SAINT26 program and for absorption using the SADABS27 program. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS28 and refined with the full-matrix least-squares tech- nique using SHELXTL.28 The non-H atoms, with the exception of those in disordered solvent molecules, were modeled with anisotropic displacement parameters, and refined by the full- matrix least-squares on F2. Carbon-bound H atoms were placed in calculated positions and refined using the riding model. In the structures of 2 and 5 the starting positions for water (2) and methanol (5) H atoms were located from the difference Fourier syntheses, and then refined either with restraints for O-H bonds of coordinated water molecules or by using a geometrical model for methanol molecules. Further details for crystallographic data and refinement conditions are summarized in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in Support- ing Information, Table S1. Hydrogen Adsorption Measurements. Hydrogen adsorp- tion-desorption experiments were conducted at 77 K using an IGA gravimetric adsorption apparatus equipped with a micro- gram balance, 2 mbar, 100 mbar, and 20 bar pressure transdu- cers, and a clean ultrahigh vacuum system. Ultrapure H2 (99.9995%) was purified further by using calcium aluminosili- cate adsorbents to remove trace amounts of water and other impurities before introduction into the IGA system. For mea- surements at 77 K, a standard low-temperature liquid nitrogen Dewar vessel was used. Before gas adsorption measurements, the sample was activated at 150 C (for 3) and 200 C (for 4) under ultrahigh vacuum (10-8 mbar) overnight. About 50 mg of samples were loaded for gas adsorption, and the weight of each sample was recorded before and after outgassing to confirm complete removal of all guest molecules including the coordi- nated DMF in 4. All isotherm data points were fitted by the IGASwin system software v.1.03.143 (Hiden Isochema, 2004) using a linear driving force model when >98% equilibration had been reached. All changes in sample weight were corrected for buoyancy effects. Results and Discussion Synthesis. Hydro(solvo)thermal synthetic methods were used for the synthesis and crystallization of metal complexes. An interesting 2-fold parallel interpenetrated layered network [Zn2(hfipbb)2(py)2] 3 DMF (1) was ob- tained by heating H2hfipbb, Zn(NO3)2 3 6H2O and pyr- idine in DMF at 120 C. The coordinated pyridine molecules in 1 are nearly perpendicular to the layers and protrude into the interlamellar regions. This suggests that the coordinated pyridine molecules in 1 might be replaced by neutral bridging N,N0-donors to form pillared frameworks with potential stable porosity. The solvother- mal reaction of H2hfipbb and Zn(NO3)2 3 6H2O in the presence of 4,40-bipy, however, afforded an alternative layered coordination framework, [Zn2(hfipbb)2(4,40- bipy)(H2O)] (2). When the spacer of the auxiliary ligands is elongated to 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene (bpdab), the corresponding solvothermal reactions of Zn(NO3)2 3 6H2O with H2hfipbb gave the targeted 3D 2-fold interpenetrated framework, [Zn2(hfipbb)2(bpdab)] 3 2DMF (3), the structure of which is composed of layers of {Zn2} paddlewheels and bpdab pillars. The solvothermal reaction of H2hfipbb, Cd(NO3)2 3 6H2O and 4,40-bipy in DMF afforded a unique layered framework composed of helical tubes, [Cd2(hfipbb)2(DMF)2] 3 2DMF (4), that surprisingly does not include 4,40bipy in the product. With 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane (dpp), the corresponding solvothermal reaction of H2hfipbb with Co(NO3)2 3 6H2O in H2O-MeOH mixture afforded [Co(hfipbb)- (dpp)] 3 MeOH (5), a layered compound, structurally dif- ferent from 1-4. Description of Crystal Structures Structure of [Zn2(hfipbb)2(py)2] 3 DMF (1).

In this binuclear unit (Figure 1b), each Zn(II) ion resides in a square pyramidal coordination geometry with the apical position occupied by a coordinated pyridine molecule [Zn-N(apical) = 2.0300(15) A˚ ], while the basal plane consists of four carboxylate O atoms [Zn-O = 2.0295(14)-2.0593(12) A˚ ]. The intradimer Zn 3 3 3 Zn se- paration is 2.9758(7) A˚ , within the normal range found in other reported bimetallic paddlewheel units of type [M2(O2CR)4].29 In 1, each paddlewheel unit connects to four neighboring paddlewheel clusters via bridging hfipbb2- dianions, which adopt a bridging tetradentate mode (Scheme 2a) to form a 2D undulating (4,4) net with large rhomb-like windows (Figure 2a). The dimensions of the rhombic window are 14.02  14.02 A˚ 2 as measured between the centroids of the binuclear Zn(II) subunits at the corners of the window. As depicted in Figure 2b, the skeleton of this 2D sheet can also be described as a unique helical layer in which the left and right helical chains appear alternatively by sharing the paddlewheel clusters. The pitch of helix is double the b parameter (15.685 A˚ ). Most strikingly, the two diagonals of the rhombic window are equal to unit cell parameters b and c, respec- tively. Two closest identical helical layers shift by b so that the paddlewheel units from one layer fall in the center of the window of the other layer, and inter- penetrate each other in a parallel 2Df2D fashion, result- ing in an interwoven bilayer with 1D double helical channels (Figures 2b and 2c).

Stacking of the inter- woven bilayers along the a-axis reveals the coordinated pyridyl molecules lying almost perpendicular to the layers, but they are not long enough to create solvent- accessible interlamellar space. The effective void volume estimated by PLATON/SOLV30 is only 575.9 A˚ 3 corre- sponding to 12.4% of the unit cell volume of 4632(3) A˚ 3. Disordered DMF molecules reside within the helical channels. There are also weak interlayer C-H 3 3 3 F hy- drogen bonds formed between fluorine atoms and pyr- idine C-H groups at the edges of adjacent interwoven bilayers [H 3 3 3 F = 2.36-2.38 A˚ , C 3 3 3 F = 2.997- (3)-3.005(2) A˚ ]. A similar cobalt-hfipbb coordination polymer has been reported recently.29g Structure of [Zn2(hfipbb)2(bpy)(H2O)] (2). To extend the parallel interpenetrating helical bilayers into 3D frameworks, we employed the rod-like exobisdentate 4,40-bipy as a co-ligand to replace the monodendate pyridine molecule in 1. However, the reaction of Zn- (NO3)2 3 6H2O, H2hfipbb, and 4,40-bipy did not afford the targeted 3D coordination polymer, but a different layered compound, [Zn2(hfipbb)2(bpy)(H2O)] (2). Single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that 2 contains two distinct Zn(II) ions in the asymmetric unit (Figure 3a). Zn1 has a distorted octahedral coordination geometry, provided by four oxygens [Zn-O = 2.007(2)-2.317(2) A˚ ] from three carboxylate ligands, one pyridyl nitrogen [Zn-N = 2.094(2) A˚ ] and one water molecule [Zn-O = 2.125(2) A˚ ]. Zn2 is tetrahedrally coordinated by three carboxylate oxygen atoms [Zn-O = 1.934(2)-1.965(2) A˚ ] and one pyridyl nitrogen [Zn-N = 2.038(2) A˚ ]. The two Zn(II) centers are bridged by a pair of syn-syn hfipbb2- carboxylate groups into a binuclear unit with intradimer Zn 3 3 3 Zn separation of 3.891 A˚ . Significantly, these binuclear units are doubly interlinked by the bent hfipbb2- moieties to form an infinite ribbon where two different bridging modes of the hfipbb2- ligands can be distinguished (Scheme 2c and d).

Article Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 23, 2009 11073 The infinite ribbons formed by Zn(II) ions and hfipbb2- ligands in 2 are further connected through 4,40-bipy ligands within a 2D network. If the central carbon atom linked to two CF3 groups and two ben- zene spacers of each hfipbb2- ligand is considered as one of four corners of a cuboid and the Zn(II) binuclear units occupy the other four corner sites of the cuboid, then large quasi-cuboid cavities can be envisaged (Figure 3b). However, these layers are tightly stacked in an 3 3 3 ABAB 3 3 3 fashion along the crystallographic c axis. Furthermore, CF3 groups from adjacent layers are embedded into the quasi-cuboid cavities of a layer at both sides of the layer, resulting in no overall porosity for 2 (Figure 3c and 3d). The PLATON/SOLV30 calcula- tion shows no effective void volume (only 0.7% of the unit cell volume), and hydrogen bonds between layers further lead to a tightly packed structure Ow-H 3 3 3 Ocarboxylate [H 3 3 3 O = 1.828(11)-2.241(16) A˚ , O 3 3 O = 2.668(3)- 3.014(3) A˚ ] and weak C-H 3 3 3 F [H 3 3 3 F = 2.46 A˚ , C 3 3 3 F = 3.405(4) A˚ ] or C-H 3 3 3 Ocarboxylate [H 3 3 3 O = 2.54 A˚ , C 3 3 3 O = 3.468(4) A˚ ]. Structure of [Zn2(hfipbb)2(bpdab)] 3 2DMF (3). Com- plex 3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pca21, and the Zn(II) local coordination geometry is similar to that in 1 with pairs of Zn(II) centers forming a binuclear Zn(II)-tetracarboxylate paddlewheel cluster node (cf., Figure 1b). These are bridged by hfipbb2- ligands into a (4,4) helical layer with large rhombic pores, and in contrast to 1, the two axial sites of each paddle- wheel unit in 3 are occupied by N-donors from bpdab pillars (Figure 4a). As expected, the helical layer is identical to that of 1, and two identical helical layers are interpenetrated in a parallel 2Df2D fashion. Upon 2-fold parallel interpenetration, 1D double helical chan- nels (A) in the skeleton are formed (Supporting Infor- mation, Figure S3b). However in 3, adjacent layers are pillared by 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene (bpdab) ligands to generate a 3D network (Figure 4b) of R-Po topology with additional interlamellar 1D channels (B) (Figure 4c). Thus the interpenetrating helical layers have been successfully extended by pillars to form tar- geted 3D frameworks with the effective void volume30 drastically increasing from 12.4% (for 1) to 30.8% (for 3) of the crystal volume. Disordered DMF molecules in the channels A and B (Figure 4c) are anchored to the host framework via weak C-H 3 3 3 ODMF hydrogen bonds (H 3 3 3 O = 2.30-2.52 A˚ , C 3 3 3 O = 3.215(11)-3.370(10) A˚ , and <CHO = 162-170). Structure of [Cd2(hfipbb)2(DMF)2] 3 2DMF (4). Com- plex 4 crystallizes in monoclinic space group P21/c, and the asymmetric unit consists of two Cd(II) ions, two hfipbb2- dianions, two coordinated DMF molecules, and two lattice DMF molecules (Figure 5a). The two crystallographically independent Cd(II) centers have dif- ferent coordination geometries: Cd1 is coordinated by five carboxylate oxygens from four hfipbb2- ligands forming a distorted square pyramid, while the Cd2 center is octahedrally coordinated by four carboxylate oxygens in the equatorial plane [Cd-O = 2.193(4)- 2.533(3) A˚ ] and by the O-donors from two DMF Figure 3.

In 4, the hfipbb2- ligands present two different coordination modes: bridging tetradentate and bridging chelated tetradentate (Scheme 2a and 2b, re- spectively). Consequently, the Cd1 3 3 3 Cd2 pair is con- nected through two carboxylate groups to form corner- sharing binuclear building blocks, which are interlinked via μ2-mode carboxylate groups to form a [Cd2(CO2)4]n chain (Figure 5b). Linkages between chains via (hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzene) spacers afford layers parallel to the crystallographic ab plane. Because of the geometry of hfipbb2- ligands, double helical tubular channels running along the b axis are formed within the layer with CF3 groups on their periphery (Figure 5c), with accessible windows that can accommo- date a sphere of diameter ∼5.2 A˚ . The 1D intralamellar channels of 4 are similar to those found in the In(III) material [In(OH)(hfipbb)] 3 0.5py, which consists of {In(OH)}n chains linked together by hfipbb2- ligands.23e The double helical tubular channels inside each layer can alternatively be described as follows. Two crystal- lographically independent hfipbb2- ligands (defined as L1 and L2, respectively, in Figure 6) are used to construct right-handed helical chains via coordination bonds be- tween five-coordinated Cd(II) centers (Cd1) and L1 or L2. As shown in Figure 6a, two helical chains are inter- twined with a period equal to the unit cell parameter b [15.990(2) A˚ ] to form a double-stranded helical tube running along a 21 screw axis. The tubes are further aligned by sharing five-coordinated Cd1 centers to form a layered network with small pores. Each pore is defined by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from four hfipbb2- ligands (Figure 6, panels b and c), and binds Cd2, which has an octahedral coordination geometry completed Figure 4.

The coordinated DMF molecules are nearly perpendicu- lar to the layers, pointing into the interlamellar regions, revealing that the orientation of DMF is similar to that of the coordinated pyridine molecules in 1. However, DMF molecules are smaller and more flexible than pyridine molecules and thus additional voids are created between the undulating layers. A PLATON/SOLV30 calculation gives a value of 26.8% for the void space in the unit cell, and slightly more than half of this space is attributed to the 1D intralamellar tubular channels. Disordered DMF molecules situated in the intralamellar and inter- lamellar voids are bound to the host framework via weak Caromatic-H 3 3 3 ODMF or CDMF-H 3 3 3 Ocarboxylate hydrogen bonds (C 3 3 3 O = 3.12-3.41 A˚ ; <CHO = 137-157).

Single-crys- tal X-ray analysis reveals that the Co(II) ion in 5 has a slightly distorted octahedral coordination geometry, pro- vided by three hfipbb2- and two dpp ligands [Co-O = 2.0325(18)-2.1828(19) A˚ ; Co-N=2.122(2)-2.165(2) A˚ ]. As shown in Figure 7b, each pair of Co(II) ions is bridged by a pair of syn-syn hfipbb2- carboxylate groups to form a binuclear subunit, and these are doubly interlinked by the hfipbb2- ligands into an infinite ribbon, which is similar to that observed for 2. However, only one co- ordination mode (Scheme 2d) is observed for the hfipbb2- ligands in 5. In principle, dpp ligands can exhibit two con- formations, trans-trans (TT) and trans-gauche (TG), with respect to the relative orientations of CH2 groups.29g The two pyridyl nitrogens coordinated to each Co(II) ion in 5 are in syn positions [<N1-Co1-N2#3 = 92.74(8)o, #3 = (x, 1 þ y, z)], and consequently, the dpp ligands in 5 only adopt the trans-trans (TT) conformation, and serve as double-bridges connecting [Zn(hfipbb)]n ribbons into a 2D (4,4) non-interpenetrating layer with two kinds of windows when viewed along the crystallographic a axis (Figure 7c). Window A is made up of two binuclear subunits and two hfipbb2- ligands along the ribbon (shortest diagonal Zn 3 3 3 Zn distance = 12.49 A˚ ), while window B consists of two binuclear subunits and two dpp ligands perpendicular to ribbon chains (shortest diagonal Zn 3 3 3 Zn distance=10.26 A˚ ). These layers stack in such a way that lattice methanol molecules are anchored on either side of window B via strong Omethanol-H 3 3 3 O hydrogen bonds [H 3 3 3 O=1.89 A˚ , O 3 3 3 O = 2.767(3) A˚ and <OHO =172]. Structural Discussion. We have synthesized five co- ordination polymers 1-5, as illustrated in Scheme 1, that form 2D or 3D frameworks with diverse architec- tures. In complexes 1-5, pairs of metal ions are bridged by carboxylate groups to form bimetallic clusters nodes which play an important role in determining the resulting network structure. A total of four different coordination modes of carboxylate groups are observed in 1-5 (Scheme 3). In the μ2 b-OCO coordination mode, both carboxylate oxygen atoms are involved in coordina- tion to two M(II) atoms in a monodentate fashion; in the second coordination mode (μ1 c-OCO), both oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group are involved, but in this case only coordinated to one metal atom in an asymmetric chelating bidentate manner; in the third Figure 6.

The combination of the hfipbb2- spacer and these carboxylate coordination modes can produce 10 possible bridging modes of hfipbb2- ligands (Supporting Information, Scheme S1),6f,23,29g four of which are observed in com- pounds 1-5. The bridging tetradentate mode of hfipbb2- (Scheme 2a) results in the formation of bimetallic tetra- carboxylate paddlewheel clusters, as shown in 1 and 3 and other previously reported compounds.,6f,23g,23f,29g where the apical positions of the paddlewheel units can be either occupied by terminal ligands (e.g., py in 1 and in [Co- (hfipbb)(py)]29g) or neutral bridging pillars (e.g., bpdab in 3 and H2hfipbb in ([Cu(hfipbb)(H2hfipbb)0.5]6f). The hfipbb2- ligands in 2 exhibit two different bridging modes (Scheme 2c and 2d) and link binuclear Zn(II) units to form [Zn(hfipbb)]n ribbon-like chains, while the py moi- eties of 4,40-bipy are coordinated to the Zn-carboxylate units in a trans fashion, resulting in a (4,4) network based on a binuclear cluster node, double-stranded hfipbb2- linkers and single-stranded 4,40-bipy linkers. Although 5 contains a similar ribbon-like chain to that of 2, the hfipbb2- ligands in 5 only take the bridging chelated tridentate mode (Scheme 2d), and, thus, the py moieties of dpp occupy two cis positions to fulfill the pseudo- octahedral coordination at each Co(II) center. The re- sultant structure is a non-interpenetrated (4,4) network based on binuclear cluster nodes and double-stranded organic linkers (Figure 7c). The Cd(II) complex 4 is the only compound described here where two distinct brid- ging modes of hfipbb2- are exploited to generate the layer structure, with no additional bipyridyl spacers used. Thus, Cd(II) centers with different coordination geome- tries are linked by both μ2-η2:η1-OCO and μ2 b-OCO groups into [Cd2(O2C)4]n chains that are further linked via hfipbb2- spacers to form a 2D network with tubular helical channels inside the layer. Thermal Stability, XRD Analysis, and H2 Adsorption. Because of the very low porosity of 1, 2, and 5, as confirmed by single-crystal diffraction analysis, only 3 and 4 were studied for porosity and gas adsorption. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) of 3 and 4 were studied under N2 flow (60 mL/min) at a heating rate of 1 C min-1. As shown in Figure 8a (curve I), all the DMF in 3 is removed (weight loss, 16.4%, calcd 16.3%) by 250 C. The desolvated form 3a is stable up to ∼360 C and then decomposes to an unidentified product. The thermal stability of 4 is similar, with the weight loss of 20.3% completed at around 250 C (curve IV in Figure 8a), corresponding to the loss of all the guest and coordi- nated DMF (calcd 22.5%). The weight loss beginning at ∼350 C corresponds to the decomposition of the framework. Figure 7. (a) View of the metal coordination environment in 5.

Scheme 3. Summary of Coordination Modes of Carboxylate Groups Observed in 1-5 Article Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 23, 2009 11077 The purity and thermal stability of 3 and desolvated 3a were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis(Figure8b). ThePXRD patterns for the evacuated sample obtained by heating 3 at 260 C under N2 flow for 6 h to give 3a is similar to that of the as-synthesized crystalline solid, suggesting that the guest-free phase of 3 remains intact on desolvation. After removal of DMF, the host crystals were soaked in DMF and again subjected to TGA. The results revealed the loss of DMF is completed at the same temperature (250 C). However, the quantity of DMF in the channels is 6.9 or 5.2% less (see curves III and II in Figure 8a) following 6 or 24 h immersion in DMF, respectively, compared to the as-prepared crystals. This indicates a reversible but gradual process of reintroducing DMF into the framework pores.19a Although we could not determine the single crystal structure after the reintroduc- tion of DMF, its PXRD pattern (see III in Figure 8b) is identical to that of the as-prepared crystals of 3 (pattern II in Figure 8b). A sample of 4 was heated to 125 C under vacuum for 3 h to remove lattice DMF molecules. The partly desol- vated phase [Cd2(hfipbb)2(DMF)2] shows a similar PXRD pattern to the one simulated from single-crystal diffraction of 4 (Figure 8c). However, after removal of coordinated DMF at 250 C, the PXRD pattern changes slightly with a systematic shift to higher 2θ (lower d-spacing) values indicating a compaction of the stacked layers in the structure. The PXRD patterns, however, retain sharp reflections and return to the original on reintroduction of DMF, indicating that the fully desolvated form remains crystalline and micropo- rous (see below); such microporosity can be attributed to the retention microtubes inside the layers after desolva- tion. To evaluate further the microporosity of these materials, the adsorption of N2, CO2, and H2 were investigated for the desolvated (guest-free) forms of 3 and 4 (i.e., 3a and 4a, respectively).As shown in Figure9a, the CO2 adsorption of 3a and 4a at 195 K exhibits a reversible type-I isotherm characteristic of microporous material. The uptake of CO2 for 3a and 4a at 1 bar corresponds to 2.67 mmol g-1 (or 60 cm3 g-1) and 1.83 mmol g-1 (or 41 cm3 g-1), respec- tively, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET; Lang- muir) surface areas for 3a and 4a were calculated to be 201(305) and 125(224) m2 g-1, respectively. However, the adsorption isothermfor 3a and 4arevealedvery low uptake of N2 (77 K) (Figure 9a). The selectivity of CO2 over N2 may be due to size exclusion (kinetic diameter: 3.3 A˚ for CO2vs3.64 A˚ forN2)1pandthelow kinetic energy of theN2 molecules at 77 K resulting in N2 molecules unable to effectively enter small pores. The isotherms for H2 adsorption/desorption were ob- tained at 77 K using an IGA analyzer according to previously described procedures.6g,h As shown in Figure 9b, 3a reversibly adsorbs and desorbs H2 at 77 Figure 8.

The H2 uptake at 20 bar is 0.78 wt %, which is comparable to the values found for some carbon materials.31 The Langmuir linear fitting of the H2 adsorption data affords a max- imum uptake of 0.87 wt %. The adsorbed H2 density at 20 bar is 0.0326 g/cm3, with respect to the solvent- accessible volume calculated from single-crystal data, notably lower than those observed for other 3D layer- pillared framework materials with R-Po topology (Supporting Information, Table S2).6c,f,16,19a,22a-d,23f,32 Sorption studies show the activated 4a can adsorb 0.23 wt % H2 at 77 K and 1 bar, increasing to 0.57 wt % H2 at 20 bar (Figure 9b). These uptakes are com- parable or superior to those observed for layered co- ordination frameworks under similar conditions.23f,33 The absence of an absorption plateau before 20 bar shows further uptake can be expected at higher pressure. If H2 molecules are considered to be stored in both intralamellar tubular channels and interlamellar voids (total free volume 26.3%), then the adsorbed H2 density at 20 bar is half of the density of liquid H2 (0.0708 g cm-3).34 Conclusions A new series of coordination polymers of different divalent metal cations [Zn(II), Cd(II) and Co(II)] have been as- sembled from the bent hfipbb2- ligand under solvothermal conditions in the presence of auxiliary co-ligands. Complex 1 contains 2-fold 2Df2D parallel interpenetrated layers with binuclear Zn(II)-tetracarboxylate paddlewheel motifs as pla- nar nodes and 1D double helical channels. In 3, parallel interpenetrating helical layers composed of Zn(II)-tetracar- boxylate paddlewheels and hfipbb2- ligands are success- fully extended by 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene (bpdab) pillars into a 3D R-Po microporous framework. However, the use of shorter 4,40-bipyridine (4,40-bipy) or 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane (dpp) as auxiliary ligands afforded 2D layered compounds 2 and 5, both consisting of metal- hfipbb2- ribbon-like chains connected together through bipyridyl ligands. Furthermore, the different bridging modes of hfipbb2- ligands in 2 and 5 lead to different dispositions of the coordinated co-ligands around metal ions, giving as final products two significantly different (4,4) networks. The Cd- (II) complex 4 represents a rare example in which metal centers are linked by carboxylate groups into infinite chains further joined together by double-stranded hfipbb2- linkers to form a 2D network with tubular helical channels. For the layered coordination polymers (1, 2, 4, and 5) low accessible volumes (less than 27% of unit cell volume) were observed, because of close-packing of 2D layers or because of interpenetration of layers. Generally, these layered compounds show low thermal stability even under ambient conditions (e.g., 5), but in the case of 4 which features tubular channels inside the layer, enhanced thermal stability of the guest- free framework is observed and its guest-free phase reversibly adsorbs and releases hydrogen at 77 K. The uptake of hydrogen at 20 bar is 0.57 wt %, among the highest values reported for layered frameworks. According to TGA, PXRD, and hydrogen adsorption studies, both 3 and 4 retain structuralintegrityand permanent microporosityupon evacua- tion of guest molecules although their overall porosity is relatively low.

[f] hydrogen absorbed at 298 K. Activation was carried out by heating 4 at 200oC under ultrahigh vacuum overnight. The weight loss during activation showed that all DMF molecules in pores and coordinated to Cd atoms are removed to giving the fully-desolvated framework 4a. There are few reports on hydrogen adsorption on layered coordination polymers. All the above materials in Table S3 have a layered structure with low porosity. Table S3.
