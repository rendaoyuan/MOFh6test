When the dicarboxylate is changed diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) from ndc to biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate (bpdc), the reaction furnished a completely diﬀerent 3-fold interpenetrating three-dimensional coordination polymer [Zn3(bpdc)3(bpeb)]·0.5DMSO·1.5H2O having a uninodal eight connected network structure with hexagonal bipyramidal SBUs. C rystal engineering of coordination polymers has now reached a stage where the design component has fairly matured and the main focus of interest is slowly shifting from design stra- tegies to exploration and understanding the structure−function− property relationships.1,2 In other words, by choosing appro- priate metal ions or metal clusters and spacer ligands, the con- nectivity, topology, cavities, channels, interpenetration as well as bringing reactive functional groups close together in the lattice can be in principle controlled in the coordination net- work structures.1 However, in the crystallization process, the kinetic factors still inﬂuence and dominate the outcome of the connectivity and topology of the coordination polymers. The crystals have the normal tendency to maximize their packing density. As a result, the voids are usually ﬁlled by guest solvent molecules, uncoordinated ligand molecules or counter- ions, or interpenetration occurs.3 This is a common phenom- ena observed in the porous coordination polymers (PCPs) or metal−organic frameworks (MOFs).1 When the length of the linear spacer is increased, the three-dimensional (3D) co- ordination polymers tend to interpenetrate, and if the structure is already interpenetrated, the degree of interpenetration usually increases with the length of the spacer ligand.4 In their pioneering work, Robson and Batten classiﬁed a number of diﬀerent types of interpenetrations that occur in coordina- tion polymers.5 We have been interested in the longer spacer ligand 1,4- bis[2-(4-pyridyl)ethenyl]benzene (bpeb) as it contains a pair of CC bonds that can be potentially used for [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions, and the distance between the two nitrogen atoms ca. 16 Å is suitable for making MOFs. This ligand has already been extensively used by Lang and co-workers as well as others to synthesize a number of interesting coordination polymers.6−10 During investigations, we observed two diﬀerent types of Received: May 3, 2012 Revised: June 4, 2012 Published: June 7, 2012 Figure 1.

Growth Des. 2012, 12, 3397−3401 interpenetrations in diﬀerent parts of the 3-fold interpenetrated pillared-layer [Zn2(ndc)2(bpeb)]·DMF·3H2O (where ndc = 2,6- naphthalenedicarboxylate) structure α-Po (also called NaCl, ReO3 or pcu) topology. On the other hand, under similar reac- tion conditions [Zn3(bpdc)3(bpeb)]·0.5DMSO·1.5H2O (where bpdc = biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) furnished a completely diﬀerent structure based on an eight connected network structure containing hexagonal bipyramidal secondary building units (SBUs) and trigonal prismatic nodes. The details of our investi- gations are described in this paper. The yellow block-shaped crystals of [Zn2(ndc)2- (bpeb)]·DMF·3H2O (1) were obtained from the solvothermal reaction between Zn(NO3)2, ndc, and bpeb in 1:1:1 molar ratio at 110 °C.11 The compound crystallized in the space group P1̅ and the asymmetric unit consists of a [Zn2(ndc)2(bpeb)] and a disordered DMF and three disordered water molecules.12 The SBU is made up of a well-known paddle-wheel structure com- prising a Zn2(O2C−)4 unit (Figure 1a), and the connectivity extends to form a (4,4) layer structure in the ab plane (Figure 1b). The Zn···Zn distances (13.073 and 13.083 Å which are the lengths of a and b of the unit cell) and Zn−Zn−Zn angles (84.2 and 95.8°) indicate a slightly distorted square arrangement. In each square-pyramidal ZnO4N core, the apical position is occupied by an N atom of bpeb ligand. The connectivity of these bpeb ligands in the c-direction furnished a highly distorted pillared-layer 3D structure with α-Po topology (Figure 2a). The distance between the centers of the paddle- wheel units along the bpeb pillar is 22.846 Å. The Zn(bpeb) chains are highly corrugated which can understood from the deviation of the linearity of the N1−Zn1−Zn2 and Zn1−Zn2− N2 angles, 173.0 and 172.9°. Further, the Zn1 and Zn2 atoms are away from the planes of pyridyl rings they were bonded to by 0.29 and 0.21 Å, respectively. In other words, bpeb−Zn− Zn−bpeb looks like a bow (with an angle of 17.2°) which extends along the c-direction to form a wavy conformation. As a consequence, interweaving occurs. Three wavy bpeb ligands from the adjacent cubes interweave over the ndc ligands along the a-axis to form fabriclike sheets in the ac plane (Figure 2b) leading to a triply interpenetrated structure (Figure 2c). Such interweaving has been observed only in two-dimensional (2D) structures with highly corrugated and ﬂexible spacer ligands.5 Here the behavior of the linear spacer ligand bpeb is quite unusual. To the best of our knowledge such interweaved 3-fold interpenetration has not been observed in the well-known uninodal α-Po topology.1d,5a The Schläﬂi symbol for 1 has been Figure 2.

Despite interpenetration the total potential solvent area volume is 849.1 Å3 (34.5% per unit cell volume), as calculated by PLATON.13 In order to understand the generality of the formation of un- usual interweaving with the longer spacer ligand bpeb, another synthesis was carried out under similar experimental conditions Figure 4.

Growth Des. 2012, 12, 3397−3401 3399 but with a more linear dicarboxylate, bpdc instead of ndc. Block-shaped yellow single crystals were obtained in 54% yield.14 X-ray crystallographic analysis15 revealed that the asymmetric unit consists of half of the formula in [Zn3(bpdc)3(bpeb)], and the crystallographic inversion center at Zn2 generates the SBU. In the Zn3(bpdc)3 unit, the three zinc(II) atoms are arranged in a linear fashion and three carboxylate ligands bridge each Zn2 pair such that the central Zn2 has a distorted octahedral geometry with a ZnO6 core as shown in Figure 3a. Each “terminal” Zn1 atom in the linear trinuclear complex has the tetrahedral geometry and bonded to three oxygen atoms, O1, O5, and O3A (symmetry operator: A = 1/2 + x, 1/2 −y, 1/2 −z) from three bpdc ligands. In this description the weak interaction of Zn1 with O6 (2.69 Å) is not considered. The two pyramidal-shaped ZnO3 cores at in the Zn3 rod are staggered but facing each other as shown in Figure 3a. As a result they interdigitate and the Zn3(O2C-R)6 core has highly distorted D3d point group symmetry. The other end of the six carboxylates of the bpdc ligands in the Zn3(bpdc)3 unit are connected to six diﬀerent Zn(II) atoms occupying approximately the corners of a regular hexagon in the [101] plane. This connectivity from the six connecting Zn3(O2C-R)6 units provides a layer structure made up of (3,3) triangular grids as shown in Figure 3b. In the [Zn3(O2C-R)6(py)2] SBU, the tetrahedral geometry of each Zn1 is completed by an N atom of the bpeb ligand. The two bpeb ligands in the [Zn3(bpdc)3(bpeb)] cluster make this an eight-connector node with hexagonal bipyramidal geometry. To the best of our knowledge, such an SBU seems to be very rare. This leads to the formation of trigonal prismatic pillared- layer network structure (Figure 4) with Schläﬂi symbol {36.418.53.6}. The Zn2···Zn2 distances in the Zn3 triangle are 14.36, 14.36, and 14.52 Å, while Zn2···Zn2 distance along the bpeb pillar is 26.946 Å and as the consequence these structures are triply interpenetrated as shown in Figure 4c. Despite interpenetration, the overall structure has some voids and the total potential solvent area volume was found to be 802.7 Å3 (25.2% per unit cell volume), as determined from PLATON.13 A quick look at the conformation of the Zn-bpeb polymer chain in 2 revealed that it does not have wavy conformation as in 1 and behaves like any other bpeb spacer ligands reported in the literature so far.6−10 To summarize, a pyridyl-based long linear spacer bpeb forms a unique interweaved 3-fold interpenetrated pillared-layer struc- ture having the well-known pcu topology. Although a number of 3D coordination polymeric structures with pcu network topology have been observed with a control on the inter- penetration, interweaving has not been observed to the best of our knowledge. When the slightly bulkier dicarboxylate ndc has been replaced by a longer spacer ligand bpdc, a completely diﬀerent 3D network with a rare trigonal prismatic structure made from an eight-connected SBU has been obtained. It appears that this unusual interpenetrating structure could be synthesized only from the unique combination of ndc and bpeb ligands, probably dictated by the kinetic factors. We are cur- rently investigating various experimental conditions to produce supramolecular isomers of 1 to investigate their gas storage behavior. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information TGA curves, XRPD patterns, crystal structures, and X-ray crystallographic information ﬁles (CIF) for 1 and 2.

The bpep ligand was synthesized by the reported procedure.1 Elemental analyses were carried out on a LECO CHNS-932 elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric analyses were recorded in a TA Instruments TGA-Q50 thermogravimetric analyzer. Samples were heated at a constant rate of 5 °C min-1 from room temperature to 900 °C and at a continuous flow nitrogen atmosphere. ESI-MS spectra were recorded in positive ion mode from acetonitrile solution with Thermo Scientific LCQ Fleet spectrometer.

X-ray Crystallography: Single Crystals suitable for data collection were chosen under an optical microscope, mounted on glass fibre, and frozen under a stream of cryogenic nitrogen gas before data collection. Intensity data were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX II ULTRA diffractometer attached with a CCD detector and graphite-monochromated MoK (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation. Empirical absorption corrections were applied with the data using the program SADABS and the crystallographic package SHELXTL were used for all calculations. In 1, there is no disorder in the main structure but the solvents were disordered. The asymmetric unit contains one DMF and three water molecules which were found in two different regions. In one regions DMF was disordered and the positional and isotropic thermal parameters of two disordered models with occupancies 0.5 and 0.25 were refined in the least-squares cycles. In the second region, the electron densities were resolved into 0.5DMF and 11 disordered oxygen atoms from three water molecules. No hydrogen atoms were added to these water molecules. In 2, the cavity was occupied half DMSO and 1.5 water molecules. The anisotropic thermal parameters of all the non-hydrogen atoms of DMSO were refined but no hydrogen atoms were added. Five disordered oxygen atoms (1x0.5 + 4x0.25) were included in the model. The positional and anisotropic thermal parameters were refined for 0.5 oxygen atom and the rest assigned isotropic thermal parameters. S3 Figure S1. Thermogravimetry curve for 1. Figure S2.
