Through the comprehensive analysis of structure, host-guest properties, and spin-crossover behaviors, it is found that this pillared Hofmann system uniquely displays both guest- exchange-induced changes to spin-crossover and spin-crossover-induced changes to host-guest properties, with direct dynamic interplay between these two phenomena. Guest desorption and adsorption cause pronounced changes to the spin-crossover behavior according to a systematic trend in which larger guests stabilize the high-spin state and therefore depress the spin-crossover temperature of the host lattice. When stabilizing the alternate spin state of the host at any given temperature, these processes directly stimulate the spin-crossover process, providing a chemisensing function. Exploitation of the bistability of the host allows the modiﬁcation of adsorption properties at a ﬁxed temperature through control of the host spin state, with each state shown to display differing chemical afﬁnities to guest sorption. Guest desorption then adsorption, and vice versa, can be used to switch between spin states in the bistable temperature region, adding a guest-dependent memory effect to this system. Introduction The achievement over the past decade of robust nanoporosity in molecular materials, most commonly in host lattices with coordination bond linkages (i.e., metal-organic frameworks; MOFs), has seen the discovery of a range of remarkable host-guest properties and led to strong interest in the application of such materials in gas storage, molecular separations and sensing, and catalysis.1,2 A direct consequence of the consider- able versatility of the molecular approach over that of more conventional porous solids is the high capacity for rational materials design, not just of framework and pore structure but of speciﬁc incorporated functions, be they sorptive, catalytic, electronic, magnetic, optical, or thermomechanical in nature. Such versatility has seen the recent targeting of systems that display some form of electronic and magnetic function,2 which notably includes the incorporation of the spin-crossover (SCO) phenomenon3 to yield the ﬁrst switchable porous lattices.4-8 This coupling within one material of spin switching and reversible guest exchange has provided a new, highly convenient mechanism for perturbing the structure and therefore electronic/ magnetic properties of the host material, opening up a powerful new approach for the investigation of structure-property relationships in SCO systems. Moreover, differences in mac- roscopic properties such as magnetic moment, color, and crystal † The University of Sydney. ‡ Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory. § X-ray Science Division, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. | Monash University. ⊥Universite´ Bordeaux I.

SOC. 2009, 131, 10998–11009 dimensions between the different spin states have raised questions of whether guest-induced SCO could be used as a mechanism for molecular sensing. Conversely, there has been speculation that novel host-guest properties might be achieved in these materials, either in cases where guest exchange induces SCO or where external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, magnetic ﬁeld, or light irradiation could be used to switch the host lattice and allow consequent external manipulation of host-guest processes.5 The most extensive class of porous SCO materials yet investigated are a family of spin-crossover frameworks (SCOFs) constructed through the linkage of FeII(py)4(NCS)2 nodes by a range of bis-pyridyl ligands.4,6,7,9 The desorption/adsorption of guest molecules into the 1-D channels of these materials has yielded a number of interesting observations, most notably the variation of SCO temperature induced by guest-exchange and the intricate complexities associated with structural transforma- tions and their inﬂuence on SCO behavior.6,7 To date, the tuning of ligand ﬁelds in these systems to favor SCO at ambient conditions has been elusive, meaning that the guest sorption chemistry and spin-switching principally occur in different temperature regimes and have therefore yet to be achieved simultaneously; as such, no investigations of various possible interplay between these two processes have been reported. A further highly notable family of SCOFs is that containing FeII(N(cyanometallate))4(py)2 nodes,10-13 some members of which display SCO at ambient temperature and pressure. Comparatively less attention has been paid to the potential host-guest aspects of these systems, with notable exceptions including the observed topochemical conversions of [FeII(pmd) (OH2)(MI(CN)2)2]·H2O (pmd ) pyrimidine; M ) Ag, Au)13 and [Fe(3-CNpy)2(CH3OH)2/3(Au(CN)2)2]14 following the ther- mal desorption of bound water and methanol guests, and the demonstration that desorption of unbound water from the pillared Hofmann system [FeII(pz)PtII(CN)4]·x(H2O)11 yields an increase in SCO temperature and hysteresis.15,16 The latter material, which is a member of a series that also incorporates NiII and PdII analogues,11,17,18 is of particular interest in displaying hysteretic SCO near room temperature and in being a likely candidate for reversible guest desorption/adsorption, given the recent report of permanent porosity in its isostructural NiII-NiII analogue.19 This SCO pillared Hofmann family has previously been the subject of considerable interest for its ambient-temperature photophysical properties15 and for the formation of SCO nanoparticles16,20,21 and thin ﬁlms.22 Here we show through a comprehensive guest-dependent investiga- tion that the NiII analogue within this series, [FeII(pz) NiII(CN)4]·xGuest (1·xGuest; where Guest ) N2, O2, CO2, methanol (Me), ethanol (Et), acetone (Ac), acetonitrile (Acn), and toluene (Tol)), displays a range of remarkable and unique physicochemical materials properties, with synergistic interplay between SCO and guest-exchange leading to both guest-induced SCO and SCO-induced guest-exchange properties. Experimental Section Synthesis. Crystals of 1·2H2O were obtained by the slow diffusion of stoichiometric ethanol/water (50/50) solutions of iron(II) perchlorate hydrate (21.3 mg, 0.05 mmol) and potassium tetracy- anonickelate(II) and pyrazine (12.9 mg, 0.05 mmol and 4.0 mg, 0.05 mmol, respectively). Dichroic red-yellow crystals were obtained after a period of several months. Bulk samples were synthesized by fast mixing of stoichiometric amounts (8 × 10-3 M) of the three reactants in ethanol/water (50/50) and stirring for 1 day at room temperature. Fine orange-yellow powders were obtained. Elemental analysis of bulk sample (FeNiC8H8N6O2): found C 28.74, N 24.63, H 2.17; calcd C 28.71, N 25.11, H 2.41. IR (cm-1, at room temperature): 3607s, 2145s, 1616m, 1417s, 1158m, 1130m, 1085m, 1053s, 1031m, 805s, 476m, 442s. Raman (cm-1, at room temperature): 2182s, 2170s, 1605m, 1232m, 1029s, 700w, 645w, 484w, 319w, 300w, 173w. The purity of bulk samples for physical measurements was conﬁrmed by PXRD. Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements. Magnetic susceptibility measurements were made in the temperature range 4-300 K using a Quantum Design MPMS 5 SQUID instrument operating under a ﬁeld of 1 T. All data reported were obtained on microcrystalline samples isolated, initially, as 1·2H2O. The desorbed analogue 1 was obtained by heating a sample of 1·2H2O under a vacuum at 80 °C for 21 h. The guest-sorbed phases 1·xGuest were obtained by adding a few drops of the appropriate solvent to 1 and letting the sample sit for approximately 12 h before the measurement was made. All samples were sealed under solvent in quartz tubes and were not ground at any stage. The comparatively low MTLS values achieved are consistent with high sample quality and purity, with only a small high-spin contribution coming from crystallite surface and defect (e.g., pz vacancy) effects. The spin-crossover temper- atures T1/2v and T1/2V were determined as the temperatures of 50% spin-state conversion upon warming and cooling, respectively. (9) Real, J. A.; Andres, E.; Mun˜oz, M.

Data were col- lected for the crystal structures on a Bruker-Nonius FR591 Kappa APEX II diffractometer (Mo KR radiation λ ) 0.71073 Å) equipped with an Oxford Cryosystems cryostat. Data for 1 were collected on a crystal that was dehydrated in situ in an open-ended capillary with heating under a ﬂow of dry dinitrogen. Empirical absorption corrections were applied using the SADABS program.23 Solutions were obtained by direct methods using SHELXS-97 and reﬁned with SHELXL-97.24 Non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotro- pically, and hydrogen atoms were afﬁxed using the riding model.

Diffraction patterns were collected on two beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, 11-BM (λ ) 0.61992 Å) and 1-BM (λ ) 0.61832 Å), using a MAR-3450 imaging plate detector. The sample temperature was controlled using an Oxford Cryosystems cryostat. Raw images were processed using Fit-2D.25 The sample-to-detector distance and tilt of the image plate relative to the beam were reﬁned using a LaB6 standard. For the guest- loaded samples, polycrystalline samples of 1·2H2O were desorbed under vacuum at 80 °C and backﬁlled with dry dinitrogen, and a few drops of solvent were added. The samples were loaded into 0.5 mm glass capillaries with a small layer of solvent and ﬂame- sealed. Data were collected in 20 s exposures with a sample-detector distance of 400 mm. For time-resolved studies, polycrystalline samples of 1·2H2O were ground as a slurry in a small amount of mother liquor, loaded into polyimide capillaries, immediately assembled into a ﬂow cell apparatus,26 and placed under a ﬂowing helium gas atmosphere at 275 K. The samples were maintained under helium gas ﬂow for the duration of the experiment. Diffraction patterns were collected in 5 s exposures at ca. 2 min intervals upon continuous ramping over the ranges 298 to 80 K, 80 to 440 K, 440 to 240 K, and 240 to 360 K, all at 180 K h-1. This corresponds to the collection of diffraction images at 6 K intervals. Lattice parameters were determined from the diffraction patterns by Rietveld reﬁnement.27 The starting model was based on the parameters determined from SCXRD; the tetragonal P4/mmm structural model was assumed initially, and in cases where peak- splitting due to an orthorhombic cell was clear, the Pmmm model was used. No attempt was made to model the disordered guest species, and consequently peak intensities were not ﬁtted accurately in all cases. Thermogravimetry. Measurements were carried out on a TA Instruments Hi-Res TGA 2950 thermogravimetric analyzer to determine the extent and temperature of guest desorption from 1·2H2O and 1·xGuest (Guest ) Ac, Et, Me, Tol, and Acn); samples of the latter were generated by the ex situ immersion of 1 in the relevant pure solvent. The temperature was ramped to 170 °C at 1 °C min-1 to desolvate the materials, which were loaded wet to prevent guest desorption prior to measurement. Gas and Vapor Adsorption. Adsorption isotherms and isobars for 1 were measured using an IGA-002 gravimetric adsorption instrument (Hiden-Isochema, UK). For all isotherms the sample temperature was maintained within (0.1 °C. The standard error for each weight reading was typically 0.25 µg, leading to error bars considerably smaller than the data points shown below in Figures 5a,b, 6, and 8; e.g., for the CO2 isotherms the median error was 0.014% of the absorbed mass. Reproducibility and sample integrity were conﬁrmed by the collection of repeat isotherms and isobars, both on different samples and on samples that had been cycled with multiple guests. CO2 (99.99%) isotherms were measured to 2.5 bar at a range of temperatures between 283 and 318 K, and N2 (99.99%) isotherms were measured to 10 bar at a range of temperatures between 278 and 327 K. At each temperature (except the maximum and minimum temperatures), isotherms were measured once after cooling from the maximum temperature and once after warming from the minimum temperature to explore the inﬂuence of thermal history on spin state and adsorption properties. Enthalpy of adsorption calculations were carried out using the virial method28 with the Clausius-Clapeyron relation on data collected as single series of isotherms and are described fully in the Supporting Information. Gas adsorption isobars were measured for N2 (0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 bar), O2 (0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 bar), and CO2 (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 bar) by maintaining the pressure of the gas in the chamber while increasing the temperature at 0.1 K min-1 from 275 to 313 K and then cooling back to 275 K. The order of pressure measurements was randomized to conﬁrm that sample history did not inﬂuence the pressure-dependent properties. Vapor adsorption isotherms for ethanol, toluene, acetone, and methanol were measured at 30 °C at pressures up to 0.9 of the saturation pressure (P0). At each measured pressure, the sample weight was monitored until the equilibrium mass was achieved. The adsorption isotherm for acetonitrile was not measured due to incompatibility with instrument materials. Adsorption isotherms for N2 (77 K) and Ar (87 K) on 1 were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP2020 volumetric instrument. Raman Spectroscopy. Data were recorded on a Renishaw Raman InVia Reﬂex spectrometer equipped with a 2.2 mW argon ion 514.5 nm laser (Modu-Laser, Centerville, UT) and a Linkam THMS 600 temperature stage. Spectra were collected at ca. 20 K above and below the T1/2v and T1/2V respectively, with sample sealed in 0.5 mm glass capillary tubes under a thin layer of solvent. Optical Reﬂectivity. Data were collected using a custom-built setup that allows reﬂectivity spectra to be collected from 450 to 950 nm in the temperature range 10-300 K. The measurements were performed directly on a thin layer of a polycrystalline sample with a small amount of guest solvent added to avoid desorption. Results Structure and Properties of 1 ·2H2O. The structure adopts the general topology reported previously,11 consisting of 2-D FeNi(CN)4 layers bridged through the six-coordinate Fe(II) centers by bis-unidentate pyrazine bridges (Figure 1). From a non-twinned crystal the material was determined to crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pmmm, rather than in the tetragonal space group P4/m as determined previously from an ab initio structure derived from PXRD data.11 The majority of crystals measured were found to be merohedrally twinned, yielding a and b parameters that represent averaged values within an apparent tetragonal lattice; datasets collected on these crystals yielded excellent structural reﬁnements in P4/mmm with 50:50 occupation of orthogonal pz orientations but were reﬁned instead in Pmmm with a twin relation (Table 1).

Reasonable reﬁnements of both this and the twinned datasets were obtained by constraining the channel composition to be two disordered H2O molecules per formula unit (Figure 1), consistent with our microanalysis and thermogravimetric results and generally consistent with previous reports of this compound.11,17,21 The SCO behavior of 1·2H2O is shown in Figure 2. Corresponding S-PXRD data show the progress of the discon- tinuous transformation between the HS and LS phases, with there being no intermediate phases observed (Figure 3a,b). The temperature dependence of the lattice parameters reﬁned from both S-PXRD and SCXRD data matches the SCO behavior seen in the magnetic data (see Supporting Information). Guest Desorption. With complete guest desorption to yield the apohost 1, there is a symmetry change to a tetragonal cell with a′ ) b′ ≈a and c′ ≈c. SCXRD analysis of this phase (Table 1) reveals that the tetragonal symmetry describes a dynamic rotation of the pyrazine bridges. S-PXRD data collected during desorption of a rapidly synthesized powder sample of 1·2H2O, from which splitting of a and b was unable to be resolved, conﬁrms little change in the reﬁned lattice parameters with guest desorption (see Table 3, below). Careful analysis of the S-PXRD data collected during guest desorption from 1·2H2O to 1 indicates the emergence and disappearance of at least two superstructure phases. The ﬁrst of these involves the emergence of diffuse diffraction peaks at ca. 7.7 and 14.2° (see Supporting Information), consistent with a structural transformation to a tetragonal supercell with a′′ ) a - b, b′′ ) a + b, and c′′ ) c, i.e., giving a′′ ) b′′ ≈2 a and c′′ ≈c. The systematic absences are consistent with a transformation to the space group P4/mbm, which suggests that there is a 90° rotation of alternating pyrazine bridges within the structure (Figure 4b). Such an arrangement seems likely to correspond to a 50% desorbed phase 1·1H2O, in which the two pore water molecules occupying 1D channels in 1·2H2O convert to a situation were one pore water molecule occupies larger pores at the higher temperature. In contrast to the fully solvated orthorhombic phase, in which the pyrazine bridges lie parallel throughout the untwinned structure, as affected by distortion of the rhombic grid layers, no such interlayer correlation is expected for this tetragonal case. This is consistent with the relatively diffuse nature of the superstructure reﬂections, which are expected to exist as rods rather than points in reciprocal space due to the 2-D intralayer order. The SCO transition in 1 is considerably sharper and has wider hysteresis than that of 1·2H2O, as evidenced both by magne- tometry (Figure 2) and S-PXRD (Figure 3c,d). No intermediate phases were observed, and the temperature-dependent lattice parameters reﬁned from the S-PXRD data closely match the SCO behavior observed magnetically (see Supporting Informa- tion). Adsorption of Gases. When gas adsorption isotherms are measured at temperatures in the bistable temperature range (i.e., within the SCO hysteresis loop), the spin state of the host has a substantial effect on the gas isotherms. Figure 5a,b shows CO2 and N2 isotherms measured at 298 K, after either cooling from above 320 K to obtain the HS state or warming from below 280 K to obtain LS. Further isotherms for a range of temper- atures between 278 and 327 K are given in the Supporting Information. From these isotherms, values for the enthalpy of adsorption (∆Hads) were calculated (see Figure 5c,d). For CO2 adsorption, ∆Hads ) 30 kJ/mol at low loading for both the HS and LS states, and for the LS state it increases slightly with increasing loading to be ca. 2 kJ/mol greater than that for HS. In contrast, N2 is adsorbed more favorably into the HS state, with ∆Hads at low loadings of 16 kJ/mol for HS and 14 kJ/mol for LS. In most cases ∆Hads was seen to increase with guest sorption, suggesting that a small degree of framework distortion occurs to optimize the host-guest interactions. The adsorption isobars of N2, O2, and CO2 display remarkable hysteretic behaviors that arise directly from the structural changes associated with SCO (Figure 6); to our knowledge, such behaviors have not been seen previously for porous materials. Superimposed on a general trend of decreased gas adsorption at higher temperatures are hysteretic features arising from abrupt spin switching of the host lattice. For N2 and O2 the adsorption capacity for 1HS is greater than that for 1LS. For CO2 adsorption the effect of spin state on adsorption capacity is pressure dependent; at higher pressures the behavior is similar to N2 and O2, but at lower pressures (<0.5 bar) 1LS has a slightly higher adsorption capacity. The hysteresis loops observed closely match the magnetic SCO behavior, but with some subtle shifts in temperature. The isotherm SCO temperatures Tmv and TmV were deﬁned for each isobar as the temperature corresponding to the maximum rate of mass change during heating and cooling, respectively; these are expected to correlate very closely with, but not necessarily equate exactly to, T1/2 values determined by magnetic measure- ment. Values of Tm are plotted against amount adsorbed in Figure 7. For N2 and O2 adsorption, there is a nearly linear relationship between the hysteretic SCO temperatures and the extent of loading. For 1·xN2, linear ﬁtting of the Tm data gives the relationships Tmv/K ) 294.7 - 13.9x and TmV/K ) 304.7 - 12.3x; for 1·xO2, Tmv/K ) 294.3 - 4.9x and TmV/K ) 304.3 - 2.7x. In contrast, the dependence of Tm values on CO2 loading shows no simple linear trend. The adsorption isotherms for N2 and Ar gas on 1 were also measured at 77 and 87 K, respectively.

Vapor/Liquid Adsorption. The methanol, ethanol, and acetone vapor adsorption isotherms showed fully reversible, abrupt uptake at very low pressure (Figure 8). Maximum uptake into the pores, as measured at 0.8P0 (above this value it is probable that there will be condensation of surface solvent), corresponded to approximately 1.8, 1.5, and 1.2 guest molecules per formula unit for methanol, ethanol, and acetone, respectively. The stoichiometry decreases with increasing molecular size, as expected. These stoichiometries are in fair agreement with those determined by thermogravimetric desorption of 1 exposed to liquid solvent, which gave values of ca. 1.6, 1.5, 1.1, 1.0, and 0.8 for ethanol, methanol, acetone, acetonitrile, and toluene, respectively. Values listed in Table 3 are taken from vapor adsorption except for the value for acetonitrile, which is incompatible with the adsorption equipment. With the exception of toluene vapor (see Supporting Information), each of these guests undergoes very fast adsorption kinetics, with time constants less than 60 s. Toluene adsorption increased steadily to 0.6 toluene molecule per unit cell at 0.8P0, with two regions of slow kinetics suggestive of framework rearrangement most likely associated with rotation of the pz pillars. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were used to probe the spin states and spin changes of 1·xGuest (Figure 9), revealing pronounced guest dependence in the SCO properties, both transition temperatures and hysteresis widths. Table 3 contains the T1/2V (cooling) and T1/2v (warming) values and corresponding hysteresis widths. The Rietveld-reﬁned lattice parameters for the guest-loaded phases are given in Table 3. Interestingly, peak splitting of the 〈hhl〉reﬂections was clearly observed for 1 · 1.5EtLS and 1·1.0AcnLS, indicating the host lattice returns to the parent orthorhombic symmetry rather than retaining the tetragonal symmetry of the apohost. All other patterns were indexed accurately to 2θ angles in tetragonal P4/mmm, suggesting that the pz pillars are aligned perpendicularly or randomly within these phases; we note also that merohedral twinning of an orthorhombic structure may lead to formally tetragonal crys- tallites, and that the data may be of insufﬁcient resolution to distinguish very closely similar a and b. Optical Reﬂectivity. The absorption spectra of 1·xGuest show a reversible conversion between HS (absorption minimum at ca. 670 nm) and LS states (minimum at ca. 800 nm) upon cooling and warming (see Figure 10 for 1·1.2Ac). SCO temperatures derived from these variable-temperature data are in very close agreement with those obtained from the magnetic data (see Supporting Information for data on all phases).

SOC. 9 VOL. 131, NO. 31, 2009 11003 Interplay between Spin-Switching and Host-Guest Function ARTI CLES This structural ordering contrasts with the random alignment of the pyrazine bridges reported previously within tetragonal structures of this phase11 and is likely driven by weak pyrazine-cyanide repulsion and/or framework-guest interac- tions to favor the long-range grid distortion. Due to the lack of communication of pyrazine orientation between interlayers, and to the nearly orthogonal geometry of the rhombic FeNi(CN)4 grids, the structure is highly susceptible to merohedral twinning along the c direction. For rapidly synthesized powder samples, this twinning appears to occur at the nanoscale, as conﬁrmed by the absence of any observable distinction of the a and b axes in S-PXRD patterns and the reﬁnement of ca. 50:50 twin components in the orthorhombic reﬁnement of merohedrally twinned crystals. As such, an interesting feature of this material is that twinned crystallites have a different framework geometry from untwinned, with the rhombic grid layers constrained by crystal strain to be locally orthogonal. Sample inhomogeneity associated with the crystal twinning likely explains the relatively broad SCO transition observed. Notably, we obtained magnetic behavior for this phase similar but not identical to that reported previously,11 with the differ- ences likely due to a different degree of solvation and/or extent of twinning. The discontinuous nature of the SCO transition in 1·2H2O, with the absence of any apparent loss of S-PXRD peak intensity at the transition, indicates that no crystalline intermedi- ates exist and that SCO occurs essentially instantaneously within each crystallite; a previous micro-Raman mapping investigation of this material has suggested that the distribution of HS and LS domains at the transition is submicrometer in scale.32 This situation is in contrast to that seen in the SCOF phases,4,6,7 where gradual shifts in the diffraction reﬂections are observed as the Fe(II) sites cross over continuously rather than simultaneously within each crystallite.4,6,7 We attribute this comparatively rare case of a truly abrupt transition to the fact that partial SCO would induce considerable strain unless occurring in a regular fashion throughout the crystallite (e.g., as a checkerboard arrangement of HS and LS sites; notably, such an effect has (32) Molna´r, G.; Bousseksou, A.; Zwick, A.; McGarvey, J.

As such, any broadening of the transition as observed by other bulk techniques arises from sample inhomogeneity rather than, for example, guest molecule disorder and its local inﬂuence on the Fe(II) environment. The most likely causes of this bulk inhomogeneity are crystallite twinning and variation in guest composition, a point that is supported by the consider- able sharpening of the transition following guest desorption; such an effect demonstrates also that the SCO broadening is not caused by crystal size distribution effects. Guest Desorption. Desorption of water guests from 1·2H2O to yield the apohost 1 results in a transformation to a tetragonal structure in which the pyrazine units are now dynamically disordered over two orthogonal orientations (perpendicular to a or b) and the rhombic FeNi(CN)4 grids formally adopt a square geometry. Powder diffraction data collected upon cooling of 1 show no evidence for a conversion back to the orthorhombic symmetry. These data provide no information on whether short- or long-range ordering of the pz units, either parallel or perpendicular, might occur upon cooling, but given their large separation it seems most likely that these units will freeze into random orientations to retain the formally tetragonal symmetry. In situ S-PXRD measurement with heating shows that the desorption transformation occurs via at least one intermediate. This most notably includes the formation of a proposed (2, 2,1) supercell with partial desorption from 1·2H2O to 1·1H2O, involving the rotation of alternating pyrazine bridges. This results in a change to the pore structure, with the 1-D channels in the b-direction being converted into a 2-D pore architecture in the ab-plane with slightly enlarged pores in the vicinity of the Ni atoms (Figure 11); the width of the windows between the pyrazine units decreases from 4.2 to 2.6 Å in the ab-plane, while the total calculated pore volume34 of 35% is unchanged by the transformation. This proposed intermediate appears to be stabilized principally by the optimization of host-guest H2O· · ·π(pz) interactions with increasing kinetic volume of the guest water molecule, rather than by the formation of edge-to- face pz· · ·pz interactions (calculated CsH· · ·π(pz) distance ) 5.34 Å for perpendicular pz alignment); the latter are expected to be extremely weak, consistent with the absence of this structural modulation in 1 down to 80 K. Notably, the rotation of the pz pillars results in the blockage of the very narrow (1.9 × 1.9 Å2) windows that pass through the alternating holes in the square grid layers; windows of this size have been shown to allow migration of small guests such as H2O.35 The modiﬁcation of the SCO properties upon desorption of 1·2H2O is very similar to that reported for the Pt analogue, [Fe(pz)Pt(CN)4]·xH2O (x ) 0, 2),15 with a ca. 20-30 K increase in transition temperature, a ca. 10 K broadening of the hysteresis loop, and a pronounced sharpening of the transition; these data suggest that some SCO properties previously assigned to 1·2H2O11,32 had inadvertently been measured following a degree of water desorption. We attribute the increase in transition temperature to two factors: an increased ligand ﬁeld strength arising from the conversion to a more regular Fe(II) geometry within the now square FeNi(CN)4 grids of 1, and the stabilization of the LS state through removal of what seem to be unfavorably Table 3.

The sharpening of the SCO transition is likely due principally to the removal of crystallite twinning with conversion to tetragonal symmetry, and possibly also to the removal of sample inho- mogeneity associated with varying guest solvation between different crystallites. Notably, the hysteresis loop of this phase is now centered at ambient conditions, providing a rare example of a SCO material that displays bistability at room temperature. Adsorption of Gases. The robust porous apohost phase 1 readily adsorbs a wide range of small molecular guests. At low temperatures, N2 and Ar saturation are reached at low pressures to yield 1·2N2 and 1·2Ar. Isotherm measurements within the bistable temperature region show that the adsorption properties of 1 depend on its spin state, with 1LS taking up less N2 gas at 298 K than its HS counterpart (Figure 5b). We attribute this novel effect principally to the substantial decrease in pore size and volume from 1HS to 1LS, which arises due to the ca. 0.2 Å contraction in Fe-N bond distances (Table 2). To our knowl- edge, this is the ﬁrst example of a material where the adsorption properties at a ﬁxed temperature can be modiﬁed by exploiting framework bistability, in this case of electronic origin. Remark- ably, this effect is seen also in the adsorption isobars of N2 and O2 (Figure 6), in which the SCO hysteresis is mirrored in the temperature-dependent adsorption behavior. A notable feature of these data is that crossover from 1HS to 1LS leads to the expulsion of guests upon cooling, indicating that the energetics of SCO are sufﬁcient in magnitude to drive this process. While the SCO energetics are sufﬁcient to inﬂuence guest sorption/desorption, it is clear that the converse is also true, with gas adsorption seen to cause subtle changes to the SCO behavior. This is consistent with the comparable energetics of each process, with the adsorption enthalpies of ca. 15-20 kJ mol-1 for N2 and ca. 30 kJ mol-1 for CO2 (see Figure 5c,d) being similar in scale to the SCO energies reported for 1·2H2O (∆HSCO ) 14.5 kJ mol-1, ∆SSCO ) 51 J K-1 mol-1).18 Close examination of the gas isobar data shows that adsorption of the weakly interacting N2 and O2 guests causes a slight suppression of the SCO transition temperature (Figure 7). This behavior is opposite in sign to and greater in magnitude than that expected for the application of external pressure17,36,37 and is perhaps most readily interpreted as being due to an internal pressure effect in which host-guest repulsion slightly disfavors conver- sion from 1HS to 1LS, the latter of which has smaller pores. This conclusion is consistent with the higher enthalpy of N2 phys- isorption for 1HS over that of 1LS. Fitting of the isobar data shows that, for N2 adsorption, the SCO temperatures Tmv and TmV are each suppressed by ca. -13 K per molar N2 uptake, whereas for O2 there is only a ca. -3 K suppression per molar uptake. This trend matches that of the guest width, with O2 having slightly smaller van der Waals radii (2.985 × 2.930 × 4.052 Å3) than N2 (3.054 × 2.991 × 4.046 Å3).30 The inﬂuence of the smaller size of the O2 molecule is also seen in its greater relative uptake into both 1HS and 1LS at comparable pressures and temperatures. We note that interaction of the paramagnetic (presumed triplet state) O2 guests with the HS Fe(II) centers may also serve in some way to inﬂuence energetics of gas adsorption and SCO, although this is expected to be a minor effect at most. Intriguingly, the adsorption of CO2 yields signiﬁcantly more complex behavior than does that of N2 and O2, indicating a more complex inﬂuence of guest sorption on framework structure. First, we note that CO2 adsorption is favored into 1LS at low loadings (<0.5 mol/mol) and into 1HS at high loadings, as is seen both in the crossing-over of the 1LS and 1HS isotherms (Figure 5a) and in the inversion of the hysteretic isobars (Figure 6). This behavior appears to be caused by two competing inﬂuences: a ca. 2 kJ mol-1 higher enthalpy of adsorption for CO2 into 1LS than into 1HS (Figure 5c), and a higher saturation loading of CO2 into 1HS. The latter is due presumably to the greater porosity of the HS phase, and possibly also to its greater framework ﬂexibility, which may be important should some degree of structural rearrangement be required to optimize packing at higher loadings. We speculate that the enthalpically preferred adsorption of CO2 (dimensions 3.339 × 3.189 × 5.361 Å3)30 into 1LS arises with the “sandwiching” of this longer guest between parallel pz units, for which the separation appears more optimal in 1LS (pz· · ·pz separation ) 7.01 Å) than in 1HS (7.27 Å). In addition to this unusual uptake-dependent behavior, a nonlinear inﬂuence of CO2 adsorption on SCO temperature is observed. Unlike N2 and O2, the adsorption of CO2 causes an initial slight increase in Tmv and TmV, likely reﬂecting a stabilization of the LS state by an internal compressive effect associated with the proposed (pz)π· · ·CO2· · ·π(pz) interactions; this is consistent with the higher adsorption enthalpy seen for 1LS. At higher CO2 loadings the downward trend in SCO temperatures, as seen also for N2 and O2, occurs despite the higher adsorption enthalpy into 1LS at these loadings and possibly reﬂects an internal pressure effect as CO2 docks into other regions of the pores. A highly noteworthy aspect of the gas sorption isobars is that the sharpness of the SCO transitions is retained for partial gas loadings, with the deviation in SCO temperature between different loadings being greater than the broadening seen at any given loading. This feature arises naturally from the fact the SCO transition occurs abruptly within single crystallites and, hence, is inﬂuenced by bulk crystallite composition rather than solely by local second coordination sphere effects, with the latter being expected to cause SCO broadening in partially adsorbed crystallites were this not the case.

At ambient temperatures, methanol, ethanol, acetone, acetonitrile, and toluene vapors are readily adsorbed into the host lattice. Guest adsorption causes subtle changes to the framework structure, as evidenced by S-PXRD measurement, with there being evidence in some cases for conversion back to the orthorhombic phase (Table 3); this likely indicates that the pz pillars are able to realign to regenerate the 1-D pore structure of Figure 11a. The adsorption of vapors/solvents into 1 causes signiﬁcantly more pronounced changes to the SCO properties than gases, yielding a remarkable series of behaviors in which the SCO varies within a 100 K range or is “turned off” completely. We attribute this enhanced guest dependence over that of gaseous guests to the greater energetics of adsorption associated with stronger host-guest interactions, which are able to more strongly perturb the energetics of the SCO lattice. Notably, the guest dependence observed is more extreme than that seen to date in the SCOF series,4,6,7 for which comparable guest exchange leads to a ca. 60 K variation in SCO temperature in cases where there is no signiﬁcant lattice distortion. The more pronounced temperature dependence seen for 1·xGuest likely arises due to the smaller pores of this host material, for which SCO leads to greater relative changes in pore dimensions and pore volume. Perhaps more importantly, the 2-D grids of this phase are likely to be highly intolerant to the varying spatial needs of the adsorbed guests on account of their relative inﬂexibility; in contrast, the dipyridyl bridging ligands in SCOF phases have been shown to lengthen upon crossover from HS to LS to partially compensate for the decrease in pore dimensions caused by Fe-N bond length contraction.7 Such pronounced guest dependence, coupled with potential guest selectivity, makes frameworks of this Hofmann type interesting candidates for molecular sensing applications. For the six solvent guests investigated, we see an ap- proximately monotonic relationship between guest dimensions and SCO temperature, with the larger guests leading to a greater suppression of the switching transition (Table 3). This relation- ship provides one of the ﬁrst tangible methods to engineer SCO systems with prescribed properties, a point that is discussed in detail below. As with the weakly interacting gas sorptives, this can be conveniently rationalized as being due to an internal pressure effect in which larger guests stabilize 1HS over 1LS due to their binding being less optimal in the smaller pores of 1LS; as noted previously, evidence for the optimization of host-guest interaction energies is seen in the widening (and shortening) of the 1-D channels in the untwinned 150 K structure of 1·2H2OLS (Figure 1 and Table 1). One interesting exception to this size- dependent trend is the increase of the SCO temperature seen with the sorption of Acn into 1. We speculate that Acn, the narrowest of the large solvent guests (see Table 3), like CO2, may dock most favorably between parallel pz units of the LS structure, thereby stabilizing 1·1.0AcnLS over 1·1.0AcnHS due toaninternalcompressiveeffectarisingfrom(pz)π· · ·Acn· · ·π(pz) interactions that are absent in 1. It is interesting to note that no clear trend exists between SCO temperatures and framework vibrational frequencies (see Supporting Information), with the latter providing some measure of the changes to the Fe(II) ligand ﬁeld with differing guests. This suggests that variation in the ligand ﬁeld splitting at the SCO centers has a comparatively minor inﬂuence on the overall lattice energetics, with the dominant temperature-dependent energy term being crystal packing effects associated with optimization of host-guest interactions. As such, we believe that variation of the second-sphere Fe(II) interactions plays a relatively minor role, and that it is the bulk steric considerations of guest docking that principally determine the SCO temperature. This effect can be rationalized as arising with the decrease in effective kinetic dimensions of the guests with decreasing temperature (an internal pressure effect arising with the de- creased thermal population of anharmonic longitudinal host-guest vibrations), reaching a point at some temperature where pore contraction associated with crossover at the Fe(II) centers becomes favorable due to more optimal guest binding. Interest- ingly, such a guest-size-dependent effect has yet to be seen in the larger-pore SCOF systems,4,6,7 for which less pronounced guest dependence is seen. Notably, the delineation of such a simple size-dependent structure-property relationship for a SCO system, which allows the SCO properties to be engineered in a predictable fashion, has eluded attempts over many years. This situation is in stark contrast, for example, to the crystal chemisty of discrete SCO systems, for which crystal packing energetics are considerably more tolerant to SCO; for such materials, a principal inﬂuence on SCO properties of the guest species is the modiﬁcation of the ligand ﬁeld strength through very subtle and largely unpredictable changes in crystal packing interactions, making the deconvolution and subsequent control of these effects very difﬁcult.38 While we observe a systematic trend in SCO temperature with guest size, no clear relationship exists with SCO hysteresis width, which varies considerably for the different guests. This point alone is of considerable interest in demonstrating that intraframework ‘communication” effects, whether they be steric or electronic in nature, do not solely govern the bistable temperature range. With the extent of electronic and structural bistability in SCO systems depending on factors such as the rate of change in energy of the HS and LS states with temperature and the activated solid-state pathway between these, this suggests that the energetics of the HS and LS crystalline states vary differently with temperature for the different guests (i.e., that the SCO enthalpies show some temperature depen- dence and/or that the SCO entropies show some guest- dependence) and/or, perhaps more likely, that the guest molecule inﬂuences the energetics of the activated pathway taken between each crystalline state. The latter mechanism in particular is expected to be inﬂuenced by factors such as the effective rate of change of kinetic dimensions of the guests with temperature. We note also that the lack of any trend in the hysteresis width with SCO temperature indicates that the thermal energy of the sample does not appear to strongly inﬂuence the temperature range of bistability. Memory Effects. The adsorption of all guests investigated in this study was found to be entirely reversible, with guest desorption yielding the apohost structure 1 in all cases. Such a property is conventional for robust framework materials of this type. Exploitation of the framework’s bistability, however, allows this reversibility to be formally broken in an extremely novel fashion: at 297 K, sorption then desorption of Acn in 1HS occurs via the process 1HS f 1·1.0AcnLS f 1LS, whereas adsorption then desorption of Ac in 1LS occurs via the process 1LS f 1·1.2AcHS f 1HS (see Supporting Information). In each case, the framework does not return reversibly to its initial form, instead retaining memory of the spin state of the solvated phase. Similarly, guest-sorbed phases are able to retain a memory of (38) Hostettler, M.; Tornroos, K. W.; Chernyshov, D.; Vangdal, B.; Bu¨rgi, H. B. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2004, 43, 4589–4594. J. AM. CHEM.

This novel property is made possible by the fact that the energetics of guest sorption/desorption and migration are insufﬁcient to excite the host lattice between its HS and LS states within the bistable temperature region. As such, this material not only is able to act as an “instantaneous” molecular sensor but within the bistable temperature region can remember its spin state prior to guest adsorption/desorption. This adds a further unique sensing functionality to materials of this type. Conclusions We report highly novel guest-dependent SCO properties and spin-state-dependent host-guest properties in a robust pillared Hofmann-type system. The adsorption of molecular guests in this system occurs with sufﬁcient energy to signiﬁcantly perturb the energetics of SCO, thereby yielding dramatic changes to the SCO properties; this effect is particularly pronounced for the more strongly interacting solvent guests. Due to this, and to the fact that guest adsorption/desorption and SCO switching uniquely occur in the same temperature and pressure regimes, we are able to demonstrate conclusively that guest adsorption/desorption can induce SCO, thereby joining the well- established quartet of temperature,39 pressure,37 magnetic ﬁeld,40 and light irradiation41 as SCO stimuli. Such a property, which is highly speciﬁc for each of the guests studied, points to possible molecular sensing applications for systems of this type and to the possible generation of more advanced materials functionalities in which guest exchange is used to stimulate materials function (e.g., electronic, magnetic, optical, chemical, mechanical, etc.) in a switchable fashion. Changes to the SCO behavior of this system may be rationalized uniquely in terms of a simple guest size/shape argument; in addition to external pressure37 and particle size effects,16,20,21,42 this relationship provides one of the ﬁrst clear routes toward the engineering of prescribed SCO switching properties, some 78 years after the ﬁrst report of this switching phenomenon.39 Our systematic analyses suggest that this simple relationship, which in essence is an extension of the external pressure effect that has been widely documented for the SCO phenomenon,12,37,43 exists because the dominant factor that determines the temperature of SCO is the temperature-dependent host-guest interaction energies rather than guest-induced varia- tions to ligand ﬁeld splittings at the SCO centers or other similarly subtle effects. Clearly, the “internal pressure” ratio- nalization put forward represents a considerable oversimpliﬁca- tion, with the adsorbed guests applying anisotropic interactions spread non-uniformly across the pore surfaces rather than bulk isotropic pressure/compression internally. As such, further guest- exchange measurements and structural analyses, coupled with guest binding simulations, will be of great interest to better delineate this effect and to elucidate more sophisticated structure-property relationships that incorporate details of the guest shape and its orientation within the pores rather than simply its relative dimensions. The exploration of partial guest loading and mixtures of guests, which is expected to lead to intermediate SCO temperatures if the SCO energetics are determined principally by the optimization of temperature- dependent host-guest interactions, is likely to be particularly illuminating. The observation of alternate preferential adsorption of dif- ferent guests into this porous host lattice in its different spin states, shown here as a relatively minor effect for N2 and CO2, suggests that new molecular separation strategies may be possible for switchable hosts. For example, such materials could potentially be used to alternately adsorb/desorb two different guests from a mixture through control of the host spin state. Moreover, such systems might provide useful for the separation of three-component mixtures through exploitation of the dif- ferential guest selectivities of the HS and LS states of the host. While the adsorption of molecular guests in this system occurs with sufﬁcient energy to perturb the energetics of SCO, it is most interesting that the energetics of guest adsorption/desorp- tion and guest migration processes do not, under the adsorption/ desorption conditions explored here, provide sufﬁcient impetus to excite the crystallites to their alternate spin state if performed within the bistable temperature region. This feature, coupled with the fact that this is the ﬁrst material reported for which guest adsorption/desorption and SCO switching occur in the (39) Cambi, L.; Szego, L. Ber. Dtsch. Chem.

Most notably, we show that exploitation of the host lattice bistability leads to highly novel spin-state-dependent sorption isotherms and hys- teretic sorption isobars and to sample history-dependent mo- lecular sensing properties. To our knowledge, this represents the ﬁrst exploitation of host bistability to control adsorption properties. To conclude, synergistic interplay between SCO and guest- exchange processes means that both guest-exchange-induced SCO and SCO-induced guest-exchange properties are exhibited by this system. In addition to further mapping out these highly novel effects, it will be interesting to explore whether interplay with other SCO stimuli might produce other, even more exotic materials properties. For example, laser irradiation at temper- atures within the SCO hysteresis region is known to excite this framework phase between the HS and LS spin states,15 raising the very interesting question of whether such an effect could be used to stimulate the uptake or release of guests within a light-induced adsorbent and/or release agent.

Thermogravimetry Measurements of 1·2H2O and the guest loaded phases 1·xGuest (Guest = Me, Et, Ac, Acn, Tol) were made on a TA Instruments Hi-Res TGA 2950 Thermogravimetric Analyser. The atmosphere was controlled with a dinitrogen supply (0.1 Lmin-1). To identify the approximate temperatures of water loss and thermal decomposition 1·2H2O was ramped at 2ºC min-1 from 20 to 500ºC under a dry N2 atmosphere. To determine the approximate number of guest molecules under a ‘liquid loading’ situation, the 1·xGuest phases were obtained by added a drop of guest solvent to the desorbed phase, 1. The samples were loaded wet and allowed to isotherm at room temperature under dinitrogen for 20 min before ramping to 170 °C at 1 °Cmin-1. Distinction of mass losses due to surface and pore solvent, which overlap in time/temperature range for this non-equilibrium measurement but which may be distinguished by their differing rates, was estimated by analysis of the 1st and 2nd derivatives of the desorption curve. Thermogravimetric data for the guest desorption and thermal decomposition of 1·2H2O are illustrated in Figure S1. Complete and rapid desorption of the water guests occurs with heating to 70ºC, beyond which the empty framework material is stable to ca. 220ºC. The observed mass loss of 10.0% associated with the loss of the guest water is in close agreement with that calculated (10.8 %) for the stoichiometry 1·2H2O, which is derived from chemical microanalysis and consistent with previous literature on this phase.1 Given the synthesis of this phase from a water/ethanol mixture, we note that a degree of ethanol solvation may be present in these samples, and that the water:ethanol ratio in the channels may vary from sample to sample. The stoichiometry of the guest-sorbed phases 1·xAcn, 1·xAc, 1·xMe, 1·xEt, and 1·xTol was determined by measuring the thermal mass loss of wet samples of 1 that had been immersed ex-situ in the respective liquid solvents at room temperature. From these measurements we assign chemical formulae of 1·1.0Acn, 1·1.2Ac, 1·1.8Me, 1·1.5Et, and 1·0.6Tol (see Table S1); these stoichiometries agree relatively well with those achieved S3 by vapor sorption measurement at saturation coverage (see section 6) and are approximate due to the fact that differentiation between evaporation of surface solvent and desorption of pore solvent was not clear in all cases. 0 100 200 300 50 60 70 80 90 100 Weight (%) Temperature ( oC) 10.03% at 110 oC Figure S1.

Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction (SCXRD) Data Collection & Refinement Details Diffraction data sets for 1·2H2O(150), 1·2H2O(150t), 1·2H2O(300t) and 1(375) were collected on a Bruker- Nonius FR591 Kappa APEX II single-crystal diffractometer with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and equipped with an Oxford Systems cryo-system. Four data sets were collected at temperatures representative of the two spin-states and level of hydration. 1·2H2O(150): Orthorhombic non-twinned hydrated LS state at 150 K; 1·2H2O(150t): Orthorhombic twinned hydrated LS state at 150 K; 1·2H2O(300t): Orthorhombic twinned hydrated HS state at 300 K; 1(375): Tetragonal dehydrated HS state at 375 K. The crystal of 1·2H2O(150) was mounted on a mohair fiber in a thin film of Paratone-N oil. The remainder crystals were mounted in a thin smear of grease in a Kapton capillary. Matrix collections were performed to determine unit cells (3 × 12 frames of 0.5° rotation with exposures of 60 s for 1·2H2O(150) and 1·2H2O(150t), 50 s for 1·2H2O(300t), and 20 s for 1(375)). Data were collected over a range of incident angles in sets of φ and ω scans optimized by the COSMO software within the APEX2 suite.2 Semi-empirical multi-scan absorption corrections were applied using SADABS3 on data reduced in the APEX2 software suite containing SAINT.4 Structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-975 and refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.6 Crystallographic tables were created using the XCIF program.7 Illustrations were produced using the programs, POV-Ray8 with outputs from X-Seed!,9 WebLab ViewerPro10 and ORTEP-3.11 S5 Figure S2. Stick representation of the orthorhombic crystal structure of 1·2H2O; the surface of the 1-D pores are shown in orange. Guest water molecules, which lie disordered along these channels, are removed for clarity. Refinement Details Excellent solutions and refinements of structures 1·2H2O(150t) and 1·2H2O(300t) were initially obtained in the tetragonal space group P4/mmm, in which there is with two-fold disorder of the pyrazine units. Following the discovery of an untwinned crystal 1·2H2O(150), these structures were reprocessed and refined in the orthorhombic space group Pmmm with merohedral twinning; a TWIN instruction defining orthorhombic emulation of tetragonal was used (TWIN 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 -1), where the twin components refined to similar ratios for the two data sets (0.55:0.45 and 0.50:0.50 for 1·2H2O(150t) and 1·2H2O(300t), respectively). Non-standard unit cell settings for 1·2H2O(150), 1·2H2O(150t), 1·2H2O(300t) were chosen so that the pyrazine ligand would lie in the direction of the c-axis; this allows easy comparison with the tetragonal structure and is conventional for pillared-layer compounds. The asymmetric units of 1·2H2O(150), 1·2H2O(150t) and 1·2H2O(300t) contain disordered water molecules. In the case of 1·2H2O(150) and 1·2H2O(150t) they are disordered over four sites (O(10)-O(13)) and 1·2H2O(300t) over three sites (O(10)-O(12)). In each case the sum of the occupancy factors were constrained to sum to one S6 using the SUMP command so that there are two water molecules per formula unit. The proportions are: 0.385 (O(10)), 0.215 (O(11)), 0.171 (O(12)) and 0.228 (O(13)) for 1·2H2O(150); 0.100 (O(10)), 0.152 (O(11)), 0.388 (O(12)) and 0.360 (O(13)) for 1·2H2O(150t); 0.272 (O(10)), 0.533 (O(11)), and 0.195 (O(12)) for 1·2H2O(300t). In the hydrated phases the thermal parameters of the oxygen atoms were assigned the same freely refined variable: 0.059, 0.209 and 0.176 for 1·2H2O(150), 1·2H2O(150t) and 1·2H2O(300t), respectively. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically except for the disordered lattice water oxygen atoms, which were refined isotropically. The pyrazine hydrogen atom was included at a calculated position. Solvent accessible volumes were calculated within PLATON12 using the SQUEEZE routine. Variable Temperature Unit Cell Determinations Unit cell determinations of 1·2H2O were carried out between 150 and 310 K at approximately regular intervals stepped (between 5 and 30 K) in cooling and warming modes to monitor the structural changes associated with the spin transition (Figure S3). Crystals were mounted with a thin smear of grease in an open-ended Kapton capillary to allow the guest molecules to be liberated as the temperature was stepped to 310 K. The ramp rate between steps was 360 Kh-1. Matrix collections of 3 × 12 frames of 0.5° rotation with 60s were taken at the various temperatures. Data at all temperatures were constrained to be tetragonal in order to provide a more consistent comparison of the variable temperature data; this constraint is justified on the grounds that the single crystal structural refinements show that the crystals are pseudo-merohedrally twinned (orthorhombic emulating tetragonal) with equal twin components.

Synchrotron Powder X-ray Diffraction (S-PXRD) Desorption from 1·2H2O  1 and time-resolved SCO measurement of 1·2H2O and 1 A time-resolved variable temperature S-PXRD experiment on 1·2H2O was undertaken to investigate the structural changes associated with guest desorption and SCO. The five events studied in sequence were the HS  LS and LS  HS transitions for the solvated material 1·2H2O, guest desorption, and the HS  LS and LS  HS transitions for the desorbed material, 1.

Variable temperature peak intensity evolution over the range 6.5-9.2 ° and 13.6-15 ° for 1·2H2O showing the discontinuous LS → HS transition at ca. 270 K upon warming and subsequent guest desorption from 1·2H2O to 1 with heating above ca. 290 K. The emergence of transitory peaks at ca. 7.7º and 14.2º most likely indicate the transformation to a tetragonal supercell with a´´ = b´´ ≈ √2 a and c´´ ≈ c, which we attribute to the formation of a partially hydrated phase 1·1H2O with rotation of alternating pyrazine bridges. The subsequent emergence of peaks at ca. 8.1 and 14.0º have not been indexed successfully but likely demonstrate the formation of a further superstructure with continued water desorption. The peak at ca. 7.4º corresponds to a hydrated impurity phase. S13 b) Spin-crossover Figure S10 shows details of the S-PXRD patterns during SCO transitions for 1·2H2O and 1. Ratios of HS to LS were calculated from a GSAS Rietveld refinement.13 Both phases were modelled using the tetragonal P4/mmm cell, based on the data presented in Table 1 of the manuscript. Unit cells were refined to obtain the best fit, except where the fraction of a given phase was 10 %. S14 Figure S10.

Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements Magnetic susceptibility measurements were made using a Quantum Design MPMS 5 SQUID instrument operating under a field of 1 T. All data reported were obtained on microcrystalline samples isolated, initially, as 1·2H2O. The desorbed material 1 was obtained by heating 1·2H2O at 80°C under a vacuum for 2 hr. Figure S18 shows MT Vs T data for the samples sealed in a quartz tube with Teflon stopper and secured with a small piece of parafilm to prevent guest desorption. The crystals were not crushed at any stage. The solvated phases were obtained by adding few drops of the appropriate solvent to 1 and letting it sit for approximately 12 hr before the measurement was made. 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 MT (cm 3Kmol -1) Temperature (K) Figure S18.

Gas Adsorption For all measurements the purity of the N2 and CO2 gas was 99.99% and of the oxygen was 99.9 % (all ‘high purity’ grade). Adsorption Isotherms N2 and CO2 adsorption/desorption isotherms for 1 were measured on an IGA-002 gravimetric adsorption instrument (Hiden-Isochema, UK). Samples of 1·2H2O were loaded fresh from solution in a stainless steel basket and sealed in the sample chamber. The chamber was evacuated then heated to 70 °C under high vacuum until the sample mass was stable. The measured mass was corrected for the buoyancy of the sample and the microbalance components. N2 isotherms (Figure S19) were measured to 10 bar at 278, 288, 293, 298, 308, 318 and 327 K. CO2 isotherms (Figure S20) were measured to 2.5 bar at 283, 288, 293, 298, 303, 308, 313 and 318 K. At each temperature (except the maximum and minimum temperature) isotherms were measured once after cooling from the maximum temperature and once after warming from the minimum temperature.

Calculations of the enthalpy of adsorption (ΔHads) used the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, which defines ΔHads in terms of pressure (P) and temperature (T) at a given surface coverage (θ): Where adsorption isotherms are measured at two or more temperatures, plotting ln P vs 1/T at a given uptake (n) (which is assumed to be equivalent to θ) will give ΔHads according to the equation . 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 CO2 adsorption (mol/mol) Pressure (bar) 293 K, high spin 293K, low spin 298 K, high spin 298 K, low spin 303K, high spin 303K, low spin S26 These plots, referred to as adsorption isosteres, are shown in Figure S23. In practice this requires that the isotherms are interpolated to give common values of n; several methods to do this are available. In the case of the CO2 isotherms, a virial method reported by Thomas et al. was applied.14 The measured data was fitted to the virial equation ; the fitted lines are shown in Figure S23, and the virial coefficients are listed in Table S2. In the case of the N2 isotherms, the virial equation did not correctly describe the measured data, and a spine curve was instead used to interpolate the data. The standard error for the linear fit to the isostere was used to provide an estimated error for ΔHads; uncertainties in measurements of temperature, pressure and mass were not estimated. Table S2.

Sample preparation was as described above for the gravimetric isotherm measurements. Data were collected by maintaining the pressure of the gas in the chamber while increasing and decreasing the temperature at 0.1 K·min-1 from 275 to at least 313 K, then cooling back to 275 K. The SCO temperatures derived from these data, Tm, were defined as the point of maximum rate of change of sorptive uptake; we note that such a value does not correspond directly with T½ as measured magnetically. The slightly narrower width of the hysteresis loops measured by sorptive methods over those measured magnetically most likely results from the slower thermal ramping employed for these measurements; we note that sample heating results both from the exothermic HS → LS transition and from guest adsorption (and vice versa), and that the effect of the former would be to artificially widen the hysteresis loop and of the latter to sharpen the transition if HS uptake exceeds the LS uptake and to broaden if HS uptake is less than LS uptake. At heating and cooling rates greater than 0.1 K·min-1 artefacts were observed in the isobars around the spin-crossover temperatures that were attributed to these enthalpic processes. The similar temperature range of the SCO transition for the CO2 loaded phases suggests that no sample heating effects result from guest adsorption/desorption.

Low temperature gas adsorption isotherms Isotherms for the adsorption of N2 (99.999%) and Ar (99.999%) into 1 were measured using an ASAP 2020 volumetric instrument supplied by Micromeritics Instruments Inc. The instrument has isolated analysis and outgas vacuum systems to maintain gas purity. Liquid N2 and liquid Ar (77.35 and 87.29 K respectively) was used for temperature control and an isothermal jacket was used to maintain constant cryogen level on the sample tube and P0 tube during analysis as evaporation occurs. The free space was determined by He (99.999%) at 298 and 77 K. Adsorption standards using this instrument were routinely run on Zeolite 13X and Cu3BTC2 (HKUST-1)15 for N2 and Ar adsorption, with an excellent agreement between the observed isotherm and the literature being found. S30 The sample (ca. 100 mg) was loaded into the glass analysis tube and evacuated at ca. 10-8 mbar for 24 hr, then heated at 2 °C min-1 to 75 °C and evacuated for a further 24 hr until the outgas rate was less than 3 μbar min-1. The sample was then backfilled with N2 before being transferred to the analysis port where it was evacuated for at least a further 4 hr before the analysis was started. The N2 and Ar adsorption isotherms, measured at 77.35 and 87.29 K respectively, both revealed a Type I adsorption curve with abrupt uptake at low partial pressure, typical for an ultramicroporous material. The adsorption branch of the N2 isotherm was fitted to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)16 and Langmuir17 equation to give a BET and Langmuir surface area of 480 and 510 m2 g-1 respectively. The total uptake of N2 determined at P/P0 = 0.8 was 6.9 mmol g-1 or 158 cm3 g-1 (STP), equating to 2.1 molecules per formula unit. For Ar at a comparable P/P0 the uptake was 8.2 mmol g-1 or 185 cm3 g-1 (STP), equating to ca. 2 molecules per formula unit. A small amount of hysteresis is observed in both isotherms, which is likely to arise from an adsorption-induced rearrangement of the pyrazine rings from a disordered arrangement to coplanar. Such a process is expected to be slow at cryogenic temperatures. In both adsorption curves a small step is observed at a loading of ca. 1 mol/mol, suggesting that different pockets are filled progressively within the disordered 2-D pore structure of 1.

Vapor Adsorption Vapor adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured using an IGA-002 adsorption instrument with sample preparation as described above for the gas measurements. Ethanol, methanol, acetone and toluene (AR grade) were purified by distillation and stored over activated molecular sieves. During isotherm measurement the temperature of the sample was maintained within ±0.1 °C. The sample chamber was pressurized to set pressures of the adsorbates with a ramp time of 120 s, then the pressure and temperature kept constant while the mass was recorded until the equilibration was reached. The kinetic data were fitted in real time to the linear driving force (LDF) model:18 where u0 is the uptake at the arbitrary time origin t0 ’, k is the time constant, and ∆u is the change in uptake. This process was repeated for each adsorption and desorption pressure point until the complete isotherm was obtained. Reproducibility and sample integrity were confirmed by the collection of a second ethanol isotherm, which superimposed on the first, following all other measurements. The methanol, ethanol and acetone vapor adsorption isotherms can be classified as type I isotherms, with very rapid kinetics during the primary adsorption step (k < 60 s). The toluene isotherm is atypical in terms of both the shape of the isotherm and the variation in the kinetic parameter at different stages. Figure S28 shows that the rate of adsorption slows considerably at ca. 0.1 P0 (0.2 mol/mol loading), and again at 0.4 P0 (0.4 mol/mol loading). This increase in equilibration time suggests that there is a significant energy barrier to overcome before further toluene can be adsorbed, perhaps involving rotation of the pyrazine pillars.

Optical Reflectivity Data were collected using a home-built set-up that allows reflectivity spectra to be collected from 450-950 nm in the temperature range 10-280 K. The diffuse reflected signal was calibrated using activated charcoal (Merck) as a black standard and barium sulfate (BaSO4, DIN50533, Merck) as a white standard. The source of the white light consists of a halogen lamp emitting between 350-2400 nm. The measurements were performed directly on a thin layer of a polycrystalline sample with a small amount of guest solvent added to avoid desorption, but without any dispersion in a matrix. Diffuse absorbance spectra were collected across the full wavelength range, and the temperature dependence of the diffuse reflectance of two wavelengths (ca. 830 nm and 645 nm) for 1, 1·1.2Ac, 1·1.5Et, 1·1.0Acn were recorded (Figures S29 through S40). The temperature dependence of the absorption minima was analysed to determine the SCO temperatures (Table S6). Figure S29.

Raman Spectroscopy Spectra were collected using a Renishaw Raman InVia Reflex Microscope (Renishaw plc., Wotton-under-Edge, UK), equipped with an air-cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Sample excitation was achieved using an Argon ion laser (Modu-Laser, Utah, USA) emitting at 514.5 nm. The spectrometer is fitted with holographic notch filters and a 1200 mm/line grating. The attached microscope is a Leica DMLM and is equipped with three objectives ( 50/0.75 NA, 20/0.40 NA, 5/0.12 NA) and a trinocular viewer which accommodates a video camera allowing direct viewing of the sample. Spectra were recorded with the accumulation of 10 scans, 30 s exposure and a laser power of 2.2 mW measured at the sample. Spectra were not corrected for instrument response. Daily calibration was achieved by recording the Raman spectrum of silicon, with an offset correction performed on the grating to ensure that the position of the silicon band is 520.50 0.10 cm-1. The spectrometer is computer controlled using WiRE™, (Version 2.0 Service Pack 9, Renishaw plc., Wotton–under–Edge, UK). The instrument is equipped with a Linkam THMS 600 temperature stage. Data was collected ca. 20 K above and below T½ and T½ respectively. Samples were sealed in 0.5mm glass capillaries under a thin layer of the solvent. Table S3 shows the known vibrational Raman bands of 1 and Tables S4 and S5 shows the bands and relative shifts of 1·xGuest compared to 1 in both the high and low spin states. Not all of the expected vibrations19 were observed due to a high signal to noise ratio. The LS (ie. low temperature) spectra for all materials showed higher intensity signals than that for the HS state, an effect that has been reported previously.19 Figures S41 through S46 show the Raman Spectra of 1·xGuest. Non-negligible frequency shifts of most of the Raman bands occur for the different guests, indicating that the guest molecules influence the bond vibration energies; this is likely to occur via their steric influence on framework geometry and/or through an electrostic effect in which the bonding electron densities are influenced by the dipolar guests.

Summary of SCO Temperatures A summary of all SCO temperatures determined by the various structural and physical techniques used is given in Table S6. The minor discrepancies between values may be due to a number of factors: The physical and structural changes corresponding to each different measurement technique may correspond to different regions within the SCO transition (e.g., sorption isobars vs magnetic susceptibility); The heating rates are different between measurements; as the HS-to-LS transition is exothermic (and vice versa), faster heating rates have the effect of increasing the width of the hysteresis loops, e.g., we attribute the narrower hysteresis loops extrapolated for 1·0.0N2 and 1·0.0O2, as determined by sorption isobars, over those for 1, as determined by magnetic measurement, principally to the faster warming and cooling rates used in the latter, but note that this extrapolation to zero loading assumes that the presence of these guests in the channels does not influence the activated pathway between the HS and LS states; Sample heterogeneity may differ between bulk powder and crystal samples; Nanoparticle size effects are known to change the SCO properties of this phase;20 Chemical composition of the pores may differ between measurements due to guest desorption/sorption and/or guest exchange, e.g., we attribute the depressed SCO temperatures for 1·2H2O as determined by S-PXRD to a significant degree of ethanol solvation following a washing of this sample.

Guest Molecule Calculations Molecular volumes, surface areas and critical dimensions for methanol, ethanol and acetonitrile adsorbates were estimated from ab initio calculations performed by Dr Meredith L. T. Jordan, University of Sydney, for direct comparison with values reported previously for the other adsorbates used.21 Optimized gas phase geometries and electron densities were obtained at the HF/6-31G(d,p) level of theory, using tight cutoffs for the self- consistent field convergence criteria, for each molecule and the molecular size estimated from the 0.002 atomic unit electron density isosurface, as originally introduced by Bader and coworkers.22 This surface typically contains more than 98% of the total electronic charge of the molecule.23 This level of theory has been previously used to generate molecular surfaces for a range of small molecules.24 The molecular surface areas and volumes were determined by integration in spherical polar coordinates using the IPCM method of Foresman et al.25 The calculations used 1417, 1917 and 1438 integration points for CH3OH, CH3CH2OH and CH3CN, respectively. Critical molecular dimensions were determined from the projection of the 0.002 atomic unit isodensity surface onto the principal axes of the molecules. The results of the calculations are summarised in Table S7. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 program package.26 Table S7.
