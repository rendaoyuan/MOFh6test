Introduction There is currently a great deal of interest in the design and construction of 3-D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) created by joining the metal ions with organic linkers because of their intriguing structural topologies and their versatile applications in the areas of redox catalysis, ion exchange, adsorption, separation, sensors, and photoluminescence.1-6 A number of porous materials constructed by the assembly of discrete metal-carboxylate clusters and organic linkers have been shown to be amenable to tuning of the size and surface properties of the pores.7 For example, a systematic study of MOF-5 and its analogues was exempliﬁed in a report by Yaghi and co-workers, where the metal-carboxylate Zn4O(COO)4 octahedral clusters as secondary building units (SBUs) are interconnected by aromatic rings of different lengths.7a Other discrete SBU shapes (triangles, squares, tetrahedra, etc.) have also been used to synthesize other MOFs with useful physical-chemical properties and intrigu- ing structural topologies.8 * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Thus, the 5-ami- noisophthalate ligand may be effective in constructing porous lanthanide metal-organic frameworks. In this paper, we highlight hydrothermal synthesis as a powerful method for the preparation of coordination poly- mers and isolate two new porous praseodymium coordination polymers {Pr2(aip)3(H2O)2·3H2O}n (1) and {Pr2(Haip)2(aip)- (NO3)2· 8H2O}n (2), which have been characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), power X-ray diffraction, and single-crystal diffrac- tion. In particular, the potential porosities of the dehydrated coordination polymers were estimated using a computational method based on Connolly’s algorithm. Moreover, N2 sorption measurements and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation (GCMC) reveal that dehydrated compound 2 exhibits reversible type I isotherm behavior indicative of a microporous material and nice hydrogen storage capacity, respectivey.

Single-crystal X-ray diffrac- tion data collections of 1 and 2 were performed on a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer operating at 50 kV and 30 mA using Mo KR radiation (λ ) 0.71073 Å). Data collection and reduction were performed using the APEX II software.13 Multiscan absorption corrections were applied for all of the data sets using the APEX II program.13 Both structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL program package.13 All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms attached to carbon were placed in geometrically idealized positions and reﬁned using a riding model. Hydrogen atoms on water molecules or amino groups were located from difference Fourier maps and were also reﬁned using a riding model. The SQUEEZE procedure was used to remove the highly disordered four water molecules hosted within the cavity of compound 2, which was implemented in the molecular geometry program Platon.14 The R values improved from 0.0427 to 0.0349 and 0.1221 to 0.0901 for R1 and wR2, respectively, after application of the correction. Crystallographic data for 1 and 2 are presented in Table 1. Results and Discussion Hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis has signiﬁcant advantages over other methods for the synthesis of coordination frame- works.15 In conjunction with this technique, lanthanide oxides were used as the lanthanide source so that the lanthanide ions were slowly released to lower the polymerization rate and lead to high-quality single crystals. Furthermore, in our previous work, perchloric acid and nitric acid were shown to play an important role in the construction of novel coordination frameworks.16 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed that compounds 1 and 2 were open 3D coordination frameworks constructed by inﬁnite rod-shaped praseodymium carboxylate SBUs and phenyl links. As illustrated in Figure 1a, com- pound 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group Pj1 and has two crystallographically independent Pr(III) ions, three aip ligands, and two coordinated water molecules and three lattice water molecules per asymmetric unit. Both Pr(III) centers are eight-coordinated by seven carboxyl oxygen atoms from six aip ligands and one water molecule and can be described as having a bicapped trigonal prismatic ge- ometry with Pr-O distances and O-Pr-O bond angles ranging from 2.358(5) Å to 2.773(5) Å and 48.82(15)° to 167.18(18)°, respectively. Whereas, compound 2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnma, and it has one Pr(III) ion, one and a half aip ligands (one of which is protonated at the amine), one nitrate, and four lattice water molecules per asymmetric unit (Figure 1b). The Pr(III) center is nine- coordinated by nine oxygen atoms. Seven out of the nine are from carboxylate groups of six aip ligands, and the remaining two belong to one chelating nitrate group. The Pr-O distances and O-Pr-O bond angles range from 2.391(5) to 2.884(5) Å and 47.53(19)° to 156.61(19)°, respectively. This gives an overall distorted tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry around the metal center. In the polymeric structure of 1, the carboxylate groups of the three unique aip ligands adopt two different bridging modes (Figure 2a,b), resulting in the formation of a pra- seodymium-carboxylate chain along the a axis (Figure 2c). The inﬁnite rod-shaped praseodymium-carboxylate chain can be regarded as a SBU, where the two unique praseody- mium ions are separated by 4.238 (2) Å. These SBUs are sustained by rigid phenyl rings of aip ligands to construct a three-dimensional coordination framework (Figure 3a). The framework can be ideally regarded as interlinked inﬁnite rod- shaped SBUs with small channels running along the a axis of the unit cell (Figure 3b). While assigning a deﬁnitive underlying network topology to this structure is difﬁcult (the choice of which part of the 1D metal carboxylate chains to assign as a ﬁnite “node” is very subjective and somewhat arbitrary), Yaghi and co-workers have described a series of other metal carboxylate coordination polymers in terms of the packing and interconnection of 1D rods.9b Under this nomenclature, compound 1 has a pcu-type rod packing. The channels in the framework host water molecules which are stabilized by H bonds involving -NH2 groups and carboxy- late groups. The size of the void created by the formal removal of the coordinated and uncoordinated water mol- ecules is 207.5 Å3, which is 14.5% of the unit cell volume.14 In the polymeric structure of 2, the carboxylate groups of the aip ligands again show two bridging modes (Figure 2a,b) and connect praseodymium centers to form inﬁnite rod- shaped secondary building units (Figure 2d). The Pr-Pr distance is 4.496 (3) Å. The bridging backbones of the aip ligands then lead to the formation of an overall 3D structure with irregular large channels running along the a axis. The chelating NO3 and uncoordinated amine and ammonium groups, good potential H-bonding donors and acceptors, point into the large channels (Figure 3c). The framework can also be rationalized as interlinked inﬁnite rod-shaped SBUs (Figure 3d); the rod packing is of the bnn type.9b The size (13) APEXII, version 3.1.2; Bruker AXS Inc: Madison, WI, 2004.

To determine the stability of the coordination polymers 1 and 2, TGAs of 1 and 2 were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. The TGA trace of compound 1 shows that the ﬁrst weight loss of 6.09% from 80 to 120 °C corresponds to the loss of three guest molecules (calcd, 5.94%; see Figure S1, Supporting Information). Upon further heating, a second weight loss of 4.05% arises in the temperature range 210∼230 °C (calcd 3.96%) and corre- sponds to the departure of coordination water molecules. Then, the aip ligands decompose, resulting in the collapse of the framework. The TGA trace of compound 2 shows that the intercalated water molecules are mainly removed in the temperature range 50∼130 °C and that the resulting dehydrated nanoporous compound 2b is stable up to 420 °C (found, 13.39%; calcd, 13.22%; see Figure S2, Supporting Information). The power X-ray diffraction of the guest-free phase [Pr2(Haip)2(aip)(NO3)2] (2b) is almost identical to that of the as-synthesized 2 (Figure 4a,b). We have failed to get the structure redetermination of 2b. Interestingly, the dehy- drated powder of 2b can be restored to the form of {Pr2(Haip)2(aip)(NO3)2· 8H2O}n after being immersed in water for one day, as shown by the elemental analysis experiment (see Supporting Information) and power X-ray diffraction measurement results (Figure 4c,d). Moreover, as shown in Figure 4e and f, the stable channels of 2b can also reversibly host other small solvent molecules (e.g., methanol and ethanol), which are also determined by infrared spectra with the appearance of broad O-H and sharp C-H stretch- ing vibrations in the region of 3400 and 2950 cm-1, respectively. Since, the dehydrated frameworks of 1 and 2 consist of 3D porous network structures, gas adsorption is the usual way to evaluate a material’s porosity. Herein, we used a computational method to estimate the potential porosity of the dehydrated coordination polymers. In this context, we have formally partially dehydrated compounds 1b and 2b: The crystallization water molecules (easy to remove experi- mentally) are formally removed, while the coordination water molecules (strongly bonded to the metal ions) are not. The computational method, based on Connolly’s algorithm,17 has already been described and successfully used elsewhere.6b,18 Thanks to it, the porosity proﬁle of a partially dehydrated material can be designed on the basis of its crystal structure. As can be seen in Figure 5a, compound 1b presents one type of channel spreading along the aj axis with a cavity radius of 1.2 Å, not big enough for being able to host molecules other than water molecules or He. However, compound 2b exhibits large potential porosity. In order to compare the results of the calculations with experimental values, we have used a probe sphere presenting a radius of 1.8 Å, which is the usual kinetic radius of N2.9b With this value, the potential speciﬁc accessible surface of this compound is 792 m2 g-1. Furthermore, as can be seen in the porosity proﬁle (reported in Figure 5b), 2b is able to host molecules with kinetic radii as big as 2.3 Å, which is in perfect agreement with what could be anticipated from the crystallographic data. To get a better understanding of the porosity of 2b, its sorption properties have been investigated using N2 at 77 K. The N2 gas sorption at 77 K shows a reversible type I (17) Connolly, M. L.

It has a slight deviation from the conventional type I isotherm at P/P0 (0.08-0.6), suggesting the existence of a trace amount of mesoporous crystals, which are formed by agglomerating nanosized MOF crystallites. The N2 uptake of 230 cm3/g (STP; 287 mg/g) of 2b is observed at 1 atm, which corresponds to 9.7 molecules per unit cell. For the hydrogen adsorption behavior of 2b, a GCMC simulation implemented by the sorption program in the MS modeling 4.0 package20 was performed to predict its sorption isotherm using standard algorithms. The structure of the unit cell was imported from compound 2b and then ﬁxed the simulation cell, consisting of 2 × 1 × 2 unit cells. The cutoff radius was set to 12.5 Å. The simulations were carried out at a temperature of 77 K and in the pressure range 0-100 kPa. For each state point, the GCMC simulation consisted of 2 × 106 steps to guarantee equilibration, followed by 2 × 106 steps to sample the desired thermodynamic properties. The program for GCMC simulations of the adsorption of ﬂuids in porous materials has been veriﬁed in previous reports.21 For the hydrogen molecules, the two-site Lennard- Jones potential model suggested by Yang and Zhong21a,b was adopted. For the structural modeling, the procedure was based on the standard universal force ﬁeld21 with some reﬁned parameters, which has successfully been used to study the adsorption isotherms of a series of IRMOFs.21–23 Whereas, GCMC simulation studies on hydrogen storage in MOFs based on inﬁnite rod-shaped SBUs are very scarce. Herein, we performed molecular simulations of hydrogen sorption in two MOFs analogous to our MOF-2b in advance, as shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information; the simula- tion results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data for Ln2(PDC)3 (M ) Y, Er; PDC ) pyridine-3,5- dicarboxylate) at 77 K and 1 atm.10a For the structure of 2b, a similar simulated adsorption isotherm is shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information); we found that 2b can absorb (19) Gregg, S.

Qiu et al. 3980 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 9, 2009 4.7 mg of H2 per gram at 77 K and 1 atm, that is, 2.2 H2 per formula unit of compound 2b. The hydrogen capacity can be clearly explained via the snapshots of the structures of 2b with adsorbed hydrogen molecules at various pressures (see Figure S5, Supporting Information). Initially, hydrogen molecules locate the corner regions between nitrate and amino groups close to rod-shaped praseodymium-carboxylate units, and then the aromatic units start adsorbing hydrogen molecules at higher pressures, followed by the ﬁlling of the inner spaces of the cavities. This is in accordance with the experimental observations of Rosi et al.7b and Kubota et al.,24 who deduced that hydrogen molecules prefer to be absorbed close to metal-oxygen units. Therefore, the amino groups in the adsorption of hydrogen molecules within the cavities should be advantageous when designing new materials. In summary, two new 3D praseodymium coordination frameworks with different porosities have been prepared under hydrothermal conditions on the basis of different acids. The porosities of both dehydrated coordination frameworks were estimated using a computational method based on Connolly’s algorithm, showing that 2b has a signiﬁcant potential speciﬁc accessible surface, high N2 storage based on BET experiments, and good hydrogen absorption capacity at 77 K and 1 atm on the basis of grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, powder X-ray diffraction measurement results demonstrated that the stable channels of 2b can reversibly host other small solvent molecules (e.g., water, methanol, and ethanol).
