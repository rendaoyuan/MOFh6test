The synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of sorption properties and catalytic activity of this new rare-earth polymeric framework type are here described. Introduction Calixarenes and their analogues are fascinating basket- shaped compounds that possess the ability to hold metal ions, as well as molecules, in their interior.1-3 In the solid state, the cone shapes of the calixarenes give bowl cavities that can encapsulate some small molecules, both charged and neutral, by weak interactions including H-bonding, H-aromatic, etc., so these compounds have been widely regarded as important macrocyclic host molecules in host-guest chemis- try.4-8 As a result of their very easy synthesis from phenols and aldehydes,9-11 they are receiving increasingly wide atten- tion. Water-soluble calixarenes have been exploited in all areas of supramolecular chemistry over the past two decades.12-18 Some reports deal with complexes or coordina- tion polymers of p-sulfonatocalix[n]arenes with transition metals;19-26 in the case of rare earth elements (REEs), not many reports can be found, most being dedicated to isolated complexes or those linked through weak interactions (H bond or π-π). Onthe other hand, the synthesis of inorganic clusters continues attracting considerable attention, due to the inter- esting properties of the metallic aggregates.27,28 Rare earth element clusters still remain less studied than those of transi- tion metals. The control of the hydrolysis of the lanthanide salts in the presence of appropriate ligands appears as a common strategy for the synthesis of hydroxo lanthanide clusters. However, the cluster-forming ability of p-sulfo- natocalix[n]arenes as multidentate and multinucleating ligands has not been described up to now. Such ability has been discovered for thiacalix[n]arenes,29 in which the intro- duction of the S heteroatom enforces significantly a coordi- native capacity of the ligand molecule. Only tri- and tetra- nuclear clusters were found to be supported by thiacalix- [4]arenes and only up to pentanuclear clusters by a larger and more flexible thiacalix[6]arene. Octalanthanide and dodecalanthanide wheels were reported to be supported by p-tert-butylsulfonylcalix[4]arene.30,31 Among the lanthanide clusters, the hexanuclear hydroxo lanthanide cluster of the M68 type appears as a common unit, both as an independent cluster and as a core of a larger aggregate. In this M68 hydroxo lanthanide cluster, the Ln atoms are disposed octahedrally, linked by μ3-OH- groups, and in most cases with a central μ6 oxygen atom. This latter has been suggested to have an influence on the stability of the Ln6 units, but some examples of octahedral Ln6 aggregates can be found without it.32-35 Despite that the hydroxo lanthanide clusters in most of the examples are discrete units, a great effort is being done to incorporate these types of lanthanideaggregates into polymeric frameworks,36-39and in many cases, they are in combination with transition metals in the framework.37,40-42 The utilization of metal aggregates as secondary building units (SBUs) is a common strategy in the preparation of metallorganic frameworks.43 However, when sulfonate derivative ligands are used, the most common pattern is the formation of inorganic chains or layers,44,45 and there are few examples of structures with a discrete inorganic SBU.46 In this paper, we present the synthesis, crystal structure, and catalytic activity study of the first example of a rare earth polymeric framework (RPF) com- posed of hexanuclear hydroxo-lanthanide clusters and p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene. Experimental Section Synthesis. The products were obtained under hydrothermal conditions. The molar composition of the initial mixture was 3Ln/ H5L/5300H2O/9.5Et3N (pH = 8). The Ln3þ ions were added in their hydrate nitrate form. H5L is the calix[4]arene-p-sulfonic acid. In a typical synthesis, 0.197 g of La(NO3)3 3 6H2O and 0.117 g of H5L are solved in 13.5 mL of water. Et3N (0.18 mL) is then added, and the solution is magnetically stirred at room temperature for 5 min. After this, the solution is placed into a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 160 C for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature, the product is filtered, then washed with water and acetone and dried in air. Equivalent synthesis procedures are carried out employing Pr(NO3)3 3 6H2O and Nd(NO3)3 3 6H2O to obtain the corresponding products. The pH control seems to be critical: experiments with pH values lower or higher than 8 were unsuccess- ful, and no product was obtained. The product appears with good yield after only 5 h of heating. With heating times longer than 10 h, the yield decreases significantly (36% yield after 20 h), suggesting that the product decomposes in the reaction media. Under these synthesis conditions, obtaining products with smaller lanthanides was unsuccessful. Only in the case of ytterbium, a few crystals were *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

For the La, Pr, and Nd preparations, only a few single crystals were obtained in the case of Pr and Nd, and in all cases, they were very small crystals. Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction. A small, square-shaped crystal of each product was selected and glued on a glass fiber for X-ray diffraction experiments. X-ray intensity data were collected in a Bruker D8 diffractometer equipped with an Axiom detector and a X-ray microsource (Cu KR radiation = 1.541 78 A˚ ) and in a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer equipped with a normal focus, 2.4 kW sealed tube X-ray source (Mo KR radiation = 0.710 73 A˚ ). Data were collected at room temperature by a combination of several sets of exposures. Each exposure of 20 s covered 0.5 or 0.3 in v. Unit cell dimensions were determined by a least-squares fit of 60 reflections with I > 20s(I). The structures were solved by direct methods. The final cycles of refinement were carried out by full- matrix least-squares analyses with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms except for the disordered water mole- cules. Hydrogen atoms were geometrically calculated. Up to three different single crystals of RPF9 were measured, three of them of Pr and one of Nd. In the Pr compound, the coordinated oxygen O8 of the water molecule is disordered in two positions with relative occupancy factor of 0.7:0.3, and the occupancy factor of the coordinated water molecule O6 was refined to 0.4; in the Nd and Yb crystals, no disorder was found for the coordinated water molecules. In the three cases, a solvent water molecule was also located. Calculations were carried out with APEX II and SMART software for data collection and data reduction and SHELXTL for the structure solution and refinement. The small size and bad quality of the crystals, especially in that of Yb, did not allow better refinements. X-ray Powder Diffraction. X-ray powder patterns were measured in a D8 Bruker diffractometer with a step size of 0.2 and an exposure time of 2 s/step. For the thermodiffraction experiments, the samples were heated at a rate of 5 C/min, and after 10 min heating, the powder patterns were collected. At 125 C, the sample was heated for 65 min, measuring the diffraction patterns at several times until no changes in the patterns were observed. Catalytic Activity Experiments. One millimole of methyl phenyl sulfide was added to a suspension containing the corresponding amount of catalyst (ratio Ln/substrate = 1:1000) in 5 mL of acetonitrile. The suspension was heated to 80 C under stirring, and then hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 50%, 3 mmol) was added dropwise. At selected intervals of time, the grade of conversion was measured in a gas chromatographer. A powder X-ray pattern of the catalyst was measured after the reaction to check that the structure did not suffer any change. After the reaction cycles, the catalyst was separated by decanta- tion of the solution and reused with fresh solvent and substrate, starting a new cycle of reaction when the oxidizing agent is added. While the oxidation of sulfide continued in presence of the catalyst, there was no further significant conversion when the catalyst was removed from the reaction system. The blank experiments, carried out in absence of catalyst, showed no conversion after 4 h. Surface Area Analysis and Gas Sorption Properties. Specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K obtained on a Micro- meritics Tristar 3000 sorptometer. Before adsorption measure- ments, the sample was outgassed at 383 K. N2 adsorption isotherms were performed in the relative pressure range of 10-6 to 1 atm. The gas adsorption studies with H2, CH4, and CO2 were performed using a Hiden Isochema (Warrington, U.K.) intelligent gravimetric analyzer (IGA) equipped with a microgram balance, and two barotron pressure transducers in the ranges 0-2 mbar and 0-10 bar were used to monitor the pressure. The microbalance had a long-term stability of (1 μg with a weighing resolution of 0.2 μg. These measurements were carried out using high purity gases. The gas entrance was made by means of a BRONKHORST mass flow controller. All isotherms were measured to 1 bar at 304 K. The sample was outgassed under high vacuum at 403 K prior to the admission of any gas into the system. The buoyancy effects were corrected as a function of temperature taking into account the void volume of the cell determined with He gas at 77 K and assuming that the amount of He adsorbed is negligible. Results and Discussion The RPF9 crystal structure was solved in the tetragonal system, space group I4/m (Table 1). There are two crystal- lographically independent Ln atoms:one ofthem (Ln1) ison a 4-fold axis and coordinated to four μ3-OH- groups, four O atoms from SO3 - groups, and, in the case of the Pr crystals, a water molecule with occupancy factor lower than one. The other lanthanide atom (Ln2) coordinates to four μ3-OH- groups, two oxygen atoms from two SO3 - groups, and two water molecules, one of them disordered in two positions in Pr crystals. This arrangement gives rise to the formation of hexameric clusters, in which the octahedrally disposed lantha- nide atoms are joined through eight μ3-OH- groups to give rise to a rhombic dodecahedron (Figure 1). This type of cluster, which has already been reported in other lanthanide compounds, is depicted in most of cases with a central oxygen atom coordinated to the six Ln atoms.47-50 There are also some examples in which this central atom does not appear in the cluster.33,40 In the present metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a high electronic density was located at the center of the cluster, which was effectively assigned to an oxygen atom. The structure of three different Pr crystals and one Nd crystal were refined, finding this atom in all of them, and its Table 1.

The population factors refinement indicated total occupancy for this atom in all cases. In order to allow differences in the Ln-O distances and at the same time to study the possibility that the high thermal parameter values for the central oxygen are due to pseudosymmetry effects (they are positioned on a 4-fold center), the crystal structure for the compounds was also refined in P1, in the primitive cell with parameters a = 17.839 A˚ , b = 17.839 A˚ , c = 11.988 A˚ , R = 109.63, β = 109.63, γ = 123.26, and cell volume = 2255.7 A˚ 3 resulting from applying the matrix (-0.5a -0.5b - 0.5c; -0.5a -0.5b þ0.5c; b) to the tetragonal cell. The results of these refinements confirmed the occupancy obtained for this atom in the I4/m space group and showed that effectively this oxygen atom position is slightly shifted from the rhombic dodecahedron center,bearing a considerable anisotropyinthe direction in which (as we will see later) the hydrogen atom could be situated. Oxygen or Hydroxyl Group?. Another matter related to the presence of central oxygen in the hydroxo cluster is the chemical nature of this atom. All papers reporting this type of hexanuclear Ln cluster with a central oxygen atom indicate that this is an O2- anion. A exception is LnPF-3,51 a MOF previously prepared in our group with 2,6-naphtha- lenedisulfonate as ligand and with framework composition [Nd5L3(OH)9(H2O)4]. In LnPF-3, the oxygen atom is clearly identified as OH- not only on the basis of the structural data but also on the electrical neutrality. Regarding to the charge balancing in RPF9, in the H5L ligand, there are five acidic hydrogen atoms, four of them coming from the sulfonate groups and the fifth from one phenolic group.52 If the central oxygen atom were an O2-, all the ligands should be HL4-, if it were a hydroxyl group, there should coexist HL4- and L5- species, and in the absence of this atom, all the ligands should be in the L5- form. Under our synthesis conditions (pH ≈8), the major protonation state of the ligand is L5-, being difficult to find all the ligands as HL4- species. This makes possible the presence of a hydroxyl group instead of an O2- ion. We therefore consider that the obtained compound composition could be [Ln6(OH)9(HL)(L)(H2O)y] (Ln = La, Pr, and Nd; 8 < y < 9), with one-half of the calixarene molecules monoprotonated. The presence of a hydrogen atom in the OH- central group is also sterically feasible. In LnPF-3,51 the hydrogen atom is positioned along one of the Ln-O longest distance (Table 2). In the RPF9 case, the interatomic Ln-μ6-O distances are symmetrically related in the tetragonal cell. However, the results of the P1 refine- ments for all the crystals demonstrate that a hydrogen atom could be accommodated inside the cluster and placed along one of these O-Ln longest distances, which also could justify the high anisotropy of this oxygen atom. Additionally, bond valence calculations also support the assignment of the central O atom as a hydroxyl group. With the bond valence method,53 the formal oxidation state of an atom in a crystal is calculated according to valence-sum rule: Vi = P jνij. The parameter νij is the bond valence value, and it is related to the bond length between nearest-neighboring atoms i and j (dij). It has the expression νij = e(Rij-d ij)/b; b is a constant54 with value 0.37 A˚ , Rij is known as the bond- valence parameter, and it is calculated for each element in a given oxidation state. We have performed the calculations with the Rij values calculated for lanthanide compounds by Breese and O’Keeffe55 and by Trzesowska et al.56 We have carried out the bond valence sum calculations of the central oxygen atom with the RPF9 crystal data, as well as with other reported compounds in which an μn-O atom is present, 57-61 either as O2- or as OH-.The bond valence sum values of the RPF9 compound are in the same range as those of the LnPF-3 compound and other reported μn-OH- groups and lower than those corresponding to other reported μ6-O2- atoms (see Table 3). On the other hand, attempts to obtain RPF9 with smaller lanthanides under the current synthesis conditions only gave Figure 1. Representation (top left) of the real coordination polyhedra on the Ln atoms, view (top right) of the structure along the a axis and projection of one double layer in the ab plane, ORTEP representation (bottom left; 50% probability) of the Ln and O atoms in the cluster and their representation as rhombic dodecahedron, and perspective view (bottom right) of a double layer (water molecules are omitted for clarity) and its topological representation. Article Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 1, 2010 131 a few crystals of the Yb compound. The crystal structure showed that the Yb compound belongs also to the RPF9 family but in this case without any electron density at the center of the cluster, the formula being thus [Yb6(OH)8- L2(H2O)8] with all the ligand molecules completely deproto- nated (L5-). All in all, we do not rule out the possible existence of an O2- anion, but we opt for the presence of a hydroxyl group inside the RPF9 clusters, as it is in LnPF-3, or even the coexistence of both, depending on a narrow pH value synthesis range. In the new RPF9 MOFs, the usual calixarene up-down “bilayer” arrangement is maintained, and the calixarene molecules are bonded to each other through the hexanuclear Ln clusters. Each [Ln6(OH)9] cluster joins eight sulfonato- calixarene ligands through the SO3 - groups. Thus, one sulfonate oxygen atom is bonded to the axial Ln1 atom, another to an equatorial Ln2, and the third remains uncoor- dinated. The hydroxo-lanthanide clusters located in the ab plane are joined to each other through the calixarene anions, up and down this plane. This arrangement gives rise to the formation of double layers with intersecting channels (Figure 1), forming cavities with a maximum height of 11.87 A˚ (distance between calixarene molecules) and maximum width of 8.32 A˚ (distance between clusters). The double layers stacks along the c direction in an AB sequence, not allowing any channel along this direction. The topology of the double layers is of the Al2Os type, binodal 8 and 4 connected, the clusters being the 8-connected centers and the calixarene anions the 4-connected nodes. The point symbol of this network is (420 3 68)(46)2, (Figure 1, bottom right). RPF9 is one of the few examples of sulfonate-based MOFs with isolated inorganic SBUs. The La, Pr, and Nd RPF9 compounds were obtained as pure phases. In Figure 2, the Rietveld refinements for these compounds are shown. The differences in the intensity of the experimental patterns might be attributed to the presence of absorbed water molecules inside the channels of the struc- ture. These water molecules are responsible for the first mass loss observed in the thermogravimetry (TG) curves. The loss of these water molecules has an influence on the structure. A variable-temperature X-ray powder diffraction study was carried out with the Nd-RPF9 sample. As it can be seen in Figure 3, as the sample is heated, the relative intensity of the peaks varies, due to the progressive loss of the adsorbed molecules. Finally, a phase transition is observed when the sample is heated above 125 C. The high-temperature pow- der pattern could be indexed in the tetragonal system with the following parameters: a = b = 11.600 A˚ , c = 28.276 A˚ ; cell volume = 3793.8 A˚ 3. Theseparametersare quitesimilarto those of the original structure, suggesting that after the water molecule evaporate, the rest of the framework should remain without significant changes. The powder pattern of the new crystalline phase, however, is not of sufficient quality to refine the atomic positions in the new cell. The second step in the TG curve at ∼240 C corresponds to the loss of the coordinated water molecules. The total decomposition of the framework, with the loss of the organic part, begins above 350 C. Given that the framework remains intact after evacuation of the solvent molecules, the sorption properties of the Nd-RPF9 material have been tested. First, a nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm was performed at 77 K in the relative pressure range 10-6 to 1 atm. The apparent surface area was calculated with these data, obtaining the low BET area value of 13.45 m2 g-1. Despite this disappoint- ing value, sorption isotherms were carried out with H2, CO2, and CH4, and for a better comparison, these measurements were performed at 304 K and high pressures. These three isotherms are compared in Figure 4. Despite the low nitrogen sorption exhibited by the material, RPF-9 shows a high adsorption of hydrogen, with an uptake of 2.12 mmol3 g-1 at Table 2.

P = 20 atm, while the adsorption amounts of CO2 and CH4 are 0.92 mmol3 g-1 and 0.24 mmol3 g-1, respectively. These results show that RPF-9 could act as a H2 absorber due to its high selectivity for this gas, compared with CO2 or CH4 adsorption. The new RPF9 materials have been evaluated as hetero- geneous catalysts. In previous work, we have studied the activity of several rare-earth polymeric frameworks as redox heterogeneous catalysts.44,62-65 For this purpose, the se- lected substrate was methyl phenyl sulfide, which is an appropriate molecule to be used as a model in test reactions. From the comparison of the activity of different RPF families previously reported, we could conclude that for the reaction to take place, an induction period is needed to form the active intermediate species. Furthermore, this species could also be identified as a Ln-peroxo species on the basis of spectroscopic studies.64,65 Following with this systematic comparison of the catalytic activity of our fami- lies of compounds, we have also evaluated the possibilities of the here-reported compounds, under similar reaction condi- tions. In the case here presented, the RPF9 new materials exhibit an open-framework, which together with the high nuclearity of the inorganic SBUs makes these compounds good candidates to be used as heterogeneous catalysts. Thus, the three La, Pr, and Nd RPF9 compounds have been tested as catalysts for the oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide (Table 4). The catalysts were reused at least in three consecutive cycles. As it can be seen in Figure 5, where the kinetic curves are represented, in all three cases an increase in the activity is observed after the first reaction cycle. As explained above, this is attributed to the need for an induction period for the formation of the active intermediate, postulated to be an Ln- peroxo species. Thus, in the subsequent cycles, the activity was enhanced, achieving high values of conversion in short periods of time. It is worth pointing out the low amount of the catalyst needed, with a high ratio of substrate to metal (1000:1), and therefore, high values of TOF are obtained. In Table 5, the obtained results are compared with those of the other reported rare earth materials, as well as with the corresponding oxides, showing the good activity evidenced by the RPF9 new materials. After the reaction cycle, the integrity of the catalysts was checked by PXRD. The mate- rial was confirmed to be intact. Conclusions In conclusion, a new family of rare-earth polymeric frame- works has been obtainedin whichdiscretehydroxolanthanide clusters act as SBUs, and they are joined by p-sulfonatocalix- [4]arene ligands.
