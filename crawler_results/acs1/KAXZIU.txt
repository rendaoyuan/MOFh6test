Complex 1 exhibits a two-dimensional structure with left- and right-handed helical chains arranged alternately. Complex 2 displays an intricate two-dimensional framework containing three layers with a 3,4,7-connected topology. It is notable that tbi2− takes on ﬁve diﬀerent coordination modes in 2. Complex 3 presents a 3D 3,4-connected network with a point symbol of (63)2(64·82)2(63·83). The structure of complex 4 is a self-penetrating 3D 3,4,8-connected framework with left- and right-handed helical chains arranged alternately. Complex 5 shows a 3D pillar-layered framework, which can be simpliﬁed as a 3,4,5-connected 3D topology with a Schläﬂi symbol of (53)(52·62·7·9)(55·62·72·8). Moreover, the investigation of photoluminescence properties reveals that complexes 1−5 show diﬀerent ﬂuorescent behaviors. ■INTRODUCTION Metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) are very attractive not only for their potential applications in gas storage and separation, chemical and biological sensing, photochemical areas, magnet- ism, and catalysis but also for their intriguing variety of architectures and captivating topologies.1 The rational selection of metal centers and organic ligands with suitable shape, functionality, and ﬂexibility plays a crucial role in synthesizing MOFs with versatile structures and desired properties.2 Up to now, a large number of rigid and long ﬂexible bidentate N- donor ligands have been employed extensively as the bridging linkers and terminal ligands in the construction of MOFs.3 However, reports of MOFs constructed from ﬂexible tridentate ligands are relatively rare.4 Hence, we synthesized a ﬂexible tripodal ligand, 1,3,5-tris(triazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethyl- benzene (tttmb), with an aromatic core and three triazole arms rotating freely. tttmb can adopt cis,trans,trans- and cis,cis,cis-conformations with various torsion angles through bending of the ﬂexible methylene groups. Moreover, three triazole groups of tttmb can act as six potential coordination nodes. Remarkably, three methyl groups on the central phenyl ring can greatly enhance the electron donation ability of the ligand and do not signiﬁcantly increase the steric hindrance, promoting the coordination ability of tttmb. The above features reveal that tttmb is a good candidate for the syntheses of intriguing MOFs with diverse structures and speciﬁc top- ologies.5 In addition, polycarboxylate organic groups have been witnessed to be excellent structural contributors for their various coordination modes.6 The employment of mixed ligands of N-donor ligands and polycarboxylates would enrich the versatility of coordination complexes.7 On the basis of the above considerations, by introducing ﬁve polycarboxylates with diﬀerent geometric shapes as auxiliary ligands into the Cd(II)- tttmb synthesis system, ﬁve novel metal−organic frameworks, n a m e l y , { [ C d ( t t t m b ) ( a t c ) ] · 1 . 5 H 2 O } n ( 1 ) , { [ C d 5 ( t t t m b ) 2 ( t b i ) 5 ( H 2 O ) 4 ] · 2 H 2 O } n ( 2 ) , { [ C d 3 ( t t t m b ) 2 ( b d c ) 3 ( H 2 O ) 3 ] · 0 . 5 H 2 O } n ( 3 ) , {[Cd2(tttmb)2(btc)Cl]·3H2O}n (4), and {[Cd2(tttmb)2(btec)- (H2O)3]·H2O}n (5) (H2atc = 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylic acid, H2tbi = 5-tert-butylisophthalic acid, H2bdc = 1,4-benzenedi- carboxylic acid, H3btc = 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic acid, and H4btec = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid), were synthe- sized. The structural and topological analyses of these complexes, as well as the eﬀects of tttmb and carboxylates on the structures of MOFs, have been discussed in detail. Moreover, the ﬂuorescence properties of complexes 1−5 have been investigated in the solid state at room temperature.

Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that 1 crystallizes in monoclinic space group P21/c. As shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Informaiton), the Cd(II) ion is seven- coordinated by ﬁve carboxylic oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O2B, O3A, O4A) from three atc2−anions and two nitrogen atoms (N6, N1A) from two tttmb molecules. The Cd−N and Cd−O bond lengths are in the ranges of 2.3009−2.4731 and 2.2787− 2.4709 Å, which are similar to those in other cadmium complexes.10 The atc2−anions act as a μ3-bridge, in which one carboxylate group adopts a bidentate chelate mode and the other adopts a μ2-η1:η2 mode. The Cd(II) ions are connected by atc2−to give rise to a 1D double chain with a [Cd2O4] parallelogram along the b axis (Figure 1a). The tttmb adopts the cis,trans,trans-conformation with Ndonor···N−Csp 3···Csp 3 torision angles of −135.152°, −139.042°, and 175.288° as shown in Scheme 1. Two triazole groups on the same side of the benzene ring coordinate with Cd(II) ions. Meanwhile, the third triazole group on the other side does not participate in the coordination. The tttmb molecules are connected by Cd(II) ions to form fascinating left- and right-handed helical chains with a pitch of 12.4231 Å corresponding to the length of the b axis (Figure 1b). Furthermore, the 1D Cd(II)/atc2−double chains connect left- and right-handed helical chains to form a 2D network. If the [Cd2O4] parallelograms are simpliﬁed as 6- connected nodes, and tttmb and atc2−anions serve as linkers, the framework of 1 can be simpliﬁed as a 6-connected topology with a Schläﬂi symbol of (36·46·53) as shown in Figure 1c. Crystal Structure of {[Cd5(tttmb)2(tbi)5(H2O)4]·2H2O}n (2). As shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), there are ﬁve independent Cd(II) ions. It can be clearly seen that Cd1 displays a distorted octahedral coordination geometry, which is provided by one nitrogen atom from one tttmb molecule, four oxygen atoms from four diﬀerent tbi2−anions, and one oxygen atom from one water molecule. Cd2 is seven-coordinated by one nitrogen atom from one tttmb molecule and six oxygen atoms from tbi2−anions. Cd3 adopts a distorted octahedral coordination environment, which is completed by three oxygen atoms from three diﬀerent tbi2−anions and one oxygen atom aﬀorded by one water molecule located at the equatorial plane and one oxygen atom from one tbi2−anion and one nitrogen atom from one tttmb molecule at the axial positions. Cd4 possesses a slightly distorted octahedral coordination geometry, ligated by two nitrogen atoms from two diﬀerent tttmb molecules, two oxygen atoms from one chelating tbi2−anion, one oxygen atom from one tbi2−anion and one oxygen atom from one water molecule. Cd5 is seven-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two diﬀerent tttmb molecules, four oxygen atoms from two diﬀerent chelating tbi2−anions, and Figure 1.

Five Diﬀerent Coordination Modes of tttmb Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg3000729 | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 2435−2444 2437 one oxygen atom from one water molecule. The Cd−N and Cd−O bond lengths are in the ranges of 2.257−2.452 and 2.172−2.629 Å, which are similar to those in other cadmium complexes.11 Remarkably, tbi2−anions display ﬁve diﬀerent coordination modes in 2 as shown in Figure 2a, which is rare in other carboxylate complexes.12 Six carboxylate groups from six tbi2− anions adopt type I, II, and III coordination modes and coordinate Cd1, Cd2, and Cd3 to give rise to a trinuclear [Cd3(COO)6] unit. The three Cd(II) ions in the Cd(II) clusters produce a triangle with Cd1···Cd2, Cd2···Cd3, and Cd3···Cd1 distances of 3.8546, 3.7913, and 4.3823 Å, Figure 2.

Color code: black ball, 3-connected tttmb; green ball, 4-connected tttmb; yellow ball, [Cd3(COO)6] trinuclear unit. Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg3000729 | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 2435−2444 2438 respectively. The trinuclear [Cd3(COO)6] units are linked by two types of tbi2−anions (type I, type II) along the b axis and further bridged by tbi2−anions (type III) along the a axis to form a 2D Cd(II)/ tbi2−layer on the ab plane (Figure 2b). The tbi2−anions displaying the type IV and type V coordination modes connect Cd4 and Cd5 alternately to produce parallel arranged 1D chains as shown in Figure 2c. Interestingly, tttmb adopting the cis,trans,trans-conformation has two diﬀerent coordination modes: II-tttmb with Ndonor···N−Csp3···Csp3 torsion angles of −19.993°, 131.686°, and 121.009° links four metal ions (Cd1, Cd3, Cd4, Cd4A) by the 1,1′,2,3-triazole nitrogen atoms. III-tttmb with Ndonor···N−Csp3···Csp3 torsion angles of −13.502°, 122.802°, and 100.941° links three metal ions (Cd2, Cd5, Cd5A) through the 1′,2,3-triazole nitrogen atoms (Scheme 1). II-tttmb and III-tttmb connect parallel arranged 1D chains and the 2D Cd(II)/tbi2−layer to form a 2D sandwich structure containing three layers, as shown in Figure 2d. Furthermore, topological analysis is carried out for the complicated network of 2. The trinuclear [Cd3(COO)6] units are simpliﬁed as 7-connected nodes. Cd4 and Cd5 are simpliﬁed as 7-connected nodes. II-tttmb and III-tttmb are deﬁned as 4- and 3-connected nodes, respectively. tbi2−anions serve as linkers. The 2D three-layer framework of 2 can be simpliﬁed as a 3,4,7-connected topology with a Schläﬂi symbol of (4·54·6)(52·63·7)(52·63·8)(52·6)(49·55·66·7) (Figure 2d). Crystal Structure of {[Cd3(tttmb)2(bdc)3(H2O)3]· 0.5H2O}n(3). Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that 3 crystallizes in the triclinic system and exhibits a 3D framework. As depicted in Figure S3 (Supporting Information), Cd1 adopts a distorted octahedral coordination environment, which is completed by three oxygen atoms from two bdc2−anions and one oxygen atom aﬀorded by one water molecule located at the equatorial plane and two nitrogen atoms from two tttmb molecules at the axial positions. Cd2 and Cd3 ions with similar coordination environments are seven- coordinated by one oxygen atom from a coordinated water molecule, four oxygen atoms from two bdc2−anions, and two nitrogen atoms arising from two diﬀerent tttmb molecules in a distorted pentagonal bipyramid coordination geometry. The distances of Cd−N are 2.290−2.345 Å, while the Cd−O bond lengths range from 2.284 to 2.475 Å. In 3, tttmb adopts the cis,trans,trans-conformation with two diﬀerent Ndonor···N−Csp 3···Csp 3 torsion angles of 17.100°, 18.142°, −10.507° and −3.846°, 34.025°, 1.260°, respectively. tttmb coordinates with Cd(II) ions to form 1D distorted T- shaped chains (Cd/tttmb chain) (Figure 3a). bdc2−anions exhibit two kinds of coordination modes. One is a bis-bidentate chelate mode, and the other displays a bidentate chelate mode and a monodentate coordination mode. bdc2−anions connect Cd(II) ions to generate 1D zigzag chains (Cd/bdc2−chain) (Figure 3b). The interlaced connection of Cd/tttmb and Cd/ bdc2−chains constructs the 3D framework by sharing Cd(II) ions. To further understand the structure, topological analysis is performed on 3. As discussed above, tttmb can be regarded as a 3-connected node, bdc2−can serve as a linker, and Cd(II) can be treated as a 4-connected node. Such connectivity repeats inﬁnitely to give a 3D 3,4-connected topology with the (63)2(64·82)2(63·83) symbol (Figure 3c). Figure 3. (a) 1D distorted T-shaped chain based on tttmb and Cd(II) ions.

Growth Des. 2012, 12, 2435−2444 2439 Crystal Structure of {[Cd2(tttmb)2(btc)Cl]·3H2O}n (4). As depicted in Figure 4a, there are two independent Cd(II) ions in 4. Cd1 is ﬁve-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N1, N10) from two tttmb molecules, two chelating carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O2), and one Cl−anion. Cd2 displays a distorted octahedral coordination geometry, ligated by three nitrogen atoms (N6C, N18A, N15B) from three tttmb molecules and three carboxylate oxygen atoms (O3, O4, O6A) from btc3−. In 4, tttmb adopt the cis,trans,trans- conformation with two types of Ndonor···N−Csp3···Csp3 torsion angles of −139.179°, 134.283°, −158.99° and 110.214°, −168.448°, 127.064°, respectively. tttmb molecules serving as μ3-bridges link Cd(II) ions to generate a 2D Cd(II)/tttmb network on the bc plane (Figure 4b). Obviously, the 2D network shows an undulated shape with left- and right-handed helical chains arranged alternately. Both helical pitches are 21.054 Å, corresponding to the length of the c axis. Each btc3− acts as a μ3-bridge linking three Cd(II) ions, in which two carboxylate groups at the 2,4-positions adopt the bidentate chelate mode and the carboxylate group at the 1-position adopts the monodentate coordination mode. Two carboxylate groups at the 1-position and two carboxylate groups at the 2- position from two btc3−anions link two Cd2 ions to form a dinuclear Cd2 unit as illustrated in Figure 4c. Furthermore, btc3−anions serving as bridging pillars connect the 2D Cd(II)/ tttmb layers to generate a 3D pillar-layered framework. Better insight into such an elegant framework can be obtained by the topological method. The tttmb, Cd1 ions, and dinuclear Cd2 units can be simpliﬁed as 3-, 4-, and 8-connected nodes, respectively. btc3−serves as a linker. Hence, the 3D network of 4 can be described as a 3,4,8-connected topology with a point symbol of (4·62)2(66)(42·620·86). Careful inspection of such a framework suggests that the net is self- penetrating. As shown in Figure 4d, each six-membered shortest circuit is catenated by another rod of the same network. To the best of our knowledge, the 8-connected self- penetrating structure has scarcely been reported up to now. Crystal Structure of {[Cd2(tttmb)2(btec)(H2O)3]·H2O}n (5). Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis reveals that 5 is a 3D framework. As shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), Cd(II) centers (Cd1 and Cd2) locate in two types of coordination environments. Cd1 is six-coordinated in a slightly distorted octahedral coordination environment by three oxygen atoms (O4, O5A, and O6A) from two diﬀerent betc4−groups and three nitrogen atoms (N3, N6C, and N12) arising from three diﬀerent tttmb molecules. Cd2 displays a slightly distorted octahedral geometry, which is provided by three oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O12) from coordinated water molecules and three nitrogen atoms (N9A, N15A, N18) from three diﬀerent tttmb molecules. The Cd−N bond lengths vary from 2.290 to 2.373 Å, while the Cd−O bond lengths are in the range of 2.318−2.543 Å. In 5, tttmb adopts the cis,cis,cis- conformation with two types of Ndonor···N−Csp 3···Csp 3 torsion angles. As shown in Scheme 1, three triazole groups on the same side of the benzene ring coordinate with three Cd(II) ions. The tttmb molecules with Ndonor···N−Csp 3···Csp 3 torsion angles of 34.082°, 141.972°, and −38.931° connect Cd2 ions to form a [Cd2(tttmb)2] quadrilateral unit with a Cd2···Cd2 Figure 4.

Meanwhile, the tttmb molecules with Ndonor···N−Csp 3···Csp 3 torsion angles of −49.994°, −146.404°, and 148.305° link Cd1 ions to construct left- and right-handed Cd1/tttmb helical chains (Figure 5b). Both helical pitches are 11.340 Å, corresponding to the length of the b axis. Furthermore, the [Cd2(tttmb)2] units connect left- and right-handed helical chains by the coordination interactions between Cd1/Cd2 and tttmb to build a 2D Cd(II)/tttmb network. betc4−anions adopting the bidentate coordination mode connect Cd1 ions to generate a 1D zigzag chain (Figure 5c), which supports the 2D Cd(II)/tttmb networks to construct a 3D pillar-layered framework. Remarkably, there are π−π stacking interactions (3.6643 and 3.8031 Å) between benzene rings of the betc4−and tttmb. As depicted in Figure 5d, topological analysis is performed on 5. Each [Cd2(tttmb)2] unit is constructed from two Cd1 ions and two tttmb molecules; hence, the [Cd2(tttmb)2] unit can be treated as a 4-connector. Each Cd1 ion links two tttmb Figure 5.

Growth Des. 2012, 12, 2435−2444 2441 molecules, two Cd1 ions, and one [Cd2(tttmb)2] unit; hence, Cd1 can be simpliﬁed as a 5-connector. The rest of the tttmb molecules can be simpliﬁed as 3-connected nodes, and betc4− anions serve as linkers. According to the simpliﬁcation principle, the resulting structure of complex 5 is a trinodal 3,4,5-connected topology with a Schläﬂi symbol of (53)- (52·62·7·9)(55·62·72·8). Eﬀect of tttmb and Carboxylates on the MOFs’ Structures. The three methyl groups on the central phenyl ring can greatly enhance the electron-donating ability of the tttmb ligand, causing the six potential coordination nodes to actively participate in coordination. From the structural description above, the ﬂexible tripodal ligand tttmb adopts cis,trans,trans- and cis,cis,cis-conformations with diﬀerent Ndonor···N−Csp 3···Csp 3 torsion angles (Table 2) and shows ﬁve diﬀerent coordination modes in 1−5 as shown in Scheme 1. In 1, tttmb molecules adopting the I-tttmb coordination mode (μ2-bridge) link Cd(II) ions to construct left- and right-handed helical chains. tttmb molecules adopt two diﬀerent cis,tran- s,trans-conformational coordination modes (II-tttmb, III-tttmb) in 2. II-tttmb acts as a μ4-bridge to link four metal ions by 1,1′,2,3-triazole nitrogen atoms. Meanwhile, III-tttmb acts as a μ3-bridge to link three metal ions through 1′,2,3-triazole nitrogen atoms. It is remarkable that these two coordination modes were the ﬁrst reported.13 II-tttmb and III-tttmb connect parallel arranged 1D chains and the 2D Cd(II)/tbi2−layer to form a 2D sandwich structure containing three layers. In 3 and 4, tttmb molecules take on the cis,trans,trans-conformation with diﬀerent Ndonor···N−Csp 3···Csp 3 torsion angles (IV-tttmb). The tttmb molecules coordinate with Cd(II) ions to form 1D distorted T-shaped chains in 3. For 4, tttmb molecules acting as a μ3-bridge link Cd(II) ions to generate left- and right-handed helical chains. The helical chains are connected to form a 2D undulated network by sharing Cd(II) ions. In 5, tttmb molecules in the cis,cis,cis-transformation connect central metal ions to build a 2D Cd(II)/tttmb structure with left- and right-handed helical chains. As state above, tttmb molecules can serve as 2-, 3-, and 4-connected bridges. In 1, 4, and 5, tttmb molecules coordinate with Cd(II) ions to form a helical structure. The three triazole arms of tttmb can rotate freely when coordinating with central metal ions due to the ﬂexible nature of the three methylene groups. Meanwhile, tttmb takes on rich coordination modes, which can greatly beautify and enrich the MOFs’ structures. We have selected ﬁve polycarboxylates as auxiliary ligands. The carboxylate anions have key roles in building the structures of the resultant complexes. Through varying the geometric shape of the carboxylate anions, ﬁve Cd(II) complexes with diﬀerent structures were successfully obtained. In this work, we ﬁrst selected H2atc and H2tbi with a rigid spacer and an angle of 120° between the two carboxylic groups as the coligands. In 1, the symmetrical dicarboxylic atc2−ions acting as μ3-bridge linkers connect Cd(II) ions to give rise to 1D double chains containing [Cd2O4] parallelograms. The Cd(II)/atc2−chains connect alternate left- and right-handed Cd(II)/tttmb helical Table 2.

Photoluminescences of free ligands and complexes 1−5 in the solid state at room temperature. Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg3000729 | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 2435−2444 2442 chains further to form a 2D structure. In 2, the symmetrical dicarboxylic tbi2−exhibits strong coordination ability because the 5-tert-butyl group can enhance the electron-donating ability of the benzene ring. Hence, the tbi2−anions show ﬁve diﬀerent coordination modes, which may result in the peculiar coordination modes of tttmb and the 2D 3,4,7-connected three-layer structure for 2. When H2bdc with a rigid spacer and an angle of 180° between the two carboxylic groups acting as a linker is introduced into the synthetic procedure, the 3D 3,4- connected structure of 3 is obtained. The asymmetric H3btc is used in 4, which acts as a bridging pillar to connect Cd(II)/ tttmb layers to further generate a 3D self-penetrating 3,4,8- connected topology. In 5, two adjacent carboxylate groups of betc4−in the bidentate chelating mode bridge Cd(II) ions to form 1D zigzag chains, which support 2D Cd(II)/tttmb networks to generate a 3D pillar-layered framework. Remark- ably, the steric hindrance of the two uncoordinated carboxylate groups and π−π stacking interactions between benzene rings of the betc4−and tttmb may be the key reasons for formation of the cis,cis,cis-conformation of tttmb. It can be observed that the polycarboxylate coligands have an important eﬀect on the structures of the complexes and the coordination modes of tttmb. XRD Patterns and Thermal Analyses. To conﬁrm the phase purity of these complexes, the PXRD patterns were recorded for 1−5, and they were comparable to the corresponding simulated patterns calculated from the single- crystal diﬀraction data (Figure S5, Supporting Information), indicating a pure phase of each bulky sample. The thermal stabilities were investigated as shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of 1 shows a one-step weight loss process from 119 to 344 °C, corresponding to the loss of free water molecules (observed, 4.02%; calculated, 3.73%). Then the framework begins to decompose. According to the elemental analysis and thermal analysis of 2, the formula is estimated as 2·2H2O. The TGA curve of 2 shows preliminary weight loss in the range of 100− 203 °C consistent with the losses of six water molecules (observed, 4.56%; calculated, 4.33%), and then a plateau region follows until 2 is heated to 347 °C. The further weight losses represent the decomposition of the anhydrous compound. For 3, a gradual loss between 30 and 230 °C is attributed to the release of free water molecules (observed, 4.37%; calculated, 3.89%). Then no obvious weight loss is observed until the decomposition of the framework occurs at 350 °C. For 4, there is an initial weight loss at 86−280 °C, which arises from the loss of three water molecules (observed, 4.41%; calculated, 4.33%). The further weight losses represent the decomposition of the anhydrous compound. As for 5, the weight loss from 30 to 243 °C is consistent with the loss of a lattice water molecule and three coordinated water molecules (observed 5.14%; calculated, 5.65%). Then the framework begins to decompose. Photoluminescence Properties. Coordination complexes with d10 metal centers and conjugated organic linkers are promising candidates for photoactive materials with potential applications.14 Hence, the solid-state photoluminescence properties of complexes 1−5, together with the free tttmb and carboxylic acids, were investigated at room temperature (Figure 6). The free tttmb, H2tbi, H2bdc, H3btc, and H4btec show intense emissions bands at 303 nm (λex = 282 nm), 317 nm (λex = 260 nm), 386 nm (λex = 334 nm), 350 nm (λex = 321 nm), and 368 nm (λex = 313 nm), respectively. H2atc does not present any luminescence at room temperature.15Obviously, the ﬂuorescent emission bands of 1 (λem = 303 nm, λex = 282 nm) can be attributed to the intraligand charge transitions of tttmb due to the emission band being similar to that of the free tttmb. For 2 (λem = 429 nm, λex = 331 nm), the emission band is largely red-shifted (112 nm) compared with that of the free H2tbi. This result indicates that the ﬂuorescence of 2 may be attributed to a mixture characteristic of intraligand and ligand- to-ligand charge transitions, as reported for other d10 metal complexes with N-donor ligands.16 3, 4, and 5 give ﬂuorescence centers at 438 nm (λex = 330 nm), 431 nm (λex = 376 nm), and 443 nm (λex = 379 nm), respectively. Furthermore, the emission bands of 3, 4, and 5 present red shifts (52, 81, and 75 nm) in contrast to those of the free carboxylate ligands (H2bdc, H3btc, and H4betc), which may be assigned to ligand- to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) character.17 The weak emission band of complex 4 is probably attributed to the quenching eﬀect of the chloride ion.18 It is possible that the coordination of carboxylate groups to the Cd(II) ion results in a red shift of the emission peak.19 From the above discussion, complexes 1−5 with the same metal center and N-donor ligand show diﬀerent photoluminescence behaviors, which are probably attributed to the diﬀerences in the features of polycarboxylate coligands and the structures of MOFs. ■CONCLUSIONS In summary, ﬁve novel Cd(II) metal−organic frameworks with a 1,3,5-tris(triazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (tttmb) ﬂexible tripodal block have been synthesized and characterized. The diﬀerently structural and topological motifs of complexes 1−5 demonstrate the ﬂexible tttmb ligand is an excellent structural contributor for MOFs. Moreover, the introductions of the polycarboxylates as auxiliary ligands have an eﬀect on the coordination modes of tttmb and enrich the diversity of the structure. In addition, the photoluminescence behaviors of the Cd(II) complexes are diﬀerent. The results further highlight that the photoluminescent behavior has a close relationship with the features of polycarboxylate coligands and the structures of MOFs. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information X-ray crystallographic ﬁles in CIF format, selected bond lengths and bond angles, powder X-ray patterns, thermal analyses for 1−5, and coordination environments of Cd(II) ions in 1, 2, 3, and 5.
