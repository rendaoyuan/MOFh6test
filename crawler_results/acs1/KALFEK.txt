China §School of Chemistry, University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia b S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The three-dimensional crystalline porous me- talorganic framework [Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)]n (1) [1,3-H2BDC = 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid; tpcb = tetrakis(4-pyridyl)cyclobutane] was used to separate a solid mixture of naphthalene and anthracene at room tempera- ture via selective adsorption of naphthalene. The process involved a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. The guest naphthalene molecules could be exchanged with ethanol, and the host, 1, could be regenerated by removal of the guest ethanol molecules. P orous metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are the focus of considerable interest because of their potential applications in the areas of separation, adsorption, catalysis, and molecular recog- nition.16 In much of this work, the aim has been to create robust materials that are able to retain an open-type network throughout cycles of sorption and desorption of guest molecules. The size and shape of the framework channels and voids allow the possibility of discrimination in regard to the types of guest that may be sorbed into the network, and thus, such materials are able to act as molecular sieves.46Todate,muchoftheworkexploringtheabilityofMOFsto separate mixtures relates to the separation of gas- or liquid-phase compounds.4,5 It has recently been demonstrated that porous MOFs may be employed in the separation of species such as fullerenes, polycyclic dyes, organosulfur compounds, and aromatic hydrocar- bons from solutions.6 To the best of our knowledge, no examples of the utilization of porous MOFs in the separation of solid mixtures have been reported. Naphthalene and anthracene are important raw chemicals that are produced in the coal tar industry and widely used as pre- cursors in the synthesis of a variety of products, including pesticides and synthetic dyes. In industry, naphthalene and anthracene are normally puriﬁed using a distillation or crystal- lization process; this generally leads to purities of less than 95%.7 These methods usually consume large amounts of energy or solvents. In the laboratory, naphthalene and anthracene can be separated using liquid chromatography.6e This method also re- quires large quantities of eluents. Thus, the separation of naphtha- lene and anthracene in an environmentally friendly manner represents a signiﬁcant challenge. A strategy for the separation of such mixtures that we have been exploring involves selective sorption of one of the compounds in the vapor phase by a porous MOF. In comparison with traditional methods, this process would reduce the energy cost and the amount of eluent used. Herein we report the synthesis of a stable MOF of composi- tion {[Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)] 3 12H2O}n (1 3 12H2O) and its porous guest-free form [Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2- (tpcb)]n (1) and its application in the separation of a solid mixture of naphthalene and anthracene. This process, which involves a single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) transformation, does not lead to the deterioration of the coordination network, allowing the host network to be reused. Green blocks of 1 3 12H2O were hydrothermally prepared from a mixture of NiCl2 3 6H2O, 1,3-H2BDC (2), and tpcb (3) in 86% yield. Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis8 revealed that 1 3 12H2O crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Fdd2. The framework is constructed from [Ni2(μ2-OH2)] units interconnected by the 1,3-BDC and tpcb linkers. A [Ni2(μ2-OH2)] unit with its coordinated carboxylate and pyridyl-based ligands is shown in Figure S1a in the Supporting Information. The Ni centers, which are symmetry-related by a twofold axis, are bridged by a pair of carboxylate anions and a water molecule. The coordination environment of each Ni center is completed by a monodentate carboxylate O atom and a pair of cis-pyridyl N atoms. This results in an octahedral environment for each Ni center. The two noncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms form hydrogen bonds with the bridging water molecule. The complex structure is perhaps best described by consider- ing ﬁrst the network generated by the combination of the [Ni2(μ2-OH2)] units with the 1,3-BDC anions. Each [Ni2(μ2- OH2)] unit is linked to four equivalent units through the bridging BDC ligands. The resulting network of composition [Ni2(μ2-OH2)](1,3-BDC)2 has the topology of the diamond net. The neutral four-connecting ligand tpcb supports this frame- work. Each [Ni2(μ2-OH2)] unit is bound to four separate tpcb ligands and each tpcb ligand is bound to four [Ni2(μ2-OH2)] units within a single adamantane-type unit of the [Ni2(μ2- OH2)](1,3-BDC)2 network, as shown in Figure S1b. Examination of the extended structure reveals inﬁnite chan- nels that extend parallel to the a axis (Figure 1). In 1 3 12H2O, uncoordinated water molecules occupy these channels (Figure S1c,d). The shape of the one-dimensional channels is irregular, with relatively small kite-shaped windows apparent when viewed Received: April 4, 2011 11043 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja203053y |J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 11042–11045 Journal of the American Chemical Society COMMUNICATION along the a axis. These windows open up into larger chambers along the channels. Without guest molecules, the total potential void volume of the open channels in 1 3 12H2O was calculated by PLATON analysis to be 50.9% of the crystal volume (5972 Å3 of the 11 727 Å3 unit cell volume).9 Upon exposure to air over several days, single crystals of 1 3 12H2O gradually lose the uncoordinated water molecules but retain their single-crystal character (Figure S2). Thermogravi- metric analysis (TGA) indicated that 1 is stable up to 218 C (Figure S3). Guest-free crystals of 1 could be obtained by heating crystals of 1 3 12H2O in air at 170 C or under vacuum at 100 C for ∼12 h. Although the loss of the uncoordinated water is accompanied by a contraction of the cell volume from 11 727 Å3 to 11 597 Å3, the framework structure of 1 is essentially un- changed (Figures S1 and S4). The aperture size of 1 is approxi- mately 10.0 Å  6.4 Å. The permanent porosity of 1 was conﬁrmed by N2 sorption measurements at 77 K (Figure S5), which revealed a BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) surface area of 1029 m2 g1 and a pore volume of 0.36 cm3 g1. The stability of this robust porous MOF and the presence of relatively large intraframework voids prompted us to investigate whether the network would be able to exhibit selective adsorption of guest molecules with retention of single-crystal character. Naphthalene and anthracene both have a kinetic diameter of 6.55 Å,6e and on this basis one may reasonably expect both to be able to enter the channels. However, in view of the diﬀerence in the sizes and shapes of these two aromatic molecules, it is also reasonable to expect that they would interact diﬀerently with the host framework. Since both naphthalene and anthracene are able to sublime, we speculated that one of these compounds might be preferentially adsorbed in the vapor phase by 1 when a mixture of anthracene and naphthalene was sealed with 1 in a vessel. To test our hypothesis, we placed a sample of 1 (0.415 g, 0.5 mmol) in one tube (4 cm in length and 0.7 cm in inner diameter) and placed a 1:1 molar ratio mixture of naphthalene (0.256 g, 2 mmol) and anthracene (0.356 g, 2 mmol) in a second tube. These tubes were placed in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂask that was subsequently sealed. After ∼5 h at room temperature, the amount of white powder in the tube containing the naphthalene/anthracene mixture had been visibly reduced. The sample in the tube that originally contained 1 was investigated using single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction. The structure determination indicated the sorption of two naphthalene mol- ecules per Ni2(μ2-OH2) unit (Figure 2). Unlike many examples of guest inclusion in coordination networks, the naphthalene molecules are ordered and well-deﬁned. The crystals are formulated as {[Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)] 3 2C10H8}n, (1 3 2C10H8), which corresponds to a naphthalene uptake of ∼0.309 g/g of 1. The UVvis spectrum further conﬁrmed the formula (Figure S6). We note that there are CH 3 3 3 Cg (π-ring) interactions10 (C9H9 3 3 3 CgC25C30, with H9 3 3 3 CgC25C30 = 2.69 Å and C9 3 3 3 CgC25C30 = 3.57 Å) between the framework of 1 and the naphthalene molecules (Figure S7). We thus presume that the absorption of naphthalene molecules by 1 is driven largely by these CH 3 3 3 Cg interactions. 1 3 2C10H8 is unable to adsorb any further naphthalene, despite the fact that there is an esti- mated void volume that represents 20.3% of the crystal volume (2367 Å3 of the 11 668 Å3 unit cell volume).9 In view of the relatively high void volume, the failure of the network to adsorb additional naphthalene may reﬂect favorable hostguest and guestguest interactions when the crystals are formulated as 1 3 2C10H8. The results of powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) analysis of 1 3 2C10H8 were in agreement with the simulated pattern gener- ated from the single-crystal structure (Figure S8). When super- ﬂuous quantities of 1 were used (more than 0.830 g), the naphthalene in the mixture was completely adsorbed, leaving only anthracene in the second glass tube. The 1H NMR spectrum of the residual white powder in the tube showed chemical shifts at 8.59, 8.09, and 7.53 ppm, indicating the presence of pure anthracene (Figure S9). Chromatography with UV detection (HPLC-UV) measurements on this sample further indicated that no naphthalene was present in this powder and that the purity of the anthracene was 99.5% (Figure S10). Naphthalene/anthra- cene mixtures with other molar ratios (e.g., 1:2 or 2:1) could also be separated by 1 (Figure S11). For the purpose of comparison, we investigated the ability of activated carbon to sorb naphtha- lene under similar conditions. In this experiment, 10 g of activated carbon and naphthalene were used. After absorption for Figure 1. View of the coordination network of 1 3 12H2O along the a axis. All of the guest molecules and hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity. Figure 2.

Soc. 2011, 133, 11042–11045 Journal of the American Chemical Society COMMUNICATION 5 days, the activated carbon was subjected to Soxhlet extraction for 20 h using 100 mL of ethanol. UVvis measurements indicated that 1 g of activated carbon could absorb ∼8 mg of naphthalene (Figure S12). The vapor pressure of naphthalene is higher than that of anthracene at room temperature, so it may be reasonably argued that the preferential uptake of naphthalene over anthracene reﬂects the greater volatility of naphthalene. In order to deter- mine whether the relative volatilities of the aromatic hydrocar- bons were a factor in the selective adsorption, crystals of 1 and solid anthracene were heated in an evacuated ﬂask at 150 C for 10 h. After this time, the weight of 1 had not changed, and single- crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that no anthra- cene had been adsorbed by 1. The UVvis diﬀuse reﬂectance spectrum of these crystals was very similar to that of 1 (Figure S13). These results indicate that 1 is not a suitable host for anthracene and that the coordination network is truly able to discriminate between the aromatic hydrocarbons. Since anthracene and naphthalene have the same kinetic diameter, we assume that the failure of 1 to sorb results from the inability of the larger anthracene molecule to form favorable intermolecular interac- tions with the host network. We note that aromatics such as benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene, which have similar kinetic diameters, can be absorbed by open-framework compounds such as HKUST-111a and MOF-511b simultaneously. Thus, the ability of 1 to selectively sorb aromatics is diﬀerent from that of HKUST-1 and MOF-5.6e The naphthalene sorbed by the coordination network was recovered by soaking 1 3 2C10H8 in ethanol (4  3 mL). After the removal of 1 from the solution, a white precipitate was obtained upon the addition of 20 mL of water to the ethanol solution. The precipitate was separated by ﬁltration and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. 1H NMR analysis of the precipitate showed signals for the naphthalene protons at 7.93 and 7.53 ppm (Figure S9). HPLC-UV measurements conﬁrmed that anthracene was not present in this powder sample; the purity of the naphthalene was 99.1% (Figure S10). In the extraction of naphthalene from 1 3 2C10H8 using ethanol, we found that 1 had sorbed ethanol to form a compound having the formula {[Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3- BDC)2(tpcb)] 3 3.5EtOH}n (1 3 3.5EtOH) (Figures S14 and S15) with retention of single-crystal character. The porous guest-free coordination network 1 could be regenerated by either heating the sample of 1 3 3.5EtOH or placing it under vacuum (Figure S16). All of the sorption and desorption processes involving 1 proceeded with retention of single-crystal character. Investiga- tion of the sorption properties of the regenerated 1 indicated that it was able to sorb more than 90% of its original capacity of naphthalene. Further cycling did not result in further reduction of the capacity. In comparison with each previous cycle, the absorption capacities of 1 in the next ﬁve cycles were 92.3, 91.2, 91.7, 90.8, and 90.2%. Traditionally, solid mixtures of compounds have been sepa- rated using porous MOFs by dissolving the mixtures in appro- priate solvents and immersing the MOFs in the solution. Under these circumstances, preferential sorption of the solute mixture can be achieved.6 As part of the present work, we employed a similar approach to investigate whether we could use 1 to separate a naphthalene/anthracene mixture that had been dis- solved in benzene. Under these circumstances, we found that only benzene molecules were sorbed by 1 to form a compound of composition 1 3 4C6H6 (Figures S17S19). When mesitylene was used as the solvent in place of benzene, the UVvis diﬀuse reﬂectance spectrum indicated that neither solute nor solvent was absorbed by 1 (Figure S13). These results suggest that naphthaleneabsorptionby1isfavoredinthesublimationprocess.We investigated whether 1 could absorb other volatile aromatic species such as ferrocene. Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis indicated that each [Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)] unit can absorb one ferrocene molecule to form {[Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)] 3 FeCp2}n (13FeCp2) (Figures S20S23). In summary, the present work has demonstrated the use of a novel reusable porous coordination polymer in the highly ef- ﬁcient separation of a solid mixture of naphthalene and anthra- cene at ambient temperature in a process that involves a SCSC transition. This separation is the result of a particularly favorable association between the host network and the naphthalene guest molecules. It is anticipated that a similar approach involving porous coordination networks may be employed in order to separate solid mixtures of substances that are able to sublime. We are hopeful that analogues of 1 whose preparations are currently underway in our laboratory may also be useful in the separation of solid mixtures. ’ASSOCIATED CONTENT b S Supporting Information.

The ligand tetrakis(4-pyridyl)-cyclobutane (tpcb) was prepared as reported previously.[1] Other chemicals and reagents were purchased from TCI Co., Ltd. and used as received. The elemental analyses for C, H and N were performed on a Carlo–Erba CHNO–S microanalyzer. The IR spectra were recorded on a Varian 1000 FT–IR spectrometer as KBr disks (4000-400 cm–1). Thermal analysis was performed with a Perkin_Elmer TGA-7 thermogravimetric analyser at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in air. BET surface area was measured by N2 sorption using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system. PXRD were performed using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO MPD system (PW3040/60). 1H NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature on a Varian UNITYplus-400 spectrometer. 1H NMR chemical shifts were referenced to the solvent signal in d6-DMSO. Analytical HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) chromatograms were recorded on Waters 2487 dual-wavelength absorbance detector equipped with a Waters 1525 Binary HPLC pump. UV-Vis absorption and diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrometer. For diffuse reflectance, spectra were recorded with an integrating sphere and were converted from reflection to absorbance by the Kubelka–Munk method. [1] Papaefstathiou, G. S.; MacGillivray, L. R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002, 41, 2070.

The Teflon-lined autoclave was sealed and heated in an oven to 170 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to ambient temperature at a rate of 5°C h-1 to form green blocks of 1. Yield: 0.225 g (86% yield based on Ni). Anal. calcd. for C40H54N4Ni2O21: C, 46.01; H, 5.21; N, 5.37. Found: C, 46.44; H, 4.91; N, 4.97. IR (KBr, cm-1): 3428s, 3039w, 1616s, 1580s, 1558s, 1418m, 1374s, 1268m, 1220m, 1126m, 1084w, 1024w, 976ms, 839s, 782s, 718s, 675m, 555s. Preparation of [Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)]n (1): The crystals of 1·12H2O (1.566 g, 1.5 mmol, combined product from seven Teflon-lined autoclaves) were heated in air at 170 °C or under vacuum at 100 °C for about 12 hours to form crystals of 1 (1.242 g) in 100% yield based on 1·12H2O. Anal. calcd. for C40H30N4Ni2O9: C, 58.02; H, 3.65; N, 6.77. Found: C, 58.36; H, S5 3.43; N, 6.91. IR (KBr, cm-1): 3413w, 3026w, 1615s, 1570s, 1558s, 1513m, 1426m, 1380s, 1221m, 1159w, 1069m, 1024m, 868m, 836s, 748s, 710s, 630m, 553s. Separation of a solid mixture of naphthalene and anthracene by using 1 and formation of {[Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)]·2C10H8}n (1·2C10H8): To two glass tubes (4 cm in length and 0.7 cm in inner diameter) were loaded the crystals of 1 (0.415 g, 0.5 mmol) and a mixture of naphthalene (0.256 g, 2 mmol) and anthracene (0.356 g, 2 mmol), respectively. These tubes were fixed in an Erlenmeyer flask (50 mL) and then the flask was sealed. After about 5 hours at room temperature, 1 absorbed about 0.128 g of naphthalene and transformed to 1·2C10H8. Yield: 0.543 g (100% yield based on 1). Anal. calcd. for C60H46N4Ni2O9: C, 66.45; H, 4.28; N, 5.17. Found: C, 66.13; H, 4.24; N, 4.89. IR (KBr, cm-1): 3416m, 3085m, 2920m, 1617s, 1575s, 1560s, 1481m, 1453s, 1398s, 1331m, 1276w, 1173w, 1072m, 1028m, 983m, 830s, 748s, 722s, 584m. Based on the molecular formula of 1·2C10H8, another sample of 1 (0.415 g, 0.5 mmol) was employed to absorb surplus naphthalene. Finally, all the naphthalene was absorbed by 1 and only anthracene (0.356 g, 100% yield) was in the glass tube. 1H NMR (400 MHz, d6-DMSO) of the residual powder in the glass tube: δ = 8.59 (d, 2H, Ph–H), 8.09 (q, 4H, Ph–H), 7.53 (q, 4H, Ph–H). The 1H NMR spectrum confirmed that the residual powder in the glass tube is pure anthracene. The naphthalene/anthracene mixtures with other molar ratios such as 1:2 or 2:1 (naphthalene (0.128 g, 1 mmol)/anthracene (0.356 g, 0.5 mmol); or naphthalene (0.128 g, 1 mmol)/anthracene (0.089 g, 0.5 mmol)) could also be separated by 1. Extracting of naphthalene from 1·2C10H8 and preparation of {[Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)]·3.5EtOH}n (1·3.5EtOH): The bulk sample of 1·2C10H8 (1.084 g, 1 mmol) was employed and soaked in ethanol (4 × 3 mL). The combined ethanol solution was mixed with H2O (20 mL) and afforded white precipitate immediately. The precipitate was then separated by filtration and finally dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. Yield: 0.233 g (91% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, d6-DMSO) of the precipitate: 7.93 (q, 4H, Ph–H), 7.53 (q, 4H, Ph–H). The 1H NMR of the precipitate matched well with the signals for naphthalene. {[Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)]·3.5EtOH}n (1·3.5EtOH) was obtained from the aforementioned process through a SCSC transformation. Yield: 0.961 g (97% yield based on 1·2C10H8). Anal. calcd. for C47H51N4Ni2O12.5: C, 57.06; H, 5.20; N, 5.66. Found: C, 57.32; H, 5.19; N, 5.78. IR (KBr, cm-1): 3429m, 3086m, 2955w, 1612s, 1577s, 1545s, 1504m, 1453s, S6 1396s, 1220m, 1206w, 1099w, 1021m, 966w, 833s, 743s, 722s, 617m, 553s. Preparation of 1 from 1·3.5EtOH: The crystals of 1·3.5EtOH were heated in air at 170 °C or under vacuum at 100 °C for about 12 hours to form crystals of 1 in 100% yield. Anal. calcd. for C40H30N4Ni2O9: C, 58.02; H, 3.65; N, 6.77. Found: C, 58.22; H, 3.39; N, 6.61. IR (KBr, cm-1): 3411w, 3025w, 1616s, 1570s, 1560s, 1515m, 1427m, 1381s, 1221m, 1160w, 1068m, 1024m, 869m, 835s, 748s, 712s, 633m, 555s. Attempt to separate naphthalene/anthracene mixture in benzene solution by using 1 and formation of {[Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)]·4C6H6}n (1·4C6H6): A mixture of naphthalene (0.256 g, 2 mmol) and anthracene (0.356 g, 2 mmol) was dissolved in benzene to give a colorless solution. Then the crystals of 1 (0.415 g, 0.05 mmol) were added into the solution and afforded 1·4C6H6. Yield: 1.095 g (96% yield based on 1). Anal. calcd. for C64H54N4Ni2O9: C, 67.40; H, 4.77; N, 4.91.

Absorption of ferrocene by using 1 and formation of {[Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)]·FeCp2}n (1·FeCp2): To two glass tubes (4 cm in length and 0.7 cm in inner diameter) were loaded the crystals of 1 (0.415 g, 0.5 mmol) and ferrocene (0.186 g, 1 mmol), respectively. These tubes were fixed in an Erlenmeyer flask (50 mL) and then the flask was heated at 70 °C. After about 5 hours, 1 absorbed about 0.093 g of ferrocene and transformed to 1·FeCp2. Yield: 0.508 g (100% yield based on 1). Anal. calcd. for C50H40FeN4Ni2O9: C, 59.22; H, 3.98; N, 5.52. Found: 58.95; H, 4.21; N, 5.16. IR (KBr, cm-1): 3415m, 3086m, 2918m, 1616s, 1578s, 1561s, 1483m, 1452s, 1400s, 1333m, 1278w, 1174w, 1070m, 1030m, 985m, 833s, 750s, 725s, 586m. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography: single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for the six compounds 1·12H2O, 1, 1·2C10H8, 1·3.5EtOH, 1·4C6H6 and 1·FeCp2 were collected on a Rigaku Mercury CCD diffractometer by using graphite monochromated Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å). Cell parameters were refined by using the program CrystalClear (Rigaku and MSC, version 1.3, 2001). The collected data were reduced by using the program CrystalClear, and an absorption correction (multi-scan) was applied. The reflection data were also corrected for Lorentz and polarization S7 effects. The crystal structures of the six compounds 1·12H2O, 1, 1·2C10H8, 1·3.5EtOH, 1·4C6H6 and 1·FeCp2 were solved by direct methods and refined on F2 by full-matrix least-squares methods with the SHELXL-97 program.[2] For 1·12H2O, the O5–H1w bond length was fixed at 0.80 Å. Because of partial evaporation of the small solvated molecules in 1·12H2O, six water molecules were refined with an occupancy factor of 0.5. For 1, the O5–H1w bond length was fixed at 0.80 Å. In 1 and 1·2C10H8, the temperature factors of three carbon atoms (C14–C16) in one phenyl group are relatively high. Thus, SIMU and DELU restraints were applied in the refinement of temperature factors of the atoms in this phenyl (C13–C18). In 1·2C10H8, SIMU and DELU restraints were also applied in the refinement of temperature factors of the atoms in this phenyl (C21–C30). In the case of 1·3.5EtOH, three carbon atoms of one phenyl group were found to be disordered over two sites with an occupancy factor of 0.35/0.65 for C14/C14′, C15/C15′ and C16/C16′. For 1·3.5EtOH, the occupancy factor of three ethanol molecules were fixed at 0.5 and that of the other one ethanol molecule was fixed at 0.25, the O6–C22 and C21–C22 bond length were fixed at 1.46 Å. For 1·4C6H6, the phenyl rings (C21–C26, C27–C32) are not coplanar. Thus, the two phenyl rings were treated as rigid groups. In 1·FeCp2, the temperature factors of three carbon atoms (C21–C23) in one cyclopentadienyl ring are relatively high. SIMU and DELU restraints were applied in the refinement of temperature factors of the atoms in this cyclopentadienyl ring (C21–C25). Since there are plenty of discrete water molecules in the crystal lattices of 1·12H2O, the H atoms of discrete H2O could not be located. The H atoms of the coordinated water molecules in the four compounds were located from the Fourier map. All other H atoms were introduced at the calculated positions and included in the structure-factor calculations.

The TGA curve for 1·12H2O. 1·12H2O showed a first weight loss of 20.86% in the range of 45-165 °C, which corresponds to twelve solvent H2O molecules per formula unit and is consistent with the formula of {[Ni2(μ2-OH2)(1,3-BDC)2(tpcb)]·12H2O}n (ca. 20.69%). 1·12H2O is stable up to 218 °C. It showed the second weight loss of 1.58% in the range of 218-265 °C, which corresponds to one coordinated H2O molecule per formula unit (ca. 1.72%). After about 320 °C, the organic ligands in 1·12H2O start to decompose and the weight of the final residue (14.89%) was assumed to be NiO (ca. 14.31%). (a) S14 (b) Figure S4.

The UV-Vis spectrum of naphthalene extracted from activated carbon. The naphthalene uptake experiments conducted with activated carbon: To a triangle flask (250 mL) were loaded activated carbon (10 g, the activated carbon heated in an evacuated flask at 150 °C for 10 h.) and a glass tube (10 cm in length and 1.2 cm in inner diameter) which contains naphthalene (10 g), respectively. The flask was then sealed. After absorption for five days, the activated carbon was subjected to Soxhlet extraction for 20 hours using 100 mL ethanol. After extraction, 1 mL solution was transferred to a 1000 mL volumetric flask and then such 1 mL solution was diluted to 1000 mL solution. The diluted solution was subjected to UV-Vis measurement. The result (calculated based on the function: y = 0.0074 + 104500x (Figure S6)) indicated that 1 g of activated carbon could absorb about 8 mg of naphthalene in this condition.
