Chem. 2010, 49, 7685–7691 7685 DOI: 10.1021/ic100212q Porous Coordination Polymers of Transition Metal Sulfides with PtS Topology Built on a Semirigid Tetrahedral Linker Jun Zhang, Yun-Shan Xue, Li-Li Liang, Shi-Bin Ren, Yi-Zhi Li, Hong-Bin Du,* and Xiao-Zeng You State Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China Received February 3, 2010 Four novel porous metal sulfide coordination polymers, [M(tpom)Sx(SH)y] 3 z(H2O) (metal-sulfide frameworks, denoted MSF-n, n = 1, Cd; 2, Mn; 3, Fe; 4, Co; x = 0, y = 2 for 1, 2, and 4 and x = 0.54, y = 1.46 for 3), were solvothermally prepared by using a quadridentate linker, tetrakis(4-pyridyloxymethylene)methane (tpom), in the presence of organic sulfur compound under an acidic conditions. MSF-n (n = 1-4) is isostructural and built upon the tetrahedral tpom linker and square planar MSx(SH)y unit, which form a binodal 4,4-connected porous framework with a 2-fold interpenetrated 4284-pts net. With rectangular pore channels of about 5  6 A˚ 2 (interatomic distances between the nearest protruding H atoms across) running along both the crystallographic a and b directions, MSF-n possesses permanent porosity with a BET surface area of 575, 622, 617, and 767 m2/g for MSF-1, -2, -3, and -4, respectively, as estimated from N2 adsorption measurements. MSF-n (n = 1-4) has hydrogen storage capacities of 1.03, 1.37, 1.29, and 1.58 wt % at 77 K and 1 atm, respectively, each corresponding to 2.0 H2 molecules per unit cell. In addition, MSF-n (n = 1-4) can adsorb 24.1, 25.0, 21.6, and 24.1 wt % of carbon dioxide and 6.0, 6.1, 5.6, and 6.4 wt % of methane, respectively, at room temperature and 20 atm. Introduction Porous coordination polymers have been subjects of in- tense research because of their intriguing structures and potential applications in adsorbents, molecular sieving, cat- alysis, luminescence, etc.1 These materials are usually three- dimensional (3D) open frameworks constructed from the combination of metal ions or clusters with multidentate organic ligands through more or less covalent metal-ligand bonding. The availability of various organic ligands of certain geometry and functionality has allowed the rational synthesis of porous coordination polymers with specific structure and properties. Therefore, considerable current research efforts have been devoted to the preparation of new organic ligands and their use in the assembly of new co- ordination polymers. Among various ligands reported so far in the construction of coordination polymers are dominant nitrogen- and oxygen- donor bridging linkers, such as carboxylic acids, pyridine derivatives, etc.2 We are interested in the design and synthesis of porous coordination polymers of metal chalcogenides with multidentate ligands. These materials may possess structures and properties which differ from their N- and O-bridging counterparts. They may resemble previously reported open- framework metal chalcogenides such as CdS and GeS2, which are capable of integrating porosity with electrical or optical properties and hold promise for applications beyond those of traditional insulating oxides, e.g., as solid electro- lytes, semiconductor electrodes, sensors, and photocatalysis.3 On the otherhand, coordination compounds ofthe transition metals bearing the ligands SH-, S2-, S2 2-, and H2S poten- tially could serve as models for biological systems.4 We used a semirigid tridentate (2,4,6-trimethylbenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tri- methanethiol (tbms) inthe presenceof a tetradentatetetrakis- (4-pyridyloxymethylene)methane (tpom) as a coligand to react with transition metal ions in a solvothermal system (Scheme 1) and serendipitously obtained four isostructural coordination polymers [M(tpom)Sx(SH)y] 3 z(H2O) (M = Cd, Mn, Fe, Co), denoted MSF-n (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, metal-sulfide-framework), respectively.

We herein report their syntheses, structure analyses, and adsorption properties. Experimental Details Materials. All commercially available chemicals are of re- agent grade and were used as received without further purifica- tion. The ligand tpom was synthesized according to the litera- ture5 and the ligand tbms according to the literature.6 Physical Measurements. Elemental analyses of C, H, and N were performed on a Elementar Vario MICRO Elemental Analyzer at the Analysis Center of Nanjing University. Fourier transformed Infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker Vector 22 FT-IR spectrophotometer by using KBr pellets. Thermogravimetrical and differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA) were performed in a N2 atmosphere (a flow rate of 100 mL min-1) on a simultaneous SDT 2960 thermal analyzer from 35 C up to 750 C, with a heating rate of 10 C/min. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance instrument using Cu KR radiation (λ = 1.54056 A˚ ) at room temperature. The adsorption isotherms of nitrogen and hydrogen were measured at 77 K by using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 MþC volumetric adsorption equipment. The samples were pretreated at 373 K under a 50 μm Hg vacuum for about 10 h prior to the measurement of the isotherms. High-pressure carbon dioxide and methane sorption isotherm measurements were carried out on a Hiden Isochema IGA 100 high-pressure instrument at room temperature. Prior the measurements, approximately 100 mg of samples were placed in a stainless- steel sample holder and degassed at 373 K under a 10 mbar vacuum for about 5 h. Mossbauer spectroscopy was obtained on a German Wissel Mossbauer spectrometer. Preparation of [Cd(tpom)(SH)2] 3 4H2O (MSF-1). To the solu- tion of tbms (0.024 g, 0.093 mmol) in 1.5 mL of N,N-dimethyl- formamide (DMF) was added a solution of Cd(NO3)2 3 4H2O (0.031 g, 0.10 mmol) in DMF (1.5 mL) to give a white solid. Aqueous HCl (1:1 volume) was added dropwise to the mixture until the solid disappeared, where the pH was about 5. To the above solution was added the solution of tpom (0.022 g, 0.049 mmol) in DMF (2 mL). A white precipitate appeared and dis- appeared after adding a drop of aqueous HCl (1:1; pH ∼5). The mixture was transferred into a vial, which was then sealed and heated at 100 C for 3 days. The vial was then allowed to cool down to room temperature. Colorless octahedral crystals (0.031 g) were obtained by filtration and washed with DMF and acetonitrile three times each, respectively. Yield: 91.2% (based on tpom). Anal.

X-Ray Diffraction Determinations. The data collections for single crystal X-ray diffraction for MSF-1 to MSF-4 were carried out on a Bruker Smart APEX II CCD diffractometer at 291 K, using graphite-monochromated Mo KR radiation (λ = 0.71073 A˚ ). Data reductions and absorption corrections were performed using the SAINT and SADABS programs,7 respectively. The structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-97 program8 and refined with full-matrix least- squares on F2 using the SHELXL-97 program.9 All non-hydro- gen atoms were refined anisotropically, and all of the hydrogen atoms were set in geometrically calculated positions and refined using a riding model. The water molecules in the channels of the structure are disordered. We employed PLATON/SQUEEZE Scheme 1. Synthesis of Complexes MSF-n (5) Metrangolo, P.; Meyer, F.; Pilati, T.; Proserpio, D.

CCDC reference numbers are 763094-763097. Results and Discussion Synthesis. MSF-n (n = 1-4) was prepared solvother- mally in the presence of thiol ligand tbms and pyridine ligand tpom. X-ray single crystal analyses showed that MSF-n’s are coordination polymers of metal sulfides constituting metal hydrosulfide and the tpom ligand. The presence of the S-H groups is supported by the weak vibration peak around 2500 cm-1 in the FT-IR spectrum Table 1.

Therefore, we postulated that ligand tbms serves as a sulfur source as a result of its hydrolysis under hydrothermal conditions. The release of the -SH group from the thiols has been known to lead to the formation of metal sulfide nanoparticles or SH-bridged complexes.11 Other organic sulfur compounds, e.g., naphthalene-1,5-dithiol and (2,4,6-trimethylbenzene-1,3,5- triyl)tris(methylene)tris(ethylsulfane), can also be used for the formation of MSF-n (n = 1-4), while sodium hydrosul- fide results in the precipitation of inorganic metal sulfides. Besides Cd, Mn, Fe, and Co, Cu also forms an isostructural compound under similar conditions as evidenced by pre- liminary X-ray single crystal structure analysis. Attempts to prepare analogues of Zn and Ni have so far met with failures. MSF-n (n=1-4) is insoluble in common solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, acetonitrile, ether, DMF, and water and are stable in the air. The crystals are still transparent after several months. The phase purity for each product was confirmed by elemental analyses and X-ray powder diffraction. Crystal Structure Descriptions. X-ray single crystal diffraction analyses revealed that MSF-n (n = 1-4) is iso- structural, and all crystallize in the centrosymmetric tetragonal space group P42/n, which is associated with the point group C4h. The compounds are built from a metal disulfide unit and the flexible ligand tpom. The asymmetric unit of each compound consists of a half metal ion, one -S, a half ligand tpom, and two guest water molecules for MSF-1 and one guest water molecule for MSF-2 to -4 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 1, the M center adopts a slightly distorted octahedral coordination geometry, in which two axial positions are occupied by charge-balancing terminal -SH and -S (MSF-3) groups, while four equatorial positions are coordinated by nitrogen atoms from four different neutral tpom ligands. The M-N interatomic distances range 2.393(4)-2.397(4), 2.317(3)-2.319(3), 2.252(3)-2.274(3), and 2.193(3)-2.223(3) A˚ for MSF-1 (Cd), MSF-2 (Mn), MSF-3 (Fe), and MSF-4 (Co), res- pectively, consistent with those reported for other respec- tive metal-pyridine complexes.12 The M-S bonds are within normal ranges,13 with interatomic distances of 2.576(1) (Cd, MSF-1), 2.5018(9) (Mn, MSF-2), 2.4500(9) (Fe, MSF-3), and 2.4505(7) A˚ (Co, MSF-4), respectively. The quadridentate linker tpom, on the other hand, adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry (with exact C2 symmetry), coordinating to four metal ions. It has tetrahedron edge lengths of ca. 8.939(7)-11.133(5) (MSF-1), 8.973(5)- 11.141(5) (MSF-2), 9.026(5)-11.154(4) (MSF-3), and 9.024(4)-11.126(4) A˚ (MSF-4), respectively, as measured between the terminal N atoms. The angles around the tetrahedron center carbon atom are within the ranges of 88.79(5)-120.78(5), 88.70(4)-120.74(4), 89.23(4)-120.59- (3), and 89.33(3)-120.24(3) for MSF-1 (Cd), MSF-2 (Mn), MSF-3 (Fe), and MSF-4 (Co), respectively. The frameworks of MSF-n (n = 1-4) are constructed from a 4-connecting MS2 unit and a quadridentate linker, tpom. Each quadridentate tpom tetrahedrally coordi- nates via its N-donor atoms to four MS2 units, while each MS2 unit connects, in a square planar geometry, with four tpom ligands. This gives rise to a binodal 4,4-connecting 3D framework with 4284-pts (PtS) topology (Figure 2). The MS2 square planar node has a point symbol of 4284 and vertex symbol of 4.4.8(2).8(2).8(8).8(8), while the tpom tetrahedral node has the same point symbol of 4284 but a different vertex symbol of 4.4.8(7).8(7).8(7).8- (7).14 The pts net with large cavities interpenetrates another identical one, leading to a 2-fold interpenetration network of MSF-n (n = 1-4). The interpenetration can be regarded as space filling to stabilize the framework,15 leading to the elimination of parts of the free space in MSF-n (n = 1-4). The remaining free voids are filled with guest water molecules. The topologically rectangular 1D channels run along both the crystallographic a and b directions with sizes of ca. 5.9  6.1 (MSF-1), 5.5  6.6 (MSF-2), 5.0  5.5 (MSF-3), and 5.6  6.8 (MSF-4) A˚ 2, respectively, measured as interatomic distances between the nearest protruding H atoms across (Figure 3). Calcu- lations using PLATON10 based on the crystal structures show that the total solvent-accessible volume is about 1522, 1471, 1453, and 1407 A˚ 3 per unit cell, comprising 40.2, 39.8, 39.8, and 39.3% of the total crystal volume for MSF-1 to -4, respectively. The relatively large solvent- accessible voids together with the terminal M-S or M-SH groups in MSF-n could render them potentially useful as adsorbents or catalysts. Figure 1.

Article Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 49, No. 17, 2010 7689 There have been several coordination polymers with the tpom ligand reported so far, including 1D chains and 3D frameworks.16 In these polymers, tpom behaves differently. Tpom is a semirigid tetrapyridyl ligand, in which the four pyridyl groups can flexibly twist around the central quaternary carbon atom to meet different coordination environments. In the chain-like polymer MCOF-10 [Cd17S4(SPh)26](tpom), tpom acts as a 2-con- necting linker, while it is 4-connected in the belt-like MCOF-9 [Cd8S(SPh)14]2(tpom) to link two of four cor- ners of the tetrahedral P1 cluster [Cd8S(SPh)16]2-.16a In [M2(tpom)(D-cam)2] 3 2H2O (D-H2cam = D-camphoric Figure 2.

In the triply interpene- trated diamond network [Cu4I4(tpom)] 3 H2O,16d tetrahedral tpom is slightly distorted and connected to tetrahedral Cu4I4 cubane clusters. MSF-n’s are different from the above- mentioned compounds, possessing a binodal PtS network built from a tetrahedral tpom and square planar MS2 unit. The formation of MSF-n shows the rich structural diversity of the ligand tpom in the formation of MOFs. Thermal Studies. To study the framework stability of MSF-n (n = 1-4), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction studies (PXRD) of MSF-n samples treated at different temperatures were carried out. TGA was conducted under a flow of nitrogen to determine the thermal stability of MSF-n. As shown in Figure 4, MSF-n began to lose guest molecules from ca. 100 to 310 C, with weight losses of 10.6, 6.2, 6.4, and 6.2% (calculated 10.4, 6.0, 6.0, 5.9%), for MSF-1, MSF-2, MSF-3, and MSF-4, respectively. Above ca. 310 C, MSF-n started to lose its ligands as a result of thermal decomposition. The thermal stabilities of the MSF-n frameworks were further checked by X-ray pow- der diffraction, as exemplified by MSF-4 (Figure 5). The main XRD peaks of MSF-4 heated at 150 C under N2 for 2 h match those of the as-synthesized and the simulated ones on the basis of the single crystal structure. The main framework of MSF-4 treated at a higher tem- perature of 250 C remained as indicated by the presence of main XRD peaks, but its integrity has been deteriorated as shown by the occurrence of peak broadening and some new peaks. Upon heating at 300 C for 2 h, the frame- work of MSF-4 collapsed into an amorphous phase. The results show that MSF-n possesses a fairly rigid and robust framework. Adsorption Properties. Encouraged by thermal studies showing that MSF-n is stable upon removal of the guest molecules, we carried out gas adsorption measurements for N2, H2, CO2, and CH4. As shown in Figure 6, nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K for each compound show type-I behavior with a steep rise in the very low pressure region, suggesting a microporous nature of the four frameworks. The BET surface areas are calculated from N2 adsorption isotherms to be 575, 622, 617, and 767 m2/g and Langmuir surface areas of 764, 816, 813, and 1015 m2/g calculated for MSF-1, MSF-2, MSF-3, and MSF-4, respectively. The solvent-accessible surface area esti- mated on the basis of the crystal structures of MSF-n are 1022, 1081, 1069, and 1027 m2/g (using a spherical probe of 1.7 A˚ in diameter), respectively. The discrepan- cies between the Langmuir surface areas and solvent- accessible surface areas of MSF-1, -2, and -3 indicate the incomplete removal of guest molecules or structural deformation during the thermal activation prior to N2 adsorption measurements, which are often observed in MOFs.17 Considering the existence of permanent poros- ity in MSF-n (n = 1-4) and current intense interest in hydrogen storage,18 we also measured their hydrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K and low pressure (Figure 7). The hydrogen sorption profiles for MSF-n (n = 1-4) also show a type I isotherm curve with a steep uptake in the Figure 4. TGA profiles of MSF-n (n = 1-4) under nitrogen. Figure 5.

The hydrogen ad- sorption capacities at 77 K and 1 atm are 1.03 wt % (115.8 cm3/g), 1.37 wt % (153.9 cm3/g), 1.29 wt % (144.7 cm3/g), and 1.58 wt % (176.8 cm3/g) for MSF-1, MSF-2, MSF-3, and MSF-4, respectively, each corresponding to 2.0 H2 molecules per unit cell. The H2 adsorption properties of MSF-n (n = 1-4) are comparable to many MOFs of moderate H2 adsorption.18 High-pressure gas adsorption measurements were also performed at 293 K to investigate the CH4 and CO2 uptake capacities (Figures 8 and 9). At 293 K and 20 atm, MSF-1 adsorbs CO2 gas up to 24.1 wt % (122.6 cm3/g STP) and CH4 up to 6.0 wt % (83.7 cm3/g STP). MSF-2 adsorbsCO2upto25.0wt%(127.3cm3/gSTP) andCH4up to 6.1 wt % (85.2 cm3/g STP). MSF-3 adsorbs CO2 up to 21.6 wt % (110.0 cm3/g STP) and CH4 up to 5.6 wt % (78.2 cm3/g STP). MSF-4 adsorbs CO2 up to 24.1 wt % (122.6 cm3/g STP) and CH4 up to 6.4 wt % (89.4 cm3/g STP). Preliminary experiments show that MSF-n also adsorbs organic solvent molecules, as exemplified by MSF-1. The pristine crystals of MSF-1 were soaked in the solvent benzenefor about 24 h, then filtered and washed thoroughly with ether, and were then soaked in the solvent CDCl3 for 24 h. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) spectra showed the existence of a significant amount of benzene (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Similar experiments showed that MSF-1 can absorb chlorobenzene, o-xylene, and p-xylene. Conclusions We have successfully synthesized four 4,4-connected po- rous metal organic frameworks, [M(tpom)Sx(SH)y] 3 z(H2O) (MSF-n, n = 1, Cd; 2, Mn; 3, Fe; 4, Co; x = 0, y = 2 for 1, 2, and 4 and x = 0.54, y = 1.46 for 3), in the presence of an organic sulfur compound and quadradentate tetrakis(4-py- ridyloxymethylene)methane (tpom) ligand. The organic sul- fur compound serves as a sulfur source as a result of decomposition under acidic, solvothermal conditions to form coordination polymers of metal hydrosulfides. Four com- pounds are isostructural and constructed from the semirigid tetrahedral linker and the square planar MS2 unit, forming a known binodal 4284-pts (PtS) net. MSF-n (n = 1-4) exhibits permanent porosity confirmed by gas adsorption experi- ments of H2, N2, CO2, and CH4. Acknowledgment.
