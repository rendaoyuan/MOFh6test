The nonintersecting, narrow channels in [Cu3(cdm)4] (cdm = C(CN)2(CONH2)−) align in two perpendicular directions, structurally resembling copper-doped carbon nanotubes with CuII embedded in the walls of the channels. The combination of ultramicroporosity with the exposed CuII coordination sites gives size- based selectivity of CO2 over CH4, based on pore-size distribution and modeling. Neutron powder diﬀraction and molecular dynamics simulations show the close packing of single rows of guests within the tubular nanostructure and interaction of CO2 with the exposed metal sites. ■INTRODUCTION Two of the most studied materials for storage and sensing of small molecules in current research are metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs).1−3 These materials have found particular use in selective adsorption and detection of gaseous analytes, with attention on H2 or CO2 storage.4,5 Nanotubes in particular have been used for sensing based on changes in resistivity.6 Despite some similarities between MOFs and CNTs, i.e., large internal surface areas and guest-accessible channels, they display markedly diﬀerent gas uptake behavior. MOFs tend to possess complex pore topologies, typically 3D in nature, allowing exchange of adsorbed species and pathways through the material.7 These pores are typically in the 1−2 nm size range and are tailorable through judicious selection of components used.8 Conversely, CNTs contain only a 1D channel and have relatively poor adsorption behavior due to their weak interactions with gases.9 The uptake properties can be enhanced by incorporation of sites with stronger aﬃnities for gaseous guests, such as by doping metal ions into the nanotubes.10 Nanotubes also have a lack of size control below ca. 1 nm, thereby giving poor size- based selectivity, and there is diﬃculty in aligning the tubes in bulk samples in order to take advantage of any potential separation applications. Coordination polymers, of which MOFs represent a signiﬁcant subset,11 can be rationally designed as proposed by Robson.12 Some signiﬁcant advantages of MOFs with regards to providing strong host−guest interactions are their ability to be synthetically modiﬁed to expose bare metal sites,13 chemical reduction of the framework by metalation, cation exchange,14 or the addition of internal pendant groups.15−17 MOFs are also able to display pore-size control that cannot be reliably achieved with CNTs and that has been shown to be very beneﬁcial for CO2 capture if pore size is complementary to the kinetic diameter of CO2.18−21 It has been postulated recently that it should be possible to reliably access metal−organic materials (MOMs) that display nanotube-like structure and behavior, which have been termed SWMONTs (single-walled metal organic nanotubes).22 While reports of tubular metal− organic materials are relatively rare, an alternative strategy of great promise is the synthesis of more traditional MOFs with arrays of nonintersecting 1D channels. Size control is again important, and there is currently considerable interest in ultramicroporous MOMs, which possess channels with internal diameters <0.7 nm (i.e., smaller than an N2 bilayer).23 Such small pores can lead to highly selective sorption by size discrimination and display unique sorption properties, includ- ing signiﬁcant pore-blocking at low temperatures and quantum eﬀects on guest sorption.3,24−29 We report here a unique mixed-valent copper framework containing ultramicroporous, nonintersecting 1D channels in two directions with an unprecedented density of vacant CuII sites embedded within the walls. The material has been shown by neutron powder diﬀraction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to host CO2 in tight conﬁnes close to these metal Received: June 17, 2014 Published: July 15, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/cm © 2014 American Chemical Society 4640 dx.doi.org/10.1021/cm502189c | Chem.

K(cdm) was prepared according to a literature procedure.30 K(cdm) (240 mg, 1.63 mmol) was almost completely dissolved in methanol (30 mL) with the aid of sonication. To this was added a methanolic solution (3 mL) of anhydrous CuCl2 (216 mg, 1.61 mmol). Upon the addition of the green CuCl2 solution, the remaining suspended K(cdm) was dissolved to give a deep orange solution. Dark orange crystals of solvated [Cu3(cdm)4] (173 mg, 0.252 mmol, 62% yield) formed on the walls of the reaction vessel over a period of 2 days.

X-ray Crystallography. A suitable single crystal was mounted on a ﬁne glass ﬁber using viscous hydrocarbon oil. Data were collected using a Bruker X8 Apex2 diﬀractometer equipped with graphite monochromated Mo−Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The data collection temperature was maintained at 123 K using an open-ﬂow N2 cryostream. Data reduction was carried out using the Bruker Apex2 software suite.31 The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-2013.32 Reﬁnement was carried out against F2 using SHELXL-2013.33 All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned using an anisotropic model. Hydrogen atoms belonging to the amide group were placed in idealized X-ray positions and reﬁned using a riding model. Solvent coordinated to the Cu(II) was modeled as 50:50 H2O/ MeOH.

Neutron Powder Diﬀraction. Neutron powder diﬀraction data were collected on the high-intensity neutron diﬀractometer, Wombat (OPAL, ANSTO, Australia).34 Prior to neutron powder diﬀraction measurement and gas dosing, 1.119 g of desolvated [Cu3(cdm)4] was transferred to a cylindrical vanadium can (internal diameter of ca. 6 mm) inside a helium-ﬁlled glovebox equipped with water and oxygen monitors. The sample cell was connected to a custom-designed gas- delivery center-stick and inserted into a top-loading cryofurnace. Temperature control at the sample was achieved using cartridge heaters and silicon-diode temperature sensors at the top and bottom of the cell. The gas-delivery line was also temperature-controlled in order to avoid freezing CO2 inside the tube, so that the sample could be left in place throughout the experiment without the requirement of warming the entire cryofurnace between gas doses. An initial diﬀraction pattern was collected on the evacuated sample at 15 K to be used as a structural reference point from which subsequent data for the CO2-dosed sample could be analyzed. The sample was then warmed to 300 K prior to dosing with a known amount of CO2, before being slowly cooled to the measurement temperature of 15 K, all the while ensuring that the temperature was kept above the boiling/ sublimation point of CO2 at the current pressure. By 150 K the pressure reading was zero, indicating that all CO2 had been absorbed by the sample. No evidence of frozen CO2 was observed in the diﬀraction patterns. The total cooling time was approximately 1 h, with the intention of ensuring diﬀusion of the CO2 molecules to their thermodynamic equilibrium positions and minimizing random disorder of guest molecules prior to the diﬀraction measurement. Thirty minutes of diﬀraction data were acquired for each dose using an area detector in the angular range 17° < 2θ < 137° with an incident neutron wavelength of 2.4145(3) Å, determined using an Al2O3 standard reference material (NIST SRM 676). A correction was applied to the Debye−Scherrer ring curvature before data reduction. Rietveld analysis and diﬀerence Fourier analysis of the diﬀraction data was carried out using GSAS and EXPGUI,35,36 with a pseudo- Voigt peak shape and 16-term shifted Chebyshev background function. VESTA was used for visualization of the crystal structure and nuclear density isosurfaces.37 Following reﬁnement of the guest-free structure, this was used together with the data from the CO2-loaded sample to generate Fourier diﬀerence maps of residual nuclear density. Further details are provided in the Supporting Information. Calculations. The static cavity size distribution was calculated using the geometric sizing algorithm using atomic coordinates from the single crystal data.38 There is a dominant cavity size of around 3.9 Å that represents the main channels. Using molecular dynamics (MD) with generic UFF, the ﬂexibility of the channel size was investigated over one nanosecond at 123 K with ﬁxed cell volume. The window size was deﬁned as the maximum size of a spherical probe allowed to pass through the structure.39 All DFT calculations were performed using VASP 5.2 with the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) general- ized gradient approximation (GGA) functional and Gaussian smearing of partial occupancies (see Supporting Information for full experimental details). ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Structure. The mixed-valent CuI/CuII coordination polymer [Cu3(cdm)4(MeOH)(H2O)] was syn- thesized by reaction of K(cdm), where cdm is the dinitrile anion C(CN)2(CONH2)−, with CuCl2 in aerobic conditions following from our extensive work on discrete coordination complexes using this ligand40 (full synthetic details in Supporting Information). Mixed-valent coordination polymers of copper are not unknown, with precedents typically being materials containing cyanide, halide, azide, or thiocyanate bridging ligands. Powder diﬀraction conﬁrms that the synthesis gives a phase-pure product (see Supporting Information). Elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicate that both water and methanol are present within the as-synthesized material. In part these solvents are coordinated, although the proportion of coordinated MeOH/H2O is diﬃcult to determine crystallographically as the solvent lies on a crystallographic 4-fold axis. The material crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4̅2d with a single cdm ligand in the asymmetric unit, the CuII atoms residing on a rotoinversion site and the CuI atoms lying on rotation axes. The CuI atoms are tetrahedral and are exclusively coordinated by nitrile groups. The CuII atoms are octahedral with four κO-cdm ligands in the equatorial positions and coordinated solvent, a mixture of MeOH and H2O, in the axial positions. Both metals therefore act as four-connecting nodes. The cdm ligand is a three-connecting node giving the structure an overall self-penetrating (82.10)4(83.103)2(85.10) topology (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The closely related anions dicyanamide (dca) and tricyanomethanide (tcm) are both known to form 3D structures in binary complexes, although in these instances the metal coordination spheres are ﬁlled completely by the ligands and typically give close-packed structures.40 The mixed nitrogen/oxygen donor groups in cdm, alongside the mixed CuI/CuII present in the structure, mean that the metal/donor preferences are ideal for easily removed solvent to be present in the axial CuII sites, thereby allowing guest-accessible pores. The short distance between the donor atoms is ideal for forming ultramicroporous channels. Chemistry of Materials Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cm502189c | Chem. Mater. 2014, 26, 4640−4646 4641 Nonintersecting, nanotube-like channels run through the structure parallel to the crystallographic a and b axes (Figure 1). In the as-synthesized material, axially coordinated solvent on the CuII atoms protrudes into these narrow channels, eﬀectively blocking them for any application. The most striking feature of these 1D channels is the high density of vacant CuII coordination sites that is present once the solvent has been removed, with open-metal sites known to enhance interactions with gases.41 These metal sites occupy opposing walls of the channels and are spaced apart by ca. 11.2 Å along one wall. Taking into account the two CuII-lined walls this gives a vacant metal site every 5.6 Å along the channels, with the closest Cu··· Cu distance being 7.8 Å (cf. 8.0 Å in the narrow “windows” in the structure of HKUST-1).42 Further potential points of interaction for guest molecules are provided by the NH2 group of the ligands, which protrudes very slightly into the channels at a similar spacing. The extremely small size of the channels is obtained by the use of the cdm ligand, which is itself small and sterically undemanding, with only single atoms as points of coordination to the metals. Thus, this ligand has advantages over larger, more complicated ligands that rely on bulkier coordinating groups, such as pyridine, which crowd the immediate metal coordination sphere. The small bridging distance between the coordinating groups of the cdm ligand, with the three Cu···Cu distances around one ligand in the range 6.36−8.26 Å, is ideal for forming an ultramicroporous material. The static cavity size distribution for these channels was calculated using a geometric sizing algorithm, showing a dominant cavity size of ca. 3.9 Å that represents the main channels in the structure (Figure 1).43 The ﬂexibility of these channels was investigated using molecular dynamics simu- lations over 1 ns with the generic universal force ﬁeld (UFF, Figure 1).44 The window size in the MD simulations was deﬁned by the maximum size of a spherical probe that is allowed to pass through the channel. Over the course of this simulation the window size ﬂuctuated around 3.5 Å, suggesting that the material may have a potential sieving mechanism as the channel size lies intermediate between that of CO2 (kinetic diameter = 3.3 Å) and CH4 (kinetic diameter = 3.87 Å). The remarkably small internal size of these channels is signiﬁcantly smaller than those in the ultramicroporous salen-derived MOF of Chen et al. (5.6 × 12.0 Å), which also contains vacant CuII coordination sites,24 and marginally smaller than those in the SIFSIX-3 MOM (ca. 3.8 Å at low temperatures).19,25,45 Gas Sorption Experiments. The coordinated solvent molecules, and uncoordinated solvent within the channels, can be removed by treatment of the material with supercritical CO2 (scCO2), well-known as an eﬀective method of MOF activation,46 to give the desolvated framework [Cu3(cdm)4]. Retention of crystallinity upon desolvation was demonstrated by neutron powder diﬀraction (NPD, Figure 2). Studies of the gas sorption properties of the material were conducted for CO2, CH4, H2, and Ar (Figure 3; full details in Supporting Information). At 273 K almost twice as much CO2 is taken up as CH4 (46 cm3 g−1 vs 25 cm3 g−1 at 1000 mbar) bearing out the prediction from the MD simulations that the size of the pore may lead to sieving or selective adsorption between these two gases. While increased uptake of CO2 is not unexpected for most MOFs,1,3 it is uncommon for the cavity diameter to be intermediate between that of the two gases. Uptake of hydrogen and argon are negligible at 77 and 87 K, respectively, with nitrogen also not adsorbed at similar temperatures. Such sorption behavior is known for ultra- microporous MOFs/MOMs.3,32 The adsorption kinetics are also remarkably slow, with CO2 sorption at 273 K requiring 68 h to reach saturation (Supporting Information, Figure S12) giving further evidence of sieving kinetics even at relatively high temperatures. Predictions of the adsorption behavior were conducted using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations (Figure 3). These simulations overestimate the experimental isotherms although the general trends that are observed are captured. It appears that the size, shape, and charge composition of CO2 is much more favorable for adsorption within the channels than CH4, with twice as many molecules of CO2 being taken in. Calculations of experimental enthalpies are unreliable due to step-like behavior at low pressures, indicative of the tube-like adsorption (see Supporting Information, Figure S11). The predicted and experimentally determined uptake of H2 is less Figure 1. Ultramicroporous structure of [Cu3(cdm)4] contains nonintersecting channels with a dynamic diameter ﬂuctuating around 3.5 Å, intermediate between the kinetic diameters of CH4 and CO2, and signiﬁcantly smaller than the smallest reported CNT. Chemistry of Materials Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cm502189c | Chem. Mater. 2014, 26, 4640−4646 4642 than 1 cm3 g−1. The postulated reason for this low uptake is a quantum eﬀect that occurs due to nanoscale conﬁnement of light gases. The enormous reduction in predicted H2 uptake is accounted for by incorporating the quantum Feynman−Hibbs potential into calculations (see Supporting Information, Figure S13).47,48 Similar behavior is observed for other ultra- microporous materials, including the recent NOTT-300 material, which has somewhat larger (ca. 6.5 × 6.5 Å) pores.49 The diﬀerence in adsorption between CH4 and CO2 in [Cu3(cdm)4] was further investigated by ﬁtting the experimental isotherms with the dual Langmuir expression and utilizing the ideal adsorbed solution (IAST) model to predict mixed-gas isotherms of various industrially relevant compositions (see Supporting Information).50,51 These results suggest that there is good selectivity for CO2 over CH4 under the conditions that were modeled, although higher selectivities are known.52 Neutron Powder Diﬀraction. To explore the host−guest interactions within the material, neutron powder diﬀraction (NPD) experiments with in situ gas loading were performed using the Wombat diﬀractometer at ANSTO.34 An initial diﬀraction pattern from scCO2-activated and evacuated [Cu3(cdm)4] at 15 K was used as a structural reference point for analysis of the CO2-loaded structures with Rietveld reﬁnement giving a low R value with no evidence of residual solvent (Figure 2). The sample was treated with two successive doses of CO2 with loadings of 1.00 and 2.00 CO2/ [Cu3(cdm)4]. Slow uptake during the ﬁnal part of the second gas dose indicated that the sample was reaching its maximum CO2 capacity. The ﬁnal quantity of adsorbed CO2 was equivalent to 73 cm3 g−1 at STP, which, due to the lower temperature involved, is considerably greater than the uptake measured at 1 bar and 273 K. No new reﬂections were observed in the CO2-loaded diﬀraction patterns, indicating that the original symmetry is preserved. Fourier-diﬀerence analysis of the NPD data revealed two CO2 sites within the channels (Figure 4). Site A, which at the 1 CO2/[Cu3(cdm)4] loading level contains the most nuclear density, is close to the open CuII site with the residual density suggestive of CO2 lying side-on to the metal. CO2 typically binds in an end-on fashion,53−55 but in the present case this arrangement would align poorly with the geometry of the Figure 2. Rietveld reﬁnement (red) against NPD data (black) for guest-free [Cu3(cdm)4] at 15 K after activation by supercritical CO2. Figure 3. Experimental (icons) and simulated (solid lines) sorption traces highlighting the diﬀerence in behavior between CO2 and CH4 and negligible uptake of Ar and H2. Chemistry of Materials Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cm502189c | Chem. Mater. 2014, 26, 4640−4646 4643 channel, whereas the side-on orientation enables increased interaction with the pore walls. Site B is located in the narrower part of the channel, midway between two diagonally opposite open CuII sites. The constricted pore environment does not appear to allow the geometric arrangement necessary for a strong interaction between CO2 molecules and the NH2 groups, and no signiﬁcant residual nuclear density was found in their vicinity. The somewhat diﬀuse nuclear density at these sites indicates some positional disorder of the CO2 molecules, despite conﬁnement by the small channels. A single partially occupied CO2 molecule in the side-on arrangement was satisfactorily modeled at site A, with reﬁned occupancies of 0.35 and 0.40 for the C and O atoms, respectively. A single 0.15 occupancy C atom was modeled at the center of the residual density at site B, but as a consequence of the disorder, the corresponding oxygen atoms of the CO2 are not readily located. The relative ease of locating this C atom implies that the orientation of the CO2, rather than its center of mass, is disordered. The combined C occupancies at the two sites are in good agreement with the dosed amount for both loading levels (Table 1). The occupancy of site A increases only slightly at higher loading, indicating that it is nearly saturated by the ﬁrst dose, while the site B occupancy increases signiﬁcantly. The overall result is roughly half-ﬁlling of each site at the higher CO2 loading. DFT-based MD simulations at 100 K were performed to validate the NPD experimental results and determine the orientation of the CO2 molecules. The time-averaged site A position in the MD simulation is in good agreement with the NPD data with CO2 side-on to the metal. The simulation shows CO2 molecules moving back and forth between sites A and B and provides strong evidence that the preferred orientation of the CO2 molecule at both sites is along the direction of the channel. The motion is rapid even at 100 K, with each CO2 molecule switching sites an average of three times during the 25 ps simulation, indicating a small energy diﬀerence between the two sites. When occupying site B, the CO2 molecules are located with their C atoms midway between the two Cu sites, in good agreement with the C position reﬁned from the NPD data. DFT structure relaxation at 0 K was performed in order to clarify the most energetically favorable arrangement for CO2 molecules at each site. The optimized arrangement for CO2 in site A is in good agreement with the side-on orientation observed in the Rietveld reﬁned NPD structure. The calculated Cu···C distance of 3.76 Å is longer than that observed experimentally, likely a result of the fact that DFT does not account for van der Waals interactions. The distance of 7.78 Å between open CuII sites on either side of site B is comparable to the 7.15 Å distance between open metal sites in the Co3[Fe(CN)6]2 Prussian blue analogue (PBA) in which a bridging CO2 binding mode was recently established.56 [Cu3(cdm)4] provides a second example of a CO2 molecule interacting with two bare metal sites, although due to the highly constricted pore environment, the CO2 is unable to adopt a similar binding mode to that in the PBA. All DFT energy minimizations in which a CO2 molecule was initially placed in site B and end-on to the two CuII sites quickly resulted in the molecule returning to an orientation parallel to the channel, indicating that such an end-on bridging mode carries a large energy penalty due to the narrowness of the channels. The channel-aligned arrangement yields a longer M− CO2 distance than in the PBA (M···C = 3.89 Å) but enables greater interaction with the channel walls. The simultaneous occupation by CO2 of both an A-site and the adjacent B-site is not energetically favorable due to the short guest−guest distances that this would entail (O···O ≈1.0 Å), thereby limiting the CO2 capacity of the framework with each site only ca. 50% occupied at the maximum achieved loading of 2.0 CO2/[Cu3(cdm)4]. The small energy diﬀerence (calculated to be 2 kJ mol−1) between the two sites means that they both compete relatively equally to bind CO2. Additionally, once 50% occupancy is reached at site A, there is on average one CO2 molecule interacting with each CuII ion, which is likely to alter the energetics of this site and reduce the likelihood of another molecule interacting with the opposite axial site of the same CuII ion. Site B could then become the more favorable site and subsequently ﬁll until the aforementioned steric limit of 2.0 CO2/[Cu3(cdm)4] is reached. This ﬁlling regime is supported by the changes in the adsorption site occupation from NPD experiments. ■CONCLUSIONS The ultramicroporous structure of [Cu3(cdm)4], which contains 0.35 nm nonintersecting channels combined with close vacant CuII sites lining the internal walls, has been shown to display selective gas uptake of CO2. The internal pore size is ideal for improved sorption of CO2 over CH4 with a dynamic Figure 4.

Mater. 2014, 26, 4640−4646 4644 diameter intermediate between the kinetic radii of the two gases, although the tight conﬁnes of the 1D channel results in slow kinetics. Gas sorption experiments, supported by GCMC simulations, show that the uptake of CO2 is almost twice that of CH4 up to a pressure of 1000 mbar. There is negligible uptake of H2 arising from a quantum eﬀect. Neutron powder diﬀraction and DFT/MD calculations show the interaction of CO2 at two positions close to the open metal sites, aligned with the direction of the narrow channels. The system demonstrates the inﬂuence of free metal sites for CO2 binding, and calculations suggest a signiﬁcant role of the channel size in separations. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Expanded experimental section and data (X-ray, NPD, gas sorption, DFT, and modeling).

To this was added a methanolic solution (3 mL) of anhydrous CuCl2 (216 mg, 1.61 mmol). Upon addition of the green CuCl2 solution, the remaining suspended K(cdm) was dissolved to give a deep orange solution. Dark orange crystals of solvated [Cu3(cdm)4] (173 mg, 0.252 mmol, 62% yield) formed on the walls of the reaction vessel over a period of two days.

C 2004, 60, m10-m12. 3 Single Crystal X-Ray Crystallography and Structure A suitable single crystal was mounted on a fine glass fibre using viscous hydrocarbon oil. Data were collected using a Bruker X8 ApexII diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The data collection temperature was maintained at 123 K using an open-flow N2 cryostream. Data reduction was carried out using the Bruker ApexII software suite.2 The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-2013.3 Refinement was carried out against F2 using SHELXL-2013.3 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined using an anisotropic model. Hydrogen atoms belonging to the amide group were placed in idealised X-ray positions and refined using a riding model. Solvent coordinated to the Cu(II) was modelled as 50:50 H2O:MeOH. Due to the high symmetry and the constitutional disorder at this site the OH hydrogen atoms of the solvent could not be located and are not included in the model. TGA and microanalysis suggests the presence of interstitial solvent in the as- synthesised material. There is a small amount of residual unresolvable electron density in the small void spaces between the Cu(II) sites. This residual density could not be modelled or otherwise treated with crystallographic software.

The sample cell was connected to a custom-designed gas-delivery centrestick and inserted into a top-loading cryofurnace. Temperature control at the sample was achieved using cartridge heaters and silicon-diode temperature sensors at the top and bottom of the cell. The gas-delivery line was also temperature-controlled in order to avoid freezing CO2 inside the tube, so that the sample could be left in place throughout the experiment without the requirement of warming the entire cryofurnace between gas doses. An initial diffraction pattern was collected on the evacuated sample at 15 K to be used as a structural reference point from which subsequent data for the CO2-dosed sample could be analysed (Figure S3). The sample was then warmed to 300 K prior to dosing with a known amount of CO2, before being slowly cooled to the measurement temperature of 15 K, all the while ensuring that the temperature was kept above the boiling/sublimation point of CO2 at the current pressure. By 150 K the pressure reading was zero, indicating that all CO2 had been absorbed by the sample. No evidence of frozen CO2 was observed in the diffraction patterns. The total cooling time was approximately 1 hour, with the intention of ensuring diffusion of the CO2 molecules to their thermodynamic equilibrium positions and minimising random disorder of guest molecules prior to the diffraction measurement. 30 minutes of diffraction data were acquired for each dose using an area detector in the angular range 17° < 2θ < 137° with an incident neutron wavelength of 2.4145(3) Å, determined using an Al2O3 standard reference material (NIST SRM 676). A correction was applied to the Debye-Scherrer ring curvature before data reduction. 4 Studer, A.J.; Hagen, M.E.; Noakes, T.J. Physica B 2006, 385-386, 1013-1015. 6 Structure Refinement from NPD data Rietveld analysis and difference Fourier analysis of the diffraction data was carried out using GSAS & EXPGUI, 5 with a pseudo-Voigt peak shape and 16-term shifted Chebyshev background function. VESTA 6 was used for visualization of the crystal structure and nuclear density isosurfaces. Following refinement of the guest-free structure, this was used together with the data from the CO2-loaded sample to generate Fourier difference maps of residual nuclear density. CO2 molecules were introduced to the refinement in the locations and orientations suggested by both this residual density and the DFT calculations (see below). Initially, the cdm ligand was treated as a rigid body, and the CO2 molecules were restrained to be linear with C-O bond lengths around 1.16 Å. After the refinement converged under these conditions, the constraints/restraints were progressively removed. The CO2 molecules modelled at site A in the final refined structures were somewhat bent, presumably an artefact of the static disorder, with O-C-O angles of 154° and 159° for the first and second doses, respectively. The O atoms for the CO2 at site B could not be satisfactorily refined, apparently due to disorder of the guest.

In addition to the density at CO2 adsorption sites A and B, some density is seen near the O atoms in a), but is too close to the O (< 1 Å) to be attributable to CO2. Figure S7: Rietveld refined structures of [Cu3(cdm)4]·1CO2 (left) and [Cu3(cdm)4]·2CO2 (right). Atom occupancies for the CO2 molecules are reflected by the partially filled spheres. 10 Figure S8: Optimal CO2 positions in [Cu3(cdm)4], determined by DFT energy minimisations. For comparison, shown in black are the atom positions experimentally determined from NPD of [Cu3(cdm)4]·1CO2. At site A, the distance between the CO2 and the nearest CuII site is greater than that determined from NPD, presumably because no empirical correction was used to account for van der Waals interactions. The calculated orientation of the CO2 at this site is highly consistent with the experimental results, with only a 9° difference in the rotation of the two orientations when viewed along the c axis. The calculated optimal CO2 position at site B is centred exactly on the Rietveld-refined C atom. 11 Details of DFT Calculations of CO2 Sites from NPD Data All DFT calculations were performed using VASP 5.2 7 with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) 8 generalised gradient approximation (GGA) functional, and Gaussian smearing of partial occupancies. A constant temperature (NVT) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted at 200 K on one unit cell of Cu3(cdm)4·1CO2 (with unit cell parameters taken from NPD results) with periodic boundary conditions, a plane wave energy cut-off of 300 eV, and a 1 fs time step. In the initial structure, three of the four CO2 molecules in the unit cell were placed side-on to the CuII as indicated by the nuclear density found at adsorption site A in the NPD results. The fourth molecule was placed approximately end-on (C···O=C angle 147°; Cu···O distance 2.7Å), giving it the opportunity to adopt either arrangement. As the simulation proceeded, this end-on CO2 molecule quickly adopted the side-on configuration, providing further evidence that this arrangement is the most stable. The simulation was then continued at 100 K for a further 25 ps (25 000 frames). The CO2 molecules were observed to move back and forth between adsorption sites A and B with the atom positions at these sites very consistent with those determined using NPD. As they moved through the structure, the CO2 molecules remained close to parallel to the channels, indicating the channels are too narrow for the molecules to flip end- over-end. High precision energy minimisations were undertaken starting from the typical locations at the two sites that were observed in the MD simulation. A relatively high plane wave energy cut-off of 520 eV was used, together with a conjugate-gradient minimisation algorithm. The optimised positions of the CO2 molecules at the two adsorption sites were found to be in good agreement with the experimental NPD results. 7 Kresse, G.; Furthmuller, J. Phys. Rev. B 1996, 54, 11169. 8 Perdew, J. P.; Burke, K.; Ernzerhof, M. Physical Review Letters 1996, 77, 3865. 12 Gas Sorption Measurements Gas adsorption isotherms for pressures in the range of 0-1.2 bar were measured by a volumetric method using a Micromeritics ASAP 2420 instrument. Freshly prepared MOF samples were activated with scCO2 at 40 and 150 Bar, with three filling and emptying cycles, the slow rate of these processes being paramount. The samples were then evacuated and held under a dynamic vacuum at 10-6 Torr for 24 h, and transferred to a pre-dried and weighed analysis tube contained in specially designed Schlenk glassware under a constant positive flow of argon atmosphere. Accurate sample masses were calculated using degassed samples. All adsorption measurements used ultra-high purity gases. High pressure (100 bar) isotherms were undertaken on a PCTPro instrument using similar activation procedures, but did not reveal significant adsorption of hydrogen.

(Right) The step-wise sorption at low pressure for methane, which prevents the determination of experimental enthalpy. 14 Cavity Size and Uptake Calculations The static cavity size distribution was calculated using the geometric sizing algorithm using atomic coordinates from the single crystal data.10 There is a dominant cavity size of around 3.9 Å that represents the main channels. Using Molecular Dynamics (MD) with generic UFF the flexibility of the channel size was investigated over one nanosecond at 123 K with fixed cell volume. The window size was defined as the maximum size of a spherical probe allowed to pass through the structure.11 Over the simulation time, the window size fluctuated around 3.5 Å, suggesting a size sieving mechanism between CO2 (kinetic diameter 3.3 Å) and CH4 (kinetic diameter 3.87 Å). Hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms were predicted using the GCMC routine with generic UFF force fields within the RASPA package, see snapshots in Figure S12. The shape, size and charge composition of CO2 is more favorable for adsorption within the cavity channels, resulting in twice as many CO2 molecules than CH4. Figure S12: Simulation snapshots during the gas loading of methane (left) and carbon dioxide (right). 10 Dubbeldam, D.; Calero, S.; Ellis, D. E.; Snurr, R. Q.

The Feynman-Hibbs correction term was added to the Lennard-Jones force field function for hydrogen which depends on temperature and molecular mass. 12 As shown in Figure S13, quantum effects significantly reduce the uptake due to additional repulsive forces between hydrogen and the framework. Figure S13: Comparison of predicted H2 uptake at 77 K with and without the consideration of the quantum Feynman-Hibbs potential. Experimental single gas isotherms were fitted with the dual Langmuir expression and then incorporated within the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) to predict mixed gas isotherms of various compositions, see Figure S14. 12 Kumar, A.
