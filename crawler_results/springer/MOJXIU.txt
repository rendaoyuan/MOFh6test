Single crystal X-ray dif- fraction analysis reveals that compound 1 shows a 2D?3D polythreaded motif based on (3,4)-connected 2D sheets, while compound 2 features a 4-connected sql tetragonal plane net, which further extended into a 3D supramolecular framework through intermolecular CHp interactions. In addition, the luminescent and thermal stabilities properties of these two compounds were investigated.

However, how to rational design and synthesis of desired polymers remains a great challenge to chemists. Therefore, appropriate selection of organic ligands is crucial in the preparation of target compounds. Over the past few dec- ades, polycarboxylate ligands and N-containing auxiliary ligands have been shown to be good building blocks in the synthesis of coordination polymers with desired topologi- cal frameworks. In this ﬁeld, many coordination polymers based on polycarboxylate ligands have been reported [7, 8]. However, studies of pamoic acid-based complexes are rare [9–15]. To further understand the coordination behavior of pamoic acid, we selected pamoic acid and N-containing ligands (bpe and bix) as the mixed organic building blocks based on the following considerations: (i) Pamoic acid containing both carboxylic and phenoxy groups can potentially afford various coordination modes and con- struct diverse metal–organic frameworks because the naphthyl rings can freely rotate around the methylene (–CH2–) groups in the self-assembly process. (ii) Pamoic acid is an inexpensive industrial precursor and can be used in the pharmaceutical industry [16]. (iii) Bpe and bix are ﬂexible bridging ligands, which not only can adopt two different conformations (cis and trans) according to the geometrical requirements of metal ions, but also can con- struct high-dimensional compounds. Thus, we obtained two new compounds; namely, [Cd2(pam)2(bpe)1.5(DMF)2 (H2O)]n2n(DMF) (1) and [Cd(pam)(bix)]n (2) (H2pam = pamoic acid, bpe = 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene, bix = 4, 40-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene, DMF = N,N0-dimeth- ylformamide).

Element analyses (C, H and N) were determined with an elemental Vairo EL III analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected using PANalytical X’Pert Pro powder diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation and 5 B 2h B 50. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a NetzschSTA499C integration thermal analyzer under a nitrogen atmosphere from 30 to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min. Fluo- rescence spectra of the solid samples were performed with an Edinburgh Analytical instrument FLS920. Single crystal X-ray diffraction was carried out with Saturn70 diffractometer. 2.2 Synthesis of Compounds 1–2 2.2.1 Synthesis of [Cd2(pam)2(bpe)1.5(DMF)2(H2O)]n2n(DMF) 1 A mixture of Cd(NO3)24H2O (0.060 g, 0.2 mmol), H2pam (0.030 g, 0.1 mmol), bpe (0.036 g, 0.2 mmol), DMF (2 mL) and H2O (2 mL) was placed in a Parr Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel (23 mL). The vessel was sealed and heated to 120 C, and held at that temperature for 60-h. The reactant mixture was then cooled at 0.5 C/min to give to crystalline 1; yield, 47 % based on H2pam. Elemental analyses for C76H70Cd2N7O17 (1578.21): C, 57.79; H, 4.44; N, 6.21 %. Found: C, 57.78; H, 4.46; N, 6.18 %. 2.2.2 Synthesis of [Cd(pam)(bix)]n 2 Synthesis of 2 was similar to 1, but with bix (0.048 g, 0.2 mmol) in place of bpe. Colorless crystals of 2 were obtained in 34 % yield based on H2pam. Elmental analyses for C37H28CdN4O6 (737.04): C, 60.24; H, 3.80; N, 7.60 %. Found: C, 60.23; H, 3.85; N, 7.61 %. 2.3 X-ray Crystallography Single crystal X-ray structure analysis of 1 and 2 were performed with Saturn70 diffractometer (Mo Ka radiation, k = 0.71073 A˚ , graphite monochromator) at 293(2) K. Empirical absorption corrections were applied to the data using the SADABS program [17]. The structures were solved by the direct method and reﬁned by the full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXL-97 program [18]. All the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically; and, the hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms were located at their ideal positions. Experimental details for the structure determination are presented in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for compounds 1 and 2 are listed in Tables 2 and 3. 3 Result and Discussion 3.1 Crystal Structure Description of Compound 1 Single crystal X-ray structure analysis reveals that 1 crys- tallizes in triclinic P-1 space group with the asymmetric unit containing two Cd(II) ions, two pam ligands, one and a half bpe ligand, two coordinated DMF molecules, one coordinated water molecule and two free DMF molecules. Cd1 and Cd2 are seven-coordinated and exhibit distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometries (Fig. 1). For Cd1, the equatorial plane is composed of four chelating carboxylate oxygen atoms from two different pam ligands, and one coordinated water molecule. Two nitrogen atoms from two different bpe ligands occupy the axial positions. For Cd2, the arrangement is totally different with two DMF oxygen atoms situated at axial positions and four chelating Table 1 Crystallographic data for 1 and 2 1 2 Formula C76H70Cd2N7O17 C37H28CdN4O6 Fw 1578.21 737.04 Crystal system Triclinic Triclinic Space group P-1 P-1 a (A˚ ) 13.572(9) 10.274(4) b (A˚ ) 17.466(10) 12.984(6) c (A˚ ) 19.348(14) 13.342(6) a() 63.764(19) 102.455(3) b () 86.94(4) 95.454(4) c () 72.94(3) 100.813(6) Volume (A˚ 3) 3917(4) 1761.12(17) Z 2 2 Density (calculated) 1.338 1.449 Abs. coeff.

The Cd–O and Cd–N distances locate in the range of 2.272(7)–2.571(6), 2.292(7)–2.334(7) A˚ , respectively, which are comparable with those other related Cd(II) complexes [19]. The pam and bpe ligands adopt a bidentate (j1:j1),(j1:j1)-l2 coordination mode and anti-conforma- tion, bridging two Cd(II) ions. Through the coordination mode of these two kinds of ligands, the Cd(II) ions are bridged together into a 2D layer (Fig. 2a). In this layer, there are two kinds of open windows: four-member ring (A) and six-member ring (B). From a topological point of view, if all Cd(II) ions and organic ligands can be reduced into nodes and linkers, this 2D sheet can be simpliﬁed into a (3, 4)-connected binodal net with a Schla¨ﬂi symbol of {42.63.8}{42.6} (Fig. 2a). The most outstanding structural feature of 1 is the 2D?3D polythreaded motif assembling from the 2D lay- ers. Each six-member ring of one layer is threaded by one coordinated DMF molecule and one naphthyl ring of a pam ligand from one adjacent layer below; and, each four- member ring is threaded only by one coordinated DMF molecule from one adjacent layer below (Fig. 2b). Through this threading, these 2D layers are stacked into a 3D supramolecular framework (Fig. 2b). 3.2 Crystal Structure Description of Compound 2 When bpe in 1 was replaced by bix, 2 is obtained. Single- crystal X-ray analysis reveals that 2 also crystallizes in triclinic P-1 space group. There is one Cd(II) ion, one pam ligand and one bix ligand in the asymmetric unit of 2. The coordination geometry of Cd1 can be described as a slightly distorted octahedron (Fig. 3). The equatorial plane is deﬁned by three carboxylate oxygen atoms of the pam ligands and one nitrogen atom of the bix ligand; the axial sites are situated by one carboxylate oxygen atom and one nitrogen atom. The Cd–O distances are in the range of 2.302(3)–2.442(3) A˚ . The Cd–N distances occur from 2.232(3)–2.248(3) A˚ , which are all comparable with pre- viously reported related Cd(II) complexes [19]. In 2, the pam ligands also adopt bidentate bidentate (j1:j1),(j1:j1)- l2 coordination mode and an anti-conformation bridging Cd(II) ions into a 1D chain structure (Fig. 4a). These 1D chains are further bridged by the bix ligands in a cis con- formation into a 2D layer structure (Fig. 4b). Different from 1, the 2D sheet of 2 only contains 4-membered open windows. If each Cd(II) ions and organic ligands (pam and bix) can be looked as nodes and linkers, the 2D sheet can be viewed as a 4-connected sql tetragonal plane net (Fig. 4b). Finally, these 2D sheets are packed into a 3D supramolecular framework via intermolecular CHp interactions (CHp = 3.0829 A˚ and an angle of 139.61) (Fig. 4c); the dihedral between phenyl ring and imidazole ring is 80.76, which are well within the accepted rang of CHp interactions [20]. 3.3 PXRD Patterns and Thermal Analysis The experimental PXRD patterns of 1 and 2 correspond well with the simulated data based on the single crystal Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for 1 Cd(1)–O(1W) 2.272(7) Cd(1)–N(1) 2.311(6) Cd(1)–O(8)a 2.328(5) Cd(1)–N(3) 2.334(7) Cd(1)–O(2) 2.386(6) Cd(1)–O(1) 2.453(6) Cd(1)–O(7)a 2.576(6) Cd(2)–N(2) 2.292(7) Cd(2)–O(15) 2.299(8) Cd(2)–O(13) 2.318(7) Cd(2)–O(11) 2.333(6) Cd(2)–O(10) 2.548(6) Cd(2)–O(4)b 2.571(6) O(1 W)–Cd(1)–N(1) 90.3(2) O(1 W)–Cd(1)–O(8)a 130.7(2) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(8)a 83.9(2) O(1 W)–Cd(1)–N(3) 100.8(3) N(1)–Cd(1)–N(3) 167.5(2) O(8)a–Cd(1)–N(3) 84.5(2) O(1 W)–Cd(1)–O(2) 135.0(2) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(2) 87.6(2) O(8)a–Cd(1)–O(2) 93.7(2) N(3)–Cd(1)–O(2) 88.5(3) O(1 W)–Cd(1)–O(1) 82.1(2) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(1) 99.9(2) O(8)a–Cd(1)–O(1) 147.1(2) N(3)–Cd(1)–O(1) 87.4(3) O(2)–Cd(1)–O(1) 54.20(19) O(1 W)–Cd(1)–O(7)a 79.5(2) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(7)a 90.9(2) O(8)a–Cd(1)–O(7)a 51.9(2) N(3)–Cd(1)–O(7)a 85.5(3) O(2)–Cd(1)–O(7)a 145.43(19) O(1)–Cd(1)–O(7)a 158.7(2) O(5)b–Cd(2)–N(2) 139.8(3) O(5)b–Cd(2)–O(15) 93.7(3) N(2)–Cd(2)–O(15) 86.1(3) O(5)b–Cd(2)–O(13) 95.2(3) N(2)–Cd(2)–O(13) 85.6(3) O(15)–Cd(2)–O(13) 170.8(3) O(5)b–Cd(2)–O(11) 82.0(2) N(2)–Cd(2)–O(11) 137.8(2) O(15)–Cd(2)–O(11) 86.4(3) O(13)–Cd(2)–O(11) 97.0(2) O(5)b–Cd(2)–O(10) 134.8(2) N(2)–Cd(2)–O(10) 85.2(2) O(15)–Cd(2)–O(10) 84.7(3) O(13)–Cd(2)–O(10) 90.6(2) O(11)–Cd(2)–O(10) 52.8(2) O(5)b–Cd(2)–O(4)b 52.9(2) N(2)–Cd(2)–O(4)b 87.0(2) O(15)–Cd(2)–O(4)b 87.5(3) O(13)–Cd(2)–O(4)b 96.1(2) O(11)–Cd(2)–O(4)b 134.0(2) O(10)–Cd(2)–O(4)b 169.3(2) Symmetry codes: (a) -x ? 2, -y ? 1, -z; (b) -x ? 4, -y, -z ? 1 Table 3 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for 2 Cd(1)–N(1) 2.232(3) Cd(1)–N(3)a 2.248(3) Cd(1)–O(2) 2.302(3) Cd(1)–O(4)b 2.384(3) Cd(1)–O(3)b 2.398(3) Cd(1)–O(1) 2.442(3) N(1)–Cd(1)–N(3)a 104.73(12) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(2) 101.81(11) N(3)a–Cd(1)–O(2) 136.15(11) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(4)b 140.13(10) N(3)a–Cd(1)–O(4)b 84.16(11) O(2)–Cd(1)–O(4)b 97.10(9) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(3)b 85.68(10) N(3)a–Cd(1)–O(3)b 96.10(11) O(2)–Cd(1)–O(3)b 120.28(10) O(4)b–Cd(1)–O(3)b 54.53(9) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(1) 91.47(11) N(3)a–Cd(1)–O(1) 89.78(11) O(2)–Cd(1)–O(1) 55.11(10) O(4)b–Cd(1)–O(1) 127.85(9) O(3)b–Cd(1)–O(1) 173.95(9) Symmetry codes: (a) x, y, z ? 1; (b) x - 1, y - 1, z 390 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:388–394 123 diffraction thereby supporting reasonable phase purities (Fig. 5a, b).

Compounds 1–2 exhibit intense blue- luminescent emission bands maximum at 550 nm (kex = 421 nm), 548 nm (kex = 421 nm), respectively (Fig. 6). Considering that Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions are difﬁcult to oxidize or reduce, the luminescent emission of 1 and 2 may be ascribed to intraligand charge transfer [14]. Rela- tive to the free pamoic acid ligand, the red-shifts (76 nm for 1 and 74 nm for 2) of the emission bands may be caused by the enhancement owing to the rigidity of pamoic acid when it is coordinated to the metal centers. 4 Conclusions Two new luminescent coordination polymers were obtained by varying the auxiliary ligand. Compound 1 features a 2D?3D polythreaded framework based on (3,4)-connected 2D sheets, while compound 2 is a 4-con- nected sql tetragonal plane net, which further extended into a 3D supramolecular framework through intermolecular CHp interactions. In addition, the PXRD, TGA and emission spectra of 1 and 2 are reported. 5 Supplementary Data CCDC Nos. 953415 and 953416 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.
