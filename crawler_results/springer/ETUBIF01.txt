Manuscript COMMUNICATION Syntheses, Structures and Luminescent Properties of Zinc(II) and Cadmium(II) Complexes With the Ditopic Ligand 1,3-Bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene Rong-Yi Huang • Guang-Xiang Liu • Huan-Min Xu • Sadafumi Nishihara • Xiao-Ming Ren Received: 30 January 2010 / Accepted: 29 December 2011 / Published online: 10 January 2012  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 Abstract Three new complexes, namely [Zn(mbix)(SO4)] CH3OH (1), Cd(mbix)2(NO3)2 (2) and [Cd(mbix)2(H2O)2] (NO3)2 (3), have been obtained by reactions of ﬂexible bidentate ligand1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (mbix) with corresponding zinc(II) and cadmium(II) salts. The structures of these complexes have been determined by the X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis. Complex 1 features a 2D wavy network with (4,4) topology. Complex 2 has a 2D grid network with left- and right-handed helical chains, while complex 3 exhibits twofold parallel interpenetration structure. The differences of three complexes demonstrate that the coordination geometry of metal ions and the ratio of reactants have a great impact on the structure of the supramolecular architectures. The luminescent properties of three complexes are also investigated. Keywords Coordination polymer  Bis(imidazole) ligand  Crystal structure  Luminescence Introduction The design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks based on the selection of ligands and metal ions has become a very attractive research ﬁeld. The motive comes not only from the intriguing structural diversity but also from the demand for applications of functional materials in the ﬁelds of catalysis, porosity, magnetism, luminescence and nonlinear optics [1–4]. In general, grids with various sizes and shapes can be synthesized by choosing suitable single metal ions and organic ligands such as carboxylates, phosphates and N-donor groups [5–8]. Self-assembly is a complicated process, highly inﬂuenced by a lot of factors, such as the coordination geometry of metal ions, the nature of organic ligands, solvent system, temperature, pH value of the solution, the ratio between metal salt and ligand, the templates and the counter anions [9–17]. Except for these aspects, other forces such as hydrogen-bonding, p-p interactions, metal–metal interactions can also greatly inﬂuence the supramolecular topology and its dimensionality [18–21]. Hence, understanding how these considerations affect metal coordination and inﬂuence crystal packing is at the forefront of extending the area of the relevant structural types and ﬁnding out proper synthetic strategies leading to the anticipated compounds. We selected a ditopic ligand (mbix = 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene) with two imidazole rings occupying meta positions of a phenylene spacer group by means of methylene linkages. The aim of this study was to use a conformationally ﬂexible exo-bidentate ligand in order to explore its structural diversity. In this arti- cle, we report the syntheses, crystal structures, and lumines- cent properties of three new complexes, namely, [Zn(mbix) (SO4)](CH3OH) (1), Cd(mbix)2(NO3)2 (2) and [Cd(mbix)2 (H2O)2](NO3)2 (3).

Elemental analyses were determined using a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded in the range 4,000–400 cm-1 on a Nicolet AVATAR-360 spectrophotometer using a KBr pellet. The luminescence spectra for the powdered solid samples were measured at room temperature on a Hitachi F-4500 ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer with a xenon arc lamp as the light source. In the measurements of emission and excitation spectra, the pass width is 5 nm. Synthesis of Complex 1 Complex 1 was prepared by a layering method. A buffer layer of a solution (5 mL) of methanol and water (1:1) was carefully layered over an aqueous solution (3 mL) of ZnSO47H2O (57.5 mg, 0.2 mmol). Then a solution of mbix (47.6 mg, 0.2 mmol) in methanol (5 mL) was layered over the buffer layer. Colorless block crystals were obtained after 1 week. Yield: 47% (based on mbix). Anal.

X-Ray Crystallography The crystallographic data collections for complexes 1–3 were carried out on a Bruker Smart Apex II CCD with graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 293(2) K using the x-scan technique. The data were integrated by using the SAINT program [23], which was also used for the intensity corrections for the Lorentz and polar- ization effects. An empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program [24]. The structures were solved by direct methods using the program SHELXS- 97 [25] and all non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned aniso- tropically on F2 by the full matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXL-97 crystallographic software package [26]. The hydrogen atoms of the water molecules were located in a difference Fourier map, and the other hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically. All calculations were performed on a personal computer with the SHELXTL crystallographic software package. The details of the crystal parameters, data collection and reﬁnements for the com- plexes are summarized in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and angles with their estimated standard deviations are listed in Table 2.

As shown in Fig. 1a, the asymmetric unit of 1 contains one independent Zn (II) ion, one mbix, one coordinated SO4 2- ion, and one methanol molecule. The Zn(II) centre exhibits a distorted tetrahedral and is four coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two mbix (Zn–N 1.977(5) A˚ ) and two oxygen atoms from two SO4 2- ions (Zn–O 1.954(5)– 1.967(5) A˚ ). The angles around the Zn(II) ion range from 94.1(2) to 116.2(3)o (Table 2). All SO4 2- ions act in an anti–anti bidentate mode to bridge the two Zn(II) ions into wavy like inorganic –Zn–O–S–O– chains along the c-axis direction, with a ZnZn distance of 4.6038 (16) A˚ , the mbix ligands in the cis conformation serve as l2-bridge and link Zn(II) ions into metal–organic Zn-mbix chains along the a-axis direction, with a ZnZn distance of 12.563(5) A˚ . The two types of chains are interweaving with each other to form a 2D grid layer parallel to the ac plane (Fig. 1b). Moreover, very intriguingly, the zinc atoms distributed in the layer, are not coplanar. Rather, one-half fall in one plane, and half in an adjacent plane, the Zn–Zn–Zn angles are 140.319o in the inorganic –Zn–O–S–O– chains, resulting in the generation of a distinct corrugated 2D double-layer architecture, with a distance of 1.5626 A˚ between the two (Zn)n layers. If only Zn (II) ions are considered as framework atoms, the 2D layer also exhibits a distorted (4,4)-net topology (Fig. 1b). The 2D layers are further connected by hydrogen bonds to form the 3D net- work, as illustrated in Fig. 1c. However, when reaction of Zn(NO3)26H2O and mbix results in the other complexes [27] consisting of inﬁnite cationic double-stranded chains. The results showed that the counter anions play important roles in the assembly of the complexes. Based on CO and OO distance calculations there are weak hydrogen bonding interactions, which might contribute to stabiliza- tion of the whole MOF structure (Table 3). Crystal Structure of Complex 2 Complex 2 crystallizes in P21/c space group, with one-half Cd(II), one mbix and one monodentate-coordinated NO3 - in the asymmetric unit. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the Cd(II) centre exhibits a slightly distorted octahedral coordination environment with four N atoms at the equatorial plane from four different mbix ligands and two O atoms occupying the axial positions from two NO3 - ion with the coordination angles varying from 80.67(9) to 180.0o and bond lengths of Cd(1)–N(1) = 2.332(2) A˚ , Cd(1)–N(4A) = 2.319(2) A˚ , Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for 1–3 Symmetry t operators: Complex 1: #1 - x ? 2, -y ? 2, z - 1/2 #2 -x ? 2, y, z; Complex 2: #1 -x ? 1, y ? 1/2, -z ? 3/2; #2 x - 1, -y ? 1/2, z ? 1/2; #3 -x, -y ? 1, -z ? 2; Complex 3: #1 x, -y ? 1/2, z - 1/2; #2 x, -y ? 5/2, z - 1/2 [Zn(mbix)(SO4)]CH3OH (1) Zn(1)–O(1) 1.951(5) Zn(1)–N(1) 1.979(5) Zn(1)–O(2)#1 1.966(5) Zn(1)–N(1)#2 1.979(5) O(1)–Zn(1)–O(2)#1 94.1(2) O(1)–Zn(1)–N(1)#2 109.46(14) O(1)–Zn(1)–N(1) 109.46(14) O(2)#1–Zn(1)–N(1)#2 112.74(15) O(2)#1–Zn(1)–N(1) 112.74(15) N(1)–Zn(1)–N(1)#2 116.1(3) Cd(mbix)2(NO3)2 (2) Cd(1)–N(4)#1 2.319(2) Cd(1)–N(1) 2.332(2) Cd(1)–O(1) 2.381(3) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(1) 87.11(10) N(4)#1–Cd(1)–N(1) 91.02(9) N(4)#1–Cd(1)–O(1) 99.33(9) N(4)#2–Cd(1)–N(1) 88.98(9) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(1)#3 92.89(10) N(4)#1–Cd(1)–O(1)#3 80.67(9) [Cd(mbix)2(H2O)2](NO3)2 (3) Cd(1)–N(1) 2.327(3) Cd(1)–N(8)#2 2.336(2) Cd(1)–N(4)#1 2.299(2) Cd(1)–O(1W) 2.371(3) Cd(1)–N(5) 2.311(2) Cd(1)–O(2W) 2.398(3) N(4)#1–Cd(1)–N(5) 172.83(8) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(1W) 86.97(10) N(4)#1–Cd(1)–N(1) 92.79(8) N(8)#2–Cd(1)–O(1W) 84.31(10) N(5)–Cd(1)–N(1) 88.17(8) N(4)#1–Cd(1)–O(2W) 88.20(9) N(4)#1–Cd(1)–N(8)#2 91.43(9) N(5)–Cd(1)–O(2W) 84.64(9) N(5)–Cd(1)–N(8)#2 88.72(8) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(2W) 95.21(11) N(1)–Cd(1)–N(8)#2 170.40(9) N(8)#2–Cd(1)–O(2W) 93.54(11) N(4)#1–Cd(1)–O(1W) 91.38(10) O(1W)–Cd(1)–O(2W) 177.80(11) N(5)–Cd(1)–O(1W) 95.76(10) 418 J Chem Crystallogr (2012) 42:416–422 123 Cd(1)–O(1) = 2.381(3) A˚ (Table 2). Each Cd(II) ion is linked by four equivalent mbix ligands in the trans con- formation to its four neighboring Cd(II) ions. Complex 2 exhibits a two dimensional quadrangle grid layer with a uniform (4,4) net topology in the (102) plane (Fig. 2b). All the Cd(II) centres in each layer are strictly coplanar. The quadrangle grid has the dimensions of 14.2763(29) A˚ 9 14.2763(29) A˚ (metal to mental distances), and the CdCdCd corner angles (85.519(2)o and 94.481(2)o), suggesting a rhombus geometry. Each layer is composed of alternating left- and right-handed helices in the b-axis direction with a pitch of 19.385(6) A˚ (Fig. 2b). The adja- cent left- and right-handed helical chains are joined toge- ther by the Cd(II) centre, These helices are alternately arranged in a left- and right-handed sequence within 2D layer, so that the whole helical layer does not show chi- rality. The meso-helical layers are closely stacked in an offset way (Fig. 3d), and weak interlayer C–HO hydro- gen bonds (Table 3). The (Cd)n planes are parallel to each other with the interlayer distance is 3.6355 A˚ between adjacent (Cd)n planes. Crystal Structure of Complex 3 Complex 3 also crystallizes in P21/c space group and consists of (4,4) grid layers in which each Cd(II) is linked to four neighbors by four mbix ligands, but the use of the water molecular, instead of the nitrated ion in the complex 3, leads to obvious structural differences in ligand con- formation, grid geometry and dimensions, and crystal packing. As depicted in Fig. 3a, its asymmetric unit con- tains one Cd(II), two mbix, two coordinated water and two dissociated NO3 - ions with the coordination angles vary- ing from 84.31(10) to 177.80(11)o and bond lengths vary- ing from Cd–N 2.299(2) to 2.336(2) A˚ , Cd–O 2.371(3) and 2.398(3) A˚ (Table 2). Each Cd(II) binds four mbix, and each mbix connects two Cd(II), and all the Cd(II) centres in each layer are strictly coplanar, thus yielding a two Fig. 1 a ORTEP view of complex 1 showing 30% thermal proba- bility ellipsoids.

The grid layer motif in complex 3 is highly undulated because of the cis-conformation of the mbix ligand. To ﬁll the large void meshes in a single layer, two neighboring layers are entangled together in a parallel fashion, with the Cd(II) ions of one layer residing at the mesh centers of the other layer, to form an interpenetrated double layer with (4,4) topology (Fig. 3b). An interesting feature of the complex 3 is the double-helical structure along the b-axis direction with a pitch of 14.484(6) A˚ . As shown in Fig. 3b. Left- and right-handed double helical chains are arranged alternately to a two dimensional helical layer structure. The helical layers are further connected by hydrogen bonds to form a 3D network, as illustrated in Fig. 3c. Hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed lines. The (Cd)n planes are parallel to each other with an interlayer distance of 8.876(8) A˚ between adjacent (Cd)n planes. Because of the coexistence of left- and right-handed helices, the whole crystal is mesmeric and does not exhibit chirality. Luminescent Properties Luminescent complexes are currently of great interest because of their various applications in chemical sensors, photochemistry, and electroluminescent display [28, 29]. The emission spectra of complexes 1–3 and free ligand mbix in the solid at room temperature are shown in Fig. 4. The main emission peak of free ligand mbix is at 440 nm. Complexes 1–3 exhibit a main peak at 431 nm for 1, 433 nm for 2 and 434 nm for 3, respectively, which are probably caused by a combination of a HOMO and LUMO energy levels of neutral ligands coordinating to metal centers, a charge-transfer transition between ligands and metal centers, and a joint contri- bution of the intraligand transitions or charge-transfer transitions between the coordinated ligands and metal centers [21, 30]. Conclusions Summarizing, we have successfully synthesized and char- acterized three novel complexes. The successful syntheses of three complexes indicate that it is promising to build up unusual architectures via different metal ion and ratios of reactants. This study deepens our understanding of the grid structure in these complexes and excites our interest in crystal engineering. The luminescent properties of the complexes indicate that they may be good candidates for the engineering of luminescent materials.
