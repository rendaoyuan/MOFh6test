The Yb(III) atoms are linked by the deprotonated 1,4-BDC ligands in two kinds of bridging modes. Four Yb(III) atoms at each corner (nodes) and four 1,4-BDC ligands at each edge (spacers) form a edge–sharing 36-membered rings. The rhombohedral Yb4(1,4-BDC)4 arranged in an alternating fashion to con- struct a 1D ladder-like chain along the c axis. Two neighboring chains are linked to each other in a parallel fashion to construct 3D supramolecular structure by O–HO hydrogen bonds and p–p stacking interactions. In addition, the properties of thermogravimetric analysis and magnetic behaviors of the complex have been also discussed. Keywords Yb(III) complex  Hydrogen bonds  1D ladder-like chain Introduction The design and self-assembly construction of the metal– organic supramolecular compounds have attracted considerable interest in the ﬁeld of supramolecular chem- istry and crystal engineering in recent years, due to their intriguing diverse architectures and promising applications in molecular recognition and gas adsorption [1–4], catal- ysis [5–8], luminescence [9–13], ion-exchange [14–16] and so on. So far, the development of assembled chemistry has allowed the possibility to rationally design and prepare supramolecular architectures by exploiting non-covalent forces such as electrostatic attractions, hydrogen bonding and aromatic p–p stacking interactions. Previous studies for the multidentate polycarboxylate ligands, such as benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylate [17–19], benzenedicarboxylic acid [20–24], are widely employed to construct MOFs with open or porous frameworks. How- ever, the syntheses of MOFs have been exclusively cen- tered on transition metal polycarboxylate complexes, very few work has been carried out to investigate lanthanide– organic frameworks of benzenedicarboxylate and lantha- nide-doped coordination compound materials [25–27]. It is well-known that the lanthanide coordination polymers have attracted considerable interest with their large radii, high coordination numbers and special physical properties. In which, the Yb(III) compounds have the properties of long- lived near-infrared luminescence, antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the Ni(II) and Yb(III) ions and as a sensitiser [28–30]. 1,4-Benzenedicarboxylic acid (1,4- BDCH2) is a versatile linear aromatic ligand, which can act as short bridges via one carboxylic group or long bridges via the benzene ring, leading to abundant varieties of multi- dimensional coordination polymers [31, 32]. As reported, 1,4-BDC ligands link the transition-metals to form 2D or 3D networks [33–35], but 1,4-BDC as well as 1,10-phe- nanthroline (phen) ligands bridge Yb(III) centers to form 2D layers with rhombus grids [25]. Otherwise, not only 1,4-BDC can act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor but also as a J. Yao (&)  X. Cao  L. Zhang  Y. Wang  J. Guo  C.

In order to investigate the inﬂuence of the reacting con- ditions and the solvent system on the supramolecular com- pounds, in this paper, we have prepared the ﬁrst Yb(III) compound, {[Yb(1,4-BDC)1.5(H2O)4]H2O}n (1), consisting of the ladder-like inﬁnite 1D chains. In complex 1, the Yb(III) are linked by the deprotonated 1,4-BDC ligands as ‘‘middle rails’’ and ‘‘side rails’’ of the ladder-like chain in two kinds of bridging modes, which is different from the reported 1D ladder-like complexes based on the mixed- ligands, such as 1,2-BDC-bridged, oxamidato-bridged, azido-bridged etc. [38–40]. Herein, we report the synthesis, X-ray structure determination and magnetic behaviors. Experimental The 1,4-BDCH2 and YbCl36H2O were commercially of analytical grade and used without further puriﬁcation. Microanalysis was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 1400C element analyzer. Infrared spectra (4000–400 cm-1) were recorded using a Nicolet FT-IR 1709 spectrophotometer on KBr disks. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a Netzsch TG 209 simultaneous thermal analyser. The variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were obtained in the temperature range of 2–300 K at 2000 Oe with the use of a MPMS-7 SQUID magnetometer.

Crystal Structure Determination Suitable crystal of 1 with approximate dimension of 0.31 9 0.25 9 0.17 mm3 was glued on glass ﬁber and mounted on a Bruker APEX II CCD X-ray diffractometer with a graphite monochromate MoKa radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). The diffraction data were collected at 296(2) K. The structure was solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least squares on F2 by using the SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 program [41, 42]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms attached to carbon were positioned geometrically and allowed to ride on their respective parent atoms to which they are attached, while the hydrogen atoms of water molecules were located in the difference Fourier map and were reﬁned isotropically. Crystal data and data collection parameters are listed in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are shown in Table 2. Result and Discussion In the IR spectrum of the title complex 1, there is no absorption peak at about 1730 cm-1, indicating that two carboxylic groups of the organic ligand are deprotonated. The strong band at 3523 cm-1 (O–H stretching vibration) indicates the presence of water molecules. ORTEP diagram of the asymmetric unit of the title complex with atom numbering scheme is shown in Fig. 1, which contains one Yb(III) atom, a half and one 1,4-BDC anions, four coordination water molecules and one free water molecule. The Yb(III) atom is eight-coordinated by eight oxygen atoms from one chelating carboxylate group (O(1), O(2)), two monodentate carboxylate group (O(3), O(5)) belonging to different 1,4-BDC ligands and four water molecules (O(7), O(8), O(9), O(10)). There is only one type of coordination environment for the Yb(III) with the bond distances of Yb–O range from 2.193(6) to 2.514(6) A˚ , the average Yb–O distance (2.329 A˚ ) is similar to known Yb(III) complex [43]. The related bond angles O–Yb–O range from 53.3(2) to 153.2(2). It is found that the deprotonated 1,4-BDC ligands adopt two types of bridging coordination modes: (a) One carboxylate group adopts a monodentate coordination, leaving one oxygen atom uncoordinated, the other bidentated chelating coor- dination. (b) Both of the carboxylate groups adopt mono- dentate coordination. Two Yb(III) atoms are connected Fig. 2 View showing the 1D ladder-like chain in compound 1 with the arrangement of (4, 4) rings down the b axis and 1,4-BDC anions as ‘‘middle rails’’ and ‘‘side rails’’ Table 3 List of hydrogen bonds (A˚ , ) D-HA d(D-H) d(HA) d(DA) \(DHA) O(7)–H(1W)O(11)#4 0.85 2.01 2.856(9) 179.8 O(7)–H(2W)O(6)#5 0.85 1.90 2.751(8) 179.8 O(8)–H(3W)O(11)#4 0.83 1.97 2.797(10) 171.1 O(8)–H(4W)O(6)#4 0.83 2.02 2.825(10) 162.1 O(9)–H(5W)O(2)#6 0.83 1.91 2.722(9) 167.5 O(9)–H(6W)O(4)#7 0.83 2.12 2.882(9) 152.0 O(9)–H(6W)O(3)#7 0.83 2.66 3.205(8) 124.4 O(10)–H(7W)O(6) 0.83 1.87 2.661(9) 160.2 O(10)–H(8W)O(4)#8 0.83 1.96 2.763(9) 161.0 O(11)–H(9W)O(4)#8 0.84 1.99 2.793(9) 159.0 O(11)–H(10W)O(1)#9 0.84 2.02 2.823(9) 160.5 Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms #4 -x ? 1, -y ? 2, -z; #5 x ? 1, y, z; #6 -x ? 2, -y ? 1, -z; #7 -x ? 2, -y ? 1, -z ? 1; #8 -x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z ? 1; #9 x - 1, y, z 1402 J Chem Crystallogr (2011) 41:1400–1405 123 through a tridentate or a bidentate long bridging 1,4-BDC ligand. It is worthy to note that each Yb(III) center is linked to three other Yb(III) atoms by two tridentate (side rails) and at the same time a bidentate (middle rails) bridging 1,4-BDC ligand. Four Yb(III) atoms and four 1,4-BDC ligands form a edge–sharing (middle rails) 36-membered rings with a Yb(III) atom at each corner (nodes) and a 1,4-BDC ligand at each edge (spacers). The rhombohedral Yb4(1,4-BDC)4 arranged in an alternating fashion to construct a 1D ladder- like chain (Fig. 2) along the c axis. The Yb(III)–Yb(III) distances for ‘‘middle rails’’ and ‘‘side rails’’ of the rhombus are 11.818(3) A˚ and 10.470(4) A˚ , respectively, the internal angles are 33.800(4) and 146.200(6), respectively. The dihedral angle between the benzene ring planes is 57.15. An interesting structural feature of complex 1 is the hydrogen bonds, CH-p and p–p interactions extend the 1D ladder-like chains into a 3D supramolecular network. The interchain and intrachain O–HO hydrogen bonds are formed by free water (O(11)), coordinated water (O(7) O(8), O(9) and O(10)) and noncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms (O(1), O(2), O(3), O(4) and O(6)).

The corresponding data of O–HO hydrogen bonds are listed in Table 3 and illustrated in Fig. 3a. In addition, the benzene rings of the two nearest adjacent ladder-like chains are parallel to each other in pair with the center-to-center distance of 3.798 A˚ , indicating strong p–p contacts (Fig. 3b). Figure 3c shows that the intrachain CH-p interactions (edge-to-face) between the phenyl rings of two 1,4-BDC ligands with C(-H) to centroid distances of ca. 3.760 A˚ . Thermal Analyse of Complex 1 Thermogravimetric analysis under nitrogen was deter- mined with the polycrystalline samples as shown in Fig. 4. There were two weight losses in complex 1. The ﬁrst loses 18.2% of its weight in the range of 358–445 K with peak at 383 K, respectively, corresponding to the loss of all coor- dination and lattice water molecules (calc. 18.7%). The second losses 39.8% of its weight in the range 448–902 K with 1,4-BDC ligands with peak at 884 K. The decompo- sition process was completed at 1175 K giving white ytterbium oxide as the ﬁnal decomposition product, which constituted 39.1% of the initial weight. Magnetic Properties of Complex 1 Temperature-dependent molar susceptibility was measured from 2 to 300 K at 2 kOe for polycrystal samples of complex 1. The magnetic behavior is shown in Fig. 5 with the forms Fig. 4 TG curve of 1 measured under ﬂowing nitrogen Fig. 5 Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibilities of complex 1 1404 J Chem Crystallogr (2011) 41:1400–1405 123 of the plots vmT product and 1/vm versus T. At room tem- perature, the value of vmT is 4.38 cm3 K mol-1, which is smaller than the calculated value for two Yb(III) free ions (5.15 cm3 K mol-1). The vmT value decreases continuously on cooling to a value 3.19 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The weak antiferromagnetic interaction may be primarily from the splitting of the ligand ﬁeld of the Yb(III) ion and the possible contribution of the weak ferromagnetic coupling between the Yb(III) ions through the O–HO hydrogen bonds, CH-p and p–p interreactions mentioned above. The magnetic susceptibility above 100 K obeys the Curie–Weiss law with C = 2.53 cm3 K mol-1 and h = -17.28 K. The negative h values indicates antiferromagnetic interaction between the Yb(III) ions. The weak antiferromagnetic interaction implies that the bridging 1,4-BDC ligand in title complex is a poor super exchange mediator with the greater separation (11.82 and 10.47 A˚ ).
