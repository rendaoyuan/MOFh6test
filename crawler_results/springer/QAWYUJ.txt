Manuscript Hydrothermal synthesis, conversion reaction, and crystal structure of 2-D 2-bromo-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate copper(II) complex with 2,2¢-bipyridine Ai-Qing Ma and Long-Guan Zhu* Department of Chemistry, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027 P.R. China Received 31 March 2005; accepted 23 May 2005 Abstract A fully deprotonated 2-bromo-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate copper(II) complex, [Cu(bbdc)(2,2¢-bipy)](H2O) (bbdc= 2-bromo-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate dianion, 2,2¢-bipy=2,2¢-bipyridine), was synthesized under hydrothermal con- ditions. This compound also can be prepared from the partly deprotonated [Cu(Hbbdc)2(2,2¢-bipy)] under basic and hydrothermal conditions. The crystal structure consists of inﬁnite chains of [Cu2(l4-bbdc)]2+ building blocks connected by bis-monodentate bbdc ligands and exhibits an extended 2-D architecture. Introduction Network diversity of coordination polymers is cur- rently under intensive exploration due to the impor- tant relationship between structures and properties as functional materials [1–4]. In the system of Cu2+/ 4,4¢-bipy/salicylic acid, six networks covering 0-D, 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D were successfully constructed due to partly and fully deprotonated properties of the combination of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups [5–7], while for binary carboxylic acid, such as benzene-1, 4-dicarboxylic acid, networks with partly deproto- nated ligands are sparse. In the previous work [8], we used 2-bromo-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2bbdc) and obtained a partly deprotonated compound, [Cu(Hbbdc)2(2,2¢-bipy)] (2), in which the structure has an extended 2-D hydrogen bonding network with dou- ble layers. Here, we report the further exploration of this system and the novel coordinated 2-D compound, namely {[Cu(bbdc)(2,2¢-bipy)](H2O)}n (1). Experimental Materials and physical measurements All starting materials were purchased from the Acros Organics and were of reagent grade. C, H, and N ele- mental analyses were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer analyzer model 1110. The i.r. spectra (KBr pellets) were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 470 infrared spec- trophotometer in the 400–4000 cm)1 region. Electronic spectra were recorded by SPECORD 2000 in the solid state. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Delta Series TA-SDT Q600 in a nitro- gen atmosphere in the 25–800 C range (heating rate=10 C/min). The photoluminescence study was carried out on a powdered sample in the solid state at room temperature using Hitachi 850 spectrometer. Synthesis of compound (1) A mixture of CuCl2 Æ 2H2O (0.034 g, 0.2 mmol), 2-bro- mo-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2bbdc, 0.049 g, 0.2 mmol), 2,2¢-bipyridine (0.032 g, 0.2 mmol), NaOH (0.008 g, 0.2 mmol), and H2O (8 cm3) in the molar ratio ca. 1:1:1:1:2220 was sealed in a 25 cm3 Teﬂon-lined stainless-steel reactor and heated at 150 C for 6 h. After cooling, light blue crystals of (1) were collected by ﬁltration. Yield: 78%. (Found: C, 45.2; H, 2.8; N, 6.0%. C18H13CuBrN2O5 calcd.: C, 44.5; H, 2.7; N, 5.8%). IR (KBr, cm)1): 1631 (s), 1602 (s), 1475 (w), 1445 (w), 1386 (m), 1356 (s), 1340 (s), 1245 (w), 1149 (w), 1035(w), 830 (w), 775 (m), 728 (w), 665 (w). The lattice water was conﬁrmed by DTA-TG analysis. In the range, room temperature to 90 C, weight loss is 3.6% (calcd. 3.7%), which corresponds to the loss of one water molecule. Conversion of (2) into (1) A mixture of [Cu(Hbbdc)2(2,22¢-bipy)] (2) (0.086 g, 0.012 mmol), NaOH (0.009 g, 0.23 mmol), and H2O (8 cm3) was sealed in a 25 cm3 Teﬂon lined stainless- steel reactor and heated at 140 C for 8 h. After cool- ing, blue crystals of (1) were obtained. Crystallography A crystal with dimensions 0.24 mm · 0.15 mm · 0.12 mm for compound (1) was carefully selected and mounted on a Bruker Smart CCD area detector with graphite monochromatized MoKa radiation * Author for correspondence: Tel.: +86-571-87963867; Fax: +86-571- 87951895; E-mail: chezlg@zju.edu.cn Transition Metal Chemistry (2005) 30:869–872  Springer 2005 DOI 10.1007/s11243-005-6234-1 (k=0.71073 A˚ ) at room temperature. An empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program [9]. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 [10] and reﬁned by least- squares procedures on F2 o with SHELXL-97 [11] in the WinGX environment [12]. H atoms for the water mol- ecule were found in a Fourier map and were reﬁned isotropically, and H atoms bonded to C atoms were added in calculated positions with CAH distances of 0.93 A˚ while one hydrogen atom of bbdc2) was not added because of the disorder of the bromo group and the site occupancy factors of disordered bromo atoms over two sites were ﬁxed as 0.50, respectively. Crystal data and structure reﬁnements are given in Table 1. Results and discussion Compound (1) reveals a 2-D framework. The copper atom displays square pyramidal geometry, which is completed by two nitrogen donors from one 2,2¢-bi- pyridine, three carboxylate oxygen donors from three bbdc ligands (Figure 1 and Table 2). Atom O(1) is located on the apical position with an elongated CuAO distance [Cu(1)AO(1)=2.386(4) A˚ ] and atoms N(1), N(2), O(1*), and O(3) occupy the basal plane. Two kinds of bbdc coordination modes are observed in compound (1). One mode is bis-monodentate while the other has a bis-mono-atomic bridge mode. In the bis-mono-atomic bridge mode, each of two carboxyl groups in l4-bbdc oﬀers a mono-atomic bridge by using one oxygen atom as the asymmetric l-O bridge bound to two copper ions in both apical and basal positions. The oxygen bridging linkers form a four- membered ring [Cu2O2] with CuÆÆÆCu separation 3.403(1) A˚ , namely a second building unit (SBU), which is a basic unit to extend the structure into one- dimensional and two-dimensional networks (Figure 2). The CuÆÆÆCu separations through l4-bbdc are 11.016(2) A˚ and 9.417(1) A˚ , respectively. This infor- mation strongly suggests that the substitution group, bromo, is aﬀecting the nature of the network as com- pared to 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate complexes [13]. The short distance of CuÆÆÆCu separated by bbdc is ex- tremely rare, only found in mono-atomic bridge cases, and corresponding separations of CuÆÆÆCu in the com- pound Cu2(trans-oxen)(bdc) Æ 2H2O are 10.987 and 9.672 A˚ , respectively [14]. The bis-monodentate bbdc bridging spacers connect 1-D chains of [Cu2(l4-bbdc)] via four-membered units of [Cu2O2] into a 2-D frame- work. The separation of CuÆÆÆCu by bis-monodentate bbdc is 11.051(2) A˚ . Obviously, in nature, the 2-D net- work consists of [Cu2O2 + bbdc]4 building blocks. Therefore, the basic unit in 2-D is a grid of [Cu4(l4- bbdc)2(l2-bbdc)2] with dimensions ca. 9.4 · 11.0 A˚ . The two-dimensional network of [Cu2(l4-bbdc)(l2- bbdc)]n is created without 2,2¢-bipyridine linking. It seems that the 2,2¢-bipyridine is not necessary from the synthetic viewpoint. In fact, it could be necessary in the construction of the network because the 2,2¢- bipyridine can adjust the micro synthetic environment and this together with the bromo group through steric and electric eﬀects lead to the 2-D assembly frame- work. The water molecules, between the two-dimen- sional sheets, form hydrogen bonds with the uncoordinating carboxyl oxygen atoms of l4-bbdc and l2-bbdc from neighboring two-dimensional layers to hold nets together and build up the three-dimen- sional architecture. Compound (2) is a monomeric species with partly deprotonated Hbbdc) and the extended structure is a 2-D hydrogen bonding network [8]. The fully deproto- nated bbdc2) makes compound (1) to form a 2-D coordination architecture. In fact, compounds (1) and (2) were initially obtained by separate experiments. Further experimental exploration shows us an interest- ing phenomenon. Compound (1) could be synthesized using (2) as starting material under hydrothermal con- ditions by adding NaOH. Especially compound (1), synthesized from compound (2), maintains the single- crystallinity and the process of single crystals to single crystals was achieved. The conversion between two sta- ble states indicates that diﬀerent functional properties could be converted under hydrothermal conditions. The UV-Visible spectrum of (1) exhibits one high- energy absorption at 320 nm in the solid state. An intense ﬂuorescent emission of (1) at 470.5 nm (kex=220 nm) was observed in the solid state at room temperature and is assigned to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer band and to some r-donations from the cooperation of 2,2¢-bipyridine and bbdc ligands [15–16]. In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized a novel 2-D compound [Cu(bbdc)(2,2¢-bipy)](H2O) con- structed from 2-bromo-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid Table 1.

Combination of l4-bbdc and l2-bbdc leads to new assembly of phenyldicarboxylates, which may be of great beneﬁt for designing and controlling the frame- works constructed from phenyldicarboxylates. Interest- ingly, the crystal-to-crystal transform was observed and the 2-D hydrogen bonding network was converted into 2-D coordination architecture in the process of transformation.
