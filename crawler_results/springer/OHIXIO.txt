Chiral and achiral helical coordination polymers of zinc and cadmium from achiral 2,6-bis(imidazol-1-yl)pyridine: Solvent effect and spontaneous resolution SARITA TRIPATHI, RENGANATHAN SRIRAMBALAJI, NAMITA SINGH and GANAPATHI ANANTHARAMAN∗ Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur 208 016, India e-mail: garaman@iitk.ac.in MS received 13 February 2014; revised 5 April 2014; accepted 7 April 2014 Abstract. Four 2D helical coordination polymers (CPs) (1–4) were synthesized using achiral 2,6-bis (imidazol-1-yl)pyridine (pyim2) ligand with metal nitrates (metal = zinc and cadmium), which showed that variation in the solvent condition leads to difference in geometry around the central metal ion and results in chiral/achiral behaviour of these CPs. By using (pyim2), [trans-Zn(pyim2)2(NO3)2]n (1) was obtained by unary solvent (MeOH), while [trans-Cd(pyim2)2(NO3)2]n (2) was formed under binary solvent mixtures (DMF/MeOH). On the other hand, in ternary solvent mixture (DMF/MeOH/H2O) it resulted into an achiral {[trans-Zn(pyim2)2(H2O)2]·(NO3)2}n (3) and homochiral {[cis-Cd(pyim2)2(H2O)2]·(NO3)2}n (4) coordination polymer, respectively. The homochiral behaviour of the coordination polymer (4) was further studied by solid state CD spectra and also its optical behaviour was analyzed by polarimetry. Keywords.

Introduction Coordination polymers (CPs) have been an area of pro- found interest over the past two decades, not only for their rational design and intriguing topologies, but also for their potential application in various ﬁelds like stor- age, separation, magnetism, catalysis, and non-linear optics.1–5 Among the reported CPs, in recent years, a signiﬁcant research interest has been devoted for chiral helical structural motifs.6 Chirality is one of the most important aspects of nature and is an intrinsic feature of various states of matters. Chirality and helicity are closely related terms and are strongly associated with the biological systems; in particular, chirality is often expressed as helical motifs in nature. Moreover, these helical architectures not only have fascinating struc- tural features, but they have been playing several key functions in natural systems.7 Emulating nature’s design in artiﬁcial systems like chiral helical CPs is an interesting area of research. Generally, there are four different strategies to prepare homochiral CPs.8 First, by the use of readily available chiral ligands, which serve as the building blocks and thus, transfer their chiral behavior to the resulting CP.9 Second, the use of chiral auxiliary ligands, which bind ∗For correspondence to the metal ion and induce homochirality in the CP formed.10 Third, by using chiral templates, solvents or additives which may induce chirality in the resultant framework.11 Finally, by simply using achiral ligands and metal precursors, in which spontaneous resolution occurs due to the chiral spatial arrangement of ligands coordination around the metal ion.12–15 The advantage provided by the last method lies in the fact that it does not use any chiral components, which are difﬁcult to prepare and some of them are quite expensive. In general, the synthesis of chiral helical CPs using semi-rigid/ﬂexible achiral ligands is a challeng- ing research ﬁeld. Many of the structures reported in the literature are either racemic, with both P() and M() helices running along the crystallographic axis, or conglomerates, wherein both P and M crystals are present in the reaction mixture and the structure remains unpredictable.8 In contrast, the preparation of chiral coordination complexes is a very well established procedure and it dates back to Werner, who showed that the complex chi- rality depends on formation of cis coordination geom- etry around the metal ion with appropriate chelating/ monodentate ligands. This can be understood based on the symmetry criteria that the absence of improper axis of rotation results in chirality.16 Keeping this in view, if one analyzes the coordination geometry of the 1423 1424 Sarita Tripathi et al. metal centers in the reported structures of helical CPs, it can be seen that the racemic structures are present in cases where the metal coordination geometry is trans, whereas, homochiral CPs are found to have cis coordination geometry at the metal centers with at least one chelating or two heteroatomic mono-dentate ligands.12–15 Considering these facts, we have chosen an angular semi-rigid achiral ligand, of 2,6-bis(imidazol-1-yl)pyri- dine(pyim2)17 and carried outthereactionswithzinc and cadmium nitrates under different solvent mixtures. In this paper, we report the synthesis of four CPs, [trans- M(pyim2)2(NO3)2]n [M = Zn(1), Cd (2)], {[trans- Zn(pyim2)2(H2O)2]·(NO3)2(3) and {[cis-Cd(pyim2)2 (H2O)2]·(NO3)2}n (4), (scheme 1). Among these CPs, 1-3 are achiral, whereas 4 crystallize in chiral space group C2. Also the solubility of 4 in DMSO helped in evaluation of its solution behaviour using NMR and polarimetry. Previously, Lee and co-workers studied the con- formational effects of pyim2 in the preparation of zinc halide CPs under hydrothermal or solvothermal conditions.17a Interestingly, the hydrothermal reactions resulted in the formation of conglomerates, with larger N· · · N· · · N angle (161◦), whereas, zig-zag and sin- gle helical structures, with shorter N· · · N· · · N angle (142◦and 122◦), were formed respectively under the solvothermal reaction. In general, the hydrothermal or solvothermal reactions yield only the most stable prod- ucts. However to understand structural transformations, milder experimental conditions are necessary. 2.

All the struc- tures were solved using SHELXS-97 and reﬁned by full-matrix least squares on F2 using SHELXL-97. All hydrogen atoms were included in idealized positions using a riding model. Non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters.20–22 3. Results and Discussion 3.1 Synthesis The room temperature syntheses of all the CPs were carried out by taking the metal nitrates of zinc and cad- mium with pyim2 in the stoichiometric ratio 1:2. By using a unary solvent (MeOH) and binary solvent systems (MeOH/DMF), the CPs 1 and 2 were obtained respectively. These polymers were insoluble in com- mon organic solvents. The formulations were conﬁrmed by the elemental analyses and it is in very good agree- ment with the single crystal X-ray crystallographic studies. It has been established that the use of solvents in the reaction medium play a critical role in the formation of CPs.17 In particular, water assisted structural changes have been studied recently by Zhang and co-workers.18 Also, earlier, Aoyoma and others had shown that the solvent assisted formation of stereoisomeric products resulted in the formation of chiral CPs, in some cases.15 In order to ascertain the possibility of the forma- tion of stereoisomeric product, the reactions of metal nitrates of zinc and cadmium with pyim2 were carried out in 1:2 molar ratios using the ternary solvent sys- tem (MeOH/DMF/H2O). Indeed the products obtained (3 and 4) were different, from 1 and 2 irrespective of the similar composition of the starting materials. Both the compounds (3 and 4) were insoluble in common organic solvents except in DMSO, in which they show moderate solubility. The 1H NMR spectra of 3 and 4 recorded in DMSO-d6 did not have any appreciable change from the ligand spectrum. The IR spectra indi- cated a broad absorption peak around 3400 cm−1 sug- gesting the presence of water molecules in 3 and 4. The ﬁnal structure were conﬁrmed unambiguously by the single crystal X-ray structural analysis. 1426 Sarita Tripathi et al. 3.2 Crystal structures The single crystal X-ray structure analysis reveals that both the polymeric structures 1 and 2 crystallize in mo- noclinic space group P21/n and they are isostructural (table 1). The important bond distances and angles are given in legend of ﬁgure 1. The zinc and cadmium ions are in octahedral trans coordination geometry of MN4O2 environment with ligation from four nitrogen atoms of different imidazole units of pyim2 in the plane and two oxygen atoms of two different nitrate ions bound to the metal from its axial position (ﬁgure 1a). The other imidazole ring of pyim2 connects the metal ions by the planes of the octahedron to form the 2D rhombic grid structures (ﬁgure 1b). Within the 2D network of 1 and 2, all the 1D chains run into two nearly perpendicular directions and no interpenetration between the chains were observed. The average Zn-N and the Cd-N bond distances are 2.135(3) Å and 2.327(3) Å respectively (ﬁgure 1). The Zn-O and the Cd-O bond distances are 2.201(3) Å and 2.344(4) Å respectively and are consistent with those of reported values [M(2,5-bis(4’-(imidazol-1- yl)benzyl)-3,4-diaza-2,4-hexadiene)2(NO3)2]n[M = Zn, Cd].19 However, in these structures one of the imida- zole ring deviated from the plane of the pyridine ring with a dihedral angle of 37.527(13)◦and 33.376(13)◦ (ﬁgure S4). Consequently, the individual chains are arranged into a helical mode, with different chirality, left-handed M () and right-handed P (), to form a racemic structure (ﬁgure 1c). The 2D network of 1 and 2 was further connected by C-H...O interactions arising from the C-H of the pyridine ring and oxygen of nitrate ion from the adjacent layer and packed to complete the 3D structure (ﬁgure 1d-e). Single crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that the complex {[trans-Zn(pyim2)2(H2O)2]·(NO3)2}n (3) crystallize in monoclinic space group P21/c (table 1). Similar to 1, the structure of 3 is a 2D helical rhom- bic grid structure with some marked differences. It con- sists of a ZnN4O2 octahedral unit, where zinc is coor- dinated by four different nitrogen atoms of imidazole ring of pyim2 ligand, which are trans to each other in the plane. Whereas, unlike in 1, the axial positions of the metal centres are occupied by water molecules, instead of nitrate ions, and they are also trans to each other (ﬁgure 2a). The adjacent layers of zinc octa- hedral units are oriented perpendicular to each other and they are connected through the planes by nitrogen atoms of imidazole rings of pyim2 to form the 2D struc- ture (ﬁgure 2b). Like 1, here every non-interpenetrating 1D chain has opposite helicity and thus results in the formation of a racemic structure (ﬁgure 2c). Zn-N bond distances in 3 are shorter as compared to 1 and they are Table 1.

Further, the third oxygen atom of the nitrate ions shows shorter C-H interactions of two imi- dazole rings and a pyridine to form 3D network of this 2D helical coordination polymer (ﬁgure 2d). Unlike in the case of 3, the single crystal X-ray diffraction study shows that the complex {[cis-Cd (pyim2)2(H2O)2]·(NO3)2}n (4) crystallize in chiral mon- oclinic space group C2 (table 1). The structure of 4 consists of octahedral cadmium unit CdN4O2, where cadmium atom is surrounded by oxygen atoms (O1) from two H2O molecules, and four nitrogen atoms (N1 and N5) from different pyim2 forming a cis coordi- nation geometry (ﬁgure 3a). The imidazole nitrogen atoms of pyim2 connect adjacent layers of the cad- mium centre through an equatorial-axial fashion to form the 2D CPs (ﬁgure 3b). Among the two imi- dazoles, one of the imidazole rings is out of plane (24.367◦) with respect to the pyridine rings, which orig- inates the helical structures between the adjacent layers of the 4. Unlike 1–3, these helices are of the same type, right-handed helix (P) along b axis (ﬁgure 3c). The lay- ers consisting of double helices are further stabilized through π- π interaction between pyridine rings which are stacked face to face on one another. The centroid to centroid distance is 3.168 Å and the angle between the planes is 0.91◦. This π–π interaction leads to a 3D 1428 Sarita Tripathi et al. Figure 2.

The stereoisomeric changes in the coordination geo- metry from CPs 1–3 coupled with the C-N bond rota- tion greatly inﬂuences the structural changes observed in this 2D coordination polymer, 4. Thus, the chiral- ity () is observed due to the combined effect of cis- orientation of the pyim2 and water molecules around the cadmium centre as well as the non-planarity between imidazole and pyridine rings due to the twist in C-N bond between pyridine and imidazoles of the ligand. The homochirality of 4 in bulk was conﬁrmed by taking crystals of different reaction batches for sin- gle crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. In all these cases, the structural solution led to the single-handed helicity with the same chirality of 4, having the least Flack parameter value [0.001(1)]. Further, the bulk samples of two to three different batches were taken for the solid state CD spectrum and solution state polarimetry studies as well as PXRD (ﬁgure S2). 3.3 CD spectra The solid state CD spectrum of coordination polymer 4 was recorded between 190–500 nm at 20◦C. The CD spectrum showed very small negative Cotton effects between 190–350 nm range indicating the existence of homochiralityofthe coordinationpolymer,4(figure S3). 3.4 Polarimetry However, the solution state polarimetric measurements recorded in DMSO solvent showed rotation of the plane Chiral and Achiral Coordination polymers from 2,6-bis(imidazol-1-yl)pyridine 1429 Figure 3.

However, it is to be mentioned that after an hour, the loss of chirality of 4 was observed in the same solution. 3.5 Thermogravimetric analysis The thermal stability of 1–4, was studied using the ther- mogravimetric analysis (TGA) (ﬁgure S4). The TGA proﬁles indicated that 1 is thermally stable up to 240◦C without any loss of weight. Around 240–400◦C the framework showed 46.0% weight loss corresponding to the loss of one ligand and one nitrate molecule (calculated, 44.63 wt%). The second weight loss of 39.3% around 400–680◦C corresponded to the loss of another ligand and another nitrate molecule (calculated, 44.63 wt%) (residue 14.1%). The TGA proﬁle indicated that 2 is thermally stable up to 311◦C without any loss of weight. Around 311–372◦C the framework showed 39.1% weight loss corresponding to the loss of one lig- and and one nitrate molecule (calculated, 41.44 wt%). The CP shows a gradual weight loss around 380◦C cor- responding to the loss of another ligand and another nitrate molecule (residue 13.1%). The TGA proﬁle of 3 indicated that it was thermally stable up to 150◦C and showed ﬁrst weight loss of around 6% due to two water molecules at 150–190◦C (calculated, 5.55 wt%). The second weight loss of 47.6% was observed at around 250–390◦C due to the loss of two nitrate ions and one ligand (calculated, 51.72 wt %). The third weight loss of 30% was observed at 530–700◦C for another ligand (calculated, 32.58 wt %) (residue 22.0%). The TGA proﬁle of 4 indicated that it was thermally stable upto 140◦C without any weight loss. At around 140–190◦C it showed weight loss of 6.0 % due to loss of two water molecules (calculated, 5.18 wt %). Then the next weight loss of 43.0 % was observed around 250–400◦C cor- responding to two nitrate ions and one ligand (calcu- lated, 48.22 wt %). The third weight loss of 28.0% was at around 550–740◦C due to another ligand molecule (calculated, 30.37 wt%) (residue 26.1%). 4. Conclusion Four new CPs (1–4) were synthesized using achiral angular ditopic ligand (pyim2) and structurally charac- terized, in which lone pair on pyridine nitrogen were not involved in coordination with metal centres. The latter can be used as a source of Lewis base assisted organic reaction or transformation. These CPs showed different metal coordination environment and structures with change of solvent conditions. The result was the formation of a homochiral coordination polymer 4 by spontaneous resolution. The homochirality in bulk of the product 4 was further supported by recording the optical activity using polarimetry and in solid state CD spectra. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that the solution state polarimetric mea- surements were carried out for the CPs. Further, studies on the preparation of chiral CPs using different metal salts using pyim2 and other co-ligands under soft route and their use as chiral platform for the separation and catalysis are under progress.
