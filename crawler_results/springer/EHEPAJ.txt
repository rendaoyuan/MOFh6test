Keywords Aromatic carboxylate  Gd complex  Co-ordination polymer Introduction Metal–organic co-ordination polymers [1, 2], especially rare earth metal-containing co-ordination polymers have attracted continuous attention due to their potential applications as function materials such as catalysis, non-linear optics, and porous materials, which stem from their unique 5d and 4f electron conﬁgurations [3–6]. So far, the coordinated chemistry of the rare earth metal is virtually underdeveloped because of some intrinsic characteristics such as the high and variable coordination numbers as well as the small energy difference among various coordination geometries [3]. Aromatic multicarboxylates are good building blocks for the construction of metal–organic coordination polymers due to their versatile coordinated modes of carboxyl groups, and a series of interesting lanthanide polymers have been obtained by employing benzoic multicarboxylate ligands [7–9].

Due to the good ﬂexibility of r-bond, two pyridine rings can rotate in some extend, leading to versatile conformations and coordination modes. So dimension extention will be achieved due to the better ﬂexibility of this ligand than that of benzoic multicarboxylate ligands. It is a good building block for the construction of rare metal polymers through full or partial deprotonation of its carboxylic groups [10–13]. But up to now, the rare earth metal coordination polymers constructed from H2BPDC are still rare [14–17]. In this work, through hydrothermal reaction of 2,20-bipyridyl-4,40-dicarboxylic acid with Gd(III), we have obtained a new open framework structure {[Gd2(BPDC)3(H2O)3]H2O}n. (1). Experimental General Remarks All chemicals were analytically pure and used without any puriﬁcaiton. Elemental analysis was performed on a Vario MICRO instrument. The infrared spectra of single crystals was recorded with a Perkin–Elmer Spectrum-2000 FTIR spectro- photometer (4000–400 cm-1) on powdered sample spread on KBr plate. Optical diffuse reﬂectance spectrum was measured on a PE Lambda 35 UV–vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere at 293 K, and the BaSO4 plate was used as the reference. Fluorescence spectrum was carried out on a PW2424 spectrometer. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku X-ray MiniFlexII diffractometer.

The intensity data were corrected with empirical absorption. The structure was solved by direct method in SHELXS-97 program [18]. All of the non-hydrogen atoms and some of the hydrogen atoms were located by successive difference Fourier synthesis, and the anisotropic thermal parameters for non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F2 calculation for 561 parameters. The ﬁnal cycle of reﬁnement gave rise to R1 = 0.0362, wR2 = 0.0960, w = 1/[r2(FO)2 ?

Results and Discussion Description of Crystal Structure Single crystal X-ray analysis reveals that {[Gd2(BPDC)3(H2O)3]H2O}n.(1) is a three-dimensional framework constructed from versatile coordination modes of carboxyl groups, hydrogen bond interactions and pp stacking interactions. The structure of [Gd2(BPDC)3(H2O)3]n. framewrok can be discussed in terms of Gd2O14 cluster. In the Gd2O14 cluster, Gd(1) is in eight-coordinated dicapped triangular prism environment, where six oxygen atoms are provided by carboxyl groups and two oxygen atoms (O(2),O(3)) stem from water molecules. Gd(2) is also in eight- coordinated dicapped triangular prism geometry, but its seven oxygen donors are provided by carboxyl groups and only one oxygen donor (O(13)) is water. Gd(1)O8 dicapped triangular prism connects with Gd(2)O8 polyhedron via edge-sharing mode (the edge is deﬁned by O(4)–O(8)) to give a Gd2O14 cluster (Fig. 1). In other words, Gd(1)O8 and Gd(2)O8 are linked by bis-monodentate bridge carboxyl (L2, as deﬁned in the following paragraphy). Gd(1)O8 dicapped triangular prism is highly distorted with Gd–O distances ranging from 2.298(3) to 2.755(3)A˚ , but the polyhedron of Gd(2) is much more normal with Gd–O distances being among 2.281(3)–2.534(3) A˚ . The Gd–Gd distance is 4.0461(17) A˚ , which is longer than the sum of its atomic radius (3.6 A˚ ), indicating the absence of direct metal–metal Table 2 Hydrogen bond lengths (A˚ ) and bond angles () D–H d(D–H) d(HA) \DHA d(DA) A O(3)–H(3A) 0.868 1.814 173.32 2.678 O(1) O(2)–H(2A) 0.955 2.080 158.49 2.989 N(3) [–x ? 2, -y ? 2, -z] O(2)–H(2B) 0.990 1.863 166.69 2.836 O(7) [-x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z] O(13)–H(13A) 1.041 1.735 172.13 2.769 N(2) [x-1, y, z] O(13)–H(13B) 1.034 2.173 148.64 3.103 N(1) [x, y ? 1, z] O(13)–H(13B) 1.034 2.651 111.84 3.183 O(14) [–x ? 2, -y ? 2, -z ? 1] O(3)–H(3B) 0.976 1.709 169.83 2.675 O(10) 828 H.-J. Dong et al. 123 interactions. All the C–O bond lengths of deprotonated carboxyl groups are in normal range (1.235(5) to 1.274(5) A˚ ) [6]. The coordination mode of carboxyl groups is versatile in the title compound. The observation of an absorption peak at 1635 cm-1 for –COO- in the IR spectrum indicates the presence of deprotonated carboxylic groups in the complex, all the –COOH is deprotonated with BPDC2- anion. To our interest, structural data show there are three kinds of carboxylate ligands. The ﬁrst is that the deprotonated carboxylic group adopts a l4-bidentate chelating-bridging mode to connect four Gd atoms (deﬁned as L1, provide O(4), O(6), O(8), O(15) for Gd(1) and Gd(2) centers, Fig. 2a). The second is that carboxylic group acts as l4-bridge with bis-monodentate bridge mode to link four Gd atoms, in which each deprotonated carboxylic group bridges two Gd atoms (deﬁned as L2, provide O(7), O(9) for Gd(2) center, Fig. 2b). The third is that the ligand acts as l2-bridge to link two Gd atoms, in which each protonated carboxylic group coordinates to one Gd atom through one carbonyl Fig.1 Structure of Gd2O14 cluster revealing coordination mode of Gd centers Fig. 2 Coordination modes of carboxyl groups in BPDC2- ligand A New Rare-Earth Metal Coordination Polymer 829 123 oxygen atoms (with monodentate bridge mode) (deﬁned as L3, give O(10) for coordinating to Cd(1) center, and O(12) is free, Fig. 2c). The series of IR peaks ranging from 1647 to 1445 cm-1 (corresponding to vas and vs of –COO- groups) also validate the rich coordinated modes of carboxyl groups. Two pyridine rings in BPDC2- ligands are generally coplanar, except a small dihedral angle in L2 (11.75) can be observed. As mentioned in the introduction, two pyridine rings are linked by r-bond and exhibit good ﬂexibility. As expect, a 180 rotation of two pyridine rings can be found all BPDC ligands. As a result, versatile conformations and coordination modes of carboxyl groups have achieved (Fig. 3). Adjacent Gd2O14 clusters are linked by bis-monodentate carboxyl bridge of L2 (one of its carboxyl group) to give a 1-D chain along (111) direction (Fig. 3). The 1-D chain are extended to be a 2-D layer via monodentate carboxyl bridge of L3 (Fig. 4). And ﬁnally, adjacent layers are connected to be a 3-D network via bidentate chelating-bridging and bis-monodentate carboxyl bridge of L1 and L2 (Fig. 5). In the layer-bridged ligands, a mediate pp stacking interactions (barycenter distance: 3.818(13) A˚ between L1 and L2) can be observed between pyridine rings. Finally, an isolated water molecule also stack in the crystal with the total potential solvent accessible void volume of 79.6 A˚ 3. Strong O–HO and O–HN hydrogen bonds between this water and BPDC2- ligands can be detected and contribute to the stabilization of the structure (Tabel 2). UV–vis and Fluorescence Spectrum The theoretical and experimental XRD patterns of 1 are generally the same, which conﬁrm its purity (Fig. 6). The UV–vis and ﬂuorescence spectrum of 1 are given in Fig. 7. In UV–vis adsorption spectrum (Fig. 7a), a strong peak at 311 nm could be Fig. 3 The 1-D chain structure linked by bis-monodenate bridge of L2 830 H.-J. Dong et al. 123 observed, around which a shoulder peak at 255 nm appears. Both of these adsorptions could be attributed to the p–p* and n ? p* transfer of BPDC2- ligand. The photoluminescence spectrum was measured in the solid state at room temperature (Fig. 7b). On excitation at 380 nm, the intense photoluminescence emissions for 1 are observed at 445, 459, and 531 nm. These emissions can be explained as follows: p–p* transfer of BPDC2- ligand occur ﬁrstly, and then the transfer from S0 to S1 singlet states can take place, afterwards it translates into triplet state T1 exceeding the band gap, this transfer acts as a excited state to excite the electron transition of trivalent gadolinium ion, and ﬁnally, these three characteristic luminescence can be detected when the electrons transfer from excited states to ground states [19, 20]. Electronic Structure Electronic structure calculation was based on density function theory (DFT) [21, 22]. In the calculation, wave functions were explained in a plane wave basis set, and the spin polarized version of the PW-91 GGA was employed for the exchange- corelation functional with DMOL code [22]. The calculated band structure of 1 at the Brillouin zone is shown in Fig. 8, in which the valence bands are ﬂat and Fermi energy level penetrates these bands, giving a conductor nature. The bands lying deeply in valence band (-24.0 to -5.0 eV) are contributed from the Gd-5p, O-2p and C, N-2s, 2p states. Importantly, the valence bands between -5.0 eV and Fermi level (0.0 eV) are formed by Gd-4f as well as the mixture of small number of O-2p and N-2p. The highest level at the valence bands are almost the contribution Fig. 4 The 2-D layer constructed from by monodenate bridge of L3 A New Rare-Earth Metal Coordination Polymer 831 123 10 20 30 40 50 Experimental value Theoretical simulation 2theta (°) Intensity (a.u.)

And the highest valence bands are composed by N-2p states hybridized with small C-2p. Accordingly, UV adsorption peaks of 1 could be found at 255 nm (4.86 eV) and 311 nm (3.98 eV), which is assigned as the charge transfers of C-2 s/N-2p bonding orbitals to antibonding ones and in agreement with the experimental attribution. Conclusions In conclusion, a new rare-earth metal coordination polymer {[Gd2(BPDC)3(H2O)3] H2O}n. has been synthesized, which was constructed from N-hetero aromatic multicarboxylate liagnd.
