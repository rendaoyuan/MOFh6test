Every Pb(II) centre demonstrate trigonal dodecahedron geometry. The ligand i.e. pyridine-3-carboxylate offers l3 -g2: g1 coordination pattern using its hetero donor centres. The complex initially forms an inﬁnite 1D chain (c-axis) which is turned to 2D sheet and ﬁnally a 3D network is recognized through ligand connec- tivity. Stabilization of 3D structure is further reinforced by p–p stacking interaction. An open channel is identiﬁed along c-axis. TG analysis has been performed for the complex. Emission study demonstrates the existence of intraligand and metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition in 1.

Large number of MOFs has been synthesized with d- and f-metals and various properties have been investi- gated thoroughly [7–15]. On the other side less interest has been made to the creation of heavy p-block Pb(II) coor- dination polymers [16–19]. Especially, report on lead coordination polymers with higher dimensionality is really few in number [20–25]. The lone pair electrons of Pb(II) is responsible for the nonspherical charge distribution around the cation. Therefore, disposition of ligands surrounding the metal centre causes an identiﬁable void [26]. This gap in coordination sphere has been considered as evidence of a ‘‘stereo chemically active lone pair of electrons’’ that probably takes up more space on a speciﬁc region of the surface of the coordination sphere than does a single bond [27, 28]. However, the lone pair electrons in Pb(II) com- plexes not only causes voids in the coordination geometry, but also can construct different geometrical forms [29]. Lead(II) center offers a large variety of coordination numbers (two to ten) due to the presence of its 6s electron pair with considerably large ionic radius. This ﬂexibility in coordination number inﬂuences the construction of two discrete structural categories named as hemidirected (bond to ligand donor centers are directed to one part of the cir- cling globe) and holodirected (bonds to the ligand donor centers are directed throughout the surrounding globe) coordination (Scheme 1) [30]. Such ligand disposition is probably the key issue for the generation of highly linked Pb(II) coordination polymers [20, 31–34]. Therefore, it is really noteworthy to synthesize and study the highly linked coordination polymers of Pb(II) for its further exploration of potential. Multidentate N- and O-donor ligands are very interest- ing as they are capable of building high dimensional coordination polymers due to their simple binding modes and strong coordination ability. Moreover, integration of neutral and anionic donor groups in a single ligand can not A. Rana  M. Bera  D. S. Chowdhuri  D. Hazari  S.

In this paper we have used Hpyc where the angle of around 120 between the two potential donor sets (N/O) (Scheme 2) can pledge to generate fascinating networks. However, some complexes with this ligand are reported [35–39]. In this paper we report the hydrothermal synthesis and characterization of Pb(II) coordination polymer with pyri- dine-3-carboxylic acid having hetero donor sites. Single crystal X-ray structural analysis illustrates the construc- tion of three dimensional geometry with octacoordinated Pb(II) centers. Thermal and luminescence study have been performed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Instrumentation Lead acetate trihydrate was purchased from Merck. Pyri- dine-3-carboxylic acid was purchased from SIGMA- ALDRICH Inc. IR spectrum for 1 was recorded in a JASCO FT/IR-6200 applying ATR technique in the range 4000–400 cm-1. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were car- ried out on a 240C Elemental analyzer. X ray powder diffraction data were recorded on a BRUKER AXS D8 advance instrument using Cu-Ka radiation. Thermogavi- metric analysis (TGA) was done under nitrogen ﬂow (ﬂow rate of 20 mL min-1 with TA (SDT Q60) analyzer. The ﬂuorescence study has been performed in the solid state at room temperature on a FluoroMax 4P spectroﬂuorimeter. 2.2 Synthesis Pb(CH3COO)23H2O (189.6 mg, 0.5 mmol) and Hpyc (123.1 mg, 1 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL water. Tri- ethyl amine (0.14 mL, 1 mmol) was added to the solution. The transparent solution was poured into a 25 mL Teﬂon lined bomb. The bomb was heated at 140 C for 48 h. After cooling the solution to room temperature colorless needle- shaped crystals were isolated by ﬁltering the supernatant liquid and washed with deionized water, ethanol and dried in air.

Data were processed using the CrysAlis-CCD programs [40]. The structure was deter- mined by direct methods procedures in SHELXS [41] and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares methods, on F2’s, in SHELXL [42]. The crystallographic data and the reﬁnement results are listed in Table 1. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Crystal Structure Description of [Pb0.5(pyc)]n, 1 Complex 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pccn. The asymmetric unit contains half lead(II) centre (Pb1) (that means Pb is at a special position, it is 0.25, 0.75, 0) and one deprotonated pyc- ligand moiety. The view of the local coordination geometry around the Pb(II) atom is depicted in Fig. 1. The lead cation is surrounded by N2O6 donor set in trigonal dodecahedron environment showing holodirected geometry and is deﬁned by six carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O10, O100, O1000 and O20) from four different pyc- ligands. The Pb–O distances of 2.390(4)– 2.869(4) A˚ are within the range reported in the literature [43–45]. The remaining two coordination positions are fulﬁlled by N-atoms of the pyridine ring of the ligand with Pb–N distance 2.676(4) A˚ , which is acceptable [32]. The bond lengths and bond angles of 1 are listed in Table 2. The pyc- ligand displays l3 -g2: g1 coordination mode via O (carboxylate) and N (pyridine) atoms towards three Pb centres (one chelating, two unidentate). Two Pb1 cen- ters are connected by two bridging carboxylate groups to form a bimetallic subunit with PbPb distance of 4.203(4) A˚ . Expansion of the bimetallic unit through c-axis forms an inﬁnite 1D chain (Fig. 2). 2D sheet formation takes place in the ab-plane when the chains along c-axis are connected by pyc- ligand (Fig. 2). The 2D layers are fur- ther joined together by pyridine-3-carboxylate groups via Fig. 1 a Coordination environment around Pb(II) centers in 1. b Trigonal dodecahedron geometry of Pb(II). c Holodirected geometry around lead centre J Inorg Organomet Polym (2011) 21:747–753 749 123 O and N donor centers to result in formation of the 3D framework (Fig. 3) with 1D open channels along c-axis (Fig. 4a). The smallest diameters of these channels are 3.54 A˚ . However, the observed porosity of the structure (Fig. 4b) can perhaps be explained by the fact that the channels are not uniform, and are signiﬁcantly more open in sections. Thus halfway between the narrow sections of the channels lay more open cavities with maximum diameters of 13.26 A˚ (and, given its nonspherical shape, larger maximum diameters). No signiﬁcant channels are observed in any other direction. The shortest PbPb interchain distance inside the channel is 8.920(2) A˚ . The aromatic parts of the ligands of two dimeric units are oriented in such conformation that p–p interaction is established between the pyridine rings (Fig. 5) which contributes to the stabilization of the overall structure. The centroid-to-centroid distance between the pyridine rings is 3.712 A˚ (offset distance is 1.39 A˚ ).

It is clearly seen that the peak positions in the experimental PXRD pattern are in good agreement with the correspondingly simulated ones except the slight differences in intensity, which may be due to the preferred orientation of the powder samples. The accordance indicates the excellent purity of the coordina- tion polymer. 3.3 Luminescence Study The solid state photo luminescent spectrum of 1 at room temperature is represented in Fig. 6b. Complex 1 exhibits an intense emission maximum at 343 nm and a shoulder peak at 403 nm in the blue region upon excitation with wave length of 300 nm. In order to understand the emission behavior, it is compared with the emission spectrum of the Hpyc ligand. The free ligand exhibits a broad emission band with maxima at 390 nm [46, 47]. The blue shifted emission band of 1 at 343 nm with respect to Hpyc can be assigned as the metal perturbed p–p* intraligand electronic transitions within the aromatic part of the ligand [48]. This is because of the fact that the Pb(II) coordination to the ligand results in a decrease in the nonradiative decay of intraligand excited states. As the nonradiative decay of intraligand excited state decreases the probability of emission occurring from the higher excited states to ground state increases. Therefore the emission wave length is shifted to blue region. The red shifted band is due to metal- to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition with electrons being transferred from Pb2? lone pair to the unoccupied p* orbitals of Hpyc [49]. 3.4 Thermal Study Thermo gravimetric analysis of 1 was carried in the tem- perature range of 30–1000 C under ﬂowing N2 atmo- sphere at a heating rate of 10 C min-1. The TGA curve is given in Fig. 6c. It is quite clear from the curve that the compound is stable up to 200 C. On further heating the Fig. 4 a Formation of 1D channel (c-axis). b A view of the 1D channel emphasizing the nonspherical nature of the channel Fig. 5 p–p interaction between the aromatic parts of the pyridine-3-carboxylate ligand between the dimeric units J Inorg Organomet Polym (2011) 21:747–753 751 123 pyc- ligand is decomposed in the temperature range of 200–240 C with weight loss of 53.7% (Calculated: 54.09%). 4 Conclusion In this work, combination of lead(II) ion with pyridine- 3-carboxylate anion leads to a 3-dimensional coordination polymeric network. The X-ray structural analysis shows octacoordinated environment around Pb(II) center displaying a holodirected geometry. It is interesting to observe l3 -g2: g1 coordination mode of the ligand in the network forming 1D channel. The p–p interaction between the pyridine rings of the ligand that connects the bimetallic unit adds extra sta- bilization to the overall structure. The emission bands orig- inate from intraligand CT and MLCT transition. The results of this study demonstrate that the existence of hetero donor centers in the ligand system can be applied to synthesize interesting polymeric architectures of higher dimensionality. It is anticipated that more metal complexes containing hetero donor ligands with various interesting structural types as well as physical properties will be synthesized. 5 Supplementary Materials Crystallographic data for the structural analysis have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Cen- ter, CCDC.
