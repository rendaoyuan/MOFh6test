Both complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, UV–Vis, 1H NMR, 13C{1H}NMR, and luminescence spectroscopy and their structures were studied by single-crystal X-ray crystallog- raphy. The thermal stabilities of the title complexes were studied by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses. Complex 1 is a discrete and complex 2 is a polymer; both structures are without precedent in the literature.

Its electron-donating thiol and methyl groups can obviously enhance the conjugation degree of the ﬁve membered aromatic heterocycle [1]. The reaction of the Hmptrz ligand with metal salts is expected to isolate different sorts of coordination polymers under variable synthetic conditions such as [Cu(l4-mptrz)]n, [Cu(l-Hmptrz)(l-I)]n, [Cu12(l4-mptrz)4(l4-I)3(l3-I)4(l-I)]n), and [Cu(l-Hmptrz)(l-DmptrzSS)I]n (DmptrzSS = 4,40- dimethyl-3,30-dithiodi-1,2,4-triazole) [1], [Cd(mptrz)2]n, [Cd(mptrz)X]n (X = I and Br), [Cd(mptrz)(l-X)]n (X = Cl and Br) and [Cd3(l3-OH)2(mptrz)4]n [2], [Ag2(mpt- rz)(l3-X)]n (X = I and Br) and [Pb4(l4-O)(mptrz)4(l-X)2] (X = I and Cl) [3] and [Me3Sn(mptrz)]n and [Ph3Sn(mpt- rz)]n [4], which have been synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. We report herein the synthesis, characterization and crystal structure of complexes [Pb(Hmptrz)4(NO3)2] (1) and [Pb(l-mptrz) 2(H2O)]n (2). It is notable that complex 1 is the ﬁrst discrete complex containing the Hmptrz ligand. On the other hand, two-dimensional polymeric complexes of Pb(II) containing Hmptrz ligand have been previously reported, but here, complex 2 is the ﬁrst example of a one- dimensional coordination polymer of Pb(II) and Hmptrz ligand [3]. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Physical Methods All chemicals were purchased from Merck and Aldrich. Infrared spectra (4,000–250 cm-1) of solid samples were taken as 1 % dispersion in CsI pellets using a Shimadzu- 470 spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC-300 spectrometer for protons at 300.13 MHz and for 13C{1H} NMR at 75.45 MHz in DMSO-d6. Melt- ing points were obtained on a Koﬂer Heizbank Rechart type 7841 melting point apparatus. Elemental analysis was D. M. S. Paqhaleh  A. A.

The structures of 1 and 2 were solved by SHELX-97 and absorption corrections were done using the SADABS programs [5, 6]. Softwares including Bruker APEX II (data collection and cell reﬁnement) [7], Bruker SHELXTL (data reduction) [8], and WinGX (publication material) [9] were properly used. The molecular graphics programs used, were ORTEP-3 for windows [10], PLA- TON and MERCURY [11]. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Synthesis of 1 and 2 Compound 1 was obtained from the reaction of one equivalent of Pb(NO3)2 with four equivalents of 4-methyl- 1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol in a mixture of CH3OH/H2O at 45 C after 20 min, isolated in 76.7 % yield. Compound 2 was synthesized with the same procedure with Pb(OAc)23H2O and the crude product was recrystallized in a DMSO/ methanol solution to obtain suitable crystals for X-ray studies in 75.4 % yield. The synthetic routes of these complexes are shown in Scheme 1. 3.2 Spectroscopic Characterization of 1 and 2 IR absorptions of 1 and 2 are listed in the experimental section. The vibrational bands present at 3,125 and 3,440 cm-1 are assigned to m(N–H) and m(O–H) for 1 and 2, respectively. The weak absorption bands present around 3,060 and 2,900 cm-1 are due to the C–H stretching of the triazole ring and methyl group, respectively. The explicit feature in the IR spectra of the two complexes 1 and 2 is the absence of the band in the region of 2,550–2,430 cm-1, which appears in the free ligand as the –SH stretching vibration, thus indicating metal–ligand bond formation through this site [4]. The bands observed in the range 1,530–1,200 cm-1 are assigned to C=N stretching vibra- tions and/or N–H deformation vibrations. The medium to strong vibrations in the region 1,170–600 cm-1 are assigned to the C=S stretching and deformation vibrations [1, 2, 12, 13]. The m(NO3) vibrations are found at 1,455 and 1,294 cm-1 for 1 [14, 15]. Far infrared spectra of 1 and 2 were recorded between 500 and 250 cm-1. The Pb–O stretching vibrations are found at 482 and 349 cm-1 for 1 and 511 cm-1 for 2. The Pb–S stretching vibrations are found at 307 and 290 cm-1 for 1 and 420 and 352 cm-1 for 2, and the Pb–N stretching vibration for 2 is found at 326 cm-1 [14–18].

The 1H NMR spectra of 1 and 2 exhibited a singlet around 2.5 ppm for the methyl group and a singlet around 8.3 ppm for the =C–H of triazole ring. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 also exhibited a singlet at 13.65 ppm for N– H. The signal at 13.65 ppm is absent in the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 and exhibited mptrz- ligand coordinated to Pb(II) cation from N and S atoms. In addition, the new signal at 3.52 in the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 is assigned to non coordinated H2O. It seems DMSO is coordinated from the opposite site of H2O in complex 2 and H2O is left. 1H NMR data showed that the signal of the –SH proton (1.63 ppm) in the spectrum of the ligand is absent in the spectra of 1 and 2, indicating the removal of the –SH proton and the formation of Pb–S bonds [4]. The 13C{1H}NMR spectra of 1 and 2 showed a singlet at around 31 ppm for CH3 groups and two singlets at 142–166 ppm for the triazole ring. The luminescence emission spectra of Hmptrz, 1 and 2 were obtained in DMSO at room temperature and the results are displayed in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1a (kex = 262 nm), Hmptrz exhibits a broad luminescent emission centered at 322 nm and 1 displays a broad luminescent emission at 324 nm. The luminescent emis- sion of complex 1 is weaker than that of the free Hmptrz ligand. As shown in Fig. 1b (kex = 266 nm), the maximum emission of Hmptrz appeared at 323 nm and complex 2 displays a luminescent emission broad band at 324 nm. This band in complex 2 is stronger than the band in the free Hmptrz ligand. The shapes of the luminescence emission spectra for Hmptrz, 1 and 2 are similar, so the emission properties of these compounds are believed to have origi- nated from p* ? p or p* ? n transitions in Hmptrz [19– 22]. 3.3 Thermal Studies of 1 and 2 The thermal stability of [Pb(Hmptrz)4(NO3)2] (1) and [Pb(l-mptrz)2(H2O)]n (2) have been determined on single- crystalline samples between 30 and 790 C in an air atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 C min-1 by ther- mogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analyses (DTA) (Fig. 2). For complex 1 (Fig. 2a), TGA shows that chemical decomposition starts at about 180 C and ends at 540 C with the weight loss of 70.15 % corresponds to the removing of two nitrate ions and four Hmptrz molecules (calcd.: 71.74 %). The remaining weight of 29.16 % is corresponded to the PbO (calcd. 28.19 %). The DTA curve of 1 displays three distinct endothermic peaks at 222, 278 and 435 C and six distinct exothermic peaks at 201, 247, 299, 451, 488 and 503 C.

The ﬁrst step between 165 and 200 C with a mass loss of 3.82 % cor- responds to the loss of one coordinated water molecule (calcd. 3.97 %). In the last two steps between 290 and 590 C the two mptrz- ligands are lost and the framework decomposes (45.22 %, calcd.: 46.78 %). The ﬁnal residual weight is 50.96 % corresponding to PbO (calcd. 49.25 %). The DTA curve of 2 displays ﬁve distinct endothermic peaks at 141, 177, 280, 329 and 467 C and four distinct exothermic peaks at 316, 519, 551 and 585 C. 3.4 Description of the Molecular Structure of 1 and 2 Crystallographic data for 1 and 2 are given in Table 1 and selected bond lengths and angles are presented in Table 2. The crystal structure of 1 is given in Fig. 3. The asym- metric unit of 1 contains one Pb(II) atom, one Hmptrz ligand and one nitrate anion. Each Pb(II) center is eight- coordinated by four O atoms from two nitrate anions and four S atoms from four Hmptrz ligands. The Pb–O dis- tances is 2.720(5) A˚ , and the Pb–S distances is 3.0191(16) A˚ (Table 2). The bond distances of Pb–O and Pb–S are in the normal, and are comparable with the values in related lead(II) complexes [3, 23, 24]. In the crystal structure of 1, Fig. 4a, b, pp interaction between the triazole rings, Cg1Cg1i [distance = 3.701(3) A˚ , symmetry code: (i) 2 - x, -y, z, where Cg1 is centroids of the ring (N1/N2/C2/N3/C1)], intermolecular C–HO and N–HN hydrogen bonds (Table 3) and short OO inter- action [O1O1i = 3.015(8) A˚ (i = x, y, z-1)] are effective in the stabilization of the crystal structure and formation of the 3-D supramolecular assembly. The ORTEP view with the numbering scheme for complex 2 is shown in Fig. 5. Complex 2 is a one- dimensional polymeric chain structure. The asymmetry unit of 2 contains one Pb(II) atom, one mptrz- anion and one water molecule. Each Pb(II) center is seven-coordi- nated by four l3-S atoms from four mptrz- anions, two N atoms from two mptrz- anions and one O atom from one water molecule. The mptrz- ligand exhibits a bidentate bridging coordination mode through its one monodentate nitrogen atom and the l3-S atom. The Pb–O, Pb–N and Pb– S bond distances are 2.570(11), 2.635(9) and 3.024(5) A˚ , respectively (Table 2). The bond dimensions involving lead are normal, and are comparable with the values in related lead(II) complexes [23, 25, 26]. As depicted in Fig. 5, the Pb ions are linked by the l-mptrz- ligands to produce a one-dimensional chain alone the b axis. Two mptrz- ligands link two neighboring lead atoms to form a 4-membered [Pb2S2] ring. The Pb1Pb1 interatomic sep- aration in the polymeric units of 2 is 4.647 A˚ , which is quite longer than the upper limit for Pb–Pb bonds in di- plumbene dimers (3.527 A˚ ) [27, 28].

Both complexes were fully characterized. Complex 1 is the ﬁrst discrete complex containing the Hmptrz ligand and com- plex 2 is the ﬁrst example of a one-dimensional coordi- nation polymer of Pb(II) and Hmptrz ligand. 5 Supplementary material CCDC Nos. 928566 and 928567 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for 1 and 3, respectively.
