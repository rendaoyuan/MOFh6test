Manuscript Coordinative versatility of 3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole in the construction of monomeric copper(II) and polymeric copper(I) complexes Sheng Hu1 • DianRong Lin1 • ZhenMing Xie1 • ChangXia Zhou1 • WenXi He1 • FangYong Yu2 Received: 19 April 2015 / Accepted: 1 June 2015 / Published online: 30 June 2015  Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015 Abstract Three complexes, namely [Cu(dpt)2(H2O)4] 2H2O (1), [Cu3I2(dpt)]n (2) and [Cu6Br3(dpt)3]n (3), have been obtained from the reactions of different copper salts with 1H-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (Hdpt). Complex 1 is mononuclear such that the CuII atom exhibits an octahedral coordination geometry involving monodentate dpt ligands, being synthesized from CuII nitrate and Hdpt at ambient temperature, while the cuprous halide cluster- based coordination polymers 2 and 3 were prepared by solvothermal reactions of CuI or CuBr with Hdpt. Complex 2 consists of [Cu3I2]n chains, which are further connected by the l4-dpt bridges to form a 4,6-connected three-di- mensional coordination polymer. Complex 3 is a 3,3,9- connected net based on [Cu6Br3] building blocks, linked by l3-dpt bridges. The photoluminescence properties of complex 2 in the solid state at ambient temperature have been investigated. Introduction Recently, the ﬁeld of crystal engineering of cluster-based coordination polymers has undergone rapid expansion, due to their structural and topological diversity as well as their potential applications in functional materials [1, 2]. The crystal engineering approach helps to theoretically predict the topology and geometries so as to control the assembly of various frameworks [3, 4]. The utilization of polynuclear clusters as building blocks for organizing the topology of complex networks is now widely used in crystal engi- neering, owing to the fact that their large coordination spheres may serve as templates and can readily accom- modate the steric demands of organic linkers [5, 6]. Fur- thermore, coordination polymers constructed from polynuclear clusters should be more stable and tend to exhibit multinary nets in consideration of the connectivity of different ligands [7]. The synthesis of these coordination polymers is highly inﬂuenced by a few factors such as the coordination preferences of the metal, the structural char- acteristics of the organic ligand, the metal–ligand ratio, the solvent and the reaction conditions [8–10]. Polynuclear cuprous halide complexes are of interest due to their rich luminescence properties and diverse connectivities [11]. The reactions of various donors such as phosphanes, anilines, pyridyl-type ligands and thioethers with cuprous halides afford numerous polynuclear com- plexes which display various structural motifs [12]. We have recently been investigating the assembly of struc- turally novel cuprous halide cluster-based coordination polymers, in which one-dimensional (CuX)n chains, Cu2X2 dimers, cubane Cu4X4 tetramers, Cu6X6 hexagonal cages, Cu8X8 and Cu10X10 clusters [13–17] have been success- fully introduced as secondary building units.

Using this strategy, we have recently obtained an acs topological framework featuring an undecanuclear cuprous halide cluster whose solid-state luminescence spectrum displays a strong red emission band at room temperature [18]. As a part of our ongoing research to understand the formation of cuprous halide cluster-based coordination polymers, we chose 1H-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (Hdpt) as a multifunctional ligand with multiple coordi- nation sites favorable for building structures of higher dimensions. The dpt ligand, which generated deprotonation of Hdpt during synthesis of the complex, can act as a multidentate bridge with coordination numbers from two to ﬁve. Meanwhile, the rotational possibilities provided by two peripheral pyridyl rings and their linkage to the triazole skeleton are expected to offer ﬂexible link modes and occupy much more space in a self-assembly process, allowing small terminal or bridging ligands to be coordi- nated to the metal centers [19–22]. In this research, a dis- crete mononuclear complex [Cu(dpt)2(H2O)4]2H2O (1), plus two three-dimensional coordination polymers [Cu3- I2(dpt)]n (2) and [Cu6Br3(dpt)3]n (3) with different cluster- based building blocks were obtained as their single crystals under different reaction conditions. The details of the structures show that strongly coordinating halogen anions and the variable coordination modes of the dpt ligand are the key factors affecting the structural diversity of the complexes. It should be noted that 3 has been reported previously as a product of solvothermal in situ ligand reactions. However, we found that it can be synthesized using direct methods with existing Hdpt ligand, which gives useful information for understanding coordination self-assembly. Experimental 1H-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole and other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and were used without further puriﬁcation. The C, H and N microanalyses were obtained with an Elementar Vario-EL CHNS ele- mental analyzer. The FT-IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the range 4000–400 cm-1 on a Bio-Rad FTS-7 spectrometer. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) intensities for complexes 2 and 3 were measured at 293 K on a Rigaku D/max-IIIA diffratometer (Cu–Ka, k = 1.54056 A˚ ). Powder samples were prepared by crushing the crystals and scanned from 3 to 60 with a step of 0.1/s. Calculated diffraction patterns of 2 and 3 were generated with the Mercury program, available free of charge via the Internet at http://www.iucr.org. Emission/ excitation spectra were measured on a FluoroMax-4 VPF- 100 ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer (HORIBA Jobin– Yvon). Synthesis of complex 1 Cu(NO3)23H2O (0.061 g, 0.25 mmol) was added to a solution of Hdpt (0.112 g, 0.5 mmol) in a mixture of ethanol (10 ml) plus water (10 ml) with stirring. The pH of the reaction solution was increased to 9.0 using aqueous NaOH. The resulting solution was ﬁltered and kept at room temperature for crystallization. After 2 weeks, light green crystals of complex 1 [Cu(dpt)2(H2O)4]2H2O suitable for X-ray crystallographic study were obtained in a yield of 0.049 g, 32 % (based on Cu).

The mixture was heated for 3 days at 150 C and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 C/h. After cooling to room temperature, red block-like crystals of [Cu3I2(dpt)]n, complex 2, were obtained in a yield of 0.267 g, 80 % (based on Hdpt).

Results and discussion Structural description of complex 1 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that the neutral compound 1 crystallizes as discrete mononuclear molecules. The asymmetric unit contains one half of the formula unit and consists of one crystallographically unique CuII atom, one dpt ligand, two coordinated water ligands and one lattice water molecule. Cu1 lies in a special position (SOF = 0.5), being overall six coordi- nated by four water ligands in the equatorial plane, plus two dpt ligands in axial positions (Fig. 1). The coordi- nation geometry of the metal center can be described as a slightly distorted octahedron with Cu–O and Cu–N dis- tances of 1.989–2.432 and 2.011 A˚ , respectively. Inter- estingly, instead of acting as a multidentate bridge, the dpt ligand exhibits a monodentate coordination mode. A terminal pyridyl N atom (N4) of dpt is coordinated to Cu, while the other four N atoms in the triazole skeleton and the peripheral pyridyl ring are uncoordinated. All the uncoordinated triazole and pyridyl N atoms serve as hydrogen bond receptors for the coordinated or guest water molecules [ON = 2.759–3.262 A˚ , O–HN = 134–176]. Structural description of complex 2 To induce core aggregation and obtain cluster-based coordination polymers, we chose cuprous halides as pre- cursors.

Red block-like crystals of 2 were synthesized as a single phase by solvothermal reaction of cuprous iodide and Hdpt in acetonitrile at 150 C. X-ray structural analysis of compound 2 shows that it is built from one-dimensional [Cu3I2]n chains. The asymmetric unit contains three crystallographically unique CuI atoms, two unique I– ligands and one dpt ligand. The rule of charge balance indicates that the valency of Cu is ?1. Cu1 is tetrahedrally coordinated by two l3-I– atoms, one tria- zole N atom and one pyridyl N atom. Cu2 also shows a tetrahedral geometry and is ligated by two l3-I– atoms, one triazole N atom and one pyridyl N atom from a different dpt ligand. Cu3 adopts a triangular coordination geometry and is coordinated by two l3-I– ligands and one triazole N atom from a dpt ligand (Fig. 2a). All CuI atoms in the [Cu3I2]n chain are coordinated to two l3-I– ligands, and all l3-I– bridge to three copper atoms giving Cu–I distances varies from 2.513(1) to 2.941(1) A˚ . The Cu–N distance is varying from 1.971(5) to 2.036(5) A˚ . The geometries of these types of Cu atoms are familiar, with I–Cu–I angles ranging from 99.14(3) to 113.82(3), N–Cu–I angles ranging from 88.11(15) to 138.79(15) and N–Cu–N angles ranging from 106.5(2) to 135.2(2). The [Cu3I2]n chain can be regarded as a ribbon that is formed by connecting adjacent [Cu3I] units via Cu–I bonds, as shown in Fig. 2b. In the [Cu3I2]n ribbon, the shortest CuCu distance (2.87 A˚ ) is slightly higher than the sum of the van der Waals radii (2.80 A˚ ). This [Cu3I2]n ribbon is further linked to two nearest neighbors by the triazole skeleton of a dpt ligand, resulting in a prototypical (4,4) topological sublayer (Fig. 2c). Virtually, each dpt ligand is coordinated to ﬁve Cu atoms or four [Cu3I] clusters via all the ﬁve N atoms of the ligand. From the topological point of view, the [Cu3I] cluster adopts an octahedral geometry considering the connectivity of two l3-I atoms and four dpt ligands, resulting in a three-di- mensional cluster-based coordination polymer (Fig. 3a). By considering just the [Cu3I] clusters and the tetradentate dpt ligands as distorted octahedral and square- planar nodes, respectively, complex 2 can be deﬁned as 4,6-connected topological net with distorted octahedral and square-planar nodes in the ratio 1:1, as shown schematically in Fig. 3b. The long topological (O’Keeffe) vertex symbol is 4.4.4.4.62.62 for the dpt node and 4.4.4.4.65.65.65.65.65.65.65.65 for the [Cu3I] node, thus giving a short vertex symbol (44.62) (44.610.8). We are aware that there are 32 possible 4,6-connected nets that are based on different binodal nodes. Only 12 have been found in inorganic compounds or metal–organic frameworks, and the cor, fsh, iac, iﬁnets are most frequently observed [25]. Moreover, the 4,6-connected net described herein also differs greatly from the ideal fsg net with square-planar and octahedral nodes in the ratio 1:1. It may be due to com- pound 2 containing very unusual and unexpected distorted octahedral and square-planar nodes, and only a few examples of coordination polymers with this topology have been reported so far [26–28]. Structural description of complex 3 Complex 3 was prepared to allow comparison with 2 by using CuBr in place of CuI. The structure of compound 3 is highly inﬂuenced by the coordination preferences of the Br- anions, and a hexacopper cluster-based three-dimen- sional network has been synthesized. In 3, each dpt ligand works as a l3-bridging ligand to link four different CuI atoms. The l1,2-N,N’ triazolate N atoms of dpt connect to two Cu atoms in the same [Cu6Br3] cluster (Fig. 4b), and each pyridyl N atom of dpt connects to one Cu atom. The hexanuclear [Cu6Br3] units are further extended to form a three-dimensional network via triazolate sites and the pyridyl ends of the l3-bridging dpt ligand (Fig. 4c). The three-dimensional framework of 3 is a 3-nodal 3,3,9-con- nected topological net with the [Cu6Br3] cluster as 9-con- nected nodes and the two types of dpt ligands as triangular 3-connected nodes (Fig. 4d). Such a net structure can be characterized by the short vertex symbol (410.69.812.105)(42.6)2(43). It should be pointed out that the bromide complex 3 and the isomorphic chloride have been reported by Lu [29] and Chen [30], in which the dpt ligand was obtained through in situ ring transformation or oxidative addition reactions from different precursors. However, we found signiﬁcant changes of the crystal structures on going from 2 to 3, originated by the self-assembly with the anionic iodide and Fig. 1 Perspective view of the molecular structure of 1 626 Transition Met Chem (2015) 40:623–629 123 bromide ligands using direct methods with the existing Hdpt ligand. These observations imply that the iodine anions can serve as different templates to guide the for- mation of different coordination polymers. It is clear that we cannot simply trust to luck in hydrothermal or solvothermal in situ ligand reactions. Judging from the above corresponding coordination polymers, although simultaneous competition and cooperation between coor- dination self-assembly and in situ ligand formation reac- tions may exist, we believe that the tendency is that the ligands are generated ﬁrst. Photoluminescence properties The photoluminescence properties of complex 2 have been studied in the solid state. The emission spectrum of the free Hdpt ligand was also studied to ensure that the observed emission of complex 2 did not arise from the ligand itself. The excitation and emission maxima (kmax ex and kmax em ) of complex 2 and the free Hdpt ligand at room temperature are depicted in Fig. 5. An intense band in the emission spectrum was observed at 502 nm (kex = 326 nm) for the free Hdpt ligand. Upon excitation at 348 nm, complex 2 in the solid state exhibits strong photoluminescence at room temperature with an emission maximum at ca. 592 nm. Hence, the emission peak of 2 is red-shifted by 90 nm relative to that of the free Hdpt ligand. According to the literature, the emission peak for complex 2 may be tenta- tively assigned to halide-to-ligand charge transfer (XLCT) Fig. 2 a The coordination environment of CuI atoms in 2.

Conclusion In conclusion, we have synthesized and characterized three coordination compounds based on different copper salts and the 3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole ligand. For complex 1, the octahedral CuII ion tended to form a discrete mononuclear complex. Complexes 2 and 3 were prepared by using CuI or CuBr with Hdpt under similar solvothermal conditions, but the ﬁnal products are quite different. Their different stoichiometries and structures suggest that the different copper salts and the changeable coordination modes of the dpt ligand are important factors in the structure versatility. The introduction of strongly coordinating halogen anions is a critical factor for the core aggregation, as well as modiﬁcation of the topolog- ical connectivity and increasing dimensionality of the network. The results obtained here provide a hint for synthesizing new photoluminescent cluster-based coordi- nation polymers by using multifunctional nitrogen hete- rocyclic ligands, which is currently under way in our laboratory.
