Generally, bpe shows the unidentate coordination mode and serves as the terminal pendant, whereas the dicarboxylate ligands display various binding fashions to interlink the metal centers to form 1-D comb-like chain, ribbon, and fishbone arrays, as well as 2-D 44 and 4.82 layered networks. Notably, the bpe building block is also involved in secondary interactions such as hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking to construct the resulting supramolecular architectures. Thermal stability of these complexes has been studied by TG-DTA technique. crystal engineering, coordination supramolecular framework, Cd(Ⅱ) complex, secondary interaction, thermal stability 1 Introduction Interests in the assembly of metal-organic supramolecu- lar frameworks have been rapidly expanded due to their intriguing architectures and potential applications in the aspects of catalysis, adsorption/separation, ion exchange, host-guest chemistry, as well as promising photo-, electro-, and magneto-functional materials[1―27]. Gener- ally, it has been realized that the structural features of such net-based solids significantly rely upon the delicate selection of metal centers and organic tectons[28―30]. Accordingly, pyridyl and/or carboxylate containing ligands have been mostly used in preparing such crystal- line materials due to their reliable capability of metal binding for the construction of diverse coordination assemblies[31]. In this context, as an analogue of 2,4-bipyridyl, trans- 1-(2-pyridyl)-2-(4-pyridyl)ethylene (bpe) has been con- firmed as a potential bifunctional building block that can be readily involved in coordinative and other secondary interactions due to the different structural-directed func- tions of the 2- and 4-pyridyl groups[32,33]. As a continua- tion of our efforts on this interesting topic, we will report here a series of Cd Ⅱ supramolecular complexes with bpe and various dicarboxyl ligands, including the rigid 5-nitroisophthalic acid (H2nip), 5-sulfoisophthalic acid (H3sip), and 2-bromoterephthalic acid (H2bta), as well as the flexible pamoic acid (H2pa) and sebacic acid (H2seb). The results clearly reveal that the coordination motifs of these complexes are dominated by the dicar- boxyl bridging ligands with different substituent, func- tional-group orientation, and backbone flexibility. More- over, structural diversity of the resulting crystalline architectures is also modulated by multiple supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking.

Elemental analyses of C, H, and N were taken on a CE-440 (Leemanlabs) analyzer. Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra (KBr pellets) were carried out on an AVATAR-370 (Nicolet) spectrometer. Thermogra- vimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) experiments were performed on a simultaneous TG-DTA system (Rigaku) under N2 atmosphere in the temperature range of 25―700℃ at a heating rate of 10℃/min. An empty Al2O3 crucible was used as the reference. 2.2 Synthesis of {[Cd(nip)(bpe)(H2O)2](CH3CN)·- (H2O)2}n (1) To a hot CH3CN (10 mL) solution of H2nip (21.1 mg, 0.1 mmol) was added a DMF (5 mL) solution of bpe (18.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) with stirring for ca. 10 min. Then, a H2O (5 mL) solution of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (30.8 mg, 0.1 mmol) was added to the above mixture with con- tinuous stirring for ca. 30 min. The resulting solution was filtered and left to stand at room temperature. Pale- yellow block crystals of 1 suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by slow evaporation of the solvent after two days in 47% yield (28.1 mg). Anal.

There was no evidence of crystal decay during data collection. In each case, a semi-empirical absorp- tion correction was applied (SADABS) and the program SAINT was used for integration of the diffraction pro- files[34]. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS and refined with SHELXL[35]. The final refinement was performed by full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-H atoms. Generally, C-bound H atoms were located geometrically and refined as riding, while N- (for 2) and O-bound (for 1―5) H atoms were first located in difference Fourier syntheses and then fixed at the calculated positions. Isotropic displacement parameters of the H atoms were derived from the parent atoms. Notably, 1472 LI ChengPeng et al. Sci China Ser B-Chem | Sep. 2009 | vol. 52 | no. 9 | 1470-1478 in the structure of complex 3, the lattice water molecule of O8 is disordered over two positions with the site oc- cupancy factors of 0.61(3) and 0.39(3), respectively, and the lattice water of O9 is assigned to quarter occupancy to achieve an appropriate thermal parameter. As a result, the affiliated H atoms were not determined. Furthermore, the bpe ligand in 3 and one bpe in 5 were treated by us- ing a disorder model with the central —CH=CH— groups adopting two different locations. Further crystallo- graphic data are shown in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. The details of hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking interactions are summarized in Table S1 and Table S2 (Supporting In- formation), respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structure of 1 The Cd Ⅱ ion in 1 is primarily hexa-coordinated by five oxygen atoms from two carboxylates of a pair of nip and two independent aqua molecules, as well as one nitrogen donor from the terminal bpe ligand (see Figure 1(a)). Thus, the coordination sphere of Cd1 can be considered as a distorted octahedron with the aqua donors occupy- ing the axial positions. The two carboxylate groups of nip show chelated and unidentate coordination modes, respectively. The distance of Cd1···O3A is 0.2727(3) nm, revealing a weaker contact. The adjacent Cd Ⅱ centers are linked by the nip bridges (Cd···Cd = 1.0148(2) nm) to afford a 1-D comb-like chain array running along the [100] direction. This 1-D motif is decorated with bpe in the same side by an approximately perpendicular mode, and two adjacent such 1-D chains are combined by in- terchain H-bonds of O8–H8A⋅⋅⋅O1 and O8–H8B⋅⋅⋅O4 to allow the generation of a double stranded pattern (see Figure 1(b)). Moreover, such 1-D double-chain arrays are further linked by O7–H7A⋅⋅⋅N2 bonds to form a 2-D supramolecular layer (see Figure 1(c)), which is con- solidated by aromatic stacking interactions among the adjacent pyridyl rings of bpe as well as the phenyl rings of nip. There also exist aromatic stacking contacts be- tween the pyridyl and phenyl groups from different 2-D layers. Additionally, the lattice solvents are attached to the 2-D networks by O9–H9A⋅⋅⋅O7 and O7–H7B⋅⋅⋅N4 interactions.

In this case, the coordination geometry of Cd Ⅱ is a distorted pen- tagonal-bipyramid, which is provided by four carboxy- late oxygen atoms from two sip anions plus one pyridyl nitrogen atom of bpe defining the equatorial plane, as well as two oxygen atoms from carboxylate and water occupying the axial positions (see Figure 2(a)). Notably, in this structure, the 2-pyridyl group of bpe is in the protonated form. The two carboxylate groups of each sip adopt the bridging (μ-O,O- η-O,O’) and chelated coordina- tion fashions, connecting the Cd Ⅱions to form a 1-D poly- meric pattern along the [010] axis (see Figure 2(b)). The Cd⋅⋅⋅Cd distance in the dimeric subunit is 0.3652(1) nm. Figure 2 Views of 2. (a) A portion view showing the coordination envi- ronment of Cd Ⅱ; (b) 1-D polymeric ribbon; (c) 3-D H-bonding su- pramolecular network (the bpe ligands are omitted for clarity). A side view from [001] clearly shows that the uni- dentate Hbpe ligands are located at both sides of each 1-D motif and hydrogen bonded to the adjacent ribbons (N2–H2’···O6). Moreover, such coordination arrays are extended to afford a 3-D supramolecular network (see Figure 2(c)) via interchain H-bonding between the water ligand and carboxylate (O8–H8A⋅⋅⋅O4), and also be- tween the lattice water and sulfonate (O10–H10A⋅⋅⋅O5 and O10–H10B ⋅⋅⋅O7). Additionally, the lattice water of O9 is H-bonded to this 3-D network (O9–H9A⋅⋅⋅O1, O9–H9B⋅⋅⋅O7, and O8–H8B⋅⋅⋅O9). 3.3 Crystal structure of 3 When H2BTA, a Br-substituent derivative of linear terephthalic acid, was used to assemble with Cd Ⅱ and bpe, a 2-D coordination polymer 3 was obtained. The Cd Ⅱ center here adopts a distorted octahedral sphere (CdNO5) completed by one bpe, three bta anions, and two aqua ligands (see Figure 3(a)). Interestingly, the aqua donor (O5) plays a bridging role, and the two carboxylates display distinct binding modes (syn-syn bridging and unidentate), interlinking the Cd Ⅱ ions to form an undu- lating coordination layer along the ab plane (see Figure 3(b)) that is stabilized by intralayer O5–H5⋅⋅⋅O4 bonds. Such a 2-D net consists of dinuclear [Cd2(μ-COO)2(μ- H2O)] subunits (Cd⋅⋅⋅Cd = 0.3731(1) nm) as nodes to define a familiar 44 topology. The repeating unit has an inner dimension of 1.1771(1) × 1.1771(1) nm2. Further- more, such layers are decorated with the bpe terminals that are outward at both sides of each layer, which facilitate the formation of interlayer H-bonding (O6–H6A⋅⋅⋅N2) and aromatic stacking interactions to construct a 3-D supramolecular network (see Figure 3(c)) with the in- clusion of lattice water moieties. There also exist O6–H6B···O7 and O7–H7B···O4 bonds between the lattice water and aqua ligand/carboxylate. 3.4 Crystal structure of 4 In this polymeric structure, each Cd Ⅱ center is ligated by two unidentate carboxylates from pamoate, two pyridyl groups from bpe, and a pair of water ligands, adopting a distorted octahedral sphere (see Figure 4(a)). As a result, each pamoate anion bridges two Cd Ⅱ cen- ters with a long separation of 1.6083(1) nm, forming a 1-D fishbone-like motif due to the decorated bpe pen- dants (see Figure 4(b)). Such a 1-D array is different from those in 1 and 2, as well as in other known metal- LI ChengPeng et al. Sci China Ser B-Chem | Sep. 2009 | vol. 52 | no. 9 | 1470-1478 1475 Figure 3 Views of 3.

As ex- pected, each hydroxyl group in the pamoate anion is H-bonded to the adjacent carboxylate (O3–H3⋅⋅⋅O2 and O4–H4⋅⋅⋅O5) and the dihedral angle between the naph- thalene groups is 76.5°. Also, the 2-pyridyl groups of bpe act as the H-bonding acceptors to further connect such 1-D chains via O7–H7B···N4 and O8–H8A···N2 to afford an H-bonding layer (see Figure 4(c)), and interlayer aromatic stacking interactions are observed between the pyridyl groups of bpe. Moreover, there exist H-bonds of O7–H7A···O2 and O8–H8B···O9 between the aqua ligand and carboxylate/DMF solvent. Notably, this 3-D lattice contains small void space of 0.0948 nm3 (2.2% of Figure 4 Views of 4.

Each Cd Ⅱ ion in the asymmetric unit of 5 is six-coordinated by four oxy- gen donors of three carboxylate groups of seb and one aqua ligand, as well as two pyridyl nitrogen atoms of bpe (see Figure 5(a)). Different from that in 3, the two carboxylates of seb show syn-anti bridging and uniden- tate coordination fashions, respectively, linking the ad- jacent Cd Ⅱ ions to result in a 2-D brick-wall network (see Figure 5(b)). In this layered motif, extended helical chains with alternate helicity are found and the pitch of 1476 LI ChengPeng et al. Sci China Ser B-Chem | Sep. 2009 | vol. 52 | no. 9 | 1470-1478 Figure 5 Views of 5. (a) A portion view showing the coordination envi- ronment of Cd Ⅱ; (b) 2-D 4.82 coordination layer; (c) 3-D packing diagram. each helix is equal to the length of b axis. From the viewpoint of net topology, each Cd Ⅱ ion and seb anion act as the 3-connected nodes to afford a 4.82 network. Within the layer, O5–H5A···O2 and O5–H5B···O3 bonds are found. Further analysis of the crystal packing reveals that such layers are parallel, and there exist interlayer aromatic stacking between the prominent bpe pendants (see Figure 5(c)), which are unusually not involved in any hydrogen bonding. The above results clearly show that diverse coordina- tion frameworks may be obtained for such mixed-ligand systems based on the selection of dicarboxylate modules, which display a variety of binding modes with the CdII ion. By contrast, the bpe tecton uniformly behaves as the unidentate terminal ligand in all these complexes, which, however, is also involved in multiple secondary interac- tions such as hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking to critically determine the structural assembly of the result- ing supramolecular architectures. Notably, we have used different stoichiometric ratios of bpe/dicarboxyl/Cd Ⅱ in the experimental processes, aiming to obtain new coor- dination species (especially that involving bridging bpe). However, the results reveal that the crystalline products are independent to the ligand/metal ratio. 3.6 Thermal stability of 1―5 All complexes are air stable, and thus their thermal sta- bility was studied by TG-DTA technique (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). For 1, the first series of weight loss of 11.80% in the range of 143―325℃ indicates the removal of all lattice solvent molecules (calculated: 12.86%). After a short-lived stabilization, the residual framework started to decompose beyond 373℃ and ended at 498℃. Accordingly, one endothermic peak at 242℃ and two exothermic peaks at 411℃ and 487℃ were observed in the DTA curve. No weight loss was found upon further heating to 700℃. The TG curve of 2 shows the first weight loss of 6.46% (calculated: 6.07%) in 35―190℃ range, indicating the exclusion of two lattice water molecules (two endothermic peaks at 83 and 168℃ in DTA). The residual species was stable up to 382℃, upon which several consecutive weight loss occurred and ended at 644℃ (two exothermic peaks at 405 and 474℃ in DTA). No weight loss was found upon further heating to 700℃. In the TG curve of 3, the first weight loss of 7.46% (calculated: 6.69%) in the range of 51―138℃ suggests the expulsion of all lattice water molecules. Accordingly, one endothermic peak was observed at 85℃ in the DTA curve. The residual solid started to decompose upon 191℃ with several consecutive weight loss, which ended at 629℃ (three exothermic peaks at 403, 476, and 568℃ in DTA). No weight loss was found upon further heating to 700℃. In the TG curve of 4, no separate weight loss step of the lattice solvent was found and pyrolysis of the crystalline sample occurred at 120℃ with a series of weight loss, which did not end until it was heated to 700℃. Corre- spondingly, two endothermic and two exothermic peaks were observed at 119/389 and 455/486℃ in DTA. The LI ChengPeng et al. Sci China Ser B-Chem | Sep. 2009 | vol. 52 | no. 9 | 1470-1478 1477 polymeric framework of 5 kept intact until heated to 94℃, and then underwent a series of continuous weight loss that ended at 606℃ (one endothermic peak at 134℃ and three exothermic peaks at 304, 479, and 549℃ in the DTA curve). Upon further heating to 700℃, no weight loss was observed. 4 Conclusions A series of Cd Ⅱ coordination frameworks generated from mixed-ligand systems of different dicarboxyl tectons and bpe were presented in this work. In summary, the sub- stituent effect, functional-group disposition, and backbone flexibility of the dicarboxyl ligands do play a dominating role in the construction of these crystalline materials that display significant structural diversity. On the other hand, as a typical bifunctional building block, bpe shows a ver- satile nature to construct and tune up such extended su- pramolecular frameworks via interplay of the coordina- tion bonds and multiple supramolecular interactions. 1 Hoskins B F, Robson R.
