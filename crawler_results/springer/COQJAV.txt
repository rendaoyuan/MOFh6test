Manuscript Capturing snapshots of post-synthetic metallation chemistry in metal–organic frameworks Witold M. Bloch1, Alexandre Burgun1, Campbell J. Coghlan1, Richmond Lee2, Michelle L. Coote2, Christian J. Doonan1* and Christopher J. Sumby1* Post-synthetic metallation is employed strategically to imbue metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with enhanced performance characteristics. However, obtaining precise structural information for metal-centred reactions that take place within the pores of these materials has remained an elusive goal, because of issues with high symmetry in certain MOFs, lower initial crystallinity for some chemically robust MOFs, and the reduction in crystallinity that can result from carrying out post-synthetic reactions on parent crystals. Here, we report a new three-dimensional MOF possessing pore cavities that are lined with vacant di-pyrazole groups poised for post-synthetic metallation. These metallations occur quantitatively without appreciable loss of crystallinity, thereby enabling examination of the products by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. To illustrate the potential of this platform to garner fundamental insight into metal-catalysed reactions in porous solids we use single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies to structurally elucidate the reaction products of consecutive oxidative addition and methyl migration steps that occur within the pores of the Rh-metallated MOF, 1·[Rh(CO)2][Rh(CO)2Cl2]. S ingle-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) is a powerful and ubiquitous technique used to deﬁnitively elucidate molecular structure1,2. One of the fundamental requirements for obtain- ing a structure solution from a diffraction pattern is the presence of long-range order of electron density within the crystal. A conse- quence of this experimental constraint is that the precise obser- vation of guests within the cavities of porous solid-state materials is a signiﬁcant challenge due to partial site occupancy and disorder. Recent work by the Fujita group demonstrated that metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are suitable host matrices for isolating and unambiguously characterizing the structure and relative stereo- chemistry of ordered guest molecules on a nanogram scale3. This elegant work builds upon earlier efforts that utilize solid-state materials with deﬁned cavities to stabilize and crystallographically characterize reactive organic compounds4–8 and organometallic moieties9,10. In addition, the adsorption of gas molecules within MOFs has been analysed by SCXRD methods to yield detailed infor- mation on binding modes and preferred adsorption sites11–14. This body of preceding work clearly demonstrates that MOFs are a ver- satile platform for characterizing molecular guest species in the solid-state. Recently, Fujita’s ‘crystalline sponges’ have been used to elucidate the structure of a triﬂuoromethylthiolation reagent15 and to study the reactivity of a metallated guest cartridge16. However, crystallographi- cally monitoring inorganic transformations and reactions of metal complexes within a single MOF crystal remains a signiﬁcant challenge. The ﬁrst step towards examining inorganic chemistry within a MOF material is to determine a general strategy for the introduction of metal complexes into the pore framework with precise positional control. Post-synthetic metallation17,18, where a metal ion is inserted into a vacant coordinating site that is part of the framework structure, is an approach that has broad scope for incorporating a wide variety of metal complexes into MOFs. As this approach provides for the tether- ing of a metal complex in a deﬁned position within the pore frame- work, it has been successfully used to enhance gas separations19–21 and to facilitate the introduction of metal centres that catalyse reactions within the host framework22–24. Despite the wide application of post- synthetic metallation there are no examples where SCXRD has been used to unambiguously deﬁne the coordination sphere (not part of the MOF backbone) of the inserted metal. The difﬁculty in obtaining SCXRD information for post-synthetically metallated MOFs25,26 is often attributed to diminished crystal quality, either as a result of the additional post-synthetic step or lower initial crystallinity for some chemically robust MOFs, issues with unravelling disorder in MOFs with higher crystal symmetry, and the general difﬁculty in achieving full site occupancy of the extraneous metal ion within the chelating moiety17,18. N N HO O O OH N N Soft donor Hard donor Torsional flexibility LH2 Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a Mn(II)- based MOF, [Mn3(L)2(L′)] (1), where L and L′ are crystallographically unique forms of the deprotonated ligand bis(4-(4-carboxyphenyl)-1H- 3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)methane, LH2. In the L form the carboxylate and pyrazole donors coordinate the Mn atoms of the metal node, and in the L′ form only the carboxylate donors contribute to the coordination environment of the metal node, thus leaving the di-pyr- azole moieties vacant within the MOF. As a consequence, L′ provides a ﬂexible di-pyrazole chelating unit poised for post-synthetic metal binding. We show that this MOF can be quantitatively metallated (con- ﬁrmed by a range of techniques) with a variety of ﬁrst- and second-row transition-metal ions (Co(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Rh(I), Cd(II)) and, sub- sequent to this post-synthetic treatment, maintains the long-range 1School of Chemistry & Physics, Centre for Advanced Nanomaterials, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5005, Australia, 2Research School of Chemistry, Australian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory 0200, Australia. *e-mail: christian.doonan@adelaide.edu.au; christopher.sumby@adelaide.edu.au ARTICLES PUBLISHED ONLINE: 7 SEPTEMBER 2014 | DOI: 10.1038/NCHEM.2045 NATURE CHEMISTRY | VOL 6 | OCTOBER 2014 | www.nature.com/naturechemistry 906 © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The potential of 1 to act as an isolation matrix that facilitates the observation of inorganic reaction products in the solid state was realized by using SCXRD to follow a well-known inner-sphere chemical transformation (Oh to Td Co(II))27. Furthermore, we characterized the reaction product from the oxidative addition of CH3I to 1·[Rh(CO)2][RhCl2(CO)2] and sub- sequent CO insertion into the Rh–CH3 bond. The propensity of this MOF to be quantitatively metallated by a wide range of metal ions affords broad scope for studying coordinatively unusual species in the solid-state and has the potential to provide valuable structural insight into inorganic chemical reactivity and metal-based catalysis. Results and discussion Synthesis and characterization of 1. To facilitate the metallation process we anticipated that a MOF architecture that includes a ﬂexible chelating group would afford greater structural degrees of freedom and thus accommodate metal ions in a wide variety of geometries in the solid-state. Accordingly, this design feature28,29 was expected to give rise to higher site occupancies than a MOF constructed from rigid links. Bifunctional ligand LH2 (ref. 30) was selected as the organic building unit due to a degree of rotational freedom about the aryl–heteroaryl bonds and the intrinsic ﬂexibility provided by the central methylene bridge. Furthermore, the combination of ‘hard’ carboxylate and relatively ‘soft’ pyrazole donors could be expected, with judicious selection of reaction conditions and metal ions, to yield an open framework material replete with metal-free di-pyrazole donors. The title material, 1, was obtained by heating a 1.7:1 MnCl2/LH2 mixture in 6 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF)/H2O (2:1 vol. ratio) at 100 °C for 48 h. This yielded colourless, rhombic plates of 1·xS in 66% yield that crystallized in monoclinic space group P21/c. MOF 1 (Fig. 1a) is a charge-neutral three-dimensional network that can be readily envisaged as two-dimensional layers composed of trinuclear Mn3(II)(L)2 nodes that are ‘pillared’ by the L′ form of the ligand. Close structural analysis of 1 indicates that the Mn3 node comprises a central octahedral Mn(II) atom coordinated by six carboxylate oxygen atoms and ﬂanked by two distorted octahedral Mn(II) centres, each of which are coordinated by four oxygen donors and capped by a chelating di-pyrazole moiety (Fig. 1b). L′ bridges the two-dimensional layers through the carboxylate donors, giving rise to channels measuring ∼8.5 × 10.5 Å (excluding van der Waals radii) along the c axis that are lined with vacant di-pyrazole coordinating sites poised for post-synthetic metallation (Fig. 1b,c). The vacancy of the pyrazole moieties can be rationalized by the donor requirements for a charge-balanced Mn3 node (Mn3O12N4); three molecules of L provide 12 oxygen and 6 nitrogen atoms, leaving 2 non-coordinated nitrogen donors. MOF 1 possesses exceptional structural ﬂexibility (Fig. 2), as evi- denced by gas adsorption and X-ray diffraction experiments. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected on both the DMF exchanged (1·DMF) and desolvated samples (1-des) of 1. Analysis of the peak positions and intensities indicated that 1 had undergone a structural transformation upon desolvation (Supplementary Fig. 14). Notably, single crystals from the desol- vated sample were suitable for structure determination by SCXRD. X-ray analysis revealed that the trinuclear Mn(II) node remained essentially unchanged; however, the pillaring ligand had undergone a signiﬁcant torsional rotation, resulting in a noticeably more acute bridging angle (97.5° compared to 105.1°) and thus a contraction of the two-dimensional planes (Fig. 2a). This structural contraction can be attributed to the inherent ﬂexibility and rotational freedom of the non-coordinated L′ ligand within the MOF structure. The 77 K N2 gas adsorption isotherm experiments (Fig. 3) performed on 1-des afforded an isotherm proﬁle with a step between P/Po of 0.005–0.06 (P and Po are the measured and satur- ation pressure of nitrogen, respectively). This is consistent with a degree of structural ﬂexibility that probably results from rotation of the pyrazole moiety and concomitant pore enlargement31. A total N2 uptake of 250 cm3 g−1 was observed and a Brunauer– Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of the data yielded a surface area of 711 m2 g−1. Post-synthetic metallation. Chelating pyrazole ligands are prevalent in transition-metal coordination chemistry32,33. Accordingly, the presence of a non-coordinated, structurally ﬂexible di-pyrazole moiety within the open channels of 1 prompted us to investigate post-synthetic metallation reactions. We treated 1 with a variety of metal salts, including CuCl2·2H2O, CoCl2·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 and Cd(NO3)2·6H2O, and quantiﬁed the degree of metallation using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) (Table 1). All metallation reactions were found to proceed in essentially quantitative yield with retention of crystallinity, as conﬁrmed by PXRD (Supplementary Figs 15 and 16).

Quantitative metallation of MOFs is uncommon17,19,34,35, so it is noteworthy that this ﬂexible system provides a platform for binding a wide variety of transition-metal ions with saturated binding site occupancy. A 77 K N2 gas adsorption isotherm (Fig. 3) performed on 1 metallated with CoCl2 yielded a Type 1 proﬁle with a BET surface area of 1,045 m2 g−1. In contrast to the non-metallated material 1-des, the low-pressure step is not observed. These data conﬁrm that metal coordination by the di-pyrazole moi- eties induces a ﬂexible-to-rigid structural transformation (Fig. 2c). We note that such a ﬂexible-to-rigid transformation, which is dependent on metal binding, is unprecedented in MOF chemistry. Observing a reversible Oh to Td transformation for 1·[Co(H2O)4]Cl2 by SCXRD. Given that 1 could be quantitatively metallated with retention of structural order in the bulk solid, we turned our efforts to obtaining SCXRD data. Deep blue crystals, formed by heating 1 in a solution of CoCl2·6H2O at 65 °C for 16 h, were utilized for SCXRD. On cooling to room temperature, the crystals became pink in colour, suggesting that a temperature-dependent transformation of the metallated species had occurred. SCXRD data collected on the pink form of the crystals were consistent with a formulation of 1·[Co(H2O)4]Cl2 (Fig. 4a), and reﬁnement of the occupancy of the Co(II) centre supported quantitative inclusion of the Co(II) entity (Supplementary Table 3; reﬁned Co occupancy of 93.5%). Close inspection of the structure revealed that metallation is accompanied by an anti to syn conformational switch of the pyrazole rings of the ligand (one pyrazole ring rotates ∼180° to facilitate coordination), allowing chelation to the Co(II) centre. The octahedral Co(II) metal centre is situated on a mirror plane and coordinated by four water ligands (one symmetry generated, bond lengths 2.045(5)–2.158(7) Å) in addition to the two pyrazole donors of L′, with a Co–N bond length of 2.159(4) Å.

This step is indicative of the ﬂexible nature of the non-metallated MOF, and the absence of this feature in the isotherm of 1·[CoCl2] shows that metal coordination by the di-pyrazole moieties of 1 induces a ﬂexible-to-rigid transformation in the structure.

All rights reserved. a post-synthetically metallated MOF where the identity, bond distances and angles of non-framework donor atoms can be determined by SCXRD. Heating 1·[Co(H2O)4]Cl2 crystals to 300 K on the diffract- ometer engendered a distinct colour change from pink to blue. Such colour changes are well known in Co(II) chemistry27 and are associated with a change in the ligand ﬁeld geometry from Oh to Td. We note that a similar transformation was achieved by placing pink crystals of 1·[Co(H2O)4]Cl2 in dry acetonitrile. Blue crystals formed by the latter route were most suitable for SCXRD experiments (as these crystals remain solvated) and analy- sis of the data revealed, as anticipated, that the primary coordi- nation sphere of the Co(II) centre has a tetrahedral geometry with two coordinated chloride ligands in addition to the two nitro- gen donors of L′ (Fig. 4b). Notably, in undergoing the SC–SC transformation from 1·[Co(H2O)4]Cl2 to 1·[CoCl2], the Cl− counter-ions migrate from the pores to the metal centre. Additionally, the di-pyrazole moiety of ligand L′ has again undergone a very signiﬁcant rotation, resulting in the Co(II) atom facing the opposite side of the pore when viewing the structure along the c axis. This signiﬁcant movement of the post-synthetically added metal ion is testament to the ﬂexibility of MOF 1 and bodes well for using this material as a general platform for studying inorganic reactivity, as outlined further below. Exposure of 1·[CoCl2] crystals to air resulted in conversion back to the pink octahedral form after several minutes. We conﬁrmed that this transformation was indeed consistent with the addition of four water molecules to the cobalt coordination sphere by elemental analysis. Observing the outcome of chemical reactions by SCXRD. We sought to extend the potential of the platform material MOF 1 to observing chemical products of Rh-centred reactions in the solid state. Given that Rh complexes are extensively used in homogeneous catalysis, structural insight into their chemistry is of signiﬁcant fundamental and practical interest. Accordingly, as a proof of principle that reaction products can be structurally elucidated in the MOF pores, 1 (Fig. 5a) was treated with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 in dry acetonitrile at room temperature for 48 h. SCXRD studies readily conﬁrmed that the Rh(I) species formed was 1·[Rh(CO)2][RhCl2(CO)2], where the Rh(I) centre (91% reﬁned occupancy) assumes the expected square planar geometry (Fig. 5b) consisting of two nitrogen donors from the di-pyrazole unit and two carbonyl ligands (Rh–C bond length 1.844(11) Å, consistent with previously reported Rh–C bond lengths for similar compounds)36. In addition, a square planar [RhCl2(CO)2]− counter-ion was located within the pores of the MOF37. Characteristic Fourier transform infrared stretches36,37 were observed for 1·[Rh(CO)2][RhCl2(CO)2] with ﬁve CO bands observed at 2,106, 2,075, 2,046, 2,033 and 2,002 cm−1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that when aqueous methanol was used in air to effect metallation, a different and unusual Rh(III) species 1·[Rh(H2O)4]Cl3 was characterized by SCXRD (Fig. 5d). Formation of a related octahedral Rh(III) species could also be achieved via a SC–SC transformation by exposing 1·[Rh(CO)2][RhCl2(CO)2] to water (1:1 MeOH/water) and air over extended periods. It is worth noting that full conversion to the oxidized Rh(III) species takes three months at room temperature to occur within the framework, suggesting that the MOF architecture stabilizes these metal sites towards hydrolysis. Further treatment of 1·[Rh(CO)2][RhCl2(CO)2] in CH3CN with MeI vapour resulted in a noticeable colour change of the crystals from bright yellow to bright orange (Supplementary Fig. 13). The orange colour is consistent with a Rh(III) species and hence suggested that oxidative addition of the halo-alkane to the Rh(I) complex had occurred. The SC–SC transformation was conﬁrmed by SCXRD, which showed that the Rh(I) complex (95% reﬁned occupancy) had undergone both an oxidative addition of MeI to give the methyl iodide adduct and a subsequent insertion (methyl migration) reaction of one of the CO ligands into the newly formed Rh–Me bond. This migration leaves a vacant coordination site on the octahedral Rh(III), which allows coordination by a solvent (acetonitrile) molecule (Fig. 5c). In 1·[Rh(CO)(CH3CN) (COMe)I]I, the Rh(III) metal centre adopts an octahedral geometry with the CO and CH3CN ligands in the same plane as the nitrogen a b Δ or CH3CN H2O Figure 4 | Structural details of the reversible SC–SC Oh to Td transformation for 1·[Co(H2O)4]Cl2 that can be realized by heating or immersion in acetonitrile. a, View of 1·[Co(H2O)4]Cl2 along the c axis showing the primary coordination sphere of the octahedral Co(II) centre.

Evidence for iodide (as opposed to chloride) ligands bound to the Rh(III) centre comes from the relative size of the peaks in the differ- ence electron density maps, the Rh–X bond lengths (2.982(2) and 3.008(5) Å), which lie well within the range expected for Rh–I bonds (Supplementary Fig. 12), and EDX analysis, which conﬁrms the expected Mn:Rh:I ratio of 3:1:2 (Supplementary Table 6). The square planar [Rh(CO)2Cl2]−counter-ion of the starting material is displaced during the course of this SC–SC reaction, as it is also known to react with MeI38,39. The presence of the CO and COMe ligands, as well as the absence of the [Rh(CO)2Cl2]−counter-ion, were further supported by infrared spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 1), with only one CO band remaining at 2,072 cm−1 and a new band appearing at 1,716 cm−1 corresponding to the C(=O)Me group40,41 (these are broadened as they relate to the four isomers of the Rh(III) complex present in the MOF). This type of chemistry has been observed for rhodium, but no direct observation of such pro- ducts containing this donor set has hitherto been accomplished by SCXRD40. In this case, signiﬁcantly, including the initial metallation of the MOF, a total of three sequential chemical reactions were carried out in quantitativeyield withinthe MOF without loss of single crystal- linity or leaching of Rh (Table 1). We also note that these are the ﬁrst examples of the products of oxidation reactions being elucidated within a MOF crystal by SCXRD. To provide mechanistic insight into the reaction that gave the crystallographically observed product 1·[Rh(CO)(CH3CN)(COMe)I]I, a density functional theory study of the reaction of a simpliﬁed model of the Rh(I) starting material with CH3I in acetonitrile solution was conducted (see Supplementary Section 12). Calculations were per- formed at the M11-L/6-31G(d,p) + SDD level of theory in conjunction with the SMD solvent model, where M11 is a dual-range functional that has been shown to provide excellent accuracy for organometallic chemistry and MOFs42,43. The calculated mechanism indicates the reaction proceeds via an SN2 attack on MeI by the Rh(I) species44. This oxidative addition step is found to be facilitated by the presence of the [Rh(Cl)2(CO)2]−counter-ion, which renders the Rh(I) species more nucleophilic. The reaction is completed by a methyl migration to yield the crystallographically observed reaction product 1·[Rh(CO)(CH3CN)(COMe)I]I. The geometries can be compared with the corresponding experimental values; in both cases, for the starting 1·[Rh(CO)2][RhCl2(CO)2] species and the ﬁnal product 1·[Rh(CO)(CH3CN)(COMe)I]I, the key structural parameters lie within ±0.1 Å of experimentally reﬁned values (see Supplementary Information). Furthermore, the stretching frequencies calculated for the ﬁnal product (2,227 cm−1, 1,900 cm−1) show qualitative agreement with the experimental values (2,072 cm−1 [CO], 1,716 cm−1[COMe]), although with a shift of ∼150–180 cm−1 due to the anchoring effect of the MOF, which is neglected (by necessity) in the calculations. Conclusions A key structural feature of 1 is the ﬂexibility of the chelating pyrazole donors, which predispose the material to binding a broad range of transition-metal ions and, importantly, accommodate the geometric rearrangements associated with metal-centred chemical reactions undertaken on the framework. The full extent of this structural ﬂexi- bility is captured by the dramatic structural rearrangement of the L′ backbone that occurs when 1·[Co(H2O)4]Cl2 is transformed into 1·[CoCl2]; during this reaction the di-pyrazole moiety ﬂips nearly 180° within the MOF and this occurs with retention of crystallinity. The ultimate outcome of this structural feature for the following chemistry within MOF 1 is that potential strain on the framework backbone is minimized. We posit this leads to preservation of the high degree of crystallinity described in each instance. In addition, close inspection of the metallated forms of 1 reveals that each pore hosts only a single framework-bound coordination site. This structural element alleviates the likely steric congestion that would undoubtedly diminish the capacity to explore reaction chemistry within the pore network in materials of higher symmetry45,46. Furthermore, the lower crystal symmetry (primitive monoclinic) minimizes the crystallographic challenges associated with following reactions within the MOF pores. In summary, we have synthesized a new MOF that is poised for post-synthetic metallation via the free chelating di-pyrazole moieties lining its pores. Remarkably, in the case of metallating the MOF with Rh(I) and subsequent addition of MeI, we were able to observe the reaction products of three consecutive chemical transformations within the pores of 1 by SCXRD. These data clearly show that MOF 1 is a unique platform that can be utilized to determine the structures of unusual species in the solid-state or elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal-based catalysis. a MeOH/H2O b c e d b c [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 CH3CN [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 MeOH/H2O MeOH/H2O Air b c b c b c Figure 5 | Reaction scheme showing X-ray crystallographic snapshots along the a axis of 1 treated with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 and subsequent oxidative reactions. a–e, Structure of 1 before treatment with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 (a), 1·[Rh(CO)2][RhCl2(CO)2] (b), 1·[Rh(CO)(CH3CN)(COMe)I]I (c) and 1·[Rh(H2O)4]Cl3 (d) (selected bond lengths in Å: Rh–O 2.080(5), 2.084(11) and 2.271(8)), and a view of the Rh(III) centre of 1·[Rh(CO)(CH3CN)(COMe)I]I (e) showing the other positions of the disorder model as faded atoms.

Methods SCXRD studies. Single crystals were mounted in paratone-N oil on a nylon loop. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 150(2) K with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.7107 Å) using an Oxford Diffraction X-calibur single-crystal X-ray diffractometer (1-des and 1·[Co(H2O)4]Cl2) or at 100(2) K on the MX-1 beamline of the Australian Synchrotron (λ = 0.7107 Å).

The Co–O bond lengths observed (2.045(5), 2.126(4) and 2.158(7) Å) are well within the range typically seen for octahedral Co(II) complexes. 1·[CoCl2]. Again, all atoms from the framework and the post-synthetically added metal species could be reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters (Supplementary Fig. 7 shows a thermal ellipsoid plot with the ellipsoids shown at the 50% probability level). The identity of the coordinated atoms was determined from the relative peak heights in the electron density maps and by consideration of the bond lengths for the Co–X (X = O or Cl) bonds as compared to data extracted from the CSD (Supplementary Fig. 11, CSD Version 5.35, release date November 2013). In this manner the two coordinated atoms were identiﬁed as Cl and further evidence for their presence was obtained by elemental and EDX analysis. 1·[Rh(CO)2][RhCl2(CO)2]. Once again, all framework atoms and those of the post- synthetically incorporated metal could be reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters (Supplementary Fig. 8 shows a thermal ellipsoid plot with the ellipsoids shown at the 50% probability level). 1·[Rh(H2O)4]Cl3. SCXRD conﬁrmed the rhodium species (88% reﬁned occupancy) to be octahedral with four isolated elliptical regions of electron density located ∼2 Å from the Rh centre (Supplementary Fig. 25). These peaks in the difference map were assigned as water ligands and, despite not being able to locate the hydrogen atoms, were satisfactorily reﬁned as water molecules (Supplementary Fig. 9 shows a thermal ellipsoid plot with the ellipsoids shown at the 50% probability level). The anions could not be located but their presence in the lattice was supported by elemental analysis as chloride. 1·[Rh(CO)(CH3CN)(COMe)I]I. As the Rh(I) species in 1·[Rh(CO)2][RhCl2(CO)2] can undergo initial reaction from either above or below, two arrangements for the iodide and methyl ligands are possible, and these two intermediates can further undergo methyl migration onto one of the two CO groups. This generates four possible isomers of the ﬁnal product, which are disordered across a mirror plane. The two positions of the disordered iodide ligands are readily evident from the difference electron density maps, with two large peaks appearing in the range 2.9–3.0 Å above and below the N–Rh–N plane. Similarly, disorder of the CO/CH3CN ligands in the N–Rh–N plane could also be identiﬁed in this manner with two peaks (CO/NC) of higher electron density in close proximity and a third, lower peak (CH3) ∼1.5 Å from the second. Using Fobv (observed structure-factor amplitude) electron density plots, which provide evidence for a three-atom species, that is, the acetyl group (Supplementary Fig. 26), a disorder model could be developed and reﬁned against the data (Supplementary Fig. 10 shows a thermal ellipsoid plot with the ellipsoids shown at the 50% probability level). Due to the proximity of the iodide and acetyl ligands and the signiﬁcant electron density associated with the iodide anions, the disordered acetyl moieties were placed in calculated positions and reﬁned with coordinates, site occupancy factors (s.o.f.) and isotropic displacement parameters (U) ﬁxed (the latter at 0.15).

Specific details of each refinement Structure of 1: The structure has large solvent accessible voids. These contained a number of diffuse electron density peaks that could not be adequately identified and refined as solvent. The SQUEEZE routine of PLATON was applied to the collected data, which resulted in significant reductions in R1 and wR2 and an improvement in the GOF. R1, wR2 and GOF before SQUEEZE routine: 17.17%, 52.54%, 2.319; after SQUEEZE routine: 5.65%, 17.02%, 1.068. The contents of the solvent region calculated from the result of SQUEEZE routine equates to 8 DMF molecules. Structure of 1-des: This structure contains solvent accessible voids but, due to the desolvation of the framework, does not contain any significant electron density. Use of the SQUEEZE routine was not justified. Structure of 1·[Co(H2O)4]Cl2: The structure has large solvent accessible voids. Within these voids, one half-occupied chloride ion was unambiguously located (positioned on a mirror plane), while the other half chloride ion was assigned over two positions (0.25 × 2) based on chemical sensibility and location. The void channels contained a number of other diffuse electron density peaks that could not be adequately identified and refined as solvent. The SQUEEZE routine of PLATON was applied to the collected data, which resulted in significant reductions in R1 and wR2 and an improvement in the GOF. R1, wR2 and GOF before SQUEEZE routine: 19.31%, 52.41% and 1.960; after SQUEEZE routine: 9.38%, 24.70% and 1.033. The contents of the solvent region calculated from the result of SQUEEZE routine equates to 9 methanol molecules. Structure of 1·[CoCl2]: The structure has large solvent accessible voids. These contained a number of diffuse electron density peaks that could not be adequately identified and refined as solvent. The SQUEEZE routine of PLATON was applied to the collected data, which resulted in significant reductions in R1 and wR2 and an improvement in the GOF. R1, wR2 and GOF before SQUEEZE routine: 14.53%, 44.17%, 1.718; after SQUEEZE routine: 7.76%, 21.81%, 1.026. The contents of the solvent region calculated from the result of SQUEEZE routine equates to 19 acetonitrile molecules. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved. NATURE CHEMISTRY | www.nature.com/naturechemistry 14 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION DOI: 10.1038/NCHEM.2045 Structure of 1·[Rh(CO)2][RhCl2(CO)2]: The diffrn_measured_fraction_theta_full is low (91.8%). This is low due to the constraints of the goniometer (phi rotation) and the orientation of the crystal during this particular data collection. It is not possible to remove and remount crystals of this sample following a data collection at 100K (the crystal collapse upon warming). Datasets with better completeness have been obtained but the quality of these crystals were lower and provided a less satisfactory refinement. The SQUEEZE routine of PLATON was applied to the collected data, which resulted in slight reductions in R1 and wR2 but no change in the GOF. R1, wR2 and GOF before SQUEEZE routine: 7.93%, 24.95%, 1.032; after SQUEEZE routine: 7.49%, 23.21%, 1.036. The contents of the solvent region calculated from the result of SQUEEZE routine equates to 3 acetonitrile molecules. Structure of 1·[Rh(H2O)4]Cl3: The ratio of the given and expected molecular weight differ as based on elemental analysis the formula was modified to include anions not located in the difference map. This addition of chloride anions in line with the residual election density removed using the squeeze routine. The SQUEEZE routine of PLATON was applied to the collected data, which resulted in slight reductions in R1 and wR2 but no change in the GOF. R1, wR2 and GOF before SQUEEZE routine: 12.31%, 39.57%, 1.624; after SQUEEZE routine: 7.50%, 23.31%, 1.068. The contents of the solvent region calculated from the result of SQUEEZE routine equates to 15 methanol molecules, in addition to the 6 chloride anions (3 per Rh). Structure of 1·[Rh(CO)(CH3CN)(COMe)I]I: A number of restraints (18) were used to allow the structure to be adequately refined. The largest peak in the difference map is located adjacent to a partially occupied iodide counterion residing in the pores of the MOF. For the post-synthetically added Rh moiety of the structure further restraints and constraints were employed. The I ligand is disordered over two positions corresponding to reaction with the Rh from above or below; both sites were refined with an occupancy set at 0.25 (these are on the mirror plane). The CO(Me) group is also disordered over these same two positions. Due to the significant electron density associated with the iodide anions these atoms could not be definitely identified in the difference map or refined and were placed in calculated positions with chemically sensible bond lengths and angles; an AFIX 1 command was used (i.e. the coordinates, s.o.f. and U are fixed [at 0.15]). The CO and CH3CN ligands are also disordered over the mirror plane and thus occupy the same site. These were refined with a combination of DFIX restraints (3) and EADP and EXYZ restraints. Unfortunately, this approach results © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved. NATURE CHEMISTRY | www.nature.com/naturechemistry 15 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION DOI: 10.1038/NCHEM.2045 in an averaging of bond lengths for these atom positions (specifically the parameters involving Rh, N/C and C/O). ISOR restraints were used for C92 and O95 (the CO ligand). One site for the non-coordinated iodine counterion was located in the pores and this was refined with occupancy of 0.25 (on a mirror plane). Additional sites for this iodine anion could not be definitively located and half an iodide anion was included in the formula. The SQUEEZE routine of PLATON was applied to the collected data, which resulted in improvements in R1, wR2 and the GOF. R1, wR2 and GOF after SQUEEZE routine: 10.76%, 32.71%, 1.001. The contents of the solvent region calculated from the result of SQUEEZE routine equates to 9.5 acetonitrile molecules, in addition to the iodide anion not found in the difference map (0.25 per Rh). © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Theoretical procedures Density functional theory studies were carried out with the Gaussian 092 suite of programs. Geometries of gas phase minimum and transition state electronic structures were optimised using the Minnesota meta hybrid functional M11-L3,4 with Stuttgart-Dresden effective core potential SDD5,6 for Rh and I atoms and Pople’s basis set 6-31G(d,p)7-9 for rest of the atoms. Frequency calculations were carried out at that level to ensure convergence (all positive eigenvalues for minima and single negative for saddle points). Thermochemical corrections and zero point vibrational energies, as well as the infrared spectra, were determined at the gas phase M11-L/6-31G(d,p)+SDD level using the unscaled frequencies. The solvation energies, for acetonitrile solution, were calculated as singlet points on the gas-phase optimized structures. These calculations were performed using the SMD model10. An additional correction term, ΔnRT ln(RT/P°) is included to account for passage of molecules from 1 atm to 1 mol/L in solution. 12.2. Detailed theoretical results The ligated Rh(I) is first involved in an SN2 attack on MeI through TS-I (ΔHsoln ≠ = +10.4 kcal mol-1) to form the Rh(III) complex II (Figure SI 20). The presence of the counterion [Rh(Cl)2(CO)2]- at the axial position in I is responsible for rendering the ligated Rh(I) center more nucleophilic. Electron donation by [Rh(Cl)2(CO)2]- counterion onto the ligated Rh(I) to facilitate the SN2 attack is evidenced by the shortening of the intermolecular Cl…Rh bond length from 3.245 (I) to 2.901 (TS-I) and to 2.722 Å (II). The intermediate II at this stage is 4.5 kcal mol-1 more endothermic than the starting materials. To drive the reaction forward, the subsequent 1,2-migratory insertion of the methyl group into the carbonyl requires an overall barrier of 18.1 kcal mol-1 to reach an exothermic minimum III (ΔHsoln = -15.0 kcal mol-1).

The addition of MeCN solvent molecule to the electron deficient cationic Rh(III) IV complex is a facile process (TS-III; activation barrier of +11.5 kcal mol-1) yielding the solvated product VI. However to reach a more energetically stable state, the anion V is oxidized by another MeI through TS-IV to VII (ΔHsoln = -28.1 kcal mol-1). Recombination of VI and iodide and the concomitant explusion of VIII is further exothermic (ΔHsoln = -30.5 kcal mol-1). Supplementary Figure 27.
