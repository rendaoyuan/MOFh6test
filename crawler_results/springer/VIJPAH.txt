This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract Based on 5-mercapto-1H-tetrazole-1-methane- sulfonic acid disodium salt (Na2mtms) and 4,40-bipyridine (bpy) as ligands, four new transitionmetal complexes, namely {[Cd2(mtms)(bpy)2(OAc)2]H2O}n (1), {[Cd(mtms)(bpy)2- (H2O)2]2bpy4H2O}n (2), {[Zn2(l2-OH)(mtms)(bpy)3(H2O)]- ClO4H2O}n (3), and {[Co(mtms)2(bpy)(H2O)2][Co(bpy)2- (H2O)4]H2O}n(4),havebeensynthesizedandcharacterizedby single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 features a pillared- layer coordination architecture linked by acetate, mtms, and bridging bpy ligands. Complex 2 has a 1D polymeric structure with [Cd(mtms)(bpy)2(H2O)2] as the repeating unit; these inﬁnite chains are further connected into a 3D supramolecular framework through p–p stacking of bpy ligands. In complex 3, themtmsligandcombinedwithl2-OHbridgestwoZnatomsto form a dimer structure, which is different from that of complex 2. Complex 4 shows a 3D supramolecular network containing inﬁnite [Co(mtms)2(bpy)(H2O)2]2- anionic chains and free [Co(bpy)2(H2O)4]2? cationic components. The luminescence properties of 1 and 2 and the electrochemical properties of 3 are reported. Introduction Chemical templates have an important role in the formation of complexes containing multiple components that have deﬁned structural assemblies [1, 2]. Several previous studies have shown that geometries and sizes of ligands, the coordinating ability of anions, and the nature of metals are all important in determining the structures of such complexes [3–8]. N-het- erocycles with sulfhydryl ligands are capable of –N(H)– C(=S) $ –N=C(–SH) tautomerization. Heterocyclic nitro- gen can participate in coordination, while the sulfhydryl moiety can be used as a bridging group [8–14]. The soft sulfhydryl group has good coordination ability, because it has empty 3d orbital that can accept electrons from the metal [8, 14–16]. Recently, research into nitrogen heterocycles with sulfhydryl ligands has mainly concentrated on sulfhydryl imidazole, sulfhydryl-(1,2,4)-triazole, and sulfhydryl tetra- zole [8, 14, 17–19]. In our previous studies, we have reported some novel coordination polymers with 5-mercapto-1H-tet- razole-1-acetic acid [17]. In addition, bis- or multidentate ligands based on bipyridine (bpy) are outstanding bridging ligands, and a number of frameworks have been synthesized [20, 21]. Normally, 4,40-bpy is an effective rodlike linker joining metal atoms for propagation of coordination networks [14, 21, 22]. Herein, we present four transition coordination polymers containing mtms (Scheme 1) and bpy (Scheme 2) co- ligands, namely {[Cd2(mtms)(bpy)2(OAc)2]H2O}n (1), {[Cd(mtms)(bpy)2(H2O)2]2bpy4H2O}n (2), {[Zn2(l2-OH)- (mtms)(bpy)3(H2O)]ClO4H2O}n (3), and {[Co(mtms)2- (bpy)(H2O)2][Co(bpy)2(H2O)4]H2O}n (4).

Elemental analyses for C, H, N, and S were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer 2400II elemental analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrometer with KBr pellets in the range 4,000–400 cm-1. Electrochemical measurements were made at room temperature using a BAS Epsilon electrochemical workstation with a conventional three- electrode cell consisting of a glassy carbon working elec- trode, a platinum auxiliary, and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE). KCl (0.1 mol L-1) was used as a supporting electrolyte in aqueous solution. Synthesis of complex 1 Bipyridine (77.8 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of Na2mtms (120.6 mg, 0.5 mmol) and Cd(OAc)22H2O (274.0 mg, 1 mmol) in a mixture of 15 ml (1:1) H2O/EtOH. The mixture was stirred under reﬂux for 3 h and then ﬁltered. After a month, colorless block crys- tals were obtained from the ﬁltrate. Yield: 60 %. Anal.

X-ray crystallography Diffraction data were collected on a Bruker Smart CCD dif- fractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 298 K. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least squares on F2 using SHELXL-97 [23]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were positioned geometrically and reﬁned by a riding mode. The crystallo- graphic data for 1–4 are listed in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and anglesare listed inTable 2 in the Supplementary Information. Results and discussion Crystal structure of complex 1 As shown in Fig. 1a, complex 1 exhibits a dimeric structure in which two Cd atoms are bridged by two acetates; one adopts syn–syn mode (l2, g2-carboxylato), and the other coordinates throughoneO atom(l2, g1-carboxylato),which isdifferent to other previously reported binuclear Cd(II) complexes [24]. The CdCd distance is 3.9462 A˚ . Cd1 and Cd2 adopt octa- hedralcoordinationgeometries.Cd1iscoordinatedbythreeO atoms from two acetates, and three N atoms from two bpy ligands and one mtms ligand. Cd2 is ligated by two N atoms from two bpy ligands, two O atoms from two acetate anions, plus one O atom and one S atom from an mtms ligand. The mtms acts as a tridentate-bridging ligand (Scheme 1, mode I) to link adjacent dimeric Cd(II) units, generating a 1D zigzag inﬁnite chain. The adjacent Cd-mtms chains are further con- nected into a 2D pillared-layer architecture by bridging-bpy ligands along the ac plane (Scheme 2, mode I) (Fig. 1b). Finally, complex 1 forms a supramolecular 3D network through intermolecular hydrogen bonds [O8–8CO6 = 2.848(16) A˚ , O8–H8BO2A = 2.788(19) A˚ ] (symmetry code: A: x ? 1/2, -y?3/2, z ? 1/2) (Fig. 1c). The relevant hydrogen bond parameters are summarized in Table 3. Crystal structure of complex 2 Complex 2 was synthesized in a similar way as for 1, except that Cd(OAc)22H2O was replaced by Cd(ClO4)26H2O. However, complex 2 shows a linear, inﬁnite 1D polymeric structure with a neutral component [Cd(mtms)(bpy)2(H2O)2] as the repeating unit (Fig. 2a), which is quite different from complex 1. The Cd atom is in a distorted octahedral geometry, with three N atoms from three bpy ligands, two O atoms from two coordinated water ligands, and one S atom from an mtms ligand. The mtms ligand adopts an S-bonding monodentate coordination mode (Scheme 1, mode II), and the tetrazole ring is on the outside, as also found in our previously reported mercapto- tetrazole complexes [Cd(mtz)2Br2] (mtz = 1-[2-(N,N- dimethylamino-ethyl]-5-mercapto-1H-tetrazole) [8] and {[CoIII(mmtz)2(1,10-phen)2]NO3} (mmtz = 1-methyl-5- mercapto-tetrazole [14]. Of the bpy ligands in complex 2, one adopts a terminal coordination mode to link Cd(II) forming [CdN3O2S] units (Scheme 2, mode II), while the other acts as a spacer to bridge the [CdN3O2S] units, leading to 1D inﬁnite chains along the b axis (Scheme 2, mode I). These 1D chains are further connected into a 3D supramolecular framework through p–p stacking interac- tions from the free neutral bpy ligands (Scheme 2, mode V) and hydrogen bonds among the bpy ligands (Scheme 2, Transition Met Chem (2013) 38:757–763 759 123 mode I, IV), coordinated water, and the uncoordinated O atom of the mtms ligand (Fig. 2b). In short, the bpy ligands play an important role in forming the structure of 2, revealing ﬁve different coordination modes.

In complex 3 (Fig. 3a), the bidentate-bridging mtms ligand (Scheme 1, mode III) combines with an l2-OH bridge between two Zn atoms to form a binuclear unit. The coordination environment of 3 shows a butterﬂy-like structure, in which four bpy ligands act as the wings, while the mtms ligand is located at the head. Zn1 is surrounded by two bpy ligands, one mtms ligand, one coordinated water ligand, and one hydroxy ligand to form a distorted trigonal–bipyramidal geometry. The axial positions are occupied by N4 and O5 with an N4–Zn1–O5 bond angle of 174.12(13). While Zn2 is in a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry provided by one hydroxy, one mtms, and two bpy ligands. The Zn–N bond distances range from 2.022(4) to 2.215(4) A˚ , and the Zn–S bond distance is 2.3215(16) A˚ , which are similar to other complexes [23, 24]. The binuclear units link each other by bpy ligands (Scheme 2, mode I, II) to form a 1D zigzag chain along the c axis. The most important inter- chain interaction in the crystal packing is hydrogen bonds among uncoordinated ClO4 -, coordinated hydroxy, coor- dinated water, free water, the uncoordinated sulfonic group of mtms, and the bpy ligand (Scheme 2, mode III) (Fig. 3b). Compared to the similar coordination modes of bpy in complexes 2 and 3, the architecture of 3 is more complicated. The tetrazolyl-N of mtms can provide potential coordination sites, and uncoordinated ClO4 - anion may also help to determine the ﬁnal coordination architectures. Crystal structure of complex 4 As illustrated in Fig. 4a, complex 4 contains two compo- nents, namely [Co(mtms)2(bpy)(H2O)2]2- and [Co(b- py)2(H2O)4]2? ions. Atom Co1 is located on a crystallographic inversion center and octahedrally coordi- nated by two mtms N atoms and two bpy N atoms in the equatorial plane, plus two coordinated water ligands in the axial positions, with an O4–Co1–O4A bond angle of 180.0. The coordination environment of Co2 is provided by two bpy N atoms in the axial positions, with four coordinated water ligands in the equatorial plane. The Co2–N bond distances range from 2.179(6) to 2.203(5) A˚ , which are comparable with other complexes [25]. The structure of the complex anion [Co(mtms)2(b- py)(H2O)2]2- is the same as that of our previously reported complex [CoII(mmtz)2(4,40-bpy)(H2O)2]n (mmtz = 1- methyl-5-mercapto-tetrazole) [14]. The mtms acts as a N-bonding monodentate ligand (Scheme 1, mode IV). The bpy spacers bridge adjacent Co1 atoms to generate a 1D chain along the b axis (Scheme 2, mode II). The bpy ligands adopt terminal coordination mode (Scheme 2, mode I) to link Co2 centers, forming the cationic complex [Co(bpy)2(H2O)4]2?. These Co2 components are vertically penetrating into the 1D chains of Co1, showing a rail-like structure (Fig. 4d). The supramolecular structure mainly depends on the p–p stacking of bpy (Scheme 2, mode V), and intermolecular hydrogen bonds among the water ligands, the uncoordinated sulfonic group of the mtms ligand, and the bpy ligand (Scheme 2, mode III). Photoluminescence properties It is well known that Cd(II) complexes can exhibit inter- esting luminescence properties [8, 24]. The solid-state luminescence of the free Na2mtms ligand and complexes 1 and 2 was investigated at room temperature and is shown in Fig. 5. Na2mtms shows an emission peak at 460 nm when excited at 301 nm. Upon excitation at 304 nm, complexes 1 and 2 display emission maxima at 353 and 362 nm, respectively, which are both greatly blue-shifted compared to the free Na2mtms ligand. Since the Cd(II) center has d10 electronic conﬁguration, the emissions of complexes 1 and 2 can be tentatively assigned to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) [26–28]. These complexes may be suit- able as blue-light-emitting materials, since they show luminescence in the blue region [29]. Fig. 2 a View of the 1D inﬁnite chain of 2 along the b axis.

Measurements were carried out at room temperature by scanning from -0.600 to ?1.400 V at different scan rates. The CV shows an oxidation peak at 0.444 V with the scan rate of 50 mV s-1, while there is no corresponding reduction wave. As the scan rate is increased to 80 and 100 mV s-1, the anodic peak appears at 0.479 and 0.567 V, respectively. Again, no corresponding cathodic wave was observed, showing that the electrochemical behavior of the Zn(II)/Zn(I) redox couple is irreversible [30]. Conclusion Four new complexes have been constructed from mixed mtms and bpy ligands. The 2D pillared-layer structure of 1 is obtained with carboxylato groups, while complexes 2, 3, and the host structure 4 all exhibit 1D inﬁnite chain structures. The results demonstrate that coordinated anions can increase the dimensionality of the crystal structures, while uncoor- dinated anions can propagate the architectures through hydrogen bonding and p–p stacking interactions. The mtms ligand shows four different coordination modes in the four complexes. The varied coordination modes of the neutral rigid linear bpy ligand (bridging coordination, terminal coordination, hydrogen bond, and p–pstacking) found in this study proves that it is an excellent building block in con- structing novel hybrid frameworks. In summary, for the complexes 1–4 described in this paper, we can see that the properties of the anion, mtms, and bpy ligands all help to determine the ﬁnal coordination architectures.
