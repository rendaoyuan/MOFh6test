In these compounds, only the terminal primary amino groups are coordinated to the metal centers. The adducts are stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds. NMR spectroscopy indicates that only the adduct with Zr(OiPr)4 is stable in benzene solution, whereas it dissociates in the case of Ti(OiPr)4. When dichloromethane was used as the solvent, spermine dihydrochloride crystallized from the solution. Keywords Metal alkoxides  Amine adducts  Coordination polymers  Structure analysis Introduction The formation of Lewis acid adducts is an omnipresent phenomenon during sol–gel processing of metal alkoxides. Any Lewis base present in the system, such as alcohols used as solvent, can potentially coordinate to the metal center. Oligomerization through formation of alkoxo bridges is due to the same fact and competes with the formation of adducts. The reactivity of metal alkoxides is strongly inﬂuenced by both phenomena. Adduct formation is probably also the ﬁrst step in substitution of alkoxo groups by protic compounds, which is used for the organic modiﬁcation of metal alkoxides [1]. Adducts of alcohols or amines with tetravalent metal alkoxides are stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding from the OR or NH hydrogen to neighboring alkoxo oxygen atoms (Fig. 1) [2–4]. Alkyl di- or triamines result in the formation of one- or two-dimensional coor- dination polymers (Fig. 1) [5, 6]. The stability of the amine adducts depends on the basicity of the amine, but also the hydrogen-donor ability. Therefore, secondary amines form less stable adducts than primary amines because the latter form more stable hydrogen bonds [7]. Thus, when primary and secondary amino groups compete with each other, as in the case of bis(2-aminoethyl)amine, no coordination of the secondary amino group was observed due to the lower hydrogen-donor ability. The formation of chain-like coordination polymers with diamines contrasts with bis(b-diketonates) [8] or dioxi- mates [9], where metallacylic compounds are preferentially obtained. By reacting spermine, N,N0-bis(3-aminopropyl)- 1,4-diaminobutane, with M(OiPr)4 (M = Ti, Zr) we wan- ted to test whether increasing the length of the linker between the two primary amino groups has an inﬂuence on the chain versus ring issue, especially because the secondary amino groups could internally stabilize such structures. Results and discussion In previous studies we were able to crystallize amine adducts from dichloromethane solution; the formation of the adducts was also observed by solution NMR spectros- copy [5, 6]. In the reaction of spermine, however, no crystallization of amine adducts of metal alkoxides from CH2Cl2 solution was observed. In contrast, large crystals of spermine dihydrochloride (1) were formed. Protonation of S. O. Baumann  A. Van Du  C. Artner  C. Maurer  U.

Reaction of spermine with hydrochloric acid yields the tetrahydrochloride [11, 12]. Crystalline spermine dihydrochloride (1) has an all- trans conformation (Fig. 2), with a coplanar arrangement of all carbon and nitrogen atoms, whereas the tetrahydro- chloride has C(3)–N(2)–C(4)–C(5) torsional angle of 66.7(2) [11, 12]. Each Cl- anion of 1 is connected to two terminal amino groups through hydrogen bonds (Table 1; Fig. 3). Furthermore, pairs of sperminium molecules are connected through two N–HCl interactions. The layers thus obtained are aligned parallel to the (103) plane and are interconnected by N(1)–H(1N2)N(2) hydrogen bond interactions. Because of the formation of 1 in dichloromethane, tol- uene was used as solvent in the following experiments. X-ray structure analysis of the crystals obtained upon reaction of Ti(OiPr)4 with spermine revealed inﬁnite chains of [Ti2(OiPr)8(C10H26N4)]? (2; Fig. 4), which are aligned in the [111] direction. The chain structure is similar to that obtained with bis(2-aminoethyl)amine [5, 6]. In 2, each primary amino group interacts with one titanium atom of the centrosymmetric Ti2(OiPr)8 dimers. The secondary amino groups remain uncoordinated. Moreover, the sec- ondary amino groups in 2 do not act as hydrogen bond donors as in 1. In contrast, the adduct formation of the primary amino groups is supported by intramolecular N–HO interactions to the oxygen atom of an OiPr group (N(1)O(2), 298.0(2); Table 2). The distances in 2 are comparable to those observed for other amine adducts of titanium alkoxides [5, 6]. The dimerization of two Ti(OiPr)4 units and the for- mation of amine adducts increase the coordination number of the titanium atoms to six. Coordination of the amino ligands is perpendicular to the central Ti2O2 ring, with a nearly linear O–Ti–N axis [O(2)–Ti(1)–N(1) 170.32(5)]. Owing to the longer Ti(1)–N(1) distance of 230.75(15) pm compared to the average Ti–O bond length of 193.5 pm, the equatorial OiPr groups are able to move closer towards the N(1) apex of the distorted octahedron (average N(1)– Ti(1)–O 84.7). For the reaction of Zr(OiPr)4iPrOH with spermine, a chain-like coordination polymer was obtained, consisting of dimeric [Zr(OiPr)4]2 subunits interconnected by the amine ligands, viz. [Zr2(OiPr)8(C10H26N4)]? (3, Fig. 5; Table 3). As in 2, only the terminal primary amino groups coordinate to the Lewis acidic metal centers. In contrast to 2, however, the secondary amino groups in 3 form intra- molecular N–HN hydrogen bonds to the nearest primary amino group (Table 4). These bonds result in a deviation from the zigzag chain structure as in 1. Intermolecular interactions were not observed. The N–HO hydrogen bonds between the metal-coordinating amino group and the alkoxo group oxygen atoms O(3) and O(8) are longer [NO 309.1(9) and 307.3(9)] in 3 compared to 298.0(2) pm in 2, as a consequence of the larger distances in the zirconium alkoxide. The latter also results in a stronger distortion of the ZrO5N octahedra with more pronounced bending of the equatorial OiPr groups towards the N(1) and N(4) apices (average N–Zr–O 82.9 in 3 vs. N(1)–Ti(1)–O 84.7 in 2).

O. Baumann et al. 123 In line with previous investigations [5, 6], the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of crystals of 2 dissolved in C6D6 are rather similar to the starting compounds. This indicates de- coordination of the NH2 groups upon dissolution and, thus, reversibility of the adduct formation. For the zirconium compound 3, however, the NMR spectroscopic investiga- tions gave a different picture. Splitting of the initial peaks was observed for the CH and CH3 signals of the OiPr groups (dCH = 5.17/4.61 ppm and dCH3 = 1.59/1.43 ppm), indicating a different chemical environment of the different OiPr groups in the TiO5N octahedra (i.e., trans to the coordinating NH2 group, in equatorial and bridging position) in solution. Moreover, splitting of the N–H proton signals was observed. The spectroscopic results lead to the conclusion that upon dissolution of 3, which has a lower solubility than the corresponding titanium compound 2, dissociation of the primary amino groups is either incomplete Fig. 3 Crystal structure of 1.

This is interesting for sol–gel processing of modiﬁed metal alkoxides with regard to pre-organization of alkoxides in the reaction mixture prior to the start of hydrolysis and condensation reactions. Conclusions We have shown that reaction of spermine with M(OiPr)4 (M = Ti, Zr) results in the formation of coordination poly- mers [M2(OiPr)8(C10H26N4)]? in which only the terminal primary amino groups coordinate to the metal center. Contrary to spermine dihydrochloride, only intramolecular, but no inter-chain hydrogen bonding was observed. Disso- lution in C6D6 resultsin dissociation of the adducts in the case of the titanium compound 2. For the less soluble zirconium compound 3, however, the adducts appear to be retained, at least to some extent. When dichloromethane was used as a solvent, no adducts with the metal alkoxides were observed but instead spermine dihydrochloride (1) formed. Experimental All operations were carried out in a moisture- and oxy- gen-free argon atmosphere using Schlenk and glovebox techniques. The quoted yields are for the ﬁrst crop of crystals. Spermine (Fluka, 99 %) was dried either with sodium sulfate followed by recrystallization from tolu- ene or with K2CO3 and subsequent distillation. All solvents were dried and puriﬁed by standard methods. The solvents for NMR spectroscopy (Eurisotop) were degassed prior to use and stored over molecular sieves. 1H and 13C solution NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 250 (250.13 MHz [1H], 62.86 MHz [13C]) equipped with a 5-mm inverse-broadband probe head and a z-gradient unit. Spermine dihydrochloride (1) Spermine (520 mg, 2.57 mmol) was dissolved in 1.0 cm3 of dichloromethane and heated to reﬂux for 3 min. A white precipitate and colorless crystals of C10H26N42HCl (1) were obtained upon cooling to room temperature. Yield 376 mg (61 %). Titanium isopropoxide spermine adduct (2, [Ti2(OiPr)8(C10H26N4)]?)

X-ray structure analyses Single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were per- formed on a Bruker-AXS APEX diffractometer with a CCD area detector and a crystal-to-detector distance of 5.0 cm using graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (k = 71.073 pm). The data collection at 100 K covered a hemisphere of the reciprocal space by recording three sets of exposures, each of them exhibiting a different U angle. The time period for each exposure was 3–10 s, each of them covering 0.3 in x. The data (Table 5) were corrected for polarization and Lorentz effects, and an empirical absorption correction (SADABS) was applied [13]. The cell dimensions were reﬁned with all unique reﬂections.
