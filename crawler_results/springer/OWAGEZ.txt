Tiekink Received: 27 January 2011 / Accepted: 15 April 2011 / Published online: 24 April 2011  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract The structure of n-Bu2Sn(2-methyl-3,5-dini- trobenzoato)2 (1) presents a rare structural motif for com- pounds with the general formula R2Sn(O2CR0)2 which almost exclusively adopt skew-trapezoidal bipyramidal geometries. By contrast, the structure of (1) is polymeric with the polymer backbone comprising eight-membered {SnOCO}2 rings linked at the pivotal tin atoms. The coordination geometry is octahedral trans-C2O4. The rela- tionship between structural motifs for R2Sn(O2CR0)2 is discussed.

Keywords Organotin  Carboxylate  Polymer  New structural motif Introduction Organotin compounds, including organotin carboxylates, continue to attract signiﬁcant attention owing to their use and potential use in a wide variety of applications; the utility of inorganic tin notwithstanding [1]. The primary use of organotins appears to be as a stabiliser for PVC, with additional applications as ionophores in sensors, and as synthetic precursors for hybrid organic–inorganic materials. In the biological realm, their use as marine anti-foulants is reducing owing to deleterious side-effects on non-targeted marine life. Nevertheless, organotin compounds are show- ing promise as larvicides, insecticides, and fungicides, and, in particular, as potential pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer [1]. Amongst the most widely studied organotins are those derivatives containing carboxylate ligands [1] and, as such, the structural chemistry of these species have been widely studied by specialized spectroscopic techniques, e.g. Mo¨ssbauer and 119Sn NMR, both in the solid state and in solution, as well of course, X-ray crystallographic studies. Several reviews have appeared dedicated to the structural chemistry of organotin carboxylates and each have com- mented upon the structural diversity exhibited in their solid state structures [2–4]. Despite their well documented pro- pensity to hydrolyse into tetranuclear organotin species [5], i.e. {[R2Sn(O2CR0)2]2O}2 (for R, R0 = alkyl, aryl), the structural chemistry of diorganotin bis-carboxylates, R2Sn(O2CR0)2 (for R, R0 = alkyl, aryl), is somewhat bland compared to other organotin carboxylates [2]. A search of the Cambridge Structural Database [6] reveals over 80 neutral molecules (excluding duplicate structure determi- nations but including solvates) of the general formula R2Sn(O2CR0)2 where the carboxylate ligand carries no additional anionic coordinating site, such as phenoxide-O or thiolate-S.

The organic substituents are disposed to lie over the long edge of the skewed trapezoid, that is the edge deﬁned by oxygen atoms forming the long SnO interactions. Herein, motivated by the aforementioned biological potential of organotin car- boxylates, the crystal and molecular structure of n-Bu2Sn- (2-methyl-3,5-dinitrobenzoato)2 (1) is described which was found to adopt a polymeric motif in contrast to the normally observed monomeric motif. Experimental Synthesis Di-n-butyl tin oxide (Alfa Aeser; 1.00 g, 4 mmol) and 3,5-dinitro o-toluic acid (1.808 g, 8 mmol), prepared by the literature procedure [7], were mixed together in dry toluene (100 mL) in a 250 mL round bottom ﬂask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a water condenser and a Dean Stark apparatus, for continuous removal of water formed as side- product. The reaction mixture was reﬂuxed at the boiling temperature of toluene for 5 h and allowed to stand over- night at room temperature. It was then ﬁltered, and toluene was removed under reduced pressure. The isolated colorless solid was recrystallized from warm chloroform (3 mL); m. pt. = 125 C. Characteristic IR bands: 2954 (mC–H), 1703 (mC=O), 1172 (mC–O), 1541 (mN=O), 1348 (mN–O), 642 (mSn–C), 470 (mSn–O) cm-1. X-ray Crystallography Intensity data for a colorless block were collected at 293 K on a Bruker KAPPA APEXII CCD ﬁtted with Mo Ka radiation. The data set was corrected for absorption effects using SADABS [8], and reduced using standard methods with the aid of APEX and SAINT [9]. The structure was solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97 [10] and reﬁned by a full-matrix least-squares procedure on F2 using SHELXL-97 [10] with anisotropic displacement param- eters for non-hydrogen atoms and a weighting scheme of the form w = 1/[r2(Fo 2) ? (0.03P)2 ? 0.13P] where P = (Fo 2 ? 2Fc 2)/3. All hydrogen atoms were included in the ﬁnal reﬁnement in their calculated positions. Crystal data and reﬁnement details are given in Table 1. Figure 1, showing the atom labeling scheme, was drawn with 35% displacement ellipsoids using ORTEP-3 [11] and the remaining ﬁgures were drawn with DIAMOND [12]. Data interpretation was accomplished using PLATON [13]. Results and Discussion Molecular Structure The tin atom in n-Bu2Sn(2-methyl-3,5-dinitrobenzoato)2 (1) lies on a crystallographic center of inversion and therefore the asymmetric unit comprises half a tin atom, a tin-bound n-butyl group, and a 2-methyl-3,5-dinitroben- zoate anion, see Fig. 1. The 2-methyl-3,5-dinitrobenzoate is bidentate, bridging two translationally related tin atoms so that the tin atom exists within a trans-C2O4 donor set.

There are signiﬁcant deviations from planarity in the 2-methyl- 3,5-dinitrobenzoate ligand with the carboxylate residue being twisted out of the plane deﬁned by the phenyl group as seen in the value of the O1–C1–C2–C3 torsion angle of 33.6(5). Similarly, the nitro groups are twisted out of the plane of the phenyl ring to which they are connected, in particular the N2-nitro group; the values of the O3–N1– C4–C3 and O5–N2–C6–C5 torsion angles are 12.9(6) and -33.4(6), respectively. As mentioned above, the 2-methyl-3,5-dinitrobenzoate ligand is bidentate bridging. The bridge is symmetric with the Sn–O1,O2i distances differing by less than 0.04 A˚ ; symmetry operation i: -1 ? x, y, z. The symmetric mode of bridging is reﬂected in the experimental equivalence of the associated C1–O1,2 bond distances, Table 2. Polymeric Structure The bridging mode of the carboxylate ligand generates a polymeric chain as shown in the views of Fig. 2. The topol- ogy of the chain is linear and features a sequence of eight- membered {SnOCO}2 rings connected at the pivotal tin atoms. To a ﬁrst approximation, the shape of the ring of an elongated chair where the tin atoms lie above and below the approximate plane deﬁned by the two carboxylate residues. Additional stability to the chains are afforded by a combi- nation of C–Hp [14] and N–Op [15] interactions. The C–Hp interactions occur between a methyl-H and the ring centroid of the phenyl ring [C8–H8aCg(C2–C7)ii=2.90 A˚ , C8Cg(C2–C7)ii=3.804(4) A˚ with the angle at H8a being 158 for ii: 1 ? x, y, z]. The closest N–Op interaction occurs between the N1-nitro group and the ring centroid of the phenyl ring [N1–O4Cg(C2–C7)i=3.428(4) A˚ , N1Cg (C2–C7)i = 3.610(4) A˚ with the angle at O4 being 88.8(3)]. In terms of global crystal packing, the chains are aligned along the a axis and pack as shown in Fig. 3, there being no speciﬁc intermolecular interactions between the chains. Discussion As noted in the Introduction, molecules conforming to the general formula R2Sn(O2CR0)2 generally adopt a skew-trap- ezoidal bipyramidal motif with variations manifested in the length of the weaker SnO interactions and deviations from planarity in the skewed trapezoidal plane. There appear to be two exceptions to this common structural motif in the litera- ture. A zero-dimensional structure is observed for binuclear and centrosymmetric (CF3COO)2MeSnC(SiMe3)2SiMe2CH2 CH2Me2Si(Me3Si)2CSnMe(OCOCF3)2 (2) [16]. Here, the carboxylate ligands are almost orthogonal to each other as opposed to their coplanarity in the common motif. As judged from the molecular formula, there is signiﬁcant steric pressure proximate to the tin atom and it is well known that steric hindrance plays a key role in determining molecular geometry in organotin carboxylates [17, 18], especially its inﬂuence upon weaker Sn–donor atom inter- actions. It is likely that ‘‘steric effects’’ is the reason for the adoption of a distinct structural motif for (2). The third motif in the literature represents a precedent to the structure reported herein for (1). Hence, a polymeric chain featuring {SnOCO}2 rings is found in the structure of n-Bu2Sn(2,3,4, 5-tetraﬂuorobenzoato)2 (3) [19].

The most common form has both strongly bound oxygen atoms adjacent to each other and the two carboxylate ligands are approximately coplanar. The variation leading to the second zero dimensional form is the geometric relationship between the carboxylate ligands, that is, they are now approximately orthogonal. The third motif, now observed twice in (1) and (3) [19], has the strongly bound oxygen atoms on opposite sides of the molecule and the second oxygen atom of each carboxylate ligand is bridging. Interestingly, the disparity in the Sn–O bond distances in the skew-trapezoidal bipyramidal structures (approxi- mately 2.1 vs. 2.5 A˚ [2]) no longer pertains in the polymer form where the average Sn–O bond distance is within the former extremes, that is 2.2 A˚ . The common features of polymeric structures (1) and (3) relate to the presence of tin-bound n-butyl groups and aryl carboxylate ligands. However, in the literature [6], there are over 30 examples of R2Sn(O2CR0)2 structures that possess both tin-bound n-butyl groups and aryl carboxylate ligands, and yet adopt the common motif. Clearly, another factor(s) comes into play when determining the structure adopted in the solid state. Conclusions The present report of the polymeric structure of (1) rep- resents a rare structural motif for R2Sn(O2CR0)2. While new structural forms for organotin carboxylates still appear from time to time [20], even if most of the new organotin carboxylate structures reported each year conform to lit- erature precedents, the challenge remains to rationalize the appearance of rare structural motifs.
