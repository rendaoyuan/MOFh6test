Manuscript Journal of Chemical Crystallography, Vol. 35, No. 6, June 2005 ( C⃝2005) DOI: 10.1007/s10870-005-2398-y Crystal structures of two polymeric 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate-coordinated transition metal complexes Li Wang,(1) Xiao-Lan Yu,(1) Jiwen Cai,(1)∗and Jin-Wang Huang(1) Received July 26, 2004; accepted December 21, 2004 Two 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate(1,5-nds)-coordinated polymeric complexes [Cu(1,5-nds) (H2O)4]n and [Cd(1,5-nds)(H2O)2]n were synthesized and their structures characterized by single-crystal structure analysis. The Cu(II) complex [Cu(1,5-nds)(H2O)4]n is obtained both from CuCl or CuCl2 reacting with 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonic acid at 80◦C. It is a one-dimensional polymer in which Cu(II) is coordinated by four water molecules and two sulfonate oxygen atoms in the trans positions. The interaction between sulfonate and Cu(II) is different in complexes obtained from different reaction temperature. While the three-dimensional Cd(II) complex [Cd(1,5-nds)(H2O)2]n is a polymorph of the reported two-dimensional layer structure, in which Cd(II) is coordinated by two water molecules in the trans positions and four different sulfonate groups, the same as that observed in the two- dimensional polymorph. However, the 1,5-nds ligands connect Cd(II) centers belonging to different layers, resulting in the three-dimensional framework. KEY WORDS: 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate; coordination chemistry; copper(II); cadmium(II); polymorph. Introduction We1 and others2,3 have been interested in investigating the solid state structures of transi- tion metal arenesulfonates. Due to the weak co- ordination nature, the IR spectra of the coordi- nated and noncoordinated sulfonate groups do not have any characteristic discrepancy,4 and single- crystal structural analysis remains the only tool to investigate the solid state structure of metal sulfonates. 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate (1,5-nds) has been employed as a ligand with multiple bind- (1) School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, People’s Republic of China. ∗To whom correspondence should be addressed; e-mail: puscjw@ zsu.edu.cn. ing sites available to construct coordination poly- mers with variant dimensionalities. Among the metal 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonates isolated from aqueous solution, three-dimensional networks are found in the lithium(I), sodium(I), potassium(I), strontium(II) and barium(II) 1,5-naphthalenedi- sulfonates,4 two-dimensional networks are found in the calcium(II)4 and cadmium(II) 1,5-naphtha- lenedisulfonates.5 While in the case of other diva- lent transition metal cations, such as copper(II),6 nickel(II),7 cobalt(II),8 and magnesium(II)4 salts, the metal cations are six-aqua-coordinated, with 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate behaving as a counter ion, forming extensive hydrogen-bonding inter- action with the coordinated water molecules. In all of these compounds with metal-sulfonate in- teraction, both the sulfonate groups have the 481 1074-1542/05/0600-0481/0 C⃝2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 482 Wang, Yu, Cai, and Huang same coordination environment and the 1,5- naphthalenedisulfonate ligand coordinates in a symmetric way. Here, we report another unique coordi- nation mode observed in the copper(II) 1,5- naphthalenedisulfonate obtained both from CuCl or CuCl2 reacting with 1,5-naphthalenesulfonic acid at elevated temperature, in which only one of the ---SO3 group is coordinated to the metal center as η2µ2 bridging. The three-dimensional polymorph of the two-dimensional layer complex [Cd(1,5nds)(H2O)2]n5,9 is also characterized. Experimental General All reagents were commercially available and used as received.

Absorption correction was applied by SADABS.10 Space groups were determined from systematic absences and further justiﬁed by the results of reﬁnement. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned using full-matrix least-squares/difference Fourier techniques using SHELXTL.11 All non-hydrogen atoms were re- ﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters. After that, all hydrogen atoms attached to C were placed at idealized positions and reﬁned as riding atoms with the relative isotropic parameters of the heavy atoms to which they are attached. Hydrogen atoms of the water molecules were located from the difference Fourier map during the ﬁnal steps of reﬁnement and reﬁned isotropically. Selected bond lengths and hydrogen bonds data are listed in Table 2. Results and discussion In [Cu(1,5-nds)(H2O)4]n, one ---SO3 group coordinates as a η2µ2 ligand to two different [Cu(H2O)4]+ ions in syn/anti fashion, resulting in a one-dimensional structure shown in Fig. 1(a). The coordination distance for the sulfonate group is Cu---O = 2.3369(11) and 2.4491(11) ˚A. The one-dimensional chains are linked via exten- sive and strong hydrogen bonds formed be- tween the free ---SO3 groups and the coordi- nated water molecules, resulting in an extended two-dimensional network similar to that observed for the coordinated two-dimensional network, as shown in Fig. 1(b). We have reported that Copper(II) 1,5- naphthelenedisulfonate isolated from aqueous solution at room temperature was identi- ﬁed as the aqua-coordinated metal complex [Cu(H2O)6](1,5nds)by X-ray single-crystalstruc- ture analysis.6 When copper(I) salt was used and the reaction was carried out at elevated temperature, the one-dimensional coordination polymer [Cu(1,5-nds)(H2O)4]n is obtained. Ob- viously, during the reaction process Cu(I) was oxidized. Interestingly, when CuCl2 and 1,5- naphthalenedisulfonic acid were reﬂuxed at 80◦C, Table 2.

This observation sug- gests that the interaction between sulfonate and Cu(II) can be changed by temperature. Such kind of temperature-tunable coordination behav- ior has never been reported before for sul- fonate. Furthermore, PXRD analysis shows that the product obtained at room temperature is 484 Wang, Yu, Cai, and Huang Fig. 1. (a) The one-dimensional polymeric [Cu(1,5-nds)(H2O)4]n.

When the reaction is carried out at 0◦C, only phase [Cu(H2O)6](1,5nds) is observed, as shown in Fig. 2. Finally, when [Cu(H2O)6](1,5nds) was heated gradually, phase [Cu(1,5-nds)(H2O)4]n, characterized by the diffraction peak at 7.7◦, dis- appeared gradually and the transition was com- pleted at around 58◦C, as shown in Fig. 4. The two-dimensional layered compound [Cd(1,5nds)(H2O)2]n5 which adopts the same arrangement as that of [Ca(1,5nds)(H2O)2]n,4 and can absorb amine vapors selectively,9 has been reported by us. In the two-dimensional structure,5 the Cd(II) cation is coordinated by four ---SO3−groups, with Cd---O distances ranging from 2.250(3) to 2.342(2) ˚A, and two water molecules. Each ---SO3−group behaves as a η2µ2 ligand bridging two Cd(II) ions, construct- ing a two-dimensional network with alternating organic-inorganic components, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The layers are connected by hydrogen bonds formed between the coordinated water molecules and the sulfonate group. Interestingly, [Cd(1,5nds)(H2O)2]n is isolated as a three- dimensional polymorph from a basic aqueous 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate-coordinated transition metal complexes 485 Fig. 2. PXRD of copper(II) 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate ob- tained from different reaction temperature, in comparison with the simulated PXRD pattern from single-crystal struc- tures of [Cu(1,5-nds)(H2O)4]n and [Cu(H2O)6](1,5-nds). media. The coordination geometries around the Cd2+ ion, as well as the coordination mode of the 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate anion are the same in these two polymorphs. However, the three- dimensional polymorph crystallizes in a different space group with different arrangement. Both the Cd(II) cation and 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate ion are located on the inversion centers and there is only one independent ---SO3−group presented in Fig. 3. PXRD of copper(II) 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate ob- tained at room temperature. The appearance of the char- acteristic peaks at 6.6◦for [Cu(H2O)6](1,5-nds) and 7.7◦for [Cu(1,5-nds)(H2O)4]n indicates that the product is composed by these two different phases. Fig. 4.

Hydrogen bonds formed by the coordinated water molecules and the sulfonate group are also observed. However, the 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate anions connect Cd(II) cations belonging to different layers, thus resulting in a three-dimensional framework similar to that observed in the alkali and alkaline earth metal analogs, as shown in Fig. 5(b). In summary, the solid state structures of two novel divalent transition metal 1,5-naphthal- enedisulfonates isolated from aqueous solution have been represented. The unsymmetrical coor- dination mode of 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate an- ion observed in [Cu(1,5-nds)(H2O)4]n is quite unusual and only observed once in the amine- sulfonate mixed ligands dinuclear complex [Cd(cyclam)(1,5nds)]2.5 It is remarkable that the coordination behavior of sulfonate toward Cu(II) is different in complexes obtained from differ- ent temperature. On the other hand, the fact that [Cd(1,5nds)(H2O)2]n displays two different coor- dination networks and crystallizes as polymorphs from different chemical environment further illus- trates the ﬂexible and rich coordination chemistry possessed by sulfonates, a conclusion we have established from the previous investigations.4–8 486 Wang, Yu, Cai, and Huang Fig. 5.
