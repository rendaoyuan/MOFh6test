Selective sorption of oxygen and nitric oxide by an electron-donating ﬂexible porous coordination polymer Satoru Shimomura1, Masakazu Higuchi2, Ryotaro Matsuda3,4, Ko Yoneda1, Yuh Hijikata1, Yoshiki Kubota2,5, Yoshimi Mita6, Jungeun Kim7, Masaki Takata2,7 and Susumu Kitagawa1,2,3,4* Porous coordination polymers are materials formed from metal ions that are bridged together by organic linkers and that can combine two seemingly contradictory properties—crystallinity and ﬂexibility. Porous coordination polymers can therefore create highly regular yet dynamic nanoporous domains that are particularly promising for sorption applications. Here, we describe the effective selective sorption of dioxygen and nitric oxide by a structurally and electronically dynamic porous coordination polymer built from zinc centres and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as a linker. In contrast to a variety of other gas molecules (C2H2, Ar, CO2, N2 and CO), O2 and NO are accommodated in its pores. This unprecedented preference arises from the concerted effect of the charge-transfer interaction between TCNQ and these guests, and the switchable gate opening and closing of the pores of the framework. This system provides further insight into the efﬁcient recognition of small gas molecules. T he recognition and selective sorption of gas molecules by porous materials are crucial challenges in environmental and industrial ﬁelds, and are fascinating subjects for scientiﬁc study. High-efﬁciency separation of small gases such as CH4, C2H2, CO2, N2, O2 and NOx, without a large expenditure of energy, is becoming increasingly important from energetic and biological standpoints. Research has recently focused on enhancing the ability of porous materials to recognize particular molecules. This requires a good afﬁnity between the porous domain and the target molecule, as well as a way to prevent the absorption of other species. It is difﬁcult, however, to design structures having such properties, and prepare conventional porous materials that selectively absorb particular molecules. Porous coordination polymers (PCPs) or metal–organic frame- works (MOFs) have recently attracted attention as good candidates for this purpose1–9, because it should be possible to design frame- works to enable various kinds of host–guest interactions within their pores. In the nanoporous domain, one of the important methods by which an increase in the afﬁnity of a framework for par- ticular target molecules may be achieved (attaining selective accom- modation) is to alter the surface of the pores through functionalization of the building blocks10–14. In the mesoscopic domain (10–100 nm), a guest-responsive dynamic accommodation is also possible with ﬂexible frameworks. This structural ﬂexibility, causing the closed–open structural transformation, is the key factor in obtaining a ‘gated effect’, which enhances selectivity by responding to speciﬁc guest molecules. The framework can, for example, discriminate between guests according to their size, or weak host–guest interactions. Flexible crystalline porous materials, which we term soft porous crystals15, should provide an ideal sorp- tion system with highly selective recognition properties that enable the efﬁcient use of the porous domain for the selective storage of a particular target molecule. There has recently been a great deal of interest in the physisorption of gases by PCPs instead of conventional materials such as zeolites of activated carbons. For example, they have been investigated for the selective absorption of CH4 and CO2 (refs 16–18) and for tempera- ture-dependent gate sorption phenomena19. In many cases, with con- ventional porous materials, the selective gas sorption properties depend on the size and shape of the pores. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to achieve selectivity between molecules of similar shapes. In particu- lar, it is unusual for porous materials to distinguish O2 and NO from other small gas molecules20–28. Structural, physical and electronic par- ameters for the adsorbatemolecules considered inthisstudyare shown in Table 122,23,29. In particular, focusing on O2 as a target adsorbate molecule presents some difﬁculties because N2 has a similar shape, and Ar a similar size. In addition, CO2 is a good adsorbate for microporous and mesoporous materials because of its small kinetic diameter—that is, its smallest effective dimension, a parameter typi- cally used to characterize non-symmetrical adsorbates—and good afﬁ- nity for the adsorbent. It is, therefore, typically preferred over other guests, and there are only few examples of adsorbents that favour the uptake of O2 over that of CO2. Here, we report on a TCNQ-based PCP that shows an excellent uptake of O2 and NO over other small gases, and we characterize this behaviour. We show that this unusual selectivity arises from the combination of a charge-transfer interaction between these adsorbates and the TCNQ ligands, and the gate opening and closing of the pores. Results and discussion Structural transformation of the gate-opening properties to target molecules is a potential mechanism for selective accommodation20. 1Department of Synthetic Chemistry and Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Katsura, Kyoto 615-8510, Japan, 2RIKEN, SPring-8 Center, 1-1-1, Kouto, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, Hyogo 679-5148, Japan, 3ERATO Kitagawa Integrated Pores Project (Japan), Kyoto Research Park Building #3, Shimogyo-ku, Kyoto 600-8815, Japan, 4Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences, Kyoto University 69 Konoe-cho, Yoshida, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan, 5Department of Physical Science, Graduate School of Science, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka 599-8531, Japan, 6Division of Materials Physics, Department of Materials Engineering Science, Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Osaka 560-8531, Japan, 7Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute, 1-1-1, Kouto, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, Hyogo 679-5198, Japan. *e-mail: kitagawa@icems.kyoto-u.ac.jp ARTICLES PUBLISHED ONLINE: 6 JUNE 2010 | DOI: 10.1038/NCHEM.684 NATURE CHEMISTRY | VOL 2 | AUGUST 2010 | www.nature.com/naturechemistry 633 © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We have previously reported that [Zn(TCNQ–TCNQ)bpy] (1) has a ﬂexible three-dimensional structure constructed from Zn(II) centres and two ligands—4,4′-bipyridyl (bpy) and 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-p-quino- dimethane (TCNQ). N N N N TCNQ We have previously found that the TCNQ ligands form dimeric dianion units that interact with the guest molecules (Fig. 1), and that closed–open structural transformation accompanies the adsop- tion/desorption process30. These properties make 1 a good candi- date for selective separation, and we have shown that it effectively separates benzene from a benzene/cyclohexane mixture. As well as with the benzene molecule, the TCNQ–TCNQ dimers in 1 also form durable CH–p-type interactions with aromatic protons with a partial positive charge. Based on this afﬁnity, the frame- work of 1 shows host–guest complexations with several aromatic molecules, and these accommodating structures were detected by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. 2). The channels delimited by the TCNQ ligands—and therefore by the TCNQ– TCNQ dimers formed—are of the undulating form rather than straight, comprising an alternating arrangement of two types of tubes of large and small diameter, respectively. The aromatic mol- ecules are held by the two TCNQ–TCNQ dimers from both sides of the channel wall, and the aromatic protons are directed to the Table1 | List of physical and electronic parameters for the adsorbate molecules.

The distances between the pore walls perpendicular to the aromatic molecules also indicate that they are accommodated strongly in the channels with CH–p-type interactions and conﬁnement effects31. The electron-rich pore surfaces of 1 should also have a good afﬁ- nity for electron-accepting molecules. This tendency can be observed in the case of gas molecules. The sorption isotherms of several kinds of gas molecules were measured on the closed form 1 (Fig. 3). Only in the cases of O2 and NO did this compound show the sorption phenomena characteristic of the gate-type sorp- tion behaviour, that is, no uptake in the low-concentration region and an abrupt increase in adsorption after a speciﬁc (or threshold) concentration. This behaviour, based on the closed–open structural transformation, was detected by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis (Fig. 4). The XRPD patterns of the open form and closed form are distinctly different from one another. Le Bail analysis shows that the closed form has a different unit cell, with less sym- metry than that of the open form. Accompanying the accommo- dation of O2 and NO, the XRPD patterns changed from the closed form to new phases, which both showed almost the same unit cells as that of the open form with no guests within the pores (see Supplementary Information). The amounts of O2 (268 cm3 g21 at standard temperature and pressure) and NO (322 cm3 g21 at STP) adsorbed at saturation correspond to 7.5 and 9 molecules per formula of 1, respectively. In contrast, no sharp uptake over one molecule per formula was observed with any of the other gas molecules (N2, CO, CO2, C2H2 or Ar). In this phenomenon, the closed–open transition is important because the trigger for the transformation—the interaction between the host and guest—is the determinant factor for selectivity. The fact that the framework does not adsorb CO2 and C2H2 shows that the selectivity is not due to the quadrupole moment or polariz- ability of the guest molecules, factors that both have a strong effect on the dispersion force of the guest molecule. Comparing the adsorption of NO and CO, the fact that the framework adsorbs NO but not CO indicates that the selectivity is also not induced by the electric dipole moment of the guest molecules. Taken together, these observations seem to indicate that 1 recognizes and responds to some properties that are common to O2 and NO. We used a spectroscopic approach to try to determine the charged state of 1 and O2 in the sorption process. The stretching of the C;N bonds—the n(C;N) band in infrared spectra—is useful for assigning the charge state of the TCNQ ligand32,33. The spectrum of the empty framework exhibited n(C;N) bands at 2,192 and 2,138 cm21 and d(C–H) bands at 805 cm21, which are characteristics of the TCNQ–TCNQ dimer (Fig. 5). When the sample was exposed to an O2 atmosphere at 93 K for approximately 3 h the peaks of the n(C;N) bands shifted to 2,213 and 2,156 cm21. No shift was observed in the d(C–H) band at 805 cm21, however, which means that the TCNQ moieties remain in the form of dimers during the sorption process. The shift in the n(C;N) bands shows that TCNQ undergoes a change in electron density, with the bond order of C;N increasing to a triple bond.

No changes were observed in the d(C–H) band at 805 cm21 in the O2 sorption process, which indicates that the TCNQ moiety remains in its dimeric form. Deﬁnite peak shifts of the n(C;N) bands at 2,192 and 2,138 cm21 to 2,213 and 2,156 cm21, respectively, indicate a decrease in the conjugation of the TCNQ–TCNQ dimers.

The Raman spectrum of 1 under the O2 sorption condition con- ﬁrms this conclusion. The n(O¼O) stretch band, which is the index of the physical and chemical state of the O2 molecule, can be measured directly37–40. As the sorption of the 16O2 molecule pro- gressed, two peaks were observed: a sharp peak at 1,454 cm21 and a broad peak at 1,449 cm21 (Fig. 6). Both peaks disappeared follow- ing removal of the guest. The broad band (at 1,449 cm21) arises from the framework transformation accompanying the O2 sorption because this band was still observed when the framework the O2 atmosphere was changed from 16O2 to 18O2. However, the sharp band (at 1,454 cm21) was not observed under the 18O2 atmosphere. Considering that no other bands appeared around 1,550 cm21, characteristic of an O¼O stretch mode, the sharp band can be assigned to n(O¼O) stretching in the pore of 1. In published papers so far, the absorption of O2 molecules by microporous materials have typically resulted in interactions— even if weak in some cases—between the oxygen molecule and the surface of the pores. This ‘conﬁnement effect’ (refs. 41,42) leads to a slight blue shift (by ≏10 cm21) of the n(O¼O) stretching band of the O2 on adsorption. However, the absorption of O2 by 1 is different. The large red shift of the sharp n(O¼O) band by 100 cm21—in other words, the decrease in the bond order—is too large to be induced by the conﬁnement effect alone. Such decreases in the bond order of O2 are commonly caused by electron acceptance of the antibonding p*-orbitals. Here, comparison of the observed n(O¼O) band with the previously published peak positions of the n(O¼O) stretching in the various electronic states of oxygen suggests that the O2 molecules accommodated in 1 have a partial negative charge, and that no redox reaction with one-electron transfer is occuring43–45. This is direct evidence of the existence of a charge-transfer interaction between the framework and the O2 molecules and of the fact that they are in an unusual state arising from an electronic effect and a conﬁnement effect. We calculated the reduction energies of the gas molecules at MP2/6-311 þ G* level (the second-order Moller–Plesset with Basis Set 6-311 þ G*), which characterizes the electron acceptability of the molecules. O2 and NO have low reduction energies and good electron acceptability compared with the other gas molecules (Table 1). This electron acceptability plays a critical role in this system by distinguish- ing O2 and NO from other guest gas molecules. The cooperative effect of the acceptor guest and donor framework is important in this sorp- tion behaviour. Because of a partial charge delocalization, the frame- work is maintained over the adsorption/desorption cycle, demonstrating stability and recyclability. This is also corroborated by Raman spectroscopy. In conclusion, we have discovered that 1 shows selective recog- nition of O2 and NO molecules. This speciﬁc sorption ability is ascribed to the closed–open structural transformation triggered by the charge-transfer interaction between the host framework and the guest molecule. The key to this selectivity is a combination of the structural dynamics and electron-donating function of the fra- mework, which can be induced by the soft crystallinity and designa- bility of PCPs. PCPs therefore show promise as selective adsorption systems for small gas molecules. Methods Physical measurements. The infrared spectra were measured by an FTIR 6200 instrument (JASCO) with an infrared microscope (IRT-3000). The Raman study was carried out in a back-scattering geometry at temperatures between 300 and 90 K using LabRAM HR-800 apparatus (HORIBA). A 785-nm line laser was used for excitation source. Scattered light was detected using a Jobin–Yvon triple monochromator T64000 and a Jobin–Yvon Spex Spectrum-one CCD (charge- coupled device) system. Sorption measurements. The adsorption isotherms of several gas molecules were measured with BELSORP-CRYO (O2, N2, Ar, NO) and BELSORP-MAX (CO2, CO) volumetric adsorption equipment from Bel Japan and AUTOSORB-1 (C2H2) volumetric adsorption equipment from Quantachrome instruments. The host sample was obtained by treating under reduced pressure (,1 × 1022 Pa) at 398 K for more than 12 h. Each point in the adsorption isotherms has an error of +0.25%, which is caused by the resolution of the pressure gauge. XRPD experiments. XRPD patterns with good counting statistics were measured in a synchrotron radiation XRPD experiment using a large Debye–Scherrer camera and imaging plate as detectors on the BL02B2 beam line at the Super Photon Ring (SPring-8, Hyogo, Japan). The gas–vapour pressure control system was used to adjust the pressure of adsorbate. XRPD of 1 was measured under several atmospheres. The X-ray wavelength was 0.80235 Å (no guest) and 0.80130 Å (O2, NO). The lattice parameters for each state using the Le Bail method are as follows: (no guest) orthorhombic crystal system P222, a ¼ 22.015(2) Å, b ¼ 12.569(1) Å, c ¼ 15.815(2) Å, V ¼ 4,376.0(8) Å3, Rwp ¼ 0.01861.

The crystal structure was solved by a direct method (SHELX97) and refined by full-matrix least-squares refinement using the CRYSTALS computer program. The positions of non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement factors, except for the guest molecules. The hydrogen atoms were positioned geometrically and refined using a riding model. The void space of all compounds along the c axis is occupied by the disordered guest molecules. The case of 11,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene, Due to the disorder of the guest molecules, U(eq) of the some atoms of guest molecules are underestimated. The other alerts derive from the disordered guest molecules which could not be completely decided the positions. CCDC 753567 - 753570 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. Theoretical approach The total stabilization energy depending on the distance between one TCNQ dimer and single gas molecules have been calculated at MP2/6-311+G* level. However NO shows a higher affinity for TCNQ dimer than the other gas molecules, we cannot get the results suggesting the primacy of O2 over the other molecules and supporting the experimental results. These results imply the selective sorption of this compound should not be based on the interaction between single TCNQ dimer and single gas molecules but the other mechanism, such as the interaction between TCNQ dimers and aggregated gas molecules. Relatively high gate opening pressure of O2 sorption isotherm is consistent with this assumption. About the sorption measurements and the isotherms of 1 The measurement method is as below: Measurer decides recorded points with an introduction pressure (Pi) of an adsorptive. Pi of an adsorptive is introduced into the cell and then it will achieve an equilibrium pressure (Pe). When the pressure change is less than 0.2 % of P1 during 1200 sec, Pe is determined. Then, the adsorption amount (A) are calculated and Pe and A are recorded. In this one cycle, there is no additional vapor-dosing of an adsorptive into the cell. The compound we have is a sort of soft crystal, which responds to guest molecules and change its structure on the sorption. Therefore, this is not the case that robust framework adsorbs guests without any structural changes. The guest incorporation induce structural changes, therefore, the guest-sorption comprises of kinetic phenomena. This is well-discussed in published papers.1,2 In the transformable porous system, it is difficult to obtain the isotherm in the finite duration of experiments because of the complex kinetic process in which guest accommodation and © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We reported that the gated sorption phenomena strongly depend on the kinetics of transformation. In the transformable porous system, it is difficult to obtain the isotherm in the finite duration of experiments because of the complex kinetic process in which guest accommodation and structural transformation proceed simultaneously. We reported that the gated sorption phenomena strongly depend on the kinetics of transformation.3 Figure S3 shows the O2 adsorption curve and time dependent pressure change of this compound. The first pronounced decrease of pressure has been observed between point 4 and 5. Due to the kinetic effects of gate opening process with structural transformation, the rate of pressure decrease between point 4 and 5 is slower than the rate after point 5. In the results, we get the adsorption curve with the backward movement like Figure S2. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
