China Abstract Two 3D multifunctional lanthanide metal-organic frameworks(MOFs), Pr(HTCPS)(H2O)·2DMF·C2H5OH· 5H2O(JUC-93) and Pr3(TCPS)2(NO3)(H2O)4(DMA)2·2DMA·C2H5OH·3H2O(JUC-94)[H4TCPS=tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)- silane, DMF=N,N′-dimethylformamide, DMA=N,N′-dimethylacetamide and JUC=Jilin University China] were synthe- sized by the self-assembly of a rigid silicon-centered tetrahedral carboxylate ligand H4TCPS and Pr(III) ions in different solvothermal reactions. X-Ray crystallography revealed that they exhibited a rare CaF2 topology framework, constructed from the 4-connected tetrahedral TCPS unit with the 8-connected dinuclear praseodymium cluster unit and trinuclear praseodymium cluster unit, respectively. In addition, the luminescent and magnetic properties of the two compounds were investigated. Keywords Metal-organic framework; Tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)silane; CaF2 topology; Magnetic property; Fluores- cence 1 Introduction In recent years, metal-organic frameworks(MOFs) formed via the assembly of suitable metal salts with designed organic ligands have attracted wide attention for their variety of poten- tial applications and interesting architectures[1―6]. It is impor- tant to understand the topological aspects of such materials at a molecular or an atomic resolution based on recent reviews on the topological analysis and other geometrical characteristics of MOFs[7―12]. As we know, MOFs are generally made up of two multidentate components: metallic units connected by organic bridges[13―15]. To date, many topological types of natural minerals have been artificially produced by replacing monoa- tomic anions(O2–, S2–) with polyatomic organic ligands as linkers and utilizing the well-defined coordination geometries of metal centers as nodes, such as diamond, quartz, rutile, perovskite, PtS, feldspar, and so on[16―20]. Owing to the severely limited coordination numbers of metal centers and the steric hindrance of most commonly used organic ligands, three-, four- and six-connected topologies are commonly observed[21―26], while five-, seven- and eight-connected MOFs are comparatively rare[27―30], which is a challenging of coordi- nation chemistry. Meanwhile, rare earth metals, as functional metal centers, are attracting more and more attention from syn- thesis chemists for their fantastic coordination properties and special chemical characteristics arised from 4f electrons[31―33]. The reported lanthanide-based MOFs possess beautiful and interesting topological structures, such as 1D chains[34,35], 2D layers[36], 3D porous and interpenetrating frameworks[37,38], and have potential application in ﬂuorescent probes, light-emitting diodes and conversion or ampliﬁcation of light[39―41]. Recently, our group has developed a new species of covalently-linked porous metallic organic hybrid frameworks, poly(p-tetraphenylene)silane(PAF-3) and poly(p-tetrapheny- lene)germane(PAF-4), which obviously influenced the gas sto- rage ability compared with PAF-1, because of the introduction of Si and Ge moieties[42]. Taking these into account, we expected to prepare some higher connected MOFs from the silicon-centered tetrahedral carboxylic ligand[43―47] with rare earth metals. Herein, we described two novel three-dimensional compounds Pr(HTCPS)(H2O)·2DMF·C2H5OH·5H2O(JUC-93) and Pr3(TCPS)2(NO3)(H2O)4(DMA)2·2DMA·C2H5OH·3H2O (JUC-94)[H4TCPS=tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)silane, DMF= N,N′-dimethylformamide, DMA=N,N′-dimethylacetamide and JUC=Jilin University China] possessing the same (4,8)- connected CaF2 topology. Furthermore, the thermal stability, luminescent and magnetic properties of compounds JUC-93 and JUC-94 were investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 General Characterization and Physical Mea- surements All chemicals were of reagent grade or better and used without further purification. Praseodymium(III) perchlorate [Pr(ClO4)3] was prepared via the dissolution of praseodymium 612 Chem. Res. Chin. Univ. Vol.29 oxide in perchloric acid, followed by adding H2O. Then the mixture was heated at 80 °C for 12 h to form a light green solu- tion, and excess black praseodymium oxide was filtered. The elemental analyses were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. The infrared(IR) spectra were recorded (400―4000 cm–1 region) on a Nicolet Impact 410 FTIR spec- trometer via KBr pellets. Thermal gravimetric analyses(TGA) were performed under oxygen at a heating rate of 5 °C/min on a Perkin-Elmer TGA 7 thermogravimetric analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction(PXRD) data were collected on a Siemens D5005 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation(λ=0.15418 nm). Fluorescence spectroscopy data were recorded on an LS55 luminescence spectrometer. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility data were obtained on a Quantum Design MPMSXL SQUID magnetometer under an applied field of 0.1 T in a temperature range of 2―300 K. 2.2 Synthesis Synthesis of Pr(HTCPS)(H2O)·2DMF·C2H5OH·5H2O (JUC-93) was performed as follows. A mixture of Pr(ClO4)3 [0.2 mmol/mL(0.1 mL, 0.02 mmol)] and H4TCPS(25 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in DMF/EtOH/H2O(3:3:2, volume ratio). The mixture was sealed in a screw-capped vial heated at 100 °C for 3 d. The light green crystals were collected. Yield: 72% (based on Pr). Elemental anal.(%) calcd. for C36H49N2O17SiPr (950.78): C 45.48, H 5.19, N 2.95; found: C 45.28, H 5.06, N 3.00. Synthesis of Pr3(TCPS)2(NO3)(H2O)4(DMA)2·2DMA· C2H5OH·3H2O(JUC-94) was carried out as follows. A mixture of Pr(ClO4)3[0.2 mmol/mL(0.1 mL, 0.02 mmol)] and H4TCPS (25 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in DMA/EtOH/H2O(3:3:2, volume ratio) followed by the addition of 0.1 mL of HNO3 (2 mol/L). The mixture was sealed in a screw-capped vial heated at 100 °C for 3 d. The light green crystals were collected. Yield: 68%(based on Pr). Elemental anal.(%) calcd. for C74H88N5O31Si2Pr3(2022.42): C 43.93, H 4.39, N 3.46; found: C 43.35, H 4.10, N 3.34. 2.3 X-Ray Crystallography Diffraction intensities for compounds JUC-93 and JUC-94 were collected at 293 K on a computer-controlled Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer equipped with graphite- monochromated Mo Kα(λ=0.071073 nm) radiation via the ω-scan technique. The structures were solved by direct method and refined with the full-matrix least-squares technique by means of the SHELXS-97[48] and SHELXL-97[49] programs, respectively. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropi- cally. All the H atoms were placed geometrically. The sol- vent-accessible volume was assessed via the PLATON soft- ware[50] and the contribution of the disordered solvent to the diffraction pattern of compound JUC-93 was subtracted from the observed data by the “SQUEEZE” method as implemented in PLATON[51]. The SQUEEZE-bypass method referred to therein is widely used in crystallographic analysis of com- pounds containing substantial amounts of disordered solvent that cannot be located precisely from diffraction data. The crystallographic data of compounds JUC-93 and JUC-94 are summarized in Table 1. The selected bond lengths are listed in Tables 2 and 3.

Compound JUC-93 was prepared via the reaction between Pr(ClO4)3 and H4TCPS by a solvo- thermal method in a mixture of DMF, H2O and C2H5OH at No.4 LI Yang-xue et al. 613 100 °C for 3 d. Compound JUC-94 was synthesized from the reaction between Pr(ClO4)3 and H4TCPS in a mixture of DMA, H2O and C2H5OH at 100 °C for 3 d. The crystallographic re- sults reveal that compounds JUC-93 and JUC-94 have different structural motifs, but possess the same (4,8)-connected CaF2 topology. 3.2 Crystal Structures 3.2.1 Structure of Pr(HTCPS)(H2O)·2DMF·C2H5OH· 5H2O(JUC-93) X-Ray crystallography reveals that compound JUC-93 crystallized in the monoclinic system, with space group C2/c. The fundamental building unit of compound JUC-93 contains two crystallographically equivalent nine-coordinated rare earth ion(Pr3+), eight TCPS ligands and two coordinating H2O mole- cules[Fig.1(A)]. The Pr1 center is coordinated with four oxygen atoms(O1, O2, O3 and O4) from two chelating bidentate car- boxylate groups, three oxygen atom(O5, O6 and O6A) from two chelating/bridging bidentate carboxylate group, one oxy- gen atom(O8) from one unidentate carboxylate group and one oxygen atom(O9) from a terminal water molecule. The carbo- xylic Pr―O bond distances range in 0.2332(6)―0.2725(5) nm and the bond length of Pr―Owt is 0.2496(5) nm. All of these are comparable to those reported for other rare earth metal coordination polymers[52]. Fig.1 Coordination environment of Pr3+ in compound JUC-93(A), representation of an edged-sharing inorganic secondary building unit(SBU) Pr2(CO2)8(H2O)2(B) and framework of compound JUC-93 with approximately 0.83 nm×0.50 nm channels viewed along [010] direction(C) Carefully examining the structure of compound JUC-93, we can ﬁnd that a pair of Pr3+ ion centers(Pr1 and Pr1A) are bridged through eight different carboxyl groups to form the Pr2(CO2)8(H2O)2 unit[Fig.1(B)]. The Pr2(CO2)8(H2O)2 unit is an 8-connected secondary building unit(SBU) that is deﬁned by the carboxylate carbon atoms[Fig.2(A)], while each TCPS unit that coordinates to four pairs of Pr3+ ions can act as a 4-connected tetrahedral SBU, which is deﬁned by the 4, 4′, 4′′ and 4′′′ carbon atoms[Fig.2(B)]. Extension of the coordination geometry around each 8-connected SBU and 4-connected SBU will therefore give a 3D porous framework with CaF2 topology where Ca2+ is eight coordination and F– is in tetrahedral envi- ronment, and the Schläﬂi symbol is (412·612·84)(46)2 [Fig.2(C)]. There are open channels of approximately 0.83 nm×0.50 nm running along the [010] direction, and the channels of ap- proximately 0.98 nm×0.49 nm and 0.58 nm×0.32 nm along the [001] direction, respectively[Fig.1(C) and Fig.3]. After removal guest molecules, the effective free volume of compound JUC-93 was calculated by PLATON analysis to be 49.0% of the crystal volume(4.1554 nm3 out of the 8.4874 nm3 per unit cell volume).

Fig.3 Framework of compound JUC-93 with approximately 0.98 nm×0.49 nm and 0.58 nm×0.32 nm channels viewed along [001] direction 3.2.2 Structure of Pr3(TCPS)2(NO3)(H2O)4(DMA)2· 2DMA·C2H5OH·3H2O(JUC-94) The result of X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that compound JUC-94 is also 3D CaF2 topology constructed from Pr3(CO2)8(H2O)4(DMA)2(NO3) units and TCPS units, which crystallized in a triclinic space group P-1. In contrast to that of compound JUC-93, the fundamental building unit of compound JUC-94 contains one nine-coordinated rare earth ion(Pr2), two eight-coordinated rare ions(Pr1 and Pr3), eight TCPS ligands, four terminal water molecules, two terminal DMA molecules and one NO3 – ion[Fig.4(A)]. Pr1 is coordinated with eight oxygen atoms from four bidentate carboxyl groups(O1, O10, O11 and O14), one chelating/bridging bidentate carboxylate group(O5), one chelating bidentate NO3 –(O17 and O18) and one terminal water molecule(O20). Nine oxygen atoms coordinating to Pr2 are from two bidentate carboxyl groups(O2 614 Chem. Res. Chin. Univ. Vol.29 and O12), one chelating/bridging bidentate carboxylate group (O5 and O6), one chelating bidentate carboxylate group(O3 and O4), two terminal water molecules(O21 and O22) and one ter- minal DMA molecule(O24). Pr3 is coordinated with four oxy- gen atoms from two different chelating bidentate carboxyl groups(O7, O8, O15 and O16), two oxygen atoms from two different bidentate carboxyl groups(O9 and O13), one terminal water molecule(O23) and one terminal DMA molecule(O25). The distances of Pr―O and Pr―Owt bonds are in the ranges of 0.2359(4)―0.2652(4) nm and 0.2558(4)―0.2564(4) nm, respectively, all of which are comparable to those reported for other praseodymium-oxygen donor metal coordination polymers.

The resulting structure of compound JUC-94 is a bimodal (4,8)- connected CaF2 net[Fig.5(C)] and its Schläﬂi symbol is (412·612·84)(46)2. There are open channels of approximately 0.46 nm×0.54 nm along the [100] direction[Fig.4(C)]. The effective free volume of compound JUC-94 was calculated by PLATON analysis to be 30.9% of the crystal volume(1.3599 nm3 out of the 4.4018 nm3 per unit cell volume) without guest molecules. 3.2.3 Topological Analyses of Compounds JUC-93 and JUC-94 The topological analysis of MOFs plays an instructive role in simplifying the complicated compounds, in order that we can get a better insight into the nature of compounds. As dis- cussed above, as an 8-connected node, each dinuclear praseo- dymium cluster in compound JUC-93 and each trinuclear pra- seodymium cluster in compound JUC-94 is coordinated with eight different TCPS ligands to replace Ca2+ ions in fluorite, and each TCPS coordinated to four different Pr3+ clusters as a 4-connected tetrahedral building block to replace F– ions in fluorite to give rise to the framework of a CaF2 topology which is one of the most important and preferred structure for AB2 type compounds finally. 3.3 Powder X-Ray Diffraction(PXRD) Measure- ment The PXRD patterns of compounds JUC-93 and JUC-94 are consistent with the results predicted from the single crystal crystallographic data, indicating that the obtained samples are pure phase(Fig.6). Furthermore, elemental analyses support the results of the PXRD analyses, and show that the samples are chemically pure. Fig.6 PXRD patterns for compounds JUC-93(A) and JUC-94(B) a.

No.4 LI Yang-xue et al. 615 3.4 Luminescent Properties Lanthanides can absorb ultraviolet radiation efficiently through an allowed electronic transition to convert to excited state, and these excited states are deactivated to the multiplet states radiatively via emission of visible radiation known as luminescence[53]. As shown in Fig.7, the solid-state photolumi- nesecent spectra of free H4TCPS ligand, compound JUC-93 and compound JUC-94 were obtained at room temperature. The free H4TCPS ligand revealed the strongest emission peak at 420 nm with the excitation peak at 276 nm. The emission band of the free ligand is attributed to the π*→n transitions. The strongest excitation peak of compound JUC-93 is at 320 nm with an emission band at 381 nm, and that of compound JUC-94 is at 315 nm with an emission band at 370 nm. Com- pared with free H4TCPS, compound JUC-93 and compound JUC-94 exhibit one blue-shifted emission band in a range of 350―500 nm, respectively, which are probably assigned to the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer(LMCT)[54]. Compounds JUC-93 and JUC-94 could be anticipated as potential fluores- cent materials.

For compound JUC-93, the observed value of χMT is 2.12 cm3·K·mol–1 at room temperature, and when decreases with temperature, the value of χMT decreases smoothly upon cooling and reaches to a mini- mum of 0.11 cm3·K·mol–1 at 2 K. The χM –1 versus T plot in the whole temperature range obeys the Curie-Weiss law[χ=C/(T–θ)] with C=2.44 cm3·K·mol–1 and θ = –47.49 K. The decrease of χMT and the negative value of θ indicate the antiferromagnetic interaction and stark sublevels depopulation between the Pr3+ ions[55]. The magnetic behavior of compound JUC-94 revealed that χMT increases with increasing temperature in the whole temperature range. At room temperature, χMT is 4.79 cm3·K·mol–1, and it achieves 0.23 cm3·K·mol–1 at 2 K. The plot of χM –1 versus T also obeys the Curie-Weiss law[χ=C/(T–θ)] with C=5.55 cm3·K·mol–1 and θ = –41.32 K. So compound JUC-94 also displays an antiferromagnetic interaction and stark sublevels depopulation between the Pr3+ ions. From the mag- netic results of compounds JUC-93 and JUC-94, the values of the Curie constant C are different, which could be ascribed to the different praseodymium clusters structures.

Meanwhile, compounds JUC-93 and JUC-94 exhibited antifer- romagnetic and fluorescent properties. Our further work is to synthesize some MOFs containing Ge atom. The Si atom or Ge atom introduced into the MOFs may have potential applications in conductive performance.
