Pentacoordinated Cu(II) zigzag polymeric chain of 1 is composed of linking the adjacent Cu(2,20-bpy)(H2O) units through terminal crab- oxylate oxygens of two different adipate dianion in cis coordination pattern with the metal center. Both the Complexes were crystallized in triclinic system, P-1 space group with cell parameters a = 6.8948(5), b = 10.7098(7), c = 12.4332(8) A˚ ; a = 82.1120(10), b = 80.4950(10), c = 72.9560(10), V = 861.87(10) A˚ 3 for 1, a = 9.5058(6), b = 9.9341(7), c = 12.6460(8) A˚ ; a = 70.5080(10), b = 73.5740(10), c = 75.0720(10), V = 1062.05(12) A˚ 3 for 2 respectively. Extensive hydrogen bonding interaction is observed between the lattice water molecules and the coor- dination network. Compound 2 is a layered architecture, where the neutral framework is constructed by two different adipate anions (in monoanionic and dianionic form) coordi- natingtothemetal center. Interestingly, three watermolecules present in the lattice of compound 2 are involved in hydrogen bonding network among themselves, creating a centro-sym- metric hexameric water cluster composed of a tetracyclic ring with dangling water molecules attached at alternate positions of the rectangle, which interact with the carboxylate oxygen, thereby extending the hydrogen bonded water network. Keywords Coordination polymer  Crystal structure  2,20-Bipyridyl  Hydrogen bonding interactions  Water cluster Introduction The study of self-assembled ﬁnite and inﬁnite metal-organic coordination networks is a very active interdisciplinary research area due to their potential applications in magnetics, optics, electronics, catalysis, and general guest–host inter- actions [1–13]. Typically, metal–organic networks consists of bridging the metal or metal-cluster nodes with simple multidentate organic-spacer ligands. The judicious choice of the metal ion and thorough understanding on the preferential coordination modes of the bridging ligand are the key steps for the rational design of metal-organic coordination frameworks. The versatile coordination modes and confor- mational ﬂexibility of the aliphatic dicarboxylic acid can generate different structural motifs [13–27]. We have initi- ated some work to understand the various structural motifs that can be created by using a,x-dicarboxylates by the adaptable mode of coordination of the carboxylate groups and various N-donor ligands with 3-d transition metals [28–31]. In this endeavor, to understand the supramolecular coordination motif by virtue of the versatile coordination geometry of copper (II) centers with adipic acid and 2,20-bpy ligands, two ternary Cu(II) coordination polymers [Cu(2,20- Bpy)(l-adipate-H2)(H2O)]n . 2.H2O, 1 and [Cu2(l-adipate- H)2(l-adipate-H2)1].3H2O, 2 have been synthesized by a simple one pot reaction.

Versatile coordination modes of carboxylate groups and its ability for various H-bonding interactions and the stacking interaction of the chelating heteroaromatic N-donor ligands play important roles in the crystal packing and offer more interesting supramolecular features in the solid state. Fur- ther, the presence of lattice water molecules in both the complexes and their involvement in hydrogen bonding interaction with the coordination network and the hexameric water cluster formation in compound 2 is interesting and noteworthy, even though the crystal structure has been reported by Zheng et.al by a different synthetic approach with a higher R-value compared to us. Experimental Section All commercially available chemicals are of reagent grade and were used as received. Elemental data were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 4100 elemental analyzer. IR spectra were recorded using KBr pellets (1% w/w) on a Perkin- Elmer Spectrum GX FT-IR spectrophotometer. Thermo gravimetric analysis (heating rate of 20 C/min) was per- formed using Mettler Toledo Star SW 7.01. X-ray Crystallography The crystallographic data and details of data collection for 1 and 2 are given in Table 1. In each case, a crystal of suitable size was selected from the mother liquor and immersed in paratone oil, then mounted on the tip of a glass ﬁber and cemented using epoxy resin. Intensity data for both the crystals were collected using MoKa (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) radiation on a Bruker SMART APEX diffractometer equipped with CCD area detector at 100 K. The data integration and reduction were processed with SAINT [32] software. An empirical absorption correction was applied to the collected reﬂections with SADABS [33] using XPREP [32]. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXTL [34] and were reﬁned on F2 by the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXL- 97 [35] program package. Graphics are generated using PLATON [36] and MERCURY 1.3 [37]. In both the compounds all non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned aniso- tropically till convergence is reached. Hydrogen atoms attached to the ligand moieties are sterochemically ﬁxed and the water hydrogens were located from the difference Fourier map reﬁned isotropically. CCDC-615240 and 615241 contain the supplementary crystallographic data in CIF format for both compounds reported in this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. Synthesis and Characterization of the Complexes To 2 mmol (0.536 g) of CuSO46H2O in 10 mL distilled water, 2,20-bipyridyl (2 mmol, 0.312 g) in 5 mL EtOH was added slowly with constant stirring till deep blue solution was obtained. To this solution, 2 mmol (0.292 g) of adipic acid dissolved in water was added and the pH of this solution was adjusted to 5. This solution was heated on a water bath at 80 C for 5 h and the hot solution was ﬁl- tered. The resulting solution kept at room temperature gave two types of crystals with different morphology (Pale blue plates appeared ﬁrst and dark blue blocks appeared later) after three to ﬁve days interval. Both types of crystals were unstable upon exposure to air for longer time and the X-ray data collection was carried out under LN temperature. Both the complexes obtained were characterized by Elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy and TGA Table 1 Summary of crystallographic data for complex 1 and 2 Identiﬁcation code Complex 1 Complex 2 Chemical formula C16H22N2O7Cu1 C19 H27 Cu N2 O9 Formula weight 417.90 490.97 Crystal colour Light blue Dark blue Crystal size (mm3) 0.22 9 0.14 9 0.08 042 9 0.34 9 0.30 Temperature (K) 100 100 Crystal system Triclinic Triclinic Space group P-1 P-1 a (A˚ ) 6.8948 (5) 9.5058 (6) b (A˚ ) 10.7098 (7) 9.9341 (7) c (A˚ ) 12.4332 (8) 12.6460 (8) a () 82.1120 (10) 70.5080 (10) b () 80.4950 (10) 73.5740 (10) c () 72.9560 (10) 75.0720 (10) Z 2 2 V (A˚ 3) 861.87 (10) 1062.05 (12) Density (Mg/m3) 1.610 1.535 Absorption coefﬁcient (mm-1) 1.310 1.082 F(000) 434 512 Reﬂections collected 7353 8959 Independent reﬂections 3878 [R(int) = 0.0144] 4759 [R(int) = 0.0159] Number of parameters 259 308 S (goodness of ﬁt) on F2 1.028 1.023 Final R1, wR2 (I [ 2r(I) 0.0252/0.0683 0.0256/0.0691 Weighted R1, wR2 (all data) 0.0261/0.0689 0.0265/0.0696 1088 J Chem Crystallogr (2010) 40:1087–1093 123 measurements.

Results and Discussions IR and TGA Results The presence of carboxylate group in complex 1 was conﬁrmed by sharp bands at 1578 cm-1(masym) and 1389 cm-1(msym). The difference between these two band (Doco = 189 cm-1) indicates monodentate coordination of the carboxylate group with strong H-bonding interaction. Broad band at 3350 cm-1 shows the presence of lattice water molecules. In the case of complex 2, strong bands at 1678 and 1446 cm-1 and 1555 and 1419 cm-1 can be attributed to masym and msym of the carboxylic acid and carboxylate coordination of hexanedioic acid respectively. The difference between the masym and msym bands for the carboxylic acid (232 cm-1) and carboxylate (136 cm-1) indicate the monodentate coordination of the carboxylate oxygens. The presence of three lattice water molecules are indicated by the broad bands at 3522–3403 cm-1. Thermal analysis of 1 shows that onset of water loss starts at about 40 C and complete loss of water takes place within 110 C. Total weight loss in this compound is -13.058% corresponds to three water molecules, which almost matches with two lattice waters and one weakly bound apical coordinated water as evident from the crys- tallographic studies. In the case of compound 2, the onset water loss starts at 20 C and complete loss of all the three lattice water molecules occurs at around 135 C with the weight loss of -10.58% complementing the presence of three lattice waters and low stability of the compound at room temperature. TGA curves for both the complexes 1 and 2 are deposited as supplementary material (Figs. S1 and S2). Crystal and Molecular Structure of Complex 1 ORTEP diagram depicting the neutral zigzag polymeric chain with atom numbering scheme is shown in Fig. 1. The copper (II) ion displays a distorted square pyramidal geometry with N2O3 coordination. The copper (II) ion is coordinated to both the bpy nitrogen, deprotonated oxygen atoms from two different dicarboxylic acid form- ing the square base (Cu(1)–O(1) = 1.9629(11) A˚ and Cu(1)–O(3) = 1.9824(10) A˚ ) and the water molecule at the axial position making a longer Cu–O coordination (Cu–O1w = 2.2600 A˚ ). The carboxylate oxygens from either ends of two different aliphatic acids (both acid ligands possess two-fold symmetry bisecting the middle of CH2– CH2 bond) makes cis coordination to the metal centers by monodentate fashion extending the inﬁnite one dimensional zigzag polymeric network.The torsion angles of the different dicarboxylate ligands bridging the adjacent metal centers clearly shows that one of them is in extended conformation where as the second one is in folded from with CuCu separation distance 11.569 A˚ and 9.551 A˚ respectively. Thus the cetrosymmetric adipate with extended conforma- tion makes torsion angles C14–C15–C16–C16 = 177.29, C15–C16–C16–C15 = 180, C16–C15–C14–O3 = 1.79, C16–C15–C14–O3 = 179.82 where as for the folded conformer the torsion angles are C11–C12–C13–C13 = 68.44, C12–C13–C13–C12 = 180, O1–C11–C12–C13 = -113.00, O2–C11–C12–C13 = 66.66 respectively. It is interesting to note that the torsion angles involving the car- boxylate oxygens of the extended conformer is making 180, whereas the terminal carboxylate oxygens of the folded ones are twisted to make 68 and the central (CH2)4 moiety of the folded one is making a torsion angle 180. The second oxygen O4 of the extended carboxylate group, involved in a long coordination contact with Cu(II) (Cu–O4 = 2.645 A˚ ) is noteworthy. Packing diagram of the compound viewed down a-axis (Fig. 2) clearly shows that the 2,20bpy moiety of the zigzag chains from either side makes effective pp face to face stacking from the bpy ligand coordinated to the Fig. 1 ORTEP diagram with atom numbering scheme depicting the neutral zigzag polymeric network of complex 1. 50% probability factor for thermal ellipsoids (hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity) J Chem Crystallogr (2010) 40:1087–1093 1089 123 neighboring chains creating large voids which is occupied by the water molecules. The pp stacking distance of the pyridyl rings the bpy ligands of the adjacent zigzag strand is Cg1Cg2 = 3.538 A˚ , where Cg1 and Cg2 are the centroids of the pyridyl rings N1–C1 to C5 and N2–C6 to C10 respectively. The presence of carboxylate group (O1, O2, O3 and O4) coordinated water molecule (O5) and lattice water mole- cules (O6 and O7) is involved in complex O–HO and C–HO interactions in stabilization of the molecule via H-bonded supramolecular network. The lattice water molecules are stabilized via strong intra and intermolecular O–HO and C–HO interactions. Thus, O6 acts as a donor and involved in intramolecular O–HO H-bonding with carboxylate oxygen O1(O6O1 = 2.8142(19) A˚ and \O6–H61..6 = 177 (4)) and intermolecular one with coordinated water O5 (O6O5 = 2.868(2) A˚ , O6–H62 O5 = 172(3)). Second lattice water O7 acts as a donor and makes intramolecular H-bonding with O3 (O7O3 = 2.9547(18) A˚ , \O7-H72O3 = 167(2)) and intermolec- ular O–HO H-bond with carboxylate oxygen O2 (O7O2 = 2.933(2) A˚ ,\O7–H71O2 = 161(3)). Further, O6 and O7 act as acceptors and involved in C–HO interac- tions with bipyridyl hydrogens H3 and H8 respectively. Intermolecular O–HO and C–HO interactionsof the lattice waters bridges the adjacent zigzag coordination polymeric matrix. Coordinated water is involved in intra and inter molecular O–HO contacts by donating hydrogens (H51 and H52) to O2 and O4 respectively. In addition to this, O4 is involved in intermolecular C–HO interaction with phenyl hydrogens H4 and H7 in connecting the neighboring strands. Details of all these H-bonding interactions and their symmetry code are given in Table 2, which eventually assemble a two- dimensional water induced hydrogen bonded network as depicted in Fig. 2. Crystal and Molecular Structure of Complex 2 Compound 2 crystallizes in triclinic system and space group P-1 as a layered coordination architecture shown in Fig. 3. The same compound was obtained by a different synthetic approach by Zheng et.al and the structure has been reported. [38] The crystal structure determined under LN temperature by us for the same compound obtained from the one pot reaction has been reﬁned to a much better R-value. In addition to the structural aspects of the layered compound our discussion is focused more elaborately on the interesting hexameric water cluster formation of the lattice water molecules and its interaction with the car- boxylate oxygens of the layered compound. Crystal struc- ture of 2 revealed that both mono and dianionic form of carboxylic acid is involved in bridging the Cu(II) metal Fig. 2 Packing diagram with hydrogen bonding interaction for 1 viewed down a-axis.

Crystal structure can be considered as two different strands of Cu (2,20-bpy) moieties, bridged via adipate mono-anion along b-axis and these aligned strands running in opposite direction are cross linked through adipate dianion diagonal to bc-plane, which posses a twofold symmetry bisecting the central CH2–CH2 bond. The CuCu separation within the Cu(2,20-bpy) strand linked via adipate mono-anion is 9.934 A˚ along b-axis while the CuCu separation between the neighboring Cu(2,20-bpy) strand cross-linked through dicarboxylate anion is 6.115 A˚ . It is interesting to note that the torsion angles involving the (CH2)4 chain is almost in extended conformation in both the mono and dianionic dicarboxylate ligands. However, the terminal carboxylate group symmetric dicarboxylate ligand is twisted severely to make effective coordination with the metal, which is reﬂected in the torsion angles (Torsion angles: C19–C18– C17–O5 = 79.09, C19–C18–C17–O6 = -98.54). In the case of monoadipate anion the carboxylate end is twisted making strong coordination with the metal whereas the carboxylic acid is in extended conformation making weaker apical coordination as indicated by the torsion angles (Torsion angles: C14–C15–C16–O3 = 133.01, C14–C15–C16–O4 = -47.34, C13–C12–C11–O1 = -171.47, C13–C12–C11–O2 = 8.60). Geometry around Cu(II) center is distorted square pyramidal N2O3 coordi- nation; bpy nitrogens N1, N2 and carboxylato oxygens O1 and O5 from mono, dianionic adipate ligand forming the square base and the ﬁfth axial coordination is provided by carboxylic acid O4 of the adipate monoanion. As expected, the carboxylate oxygen makes strong coordination with Cu (Cu(1)–O(5) = 1.9291(10), Cu(1)–O(1) = 1.9483(10) A˚ ) whereas the O4 of carboxylic acid makes much weaker coordination with the metal center (Cu(1)–O(4) = 2.3155(10) A˚ ). PLATON packing diagram of complex 2 viewed down a-axis depicting layers of coordination networks oriented along b-axis with hydrogen bonding interaction with the lattice water molecules (O7, O8 and O9) is shown in Fig. 4. The three lattice water molecules (O7, O8 and O9) are involved in strong O–HO interaction and assembled into a centrosymmetric discrete hexamer is depicted in Fig. 5. The hexamer has at its core a tetramer constituted by O8 and O9 in quasiplanar conformation with OO distances 2.785(2) and 2.790(2) A˚ . Additional water molecule O7 is attached at two diagonally opposite ends of the rectangle symmetrically at a distance of 2.755(2) A˚ . On the basis of the above OO distances, it would be appropriate to classify the cluster as hexamer rather than as a tetramer interacting with the terminal monomers at the alternate oxygen of the tetramer. Notably, the adjacent OO dis- tances in the hexameric unit is of the range 2.755–2.790 A˚ and can be compared well with that of Ih- and -Ic type ice (with OO distance 2.75 A˚ ; where, Ih and Ic denote hex- agonal and cubic ice, respectively), which suggests strong Fig. 3 ORTEP diagram depicting the layered coordination network with atom numbering scheme for complex 2. 60% probability factor for thermal ellipsoids (only H-atom attached to the carboxylic acid is shown, other hydrogens are omitted for clarity) Fig. 4 PLATON Packing viewed down a-axis showing the hydrogen bonding interactions in 2.

The geometrical parameters of the hydrogen bonds are given in Table 3. Theoretical calculations for the hexamer have revealed the existence of several energy minima corresponding to ‘‘ring’’, ‘‘book’’, ‘‘bag’’, ‘‘cage’’, and ‘‘prism’’ topologies which are almost isoenergetic within 0.7 kcal/mol [40–43]. The hexameric water cluster of the present investigation can be described as a cyclic tetramer connected by two acyclic monomers at two opposite ends (Fig. 5) and is very different from the (H2O)6 clusters reported previously [44, 45]. The central cyclic tetrameric unit is quasi-planar, similar to the one predicted theoretically [46–48] and found in several crystal hydrates [49, 50]. Packing diagram viewed down b-axis depicting the interaction of these water hexamers with the surrounding coordination polymeric matrix is depicted in Fig. 6. In the water hexamer hydrogen atoms H71 and H72 from the dangling oxygen O7 at opposite edges are anchored to carboxylate oxygen O6 (O7O6 = 2.872 and 2.752 A˚ ) of the layered coordination polymer extending into a hydro- gen bonded array of hexameric units along c-axis. Further, H92 from O9 is making intermolecular O–HO interaction with carboxylate oxygen O2 (O9O2 = 2.868(2) A˚ ) along b-axis and O8 acts as an acceptor in C–HO interaction with phenyl hydrogen H9 (C8O9 = 3.271(2) A˚ ) in anchoring the hexamer with different topology between the MOF layers. It is interesting to note that H3O hydrogen of carboxylic acid (attached to O3) is involved in O–HO interaction across the metal with O2 (O3O2 = 2.561(2) A˚ ) and the carboxylate oxygen O6 is making a C–HO bonding with phenyl hydrogen H4(C4O6 = 3.332(2) A˚ . Details of the various hydrogen bonding interactions with their symmetry code is given in Table 3.

Conclusion The versatile nature of coordination and conformational ﬂexibility of adipate anion is illustrated in constructing dif- ferent coordination polymers such as zigzag and layered network where the carboxylate ligand opted different anionic forms. In compound 1, the lattice water molecules are occu- pied within the void created by the orientation and alignment of the zigzag network via effective face to face pp stacking from the bpy ligand. Compound 2 is a layered coordination network and three lattice waters forms a discrete centrosym- metric water hexamer constituted by quasiplanar tertramer with monomeric waters attached on opposite edges. Inter- molecular H-bonding interaction between the water cluster with the carboxylate oxygen of the coordination polymer extends the water clusters into a one dimensional tape like arrangement along ac-plane in the coordination polymeric matrix. Extension of this work in creating different coordi- nation networks by the versatile coordination modes of the carboxylate group exploiting rigid and ﬂexible dicarboxylate ligands with different metal centers is in progress.
