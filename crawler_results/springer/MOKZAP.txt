Manuscript COMMUNICATION Synthesis, Crystal Structures and Properties of Two Metal–Organic Frameworks Constructed from Pyridine Dicarboxylate and Flexible Bis(imidazole) Ligand Yong-Hong Zhou Received: 7 April 2013 / Accepted: 15 June 2013 / Published online: 23 June 2013  Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013 Abstract Two novel interesting metal–organic frame- works, [Zn(PDA)(bbi)]n (1) and [Cd2(PDA)2(bbi)2(H2O)2 10H2O]n (2) [H2PDA = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, bbi = 1,10-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole)] have been iso- lated under hydrothermal conditions and structurally characterized. X-ray single crystal structure analysis reveals that complex 1 crystallize in monoclinic P21/c space group, while complex 2 crystallize in triclinic P-1 space group. The PDA2- anions act in two different coordination modes: terminal chelating for 1 and chelating and bis-monoatomic bridging for 2. Polymeric chains of 1 and 2 are composed of Zn(II) and Cd(II) ions bridged by bbi ligands. The ﬂuorescent properties of 1 and 2 were also investigated.

To date, a variety of MOFs have been constructed by taking certain factors into account, including the coordination nature of the metal ion and the ﬂexibility, sharp and functionality of the organic ligand [7, 8]. From the viewpoint of crystal engineering, the most effective approach may be the judi- cious selection of suitable ligands containing certain fea- tures, such as functionality and versatile binding modes [9– 11]. In particular, polycarboxylate ligands have been fre- quently employed in the construction of MOFs in posses- sion of multidimensional networks and functional properties [12–15]. As a very important carboxylate deriv- ative, pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (H2PDA) has gained much attention in coordination chemistry. It can contribute the pyridyl nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen atoms to metal ions, forming interesting network structures. A systematic study of complexes based on H2PDA has been undertaken, and it is found that PDA2- exhibits versatile binding and coordination motifs [16, 17]. Moreover, some coordination polymers with ﬂexible ligands have been investigated, and the results reveal that ﬂexible ligands can adopt different conformations accord- ing to the geometric needs of different metal ions, and this often causes structural diversity [18]. Based on its struc- ture, 1,10-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole) (bbi) can be used as a ﬂexible divergent ligand to construct coordination polymer materials [19, 20]. According to the above men- tioned points and to further investigate the inﬂuence of organic ligands on the coordination architectures, reactions of varied metal salts with H2PDA and bbi were carried out. Herein we report the synthesis, crystal structures and ﬂuorescent properties of two coordination polymers, [Zn(PDA)(bbi)]n (1) and [Cd2(PDA)2(bbi)2(H2O)2 10H2O]n (2). Y.-H.

Ligand bbi was synthesized as reported previously [21]. The C, H, and N microanalyses were carried out with a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. MALDI-TOF-Mass spectra for the solid samples were obtained using a Bruker Autoﬂex II spectrometer. The IR spectra were recorded on KBr discs on a Nicolet 170SX FT-IR spectrophotometer in the 4,000–400 cm-1 region. Luminescence spectra for the solid samples were acquired with a RF-5301PC ﬂuores- cence spectrophotometer. 2.2 Synthesis of [Zn(PDA)(bbi)]n (1) The mixture of Zn(CH3COO)22H2O (0.110 g, 0.5 mmol), H2PDA (0.084 g, 0.5 mmol), bbi (0.095 g, 0.5 mmol) and H2O (10.0 mL) was placed in a 25 mL Parr Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel and the pH was adjusted to 6.0 by addition of triethylamine. Then the vessel was sealed and heated at 120 C for 72 h. After the mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature, colorless crystals of 1 were obtained in 60 % yield.

All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were added theoretically and were riding on their parent atoms. The crystal parameters, data collection and reﬁnement results for compounds 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Description of the Structures 3.1.1 Structure of [Zn(PDA)(bbi)]n (1) Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that each asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Zn(II) ion, one bbi and one PDA2- anion. The central Zn(II) with distorted square pyramidal geometry is ﬁve-coordinated by two oxygen and one nitrogen atoms of one PDA2- and the other two nitro- gen atoms from two different bbi ligands (Fig. 1). The Zn–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.171(8)2.180(8) A˚ , the Zn-N bond lengths vary from 1.957(11) to 1.984(11) A˚ , all of which are comparable to those reported for other zinc- oxygen and zinc-nitrogen donor complexes [24]. The PDA2- acts as a terminal chelating ligand, meaning both carboxylate groups adopting l1–g1:g0-monodentate coor- dination mode (Scheme 1a). The salient structural feature of complex 1 is that each bbi ligand possesses trans confor- mation linking adjacent Zn(II) ions to form an inﬁnite 1D zigzag polymeric chain with ZnZn distance of 13.547 A˚ . The chains are decorated with PDA2- ligands alternately in an upper and down fashion (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that two pairs of imidazole rings from adjacent chains are almost parallel to each other, the cen- troid-to-centroid separations and dihedral angles are 3.676 and 1.9, 3.867 A˚ and 8.5, respectively. Therefore, such chains assembled by the pp stacking interactions between the imidazole rings form a 2D supramolecular network (Fig. 3).

This conﬁguration is similarly adopted by [Cd3(PDA)3(2,20-bipy)3(H2O)2]2H2O and [Cd4(cam)4(phen)4]4H2O (2,20-bipy = 2,20-bipyridine, H2cam = 4-hydroxypyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid hydrate, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) [25, 26]. Each Cd(II) center is seven-coordinated with three nitrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms from two bbi ligands, two PDA2- and one water molecule. PDA2- anionsare coordinated in onlyone way:one oxygen (O1) of the 2-carboxyl group and the nitrogen atom (N1) adopt bidentate chelate coordination mode to one Cd(II) center while one l2-O atom of the 6-carboxyl group adopts monoatomic bridging mode to two Cd(II) ions (Scheme 1b). So the PDA2- adopts both chelate and momoatomic bridging coordination modes to link two individual Cd(II) ions. Two adjacent Cd(II) ions together with two PDA2- and four bbi ligands construct a binuclear [Cd2(PDA)2(bbi)2] subunit with CdCd distance of 4.095 A˚ . Furthermore, adjacent binuclear units are joined together by bbi ligands to form a 1D double- chain structure with CdCd separation of 14.333 A˚ (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the O atoms of carboxyl group form C–HO hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen atoms of methylene. The CO distances range from 3.220 to 3.450 A˚ and the C–HO angles vary from 147.77 to 153.73. In addition, there are O–HO hydrogen bonds between the O atoms of the carboxyl groups and lattice water molecules, and between the O atoms of coordinated water and the O atoms of lattice water molecules with OO distances in the range of 2.638–3.200 A˚ (Table 3). These hydrogen bonds give rise to a 3D framework of complex 2 (Fig. 6). Undoubtedly, these hydrogen bonds play a critical role in the stabilization of the supramolecular network. 3.2 Luminescent Properties Coordination polymers with d10 metal centers have many potential applications such as photochemistry, electrolumi- nescent display and chemical sensors [27]. Therefore, in the present work, the photoluminescent properties of compounds Table 3 Selected hydrogen bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for 2 D–HA d(D–H) (A˚ ) d(HA) (A˚ ) d(D–A) (A˚ ) \D–HA () O5–H5BO4a 0.850 1.881 2.638 147.62 O5–H5CO6 0.850 2.179 3.003 163.32 O6–H6CO1 0.850 2.027 2.873 173.50 O7–H7CO5b 0.850 2.092 2.884 154.89 O7–H7DO4 0.850 2.121 2.913 155.02 O8–H8CO2c 0.850 1.866 2.695 164.52 O8–H8DO6d 0.850 2.368 3.200 165.93 C8–H8O2e 0.930 2.394 3.220 147.77 C10–H10O6f 0.930 2.594 3.450 153.49 a -x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z ? 1 b x, y - 1, z c x ? 1, y, z – 1 d x ? 1, y, z – 1 e 1 ? x, -1 ? y, z f 1 - x, -y, 1 - z Fig. 6 3D network formed by the intermolecular C–HO and O–HO hydrogen-bonding interactions J Inorg Organomet Polym (2013) 23:1189–1194 1193 123 1 and 2 were investigated in the solid state at room tempera- ture. Two emission peaks at about 395 (kex = 250 nm) and 366 nm (kex = 325 nm) were observed for free bbi and H2PDA[25].Theemissionbandsforthesefreeligandsmaybe attributed to the p* ? n or p* ? p transitions [28, 29]. On complexation of these ligands with Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions, intense ﬂuorescence emissions occur at 423 nm (kex = 340 nm) for 1 and 427 nm (kex = 340 nm) for 2 (Fig. 7). The absence of ligand-based emissions suggest energy transfer from the ligand to the Zn(II) and Cd(II) centers during pho- toluminescence. Thus, the photoluminescence can be attrib- uted to the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transitions [30]. 4 Conclusion In summary, two novel polymers with different architectures, [Zn(PDA)(bbi)]n (1) and [Cd2(PDA)2(bbi)2(H2O)210H2O]n (2) were constructed from the H2PDA ligand, in the presence of a ﬂexible bis(imidazole) compound used as space under mild hydrothermal conditions. This study demonstrates that the nature of ligands and the geometric needs of metal atoms play an important role in the crystal packing of MOFs. In addition, complexes 1 and 2 may be excellent candidates for blue-ﬂuorescent materials. References 1. J.J. Gassensmith, H. Furukawa, R.A. Smaldone, R.S. Forgan, Y.Y. Botros, O.M. Yaghi, J.F.
