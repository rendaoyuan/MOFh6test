Manuscript Journal of Chemical Crystallography, Vol. 35, No. 11, November 2005 ( C⃝2005) DOI: 10.1007/s10870-005-4556-7 First example of lanthanide coordination polymer of 2,5-pyrazinedicarboxylate Xiang-Jun Zheng(1) and Lin-Pei Jin(1)∗ Received January 15, 2005; accepted March 24, 2005 A lanthanum coordination polymer, [La(2,5-PZDC)1.5(H2O)]n, (2,5-PZDC = 2,5-pyra- zinedicarboxylate) has been synthesized by using the reaction of LaCl3·7H2O with 2,5- pyrazinedicarboxylic acid under hydrothermal condition and structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction method. It crystallizes in the triclinic system P ¯1 with a = 6.297(2) ˚A, b = 6.762(2) ˚A, c = 13.450(4) ˚A, α = 82.984(5)◦, β = 83.164(5)◦, γ = 63.260(4)◦, V = 506.3(3) ˚A3, Z = 2. The La3+ ion is nine-coordinate in a N2O7 environment, with a tricapped trigonal prism geometry, and the ligand 2,5-pyrazinedicarboxylate adopts two coordination modes, through which lanthanum ions are linked together to form a three- dimensional structure. KEY WORDS: Crystal structure; 2,5-pyrazinedicarboxylate; coordination polymer; lanthanum. Introduction The ﬁeld of coordination polymers has un- dergone an explosive growth since numerous one-, two-, and three-dimensional structures have been obtained.1–3 Much attention in this area has been focused on coordination polymers with mul- tifunctional ligands because the presence of dif- ferent functional groups allows for the incorpo- ration of interesting properties into the resulting coordination networks. Such network structures are generally neutral, which simpliﬁes the abil- ity to control their structures and increases the chances of obtaining porous solids.4 As is known, isomeric 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid and 2,5- pyrazinedicarboxylic acid are multifunctional lig- ands which can afford six coordination sites. 2,3- (1) Department of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China. ∗To whom correspondence should be adressed; e-mail: lpjin@ bnu.edu.cn. Pyrazinedicarboxylic acid is a widely used ligand. A number of structures of its coordination poly- mers with transition metal and lanthanides have been reported.5–11 While the coordination features of 2,5-PZDC have been much less investigated. As far as we aware, one vanadium (V) complex12 and one manganese (II) complex13 are the only structural characterized examples containing tran- sition metals and this ligand. However, up to now, no structural characterization of the lanthanide complexes of 2,5-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid has been reported. In light of the fact that lanthanide and d-block transition metal ions differ in their coordination number, 2,5-PZDC may coordinate with them in a different manner, resulting in a characteristic structure. As these complexes may have potential applications as new materials, we synthesized the lanthanide coordination polymer of 2,5-PZDC under hydrothermal condition. In the present work, we report on the crystal struc- ture of a coordination polymer of 2,5-PZDC with lanthanum. 865 1074-1542/05/1100-0865/0 C⃝2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 866 Zheng and Jin Experimental Materials and physical measurements LaCl3·7H2O was prepared by dissolving lan- thanum oxide in concentrated hydrochloric acid and the solvent was evaporated to dryness. All the other reagents were commercially available and used without further puriﬁcation. Elemen- tal analysis was obtained on an Elementar Vario EL analyzer. The IR spectrum was recorded with a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR spectrometer us- ing the KBr pellet technique. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed with a ZRY-2P Thermal Analyzer. Synthesis of [La(2,5-PZDC)1.5(H2O)]n A solution of LaCl3·7H2O (0.038 g, 0.1 mmol), 2,5-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid (0.016 g, 0.15 mmol), H2O (5.0 mL), and aqueous NaOH (0.44 mL, 0.29 mmol) was sealed in a 25-mL stainless steel reactor with Teﬂon liner and heated at 160◦C for 72 h. Colorless crystals were ob- tained. Yield: 15 mg (37%). Analysis calculated for C9H5LaN3O7: C 26.62, H 1.24, N 10.35; found: C 26.29, H 1.04, N 10.72%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3469 s, 2923 m, 1615 s, 1561 m, 1396 s, 1320 m, 1305 m, 1184 m, 1040 m, 830 w, 771 w, 521 w. X-ray crystallography The X-ray single-crystal data collection for the title complex was performed on a Bruker Smart 1000 CCD diffractometer, using graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 ˚A). Semiempirical absorption correc- tions were applied using the SADABS program. The structure was solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least square on F2 using the SHELXTL-97 program. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement pa- rameters. The hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically and treated by a mixture of inde- pendent and constrained reﬁnement. The crystal- lographic data, conditions for the collection of intensity data, and some features of the structure reﬁnements are listed in Table 1. Results and discussion Crystal structure An ORTEP drawing of the title complex with the atomic numbering scheme is shown in Fig. 1. The selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. The carboxylic group of the organic ligand in the title complex is deprotonated, in agreement with the IR spectrum, where no ab- sorption band around 1730 cm−1 for a protonated carboxylic group is observed. In the asymmetric unit, there is only one La3+ ion (Fig. 1). Around every La3+ ion, there are six 2,5-PZDC dianions and one coordinat- ing water molecule. The ligand 2,5-PZDC adopts two coordination modes. One is tetradentate with each carboxylate group bridging two La3+ ions in a syn–syn bidentate mode. The other is hex- adentate with each 2,5-PZDC coordinated to two La(III) atoms by means of one pyrazine N atom and one O atom from the adjacent carboxylate group, forming a ﬁve-membered chelate ring, and the two remaining O atoms from the two car- boxylate groups are also coordinated to another two La(III) ions in a monodentate fashion. The carboxylate groups show a syn–anti coordina- tion mode. In the crystal, there are three orienta- tions for 2,5-PZDC. For convenience, the ligands contain O1, O3, and O5 are deﬁned as PZDC1, PZDC2, and PZDC3, respectively. The dihedral angles between the pyrazine rings from PZDC3 and PZDC1, PZDC3, and PZDC2 are 84.6(2) and 87.3(2)◦, respectively, indicating PZDC3 is al- most perpendicular to PZDC1 and PZDC2. And PZDC1 is almost parallel to PZDC2 with a dihe- dral angle of 3.8(2)◦. PZDC1 adopts tetradentate coordination mode, while PZDC2 and PZDC3 both adopt hexadentate mode. The PZDC1 ligand is not coplanar, with a dihedral angle between the carboxylate groups and the aromatic ring of [La(2,5-PZDC)1.5(H2O)]n 867 Table 1.

However, the PZDC2 ligand is almost planar with a dihedral angle of 6.1(2)◦, and that for PZDC3 is 17.2(2)◦. The distance between two La(III) ions bridged by one carboxylate group of PZDC1, PZDC2, and PZDC3 ligand is 6.762(4), 6.297(4), and 6.299(4) ˚A, respectively. La3+ ion is nine coordinated with two nitrogen atoms (N3A, N2B) from two hexadentate ligands, and seven oxygen atoms, in which one from a water molecule (O7), two from two tetradentate ligand (O1, O2A) and four from four hexadentate ligand (O3, O4C, O5, O6A). La3+ ion is in a tricapped trigonal prism geometry. The average La---O and La---N distance is 2.540(4) and 2.763(5) ˚A, respectively (Table 1), which is in agreement with those found in poly{[aqualanthanum(III)-µ-2,3- pyrazinedicarboxylato]dihydrate}.11 The framework of the title complex is con- structed from a [La(2,5-PZDC)1.5(H2O)] building unit. Firstly, two PZDC3 ligands link two adjacent mononuclear units to form a binuclear unit each through one µ2-carboxylate. Then the binuclear unit is linked with another adjacent one through the bridging of two carboxylates from two PZDC1 ligands, forming a tetranuclear unit. The four nu- clei are just linked by the six coordination sites of one PZDC3 ligand. Thus the tetranuclear unit is the building block of the title complex. Along the 868 Zheng and Jin Fig. 1. Coordination environment of the title complex. The related coordination atoms and the asymmetric unit are la- beled out. All hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Ther- mal ellipsoids are shown at 30% probability. b-axis, the tetranuclear units are linked by PZDC3 and one carboxylate of PZDC1, while along the c-axis, the tetranuclear units are linked by whole PZDC1 ligand, forming a layer extended in the bc plane (Fig. 2). Along the a-axis, the layers are linked together through PZDC2 ligand, result- ing in a three-dimensional coordination polymer (Fig. 3). In the reported vanadium(V) complex,12 the central V(V) ion is ﬁve-coordinate. The VO2 units are linked through a bridging 2,5-PZDC ligand to form a dinuclear structure. The 2,5-PZDC lig- and adopts tetradentate coordination mode and is chelated to both VO2 moieties by one oxygen atom of the carboxylato ligand and by an adja- cent nitrogen atom of the aromatic ring in the α- position, which is different from the tetradentate one in the title complex. While in the reported manganese(II) complex,13 the central Mn(II) ion is six-coordinate. The 2,5-PZDC ligand adopts the same hexadentate coordination mode as that in the title complex. Generally speaking, in the above reported d-block transition metal com- plexes, the 2,5-PZDC ligand adopts only one bridging mode in every complex. While in the title Table 2.

[La(2,5-PZDC)1.5(H2O)]n 869 Fig. 2. The layer structure extended in the (100) plane. complex, 2,5-PZDC adopts two bridging modes. This can be attributed to the larger radii and greater positive charge of the La(III) ion, and hence the large coordination number and dif- ferent coordination modes are required by the lanthanide ion. Fig. 3. The packing diagram of the title complex viewed along the b-axis. Thermogravimetric analysis The TG analysis of the title complex was carried out to examine its thermal stability. The complex underwent ﬁrst weight loss of 4.8% from 148 to 180◦C corresponding to the loss of one coordinated water molecule (calculated: 4.4%), leaving a framework of [La(2,5-PZDC)1.5]. And it began to decompose further beyond 410◦C and ended at 760◦C with the residue La2O3 obtained.
