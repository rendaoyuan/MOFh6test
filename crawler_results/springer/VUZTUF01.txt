Stone,(1) Mark D. Smith,(1) and Hans-Conrad zur Loye(1)∗ Received October 12, 2005; accepted September 20, 2006 Published Online November 9, 2006 Single crystals of Ca(HO3PC6H5)2 (1) and Sr(HO3PC6H5)2 (2) have been obtained via the crystallization of their respective amorphous powders. The amorphous compounds were synthesized by traditional solution routes and were subsequently crystallized at 160◦C in a Teﬂon-lined autoclave containing 1–3 mL distilled water. The resultant single crystals were physically isolated and their structures determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The two compounds are isostructural and crystallize in space group C2/c with lattice parameters of a = 31.267(3) Å, b = 5.6185(6) Å, c = 7.7202(8) Å, β = 101.924(2)◦; and a = 31.514(4) Å, b = 5.8098(8) Å, c = 7.8218(10) Å, β = 102.063(3)◦for the calcium and strontium phenylphosphonate, respectively. KEY WORDS: metal phosphonate; layered structure; crystal structure; hydrothermal crystallization. Introduction Metal phosphonates have the general for- mula Mx(HyO3PR)z· nH2O, where R is the or- ganic group covalently bound to the phospho- rous atom. These compounds have been studied since the late 1970’s when Alberti et al. prepared Zr(O3PC6H5)2 and determined its structure from the powder X-ray diffraction pattern.1 Since that time, numerous other metal phosphonates, includ- ing titanium,2 zirconium,3 calcium,4 strontium,5 zinc,6 manganese,7 and aluminum8 phosphonates, have been synthesized and studied either as pow- ders or, in rare instances, as single crystals. Many of these metal phosphonates are layered com- pounds, and the interest in layered metal phos- phonates stems from the fact the organic groups, (1) Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South Carolina, 631 Sumter St. Columbia, SC 29208, US. ∗To whom correspondence should be addressed; e-mail: zurloye@ mail.chem.sc.edu which project into the interlayer space, can be chosen by the selection of the phosphonic acid starting material. Thus, the nature of the organic group, i.e., the size, degree of hydrophobicity, and functionalization, exerts signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the physical properties of this class of materials. Potential applications of layered metal phospho- nates include ion exchange, molecular recogni- tion, and catalysis.2,9–11 Metal phosphonates synthesized from tetravalent metal ions are the oldest and most studied metal phosphonate materials. Phospho- nates of tetravalent metals are relatively insolu- ble in aqueous environments and often form as amorphous powders. In 1978 Alberti et al. used concentrated HF to solubilize these phosphonates and succeeded in obtaining crystalline products that could be structurally investigated by powder X-ray diffraction. While this method represents one route to obtaining highly crystalline metal phosphonates, obtaining single crystals is still 103 1074-1542/07/0200-0103/0 C⃝2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 104 Stone, Smith, and Loye considered very difﬁcult and, consequently, struc- ture solutions are typically obtained from powder X-ray diffraction data. In the early 1990’s, the ﬁrst phosphonates containing di-, tri-, penta-, and hexavalent metals were prepared,4–5,7–8 Due to their much greater solubilities, crystals of di- and tri-valent metal phosphonates are more easily obtained; and con- sequently, more single crystal structure determi- nations have been made for this class of metal phosphonates. Because of their favorable solu- bility, crystals of these compounds are gener- ally synthesized hydrothermally in a Teﬂon-lined autoclave containing an aqueous solution of the metal salt and the respective phosphonic acid.4–5 In some cases, other solvents, such as ethanol, have been used either to aid in the solubility of the reactants or to aid in the growth of single crystals. Herein, we describe the hydrothermal crystal growth and single crystal structure de- termination of two divalent metal phosphonates, calcium phenyl phosphonate (1) and strontium phenyl phosphonate (2). Experimental Synthesis of Ca(HO3PC6H5)2 Calcium phenyl phosphonate (1) was synthe- sized as a powder in a reﬂux environment starting from calcium nitrate (0.026 mol) and phenyl phos- phonic acid (0.052 mol).4 The two reagents were reﬂuxed in water for two days without adjustment of the pH. A white solid began to form within ﬁve minutes of starting the reﬂux and the solid particles became more plate-like with increased reﬂux time. After two days, the mixture contain- ing the plate-like particles was centrifuged, the su- pernatant was drawn off, and the remaining solid was dried overnight at 75◦C. The X-ray powder diffraction data indicated a disordered layered ma- terial based on the observation of only the (00l) reﬂections. Synthesis of Sr(HO3PC6H5)2. Strontium phenyl phosphonate (2) was synthesized follow- ing the same procedure outlined for the calcium compound except that strontium nitrate was used as the metal salt.5 Crystallization of Ca(HO3PC6H5)2 and Sr(HO3PC6H5)2 Calcium and strontium phenyl phosphonate were synthesized as single crystals using a re- crystallization method adopted from the method reported by Kessler.12 The powders were placed in 23 mL Teﬂon lined autoclaves along with 1– 3 mL distilled water. The vessels were sealed, placed in an oven, and heated at 160◦C for 11 days. After the heating period, the oven was shut off and allowed to coolto roomtemperature.Once cooled, the contents of the autoclaves were removed and dried. Visual inspection of the product revealed lamellar, plate-shaped single crystals that were used for the structure determinations. Single crystal structure determination X-ray intensity data from a colorless crystal were measured at 294(2) K on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD-based diffractometer (Mo Kα radi- ation, λ = 0.71073 Å) [13]. Raw data frame integration and Lp corrections were performed with SAINT + .13 Final unit cell parameters for (1) and (2) were determined by least-squares re- ﬁnement of 1908 and 1046 reﬂections, respec- tively, with I > 5σ(I) from the data set. Anal- ysis of the data showed negligible crystal decay during collection. Direct methods structure so- lution, difference Fourier calculations and full- matrix least-squares reﬁnement against F2 were performed with SHELXTL.14 Crystals of (2) grew as lamellar aggregations of thin plates. All available crystals appeared to be composed of multiple plate domains. A thin plate, predominantly composed of a single plate domain, was eventually found for the compound. The crystal diffracted weakly due to its dimen- sions, and no diffraction was observed above 2θ ∼45◦.

All of these reﬂections could be indexed to the same C-centered cell with a different orienta- tion, indicating the crystal might be treated as a two-component twin. After data collection, three models were tried to account for the contribution of the minor plate domain to the overall diffrac- tion data. These consisted of: (1) reﬁnement in- cluding all data from both domains, employing separate scale factors for reﬂections affected by complete overlap, partial overlap or no overlap Table 2.

An- other reﬁnement was performed neglecting the contribution of the minor domain. Reﬁnement of twin models (1) and (3) were unstable owing to the small number of minor component reﬂections; twin model (2) was similar to the normal reﬁne- ment but with a lower data-to-parameter ratio. Therefore for the ﬁnal reﬁnement the contribution of the minor domain to the data was ignored and the data reﬁned normally. It is important to note that due to the small size of the crystals and the aforementioned difﬁculties, the precision of the reﬁnement is lower than optimum. The structure solution of (1) proceeded sim- ilarly to that of (2) except that the structure was not twinned and reﬂections at angles above 2θ ∼ 45◦were observed. Crystal data, data collection parameters, and reﬁnement statistics for (1) and (2) are listed in Table 1. Selected interatomic dis- tances and bond angles for 1 and 2 are collected in Tables 2–3. Discussion Crystals of (1) and (2) were obtained by hy- drothermal crystallization of powdered precursor materials. The method represents an adaptation of the procedure published by Kessler to achieve the crystallization of oxide thin ﬁlms,12 and this work is the ﬁrst report, to our knowledge, of the use of this method to obtain single crystals of metal phosphonates large enough for single crys- tal structure determinations. It is believed that the metal phosphonates are slightly soluble under the hydrothermal reaction conditions and that these conditions are appropriate for the nucleation and growth of crystals. An important advantage of this approach over other methods is that it avoids the use of HF. It is expected that this technique can be adapted for growing crystals of other metal phosphonate or even metal oxide materials. Fig. 1. Thermal ellipsoid plot of Sr(HO3PC6H5)2.

The yellow spheres are phosphorus atoms, the red spheres are oxygen atoms, the green spheres are strontium atoms, the black spheres are carbon atoms, and the blue spheres represent hydrogen atoms. Sr(C6H5PO2OH)2 crystallizes in the space group C2/c. The asymmetric unit consists of one complete C6H5PO2OH−anion and half of a Sr2+ cation located on a two-fold rotational axis. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters; hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon were placed in idealized positions and included as riding atoms. While a structure solution of this strontium compound has been obtained from powder X-ray diffraction data5 this is the ﬁrst report of a single crystal determination for this compound. As shown in 108 Stone, Smith, and Loye Fig. 1, the phosphorus is in a tetrahedral environ- ment with bonds to three different oxygen atoms and one bond to a carbon of the phenyl ring. The strontium ion is coordinated by eight oxy- gen atoms from the phosphonate groups resulting in a distorted dodecahedral arrangement. Fig. 2 is a view of Sr(C6H5PO2OH)2 looking down the b-axis. The phenyl rings lie perpendicular to the sheets of metal atoms resulting in a 2-dimensional layered arrangement. Ca(C6H5PO2OH)2 also crystallizes in the space group C2/c and is isostructural with Sr(C6H5PO2OH)2. The asymmetric unit consists of one complete C6H5PO2OH−anion and half a Ca2+ cation located on a two-fold rotational axis. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters; hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon were placed in idealized positions and included as riding atoms. The proton H3A was located and reﬁned freely. The thermal ellipsoid plot for calcium phenyl phosphonate is shown is Fig. 3 and has the same structure as that of the strontium derivative. The structure is in agreement with an earlier structure determina- tion.4 Fig. 3. Thermal ellipsoid plot of Ca(HO3PC6H5)2. Thermal ellipsoids are drawn at 50% probability. Conclusion We were able to successfully crystallize cal- cium and strontium phenylphosphonate by a hy- drothermal method and obtain plate shaped sin- gle crystals. The structures of the two compounds were solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction. This is a versatile method for growing metal phos- phonate crystals from as-synthesized powders.
