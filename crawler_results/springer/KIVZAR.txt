Manuscript BRIEF COMMUNICATION Ligand-directed copper(I) azide coordination polymers bridged by N-donor ligands with different lengths: azide exhibits a rare l1, 1, 3, 3 bridging mode Guang Fan Æ San Ping Chen Æ Sheng Li Gao Received: 21 November 2006 / Accepted: 18 July 2007 / Published online: 15 August 2007  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007 Abstract A Ligand-Directed strategy has been adopted to synthesize three novel Copper(I) coordination polymers, [Cu2(bpe)(N3)2]n (1), [Cu2(bpy)(N3)2]n (2), and [Cu4(py) (N3)4]n (3), by the reactions of NaN3 with bpe, bpy and py (bpe = 1,2-trans-(4-pyridyl)ethene, bpy = 4,40-bipyridine, py = pyrazine) in the presence of H3PO3 under hydro- thermal conditions, which proved that the length of ligands had subtle effects on overall network and the coordination mode of azide. Keywords Copper(I) azide coordination polymer  Hydrothermal synthesis  Crystal structure Introduction Due to of multifarious structural diversity and potential applications in non-linear optical, electrical, magnetic, separation, storage, and catalytical materials, metal- organic coordination architectures, constructed through the selection of metal and ligand geometries, has been around for some 15 years now [1–9]. Even so, the attainment of rational control over desired topologies and applications is still of great challenges duo to labile coordination geometries of metal ions, versatile coordi- nation modes and topologies of organic ligands and other factors [10–13]. Despite the fact that the overall structure is predominantly controlled by the coordination prefer- ences of the transition metal and the ligand building blocks, more subtle effects such as the bridging modes and the length of ligands have been found to have a profound inﬂuence on network [14]. Compared to the ﬂexible ligands with conformational freedom, the rigid bridging ligands are anticipated to retain their geometries. Pyrazine, 4,40-bipyridine and 1,2-trans-(4- pyridyl)ethene are, distinguished by the length, all linear bidentate bridging ligand with rigid backbones and possess the same coordination atoms and similar coordination abilities, which have become common in the generation of coordination networks and metal-organic supermolecule architectures [15–29]. In an effort to rationalize the struc- tural effect of the length of the ligand, we are exploring the delicate effects inﬂuenced by verifying lengths of ligands on the network through reactions of the ligands of the ﬁxed geometries listed above with Cu(I), while keeping numer- ous other factors constant. As previous reports, azide ion can afford a variety of coordination modes such as the common (l1, 1), the frequent (l1, 1, 3) and the unusual (l1, 1, 1) modes to link one or more transition metal ions to form zero, one-, two- and three-dimensional complexes [30–33]. In this communication, we are interested in the coordination mode of azide ion tuned by the change of the ligand in coordi- nation polymers. Herein, under the same reaction conditions, using simple modiﬁcation of the length of ligands, we report the hydrothermal syntheses and crystal structures of three copper(I) azide coordination polymers, [Cu2(bpe)(N3)2]n (1), [Cu2(bpy)(N3)2]n (2), and [Cu4(py)(N3)4]n (3), which reveals the structures of the complexes changed from two- dimensional to three-dimensional networks with reducing the lengths of the bridging ligands. Stimulatingly, in complex (3), azide ion presents a rare l1, 1, 3, 3 bridging mode [34]. G. Fan  S. P. Chen  S. L.

The oran- gered color of them indicates that the valence of copper(II) has possibly changed to copper(I) during the reaction process, which is consistent with the results of single crystal analysis. According to Chambers [35], H3PO3 is a reducing reagent and the reduction ability becomes more powerful with increasing temperature. So, Cu(II) ions can be reduced to Cu(I) by H3PO3 under hydrothermal condi- tions, and we have successfully applied to synthesize mixed valence copper coordination polymer [36]. Single crystal X-ray analysis has revealed that complex [Cu2(N3)2(bpe)]n (1) crystallizes in Monoclinic space group C2/c. As shown in Fig. 1a, in this complex, each Cu(I) coordinates with four N atoms and adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Three N atoms from different (l1, 1, 3) bridging azide ligands and one N atom from pyridyl donor give rise to an inﬁnite one-dimensional [Cu(N3)]n stair-like chain (shown in Fig. 2), with the distances of 1.910(5)A˚ for Cu(1)–N(2), 1.955(4)A˚ for Cu(1)–N(1), 2.323(5)A˚ for Cu(1)–N(4A), and 2.357(5)A˚ for Cu(1)– N(4B), respectively. The range of angles for N–Cu–N are from 93.55(15) to 147.38(19). The two aromatic rings of 4,40-bpe ligand are almost coplanar about C=C with 0.0084A˚ for mean deviation from the plane. As observed in Fig. 2, The complex (1) forms two- dimensional sheets in the solid state. These sheets are formed by bpe ligands bridging [Cu(N3)]n stair-polymers. The new 1D [Cu(N3)]n stair–like chain is composed of two kinds of edge-shared rings. One is an eight-membered ring with –Cu–N3–Cu–N3– conﬁguration, which is almost coplanar. Another is a four-membered ring consisting of complete coplanar –Cu–N–Cu–N– conformation. And there is an interplane angle with 108.2 between the two different planes. In contrast to the complex (1), the complex [Cu2(b- py)(N3)2]n (2) crystallizes in Monoclinic space group P2(1)/n and the asymmetric unit consists of 10 non- hydrogen atoms as shown in Fig. 1b. All atoms localize in general positions. The complex (2) exists as a three- dimensional network consisting of [CuN3]n layer linked by bpy (Fig. 3). In this case, each copper(I) center coordi- nated with three independent (l1, 1, 3) bridging azide ligands and an aromatic bpy N-donor ligand (shown in Fig. 1b), exhibiting a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The distances of Cu(1)–N(1), Cu(1)–N(2), Cu(1)–N(2A), Cu(1)–N(4B) are 1.985(3), 2.089(3), 2.375(3), 1.919(3)A˚ , respectively. The angles of N–Cu–N are in the range of 91.68(9)–134.91(11). Furthermore, the two aromatic rings of 4,40-bpy ligand are coplanar about C–C bond, calculated by XP. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the arrangement of (l1, 1, 3) bridging model of azide leads to the formation of the two-dimensional plane which is composed of two kind of Fig. 3 The fragment of 3D network of complex (2) along b axis, H atoms are omitted for clarity Fig. 2 The fragment of 2D network of complex (1), H atoms are omitted for clarity purple: Cu, green: N, cyan: C 728 Struct Chem (2007) 18:725–731 123 rings through edge-sharing four-membered and sixteen- membered rings. The four-membered ring with –Cu–N– Cu–N– conﬁguration is strictly coplanar, with the distance of 3.027(1)A˚ for Cu–Cu weak interaction, and the sixteen- membered ring with the formation of –Cu–N3–Cu–N3– Cu–N3–Cu–N3– model can be considered to adopt a pseudo chair conformation. The complex (3) presents a three-dimensional network, with monoclinic crystal system and P2(1)/n space group, consisting of two-dimensional [Cu(N3)2]n plane linked by one-dimensional [Cu(py)(N3)2] chain through a rare (l1, 1, 3, 3) bridging mode for azide. In the complex (3), two crystallographic distinguishable copper(I) atoms, coordinate with four N atoms to exhibit disordered square pyramid coordination geometries. For Cu(1), N(2), N(5), and N(7A) atoms from three indepen- dent azide ligands, the other N(1) atom from pyrazine ligand. For Cu(2), all of coordination N atoms are from four different azide ligands. Furthermore, weak interaction has been found between Cu(1) and Cu(2) atoms with the distance of 3.035(1)A˚ , shown in Fig. 1c. Its structure analysis could be divided to two part: one-dimensional [Cu(py)(N3)2] chains are consisted of Cu(1) atoms bridged by two crystallographic independent azide ligands. Cu(2) Fig. 5 (a) One-dimensional [Cu(py)(N3)2] chain, (b) two- dimensional [Cu(N3)2]n plane Fig. 4 view of 2D plane consisting of (l1, 1, 3) bridging azido ligand and Cu atoms in (2). Dashed: ligand unsupported Cu(I)–Cu(I) interaction in 2D [CuN3]n plane Broken lines for Cu–Cu weak interactions Struct Chem (2007) 18:725–731 729 123 atoms are also connected by the same two crystallographic independent azide ligands to give rise to a two-dimensional [Cu(N3)2]n plane, representing a (4,4) topological layer, which are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. Finally, one-dimensional [Cu(py)(N3)2] chains and two-dimen- sional [Cu(N3)2]n plane are further linked by N(5) and N(7) atoms of azide ligand with a rare (l1, 1, 3, 3) bridging mode to afford a 3D network, shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen from Fig. 7, both N(5) and N(7) atoms connect Cu(1) and Cu(2) atoms in a rare (l1, 1, 3, 3) bridging mode, resulting in a 2D conformation about copper atoms linked by azide ligand. In the complexes (2) and (3), there are ligand unsup- ported Cu(I)–Cu(I) bonding interactions with the distances of 3.027(1) and 3.035(1)A˚ , which are slightly longer than those in complex of Cu2(obpy)2 {Hobpy = 6-hydroxyl- 2,20-bipyridine; Cu–Cu, 2.986 and 2.993 A˚ } [37], and are close to those in complex of [Cu3(pzc)2(CN)2(H2O)2 2H2O]n {pzc = pyrazinecarboxylic acid; Cu–Cu, 3.051A˚ } [38]. The ligand–unsupported Cu(I)–Cu(I) distances in (2) and (3), however, are shorter than that of 3.375A˚ observed in complex Cu2(ophen)2{Hophen = 2-hydroxyl-1,10-phe- nanthroline} [8]. In conclusion, by employing N-donor bridging ligands with different lengths, we adopted a ligand-directed strat- egy for constructing three new coordination polymers, and reported a rare l1, 1, 3, 3 bridging mode for Azide ion. The introduction of the bridging ligands with different lengths had a great inﬂuence on both molecular formation and crystal packing, which can be attributed to the spatial arrangement of ligand and coordination mode for azide ion.
