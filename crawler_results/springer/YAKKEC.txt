These compounds were char- acterized by elemental analysis, IR and X-ray crystallography. 1 consists of cubanelike [Cu4(3-I)4] fragments that link the neighboring ones via mbbm bridges to form a 1D ladder-type chain. 2 contains mononuclear [CuI] fragments that are bridged by mbbm ligands to yield a 1D zigzag chain. 3 or 4 contains a [Cu2(-I)2] dimeric fragment, which works as a four-connecting node to link its four equivalent ones to form a 2D (4,4) network (3) or acts as a two-connecting node to connect its two equivalent ones via two pairs of prbbm bridges to form a 1D double chain (4). The photoluminescent properties of 1–4 in the solid state at ambient temperature were investigated. coordination polymers, assembly, flexible ligands, solvothermal reactions, photoluminescent properties 1 Introduction Rational design and synthesis of functional coordination polymers with intriguing topologies [1–8] and potential useful properties, such as magnetism, photoluminescence, electric conductivity, adsorption, and catalysis [9–12], are of great interest. Suitable organic ligands favoring struc- ture-specific self-assembly are the basis for the construction of coordination architectures. The multitopic N-heterocyclic bridging ligands usually contain rigid or flexible spacers. Many of the reported architectures are based upon rigid linear ligands [13–16] while recent effort focused on the use of flexible ligands containing nitrogen or sulfur donors. Since Zaworotko et al. [17] reported the two isomers of the coordination polymer [Co(NO3)2(L)1.5]∞ (L = 1,2-bis(4′- pyridyl)ethane), which were due to the conformational flexibility of L with gauche in one and trans in the other, various flexible ligands such as 1,3-bis(4′-pyridyl)-propane (bpp) [18–20], 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (bix) [21, 22], 1,1-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole) (bbi) [23, 24], and 1,3,5-tris(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (tib) [25–27], have been employed to prepare inorganic-organic hybrid coordination polymers. Among the inorganic-organic hybrid materials, copper(I) salts, such as [Cu(MeCN)4]ClO4, have attracted much attention [28]. Especially, copper(I) iodide have been employed as inorganic components in the con- struction of novel coordination polymers with various structural motifs such as rhomboid [Cu2(-I)2] fragment [29–31], cubanelike or chairlike [Cu4(3-I)4] fragment [32–34], and zigzag [CuI]n chain [29, 31, 35]. These motifs could be further connected by N-heterocyclic linkers to form more complex [CunIn]-based frameworks. Preparation of such compounds has been reported to be affected by many factors such as CuI-to-ligand ratio, flexibility and rigidity of the ligands, solvents and temperatures [29, 36]. 2084 LI LingLing, et al. Sci China Chem October (2010) Vol.53 No.10 However, examples involved in the preparation of [Cu- nIn]-based polymers with heterocyclic flexible ligands are relatively less reported [37–42]. We have been interested in the construction and proper- ties of [CunIn]-supported coordination polymers. We iso- lated a series of [CunIn]-based coordination polymers through cracking the 3D framework of bulk CuI [42] using pyridyl, imidazolyl-, and triazolyl-based ditopic ligands. As an extension of our studies and to gain new structural types of [CunIn]-based coordination networks, we employed three new flexible ditopic N-heterocyclic linkers with different spacer lengths, [(bzim)(CH2)n(bzim)] (n = 13) (Scheme 1), and ran their reactions with CuI under solvothermal condi- tions. Four [CunIn]-based 1D and 2D coordination polymers, [{Cu4(3-I)4(mbbm)2}·2DMF]n (1), [(CuI)2(mbbm)2]n (2), [{Cu2(-I)2(ebbm)2}·2MeCN]n (3) and [Cu2(-I)2(prbbm)2]n (4), were isolated therefrom. Herein we report their sol- vothermal reactions, crystal structures and solid state photoluminescent properties. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods All the ligands were prepared according to the previously reported method [43]. Other chemicals and reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used as received. DMF and MeCN were predried with activated molecular sieves and heated at reflux over the appropriate drying agents under argon. The IR spectra (KBr disk) were re- corded on a Varian Scimitar-1000 spectrometer (400–4000 cm1). The elemental analyses for C, H, and N were per- formed with an EA1110 CHNS elemental analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected on a Ri- gaku D/MAX-IIIC powder diffractometer with Cu K ra- diation (1.54956 Å). The emission/excitation spectra were measured on a Varian Cary Elipse fluorescence spectro- photometer. 2.2 Synthesis of complexes 1–4 [{Cu4(3-I)4(mbbm)2}·2DMF]n (1). A mixture of CuI (19 mg, 0.1 mmol) and mbbm (12 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (0.5 mL) and MeCN (2 mL) to give a colorless solu- tion, which was transferred into a Pyrex glass tube. It was then sealed and heated at 150 °C for 2 d, and cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h1. Colorless prisms of 1 were formed, which were collected by filtration, washed with MeCN/Et2O (v/v = 1:4) and dried in air. Yield: 75% (based on Cu). Anal.

All measurements were carried out on a Rigaku Mercury CCD X-ray diffrac- tometer by using graphite-monochromated Mo K ( = 0.71073 Å). Single crystals of 1–4 were mounted at the top of a glass fiber with grease and cooled to 223 K in a liquid- Scheme 1 The conformations of the ligands. LI LingLing, et al. Sci China Chem October (2010) Vol.53 No.10 2085 nitrogen stream. Cell parameters were refined by using the program CrystalClear (Rigaku and MSC, version 1.3, 2001). The collected data was reduced by using the program Crys- talstructure (Rigaku and MSC, version 3.60, 2004) while an absorption correction (multi-scan) was applied. The reflec- tion data was also corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The crystal structures of 1–4 were solved by direct meth- ods and refined on F2 by full-matrix least-squares techniques with SHELXTL-97 program [44, 45]. All non-hydrogen at- oms except N1 and N4 in 1 were refined anisotropically and all hydrogen atoms except those on C16, C17, C18 in 1 and C18 in 4 were placed in geometrically idealized positions (CH = 0.98 Å, with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C) for methylene groups; CH = 0.94 Å, with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C) for aromatic rings) and constrained to ride on their parent atoms. Crys- tallographic data for the structural analyses has been depos- ited with Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, and CCDC reference numbers are 759604–759607. A summary of the key crystallographic information for 1–4 is tabulated in Table 1 and their selected bond lengths and angles are shown in Table 2. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthetic and spectral aspects Reactions of CuI with 0.5 equiv of mbbm in MeCN/DMF under solvothermal conditions led to the formation of a [Cu4I4]-based polymeric complex 1 in 75% yield while those of CuI with equimolar mbbm in MeCN under the same conditions yielded a [CuI]-based polymer 2 in 62% yield. The difference between the two reactions may be as- cribed to the different CuI-to-ligand ratios and the solvent systems. In order to examine the CuI-to-ligand ratio factor, we carried out similar reactions with different CuI:L ratios (e.g. 1:2, 1:1) and isolated the same products, which indi- cates that the CuI-to-ligand ratio did not work in the two cases. To this end, the different results of the two reactions are to be dependent on the selected solvent systems (MeCN/DMF vs. MeCN). Analogous reactions of CuI with ebbm or prbbm in MeCN gave rise to two [Cu2I2]-based polymers 3 and 4 in 48% and 52% yields, respectively. The different structures of 2–4 may be determined by the flexi- ble ligands with different spacer lengths as they were pro- duced under the same conditions.

Compounds 1–4 are relatively air- and moisture-stable, and insoluble in common organic solvents such as CH2Cl2, MeCN, DMF and somewhat soluble in DMSO and aniline. The elemental analyses were consistent with their chemical formula. The PXRD displayed that the experimental pattern for each compound correlates well with the simulated one generated from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data (see Figures S1–S4). In the IR spectra of 1–4, the medium bands at 1614 (1), 1615 (2), 1615 (3) and 1615 (4) cm1 were as- signed as the C=N stretching vibrations of benzimidazolyl groups. The identities of 1–4 were further confirmed by X-ray crystallography. 3.2 Crystal structures of 1-4 Compound 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c and the asymmetric unit consists of half a [Cu4(3-I)4- (mbbm)2] molecule and one DMF solvent molecule. As shown in Figure 1(a), the [Cu4(3-I)4(mbbm)2] molecule contains a cubanelike [Cu4(3-I)4] fragment in which four Cu(I) and four I atoms alternatively occupy the eight cor- ners of the cube. Such a core structure closely resembles LI LingLing, et al. Sci China Chem October (2010) Vol.53 No.10 2087 those of a series of complexes containing [Cu4(3-X)4] cu- banelike cores [34, 46, 47]. Each Cu(I) atom adopts a dis- torted tetrahedral coordination geometry, coordinated by one N atom of mbbm and three 3-I atoms. The mean Cu-3-I length (2.697(16) Å) is longer than those of the corresponding ones of other [Cu4(3-I)4]-based coordination polymers such as [Cu4(3-I)4(bbbt)2]n (bbbt = 1,1′-(1,4-buta- nediyl)bis-1H-benzotriazole) (2.541(2) Å) [42] and [Cu4(3-I)4- (bpp)2]n (2.687(16) Å) [48], but shorter than in [Cu4(3-I)4- (tdp)2]n (tdp = 4,4′-thiodipyridine) (2.728(1) Å) [49] and [(Cu4(3-I)4)(bpds)2] (bpds = bis(4-pyridyl)disulfide) (2.704(6) Å) [50]. The mean CuN (1.987(8) Å) bond length is shorter than those found in the above polymers. The Cu…Cu sepa- ration (2.748(2) Å) is comparable to those of other [Cu4(3-I)4]-based polymers [48, 49, 51], suggesting possi- ble existence of metal-metal interaction. For each mbbm ligand, the N-to-N distance is 2.430 Å (N2/N3 pair) and the dihedral angle between the benzimidazole rings is 100.6°. Two mbbm ligands link four Cu atoms of the adjacent [Cu4(3-I)4] fragments to generate a twenty-membered [Cu2I(mbbm)]2 metallomacrocycle. Topologically, each cubanelike [Cu4(3-I)4] fragment is linked by two pairs of mbbm bridges, forming a 1D ladder-type chain extending along the a axis (Figure 1(b)). Alternatively, this chain structure may be viewed as being built of such metallomac- rocycles linked by the rest 3-I bridges. No evident hydro- gen bonding interactions are found between chains. Compound 2 crystallizes in the triclinic space group Pī and the asymmetric unit consists of one [(CuI)2(mbbm)2] molecule. As shown in Figure 2, Cu1 and Cu2 take a trigo- nal planar coordination geometry, coordinated by one ter- minal I and two N atoms from two different mbbm ligands. The average CuI and CuN bond lengths (2.5707(9) Å vs. 1.967(5) Å) are shorter than those of the corresponding ones found in {[CuI(bbbm)1.5]·0.25MeCN}n (2.630(2) Å vs. 2.093(7) Å) [42]. For mbbm ligands, the N-to-N distance is 2.429 Å for N2/N3 pair or 2.437 Å for N6/N7 pair while the dihedral angle between the benzimidazole rings bearing N2/N3 pair or N6/N7 pair is 60.7° and 59.5°, respectively. Each [CuI] fragment interconnects with its neighboring ones through two mbbm bridges to form a 1D zigzag chain extending along the c axis. Compound 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n and the asymmetric unit consists of half a neutral [Cu2(-I)2(ebbm)2] molecule and one MeCN solvent mole- cule. As shown in Figure 3(a), there is a crystallographic two-fold axis running through the center of the [Cu2(-I)2] rhomb. The Cu…Cu separation (3.429 Å) is too long to include any metal-metal interaction. Each Cu(I) adopts a tetrahedral coordination geometry, coordinated by two -I atoms and two N atoms from two ebbm ligands. The [Cu2(-I)2] rhomb is asymmetric and the Cu1I1(B) bond length is much longer than the Cu1I1 bond length and those observed in {[Cu2(-I)2(bpp)2]·2aniline}n (2.6310(13) 2.6681(14) Å). The CuN bond lengths ranging from 2.020(4) Å to 2.038(5) Å are slightly shorter than those of [Cu2(-I)2(bpp)2] [48, 52] or [Cu2(-I)2L4] (L = pyridine; 3,5-dimethylpridine; 3-methylpridine) [53–55]. Each ebbm ligand exhibits a gauche-gauche configuration with the N-to-N distances of 3.115 Å (N2/N3 pair) and the dihedral angle of 45.1° between the two benzimidazole rings. Topo- logically, each rhomboid [Cu2(-I)2] fragment acts as a rare planar four-connecting node to interlink the other four equivalent ones via two pairs of ebbm ligands to form a unique 2D (4,4) network extending along the bc plane (Fig- ure 3(b) (c)). Compound 4 crystallizes in the triclinic space group Pī and the asymmetric unit consists of half a neutral [Cu2(-I)2(prbbm)2] molecule. 4 also contains rhomboid [Cu2(-I)2] fragments that are linked by two pairs of prbbm bridges, forming a 1D double chain that runs in the [110] direction (Figure 4).

Each Cu(I) center is tetrahedrally coordinated by two I atoms and two N atoms of two different prbbm ligands. The mean CuI and CuN bond lengths are compared with those of the above [Cu2(-I)2L4] complexes. Each prbbm ligand exhibits a trans-gauche configuration with a N-to-N distance of 4.458 Å (N2/N3 pair) and a dihe- dral angle of 111.0° between the two benzimidazole rings. 3.3 Photoluminescent properties The photoluminescent properties of 1–4 in the solid state at ambient temperature were studied (Figure 5). For 1 and 2, upon excitation at 360 nm, they exhibited strong photolu- minescence with emission maxima at 546 and 574 nm, re- spectively, which are red-shifted relative to that of mbbm ( ex max  = 270 nm, em max  = 303 nm). The green emission of 1 is similar to that of the cubanelike cluster complexes [Cu4(3-I)4(bbbt)2]n ( em max  = 550 nm) [42] and [Cu4(3-I)4- (bpp)2]n ( em max  = 569 nm) [48]. Therefore it might be as- signed as a combination of a cluster-centered (CC*) transi- tion containing mixed halide-to-metal charge-transfer (XMCT) and d–s transitions by Cu(I)Cu(I) interactions [56–60]. For 3 and 4, upon excitation at 305 and 330 nm, the emission maxima are located at 597 and 507 nm, re- spectively, which are red-shifted compared to those of the ebbm ligand ( ex max  = 270 nm, em max  = 310 nm) and the prbbm ligand ( ex max  = 250 nm, em max  = 332 nm). The emission maximum of 4 is the same as that of the dimeric polymer [CuI(bpp)]n (1) [48] and close to that of [Cu2(-I)2(py)4] (py = pyridine, em max  = 517 nm) [61]. The origin of the emis- sions of 2, 3 and 4 may be assigned to be halide-to-ligand charge-transfer (XLCT) [42, 48, 61, 62]. 4 Conclusions We prepared four 1D or 2D [CunIn]-based coordination polymers from solvothermal reactions of CuI with three benzimidazolyl-based ditopic ligands (mbbm, ebbm, and prbbm), which were structurally characterized by elemental analysis, IR and X-ray analysis. The formation of 1 and 2 using the same components under the same conditions is Figure 3 (a) View of the rhomboid [Cu2(-I)2(ebbm)4] fragment of 3. All hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity.

It is noteworthy that struc- tural diversities of 1–4 may be significantly affected by the flexible ligands with different spacer lengths and the differ- ent [CunIn] fragments. These results may provide insights into the rational design and construction of functional coor- dination polymers. In addition, solids 1–4 have strong green emission at room temperature when excited at certain wavelengths, which suggests that they may be used as green-emitting luminescent materials. Further investigation of the solvothermal reactions of CuI with other N-containing ligands with different spacer lengths and the potential ap- plications of the resulting products is underway.
