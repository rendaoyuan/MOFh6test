In 1 and 2, the metal centers are linked by bridging CN−/SCN−to form one-dimensional chains in the crystals and are stabilized by interchain π–π stacking interaction. Keywords Hydrothermal synthesis . Crystal structure . Coordination polymer . Copper(I) Introduction Copper(I) complexes of phenanthroline ligands have re- ceived much attention due to their properties and have good prospect as functional materials [1–5]. In recent years, pseu- dochalide(such as azido, cyanato and thiocyanato) are at- tractive as co-ligands, as they may bridge metal ions as well as neutralize the charge, thus providing possibilities for the formation of neutral network structures [6]. Partic- ularly, cyanide- or thiocyanate-bridged metal-coordination complexes have deserved special attention because they exhibit interesting electrochemical, zeolitic, magnetic, and photomagnetic properties [7, 8]. In this regard, a great va- riety of cyanide- or thiocyanate-bridged extended networks have been prepared [8, 9], in which cyanide and thiocyanate ligands act as linkers between copper centers. In this paper, Z.-N. Lou · Z.-B. Han () · P. Zhang School of Chemical Science and Engineering, Liaoning University, Shenyang 110036, P.R China e-mail: ceshzb@lnu.edu.cn we report the hydrothermal syntheses and crystal structures of two new CuI coordination polymers: [CuI(TATP)(CN)]n (1) and [CuI(bpy)(SCN)]n (2). Experimental Materials and methods The aromatic chelate ligand TATP was sythesized according to the literature method [10]; all other reagents and solvents employed were commercially available and used as received without further puriﬁcation. The C, H, and N microanaly- ses were carried out with Perkin-Elmer 240 elemental an- alyzer. The FT-IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the 4000–400 cm−1 range on a PE Spectrum One FTIR spectrometer. X-ray power diffraction were recorded with a Bruker AXS D8 advanced automated diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation.

X-ray crystallography Crystallographic data of 1 and 2 were collected at room tem- perature with a Bruker SMART Apex CCD area-detector diffractometer with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and graphite monochromator using the ω-scan mode. An em- pirical absorption correction was applied using the SAD- ABS programs [11]. The structure was solved by direct methods and reﬁned on F2 by full-matrix least squares us- ing SHELXTL [12]. All non-hydrogen atoms were treated anisotropically. The positions of hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically. Crystallographic data and exper- imental details for structural analysis are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2.

IR spectra and XRPD patterns The characteristic frequencies observed for the present lig- ands at around 1600, 1570 and 1400 cm−1 are due to C=C and C=N groups in 1 and 2. The IR spectrum of 1 shows very strong doublet at 2101 and 2069 cm−1, which corresponds to the stretching C–N vibration of the cyanide. The character- istic thiocyanate stretches are observed around 2111 cm−1 in 2 and are consistent with those observed previously for the bridging thiocyanate groups [8, 13]. The simulated and experimental XRPD patterns of 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 1. Their peak positions are in good agreement with each other, indicating the phase purity of the product. The differences in intensity may be due to the preferred orientation of the powder samples. Crystal structure In 1 and 2, CuI(TATP) or CuI(bpy) moieties are linked to polymeric chains bridged by cyanide or thiocyanate groups, resulting in a 1:1 stoichiometry for the compounds. 1 crystallizes in monoclinic space group P21/n. The asym- metrical unit of the unit cell contains one Cu(I), one CN group, one TATP ligand (Fig. 2a). Each Cu(I) center is four- coordinated with two nitrogen atoms of one TATP ligand [Cu1–N1 2.125(3) Å, Cu1–N2 2.1396(3) Å] and one car- bon atom and one nitrogen atom of the cyanide groups from two different cyanide ligands [Cu(1)–C(15)cyano 1.886(4) Å, Cu(1)–N(5A)cyano 2.003(3) Å, N(5)–C(15)–Cu(1) 171.9(3)◦, C(15)–N(5)–Cu(1B) 170.5(3)◦] (Table 2), forming a dis- torted tetrahedral coordination.

The lateral phen ligands from adjacent chains are paired to fur- nish moderately strong π–π stacking interactions (face-face distance ca. 3.53 Å) [14], which extend the helical chains in wavy two-dimensional layers parallel to the (1 0 1) plane in the lattice (Fig. 3b). The {Cu(CN)}n backbones in 1 has an essentially linear cyanogen ion, with values for N5–C15–Cu1, 171.9(3)◦, C15–N5–Cu1, 170.5(3)◦. 2 crystallizes in orthorhombic space group Pnma. The asymmetrical unit of the unit cell contains one Cu(I), half bpy ligand, one SCN group (Fig. 2b). Each Cu(I) center is co- ordinated by two nitrogen atoms of one bpy group (Cu1–N1 2.082(16), Cu1–N1A 2.082(16) Å), one carbon atom and one 10 20 30 40 50 60 (i) 2θ/ o(Cu-Kα) (ii) (a) 10 20 30 40 50 60 (i) 2θ/ o(Cu-Kα) (ii) (b) Fig. 1 Simulated (i) and experimental (ii) X-ray powder diffraction patterns of 1 (a) and 2 (b) sulfur atom from two different thiocyanate groups (Cu1–N2 1.911(2), Cu1–S1A 2.315(9) Å). Thus, each Cu(I) center also displays a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. Each SCN ligand connects two copper centers leading to a zigzag chain (Fig. 4a). The {Cu(SCN)}n backbones in 2, [CuI(dmp)(SCN)]n [15], [CuI(dafone)(SCN)]n [8], and [CuI(phen)(SCN)]n [8], have very similar geometries, with mean values for Cu–N, 2.183 Å; Cu–S, 2.315 Å; N2–Cu1–S1, 115.4(8)◦; C6–S1–Cu1, 106.2(9)◦; C6–N2–Cu1, 173.41(2)◦, N2–C6–S1, 177.37(2)◦, and an essentially linear thiocyanate ion. The only signif- icant differences are the torsion angles about the CuNCS axes. A Cu–(SCNCu)–S torsion angle results in a zigzag ar- rangement of the CuI(bpy) moieties along the chain. As can be seen in Fig. 4b, this arrangement allows π–π stacking between bpy ligands in adjacent chains. The mean planes between two such interacting ligands are only 3.42 Å apart.

The reduced viscosity of the solvent under these condi- tions favors the solvent extraction of solids, the self-assembly of the precursors, and the crystal growth from the solution. A careful search of literature reveals that phen and its derivatives yield four-coordinated cationic complexes with (a) (b) Fig. 3 One-dimensional chain fragment with atomic labeling scheme (a) and the 2-D network showing the interchain π–π stacking interac- tions viewed along the a-axis (b) in 1 cuprous salts [16], in agreement with the usual preference for four-coordinated complexes over six-coordinated ones by CuI. Substitutions at various positions on the phen ligand inﬂuence the structural as well as the chemical properties of the resulting CuI complexes [17, 18]. In the present work, we have obtained distorted tetrahedral CuI neutral complexes reacting CuI with TATP or bpy which are modiﬁed phen ligands. Recently, many papers have been reported on cyano-bridged heterobimetallic coordination polymers and their magnetic properties [19]. Hydrothermal reactions between [Fe(CN)6]3−and Cu(II) ions have led, in some Springer Struct Chem (2007) 18:549–554 553 (a) (b) Fig. 4 Chain fragment with atomic labeling scheme (a) and the 2- D network showing the interchain π −π stacking interactions viewed along the a-axis (b) in 2 cases, to fully reduced cyano-bridged Fe(II)–Cu(I) systems [20, 21]. It has commonly been assumed that cyanide groups from the reduction process, yield cyanogen as the oxidation product [7]. In this paper, we use [Fe(CN)6]4−instead of [Fe(CN)6]3−, so we did not ﬁnd Fe existing in the crystals of 1. Because the organic polytopic ligands (TATP and bpy) are poorly soluble in water, the hydrothermol conditions (high temperature and pressure) are essential for the dissolution of the metal-ligand suspension and then for the crystallization of 1 and 2 during cooling. In 1, CuI(TATP) moieties are linked to polymeric chains bridged by cyanide groups through C and N donors. Al- though not required by crystal symmetry, the Cu–N(TATP) distances, 2.125(3) and 2.139(3) Å, are essentially equal. In 2, CuI(bpy) moieties are linked to polymeric chains bridged by thiocyanate groups through S and N donors. The two nitrogen atoms of bpy are crystallographically equivalent by virtue of the crystal mirror plane, and are thus sym- metrically bonded to Cu(1), with Cu–N(1) 2.082(16) Å. In both cases, the N-donor ligands act as passivating agents by blocking two metal-coordination sites, while cyanide and thiocyanate ligands favor the propagation of the structure in one-dimensional chains, where the two polymeric com- pounds have distorted tetrahedral geometries. In conclusion, two Cu(I) coordination polymers, [CuI(TATP)(CN)]n and [CuI(bpy)(SCN)]n, have been suc- cessfully synthesized, in which the Cu(I) centers are four- coordinated with nitrogen and carbon or sulphur atoms.
