Introduction The synthesis and study of novel inorganic compounds, especially those with specific functional groups, constitute an important area of research. A large number of synthetic approaches involving both mild as well as extreme conditions have been employed for the preparation of such compounds. Of these, com- pounds possessing extended network structures are an important class. In recent years, solids possessing extended structures have been attracting attention for their many applications in the area of catalysis, sorption and separation processes, both actual as well as potential. Many of these compounds have been prepared employing hydrothermal methods. The term hydrothermal is purely of geological origin, which generally refers to any heterogeneous reaction in the presence of aqueous solvents or mineralisers under high pressure and temperature conditions to dissolve and recrystallise materials that are relatively insoluble under ordinary conditions. Sir Roderick Murchison (1792–1871), the British Geologist, used this term to describe the action of water at elevated temperature and pressure in bringing about the changes in the earth’s crust leading to the formation of various minerals. The first successful commercial applica- tion of the hydrothermal method began with the mineral extraction or ore beneficiation during the 19th Century. Karl Josef Bayer (1871–1908) used sodium hydroxide to leach bauxite in 1892 as a process for obtaining pure aluminum hydroxide, under hydrothermal conditions. Further importance of the hydrothermal technique for the synthesis of inor- ganic compounds in a commercial way was realized soon after the synthesis of large single crystals of quartz and later aluminosilicate zeolites by Barrer.1,2 The versatility of the hydrothermal procedure, mainly due to the mineralizing role of water, is quite apparent as it forms many minerals with considerable struc- tural variety. Open aluminosilicate zeolite frame- works are stabilized during growth by being filled with guest molecules and hydrothermal method pro- vides a facile route. One of the important aspects of the hydrothermal method is to get the reactants, which are otherwise difficult to dissolve, into solution under the action of mineralisers or solvents. This is similar to the chemical transport reactions, which prompted definition of hydrothermal reactions as a special case of chemical transport reactions. Many of the fundamental physical properties of water like fugacity, dielectric constant, density etc. undergo considerable changes during the Srinivasan Natarajan et al 526 hydrothermal reaction at elevated temperatures. This has resulted in using this method for many types of reactions. Though traditionally hydrothermal method has been employed for the growth of large single crystals (quartz) and also for the leaching of ores dur- ing metal extraction, recent research has clearly shown that it is also highly beneficial for the prepara- tion of new types of solids, especially complexes, coordination polymers3 and microporous materials.4 Hydrothermal crystallizations are multi-component heterogeneous reactions involving several processes including equilibrium reactions, nucleation and growth. In many of the preparations of microporous solids under hydrothermal conditions, an organic amine molecule is used. The role of the organic amine mole- cule in the synthesis of such solids can be classified into three types: templating, structure-directing and space-filling. Here ‘templating’ refers to the forma- tion of a unique structure, which reflects the geo- metrical and electronic structure of the template. Structure-direction describes the process where a specific organic amine preferentially leads to the synthesis of a structure by suitably influencing fac- tors such as pH, solubility and electrostatic interac- tions. Space-filling is a process in which the organic amine excludes water and enhances the interactions in the organic-framework composite and thereby in- creases the thermodynamic stability. During the synthesis of porous solids, irrespective of the role of the amine molecules, the amine mole- cules are, in general, located in cavities or channels and appears to direct the formation of a particular structure. The amine molecules can be removed by calcination, acid-leaching etc. to give a solid with large porous structure. Such solids are useful in the areas of catalysis, sorption and separation processes. We have been employing the hydrothermal methods extensively for the past few years. The intense re- search activity resulted in many new compounds possessing a variety of structures. The compounds have zero-, one-, two- and three-dimensionally ex- tended structures. The lower dimensional structures appear to be precursors for the formation of the structures of higher dimensionality. In what follows, we present a few select examples of open-framework compounds prepared in our laboratory using the hydrothermal method. The compounds, [CoII(C10H8N2) (H2PO3)2], I, [C6N3H20][Zn2(AsO4)(HAsO4)2].2H2O, II, [NH3(CH2)CH(NH3)CH3]3[Fe6(AsO4)2(HAsO4)6 (C2O4)3], III, [C5N2H14] [Fe4(HPO3)2(C2O4)3], IV, {Gd(H2O)3Co[C5N1H3(COO)2]3}, V and {Zn(H2O)2 [C5N1H3(COO)2]}.H2O, VI, illustrate the efficacy of this method. 2. Experimental 2.1 Synthesis 2.1a [CoII(C10H8N2)(H2PO3)2], I: 0⋅048 g of Co- powder was dispersed in 3 ml deionised water. To this, 0⋅272 g of H3PO3 and 0⋅259 g of 4,4′-bipyridine were added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The final mixture with the composition, 1⋅0 Co : 4H3PO3 : 2(4,4′-bipyridine) : 200 H2O, was heated at 125°C for 7 days in a 7-ml PTFE-lined acid digestion bomb, to result in large quantities of pink-coloured crystals. The initial pH was ~ 2 and there was no appreciable change in pH during the reaction. 2.1b [C6H20N3][Zn2(AsO4)(HAsO4)2]⋅2H2O, II: 0⋅045 g of ZnO, 0⋅252 g of As2O5, 0⋅10 ml of acetic acid, and 0⋅16 ml of 3,3′-diaminodipropyamine (DPTA) were added to a mixture of 1 ml of THF and 2 ml of water The reaction mixture with the composition, 1 ZnO : 2As2O5 : 1 CH3COOH : 2 DPTA : 22 THF : 200 H2O, was heated at 75°C for 72 h fol- lowed by at 150°C for 24 h in a 7-ml PTFE-lined acid-digestion bomb, to result in large quantities of colourless crystals. The initial and final pH values of the reaction mixture were ~ 4 and ~ 3 respectively. 2.1c [H3NCH2CH(NH3)CH3]3[Fe6 III(HAsO4)6(AsO4)2 (C2O4)3], III: 0⋅297 g of iron(II)oxalate dihydrate was dissolved in 4 ml of millipore water. To this, 1⋅249 g of H3AsO4 and 0⋅28 ml of 1,2-diaminopropane (1,2-DAP) (99%) were added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 min. at room temperature. The final mixture with the composition, 1⋅5 FeC2O4⋅2H2O : 8 H3AsO4 : 3 (1,2-DAP) : 200 H2O, was heated at 150°C for 3 days in a 23-ml PTFE-lined acid- digestion bomb, to result in large quantities of col- ourless crystals. The initial and final pH of the reac- tion mixture was ~ 2 and there was no appreciable change in the pH during the reaction. 2.1d [C5N2H14][FeII 4(HPO3)2(C2O4)3], IV: 0⋅177 g of Fe-powder was dispersed in 7 ml of deionised water. To this, 0⋅521 g of H3PO3, 0⋅400 g of oxalic acid and 0⋅318 g of homopiperazine were added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 min at room temperature. The final mixture with the composition, Hydrothermal methods in the synthesis of novel open-framework materials 527 1⋅0 Fe : 2⋅0 H3PO3 : 1⋅0 oxalic acid : 1⋅0 Homopipera- zine : 122 H2O, was heated successfully at 125°C for 96 h, 150°C for 48 h and 180°C for 24 h in a 23-ml teflon-lined acid-digestion bomb to result in mild yellow-coloured crystals. The initial and final pH of the reaction mixture was ~ 2. 2.1e {Gd(H2O)3Co[C5N1H3(COO)2]3}, V: 0⋅343 g of Gd(NO3)3 and 0⋅251 g of Co(OAc)2⋅4H2O were dissolved in 14 ml deionised water. To this, 0⋅337 g of pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (Py-2,3-acid) was added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 min at room temperature. The final mixture with the com- position, 1 Gd(NO3)3 : 1 Co(OAc)2⋅4H2O : 2(Py-2,3- acid) : 780 H2O, was heated at 140°C for 72 h in a 23-ml PTFE-lined acid-digestion bomb to result in large quantities of pink-coloured crystals. 2.1f {Zn(H2O)2[C5N1H3(COO)2]}⋅H2O, VI: 0⋅143 g of ZnSO4⋅7H2O was dispersed on 3 ml of deionised water. To this, 0⋅085 g of pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (Py-2,5-acid), 0⋅02g of NaOH, 0⋅079 g of 4,4′- bipyridine and 0⋅03 ml of triethyl amine (TEA) were added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 min at room temperature.

In all the cases, the products were filtered under vacuum and washed thoroughly using deionised water and dried at ambient conditions. In most of the cases, the yield of the solid phase product was ~ 70– 80% based on the metal source. 2.2 Single crystal structure determination A suitable single crystal of I–VI was carefully selec- ted and glued to a thin glass fibre. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker AXS Smart Apex CCD diffractometer at 293(2) K. The X-ray generator was operated at 50 kV and 35 mA using MoKα (λ = 0⋅71073 Å) radiation. Data were collected with ω scans of width 0⋅3°. A total of 606 frames were collected in three different settings of ϕ (0, 90, 180°) keeping the sample-to-detector distance fixed at 6⋅03 cm and the detector position (2θ) fixed at –25°. Pertinent experimental details of the structure determination of all the compounds are presented in tables 1 and 2. The data were reduced using SAINTPLUS,5 and an empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program.6 The crystal structure was solved and refined using SHELX-97 present in the WinGx suit of program (version 1.63.04a).7 The hydro- gen atom on the P–H group of compound I and IV and the hydrogen positions of the amine molecules of I–III compounds were initially located in the dif- ference Fourier map. Due to the disorder of the amine molecules in IV, we have not been able to locate the hydrogen atoms. All the other hydrogen atoms were located in the difference Fourier map and for the final refinement the hydrogen atoms were placed in geo- metrically ideal positions and refined using the rid- ing mode. The last cycles of refinements included atomic positions, anisotropic thermal parameters for all the non-hydrogen atoms and isotropic thermal parameters for all the hydrogen atoms. Full-matrix- least-squares structure refinement against |F|2 was carried out using the WINGX package of programs.8 2.3 Examples of the use of hydrothermal method 2.3a Simple inorganic network structures: As des- cribed above, we have prepared a cobalt phosphite, [CoII(C10H8N2)(H2PO3)2], I, and a zinc arsenate, [C6N3H20][ZnII 2(AsO4)(HAsO4)2]⋅2H2O, II, possess- ing open structures. In the structure of I, there are two P and one Co atoms in the asymmetric unit that are crystallographically independent. The Co(1) is octahedrally coordinated to four oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms of the 4,4′-bipyridine molecule. One of the oxygen atoms, [O(3)], is three-coordinated connecting two Co and a P centre. The Co–O/N bond distances are in the range of 2⋅052(3) – 2⋅197(3) Ö [av.(Co–O/N) = 2⋅146 Ö@ DQG WKH 21–Co–O/N bond angles are in the range of 80⋅73(11)–175⋅17(11)° [av. (O/N–Co–O/N) = 106⋅74°]. The cobalt atom is connected to two distinct phosphorous atoms through Co–O–P bonds. Of the two P atoms, the P(1) atom is connected to the cobalt atom via one P–O–Co bond and possess two terminal P–O linkages, while P(2) is connected by two P–O–Co bonds and possesses one terminal P–O bond. The P–O bond distances are in the range of 1⋅484(3)–1⋅550(3) Å [av. (P–O) = 1⋅521 Å] and the O–P–O bond angles are in the range of 107⋅61(16)–117⋅2(15)° [av. (O–P–O) = 111⋅77°]. The charge-balancing criterion requires the presence of two protons associated with the P–O bonds.

Thus, the phosphite groups are actu- ally H2PO3 units. The selected bond distances are presented in table 3. The structure of I consists of a network of CoO4N2 octahedra and H2P(2)O3 units. The Co octahedra share two oxygen atoms, [O(3)], forming an edge- shared dimer, Co2O6N4. This dimer units are con- nected through their vertices with the H2P(2)O3 units giving rise to four-membered rings, which are con- nected together forming a one-dimensional ladder- like chain structure (figure 1a). The H2P(1)O3 units bond with the one-dimensional chains through the three-coordinated oxygen, O(3), atom. To our know- ledge, a one-dimensional chain of this type has not been observed before. The one-dimensional ladder- like chains are connected by 4,4′-bipyridine ligands forming a two-dimensional layered structure (figure 1b). The connectivity involving the 4,4′-bipyridine has been known in the literature.10–12 The structure of zinc arsenate, [C6N3H20] [ZnII 2(AsO4)(HAsO4)2]⋅2H2O, II consists of a net- work of ZnO4 and AsO3(OH) tetrahedral units, linked together giving rise to a two-dimensional structure. The zinc atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated by oxygen atom neighbours with an average Zn–O bond lengths 1⋅946 Å and O–Zn–O bond angles are in the range 97⋅0(3)–119⋅8(3)° [av. O–Zn–O bond angle = 109⋅3°]. The Zn atoms are connected to the As atoms by Zn– O–As linkages with an average Zn–O–As bond angles of 127⋅17°. Of the three arsenic atoms, As(2) and As(3) make three As–O–Zn bonds and posses as one terminal linkage, and As(1) makes four As–O–Zn bonds. The As–O distances are in the range 1⋅651(6)– 1⋅711(6) Å [av. As(1)–O = 1⋅68 Å] and O–As–O bond angles have an average value of 109⋅4°. The terminal As(1)–O(4) and As(2)–O(8) bonds with distances of 1⋅723 and 1⋅688 Å respectively, are –OH groups. The total negative charge on the framework of –3 is balanced by the presence of one fully protonated Hydrothermal methods in the synthesis of novel open-framework materials 529 Table 2.

Selec- ted bond distances are listed in table 3. The structure is formed by strictly alternating ZnO4 and AsO3(OH) tetrahedral units, connected through their vertices forming one-dimensional ladder-like structure. The one-dimensional ladders are further bonded through the four-membered rings giving rise to a layer structure with apertures bound by 8-T atoms (T = Zn, As). The tetrahedral AsO3(OH) groups, which are bonded to the Zn atom, hang from the layer and protrude into the inter-lamellar region within which the protonated amine molecules also reside (figure 2). Similar structural arrangements have been observed in open-framework zinc phosphate structures.13 The protonated organic amine molecules along with the lattice water molecules are located in the inter- lamellar region as shown in figure 3. Multipoint hy- drogen bonding is important in low-dimensional solids for the structural stability. Since the compounds con- tains pendant As–OH and As = O bonds, they can participate in hydrogen-bond interactions. Large number of hydrogen bonds involving organic amine, lattice water and framework oxygen atoms have been observed in II. 2.3b Inorganic-organic hybrid network structures: As part of our continuing search for new materials with novel structures, we have also prepared com- pounds containing two different anions, one derived purely from an inorganic source and the other from organic. Thus, we have compounds containing oxalate units as part of the network along with phosphite and arsenate anions. The structure of the iron oxalate-arsenate, [NH3(CH2)CH(NH3)CH3]3 [Fe6(AsO4)2(HAsO4)6(C2O4)3], III, consists of a network of FeO6 octahedral, AsO4 tetrahedral and C2O4 units linked together giving rise to a three-dimensional structure. The Fe atoms are coordinated to six oxygen atom neighbours with four short and two longer Fe– O distances.

The O–Fe–O bond angles are in the range 87⋅05(11) –174⋅35(12)°. While all the FeO6 vertices are shared with either the As or C atoms through the oxygen linkages, only three of the vertices of the AsO4 units are shared, the remaining ones being either As = O or As–OH bonds. The As atoms have tetrahedral coordination with As–O distances in the range 1⋅664(3)–1⋅717(3) Å [av. 1⋅685 Å for As(1) and 1⋅682 Å for As(2), respectively]. The O–As–O bond angles are in the range 105⋅09(9)–114⋅80(14)° (av. 109⋅3°). The C–O bond distances and O–C–O bond angles are in the range expected for this type of bond- ing. Selected bond distances are given in table 3. The framework consists of FeO6, AsO4, HAsO4 and C2O4 moieties. Connectivity between the FeO6, AsO4 and HAsO4 polyhedral units leads to an inorganic layer of formula [Fe3(HAsO4)3(AsO4)], with the FeO6 and AsO4 tetrahedra strictly alternating within the Figure 1. (a) Structure of I, showing the one- dimensional ladder-like chains. Note that the H2PO3 group hangs from the three-coordinated oxygen atoms of the chain. (b) Figure shows the connectivity between the one-dimensional chains and 4,4′-bipyridine units giving rise to a two-dimensional layer. layer. The layers are porous, encompassing a circular 12-membered ring as shown in figure 4; this layer is topologically identical to that seen in the porous aluminophosphate based upon the Al3P4O16 3– ion, with which it shares the same space group, P-3c1 14 (note that other layered aluminum phosphates with the Al3P4O16 3– stoichiometry are based entirely on tetrahedral nets).15 The architecture of III has also been seen in an iron oxalatophosphate.16 The 12-membered pores within the layers are surrounded by 4-membered rings, of which there are two distinct types. In one set of these rings, the arsenic atoms are part of the wall of the 12-membered ring, while in the other an arsenate group caps a six-membered ring and alter- nates above and below the plane of the inorganic layers (figure 4). The layers are arranged in AAAA… fashion and are held in place by oxalate pillars. The Figure 2. (a) Polyhedral view of the structure of II in the ab plane. Note the presence of the hanging arsenate groups. (b) Figure shows the T-atom (T = Zn, P) connec- tivity within the layer. Srinivasan Natarajan et al 532 oxalate units are coordinated to the iron centres and connect the adjacent layers (figure 5). The negative charge of the framework of the iron oxalatoarsenate, III, is compensated by the 1,2-diam- moniumpropane cations. Within the structure of III, the porous layers are arranged exactly one over the other, giving rise to a supermesh of apertures. The organic amine molecules, which are disordered in III, occupy the one-dimensional channels that are oriented perpendicular to the inorganic sheets. This results in completely filled channels and no adsorp- tion behaviour was observed. While the structure of III is closely related to that of the iron oxalatophos- phate, [NH3(CH2)2NH3]3[Fe6(PO4)2(HPO4)6(C2O4)3]⋅ H2O (x = 3–4), reported earlier,16 the 1,2-dia- minopropane in III is replaced by ethylenediamine and labile water. The replacement of larger amines by smaller ones plus water has been observed in other systems, such as open framework gallium phos- phates.17 The asymmetric unit of IV contains 19 non-hydro- gen atoms of which two Fe and one P atoms are Figure 3.

The Fe(1) atoms are octahedrally coordinated with respect to oxygen atoms with average distances of 2⋅131 and 2⋅115 Å respectively. The O–Fe–O bond angle are in the range 76⋅48(9)–166⋅92(9)°. The iron atoms are connected to a phosphorous atom through Fe–O–P bonds and to oxalate groups through Fe–O–C bonds with average bond angle of 130⋅42 and 118⋅16° respectively. The iron atoms are also connected to each other through three-coordinated oxygen atoms [O(3) and O(4)] with average Fe–O–Fe bond angle of 101⋅07°. The P atoms are connected to the iron atom via three Fe– O–P bond and possess one terminal P–H bond. The P–O bond distances are in the range of 1⋅503(2)– 1⋅531(3) Å [av. (P–O) = 1⋅520 Å] and the O–P–O bond angles are in the range of 110⋅60(13)–112⋅88(14)° [av. (O–P–O) = 111⋅61°]. The structure of IV is built up from a linkage in- volving the FeO6 octahedra, the HPO3 pseudo- tetrahedra and the oxalate units. The iron atoms are connected to each other through two three-coordinated oxygen atoms [O(3) and O(4)] forming a edge-shared dimer, Fe2O10, and the dimers are linked through their corners, involving another three-coordinate oxygen atom [O(6)], giving rise to infinite one-dimensional helical chains of Fe–O–Fe (figure 6a). The phosphite units are grafted to these chains forming a one- dimensional structure as shown in figure 6b. The oxalate moieties bond with the iron centre through in-plane connectivity forming a hybrid layer and by out-of-plane connectivity with the layer to form the Figure 4.

Similar connectivity has been observed before in oxalatephosphite18 and oxalatophosphate structures.19 The organic amine molecule occupy the middle of the channels formed by this connectivity. Figure 7. The connectivity between Fe and oxalate units forming the iron oxalate three-dimensional struc- ture. The piperazine molecules occupy the channels. From the structural point of view, the structure of IV presents many unique features. The first and foremost is the presence of infinite one-dimensional helical Fe–O–Fe chains. Though infinite Fe–O–Fe chains have been observed before in ironphos- phates,20 such a structural feature has not been com- monly observed in inorganic–organic hybrid structures. Secondly, the connectivity between the phosphite Srinivasan Natarajan et al 534 units and Fe–O–Fe chains give rise to a one-dimen- sional tancoite-like structure. Tancoite structure has the general formula, [M(TO4)2ϕ]n (M is an octahe- drally coordinated element, T is a tetrahedrally coor- Figure 8.

It has been observed that the one- dimensional iron phosphates, in general, form with the tancoite structure.21 2.3c Coordination polymer structures: We have prepared mixed metal (3d–4f ) coordination polymer of the formula, {Gd(H2O)3Co[C5N1H3(COO)2]3}, V. The asymmetric unit of V consists 15 non-hydrogen atoms, of which one gadolinium atom and one co- balt atom are crystallographically independent. The Gd+3 and the Co+3 are located in special positions with a site occupancy of 0⋅33, respectively (Gd+3 oc- cupies the 1c site and Co+3 occupies the 1a site). Gd+3 ions are bonded with nine nearest neighbour oxygen atoms and have a tricapped trigonal pris- matic geometry. Of the nine oxygen atoms, three oxygen atoms belong to the terminal water mole- cules and six to the carboxylate oxygen atoms. The Co+3 ions have an octahedral geometry formed by three carboxylate oxygen atoms and three nitrogen atoms of the pyridine ring. The average distances of 2⋅45 Å for the Gd–O and 1⋅88 Å and 1⋅99 Å for the Co–O and Co–N bonds respectively, result from this connectivity. The O–Gd–O bond angles are in the range 52⋅7(2)–149⋅0(3)° and the O/N–Co–O/N bond angles are in the range 84⋅5(3)–173⋅8(3)°. The selected bond distances are listed in table 3. There is only one type of pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylate anion present in the structure. The two carboxylate units of the pyridine-2,3- dicarboxylate show differences in the connectivity with respect to the Gd+3 and Co+3 ions – one having a monodentate connectivity with the Co+3 ions and Figure 10. View of the structure of VI in the ab plane showing a single layer. Hydrothermal methods in the synthesis of novel open-framework materials 535 the other a bis-bidentate connectivity with the Gd+3 ions. The nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring is bonded only with the Co+3 ions. The connectivity between the polyhedral units and the pyridine car- boxylate anions give rise to a two-dimensional neu- tral layered structure with large apertures bound by 12-membered ring (3GdO9, 3CoO3N3 and six pyri- dine dicarboxylate) (figure 8). The layers are ar- ranged in AAAA… fashion, giving rise to a solid with a supermesh of apertures of ~ 7 Å free diameter (figure 9). The water molecules, bound to Gd, take part in strong hydrogen bond interactions with the neighbouring non-bonded terminal oxygen atom of the carboxylate (O … O distance = 2⋅85 Å). Such is the disposition of the water molecules within the apertures that there are specific pockets within the apertures (channels) that are hydrophilic. The asymmetric unit of zinc pyridine-2,5- dicarboxylate, {Zn(H2O)2[C5N1H3(COO)2]}⋅H2O, VI, contains 16 non-hydrogen atoms, of which one zinc atom is crystallographically independent. The Zn+2 ions have an octahedral geometry formed by three carboxyalate oxygen atoms, one nitrogen atom of pyridine ring and two oxygen atom of the terminal water molecules. The average distances of 2⋅115 Ö IRU the Zn–O and 2⋅136 Ö IRU WKH =Q–N bonds, result from this connectivity. The O/N–Zn–O/N bond an- gles are in the range 77⋅8(12)–173⋅21(10)°. The selec- ted bond distances are listed in table 2. There is only one type of pyridine-2,5-dicarboxy- late anion present in the structure. The two carboxylate units of the pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylate show differ- ences in their connectivity with respect to the Zn+2 ions. Thus, the carboxylate group that is the nearest to the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring has a mono- dentate connectivity while the other carboxylate group has a bis-bidentate connectivity with the Zn+2 ions. The connectivity between the ZnO5N octahe- dra and the pyridine carboxylate anions gives rise to a two-dimensional neutral layer structure as shown in figure 10. 3. Concluding remarks The use of hydrothermal methods over the past years has enabled the discovered of many novel materials possessing channels and other features of potential technological applications. It is significant that one is in a somewhat better position today to design these structures based on the understanding of the proc- esses involved in their formation. We are, however, far from being able rationally to design materials with the desired dimensionality or porosity. There is still much to be done to unravel fully the role of the amine and the process(s) involved in the assembly of complex three-dimensional structures from sim- pler units. One feature that has become apparent is that the formation of open-framework structures is not slow and step-wise throughout, but is likely to involve the spontaneous assembly of preformed units. There is still considerable scope to explore newer structures possessing novel properties such as ferromagnetic channels. It would be of great value if one can find ways to remove the amines present in the channels or between the layers in the open-frame- work structures. These are some of the challenges at present, but it is clear that the use of hydrothermal technique for the preparation of inorganic com- pounds continues to be interesting.
