Manuscript ORIGINAL PAPER New Co(II) Metal–Organic Coordination Polymers with 9,10-Bis(triazol-1-ylmethyl)anthracene (L): Synthesis and Crystal Structures Wen-Wu Ge • Jian-Zhong Fan • Jian-Bin Zhang • Tian Li • Duo-Zhi Wang Received: 5 April 2009 / Accepted: 26 September 2011 / Published online: 12 October 2011  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract Single crystals of L [L = 9,10-bis(triazol-1- ylmethyl)anthracene] and a new Co(II) metal coordination polymers with ligand L, [Co(L)2Cl2]? were synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, IR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 has one- dimensional (1-D) chain structure, and was further linked into inﬁnite three-dimensional (3-D) supramolecular sheets by inter-chain C–HCl weak interactions. In 1, the Co(II) ion is four-coordinated to two nitrogen atoms of two dis- tinct L ligand and two chlorine atoms to form a distorted tetrahedral geometry, L adopts a trans-gauche conforma- tion with the shortest NN distance between the two N donors. Keywords Co(II) complex  Synthesis  Crystal structure  One-dimensional chain Introduction Triazole and its derivatives are potential multitopic ligands in constructions of coordination complexes [1]. 1,2,4-Triazole and its derivatives are very interesting ligands because they combine the coordination geometry of both pyrazoles and imidazoles with regard to the arrange- ment of their three heteroatoms. A large number of mononuclear, oligonuclear, and polynuclear metal coordi- nation compounds with 1,2,4-triazole derivatives have been prepared and characterized because of their interest- ing luminescence properties and novel topologies [2]. Previously, we reported a series of anthracene-triazole ligand, 9,10-bis(triazol-1-ylmethyl)anthracene with d10 metal coordination polymers with better luminescence properties [3]. Hou [4, 5] and Li [6–8] et al. have initially reported many coordination complexes of 1,4-bis(1,2,4- triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene. Herein we report synthesis and structural characteriza- tion of L [9,10-Bis(triazol-1-ylmethyl)anthracene] and a new Co(II) metal coordination polymer with ligand L, [Co(L)2Cl2]? was synthesized and structurally character- ized by elemental analyses, IR spectroscopy and single- crystal X-ray diffraction. This paper reports on the results of an X-ray structural investigation of ligand L and com- plex [Co(L)2Cl2]?, Chart 1. Experimental Section Materials and General Methods All the reagents required for the synthesis were commer- cially available and employed without further puriﬁcation. The ligand L was synthesized according to the literature procedure [3]. IR spectra were measured on a TENSOR 27 (Bruker) FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets in the range 4000–400 cm-1. Elemental analyses of C, H and N were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C analyzer. W.-W. Ge  J.-Z. Fan  T. Li  D.-Z.

(1) A solution of CuCl22H2O (17 mg, 0.10 mmol) in CH3OH (8 mL) was layered onto a solution of L (34 mg, 0.10 mmol) in CHCl3 (8 mL). The system was left for about 2 weeks at room temperature, and blue crystals were obtained. Yield: *30%. Anal. Calcd for C20H16Cl2CoN6: C, 51.08; H, 3.43; N, 17.87.

X-Ray Crystallography X-ray single-crystal diffraction data for L and complex 1 were collected on a Bruker Smart 1000 CCD diffrac- tometer at 293(2) K with Mo–Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) by x -uscan mode. The program SAINT [9] was used for integration of the diffraction proﬁles. Semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied using SADABS pro- gram. All the structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS program of the SHELXTL package and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares methods with SHELXL [10]. Metal atoms in each complex were located from the E-maps and other non-hydrogen atoms were located in successive difference Fourier syntheses and reﬁned with anisotropic thermal parameters on F2. Hydrogen atoms of carbon were included in calculated positions and reﬁned with ﬁxed thermal parameters riding on their parent atoms. Crystallographic data and experimental details for struc- tural analyses are summarized in Table 1. The crystal data ﬁle in CIF format was deposited on CCDC (No.: 690535 for L, 690536 for 1).

Results and Discussion The compound of L crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c and the selected bond distances and angles were listed in Table 2. As is shown in Fig. 1a, The two triazole rings are also parallel to each other in the same ligand, the mean deviations from the planes of triazole are ca. 0.0007 and 0.0019 A˚ , respectively. The dihedral angle between planes of two triazole rings is 0.1. The mean deviation from the plane of anthracene is ca. 0.0037 A˚ . In complex 1, the ligand L geometry has nearly no any structural variations compared with dissociative ligand L. In compared with the complexes of ligand L we reported [3], in all complexes the ligand L adopt a trans- gauche conformation. Intramolecular and/or intermolecular weak interactions play an important role in the formation of these complexes, especially in stability of the complex 1. Complex 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcn. The selected bond distances and angles were listed in Table 2. The X-ray diffraction analysis shows that 1 has an inﬁnite 1-D chain structure and all the Co(II) centers and L in 1 are equivalent (see Fig. 2a). The Co(II) center is linked to two distinct triazole N donors of two L ligands [Co–N = 2.008(3) A˚ ] and to two chlorine atom [Cu–Cl = 2.2351(13) A˚ ] in a distorted tetrahedral geom- etry with the non-bonding Co_Co distance connected by L being 15.151 A˚ .

For each ligand, the dihedral angle between the planes of triazole and anthracene rings is 69.9. It should be pointed out that two triazole rings are also parallel to each other in the same ligand, the mean deviations from the planes of triazole and anthracene are ca. 0.0036 and 0.0232 A˚ , respectively. In addition, the C–HCl weak interactions were observed between adjacent chains. Therefore, such chains were further assembled by the C–HCl weak interactions between adjacent chains into an inﬁnite 3-D supramolecular sheet (Fig. 2c).
