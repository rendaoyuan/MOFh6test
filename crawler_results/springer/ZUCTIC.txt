Within 1, the CuN2O4 octahedra are inter- linked by DBrS2- anions in a l2-j2OO0:j2O00O000 coordination mode to form 1 1[Cu(bipy)(DBrS)2/2] chains, which are further assembled into 2D supramolecular layers by interchain pp stacking interactions. In 2, the six- coordinated Co2? ions are bridged by DBrS2- anions in a l2-jO:jO0 fashion to form 1 1[Co(bipy)(H2O)2(DBrS)2/2] polymer chains and the adjacent 1D chains interconnected by weak C–HO hydrogen bonds to construct 2D supra- molecular layers. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility shows that 2 obeys Curie–Weiss law vm = C/(T - H) with C = 2.16 cm3 K mol-1 and H = -0.40 K and the best ﬁt gave a weak antiferromagnetic coupling (J = -0.89 cm-1) among Co2? ions. Results about infrared spectra and elemental analyses are also presented. Graphical Abstract In the present paper, we have dis- cussed the syntheses and crystal structures of two metal– organic based 1D polymers of Cu(II) and Co(II) respec- tively, and magnetic behavior in the temperature range 2–300 K of the Co(II) compound. The compounds feature 1D chains based on bridging dibromosucciniato. The Cu(II) compound represents the ﬁrst example of meso-2,3- dibromosuccinic acid coordination polymers that exhibit l2-j2OO0:j2O00O000 coordination mode. F. Jiang  W.-D. Weng  Y.-Q.

By judicious choice of metal ion and organic ligands, control over the desired structural motifs and properties can be achieved [9–11]. Carboxylic acids have been widely used not only serve to link metal cations into higher dimensionalities but also to permit for- mation of a large number of neutral metal–organic coordi- nation polymer frameworks [12–14]. Although aromatic dicarboxylates have been the most commonly used anionic linkers due to their rigid structure [15, 16], there has been an increasing trend toward the synthesis of coordination poly- mers containing conformationally ﬂexible aliphatic dicar- boxylate ligands [17–19]. For example, four-carbon chain dicarboxylic acids such as succinic acid and tartaric acid are good candidates for the construction of open metal organic frameworks [13, 20, 21]. 2,3-dibromosuccinic acid (H2DBrS) is a four-carbon chain dicarboxylic acids, so it has a rich coordination chemistry and can help to construct multidimensional coordination polymers by acting as a mul- tidentate bridging linker. However, exploration of H2DBrS as ligand to construct the coordination polymer is quite rare. Hitherto, only four metal H2DBrS complexes [Sn(C4H9)3 (DBrS)1/2], [Sb2(C6H5)6(DBrS)(CH3O)2], [Cu2(DBrS)2(hmt) (H2O)4]1/22H2O and [Ni(DBrS)(H2O)2]1/2[Ni(DBrS)(hmt) (H2O)2]1/22H2O were reported [22–24]. The DBrS2- anions exhibit interesting coordination modes (Scheme 1) in the limited complexes known. In this contribution, we report syntheses, crystal structures, and properties of two Cu(II) and Co(II) coodination polymers, Cu(bipy)(DBrS) 1 and Co(bipy)(H2O)2(DBrS) 2, resulting from reaction of metal ions and meso-2,3-dibromosuccinic acid (H2DBrS) in the presence of 2,20-bipyridine, in an aqueous methanolic solution. Experimental Section Synthesis of Cu(bipy)(DBrS) 1 Dropwise addition of 2.0 ml (1.0 M) NaOH aqueous so- lution to an aqueous methanolic solution of 0.2747 g (1.0 mmol) H2DBrS in 10.0 ml CH3OH/H2O (1:1, v/v), to which 0.2003 g (1.0 mmol) Cu(CH3COO)2H2O dissolved in 20.0 ml CH3OH/H2O (1:1, v/v) was dropwise added and stirred for 30 min. Then 0.1549 g (1.0 mmol) bipy was added the mixture to give purple precipitate, which was separated by ﬁlter. The blue ﬁltrate (pH = 6.37) was al- lowed to stand at room temperature for slow evaporation for several weeks, which afforded purple needle-like crystal (yield: 93 % based on the initial Cu(CH3COO)2H2O input).

Synthesis of Co(bipy)(H2O)2(DBrS) 2 2.0 ml (1.0 M) NaOH aqueous solution was added to an aqueous methanolic solution of 0.2798 g (1.0 mmol) H2DBrS in 10.0 ml CH3OH/H2O (1:1, v/v), which was dropwise added to an aqueous methanolic solution of 0.2448 g (1.0 mmol) CoCl26H2O in 20.0 ml CH3OH/H2O (1:1, v/v) to give a red solution. Then 0.1579 g (1.0 mmol) bipy was added to the mixture to give an orange solution (pH = 5.83). Slow evaporation for 3 months afforded orange block-like crystals (yield: 66 % based on the initial CoCl26H2O input). Anal. Calc. for C14H14Br2CoN2O6: C, 32.03 %; H, 2.69 %; N, 5.34 %.

The C, H and N microanalyses were performed with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 elemental analyzer. The IR spectra were recorded using KBr pellets in the range 4000–400 cm-1 with a Shimadzu FTIR 8900 spectrometer. Single crystal data were collected on a Rigaku R-Axis Rapid IP X-ray diffractometer using Mo target (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). Magnetic data were obtained on crystalline samples with a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design Model MPMS-7) in the temperature range 2–300 K. X–ray Crystallography Suitable crystals of 1 and 2 were selected under a polarizing microscope and ﬁxed with epoxy cement on glass ﬁbers which were mounted on a Rigaku R-Axis Rapid IP X-ray diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka ra- diation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) for cell determination and subse- quent data collection. The reﬂection intensities in an appropriate h range (3.46–27.42 for 1 and 3.27–27.45 for 2) were collected at 295 K using the x scan technique. The data were corrected for Lp effects and empirical absorption. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 program and reﬁned with SHELXL-97 pro- gram [25]. The rest non-hydrogen atoms in the structures were located in the subsequent difference Fourier syntheses. The methylene group in meso-2,3-dibromosucciniato ligand of compound 2 is isordered in two sites with occupancies of 0.5 and 0.5. All hydrogen atoms associated with carbon atoms are geometrically generated, and the rest of the hy- drogen atoms are located from the successive difference Fourier syntheses. All non-hydrogen atoms are reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters by the full-matrix least- squares technique and hydrogen atoms with isotropic dis- placement parameters set to 1.2 times of the values for the associated heavier atoms. A summary of the key crystallo- graphic information is given in Table 1 and the main data of bond distances and bond angles are showed in Tables 2, 3. Results and Discussion Syntheses Under ambient conditions, Cu(CH3COO)2H2O and CoCl2 6H2O reacted with H2DBrS and NaOH in the presence of bipy in an aqueous methanolic solution, yielding Cu(bipy) (DBrS) 1 and Co(bipy)(H2O)2(DBrS) 2, respectively. The above reactions can be schematized as follows (Scheme 2): The products were conﬁrmed to be phase pure since the experimental powder X-ray diffraction patterns (Figs. 1, 2) match well with the simulated one based on the single crystal data. Description of the Crystal Structures Cu(bipy)(DBrS) 1 Compound 1 crystallizes in a centric space group C2/c (no. 15) and the asymmetric unit consists of one Cu2? cation, one bipy molecule and one dibromosuccinic anion. As demon- strated in Fig. 3, each of the Cu atoms is coordinated to two nitrogen atoms from one chelating bipy ligand and two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two crystallographically different dibromosuccinic anions to form distorted CuN2O4 octahedra of ‘‘4 ? 2’’ coordination type due to Jahn–Teller effect [26]. The equatorial positions are occupied by two O atoms of two carboxylate groups and two N atoms of two Table 1 Summary of crystal data, data collection, structure and re- ﬁnement details for 1 and 2 Compounds 1 2 Empirical formula C14H10Br2CuN2O4 C14H14Br2CoN2O6 Formula weight 493.59 525.02 Description Blue, block Black, block Crystal size (mm) 0.09 9 0.12 9 0.20 0.37 9 0.35 9 0.10 Temperature (K) 295(2) 295(2) Crystal system Monoclinic Orthorhombic Space group C2/c P21212 a (A˚ ) 11.630(2) 9.054(3) b (A˚ ) 11.447(2) 11.525(2) c (A˚ ) 12.527(3) 8.601(2) a () 90 90 b () 114.51(3) 90 c () 90 90 Volume (A˚ 3) 1517.4(5) 897.5(3) Z 4 2 Dcalc (g cm-3) 2.161 1.943 F(000) 956 514 l (mm-1) 6.726 5.440 h range (deg) 3.56–27.42 3.27–27.45 Reﬂections collected 7271 8781 Unique reﬂections (Rint) 913 1517 Data, restraints, parameters 1723, 2, 105 2042, 13, 132 Goodness of ﬁt on F2 1.156 1.141 R1, wR2 [I C 2r(I)]a 0.0789, 0.1502 0.0530, 0.1138 R1, wR2 (all data)a 0.1512, 0.1753 0.0752, 0.1524 A, B values in wb 0.0410, 19.2176 0.0490, 1.7206 dqmax, dqmin (e A˚ -3) 0.934, –0.755 1.118, –1.026 a R1 = P(|Fo| - |Fc|)/P|Fo|, wR2 = [Pw(Fo 2 - Fc 2)2/Rw(Fo 2)2]1/2 b w = [r2(Fo 2) ?

Each carboxylate of DBrS anions chelates one metal ion as a bidentate ligand. The DBrS ligands bridge the CuN2O4 octahedra and form 1D zigzag chains formulated as 1 1[Cu(bipy)(DBrS)2/2]. The 2,20-bipyridine have interchain pp stacking interactions (mean interplanar bipy-to-bipy distance: 3.689(4) A˚ ), assembling the 1D zigzag chains into 2D supramolecular layers as shown in Fig. 4. Co(bipy)(H2O)2(DBrS) 2 Compound 2 crystallizes in a chiral space group P21212 (no. 18) and the asymmetric unit of 2 contains one Co2? ion, one bipy molecule, one dibromosuccinic anion and two water molecules. As depicted in Fig. 3, each Co atom is in a distorted octahedral coordination environment sur- rounded by two nitrogen atoms of one chelating bipy li- gand and four oxygen atoms of two water molecules at the trans positions and two dibromosucciniato groups. The Co– N bond distances are of 2.155(4) A˚ . The transoid O–Co–O angle exhibits less deviation from linearity than both transoid O–Co–N angles do (Table 3). Owing to the small bite N–Co–N angle of 76.32(2) A˚ , the cisoid O–Co–O angle is substantially widened to 165.79(21) A˚ . The Co atoms are bridged by dibromosucciniato ligands to form 1D linear chains formulated as 1 1[Co(bipy)(H2O)2(DBrS)2/2] (Fig. 5). The coordinating water molecules donate hydro- gen atoms to the non-coordinating dibromosucciniato O2 Fig. 3 ORTEP view of coordination environments around Cu with atom labeling for 1 (displacement ellipsoids are drawn at 45 % probability level; hydrogens are omitted for clarity). Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms: #1 = -x, y, -z ? 1/2; #2 = x - 1/2,  - y, z - 1/2; #3 = 1/2 - x, 1/2 - y, 1 - z Fig. 4 Assemblies of 1D 1 1[Cu(bipy)(DBrS)2/2] polymeric chains via p    p stacking interactions (dashed lines) into 2D layer for 1 138 J Chem Crystallogr (2015) 45:134–141 123 atoms to form relatively strong intrachain hydrogen bonds. The polymeric chains are arranged in such a way that each bipy ligand of one chain enters the void space ﬂanked by two neighboring dibromosucciniato groups of the adjacent chain and the bipy ligands donate hydrogen atoms to the non-coordinating O2 atoms to form interchain C–HO hydrogen bonds, yielding 2D layers (Fig. 6). Unexpected- ly, no pp stacking interactions are present in 2 and the resulting 2D layers are stacked to form 3D network structure in a sequence ABABA to meet the require- ments for close-packing. Infrared Spectra As illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, the infrared spectrum of 2 shows characteristic broad bands centered at about 3440 and 3235 cm-1 due to –OH stretch of water molecules. Very strong mas(–COO-) band appears at 1631 and 1606 cm-1, respectively, for 1, 2, and ms(–COO-) band at 1351 and 1395 cm-1. Dm = mas(–COO-) - ms(–COO-) of 280 and 211 cm-1 indicate that the coordinate modes of the car- boxylate groups are monodentate [27]. Based on the spectra Fig. 5 ORTEP view of coordination environment of Co ions and meso-2, 3-dibromosuccinic Acid with displacement ellipsoids (45 % probability) and atomic labeling in 2 (hydrogens are omitted for clarity). Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms: #1 = -x ? 1, -y, z; #2 = 1/2 - x, 1/2 ? y, -z; #3 = 1/2 - x, 1/2 ? y, 1 - z Fig. 6 2D layer in 2 (dotted lines represent weak interactions) J Chem Crystallogr (2015) 45:134–141 139 123 of 2,20-bipyridine, the absorption peaks of 1 at 1479 and 1455 cm-1 (1482 and 1445 cm-1 for 2) are assigned to the C=N and C=C vibrations of the pyridyl ring, and the out-of- plane C–H vibrations lead to absorptions at 1152–699 cm-1 (1323–649 cm-1 for 2). Absorptions due to Cu–O (Co–O for 2) vibrations appear below 547 cm-1 (581 cm-1 for 2). The IR data are consistent with the crystal structures. Magnetic Property In order to probe the single-molecule magnet (SMM) be- havior in complex 2, the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities of compounds 2 was measured at 1000 Oe in the temperature range 2–300 K. The temperature de- pendence of the magnetic susceptibility of 2 in the form of vMT is displayed in Fig. 6. The value of vMT at 300 K is 2.83 cm3 K mol-1 (4.76 lB), which is higher than the expected value (1.88 cm3 K mol-1, 3.87 lB) of one magnetically isolated high-spin Co(II) ions (S = 3/2, g = 2.0). This caused by an unquenched orbital contribu- tion arising from the 4T1g ground state of Co(II) ion [28]. On lowering the temperature, the vMT value decreases gradually to ca. 2.66 cm3 K mol-1 at 75 K, followed by an abrupt decrease to a maximum value of 1.83 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K, which suggests an overall long-range antiferromagnetic ordering. The magnetic susceptibility in the range 2–300 K obeys the Curie–Weiss law v = C/(T - H) very well with C = 2.16 cm3 K mol-1 and H = -0.40 K. The negative H value suggests weak antiferromagnetic interaction between Co ions. An attempt has been made to ﬁt the vMT results with the magnetic formula for a mononuclear Co(II) complex, calculating the A, B value (A ? B = C = 5Ng2b2 4k), D and J. The formula used is [29, 30]. vmT ¼ A expðD=kTÞ þ B expðJ=kTÞ The best ﬁt of the experimental data of 2 in the whole temperature range, gives A ? B = 2.24 cm3 K mol-1, g = 2.19, D = 28.95 cm-1 and J = -0.89 cm-1, with R = 1.90 9 10-4 (R = P[(vm)obs - (vm)calc]2/[(vm)obs]2). The ﬁtting results indicate that the surrounding of Co(II) is to be descried as a strong-ﬁeld state in a slightly distorted oc- tahedral arrangement, which is consistent with the crystal structure. The small negative J value and positive D values show the presence of weak anti ferromagnetic ordering in this compound via a cooperation of single-ion effects (Fig. 9). Conclusion In the present paper, we have discussed the syntheses and crystal structures of two metal–organic based 1D polymers Fig. 7 The IR spectra for 1 Fig. 8 The IR spectra for 2 Fig. 9 Temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of the title compound 2. Solid lines represent the best ﬁts 140 J Chem Crystallogr (2015) 45:134–141 123 of Cu(II) and Co(II) respectively, and magnetic behavior of the Co(II) compound in the temperature range 2–300 K. Both compounds form 1D polymeric chain structures bridged by the dibromosucciniato ligand. To the best of our knowledge, 1 represents the ﬁrst example of meso-2,3-di- bromosuccinic acid coordination polymers that exhibit l2- j2OO0:j2O00O000 coordination mode. This work provides a good route for further exploration of the preparation of dibromosucciniato bridged coordination polymers. Fur- thermore, the investigation of other transition metal ions dibromosucciniato system is underway.
