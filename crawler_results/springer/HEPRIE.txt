Synthesis, characterization and single crystal structures of one-dimensional coordination polymers formed with [Ni(L)] Æ 2ClO4 and polycarboxylate ligands Ju Chang Kim*, Ju An Kim and Y.C.

Lough Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT M5S 3H6, Canada Byung Min Lee Advanced Chemical Technology Division, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Daejeon 305-600, Korea Received 20 April 2006; accepted 18 May 2006 Abstract Two new one-dimensional coordination polymers {[Ni(L)(maleate)] Æ H2O}n (1) and {[Ni(L)(H2btc)] Æ 2DMF}n (L = cyclam, btc = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate, DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide) (2) have been synthe- sized and structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diﬀraction. In the structures (1) and (2), the carboxylate groups of bridging ligands are coordinated to nickel(II) cyclams resulting in the formation of one-dimensional coordination polymers. In addition to the Ni–O bonds, it is observed that the hydrogen bonding interactions between the pre-organized N–H groups of the cyclams and bridging anions support the formation of coordination polymers in both complexes. Introduction There have been enormous research efforts in the ﬁeld of transition metal coordination polymers during the last decade due to their versatile applications to mate- rial science [1–3]. The construction of coordination polymers is achieved by two major components, name- ly, connectors and linkers. Generally, transition metal ions act as connectors and multidentate ligands as linkers [1]. The important characteristics of connectors are a number of their coordination sites. Depending on the coordination numbers of metal ions, the dimen- sionality of resulting coordination polymers could be controlled. Instead of naked metal ions, it is possible to leave axial sites of metal ions free for linkers for the construction of one-dimensional coordination polymers by blocking equatorial sites with polyaza- macrocycles [4–6]. Among multidentate ligands, poly- carboxylates are especially of interest as linkers because of their various coordination modes toward transition metal ions [7, 8]. Thus, taking advantage of the directionality of nickel(II) polyazamacrocycles to accept ligands through axial sites and the ability of polycarboxylate ligands to coordinate metal ions, we successfully prepared, isolated and characterized two new one-dimensional coordination polymers {[Ni(L) (maleate)] Æ H2O}n (1) and {[Ni(L)(H2btc)] Æ 2DMF}n (2). The structural details and properties of (1) and (2) are discussed in this report. Experimental Materials and methods All chemicals utilized in this investigation were ob- tained from commercial sources and were used with- out further puriﬁcation. Distilled water was used for all procedures. Infrared spectra of solid samples were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000 FT-IR spec- trophotometer between 4000 cm)1 and 400 cm)1 as Nujol mulls on KBr disks. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DTG) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Model TGA-7 Thermogravimetric Analyzer under a nitrogen sweep from 50 to 850 C at a heating rate of 10 C/ min. Elemental analyses were performed by the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Daejeon, Korea. The nickel(II) complex [Ni(L)] Æ 2ClO4 was syn- thesized by previously reported methods [9]. Caution! The perchlorate salts used in this study are potentially explosive and should be handled in small quantities.

A combination of 1 phi and omega (with kappa offsets) scans were used to collect sufﬁcient data. The data frames were integrated and scaled using the Denzo-SMN package [10]. The structure was solved and reﬁned using the SHELXTL\PC V6.1 package [11]. Reﬁnement was performed by full-matrix least squares on F2, using all data (negative intensities included). Hydrogen atoms were included in calculated positions, except for those involving hydrogen bonding – speciﬁcally for the hydrogen atoms of the water molecule and those bonded to the nitrogen atoms, which were reﬁned with isotropic thermal parameters. Crystal data and reﬁne- ment details for (1) and (2) are listed in Table 1. Results and discussion Structures of (1) and (2) The structure of (1), as illustrated in Figure 1, consists of a basic maleato-nickel(II) unit with an included wa- ter molecule. Two independent macrocycles are ob- served in the structure and each nickel atom sits on an inversion center. The coordination environment around the central nickel(II) ion is a distorted octahedron with four Ni–N bonds from the macrocycle and two Ni–O bonds from the maleate ligands. A listing of selected bond distances and angles is given in Table 2. The aver- age Ni–N distance of 2.0695 A˚ is typical for those of octahedral macrocyclic nickel(II) species (Ni–N = 2.07–2.10 A˚ ) [4, 5, 7]. The Ni–O distances are in the range of 2.1146(15) A˚ and 2.1720(15) A˚ . These are comparable to previously reported values Table 1.

There is a slight diﬀerence be- tween the two Ni–O distances which is ascribed to the diﬀerent types of hydrogen bonding interactions in- volved. As two sets of N–H groups of the macrocycle are pre-organized, the profacial selection of maleate an- ion binding via covalent as well as hydrogen bonding interactions is achieved. Thus, the oxygen atom O2 par- ticipates in bifurcated hydrogen bonds by tying two macrocycles (Table 3). The presence of such hydrogen bonding interaction is believed to contribute for the for- mation of the undulated coordination polymer (1). The complex (2) shows a polymeric structure in which the [Ni(L)(H2btc)] Æ 2DMF unit is repeated to form an inﬁnite one-dimensional chain. The asymmet- ric unit of the polymeric structure is described in Fig- ure 2. Two DMF molecules are involved in the crystallization process. The basic macrocyclic skeleton resembles that of (1) with an average Ni–N distance of 2.068 A˚ and a Ni–O distance of 2.1157(13) A˚ . The nickel atom sits on an inversion center. Selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 4. The bridging ligand H2btc is doubly deprotonated from H4btc with two intramolecular hydrogen bonds (Table 5, Scheme 1). The shape, the coordination mode to the nickel(II) ion and hydrogen bonding mode of the present H2btc in (2) is comparable to those found in related {[Ni(L)(H2btc)] Æ 2H2O}n [7] and {[Ni(L)(H2btc)]}n [14] systems. Although the same connectors and linkers are used, the structure of H2btc in (2) is diﬀerent from that of previously reported {[Ni(L)(H2btc)] Æ 2H2O}n [7] in which two carboxylate and carboxylic acid groups do not lie in the aromatic ring plane without intramolecu- lar hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the coordination fash- ion of H2btc toward central metal ion in (2) is totally diﬀerent from that found in{[Ni(L1)(H2btc)]}n, [14] showing that the oxygen atom O1 which is not in- volved in the intramolecular hydrogen bond coordi- nates to the nickel(II) ion (Figure 2).

The Ni–O distance of 2.1157(13) A˚ in (2) is notably shorter than that found in {[Ni(L1)(H2btc)]}n (Ni–O = 2.8311(12) A˚ ) as the coor- dination modes and hydrogen bonding schemes diﬀer. It looks apparent that the shapes, structural parame- ters and coordinating fashions of H2btc are highly dependent on the types of hydrogen bonding interac- tions involved. As is usual with nickel(II) cyclam coordination poly- mers, the complexes (1) and (2) are insoluble in com- mon solvents and retain trans-III conformations about the macrocyclic ligand skeletons. Analytical, spectroscopic and thermal properties of (1) and (2) The microanalytical results for (1) and (2) were con- sistent with the structures determined by X-ray diﬀrac- tion methods. The solid state infrared spectrum of (1) shows strong absorptions at 1657, 1566 cm)1 (mCOO) due to carboxylate groups of the bridging maleate ligand. In addition, weak bands at 3341 cm)1 (mOH), 3219, 3140 cm)1 (mNH) are observed, indicating the presence of the macrocycle and the lattice water molecule. The spectrum of (2) exhibits bands at 3450 cm)1 (mOH), 3218 cm)1 (mNH), 1681 cm)1 (mCO) and 1555 cm)1 (mCOO), clearly supporting the structure determined by X-ray diﬀraction methods. In both complexes, no strong absorptions at 1094 and 621 cm)1 (mCl–O) orig- inating from starting materials are observable. TGA–DTG curves for (1) and (2) further supports the structures determined by X-ray diﬀraction methods (Figure 3). Complex (1) shows a ﬁrst weight loss of 4.6% (calcd. 4.6%) over 88–150 C with endothermic processes centered at 129 C, corresponding to the loss of a molecule of water. On further heating, signiﬁcant weight loss occurs due to the loss of macrocyclic and maleate ligands. For complex (2), the TGA curve shows the loss of two solvated DMF molecules (22.2%, calcd. 22.2%) over 120–177 C with endother- mic processes centered at 150 C. Subsequent loss of macrocyclic and bridging H2btc ligands occurs on fur- ther heating.
