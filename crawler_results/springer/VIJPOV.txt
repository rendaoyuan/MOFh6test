Manuscript Synthesis, crystal structures and properties of four manganese coordination polymers with 4,4-bipyridine-derived ligands Hong-Lin Zhu • Jin-Li Qi • Jian-Li Lin • Wei Xu • Xia-Xia Guo • Yue-Qing Zheng Received: 19 March 2013 / Accepted: 4 June 2013 / Published online: 16 June 2013  Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013 Abstract Four new coordination polymers, namely Mn2(4, 4-bpy)2(o-tol)4 1, Mn2(4,4-bpy)2(m-tol)4 2, Mn2(bpp)2(m-tol)4 3 and {[Mn2(4,4-bpy)2(p-tol)4][Mn(4,4-bpy)2(H2O)2(p-tol)2]} 6H2O 4 have been synthesized from 4,40-bipyridine (4,4-bpy), 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)-propane (bpp), o-toluic acid (o-Htol), m-toluic acid (m-Htol) and p-toluic acid (p-Htol). All four complexes feature dinuclear Mn2(tol)4 moieties, which are bridged by 4,4-bpy or bpp ligands to form 1D double-chain structures. The resulted 1D double-chains are assembled via hydrogen bonding or pp stacking into 2D supramo- lecular layers. The complexes were characterized by physico-chemical (thermal behavior) and infrared spec- troscopy. Variable temperature magnetic characterization suggest weak antiferromagnetic coupling exchange between dimeric Mn(II) centers (J = -0.46 cm-1 for 1, -0.56 cm-1 for 2, -1.28 cm-1 for 3 and -0.59 cm-1 for 4). Introduction Crystal engineering with coordination polymers has attracted great interest in recent years because of their potential applications in magnetism, electrical conductiv- ity, catalysis, separation, gas storage, ion exchange and nonlinear optical materials [1–4]. The design and con- struction of coordination polymers depend mainly on the combination of two factors, speciﬁcally the coordination preferences of the metal center and the nature of the ligands. Thus, the most effective strategies involve judi- cious choices of inorganic building blocks and organic linkers [5–7]. For the construction of such coordination polymers, a variety of benzoic acid derivatives have been employed [4–13]. Carboxylate ligands can adopt different bonding modes, such as monodentate, chelating–bidentate, bridging–bidentate and bridging–multidentate, yielding a variety of coordination polymers ranging from 1D inﬁ- nite chains through 2D layers to 3D networks. However, single carboxylate group ligands such as methylbenzoic acid have been less well studied for constructing coor- dination complexes, since they have only one coordi- nating group. Nevertheless, methylbenzoic acid and its derivatives may prove to be useful building blocks for the construction of coordination polymers with novel topologies or properties. Aromatic N-donor ligands such as 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,20-bipyridine and 4,40-bipyridine have been widely used as auxiliary ligands to tune the dimensionality of the coordination compounds [14–17]. In contrast to 1,10-phe- nanthroline and 2,20-bipyridine, which generally act as terminal ligands, 4,40-bipyridine and analogous bis-pyri- dine-type ligands such as 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)-propane (bpp), can function as bridging ligands capable of forming high- dimensional architectures [6, 18]. In this work, we utilized three methylbenzoic acid isomers with 4,40-bipyridine and 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)-propane to construct four Mn(II) coor- dination polymers.

Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out with a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer to check the phase purity. The C, H, N and S microanalyses were performed with a Perkin–Elmer 2400II CHNO/S elemental analyzer. FT-IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the range 4,000–400 cm-1 on a Shimadzu FTIR-8900 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric measurements were car- ried out from R.T. to 900 C on preweighed samples in a nitrogen stream using a Seiko Exstar 6000 TG/DTA 6300 apparatus with a heating rate of 10 C/min. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku Raxis– Rapid X-ray diffractometer. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities were determined with a Quantum Design SQUID magnetomer (Quantum Design Model MPMS-7) in the temperature range 2–300 K with an applied ﬁeld of 1 KOe. Synthesis of Mn2(4,4-bpy)2(o-tol)4 1 MnCO3 (0.1358 g, 1.0 mmol) and o-toluic acid (0.1137 g, 1.0 mmol) were added to H2O (20 mL), and the reaction mixture was reﬂuxed at 80 C for 6 h, then ﬁltered. An ethanol solution (10 mL) of 4,4-bipyridine (0.0783 g, 0.5 mmol) was added dropwise to the ﬁltrate, and the sample was stirred for 15 min to produce a yellow pre- cipitate. This was ﬁltered off, and the ﬁltrate was allowed to stand at room temperature. Slow evaporation for 2 weeks afforded a small amount of yellow block crystals. Yield: 0.1138 g (24 % based on the initial MnCO3). The phase purity of the product was checked according to powder X-ray diffraction patterns compared with the sim- ulated PXRD based on the single-crystal data (Fig. S1). Anal.

The data were corrected for Lp and absorption effects. The SHELXS-97 and SHELXL- 97 programs were used for structure solution and reﬁne- ment [19]. The respective structures were solved by using direct methods, and all non-hydrogen atoms were located in the subsequent difference Fourier syntheses. After sev- eral cycles of reﬁnement, all hydrogen atoms associated with carbon atoms were geometrically generated, and the water hydrogen atoms in 4 were located from the succes- sive difference Fourier syntheses. Finally, all non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement param- eters by the full-matrix least-squares technique and hydrogen atoms with isotropic displacement parameters set to 1.2 times of the values for the associated heavier atoms. Detailed information about the crystal data and structure determination is summarized in Table 1. Selected inter- atomic distances and bond angles are tabulated in Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5. Results and discussion Syntheses Reaction of MnCO3, toluic acid and 4,4-bipyridine in ethanol–water at 80 C afforded the dinuclear Mn(II) chain complexes Mn2(4,4-bpy)2(o-tol)4 1, Mn2(4,4-bpy)2(m-tol)4 2, and {[Mn2(4,4-bpy)2(p-tol)4][Mn(4,4-bpy)2(H2O)2 (p-tol)2]}6H2O 4, but the yield for 2 was very low. Reaction of freshly prepared Mn(m-tol)2 with 4,4-bipyri- dine at room temperature for 15 h signiﬁcantly enhanced the yield of compound 2. Following a procedure similar to that for 2, substitution of 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)-propane for 4,4-bipyridine, we obtained the binuclear complex Mn2(bpp)2(m-tol)4 3. The above reactions can be schema- tized as in Scheme 1. All the complexes were stable in air and insoluble in water, methanol, ethanol and acetone at room temperature. Crystal structures of the complexes The asymmetric unit of complex 1 consists of two Mn2? centers (Mn1 and Mn2), two 4,4-bpy ligands and four anionic o-methylbenzoate ligands (denoted as o-tol1, o-tol2, o-tol3 and o-tol4, ligands which contain atoms O1, O3, O5 and O7, respectively). Two of the 4,4-bpy ligands function as bis-monodentate bridging ligands. Two crys- tallographically distinct o-methylbenzoate anions (o-tol1 and o-tol3) chelate one metal atom, with dihedral angles of 79.4 (1) for o-tol1 and 75.6 (1) for o-tol3 formed between the planar carboxylate group and benzene ring. The other two o-toluate ligands for o-tol2 and o-tol4 bridge two Mn atoms in a syn/syn fashion. Due to the effect of coordina- tion, the corresponding dihedral angles are 19.2(1) for o-tol2 and 11.1(2) for o-tol4 between the carboxylate groups and the benzene rings. The Mn1 and Mn2 atoms are each coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from different 4,4-bpy ligands and four carboxylate oxygen atoms from three o-toluate ligands to furnish a distorted MnN2O4 octahedron (Fig. 1). The corresponding bond distances range from 2.079(4) to 2.317(4) A˚ , and the trans- and cis- bond angles are in the region of 144.5(2)–175.2(2) and 57.0(1)–121.0(2), respectively, deviating from the ideal values of 180 and 90 for an octahedron (Table 2). The octahedrally coordinated Mn1 and Mn2 atoms are bridged in the syn/syn fashion by carboxylate groups of the anionic o-toluate ligands to generate the dinuclear [Mn2 (o-tol)4] moieties, which are interlinked by two 4,4-bpy ligands to generate 1D double-chains extended inﬁnitely along the [010] direction (Figs. S5). The C–H groups (C24 and C25) in the pyridyl ring of the 4,4-bpy ligands donate hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate oxygen atom (O1) of the chelating o-methylbenzoate anion. Owing to such weak hydrogen bonding interactions, the adjacent 1D double- chains are interconnected into 2D layers parallel to (110) (Figs. S5), and the 2D layers are stacked in an ABA- BAB sequence with each layer due to van der Waals forces. The asymmetric unit of complex 2 contains one Mn2? center, one 4,4-bpy ligand and two anionic m-toluate ligands. Similar to 1, the 4,4-bpy ligand is bis-monoden- tate. One m-toluate ligand chelates the metal atoms, and the dihedral angle between the carboxylate group and the benzene ring is 8.0(1), signiﬁcantly less than the dihedral angles of the o-tol1 and o-tol3 ligands in complex 1. The other m-toluate ligand coordinates two Mn atoms with syn/syn mode, with a dihedral angle of 20.0(1), which is consistent with the same coordination mode of o-tol ligand in complex 1. The Mn atoms with Wyckoff 8f sites are each six coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two 4,4-bpy ligands and four carboxylate oxygen atoms of three m-toluate ligands (Fig. 2). The coordinating bond distances vary from 2.121(2) to 2.303(2) A˚ , and the corresponding angles in the region of 57.9(1)–174.8(1) (Table 3) deviate signiﬁcantly from the values of 90 and 180 for a regular octahedron. The binuclear [Mn(m-tol)2] moieties are bridged by two 4,4-bpy ligands to form a 1D double-chain structure, with a MnMn separation of 11.659A˚ through the 4,4-bpy ligand Transition Met Chem (2013) 38:733–743 735 123 Table 1 Summary of crystal data, data collection, structure solution and reﬁnement details for 1–4 Compounds 1 2 3 4 Empirical formula C52H44N4Mn2O8 C52H44N4Mn2O8 C58H56N4Mn2O8 C88H90N8Mn3O20 Formula weight 962.79 962.79 1046.95 1744.50 Crystal system Monoclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Triclinic Description Yellow block Yellow block Colorless block Yellow block Crystal size (mm) 0.40 9 0.14 9 0.10 9 00.11 0.10 9 0.10 9 0.10 0.41 9 0.36 9 0.31 0.27 9 0.18 9 0.11 Temperature (K) 293(2) 293(2) 293(2) 293(2) Space group P21/c C2/c P21/n P-1 Unit cell dimensions a (A˚ ) 17.737(3) 16.081(1) 16.948(3) 11.589(2) b (A˚ ) 11.669(2) 11.660(1) 16.328(3) 13.307(3) c (A˚ ) 28.449(8) 24.949(1) 20.763(4) 15.418(3) a () 88.07(3) b () 128.29(2) 91.99(2) 111.61(3) 77.92(3) c () 69.44(3) Volume (A˚ 3) 4621.5(2) 4674.8(4) 5342.0(2) 2174.9(7) Z 4 4 4 1 Dcalc (g cm-3) 1.384 1.368 1.302 1.332 F(000) 1,992 1,992 2,184 909 l (mm-1) 0.606 0.599 0.530 0.503 h range () 3.02–27.41 3.06–27.42 3.12–27.41 3.10–27.45 Reﬂections collected 34,882 18,045 49,939 17,334 Unique reﬂections (Rint) 8,109 (0.1026) 4,112 (0.0335) 12,099 (0.0611) 7,641 (0.0435) Data, restraints, parameters 3,776, 0, 595 3,010, 0, 298 6,064, 45, 653 4,321, 0, 541 Goodness of ﬁt on F2 1.005 1.093 1.081 1.094 R1, wR2 [I C 2r(I)]a 0.0685, 0.1609 0.0364, 0.0855 0.0618, 0.1641 0.0632, 0.1623 R1, wR2 (all data)a 0.1504, 0.2086 0.0567, 0.0988 0.1360, 0.2207 0.1263, 0.2242 A, B values in wb 0.0994, 0.0000 0.0488, 1.8964 0.1046, 1.2419 0.1107, 1.0559 dqmax, dqmin (e A˚ -3) 0.736, -0.474 0.342, -0.239 0.948, -0.718 0.541, -0.755 a R1 = R(|Fo| - |Fc|)/R|Fo|, wR2 = [Rw(Fo 2 - Fc 2)2/Rw(Fo 2)2]1/2 b w = [r2(Fo 2) ?

S6). Also along the [100] direction, the 1D double-chains are interlinked by weak hydrogen bonding interactions between the C–H group (C20) of the pyridyl ring and carboxylate oxygen O3 to generate 2D layers parallel to (001) (Figs. S6). Due to van der Waals forces, the resulting layers are stacked in an AAA sequence along the [001] direction. The asymmetric unit of 3 consists of two Mn2? centers (Mn1 and Mn2), two bpp ligands (bpp1 and bpp2, ligands which contain atoms N1 and N3, respectively) and four anionic m-toluate ligands (deﬁned as m-tol1, m-tol2, m-tol3 and m-tol4, which contain atoms O1, O3, O5 and O7, respectively). The bpp1 ligand acts as a bis-monodentate bridging ligand and bpp2 functions as a monodentate ligand. The m-tol2 and m-tol3 ligands both bridge two Mn atoms in syn/syn fashion, and the m-tol1 ligand links two metal atoms in chelating/bridging fashion, while the m-tol4 ligand che- lates only one Mn atom (Fig. 3). The Mn1 atoms are each in an octahedral MnNO5 environment deﬁned by one nitrogen atom from bpp1 and ﬁve carboxylate oxygen atoms from three different m-toluate ligands. Atom Mn2 is coordinated by bpp1, bpp2 and two m-toluate ligands to generate MnN2O4 octahedra. For the Mn1 atoms, the Mn–N/O bond distances fall in the region of 2.120(3)–2.313(3) A˚ , and the cisoid and transoid N/O–Mn–N/O bond angles in the regions of 59.1(1)–106.2(1) and 152.9(1)–174.2(1), respectively. Concerning the Mn2 atoms, the Mn–N/O bond distances range from 2.097(3) to 2.273(3) A˚ , and the cisoid and transoid N/O–Mn–N/O bond angles fall in the regions of 57.2(1)–112.9(1) and 152.3(1)–174.1(1), respectively. All of these bonding parameters are as expected, although the coordination geometries of both Mn1 and Mn2 atoms are considerably distorted from a regular octahedral. The adjacent Mn1- and Mn2-centered coordination polyhedra are bridged by anionic m-toluate ligands to form binuclear [Mn2(m-tol)4] moieties, which are interlinked by bridging bpp1 ligands to build up a 1D zigzag chain propagating in the [101] direction (Figs. S7). Interdigita- tion of the chelating m-toluate ligands of the adjacent chains is driven by interchain pp stacking interactions, with mean interplanar distances of 3.76 A˚ , to generate 2D layers parallel to (101) as shown in Figs. S7. Along the [101] direction, the resulting 2D sheets are stacked in an AAA sequence to form a 3D supramolecular archi- tecture by means of van der Waals forces. The asymmetric unit of complex 4 consists of one and a half Mn2? centers [namely Mn(1) and Mn(2)], two 4,4-bpy ligands (denoted as 4,4-bpy1 and 4,4-bpy2, ligands which contain atoms N1 and N3, respectively) and three anionic p-toluate ligands (deﬁned as p-tol1, p-tol2 and p-tol3, ligands which contain atoms O1, O3 and O5, respectively). The 4,4- bpy1 ligand is bis-monodentate and 4,4-bpy2 is monodentate.

As shown in Fig. 4, the Mn(1) atoms are each six coordinated by four oxygen atoms from three p-toluato ligands, plus two nitrogen atoms from two 4,4-bpy ligands to complete a distorted octahedral MnN2O4 geometry. The Mn–N(O) distances range from 2.083(4) to 2.362(4) A˚ and the corresponding angles fall in the region 56.5(1)–174.2(2), deviating from the values for a regular octahedral geometry. Atom Mn(2) is coordinated by two bpy2 ligands, two p-tol ligands and two aqua ligands to complete trans MnN2O4 octahedra with Mn–N/O bond dis- tances varying from 2.131(4) to 2.307(5) A˚ . The bonding parameters for the Mn atoms in 4 are comparable with those reported in the literature [20]. The [Mn(1)2(p-tol)4] moieties are bridged by two 4,4- bpy ligands to form a 1D double-chain structure with binuclear Mn(1)Mn(1)#1 separation of 4.054 A˚ through the p-tol carboxylate groups along the [100] direction (Figs. S8). In the Mn(2)(4,4-bpy)2(p-tol)2 moieties, the aqua ligand O7 donates one hydrogen atom to the car- boxylate O6#3 to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond, and simultaneously to the carboxylate O3#2 to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the double-chain. The former intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction con- tributes to stabilization of the mono-unit molecules, while the latter plays an important role in assembly of the 1D double-chains and molecules into a 2D supramolecular architecture (Figs. S8).

Infrared spectra The infrared spectra of the complexes are shown in Figs. S1 to S4. Strong sharp absorptions at 1,606 cm-1 for 1, 1,602 cm-1 for 2, 1,616 cm-1 for 3 and 1,602 cm-1 for 4 result from antisymmetric stretching (mas) of the carboxyl- ate groups, while symmetric stretching (ms) of the carboxylate groups cause strong sharp absorptions at 1,550 cm-1 for 1, 1,556 cm-1 for 2, 1,575 cm-1 for 3 and 1,514 cm-1 for 4, respectively. The separations between mas and ms are 56 cm-1 for 1, 46 cm-1 for 2, 41 cm-1 for 3 and 88 cm-1 for 4, corresponding to bidentate coordination for complexes 1–3, and chelate or monodentate coordina- tion for complex 4. The 4,4-bipyridine and 1,3-bis(4-pyri- dyl)-propane ligands, due to their pyridyl ring stretching vibrations, give strong absorptions at 1,411 cm-1 for 1, 1,400 cm-1 for 2, 1,395 cm-1 for 3 and 1,409 cm-1 for 4. The out-of-plane bending vibrations of the pyridyl C–H bonds give sharp peaks of medium intensities at 811 and 738 cm-1 for 1, 810 and 748 cm-1 for 2, 809 and 756 cm-1 for 3, 808 and 773 cm-1 for 4. Thermal analysis The TG/DTA curves for the complexes are shown in Figs. S1 to S4. The DTA curve for 1 shows endothermic peaks at 293 and 451 C. The TG curve shows that compound 1 is thermally stable up to 200 C, then experiences a rapid weight loss of 33.0 % in the range 220–340 C, corre- sponding to decomposition of the 4,4-bipyridine ligands. Upon further heating, a second decomposition step between 340 and 500 C could be attributed to decompo- sition of o-toluato ligands. Upon further heating, decom- position continues in continuous steps to give a ﬁnal mass remnant of 11.5 % at 900 C. For complex 2, the DTA curve displays three endo- thermic peaks at 236, 304 and 455 C. The TG curve suggests that this complex is thermally stable up to 160 C, then undergoes a rapid weight loss of 32.4 % in the range 160–340 C, corresponding to the loss of two 4,4-bipyri- dine ligands. Upon further heating, a weight loss of 48.4 % over 345–900 C in the second step agrees well with the decomposition of four m-toluato ligands. Up to 900 C, the residue remains at 18.9 %. The DTA curve for complex 3 shows two endothermic peaks at 197 and 473 C. The observed weight loss for the ﬁrst decomposition step over 180–340 C reaches 35.6 %, corresponding well with the calculated value (34.8 %) for removal of two 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)-propane ligands per formula unit. Upon further heating, the sample loses an additional weight of 48.9 % in the range 340–900 C, in good agreement with the decomposition of four moles m-toluato ligands with the calculated value of 48.6 %, leaving a residue of 15.5 %. The DTA curve of complex 4 shows four endothermic peaks at 79, 228, 311 and 467 C. Upon heating from 20 to 170 C, the sample experiences a weight loss of 9.3 % in agreement with the value of 8.3 % calculated for the release of eight water molecules per formula unit. After this, a weight loss of 81.1 % over 170–900 C was Fig. 1 A view of coordination environments around Mn with the atom labeling for 1.

Magnetic properties Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measure- ments for compounds 1–4 were performed on polycrys- talline samples in the temperature range of 2–300 K in a ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld 1 KOe, and the magnetic behaviors in the form of vmT and vm versus T plots are depicted in Fig. 5 (vm being the magnetic susceptibility per two Mn units for complexes 1–3 and three Mn units for complex 4, respectively). At 300 K, the vmT values were 8.44, 8.52, 8.17 and 13.24 cm3 mol-1 K for 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The values for complexes 1–3 are slightly lower than the spin- only value of 8.76 cm3 mol-1 K for two high-spin Mn(II) ions (S = 5/2), while that for complex 4 is slightly larger than the three spin-only value of 13.14 cm3 mol-1 K for high-spin Mn(II) [21]. Upon cooling, the vmT values remain nearly constant to 50 K, then abruptly diminish to 1.46, 1.16, 0.40 and 4.94 cm3 K mol-1 for 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively at 2 K, indicating an overall antiferromagnetic interaction between the Mn(II) centers in each case. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities above 2 K for all four complexes follow the Curie–Weiss law vm = C/(T - H). The best ﬁts of the vm -1 versus T plots gave Curie constant C = 11.0(2) cm3 K mol-1 and Weiss con- stant H = -10.6(3) K for 1, C = 11.6(2) cm3 K mol-1 and H = -13.9(4) K for 2, C = 13.0(5) cm3 K mol-1 and H = 40.8(9) K for 3, and C = 13.2(1) cm3 K mol-1 and H = -3.8(1) K for 4, indicating the presence of antiferro- magnetic interactions between the Mn(II) ions. According to their crystal structures, complexes 1–3 can be described as binuclear units via bridging carboxylates with the binuclear moieties interlinked by 4,40-bipyridine or 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)-propane ligands to generate 1D chains. From a magnetic viewpoint, the derivatives of 4,40- bipyridine ligands are considered to have no contribution in mediating magnetically exchanged interactions between metal ions. Therefore, the effective transmitting pathway of the magnetic coupling between the magnetic centers in complexes 1–3 is probably via the syn/syn carboxylate groups to form a binuclear model [22]. The magnetic susceptibility data can be analyzed by the following expression, based on the Heisenberg Hamiltonian H = -2JS1S2 (S1 = S2 = 5/2): Fig. 5 vm and vmT versus T plots for complexes 1–4. Solid lines represent the best ﬁts Transition Met Chem (2013) 38:733–743 741 123 vm ¼ Ng2b2 kT x2 þ 5x6 þ 14x12 þ 30x20 þ 55x30 1 þ 3x2 þ 5x6 þ 7x12 þ 9x20 þ 11x30 ð1Þ x ¼ expðJ=kTÞ v 0 m ¼ vm 1  ð2zJ 0=Ng2b2Þvm : ð2Þ A molecular ﬁeld approximation term zJ0 was added to describe the interdimer Mn2? unit exchange interactions [23], and the expression in Eq. (1) was corrected using the molecular ﬁeld approximation to give Eq. (2), which was used to ﬁt the magnetic susceptibility data. The best ﬁt leads to J = -0.46 cm-1, g = 1.98 and zJ0 = 0.05 cm-1 with an agreement factor R = 1.9 9 10-3 for 1, where R = P[(vm)obs - (vm)calc]2/[(vm)obs]2. For complex 2, J = -0.56 cm-1, g = 1.99, zJ0 = 0.07 cm-1, and R = 1.5 9 10-3. While for complex 3, J = -1.28 cm-1, g = 1.97, zJ0 = 0.15 cm-1, and R = 7.9 9 10-4. This is consistent with the conclusion that the bridging carbox- ylates usually induce an antiferromagnetic coupling between dimeric Mn(II) centers. The observed value of J for complex 3 is somewhat larger than those for 1 and 2. The exchange coupling constant in 3 is dependent on the different binuclear units, with the coordination of toluato ligands. As stated in the structure description, complex 4 features the mononuclear unit and 1D double-chains from Mn2? centers interlinked by p-toluato ligands and 4,4-bipyridine ligands. Since the 4,4-bipyridine does not provide an effective pathway for magnetic exchange, the magnetic susceptibility vm (the magnetic susceptibility per three Mn(II) ions) could be modeled by the combination of binuclear plus mononuclear Mn(II) units [22, 24] and should be equal to vdi þ vmono; vdi ¼ Ng2b2 kT x2 þ 5x6 þ 14x12 þ 30x20 þ 55x30 1 þ 3x2 þ 5x6 þ 7x12 þ 9x20 þ 11x30 ð3Þ x = exp(J=kTÞ: When taking into consideration the mononuclear d5 high-spin Mn(II) complex with the g-tensor anisotropy and zero-ﬁeld split (ZFS), the monomeric contribution (vmono) to the magnetic susceptibility can be expressed as follows: vII ¼ Ng2b2 4kT ð1 þ 9e2x þ 25e6xÞ ð1 þ e2x þ e6xÞ v? ¼ Ng2b2 4kT ð9 þ 8=x  11e2x=2x  5e6x=2xÞ ð1 þ e2x þ e6xÞ x ¼ D=kT vmono ¼ ðvII þ 2v?Þ=3 ð4Þ where vdi and vmono denote the magnetic susceptibility per binuclear and single Mn(II) centers, respectively. D is the ZFS parameter, and N, g and b have their usual meanings. The best ﬁt was obtained with the following parameters: J = -0.59 cm-1, D = 1.82 cm-1, g = 2.01, zJ0 = 0.01 cm-1, and R = 7.6 9 10-3. The negative J value shows weak antiferromagnetic coupling through the car- boxylate group of the p-toluato ligand. The theoretical curve (solid line in Fig 5d) is very consistent with the experimental curve at lower temperatures, indicating that spin–orbit coupling and ZFS are signiﬁcant for 4. Conclusions In summary, four new Mn coordination polymers have been obtained from 4,40-bipyridine and 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)- propane, and o-toluic acid, m-toluic acid and p-toluic acid. Compounds 1–3 feature 1D chains based on bridging ligands with dinuclear Mn2(tol)4 units, while complex 4 shows a 1D double-chain and 1D mono-unit chain, which are assembled via hydrogen bonding into a 2D supramo- lecular architecture. The magnetic characterizations of the complexes suggest weak antiferromagnetic coupling exchange between dimeric Mn(II) centers.
