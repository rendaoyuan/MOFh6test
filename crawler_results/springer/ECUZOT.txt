An entirely different structure and topology between 1 and similar complexes indicate that the nature of organic ligands affects the structure of assemblies. The results indicate that the framework of this complex is predominated by the nature of the organic ligand, anions, solvent and geometric need of the metal ions. It was found that the coordination number of PbII ions is eight, (PbN3O5) has a stereo-chemically active electron lone pair and the coordination sphere is hemi-directed.

The appropriate design of ligands and metal building units have led to various interesting porous MOFs [5]. However, control of the shape and properties of the cavity formed is still challenging. Small changes in the building unit can lead to a completely different framework topology rather than an isostructural network with tuned cavity shape and properties. PCPs have characteristics that include (1) well-ordered porous structures, (2) ﬂexible and dynamic behavior in response to guest molecules and (3) designable channel surface functionalities. Although chan- nel surface modiﬁcation is essential for the creation of functionalized porous structures, application of this syn- thetic approach to the PCP system has received little attention. Two types of strategies are used to functionalize channel surfaces: immobilization of coordinatively unsat- urated (open) metal sites (OMS) and introduction of organic groups to provide guest-accessible functional organic sites (FOS) [6, 7]. There is a growing interest in the use of OMS for Lewis acid catalysis and speciﬁc gas adsorption, but less attention has been paid to the study of FOS despite their importance. The paucity of information on FOS is because of the difﬁculty of producing guest-accessible FOS on the pore surface: these organic groups tend to coordinate metal ions via a self-assembly process, resulting in frameworks in which FOS are completely blocked.

The amide group is a fascinating functional group because it possesses two types of hydrogen bonding sites: the –NH moiety acts as an electron acceptor [8, 9]. These multifunctional moieties of amide groups tend to form hydrogen bonds among them- selves and interact negligibly with guest molecules after construction of PCPs. If a PCP could be prepared without forming amide–amide interactions, these groups would constitute attractive interaction sites for selective sorption and/or catalysis inside the channel. To retain amide groups as guest interaction FOS inside the network, we employed a three-connector ligand containing amide groups. Three- connector ligands are more useful for construction of 3D PCPs with coordination bonds than bidentate or mono- dentate ligands [10]. Additionally, lead(II) frameworks have attracted great interest because of lead’s large ion radius, a variable coordination number, the possible occurrence of a stereo-chemically active lone pair of 6s2 outer electrons and novel network topologies [11, 12]. According to the hard-soft acid–base theory, the interme- diate coordination ability of lead(II) means that it can ﬂexibly coordinate small nitrogen or oxygen atoms as well as large sulfur atoms [13]. The investigation of stereo- chemical activity of the valence shell electron lone pairs in polymeric and supramolecular compounds may be more interesting as the spontaneous aggregation of several bridging ligands may cause the gap to disappear and leading to a less common holo-directed arrangement [14]. Lead(II) coordination polymers have been previously studied in some extent [15–18]. We have recently focused our attention on the design and synthesis of metal–organic frameworks with speciﬁc topologies and properties by using a ﬂexible tripodal ligand containing three pyridyl groups as coordination sites and three amide groups as guest interaction sites; e.g., (N,N0,N00-tris(pyrid-3-ylme- thyl)-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxamide (tpmba, Scheme 1) [19]. In order to study further the assembly of the ﬂexible tripodal ligand with post-transition metal salts and the inclusion properties of MOFs, we synthesized and char- acterized the Pb(II) complex with this ligand. In this paper, we report the crystal structure and inclusion properties of {[Pb2(tpmba)2(NO3)4]. MeOH}n (1) and their conversion into nano-structured lead oxide using calcination at mod- erately elevated temperatures. In recent years many kinds of lead(II) coordination polymers have been prepared by the several methods. It should be emphasized that there are different methods to synthesize nano- and micro-crystalline lead(II) oxide such as microwave-solvothermal synthesis, hydrothermal route and surfactant ligand co-assisting solvothermal synthesis [20–26]. 2 Experimental 2.1 Physical Property Measurements The ligand tpmba was prepared as described previously [11, 27]. All other reagents and solvents were commercially available and were used without further puriﬁcation. An Elementar Vario Microanalyzer CHN–O-Rapid Analyzer was used for C, H and N elemental analysis of samples. The IR spectra were performed on a Bruker Vector 22 FT-IR spectrometer disks in the 4,000–400 cm-1 range as KB disks. Thermogravimetric–differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) curves were recorded on SETARAM LABSYS Thermal analyser from 25–800 C under a N2 ﬂow; heating rate, 3 C min-1. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) mea- surements were performed using an X’pert diffractometer (Panalytical) with monochromatized CuKa radiation. The crystallite sizes of selected samples were estimated using the Scherrer formula. The morphology of samples after gold coating was investigated using a scanning electron micro- scope (Philips XL 30). Crystallographic measurements were made at 100(2) K using a Bruker SMART CCD area detector diffractometer. The intensity data were collected using graphite monochromated MoKa radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). Accurate unit cell parameters and orientation matrix for data collection was obtained from least–squares reﬁnement. The structure has been solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F2. 2.2 Synthesis of {[Pb2(tpmba)2(NO3)4]MeOH}n A solution of tpmba (36.0 mg, 0.075 mmol) in methanol (15 mL) was added to an aqueous solution of Pb(NO3)2 (0.075 mmol mL-1, 1 mL). The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h, then ﬁltered. Colorless crystals were obtained after the ﬁltrate was allowed to stand for several weeks; yield, 58%. Elemental analysis, calc.

This solu- tion was degassed for 20 min and heated to 180 C for 2 h. A black precipitate formed. A small amount of toluene and a large excess of EtOH were added to the reaction solution and PbO nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation. The solids were washed with EtOH and dried in air. 3 Results and Discussion Reaction between TPMBA) and lead(II) nitrate in metha- nol solution provides crystalline material that is analyzed as {[Pb2(tpmba)2(NO3)4]MeOH}n. Scheme 2 gives an overview of the methods used for the synthesis of {[Pb2(tpmba)2(NO3)4]MeOH}n (1) and PbO nanoparticles. The IR spectrum of these compounds show characteristic bands of tpmba and methanol. For example, a band at 1,350 cm-1 is due to the presence of the NO3 - stretching vibration; a broad band at 3,494 cm-1 is assigned to the O–H stretching vibration in methanol, and a strong band at 3,188 cm-1 is assigned to the N–H. stretching vibration. The strong band at 1,668 cm-1 is due to the C=O group stretching vibration of the tpmba ligand [28]. The structure of the complex is determined by X-ray crystallography. The crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are shown in Table 2. Thus, the X-ray crystallographic anal- ysis shows that complex 1 crystallized in the monoclinic system with space group of P21/n and has a cage-like structure [29]. The molecular structure of an asymmetric unit and two views of the [Pb2(tpmba)2(NO3)4].MeOH unit are shown in Fig. 1. The coordination number of each Pb(II)-atoms in 1 is eight; each Pb(II) is coordinated to Scheme 2 Materials produced and synthetic methods Table 1 Crystal data and structure reﬁnement for {[Pb2(tpmba)2(- NO3)4]MeOH}n (1) Empirical formula C28H28N8O10Pb Formula weight 843.77 Temperature 100(2) K Wavelength 0.71073 A˚ Crystal system Monoclinic Space group P21/n Unit cell dimensions a = 18.3145(15) A˚ b = 7.8110 (7) A˚ c = 20.7812 (18) A˚ b = 93.958 (2) Volume 2965.8 (4) A˚ 3 Z 4 Density (calculated) 1.890 Mg/m3 Absorption coefﬁcient 5.762 mm-1 F(000) 1656 e Crystal size 0.41 9 0.19 9 0.12 mm3 h range for data collection 1.43–31.26 Index ranges -25 B h B 13,-11 B k B 11, -29 B l B 29 Reﬂections collected 8,709 Independent reﬂections 7232 [R(int) = 0.0493] Reﬁnement method Full-matrix least-squares on F2 Goodness-of-ﬁt on F2 1.069 Final R indices [I [ 2r(I)] R1 = 0.0475, wR2 = 0.0761 R indices (all data) R1 = 0.0355, wR2 = 0.0711 Table 2 Selected bond lengths and bond angles for {[Pb2(tpmba)2 (NO3)4]MeOH}n N8 Pb1 2.703 (3) O3 Pb1 2.643 (3) O4 Pb1 2.677 (3) O2 Pb1 2.661 (3) Pb1 N6 2.620 (4) Pb1 N3 2.5169 (3) Pb1 O1 2.902 (3) Pb1 O3i 2.916 (3) C1 N3 Pb1 117.1 (3) C5 N3 Pb1 124.4 (3) C20 N6 Pb1 124.2 (3) C19 N6 Pb1 117.8 (3) C27 N8 Pb1 113.8 (3) C26 N8 Pb1 128.2 (3) N1 O3 Pb1 102.9 (2) N2 O4 Pb1 96.3 (2) N2 O6 Pb1 97.1 (2) N3 Pb1 N6 80.40 (12) N3 Pb1 O3 71.34 (11) N6 Pb1 O3 73.55 (11) N3 Pb1 O6 79.56 (10) N6 Pb1 O6 72.44 (11) O3 Pb1 O6 138.14 (9) N3 Pb1 O4 79.35 (11) N6 Pb1 O4 119.54 (11) O3 Pb1 O4 145.48 (10) O6 Pb1 O4 48.10 (9) N3 Pb1 N8 86.48 (11) N6 Pb1 N8 155.07 (11) O3 Pb1 N8 82.21 (11) O6 Pb1 N8 125.94 (10) O4 Pb1 N8 78.12 (10) O6 Pb1 O1 154.95 (3) J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:903–909 905 123 three pyridyl N-atoms with Pb–N distances of 2.5169(3), 2.703(3) and 2.620(4) A˚ and ﬁve nitrate O-atoms with Pb–O distance of 2.677(3), 2.661(3), 2.643(3), 2.902(3) and 2.916(3) A˚ . The arrangement of these ligands suggests the presence of a gap or a hole in the coordination geom- etry around the metal ions (O6–Pb1–O1 = 154.95(3)), possibly occupied by a stereo-active lone pair of electrons on Pb(II) [29]. The observed shortening of the Pb–N bonds on the side of Pb(II) ion opposite to the putative lone pair of electrons (N3–Pb1 = 2.5169(3) A˚ compared to O3i– Pb1 = 2.916(3) A˚ adjacent to the lone pair) supports the presence of the gap [29–33]. Thus, the geometry of the nearest coordination environment of each lead atom is most likely caused by the geometrical constraint of the coordi- nated tpmba ligand, nitrate anions and the inﬂuence of a stereo-chemically active lone pair of electrons in hybrid orbital on the metal atom. Such an environment leaves space for bonding of another oxygen atom of the nitrate anion. To ﬁnd any potential donor center within this vacancy, the bonding limit needs to be extended at least 3.1 A˚ [30]. Hence, It is possible to locate nitrate O-atoms approaching each Pb (i.e., Pb1O1i = 2.939 A˚ ) (Fig. 2). Therefore, the coordination sphere is almost complete; and, the coordination number will be nine (PbN3O6) with holo- directed geometry [30] (symmetry code: i = -x, -y, -z). The framework of complex 1 was constructed from the Pb(II) center as an eight-connected node. This arrangement produces a large four-membered ring composed of two octahedral Pb(II) moieties linked together by two tpmba Fig. 1 a Molecular structure of the asymmetric unit; b, c: two view of the [Pb2(tpmba)2(NO3)4]MeOH unit Fig. 2 Schematic representation of the PbII environment Fig. 3 Distorted 4-membered ring composed of three octahedral Pb(II) linked together by tow tpmba units 906 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:903–909 123 units (M2L2). The rotation of tpmba between the benzene ring and amide group (Fig. 3) results in rotation of the four- membered ring. The framework expands in three directions with a Pb(II)Pb(II) separation of 11.095 A˚ to form a 3D network (Fig. 4). Two frameworks mutually interpene- trating with the nearest-neighbor Pb(II)Pb(II) distance of 5.710 A˚ between Pb(II)-atoms in the adjacent frameworks produces three-dimensionally running channels (3D pores) with dimensions of 9.915 9 12.723 A˚ 2. These pores are available and suitable for guest molecule accommodation and exchange (Fig. 5). The channel is not straight. The nearest N(amide)-to-N(amide) distances are about 13.557 A˚ in the network and 5.220 A˚ between the two adjacent networks while the distance of N(amide)-to- O(amide) is about 6.408 A˚ . Consequently, the highly ordered amide groups on the surfaces of the channels could act as important FOS in the interaction between the host and guest molecules. The X-ray crystallographic results clearly show that methanol molecules interact with the NH moieties of the amide groups (O[methanol]N[amide]) ca. 2.829 A˚ ) via hydrogen bonds (Fig. 6). To study the thermal stability of 1, the thermogravi- metric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen from 25 to 580 C was performed on polycrystalline samples. The TG curve shows that 1 is thermally stable to 261 C and then loses the organic ligand and solvent to 411 C. A solid residue of PbO occurs when 1 is heated at 600 C. PbO powders weren generated by thermal decomposi- tion of 1 in air. The powder XRD patterns (Fig. 7) match with the standard pattern of orthorhombic PbO with a = 5.8931 A˚ and z = 4 (JCPDS card ﬁle No. 77-1971) and conﬁrms the formation of PbO. Signiﬁcant broadening of the peaks indicate that the particles are of nanometer dimensions. The average size of the particles is 30 nm and is estimated from the Scherrer formula (D = 0.891k/bcosh, where D is the average grain size, k is the X-ray wave- length (1.5418 A˚ ), h is the diffraction angle and b is the full-width at half maximum of an observed peak). The morphology and size of the PbO samples were further investigated with SEM. A bulk powder sample of 1 pro- duces regularly shaped Pb(II) oxide nanoparticles with a diameter about 30 nm (Fig. 8), which is comparable to similarly reported preparations [20–26].

A 3D PCP that is functionalized with amide groups, {[Pb2(tpmba)2(NO3)4] MeOH}n (1), was successfully synthesized from the reac- tion of Pb(NO3)2 and a three connector-type amide ligand (tpmba). The structure of the product was characterized by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The result of structural analysis of complex revealed that 1 was a M2L2 type cage- like complex with a methanol molecule beside the cage. The framework of 1 was constructed from the Pb(II) center as an eight-connected node. This arrangement produces a large four-membered ring composed of tow octahedral Pb(II) moieties linked together by tow tpmba units. The four-membered ring is distorted because of the rotation of tpmba between the benzene ring and the amide group. The framework expands in three directions, with a Pb(II)P- b(II) separation of 11.095 A˚ . The channel is not straight. The arrangement of these ligands suggests presence gap or a hole in coordination geometry around the Pb(II) ions. It is possible to ﬁnd nitrate-oxygen atoms approaching each Pb (Pb1O1i = 2.939 A˚ ); therefore, the coordination sphere is almost completed and the coordination number will be nine (PbN3O6) with holo-directed geometry. In this case the PbO nanoparticles were obtained by thermolysis of 1 at 180 C with oleic acid as a surfactant. The scanning electron microscopy shows that the size of the PbO parti- cles is *30 nm. 5 Supplementary Material Crystallographic data for the structure reported in the paper has been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as supplementary publication No. CCDC- 807076 for {[Pb2(tpmba)2(NO3)4]MeOH}n.
