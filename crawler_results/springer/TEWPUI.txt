Manuscript Inﬂuence of organic carboxylic acids on self-assembly of silver(I) complexes containing 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane ligands Chong-chen Wang • Peng Wang • Li–li Feng Received: 14 December 2011 / Accepted: 18 January 2012 / Published online: 8 February 2012  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012 Abstract Four silver(I) complexes, namely [Ag2(bpe)2]- (bdc)8H2O (1), [Ag2(bpe)2(da)]4H2O (2), [Ag4(bpe)3- (bptc)]9H2O (3), and Ag(bpe)2(bpdc)2 (4), have been successfully synthesized by the reactions between AgNO3, 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpe) and different carboxylic acids, including 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2bdc), diphenic acid (H2da), 3,30,4,40-biphenyltetracarboxylic acid (H4bptc), and 2,20-bipyridine-3,30-dicarboxylic acid (H2bpdc). All four compounds were characterized by ele- mental analysis, IR spectra, and single-crystal X-ray dif- fraction. In (1), the Ag(I) atoms, in linear geometry, are joined into 1-D inﬁnite cationic bpe-silver chains, and discrete bdc2- anions compensate the charge of the crystal structure. In (2), the Ag(I) atoms, adopting tetrahedral and trigonal geometries, are linked by bpe and da2- ligands into neutral double chains. In (3), the Ag(I) atoms, in T-shaped and linear environments, are coordinated by bpe and multidentate bptc4- ligands to construct a 2-D net- work. And in (4), the Ag(I) atoms, with trigonal and T-shaped coordination geometries, are coordinated by bpe and bpdc2- ligands to build up a 3-D framework. The different anions play different and important roles in directing the ﬁnal crystal structures. Introduction The rational design and assembly of silver-based coordi- nation polymers with well-regulated network structures have received much attention, not only because of the ability of silver to form compounds with coordination numbers from two to six, resulting in many different architectures [1–4], but also due to the potential applica- tions of such compounds, such as gas storage [5], antimi- crobial [6, 7], conductive material [8, 9], luminescent [10–15], and magnetic materials [16]. The geometrical ﬂexibility of silver(I) results in intricate coordination architectures and also affords an opportunity to explore how the self-assembly process of silver-based coordination compounds can be inﬂuenced by various factors, including the structural characteristics of the polydentate organic ligands, the metal–ligand ratio, solvents and the possible counter-ions [2–4, 11, 17–22]. The key to construction of a desired framework is usually the selection of organic ligands, and in some cases, a subtle alteration of organic ligands can lead to a new architecture. 1,2-Bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpe), being an analogue of 4,40-bipyridine (bpy), is a typical neutral linear ligand widely used as a linker in the construction of novel frameworks [23–26]. Multicarboxylate ligands, like 1,3- benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2bdc), diphenic acid (H2da), 3,30,4,40-biphenyltetracarboxylic acid (H4bptc), and 2,20- bipyridine-3,30-dicarboxylic acid (H2bpdc), are often used as multifunctional organic ligands, not only because of their various coordination modes, but also because of their ability to act as hydrogen-bond acceptors and donors in the assembly of supramolecular structures [2–4, 27, 28]. Some silver(I) complexes constructed from bpy and its analogues but with different organic counter-ions have been reported, such as [Ag2(bpy)2](ha)26H2O, [Ag2(bpy)2(H2O)](pdc) 3H2O, [Ag4(bpy)4](bptc)14H2O, and [Ag2(dpe)2(H2O)2] (ha)6H2O (bpy = 4,40-bipyridine, dpe = 1,2-di(4-pyridyl) ethylene, H2ha = hexanedioic acid, H2pdc = pyridine-3, 5-dicarboxylic acid, and H4bptc = 3,304,40-biphenyltetracarboxylic C.

With this paper, we report four silver coordination polymers, namely [Ag2(bpe)2](bdc)8H2O (1), [Ag2(bpe)2- (da)]4H2O (2), Ag4(bpe)3(bptc)]9H2O (3), and Ag(bpe)2- (bpdc)2 (4), prepared via the self-assembly reactions of bpe, H2bdc, H2da, H4bptc, H2bpdc (Scheme 1), and AgNO3 to investigate the inﬂuence of organic carboxylate anions on the crystal structures of the resulting silver coordination compounds. Experimental All chemicals were commercially available reagent grade and used directly without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analysis for the title complexes was performed using an Elementar Vario EL-III instrument. IR spectra, in the region (400–4000 cm-1), were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Spec- trum 100 Fourier Transform infrared spectrophotometer. Synthesis of [Ag2(bpe)2](bdc)8H2O (1) An ammonia solution (25 mL) of AgNO3 (0.0085 g, 0.05 mmol) and H2bdc (0.012 g, 0.05 mmol) was added drop-wise to an EtOH solution (25 mL) of bpe (0.0092 g, 0.05 mmol). The clear solution was stirred for a few minutes and then allowed to evaporate at room tempera- ture. Block-like colorless crystals of complex (1) appeared after several weeks (yield 72% based on AgNO3). Anal. Calcd. for C32H44Ag2N4O12 (%): C, 43.1; H, 5.0; N, 6.3. Found: C, 44.1; H, 5.0; N, 6.3.

Semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied using the SADABS program [29]. The structures were solved by direct methods [30] and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXS 97 and SHELXL 97 programs [30, 31]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions. Crystallographic data and structural reﬁnements for the compounds are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for all four complexes are listed in Table 2. Results and discussion Crystallographic analysis of [Ag2(bpe)2](bdc)8H2O (1) The analysis of the crystal structure reveals that [Ag2(bpe)2] (bdc)8H2O (1) is made up of 1-D cationic [Ag2(bpe)2]2n? chains, discrete bdc2- counter-ions and lattice water mole- cules. There are two crystallographically non-identical Ag(I) atoms with different coordination geometries in the structure of (1). As shown in Fig. 1a, the Ag1 and Ag2 are linearly coordinated by two N atoms from two different bpe ligands, with Ag–N distances ranging from 2.126(11) A˚ to 2.161(10) A˚ and N–Ag–N angles of 176.0(5). The Ag–N bond lengths and N–Ag–N bond angles (Table 2) are com- parable with those observed in related complexes [2–4, 14, 29]. The bpe act as a typical N,N0-bidentate ligand to join Ag(I) atoms into 1-D cationic chains, and the dihedral angles between the two pyridyl rings of the same bpe ligands are 3.14(40) and 5.21(44). Between the adjacent cationic chains, the shortest AgAg and AgN distances are 3.802(14) A˚ and 3.952(12) A˚ , respectively, indicating weak ligand-unsupported AgAg and AgN interactions, as shown in Fig. 1b. The adjacent cationic [Ag1(bpe)]? n? and [Ag2(bpe)]? n? chains are weakly connected by ligand-unsupported AgAg and AgN interactionsinto2-D cationic sheets(Asheet).The bdc2- anions are joined into sheets (B sheet) with the aid of lattice water molecules via rich intermolecular hydrogen- bonding interactions, as depicted in Fig. 1c and Table 3. The neighboring cationic and anionic sheets are further joined into a 3-D sandwich-like framework by electrostatic interactions. Viewed along the c-axis, it can be seen that the anionic B sheet is inserted between two cationic A sheets to form a typical sandwich-like framework, as shown in Fig. 1c.

Each Ag(1) atom is coordinated, in a slightly distorted tetrahedral geometry, by two nitrogen atoms from two different bpe ligands [Ag1–N, 0.2195(3) and 2.210(3) A˚ ; N–Ag1–N, 152.34(13)], and by two oxygen atoms from two COO- groups attached to different benzene rings of the same da2- ligand [Ag1–O, 2.529(3) A˚ and 2.531(3) A˚; N–Ag1–O, 109.36(10); O–Ag1–O, 105.23(9)]. In contrast, each Ag(2) atom, in distorted tri- gonal geometry, is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two different bpe ligands [Ag–N, 2.181(3) and 2.205(3) A˚ ; N–Ag2–N, 147.32(13)], and by an oxygen atom from a COO- group [Ag–O, 2.399(3)A˚ ; N–Ag2–O, 111.67(11) and 101.01(11)] of a da2- ligand, as illustrated in Fig. 2a and Table 2. Bpe thus acts as a typical 4,40-bipyridine-like bidentate ligand, linking two Ag atoms via nitrogen atoms from two pyridyl rings to form inﬁnite 1-D chains. The dihedral angles between the two pyridyl rings of the bpe ligands are 9.68(123) and 14.76(12), respectively. The da2- acts as a bidentate ligand, as shown in Scheme 2(a), to chelate one Ag atom by two oxygen atoms (O1 and O3) from two different COO- groups attached to two different benzene rings of the same ligand, and to coordinate the Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for compound (1), (2), (3), and (4) [Ag2(dpe)2](bdc)8H2O (1) Bond lengths (A˚ ) Ag(1)–N(1) 2.126(11) Ag(1)–N(2) 2.161(10) Ag(2)–N(4) 2.138(11) Ag(2)–N(3) 2.146(10) Bond angles () N(1)–Ag(1)–N(2) 176.0(5) N(4)–Ag(2)–N(3) 176.1(5) [Ag2(dpe)2(da)]4H2O (2) Bond lengths (A˚ ) Ag(1)–N(3) 2.195(3) Ag(1)–N(1) 2.210(3) Ag(1)–O(3) 2.529(3) Ag(1)–O(1) 2.531(3) Ag(2)–N(2) 2.181(3) Ag(2)–N(4) 2.205(3) Ag(2)–O(1) 2.399(3) Bond angles () N(3)–Ag(1)–N(1) 152.34(13) N(3)–Ag(1)–O(3) 89.56(11) N(1)–Ag(1)–O(3) 109.19(10) N(3)–Ag(1)–O(1) 109.36(10) N(1)–Ag(1)–O(1) 85.75(11) O(3)–Ag(1)–O(1) 105.23(9) N(2)–Ag(2)–N(4) 147.32(13) N(2)–Ag(2)–O(1) 111.67(11) N(4)–Ag(2)–O(1) 101.01(11) [Ag4(bpe)3(bptc)]9H2O (3) Bond lengths (A˚ ) Ag(1)–N(1) 2.147(15) Ag(1)–N(3) 2.147(15) Ag(2)–O(7) 2.076(13) Ag(2)–O(3)#1 2.099(13) Ag(3)–N(5) 2.142(16) Ag(3)–N(2)#2 2.162(15) Ag(3)–O(9) 2.62(2) Ag(4)–N(4) 2.113(15) Ag(4)–N(6) 2.144(17) Ag(4)–O(10) 2.78(2) Bond angles () N(1)–Ag(1)–N(3) 169.5(7) O(7)–Ag(2)–O(3)#1 178.8(9) N(5)–Ag(3)–N(2)#2 169.6(6) N(5)–Ag(3)–O(9) 95.0(6) N(2)#2–Ag(3)–O(9) 95.4(6) N(4)–Ag(4)–N(6) 171.7(7) N(4)–Ag(4)–O(10) 95.7(6) N(6)–Ag(4)–O(10) 92.6(6) Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms: #1: x?1, y, z-1; #2: x ? 2, y ? 3, z-2; #3: x-2, y-3, z?2; and #4: x-1, y, z ? 1.

It is noteworthy that in complex (2) the ligand-unsup- ported AgAg (3.45(6) A˚ ) weak interactions also play an important role in connecting the adjacent [Ag(bpe)]? chains, as shown in Fig. 2b. The 1-D double chains are connected with 2-D sheets by rich hydrogen-bonding interactions formed by lattice water molecules situating among the [Ag2(bpe)2(da)] molecules, and ﬁnally a 3-D sandwich-like framework was further built up of neigh- boring cationic sheets and anionic sheets by electrostatic interactions, as drawn in Fig. 2c.

Each Ag(1)I atom, in slightly distorted T-shaped geometry, is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two different bpe ligands [Ag–N, 2.147(15) and 2.147(15) A˚ ; N–Ag2–N, 169.5(7)] and weakly coordinated by an oxygen atom from the COO- group of a bptc4- ligand [Ag–O, 2.662(18)A˚ ; N–Ag1–O, 92.29(60) and 98.07(61)], as illustrated in Fig. 3a and Table 2. The Ag(2), in linear coordination geometry, is coordinated by two oxygen atoms from two different bptc4- ligands [Ag–O, 2.076(13) and 2.099(13) A˚ ; O–Ag2–O, 178.8(9)]. Each Ag(3)I is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two different bpe ligands [Ag–N, 2.142(16) and 2.162(15) A˚ ; N–Ag2–N, 169.6(6)] and weakly coordinated by one oxygen atom from an aqua ligand [Ag–O, 2.62(2)A˚ ; N–Ag2–O, 95.0(6) and 95.4(6)] to adopt a slightly distorted T-shaped geometry. The Ag(4)I center, in linear coordination geometry, is linked by two nitrogen atoms from bpe ligands [Ag–N, 2.113(15) and 2.144(17) A˚ ; N–Ag2–N, 171.7(7)], and the bond distances and angles in complex (3) were similar to those of previously reported Ag complexes [2–4]. In complex (3), bpe acts as a typical bidentate ligand, linking two Ag atoms via the nitrogen atoms from two pyr- idyl rings. The dihedral angles between the pyridyl rings of the same bpe are 7.02(69) and 16.55(59). The fully deprotonated bptc4- units act as counter-ions, balancing the cationic charge of both AgI and tridentate ligands to join the Ag(2) atom via O(7), O(3)#1(#1: x ? 1, y, z-1) and O1 from two different COO- groups attached to the same bptc4- anion [the coordination mode of bptc4- was shown in a b c A B A d Fig. 1 a Ortep view of the [Ag2(bpe)2](bdc)8H2O (1) structure with atomic labeling of one asymmetric unit.

The dihedral angle between the two benzene rings of the same bptc4- is 18.77(69). The adjacent 2-D sheets are further stacked into a 3-D sandwich-like framework via hydrogen-bonding inter- actions, as listed in Table 3. Hydrogen-bonding interactions may play a role in the orientation of bptc4- anions in the crystal structure of complex (3).

The atoms Ag(1) and Ag(2), adopting distorted trigonal geometry, are coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two different bpe ligands [Ag–N, 2.274(14) and 2.489(18) A˚ ; N–Ag–N, 105.9(5) and 102.3(5)] and by an oxygen atom from a COO- group [Ag–O, 2.313(11)A˚ and 2.299(12) A˚ ; N–Ag–O, 95.0(5) and 159.1(6)] attached to the pyridyl ring of bpdc2-. Meanwhile, AgI(3) and AgI(4) atoms, which adopt T-shaped coordination geometries, are coor- dinated by two nitrogen atoms of two pyridyl rings from two different bpdc2- ligands [Ag–N, 2.204(17) and 2.212(17)A˚ ; N–Ag–N, 173.6(6)] and by an oxygen atom a b c Fig. 2 a Asymmetric unit of [Ag2(bpe)2(da)]4H2O (2) and coordi- nation environments around the Ag(I) atoms. The position occupancy factor ratios of C26/C260, C37/C370, and C38/C380 are 0.43(4)/ 0.57(4), 0.57(2)/0.43(2), and 0.57(2)/0.43(2), respectively. b AgAg interactions between the [Ag(bpe)]? chains in the crystal of 2. c Pack view of 3-D network built from rich hydrogen-bonding interactions along c-axis for (2) Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:225–234 231 123 C C O O O O Ag Ag C C C C O O O O O O O O Ag Ag Ag C C N N O O O O Ag Ag Ag Ag a b c Scheme 2 The coordination modes of da2-(a), bptc4-(b), and bpdc2-(c) in the corresponding complexes a b c Fig. 3 a Asymmetric unit of [Ag4(bpe)3(bptc)]9H2O (3) and coordination environments around Ag(I) atoms. b 2-D network built up of 1-D cationic silver-bpe chains linked by multidentate bptc4- ligands. c Packing view of 3-D network built from rich hydrogen- bonding interactions along b-axis for (3) 232 Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:225–234 123 from a COO- group [Ag–O, 2.673(14)A˚ and 2.7084(184) A˚ ; N–Ag–O, 90.6(7) and 92.6(6)] attached to the pyridyl ring of bpdc2-, as illustrated in Fig. 2a and Table 2. Bpe also acts as a typical 4,40-bipyridine-like bidentate ligand to link two Ag atoms via the nitrogen atoms from two pyridyl rings to form an inﬁnite 1-D chain; the dihedral angles between the two pyridyl rings of the same bpe ligands are 16.56(80) and 28.42(80). The bpdc2- ligand, in which the dihedral angle of the two pyridyl rings is 55.68(61), is tetradentate ligand, with coordination mode as shown in Scheme 2 (c), joining two Ag(I) atoms via the nitrogen atoms from two different pyridyl rings, also coordinating the other two Ag(I) atoms via two oxygen atoms from two dif- ferent monodentate COO- groups attached to two different pyridyl rings of the same bpdc2- ligand. The completely deprotonated bpdc2- units also play the role of counter-ion to balance the cationic Ag(I) centers. The Ag1, Ag2, Ag3, and Ag4 atoms are thus assembled into a 3-D sandwich-like framework by bidentate bpe ligands and multidentate bpdc2- ligands, as shown in Fig. 4c. Conclusions Four different silver complexes have been synthesized and characterized by single-crystal diffraction. In all four complexes, bpe acts as a ﬂexible bidentate ligand to join two Ag(I) atoms into 1-D cationic chains, charge balanced by the various anions, bdc2-, da2-, bptc2-, and bpdc2-. The coordination number of silver in these complexes ranges from two to four, resulting in linear [in complexes (1) and (3)], T-shape [in complexes (3) and (4)], trigonal [in complexes (2), (3), and (4)], and tetrahedral [complex (2)] geometries. The rigid bdc2- in complex (1) only acts as a counter-ion, while the more ﬂexible da2-, multidentate bpdc2-, and bptc4- in complexes (2), (3), and (4) act both as O-donor ligands, linking Ag(I) atoms, and as counter- ions to compensate the cationic charge of the crystal structures. The 3-D sandwich-like frameworks of com- plexes (1)–(3) are built up with the aid of supramolecular interactions, including hydrogen-bonding interactions, AgAg and Ag–N contacts, which can be deemed as a b c Fig. 4 a Asymmetric unit of Ag(bpe)2(bpdc)2 (4) and coordination environments around the Ag(I) atoms. b The coordination geometry of Ag(I) atoms and the coordination mode of bpdc2- ligands. c 3-D framework formed by Ag(I) centers, bpe, and bpdc2- ligands Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:225–234 233 123 ‘‘dimension increase’’ from the low-dimensional Ag(I) assemblies.
