Manuscript Synthesis and X-ray crystal structures of a series of 3d–4f lanthanide complexes: lanthanide(III)–copper(II) coordination polymers with 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid ligand Zhuo Wang Æ Yong Heng Xing Æ Chun Guang Wang Æ Xiao Qing Zeng Æ Mao Fa Ge Æ Shu Yun Niu Received: 11 March 2009 / Accepted: 5 June 2009 / Published online: 8 July 2009  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009 Abstract A series of lanthanide–transition metal (Ln–M) complexes, namely, {[Ln2Cu(pydc)4(H2O)3]H2O}n (Ln = Tb, Eu, Sm or Gd) (H2pydc = 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid) have been synthesized hydrothermally by self- assembly of the lanthanide ions, copper(II) ions and 2,5- pyridinedicarboxylic acid. All the complexes were char- acterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods; in addition, structural analyses revealed that all four com- plexes crystallized in monoclinic space group P21/c. The molecular structure contains both Cu and Ln atoms, with pydc ligands bridging the four coordinate Cu(II) centers and eight coordinate lanthanide centers to form a 3-D net structure. Hence, copper is oxidized from Cu(I) to Cu(II) during the preparation. In addition, the thermogravimetric analysis of 1 is discussed. Contrary to expectations, com- pounds 1–3 show no photoluminescent properties. Introduction Over the past decades, considerable attention has been devoted to the design and synthesis of lanthanide–transition metal (Ln–M) complexes due to their potential applications in various areas such as catalysis, magnetism, molecular adsorption and photochemical sensors [1–4]. A variety of heterometallic complexes have been reported so far; how- ever, most of them only possess discrete molecular struc- tures from the crystallographic viewpoint [5–10]. The assembly of extended structures with 3-D Ln–M hetero- metallic coordination frameworks is currently a formidable task [11, 12], because the lanthanide ions have very dif- ferent coordination characteristics from transition metals. Nevertheless, some inﬁnite Ln–M metal compounds have been obtained by conventional self-assembly in solution [13, 14]. Studies on polymeric compounds, especially Cu–Ln polymeric complexes, are still limited compared to those of discrete molecular complexes [6]. We chose 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid as a bridging ligand, because it offers both N- and O-donors. Thus, the carboxylate group can bond to the lanthanide, while the nitrogen atom can bond to transition metal ions, allowing the possibility of 3d–4f heterometallic coordination poly- mers [15–17]. On the other hand, different transition metals also play an important role in the formation of 3-D Ln–M coordination frameworks. It is well known that copper ions are capable of meeting the special requirements of bridging ligands to construct high-dimensional coordination poly- mers. So far, extensive work has been carried out using pyridinedicarboxylate ligands, such as 2,5-pyridinedicar- boxylate acids, and a variety of their coordination polymers have been synthesized [18–23]. According to their struc- tural characterization and composition, it is found that the Ln coordination polymers with 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylate acids can be classiﬁed into three types as follows: (1) Ln–pyridinedicarboxylate–phen systems, e.g., [Dy(Hpydc) (pydc)(phen)(H2O)H2O]n [18]; (2) Ln–polycarboxylate (containing mixed polycarboxylate or simple carboxylate) Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11243-009-9244-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

In order to further understand the synthetic characteristics and various coordination modes of a series of polycarboxylates, our group have focused on the synthesis and structures of novel coordination polymers by using different reaction conditions such as starting materials, temperature and reaction medium. In this paper, four Ln–M coordination polymers with pydc ligand, namely {[Tb2Cu(pydc)4(H2O)3] H2O}n (1), {[Eu2Cu(pydc)4(H2O)3]H2O}n (2), {[Sm2Cu (pydc)4(H2O)3]H2O}n (3) and {[Gd2Cu(pydc)4(H2O)3] H2O}n (4) are reported. Experimental section All chemicals purchased were of reagent grade or better and were used without further puriﬁcation. 2,5-Pyridine- dicarboxylate was purchased from J&K Chemical, all other reagents were purchased from Shenyang pharmacy com- pany chemical reagent glasses apparatus branch. Lantha- nide nitrate salts were prepared by dissolving lanthanide oxides in 6 M HNO3 while adding a small quantity of H2O2 for Tb4O7 and then evaporating at 100 C until a crystal ﬁlm formed. C and H analyses were obtained on a Perkin Elmer 240C automatic analyzer at the analysis center of Liaoning Normal University. Lanthanide contents were analyzed on a Plasma-Spec(I)-AES model ICP spectrometer. Infrared spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-480 PLUS Fourier Transform spectrophotometer with pressed KBr pellets in the range 200–4,000 cm-1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed under N2 atmosphere at 1 atm with a heating rate of 10 C/min on a Perkin Elmer Diamond TG/DTA. The luminescence spectra were reported on a JASCO FP-6500 spectroﬂuo- rimeter (solid) in the range of 200–850 nm. Synthesis of {[Ln2Cu(pydc)4(H2O)3]H2O}n [Ln = Tb(1), Eu(2), Sm(3), Gd(4)] The complexes were prepared by hydrothermal reaction. A solution of Ln(NO3)36H2O (0.01 mmol) and Cu(OAc)2 (0.0190 g, 0.010 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of pydc (0.0167 g, 0.01 mmol) in water (12 mL). The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 5 with 0.1 mL ethylenediamine and 0.1 mL HCl (36–38%). After stirring for 1 h, the mixture was sealed in a bomb and heated at 160 C for 3 days, then cooled at 10 C/3 h to 100 C, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. After ﬁltration, the product was washed with distilled water and then dried at room temperature. Dark blue block crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained in ca. 51% yield based on Tb(III).

X-ray crystallography Suitable single crystals of the complexes were mounted on glass ﬁbers for X-ray measurement. Reﬂection data were collected at room temperature on a Bruker AXS SMART APEX II CCD and Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID IP diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). All absorption corrections were performed using the SADABS program [24]. Crystal structures were solved by the direct method. All nonhy- drogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. All hydrogen atoms of 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid were ﬁxed at cal- culated positions with isotropic thermal parameters and the hydrogen atoms of water molecules were markedly visible in the difference Fourier maps. All calculations were performed using the SHELX-97 program [25]. Crystal data and details of the data collection and the structure reﬁnement are given in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles for complexes 1–4 are listed in Table 2. 656 Transition Met Chem (2009) 34:655–661 123 Results and discussion The hydrothermal reactions of lanthanide salts, pyridine- 2,5-dicarboxylic acid and copper salts resulted in the for- mation of complexes 1–4. It is interesting that although different copper starting materials [Cu(OAc)2 and CuI] were used, we obtained complexes with the same structure. On the other hand, the pH value has an important inﬂuence on the formation of the complexes. Originally, we used triethylamine and ethylenediamine to adjust the pH value of the reaction system to 9; however, we only obtained a small quantity of microcrystals unsuitable for single X-ray diffraction under the hydrothermal conditions. Next, we adjusted the pH value to 5 using HCl. As anticipated, at pH 5, well-formed single crystals of complexes 1–4 suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were obtained in satis- factory yields. It is noteworthy that, in the course of the reaction, the copper(I) was oxidized to copper(II). The composition of complex 3 is similar to that of the previ- ously reported complex [{Sm4Cu2(pydc)8(H2O)12}4H2O]n [23]; however, the method of preparation was different: the ﬁrst method used Sm2O3 and CuO as starting materials and a reaction temperature of 140 C, while the second used Sm(NO3)3 and CuI as starting materials, HCl to adjust the pH value and a reaction temperature of 160 C (Scheme 1). Description of crystal structures The results of elemental analysis, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and TGA analysis reveal that the frameworks of 1–4 are isostructural with the formula {[Ln2Cu(pydc)4 (H2O)3]H2O}n. Thus, complex 1 is taken as a representative example for detailed discussion of the structures. (Figures of complexes 2–4 are listed in the Supplementary material.) The X-ray diffraction study of complex 1 reveals that each asymmetric unit contains one eight-coordinate rare earth atom (Tb), half four-coordinate transition metal (Cu), two pydc ligands and three coordinated water ligands plus one lattice water molecule. The eight atoms coordinated to terbium are four oxygens (O1, O2, O3 and O6) from three pydc ligands, three oxygens (O4, O5 and O7) from three water and one nitrogen (N1) from a pydc ligand, while the copper atom is four coordinated by two oxygen atoms (O9, O9#1) (#1: -x, -y ? 1, -z - 1) from two pydc ligands, and two nitrogen (N2, N2#1) atoms from two pydc ligands. In addition, there is also a weak contact between Cu and O8#2 (Cu–O8#2 = 1.944(14), #2: -x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z) from a pydc ligand. The coordination modes of the Tb and Cu atoms are shown in Fig. 1. The coordination geometry of the Tb center can be described as a square antiprism, while the coordination geometry of the Cu center is exactly Table 1 Crystallographic data for complexes 1–4 1 2 3 4 Formula C28H28N4O24Tb2 C28H28N4O24Eu2 C28H28N4O24Sm2 C28H28N4O24Gd2 M (g mol-1) 1,185.92 1,172.00 1,164.75 1,178.55 Temperature (K) 293(2) 293(2) 293(2) 293(2) Crystal system Monoclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Space group P21/c P21/c P21/c P21/c a (A˚ ) 9.229(2) 9.280(2) 9.299(2) 9.261(2) b (A˚ ) 25.483(5) 25.558(5) 25.588(5) 25.557(5) c (A˚ ) 7.775(2) 7.798(2) 7.816(2) 7.790(2) a () 90 90 90 90 b () 97.29(3) 97.30(3) 97.25(3) 97.31(3) c () 90 90 90 90 V (A˚ 3) 1,813.9(6) 1,834.5(6) 1,844.9(6) 1,828.7(6) Z 2 2 2 2 Dcalc 2.171 2.122 2.097 2.140 l(Mo-Ka)/mm-1 4.540 4.053 3.813 4.263 F(000) 1,150 1,142 1,130 1,138 GOF 1.094 1.183 1.255 1.127 R1 [I [ 2r(I)] 0.0236 0.0232 0.0219 0.0212 R1 (all data) 0.0312 0.0247 0.0258 0.0266 wR2 [I [ 2r(I)] 0.0451 0.0586 0.0675 0.0414 wR2 (all data) 0.0469 0.0593 0.0832 0.0505 Transition Met Chem (2009) 34:655–661 657 123 Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and bond angles () for complexes 1–4 Complex 1 Tb1–O3 2.318(2) Tb1–O2 2.322(2) Tb1–O6 2.363(2) Tb1–O7 2.367(3) Tb1–O5 2.378(3) Tb1–O4 2.403(3) Tb1–O1 2.404(2) Tb1–N1 2.563(3) Cu2–O9 1.944(2) Cu2–N2 1.968(3) O3–Tb1–O2 107.13(9) O3–Tb1–O6 149.43(9) O2–Tb1–O6 82.85(9) O3–Tb1–O7 85.99(10) O2–Tb1–O7 140.48(10) O6–Tb1–O7 104.80(10) O3–Tb1–O5 80.79(10) O2–Tb1–O5 145.88(10) O6–Tb1–O5 75.87(10) O7–Tb1–O5 71.79(11) O3–Tb1–O4 74.67(11) O2–Tb1–O4 76.90(11) O6–Tb1–O4 79.89(10) O7–Tb1–O4 142.32(12) O5–Tb1–O4 73.36(12) O3–Tb1–O1 73.85(8) O2–Tb1–O1 72.64(9) O6–Tb1–O1 136.21(8) O7–Tb1–O1 75.87(10) O5–Tb1–O1 139.90(9) O4–Tb1–O1 126.54(11) Complex 2 Eu1–O3 2.342(2) Eu1–O2 2.344(2) Eu1–O6 2.390(2) Eu1–O12 2.401(3) Eu1–O5 2.412(3) Eu1–O1 2.429(2) Eu1–O4 2.434(3) Eu1–N1 2.592(3) Cu2–O10 1.946(3) Cu2–N2 1.970(3) O3–Eu1–O2 107.07(9) O3–Eu1–O6 149.22(8) O2–Eu1–O6 83.12(9) O3–Eu1–O12 86.05(10) O2–Eu1–O12 140.16(9) O6–Eu1–O12 104.83(9) O3–Eu1–O5 71.59(10) O2–Eu1–O5 146.49(9) O6–Eu1–O5 76.05(9) O12–Eu1–O5 71.79(11) O3–Eu1–O1 74.43(8) O2–Eu1–O1 72.37(9) O6–Eu1–O1 135.88(8) O12–Eu1–O1 75.56(9) O5–Eu1–O1 139.66(9) O3–Eu1–O4 74.64(10) O2–Eu1–O4 76.95(10) O6–Eu1–O4 79.80(9) O12–Eu1–O4 142.57(10) O5–Eu1–O4 73.76(11) O1–Eu1–O4 126.90(9) Complex 3 Sm–O2 2.357(3) Sm–O9 2.361(3) Sm–O5 2.405(3) Sm–O12 2.412(3) Sm–O11 2.428(4) Sm–O1 2.441(3) Sm–O10 2.447(4) Sm–N1 2.597(3) Cu–O7 1.959(3) Cu–N2 1.971(3) O2–Sm–O9 107.55(11) O2–Sm–O5 148.87(11) O9–Sm–O5 82.96(11) O2–Sm–O12 85.87(12) O9–Sm–O12 140.06(13) O5–Sm–O12 104.99(12) O2–Sm–O11 79.85(12) O9–Sm–O11 146.38(13) O5–Sm–O11 76.24(12) O12–Sm–O11 71.83(13) O2–Sm–O1 75.07(10) O9–Sm–O1 72.31(11) O5–Sm–O1 135.61(10) O12–Sm–O1 75.45(12) O11–Sm–O1 139.80(12) O2–Sm–O10 74.64(14) O9–Sm–O10 76.8(2) O5–Sm–O10 79.71(13) O12–Sm–O10 142.9(2) O11–Sm–O10 73.8(2) O1–Sm–O10 126.93(13) Complex 4 Gd1–O3 2.331(2) Gd1–O2 2.337(2) Gd1–O6 2.377(2) Gd1–O5 2.387(3) Gd1–O7 2.401(3) Gd1–O1 2.421(3) Gd1–O4 2.422(2) Gd1–N1 2.572(3) Cu2–O10 1.950(3) Cu2–N2 1.967(3) O3–Gd1–O2 106.88(9) O3–Gd1–O6 149.31(9) O2–Gd1–O6 83.24(9) O3–Gd1–O5 86.31(10) O2–Gd1–O5 140.25(10) O6–Gd1–O5 104.51(10) O3–Gd1–O7 80.76(10) O2–Gd1–O7 146.31(11) O6–Gd1–O7 75.84(10) O5–Gd1–O7 71.63(11) O3–Gd1–O1 74.63(10) O2–Gd1–O1 77.22(11) O6–Gd1–O1 79.79(10) O5–Gd1–O1 142.26(12) O7–Gd1–O1 73.32(12) O3–Gd1–O4 74.06(9) O2–Gd1–O4 72.47(9) O6–Gd1–O4 136.15(8) O5–Gd1–O4 75.75(10) O7–Gd1–O4 139.69(10) O1–Gd1–O4 126.99(10) 658 Transition Met Chem (2009) 34:655–661 123 square planer. The Tb–Opydc and Tb–Ow bond distances are in the range of 2.318(2)–2.404(2) A˚ and 2.367(3)– 2.403(3) A˚ , respectively, while Tb–N is 2.563(3) A˚ . The Cu–Opydc length is 1.944(2) A˚ , and the Cu–N bond distance is 1.968(3) A˚ , which are comparable to the corresponding bonds distances reported in similar frameworks [22, 23]. The pydc ligands show two coordination types: one adopts a tridentate chelating–bridging coordination mode through a bridge involving a pyridyl ring, linking one copper(II) and one terbium(III) center, and the other adopts a pentadentate chelating–bridging mode through both short and long bridges, linking one copper(II) and three ter- bium(III) centers. These are shown in Scheme 2a, c. In order to achieve an in-depth understanding of the frameworks, it is important to explore the connections between the metal centers and carboxylate ligands. In complex 1, two crystallographically equivalent Tb atoms are bridged by two oxygen atoms from the 2-carboxylate of a pydc ligand to form a 1-D inorganic chain of –Tb–O–C– O–Tb– atoms along the [001] direction (Fig. 2a). These 1-D chains are linked by oxygen atoms from the 5-car- boxylate groups of Pydc ligands in the [110] direction to form a 2-D layer (Fig. 2b). When the 2-D layer is viewed along the [100] direction, a zigzag structure chain is observed (Fig. 2c). The zigzag layer structures are further connected by a structural unit of Cu(pydc)2 to form a 3-D open framework (Fig. 3). Complex 1 has a similar structure to the complex [{Sm4Cu2(pydc)8(H2O)12}4H2O]n, but there are also dif- ferences. First, with respect to the coordination environ- ments of the metal centers: in complex 1, each terbium center is coordinated by one nitrogen and four oxygen atoms from four pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acids and three oxygen atoms from coordinated water ligands; for [{Sm4Cu2(pydc)8(H2O)12}4H2O]n, each samarium(III) center is coordinated by one nitrogen and four oxygen atoms from four pydc ligands and three oxygen atoms from coordinated water molecules. Second, concerning the coordination modes of pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid: these are shown in Scheme 2a, c for complex 1; in Scheme 2a, b for [{Sm4Cu2(pydc)8(H2O)12}4H2O]n. The corresponding Sm–O, Sm–N, Cu–O and Cu–N bond lengths for the complexes are as follows: [{Sm4Cu2(pydc)8(H2O)12} 4H2O]n (Sm–O, 2.357(3)–2.447(4) A˚ ; Sm–N, 2.597(3) A˚ ; Cu–O, 1.944(2) A˚ ; Cu–N, 1.968(3) A˚ ); complex 1 (Tb–O, 2.318(2)–2.407(2) A˚ ; Tb–N, 2.563(3) A˚ ; Cu–O, 1.944(2) A˚ ; Cu–N, 1.968(3) A˚ ). Thermal stability and photoluminescence The thermal stability of complex 1 in N2 atmosphere was examined by thermogravimetry in the temperature range of 50–1000 C. As shown in Fig. 4, the thermal decomposi- tion process of complex 1 can be divided into two stages.

In the second stage, in the range of 250–852 C, there is a 17.5% weight loss, which is attributed to the release of one pydc and two nicotinic acids molecules (17.5% theoretical weight loss). The solid-state luminescence properties of complexes 1–3 were investigated at room temperature. The spectra show clearly that no emissions from the Ln–Cu complexes are observed; whereas in Ln–pydc complexes, the Ln atoms do show luminescent character [21, 22], this indicates that ﬂuorescence quenching occurs when Cu is introduced. Conclusion Four isostructural complexes {[Ln2Cu(pydc)4(H2O)3] H2O}n (Ln = Tb, Eu, Sm, Gd) have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. Control of pH is found to be an important factor in the synthesis. For complexes 1–4, the 3-D frameworks are composed of zigzag chains, which are connected by pydc ligands, further linked by a struc- tural unit of Cu(pydc)2 to form 3-D framework. By com- parison of the reported complexes, changes in the synthesis conditions could help to prepare different structures.
