The crystal structure, stability, porosity, and framework flexibility of the new compound MCF-44 were studied in detail and compared with its analogs. De- pending on their shapes and the bridging angles of the ligands, these compounds possess different network connectivities and porosities. Considering the pyridylbenzote ligands and Mn(II) ions as, respectively, 3- and 6-connected nodes, they resemble either the anatase (ant) or rutile (rtl) polymorph of TiO2. Variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed large thermal expansion coefficients for these compounds, which are probably related to the relatively flexible edge-sharing polyhedral structure of their Mn-carboxylate chains. Interestingly, the new compound MCF-44, with its highly porous rtl structure exhibits the largest thermal expansion coefficienct among the coordination polymers reported so far. coordination polymer, thermal expansion, framework flexibility, topology 1 Introduction Porous coordination polymers (PCPs) or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted great interest for their potential applications to separation, catalysis, luminescence, sensors, etc. [1–8]. Recent research has shown that PCPs are very promising for designing thermoresponsive materials because of their flexible frameworks and adjustable pore metrics [9–20]. For examples, the porous silver(I) triazolate framework FMOF-1, [Ag(Tz)] (HTz = 3,5-bis(trifluorome- thyl)-1,2,4-triazole), simultaneously exhibits both huge lin- ear positive thermal expansion (PTE) ( = +230 × 106 K1) and negative thermal expansion (NTE) ( = –170 × 106 K1) [13]. The cubic porous copper(II) carboxylate framework HKUST-1, [Cu3(btc)2] (H3btc = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid), exhibits very rare isotropic NTE ( = 4.1 × 106 K1) property [14]. Because most solids display small PTE (0 <  < +20 × 106 K1) [21], materials with these unusual thermal-expansion properties may be useful as thermal- expansion compensators or thermomechanical actuators [22–25]. Although understanding the structural origins or mechanisms is crucial obviously for tuning the thermal ex- pansion behaviors of these materials, the design and con- struction of PCPs with exceptionally large thermal expan- sion coefficients remain an important challenge. We recently reported the design, synthesis, structure and exceptional thermal expansion properties of a flexible ultr- amicroporous metal-carboxylate framework [Mn(34-pba)2] (MCF-34, 1, 34-Hpba = 3-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoic acid) con- sisting of one-dimensional (1D) zigzag Mn-carboxylate chains [20]. In this framework, the ligand 34-Hpba, bearing a low rotational energy barrier between its pyridyl and phe- nyl rings, serves as a tripodal node to connect the octahedral 366 Zhou HL, et al. Sci China Chem March (2014) Vol.57 No.3 metal ions to construct an ultramicropous network with a (3,6)-connected ant (anatase) topology (Figure 1). By virtue of the unique ligand and framework structures, MCF-34 exhibits constant/huge PTE ( = +224 × 106 K1) and NTE ( = 170 × 106 K1). In this context, it should be interest- ing to study the thermal expansion behaviors of similar framework structures consisting of similar metal ions and organic ligands. In this work, we used two similar pyridylbenzate ligands with different conformations to construct two similar (3,6)- connected frameworks consisting of Mn-carboxylate chains. Variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction stud- ies showed that the thermal expansion coefficients of these compounds are closely related to their framework topolo- gies and porosities. In addition, not only constant and very large PTE/NTE properties ( = 381 × 106 K1 and 148 × 106 K1), as well as interesting framework flexibility were observed for the new porous metal-carboxylate framework. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and general methods Commercially available reagents were used as received without further purification. The ligands 4-(pyridin-3-yl) benzoic acid (43-Hpba) and 4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoic acid (44-Hpba) were synthesized according to Ref. [26]. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker TENSOR 27 Fourier Transform FT-IR Spectrophotometer (Bruker, Ger- many) on KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400 cm1. Ele- mental (C, H, and N) analyses (EA) were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240 Elemental analyzer (PerkinElmer, Inc., USA). Thermogravimetry analyses were performed on a TA Q50 system (TA Instruments-Waters, LLC., USA) in flow- ing N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min1. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray Diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) with Cu K radiation. The CO2 adsorption measurement was performed with an automatic volumetric adsorption appa- ratus (Belsorp-Max, Japan) at 195 K. 2.2 Synthesis [Mn(43-pba)2] (2, MCF-43) 43-Hpba (0.40 g, 2.0 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (90 mL) using a 250-mL vial and then added to a DMF solution of MnCl2 (0.1 mol L1, 10 mL) and methanol (80 mL). The mixture was then sealed with a screw cap and heated to 90 °C for 72 h. Colorless needle-like crystals of 2 were fil- tered and washed by DMF (yield 720 mg, ~80%).

A single crystal of 2 was mounted on the top of a glass fiber, while a single crystal of as-synthesized 3 (just removed from the DMF) was sealed in a glass capillary. The test temperature was controlled by dry N2 flow using a Cryo Stream 700 system (Agilent Technologies, USA), and corrected by a thermal couple at the crystal position. The variable temperature unit-cell parameters were obtained by indexing the diffrac- tion spots that were obtained with a few diffraction images. The crystal structures were solved through the direct meth- od and developed by the difference Fourier technique using the SHELXTL software package. Anisotropic thermal pa- rameters were used to refine all non-hydrogen atoms of the frameworks. Hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically and refined in a riding model. The relatively large R-factor for the 144-K structure indicates that the guest molecules relocate to an arrangement that cannot be modeled well in the crystal structure. Actually, when the guest molecules were omitted by the SQUEEZE routine of Platon, the R-factor decreased drastically (Table 1 and Table S1, see the supporting information online). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Syntheses and structures [Mn(43-pba)2] (2) and [Mn(44-pba)2]·2.5DMF (3) were obtained in high yield and purity through solvothermal re- actions similar to 1 [20]. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that 2 is a nonporous coordination framework [27] that can also be simplified as a (3,6)-connected ant topolo- gy if the 44-pba− ligands and Mn2+ ions are regarded as 3- and 6-connected nodes, respectively, that are isoreticular with 1 [20]. However, 3 crystallizes in a monoclinic space group P21/c and consists of 1D Mn-carboxylate chains. The asymmetric unit of the host framework includes one Mn2+ ion (two independent atoms, each with half-occupancy), two 44-pba− ligands and 2.5 DMF guest molecules. Each Mn2+ ion is coordinated by two N atoms and four O atoms from six pba− ligands in a distorted octahedral geometry, Table 1 Crystal data and structural refinement results Complex 3 3 Formula C31.5H33.5N4.5O6.5Mn C31.5H33.5N4.5O6.5Mn Formula weight 670.61 670.61 Temperature (K) 144(2) 298(2) Crystal system Monoclinic Monoclinic Space group P21/c P21/c a (Å) 9.7821(2) 9.8457(5) b (Å) 19.9160(4) 19.4937(10) c (Å) 16.1047(4) 16.7455(9)  (o) 93.581(2) 94.348(4) V (Å3) 3131.40(12) 3204.7(3) Z 4 4 Dc (g cm3) 1.345 1.314 Reflns coll. 9782 11032 Unique reflns 4606 4722 Rint 0.0326 0.0418 R1 [I > 2(I)]a) 0.1073 0.0695 wR2 [I > 2(I)]b) 0.3035 0.1826 R1 (all data) 0.1236 0.0852 wR2 (all data) 0.3216 0.1951 GOF 1.053 1.057 a) R1 = {Fo  Fc}/Fo; b) wR2 = [w(Fo 2  Fc 2)2/w(Fo 2)2]1/2. and each 44-pba− is bound to three Mn2+ ions by two car- boxylate oxygen and one pyridyl nitrogen donors. Therefore, the overall coordination framework of 3 can be also simpli- fied as a (3,6)-connected topology similar to those of 1 and 2. However, detailed analysis showed that 3 possesses a rtl (rutile) topology. It should be noted that anatase and rutile are two typical polymorphic phases of TiO2 (Figure 1). By taking advantage of a recently proposed topological analysis approach [28], the 1D Mn-carboxylate chains in 1–3 can be treated as rod-like secondary building units (i.e.. rod SBUs). Based on these rod SBUs, 1/2 and 3 are simplified as two new (5,8)-connected nets with point symbols (34.43.52.6) (38.49.56.64.7) and (34.42.54)(38.48.56.65.7), respectively. For reference, these two new topologies have been registered in the RCSR database with codenames zhl and hlz, respec- tively. As shown in Figure 2, the rod SBUs of 1, 2, and 3 are all edge-sharing octahedra, which may produce notable framework flexibility because the commonly observed rod SBUs are all face-sharing octahedra [28, 29]. The variation of network connectivity among 1–3 can be attributed to the different bridging angles of the pyridylcarboxylate ligands, which for 34-pba− and 43-pba− are 120o, while for 44-pba− it is 180o. This difference is clearly demonstrated by the dif- ferent coordination configuration of the MnN2O4 sphere, in which 1 and 2 adopt a cis conformation whereas 3 has a trans conformation. Similarly to 1 and 2, adjacent Mn2+ ions in 3 are bridged by exo-bidentate carboxylate groups to form a 1D Mn-carboxylate chain along the a-axis, and ad- jacent Mn-carboxylate chains are connected to each other through the pyridyl ends of the ligands and the residual 368 Zhou HL, et al. Sci China Chem March (2014) Vol.57 No.3 Figure 2 Deconstruction of the 1D Mn-carboxylate chains in MCF-34 (a) and MCF-44 (b) into a rod of edge-sharing octahedra and their underlying nets of these rods, zhl (c) and hlz (d), linked by ditopic linkers. coordination sites of Mn2+ ions, all of which create large 1D rhombic channels (cross-section size ~6.2 × 6.7 Å2, guest- accessible volume = 46.3%) parallel to the Mn-carboxylate chains. Although the pore size of 3 is quite large, 2.5 DMF molecules can be modeled in its crystal structure (1.5 are ordered and the remaining 1 is two-fold disordered). 3.2 Framework stability, flexibility, and porosity The thermogravimetry curve of 3 showed a weight loss of 28.3% below 200 °C, which corresponded to the removal of DMF molecules (calcd. 28.8%), followed by a steady plat- eau until decomposition above 400 °C (Figure S1). Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of guest-free 3 (Figure S2) show that this is a new phase with a drastic contraction but poor crystallinity. The original crystallinity can be restored in DMF vapor, however, which indicates that the framework is distorted rather than collapsed. The CO2 sorption isotherm of guest-free 3 (Figure S3) was collected at 195 K to evalu- ate its porosity. The low CO2 uptake (24.7 cm3 g1) indi- cates that the vacant framework has a drastic contraction. 3.3 Thermal expansion properties Some recent examples have revealed the role of framework composition (e.g., metal ion [15], ligand [18], and guest [9, 13, 19, 20]) on the magnitude of thermal-expansion coeffi- cients. However, the underlying mechanics of thermal ex- pansion remain poorly understood. Understanding the ther- mal expansion mechanisms of a series of structurally similar analogs should be highly desirable for rationally designing thermoresponsive materials. For comparision with com- pound 1, the thermal expansion behaviors of compounds 2 and 3 were studied with variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments (Figure 3, Tables 2 and S2), and the thermal expansion coefficients of the principal axes (a′, b′, and c′) were calculated by using the PASCal program [30]. The unit-cell parameters of 2 and 3 changed linearly and reversibly against temperature. From 156 to 271 K, the unit-cell volume of 2 increased 0.8%, corresponding to a relatively large coefficient of thermal expansion +65(3) × 106 K1. Meanwhile, it’s a-, b-, and c-axes change +0.46%, +0.21%, and 0.05%, respectively, giving linear thermal expansion coefficients a′ = 49(5) × 106 K1,b′ = 20(4) × 106 K1 andc′ = 6(3) × 106 K1 (Table 2). Interestingly, compound 3 showed extremely large ther- mal expansion. Its unit-cell volume expanded 3.2% from 144 to 278 K, which corresponded to the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient of 259(20) × 106 K1. The unit-cell parameters b and c change 1.8% and 4.2%, respectively, which corresponded to exceptionally huge axial NTE (b′ = 148(12) × 106 K1) and PTE (c′ = 381(23) × 106 K1): this is one of the largest PTE/NTE of framework materials reported to date [13, 18–20]. To reveal the structural origin of the exceptionally large thermal expansion of 3, we com- pared its single-crystal structures measured at 144 and 298 K and found that the change were very small in coordina- tion-bond lengths (< 0.014 Å) but very large in the angles (max = 1.2°) (Table S3). Consequently, the rhombus grids consisting of Mn vertexes and 44-pba− edges were distorted (Figure S4). The two interior angles of these rhombus grids, with their bisectors parallel to the b- and c-axes, changes of approximately 3.4° and 3.4°, respectively (Figure S4 and Table S4). These changes caused a typical lattice-fence ef- fect on the bc-plane, which resulted in the large NTE/PTE of the b-/c-axes. Notably, the thermal expansion coefficients were 3 > 1 > 2 (Table 2), which are in accordance with their guest- accessible volumes. This indicated that the free space plays an important role in the expansion and contraction of the frameworks, processes that are necessary to accommodate a chemical or physical stimulus that results in the reversible movement of “soft” coordination bonds and flexible links [31]. Interestingly, the a′-axis thermal expansion of 2 was the largest among 1–3, although its volumetric coefficient was the smallest because of its nonporous framework. The- se abnormal thermal expansion behaviors are likely related to the rod of edge-sharing octahedra along the a-axis in 1–3. One structural requirement for framework flexibility is the existence of certain “weak points” in the local coordination networks [31]. Several frameworks based on zigzag ladder (which can also be viewed as edge-sharing square) SBUs showed such structural dynamics. Likewise, compared with those face-sharing octahedra, the relatively flexible edge- sharing rods in the zhl and hlz nets provided such “weak points” leading to expansion and contraction under chemical Zhou HL, et al.

When temperature changes, 1 and 3 could expand and contract across the bc-plane or the cross sections of their channels, whereas the nonporous frame- work of 2 could deform only along the rod direction (i.e. the weak points). In addition, the thermal expansion coeffi- cients of b- and c-axes of 3 were the opposite of those of 1 and 2, which may be ascribed to the different coordination configurations of the Mn(II) ions and framework topologies of 1/2 and 3. 4 Conclusions In summary, (3,6)-connected ant- and rtl-type metal car- boxylate frameworks were synthesized by reacting MnCl2 with different pyridylcarboxylate ligands under solvother- mal conditions. These metal carboxylate frameworks pos- sess 1D Mn-carboxylate chains, which can be interpreted as flexible rods of edge-sharing octahedra. Besides framework stability, guest-induced framework breathing, and gas sorp- tion properties, the thermal expansion behavior of the new compound MCF-44 was also studied in detail and compared with its structural analogs. Notably, MCF-44 exhibited ex- ceptionally large thermal expansion coefficients, which we attributed to its relatively large pore volume and Mn- carboxylate chains.
