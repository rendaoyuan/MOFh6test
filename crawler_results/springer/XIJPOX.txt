Manuscript COMMUNICATION Synthesis, Characterizations and Luminescent Properties of Two Cadmium(II) Coordination Polymers Derived from Bis(Benzimidazole)-Based Ligands Shu Lin Xiao • Li Qin • Cui Hong He • Xu Du • Guang Hua Cui Received: 5 September 2012 / Accepted: 11 January 2013 / Published online: 22 January 2013  Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013 Abstract Two Cd(II) coordination polymers, namely, {[Cd(L1)(chdc)](CH3CN)(H2O)2}n (1) and [Cd(L2)Cl2]n (2) (L1 = 1,4-bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-1-ylmethyl) benzene, L2 = 1,2-bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-1-ylme thyl)benzene, H2chdc = 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid ) have been obtained by hydrothermal methods and char- acterized by IR, TG, elemental analysis, XPRD and single crystal structure analysis. The Cd(II) atom has a distorted octahedral coordination geometry in 1 and a roughly square-pyramidal coordination geometry in 2. Polymer 1 possesses a two-dimensional (2D) ﬂat (6,3) network con- structed with L1 and chdc bridging ligands. Polymer 2 displays a one-dimensional (1D) loop-like chain structure bridged by chlorine anions and L2 ligand, which is further arranged into a 2D supramolecular layer through face-to- face p–p stacking interactions. The luminescent properties of the polymers 1 and 2 were investigated in the solid-state. Keywords Bis(benzimidazole)  Cadmium(II) coordination polymer  Crystal structure  Luminescent properties 1 Introduction The last two decades have shown impressive progress in the design and synthesis of a new type of material generally referred to as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and/or coordination polymers. These materials not only have interesting molecular structures and fascinating variety of topologies, but also have potential applications in gas adsorption and separation, luminescence, non-linear optics, phase transformation, magnetism and heterogeneous catal- ysis [1–5]. However, the controllable synthesis of MOFs with desired architectures is still a great challenge because there are many chemical and physical factors that play important roles in the assembly process, such as the molecular structures of the ligands, nature of the metal ions, reaction temperature, pH value, solvent, and supra- molecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding and p–p stacking interactions [6–9]. Therefore, a great deal of effort is required to extend our knowledge of structural design and to establish proper synthetic strategies that lead to the desired species with predictable structures and properties. Generally, the selection of a suitable ligand is the key step in engendering MOFs with desirable dimension. So far, a variety of coordination polymers with different bridging ligands have been synthesized. In particular, bi- or multi- dentate ﬂexible bridging ligands containing N- or O-donors have been comprehensively used to bind metal centers to generate one-, two- and three-dimensional inﬁnite metal– organic frameworks [10–15]. Bis(benzimidazole)-containing ﬂexible ligands on para-, meta- and ortho-xylene as a bridging spacer moiety have been well-used in crystal engi- neering and are of particular interest in coordination chem- istry [16–19], since they are effective bridging ligands. The ﬂexible nature of –(Ph-CH2)– spacers allows the ligand to bend and rotate when it coordinates to metal centers so as to conform to the coordination geometries of metal ions [20–22]. In contrast, the most outstanding compound of benzimidazole derivatives are 5,6–dimethylbenzimidazole, which serves as an axial ligand for cobalt in vitamin B12 [23].

In this paper, we have embarked on the synthesis of two ﬂexible bis-benzimidazole-based ligands, 1,4-bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-1-ylmethyl)benzene and 1,2-bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-1-ylmethyl)benzene. We used these ligands to react with a Cd(II) salt under hydro- thermal conditions; and, a 2D [3, 6] ﬂat topology, {[Cd(L1)(chdc)](CH3CN)(H2O)2}n (1), and a 1D loop-like chain structure, [Cd(L2)Cl2]n (2), were obtained and characterized. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Physical Measurements All chemicals used were analytical reagents and commer- cially purchased (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd). The hydrothermal syntheses were performed in Teﬂon-lined stainless steel autoclaves. Ligands L1 and L2 were prepared according to the literature [27] (Scheme 1). IR spectra were obtained with a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr pellets in the 4,000–400 cm-1 range. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were carried out with a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. The TG measurements were carried out with a NETZSCH TG 209 thermal analyzer from room temperature to 800 C in a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 C min-1. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) was recor- ded on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer at 40 kV, 100 mA for a CuKa tube (k = 1.54178 A˚ ). The photolumi- nescence spectra for compounds samples were determined with a Cary Eclipse ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer. UV-Vis spectra of 1, 2 and ligands L1 and L2 were obtained with an Hitachi UV-3010 spectrophotometer in DMF solution (2.0 9 10-5 mol dm3) at 298 K. 2.2 Crystallographic Data Collection and Reﬁnement The single crystal X-ray data of coordination polymers 1 and 2 were collected using MoKa X-ray radiation with a Bruker SMART 1000 CCD diffractometer at 298 K. A single crystal suitable for X-ray diffraction was mounted on a glass ﬁber. The structure was solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares based on F2 using SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 [28]. The non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically and the H-atoms were geometrically included in the ﬁnal reﬁnement. The ﬁnal cycle of full-matrix least-squares reﬁnement is based on observed reﬂections and variable parameters. In the struc- ture of 1, the two lattice water and one CH3CN molecules are disordered. Thus, this structure was reﬁned by the SQUEEZE routine of the PLATON program [29]. The void solvent accessible volume of 1 is 595.4 A˚ 3 and the percent of per unit cell volume is 17.4 %. Selected crystallographic and experimental details and also interatomic distances are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. 2.3 Synthesis of {[Cd(L1)(chdc)](CH3CN)(H2O)2}n (1) A mixture of Cd(NO3)2 . 4H2O (23.6 mg, 0.1 mmol), L1 (39.5 mg, 0.1 mmol), H2chdc (34.4 mg, 0.1 mmol), CH3 CN (1 mL), and H2O (4 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless vessel and heated to 140 C for 3-d under autogenous pressure, and then cooled to room tem- perature at a cooling rate of 5 C h. The slightly yellow block-shaped crystal of 1 was obtained by ﬁltration. 1 was washed with distilled water and dried in the air; yield, 50.4 % [based on Cd(NO3)2 . 4H2O]. Anal.

In 1, a strong band at 3,380 cm-1 is assigned to mOH stretching vibrations of the lattice water molecules. The broadness of this band suggests the H-bonding. The C=N stretching vibration of the benzimidazolyl group (1,539 cm-1) is blue-shifted by 48 cm-1 relative to free the free ligand (1,491 cm-1), and is consistent with coordination of L1 to Cd(II). Furthermore, the carboxylate group asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations are observed at 1,720 and 1,410 cm-1, respectively, for free 1,4-cyclohexanecarbox- ylic acid, while in 1 these bands occur at 1,630 and 1,419 cm-1, respectively. The separation, Dm[mas(COO)- ms(COO)], is 111 cm-1 and indicates the presence of che- lating coordination of the carboxylic groups [30]. The absorption spectra of the ligands 1 and 2 in DMF solution were measured at room temperature (Figure S1–S2, SupportingInformation).Thestrongbandsat266,282,291 nm (for L1), 265, 283, 291 nm (for complex 1), 282, 291 nm (for L2), and 264, 285, 291 nm (for complex 2) are ascribed to the p ? p* transition within the benzimidazolyl rings.

The ORTEP diagram of the coordination environment of Cd(II) atom is depicted in Fig. 1a. The structural motif of 1 consists of one 6-coordinated Cd(II) ion that located in the mirror plane of the C2/m space group, one-half a L1 ligand, and one-half a chdc diatomic anion possessing chelating bis-bidentate carboxylate groups. The crystallographically independent Cd(II) center lies in a dis- torted octahedral coordination environment and is completed by two N-donors (N1 and N1B) of two L1 ligands and four O-donors (O1, O1B, O2A, and O3A, symmetry codes: A = -x ? 1, y, - z ? 1, B = x, -y ? 1, z) from two chelating carboxylate groups of distinct chdc ligands. The atoms O1, O3A, O2A, N1 compose the equatorial positions and N1B, O1B hold the axial positions. The Cd–O bond lengths range from 2.238(4) to 2.455(4) A˚ , while the Cd–N1 and Cd–N1B bond lengths are both 2.278(2) A˚ , all lying within the reasonable bonding range as estimated from crystallographic determination (Table 2). The O–Cd–O or O–Cd–N or N–Cd–N bond angles are far from the typical octahedral 90 or 180; they range from 51.73 to 135.78 for O–Cd–O, 84.97 to 132.81 for O–Cd–N and 104.12 for Fig. 1 a ORTEP drawing of 1 with thermal ellipsoids drawn at 30 % probability and the coordination environment of Cd(II) atom. The hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity (Symmetry codes: A = -x ? 1, y, -z ? 1, B = x, -y ? 1, z). b 2D ﬂat structure of 1. c 2D (6, 3) ﬂat network of 1. d 2D supramolecular network of 1 stabilized by p…p stacking interactions 774 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2013) 23:771–778 123 N–Cd–N angles. Thus, as a node, the adjacent Cd(II)-atoms are inﬁnitely linked by L1 ligands to generate a zigzag chain with shorter separations of Cd•••Cd being 14.8789(13) A˚ and the angle of Cd–Cd–Cd being 67.74. The zigzag chains are further bridged by chdc ligands, which adopt a bis- bidentate l2-g4 bridging mode to connect two Cd(II)-atoms to form an 18-membered ring with the nearest Cd•••Cd distance between the zigzag chains of 7.8343(8) A˚ (Fig. 1b). The L1 ligands exhibit a trans form with two coplanar benzimidazole rings from same L1 ligand; the chdc ligands possess a cis form and the two hexamethylene rings from two chdc diatomic anions within one 18-membered annulus are parallel. Therefore, each 6-coordinated Cd(II) center is connected by two L1 and two chdc ligands to form a 2D ﬂat topography with honeycomb like 63 topology (Fig. 1c). In addition, the strong p–p stacking interactions between the benzene and imidazole rings from different L1 ligands make the ﬂat topologies more stable and result in self-assembly to a supramolecular structure with a centroid-to-centroid dis- tance of 3.65(7) A˚ , slipping angles b or c of 16.12o or 16.62o, and an average dp–p distance of 3.5034(12) A˚ (Fig. 1d). The X-ray diffraction study of 2 reveals an asymmetric unit consisting of one Cd(II) center, one L2 ligand, one terminal chlorine anion and two l2 bridging chlorine anions, which sit on inversion centers in triclinic P-1. Cd1 is located in the center of a roughly square-pyramidal geometry (s factor, 0.48 [31]), which is formed by three Cl- atoms and two N-atoms from two bridging L2 ligands (Fig. 2a). The four atoms, Cl1, Cl2, Cl1A and N1, form a tapered bottom and the N-atom (N3) is located in the conic node. The distance from the conic node to the tapered bottom is 2.257 A˚ . The Cd–Cl bond lengths vary from 2.4432(10) to 2.8101(9) A˚ , the Cd–N bond lengths vary from 2.261(3) to 2.357(3) A˚ and the coordination bond angles range from 80.34(3) to 167.18(7) (Table 2). Complex 2 displays an interesting inﬁnite 1D loop-like chain structure composed of two kinds of rings; i.e., a smaller 4-membered ring and the larger 24-membered ring (Fig. 2b). The smaller ring is formed by two chlorine Fig. 2 a ORTEP drawing of 2 with thermal ellipsoids drawn at 30 % probability and the coordination environment of Cd(II) atom. The hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. (Symmetry codes: A = -x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z ? 2). b 1D inﬁnite looped-like structure of 2. c 2D supramolecular structure of 2 formed by p…p stacking interactions J Inorg Organomet Polym (2013) 23:771–778 775 123 anions bridging two Cd(II) ions with a CdCd distance is 4.0455(7) A˚ ; the larger ring is made up of two L2 mole- cules bridging two Cd(II) ions with a CdCd distance is 15.834(2) A˚ . Each L2 exhibits a trans conformation with the dihedral angle between the two benzimidazole planes of 81.259. The above two kinds of rings are connected alternately via Cd(II) ions to form an inﬁnite 1D chain. Moreover, the adjacent looped chains are nearly parallel with a dihedral angle of 1.267(4), which results in for- mation of strong p–p stacking interactions between benz- imidazole rings of distinct L2 ligands. Thus, the looped chains are expanded to a 2D supramolecular network by p–p stacking interactions (Fig. 2c), with a center-to-center distance of 3.541(2) A˚ , an inter-planar angle a of 1.27(2), slipping angles b or c of 14.67o or 13.92 and an average dp–p distance of 3.431(4) A˚ . In addition, there appears to be C–HCl hydrogen bonding interactions between benzyl C-atoms and Cl-atoms, which stabilize the 2D supramo- lecular structure. The distance of H20ACl2 is 2.60(4) A˚ and the bond angel for C20–H20ACl2 is 167. Cd(II) coordination polymers based on the L1, L2 or similar bis(benzimidazole)derivativesandpolycarboxylateshavebeen scarcely reported. Hou and co workers [32] prepared four Cd(II)-ferrocenesuccinate (FcCOC2H4COO) coordination compounds with the formulas [Cd(g2-FcCOC2H4COO)2 (pbbbm)]2, [Cd(g2-FcCOC2H4COO)(pbbbm)Cl]2, [Cd(g2- FcCOC2H4COO)-(pbbbm)I]2 and {[Cd(g2-FcCOC2-H4 COO)(mbbbm)Cl].(H2O)2.75}n [pbbbm = 1,4-bis(benzimid- azole-1-ylmethyl)benzene), mbbbm = 1,3-bis(benzimidazole -1-ylmethyl)benzene)]. The former three complexes are dimers and bridged by pbbbm and the last complex has chain-like structure bridged by chlorine anions and adjacent mbbbm ligand. Furthermore, Wang et al. reported two 3D Cd(II) coordination polymers: [Cd3(bbbm)3(SIP)2(H2O)4].2H2O and [Cd(bbbm)(NIP)] (bbbm = 1,1-(1,4-butanediyl)bis-1H-benz- imidazole, H3SIP = 5-sulfoisophthalic acid and H2NIP = 5- nitroisophthalic acid) [33]. In the [Cd3(bbbm)3(SIP)2(H2O)4]. 2H2O polymer,Cd(II) ions are connected by SIPanionsto form 2D layers containing a 12-membered macrocycle, which is further connected by the bbbm linkers to form a 3D (3,3,4,4,4)- connected framework with a (3.6.73.8)(3.6.7)(3.62.73)(6.72) (6.74.10) topology. The complex, [Cd(bbbm)(NIP)], displays a 3D 8-connected framework with a (424.64) topology connected by bbbm ligands and NIP anions. The complexes reported here have diverse structures: 1 displays a 2D (6,3) ﬂat network and 2 exhibits a 1D loop-like chain. This implies that different car- boxylatesandanionsplayanimportantroleinthe assemblyand structure of the title complexes. 3.3 Thermal Properties To investigate the thermal stability of 1 and 2, TGA were performed (Figure S3 and Figure S4, Supporting Information). The decomposition of 1 occurs in two dis- tinct stages. The ﬁrst weight loss of 7.9 % from 82.2 to 202 C corresponds to the removal of water and acetoni- trile which are included in the crystal lattice (calcd. 7.81 %). The second mass loss occurs from 237 to 502 C was 75.6 % and is assigned to the decomposition of the organic ligands, L1 and chdc (calcd. 75.7 %). A residue of 16.4 % (calcd. 16.5 %) suggests CdO as ﬁnal decomposi- tion product. Complex 2 is thermally stable to 404 C. Then 2 rapidly loses weight from 405 to 577 C, which corresponds to the decomposition of L2 (observed 67.9 %, calcd. 68.3 %). The remaining mass (32.1 %) is consistent with a CdCl2 residue (calcd. 31.7 %). 3.4 XRPD Results The powder XRPD pattern and simulated pattern of 1 and 2 are depicted in Fig. 3a–b. The measured and simulated powder patterns are in good agreement with the X-ray single crystal data, indicating phase purities of the samples. The difference in reﬂection intensities between the exper- imental and simulated patterns is due to the different ori- entation of the crystals in the powdered samples. 10 20 30 40 2 /deg 1 Experimental 1 Simulated Intensity 10 20 30 40 Intensity 2 Simulated 2 Experimental 2 /deg (a) (b) Fig. 3 XRPD patterns of a 1 and b 2 776 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2013) 23:771–778 123 3.5 Photoluminescence Properties Compounds of d10 metals exhibit some interesting photolu- minescent properties [34]. The solid-state luminescence spectra of complexes 1 and 2 (Fig. 4a, b) together with corresponding free ligands were investigated at room tem- perature under the same conditions. The free ligands exhibit strong ﬂuorescence at kmax = 316 nm (L1), 346 nm (L2) upon excitation at 298 nm. The emission bands of the ligands are assigned to p ? p* transition [24–26]. The emission spectra of the title complexes display photoluminescence with emission maxima at 402 nm for 1, and 347 nm for 2 on excitation at 298 nm. Compared to the emission of corre- sponding ligands, a red shift of 86 nm for 1 and 1 nm for 2 are observed. This suggests that the photoluminescence of the complexes originates mainly from the free ligands and are assigned to the p ? p* transition of the coordinated ligands since the Cd2? ion is difﬁcult to oxidize or reduce due to its d10 conﬁguration [35–37]. 4 Conclusion In summary, two new Cd(II) coordination polymers based on ﬂexible bis(5,6-dimethylbenzi-midazol)benzene, {[Cd(L1) (chdc)](CH3CN)(H2O)2}n (1) and [Cd(L2)Cl2]n (2), have been obtained and characterized. Structural analysis showed that 1 displays a 2D (6,3) ﬂat network linked by L1 and chdc ligands, whereas 2 has an inﬁnite loop-like chain connected by L2 ligands and chlorine atoms, then extended to 2D supramolecular structure by strong intermolecular p–p stacking interactions. This work presents that the different anions (or carboxylate anion) and the ﬂexibility of ligands may exert a crucial inﬂuence on the formation of resulting diverse structures and supramolecular architectures. 5 Supplementary Material Crystallographic data for the structural analysis have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre with CCDC No: 897111 and 897112 contain the supple- mentary crystallographic data for 1 and 2, respectively.
