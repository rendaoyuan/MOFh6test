Manuscript COMMUNICATION Imidazole-Containing Ligands Assisted Self Assembly of Two New Cd(II) Coordination Polymers: Syntheses, Crystal Structures and Photoluminescent Properties Nuannuan Ma • Feng Guo Received: 5 March 2013 / Accepted: 21 May 2013 / Published online: 7 June 2013  Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013 Abstract Two new coordination polymers, {[Cd2(PDC)2 (H2O)2(L1)]2H2O}n (1) and {[Cd (2,5-PDC)(H2O)(L2)] H2O}n (2), have been obtained from hydrothermal reac- tions of Cd2? ion with the 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (H2PDC) and two imidazole-containing ligands [L1 = 1, 4-bis(imidazol-1-yl)benzene and L2 = 1,4-bis(1-imidazol- yl)-2,5-dimethylbenzene]. Complex 1 features a three- dimensional 6-connected rob topological net. Complex 2 shows a two-dimensional 6-connected hxl topological net. The structural differences between 1 and 2 demonstrate that the different imidazole-containing ligands play critical roles in the formation of the resulting frameworks. The photolu- minescent properties of 1 and 2 have also been investigated.

Until now, chemists have devoted considerable efforts to the investigation of controllable assemblies of CPs, expecting to achieve complexes with unique structural characteristics and cer- tain functional properties as inorganic–organic hybrid materials. However, the rational design of target crystalline materials is still a great challenge to be realized. Intheself-assemblyprocessofCPs,manyfactorsshouldbe considered, such as the nature of the organic ligands, tem- perature, pH values and solvent used [11–14]. The most effective and facile method of constructing novel CPs is the appropriate choice of the well-designed organic ligands con- taining modiﬁable backbones. Among multitudinous organic ligands, rigid imidazole-containing compounds have proven to be good candidates for the preparation of novel CPs [15–18]. In our previous studies, we used the rigid 1, 4-bis(imidazol-1-yl)benzene and 1,4-bis(1-imidazol-yl)-2, 5-dimethylbenzene to prepare and characterize varied Cd/Zn complexes [19–21]. As part of our systematic study, we car- ried out reactions of 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid with rigid imidazole-containing ligands and Cd2? ion. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two new Cd(II) com- plexes{[Cd2 (PDC)2(H2O)2(L1)]2H2O}n (1) and {[Cd(PDC) (H2O)(L2)]H2O}n (2). Complex 1 has a 3D rob topology. Complex 2 shows a 2D hxl topology. In addition, the photo- luminescent properties of 1 and 2 were investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 General Materials and Methods All reagents and solvents were commercially available [Jinan Camolai Trading Co., China] and were used as received.

Empirical absorption correction was applied using SADABS programs [23]. All structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 using the SHEXL 97 [24]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. The H-atoms were located by geometrically calculations; and, their positions and thermal parameters were ﬁxed during the structure reﬁnement. The crystallo- graphic data and experimental details of structural analyses for the coordination polymers are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond and angle parameters are listed in Table 2. 3 Results and Discussion The assembly of the Cd2?, PDC anion and L1 linear ligand results in a 3D rob topology of 1. In the asymmetric unit of Fig. 2 Two-dimensional layer constructed by the carboxylate ligands in 1 Fig. 3 Schematic view of a 6-connected uninodal rob net. The six- membered rings within the self-catenated network are emphasized in green and blue (Color ﬁgure online) Fig. 1 Coordination environment of Cd(II) atom in 1 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2013) 23:1177–1182 1179 123 1, there are one crystallographically independent CdII atom, one PDC ligand, half of a L1 ligand, one coordinated water and one lattice water. The Cd(II) atom is hexacoor- dinate by three O-atoms from the PDC dinanions [Cd(1)– O(1) = 2.270 (3) Cd(1)–O(2) = 2.366 (3) and Cd(1)– O(3) = 2.346 (3) A˚ ], one N-atoms from one L1 ligand [Cd(1)–N(2) = 2.277 (4) A˚ ], one N-atom from the pyridyl ring [Cd(1)–N(1) = 2.325 (4) A˚ ] and one O-atom of a terminal water ligand [Cd(1)–O(1W) = 2.339 (4) A˚ ] (Fig. 1). Each PDC ligand acts as l3-linker and bridges three CdII atoms in which two carboxylate groups adopt bis-mondentate and monodentate coordination modes, respectively. Two carboxylate groups from two symmetry- related PDC ligands connect two CdII atoms into a dinu- clear CdII sub-unit with a Cd…Cd separation of 4.82 A˚ . The [Cd2(CO2)2] dimers are bonded to four PDC ligands. Thus, the dimers can be viewed as 4-connected nodes to generate a 2D layer (Fig. 2). The L1 ligands as pillars further connect the 2D neutral layers to a 3D framework. From a topological view, the [Cd2(CO2)2] dimeric unit can be treated as 6-connected nodes. If the PDC and L1 ligands are taken as linkers, the 3D structure can be classiﬁed as a rob net with the vertex symbol of (48.66.8) (Fig. 3). One key feature of this topology is the crosslinking of the 2D (4, 4) nets by parallel rods. The 2D sheets of [Cd2(CO2)2] dimers are bridged by l3-PDC and L1 pillars, which are criss-crossed to a bridge at two different angles relative to the sheets. Another interesting feature of this topology is the presence of self-catenation. As highlighted in Fig. 3, two of the smallest six-membered circuits that serve to join together the (4, 4) nets form a catenane-like interlocking structure [25, 26]. 3.1 {[Cd (PDC)(H2O)(L2)]H2O}n (2) When L1 ligand was replaced by L2 under the similar synthetic condition, a 2D layer structure of 2 was formed. The fundamental building unit of 2 is composed of a Cd center, one PDC ligand, one L2 ligand, one coordinated water and one lattice water (Fig. 4). Each Cd(II) ion is seven-coordinated with one O-atom from one water mol- ecule, three O-atoms from PDC ligands, two nitrogen donors from L2 ligands and one N-atom from the pyridyl ring in a pentagonal bipyramidal environment. The Cd–O/ N lengths are in the range of 2.252(2)–2.577(2) A˚ , which are normal distances for Cd-containing complexes [27, 28]. The PDC ligands connect Cd(II) atoms to form a 1D polymeric chain in which the dinuclear Cd units are formed by virtue of l2-bridging O1 atoms with the Cd…Cd sep- aration of 4.11 A˚ . These 1D chains are further linked by the L2 ligand via Cd–N coordinate bonds, which lead to the formation of a 2D framework (Fig. 5). Topological anal- ysis reveals that this framework represents a uninodal 6-connected net of hxl topology-type based on the dinu- clear Cd(II) unit as the node; and, the Schla¨ﬂi symbol for this net is (36.46.53) (Fig. 6). The as-synthesized samples of 1 and 2 were character- ized by the X-ray powder diffraction (Fig. S1). The Fig. 4 Coordination environment of Cd(II) atom in 2 Fig. 5 2D network drawing for 2 Fig. 6 Hxl topological net for complex 2 1180 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2013) 23:1177–1182 123 experimental XRPD patterns correspond well with the results simulated from the single crystal data to indicate the pure phase of 1 and 2. The luminescent emission spectra of 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 7. Intense photoluminescence emissions for 1 and 2 are observed at 457 nm (kex = 358 nm) and 412 nm (kex = 336 nm), respectively. These emissions are neither metal-to-ligand charge nor ligand-to-metal charge transfer since Cd2? ions are difﬁcult to oxidize or to reduce due to their d10 conﬁguration. Thus, an intra-ligand (p–p*) ﬂuo- rescent emission has been assigned because similar emis- sions are observed at 456 nm for free L1 and 421 nm for L2. The enhancement of the emissions for 1 and 2 com- pared with those of the free ligands may be ascribed to an increase in the ligand conformational rigidity since their coordination to Cd(II) ions results in a decrease in the non- radiative decay of the intra-ligand excited states [29, 30]. The emission band of the carboxylate ligand that originates from the p*-n transition are weak. It is proposed that the carboxylate ligand makes a signiﬁcant contribution to the luminescent emission peaks of 1 and 2 in the presence of the N-donor ligands. 4 Conclusions Twonew Cd(II) coordinationpolymers are reported.Different imidazole-containing ligands were used to construct two dif- ferent topological nets, which indicate that the organic ligands are an important factor inﬂuencing the structure of the poly- mer. Complex 1 exhibits a 3D self-cantenate rob net and complex 2 features a 2D hxl framework. Furthermore, the luminescent properties of 1 and 2 were investigated and indicated that these materials may be good candidates as hybrid inorganic–organic photoactive materials. 5 Supplementary Material Crystallographic data for the structural analysis have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, CCDC reference numbers: 927373 and 927374.
