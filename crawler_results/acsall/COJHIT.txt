Manuscript Broadly Hysteretic H2 Adsorption in the Microporous Metal-Organic Framework Co(1,4-benzenedipyrazolate) Hye Jin Choi, Mircea Dinca˘, and Jeffrey R. Long* Department of Chemistry, UniVersity of California, Berkeley, California 94720 Received April 2, 2008; E-mail: jrlong@berkeley.edu Metal-organic frameworks exhibiting high internal surface areas are currently under intense investigation for the storage of hydrogen and other gases.1 Among these, ﬂexible metal-organic frameworks have attracted considerable attention owing to their unusual stepwise and sometimes hysteretic guest adsorption behavior.2 Although rarely observed in microporous solids, hysteretic H2 adsorption is of great interest because it could provide a kinetics-based trapping mechanism for storing hydrogen at modest pressures.1d,3 To date, however, such behavior has been observed only over narrow pressure ranges, and mainly for materials with a relatively low H2 storage capacity. Recognizing the promise of certain tetrazolate-bridged frameworks for high-capacity H2 adsorption,1f,g we recently turned our attention to generating related frameworks of greater stability through use of pyrazolate-based bridging ligands. Herein, we show that 1,4-ben- zenedi(4′-pyrazolyl) (H2BDP) reacts with a Co2+ salt to form a ﬂexible metal-organic framework exhibiting high surface area, unprecedented multiple-step N2 adsorption, and signiﬁcant H2 uptake with wide hysteresis. In addition, a pore-opening/pore-closing mechanism is proposed to explain the hysteretic H2 adsorption, and the thermody- namics and kinetics of this process are probed. Reaction of Co(CF3SO3)2 with H2BDP in N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) at 130 °C afforded purple needle-shaped crystals of Co(BDP)·2DEF·H2O (1). X-ray analysis of a single crystal revealed a tetragonal structure, featuring one-dimensional chains of Co2+ ions, each tetrahedrally coordinated by N atoms from four independent BDP2- ligands (see Figure 1). Pairs of Co2+ ions along the chains are bridged by two pyrazolate rings, forming a motif that has been observed previously in molecules such as [Co(dmpz)(Hdmpz)2]2 (Hdmpz ) 3,5-dimethylpyrazole).4 The structure of 1 displays 10 × 10 Å2 square channels running along the c axis of the crystal, which are interconnected through much narrower slit-like openings. The estimated5 solvent-accessible volume of 0.91 cm3/g within the channels is occupied by DEF and water molecules. Compound 1 is readily desolvated to form Co(BDP) (1d). A thermogravimetric analysis of 1 indicated a weight loss of 42% upon heating to 135 °C, corresponding to the release of two DEF molecules and one H2O molecule per formula unit, and no further weight loss up to 420 °C. This result suggests that the high basicity of pyrazolate relative to tetrazolate imparts increased strength to the metal-nitrogen bonds, which in turn confers higher thermal stability to the framework.1f,6 Upon fully desolvating the material by heating at 170 °C under dynamic vacuum for two days, the X-ray powder diffraction pattern indicated a complete and substantial change of structure. Although the structure of 1d could not be determined owing to the poor quality of the diffraction data, subsequent exposure to DEF regenerated the structure of 1. These observations are at least consistent with an accordion-type ﬂexing behavior that closes and opens the channel pores, as previously demonstrated for analogous 1,4-benzenedicar- boxylate-bridged frameworks.2c To probe the porosity of 1d, N2 gas sorption isotherms were measured at 77 and 87 K (see Figure 2). Remarkably, at 77 K, ﬁve distinct adsorption steps are apparent in the low pressure region of P/P0 < 0.05. At 87 K, the ﬁve steps are shifted to higher pressures and are somewhat less distinct, but occur at approximately the same quantities of N2 adsorbed. Additionally, the desorption of N2 revealed hysteresis at both temperatures, but was completely reversible at reduced pressure, suggesting that gas sorption involves a pressure- dependent pore-opening/pore-closing process. Note that these sorption isotherms do not conform to any of the IUPAC isotherm types.7 To our knowledge, an isotherm with as many as ﬁve well-resolved steps has never previously been observed for adsorption of a nonpolar gas in any type of microporous material, and the previous record within a metal-organic framework is just two steps, as observed for many ﬂexible framework structures.2 Such stepwise behavior has generally been attributed to multilayer adsorption on energetically homogeneous Figure 1.

SOC. 2008, 130, 7848–7850 surfaces, multiple adsorbent-adsorbate interactions that substantially differ in energy,8 or various structural phase transitions occurring under different adsorbate pressures.2b,c For 1d, it is likely that the last of these mechanisms is operational, possibly in conjunction with either or both of the other effects. A Langmuir ﬁt to the N2 adsorption data for 1d gave a surface area of 2670 m2/g, the highest value yet reported for a ﬂexible metal-organic framework. The corresponding pore volume of 0.93 cm3/g is in good agreement with the solvent accessible volume estimated from the crystal structure of 1. Compound 1d adsorbs almost no H2 at 77 K and pressures of up to 1.2 bar. This suggests that the pore-opening mechanism is not only temperature- and pressure-dependent, but also gas-dependent, such that the enthalpy and/or entropy changes associated with the adsorption of a given gas play signiﬁcant roles in the pore opening process. Indeed, as shown in Figure 3, when the pressure is increased, after a low initial plateau, the H2 uptake abruptly rises at ca. 20 bar and quickly reaches an excess capacity of 3.1 wt % at 30 bar. Importantly, desorption of H2 only begins at ca.15 bar, resulting in a hysteresis loop with a width of 13 bar. Such a broad, well-deﬁned H2 sorption hysteresis loop has never previously been reported for a metal-organic framework, and the behavior is reminiscent of metal alloys wherein metal hydride formation leads to large differences in the adsorption and desorption pressures.9 Similar hysteresis loops have, however, been observed with the adsorption of CO2, O2, H2O, MeOH, or EtOH in other ﬂexible metal-organic frameworks,2 wherein phase transitions are typically attributed to signiﬁcant adsorbent-adsorbate or adsorbate-adsorbate interactions via hydrogen-bonding or dipole-dipole contacts. However, since H2 is nonpolar, such interactions are unlikely to contribute to the observed hysteresis. Instead, the hysteretic behavior in 1d must be governed by phase transitions with considerably smaller energy barriers, comparable in magnitude to the H2 adsorption enthalpy. Intriguingly, hysteretic adsorption could potentially lead to an effective means of H2 storage, since a large hysteresis loop allows the gas to be stored at lower, safer pressures, while a high charging pressure contributes to an increase in the amount of usable H2. To probe the inﬂuence of temperature on the gating pressure and hysteresis width, H2 sorption isotherms were measured for 1d between 50 and 87 K (see Figure 3). Hysteresis is apparent at all temperatures, with the width of the loop increasing from 1.1 to 3.8, 13, and 27 bar upon going from 50 to 65, 77, and 87 K, respectively. In addition, the adsorption branch of each loop shifts toward higher pressure with increasing temperature. Such behavior has been observed previously with other gases, as for example with the adsorption of CH4 in Cu(4,4′- bipyridine)2(BF4)2,10 and has been explained as relating to the rate at which the gas molecules strike the solid surface under supercritical conditions. This rate is proportional to PT-1/2, thus causing both adsorption and desorption curves to shift to higher pressure with increasing temperature.11 Compound 1d also exhibits a temperature dependence of the excess H2 uptake capacity. While the solid adsorbs an excess of 5.5 wt % H2 at 10 bar and 50 K, the maximum uptake decreases to 3.6 and 3.1 wt. % at 65 and 77 K, respectively. This effect is a result of an equilibrium shift between the concentrations of the adsorbed species and the gas phase molecules: a lower thermal energy reduces the evaporation rate and shifts the equilibrium toward the adsorbed species. Although rarely reported, measurements of H2 uptake below 77 K can provide important information because they allow estimation of the saturation gas storage capacity of a given material.1j With a capacity of at least 5.5 wt %, the H2 loading within 1d is still signiﬁcantly below the highest storage capacities reported for metal-organic frameworks.1e,i,j Note that the result at 50 K suggests that at 77 or 87 K, additional hysteretic adsorption steps may become apparent at still higher H2 pressures (as observed for N2 adsorption). Given that the hysteresis loops in the H2 isotherms for 1d are likely the result of structural phase transitions stimulated by gas adsorption, the thermodynamics of the two concomitant processes cannot be deconvoluted using routine experiments. However, the temperature dependence of the hysteresis width can be used to estimate the overall thermodynamics of the system. Thus, by assuming that 1d encapsulates H2 to form a clathrate complex, 1d:H2, and by estimating the formation enthalpy of the clathrate, ∆Hf, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, d(lnP) ⁄ d(1/T) ) ∆Hf ⁄ zR (1) where z is the compression factor, and R is the real gas constant; the pore-opening pressure can be approximated as the vapor pressure of the clathrate complex.12 The derivative functions of the adsorption and desorption branches of each hysteresis loop were calculated, and the maxima were taken as the respective pore-opening and pore-closing pressures. As shown in Figure 4, plots of ln P versus 1/T are linear for both adsorption and desorption data. The slopes of the linear ﬁts, which are equated to ∆Hf/R, give values of 3.2 and 2.6 kJ/mol for the formation and dissociation enthalpies of 1d:H2, respectively. This suggests that part of the heat of H2 adsorption, typically 5 to 11 kJ/ mol for metal-organic frameworks,1h is consumed during the gate- opening process. Consequently, the formation enthalpy of 3.2 kJ/mol, can be used to estimate that the enthalpy of the pore-opening process for 1d ought to lie in the range 2-8 kJ/mol. Notably, extrapolation of the two lines in Figure 4 reveals an intersection point at T ) 39 K, where the H2 adsorption isotherm is expected to show complete reversibility with no hysteresis. Although less reliable, extrapolation in the opposite direction suggests that adsorption of H2 at 298 K should exhibit a very large hysteresis, with adsorption/pore-opening and desorption/pore-closing occurring at 1100 and 220 bar, respectively.

SOC. 9 VOL. 130, NO. 25, 2008 7849 COMMUNI CATI ONS To investigate the mechanism of the gated adsorption of H2 within 1d, kinetics proﬁles were measured over a narrow temperature range where the compound was expected to display comparable uptake capacities (77-87 K). In these experiments, samples were exposed to a pressure of H2 in the range of 67-77 bar, and the amount of H2 adsorbed was monitored as a function of time. As shown in Figure 5, the kinetics proﬁles at 77, 79, 82, and 87 K exhibit exponential behavior and could be ﬁt using a double-exponential expression employed pre- viously to model gas sorption kinetics in metal-organic frameworks:13 Nt ⁄ Ne ) A1(1 - e-k1t) + A2(1 - e-k2t) (2) where Nt and Ne represent the adsorbed amount of H2 at time t and at equilibrium, respectively, k1 and k2 are the rate constants, and A1 and A2 are the relative contributions of two distinct barriers controlling the overall adsorption, with A1 + A2 ) 1. This model assumes the existence of two barriers associated with (i) diffusion at the pore entrance, which is also inﬂuenced by the pore-opening process, and (ii) diffusion along the pore cavities. Fitting each kinetics proﬁle using the foregoing model, while allowing a free reﬁnement of A1 and A2, gave rise to a sequence of values for the two rate constants, one of which was larger for all temperatures (see Table S7 in the Supporting Information). The consistently larger value was assigned to k2, corresponding to the diffusion of H2 within the pore cavities, which is indeed expected to be very fast. The smaller value, k1, is associated with the rate- determining step of the adsorption proﬁle, which is thus the overall process associated with the opening of the pores. As mentioned before, this process is likely composed of multiple steps, including a structural phase transition, the pore opening, and gas diffusion through the pore entrance; k1 is therefore best expressed as kobs(1), representing a combination of steps. Indeed, attempts to obtain a linear ﬁt from an Arrhenius plot employing k1 values were unsuccessful, conﬁrming a complex mechanism that requires a more advanced kinetic model. Notably, a linear ﬁt to an Arrhenius plot of ln(k2) versus 1/T enabled estimation of a barrier of 0.62 kJ/mol for the diffusion of H2 along the pore cavities of 1d (see Figure 5, inset). The result is in reasonable agreement with values obtained for the diffusion of H2 within zeolites, where activation barriers of 1-3 kJ/mol were determined by Monte Carlo molecular dynamics simulations and conﬁrmed using quasi- elastic neutron scattering.14 To our knowledge, this represents the ﬁrst assessment of an H2 diffusion barrier within a metal-organic framework. The foregoing results demonstrate the utility of BDP2- in generating a ﬂexible metal-organic framework with good thermal stability and a high internal surface area. Most importantly, the compound exhibits high-capacity H2 adsorption with temperature-dependent hysteresis, enabling assessment of the thermodynamics and kinetics of pore opening/closing processes, and suggesting the potential utility of such compounds for hydrogen storage via a kinetics-based trapping mech- anism. Future efforts will focus on assessing the H2 adsorption properties at higher temperatures and pressures and on enhancing the uptake capacity and H2 binding afﬁnity within such materials.

Single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained from a smaller-scale reaction employing a borosilicate tube (0.7 cm o.d. × 8 cm length) charged with Co(CF3SO3)2 (30 mg, 0.084 mmol), H2BDP (15 mg, 0.071 mmol), and DEF (0.4 mL). After degassing and sealing, the tube was heated in a programmable furnace: the temperature was increased at a rate of 0.1 °C/min to 130 °C, which was maintained for 4 days prior to cooling at a rate of 0.1 oC/min to room temperature. Low-Pressure Gas Adsorption Measurements. Gas adsorption isotherms for pressures in the range 0-1.2 bar were measured by a volumetric method using a Micromeritics ASAP2020 instrument. Crystals of Co(BDP)⋅2DEF⋅H2O were transferred to a preweighed analysis tube, which was capped with a Transeal and evacuated by heating at 170 °C under dynamic vacuum until an outgas rate of less than 2 mTorr/min (0.27 Pa/min) was achieved (ca. two days). The evacuated analysis tube containing the degassed sample of Co(BDP) was then carefully transferred to an electronic balance and weighed again to determine the mass of sample (62.8 mg). The tube was then transferred back to the analysis port of the gas adsorption instrument. The outgas rate was again confirmed to be less than 2 mTorr/min (0.27 Pa/min). For all isotherms, warm and cold free space correction measurements were performed using ultra-high- purity He gas (UHP grade 5.0, 99.999% purity); N2, O2, and H2 isotherms at 77 and 87 K were measured in liquid nitrogen and liquid argon baths, respectively, using UHP-grade gas sources. Oil-free vacuum pumps and oil-free pressure regulators were used for all measurements to S-4 prevent contamination of the samples during the evacuation process or of the feed gases during the isotherm measurements. High-Pressure H2 Adsorption Measurements and Data Analysis. Crystals Co(BDP)⋅2DEF⋅H2O were degassed by the method described in the previous section. The sample was then loaded into the sample holder under a nitrogen atmosphere. Excess adsorption of H2 was measured using an automated Sieverts’ apparatus (PCT-Pro 2000 from Hy-Energy LLC) over a pressure range of 0-90 bar. At least 200 mg of adsorbent was used in each experiment, and UHP-grade hydrogen and helium (99.999% purity) were used for all measurements. Measurements at 77 and 87 K were performed by submerging the sample in liquid nitrogen or liquid argon, respectively, while measurements at 50 and 65 K were performed by using the CryoPro workstation with a PID temperature controller (from Cryo-Con) attached to the sorption analyzer. Liquid helium was used as the cryogen in the cryostat. The volume of the sample holder and the connecting gas manifold were determined prior to sample measurement using He at 298 K, and at all of the temperatures used for the measurements (50, 65, 77, 82, and 87 K). Helium was used to determine the dead space volume correction for a non-porous sample of known volume; this correction accounted for the change in effective sample volume observed when cooling the sample holder from room temperature to low temperature. The adsorbent was then introduced into the sample holder and He gas was used to determine the volume of the sample at room temperature. Since He gas penetrates the pores of the sample without being adsorbed onto the surface, the volume measured with He corresponds to the volume of the framework walls, also referred to as the framework skeleton. Consequently, the skeletal density of the material, dsk, can be obtained from the following expression. dsk = m/Vsk (1) Here, m is the sample mass expressed in g and Vsk is the sample volume in cm3, as determined using He expansion at room temperature. In order to obtain an accurate assessment of the value of the skeletal density, the volume of the sample, Vsk, was measured 20 times and the average of these was used as the final value. High-Pressure H2 Adsorption Kinetics Measurements and Data Analysis. A degassed sample of Co(BDP) was prepared as described above, loaded into the sample holder under nitrogen atmosphere, and installed in the high-pressure PCT-Pro 2000 instrument. The desired S-5 temperatures (77, 79, 82, and 87 K) were achieved by the method described above employing the CryoPro workstation with PID temperature controller. For a typical measurement, high pressure H2 (67-77 bar) was quickly loaded into the sample chamber, within a second for each temperature measured, and the time-dependent increase of the adsorbed H2 amount was monitored until equilibrium was reached. Each kinetics curve was normalized and fit to the double exponential model Nt/Ne = A1(1 – e–k 1t) + A2(1 – e–k 2t) (2) where Nt and Ne represent the amount of H2 adsorbed at time t and at equilibrium, respectively, k1 and k2 are the kinetic rate constants corresponding to the diffusion at the pore entrance and along the pore cavities, respectively, and A1 and A2 are the relative contributions of the two barriers controlling the overall adsorption, with A1 + A 2 = 1. Due to substantial changes in framework structure during the measurements, the parameters A1 and A2 were not fixed and were treated as variables. In particular, A1 would be significantly more affected by the opening of the pore- entrance during the adsorption process. The resultant fit parameters of k1, k2, A1, and A2 with standard errors are listed in Table S7. X-ray Structure Determination. A single crystal of Co(BDP)⋅2DEF⋅H2O was coated in Paratone-N oil, attached to a Kapton loop, quickly transferred to a Bruker Platinum 200 Instrument at the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and cooled in a stream of nitrogen. Preliminary cell data were collected to give a unit cell consistent with the tetragonal Laue group, and the unit cell parameters were later refined against all data. A full hemisphere of data was collected, and the crystal didn’t show significant decay during data collection. Data were integrated and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects using SAINT 7.07b and were corrected for absorption effects using SADABS 2.10. Crystal and refinement parameters are listed in Table S1. Space group assignments were based upon systematic absences, E statistics, and successful refinement of the structures. The structure was solved by direct methods and expanded through successive difference Fourier maps. It was refined against all data using the SHELXTL 5.0 software package. The refined Flack parameter suggested twinning, and a twin component was therefore included with the twinning law of 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 - 1 -4. The twin components, including a racemic mixture, refined to a ratio of 0.207:0.277:0.296:0.220, and their implementation lowered R1 from 0.18 to 0.08. Thermal S-6 parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms pertaining to the framework skeleton were refined anisotropically. Thermal parameters for partially-occupied sites associated with disordered C, N, and O atoms pertaining to solvent molecules were refined isotropically. Hydrogen atoms associated with disordered atoms were not included in the structural refinements. All other hydrogen atoms were assigned to ideal positions and refined using a riding model with an isotropic thermal parameter 1.2 times that of the attached atom (1.5 times for methyl hydrogens). Disorder in bond distances and angles of phenyl ring and pyrazole ring of the ligand molecule were restrained by FLAT and DFIX commands. Due to disorder, the C-N, C-C, and C=O distances in two DEF molecules in the structure were constrained to idealized lengths of 1.47, 1.54 and 1.25 Å, respectively. Other Physical Measurements. Infrared spectra were collected on a Nicolet Avatar 360 FTIR spectrometer equipped with an attenuated total reflectance accessory (ATR). Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen analyses were obtained from the Microanalytical Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley. Powder X-ray diffraction data was collected using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out at a ramp rate of 1 °C/min in a nitrogen flow with a TA Instruments TGA Q5000 V3.1 Build 246. Acknowledgment.
