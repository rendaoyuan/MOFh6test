The networks possess well-defined topologies of body- centered-cubic, rutile, and interpenetrated NbO structures, respectively. Among those, [Cu(pmc)2] possesses a permanent porosity resulting from straight one-dimensional channels of 5.5 A˚ free passages. Unexpectedly, this porous MOF displays a highly selective sorption behavior for CO2, and the sorptions of N2, Ar, O2, H2, and CH4 at two different temperatures are found to be negligible. The results of diffraction and spectroscopic analyses exclude framework dynamics or incomplete evacuation as the origin of the gas-sorption selectivity. Introduction Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have established the status as a new class of porous materials with potential applications in separation, storage, catalysis, and others.1 Despite the pessimistic predictions of early days,2 the facile synthesis, high surface area and porosity, and tunable struc- tures and properties of the novel crystalline materials have attracted researchers to this area. Especially, the tunable nature of MOFs is a great advantage over existing porous materials such as zeolites and has actively been exploited in the form of reticular synthesis3 or postsynthetic modifications.4 Recently, a series of MOFs based on imidazole-related ligands have been reported to possess a chemical stability previously unattainable in most carboxylate-based MOFs.5 These works highlight the possibility of obtaining new MOFs suited to industrial applications6 and give us a notion that a particular metal-ligand pair outperforms others with regard to a certain property of MOFs, such as the resistance to hydrolysis. Therefore, future developments in this area re- quire comprehensive knowledge on diverse metal-ligand interactions in network solids. In this context, we have sys- tematically studied MOFs having two types of ligands (dicarboxylate and diamine),7 and now we have launched a new effort toward porous MOFs that have both amine and carboxylate moieties within the same ligand.8 Especially, we have become interested in pyrimidine-5-carboxylate (pmc) for its versatile binding modes as a di- or tritopic linker. The ligand is barely known in the field of MOF research.9 We report here that pmc is a useful building block that yields new MOFs with well-defined topologies. It is also shown that one of the MOFs not only possesses a perma- nent porosity but also shows a highly selective sorption be- havior for CO2 over common gases, such as N2, O2, Ar, H2, *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

All of the reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data were obtained on a SCINCO S-1000 instrument with a heating rate of 5 C min-1 in air (Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). IR data were recorded on KBr pellets with a Varian FTS 1000 instrument (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). In order to measure the IR spectrum for 3 3 CO2, the KBr pellet of evacuated 3 was heated to 100 C under vacuum and then exposed to CO2 gas (∼2 atm) at room tem- perature. After 1 h, the pellet was subjected to measurements in ambient air. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance system equipped with a Cu-sealed tube (λ = 1.541 78 A˚ ) and a computer-controlled heating stage inside a sealed chamber that can be evacuated. The variable-temperature measurements were performed by heating and holding the sample at a target temperature for at least 30 min. [Cd(pmc)2] (2). Cd(NO3)2 3 4H2O (0.027 g, 0.087 mmol) and Hpmc (0.020 g, 0.16 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (2.6 mL). After stirring for 2 h, the solution was sealed in a glass vial and then heated to 112 C for 43 h. The product crystallized as colorless thin plates when the solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 day (0.022 g, 75.8%). Calcd for [Cd(C5H3N2O2)2] 3 2H2O: C, 30.44; H, 2.55; N, 14.20.

Single crystals of 2 and 3 3 DMF were directly picked up from the mother liquor, attached to a glass fiber, and transferred to a cold stream of liquid nitrogen (-100 C) for data collection. The full hemisphere data were collected on a Siemens SMART CCD diffractometer with Mo KR radiation (λ = 0.71073 A˚ ). After data integration (SAINT)10 and semiempirical adsorptioncorrectionbasedonequivalentreflections(SADABS),11 the structures were solved by direct methods and subsequent differenceFouriertechniques(SHELXTL).12Allofthenon-hydro- gen atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms were added to their calculated positions. The solvent DMF of 33 DMF sits on a special position with rotational disorder over three positions. The summary of the crystal data and structure refine- ments is shown in Table 1. The data for 33 toluene were measured with synchrotron radiation on a 6B MX-I ADSC Quantum-210 detector with a silicon (111) double-crystal monochromator at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Pohang, Kyungbuk, Korea. The ADSC Quantum-210 ADX program (version 1.92)13 was used for data collection, and HKL2000 (version 0.98.699)14 was used for cell refinement, reduction, and absorption correction. The unit cell parameter a of 33 toluene was found to be twice that of 33 DMF probably because of the solvent ordering inside the channels. See the Supporting Information for details. Gas-Sorption Studies. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller gas-sorption isotherms were measured with a Belsorp Mini-II (BEL Japan, Inc.) at one of the following temperatures: liquid nitro- gen (77 K), liquid argon (87 K), or slush baths of dry ice- isopropyl alcohol (195 K) or ice-water (273 K). The gases used were of extra-pure quality (N50 for Ar, CO2, and N2, N60 for H2, and N45 for O2). As-synthesized samples of 3 (∼100 mg) were guest-exchanged with CS2 and, prior to the measurements, evacuated under a dynamic vacuum (10-3 Torr) at room tem- perature for 12 h. A typical weight loss by this pretreatment method is 15-19%. The equilibrium criteria were set consis- tent throughout all of the measurements (changes in adsorp- tion amounts of less than 0.1 cm3 g-1 within 180 s); however, increasing the equilibrium time to 540 s did not affect the results. All of the measurements were repeated at least twice from fresh Scheme 1. Three MOFs Based on pmc and Their Network Topologies Table 1.

Results and Discussion Solvothermal reactions of H(pmc) and nitrates of Co2þ, Cd2þ, and Cu2þ in DMF produce single crystals having com- positions of 1, 2, and 3 3 DMF, which are deduced from the X-ray crystal structure analysis. Elemental analysis and PXRD studies independently confirm the bulk purity of the products. In the PXRD patterns shown in Figure 1, a number of strong diffractions are observed in positions expected from the single-crystal data. The structure of 1 is based on a secondary building unit (SBU) in which two octahedral Co2þ ions are bridged by an aqua ligand and two carboxylate moieties of pmc ligands. Overall, the dinuclear SBU is supported by eight pmc ligands that act as simple ditopic linkers. Therefore,1 is characterized as a uninodal 8-connected net, and the topology underlying the net isfoundto be body-centered-cubic (net symbol bcu).15 The details of the structure and properties have been reported elsewhere.8b The SBU of 2 is a dimetal unit supported by two asym- metric carboxylate bridges (Figure 2a). Each Cd2þ ion is further coordinated by three pmc ligands with one chelating carboxylate and two pyrimidyl nitrogen atoms. The dimetal SBU thus can be simplified as a 6-connecting node. While the nitrogen atoms of the bridging pmc ligands do not participate in the binding of Cd2þ ions, nonbridging pmc ligands fully utilize their donor atoms to coordinate Cd2þ ions, rendering themselves 3-connecting nodes. Therefore, the 3D frame- work of 2 is a binodal 6,3-connected net with vertex figures of distorted octahedral and trigonal-planar geometries (Figure 2b). The most important net of this kind is rutile (TiO2, net symbol rtl), and that is indeed the topology underlying the net of 2 (Figure 2c,d). The framework of 2 is densely packed and crystallizes without the presence of any solvent molecules in the crystal lattice. The structure of 3 is built upon mononuclear Cu2þ co- ordinated by four pmc ligands in a square-planar geometry (Figure 3a). The ligand may be considered as a simple ditopic linker because one of the two nitrogen atoms does not di- rectly bind to a metal ion (see below). This means that 3 is a uninodal 4-connected net based on square-planar nodes, and simplification of the framework reveals that the inorganic prototype NbO (net symbol nbo) is the underlying topology (Figure 3b). As noted by O’Keeffe and co-workers,16 the nbo topology is one of the five regular nets and is the only possible 3D net from square nodes and simple ditopic linkers. The overall packing structure of 3 is a 2-fold interpenetrat- ing nbo net (Figure 3c). The two interpenetrating nets are chemically and crystallographically equivalent. A close ex- amination of the crystal structure shows that the square- planar Cu2þ ion in one net is weakly bonded to “noncoordi- nating” nitrogen atoms of pmc ligands in the interpenetrating net (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The Cu3 3 3 N distance is 3.2 A˚ , and the N 3 3 3 Cu 3 3 3 N vector is tilted about 21.6 against the vertical axis of the square-planar geometry. This interpenetration mode of 3 deserves additional com- ments. First, the interpenetration is not simply a result of mechanical interlocking, but there are significant chemical interactions between Cu2þ in one net and the “idle” nitrogen atoms of another. Therefore, a dynamic motion, such as slippage of the interpenetrating nets upon guest exchange or evacuation, is unlikely. Second, in principle the interpenetra- tion in 3 may be avoided if we could remove the nonbonded N 3 3 3 Cu3 3 3 N interactions. Therefore, we attempted to re- place pmc with nicotinate (pyridine-3-carboxylate) in the same synthesis; however, the synthetic condition has not been found yet. Finally, the 3D pore system of the original nbo net is reduced to one-dimensional (1D) channels as a result of the interpenetration in 3 (Figure 3d). The hexagonal channels run along the c axis of 3, which is the [111] direction of the ideal nbo lattice with cubic symmetry. The hexagonal 1D channels have a relatively uniform cross-sectional area, and an imaginary sphere of 5.5 A˚ diameter would pass through the channels without touching the Connolly surface (1.4 A˚ ) of the framework.17 The helical triangular channels are too small to be occupied. The accessible free voids in 3 are estimated to be about 29% of the total crystal volume. The thermal behavior of framework material 3 is evaluated by TGA and variable-temperature PXRD (vT-PXRD). The result of TGA for as-synthesized 3 shows a weight loss of less than 5% until about 250 C, from which decomposition of Figure 1.

After complete evacuation following guest exchange (see below), the bulk product displays PXRD patterns that corroborate well with the simulation based on the single-crystal data. Also, the measurements of vT-PXRD show characteristic reflections even at 200 C without a Figure 2.

Article Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 49, No. 23, 2010 10837 pronounced shift of the Bragg angles (Figure 4). This com- pelling evidence establishes the stability and rigidity of the evacuated framework of 3. We also determined the crystal structure of 3 after heating of the as-synthesized crystals to 150 C under vacuum for 12 h. The atomic coordinates and thermal parameters of the framework atoms changed little (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information), and the electron counts for the solvent regions decreased only about 20% (from 257 to 205 electrons per unit cell).18 These results imply that the guest DMF molecules in as-synthesized 3 are practically occluded within the hexago- nal channels (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information) and may not be removed simply by thermal evacuation. The hygroscopic stability of the porous material 3 was examined by soaking the crystals in deionized water. The dark-purple crystals of 3 gradually crack down to light-blue specimens within hours. Some crystals of the hydrolyzed product were large enough to determine the X-ray structure, and they were found to be a simple complex [Cu(pmc)2- (OH2)4],19 where pmc is an N-bonded monodentate ligand (Figure 5). The hydrolysis product, however, regenerates 3 when it was heated to 100 C in DMF. Both the hydrolyzed complex and regenerated 3 are phase-pure according to PXRD analysis. Therefore, 3 may be viewed as a “recyclable” porous material.20 We note that the hydrolysis experiment simulates rather an extreme condition aimed to test the stability of 3 against atmospheric moisture. The straight 1D channels of 3 having the free passage of 5.5 A˚ should be accessible to small guest molecules, and therefore we measured the sorptions of N2, O2, Ar, H2, CO2, and CH4 for samples pretreated by different methods. To our surprise, however, no gas was found to adsorb in a significant amount when the as-synthesized or guest-exchanged materi- als (CH3CN or CH3OH) were evacuated at 100-150 C. Suspecting an incomplete exchange of the synthesis solvent, we then used CS2 as the solvent to exchange the occluded DMF molecules in 3.21 As evidenced by IR spectroscopy (Figure 6), the characteristic ν(CdO) band of DMF (1686 cm-1) in as-synthesized 3 completely disappears, and the strong asymmetric stretching band of CS2 appears at 1518 cm-1 for CS2-exchanged samples. Again, the latter peak disappears when the CS2-exchanged sample of 3 is put under vacuum at room temperature, implying that a complete and thorough evacuation of 3 can be achieved. A bulk sample activated by this method shows PXRD patterns that perfectly match the simulation and those of fresh samples (Figure 4). Therefore, evacuation of 3 does not cause movement of the interpenetrating nets or collapse of the open framework. The inability of CH3CN or CH3OH to exchange the included DMF molecules, which is contrasted to CS2, is not the result of size exclusion. We present, as evidence, the X-ray crystal structure of 3 3 toluene that was obtained after soaking of single crystals of 3 3 DMF in toluene (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). In the structure, the toluene molecules are ordered, forming extensive π-π and CH-π interactions inside the channels surrounded by aromatic pyrimidyl rings. Therefore, enhanced noncovalent interac- tions seem to be the major driving force for the guest- exchange processes. Having established the optimal activation condition, we measured the sorption isotherms again for various gases after evacuation of the CS2-exchanged samples of 3. As shown in Figure 7, a significant amount of CO2 is adsorbed at 195 and 273 K. Adsorption of CO2 at 195 K shows a type I behavior typical for microporous materials but is marked by a pro- nounced hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption, which suggests the presence of kinetically hindered pores. The total pore volume estimated from the saturated sorption of CO2 is 0.13 cm3 g-1, meaning a porosity of 19% based on the crystallographic density. This value is significantly lower than the expected value of 28-29%. In the mean time, adsorptions of N2, O2, Ar, H2, and CH4 at two different temperatures are very low. In fact, adsorp- tions for these gases are almost negligible (<5 cm3 g-1) except for Ar at 195 K and CH4 at 273 K. A potential instrumental failure or measurement error is safely ruled out because the results have been successfully reproduced inmore than two independent measurements using freshly prepared samples. In general, a selective adsorption occurs when the pore size approaches the critical dimensions22 or kinetic diameters23 of Figure 4. PXRD patterns of 3 measured after complete evacuation and upon heating from room temperature under vacuum. (18) Spek, A. L.

For MOFs with pores that are seemingly large enough for the free passage of small gases, this situation may be encountered when the framework is dynamic with respect to guest-exchange or removal processes. The distor- tion of organic/inorganic building blocks, movements of in- terpenetrating nets, or conformational changes of organic ligands are common causes for the dynamic properties of MOFs.24 An incomplete evacuation of included solvents in the framework may also have the same effectof reducingpore sizes.25 Interestingly, the porous MOF 3 fits none of the above profiles.26 That is, the open channels (5.5 A˚ ) are sufficiently large compared to gas molecules used in this study, which are smaller than 4 A˚ , the framework is rigid and robust with respect to evacuation, the interpenetrating nets are un- likely to show dynamic motion, and the guest molecules are thoroughly exchanged and completely removed. The results of TGA, vT-PXRD, and single-crystal X-ray and IR spec- troscopy collectively support this analysis. The onlyplausible explanation for the observed gas-sorption data should be based on the kinetic aspects of the sorption measurements. The diameter of the uniform 1D channels in 3 (5.5 A˚ ) is much smaller than the bilayer thickness of most gas molecules (e.g., 7.3 A˚ for N2), and therefore diffusion of ad- sorptive molecules and adsorption equilibrium will be very Figure 5.

(26) Similar cases have been reported, albeit without exhaustive evidence to rule out the dynamic nature of frameworks. See: (a) Yoon, J. W.; Jhung, S. H.; Hwang, Y. K.; Humphrey, S. M.; Wood, P.

Article Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 49, No. 23, 2010 10839 slow inside the 1D channels because of overlapping potentials from opposite walls. When the diffusion is too slow within a reasonable time frame (see the Experimental Section), the gas sorption at cryogenic temperatures may not be observed. This is especially true for 1D channels with uniform dimensions because a few strongly adsorbed molecules at the pore entrance may block further adsorption. At 195 K, the diffusion and equilibrium is accelerated. At the same time, however, N2, O2, Ar, and H2 molecules carry too much thermal energy to physically adsorb on the pore surface at 195 K. In the case of CO2, adsorption is favored because of strong adsorptive- adsorptive and adsorptive-adsorbent interactions originat- ing from the permanent and high quadrupole moment of CO2.27 The relatively small kinetic diameter of the molecule (3.3 A˚ ) may also have contributed to the accelerated diffusion, butevendiffusionofCO2insidetheporesappearstoexperience some restrictions, judging from the presence of hysteresis in the sorption isotherms. In view of practical applications, the highly selective sorption behavior of porous phase 3 may be used to develop packing materials or membranes28 for capturing or filtering off CO2 from the atmosphere.29 The fully evacuated sample of 3, in the form of a KBr pellet, can uptake and hold CO2 at room temperature as shown by the ν(CO2) band (2338 cm-1) in the IR spectrum that was measured after exposure of the KBr pellet of 3 to a CO2 atmosphere (Figure 6). In conclusion, we showed that pmc acts as a simple ditopic or planar tritopic linker to produce 3D MOFs with well- defined topologies. Cu(pmc)2 has a charge-neutral open frame- work based on interpenetrating nbo nets, and the void framework is stable and rigid. The 3D net is hydrolyzed to give a simple complex in water, but the process can be reversed simply by heating in DMF. The recyclable porous material with straight channels discriminates N2, O2, Ar, H2, and CH4 but not CO2 in the gas-sorption experiments. We believe that the slow kinetics for diffusion and adsorption equilibrium within the narrow 1D channels is responsible for the observed selectivity. Acknowledgment.

The results of SQUEEZE process were attached to the cif file. For 3·Toluene, the asymmetric unit is four times that of 3·DMF (or 3), and therefore the unit cell contains 12 solvent channels (3 in 3·DMF). Toluene molecules are found ordered only in two-thirds of all the solvent channels, and the remaining channels show highly disordered electron densities nearby the framework atoms. The diffused electron densities in one-third of the solvent channels could not be modeled or removed by the SQUEEZE process, and therefore left without further treatment. This results in the poor GOF and R-factors as shown in Table S1; however, the disorder is strictly localized to the solvent regions and the framework is not affected at all. We also note that the solvent exchange with toluene causes the as-synthesized crystals crack down to smaller pieces, and thus a highly intense X-ray beam from synchrotron sources was necessary for the successful structure determination. The crystallographic asymmetric units of 3·DMF, 3 and 3·Toluene are shown in Fig S6. S3 Table S1.
