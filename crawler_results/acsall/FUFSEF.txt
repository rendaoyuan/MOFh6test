R. China ReceiVed December 4, 2008; ReVised Manuscript ReceiVed May 23, 2009 ABSTRACT: Six new metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), namely, {[Fe(HPIDC)(H2O)]·2H2O}n (1), [Cd(HPIDC)(H2O)]n (2), [Zn(HPIDC)(H2O)]n(3),{[Eu3(HPIDC)4(H2O)8]·NO3·4H2O}n(4),{[Tb3(HPIDC)4(H2O)8]·Cl·4H2O}n(5),and{[Y3(HPIDC)4(H2O)8]·Cl· 4H2O}n (6), were hydrothermally synthesized and characterized (H3PIDC ) 2-(pyridin-4-yl)-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid). Single crystal X-ray diffractions show ligands H3PIDC are doubly deprotonated in all compounds, and the doubly deprotonated HPIDC2- coordinates in the µ3 or µ4 mode to generate 2D or 3D MOFs, displaying four coordination modes. Both 1 and 2 are 3D MOFs, but different in structure topologies. In 1 the ligand HPIDC2- and metal center Fe(II) act as 3-connected nodes to fabricate a (10,3) porous metal-organic net with 1D open channels where 1D zigzag water chains are reside through hydrogen-bonding interactions. This dehydrated porous material can absorb for N2, with a determined BET surface area of 9.07 m2 g-1. In 2, however, ligand HPIDC2- and metal center Cd(II) serve as 4-connected nodes to form a 3D honeycomb framework. Complexes 3-6 all are 2D MOFs built up from T-shaped 3-connected HPIDC2- and 3- or 4-connected metal nodes. With the 3-connected metal nodes Zn(II), a stairway-like MOF with (4.82) topology in 3 is created. As for 4-connected metal nodes Eu(III), Tb(III) or Y(III), isostructural MOFs with novel (42.6)2(4.62)2(42.63.8)2(42.62.82) nets in 4-6 form. Notably, ligands HPIDC2- in 1, 3 and 4-6 are all T-shaped 3-connectors, but belong to different coordination modes, and the coordination lability also results in structural diversity, even with similar 3-connected nodes such as Fe(II) in 1 and Zn(II) in 3. The luminescent nature for 4 and 5 is the typical narrow emission bands of Eu(III) and Tb(III) ions, respectively. For 2, 3 and 6, the slightly blue-shifted emission bands are mainly due to intraligand emissions. Introduction During the past decades, the design and synthesis of novel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have provoked signiﬁcant interest owing to their enormous variety of intriguing structural topologies as well as great potential applications as microporous, magnetic, nonlinear optical and ﬂuorescent materials.1 Although the design and synthesis of such materials are highly inﬂuenced by many factors, such as the coordination trend of metal centers, the nature of ligands used, metal-ligand ratio, reaction conditions etc., the judi- cious selection for multifunctional organic ligands is still an effective approach to construct MOFs with unique structures and properties.2 It is well-known that aromatic polycarboxy- lates,3 especially the N-heterocyclic carboxylates,4,5 are excellent candidates for preparing novel MOFs, because of their versatile coordination modes and potential hydrogen- bonding donors and acceptors. For example, 4,5-imidazoledi- carboxylic acid (H3IDC), a rigid N-heterocyclic carboxylic acid, has great potential for coordinative interactions and hydrogen bonding, showing more interesting traits in the construction of MOFs. It can be successively deprotonated to generate various species with different proton numbers (H2IDC-, HIDC2-, and IDC2-), and hence may result in a large diversity of supramolecular architectures. Furthermore, the two nitrogen atoms in the imidazole ring can gear the coordination orientation, sometimes strengthened by the cooperative coordination of the adjacent carboxyl groups, to produce large stable molecular building blocks which can be reticulated into novel topologies. Up to now, some of 4,5- imidazoledicarboxylate complexes that exhibit useful proper- ties, such as porosity, magnetism and catalysis, have been reported.5 In contrast to the well-studied H3IDC, 2-(pyridin-4-yl)- 1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (H3PIDC), a very close analogue of H3IDC, remains still unexplored until now. Similarly, H3PIDC is endowed with the promising building block H3IDC, and the complete migration of the coordination group into H3PIDC is expected to direct resultant assemblies like that in H3IDC complexes.5 Comparatively, the additional pyridyl group in the backbone of H3PIDC will modulate coordination ability to give more potential coordination modes and enlarge the conjugation π-system. Moreover, the pyridyl ring and imidazole ring can rotate around the C-C bond, showing the labile coordination nature of a semirigid ligand. Taking these into consideration, we believe that H3PIDC will be an ideal ligand for constructing novel metal-organic hybrid compounds. In this paper we report the hydrothermal syntheses, structure determinations and properties of six 2-3D coordination polymers of H3PIDC, formulated as {[Fe(HPIDC)(H2O)]·2H2O}n (1), [Cd(HPIDC)(H2O)]n (2), [Zn- (HPIDC)(H2O)]n (3), {[Eu3(HPIDC)4(H2O)8]·NO3·4H2O}n (4), {[Tb3(HPIDC)4(H2O)8]·Cl·4H2O}n (5), {[Y3(PIDC)4(H2O)8]·Cl· 4H2O}n (6). Single crystal X-ray diffractions show ligands H3PIDC in all compounds are doubly deprotonated, and the doubly deprotonated HPIDC2- coordinates in the µ3 or µ4 mode to generate 2D or 3D MOFs. The four coordination modes of HPIDC2- found in these compounds are presented in Scheme 1, which projects the coordination direction of the 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylate group. Notably, ligands HPIDC2- in 1, 3 and 4-6 are all T-shaped 3-connectors, but belong to three different µ3 coordination modes mainly tuned by the coordination of the pyridyl group in the * Corresponding authors.

Crystallographic data for the title compounds were collected at 291(2) K on a Bruker SMART APEX-II CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite crystal and incident beam monochromator using Mo KR radiation (λ ) 0.71073 Å). Absorption corrections were applied by using SADABS. The structures were solved with direct methods and reﬁned with full-matrix least-squares techniques on F2 using the SHELXTL program package.7 The non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically except for a half of the disordering free counterion Cl- in 5 and 6. Due to uncoordinating and ﬁlling in the spacious void between layers, the Cl- atoms in 5 and 6 were disordered at three sites and reﬁned isotropically, while the position of NO3- in 4 was also disordered and reﬁned with the constraint. The hydrogen atoms were treated as idealized contributions except water molecules. The hydrogen atoms of water molecules were assigned with common isotropic displacement factors and included in the ﬁnal reﬁnement by using geometrical restrains. Crystal data are summarized in detail in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Hydrogen bond data of complex 1 is listed in Table 2.

The asymmetric unit comprises one Fe(II) ion, one HPIDC2- anion and three water molecules. As shown in Figure 1, each Fe(II) ion is in a slightly distorted octahedral coordination geometry coordinated by two nitrogen and three oxygen atoms from three individual HPIDC2- ligands, and one oxygen atom from a water molecule. The Fe-N distances range between 2.202 and 2.3622 Å, and the Fe-O bonds range between 2.0544 and 2.1385 Å. These distances are comparable to reported values.8 In each ligand HPIDC2-, the imidazole ring and pyridyl ring are almost coplanar with a dihedral angle of 12.2°. In 1, each HPIDC2- anion adopts a µ3-kN,O:kO,O′:kN′ mode connecting three Fe centers in bis- (bidentate) and one monodentate modes (Scheme 1a). Two carboxyl groups adopt different coordination modes: monoden- tate and bis-monodentate. Each bis-monodentate carboxyl group linked two adjacent Fe(II) atoms in anti-anti mode to form an inﬁnite -Fe-O-C-O-Fe- 1D zigzag chain. These 1D chains Scheme 1. Coordination Modes of HPIDC2- Ligand in Complexes 1-6 3424 Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 9, No. 8, 2009 Li et al. are further bridged by pyridyl nitrogen atom of ligand HPIDC2- in different orientation leading to the three-dimensional frame- work. A better insight into the nature of 1 can be achieved by the application of topological approach, namely, reducing multidimensional structures to simple node-and-linker nets. As discussed above, both ligands and Fe(II) centers act as 3-con- nected nodes, and the resulting structure of 1 is symbolized as a rare (10,3) net (Figure 2). Interestingly, the three-dimensional framework consists of one-dimensional channels along the [100] direction (Figure 3a). After the van der Waals radii of the surface atoms were removed, the free channel is sized ca. 8.5 × 8.5 Å. A calculation by PLATON9 indicates the free volume of channels occupy 17.8% of the crystal volume. The channels are resided by uncoordinated water molecules which connect with each other through hydrogen bonds to form a 1D zigzag water chain (Figure 3b). The O· · ·O distances and the O-H· · ·O angles are in the ranges of 2.688-2.806 Å and 146-157°, respectively (Table 2). Moreover, the 1D water chains are further stabilized in the channels via forming the H-bonds with the carboxyl oxygen and uncoordinated imidazole nitrogen atoms. It should be pointed out that according to charge-balance requirements, the oxidation state of Fe in 1 is tentatively assigned as +2, although the reactant is Fe(NO3)3. As the previous literature reported, the reaction of aromatic N- containing ligands, such as imidazole or pyridine derivatives, Table 1.

Networks with Topological Diversity Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 9, No. 8, 2009 3425 with transition metal salts can result in spontaneous metal ion reduction.10 For example, M. C. Hong et al. reported a type of Fe(II) coordination complex from the reaction of FeCl3 and imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid under the solvothermal condi- tion in 99.5% ethanol.8a Complex 2 is a 3D coordination polymer and crystallized in P21/n. The asymmetrical unit in 2 contains one Cd(II) ions, one HPIDC2- anion, and one water molecule. The Cd(II) ion shows a distorted octahedral geometry coordinated by two nitrogen atoms and three oxygen atoms from three individual HPIDC2- ligands, and one oxygen atom from a water molecule (Figure 4). The Cd-N and Cd-O bond lengths lie in the normal ranges of 2.281(2)-2.2995(19) and 2.2510(17)-2.4760(19) Å, respec- tively. In each ligand HPIDC2-, the two carboxyl groups and the imidazole ring are almost coplanar with mean deviation being 0.0438 Å, while the imidazole ring and pyridyl ring have a dihedral angle of 39.2°. Each HPIDC2- anion adopts a µ4- kN,O:kO:kO′:kN′ mode (Scheme 1b) to bridge four Cd(II) atoms in N,O-chelating, O-bridging, and monodentate fashion, and each Cd(II) node also acts as a 4-connector in the resulting MOF. As illustrated in Figure 5, two crystallographically equivalent Cd(II) atoms are bridged by two HPIDC2- anions with their Nimidazole and Npyridyl to form a dimetal ring with a Cd-Cd separation distance of 7.351 Å, and the dimetal rings acting as secondary building units (SBUs) connect each other with the bridging O1 atoms of carboxyl groups. The resulting one- dimensional chains are further cross-linked via the monodentate carboxyl oxygen atom (O4) in different orientation to form a 3D honeycomb framework (Figure 6). Complex 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, and the coordination environment around Zn(II) is shown in Figure 7. The asymmetric unit comprises one Zn(II) ion, one HPIDC2- anion and one coordinated water molecule. Each Zn(II) atom is coordinated in a distorted octahedral geometry deﬁned by two oxygen atoms (Zn1-O2, 2.1890(14) Å; Zn1-O3B, 2.1607(14) Å) and three nitrogen atoms (Zn1-N1, 2.1740(15) Å; Zn1-N2B, 2.1507(16) Å; Zn1-N3A, 2.1188(16) Å) from three individual HPIDC2- ligands, and one oxygen atom (Zn1-O5, 2.1215(15) Å) from a water molecule.

The dimetal ring SBUs connected one-dimensional chain in 2 (one SBU was marked as yellow for clarity). 3426 Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 9, No. 8, 2009 Li et al. and Zn-O distances are comparable to those in the previously reported dicarboxylate Zn(II) complexes.11 Ligands HPIDC2- in 3 also serve as T-shaped 3-connectors similar to that in 1, but adopt a different µ3-kN,O:kN′,O′:kN′′ coordination mode connecting three Zn(II) atoms in bis-N,O-chelating mode and one monodentate mode (Scheme 1c). The imidazole ring and pyridyl ring with the dihedral angle being 116.9 Å is more distorted than that found in 1. As shown in Figure 8, ligands HPIDC2- in 3 bridge Zn(II) centers through 2-(pyridin-4-yl)-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate groups in bis-N,O-chelating modes to form a one-dimensional chain running along the c-axis, and adjacent HPIDC2- ligands in each chain are perpendicularly orientated. Moreover, the 1D chains are connected to each other by the pyridyl group of HPIDC2- to result in a stairway-like two-dimensional framework (Figure 8). In each stair, there are two types of rectangular grids (grids A and B), which are arranged alternatively. Topologically, the layers of octagonal and rhombic meshes are a 3-connected (4.82) topology (Figure 9). Through hydrogen-bonding interac- tions originating from the coordinated water hydrogen atom and the carboxyl oxygen atom between the adjacent layers (O(5)-H(5B)· · ·O(1) 2.931(2) Å, ∠OHO 154.9°), the 3-con- nected framework is further linked into a 3D network. Single-crystal X-ray analyses of complexes 4, 5 and 6 reveal that they all are two-dimensional coordination frameworks and crystallize in the C2/c space group. Structurally, complexes 4, 5 and 6 are extremely similar except for the differences in the uncoordinated anions for charge balance. Therefore, we only discuss the structure of 4 in detail for terseness. In complex 4, there are one and a half Eu(III) ions, two HPIDC2- anions, four coordinated water molecules, two lattice water molecules and a half NO3- in the asymmetric unit. As shown in Figure 10, both Eu1 and Eu2 adopt slightly distorted square prism geometry. Eu1 is eight-coordinated by six oxygen atoms from four individual HPIDC2- ligands, and two oxygen atoms from two water molecules, while Eu2 is eight-coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four individual HPIDC2- ligands and four oxygen atoms from four water molecules. The Eu-O bond distances range from 2.369(3) to 2.461(3) Å, and the O-Eu-O bond angles range from 69.98(14) to 156.1(2)°, all of which are comparable to those reported for other carboxylate Eu(III) complexes.5a,12 In 4, each HPIDC2- ligand also acting as a T-shaped spacer adopts a µ3-kO:kO′,O′′:kO′′′ mode (Scheme Figure 6. View of the 3D honeycomb framework of 2 along the [100] direction. Figure 7. ORTEP view of coordination environment of Zn(II) atoms in 3 with thermal ellipsoids at the 50% probability level (hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity). Figure 8. Stairway-like two-dimensional framework of 3 with two types of grids A and B. Figure 9. Schematic illustrating the 2D 3-connected (4,82) topological network in 3. Networks with Topological Diversity Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 9, No. 8, 2009 3427 1d) to bridge three Eu(III) atoms just using two carboxyl groups, whereas the three nitrogen atoms are free of coordination. There are two types of HPIDC2- in 4: one only links three Eu1 atoms with the dihedral angles between the two carboxyl groups and the correspondingly linked imidazole ring being 2.7 and 8.8°, respectively, while the other links two Eu2 and one Eu1 atoms with the dihedral angles between the two carboxyl groups and the correspondingly linked imidazole ring being 10.7 and 20.7°, respectively. It is interesting to note that Eu1 centers are only linked by one type of HPIDC2- to form an inﬁnite -Eu1-O- C-O-Eu1- 1D two-strand helical chain, with the shortest Eu· · ·Eu distance bridged by carboxyl groups being 5.545 Å. The other type of HPIDC2- ligand links one Eu1 and two Eu2 atoms to create the 2D network structure lying in the ab plane (Figure 11). The shortest separation distance of Eu1· · ·Eu2 is 6.932 Å. Topologically, two types of HPIDC2- ligands can be viewed as three-connected nodes, and Eu1 and Eu2 atoms can be regarded as four-connected nodes. In this way, the structure of 4 can be rationalized as a (3,4)-connected net. The molar ratio of these four kinds of nodes is 2:2:2:1. Thus, the framework of 4 is symbolized as a very novel (42.6)2(4.62)2(42.63.8)2- (42.62.82) network (Figure 12). Gas Absorption. Complex 1 possesses a BET surface area of 9.07 m2 g-1, and the micropore volume is 0.024 cm3 g-1. The surface area observed for 1 is obviously smaller compara- tively with its percent effective free volume of 17.8% (total potential solvent volume of 320 Å3 out of per unit cell volume of 1799.6 Å3) calculated with PLATON. The nitrogen adsorption behavior of 1 has been examined at 77 K. Based on thermo- gravimetric analyses (vide infra), the crystal sample of 1 was dried under a high vacuum at 160 °C for 10 h to remove the lattice water molecules, and the PXRD patterns of 1 (Figure 13) indicate that the solids after removal of the solvent molecules still retain the initial framework. Then the dehydrated sample of 489.4 mg was placed in the quartz tube to measure nitrogen adsorption. Nitrogen adsorption isotherm was taken using automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (Quantachrome Nova 1001). Approximately 15.32 mL of N2 was adsorbed per 1.0 g of desolvated sample at 1 atm (Figure 14), exhibiting certain adsorption for N2. The adsorption isotherm clearly indicates no occlusion except surface adsorption, thereby the N2 molecules perhaps not diffusing into the micropores. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). To investigate their thermal stabilities, thermogravimetric analyses (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) of 1, 3, 4 and 6 were carried out under air atmosphere with ﬂow rate of 60 mL·min-1 and heating rate of 10 °C·min-1. For 1, the ﬁrst weight loss of 3.8% from 41 to 146 °C is attributed to the release of one lattice water molecule (calcd 5.3%). The second weight loss of 10.3% occurred between Figure 10. ORTEP view of coordination environments of Eu1 and Eu2 in complex 4 with thermal ellipsoid at 50% probability level (hydrogen atoms, uncoordinated water molecules and anions were omitted for clarity).

Schematic illustrating the 2D (3,4)-connected (42.6)2(4.62)2 (42.63.8)2 (42.62.82) topological network in 4. Figure 13. XRPD patterns of (a) calculated patterns of 1; (b) dehydrated 1. 3428 Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 9, No. 8, 2009 Li et al. 146-200 °C, which is attributed to the release of the other lattice water and the coordination water molecules (calcd 10.5%). One of the lattice water molecules is released at this higher temperature stage, which is probably due to the lattice water molecule forming the complicated strong H-bonds in the frameworks. This can be supported by the structural analysis of complex 1 (vide supra). On further heating, the compound starts to be decomposed at 314 °C. Complex 3 is stable up to 161 °C, and then a gradual weight loss of 5.6% was observed up to 386 °C, which may be attributed to the gradual release of coordinated water molecules (calcd 5.7%). On further heating, the organic moieties of Zn(II) complex began to decompose in a series of weight loss steps between 386 and 618 °C. Complexes 4 and 6 show similar thermal behaviors. The TG curves exhibit an initial weight loss starting at about 149 °C for 4 and 158 °C for 6, with the observed weight loss of 12.8% and 14.0% corresponding to the release of coordinated and lattice water molecules (calcd 13.0% and 15.0%). The results of thermogravimetric analyses for 1, 3, 4 and 6 show the coordinated and lattice water molecules in these compounds can be extruded at about 160 °C, however their main frameworks retain stability until 300 °C. Photoluminescence Properties. The luminescent properties of ligand H3PIDC and complexes 2-6 were investigated in the solid state at room temperature. For complexes 4 and 5, the ligand-centered luminescence has completely disappeared and the typical narrow emission bands of Eu(III) and Tb(III) ions can be detected. Complex 4 exhibits an intense, characteristic transition spectrum of Eu(III) ions upon excitation with a wavelength of 354 nm. As shown in Figure 15a, transitions from the excited 5D0 state to the different J levels of the lower 7F state were observed in the emission spectrum (J ) 0-4), i.e., 5D0-7F0 at 577 nm, 5D0-7F1 at 590 nm, 5D0-7F3 at 612 nm, 5D0-7F3 at 652 nm, and 5D0-7F4 at 698 nm. For 5, the emission spectrum upon excitation at 254 nm shows the characteristic emission bands of Tb(III) at 489, 544, 581, and 619 nm attributed to 5D4-7FJ (J ) 6, 5, 4, and 3) transitions (Figure 15b). The 5D4-7F5 transition is the strongest among the four bands, which consistent with the observation that the 5D4 f 7F5 transition is the preferred transition of terbium-containing materials.13 The splitting for the weak peak at 581 nm is due to the crystal-ﬁeld splitting.14 The photoluminescent spectra of ligand H3PIDC and com- plexes 2, 3 and 6 are shown in Figure 15c. H3PIDC and compounds 2, 3 and 6 exhibit blue photoluminescence with emission maxima at 462, 451, 429, and 440 nm upon excitation at 380, 394, 379, and 397 nm, respectively. Although the maximum emission wavelengths of complexes 2, 3 and 6 undergo a very slight blue-shift, the emission bands for complexes 2, 3 and 6 are very similar to that found for the free ligand in terms of position and band shape. Therefore, the emission bands of complexes 2, 3 and 6 are mainly due to an intraligand emission state as reported for CdII or other d10 metal complexes with N-donor ligands.15 The intensity increase of the luminescence for these complexes may be attributed to the chelation of the ligand to the metal center, which increases the rigidity of HPIDC2- and reduces the nonradiative relaxation process. In combination with their structure analyses, it is found that their wavelengths are interestingly tuned by the dihedral angle between the pyridyl group and imidazole group of ligand HPIDC2-.11a,16 In free ligand H3PIDC, the pyridyl group and imidazole group are almost coplanar (the dihedral angle being ∼1.8°).6 As coordinated with metal ions in 2, 3 and 6, respectively, the dihedral angle between the pyridyl group and imidazole group of ligand HPIDC2- increase (39.2° for 2, 116.9° Figure 14. Isotherms for the adsorption (circles) and desorption (squares) measured for 1 in dehydrated state at 77 K (A ) absolute adsorption; STP ) standard temperature and pressure). Figure 15.

Networks with Topological Diversity Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 9, No. 8, 2009 3429 for 3 and 5.9-7.3° for 6), which is concomitant with a considerable decrease of the conjugative effect for ligand HPIDC2-. Consequently, the luminescence nature of these compounds is metal-perturbed intraligand transition. Magnetic Property. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility (M) of polycrystalline samples 4 was measured in the temperature range 2-300 K under ﬁxed ﬁelds of 1 kOe, and the magnetic susceptibilities M and MT versus T plots are shown in Figure 16. At room temperature, the experimental MT value is 4.31 cm3 mol-1 K, which is very close to the expected value (4.5 cm3 mol-1 K) for an excited state of three Eu(III) ions. As the temperature cools down, the MT values monoto- nously decrease, which is obviously attributed to the thermal depopulation of the Stark components of lanthanide ions at low temperatures.17 At 2 K, MT of 0.048 cm3 mol-1 K is close to zero, indicating a ground state of 7F0 of the Eu(III) ion. Conclusion In summary, six new 2-3D MOFs with architectural diversity have been successfully synthesized under hydrothermal condi- tions. The new multidentate ligand H3PIDC displays plentiful coordination modes and main control for MOF topologies through coordination orientation of 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylate group, and a tunable modiﬁcation for structures can result from the engrafted pyridyl group and the coordination geometry of the introduced metal centers. Both 1 and 2 are 3D MOFs, but being different in structure topologies. Complex 1 is a (10,3) porous metal-organic net with 1D open channels, and this dehydrated porous material can absorb for N2, with a determined BET surface area of 9.07 m2 g-1. However, ligand HPIDC2- and metal center Cd(II) in 2 serve as 4-connected nodes to form a 3D honeycomb framework. Complexes 3-6 all are 2D MOFs built up from T-shaped 3-connected HPIDC2- and 3- or 4-connected metal nodes. With the 3-connected metal nodes Zn(II), a stairway-like MOF with (4.82) topology in 3 created. As for 4-connected metal nodes Eu(III), Tb(III) or Y(III), isostructural MOFs with novel (42.6)2(4.62)2(42.63.8)2(42.62.82) nets in 4-6 form. Notably, ligands HPIDC2- in 1, 3 and 4-6 are all T-shaped 3-connectors, but belonging to different coordination modes, and the coordination lability also results in the structural diversity, even with similar 3-connected nodes such as Fe(II) in 1 and Zn(II) in 3. Thermogravimetric analysis results show the main frameworks of these compounds retain stability until 300 °C. The luminescent nature for 4 and 5 is the typical narrow emission bands of Eu(III) and Tb(III) ions, respectively. It is believed that more metal complexes with interesting structures as well as physical properties will be synthesized from this sort of ligand, and this work is underway in our laboratory now.
