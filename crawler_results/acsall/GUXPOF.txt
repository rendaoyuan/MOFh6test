The starting dpds reagent was partly converted into dps ligand in 1 and wholly transferred into dps in 2 via new in situ cleavage of both S-S and S-C bonds and temperature-dependent in situ ligand rearrangement of dpds. The design and synthesis of new metal-organic frameworks has been shown to be a promising ﬁeld, not only because of their potential applications as functional solid materials in host-guest chemistry, ion exchange, and catalysis but also because of their intriguing variety of architectural features and fascinating new topologies.1-3 To build these molecular architectures, researchers often employ bridging polycarboxylate and bipyridyl ligands to construct coordination polymers because of their versatile coordina- tion modes and high structural stability.4 In contrast to the large and increasing amount of work on the synthesis with ligands containing O or N donors, there have been fewer reports of studies based on organothiolate ligands. Two kinds of organothiolate ligands, thiolatopyridine and thiolatocarboxylate, have been ex- plored to construct structures with luminescent or magnetic properties.5,6 4,4′-Dipyridyldisulﬁde (dpds) has recently attracted attention not only because of its twisted conformation, with a C-S-S-C torsion angle of ca. 90° and axial chirality that potentially generate M and P enantiomers in chiral crystal engineer- ing, but also the easy cleavage of the S-S bond.7,8 As reported, the dpds ligand in most of the compounds tends to adopt the pyridyl form that coordinates with metal atoms through the nitrogen donor without S-S bond cleavage under room temperature.9 However, in some cases, dpds could be converted into other related com- pounds.10 Recently, in a report by Tong et al., where reactions of the dpds ligand with CuI were conducted under solvothermal conditions, the dpds reagent was unprecedentedly converted into two isomeric ligands, 4,4′-dipyridylsulﬁde (dps) and 1-(4-pyridyl)- 4-thiopyridine (ptp) at 120 and 160 °C in CH3CN solution, respectively.11 Carla Aragoni et al. also reported the reactions between dpds and dithiophosphato NiII complexes yielding three different bridging ligands from in situ chemical rearrangement of the starting dpds reagent (dpds, dps, and dipyridyltrisulﬁde) in CH3OH-CH2Cl2 or CH3CH2OH-CH2Cl2 mixed solution.12 Pyri- dine-4-thiolate was also created from a dpds precursor through reductive cleavage of the disulﬁde bond under solvothermal conditions in CH3OH-CH3CN mixed solution.13 Here we carried out the solvothermal reactions of Co(OAc)2·4H2O with dpds and H2tbip at different temperatures in CH3OH-H2O solution where dpds can unpredictably partly converted into dps in compound 1 and predictably wholly transferred into dps in compound 2. Although detailed studies are still required to better understand the reason for the generation of various results from a dpds precursor, the results show that the solvent is an important factor for the formation of the ﬁnal structures. The crystal structure of 1 exhibits a 3D network composed of trinuclear [Co3(µ3-OH)]5+ cluster nodes and dps, dpds, tbip, and Htbip bridging ligands. The dps ligand in 1 was generated from the in situ cleavage and rearrangement reactions of the dpds ligand in the presence of Co(II). To the best of our knowledge, this is the only example of dpds partly converting into dps in situ. There are three crystallographic independent cobalt atoms in 1 (Figure 1a and Figure S1a in the Supporting Information). Co1 is six-coordinated with a distorted octahedral geometry with two nitrogen atoms of * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN 2009 VOL. 9, NO. 5 2036–2038 10.1021/cg801120y CCC: $40.75 2009 American Chemical Society Published on Web 03/19/2009 two dps ligands, two oxygen atoms from two tbip ligands, one oxygen atom from a Htbip ligand, and one hydroxyl group. Co2 adopts a distorted octahedral [O5N] coordination geometry with two carboxylic oxygen atoms from two tbip ligands, two carboxylic oxygen atoms from two Htbip ligands, one hydroxyl group and one nitrogen atom of a dpds ligand. Different from Co1 and Co2, Co3 adopts a distorted tetrahedral [O4] coordination environment and is coordinated by three carboxylic oxygen atoms from three tbip ligands and one oxygen atom from a µ3-hydroxyl group. The Co· · · Co distances bridged by the µ3-hydroxyl group are 3.168, 3.345, and 3.528 Å, respectively. As mentioned above, there are trinuclear [Co3(µ3-OH)]5+ clusters which act as nodes in an overall 3D network. Each cluster is supported by four carboxylate groups that also bridge between cobalt atoms (Figure 1b). Two further carboxylates coordinate in monodentate fashions, however the uncoordinated oxygen of one accepts a hydrogen bond from the central µ3-OH, whereas the other monodentate carboxylate has an uncoordinated hydroxide that hydrogen bonds to an oxygen of a bridging carboxylate. Thus there are six carboxylate groups associated with each cluster, which come from both tbip and Htbip ligands. Furthermore, there are three pyridyl groups also coordinated to the cluster: two from dps ligands and one from a dpds ligand. All nine of these carboxylate and pyridyl ligands bridge to adjoining clusters; however, each cluster is connected to only ﬁve neighboring clusters (Figure 1c). This is because some pairs of clusters are connected by more than one ligand. Each cluster is connected to two others by single tbip bridges, to two more by both a tbip and a dps bridge, and to a ﬁfth by two Htbip and one dpds bridge. The cluster thus acts as a 5-connecting node, and the overall 3D 5-connected network topology is shown in Figure 1d. It has boron nitride (or bnn) topology,14 with the Schla¨ﬂi symbol 46.64. This net may be described as cross-linked (6,3) sheets; in 1 the tbip and Htbip/Htbip/ dpds bridges link the clusters into the (6,3) sheets, whereas the connections between the sheets are provided by the tbip/dps intercluster bridges. The effective free volume of 1 was calculated by PLATON analysis as 7.8% of the crystal volume (429.8 out of the 5520.5 Å3 unit cell volume), shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. The structure of 2 contains three different cobalt atoms, two different tbip ligands, one type of dps ligand, one type of water ligand, as well as intercalated methanol and water molecules. The Co1 center is coordinated by ﬁve oxygen atoms from three different tbip ligands and one nitrogen atom from one dps ligand. Co2 adopts a distorted octahedral [O6] coordination environment and is coordinated by six carboxylic oxygen atoms from six different tbip ligands. One Co2 and two Co1 ions are bridged by six carboxylate groups to form a linear Co3(CO2)6 trimeric cluster (Figure 3a and Figure S3b in the Supporting Information). The third type of cobalt, Co3, is bound by two tbip ligands, two dps ligands, and two terminal H2O molecules. Each trimer is connected to two others via two pairs of tbip ligands that show the bridging mode shown in Scheme S1c in the Supporting Information. It is also connected to two Co3 atoms via two of the other type of tbip ligand, which show the bridging mode shown in Scheme S1d in the Supporting Information, and two other Co3 atoms via bridging dps ligands (Figure 2b). Thus each trimer is connected to two other trimers (two via pairs of tbip ligands) and four Co3 atoms (via single tbip and dps bridges). Therefore, the trimer acts as a 6-connecting node in the overall structure. The Co3 atoms, in turn, act as 4-connecting nodes, coordinating to two trimers via tbip ligands and two others via dps bridges. The overall topology, therefore, is that of a binodal 4,6-connected network with the (44.62)(44.610.8) Schla¨ﬂi symbol (Figure 2c).The structure may also be described in terms of chains of trimers connected by the double tbip bridges, which are then interconnected by the single tbip bridges and Co3 atoms to give sheets (Figure 3a). These sheets are then pillared by the dps spacers into a noninterpenetrated 3D MOF structure (Figure 2d and Figure S3b in the Supporting Information).The channels in 2 are ﬁlled with guest methanol and water molecules. The effective free volume of 2 was calculated by PLATON analysis as 23.5% of the crystal volume (483.3 out of the 2058.5 Å3 unit cell volume). The TG curve for compound 2 shows that the ﬁrst weight loss of 10.5% (calcd: 10.4%) from 30 to 280 °C is due to the loss of two free water molecules, one coordinated water molecule, and one methanol molecule per formula unit (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The second process might start from 280 to 800 °C, indicating the decomposition of the coordination framework. The ﬁnal residue of 21.6% is close to the calculated 18.0% based on CoO. PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) measurements at different temperatures (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) show that for compound 2 after heating 280 °C for 8 h, the spectra are similar to the original one, suggesting that their crystalline nature is still maintained after removing the guest molecules. The magnetic susceptibilities, M, of 1 and 2 were measured in the 2- 300 K temperature range, and are shown as MT and M versus T plots in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information. The experimental MT values of 1 and 2 at room temperature are 7.51 and 8.24 cm3 K mol-1, respectively, which are slightly larger than the spin value expected for three uncoupled high-spin Co(II) ions (5.63 cm3 K mol-1). The MT value of 1 steadily decreases with decreasing temperature to reach a minimum value of 7.05 cm3 K mol-1 at 35 K. Upon further cooling, the MT values increase up to maximum of 8.06 cm3 K mol-1 at 7 K and then goes down quickly to a minimum value of 5.12 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The decrease in MT at high temperature is a typical manner of spin-orbit coupling and is mainly due to the single-ion behavior of Co(II).15 The increase in MT between 35 and 7 K is due to the ferromagnetic coupling within the µ3-OH-bridged Co(II) ions.16 The M vs H measurement at 2 K among 0-60 KOe is given in Figure Figure 2.

Field-cooled magnetic susceptibility at ﬁelds of 30 Oe (see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information) shows there is no apex in the plot, suggesting impossible spin-glass or superparamagnetic behavior. The MT product of 2 continuously decreases as the temperature is lowered to 2 K, which suggests that antiferromagnetic interactions are operative in 2. The temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibilities (1/M) of 2 obey the Curie-Weiss law above 50 K with θ ) -19.65 K, C ) 5.82 cm3 K mol-1, R ) 9.83 × 10-4 for 2. The moderate negative θ values indicate the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions between adjacent Co(II) ions even if a contribution from the spin-orbit coupling of Co(II) is also present.17 In summary, we have successfully synthesized two novel coordination polymers based on dpds and H2tbip with Co(II) under hydrothermal conditions. Compound 1 is a 3D framework with triangular trinuclear Co units as nodes while compound 2 forms a 3D network with linear trinuclear and mononuclear Co units as nodes. Interestingly, mixed dps and dpds ligands as well as a dps ligand from a dpds precursor through the cleavage of the S-S and S-C bond occurred in 1 and 2, respectively. Such an unprecedented in situ solvothermal organothiolate ligand synthesis provides a useful route to the construction of metalorganosulﬁde compounds and new materials. Acknowledgment.
