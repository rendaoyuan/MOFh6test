In addition, the 7′ (a ) 15.9712(18) Å, b ) 15.9253(19) Å, c ) 18.475(2) Å, Pbca), a compound isostructural with 7, is synthesized by using cyclohexanol as a template. Thus, these cobalt(II) imidazolate polymers are reminiscent of the zeolite syntheses in that not only the same topological structure can be synthesized by using the different organic templates, but also different topological structures can be synthesized by using the same organic template. Introduction Coordination polymers are currently the most attractive topics1 in the investigation of properties and applications in catalysis, chirality, conductivity, luminescence, magnetism, sensors, nonlinear optics, and porosity. Especially the poro- sity of substances has attracted the increasing attention of scientists so that considerable efforts have been devoted to the rational design and synthesis of the new materials.2,3 Yaghi et al. have developed a strategy for the synthesis of the MOFs (metal organic frameworks) by expanding and decorating the inorganic mineral topologies. With the strategy they have successfully obtained a large number of MOFs, some of which have exhibited relatively good stability,4 unprecedented porosity,5 and unusual adsorption properties.5,6 To create such new materials, we are also undertaking a strategy of imitating the zeolitic structures,7 namely, the natural choices for the porous materials. By employing cobalt(II) imidazolate polymer as an organic silica analogue, we have obtained a porous zeolite-like structure7a and some silica-like extended frameworks with structural features of zeolites.7b More interesting is that the cobalt(II) imidazolate synthesis is also reminiscent of the zeolite synthetic feature although its reaction mechanism11 is quite different from that of the zeolite synthesis;12 however, the same topological structures of cobalt(II) imidazolate can be generated by using different templates7b just similar to the zeolite synthesis. Can different structures of cobalt(II) imidazolate also be generated by using the same template as in the zeolitic synthesis that will imply the existence of further extended polymorphism * Authors to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Chem. 2004, 43, 4631−4635 10.1021/ic049713z CCC: $27.50 © 2004 American Chemical Society Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 43, No. 15, 2004 4631 Published on Web 06/29/2004 of the substance? In this Article, we present two cobalt(II) imidazolate polymers, the CaAl2Si2O8-related polymorph 6 and the CaGa2O4-related polymorph 7, both of which are solvothermally synthesized by using N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) as a template. Also, cobalt(II) imidazolate 7′, a species isostructural with 7, is produced by using cyclohex- anol (Ch) as a template, from which the polymorph 2′ 7b was previously produced (the numeral symbols follow the serial numbers of the cobalt(II) imidazolates denoted in our former paper7b). Results and Discussion Synthesis of the Cobalt(II) Imidazolates. The cobalt(II) imidazolates 6 and 7 are prepared solvothermally by using DMA as the template and the piperazine as coordination buffering ligand, while 7′ is prepared by using Ch as the template. For the synthesis of 6, the reaction mixture of cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate, imidazole, and piperazine is in a ratio of 1:2:1 (molar ratio) with a reaction time of 24 h at 130 °C. But for the preparation of the polymorphs 7 and 7′, the reaction mixtures have to be modulated to a ratio of 1:2:1.6, the solvothermal temperature must be raised to 150 °C with addition of zeolite (4A) to the reaction mixture, and the solvothermal time should be prolonged to 3 days. It should be noticed that the formation of compound 7 is always accompanied by the crystallization of polymorph 6, and if the zeolite were not added, the reaction product would be the cobalt(II) imidazolate 47b with a relatively larger frame- work density. The use of extra piperazine for preparing polymorph 7 (or 7′) implies that the free Co2+ in the reaction mixture can be reduced; further, the polymerization of cobalt imidazolate will be slowed, which favors the formation of a thermodynamically controlled polymorph. Raising the sol- vothermal temperature and prolonging the solvothermal reaction time are also strategies for obtaining a thermody- namically controlled polymorph. However, the added zeolite in the reaction system is only to reduce free water in the reaction mixture since the free water not only competes with imidazolate in the cobalt imidazolate polymerization, but also automatically generates a high pressure in the autoclave, which favors the formation of an even more thermodynami- cally stable species, such as the cobalt imidazolate 4. Thereby, we regard the polymorph 6 as a dynamically controlled polymorph and the polymorph 7 as the thermo- dynamically controlled one. To prepare a dynamically controlled cobalt imidazolate polymorph with a lower framework density (or even larger pores), a strategy is needed for decreasing the reaction temperature and finding new organic bases, or buffering ligands and work in this direction is in progress. Crystal Structures of the Cobalt(II) Imidazolate Com- pounds. Compounds 6 and 7 are polymorphs formulated as [Co(Im)2‚0.5DMA]∞, while compound 7′ is formulated as [Co(Im)2‚0.5Ch]∞. Their structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements (Table 1). Like those of the other cobalt(II) imidazolate polymers,7b the cobalt(II) ions in the two polymorphs are also exclusively 4-coordinated (Figure 1a) and bridged by imidazolates, forming three-dimensional (3D) infinite frameworks. The polymorph 6 crystallizes centrosymmetrically in space group P21/n, and its secondary building units (SBUs) are 4- and 6-rings, from which the subunits of 4264-cages (Figure 1b) are built up. Further, from the cage units, the framework related to the silicate CaAl2Si2O8 of CrB4 topology8 is constructed (Figure (8) O’Keeffe, M.; Li, H.; Eddaoudi, M.; Reineke, T.; Yaghi, O. M. J.

CaAl2Si2O8 is a natural calcium aluminosilicate, in which 4-, 6-, and 8-rings are present. However, these 8-rings are tilted ellipses forming rather small effective channels that are filled with calcium ions. Therefore, the CaAl2Si2O8 is actually nonporous. However, as the expanded structure of CaAl2Si2O8, compound 6 accommodates guest molecules: two DMA molecules are encapsulated in each of the 4264- cages. Even so, the largest opening of the cages is only ca. 2.5 Å, while the 8-rings generated by the 4264-cages also do not result in the expected channels since the imidazolato rings are all oriented toward the channels, and they are, therefore, stuffed (Figure 1c). Thus, compound 6 is also a nonporous material with framework atoms accounting for ca. 72.9% of the total unit cell volume. The CaAl2Si2O8-related structure with a boron framework of CrB4 has been once reported in indium sulfide.9 Here, the polymorph 6 is the first example of a coordination polymer related to the structure of feldspars. In 1997, Keller reported an interesting feldspar-like coordination polymer,10 the structure of which is in an unprecedented topology and is confessedly different from any topological structure of the feldspars. Compounds 7 and 7′ are isostructural; they crystallize centrosymmetrically in the space group Pbca. The SBUs of their frameworks are 4-and 6-rings, from which the subunits of 4268-cages are constructed (Figure 2a). Similar to the sodalite net that is space-filled by â-cages (the 4668-cages), the polymorph 7 (or 7′) shows a net with the expanded Ga framework of CaGa2O4 that is space-filled by the 4268-cages. Kim and co-workers first reported an MOF15 with decorated CaGa2O4 topology. However, the polymorph 7 (or 7′) is an MOF with expanded CaGa2O4 topology. Also, the CaGa2O4 topology can be described as a 3D net with 6-ring SBUs, from which the subunits of corrugated sheets (Figure 2b,c) are formed. These sheets of three-connected nodes are linked to each other in the c-direction, giving rise to a 3D framework by completing the 4-coordination of the nodes (Figure 2d,e). Like compound 6, two DMA molecules are also encapsulated in each of the 4268-cages of the polymorph 7, with framework atoms accounting for ca. 73.2% of the total unit cell volume. Although the polymorphs 6 and 7 show great differences in structure, they can be prepared by using the same organic template (solvent) of DMA. This synthetic feature that different zeolites can be prepared by using the same organic template and vice versa only exists in the zeolite syntheses.13 Besides the structural features of zeolites,7 the cobalt(II) imidazolate polymers are also reminiscent of the above- mentioned synthetic features of zeolites. For coordination polymers, the cases of one structure directed by different templates are quite common. However, the cases of different structures with identical chemical composition directed by one template are very rare. The case for inorganic zeolites (SiO2) is due to the structural richness of the substances that benefit from the inherent flexibility of Si-Si-Si angles. As a compound related to SiO2, Co(im)2 should also exhibit the flexibility of Co-Co-Co angles that will give rise to the structural richness of the MOFs. Thereby, preparing more than one structure of cobalt(II) imidazolate frameworks by using one template is our purpose to prove Co(im)2 is the analogue of SiO2. It is this experimental result that let us see the great possibilities for realizing a real zeolitic structure from the cobalt(II) (or zinc(II)) imidazolate frame- works. Thermal Stabilities and Magnetic Properties of the Novel Cobalt(II) Imidazolate Compounds. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen stream show ca. 11.5% weight loss for the polymorph 6 from 100 to 240 °C and ca. 15.6% weight loss for the polymorph 7 from 50 to 200 °C, which are assigned to the loss of the all DMA molecules. There is almost no weight loss for polymorph 6 until 320 °C and for polymorph 7 until 345 °C. Then, the two polymorphs begin to decompose. The DTA and TGA measurements for compound 7′ were not conducted due to the impurity of the product. (9) Li, H.; Laine, A.; O’Keeffe, M.; Yaghi, O. M. Science 1999, 283, 1145-1147. (10) Keller, S. W.

Two Polymorphs of Cobalt(II) Imidazolate Polymers Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 43, No. 15, 2004 4633 dc and ac magnetic measurements for 6 and 7 at 2-300 K reveal a dominant antiferromagnetic coupling between thecobalt(II) ions, which is exclusively similar to the cases for the cobalt(II) imidazolate polymers 1-5.7b,14 Although polymorphs 6 and 7 crystallize in the centrosymmetric space groups, both of them show weak ferromagnetism from spin- canting at low temperature. The single-bridging imidazolate linkages producing a low-symmetry CoII-L-CoII exchange pathway should be responsible for the antisymmetric interac- tion. The magnetic ordering temperatures are 16.6 and 12.6 K for 6 and 7, respectively (Figure 3). However, for the polymorph 7, the weak magnetism from canting seems also to be hidden,13 which is similar to the case for the cobalt(II) imidazolate 5.7b Conclusion Two polymorphs of cobalt(II) imidazolate polymers have been solvothermally synthesized by using DMA as a template. Both of the polymorphs show zeolite-like struc- tures: polymorph 6 is related to the structure of the silicate CaAl2Si2O8, and polymorph 7 shows a Ga network of CaGa2O4. Similar to the results of zeolite synthesis, our results reveal for the first time that not only the same framework of a coordination polymer can be prepared by using different templates,7b but also different frameworks of a coordination polymer can be prepared by using the same template, which implies the richness of cobalt(II) imidazolate structures similar to that of the silicates; thereby, this substance can serve as a metal-organic silica analogue, from which a real zeolitic structure may be eventually realized if a proper synthetic strategy is employed.
