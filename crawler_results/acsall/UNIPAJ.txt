China Received May 14, 2010; Revised Manuscript Received August 15, 2010 ABSTRACT: A series of six CdII coordination complexes have been prepared by using naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (H2ndc), an analogue of 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2bdc), and different N-donor auxiliary co-ligands (chelating or bridging), namely, [Cd(ndc)]¥ (1), {[Cd2(ndc)2(2bpy)2(H2O)2](CH3OH)0.5}2 (2), [Cd2(ndc)2(phen)2]¥ (3), {[Cd(ndc)(4bpy)0.5- (H2O)2](H2O)}¥ (4), {[Cd(ndc)(abp)(H2O)](H2O)}¥ (5), and {[Cd(ndc)(bpp)2](H2O)3}¥ (6) (ndc = naphthalene-2,3-dicarbox- ylate, 2bpy = 2,20-bipyridine, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 4bpy = 4,40-bipyridine, abp = trans-4,40-azobis(pyridine), and bpp = 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl) propane). The initial complex 1 shows a two-dimensional (2-D) (44.62) coordination network. 2 and 3 possess tetranuclear and one-dimensional (1-D) structures due to the incorporation of auxiliary chelating co-ligands 2bpy and phen, respectively, which are further interlinked via secondary interactions such as hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking to result in higher-dimensional supramolecular networks. When the 4,40-dipyridyl-type bridging co-ligands 4bpy, abp, and bpp (with different N,N0-donor separations of the molecular backbones from ca. 7-10 A˚ ) were used as the additional rod-like linkers, a 2-D (3,4)- connected (42.6)(42.63.8) layered coordination net 4 as well as a three-dimensional (3-D) coordination framework 5 with an unusual 4-connected irl topology (42.63.8) and a homochiral 3-D diamond (dia) network 6 were obtained. A structural comparison of these complexes with those based on the structurally related ligand 1,2-benzenedicarboxylate (bdc) suggests that the extended π-conjugated system of ndc with a different electronic nature and steric bulk plays an important role in the construction of supramolecular architectures for 1-6, which can also be well regulated by the different chelating or bridging N-donor co-ligands. Moreover, complexes 1-6 exhibit strong solid-state luminescence emissions at room temperature, which mainly originate from the intraligand π f π* transitions of ndc. Introduction In recent years, extensive experimental and theoretical efforts have been focused on the rational design and con- trolled synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs),1 also known as coordination polymers, from predesigned bridging ligands and metal ions, because such hybrid materials can exhibit a variety of regulated and interesting structural topologies2,3 as well as many potential applications in photo- luminescence,4 magnetism,5 catalysis,6 gas storage,7 conducti- vity,8 nonlinear optics (NLO),9 ion exchange,10 ferroelectri- city,11 optoelectronic effect,12 and spin-transition behavior.13 In this field, several synthetic strategies have been developed to achieve the targeting assemblies of such extended crystal- line systems with desired structural features and/or physico- chemical properties,1-13 among which the appropriate choice of well-designed organic building blocks and metal ions or clusters is one of the most effective ways.1,2 In other words, nowadays, utilizing suitable organic tectons with various functional groups that are capable of bridging metal centers to construct such crystalline materials has demonstrated to be an active area of multidisciplinary research, being in connec- tion with crystal engineering, coordination/supramolecular chemistry, and material science.2-13 Among the organic ligands, the versatile multicarboxyl compounds, especially aromatic benzene- and naphthalene- based derivatives, such as benzenedicarboxyl (1,4-,14 1,3-,15 or 1,2-16), 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxyl,17 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxyl,18 1,2,3,4,5-benzenepentacarboxyl,19 and 1,2,3,4,5,6-benzenehexa- carboxyl,20 naphthalenedicarboxyl (1,4-21 or 2,6-22), 1,4,5,8- naphthalenetetracarboxyl,23 have been extensively used in the preparation of a variety of metal-carboxylate complexes owing to their reliable and rich coordination modes.14-23 To investigate the influence of the bulky aromatic skeletons of such ligands on the structures and properties of their coordi- nation complexes, anthracene-9-carboxylic acid,24 anthracene- 9,10-dicarboxylic acid,25 anthracene-2,3,6,7-tetracarboxylic acid,26 and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid27 have been used by us and others to construct a series of coordination metal complexes, which show diverse discrete (dinuclear, tetran- uclear, pentanuclear, or hexanuclear) and infinite (1-D, 2-D, or 3-D) structures as well as interesting magnetic and lumi- nescent properties.24-27 Despite the remarkable achievements in this aspect,1-13 however, to predict and further accurately control the framework array of a given crystalline product still remain a considerable challenge at this stage. This mainly arises from the fact that the subtle assembled progress may be influenced by many intrinsic and external parameters, such as the auxiliary co-ligands,1a,f solvent,28a,b concentration,28c,d counteranion,28etemperature,28fandpHvalueofthesolution,28g *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

For instance, the introduction of 2,20-bipyridyl-like chelating reagents1f or 4,40-bipyridyl-like bridging tectons1a,e,29 as auxiliary co-ligands, into metal-carbox- yl reaction systems will lead to the formation of interesting coordination architectures. In this context, naphthalene-2,3- dicarboxylate (ndc) with the extended π-conjugated system, as an analogic but bulky derivative of 1,2-benzenedicarboxylate (bdc), has almost not been noticed so far. Significantly, an analysis of the current Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) reveals only one mononuclear CuII complex [Cu(trpy)(ndc)- (H2O)] with ndc and the co-ligand 2,20: 60200-terpyridine (trpy).30 Herein, we will describe six new CdII coordination complexes based on the bulky ndc ligand, which display distinct supramolecular architectures under the intervention of chelating or bridging N-donor auxiliary co-ligands. Solid- state properties for these crystalline materials, such as fluores- cence and thermal stability, have also been investigated. Experimental Section Materials and General Methods. With the exception of trans-4,40- azobis(pyridine) (abp), which was prepared according to the litera- ture procedure,31 all the starting reagents and solvents for synthesis and analysis were commercially available and used as received. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL III Elementar analyzer. IR spectra were recorded in the range of 4000-400 cm-1 on a Tensor 27 OPUS (Bruker) FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were car- ried out on a Perkin-Elmer Diamond SII thermal analyzer from room temperature to 800 C under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 C/min. The emission and excitation spectra were recorded on an F-7000 (Hitachi) spectrophotometer at room tem- perature. Synthesis of the Complexes. [Cd(ndc)]¥ (1).

Caution! Although we have met no problem in handling the cadmium(II) perchlorate during this work, it should be treated cautiously due to the potential explosive nature. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination. X-ray single- crystal diffraction data for complexes 1-6 were collected on a Bruker Smart 1000 CCD area-detector diffractometer with Mo- KR radiation (λ = 0.71073 A˚ ) by ω scan mode. The program SAINT32 was used for integration of the diffraction profiles. Semi- empirical absorption corrections were applied using SADABS.33 All the structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS program of the SHELXTL package and refined by full-matrix least- squares methods with SHELXL.34 Metal atoms were located from the E-maps and the other non-hydrogen atoms were located in successive difference Fourier syntheses and refined with anisotropic thermal parameters on F2. The C-bound hydrogen atoms were generated theoretically and refined with isotropic thermal para- meters riding on the parent atoms. The hydrogen atoms of the water and partial methanol molecules in 2, 4, 5, and 6 were first located by difference Fourier E-maps and then treated isotropically as riding. Further details for structural analysis are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond parameters and H-bonding geometries are listed in Tables S1-S6 (Supporting Information) and Table 2. Powder X-ray Diffraction. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of 1-6 were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance diffracto- meter (Cu-KR, λ = 1.54056 A˚ ) at 40 kV and 30 mA, by using a Cu-target tube and a graphite monochromator. The powder sam- ples were prepared by crushing the crystals and the intensity data were recorded by continuous scan in a 2θ/θ mode from 3 to 80 with a step size of 0.02 and a scan speed of 8/min. Simulation of the PXRD patterns was carried out by the single-crystal data and diffraction-crystal module of the Mercury (Hg) program. Results and Discussion Synthesis Consideration and General Characterization. For a systematic investigation of the coordination features of H2ndc, our strategy is to prepare a series of CdII complexes by changing systematically the auxiliary co-ligands including the 2,20-bipyridyl-like chelating ligands (2bpy and phen) or 4,40-bipyridyl-like bridging ligands with different N,N0-do- nor separations (ca. 7 A˚ for 4bpy, ca. 9 A˚ for abp, and ca. 10 A˚ for bpp). According to our experimental results, when a direct combination of the CdII salt and organic ligand, that is, using the conventional solution method followed by a solvent evaporation, either no evidence of solid formation or a mass of uncharacterized microcrystalline powders were Article Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 11, 2010 4775 obtained. Therefore, a properly lowering the reaction speed may facilitate the growth of well-shaped single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction.35 Considering this point, the synthesis and isolation of 1-6 in this work were carried out through the self-assembly reactions of CdII salt with H2ndc, together with different auxiliary co-ligands (except in 1), by using the slow diffusion method under ambient conditions. Complexes 1-6 are air stable and all general characteriza- tions were carried out by using the single-crystal samples. The IR spectra usually show features attributable to each component of the complexes.36 In the IR spectra of 1-6, the broad bands centered at ca. 3400 cm-1 (3441 cm-1 for 1, 3443 cm-1 for 2, 3382 cm-1 for 3, 3390 cm-1 for 4, 3422 cm-1 for 5, and 3407 cm-1 for 6) indicate O-H stretching of the aqua molecules. As a matter of fact, the IR absorption of carboxylate group is very complicated due to its coordina- tion diversity. The characteristic bands of the carboxylate groups in 1-6 appear in the usual region at 1610-1542 cm-1 for the antisymmetric stretching vibrations and at 1471- 1389 cm-1 for the symmetric stretching vibrations.37 Fur- thermore, the Δν values [Δν = νasym(COO-) - νsym(COO-)] are 85 and 149 cm-1 for 1, 168 cm-1 for 2, 161 cm-1 for 3, 136 and 147 cm-1 for 4, 126 and 149 cm-1 for 5, and 164 and 215 cm-1 for 6, respectively, which are consistent with their solid structural features as observed in the crystal structures.36,37 Description of the Crystal Structures for 1-6. [Cd(ndc)]¥ (1). Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals a neutral 2-D layered coordination network of 1. The asymmetric unit is composed of one CdII ion and one fully deprotonated ndc ligand (see Figure 1a). Each distorted octahedral CdII center is defined by six carboxylate O atoms from four different ndc ligands. All the Cd-O bond distances (2.248(2)-2.407(3) A˚ ) and the bond angles (54.93(9)-141.71(9)) around CdII are typical and comparable with those of other similar CdII-carboxylato complexes in the literature (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information).24b,25i,16 In 1, the ndc ligand takes the μ2-η1:η2-chelating/bridging coordination mode for each carboxylate (see Scheme 1a and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Interestingly, a pair of carboxy- late groups (O1-C1-O2 and O3-C12-O4) connects two CdII centers to form a Cd2 14-membered ring subunit with the nonbonding Cd 3 3 3 Cd separation of 5.735(1) A˚ . These dinuclear subunits are further linked through the monatomic carboxylate bridges to generate a 2-D layer running parallel to the (100) plane (see Figure 1b). A better insight into the 2-D network of 1 can be achieved by using the topological approach. If one considers each Cd2 14-membered ring subunit as a 6-connected node (see Figure 1b), which in turn is connected to six nearest neigh- bors, then this 2-D layer can be rationalized as a 6-connected 36 topological network (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). On the other hand, if both ndc ligand and CdII ion are regarded as the 4-connecting nodes, this structure can be regarded as a familiar 4-connected topological network with the Schl€afli symbol of (44.62) (see Figure 1c). Notably, all 4-connecting nodes in this case take the tetrahedral geometries and thus, result in a nonplanar feature of the 2-D layer. {[Cd2(ndc)2(2bpy)2(H2O)2](CH3OH)0.5}2 (2). When the bidentate chelating ligand 2bpy was introduced into the assembled system, a distinct centrosymmetric tetranuclear complex 2 was produced (see Figure 2). The asymmetric unit contains two crystallographically unique CdII ions (Cd1 and Table 1.

Cd2), two ndc ligands, two chelating 2bpy ligands, two H2O ligands, and half a lattice CH3OH molecule (see Figure 2a). The Cd1 ion is penta-coordinated by two N-donors from one 2bpy ligand (Cd1-N1 = 2.351(4) A˚ ; Cd1-N2 = 2.312(4) A˚ ; N1-Cd1-N2 = 70.32(15)) and three O atoms from two different ndc ligands as well as one H2O ligand. Several parameters are used to define the geometry of penta-coordi- nated metal centers, and the most common one is the τ factor defined by Addison et al. (τ = 0 for a regular square-pyramid and τ = 1 for a regular trigonal-bipyramid).38 The τ value of 0.04 for Cd1 indicates a nearly ideal square-pyramid environment. The Cd2 ion takes a distorted pentagonal- dipyramidal geometry via coordinating to two N-donors from one 2bpy ligand (Cd2-N3=2.314(4) A˚ ; Cd2-N4 = 2.3364 A˚ ; N3-Cd2-N4=70.21(16)) and five O atoms from two ndc ligands and one H2O ligand. All the Cd-O (2.183(3)-2.620(3) A˚ ) and Cd-N (2.312(4) and 2.351(4) A˚ ) bond lengths as well as the bond angles around CdII (52.75(11)-154.28(12)) (see Table S2 in the Supporting In- formation) are in the normal range expected for similar complexes.24b,25i,16 For ndc ligand, two different kinds of carboxylate groups exist, namely, μ1-η1:η1-chelating fashion for O3-C12-O4 and O5-C13-O6 and μ1-η1:η0-monoden- tate mode for O1-C1-O2 and O7-C24-O8 (see Scheme 1b and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Intramolecular O-H 3 3 3 O interactions (see Figure 2a) are observed between the coordinated H2O (O10) and carboxylate O3/O8 atoms of ndc (O10-H1W3 3 3 O8 and O10-H2W3 3 3 O3; see Table 2 for detailed hydrogen-bonding geometry).39 In addition, the adjacent tetranuclear units are extended into a 1-D chain (see see Figure 2b) along the [101] direction by intermolecular O-H 3 3 3 O bonds (O9-H3W 3 3 3 O2 and O9-H4W3 3 3 O5; see Table 2).

Article Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 11, 2010 4777 parallel to the (010) plane is constructed (see Figure 2c), by intermolecular C-H 3 3 3 O interactions between 2bpy and ndc (C31-H31A 3 3 3 O1 and C38-H38A 3 3 3 O5; see Table 2) as well as π 3 3 3 π stacking between the 2bpy ligands.40 The centroid-centroid and interplanar separations are 3.782 and 3.448 A˚ with their dihedral angle of 3.0. This structure also contains various intra- and internetwork C-H 3 3 3 π supramolecular interactions between the naphthyl and/or pyridyl rings of ndc and 2bpy ligands with an edge-to-face orientation, further affording an overall 3-D supramolecular network (d = 2.875, 2.897, 3.091, and 3.014 A˚ , A = 136, 142, 123, and 145; d and A stand for H 3 3 3 π separations and C-H 3 3 3 π angles in the C-H 3 3 3 π patterns, respectively),41 as calculated by the PLATON program.42 [Cd2(ndc)2(phen)2]¥ (3). Sequentially, when we used phen instead of 2bpy as the chelating co-ligand, a 1-D coordina- tion polymer 3 was produced (see Figure 3). The asymmetric unit contains two crystallographically unique CdII ions (Cd1 and Cd2), two fully deprotonated ndc ligands, and two phen ligands. Each CdII center is in a distorted octahedral geo- metry (see Table S3 in the Supporting Information), being surrounded by four carboxylate O atoms from three ndc ligands and two N-donors from one phen (see Figure 3a). However, the Cd1 and Cd2 centers have slight difference in bond distances and angles (i.e., Cd1-N1 = 2.401(3) A˚ , Cd1-N2 = 2.384(4) A˚ , and N1-Cd1-N2 = 70.19(13); Cd2-N3 = 2.410(4) A˚ , Cd2-N4 = 2.395(4) A˚ , and N3-Cd2-N4 = 68.61(15)). Still, all the Cd-O and Cd-N distances and bond angles around each CdII fall into the normal range (see Table S3 in the Supporting Information). Two different coordination modes of the carboxylate groups are observed for the ndc ligands in 3, namely, μ2-η2:η0- monodentate-bridging mode for O1-C1-O2 and μ2-η1:η1- syn-anti bridging mode for O3-C12-O4, O5-C13-O6, Figure 2.

The dihedral angles between the carboxylate planes and the naphthyl ring skeletons in ndc ligands are in the range of 29.1-48.0. As a result, the Cd1 and Cd2 ions are in turn connected by three μ2-η1:η1-syn-anti carboxylate groups of two different ndc ligands (O3-C12- O4, O5-C13-O6, and O7-C24-O8) to form two nonpla- nar eight-membered rings composed of Cd1-O3-C12 -O4-Cd2-O5-C13-O6 and Cd2-O7-C24-O8-Cd2A- O7A-C24A-O8A, with the nonbonding Cd1 3 3 3 Cd2 and Cd2 3 3 3 Cd2A separations of 4.0034(5) and 4.1451(6) A˚ , re- spectively (see Figure 3a). As such, twosymmetry-related O1- C1-O2 carboxylate groups link two adjacent Cd1 ions to generate a planar four-membered ring of Cd1-O1- Cd1B-O1B with the nonbonding Cd13 3 3 Cd1B separation of 3.6205(5) A˚ (seeFigure3a). Asa consequence, a1-D chainis formed along the [001] direction. In addition, the adjacent 1-D chains are further linked to generate a 2-D sheet running parallel to the (010) plane (see Figure 3b), and then an overall 3-D network (see Figure 3c), by the coeffects of interlayer π 3 3 3 π stacking between the parallel phenyl and/or pyridyl of phen in an offset fashion with the centroid-centroid and interplanar separations of 3.379-3.386 A˚ and 3.3791- 3.3862 A˚ ,40 as well as C-H 3 3 3 O interactions between the phenyl rings of phen and carboxylates of ndc (C29- H29A 3 3 3 3 O6; see Table 2)39 and C-H 3 3 3 π interactions between phen and ndc with an edge-to-face orientation (d = 2.821-3.250 A˚ ; A = 128-155 in the C-H 3 3 3 π patterns).41 {[Cd(ndc)(4bpy)0.5(H2O)2](H2O)}¥ (4). When 4bpy, a ri- gidly linear bridging co-ligand, was used instead of the chelating ligand 2bpy or phen, a 2-D layered network 4 was obtained (see Figure 4 as well as Table S4 and Figures S5-S7 in the Supporting Information). The asymmetric unit is composed of one CdII ion, one ndc ligand, half a 4bpy ligand, two H2O ligands, and one lattice H2O molecule. The coordination geometry around each CdII can be best de- scribed as a distorted octahedron defined by three carbox- ylate O atoms from different ndc ligands, two H2O ligands, and one N-atom donor from one 4bpy (see Figure 4a). For the ndc ligand, two types of coordination modes are found for the carboxylate groups, that is, μ1-η1:η0-monodentate mode for O1-C1-O2 and μ2-η1:η1-syn-anti bridging mode for O3-C12-O4 (see Scheme 1e and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). Thus, the adjacent CdII ions are connected to form a 1-D chain motif along the [100] direction with the intrachain nonbonding Cd 3 3 3 Cd separa- tions of 5.377(4) and 4.815(8) A˚ (see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The adjacent 1-D motifs are further assembled into a 2-D layered network along the (010) plane, in virtue of the bridging 4bpy ligands with the Cd 3 3 3 Cd separation of 11.725(5) A˚ (see Figure 4b). In addition, such 2-D layers are extended into an overall 3-D network (see Figure 4c) by interlayer O5-H1W 3 3 3 O2 inter- actions between the water ligands and carboxylates (see Table 2 for details). From the viewpoint of network topology, the 2-D coordi- nation layer has a (3,4)-connected (42.6)(42.63.8) pattern, in which the ndc ligand can be regarded as the 3-connected node to bridge three CdII ions and each CdII as a 4-connected node by linking to three ndc and one CdII via 4bpy (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). However, if the interlayer O5-H1W 3 3 3 O2 hydrogen bonds are also considered, the ndc ligands and CdII ions can be regarded as the 4- and 5-connected nodes, respectively. In this way, the resulting binodal (4,5)-connected 3-D hydrogen-bonded network has the Schl€afli symbol of (44.62)(44.64.82) (see Figure 4d). {[Cd(ndc)(abp)(H2O)](H2O)}¥ (5). To explore the effect of the relevant 4,40-bipyridyl-like spacers on the construction of Cd-ndc coordination networks, a semirigidly dipyridyl li- gand abp with a rich π-conjugated system was used, afford- ing a 3-D coordination framework 5 (see Figure 5). The fundamental building unit contains one CdII ion, one fully deprotonated ndc ligand, one abp ligand, one water ligand, and one lattice water molecule (see Table S5 in the Support- ing Information). The Cd1 center is located in a distorted pentagonal-dipyramidal geometry, via coordinating to one N-donor of abp and four O atoms of two ndc ligands in the Figure 3. Views of 3.

In 5, each tetradentate ndc ligand bridges two adjacent CdII ions with the μ1-η1:η1-chelating mode of carboxylate (see Scheme 1f and Figure S8 in the Supporting Information) to give rise to a 1-D zigzag chain along the [001] direction (see Figure 5b, top). Such staggered 1-D arrays are further interlinked via the abp ligands along different crystal- lographic directions, to finally produce a 3-D coordination network (see Figure 5b, bottom). Analysis of network topology provides a convenient tool in designing and understanding the complicated crystal structures such as coordination polymers or hydrogen- bonded networks.3 Such structures can usually be reduced to simple topological networks with different connectivity of the components. To further demonstrate the 3-D structure of 5, we can consider each CdII center as a nonplanar 4-con- necting node, which is linked to four equivalent nodes through two ndc and two abp spacers (see Figure 5c). As a result, an unusual uninodal 4-connected irl net with (42.63.8) topology is formed,3 instead of the familiar 4-connecting nets with the tetrahedral and/or square-planar nodes, such as diamond (or dia),43a,b CdSO4 (or cds) (65.8),43c,d NbO (64.82),43e,f pts (42.84),43g,h lvt (42.84),43i,j SrAl2 (or sra) (42.63.8),43k,l moganite (42.62.82)(4.64.8)2,43m,n and quartz dual (or “dense” 75.9).43o {[Cd(ndc)(bpp)2](H2O)3}¥ (6). A 3-D chiral coordination framework 6 was isolated, when we used a flexible 4,40- bipyridyl-like molecule bpp with a longer N,N0-donor se- paration of ca. 10 A˚ , which crystallizes in space group P212121 (see Figure 6 as well as Figures S9 and S10 in the Supporting Information). The asymmetric unit contains one CdII ion, one ndc ligand, two bpp ligands, and three lattice water molecules. Each CdII center is seven-coordi- nated in a distorted pentagonal-dipyramidal geometry, being defined by one N-donor of bpp (Cd1-N4: 2.351(8) A˚ ) and four O atoms of two ndc ligands (Cd1-O: 2.349- (6)-2.499(8) A˚ ) in the equatorial plane as well as two N atoms from the other two bpp ligands (Cd1-N1: 2.349(9) A˚ ; Cd1-N3B: 2.352(10) A˚ ) at the axial sites with the N1-Cd1-N3B angle of 176.3(4) (see Figure 5a). Similar to 5, each ndc ligand in 6 also adopts the μ1-η1:η1-chelating mode for carboxylate (see Scheme 1f and Figure S9 in the Supporting Information), and the bpp ligand serves as a head-to-end spacer. The most attractive structural feature in 6 is the chiral 3-D coordination framework with the flack parameter of 0.04(6).44 The chiral unit in 6 can be considered as a pair of right- and left-handed 21 helical chains, running perpendi- cularly along the [100] and [010] directions (see Figures 6b and S10 in the Supporting Information). The left-handed 21 helix [-Cd-ndc-]n along the a axis with a screw pitch of 10.46(9) A˚ , are decorated with the bpp ligands at two sides as arms (Figure 6b right and Figure S10 left in the Supporting Information). And the right-handed 21 helix [-Cd-bpp-]n along the b axis with a screw pitch of 12.35(9) A˚ mainly originates from the flexible and twisted configuration of the bpp ligands (Figure 6b left and Figure S10 right in the Supporting Information). As is known, helical structural motifs generally have an axial chirality45 and the extension of such helical motifs into a 3-D homochiral lattice requires the suitable homochiral discriminative interactions.46 In the reported examples for homochiral coordination architec- tures, the 1-D helical coordination arrays46a,b normally homochirally aggregate via weaker intermolecular contacts, such as π 3 3 3 π stacking,46c C-H 3 3 3 π/C-H 3 3 3 N,46d C-H 3 3 3 Cl,46e and argentophilic interactions.46f However, in this case, the alternate right- and left-handed helices are further linked by Cd1-O/N coordination bonds to afford a 3-D homochiral coordination network (see Figure 6b, mid- dle, Figure 6c, and Figure S10, middle in the Supporting Information). That is, such interactions can also be used to transmit the local chiral information into the resulting 3-D homochiral assembly. From the viewpoint of network Figure 6. Views of 6.

Structural transformation and diversification are evidently observed in the present series of mixed-ligand coordination complexes, and their structural difference can be mainly ascribed to the choice of different N-donor auxiliary co-ligands. As described above, the initial complex [Cd(ndc)]¥ (1) shows a 2-D (44.62) coordination network. It has been known that the chelating 2bpy terminal will have a great influence on structural assembly of metal- carboxylate systems, which can usually reduce the structural dimensionality of such coordination networks by occupying the metal binding sites.1f Here, when 2bpy was applied as the auxiliary co-ligand, a discrete tetranuclear complex 2 was obtained. Similarly, phen that has a larger conjugated back- bone will also terminate the metal coordination sites and result in lower-dimensional coordination arrays.1a,25f On the other hand, the bulky aromatic backbone of phen may affect the spatial arrangement of the bridging ndc ligand and facilitate the formation of π 3 3 3 π stacking and C-H 3 3 3 π interactions, which can extend the low-dimensional coordi- nation motifs into higher-dimensional supramolecular frameworks.25f As a result, when we used phen instead of 2bpy, a 1-D coordination polymer 3 that is completely different from 2 was obtained. The 4,40-bipyridyl-like brid- ging ligands with different N,N0-donor separations mod- ified by the spacers, such as 4bpy (N,N0-donor separation: ca. 7 A˚ ), abp (N,N0-donor separation: ca. 9 A˚ ), and bpp (N,N0-donor separation: ca. 10 A˚ ), have dissimilar skeleton rigidity and steric effects on the direction of unexpected coordination solids.29 In this regard, to further evaluate their roles on adjusting the Cd-ndc crystalline networks, complexes 4-6 were prepared, showing a 2-D (3,4)-con- nected (42.6)(42.63.8) layer, a 3-D uninodal network with the rare irl (42.63.8) topology, and a 3-D homochiral diamond (dia) framework, respectively. From the view- point of crystal engineering, we can temporarily con- clude that the structural discrepancy in the resulting co- ordination complexes should originate from the interven- tion of different N-donor auxiliary co-ligands even though their crystalline lattices cannot be accurately forecasted at present. Effect of the Bulky Naphthalene Skeleton of H2ndc on Structural Assembly. As typical aromatic carboxyl ligands, benzene-based dicarboxylic acids,14-16 especially benzene- 1,2-dicarboxylic acid16 (H2bdc, see Chart 1) have been widely employed to construct diverse coordination architectures. However, the rational use of their closely related naphtha- lene-based dicarboxyl analogues, such as naphthalene-2,3- dicarboxylic acid (H2ndc) with a larger π-conjugated system and the bulky aromatic skeleton, has been less explored to date.30 From the above discussion of crystal structures, it can be seen that, in comparison with H2bdc, the H2ndc ligand has two obvious characteristics: (1) the electronic nature of its extended π-conjugated system and the steric hindrance of the bulky naphthalene ring that may affect the coordination modes of carboxylate, and thus, determine the final coordi- nation arrays; (2) the extended π-conjugated system that normally results in C-H 3 3 3 π and/or π 3 3 3 π stacking inter- actions from the viewpoint of the electronic nature, along with the increased overlap of the aromatic surface areas, play an important role in forming the final supramolecular lattices, namely, extending the low-dimensional coordina- tion entities into higher-dimensional supramolecular net- works. These characteristics allow H2ndc to show different building functions comparing with its benzene-based analo- gue H2bdc. For instance, two different 2-D photolumines- cent complexes [Cd(bdc)(H2O)]¥ 16d,n,p,q and [Cd(bdc)]¥ 16m have been reported. The former exhibits a 2-D honeycomb- like network constructed from the [CdO7] single helical chains linked by corner-sharing oxygen atoms of the bdc ligands, which adopt the μ2-η1:η2-chelating/bridging and μ3- η1:η2-bridging coordination modes for the two carboxylate groups. The latter has a 2-D square grid network with seven- coordinated CdII centers as well as μ2-η1:η2-chelating/brid- ging and μ3-η2:η2-bridging/chelating binding modes for the two carboxylate groups of bdc. When H2bdc is replaced by H2ndc in this work, a new 2-D complex [Cd(ndc)]¥ (1) is formed but with the distorted octahedral six-coordinated CdII centers and the μ2-η1:η2-chelating/bridging coordina- tion mode for each carboxylate group of ndc (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Infoamation). Also, a 1-D coordination polymer {[Cd(bdc)(2bpy)(H2O)]¥, incorporating 2bpy as the auxiliary co-ligand, has been known.16h,j In contrast, the structure of 2 involving ndc and 2bpy in this work shows a distinct discrete tetranuclear motif {[Cd2- (ndc)2(2bpy)2(H2O)2](CH3OH)0.5}2. As such, we have noticed that a discrete dinuclear complex [Cd2(bdc)2(phen)4](H2O)4 16l and a 1-D species {[Cd(bdc)(phen)(H2O)]¥ 16j have been docu- mented with the six-coordinated CdII centers as well as μ1-η1:η1-chelating and μ1-η1:η0-monodentate coordination modes for carboxylates of bdc. However, when we used H2ndc to react with CdII in the presence of phen, a 1-D coordination polymer [Cd2(ndc)2(phen)2]¥ (3) was isolated with different μ2-η2:η0-monodentate-bridging and μ2-η1:η1- syn-anti bridging coordination modes for carboxylates of ndc (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). In addition, {[Cd(bdc)(4bpy)(H2O)]¥ 16o with a 2-D (4,4) network and {[Cd(Hbdc)2(4bpy)]¥ 16k with a 3-D homochiral framework have also been prepared, which both adopt μ1-η1:η0-mono- dentate coordination mode for each carboxylate group in bdc. Chart 1 4782 Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 11, 2010 Fang et al. In this context, the related CdII complex {[Cd(ndc)- (4bpy)0.5(H2O)2](H2O)}¥ (4) with ndc and 4bpy co-ligand shows a 2-D (3,4)-connected (42.6)(42.63.8) layered network with mixed μ1-η1:η0-monodentate and μ2-η1:η1-syn-anti brid- ging coordination modes for the carboxylate groups of ndc (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). That is, although the available binding sites of H2ndc and H2bdc are very similar, their coordination chemistry and the role for involving supra- molecular interactions are different that should be ascribed to the electronic nature of its extended π-conjugated system and the bulk skeleton of naphthalene of ndc. This work, therefore, offers an opportunity to make a potential comparison of the corresponding coordination complexes constructed from two structurally related naphthalene- and benzene-based dicarbox- ylatetectons.And further, from the viewpoint of liganddesign, the present finding may provide an effective method for the design and preparation of new coordination architectures, just by changing the aromatic skeletons of different polycarboxyl systems. Photoluminescence Properties. Metal-organic coordina- tion complexes constructed from d10 metal centers and conjugated organic ligands are promising candidates for hybrid photoactive materials with potential applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs),47,48 These crystalline solids usually show regulatable photoluminescent properties and high thermal stability.48 Thus, solid-state emission spectra of the as-synthesized CdII complexes 1-6 have been investigated at room temperature (see Figure S11 in the Supporting Information). Excitation of the microcrystalline samples of 1-6 at 349, 341, 358, 364, 375, and 336 nm produces the intense luminescence with the peak maxima at 371, 361, 424, 427, 416, and 361 nm, respectively. To further analyze the nature of these emission bands, the photoluminescent properties of H2ndc and auxiliary co- ligands 2bpy, phen, 4bpy, abp, and bpp have also been investigated under the same experimental conditions (see Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). By comparing the locations and profiles of their excitation/emission peaks with those of complexes 1-6, we can presume that these emissions are neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) in nature, because the CdII ion with d10 configuration is diffi- cult to oxidize or to reduce26 and should mainly be ascribed to the intraligand π f π* transitions arising from the ndc ligand, namely, ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT).48e The results are similar to those of the related CdII complexes with the naphthalene-based carboxyl ligands.24b In addition, the different emissions in 2-6 may result from the auxiliary N-donor co-ligands. In comparison with the emission peaks of free H2ndc, the enhancement and red shift of the lumines- cence emissions in 3-5 or the blue shift in 1, 2, and 6 may be due to the chelating and/or bridging effect of the deproto- nated ndc ligands, which effectively increases or decreases the rigidity and conjugation upon metal coordination, and then affects the loss of energy via a radiationless pathway of the intraligand (π f π*) excited state.48e Further, the additional peak in the range of 450-500 nm for 5 is very weak and should be ascribed to background. Generally, the greater the extent of the π-electron system (i.e., degree of conjugation), the lower the energy of the low- lying π f π* transition, which, consequently, leads to a shift of the absorption and fluorescence spectra to longer wave- lengths. Comparing the emission of benzene-1,2-dicar- boxylic acid (H2bdc) (peak maxima at 345 nm) with that of H2ndc here,16k,n it can be seen that the bathochromic shift of the maxima emission peak of H2ndc (λmax = 397 nm; λex = 368 nm) should be mainly related to the extended π-con- jugated system. As such, we noticed that the observed emissions related to a series of CdII-bdc complexes with or without the different chelating or bridging N-donor co- ligands would be probably assigned to the intraligand fluor- escent emission and/or ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT).16a,b,d,f,g,k,m,n The different emission bands of the relevant complexes (CdII-ndc vs CdII-bdc) may be due to the significant difference of their supramolecular structures with benzene- or naphthalene-based dicarboxylate ligands because the fluorescence behaviors are closely associated with the metal ions and the nature of the ligands coordinated around them.47 Thermal Stability of 1-6. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were conducted to examine the thermal stability of 1-6. As shown in Figure S13 in the Supporting Information, complex 1 remains intact until heating to 380 C, and then suffers two consecutive weight losses that end at 640 C (peaking at 430 and 514 C). Further heating to 800 C reveals no weight loss and the final solid holds a weight of 14.16% of the total sample. For 2, the TGA curve suggests the first weight loss of 4.98% in the range of 50- 230 C, corresponding to a gradual removal of methanol guests (calcd: 1.57%) and water ligands (calcd: 3.54%). The host framework starts to decompose beyond 250 C in three consecutive steps of weight loss (peaking at 278, 393, and 606 C), which does not stop until heating to 800 C. Complex 3 is thermally stable upon heating to ca. 250 C followed by three stages of weight loss peaking at 308, 342, and 669 C. The weight loss of 76.12% observed from 250 to 700 C is very close to the calculated value of 77.82%, corresponding to the exclusion of phen and ndc ligands. With regard to 4, the initial weight loss of 12.15% in the TGA curve from 30 to 75 C (peaking at 58 C) suggests the release of lattice and coordination water molecules (calcd: 11.79%). With that, the residual framework remains largely un- changed until the decomposition onsets at 240 C with three consecutive steps of weight loss, followed by a slow weight loss not ending until 800 C. The critical weight loss (17.35%) in the range of 240-280 C (peaking at 262 C) can be ascribed to the loss of 4bpy ligands (calcd: 17.02%), showing the collapse of the 2-D coordination framework. The other two peaks (388 and 529 C) in the TGA curve also reveal the weight loss processes of the residual components. The TGA trace of 5 indicates that the first weight loss occurs in the temperature range of 50-140 C (peaking at 98 C), which can be ascribed to the expulsion of lattice and coordinated water molecules (calcd: 6.60%; found: 6.86%). Then, a series of complicated weight losses occur above 140 C (peaking at 202, 258, 378, and 573 C), indicating collapse of the residual framework. Further heating to 800 C only reveals a con- tinuous and slow weight loss. As for the TGA curve of 6, the first weight loss of 7.21% appears in 70-180 C (peaking at 161 C), corresponding to the loss of lattice water molecules (calcd: 6.96%). The following three-step weight loss of ca. 79.36% in 180-600 C can be attributed to the elimination of bpp and ndc (calcd: 78.58%). The residue gradually decom- poses upon further heating until 800 C. Similar to the cases of CdII benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate (bdc) complexes,16 the volatility of coordinated or lattice water molecules from host frameworks is commonly observed at low temperatures (<200 C), which can further lead to a decomposition of Article Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 11, 2010 4783 the coordination structures. In addition, degradation of the organic components of 1-6 (see Figure S13 in the Support- ing Information) and CdII-bdc complexes16a,g,k,m,n smili- larly starts in the temperature range of 150-350 C, resulting in pyrolysis of the as-synthesized solid materials. PXRD Results. To confirm whether the crystal structures of 1-6 are truly representative of the bulk materials, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments have been carried out. The experimental and simulated PXRD patterns of the corresponding complexes are shown in Figure S14 in the Supporting Information. Although the experimental pat- terns have a few unindexed diffraction lines and some peaks are slightly broadened in comparison with those simulated from the single crystal data, it can still be considered that the bulk synthesized materials and the as-grown crystals are homogeneous for 1-6. Conclusions We have succeeded in obtaining a series of CdII coordina- tion architectures showing discrete tetranuclear motif as well as infinite 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D frameworks with a bulky naphthalene-based dicarboxylate (ndc), sometimes incorpor- ating different auxiliary N-donor co-ligands. With the excep- tion of such auxiliary chelating or bridging co-ligands, the results reveal that the naphthalene ring skeleton in ndc show- ing the extended π-conjugated system and steric bulk may play an important role in the formation of 1-6, in comparison with those based on the structurally related bdc tecton. In addition, complexes 1-6 show blue fluorescent emissions at room temperature, mainly owing to the bulk naphthalene ring of ndc. Accordingly, our present findings will further enrich the crystal engineering strategy and offer the possibility of controlling the formation of the desired network structures. Following this lead, this work will prompt us to achieve more functional crystalline solids via such a reliable synthetic route, by using the analogous bulky aromatic dicarboxyl ligands with larger π-conjugated systems, such as anthracene-2,3- dicarboxylic acid (H2adc, see Chart 1). Further efforts on this project are underway in our laboratory. Acknowledgment.
