In 1−7, an argentophilic Ag2 dimer was found to be a dominant subunit, which is stabilized by a pair of bridging carboxylate groups. Complexes 1−4 are assembled with monocarboxylates, L, and Ag(I) ions. Complex 1 exists as a discrete dimeric molecule, being stabilized by trans pairs of L and L1. Co-crystallization of discrete molecules and inﬁnite chains occur in complex 2. In 3 and 4, Ag2 dimers are linked by ligands L to furnish a double-bridged chain and a ladder-like structure, respectively. Complexes 5−7 are assembled with dicarboxylate spacers and ﬂexible L, which link Ag2 units to form a 2D slablike architecture in 5, and 3D coordination frameworks in 6 and 7. In addition, the eﬀect of the carboxylate ligands on the ligation behavior of L and supramolecular assembly of the series of compounds are discussed in detail. ■INTRODUCTION Versatile chelating and bridging ligands that have been extensively used to synthesize predesigned metal coordination frameworks and supramolecular assemblies include carboxylates,1 ﬂexible multidentate N-donor ligands,2 and oligo-α-heteroaromatic ligands.3 For the past 15 years, oligo-α-pyridylamino ligands and their derivatives have been applied in the syntheses of a series of extended metal-atom chain complexes with fascinating structures.4 In particular, chalcogenobis(N-heteroaromatic) ligands, each featuring a C(sp2)−E−C(sp2) (E = S or Se) hinge, have a wide range of biological applications,3e and thio derivatives have been shown to serve as versatile building blocks of supramolecular architectures3c,d,5 through rotation of the substituted hetero- aromatic rings about respective C(sp2)−S bonds, leading to variable bonding directions of multiple N-, and E-donor sites. Notably, the Se site in reported coordination frameworks bearing selenium-tethered heteroaromatic groups does not function as a coordination donor.6 Recently we successfully employed newly synthesized 2,6- bis(pyrazin-2-ylthio)pyrazine (L) as a conformationally ﬂexible multidentate oligo-α-heteroaromatic ligand to construct high- nuclearity Ag(I) cluster-based coordination polymers7 and silver(I)−ethynyl frameworks.8 Since coordination architectures based on a combination of L and carboxylates have not been investigated, herein, we report the synthesis and structural eluci- dation of a series of seven silver(I) complexes generated by combining L and carboxylate ligands L1−L7 (see Scheme 1): Ag2(L)2(L1)2 (1), [Ag(L)(L2)]∞(2), [Ag2(L)(L3)2]∞(3), [Ag2(L)(L4)2]∞(4), {[Ag2(L)(L5)]·4H2O}∞(5), {[Ag2(L)- (L6)]·3H2O}∞(6), and {[Ag2(L)2(L7)]·3H2O}∞(7) (L1 = triﬂuoroacetate, L2 = heptaﬂuorobutanoate, L3 = 4-cyanoben- zoate, L4 = 2-(perﬂuorophenoxy)acetate, L5 = 1,1′-biphenyl- 4,4′-dicarboxylate, L6 = 2,2′-(1,4-phenylene)diacetate and L7 = naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate). The inﬂuence of the carboxylate ligands on the ligation behavior of L and the supramolecular assemblies of the resulting compounds are discussed in detail. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials and General Methods.

Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction data of compounds 1−7 were collected on a Bruker Kappa APEX II CCD diﬀractometer operating at 50 kV and 30 mA using Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K (Table 1). The structures were solved by direct methods with SHELX-979 and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares techniques using the SHELXL-97 program10 within WINGX.11 The ordered atoms in each structure were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters, while the hydrogen atoms were placed in idealized positions and allowed to ride on their parent carbon atoms. The H atoms of O4W in 5 could not be located from Fourier maps and were thus not included in the ﬁnal reﬁnement. Selected bond lengths are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Hydrogen-bonding parameters are given in Table S2 (Supporting Information). ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Description of Crystal Structures. Complexes 1−7 all feature a common [Ag2(COO)2] dinuclear unit that is stabili- zed by argentophilic interaction and a pair of syn,syn-bridging carboxylate groups. In contrast to complexes 1−4 derived from monocarboxylates L1−L4, complexes 5−7 are assembled with dicarboxylates L5−L7, whose spacers play a dominant role in manifestation of structural diversity. Structure of Ag2(L)2(L1)2 (1). Compound 1 contains a packing of centrosymmetric Ag2(OOC-R)2L2 (R = CF3) mole- cules, each held by pairs of bridging μ2-L and μ2-η1,η1-triﬂuoro- acetate ligands, such that each Ag(I) atom exhibits a distorted square-planar N2O2-coordination geometry (Figure 1a). The Ag2 dimer is further stabilized by argentophilic interaction (Ag···Ag distance = 3.374(1) Å).12 Thus, the Ag2L2 moiety adopts a chair conﬁguration with its 4-pyrazinyl N sites bridg- ing a Ag2 dimeric unit (mode A in Scheme 2). Adjacent Ag2(L)2(L1)2 molecules are packed along the a axis through C-H···F hydrogen bonding with a F···C distance of 3.348(7) Å (F1···H11 = 2.630(5) Å) (Figure 1b). Structure of [Ag(L)(L2)]∞(2). The asymmetric unit of com- plex 2 comprises two independent [Ag2(L)2(OOC-R)2] (R = CF2CF2CF3) dinuclear moieties (Figure 2a) similar to that in 1, being stabilized by argentophilic interactions (Ag1···Ag2 = 3.035(2) Å and Ag3···Ag4 = 3.143(1) Å). However, [Ag2(L)2- (L2)2] molecular building units containing Ag1 and Ag2 generate a necklace-like inﬁnite chain through coordination bonding between Ag1 and N18B (Ag1−N18B = 2.462(8) Å). Moreover, the Ag3,Ag4-containing dinuclear molecules located on both sides of each zigzag chain attach to it by weak interac- tions of the type Ag3···N23A = 2.684(9) Å (Figure 2b),13 which are signiﬁcantly longer than the regular Ag−N coordination bonds (Ag3−N5 = 2.348(8) Å and Ag3−N7 = 2.419(6) Å). Thus, complex 2 is an unusual crystalline compound built of dinuclear molecular species, half of which are associated into inﬁnite coordination chains. Structure of [Ag2(L)(L3)2]∞(3). The asymmetric unit of 3 corresponds to its stoichiometric formula. As depicted in Figure 3a, Ag1 is three-coordinated by two O atoms from two L3, and one N atom from a ligand L in a trigonal-pyramidal coordination environment. In contrast, Ag2 adopts a AgN2O2 tetrahedral geometry, being surrounded by pairs of L and L3 ligands. In addition, Ag1 is connected to Ag2 by argentophilic interaction to form a dimer (Ag1···Ag2 = 2.863(1) Å), which is further bridged and stabilized by two μ2-η1,η1 bridging carboxylates to furnish a [Ag2(OOC-R)2] (R = 4-cyanobenzyl) moiety. Ligand L adopts linear μ3 coordination mode C with its pendant pyrazinyl rings in an anti relationship with respect to the central ring (Scheme 2). Unlike L1 and L2, L3 is a longer Table 1.

Thus, L can adopt an outstretched conformation to function in coordination mode C, unlike the chelating mode A in 1 or B in 2. Furthermore, L links dimeric silver(I) subunits to aﬀord an inﬁnite ladder- shaped, double-bridged chain in 3 (Figure 3b). As shown in Figure 3c, adjacent chains are further interconnected by Figure 1. (a) Perspective view of the dimeric Ag2(L)2(L1)2 molecule in complex 1.

Structure of [Ag2(L)(L4)2]∞(4). The asymmetric unit of 4 corresponds to its structural formula (Figure 4a). Ag1 and Ag2 are both located in a tetrahedral N2O2-coordination environ- ment. Speciﬁcally, the two N atoms connected to Ag1 are from diﬀerent L ligands, whereas the two bonded to Ag2 belong to the same chelating L. At the same time, Ag1 is linked to Ag2 by argentophilic interaction at a Ag···Ag distance of 2.934(1) Å to furnish a [Ag2(OOC-R)2] (R = perﬂuorophenoxyl) dimeric moiety, where both independent carboxylate ligands L4 adopt the same μ2-η1,η1 bridging mode. Ligand L displays a distinct μ3-η1,η1,η1,η1 chelating/bridging mode D (Scheme 2), in which the pendant pyrazinyl rings adopt a syn conﬁguration to cross- bridge two dimeric Ag(I) units like pillars to generate a ladder. Each rung of the ladder is composed of two N5-containing rings in ligands L, and each section of the sides consists of one N1-containg pyrazinyl ring (Figure 4b). These rungs and sides are further joined by Ag2 dimers to constitute the ladder. As illustrated in Figure 4c, intrachain π−π interactions are observed between C23- and N4-containing aromatic rings (centroid−centroid distance = 3.718(3) Å and dihedral angle = 15.1(2) °) to consolidate the supramolecular structure. Further- more, the chains are stacked along the c axis via interchain π−π interactions between C23-containing rings (centroid−centroid distance = 3.536(3) Å, and perpendicular distance = 3.340(2) Å). Structure of {[Ag2(L)(L5)]·4H2O}∞(5). Complex 5 features a coordination layer structure. Bidentate dicarboxylate spacer ligand L5 was introduced into the reaction system to obtain 5, the asymmetric unit of which matches its stoichiometric formula.

Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3530−3540 3534 geometry: Ag1 is surrounded by separate O atoms from two L5, plus one N and one S from diﬀerent L ligands in a AgO2NS geometry, while Ag2 has a AgO3N coordination environ- ment involving O atoms from three L5. Notably, the distance between Ag1 and Ag2 bridged by carboxylate is 2.866(1) Å, being much shorter than the characteristic argentophilic contact of 3.4 Å (Figure 5a). In 5, ligand L adopts μ3-η1,η1,η1 coordination mode E (Scheme 2), where S2, the 1-positional N6, and the 4-positional N11 of L provide binding sites to Ag(I) centers (Figure 5a). So far, only one complex derived from the silver(I) ethynediide synthon and L with the S site involved in ligation behavior has been reported.8 In addition, the two 4-positional N sites on the pendant rings of L are in an exo relationship, being diﬀerent from the endo conﬁguration found for modes A−D in 1−4 and F in 7 (Scheme 2). The terminal carboxylate groups of L5 display diﬀerent co- ordination modes, with one taking the μ2-η1,η1 bridging mode and the other adopting a μ3-η2,η1 one, linking adjacent Ag1··· Ag2 dimers to aﬀord a Ag4 aggregate (Figure 5b). The Ag4 units are further hinged and consolidated by two L ligands. Notably, in complex 5, dicarboxylate ligand L5 not only stabi- lizes the silver(I) dimer as terminal monocarboxylate ligands do Figure 4. (a) The asymmetric unit of complex 4.

Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3530−3540 3535 but also bridges Ag4 subunits along the (1,1̅,0) direction to aﬀord an inﬁnite coordination column (Figure 5b). Adjacent columns are further interconnected through Ag−S bonding, resulting in a 2D slablike structure parallel to the ab plane (Figure 5c). These slablike coordination layers are stacked along the c axis, and the solvent-accessible voids are occupied by lattice water molecules that form (H2O)8 clusters held by O-H···O hydrogen bonds (Figure 5d,e). As shown in Figure 5d, the water cluster can be regarded as a hexagon constructed by O1W, O2W, O3W, O1WF, O2WF, and O3WF, with O4WF and O4W attached to O3W and O3WF on the ﬂanks, respectively. Hydrogen atoms of O1W, O2W, and O3W were located from Fourier-diﬀerence maps. However, those of O4W could not be located, and the distance between O4W and the adjacent O3W (2.8 Å) suggests the existence of hydrogen bonding between them. Within the water cluster, O1W and O3W both act as double donors and single acceptors, O2W acts as a single donor and single acceptor, while O4W acts as a single acceptor. The Owater···Owater distances range from 2.80(1) to 2.89(1) Å, and the Owater···O distance is 2.82(1) Å, which are all close to the O···O distance in ice Ic (2.75 Å) and Ih (2.759 Å) determined at −130 and −90 °C, respectively.14 The geometric parameters of the water cluster are summarized in Table S2 (Supporting Information). Finally, the coordination layers are further connected by hydrogen bonds between water molecule O1W in the water cluster and the O3 atom from the L5 ligand (see O1W···O3D and O1WF···O3G in Figure 5d,e) to generate a supramolecular framework. Structure of {[Ag2(L)(L6)]·3H2O}∞(6). Complex 6 exhibits a 3D framework structure. The asymmetric unit consists of two Ag(I) ions, one L ligand, two L6 ligands, each located at a crystallographic inversion center, and three lattice water molecules. The carboxylate groups of both independent L6 ligands adopt the μ2-η1,η1 bridging mode. As shown in Figure 6a, both Ag1 and Ag2 are four-coordinated in a distorted tetra- hedral N2O2 environment. Ag1 is chelated by two N atoms from the same ligand L and two O atoms from two L6a ligands (for convenience, O3- and O1-containing L6 ligands are designated as L6a and L6b, respectively), while Ag2 is coordinated by N atoms from two L ligands and O atoms from two L6b ligands.

Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3530−3540 3536 Furthermore, inversion-related Ag(I) atoms form an argento- philic dimer (Ag1···Ag1A = 2.976(1) Å and Ag2···Ag2B = 2.854(1) Å). Each Ag2 dimer is consolidated by bridging L6 carboxylate groups to form a [Ag2(OOC-R-COO)2] (R = phenylene) moiety. Ligand L adopts a distinct chelating/ bridging μ3-η1,η1,η1,η1 coordination mode F (Scheme 2). Accordingly, the 4-positional N atom on the central pyrazinyl ring of L is also involved in coordination to silver(I), which does not occur in modes A−E. In this way, neighboring silver(I) dimers are extended by ligands L into a wavy coordi- nation sheet (Figure 6b). These sheets are then connected by ligands L6 and packed along the a axis to furnish a porous 3D host framework (Figure 6c), which accommodates a trimeric guest species composed of O1W, O2W, and O3W in its void space (Table S2, Supporting Information). Careful inspection shows that O2W takes the role of a double donor and single acceptor, O3W functions as a single donor and single acceptor, and O1W only acts as a double donor. This water cluster is further held together by hydrogen bonding with carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1H, O2F, and O3A in Figure 6d). Structure of {[Ag2(L)2(L7)]·6H2O}∞(7). Complex 7 reveals a 3D framework structure with ligand L7 located at a site of symmetry 1. Ag1 is in a slightly distorted AgN3O2 square- pyramidal coordination environment and is further stabilized by argentophilic interaction (Ag···Ag1A = 3.325(1) Å). Like complex 2, ligand L also adopts coordination mode B. On the Figure 6. (a) Coordination environments of silver atoms in complex 6.

Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3530−3540 3537 other hand, each carboxylate of L7 exhibits the bridging μ2- η1,η1 coordination mode (Figure 7a). As shown in Figure 7b, the centrosymmetric dinuclear subunit [Ag2(L)2(OOC- R-COO)2] (R = naphthyl) corresponds to similar moieties observed in complexes 1 and 2. Successive dinuclear sub- units are extended in a herringbone pattern into a coordi- nation layer on the bc plane via Ag−N bonds between Ag1 centers and N5 atoms of L. Such 2D layers are then further linked by the bidentate spacers of L7 ligands along the a axis to achieve a 3D coordination framework (Figure 7c). Water molecules O1W, O2W, and O3W are accommodated inside the channels of the host framework (Figure 7c). O2W and O3W partake in hydrogen-bonding interactions to form a zigzag water chain that is connected to proximate carboxylate groups either directly by O2W-H···O2 or indirectly through O1W via O1W-H···O1 and O3W-H···O2W linkages (Figure 7d). Thus, O2W and O3W each functions as a double donor and single acceptor, while O1W acts as a single donor and single acceptor, to construct and stabilize the guest water chain (Table S2, Supporting Information). Structural Comparison of Complexes 1−7 and Inﬂuence of Carboxylate Ligands on Assembly of Supramolecular Networks. In this work, the ﬂexible ligand L and a series of selected carboxylates L1−L7 were used to assemble silver(I) coordination networks. As described above, the dinuclear [Ag2(OOC-R)2] moiety stabilized by argento- philic interaction and a pair of μ2-η1,η1 bridging carboxylates functions as a common structure-building unit in the generation of complexes 1−7. Monocarboxylates L1−L4 only stabilize the Ag2 dimers in bridging modes, and the steric bulk of the R groups in 1−4 plays an important role in aﬀecting the coordination modes of L as well as the resulting supramolecular architectures. Since L1 is the smallest μ2-η1,η1 bridging carboxylate used in this work, there is suﬃcient room for two terminal ligands to coordinate to the Ag2 dimer wherein each Ag(I) atom adopts the square-planar N2O2-coordination set, but not for accommodation of additional ligands; hence, a discrete dinuclear molecule is formed in crystalline complex 1. In contrast, L2 has a longer tail than L1 (−CF2CF2CF3 versus −CF3), and the higher steric hindrance accounts for co-crystallization of a di- meric species and formation of a coordination chain in complex 2.

Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3530−3540 3538 Moreover, diﬀering from complex 1, one Ag(I) atom (Ag1) in the Ag2 dimer of 2 is in a square-pyramidal N3O2 environment with its apex occupied by a N site from an adjacent ligand L. The eﬀect of the steric hindrance of carboxylate ligands on complex struc- tures is also supported by comparing 3 and 4. Unlike L1 and L2, L3 and L4 possess very large R groups. Furthermore, the perﬂuorophenoxyl group of L4 is more ﬂexible in comparison to the 4-cyanobenzyl moiety of L3. Although similar ladder-shaped double chains were observed in their respective compounds 3 and 4, only one type of π−π interaction exists between the phenyl rings of L3 on adjacent chains in 3, whereas both inner- and interchain π−π interactions are found in 4. In addition, the Ag(I) atoms show diﬀerent coordination modes in 3 and 4. In 4, each Ag(I) atom is surrounded by a tetrahedral N2O2-coordination set. Nevertheless, in 3, the Ag1 atom possesses a trigonal-pyramidal NO2-coordination sphere, and the Ag2 atom exhibits tetrahedral N2O2-coordination geometry. When dicarboxylate ligands L5−L7 were introduced into the reaction system of complexes 5−7, 2D or 3D structures were obtained. In contrast to monocarboxylates L1−L4, the dicarboxylate ligands L5−L7 in 5−7 not only stabilize the [Ag2(OOC-R)2] moieties but also extend such Ag2 dimers into higher dimensions. L5 contains a biphenyl spacer that separates the carboxylate groups by about 7.1 Å, which is shortened to 4.9 Å for the naphthyl spacer. Moreover, the two carboxylate groups of L5 are collinear, while those of L7 show a vertical distance of approximately 1.2 Å between the two ligation directions (Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information). As a result, the Ag2 dimers in 5 are linked by ligands L through Ag− S bonds to form chains, which are further extended by L5 into a coordination layer. However, L7 ligands link the layers composed of L and Ag2 dimeric units to give a 3D framework in 7. Besides, the two independent Ag(I) atoms in 5 are both four-coordinated in tetrahedral NO3 and NO2S environments, respectively, whereas each Ag(I) atom in 7 adopts the square- pyramidal N3O2-coordination set. On the other hand, L6 con- taining the 1,4-phenylene spacer has higher ﬂexibility relative to L5 and L7. Accordingly, L6 ligands bridge the wavy sheets constructed by L and Ag2 dimers, yielding a 3D framework in 6. It is interesting to note that the multidentate ligand L bridges Ag2 dimeric unit in six ﬂexible coordination modes A−F in 1−7. The contingent η1-N bonding mode or the μ2-η1,η1 bridging fashion of each pendent pyrazinyl ring of the L ligand cooperates with its S donor and/or N atom on the center ring to achieve the distinct ligation modes. In modes A, B, D, and F, the pendant rings of L are all in an anti relationship with respect to the central ring, and the 4-positional N sites on the two pendant pyrazinyl rings bear an endo relationship to each other. In contrast, the 4-positional N sites of the pendant rings of L in mode E are in an exo relationship, despite the anti con- formation maintained by the pendant rings. In modes A, B, D, E, or F, each ligand L displays a forcipate conﬁguration owing to the anti conformation of the pendant rings. However, in mode C, the two pendant rings of L adopt a unique linear con- ﬁguration in a syn relationship with respect to the central ring. From the above description, it can be seen that the diﬀerent coordination modes A−F of L are correlated to structural variation of the coexisting carboxylate ligands L1−L7. ■CONCLUSION Seven Ag(I) complexes containing a ﬂexible multidentate oligo- pyrazinyl ligand L and a series of selected mono- and dicarboxylates were synthesized and structurally characterized. In complexes 1−7, the ﬂexible L ligand exhibits six distinguishable ligation modes. The dimeric molecule and 1D−3D coordination networks found in these compounds suggest that structural modiﬁcation of the carboxylate ligands, i.e., variation of the terminal R group of the monocarboxylates or the spacer of the dicarboxylates, has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the ligation behavior of L and the crystal structures of the resulting mixed-ligand complexes. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information X-ray crystallographic data, selected bond lengths for complexes 1−7, and hydrogen-bonding parameters for complexes 5−7, as well as an additional drawing.
