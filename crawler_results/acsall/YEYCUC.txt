Pore Surface Engineering with Controlled Loadings of Func- tional Groups via Click Chemistry in Highly Stable Metal- Organic Frameworks Hai-Long Jiang, Dawei Feng, Tian-Fu Liu, Jian-Rong Li, and Hong-Cai Zhou* Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, PO Box 30012, College Station, Texas 77842, USA Supporting Information Placeholder ABSTRACT: Reactions of ZrCl4 and single or mixed linear di- carboxylic acids bearing methyl or azide groups lead to highly stable isoreticular metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with con- tent-tunable, accessible, reactive azide groups inside the large pores. These Zr-based MOFs offer an ideal platform for pore sur- face engineering of anchoring various functional groups with controlled loadings onto pore walls via click reaction, endowing MOFs with tailor-made interfaces. Significantly, the framework and crystallinity of functionalized MOFs are well retained, and the engineered pore surfaces have been demonstrated to be readily accessible, thus bringing more opportunities for powerful and broad applications of MOFs. As highly ordered porous materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted great interest in the last twenty years due to their crystalline nature, pore tunability and structural diversity, as well as numerous potential applications such as gas stor- age/separation, catalysis, sensing and drug delivery.1-5 Permanent porosity and chemical environment of the internal surface of MOFs are crucial for such applications. However, pore surface modification with desired functional groups in well-defined MOFs remains a significant challenge. Currently, the modification of MOF pore surfaces is mostly based on the pre-designed ligand with a specific functional group.6 This approach is somewhat limited owing to the cumbersome multistep process of ligand synthesis and the often unpredictable coordination between reac- tive functional groups (such as, -OH, -COOH, N-donating groups, etc.) and metal centers during the MOF assembly process. Moreo- ver, it is generally difficult to obtain MOFs with long and/or large groups appended on the pore walls by direct solvothermal reac- tions. Therefore, the development of a general strategy for sys- tematic pore surface engineering of MOF pore walls is impera- tive, which would endow MOFs with a tailor-made internal sur- face to meet specific application requirements. Postsynthetic modification (PSM) represents a powerful tool to anchor functional groups onto MOFs. For instance, Cohen and coworkers have employed MOFs bearing -NH2 groups as plat- forms to graft various functional groups such as aldehydes, isocy- anates, and anhydrides.7 Recently, Sharpless click chemistry has also been demonstrated to be an alternative route to enrich the chemical diversity of MOFs.8-10 Sada and coworkers have em- ployed a Zn-based MOF bearing azide groups for PSM applying the click chemistry, although the MOF dissolves when soaking in a solution with “reactive” molecules, such as reactants bearing an amine or carboxylic acid group, which significantly limits the utility of the approach.9 Hupp and Nguyen groups, Farrusseng and coworkers have also applied click reactions in PSM of MOFs, where very careful deprotection of acetylene group or transfor- mation of amine to azide group is a necessary step prior to a click reaction.10 Multiple steps in PSM often cause partial or complete framework collapse, especially when the MOF is not robust. In addition, grafting functional groups with controlled loadings in MOFs has not yet been achieved. Herein we report the preparation of highly stable isoreticular Zr-based MOFs with accessible, reac- tive azide groups in large pores, which enable the MOFs to un- dergo a quantitative click reaction with alkynes to form triazole- linked groups on the pore wall surfaces. Significantly, our syn- thetic route allows an accurate control of the loading of azide groups on the internal surface of the MOF for the first time. The highly stable Zr-based MOFs offer an ideal platform for pore surface engineering. A variety of functional groups can be an- chored onto pore walls in MOFs with precise control over the loading, density, and functionalities. Figure 1. (a) View of the structure of PCN-56 as a representative, bearing two methyl groups in each TPDC-derived linker. Accord- ingly, four methyl, two methyl azide, and four methyl azide groups are involved in each organic linker, respectively for PCN- 57, PCN-58 and PCN-59. Inset: the Zr6 cluster. (b) Tetrahedral and (c) octahedral cages comprised Zr6 clusters and organic link- ers in PCN-56. The cavities are highlighted with green spheres. To design an azide-appended MOF material with large enough cavities whose openings can be fully accessed by various mole- cules with alkyne group for click reaction, we designed four elon- gated linear dicarboxylic acids with three benzene rings in each, 2',5'-dimethyl-terphenyl-4,4''-dicarboxylic acid (TPDC-2CH3) and Page 1 of 5 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 2',3',5',6'-tetramethyl-terphenyl-4,4''-dicarboxylic acid (TPDC- 4CH3), as well as their corresponding azide derivatives (TPDC- 2CH2N3 and TPDC-4CH2N3), as organic linkers (Supporting In- formation, Section 2). To ensure the structural integrity during click reaction, we aimed to construct Zr-based MOFs, which are well-known for their superior stability to the common Zn/Cu- centered MOFs.11 It is especially difficult to obtain single crystals of Zr-based MOFs due to the inert coordination bonds between Zr4+ cations and carboxylate anions, making ligand exchange reactions extremely slow, which is unfavorable for defects repair during crystal growth.11 To overcome this difficulty, modulated synthetic strategy was adopted and benzoic acid was introduced to the synthetic system.11c To our delight, octahedron-shaped crys- tals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction studies have been obtained from a reaction mixture containing zirconium(IV) chlo- ride, the elongated organic linkers, benzoic acid, and DMF, which was allowed to stay at 100 ºC in an oven for 2 days (or 120 ºC for 12-18 h) (Supporting Information, Section 3 and Figure S40).12 Four MOFs, Zr3O2(OH)2(TPDC-R)3 (R = -2CH3, PCN-56; -4CH3, PCN-57; -2CH2N3, PCN-58; -4CH2N3, PCN-59. PCN represents porous coordination networks), have been confirmed to possess isoreticular structures, which are similar to the UiO type struc- tures, based on single crystal X-ray structural and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses (Supporting Information, Sections 4 and 5).11a In the absence of benzoic acid, these MOFs can also be obtained but only in fine powders, revealing the vital role of ben- zoic acid for the growth of crystals (Figure S45). Characteristic infrared (IR) band of azide group (at ~2100 cm-1) is absent for PCN-56 and -57 whereas it is stronger for PCN-59 than that for PCN-58, consistent with the suggested structures. Moreover, di- gested PCN-58 and -59 crystals in DMSO afford almost the same 1H NMR spectra as those of the corresponding organic linkers, further demonstrating the intactness of ligand in the MOFs (Fig- ure S25). 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0 200 400 600 800 1000 (d) (c) (b) (a) Relative Pressure (P/P0) Vads (cm 3/g, STP) Figure 2.

The BET surface areas are 3741, 2572, 2185 and 1279 m2/g, respectively for PCN-56 to -59, which are comparable to calculated values (3317, 2416, 2131 and 1168 m2/g, respectively for PCN-56 to -59). All MOFs crystallize in the Fm-3m space group and the unique Zr atom, in a square-antiprismatic coordination environment, is coordinated by eight oxygen atoms from four carboxylates and four µ3-O and µ3-OH groups. Six Zr atoms are interconnected by O atoms to form a Zr6O4(OH)4 octahdedral core, the triangular faces of which are alternatively capped by µ3-O and µ3-OH groups (Figure 1a, inset). All of the polyhedron edges are bridged by carboxylates from the ligands to afford a Zr6O4(OH)4(CO2)12 clus- ter. Each cluster is connected by twelve linear ligands and each linear ligand links two clusters giving rise to a three-dimensional (3D) network with two types of polyhedral cages (Figure 1a). One is tetrahedral comprising three Zr6 clusters and six ligands with a cavity diameter of ~1.1 nm (Figure 1b), the other is octahedral with a cavity diameter of ~2.2 nm surrounded by six Zr6 clusters and twelve ligands (Figure 1c).

Schematic illustration for the general strategy of pore surface engineering of MOFs with precise control over the com- position, density and functionalities by two steps in current syn- thetic system: 1) introducing azide group with a desired loading into the MOF (any value from 0 to 100%) by simply changing the molar ratio of methyl- and azide-appended ligands only; 2) vari- ous functional groups are grafted onto the pore walls of MOFs via click reaction between azide and alkyne groups in quantitative yield. The green spheres represent Zr6 clusters. With strong bonds between the Zr4+ cation and the O atoms thanks largely to the high charge density (Z/r) and the consequen- tial bond polarization, all these MOFs exhibit exceptional robust- ness. Thermal gravimetric analyses indicate that PCN-58 and -59 with methyl groups are stable up to 350-400 ºC, while frame- works of PCN-58 and -59 bearing azide group remain intact over 200 ºC, after which the decomposition of the azide groups triggers the collapse of the whole framework. Importantly, chemical sta- bility examinations reveal that these MOFs not only survive water treatment but also remain intact in dilute acid (pH = 2 solution with HCl) and base (pH = 11 solution with NaOH) for some time (Supporting Information, Section 12). Given the microporosity and robustness, all of the MOFs dis- play typical type-I gas sorption isotherms with a range of surface areas, in which PCN-56 presents BET surface area as high as 3741 m2/g (Figure 2). Although PCN-58 and -59 have decreased surface areas due to the occupied pores by azide groups, the intro- duction of azide group improves the adsorption enthalpy of CO2 (20, 22, 25 and 33 kJ/mol respectively for PCN-56 to -59) and effectively enhances CO2 capture performance because of the polarity of azide groups. The loading of azide groups on the pore walls can be accurately tuned by varying the ratio of ligands with and without azide groups during the MOF synthesis. Based on the current study and literature reports, it is evident that appending azide groups to the linker does not change the final MOF structure.6b,13 Hence, it is reasonable to assume that pre-adjusting the molar ratio of TPDC- CH3 : TPDC-CH2N3 will allow the control of azide loading in the resultant MOFs. To test this hypothesis, MOFs with 25% and 75% -N3 loadings have been obtained by employing 1:1 of TPDC- 2CH3 and TPDC-2CH2N3, and 1:1 of TPDC-2CH2N3 and TPDC- 4CH2N3 ligands, respectively (Figure 3). These MOFs show PXRD patterns similar to those of PCN-56 to -59, indicating the retention of the framework structure. They also have similar IR features but the intensity and peak area of the azide absorption band at ~2100 cm-1 almost linearly increase as the azide loading become higher (Figure 4), together with elemental analysis re- sults, further demonstrating the consistency between theoretical Page 2 of 5 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 and actual contents of azide groups in MOFs (Supporting Infor- mation, Section 11). This remarkable synthetic strategy can be further extended to the synthesis of other isoreticular MOFs with any azide loadings between 0 and 100% under similar reaction conditions by simply adjusting the ligand ratio. Most importantly, if coupled with postsynthetic click reaction such a synthetic strat- egy of MOF functionalization via co-assembly with mixed ligands provides a universal pathway toward MOFs with desired internal surface properties, which are vital for their applications. Figure 4. IR spectra of Zr-MOFs with (a) 0% N3 (PCN-56), (b) 25% N3, (c) 50% N3 (PCN-58), (d) 75% N3, and (e) 100% N3 (PCN-59). The characteristic IR band (highlighted with light pur- ple background) for azide group is at ~2100 cm-1. The intensity of this band is proportional to the azide loading of each MOF. The Zr-MOFs with various azide loadings (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were allowed to react with propargyl alcohol in the pres- ence of CuI as a catalyst at 60 ºC in DMF. After the reaction was terminated, the products were isolated by centrifugation and washed with acetone to afford products in quantitative yields. It was demonstrated that very few Cu species (< 2 wt%) from the CuI catalyst remained in the product (Supporting Information, Section 14), similar to the previous report.14 PXRD studies con- firmed the retention of the framework integrity and the crystallini- ty of the resultant Zr-MOFs, which are now anchored by various loadings of hydroxyl groups (Supporting Information, Section 13). As the direct evidence of a complete click reaction, the char- acteristic IR band for the azide group disappeared completely (Supporting Information, Sections 8 and 10). Given that various functional groups inside the pores will en- dow MOFs with distinct and novel properties, it is highly desira- ble to introduce a variety of functional groups into MOFs by postsynthetic click reaction. Bearing this in mind, we further in- vestigated click reactions of PCN-58 and -59 with other alkynes involving various groups, such as propargyl acetate, methyl pro- piolate, propargylamine, phenylacetylene, and propiolic acid. Under reaction conditions similar to those for propargyl alcohol, various functional groups have been successfully anchored onto the MOF pore walls via a triazole linkage by click reaction. Here- in, the positions and loadings of the functional groups are identi- cal to those of the azide-appended MOF precursors. The identity of the functionalized MOFs is validated by PXRD and IR charac- terizations. To further verify the proposed products via click reac- tion, we investigated the 1H NMR spectra of the digested solu- tions for all PCN-58-derived products; the results illustrated that the corresponding triazole derivatives were formed and almost no starting material was observed (Supporting Information, Section 8). Based on the above studies, the coupled strategy of postsyn- thetic click reaction and MOF functionalization through co- assembly with mixed ligands may be general. It will allow us to anchor almost any desired functional groups with precisely con- trolled loadings onto pore walls in MOFs, thus to realize more potential applications. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 PCN-59 (with 100%N3) -COOH-anchored PCN-58 benzene-anchored PCN-58 amine-anchored PCN-58 ester-anchored PCN-58 acetyl-anchored PCN-58 OH-anchored PCN-59 OH-anchored 75%N3-MOF OH-anchored PCN-58 OH-anchored 25%N3-MOF PCN-58 (with 50%N3) PCN-57 Normalized Selectivity of CO2 over N2 PCN-56 Figure 5. Normalized CO2 adsorption selectivity over N2 (ob- tained from CO2 sorption amount (1 atm and 273 K for red bars; 1 atom and 296 K for blue bars) divided by N2 sorption amount at 1 atm and 77 K) for three sets of samples (Zr-MOFs with various loadings of azide group, black marks; hydroxyl group anchored onto Zr-MOFs with various loadings of azide group, green marks; and diverse functional group anchored onto PCN-58, blue marks). Upon the introduction of diverse functional groups that may have different affinities to specific gas molecules, the selective sorption capability of the resultant MOFs can be tuned. As a proof-of-concept study, we focused on the selective sorption of CO2 over N2, which is critical for carbon capture from air or flue gas stream. Compared to the MOF precursors, all functionalized MOFs exhibit moderate BET surface area (400-1000 m2/g for PCN-58-derived products and 200-450 m2/g for PCN-59 derived products) after click reaction (Table 1), indicative of space filling by the functional groups introduced. Their N2 uptake at 273 K is almost undetectable, while they can adsorb significant amount of CO2 at 273 or 296 K and 1 atm (Supporting Information, Sections 8 and 10). As shown in Figure 5, it is evident that the introduction of azide groups increases the selectivity of CO2 over N2 (vide supra). Different loadings of azide groups in the MOF enable us to anchor the corresponding amounts of hydroxyl group onto the pore walls. Overall, the selectivity of CO2 over N2 is also propor- tional to the loadings of the hydroxyl groups. In addition, various functional groups embedded into PCN-58 result in different selec- tivity of CO2 over N2, in which amine is the functional group that shows the highest selectivity due to the presence of not only po- larity interaction but also “acid-base” reaction between alkyla- mine and CO2 molecules, which is in agreement with previous reports.15 In summary, preliminary results have revealed that pore surface engineering of MOFs with diverse groups and controlled loading significantly affect their gas sorption selectivity.

In conclusion, reactions of ZrCl4 and single or mixed linear lig- ands bearing methyl or azide groups lead to highly stable isoretic- ular Zr-MOFs with tunable loadings of azide group inside the pores. For the first time, the system offers an ideal platform for facile pore surface engineering by introducing various functional groups with controlled loadings via click reaction. Remarkably, the resultant click products have been demonstrated to possess well-retained framework and accessible functionalized pores. This work has enabled a general approach for introducing diverse func- tional groups, especially large and/or reactive groups, into MOF pores that otherwise could not be directly synthesized by conven- tional solvothermal reactions. The tailored pore surface with the control of both type and density of functional groups in MOFs will extend their functionalities further toward broader applica- tions.

Syntheses of PCN-56, -57, -58 and -59. ZrCl4 (24 mg) and TPDC derivative dicarboxylic acid ligand (30 or 56 mg) with or without benzoic acid (240 mg) were ultrasonically dissolved in DMF (3.0 mL) and charged into 100 ºC or 120 ºC oven for 48 h or 16 h, respectively. In the presence of benzoic acid, single crystals in octahedron shape (colorless for PCN-56 and -57; light-yellow for PCN-58; light purplish red for PCN-59) were harvested with yield of ~35 mg suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction and further characterizations as well as click reactions. In the absence of benzoic acid, no single crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction but higher-yield fine powders with diffraction profiles identified to be PCN-56 to -59 can be obtained. Section 4. X-ray Crystallography Single crystal X-ray data of PCN-56, -57, -58 and -59 were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex diffractometer equipped with a low temperature device and a fine-focus sealed-tube X-ray source (Mo-Kα radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å, graphite monochromated). The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 with anisotropic displacement using the SHELXTL software package.1 Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters during the final cycles expect for C8 atom in PCN-56 and C8, N1, N2, N3 atoms in PCN-58. Hydrogen atoms on carbon were calculated in ideal positions with isotropic displacement parameters. In these structures, free solvent molecules were highly disordered, and attempts to locate and refine the solvent peaks were unsuccessful. Contributions to scattering due to these solvent molecules were removed using the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON and the structures were then refined again using the data generated. The contents of the solvent region are not represented in the unit cell contents in the crystal data. The carbon atoms of the benzene rings, especially methyl and azide groups, have large anisotropic displacement parameters perpendicular to their bonds, which could be due to the high symmetry and strongly disorder of them in the large pores. Crystallographic data and structural refinements for PCN-56 to -58 are summarized in Table S1. S15 Table S1. Crystal data and structure refinements for PCN-56 to -58.

Disordered atom is shown in one position only for clarity. S18 Section 6. Sample Activation Prior to Gas Sorption Experiments. Before gas adsorption measurements, PCN-56 to -59, and 25% and 75% N3-MOF samples were stirred in heated DMF overnight to remove unreacted starting materials and trapped benzoic acid, and the extract was decanted. Fresh dichloromethane was subsequently added, and the sample was allowed to stay for 2-3 days to exchange and remove the nonvolatile solvate (DMF). During this period, dichloromethane was freshly exchanged each day. After the removal of dichloromethane by decanting, the sample was activated by drying for some time, then was dried again by using the ‘outgas’ function of the surface area analyzer for 12 h at 160 ºC for PCN-56 and -57, and at 65 ºC for PCN-58 and -59. For the click reaction products from PCN-58, 25% and 75%N3-MOF, all samples were washed by acetone and soaked in acetone for 2-10 hours, subsequently evacuated at 40 ºC for 3 h before adsorption/desorption measurement; while for reaction products from PCN-59, the samples were washed by acetone and soaked in acetone for 10-20 hours, subsequently evacuated at 60 ºC for 12 h prior to the adsorption/desorption measurement. Section 7. Theoretical Surface Area Calculations. Theoretical surface area calculations were performed with poreblazer_v1.2.2 Positions of framework atoms were taken from crystallography (PCN-59 was built with additional -CH2N3 groups based on the structure of PCN-58) and held fixed throughout the simulations. Potential minimum probe was employed in the calculation. S19 Section 8. Click Reactions Between PCN-58 / -59 and Alkynes.

To evaluate the actual contents of azide group in different MOFs, elemental analyses have been performed. In Figure 27a, it is obvious that the nitrogen contents gradually increase along with more azide group introduced into the MOFs. In addition, characteristic IR peak area for azide group in MOFs has also been estimated. The relative peak area of azide group almost increases linearly upon introducing more azide groups (Figure S27b), further demonstrating the consistency between theoretical/expected and actual contents of azide group in MOFs. 1 2 3 4 0 10 20 30 40 50 100%N3-MOF 75%N3-MOF 50%N3-MOF Carbon Hydrogen Nitrogen Percentage (%) 25%N3-MOF 25 50 75 100 0 1500 3000 4500 6000 Relative Peak Area for Azide group (a. u.)

Stability Examination for MOFs Soaked in Aqueous, Acidic as well as Basic Solutions. For MOF chemical stability examination, 20-30 mg solid sample soaked in 2 mL H2O/acidic/basic solution for a certain time. The sample was then filtered, washed with acetone and dried for further characterizations. Representative SEM images for soaked samples in H2O/acidic/basic solution have similar particle sizes and morphologies to those of pristine MOFs, revealing the retained microstructures. Powder XRD studies show all these MOFs have quite good stability, in which the MOFs bearing methyl groups have better stability than those with longer azide groups. Figure S28.

S47 Section 14. Evaluation of Cu Contents in Click Products. To evaluate the Cu contents in click products, we examined the representative reaction products of propargyl alcohol clicked with PCN-58 and -59. Semi-quantitative determination of Cu and Zr contents obtained by XPS spectra show that Cu contents are 1.07 and 1.82 wt%, respectively for PCN-58 and -59 derived products. To obtain the Cu(II) information, magnetic measurements were performed. The dc magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out in an applied field of 1000 Oe over the temperature range of 300-1.8 K. Magnetization data were measured at 1.8 K with the magnetic field varying from 0 to 70 kOe. The data were corrected for diamagnetic contributions calculated from the Pascal constants.3 Results show the presence of Cu(II) in PCN- 58 derived product while in the absence of Cu(II) in PCN-59 derived product, which reveals that the Cu(II) contents are not necessarily existent and could be affected by the washing for the reaction product. 970 960 950 940 930 Intensity (a.u.)
