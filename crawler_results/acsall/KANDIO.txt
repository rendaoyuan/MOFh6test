We have prepared a zinc paddle-wheel- based two-fold interpenetrated PCP, {[Zn2(tp)2(L2)] 3 2.5DMF 30.5water}n (2a, H2tp = terephthanlic acid; L2 = 2,3-diﬂuoro-1,4-bis(4- pyridyl)benzene), showing dynamic structural transformations upon the removal and rebinding of guest molecules. The X-ray structures atdiﬀerent degrees ofdesolvationindicate the highly ﬂexible natureoftheframework. The framework deformations involveslippage of the layers and movement of the two interpenetrated frameworks with respect to each other. Interestingly, the coordination geometry of a zinc paddle-wheel unit (one of the popular SBUs) is considerably changedby bond breaking between zinc and oxygen atoms during the drying process. Two zinc atoms in the dried form 2d reside in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Compound 2d has no void volume and favors the uptake of O2 over Ar and N2 at 77 K. The O2 and Ar adsorption isotherms of 2d show gate-opening-type adsorption behaviors corroborating the structure determination. The CO2 adsorption isotherm at 195 K exhibits multiple steps originating from the ﬂexibility of theframework.Thestructuraltransformationsofthezincclustersin theframeworkuponsorptionofguestmoleculesarealsocharacterized by Raman spectroscopy in which the characteristic bands corresponding to νsym(COO) vibration were used. ’INTRODUCTION Gas storage has become an industrial, economic, and environ- mental priority.1,2 The last two decades have therefore witnessed dramatic eﬀorts in the search for more eﬃcient and adaptable solid gas adsorbents. Porous coordination polymers (PCPs) or Metal organic frameworks (MOFs), where properties of metal ions and functional organic ligands can be combined almost at will, are imposing themselves as a serious alternative to conven- tional zeolites and activated carbons.318 Because adsorption properties are primarily bound to structure, the control over structure, which is achieved by synthesis, is crucial.1925 From the synthetic point of view, secondary building units (SBUs)26 designed to produce directional polyatomic metal clusters have much advantage for the rational design of PCPs compared to mononuclear metal centers. On the other hand, from a ﬂexible viewpoint, SBUs are usually limited to providing soft poro- sity19,2736 because each metal atom is mutually interconnected via small number of atoms in the SBU, which interferes in dyna- mic change of coordination geometry.35 By soft porosity, we refer to sorption proﬁles generating features that reside outside the classical sorption classiﬁcation,37 such as large hysteretic sorption,19,27 stepwise uptake,19,28,29,36 and gate-opening pheno- mena30,31 among others. These properties come from structural ﬂexibility, which is strongly related to guest-dependent phenomena. In this work, we focus on making porous materials presenting the properties of soft porosity by using a synthesis scheme inspired from the SBU approach. To achieve this goal, ﬂexibility must originate from the SBUs, i.e. the steric/chemical environment of the metal clusters must be tuned, so that SBUs can undergo multiple reversible metalligand bond-breaking events to achieve soft porosity. We aim at creating soft SBUs that can regenerate. While the overall connectivity of the framework is maintained upon the reversible transformation of the SBU, the pore size, shape and volume are changed, showing soft porosity without degrading the stability of the material. It has been reported that the zinc paddle-wheel, known as a popular SBU, can twist in jungle-gym-type compounds, where square grid carboxylate sheets are pillared by pyridyl ligands, however without any drastic bond rearrangement in the SBU.38,39 Seen as a drawback, most studies aim at stiﬀening the SBU.4042 In this work, unlike any other, we aimed at morphing the zinc paddle-wheel into a soft SBU with regenerative proper- ties. We found that pillaring by slim and long axial ligands (L1 = 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)benzene; L2 = 2,3-diﬂuoro-1,4-bis(4-pyri- dyl)benzene, Scheme 1) can allow reversible metalligand Received: March 2, 2011 9006 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja201484s |J.

This has profound consequences on sorption properties. A thorough structural characterization con- ducted by single X-ray diﬀraction and in situ gas pressure- controlled powder X-ray diﬀraction and Raman spectroscopy is provided. ’RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization of 1a and 1b. We first chose to synthesize a compound with the pillar L1. Despite being successful in the synthesis of the compound and its crystal structure determination (1a, Figure 1a), its activated form (1b) while highly crystalline could not be characterized by single- crystal X-ray diffraction. In the view of the powder X-ray diffrac- tion (PXRD) profiles, 1a and 1b could be entirely different phases (Figure 2) indicating that we might be successful in the obtention of a large distortion of the paddle-wheel. We pro- ceeded to the thermogravimetric (TG) characterization and the measurement of sorption properties (Figures 3 and 4). The sorption for CO2 shows an interesting multistep profile; however being deprived of the structure for 1b, this study could not proceed any further. Compound 1a and 1b will be re-examined later in this paper. Synthesis, Characterization, and Structural Transforma- tions of 2a. We therefore moved on to an isostructural com- pound with another pillar L2, for which we could obtain the structure of the activated form. It has been reported that fluorous MOFs can show enhanced stability.43 The TG curve of the as- Scheme 1. L1 and L2 Figure 1. Crystal structures of (a) 1a and (b) 2a.

Soc. 2011, 133, 9005–9013 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE synthesized 2a indicates the release of guest molecules up to 110 C with a weight loss of 21.7% (calcd 22.0%) under an inert atmosphere (Figure 5). At 385 C, the compound starts to break down being indicative of high thermal stability for this class of compounds. The TG curve of 2d after handling in air shows a 2.2% weight loss (Figure 5 inset), which is equivalent to one water molecule per formula unit (calcd 2.4%). The single-crystal X-ray structure determination of 2a and 2d shows two-fold interpenetrated 3D frameworks with the formula {[Zn2(tp)2(L2)] 32.5DMF30.5water}n and [Zn2(tp)2- (L2)]n, respectively (Figures 1 and 6). While the triclinic P1 space group and overall connectivity of the framework is preserved sub- sequently to the complete evacuation of the guests, two major stru- ctural changes of a diﬀerent nature occur to lead to 2d. First, the coordination environment of the zinc atoms is changed. In 2a, the zinc ions are square pyramidal and arranged in the conventional paddle-wheel through bridged carboxylates. In stark contrast, in 2d the zinc ions have become tetrahedral with one carboxylate out of twobeingmonodentate;thepaddle-wheelistransformed(Figure6). Thedistancebetweenzincandoxygenatomsvariesfrom2.043(5) to 5.164 (14) Å for the cleaved bond; this is much larger than the sum of van der Waals radii (2.91 Å) (Figure 6 and Table 1). Hereafter, we call this conﬁguration “open”. Moreover, the open paddle-wheel provides an active metal site (Figure 6). The change in coordination mode of the carboxylate moieties presents characteristic Raman bands. The spectrum of 2a shows double bands at around 1500 cm1 and 1430 cm1 corresponding to νsym(COO) vibra- tions of the normal zinc paddle-wheel, while a distinct single band at 1432 cm1 is observed for 2d (Figure 7). Second, as previously described for ﬂexible two-fold interpenetrated pillared compounds, drastic reductions in cell volume (2070 to 1492 Å3, 28%) and length of the c-axis (18.52 to 14.99 Å, 19%) can be observed from 2a to 2d (Table S1). These changes cause the single frameworks to move closer to each other (Figure S1). The structure of 2d is nonporous (void volume determined using PLATON48 is 6.5%). Because the amplitudeoftheglobalvariationsinthecrystalstructuresissolarge,it was anticipated that compound 2a would go through several inter- mediate desolvated states. To identify temperature transition thresholds, a variable temperature PXRD experiment of a bulk sample of 2a from room temperature to 400 K was carried out (Figure 8). The variation of Figure 3.

Soc. 2011, 133, 9005–9013 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE PXRD patterns showed that the structural transformations were gradual with no clear transition reaﬃrming the very soft behavior of the compound and none of the complex patterns could be indexed to a single phase. Nevertheless, the single-crystal structure determi- nation of two intermediates (2b and 2c) was obtained during the drying process (Figure 6). Although there are some unidentiﬁed peaks that may indicate coexistence of some unknown structures, the structures obtained enabled to discriminate most peaks and conﬁrm the coexistence of at least two intermediates with diﬀerent degrees of desolvation in the bulk sample (Figures S2 and S3). The framework connectivity and zinc coordination geometry of the intermediates are nearly identical, indicating that the transition of zinc cores to the open form requires complete desolvation. As anticipated from the TG experiment, the dried form 2d with one open metal site is sensitive to air moisture; one water molecule coordinates readily to one of the zinc ions to give the hydrated form 2e, [Zn2(tp)2(L2)(H2O)]n (Figure 6). The Raman signature of 2e is similar to that of 2d with a single band at 1433 cm1 (Figure S4). To ascertain the soft properties of the SBU, the reversibility of the transformations upon gas sorption must be conﬁrmed. Gas Sorption Properties of 2d. As compound 2d has a nonporous structure, we expected that the sorption isotherms of 2d would show gate-opening corresponding to the opening of the structure and/or a stepwise profile reflecting the formation of several structural intermediates. Gas adsorption isotherms were Figure 6. Crystal structure of 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, and 2e showing structural transformations upon desolvation and moisture coordination.

Soc. 2011, 133, 9005–9013 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE measured for N2 (77 K), O2 (77 K), Ar (77 K), and CO2 (195 K). The adsorption isotherms show preferential uptake of O2 over Ar and N2 at 77 K (Figure 9). The O2 and Ar adsorption isotherms are characterized by gate-opening-type adsorption, as expected from the nonporous structure of 2d. The large differences in the onset pressures of similar gas molecules (5.0 kPa, P/P0 = 0.25 for O2 and 23.0 kPa, P/P0 = 0.98 for Ar) at 77 K is important for the application in gas separation. We suppose that the preferential adsorption of O2 could be attributed to a stronger interaction between guest and host molecule during the gate-opening process.3032,4446 In contrast to the gate-opening-type adsorp- tion isotherms for O2 and Ar on 2d at 77 K, the CO2 adsorption isotherm at 195 K shows a stepwise sorption reflecting the framework flexibility. The fact that steps are not observed for O2 and Ar does not indicate that the structure is rigid, but rather that the characterization of the framework flexibility by gas sorption is probe dependent. In details the CO2 profile shows four steps: a first small step below 5 kPa, two intermediate steps up to 40 kPa, and a last one reaching the saturation of the compound. Characterization of Structural Transformations of 2d upon Adsorption of CO2 at 195 K. To understand the relation- ship between stepwise sorption and the structural transforma- tions, we measured the PXRD patterns of 2d at various vapor pressures of CO2 corresponding to the different steps (Figure 10). The peak indexing of the pattern at P = 0 kPa confirmed the structure obtained from the single structure of 2d (Table 2). The patterns obtained at P = 10 and 35 kPa cannot be indexed as single phases, indicative of the coexistence of several intermediate struc- tures (Figures S5 and S6), which is in accord with the results obtained from the desolvation experiments (Figure 8) and with the low gradient uptake of the sorption profile in that region. Taking into account the results from the single-crystal study, we propose a setofunitcellparametersofthe35kPapattern(Table2).Thissetof parameters fits all reflections, missing only three peaks belonging to the 0 kPa pattern (Figure S6). The fully CO2 accommodated pattern could be successfully indexed accounting for all reflections (Table 2). The evolution of the unit cell parameters indicates that the structure of 2d straightens gradually to become similar to those of the as-synthesized phase (2a) at CO2 saturation. However, the difference in unit cell angles suggests that the fully CO2-accommodated structure is somewhat different from that of 2a, which is consistent with the observed deviation in the PXRD patterns (IV and 2a in Figure 11). Given these results, we argue that the accommodation of CO2 molecules in 2d causes the reformation of the zinc paddle-wheel with a slightly different struc- ture at saturation. To further support this hypothesis, and because PXRD data cannot provide information below 5 kPa due to the presence of mixtures under low CO2 loading conditions, Raman spectroscopy measurements of 2d were carried out in situ under CO2 pressure from dried to fully saturated and back (Figure 11). As early as 16 kPa of CO2 the characteristic double band of νsym- (COO) vibration around 1425 cm1 appears, along with the band from the adsorbed CO2 at 1374 cm1 (Figure 11a).47 The peak changeindicates thatthezinc paddle-wheel is reformed after the first step adsorption of CO2 at 195 K. Increasing the pressure does not involve any further changes in the Raman vibrations apart from an increase in the intensity of the adsorbed CO2 band. The spectra upon desorption are nearly a reverse mirror image of the spectra upon absorption (Figure 11b) in accord with the PXRD patterns measured under CO2 sorption conditions (Figure S7). The sudden change of the νsym(COO) vibration band from 4.2 to 0 kPa of CO2 upon desorption shows that the zinc paddle-wheel persists until the complete evacuation of CO2 from the framework. The PXRD pattern measured at 0 kPa during the desorption conditions shows the restoration of 2d after the evacuation of CO2 from the framework (Figure S7). This is in accordance with single-crystal structural transformations of the as-synthesized framework (2a) upon desolvation (Figures 6 and S1). Considering that at 5 kPa, the geometries around zinc atoms are still tetrahedral, the uptake of CO2 molecules might be eased by the open metal site in the very first step of the sorption, before experiencing a straightening of the structure accompanied by the reformation of the paddle-wheel, acting similarly to a gate-opening process. More importantly, the Raman spectroscopic study stands as a strong evidence to confirm the reversible metalligand bond formation of the paddle-wheel unitin2dinducedbytheaccommodationofasfewastwomolecules per formula unit (16 kPa). From all the results acquired, we have demonstrated the fully reversible soft property of the zinc paddle- wheel. Comparison of 1a and 2a. We decided to re-evaluate com- pound 1a and its dried form 1b. Because of the strong similarities Figure 9.

Soc. 2011, 133, 9005–9013 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE in the structure of 1a and 2a (Figure 1) and in the sorption profiles of their respective activated forms, 1b and 2d, this has lead us to speculate that 1b is in fact isostructural to 2d (Figure S8) and that its CO2 sorption profile can be interpreted in similar terms as 2d. As expected, 1a shows the characteristic double band of the νsym(COO) vibration for the bridged carboxylates, while 1b indicates the single band for the open paddle-wheel (Figure 12). In addition, the Raman spectral changes of 1b under pressure of CO2 at 195 K shows the reversible soft behavior of the zinc paddle- wheel,ascharacterizedbythechangesofthe νsym(COO) vibration band (Figure 13). The use of the ligand L1 also allows the paddle- wheel to undergo severe distortions. ’CONCLUSIONS With the synthesis and characterization of the compounds reported above, besides providing extensive experimental evi- dence of the interplay between structure and multistep gas sorption, we have demonstrated that with a proper functionaliza- tion of the environment of a usually rigid SBU, we can modify its behavior so that it can reversibly ﬂex to confer soft porous properties to a material. Furthermore, we gave the ﬁrst account of the regeneration of the zinc paddle-wheel from its open form driven by the adsorption of a few gas molecules, showing that it is a low energy process and at the same time excluding any arguments about a possible recrystallization phenomenon in a solvated media. The development of porous compounds bearing soft SBUs expands further the possibilities of PCPs to be used as sophisticated gas adsorbents. ’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Methods.

The sorption isotherm mea- surements were performed with the use of an automatic volumetric adsorption apparatus (BELSORP-18Plus or BELSORP-max; Bel Japan, Inc.). The dried sample was placed into the sample tube and then, prior to measurement, was evacuated again using the degas function of the analyzer for 3 h at 388 K. The change of the pressure was monitored and the degree of adsorption was detected by the decrease of the pressure at the equilibrium state. Highly pure gases (>99.999%) were used for the measurements. X-ray Studies. Data were collected on Rigaku/MSC Saturn CCD diffractometer with confocal monochromated MoKR radiation (λ = 0.7107 Å) and processed using the CrystalClear program (Rigaku). All the single-crystal structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full matrix least-squares refinement cycles on F2 for all data using the SHELX-97.50 The crystallizing solvents in 1a and 2b were disordered and could not be satisfactorily localized. Therefore, after all of the framework atoms (that were readily obtained from difference Fourier maps) were refined, the SQUEEZE48 function was used to determine the contribution of the disordered solvent molecules that could not be refined to the structure factors. The contribution of these species was removed from the final structure factor calculations. The indistinguish- able C and N atoms of the disordered DMF molecule in 2a were refined by EXYZ and EADP constraints. The single crystals of 2b were obtained by ex situ heating the single crystals of 2a at 100 C under N2 atmos- phere for 1 day. The single-crystal structure of 2c was obtained by in situ heating of the crystals of 2a from 25 to 80 C with a heating rate of 1 K 3 min1 for 55 min on a goniometer head. The crystals were heated for an addition 30 min at 80 C, and then the crystals were cooled to 180 C prior to the data collection. The diffraction data of the single crystal of 2d were collected under continuous heating at 105 C Scheme 2. Synthesis of L2 9012 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja201484s |J. Am. Chem.

Synchrotron Powder X-ray Diffraction Measurement and Analysis. PXRD patterns of 2d under various vapor pressures of CO2 were collected at SPring-8 (BL44B2)51 with the synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.799640(2) Å). Before the data collections, sample of the dried form 2d was put in a silica glass capillary and evacuated again under vacuum at 388 K for 1 h. After the evacuation, the sample 2d was cooled down at 195 K under vacuum and high purity CO2 gas was introduced at 10 kPa, 35 and 98 kPa. Le Bail analyses were done with the Rietica program.52 ’ASSOCIATED CONTENT b S Supporting Information.
