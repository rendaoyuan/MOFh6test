Manuscript Transformation of a Metal−Organic Framework from the NbO to PtS Net Banglin Chen,*,† Nathan W. Ockwig,‡ Frank R. Fronczek,§ Damacio S. Contreras,† and Omar M.

Heating MOF-501 in solution results in the more thermodynamically favored MOF-502. We have identified the most common nets that should result from the assembly of simple molecular shapes. These are referred to as default nets since, among an infinite number of possibilities, they form most frequently in MOF chem- istry.1 In particular, the NbO net was identified as the default for linking square building units that are oriented at 90° to each other, and the PtS net for linking square and tetrahedral building units.1a In this report, we exploit the ligand exchange lability of Co(II)2 to show that a metal-organic framework (MOF) based on the NbO net (MOF-501) can be converted into one that is based on the PtS net (MOF-502). Structural transformations of MOFs have been reported in several cases3 and used to tailor porosity in one notable example.4 MOF-501 was prepared from reaction of H4BPTC (0.030 g, 0.09 mmol)5 (Figure 1a) and Co(NO3)2‚6H2O (0.050 g, 0.17 mmol) in a solution containing DMF (3 mL), C2H5OH (3 mL), and H2O (2 mL). This solution was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel digestion bomb (23 mL) and heated to 75 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min for 48 h. It was then cooled to room temperature at 1 °C/min to give orange cubic crystals of MOF-501, which was formulated as Co2(BPTC)- (H2O)5‚(DMF)3(EtOH)(H2O)4 (37% yield, based on H4BPTC).6 During the synthesis of MOF-501, a small amount of a second phase was observed as purple plates whose proportion * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Subsequently, a pure sample of the second phase, named MOF-502, was obtained by heating the reaction mixture for 144 h at 75 °C. This was obtained in 56% yield (based on H4BPTC) and formulated as Co2(BPTC)(H2O)(DMF)2‚(DMF)(H2O)1.5.7 The direct transformation of MOF-501 into MOF-502 was also achieved by submerging isolated MOF-501 crystals in the original mother liquor and heating for 96 h at 75 °C. As-synthesized MOF-501 gradually turns opaque after several days in air. It is insoluble in common organic solvents at room temperature. The guest molecules in freshly syn- thesized MOF-501 can be partially exchanged by organic solvents such as acetone, dichloromethane, benzene, aceto- nitrile, and tetrahydrofuran, and crystallinity was maintained for several days.8 Although MOF-501 exhibits favorable solvent exchange properties, sorption studies of exchanged and evacuated samples indicate that it is nonporous to gases. We attribute the lack of permanent porosity to framework instability caused by loss of coordinated solvent and de- stabilization of the Co2(CO2)4 building units. Both MOFs were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies.9 MOF-501 is constructed from Co2(CO2)4- (H2O)5 units (Figure 1b), in which two Co(II) centers, each having distorted octahedral coordination geometries, are bridged by two bis-monodentate carboxylates and one water molecule. Three terminal water ligands are bound to one of the Co(II) centers, while the other Co(II) center is coordinated by another water molecule and an oxygen from each of two monodentate carboxylates. The bridging µ2-OH2 was con- firmed as such by comparison of the Co-µ2-OH2 bond lengths (1.986(6) and 2.184(9) Å), which clearly supports such assignment. Typical Co-µ2-OH2 distances are 2.151(21) Å, whereas Co-µ2-OH or Co-µ2-O bond lengths are 1.905(19) and 1.794(65) Å, respectively.10 By considering the points-of-extension of the carboxylate C atoms of the Co2(CO2)(H2O)5 units, and the 3, 3′, 5, and 5′ carbon atoms of the organic unit, we observe that two squares are formed (Figure 1a,b). In the overall crystal structure, these square units are linked to produce a 3D-periodic structure that is based on the NbO net (Figure 1c). The crystal structure of MOF-501 (Figure 1d) supports a network of ca. 2700 Å3 pores in which eight solvent molecules per formula unit reside.11 The structure of MOF-502 is also 3-periodic, and is constructed from Co2(CO2)4(H2O)(DMF)2 units and BPTC. Here again both Co(II) centers have distorted octahedral geometries and are bridged by three carboxylates: two bis- monodentate and one chelating µ2-O bridging tridentate (Figure 2b). One Co(II) center has a single water and two terminal DMF molecules while the other has two chelating bidentate carboxylates. When the points-of-extension (car- boxylate C atoms) are considered, this unit approximates a tetrahedron, albeit distorted (Figure 2b), which when con- nected with squares (BPTC) gives the MOF-502 structure that is based on the PtS net (Figure 2c). In the overall crystal structure of MOF-502 (Figure 2d), there are pores of ca. 900 Å3 which contain three solvent molecules per formula unit.9 Noting the distinct connectivity differences between these two structures,12 the structural transformation must involve cleavage and formation of metal carboxylate bonds in (6) Elemental microanalysis for MOF-501.

Although we do not know the mechanism of this transformation, we believe studies of this kind will contribute to our understanding of how to control geometric and electronic factors within the inorganic units of MOFs. Making use of, or ideally controlling, such transformations will become an essential strategy in the design and synthesis of the next generation of functional MOF materials. This strategy will undoubtedly yield impor- tant milestones in highly selective chemical transformations and separations. Acknowledgment.
