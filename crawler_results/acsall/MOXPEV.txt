Manuscript Engineering New Metal-Organic Frameworks Built from Flexible Tetrapyridines Coordinated to Cu(II) and Cu(I) Patrick E. Ryan, Christophe Lescop, Dominic Laliberte´, Tamara Hamilton, Thierry Maris, and James D. Wuest* De´partement de Chimie, UniVersite´ de Montre´al, Montre´al, Que´bec H3C 3J7, Canada Received October 16, 2008 A series of new metal-organic frameworks have been constructed by the coordination of Cu(II) and Cu(I) with pentaerythrityl tetrakis(4-pyridyl) ether (1 ) PETPE), a ﬂexible tetradentate ligand. Networks derived from Cu(OOCCH3)2, Cu(NO3)2, andCuBF4 provedtohavedifferent topologies (diamondoid, PtS, andSrAl2, respectively). This reﬂects (1) theability of PETPE(1) toadopt diverseconformations and(2) thevariedgeometries of complexes of Cu(II) and Cu(I). Extended PETPE (2), a tetrapyridine with phenyl spacers inserted into the pentaerythrityl core of PETPE (1), yielded an expanded version of the PtS network derived from simple PETPE (1) and Cu(NO3)2. However, increases in the ability of the network to accommodate guests were largely offset by interpenetration of independent networks. Attempts to thwart interpenetration by converting ligand 2 into methyl-substituted derivative 3 led to the construction of networks with alternative topologies. In particular, the reactions of ligand 3 with both Cu(II) andCu(I) yieldedisostructural Pt3O4 networks, despitethepreferenceof thetwooxidationstatesfor coordination sphereswithdifferent geometries. Together, theseobservationsdemonstratethat PETPE(1) andrelatedcompounds are useful ligands for constructing metal-organic frameworks, with a distinctive ability to accommodate a single metal in different oxidation states, as well as to adapt to a metal in a single oxidation state but with different counterions or secondary ligands. Introduction A major challenge in science today is to learn how to prepare new molecular materials with predetermined struc- tures and properties. Reaching this objective will require advances in basic science, and it will create opportunities for breakthroughs in many areas of technology. Unfortu- nately, developing the necessary understanding remains an elusive goal, in part because the forces that position molecules and help determine their collective properties are complex and hard to control. In general, the structures and properties of materials are impossible to predict reliably, even when the most powerful current computational techniques are used.1 Nevertheless, important progress is being made in the effort to create new molecular materials by design. In particular, noteworthy advances have occurred in the ﬁeld of engineering crystalline materials built from carefully selected molecular components. This work has demonstrated that molecular subunits for the purposeful construction of crystalline materials are particularly effective when they have the following features: (1) They incorporate multiple sites of strong directional intermolecular interactions; and (2) they hold these sites in particular orientations that favor the assembly of networks in which each molecule is positioned predictably with respect to its neighbors.2-4 Interactions that have proven to be especially suitable for engineering crystalline materials of this type include hydrogen bonds and coordinative bonds to metals. Many simple functional groups that engage in reliable motifs of hydrogen bonding or coordination to metals can be incorporated in molecules with * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Close conceptual analogies exist between molecular networks held together by coordinative interactions with metals, which can have a signiﬁcant degree of covalent character, and networks maintained by non-covalent interac- tions such as hydrogen bonds. Despite underlying similarities, however, development of the two classes of materials has tended to occur within the separate conﬁnes of inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry. This approach has empha- sized how the materials are different, rather than how they are alike. These circumstances create an attractive op- portunity to engineer new crystalline materials using an integrated approach in which understanding of inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry plays equally important roles. To test the ability of this hybrid approach to yield new insights, we have begun to explore the coordination chemistry of pentaerythrityl tetrakis(4-pyridyl) ether (1),5 which will be referred to as PETPE. PETPE is a ﬂexible tetradentate ligand that has not previously been used to bind metals. In addition, we have subjected its structure to rational modiﬁca- tions designed to produce metal-organic frameworks with new features. In particular, phenyl spacers were inserted into the pentaerythrityl core of PETPE (1) to create analogue 2, a precursor of expanded frameworks, and substituted ex- tended derivative 3 was prepared to thwart intermolecular aromatic interactions and thereby alter molecular packing. In this paper, we report the structures and properties of a series of nine complexes produced when ligands 1-3 bind Cu(II) and Cu(I),6 and we will describe the coordination of other metals in the future. Our work blends inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry in equal measure, and the results illustrate how studies in which coordination chemistry is combined with sophisticated molecular design and syn- thesis can be productive sources of new insights and hybrid materials with unusual properties. Results and Discussion Synthesis of Tetrapyridines 1-3. PETPE (1) was previ- ously prepared by converting pentaerythritol into the corre- sponding tetratosylate,7 which was then heated with 4-hy- droxypyridine in the presence of base.5 We prepared tetrapyridine 1 in 86% yield in a single step by treating 4-chloropyridinium chloride with pentaerythritol in the presence of excess KOH. Extended PETPE (2) was synthe- sized in 73% yield by Suzuki coupling of the previously reported tetraboronic acid 48 with 4-bromopyridine (Scheme 1). By the route summarized in Scheme 2, substituted extended analogue 3 was synthesized in three steps in an overall yield of 54%. Suzuki coupling of 4-bromopyridine with (4-methoxy-2-methylphenyl)boronic acid provided 4-(4- methoxy-2-methylphenyl)pyridine (5) in 85% yield. De- methylation of intermediate 5 under standard conditions (HBr/CH3COOH) occurred in 70% yield to give the corre- sponding phenol 6,9 which was converted into target compound 3 in 90% yield by treatment with pentaerythrityl tetratosylate7 in the presence of NaOH.

The crystals proved to have the approximate composition [Cu2(1)(OOCCH3)4(H2O)4] · 20H2O.10 Crystallographic data appear in Table 1, and views of the structure are shown in Figures 1-3. Figure 1 reveals that the coordination sphere of Cu(II) is approximately octahedral, with bond angles in the range 86.67(5)-93.33(5)° and trans-oriented pairs of bound pyridyl groups, water, and monodentate acetate. Observed lengths for the Cu-N and Cu-O bonds are similar to those found in related complexes of Cu(II).11 Pronounced lengthening of the diaxial C-OH2 bonds is a manifestation of Jahn-Teller distortion, a characteristic structural feature resulting from the d9 electronic conﬁguration of Cu(II).12 In its complex with Cu(OOCCH3)2, inherently ﬂexible ligand 1 adopts a conformation that holds four pyridyl groups in a highly distorted tetrahedral orientation. The distortion can be assessed by comparing the N· · ·Ccore· · ·N angles deﬁned by the central carbon atom of the pentaerythrityl core (Ccore) and the nitrogen atoms of the pyridyl groups. These angles are 4 × 124.58(6)° and 2 × 82.23(6)°, showing that ligand 1 deviates signiﬁcantly from tetrahedral geometry. Similar distortions have been observed in other pentaeryth- rityl tetraaryl ethers.8,13 The -CH2O- spacers that connect each pyridyl group to the core adopt conformations that are nearly fully extended, with Ccore-CH2-O-C dihedral angles (10) The indicated composition shows only those components of the crystal that were at least partially ordered and were identiﬁed unambiguously by X-ray diffraction. The crystal also includes an undetermined amount of disordered guests. (11) Marin, G.; Andruh, M.; Madalan, A. M.; Blake, A. J.; Wilson, C.; Champness, N. R.; Schro¨der, M. Cryst.

Metal-Organic Frameworks Built from Flexible Tetrapyridines Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 7, 2009 2795 of 174.65(6)°. However, this extension does not continue across the central carbon atom (Ccore), and the key CH2-Ccore-CH2-O dihedral angles are 70.16(4)°. Binding of PETPE (1) to Cu(II) thereby deﬁnes a three- dimensional network that has a distorted diamondoid archi- tecture, as shown in Figure 2a. Within this network, the central carbon atoms of ligands that share a common atom of Cu are separated by an intertectonic Ccore· · ·Ccore distance of 16.731(4) Å. As a result, the network is open enough to accommodate 5-fold interpenetration (Figure 2b).14 Despite this interpenetration, approximately 62% of the volume of the crystals remains accessible to guests, as measured by standard methods.15-17 The guests occupy parallel channels that run along the c axis and have cross sections that are approximately 8.5 × 8.5 Å2 (Figure 3).18 To assess the effect of replacing acetate by another anion, we allowed an ethanolic solution of PETPE (1) to mix slowly with an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2. This yielded violet crystals suitable for analysis by X-ray diffraction. The crystals were found to have the approximate composition [Cu(1)(NO3)2]·20H2O.10 Crystallographic data are provided in Table 1, and views of the structure appear in Figures 4-6. Figure 4 reveals that Cu(II) binds four pyridyl groups contributed by different molecules of ligand 1, yielding a distorted octahedral metal center with N-Cu-N angles of 2 × 88.73(15)° and 2 × 90.42(15)° and Cu-N bonds of normal length.11 Two nitrate ions that are 2-fold disordered (13) Laliberte´, D.; Maris, T.; Ryan, P.

(15) We estimate the percentage of volume accessible to guests by using the PLATON program.16 PLATON calculates the accessible volume by allowing a spherical probe of variable radius to roll over the van der Waals surface of the network. PLATON uses a default value of 1.20 Å for the radius of the probe, which is an appropriate model for small guests such as water. The van der Waals radii used to deﬁne surfaces for these calculations are as follows: C, 1.70 Å; H, 1.20 Å; N, 1.55 Å; O, 1.52 Å; and Cu, 2.32 Å. If V is the volume of the unit cell and Vg is the guest-accessible volume as calculated by PLATON, then the porosity P in % is given by 100Vg/V. (16) Spek, A. L. PLATON, A Multipurpose Crystallographic Tool; Utrecht University: Utrecht, The Netherlands, 2001. van der Sluis, P.; Spek, A. L. Acta Crystallogr. 1990, A46, 194–201. (17) To allow related structures to be compared, the excluded volume was considered to be that occupied only by Cu and the bound tetrapyridines 1-3. Other ligands, uncoordinated anions, and unbound neutral guests were all considered to occupy potentially accessible volume. (18) The dimensions of a channel in a particular direction correspond to those of an imaginary cylinder that could be passed through the hypothetical open network in the given direction in contact with the van der Waals surface. These dimensions give the cross section at the most narrow constriction, and they no not fully reﬂect the porosity of networks with channels that are not uniform and linear. Figure 2.

Atoms of hydrogen appear in white, carbon in gray, nitrogen in blue, oxygen in red, and Cu(II) in bronze. Ryan et al. 2796 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 7, 2009 complete the sphere of coordination of Cu(II), with C-O bonds elongated by Jahn-Teller distortion.12 The conformation adopted by PETPE (1) is substantially different from the one observed in its complex with Cu(OOC- CH3)2. Again, the -CH2O- spacers that connect each pyridyl group to the core adopt conformations that are nearly fully extended,withCcore-CH2-O-Cdihedralanglesof-176.6(3)°. In the complex with Cu(NO3)2, however, this extension continues across the central carbon atom (Ccore), giving two almost fully extended C-O-CH2-Ccore-CH2-O-C chains that lie in orthogonal planes. As a result, ligand 1 adopts a ﬂattened conformation in which the N· · · Ccore· · · N angles are 2 × 88.68(4)°, 2 × 97.85(4)°, and 2 × 152.48(4)°. In combination, the characteristic ﬂattened geometry of PETPE (1) and the square-planar arrangement of pyridyl groups in the coordination sphere of Cu(II) give rise to an open PtS network (Figure 5).19,20 In this network, the central carbon atoms of adjacent ligands bonded to a common atom of Cu are separated by an intertectonic Ccore· · ·Ccore distance of 16.784(9) Å, and the Cu · · ·Cu distance spanned by a single ligand is 16.166(9) Å. No interpenetration is observed. The resulting network deﬁnes parallel channels that run along the a axis and have cross sections of approximate dimensions 6.4 × 7.3 Å2 (Figure 6).18 Approximately 63% of the volume of the crystals is accessible to disordered nitrate and neutral guests.15-17 Together, these results show how alterations of the coordination sphere of Cu(II) can be accommodated by the intrinsic ﬂexibility of tetrapyridine 1, which is able to produce highly open networks with distinctly different architectures. To induce further alterations, we replaced Cu(II) by Cu(I), which often displays a tetrahedral arrangement of ligands.6 Slow mixing of a solution of PETPE (1) in CH2Cl2 with a solution of Cu(CH3CN)4BF4 in CH3CN provided yellow crystals suitable for analysis by X-ray diffraction (Table 1, Figures 7-9). The crystals proved to have the approximate composition [Cu(1)(BF4)]·2CH3CN·3H2O.10 Figure 7 shows that Cu(I) binds four pyridyl groups provided by different molecules of ligand 1, yielding a complex with a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The N-Cu-N angles range from 101.82(3)° to 122.78(2)°, and the average length of the (19) For a description of a network of PtS topology prepared by the reaction of Cu(NO3)2 with a tetrapyridine related to ligand 1, see: Na¨ttinen, K.

Metal-Organic Frameworks Built from Flexible Tetrapyridines Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 7, 2009 2797 Cu-N bonds has a normal value (2.052(7) Å).21 In its Cu(I) complex, PETPE (1) adopts a conformation unlike either of those observed in its networks with Cu(II). The -CH2O- spacers that connect each pyridyl group to the core adopt orientations that are no longer nearly fully extended, and the Ccore-CH2-O-C dihedral angles have values ranging from 137.92(5)° to 178.44(5)°. As a result, ligand 1 adopts a highly irregular conformation in which the N· · · Ccore· · ·N angles vary from 54.67(4)° to 132.39(4)°. In combination, nominally tetrahedral Cu(I) nodes and tetradentate ligand 1 yield an SrAl2 network (Figure 8a), which can be considered to be constructed from two types of rings, one with a total of four four-connected nodes (alternating Cu and Ccore) and one with eight four-connected nodes. The average intertectonic Ccore· · · Ccore distance be- tween molecules of ligand 1 that are bonded to a common atom of Cu is 13.367(5) Å, making the network open enough to accommodate 2-fold interpenetration (Figure 8b). Despite this interpenetration, 48% of the volume of the crystals remains accessible to the BF4- counterions and to neutral guests.15-17 The most conspicuous channels run along the ab diagonal and have a cross section of approximately 4.4 × 4.4 Å2 (Figure 9).18 In forming networks held together by coordination to metals, hydrogen bonds, and weaker interactions, PETPE (1) and other pentaerythrityl tetraaryl ethers all display conspicu- ous ﬂexibility.13 This compromises their usefulness for constructing materials with predetermined structures and properties. In compensation, however, this ﬂexibility gives ligand 1 and its analogues exceptional versatility in coordina- tion chemistry, by allowing them to accommodate (1) various metals, (2) a single metal in different oxidation states, or (3) a metal in a single oxidation state but with different counterions or secondary ligands, which can have profound effects on the geometry of coordination and on the topology of the resulting networks.22,23 Structures of Networks Produced by Treating Extended PETPE (2) with Cu(NO3)2 and CuBF4. To further probe the usefulness of ﬂexible multidentate ligands for engineering coordination networks, we synthesized tetrapyridine 2, which extends the Ccore· · ·N distance in PETPE (1) by the insertion of a phenyl spacer. Our goal was to crystallize complexes of analogue 2 with the same three representative salts of Cu(II) and Cu(I) used previously with ligand 1, so that the resulting structures could be compared directly. Unfortunately, our attempts to grow crystals of a complex of extended PEPTE (2) with Cu(OOC- CH3)2 were unsuccessful, but after signiﬁcant effort we were able to crystallize complexes with Cu(NO3)2 and CuBF4. Slow mixing of a solution of compound 2 in DMF with an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 produced blue crystals suitable for analysis by X-ray diffraction (Table 2, Figures 10-12). The crystals proved to have the approximate composition [Cu(2)(H2O)2](NO3)2·2DMF·6H2O.10 Figure 10 shows that the coordination sphere of Cu(II) is approximately octahedral, with bond angles in the range 87.5(4)-92.5(4)°. The nitrogen atoms of four bound pyridyl groups derived from different molecules of ligand 2 lie in a single plane, and the coordination sphere is completed by two molecules of water bound in a trans-diaxial orientation. The average lengths of the Cu-N bonds (2.024(12) Å) and Cu-O bonds (2.450(20) Å) have normal values.11 The diaxial Cu-O bonds are lengthened conspicuously by Jahn-Teller distor- tion.12 Extended analogue 2 adopts a conformation that holds the four pyridyl groups in an irregular orientation, as shown by N · · ·Ccore· · ·N angles of 69.6(4)°, 77.7(4)°, 2 × 129.5(4)°, and 2 × 129.9(4)°. The -CH2O- spacers that connect each pyridylphenyl group to the core adopt conformations that are substantially extended, with Ccore-CH2-O-C dihedral angles of 2 × 162.2(11)° and 2 × 165.1(14)°. However, this extension does not continue across the central carbon atom (Ccore), and the key CH2-Ccore-CH2-O dihedral angles are 2 × 67.2(13)° and 2 × 64.2(13)°. The resulting conformation is closely analogous to the one adopted by PETPE (1) itself in its complex with Cu(NO3)2. The PtS architecture of the network derived from PETPE (1) and Cu(NO3)2 arises from the combination of two key features: (1) Binding of four pyridyl groups to octahedral Cu(II) in a planar geometry and (2) an extended ﬂattened conformation of PETPE (1). These features are unsurprising but not fully predictable, primarily because the geometry of coordination to Cu(II) and the conformation of ligand 1 are (21) Blake, A. J.; Champness, N. R.; Chung, S.

Ryan et al. 2798 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 7, 2009 known to vary widely. However, once these features are revealed in the structure of the complex of PETPE (1) with Cu(NO3)2, they provide a basis for expecting extended PETPE (2) to behave in a similar way. Indeed, in the complex derived from ligand 2 and Cu(NO3)2, four pyridyl groups are again bound to Cu(II) in a planar array, and the resulting network has a PtS architecture, now expanded (Figure 11). In this network, the intertectonic Ccore· · · Ccore distance between adjacent ligands (25.401(15) Å) is substantially larger than it is in the PtS network derived from ligand 1 (16.784(9) Å), and the Cu· · ·Cu distance spanned by a single ligand is increased from 16.166(9) Å to 22.838(15) Å. The expanded network is open enough to allow 2-fold interpen- etration (Figure 11). Although the two interpenetrating networks have the same PtS connectivity, they are not identical. Small structural differences appear to optimize C-H · · · π aromatic interac- tions between the networks.24 Structures consisting of interpenetrating networks with different geometries or to- pologies have been observed but are rare.25 Increases in porosity caused by expansion of the network formed by the reaction of ligand 2 with Cu(NO3)2 are largely counterbal- anced by the effects of interpenetration, and the percentage of volume accessible to disordered nitrate ions and neutral guests rises only from 63% to 66%.15-17 The resulting network deﬁnes interconnected channels that are particularly conspicuous along the a axis, the b axis, and the ab diagonal (Figure 12).26 Slow mixing of a solution of extended PETPE (2) in CH2Cl2/CH3CN with a solution of Cu(CH3CN)4BF4 in CH3CN produced yellow crystals that could be analyzed by X-ray diffraction (Table 2, Figure 13).

The average length of the Cu-N bonds (2.035(10) Å) is normal.21 Extended PETPE (2) favors a conformation that holds the four pyridyl groups in an approximately tetrahedral orientation, with N· · · Ccore · · · N angles of 4 × 106.3(4)° and 2 × 116.0(4)°. The -CH2O- spacers that connect each pyridylphenyl group to the core adopt confor- mations that are largely extended, with Ccore-CH2-O-C dihedral angles of 169.90(4)°. However, this extension does not continue across the central carbon atom (Ccore), and the key CH2-Ccore-CH2-O dihedral angles are 66.35(4)°. Combination of the tetrahedral geometry of Cu(I) with the approximately tetrahedral orientation of the sites of coordina- tion in extended PETPE (2) leads to construction of a diamondoid network.24 In contrast, the pyridyl groups in the Cu(I) complex of simple PETPE (1) have an irregular orientation far from the tetrahedral ideal, and a network of SrAl2 topology is formed. Within the network built from ligand 2, the intertectonic Ccore· · ·Ccore distance between adjacent ligands is 20.158(1) Å, and the Cu · · ·Cu distance spanned by a single ligand is 21.516(1) Å. The expanded diamondoid network is open enough to allow 4-fold inter- penetration, whereas the SrAl2 network formed from simple PETPE (1) and Cu(I) is only 2-fold interpenetrated. The diamondoid network deﬁnes parallel channels that run along the c axis and have cross sections that are approximately 6.9 × 6.9 Å2.18,24 About 45% of the volume of the crystals is accessible to included BF4- ions, H2O, and CH3CN.15-17 We were gratiﬁed to observe that replacing ﬂexible tetrapyridine 1 with extended analogue 2 yielded networks with identical or related three-dimensional connectivities and with similar geometries of coordination at Cu. In both cases studied, extension of the ligand expanded the resulting network but simultaneously permitted a higher level of interpenetration, so no dramatic increases in the percentage of volume accessible to guests were observed. We reasoned that appropriate substitution of the phenyl spacer in extended PETPE (2) might prevent independent interpenetrating networks from approaching closely enough to engage in stabilizing aromatic interactions, thereby leading to lower Figure 10.

To test this hypothesis, we prepared methyl-substituted derivative 3 and studied its complexation with Cu(II) and Cu(I), using a representative set of salts that included the same three initially chosen for the complexation of simple PETPE (1). Structures of Networks Produced by Treating Substituted Extended PETPE (3) with Cu(OOCCH3)2, Cu(NO3)2, CuBF4, and CuPF6. Blue-green crystals grew during slow mixing of an ethanolic solution of compound 3 with a methanolic solution of Cu(OOCCH3)2.

Metal-Organic Frameworks Built from Flexible Tetrapyridines Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 7, 2009 2801 However, this extension does not continue across the central carbon atom (Ccore), and the key CH2-Ccore-CH2-O dihe- dral angles are 53.2(10)°. The resulting conformation closely resembles the one adopted by extended PETPE (2) in its complex with CuBF4. Combination of linear Cu2 linkers with tetradentate ligand 3 in an approximately tetrahedral conformation yields a diamondoid network. The intertectonic Ccore· · ·Ccore distance between adjacent ligands bonded to a common Cu2 cluster is 28.365(5) Å, and the Cu· · ·Cu distance spanned by a single ligand is 21.862(5) Å. The resulting network is open enough to allow 10-fold interpenetration (Figure 15), yet about 52% of the volume of the crystals remains accessible for the inclusion of guests.15,16 The guests occupy parallel channels that run along the c axis and have cross sections that are approximately 22.7 × 22.7 Å2 (Figure 16).18 The large size of these channels presumably facilitates the loss of included guests and accounts for the observed instability of the crystals. It is instructive to compare the networks produced by complexation of Cu(OOCCH3)2 with PETPE (1) and with substituted extended analogue 3. Both networks are diamon- doid, and the extension of ligand 3 helps increase the intertectonic Ccore· · ·Ccore distance from 16.731(4) Å to 28.365(5) Å, thereby enlarging the channels signiﬁcantly. However, interpenetration increases from 5-fold to 10-fold, and the percentage of volume accessible to guests remains Figure 14.

Ryan et al. 2802 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 7, 2009 essentially unchanged. Because ligands 1 and 3 differ both in length and substitution, we cannot determine whether substitution has reduced the degree of interpenetration, as intended, or whether it has helped lead to the incorporation of Cu2 clusters instead of the simple Cu1 nodes favored by ligand 1. By allowing a solution of compound 3 in CH2Cl2 to mix slowly with an ethanolic solution of Cu(NO3)2, we obtained green crystals that could be analyzed by X-ray diffraction (Table 3, Figures 17-18). The crystals proved to have the approximate composition [Cu4(3)3(H2O)12](NO3)8 10 and to belong to the unusual cubic space group Fj43c.28,29 Figure 17 reveals that the coordination sphere of Cu(II) is ap- proximately octahedral and consists of three facially bound pyridyl groups and three molecules of H2O. The O-Cu-O angles are 63.2(4)°, and the other angles at Cu lie in the range 95.9(3)-98.4(2)°. The average lengths of the Cu-N bonds (2.099(3) Å) and Cu-O bonds (1.923(7) Å) are normal.11 Ligand 3 adopts a ﬂattened and extended confor- mation closely similar to the one favored by simple analogue 1 in its complex with Cu(NO3)2, with N · · · Ccore· · · N angles of 4 × 94.5(4)° and 2 × 147.6(4)°. In both cases, two C-O-CH2-Ccore-CH2-O-C chains are almost fully ex- tended and lie in orthogonal planes. Joining non-planar 3-connected Cu nodes with 4-connected nodes derived from substituted extended PETPE (3) yields a network with a distorted Pt3O4 topology. In contrast, analogues 1 and 2 were both found to react with Cu(NO3)2 to form PtS networks. The new network can be considered to be constructed from rings in which four Cu nodes are linked by four molecules of ligand 3 (Figure 18a). The network is open enough to permit 4-fold interpenetration (Figure 18b), and approximately 20% of the volume of the crystal is accessible for inclusion of disordered counterions and neutral guests.15,16 No signiﬁcant channels are deﬁned, and the disordered species instead occupy isolated cavities.24 Our ﬁnding that the complex of Cu(NO3)2 with ligand 3 does not follow the pattern set by analogues 1 and 2 is consistent with the hypothesis that substitution thwarts interpenetration and thereby directs assembly toward a new topology that can offer a higher density of packing. To test this notion, we examined networks produced by the reaction of substituted extended PETPE (3) with salts of Cu(I). Slow mixing of an ethanolic solution of ligand 3 with solutions of either Cu(CH3CN)4BF4 or Cu(CH3CN)4PF6 in CH3CN yielded yellow-green crystals with the approximate composition [Cu4(3)3(CH3CN)4](X)4 (X ) BF4 or PF6).10 To our great surprise, the crystals of both salts proved to belong to the cubic space group Fj43c and to be isostructural with those of the corresponding complex of Cu(NO3)2, even though Cu(II) and Cu(I) normally have distinctly different geometries of coordination and therefore give rise to networks with completely different topologies. Crystal- lographic data appear in Table 3, and views of the coordina- tion sphere of Cu(I) in both salts are shown in Figure 19. Figure 19 establishes that the coordination sphere of Cu(I) is approximately tetrahedral and consists of three bound pyridyl groups and one partially disordered molecule of CH3CN. In the BF4- salt, the N-Cu-N angles have the values 3 × 106.94(8)° and 3 × 111.90(16)°, and the average length of the Cu-N bonds is normal (2.013(8) Å for bound CH3CN and 2.053(2) Å for the pyridyl groups). Closely similar values are observed for the PF6- salt. In both networks, ligand 3 adopts the same ﬂattened and extended conformation found in the complex with Cu(NO3)2, and again two C-O-CH2-Ccore-CH2-O-C chains are almost fully extended and lie in orthogonal planes. In the isostructural crystals derived from substituted extended PETPE (3), different coordination spheres are observed for Cu(II) and Cu(I), as expected, yet facial binding of three pyridyl groups by octahedral Cu(II) and coordination of three pyridyl groups by tetrahedral Cu(I) generate nodes with similar geometry. A 4-fold interpenetrated network with identical topology (Figure 18) is thereby generated by the reaction of tetrapyridine 3 with Cu(I), and approximately 10% of the volume of the crystals is accessible for inclu- sion.15,16 In crystals derived from CuBF4 or CuPF6, the tetrahedral geometry of coordination, the reduced number of ligands bound to Cu, and the lower percentage of volume needed to accommodate counterions all provide strong circumstantial evidence that copper remains in the Cu(I) oxidation state. Additional evidence was obtained by record- ing diffuse-reﬂectance spectra of crystalline samples in the UV-visible region. These spectra showed broad reﬂectance bands at λ ) 500-550 nm, which are characteristic of Cu(I). (28) Of the 415,256 entries in Version 5.28 of the Cambridge Structural Database (including updates),29 only 2002 structures belong to one of the 35 cubic space groups, and the particular group F4j3c has merely 37 representatives.

Metal-Organic Frameworks Built from Flexible Tetrapyridines Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 7, 2009 2803 In contrast, spectra of crystalline samples of the complex of substituted extended PETPE (3) with Cu(NO3)2 showed broad bands at λ < 500 nm, which are typical of Cu(II). The cubic networks derived from tetrapyridine 3 have only modest porosity (10-20%) and no obvious channels to permit the exchange of anions or neutral guests.24 Neverthe- less, addition of a solution containing excess CuPF6 in CH3CH2OH/CH3CN to crystals produced by the reaction of ligand 3 with CuBF4 led to quantitative anion exchange, as revealed in IR spectra by disappearance of the BF4- peak at 817 cm-1 and appearance of a PF6- peak at 840 cm-1. Moreover, this exchange occurs without overall loss of crystallinity, as demonstrated by powder X-ray diffraction. These exchanges may occur by sequential dissolution and recrystallization,30 but the demonstrated ability of ligand 3 to assume different conformations may allow the crystalline networks to ﬂex, thereby facilitating exchange. A similar replacement of PF6- by BF4- in crystals initially produced by the reaction of ligand 3 with CuPF6 could not be achieved under the same conditions. Greater afﬁnity of the network for PF6- may result from its better ﬁt within the cavities of the cubic network.24 The feasibility of exchanges, combined with the shared topology of the Cu(II) and Cu(I) networks, suggested that it might be possible to change the oxidation state of copper without loss of crystallinity, thereby producing mixed-valence crystals containing variable ratios of Cu(II) and Cu(I). We attempted to oxidize Cu(I) to Cu(II) in crystals of the complexes of substituted extended PETPE (3) with CuBF4 and CuPF6. In these experiments, crystals were exposed under diverse conditions to various oxidants, including H2O2, O2, Br2, and I2, but no change in the oxidation state of copper was observed in the solid state. Conclusions Our work has demonstrated that tetrapyridines 1-3 are effective ligands for the construction of new metal-organic frameworks. Studies of their complexation with Cu(II) and Cu(I) have revealed a distinctive ability to accommodate a single metal in different oxidation states, as well as to adapt to a metal in a single oxidation state but with different counterions or secondary ligands. The adaptability of ligands 1-3 arises primarily from their ﬂexibility and ability to assume a set of conformations in which the four pyridyl groups are held in geometries that are approximately tetrahedral, ﬂattened, or irregular. As expected, conversion of simple tetrapyridine 1 into extended analogue 2 by the insertion of phenyl spacers leads to expanded networks. Expansion is accompanied by increased degrees of inter- penetration by independent networks, so dramatic increases in porosity are not observed. Attempts to thwart normal interpenetration by converting extended tetrapyridine 2 into substituted derivative 3 were successful, and they yielded complexes that crystallized in the unusual cubic space group Fj43c. Surprisingly, the complexes of ligand 3 with both Cu(II) and Cu(I) gave rise to networks with the same architecture, despite the well-established preference of the two oxidation states of Cu for coordination spheres with different geometries. Together, these results underscore the ability of ﬂexible multidentate ligands to generate metal- organic frameworks with unusual structures and properties.

Intensity data were collected with 0.3° width ω scans to get a full sphere of reciprocal space. Data were processed using SAINT software.31 Data reduction included absorption corrections by the multiscan method with SADABS software.32 Crystallographic data, data collection param- eters, and structure reﬁnement details are given in Tables 1-3. Structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares techniques.33 Except in the case of one structure with severe disorder, all non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with aniso- tropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms were placed at calculated positions and reﬁned as riding atoms in the subsequent least-squares model reﬁnements, except for certain hydrogen atoms of water molecules that were located by the Fourier difference map or placed at positions to favor hydrogen bonding, then reﬁned using restraints on distances and angles. The isotropic thermal parameters were estimated to be 1.2 (1.5 for methyl hydrogens) times the values of the equivalent isotropic thermal parameters of the non-hydrogen atoms to which hydrogen atoms are bonded. Counterions and neutral guests were usually located and reﬁned using multisite models for disorder, except for two structures that were found to have large voids ﬁlled with disordered anions and neutral guests, which could not be modeled in a satisfactory way. In these cases, the SQUEEZE option implemented in PLATON was used to account for the contribution of the disordered guest.16 More information about structural reﬁnement is provided in the CIF ﬁles available as Supporting Information.
