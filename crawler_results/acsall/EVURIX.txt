Titi, and Israel Goldberg* School of Chemistry, Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, 69978 Tel-Aviv, Israel b S Supporting Information ’INTRODUCTION In recent years particular attention has been devoted to metal organic frameworks (MOFs) because of their unique structural appeal and potential applications in the ﬁeld of gas storage, separation, and catalysis.13 The MOFs are a rapidly growing class of materials that are composed of organic ligands as linkers and metal ions or metal ion clusters as nodes.4 The assembly of molecular components from solution to the solid state can be achieved in various ways, and each of these pathways can give rise to unique materials. Although remarkable progress in this area has been made, the ability to introduce in a rational way more complex functionalities into the formed solids still remains a signiﬁcant challenge. The chemistry of MOF formation is very susceptible to the chemical reactivity and solubility of the functionalized linkers. A number of strategies have been designed to improve the per- formance of MOFs. One of them is the presynthetic approach in which bridging organic ligands are chemically modiﬁed before making the frameworks, including, e.g., the catenation formation5 and ligand functionalization.6 Another strategy involves a post- synthetic approach, in which functionalization of the organic linker is carried out on the preformed MOF, converting one solid state material into another. The latter approach also led to many interesting results such as generation of unsaturated metal centers in MOFs,7 ion exchange,8 and framework reduction.9 The present study relates to the presynthetic covalent modiﬁcation approach, where we synthesize coordination polymers with a new ligand in two diﬀerent forms and describe the variationsin the structural and catalytic properties of the resulting solids. The coordination chemistry of aromatic polycarboxylate metal complexes is perfectly suited for versatile MOF formula- tions. Diﬀerent types of carboxylates have been widely used as bridging ligands to construct molecular magnetic materials, due to their wide range of binding modes that provide superexchange pathways for magnetic coupling among paramagnetic metal centers.10 Supramolecular structures based on dicarboxylate,11 tricarboxylate,12 and tetra-carboxylate ligands,13 which are inter- bridged by either mono- or multinuclear metallic nodes, includ- ing stable MOFs with permanent porosity, have been reported. Highly porous MOFs have been built with the help of tricarboxy- late linkers such as 4,40,400-s-triazine-2,4,6-triyltribenzoate,14a benzene-1,3,5-tribenzoate,14bh and 1,3,5-tris[40-carboxy(1,10- biphenyl-4-yl)]benzene,14i as well as tetracarboxylate linkers such as 3,30,5,50-azobenzenetetracarboxylate,15a terphenyl-3,300,5,500-tetra- carboxylate,15b quaterphenyl-3,30,5,50-tetracarboxylate,15c biphenyl tetracarboxylate,15di 4,40,400,40-benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetra- benzate,15j,k and binaphthyl carboxylate.15ln In the above context we describe here the coordination polym- erization behavior of 5-(2-amino-4-carboxyphenoxy)benzene-1, 3-dioic acid (1, Scheme 1) with diﬀerent types of metal ions. The Received: March 21, 2011 Revised: May 2, 2011 ABSTRACT: As part of our extensive investigations of hybrid organic inorganic coordination frameworks, we report herein on the construction and characterization of new polymeric assemblies obtained by reacting the title tricarboxylic ligand with various transition metal ions. While polymeric structures of binary metalligand composition and three-dimensional connectivity scheme could be obtained with the f-shell lanthanoid ions, formulation of crystalline supramolecular assemblies with d-shell transition metals required incorporation of a third bipyridyl component in the reaction mixture. The latter present materials of ternary metalligandbipyridyl content and layered structures composed of two-dimensional coordination polymers. The detailed coordination patterns of varying geometric features have been revealed by single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction. It has been also shown that selected polymeric solids act as heterogeneous catalysts in acetylation reactions of alcohols. The two-dimensional polymeric assemblies with nickel show higher catalytic reactivity than the three-dimensional framework solids of lanthanum, as in the former coordination networks the access of the reactant species to the metal centers and the Lewis base N-sites is less hindered. 2622 dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg200350j |Cryst. Growth Des. 2011, 11, 2621–2636 Crystal Growth & Design ARTICLE condensationbetweenisophthalicacidandaminobenzoicacidunits via the ethereal oxygen generates a ligand with three diverging carboxylic acid groups and an amine group. We have chosen such type of linkers on the basis of the following considerations: (a) the ﬂexible and polydentate coordination sites may generate multi- dimensional structures; (b) this ligand contains an amine group (its presence aﬀects the pH value during self-assembly process), so there is a provision to functionalize this amine group before and after the construction of the anticipated framework. Correspondingly, ligand 1 was converted to its amide analogue 5-(2-acetamido-4-carbox- yphenoxy)benzene-1,3-dioic acid (2, Scheme 1). Only a few coordination networks based on ﬂexible amine-tricarboxylate,16 as well as rigid biphenyl-2,40,5-tricarboxylate,17 linkers have been reported thus far, while the supramolecular chemistry of amine- based rigid dicarboxylate linkers such as 2-amino-1,4-benzenedicar- boxylate in extended solids has been studied thoroughly by many groups.18 This work represents a direct continuation of our earlier studies on the coordination chemistry of newly designed ﬂexible tetracarboxylate ligands in combination with a series of d- and f-transition metals.19 We focus here on the synthesis (under hydrothermal conditions) and characterization of new polymeric aggregates with the tricarboxylate ligands 1 and 2 (coordination polymerization of which is accompanied by deprotonation of the carboxylic functions to the corresponding anionic species to account for charge balance) and a series of metal connectors. The catalytic performance of the Ni and La coordination networks of 1 and 2, in terms of activity, heterogeneity, and recyclability, was tested in the acetylation reaction of alcohols. Crystalline coordination polymers of binary metalcarboxylate ligand composition could be readily obtained with the lanthanoid ions. On the other hand, formulation of polymeric solids with the d-transition metals required a third component, either the 4, 40-bipyridine (bpy) or 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethane (dpye) moieties.19 Many of the resulting crystals contain noncoordinated crystal- lization solvent as water, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), or bpy within the interstitial voids of the framework materials.

For compounds 312 only a single solid product was obtained in the corresponding reactions, whereas in the case of 13 and 14 some black noncrystalline solid precipitated as well. The yields reported above are based on the crystalline products obtained either directly from the reactor or after slow evaporation. The uniform identity and phase purity of the formed crystal lattices (314) in a given reaction were conﬁrmed in each case by repeated measurements of the unit-cell dimensions from diﬀerent randomly chosen single crystallites. Crystallography. The X-ray measurements (Nonius KappaCCD diffractometer, Mo KR radiation) were carried out at ca. 110 K on crystals coated with a thin layer of amorphous oil to minimize crystal deterioration, possible structural disorder,and related thermal motion effects and to optimize the precision of the structural results. These structures were solved by direct methods (SIR-97)20a and refined by full- matrix least-squares (SHELXL-97).20b All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were located in idealized/ calculated positions and were refined using a riding model; most of those involved in hydrogen bonds were located in difference-Fourier maps but were not refined. Most of the structures contain noncoordinated solvent of crystallization within the interstitial voids. These solvent species could be clearly recognized in difference electron-density maps, but in 79, 12, and 13 all or parts of them could not be reliably modeled by discrete atoms due to their severe disorder. Correspondingly, the contribution of the disordered solvent moieties was subtracted from the diffraction pattern by the SQUEEZE procedure and PLATON software,21allowing smooth convergence of the crystallographic refinements to acceptable low R-values, and precise description of the metalorganic frameworks. The crystallographic and experimental data for 314 are given in Table 1. CCDC reference numbers are 825111825122 (for structures 314, respectively).

The COOH functions in these two ligands are oriented in diverging directions and can readily and strongly coordinate to metal ions with the assistance of depro- tonation to account for charge balance, thus facilitating the formation of extended polymeric frameworks in two or three dimensions. The amine (in 1) and acetamide (in 2) substituents impart additional potential supramolecular reactivity to these ligands, although this was not manifested in the present study. The oxophilic lanthanoid (Ln) ions are particularly suited, because of their high coordination numbers, to yield 3D poly- meric architectures.

Growth Des. 2011, 11, 2621–2636 Crystal Growth & Design ARTICLE of these molecular recognition sites, the ligand molecule is engaged in extensive COOH 3 3 3 OCOOH (with cyclic dimeric as well as catemeric interaction modes) and NH2 3 3 3 OCOOH hydrogen bonding interactions with the surrounding moieties, including with the methanol unit positioned between and interacting through COOH 3 3 3 OMeOH and MeOH 3 3 3 OCOOH hydrogen bonds with two adjacent ligands. This results in the formation of open wavy two-dimensional hydrogen-bonding motifs, with the methanol units oriented perpendicular to them, that extend throughout the crystal (Figure 1b). Efficient crystal packing of the hydrogen-bonded layers in the normal direction is achieved by offset stacking between adjacent layers to allow the outward methyl substituents of one layer to protrude into the open voids of the neighboring layers above and below. The divergence of the carboxylic acid groups in diﬀerent directions impart to this ligand favorable functionality to co- ordinate simultaneously to several metal connectors and form extended polymeric arrays. Ligand 1 was thus successfully reacted with the La, Nd, and Ce lanthanoid ions in their most common 3þ oxidation state. A 1:1 reaction between the organic acid and the inorganic component is associated with triple deprotonation of 1, in order to account for charge balance. The resulting materials 46 represent, accordingly, hybrid coordination polymers with three-dimensional connectivity schemes. The interaction synthons in 4 and in the two isomor- phous structures 5 and 6 are illustrated in Figure 2. They reveal coordination numbers of 9 and similar coordination modes (with only a minor variation) around the metal centers in the three structures. The multidentate coordination capacity of the organic ligand 1 gives rise to the polymeric organization of the compo- nent species throughout the crystal. Eight of the LnO bond distances cluster within a relatively narrow range, while the ninth bond for the O-atom coordinated to two metal centers is slightly longer (see below). In 46 each Ln node connects to the carboxylate functions of ﬁve diﬀerent ligands. Its coordination sphere is supplemented by molecules of water and DMF in 4 and by two molecules of water in 5 and 6. Out of the ﬁve carboxylate groups, only one coordinates to a single metal ion in a chelating bidentate mode. The four other carboxylates connect between neighboring metals related by inversion, along the metalcarboxylate assemblies shown in Figure 2. Metal ions that are bridged by two inversion- related carboxylates, each in a μ2η2η1 mode (with one of the O-sites coordinating simultaneously to two adjacent metal centers), and six coordination bonds are distant 4.599(1) Å (in 4), 4.468(1) Å (in 5) and 4.499(1) Å (in 6) from one another. The separation between neighboring ions in the opposite direction, which are interlinked by two other carboxylate groups in a μ2η1η1- mode and only four LaO coordination bonds, is 5.829(1) Å (in 4), 5.221(1) Å (in 5). and 5.271(1) Å (in 6). The LnO coordination distance ranges are 2.423(3)2.610(3) Å and 2.838(3) Å in 4; 2.358(3)2.556(3) Å and 2.901(3) Å in 5; 2.385(4)2.593(4) Å and 2.900(4) Å in 6. The coordination environment around the organic ligand is also similar in the three compounds, involving ﬁve diﬀerent metal centers. Each of the COO functions of the benzene-1,3-dicar- boxylate residue binds in a bridging mode to two adjacent ions. The carboxylate group of the amino-4-carboxyphenyl side links in a chelating bidentate manner to an additional ion. This penta- dentate functionality of the ligand along with the roughly perpen- dicular alignment of its two aromatic fragments (as a result of the ligand bending at the central oxo atom) promotes the polymeric connectivity scheme in three dimensions. The NH2 substituent is not involved in metal coordination but only in hydrogen bonding interactions, being directed toward the intralattice voids. The crystal structures of 4 and 5 are shown in Figure 3, illustrating the open nature of the polymeric lattices that form. As the (often extensive) hydrogen bonding is of secondary importance in the coordination polymers 414, it will not be discussed in the text; these interactions are detailed on the crystallographic information ﬁles (CIFs) of the corresponding structures. Further evaluation of the coordination networks can be achieved by topological analysis (using the TOPOS software), i.e., by reducing multidimensional structures to simple node-and- linker nets where the metallic nodes and the organic linkers represent secondary building units (SBUs).23 In this respect compounds 46 have similar topologies, representing a uninodal Figure 1. (a) Molecular structure of the three-carboxylic acid ligand methanol solvate, and (b) the hydrogen-bonded supramolecular assembly in 3. The hydrogen bonding scheme, with the involvement of all functional groups, is denoted by dotted lines. The geometry of the hydrogen bonds is detailed in the corresponding CIF in the Supporting Information. 2627 dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg200350j |Cryst.

Single crystals of coordination compounds of ligands 1 or 2 with various d-transition metal ions, suitable for detailed struc- tural analysis, could be obtained only in the presence of bipyridyl auxiliaries (i.e., bpy or bpye), which take part as bidentate bridges in the formation of the polymeric networks. In contrast with the pronounced oxophilicity of the lanthanoid metal ions, many d-shell metals reveal higher aﬃnity for pyridyl ligands. In such case both the oxo and aza ligands may compete (oftentimes in a complementary manner) for coordination sites on the metal cores. Compounds 79 present such coordination polymers of ternary composition, involving the reaction products of nickel ions with either 1 or 2 and of cobalt ions with 1, and the bpy component, in a 1:1:1 metal:ligand:bpy ratio. In these solids with divalent metal ions, onlydouble deprotonationof 1 or 2 isrequired to account for charge balance. It then occurs preferentially on the two more acidic functions of the benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid fragment. The third carboxylic acid substituent remains proto- nated and is not involved in metal coordination, thus decreasing the odds of coordination polymerization in three dimensions. Our inability to control during the self-assembly process the type and number of “inert” ligands, such as water, that block some coordination sites of the metal ions further narrows the options for extended polymerization in three dimensions. In direct correspon- dence to these limitations the reactions of Ni2þ or Co2þ ions with 1 or 2 and bpy resulted in the formation of two-dimensional polymerization patterns only, as illustrated in Figure 5. Compounds 7 and 9 reveal two diﬀerent modes of self- assembly through the Ni(H2O)2 connecting nodes of octahedral coordination environment. The two structures share, however, the same structural motif: linear polymeric chains of alternating Figure 3. Open polymeric lattice in (a) 4 viewed approximately down the b-axis and (b) 5 viewed down the a-axis. The lanthanoid ions and the metal- ligated molecules of water are depicted by small spheres.

Growth Des. 2011, 11, 2621–2636 Crystal Growth & Design ARTICLE hydrated metal ions and the bipyridyl ligands aligned in the corresponding crystals parallel to each other. These polymeric chains are cross-linked in a perpendicular direction through the benzene-1,3-dicarboxylate bridges of 1 (in 7 and 8) or 2 (in 9). As shown in Figure 5, the two metal-ligated water species are in cis disposition in 7 but in trans disposition on the metal centers (which are located in the crystal on axes of 2-fold rotation) in 9. Then, adjacent Ni(H2O)2 nodes are bridged by two species of ligand 1 in structure 7 but by only a single molecule of 2 in structure 9. The resulting 2D networks are characterized, there- fore, by diﬀerent geometries and connectivity schemes. In both structures, the amino- or amido-benzene-4-carboxylic acid frag- ments are oriented roughly perpendicular to the polymeric layers (upward as well as downward). Again, neither the amino nor the amido substituents are involved in the coordination scheme. Eﬀective oﬀset stacking of the layers in the corresponding crystals is achieved by interpenetration of the peripherally oriented residues of one layer in the open voids with the neighboring layers from above and below. The remaining intralattice voids are ﬁlled by additional molecules of the crystallization solvent. All of the observed Ni/CoO/N coordination bonds in 79 are with the expected range of 2.042.13 Å. The topology of the 2D framework of 7 and 8 can be characterized as a (2,2,4)-connected 3-nodal net with Schlaﬂi symbol {12}{4.125}{4} (Figure 6a). In this framework the Ni/ Co ion, being connected to two molecules of 1 or 2 and two bpy entities, represents a 4-connected node, ligand 1 or 2 binding to two diﬀerent metal ions acts as a 2-connected node, and the bipyridyl component coordinated to two diﬀerent metal centers acts as a 2-connected node. Coordination polymer 9, involving the nickel ions, can be represented as a complex (2,4)-connected 2-nodal net having Schlaﬂi symbol {84.122}{8}2 (Figure 6b). A similar attempt to aﬀord extended coordination polymers by reacting Zn2þ ions with 1 in the presence of bpy failed in the sense that only one-dimensional polymeric aggregates were obtained with alternating metal ions and bridging ligands of 1 along the chain (10, Figure 7). The bpy ligand is side-coordi- nated to the hydrated zinc centers. The latter reveal bipyramidal coordination environment, with two carboxylate groups and one pyridyl ligand at the trigonal base and two trans-axial water molecules oriented perpendicular to it. The bridging mode of the title ligand between successive metal centers through the ben- zene-1,3-dicarboxylate residue is very similar to that observed in compounds 79 (see above). Repeated experiments with the bpye (instead of bpy) auxiliary led, however, to more extended polymerization patterns, utilizing to capacity the coordination potential of bpye. Interaction of the zinc ions with ligands 1 and 2 in the modiﬁed conditions resulted indeed in the formation of two-dimensional coordination poly- mers. The binding scheme in compound 11 reveals several interesting features (Figure 8). Here the organic ligands 1 and bpye are cross-linked into a layered assembly through dinuclear Figure 5. (a) 2D coordination scheme in 7 (structure 8 is isomorphous). (b) Square-grid coordination pattern in 9. The Ni(H2O)2 nodes are depicted as small spheres. The noncoordinated solvent accommodated within the intralattice voids has been omitted for clarity. Figure 6.

Growth Des. 2011, 11, 2621–2636 Crystal Growth & Design ARTICLE metallic nodes. In the latter, the two zinc ions are bridged on opposite sides by two carboxylate functions of two diﬀerent moieties of 1, each of them interacting with the metal ions (the two zinc ions are in an endo-exo disposition with respect to the carboxylate) in a bridging bidentate mode. Every zinc site is further coordinated in a monodentate manner to another mole- cule of ligand 1, to the pyridyl group of bpye and to one molecule of water (Figure 8a). The geometry of its immediate coordination sphere is that of a trigonal bipyramid (as in compound 10), with ZnO/N bond lengths within 1.925(5)2.024(4) Å (as com- pared to 1.963(1)2.068(2) Å in 10) in the trigonal base, and within 2.118(5)2.275(6) Å to the axial ligands (2.105(1) and 2.182(1) Å in 10). The endocyclic Zn 3 3 3 Zn distance in 11 is 4.117(2) Å. In the crystal, one carboxylate group of ligand 1 is bridging between the zinc ions within the dinuclear cluster, while the other carboxylate group of its benzene-1,3-dicarboxylate fragment connects to one of the zinc ions of another dinuclear site (Figure 8b). Again the amino-carboxyphenyl group of 1 is not involved in metal coordination, in contrast with the earlier observations in polymeric assemblies with the trivalent lantha- noid ions in structures 46. Then, the bpye ligand provides an eﬀective linker in a nearly perpendicular direction between adjacent dinuclear connectors. The supramolecular layers thus formed have corrugated surface with the noncoordinated amino- carboxyphenyl residues lined on both sides of the layers. The noncoordinated carboxylic acid groups take part in intermole- cular hydrogen bonding between neighboring layers (as detailed in the Supplementary CIF). In 11, the zinc ion is connected to three moieties of 1 and one bpye molecule and represents a 4-connected node. Ligand 1, which is connected to three diﬀerent metal ions, acts as a 3-connected node. The bpye molecule linked to two diﬀerent metal centers acts as a 2-connected node. The polymeric chain structure is a 3-nodal (2,3,4)-connected network (Figure 9), characterized by a point symbol {42.6.82.10}2{42.6}2{8}. Analogous reaction of zinc ions with 2 and bpye produced a topologically diﬀerent variant of the two-dimensional supramo- lecular self-assembly in 12. It is held together by mononuclear (rather than dinuclear) zinc-ion connectors. The latter are also ﬁve-coordinate. Every ion binds simultaneously to two bpye molecules, a carboxylate group of one 2 moiety (from the amido- carboxyphenyl part) in a monodentate fashion, and a carboxylate of another ligand 2 (from the benzene-1,3-carboxylic acid part) in a chelating bidentate mode. The ZnO/N bond distances are 1.951(2)2.215(2) Å. The third carboxylic acid function is not involved in coordination. In this single case, carboxylates of two diﬀerent parts of the bent ligand 2 were found to take part in the coordination scheme. Two such ligands span from above and below between two adjacent zinc centers, their backbones lining the surface of the coordinated layers. As shown in Figure 10, the polymeric arrays doubly interweave into each other. The interpenetrated layers form a robust “bi- layered” ensemble. Its surface is lined from both sides by the central backbone of ligand 2. Packing of these layers in the crystal is associated with interdigitation of these outshooting fragments on one such ensemble in between those of the neighboring layers. This is enabled by a roughly 90 twist at the center of 2, such that the two rings of this ligand are nearly perpendicular to each other. Figure 7. 1D coordination polymer in 10. Note that the outer end of the bipyridyl moiety is not coordinated in this structure to any metal ion. Figure 8. Coordination scheme in 11. (a) The dinuclear interaction synthon [Zn(H2O)(1)2(bpye)]2.

Growth Des. 2011, 11, 2621–2636 Crystal Growth & Design ARTICLE The individual 2D networks in 12 can be also characterized as (2,2,4)-connected 3-nodal nets, having similar topology to the polymeric assemblies in 7 and 8. The Zn ion, connected to two molecules of 2 and two bpye entities, represents a 4-connected node, ligand 2 connected to two diﬀerent metal ions acts as a 2-connected node, and the bipyridyl component coordinated to two diﬀerent metal centers acts as a 2-connected node as well. However, 12 exhibits a 2-fold network interpenetration (Figures 10 and 11), whereas 7 and 8 have no interpenetration. Coordination polymers formed with the “softer” Agþ ions demonstrate their unique behavior in relation to the other d-metals. The known tendency of these ions to form linear ligandAg ligand structures, along with the trans disposition of the pyridyl sites in bpy, both facilitate the formation of 1:1 [Ag:bpy] linear polymeric motifs with an alternating arrangement of the two species along the polymeric array. Moreover, it has been ob- served before that due to Ag2-clustering (see below), with a typical AgAg distance within 2.93.3 Å,19a,22 the polymeric arrangement may take the form of a double ladder-type chains. Such dinuclear aggregation of the d10 silver ions is known but only when stabilized by bridging anionic ligands,22as is the case in the present study in reactions of silver nitrate with ligands 1 and 2 in the presence of bpy. The Ag:bpy:(1 or 2) ratio of the reacting reagents in the respective products 13 and 14 is 3:3:1, in association with a triple deprotonation of the two carboxylic ligands. The anionic 1 and 2 entities coordinate to and bridge between nearby silver ions located ina given [Ag-bpy] chain or betweenneighboring [Ag-bpy] chains. The observed polymeric patterns in 13 and 14 are shown in Figures 12 and 13, respectively. The preferential coordination of the silver ions to the pyridyl sites is manifested by the relatively short AgN bond distances. In 13 these are Ag1N 2.217(4) and 2.220(4) Å, Ag2N 2.199(4) and 2.204(4) Å and Ag3N 2.177(4) and 2.281(4) Å, with additional binding of Ag1 and Ag2 to the carboxylates of the bridging ligand 1 (Figure 12b). The AgAg bond lengths are 3.192(1) and 3.193(1) Å. The inversion-related Ag1 pair is coordinated from both sides in a μ2η1η1 bridging mode by two carboxylate groups at relatively long AgO distances at 2.521(3) and 2.583(3) Å. Ag2 is coordinated in a monodentate fashion to another carboxylate at Ag2O = 2.494(4) Å, the benzene-1,3-carboxylate fragment bridging between adjacent [Ag-bpy] polymeric chains. There are open voids within the 2D array (shown in Figure 12a), as there is no cross-linking between the Ag2 and Ag3 metal nodes of neighboring chains in the layer. In the crystals these voids are accommodated by the crystallization solvent. To a large extent the coordination features in 14 (Figure 13) similar to those observed in 13.

Growth Des. 2011, 11, 2621–2636 Crystal Growth & Design ARTICLE are Ag1N 2.184(4) and 2.187(4) Å, Ag2N 2.218(4) and 2.219(4) Å and Ag3N 2.155(4) and 2.156(4) Å, depending on the type and number of other ligands linked to the metal centers. The AgAg bond lengths are Ag1Ag1 3.155(1) (across inversion) and Ag2Ag3 3.348(1) Å. The Ag1 sites singly coordinate in opposite directions to one carboxylate group of ligand 2, which bridges neighboring [Ag-bpy] coordination chains, at AgO = 2.627(4) Å (Figure 13b). On the other side 2 coordinates in a chelating bidentate mode to Ag2 at AgO = 2.643(4) and 2.688(4) Å. Ag3 is also coordinated weakly to a water molecule at AgO = 2.695(5) Å. The stacking between the 2D polymeric arrays is structures 13 and 14 is further stabilized by numerous hydrogen bonding interactions, invol- ving primarily molecules of water trapped in the crystal lattice as crystallization solvent and the third carboxylate group (on the amino/amido-carboxyphenyl fragments) of 1 and 2. Compound 13 has (2,3,4,5,5) connected 5-nodal net having point symbol {3.4.63.72.83}2{32.4.63.74}{32.84}{4.62}2{6}, and framework 14 is a 5-nodal (2,4,5,5,5)-connected net with point symbol {3.4.52.6.7}{3.4.52.63.72.8}{32.4.52.64.8}- {32.63.74.8}{5}. There are numerous examples of Ag(I) coordination com- pounds with short AgAg contacts that have been structurally characterized, ranging from dimers to high-nuclearity clusters. Some of the silver(I) complexes with benzoate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate, 2-hydroxybenzoate, (2,3,4,5,6-pentaﬂuoro- phenoxy)-acetate, o-acetyl-benzoate, and 1,2-benzenedicarboxy- late monomethyl ester are reported in the literature.24 These complexes have mostly discrete centrosymmetric silver-dimer structures, with typical AgAg distances of 2.802.90 Å. A second group of examples containing carboxylate-bridged silver dimers are polymeric with Ag-dimers cross-linked via AgO bonds. Such polymeric networks have been observed in the complexes of silver(I) with 2,6-hydroxybenzoate, p-nitrosalicy- latate, and 3,5-dinitrobenzoatate, wherein the observed AgAg distances are within 2.722.92 Å.25 The self-assembly of multi- carboxylate ligands such as 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 1,3, 5-benzene-tricarboxylic acid, 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic dia- nhydride, cyclohexanehexacarboxylic acid, and benzenesulfonic acid with Ag(I) led the formation of 3D coordinated frameworks tessellated by Ag2 nodes.26 In these frameworks the AgAg distances (2.83.3 Å) are slightly longer than that found in Figure 12.

Growth Des. 2011, 11, 2621–2636 Crystal Growth & Design ARTICLE metallic silver (2.89 Å).27 Similarly, reactions of silver(I) with 1,2-phenylenediacetic acid in the presence of 4,40-bipyridine or 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene led to polymeric networks with AgAg distances within the Ag2 pairs of 3.121 and 3.141 Å, respectively.28 In all of the above referenced structures, as well as in 13 and 14, the formation of the AgAg bonds appears to be a key element in their formation. In most of these compounds, the AgAg interactions are maintained with the aid of bridging or capping ligands. There is no unequivocal experimental evidence of similar silver aggregation in the absence of stabilizing ligands. According to R. Hoﬀman this metalmetal interaction may be explained by the hybridization of 4d with higher energy 5s and 5p orbitals, which converts the closed shell repulsions into weak attractive AgAg interaction.29 On the other hand, ab initio calculations on ligand-supported Ag-dimer structures suggested that electron correlation energies capture most of the physics of the AgAg interaction, where the theoretically predicted geometries were in close agreement with the ex- perimentally observed ones.30 The latter explanation seems to be more relevant for organometallic structures with AgAg distances e3.0 Å. One may tentatively conclude from the above observations that the two tricarboxylic ligands 1 and 2 reveal similar coordina- tion features in the formulation of coordination polymers with various d-transition metal ions. Neither the amine nor the amide substituent were found to play any signiﬁcant role to this end. In all structures they are oriented toward the open voids of the respective polymeric assemblies. Coordination polymers of the f-shell metal ions could be obtained only with 1, most probably due to steric interference introduced by the lager amide residue of 2. The somewhat ﬂexible bent molecular backbone of these ligands along with the diverging disposition of the carboxylic acid functions (which can readily convert to mono-, di-, or anionic species) promote coordination polymerization in diﬀerent direc- tions, giving rise to the formation of 3D framework polymers with the complementary trivalent lanthanoid metal ions or 2D polymeric arrays with d-shell transition metals. In the former case, full utilization of the coordination capacity and the bent shape of these ligands lead to open coordination frameworks (46). Direct binary reactions of 1 and 2 with divalent or monovalent metals did not yield crystalline polymeric aggregates. Only in the presence of additional bipyridyl ligands coordination polymers could be obtained of ternary metal-bipyridyl-(1 or 2) composition, but only with one-dimensional and predominantly two-dimensional connectivity schemes. There seems to be a hierarchical involvement of the carboxylic functions in metal coordination, those in the benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic moiety showing higher aﬃnity for metal-binding than the third func- tion substituted on the amino/amido-carboxyphenyl residue.

The acetylation of alcohols represents an important reaction for the synthetic organic chemist. Among the various protection methods, acetylation was found to be the most common method performed using acetic anhydride in the presence of basic or acidic catalysts.31,32 Acetylation of alcohols and phenols is carried out under homogeneous catalysis with acetic acid or acetyl chloride or anhydride, in the presence of a convenient basic catalyst such as triethylamine or pyridine.33 One drawback of this method is that base-sensitive substrates may undergo decomposition. To avoid this situation, different types of protic and Lewis acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid,34 zinc chloride,35 cobalt chloride,36 sulfamic acid,37 magnesium bromide,38 and cerium triflate39 have been utilized. Many newly developed metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are also promising as new generation heterogeneous catalytic materials.4045 These MOFs are very effective for mild synthetic transformations. Several reactions have been carried out using MOFs such as Knoevenagel condensation,46,47 aldol condensation,48 oxidation,49 hydrogenation,50 trans-esterification reaction,51 FriedelCrafts alkylation,52 and epoxide ring-opening reaction.53 In the above context, we tested the potential catalytic activity of selected coordination polymers (4, 7 and 9) of this work, as solid heterogeneous catalysts, in acetylation of alcohols with acetic anhydride: In a typical reaction, a mixture of alcohol (0.5 mmol) and acetic anhydride (0.5 mL) was added into a 50 mL ﬂask containing the catalyst (5 mg, 1 mol %). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature. Reaction conversion was monitored by checking TLC from the reaction mixture at regular time intervals. After the required reaction time, 5 mL of diethyl ether was added, and the solution was ﬁltered to remove the catalyst. The solvent was evaporated in vacuum, and aqueous Na2CO3 solution (1%, 5 mL) was added into it. The organic components were extracted into diethyl ether (2  5 mL), which was then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent gave the crude product. The amount of conversion in the presence of the polymeric solids 7 and 9 was quantiﬁed by using 1H NMR (Table 2). Blank reactions were performed by carrying the acetylation of Figure 16. FT-IR spectra of (a) 7 and (b) 9. The red and blue curves were taken, respectively, before and after the acetylation reaction. Figure 17. Kinetic proﬁles in two consecutive reaction cycles employing (a) 7 and (b) 9 as catalysts. 2634 dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg200350j |Cryst. Growth Des. 2011, 11, 2621–2636 Crystal Growth & Design ARTICLE p-nitrophenol without catalyst, at room temperature. This test reaction gives conversion of only 30% of p-nitrophenol, after a reaction time of 24 h. However, when 5 mg of solid 7 is used as catalyst, a conversion of 99% of phenol is reached already after 6 h reaction time. In a similar reaction using 9 conversion of 91% was obtained after 10 h (Figure 14). Both reactions were continued for 24 h, but no signiﬁcant increase in yield was observed. The turnover frequency (TOF) for 7 and 9 is 13.43 and 8.32 h1, respectively. This high conversion rate suggests that 7 acts as a very eﬃcient catalyst for this reaction and that both p-nitrophenol and acetic anhydride can diﬀuse swiftly between the 2D polymeric layers and through the pores and generate 4-nitrophenyl acetate in high yield. With larger and more hindered substrate such as triphenylmethanol no conver- sion was observed under similar conditions, suggesting features of size-selectivity in catalytic reactions with 7 and 9 (Table 2). Our results further indicate that 7 is a better catalyst than 9 (Figure 14). It is not clear at this point to what extent the reduced catalytic reactivity of 9 is due to steric hindrance provided by the larger amide substituent, the lower basicity of the latter in relation to that of the amine group in 7, or the diﬀerent disposition of the labile water ligands. FT-IR spectra of catalysts 4, 7, and 9 taken before and after the acetylation reaction indicate that the poly- meric structures of these two solids are retained, except for apparent deprotonation of the free carboxylic acid group during the reaction (Figures 15 and 16). As shown in Figure 14, the three-dimensional coordination polymer 4 reveals a catalytic reactivity (with TOF of 7.44 h1) for the acetylation of p-nitrophenol considerably lower than that of compounds 7 and 9 and will not be discussed in more detail. It appears that the rigidity of the 3D framework and the small intralattice space accessible to other components prevents the reactants from reaching the potential catalytic sites within the solid polymer. In order to examine the lifetime and the stability of catalysts 7 and 9 in the acetylation of p-nitrophenol, they were recycled in two consecutive experiments. The observed activity is kept over the two cycles of reaction, being slightly decreased in the second one (Figure 17). After every cycle the solid catalysts could be recovered in approximately 89% for 7 and 92% for 9. Com- pounds 4, 7, and 9 were found stable in solution and unaﬀected by the solvent on stirring. Although thorough mechanistic studies have not been carried out, it is evident from the above results (IR spectra, conversion rates) that acetylation of the hydroxylic reactant, but not of the polymeric carboxylate, is the primary catalytic process in the studied examples. This is not really surprising given the fact that the standard tutorial reaction of salicylic acid with acetic anhydride in acidic conditions yields acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) associated with selective acetylation of the OH group, while the COOH function remains intact. The above observations provide further evidence, in addition to the various examples already published in the literature,3346 that metalorganic networks and frameworks can be utilized as eﬀective heterogeneous catalysts in important chemical reac- tions. Although the product architecture in a given polymeriza- tion reaction and experimental conditions is not fully predictable as yet, the continuously growing database of the hybrid organic inorganic coordination networks may certainly yield attractive solid catalysts for various applications. This work provides another modest contribution to this end. ’ASSOCIATED CONTENT b S Supporting Information. X-ray crystallographic ﬁles in CIF format for the 12 crystalline solids 314.
