Manuscript Homochiral Lanthanide Phosphonates with Brick-Wall-Shaped Layer Structures Showing Chiroptical and Catalytical Properties Xun-Gao Liu, Kai Zhou, Jia Dong, Cheng-Jian Zhu, Song-Song Bao, and Li-Min Zheng* State Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing UniVersity, Nanjing 210093, P. R. China Received September 3, 2008 Based on enantiopure S- or R-(1-phenylethylamino)methylphosphonic acid (pempH2), homochiral lanthanide phosphonates (S)-[Ln(pempH)(NO3)2(H2O)2] (S-Ln) and (R)-[Ln(pempH)(NO3)2(H2O)2] (R-Ln) (Ln ) Eu, Tb, Ho) are obtained successfully. All six compounds are isostructural, showing chiral brick-wall-shaped layer structures. They are all optically active, exhibiting second harmonic generation responses 0.7 times that of urea. The Eu and Tb compounds display strong red and green luminescent properties, respectively, with long luminescent lifetimes at the level of milliseconds. The catalytic properties of the dehydrated S-Tb are studied. Introduction The lanthanide ions have unique reactivity and magnetic and optical properties which are fundamental to most of their applications.1,2 Enantiomerically pure lanthanide complexes, which combine the unique properties of the lanthanide ions with chiral coordination spheres, have great potential in applications as chiral NMR shift reagents for resolving NMR spectra of chiral Lewis bases,3 as luminescence probes for circularly polarized luminescence spectroscopy,4 and as enantioselective catalysts.5 Although great efforts have been made in synthesizing new chiral lanthanide complexes with different purposes, very few compounds are concerned with organophosphonate ligands.6 As far as we are aware, the only examples of chiral lanthanide phosphonates include Ln[(S)- HO3PCH2NHC4H7CO2]3·2H2O (Ln ) Tb, Dy, Eu, Gd) with chain structures7 and those based on derivatives of 1,1′- binaphthalene-6,6′-bisphosphonic acid with lamellar or pil- lared layered structures.8 In the latter cases, heterogeneous asymmetric catalytic properties have been explored, which resulted in racemic products with good yields. Our interest in metal phosphonate chemistry has also been extended to the lanthanide compounds in recent years.9 A series of lanthanide compounds containing 1,4,7- triazacy- clononane-1,4,7-triyl-tris(methylenephosphonic acid) (not- pH6)9a or 1,4,7,10- tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrakis- (methylenephosphonic acid) (dotpH8)9d have been obtained. The dehydrated Gd-notp and Ln-dotp show interesting catalytic activities toward the Biginelli reaction. In this paper, we select a ﬂexible chiral monophosphonic acid, e.g., (S)- * To whom correspondence should be addressed. Fax: +86-25-83314502. E-mail: lmzheng@nju.edu.cn. (1) (a) Aspinall, H. C. Chem.

Six homochiral lanthanide complexes with formulas (S)-[Ln(pempH)(NO3)2- (H2O)2] (S-Ln) and (R)-[Ln(pempH)(NO3)2(H2O)2] (R-Ln) (Ln ) Eu, Tb, Ho) are obtained successfully. Their chirop- tical, luminescent, and catalytic properties are investigated. Experimental Section Materials and Measurements. (S)- or (R)-(1-phenylethylami- no)methylphosphonic acid (pempH2) was prepared by reactions of (S)- or (R)-1-phenylethylamine, diethyl phosphite, and paraform- aldehyde, according to literature methods.10 (S)- and (R)-1- phenylethylamine were purchased from Aldrich without further puriﬁcation, and all of the other starting materials were of reagent- grade quality. The elemental analyses were performed in a PE240C elemental analyzer. The infrared spectra were recorded on a VECTOR 22 spectrometer with pressed KBr pellets. The powder XRD patterns were recorded on a Shimadzu XD-3A X-ray diffractometer. CD spectra were measured on a JASCO J-720W spectrophotometer at room temperature. Approximate estimations of second-order-nonlinear optical intensity were obtained by comparison of the results obtained from a powder sample (80 ( 150 mm diameter) in the form of a pellet (Kurtz powder test11) with those obtained for urea. A pulsed Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm was used to generate the SHG signal. The backward-scattered SHG light was collected using a spherical concave mirror and passed through a ﬁlter that transmits only 532 nm radiation. Thermal analyses were performed in nitrogen in the temperature range 25-650 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min-1 on a TGA-DTA V1.1b Inst 2100 instrument. The ﬂuorescent spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh FLS920 ﬂuorescence spectrometer with polycrystalline samples. Preparation of (S)-[Eu(pempH)(NO3)2(H2O)2] (S-Eu). An aqueous solution of S-pempH2 (0.1 mmol, 0.0215 g) and Gd- (NO3)3·6H2O (0.10 mmol, 0.044 g) was stirred for one day, then adjusted to pH ≈1.0 with 1 M HNO3. After evaporation at room temperature for two weeks, colorless platelike crystals of S-Eu were obtained. Yield: 68%. Anal. calcd for C18H34N6O22P2Eu2: C, 20.54; H, 3.26; N, 7.99%.

Data collections for complexes S-Eu, S-Tb, and S-Ho were carried out on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromated Mo KR (λ ) 0.71073 Å) radiation (see Table 1 for crystallographic data and Table 2 for bond lengths and angles). Hemispheres of data were collected in the θ range of 2.73-26.00° for S-Eu, 2.74-25.00° for S-Tb, and 2.75-26.00° for S-Ho, using a narrow-frame method with scan widths of 0.308 in ω and an exposure time of 5 s per frame. The data were integrated using the Siemens SAINT program,12 with the intensities corrected for the Lorentz factor, polarization, air absorption, and absorption due to variation in the path length through the detector faceplate. Empirical absorption and extinction corrections were applied. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned on F2 by full-matrix least-squares using SHELXTL.13 All of the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. All of the hydrogen atoms except those attaching to water molecules were put in calculated positions. The H atoms of water molecules were found from the Fourier maps. All H atoms (10) Kabachnik, M.

Results and Discussions Crystal Structures. Both S-Ln and R-Ln are isostructural on the basis of the XRD measurements (Figure S1, Sup- porting Information). Therefore, only compounds S-Ln (Ln ) Eu, Tb, Ho) were selected for single-crystal structural analyses. It is found that all three compounds crystallize in the monoclinic system, chiral space group P21 (no. 4). Take compound S-Eu as an example. The asymmetric unit of S-Eu contains one Eu atom, one pempH- ligand, two NO3- anions, and two coordinated water molecules (Figure 1). Each Eu atom is nine-coordinated with three positions occupied by phosphonate oxygen atoms (O1, O2A, and O3B) from three equivalent pempH- ligands, four positions occupied by oxygen atoms (O4, O5, O7, and O8) from two different NO3- anions, and the remaining sites occupied by two water molecules (O1W and O2W). The bond lengths of Eu-O are between 2.229(1) and 2.619(9) Å, and the angles around the Eu atom are in the range of 50.1(4)-148.1(3)°. The NO3- anions serve as bidentate ligands chelating with the same Eu atoms. However, the pempH- acts as a tridentate ligand, coordinating to three equivalent Eu atoms by its three phosphonate oxygen atoms. The amino nitrogen atom of pempH- is protonated. Each {EuO9} polyhedron is corner- shared with three {CPO3} tetrahedra and vice versa, leading to a chiral brick-wall-shaped inorganic layer (Figure 2). The layer contains 21 helical chains running along the b axis (Figure 2b). The neighboring layers are stacked along the c axis and repeat in an · · · AA · · · sequence, with a layer-to- layer separation of 14.386(2) Å. The organic groups are grafted on the two sides of the inorganic layer (Figure 3). An extensive hydrogen-bond network is found within the layer. The fundamental unit is a 14-membered ring, made up of two coordinated water molecules, two coordinated NO3- anions, and one protonated N atom from the pempH- ligand. These rings are connected into chains through hydrogen-bond interactions between N1 and O2W (see Supporting Information). The four shortest contacts are 2.787 Å for O1W · · ·O5i, 2.786 Å for O2W· · ·O7ii, 2.984 Å for N1 · · ·O2W, and 2.993 Å for N1· · ·O8iii (symmetry codes: i, -x + 2, y + 1/2, -z; ii, -x + 1, y - 1/2, -z; iii, -x + 1, y + 1/2, -z). The structures of compounds S-Tb and S-Ho are identical to that of S-Eu, except that the cell volumes decrease in the sequence S-Eu > S-Tb > S-Ho due to the effect of the lanthanide contraction. Chiroptical and Luminescent Properties. Solid-state circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured on KBr pellets for compounds S-Ln and R-Ln (Figure 4). Clearly, these compounds exhibit Cotton effects at the same wave- lengths (256, 262, and 268 nm), reﬂecting that the optical activities of these compounds originate from the chiral Table 1.

Homochiral Lanthanide Phosphonates Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 5, 2009 1903 organic phosphonate ligands.14 For compounds S-Ln and R-Ln with the same lanthanide ion, the opposite signs of Cotton effects conﬁrm that they are pairs of enantiomers. The second harmonic generation (SHG) properties of the powder samples of S-Ln and R-Ln were also studied. The results indicate that S-Ln and R-Ln (Ln ) Eu, Tb, Ho) exhibit SHG responses about 0.7 times that of urea. Solid-state luminescence properties of S- or R-Eu and S- or R-Tb were investigated at room temperature, shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. Excited at 395 nm, S- and R-Eu display strong red luminescent properties characteristic of the Eu(III) ions. The emission spectra have four bands at about 588, 614, 652, and 695 nm, corresponding to the 5D0 to 7Fn (n ) 1-4) transitions. Among them, the 5D0-to-7F2 transitions dominate the emission spectrum, and their intensi- ties are much stronger than those of 5D0 to 7F1 transitions, indicating that the ﬁrst coordination spheres of Eu(III) ions in S-Eu and R-Eu do not possess an inversion center, in agreement with their crystal structures.7 S-Tb and R-Tb emit green light excited at 375 nm, with emission bands at 621, 586, 544, and 489 nm corresponding to 5D4-to-7Fn (n ) 3-6) transitions. The 5D4-to-7F5 transitions at 544 nm are more intensive than the others, in accordance with the typical (14) Kaneko, W.; Kitagawa, S.; Ohba, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 248. Figure 1.

The Eu(III) (5D0) lumines- cence lifetimes (λex,em ) 395, 614 nm) are measured to be 0.360 ms for S-Eu and 0.345 ms for R-Eu, respectively. While the Tb(III) (5D4) luminescence lifetimes (λex,em ) 373, 544 nm) are 1.045 ms for S-Tb and 1.032 ms for R-Tb, respectively. Catalyzed Biginelli Reaction. The Biginelli reaction is a one-pot cyclocondensation of aldehyde, 1,3-ketoester, and urea or thiourea.15 Encouraged by our previous success in catalyzing the Biginelli reaction by using a dehydrated layer compound [Gd{C9H20N3(PO3H)2(PO3)}(H2O)]ClO4·3H2O,9 the enantiopure compound S-Tb was subjected to tests of its catalytic properties for the Biginelli reaction. In order to create good Lewis acid properties, S-Tb was dehydrated by heating at 140 °C for 2 h. The dehydrated sample retains the framework structure of S-Tb, conﬁrmed by the XRD patterns (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The solid-state CD spectrum suggests that the dehydrated sample is also chiral (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The condensation of benzaldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and urea was tested in dehydrated methanol in the presence of 5 mol % dehydrated S-Tb for 24 h at room temperature, producing dihydropy- rimidine in a yield of 50%.16 No product can be obtained without catalysts. In addition, the catalyst could easily be recovered and reused without a loss of activity. Unfortu- nately, however, the products are essentially racemic (ee <5%), although the catalyst is chiral. Conclusion In this paper, we report six homochiral lanthanide phos- phonates (S)-[Ln(pempH)(NO3)2(H2O)2] (S-Ln) and (R)- [Ln(pempH)(NO3)2(H2O)2] (R-Ln) [Ln ) Eu, Tb, Ho; pempH2 ) S- or R-(1-phenylethylamino)methylphosphonic acid]. All show chiral brick-wall-shaped layer structures and are optically active. The Eu and Tb compounds display strong red and green luminescent properties as expected. The dehydrated S-Tb shows catalytic activities related to the Biginelli reaction. It is noted that the layer structures of S-Ln and R-Ln are different from those of the related zinc compounds R-(S)- and R-(R)-[Zn2(pemp)(pempH)Cl] and -(S)- and -(R)- [Zn2(pemp)(pempH)Cl],17 due to the different coordination modes of the lanthanide and zinc atoms. In the latter cases, the phosphonate ligand exists in deprotonated (pemp2-) and singly protonated (pempH-) forms. The amino nitrogen atom of the pemp2- ligand is incorporated in the coordination with the Zn atom. However, in S-Ln and R-Ln, the amino nitrogen atoms are all protonated. The protonated amino nitrogen could provide additional sites for catalysis and molecular recognition. Further work is in progress to produce new chiral lanthanide phosphonate compounds with multi- functional properties. Acknowledgment.
