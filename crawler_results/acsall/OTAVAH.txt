The metal centers in 1 have nine coordinated geometry, while the metal centers in all other coordination polymers are eight coordinated. Polymer 1 comprises one-dimensional chains of lanthanum(III) benzoate that encapsulate hydrogen-bonded assemblies formed by HBen 3 3 3 4,40-BPNO 3 3 3 HBen interactions in its interstitial space. The polymer 2 and 3 are eight coordinated with square antiprism geometry around the metal node. The other four coordination polymers 4-7 have the same general composition and possess three-dimensional honeycomb like structures that encapsulates benzoic acid molecules in the interstices. The complex 5 (solid) exhibits a strong red luminescence emission characteristic of Eu(III). Magnetic susceptibility of 6 revealed weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the Gd(III) ions. Introduction Coordinationpolymersof transitionmetalionsare frequently studied but less frequently those of post-transition metals.1 Lanthanides can expand their coordination numbers as high as 10 or 12 and are expected to lead to unusual and unprece- dented structures due to such coordination flexibilities.2 Co- ordination complexes of lanthanide(III) with eight or nine coordination around the metal centers are well established.2,3 These complexes can adopt different geometries; for example, a seven coordinated complex can have either a capped octa- hedral geometry or a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry; on the other hand, aneight coordinated complex canadopt square antiprismatic, triangular dodecahedral geometry, or bicapped trigonal prismatic type of structures.4 Thus, coordination poly- mers arising from any of such geometries would have a size and shape that is dependent not only on the interconnecting units betweenthe repeated motifsbut also on the coordination environments. Though a few reports on coordination com- plexes of aromatic N-oxide with lanthanides were available during the early 1960s, structural studies were scarce.5 The complex [La(2,20-BPNO)4](ClO4)3 by Karaghouli et al. was the first example of a structurally characterized lanthanide- (III) N-oxide complex.6 Recently, numbers of examples of lanthanide-based coordination polymers employing multi- dentate ligands have appeared in the literature.7 The tendency of lanthanides to adopt a high coordination number makes the f-block metal ions attractive for the design of coordination polymers. As such, coordination polymers of lanthanides can adopt various new and unusual network topologies and attract interest due to their important magnetic, catalytic, as well as luminescence properties.8,9 Numbers of reports on coor- dination networks of lanthanides with aromatic N-oxide- based ligands have also appeared in the literature.10,11 Various two-dimensional (2D) lanthanide coordination polymers derivedfrom3,5-bis(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)-4-amino-1,2,4-triazole have been reported recently.10b The polymer {[La(μ-L)2- L(H2O)2](CF3SO3)3}n (L = bis(4-pyridyl)ethane-N,N0-diox- ide) exhibits a three-dimensional (3D) cationic coordination framework {[La(μ-L)2L(H2O)2]3þ that encapsulates uncoor- dinated (CF3SO3)- counteranions.10c A 3D coordination polymer prepared from predesigned [V6O13{(OCH2)3C(NH- CH2C6H4-4-CO2)}2]4-, 4,40-bipyridine N,N0-dioxide, and Tb- (III) ions is a catalyst for oxidation reactions.10d Inspired by these versatilities in the chemistry of aromatic N-oxide con- taining Ln(III) complexes, we have studied the synthesis of coordination polymers of Ln(III) benzoate (Ln = La, Ce, Eu, Gd, Tb) with 4,40-bipyridyl-N,N0-dioxide from one-pot multi- component reactions to understand the role of the central metal ions and stoichiometry on their structures. A total of seven coordinationpolymersare synthesized and eachof them are characterized by conventional spectroscopy along with single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction techniques.

The X-ray crystallographic data were collected at 296 K with Mo KR radiation (λ = 0.71073 A˚ ) using a Bruker Nonius SMART CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator. The SMART software was used for data collection and also for indexing the reflections and determining the unit cell parameters; the collected data were integrated using SAINT software. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares calculations using SHELXTL soft- ware.12 All the non-H atoms were refined in the anisotropic approximation against F2 of all reflections. The H-atoms, except those attached to O, were placed at their calculated positions and refined in the isotropic approximation; those attached to heteroa- toms (O) were located in the difference Fourier maps and refined with isotropic displacement coefficients. The crystallographic param- eters of the complexes are given in Table 1. Magnetic Measurements. Variable-temperature dc magnetic sus- ceptibility studies were carried out on a polycrystalline sample of 6 (2-300 K) using a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID susceptometer under a magnetic field of 0.1 T. AC studies were carried out on a Quantum Design PPMS system on a polycrystalline sample 7. Dia- magnetic corrections for the complexes were estimated from Pas- cal’s constants. The magnetic susceptibility of 6 has been computed by exact calculation of the energy levels associated with the spin Hamiltonian through diagonalization of the full matrix with a general program for axial symmetry.13 Least-squares fits were accomplished with an adapted version of the function-minimization program MINUIT.14 The error-factor R is defined as R = Σ(((χexp- - χcalc)2)/(Nχexp 2 )), where N is the number of experimental points. Results and Discussion Seven new coordination polymers (1-7) of lanthanide(III) ions with 4,40-bipyridyl-N,N0-dioxide as ancillary ligand and benzoate as anionic ligand has been prepared and character- ized. The structures represent the coordination polymeriza- tion ofhybridbenzoate/4,40-BPNO-Ln(III) arraysof different dimensionality. Three of them are of one-dimensional (1D) architecture and the other four are 3D wherein the metal nodes are bridged by at least one or both of the organic tectones. All these coordination polymers are synthesized under solution state reaction conditions and it is observed that in general when the metal to ligand (4,40-BPNO) ratio is 1:0.5 1D poly- mers are formed while a 1:1 ratio results in 3D coordination polymers. A schematic presentation for the synthesis of the coordination polymers of Tb(III) is depicted in Scheme 1. The infrared spectra of the synthesized polymers (1-7) are very similar to each other, νas (COO) stretching appearing around 1550 cm-1 and νs (COO) stretching around 1410 cm-1. The N-O stretching appears at 1276 cm-1 for complex 1 in which the N-oxo group is uncoordinated. In all the other complexes, the N-O stretching appears in the range 1215- 1240 cm-1 signifying electron donation from the aromatic N-oxide ligand. In addition, the band at ca. 3400 cm-1 indicates the existence of coordinated water in the structures. Reaction of La(III) acetate, benzoic acid, and 4,40-BPNO (1:3:0.5 equiv) in methanol/DMF reaction mixture led to the formation of the 1D coordination polymer 1 with the compo- sition [{La(Ben)3(H2O)2}.(4,40-BPNO)0.53 HBen3 DMF]n. It crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1 and the asymmetric unit contains the metal center coordinated by three benzoate ligands and two aquo ligands along with one each of uncoor- dinated 4,40-BPNO, benzoic acid, and DMF molecules. Thus, the coordination polymer 1 can also be described as a multi- component molecular complex where a 1D coordination poly- mer cocrystallizes with three other organic molecules. The coordination polymer 1 comprises 1D linear chains where the nearby La(III) centers are bridged by benzoate ligands with a M-M separation of 4.20 A˚ . As shown in Figure 1b, each La(III) ion is nine-coordinated in a triply capped trigonal prism formed by seven carboxylate oxygen atoms from six benzoate ligands and two oxygen atoms from two coordi- nated water molecules. The La-O distances (Table S2, Sup- porting Information) range from 2.470(1) to 2.861(1) A˚ and the longer La-O distances are associated with the benzoate oxygen atom O6 that acts as a μ2-O bridge linking two La(III) centers. The benzoate ligands connect the metal centers through two different binding modes: the η2:μ2 mode and η2:μ3 mode. A closer look at the coordination polymer 1 shows that it contains dinuclear La(III) cores that act as repeating units connected by an O4-C8-O8 benzoate bridge through the η2:μ2 binding mode. This bridging extends the polymer along the a crystallographic axis. The 4,40-BPNO, benzoic acid, and DMF molecules remain uncoordinated but are encapsulated between the 1D chains with the aid of weak interactions. The Article Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 11, No. 2, 2011 549 4,40-BPNO molecules play a vital role in the extension of the dimensionality of1. Theaquoligands (bearingthe oxygen O3) are involvedinO3-H3a3 3 3 O9interactionwiththe 4,40-BPNO molecules. Thus, both the N-oxo groups of the 4,40-BPNO molecule are connected to the aquo groups of two nearby 1D chains of La(III) benzoate thereby acting as a hydrogen- bonded spacer. This weak interaction imparts the molecule a 2Dhydrogen bondedarchitectureextended parallel totheab plane (Figure 1c). Apart from this, another hydrogen bond interaction exists (O10-H10a 3 3 3 O9) between the 4,40-BPNO moleculesandthebenzoicacidmoleculesthatholdsthebenzoic acid molecules in the crystal lattice. The DMF molecules are heldinthelatticethroughtheO3-H3b3 3 3 O12andO5-H5a3 3 3 O12 interactions with the coordinated aquo groups. The detailed hydrogen-bond parameters are listed in Table S3 (please refer to Supporting Information). Although there are reports on nine coordinated lanthanide complexes,10 complex 1 is important in terms of a new avenue generated for encap- sulating assemblies of guest molecules constructed through hydrogen bonding between benzoic acid and 4,40-BPNO.

Identification of such assemblies is important as they may lead to isolation of intermediate species that would lead to chemical reactions in interstitial sites.10d Similar reactions with Ce(III) acetate led to the formation of a 1D coordination polymer 2, [{Ce(Ben)3(4,40-BPNO)- (H2O)2} 3 DMF]n, with monodentate coordination by 4,40- BPNO ligands. The Ce1 center in 2 coordinates to five car- boxylate oxygen atoms of bridging benzoate groups, one oxygen atom of N-oxide, and two water molecules. The coordination geometry around the Ce1 center can be described as a dis- torted square antiprism with O-Ce1-O bond angles ranging from 69.1(1) to 149.7(1). The Ce(III) centers in 2 are doubly bridged by the carboxylate groups of benzoate ligands to form an infinite 1D chain (Figure 2a) with the closest Ce-Ce distance of 5.51 A˚ . The benzoate ligands connect the metal centers throughthe η2:μ2 bindingmode,while there are a set of benzoate ligands that coordinate the metal center with mono- dentate binding mode. The bridging extends the polymer along the crystallographic b axis. The N-oxide ligand coordi- nates the metal center with a monodentate binding mode which is a rare one to be observed for 4,40-BPNO as it generally prefers a bidentate binding mode. This binding modemakestheN-oxofunctionalitysusceptibletowardhydro- gen bond formation. Thus, the 4,40-BPNO ligands are in- volved in both intrachain and interchain hydrogen bond inter- actions with the coordinated aquo groups (Table S3, Support- ing Information). The interchain hydrogen bond interaction viz. O4-H4b3 3 3 O10 interaction of the 4,40-BPNO ligand with the coordinated water molecule (bearing the oxygen O4) leads to formation of a 2D hydrogen bonded network of 2 (Figure 2b). Apart from the hydrogen-bond interactions, the aromatic rings of the N-oxide ligands are also involved in a very weak π-π interaction (intercentroid distance 3.8 A˚ , average distance between the aromatic planes 3.497 A˚ , angle between the line between centroids and the normal to the plane of the metal ions ∼139). Moreover, the coordination polymer also contains hydrogen-bonded DMF molecules that are held in the crystal lattice through O6-H6a 3 3 3 O11 inter- action with the coordinated aquo groups. Tb(III) acetate generated a zigzag 1D coordination poly- mer [Tb(Ben)3(4,40-BPNO)0.5(H2O)]n (3) with 4,40-BPNO ligands coordinating through the conventional trans η2:μ2 Figure 1.

Each of the Tb(III) centers in 3 is coordinated by six benzoate oxygen atoms, one N-oxo oxygen atom, and one aquo ligand. In this structure, the terbium(III) benzoate forms a dinuclear core having two benzoate η2:μ2 bridges and four chelating benzoate coordina- tions between two metal centers. The metal center adopts an eight coordinated geometry. The dinuclear core acts as re- peating units and is connected to each other through the N- oxide spacer ligand with a distance of separation of 13.04 A˚ . This generates the zigzag 1D coordination polymer extended along the ab diagonal of the unit cell. The coordination polymer is shown in Figure 3. The solvent diffusion method yielded a similar 1D zigzag chain coordination polymer of 4,40-bipyridyl-N,N0-dioxide (4,40-BPNO) with terbium(III) nitrate with the composition [Tb(4,40-BPNO)(CH3OH)- (NO3)3]n.10a The Tb-O bond lengths in 3 span the range 2.30-2.52 A˚ similar to those reported in the literature.10 The coordination polymer 3 isunique from the othertwo,thatis, 1 and 2, in that here the repeating dinuclear cores are inter- connected by the bridging 4,40-BPNO ligands, whereas in the other two cases the repeating units are connected by bridging benzoate ligands. Reaction of La(III) acetate, benzoicacid, and 4,40-BPNO in 1:3:1 equiv in a methanol/DMF reaction mixture yielded the 3D coordination polymer 4 having composition [{La(Ben)3(4,40- BPNO)(H2O)2} 3 HBen]n. The other three coordination poly- mers with Eu(III), 5; Gd(III), 6, and Tb(III) 7 have the same general composition as in 4 and possess similar 3D structures. All these coordination polymers have metal nodes with eight coordinated distorted square antiprismatic geometry (Figure 4a). As such structural details for only complex 4 is outlined here as a representative example. All the La-O bonds in complex 4 lie in the range 2.40-2.55 A˚ . The key feature of this structural type is the formation of a 3D honeycomb -like struc- ture that encapsulates benzoic acid molecules in the interstices (Figure 4c). The crystals of the coordination polymer 4 crystal- lize in the orthorhombic space group Pnaa. In the structure, eachoftheLa(III) ionsiscoordinatedby fourbenzoateoxygen atoms, two N-oxo oxygen atoms, and two aquo ligands. The benzoate ligands bridge the nearby metal centers through the η2:μ2 binding mode extending the polymer along the crystal- lographic a axis. Such a bridging leads to 1D chains with the nearest La-La distance of 5.06 A˚ (Figure 4a). These1D chains are then interconnected through the 4,40-BPNO ligands that spread the dimensionality of the complex to the three dimen- sions. The 4,40-BPNO ligands binds the La(III) centers through the trans η2:μ2 bridging mode. This elongation of the structure aroundthedimensioncreates1Dchannelsof dimension14.1 14.1 A˚ that hold benzoic acid molecules in dimeric pairs. Figure 2.

Recently, such a 3D coordination polymer derived from 4,40- BPNO ligands is reported which is shown to be used for separation purposes for C6-C8 aromatics.15 The 3D structure of the coordination polymer 4 is shown in Figure 4c.

Thermogram of the complexes 4, 5, and 7 are expected to tally with that of 6 and are not recorded. Thermogravimetric analysis of the coordination polymer 1 shows a weight loss of 4,40-bipyridyl-N,N0-dioxide, DMF, and benzoic acid mole- cules in different steps. In the first step, weight loss occurs in the range 70-180 C, which corresponds to 23.2% of the total weight. This loss of weight accounts for the loss of the uncoordinated DMF and benzoic acid molecules (theoretical weight loss 23.4%). The second loss occurs in the range 225-360 C corresponding to weight loss of 15.1% of the residuefromthefirst step(calc.14.8%) due tolossofhalfa 4,40- bipyridyl-N,N0-dioxide molecule per formula. In the third step, continuous degradation takes place due to the loss of the coordinated molecules. For the coordination polymer 2, the first step within the range 45-95 C corresponds to a weight loss of 9.5% (calc. 9.1%) due to loss of the DMF molecule, and the second step, 95-360 C, is due to the loss of two water molecules and a 4,40-bipyridyl-N,N0-dioxide molecule (experimental 31.9% of the residue from the first step; calc. 30.8%). Coordination polymer 3 also loses weight in two steps: the first step in the range 102-350 C corresponds to weight loss of 16.8% (calc. 17.7%) due to loss of the a water and half a 4,40-bipyridyl-N,N0-dioxide molecules per formula. Con- tinuous degradation then takes place for the removal of the benzoic acid molecules. For the coordination polymer 6, weight loss due to the uncoordinated benzoic acid molecule and the coordinated water molecules takes place in the range 95-185 C corresponding to a weight loss of 18.8% (calc. 18.1%). PXRD analysis of the bulk samples of the coordination polymers 1-4 are carried out and found to match well with the simulated patterns (please refer to the Supporting In- formation). This depicts the pure phase of the synthesized compounds. The solid-state fluorescence spectra of complexes 5 and 7 at room temperature are recorded. On excitation at 315 nm, complex 5 exhibits a very strong red luminescence at 618 nm, which arises from 5D0 f 7F2 transition, a typical character- istic of Eu(III).16 This is the main emission which is induced by electric dipole moment and is hypersensitive to the envi- ronment of the Eu(III). In addition, the 5D0 f 7F1 transition is also observed (Figure 5). The presence of the 4,40-bipyr- idyl-N,N0-dioxide ligand exerts some more luminescent be- havior to this molecule. On irradiation at 315 nm, the molecule emits at two different wavelengths 373 nm and at 460 nm and is characteristic of the ligand. In the case of the complex 3 and 7 also, these two bands are observed. How- ever, characteristic signals due to Tb(III) are not observed and may be due to overlap by the ligand bands. Apart from thisthelanthanide basedcomplexesare knowntoshowabsorp- tion in the NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum.17 The solid state NIR-UV spectra of the complex 5 was recorded that showed absorptions at 1190, 1385, and 1710 nm for complex 5 (please refer to the Supporting Information). Similar absorptions by europium(III) complexes are reported in the literature.18 Magnetic Studies. Magnetic couplings between paramag- netic Ln(III) ions are hard to determine due to orbital con- tributions (L 6¼ 0), which render the spin-Hamiltonian inapplicable, and due to the low strength of those interac- tions, due to the effective shielding of the 4f electrons by the outer-shell electrons. Only in orbitally nondegenerate (L = 0) Gd (III) complexes, magnetic interactions can be easily deter- mined by magnetic susceptibility studies, since in all other cases the effect of magnetic exchange on the thermal varia- tion of the magnetic susceptibility is masked by the effect of the thermal depopulation of the excited Stark levels upon cooling. For this reason, complex 6 [{Gd(Ben)3(4,40-BPNO)- (H2O)2} 3 HBen]n was chosen for such studies, to obtain an estimate of the Ln(III)-Ln(III) magnetic interactions. The χMT value of 6 at 300 K is 7.88 cm3 mol-1 K, typical of a S = 7/2 spin (g = 2). This remains relatively constant upon cooling, exhibiting a sharp decrease below 20 K. This was associated with the combined effects of Zeeman splitting inside the magnetic field and possible antiferromagnetic interactions. Initial attempts to account for this drop only through consideration of Zeeman splitting were unsuccess- ful. Consequently, magnetic exchange couplings were also included into our model, employing a mean-field correction. The corresponding Hamiltonian was Hˆ = gμBHSˆ - 2zJÆS- zæSˆz, where z is the number of nearest neighbors and J is the magnetic exchange coupling constant. Fits to this model yielded best-fit parameters zJ = -0.022 cm-1 and g = 2.01 with R = 1.3  10-5. Considering that from the crystal structure we derive z = 2, the exchange coupling is estimated to be -0.011 cm-1. The very weak couplings between Gd (III) ions are typical of the strength of 4f-4f interactions. AC susceptibility studies were carried out on the Tb(III) complex 7 to determine possible magnetic relaxation behavior. Figure 5. Solid state fluorescence spectrum of the complex 5.

However, no out-of-phase signals were detected over a large frequency range, and thus such effects were ruled out.19 Conclusion One-pot reactions of anionic benzoate ligands and 4,40- bipyridyl-N,N0-dioxide with various lanthanide(III) form co- ordination polymers whose compositions are decided by the stoichiometry of the reactants. A series of lanthanide 1D coordination polymers 1-3 are formed when the metal to 4,40-BPNO ratio used is 1:0.5 in the reaction mixture. The structures as well as the guest inclusion by these polymers prepared by the deficiency of 4,40-BPNO are random rather than depending on the metal ion under consideration. How- ever, one such polymer is important in encapsulating selective 1D supramolecular units in the interstices. The coordination polymer 1 holds hydrogen bonded units of HBen 3 3 3 4,40- BPNO3 3 3 HBen with a length of 22.38 A˚ . Isostructural [{Ln- (Ben)3(4,40-BPNO)(H2O)2} 3 HBen]n where Ln = La, Eu, Gd, Tb coordination polymers prepared from similar reaction with metal to 4,40-BPNO ratio 1:1 have eight coordinated distorted square antiprismatic geometry around the metal centers and are able to form 1D channel structures having neutral benzoic acid molecules encapsulated. Complex 5 exhibits a strong red luminescence emission in the solid state, characteristic of Eu(III) complexes. Magnetic susceptibility of 6 revealed weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the Gd(III) ions. Acknowledgment.
