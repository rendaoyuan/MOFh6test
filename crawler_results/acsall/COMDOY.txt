Manuscript Tossing and Turning: Guests in the Flexible Frameworks of Metal(III) Dicarboxylates Marie Vougo-Zanda, Jin Huang, Ekaterina Anokhina,† Xiqu Wang, and Allan J. Jacobson* Department of Chemistry, UniVersity of Houston, Houston, Texas 77204-5003 Received January 2, 2008 Single crystals of Ga(OH)(C8H4O4)·0.74C8H6O4 (2) and Ga(OH,F)(C8H4O4)·0.74C8H6O4 (3) were obtained under hydrothermal conditions. Thestructures of 2and3havethesametopological framework as thepreviously reported aluminum 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC), Al(OH)(C8H4O4)·0.7C8H6O4 (1). The frameworks are built by inter- connecting M-OH-M chains (M ) Al, Ga) with BDC anions to form large diamond-shaped one-dimensional channelsﬁlledwithadditional H2BDCguest moleculesoccupyingdisorderedpositionsinthechannels. Uponremoval of H2BDC, other guest molecules such as H2O and pyridine can be inserted. In this work, we present a study of the intercalation of aromatic guests (BDC and pyridine) into frameworks of 1-3 by liquid and vapor diffusion into the empty channels of 1 and by single-crystal-to-single-crystal solvothermal guest exchange for 2 and 3. In the case of Al(OH)BDC and Ga(OH,F)BDC, two interconvertible, guest-concentration-dependent phases with different orientations of the pyridine guests have been observed, while only one pyridine orientation is found in Ga(OH)BDC. Introduction Intensive studies in the area of coordination polymers recently led to the discovery of so-called third-generation materials, i.e., solids with ﬂexible, “dynamic” frameworks that respond to changes in, for example, the guest concentra- tion or external pressure and which have the potential to be used as sensors in addition to conventional applications for microporous materials such as gas sorption, separation, and catalysis.1–7 One of the most remarkable examples of the ﬂexible coordination frameworks is the series MIII(OH)BDC· xH2BDC (BDC ) 1,4-benzendicarboxylate; M ) V,8,9 Cr,10,11 Al,12 In13) where the chains of trans corner-sharing MO6 octahedra are bridged by BDC ligands to generate three- dimensional frameworks with rhombic channels. As synthe- sized, the compounds contain hydrogen-bonded chains of the guest H2BDC molecules13 inside the channels that can be removed by heating, leading to porous frameworks (except for In) of high thermal stability (up to 500 °C). Once the channels are empty, other species may be reversibly inter- calated. Upon the intercalation, the channels contract in an accordion-like manner, so that the cell dimensions perpen- dicular to the chains change to accommodate the speciﬁc guest molecules and remain virtually constant in the direction of the chains regardless of the guest species. This phenom- enon was referred to as the “breathing effect” and was studied in detail on polycrystalline samples for the case of hydration of the aluminum derivative.12 * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

We have extended this work to the synthesis and single-crystal struc- ture determinations of Al(OH)(BDC) · 0.7BDC (1), Ga- (OH)(BDC)· 0.74BDC (2), and Ga(OH,F)(BDC)· 0.74BDC (3) frameworks. We present a study of the intercalation of pyridine by liquid and vapor diffusion into the empty channels in these frameworks. In the case of the aluminum host, two interconvertible, guest-concentration-dependent phases, Al(OH)(C8H4O4)·C5H5N (1a) and Al(OH)(C8H4O4)· 0.8C5H5N (1b), with different orientations of the pyridine guest molecules have been observed. Two similar phases, Ga(OH,F)(C8H4O4) · C5H5N (3a) and Ga(OH,F)(C8H4O4) · 0.85C5H5N (3b), are formed with the gallium host containing ﬂuorine, but only one orientation of pyridine is observed in Ga(OH)(C8H4O4) · 0.85C5H5N (2a) when ﬂuorine is absent. Experimental Section Materials and Methods. All of the reactants were reagent grade and were used as purchased without further puriﬁcation. The IR spectra were measured on a Galaxy Series FTIR 5000 spectrometer with pressed KBr pellets. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out using a TA Instruments Hi-Res 2950 system in dry air, employing a heating rate of 3 °C min-1. Elemental analyses were performed by Galbraith Laboratories (Knoxville, TN). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected at room temperature on a Scintag XDS 2000 (Bragg-Brentano geometry, θ-θ mode) laboratory diffractometer with λ(Cu KR1, KR2) ) 1.540 562, 1.544 390 Å. Single-crystal X-ray analyses for 1-3 were performed on a Siemens SMART platform diffractometer outﬁtted with an Apex II area detector and monochromatized graphite Mo KR radiation. The structures of compounds 1, 2, 2a, 3, 3a, and 3b were solved by direct methods and reﬁned using SHELXTL.16 The structures of 1a and 1b were determined from powder XRD data and Rietveld analysis and are discussed in more detail below. Crystal data for the compounds 1-3 are summarized in Table 1, and those for compounds 2a, 3a, and 3b are summarized in Table 2. Host Lattices. Single-Crystal Growth and Characterization of Al(OH)BDC·0.7H2BDC (1). Compound 1 in single-crystal form was synthesized from a mixture of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (1 mmol), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (2 mmol), HF (48%, Merck, 0.06 mL), and deionized water (10 mL) in a molar ratio of 1:2: 1.5:560. Except for water, the starting components were mixed in a ﬂexible Teﬂon bag in air. The bag was then put into a hydrothermal reaction vessel containing 10 mL of water and heated at 220 °C for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting products were isolated by vacuum ﬁltration, washed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by deionized H2O, and then dried in air. DMSO was used to dissolve unreacted H2BDC. Colorless polyhedra of 1 together with a small amount of an unidentiﬁed phase (colorless hexagonal plates) were found in the (14) Wang, X.; Liu, L.; Jacobson, A. J. Angew. Chem., Int.

Vougo-Zanda et al. 11536 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 47, No. 24, 2008 ﬁnal products. The ﬁnal pH was approximately 1-2. Energy- dispersive X-ray analysis showed the absence of ﬂuorine in the crystals of 1. Optical microscope images of typical polyhedral crystals of 1 are shown in Figure 1. Systematic synthesis experiments were carried out to optimize the synthesis of 1. Without the addition of HF, a pure phase of 1 could only be obtained in polycrystalline form or as tiny needles. The presence of HF promoted the appearance of large polyhedral single crystals (up to 0.5 mm in largest dimension) but introduced an additional unidentiﬁed phase (colorless hexagonal plates). An excess of HF resulted in the formation of AlF3 as the ﬁnal product. Several other synthetic variations and processes including the adjustment of the pH and aluminum sources were attempted, but the synthesis of a pure phase of 1 in single-crystal form was unsuccessful. Elem anal. for 1: Al, 8.01% obsd (8.30% calcd); C, 49.19% obsd (50.26% calcd); H, 3.34% obsd (2.83% calcd). The measured chemical composition of 1 is in good agreement with the title formula derived from the structure reﬁnement. The IR spectrum of 1 (Figure S.1a in the Supporting Information) shows a characteristic stretching frequency of the bridging OH group at 3679 cm-1 and a strong band at 1700 cm-1 characteristic of a free -CdO vibration, which conﬁrms the presence of free H2BDC molecules inside the channels. TGA of 1 shows the release of the BDC molecules in two clearly separated steps. The weight loss from 275 to 400 °C corresponds to the removal of 0.7 mol of H2BDC molecules (36.00% obsd and 35.84% calcd) from the channels. The second weight loss between 500 and 600 °C corresponds to the loss of 1 mol of coordinated BDC (49.25% obsd and 50.50% calcd) molecules of the framework. These data are consistent with previous reports.12 Single-Crystal Growth and Characterization of Ga(OH)BDC· 0.74H2BDC (2) and Ga(OH,F)BDC·0.74H2BDC (3). Compound 2, unlike 1, was obtained in single-crystal form in the absence of ﬂuorine. Compound 2 was synthesized from a mixture of gallium nitrate (1 mmol), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (2 mmol), and deionized water (10 mL) in a molar ratio of 1:2:560. The starting chemicals were mixed in a ﬂexible Teﬂon bag in air. The bag was then put into a hydrothermal reaction vessel containing 10 mL of deionized water and heated at 220 °C for 3 days. After quenching to room temperature, the product was ﬁltered, washed with dimethylformamide to dissolve unreacted H2BDC followed by deionized water, and then dried at room temperature. The ﬁnal product was a single-phase-containing colorless polyhedra of 2 suitable for single-crystal X-ray measurements. The addition of 1.5 mmol of HF to the above synthetic mixture used for compound 2 results in the formation of colorless single crystals of 3, a closely related phase where ﬂuorine is incorporated into the compound as shown by elemental analysis. The observed and calculated chemical compositions are as follows. Ga(OH)BDC ·0.74H2BDC (2): Ga, 19.30% obsd (18.65% calcd); C, 44.71% obsd (44.69% calcd); H, 2.84% obsd (2.52% calcd). Ga(OH,F)BDC ·0.74H2BDC: (3), Ga, 19.10% obsd (18.63% calcd); C, 43.87% obsd (44.67% calcd); H, 2.41% obsd (2.47% calcd); F, 1.20% obsd (1.02% calcd assuming 0.2 F per Ga). The IR spectra of 2 and 3 also show the characteristic stretching frequency of the bridging OH group observed at 3649 and 3648 cm-1 and the strong band at ∼1700 cm-1 characteristic of a free -CdO vibration, conﬁrming the presence of the free H2BDC molecules inside the channels (Figures S.1b and S.1c in the Supporting Information). TGA data for 2 and 3 were collected in air at 1 °C min-1. Powder XRD experiments show that the ﬁnal residues were amorphous in each case. Because compound 2 is made up of gallium oxide chains, it is assumed that the ﬁnal residue is GaO1.5. The TGA data show the release of the BDC molecules in two steps. The weight loss from 300 to ∼450 °C corresponds to the removal of 0.74 mol of H2BDC molecules (31.46% obsd and 32.89% calcd) from the channels. The second weight loss between ∼450 and 750 °C corresponds to the loss of 1 mol of coordinated BDC (44.18% obsd and 43.91% calcd) molecules (Figure S2.b in the Supporting Information). In the case of compound 3, the TGA data are not consistent with complete conversion to the oxide phase. Because 3 contains ﬂuoride, it is assumed that some ﬂuoride remains in the TGA residue even though the speciﬁc phase cannot be detected by XRD. For 3, the TGA data (Figure S.2c in the Supporting Information) indicate that the release of the BDC molecules also is in two steps. The free BDC molecules are lost below 450 °C (31.03% obsd and 32.87% calcd) and the coordinated BDC above 450 °C (42.74% obsd and 43.86% calcd). In both cases, the results agree well with the formula derived from the single-crystal structure determinations and from elemental analysis. Pyridine-Containing Phases. Synthesis and Characterization of Al(OH)BDC·py (1a) and Al(OH)BDC·0.8py (1b). Compounds 1a and 1b were ﬁrst obtained by the reaction of the heat-treated form of a pure powder sample of 1 (380 °C, 24 h) with liquid pyridine under static conditions at 25-110 °C for 24 h. Powder XRD patterns of the products showed the presence of two related phases. As shown in Figure 2, the initial product, Al(OH)BDC ·py (1a), transforms to Al(OH)BDC ·0.8py (1b) by losing pyridine in air at Figure 1. Optical micrograph of crystals of 1. Figure 2. XRD patterns showing the transformation of 1a to 1b upon exposure to air. Flexible Frameworks of Metal(III) Dicarboxylates Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 47, No. 24, 2008 11537 ambient temperature within several hours. Compound 1a can be recovered from 1b by exposure to pyridine vapor (or liquid). Further investigation showed that 1a can also be prepared by a direct synthesis: aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (1 mmol), 1,4-benzene- dicarboxylic acid (1 mmol), pyridine (99%, Merck, 0.5 mL), and deionized water (10 mL) were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:2:6.2: 560. The mixture was then put into a hydrothermal reaction vessel and heated at 220 °C for 3 days. The ﬁnal product, a microcrys- talline powder of 1a, was collected by vacuum ﬁltration. Elem anal. for 1a: Al, 8.96% obsd (9.39% calcd); C, 54.00% obsd (54.35% calcd); H, 3.63% obsd (3.52% calcd); N, 4.48% obsd (4.88% calcd). Elem anal. for 1b: Al, 9.04% obsd (9.94% calcd); C, 52.83% obsd (53.10% calcd); H, 3.61% obsd (3.35% calcd); N, 3.91% obsd (4.13% calcd). TGA of the air-stable 1b showed two weight losses (Figure S.3a in the Supporting Information). The ﬁrst weight loss below 200 °C corresponds to the loss of 0.8 guest pyridine molecules per formula unit (23.32% measd, 23.30% calcd). The second loss corresponds to the loss of 1 mol of framework BDC molecules and occurs in the same temperature range as that for 1 (500-600 °C; 60.86% measd, 60.47% calcd). These results are also in good agreement with the elemental analysis, which gave a pyridine to framework BDC ratio of 0.83:1 for 1b. The TGA residue was identiﬁed as Al2O3 by powder XRD. The IR spectrum for 1b (Figure S.4a in the Supporting Informa- tion) shows a drastic decrease in the intensity of the OH band, which is also slightly shifted to higher wavenumber (3704 cm-1) as a result of the formation of hydrogen bonds between the intercalated pyridine molecules and the bridging OH groups. The IR spectrum for air-unstable 1a was not recorded. Subsequent studies showed that single crystals of 1a could be obtained by a solvothermal single-crystal-to-single-crystal guest exchange reaction of 1 in liquid pyridine in a hydrothermal reaction vessel at 180 °C for 2 days. The powder pattern of the product was identical with that obtained by gas diffusion. A similar exchange reaction at room temperature did not lead to any noticeable reaction. Powder XRD and Rietveld Analysis. The structures of 1a and 1b were determined from powder XRD data and Rietveld analysis. Initial fast scan diffraction patterns showed strong peak asymmetry especially at low angles (<23°) mainly due to the axial divergence of the X-ray beam and the effect of the low sample mass absorption coefﬁcient (µ < 5 cm-1 in both compounds). The preferred orientation was also found in these preliminary scans. The data collection was improved in subsequent measurements. To reduce preferred orientation effects, powder samples were sieved onto a frosted glass square plate (30 × 30 mm). The sample axial width, length, and depth were varied to ﬁnd the best conditions to minimize the peak asymmetry. On the basis of these experiments, data were collected from a sample mounted on the glass holder in a thin narrow stripe (∼0.1 mm thickness, 6 mm width, and 30 mm length). Each data set was collected in two parts with different incident beam slits and counting times to compensate for the intensity loss at high angle due to the small sample volume. Narrow slits (0.5° divergence and 1° scattering) and a 90 s counting time in steps of 0.02° were used for 5 e 2θ e 25°, while normal slits (2° divergence and 4° scattering) and a 70 s counting time in steps of 0.02° were used for 23 e 2θ e 60°. Because 1a is unstable in air, samples were mounted on the glass holder and sealed by a polymer ﬁlm (0.000 25 in.; SPEX industries). The XRD pattern has a broad feature at 23-28° from the glass plate, and this region was excluded from subsequent reﬁnements. The powder pattern of compound 1a was found to closely resemble the simulated pattern of compound 1. A cell indexing using TREOR gave an unambiguous orthorhombic cell with similar lattice constants. A good match was also obtained when the powder XRD pattern of 1b was compared with the simulated pattern of Fe(OH)(C8H4O4)·C5H5N, which had been synthesized previously in single-crystal form. Therefore, the atomic positions from these two structural analogues were used as preliminary starting models for Rietveld analysis of compounds 1a and 1b, respectively. All of the structures were reﬁned using the GSAS-EXPGUI software package.17 A polynomial function was used to adjust a set of background points manually selected until a “reasonable” curve was obtained. No reﬁnement of the background was per- formed. The GSAS CW proﬁle function #3 (a modiﬁed Thomson- Cox-Hastings pseudo-Voigt proﬁle function) was used to determine the peak proﬁle. Despite the use of this function, it was not possible to compensate for the peak asymmetry occurring in the low-angle part of the pattern, and this leads to higher proﬁle reliability factors. The structure was reﬁned by the Rietveld method with the proﬁle parameters kept at their reﬁned values. The atomic coordinates of models 1)and Fe(OH)(C8H4O4)·C5H5N were used as the starting values. The best results in the ﬁnal stages were achieved by using soft constraints, including the Al-O, C-C, and C-O bond distances, angles, and planarity constraints. The lowest weighting factors for the different soft constraints were kept until the deformation of the chemical groups was no longer reasonable; occupancies of the channel species were ﬁxed based on the results of TGA and elemental analysis. The overall thermal parameters for framework atoms and nonframework atoms were set as 0.025 and 0.060, respectively. No reﬁnements on these thermal parameters were performed. In the case of 1a, the disordered atoms in the pores were reﬁned only at the end of the reﬁnement because this disorder was observed previously for the model compound whose structure was solved using single-crystal data. The ﬁnal agreement factors are reasonable for laboratory diffractometer data. A summary of the results of the structure reﬁnements is given in Table 3. The corresponding ﬁnal Rietveld plots are shown in Figure 3. Synthesis and Characterization of Ga(OH)BDC·0.85py (2a).

The product, Ga(OH)BDC·0.85py (2a), remained crystalline and was suitable for single-crystal XRD. One single crystal of 2a was sealed in a glass capillary containing liquid pyridine prior to the diffraction measurement. A single pyridine phase (air stable) was observed unlike in the aluminum system. Elem anal. for 2a: Ga, 20.4% obsd (21.92% calcd); C, 45.63% obsd (46.22% calcd); H, 2.85% obsd (3.54% calcd); N, 3.58% obsd (3.74% calcd). TGA analysis (Figure S.4b in the Supporting Information) shows that compound 2a decomposes in two steps, losing guest pyridine below 200 °C, followed by the loss of 1 mol of framework BDC molecules at the same temperature range as that for 2 (450-550 °C; 61.91% measd, 62.60% calcd). The IR spectrum (Figure S.4b in the Supporting Information) for 2a shows a diminution in the intensity and a shift of the OH band (to 3669 cm-1) similar to those observed for 1b.

The crystallinity was preserved during the reaction, and one single crystal was selected and sealed in a glass capillary containing liquid pyridine prior to diffraction measurements. The results show that the sealed crystal has the composition Ga- (OH,F)(C8H4O4)·C5H5N (3a) with a 1:1 ratio of gallium to pyridine. Single crystals of 3a were exposed to air overnight, and one was mounted on a glass ﬁber and remeasured in air. The results conﬁrmed that the crystals converted to Ga(OH,F)(C8H4O4) · 0.85C5H5N (3b) upon exposure to air. Elem anal. for air-stable 3b: Ga, 21.8% obsd (21.90% calcd); C, 45.54% obsd (46.17% calcd); H, 3.05% obsd (2.84% calcd); N, 3.51% obsd (3.74% calcd); F, 0.87% obsd (1.19% calcd). As in the case of the as-synthesized compound 3, it is assumed that the residue obtained after TGA of compound 3b contains ﬂuoride. The TGA data (Figure S.3c in the Supporting Information) show the loss of the pyridine molecules from within the framework at a temperature below 200 °C. If the ﬁnal composition is assumed to be 80% GaO1.5 and 20% GaF3, then the second weight loss above 450 °C corresponds to the loss of 1 mol of framework BDC molecules (58.90% measd, 60.01% calcd). The IR spectrum for 3b (Figure S.4c in the Supporting Information) is similar to that of 2a. Results and Discussion Crystal Structure Description. All eight metal (M) dicarboxylate (M ) Al, Ga) compounds exhibit the same framework topology. The framework is built from M-X-M chains (X ) OH, F) and bridging BDC anions, creating a three-dimensional framework with a one-dimensional diamond- shaped channel system, as was previously reported for the aluminum compound. The M3+ (M ) Al, Ga) cation is coordinated to six oxygen atoms in octahedral geometry in the framework, with the M-O bond lengths listed in Table 4; only the results from single-crystal reﬁnements are included. The octahedral M-O centers are linked by sharing trans- hydroxyl groups (evident O-H IR band at ∼3650 cm-1) or ﬂuorine atoms, forming M-OH,F-M chains. The oxygen atoms of the BDC groups occupy the equatorial positions of the octahedra. The BDC ligands bridge the chains to form a three-dimensional framework. In all compounds, the M-(OH,F) distances are shorter than the M-O equatorial distances (see Table 4), but little variation is observed for different guest molecules in the gallium compounds. As synthesized, the channels of compounds 1-3 are ﬁlled with highly disordered H2BDC molecules (evident charac- teristic CdO IR band around 1710 cm-1) that were modeled by partially occupied C,O positions in the structure deter- minations. In compound 1, the occluded H2BDC molecules can be removed by heating at 380-400 °C. Pyridine Absorption by Al(OH)BDC To Give 1a and 1b. After heat treatment to remove H2BDC molecules from the channels, Al(OH)(C8H4O4) absorbs pyridine immediately at room temperature to form 1a and 1b. Crystal structure studies indicate that the guest exchange reactions from Figure 3. Observed and calculated powder XRD patterns for compounds 1a and 1b. Table 4.

In compound 1a, the pyridine molecules are ordered ap- proximately parallel to the channel walls and are hydrogen- bonded to the bridging OH groups. Compound 1b is isotypic with Fe(OH)BDC· 0.85py,13where the pyridine molecules are approximately perpendicular to the channel walls and are also hydrogen-bonded to the OH groups. Upon a transition from 1a to 1b, the channels contract; the unit cell dimensions change from 17.124(1) × 12.296(1) Å to 17.839(2) × 11.065(1) Å and remain almost constant [from 6.627(1) to 6.613(1) Å] along the Al-OH,F-Al chain. Compounds 1a, Al(OH)BDC · py (parallel guest orientation), and 1b, Al(OH)BDC · 0.8py (perpendicular guest orientation), are interconvertible by a relatively small change in the pyridine concentration. This transition is fully reversible and occurs on the time scale of several hours in the solid-gas reaction (Figures 2 and 4). A similar concentration-dependent change of the orientation of the pyridine guest molecules was observed in the layered compound R-Ti(HPO4)2.18 Because the positions of the disordered guest molecules were determined from powder data, the geometry and positions of the intercalated pyridine molecules are not precisely determined. The results are consistent with those for the gallium compounds obtained from single-crystal reﬁnements, which are dis- cussed in more detail below. Single-Crystal-to-Single-Crystal Guest Exchange between 2 and 2a. The single-crystal-to-single-crystal guest exchange reaction that converts compound 2 to compound 2a also preserves the integrity of the framework. In the case of compound 2, a higher content pyridine phase was not observed; only the pyridine-poor phase, 2a, was recovered from the exchange. Compound 2a is isotypic with com- pounds 1b and 3b. The changes in the unit cell dimensions and space group that occur upon transformation from 2 to 2a upon reaction with pyridine are shown in Figure 5. The change in the dimension along the chain axis is small. In 2a, the pseudo- orthorhombic cell deﬁned by the gallium atom positions has a ) 18.132 Å, and consequently the channel area changes from 17.52 × 11.89 to 18.13 × 11.06 Å when the inter- calated molecules change orientation. The pyridine molecules are hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl groups that bridge the gallium atoms along the direction of the chains with a N-O1 distance of 2.744(6) Å, indicating a strong hydrogen bond. The pyridine oc- cupancy is less than the ideal occupancy of 1 (reﬁned as 0.78), and consequently some residual OH groups are present, as indicated by the weak band in the IR spectrum at 3669 cm-1. No superstructure is observed, and so we assume that the pyridine molecules are randomly disordered among the available sites. The average planes of the pyridine molecules are parallel (more strictly, the N-O1 vector is perpendicular to the Ga-Ga vector along the chain), but disorder is apparent in the thermal ellipsoids of the pyridine carbon atoms, which are elongated along the Ga-Ga direction. The ellipsoids become much larger as one moves away from the hydrogen-bonded nitrogen atom to the furthest carbon atom, as seen in Figure 6a. The distance between pyridine rings calculated from the idealized model shown Figure 6a is too short (interplanar, 3.145 Å; between ring centers, 3.551 Å), (18) Nunes, L. M.; Airoldi, C. Chem.

Vougo-Zanda et al. 11540 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 47, No. 24, 2008 reﬂecting the fact that not all of the OH bridges are associated with a pyridine molecule. A schematic representation of the disorder with a pyridine occupancy of 0.8 is shown in Figure 6b; all of the pyridine molecules are tilted with respect to the normal to the chain axis. The relative orientations of adjacent pyridine molecules are shown in Figure 6c and suggest the possibility of some weak CH-π interactions. Single-Crystal-to-Single-Crystal Guest Exchange between 3 and 3a and Phase Transition to 3b. The single-crystal-to- single-crystal guest exchange reactions from compound 3 to compound 3a also happens while preserving the integrity of the framework. Just as in the case of compound 1a, the pyridine molecules are approximately parallel to the channel axis. However, in compound 3a, the guest pyridine molecule is randomly disordered over two positions. 3a is not stable in the absence of excess pyridine and, when exposed to the atmosphere, loses pyridine. The remaining pyridine mol- ecules rearrange themselves inside the channel to be ap- proximately perpendicular to the channel walls to give 3b, which is isotypic with 1b, 2a, and Fe(OH)BDC· 0.85py. The transition from 3 to 3a to 3b results in a slight opening up and then closing of the channels and a change in the unit cell dimensions from 17.410(3) × 12.165(2) to 17.287(11) × 12.461(9) to 18.23(2) × 11.062(12) Å perpendicular to the channel direction; the distances parallel to the channel remain almost constant and are 6.744(1), 6.727(5), and 6.734(8) Å, respectively. The orientation of the pyridine molecule in 3b is similar to that observed in 1b and in 2a, namely, perpendicular to the chain axis direction and hydrogen-bonded to the bridging OH group [dN· · · O ) 2.74(2) Å]. In the presence of excess pyridine, compound 3a is obtained containing one pyridine molecule per gallium atom. The pyridine molecules are disordered over two positions and lie parallel to the channels (see Figure 7) and are hydrogen-bonded to the bridging OH at a longer distance than that in the other orientation [dN· · ·O ) 2.88(3) Å]. The hydrogen-bonded pyridine molecules (Figure 8a) are staggered with respect to the BDC linkers, and the predominant interactions are hydrogen bonds. One set of disordered pyridine molecules is shown in Figure 8b in the same orientation. Conclusion We have synthesized two new members of the M(OH)- BDC series with M ) Ga in the form of single crystals with compositions Ga(OH)(BDC)·0.74H2BDC (2) and Ga(OH,F)- (BDC) · 0.74H2BDC (3). Chemical analysis suggests that in 3 ∼20% of the OH groups are replaced by ﬂuoride ions. Figure 6. (a) Stick model of the idealized structure of 2a with all OH groups hydrogen-bonded to pyridine.

Structural transformations that occur when H2BDC guest molecules in the Ga(OH,F)BDC framework are exchanged with pyridine molecules. Flexible Frameworks of Metal(III) Dicarboxylates Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 47, No. 24, 2008 11541 Because of the ﬂexibility of this framework type, crystal- to-crystal transformations enable a detailed study of the intercalation of guest molecules, here pyridine. In the case of 3, two interconvertible guest-concentration- dependent phases with parallel (3a) and perpendicular (3b) pyridine molecule orientations are observed, which contain 1.0 and 0.8 molecules of pyridine per gallium, atom respectively. The structures are both stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the framework hydroxyl bridging groups. Similar phases (1a and 1b) are formed by Al(OH)BDC, which was also synthesized in the presence of HF and probably also contains trace amounts of ﬂuoride ions. The transformation between the two phases in both aluminum and gallium systems is completely reversible; the guest molecules can turn from one orientation to the other as the pyridine concentration is increased or decreased, a change that causes a ∼7% change in the channel area. The parallel-orientation higher pyridine content phase is not observed in the absence of ﬂuoride, most likely because of the greater relative stability of the perpendicular orientation when all of the bridging sites are available to form hydrogen bonds; partial occupancy by ﬂuoride may lower the relative stability by making it impossible to achieve the optimum packing density (Figure 7b) in which all pyridine molecules form hydrogen bonds. In summary, the intercalation studies presented here further demonstrate the unusual ﬂexibility of the MIII(OH)BDC frameworks that can adapt their structures in response to the absorption of speciﬁc guest molecules.
