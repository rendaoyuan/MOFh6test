Manuscript Microporous Zinc Tris[(4-carboxyl)phenylduryl]amine Framework with an Unusual Topological Net for Gas Storage and Separation Yan-Ping He, Yan-Xi Tan, Fei Wang, and Jian Zhang* State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002, People's Republic of China * S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: By employment of a new tris[(4-carboxyl)- phenylduryl]amine ligand to assembly with the Zn2+ ion, a new topological net built from four coordinatively linked ths nets is first evidenced in the 2-fold-interpenetrating framework FIR-1, which shows potential applications in gas storage and separation. M icroporous metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) with both inorganic and organic building blocks have been receiving intensive research interest because of their aesthetic framework structures and potential applications in gas storage/ separation and catalysis.1 Through the careful assembly of multifunctional organic carboxylate ligands with metal ions, a number of porous MOFs have been synthesized and reported.2−4 To tune the pore size or pore volume effectively, a successful strategy is to change the length of the bridging organic ligand. That has been known in many famous MOFs with isoreticular or nonisoreticular networks. For example, the isoreticular MOF-5-type frameworks with different pore sizes have been constructed from a series of linear aromatic bicarboxylate ligands with various lengths,5 whereas the simple replacement of the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate ligand in the well-known HKUST-1 with the longer 1,3,5-tris(4- carboxyphenyl)benzene ligand leads to another 2-fold-inter- penetrating framework MOF-14.6 It is clear that the size and geometry of an inorganic or organic building block should affect the final framework structure. Another big challenge is how to rationally organize such inorganic and organic building blocks into a network with predictable topology.7 Thus, understanding the assembly process of MOFs becomes more and more important for the ideal “structural design”.1 In this work, a long trigonal bridging ligand tris[(4- carboxyl)phenylduryl]amine (L) is designed to investigate its assembly process with the metal ions. We report here an interesting microporous metal−L framework, namely, [Zn2(OH)L]·2DMF·2H2O (FIR-1; DMF = N,N′-dimethylfor- mamide, FIR denotes Fujian Institute of Research), which is solvothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The framework exhibits extraordinary assembly from a three-dimensional (3D) ths net to a 3D self-penetrating 3,5-connected net. Remarkably, FIR-1 has permanent porosity and shows high selectivity for the adsorption of CO2 over N2 at 0 °C and ambient pressure. Crystals of FIR-1 were prepared by the solvothermal reaction of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and H3L in DMF/EtOH/H2O (4:1:1, v/v) at 120 °C for 1 day.8 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that FIR-1 crystallized in the space group Pcca.9 In the structure of FIR-1, each L ligand links three Zn2(COO)3 units and each Zn2(COO)3 unit is bounded by three L ligands (Figure 1a). The L ligand looks like a propeller because the average dihedral angle between two duryl planes is 27.4° and that between the duryl plane and the outer phenyl plane is 66.4°. The central nitrogen atom of L exhibits sp2 hybridization, showing C−N−C average angles of 120.0° and unusually short N−C bond lengths (average 1.420 Å). Interesting bottom-up assembly of the 3-connected inorganic and organic building blocks leads to a 3D open-framework [Zn2(L)3]n n+ with 3-connected ths topology (Figure 1b). For such an empty framework, structural interpenetration is difficult to avoid. Actually, a IIIa-type 8-fold interpenetration of these ths-type frameworks is found in the whole structure by using the TOPOS program.10 However, the assembly does not stop here and the next net-to-net assembly occurs. Because each zinc ion in the structure of FIR-1 exhibits a tetrahedral coordination geometry with three carboxylate oxygen atoms and one μ2-OH−group, the Zn2(COO)3 units Received: December 18, 2011 Published: February 2, 2012 Figure 1.

Communication pubs.acs.org/IC © 2012 American Chemical Society 1995 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic202713e | Inorg. Chem. 2012, 51, 1995−1997 are further connected by the μ2-OH−groups into infinite chains along the a axis (Figure 1d). Through these μ2-OH−groups, four interpenetrating ths-type frameworks are coordinatively linked into one single framework with 3,5-connected self- penetrating topology (Figure 1c). Now each Zn2(COO)3 unit acts as a 5-connected node and the trigonal L ligand keeps its 3- connectivity. The resulting 3,5-connected net (denoted: hyp) derived from ths subnets has a vertex symbol (62.8)(66.82.102) and exhibits an interesting self-penetrating feature (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). To our knowledge, this new hyp topology is not been predicted before. The observation of such an unusual ths net to a hyp net assembly is mainly ascribed to the presence of the long L ligand, which creates a chance for interpenetration. Furthermore, the self-penetrating feature of the hyp net is much easy to identify because it is derived from the interpenetrating ths nets.11 This result may provide a new route toward the construction of a self-penetrating net through coordinative linking of some interpenetrating subnets. Because four ths nets assemble into one hyp net, eight ths nets in the whole structure make two interpenetrating hyp nets (Figure 1e). Despite the 2-fold interpenetration, the whole structure still has one-dimensional channels of effective window size 5 × 5 Å2 along the a axis. The solvent-accessible volume of FIR-1 is estimated by the PLATON program to be about 28.2% of the total crystal volume.12 The free spaces are occupied by the structurally disordered solvent molecules [two DMF and two H2O guest molecules per Zn2(OH)L unit, as evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); Figure S5 in the Supporting Information]. The TGA curve of FIR-1 reveals a weight loss of 3.87% at 120 °C, corresponding to the release of two H2O molecules (calcd 3.92%) per formula unit, followed by an additional weight loss of 16.25% at 120−250 °C, corresponding to two DMF guest molecules (calcd 15.89%), and no further weight loss up to 430 °C. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the guest-free sample (FIR-1-ht) activated at 150 °C for 7 h under vacuum maintains a high degree of crystallinity and is similar to that of the freshly synthesized material, implying that porosity is retained upon evacuation (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The permanent porosity of desolvated FIR-1 was established by reversible N2 sorption experiments at 77 K, which showed that it exhibited type I adsorption isotherm behavior typical of materials of microporosity (Figure 2a). Its Brunauer−Emmett− Teller and Langmuir surface areas are estimated to be 729.1 and 833.8 m2·g−1, respectively, and the Horvath−Kawazoe pore diameter is 8.8 Å (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). The measured pore volume (0.228 cm3·g−1) of FIR-1 from the N2 sorption is in agreement with the value of 0.227 cm3·g−1 calculated from the single-crystal structure. The H2 sorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K for desolvated FIR-1 were also investigated (Figure 2a). For FIR-1, the H2 uptake capacity reaches 143.5 cm3·g−1 (1.28 wt %) at 77 K and 1 atm, a value surpassing that of the most favorable zeolite ZSM-5 (0.7 wt %) and close to those of recently reported ZIFs.1c The H2 adsorption enthalpy (Qst) of FIR-1 calculated by the virial equation from the adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K is 6.7 kJ·mol−1. To evaluate the adsorption selectivity and capacity of FIR-1- ht, the adsorption/desorption isotherms of CO2 and N2 were also measured at 0 °C and room temperature. The CO2 uptake of FIR-1-ht at 273 and 298 K can reach 52.3 cm3·g−1 (2.34 mmol·g−1) and 27.7 cm3·g−1 (1.24 mmol·g−1), respectively (Figure 2b). The enthalpies of CO2 adsorption for FIR-1-ht were calculated by the virial equation from the adsorption isotherms measured at 273 and 298 K. At zero coverage, the CO2 adsorption enthalpy for FIR-1-ht is 21 kJ·mol−1. Although the CO2 uptake ability for FIR-1-ht is at a moderate level compared to that of some currently reported MOFs, it shows high CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity at ambient conditions. Under the same measurement conditions, it can hardly adsorb N2 (1.36 cm3·g−1 for FIR-1-ht at 273 K; Figure 2b). The maximal uptakes of CO2 and N2 at 273 K and 1 bar were used to estimate the adsorption selectivity for CO2 over N2. From these data, the calculated CO2/N2 selectivity is 38.5 at 273 K for FIR-1-ht. In summary, by employment of a predesigned tris[(4- carboxyl)phenylduryl]amine ligand (L) to assemble with the Zn2+ ion, a microporous Zn−L framework with an unusual structural assembly feature is presented here. An unusual 3D ths net to a 3D hyp net assembly is first evidenced by the 2- fold-interpenetrating framework FIR-1. Such a net-to-net assembly leads to a stable microporous framework with notable CO2/N2 separation capacity. The results reveal the potential application of the long tris[(4-carboxyl)phenylduryl]amine ligand upon the construction of functional microporous MOFs with interesting structural topologies for gas storage and separation.
