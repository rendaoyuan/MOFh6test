R. China * S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: We systematically studied the solvothermal reactions of transition-metal ions and H4abtc ligand and successfully isolated ﬁve metal−organic frameworks with various characterized tools, which are formulated as {[Mn2(abtc)(DMA)2.75]·1.25(DMA)}n (1), {[NH2(CH3)2]- [ C o 3 ( C O O H ) 2 . 5 ( a b t c ) ( H 2 O ) 2 ] 2 · H 2 O } n ( 2 ) , {[Zn3(abtc)1.5(DMF)3]·1.75(DMF)}n (3), {[Zn2(abtc)- (H2O)0.75(DMA)0.5]·3(DMA)·(H2O)}n (4), and {[Cd2(abtc)- (DMA)2]·2(DMA)}n (5), (H4abtc = 3,3′,5,5′-azobenzenete- tracarboxylic acid, DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide, and DMA = N,N-dimethylacetamide). 1−5 all consist of {Mn(CO2)4}- type clusters and H4abtc ligands; however, they exhibit four distinct architectures resulting from diﬀerent coordinated modes of H4abtc ligand. A pair of Mn2+ions in 1 forms a {Mn2(CO2)4} cluster, which further results in the “PtS”-type three-dimensional (3D) framework. In 2, three independent Co2+ ions are bridged by COOH−groups to aﬀord a {Co3} core, and {Co3} cores are connected by abtc2−to generate a “ZSW1”-type topology. Two types of {Zn2(CO2)4} secondary building units in 3 linked by abtc2−give the 3D “NbO”-type cage. When DMF is replaced by DMA and CH3OH, the scarce “nou”-type topology of 4 is obtained. And 5 is isomorphous to 1. Photoluminescence properties of 1−5 were characterized. Magnetic measurements demonstrate that dominant antiferromagnetic interactions exist in 1 and 2. In addition, 3 exhibits signiﬁcant adsorption capability of CO2 and highly selective sorption of CO2 over N2. ■INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, the construction of metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) has attracted immense interest because of the intriguing architectures1 as well as the potential applications in gas separation and storage,2 chemical sensors,3 catalysis,4 and magnetism.5 To acquire the above purposes, MOFs are expected to have high surface area, large pore size, and high stability. A usual approach for improving the above applications is to introduce linear extension of the rigid bridges to assemble robust frameworks. Nevertheless, employing longer linkers to construct porous MOFs could tend to form interpenetration structures, which decrease the porosity and the void available.1 Therefore, introducing highly symmetrical organic linkers and suitable metal ions to form porous MOFs with special topologies is of great interest.1 On the other hand, secondary building units (SBUs) are usually introduced for modularly constructing porous MOFs since they can readily design and predict the ﬁnal molecular structures. Especially, {M2(CO2)4}- type paddlewheel SBUs are extensively served for the preparation of porous MOFs, which could be generated by reacting transition metal (M2+) ions and appropriate carboxylic ligands under the solvothermal conditions.1,6 From this point, the topological concept is an available implement for understanding and further handling the elusive MOFs, which has been widely applied to construct the desired MOFs illustrated by suitable linkers for forming abundant MOFs with various topologies (nbo, pts, pcu, dia, cds, srs, etc.).7 In previous investigations, the multidentate organic aromatic polycarboxylate ligands, such as 1,3-benzenedicarboxylate,8a 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate,8b biphenyl-3,4′,5-tricarboxylate,8c and 3,3′,5,5′-biphenyltetracarboxylate,8d have been proven to be useful linkers in the preparation of MOFs with expectant topologies ascribed to their diverse coordinated modes.8 In contrast, 3,3′,5,5′-azobenzene-tetracarboxylic acid (H4abtc), as one kind of connective aromatic tetracarboxylate ligand, possesses many advantages to inspire our research interests:6,9 (i) The azo bond is well-known photochromic group that could reverse its isomerization between cis and trans states upon irradiation and other conditions.10 (ii) The rigid H4abtc ligand with a longer organic backbone has four carboxyl groups, being easily partially or completely deprotonated to adopt various acidity-dependent binding modes and geometrical conﬁgura- tions to improve the thermal stability and rigidity of the products.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX systems including aromatic rings are beneﬁcial to exploit luminescence materials. On the basis of the above considerations and our previous work, H4abtc is chosen to elaborate new MOFs. By adjusting the types of M2+ ions and the solvents and/or reaction temperature by solvothermal methods, we herein report the syntheses and structures of ﬁve three-dimensional (3D) MOFs, namely, {[Mn2(abtc)(DMA)2.75]·1.25(DMA)}n (1), {[NH2(CH3)2][Co3(COOH)2.5(abtc)(H2O)2]2·H2O}n (2), {[Zn3(abtc)1.5(DMF)3]·1.75(DMF)}n (3), {[Zn2(abtc)- (H2O)0.75(DMA)0.5]·3(DMA)(H2O)}n (4) and {[Cd2(abtc)- (DMA)2]·2(DMA)}n (5), (DMF = N,N-dimethylform-amide, DMA = N, N-dimethylacetamide). 1−5 are all constructed by {Mn(CO2)4}-type SBUs and abtc2−ligands; however, they present four distinct structures resulting from diﬀerent coordinated modes of abtc2−ligands. A pair of Mn2+ centers in 1 forms a {Mn2(CO2)4} cluster, and adjacent {Mn2(CO2)4} clusters further result in the 3D network with “PtS”-type topological structure via the abtc2−linkers. In 2, three crystallographically independent Co2+ ions are bridged by COOH−groups to aﬀord a {Co3} core, and the {Co3} cores are linked by abtc2−ligands to present the 3D framework with a new “ZSW1”-type topological structure. Two types of paddlewheel-shaped {Zn2(CO2)4} cluster SBUs in 3 linked by abtc2−ligands give the 3D “NbO”-type cage. Unlike 3, when DMF is replaced by DMA and CH3OH, the scarce “nou”-type topological architecture of 4 is obtained. And 5 displays the same topology structure as 1. The solid-state photolumines- cence properties of 1−5 were examined. Furthermore, variable- temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements of 1 and 2 were studied. In addition, gas sorption and separation of 3 was evaluated as well. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Methods and Materials. The H4abtc ligand was prepared according to the previous report developed by Ameerunisha et al. for 4,4′-azobenzoic acid11 and was further characterized by 1H NMR. Other reagents were used without further treatment. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were measured on a PerkinElmer 2400- IICHNS/O analyzer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted on a Labsys NETZSCH TG 209 Setaram apparatus under a N2 atmosphere from 25 to 800 °C with the rate of 10 °C· min−1. The emission spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrophotometer. The solid-state UV−vis spectra were recorded with a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer at the ambient temperature. PXRD spectra were performed on a Rigaku Ultima IV instrument with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540 56 Å), in the range 2θ = 3−60° with the scan speed of 10° min−1. Magnetic data were measured on a Quantum Design SQUID VSM magnetometer. Diamagnetic corrections were taken with sample holder and Pascal’s constants. The 1H NMR spectrum was tested on a Mercury Vx-300 NMR spectrometer. Synthesis of {[Mn2(abtc)(DMA)2.75]·1.25(DMA)}n (1).

Single-crystal data for 1−5 were obtained on an Oxford SuperNova diﬀractometer with graphite monochromatic Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.710 73 Å) at 128 K. Routine Lorentz polarization and empirical absorption corrections were used. The structures were resolved by direct methods and reﬁned by full−matrix least-squares methods on F2 with the SHELXTL-97 program package.12 Anisotropic thermal parameters were assigned to all non- H atoms. Positions of H atoms linked to C and N atoms were geometrically placed. All H atoms were reﬁned isotropically as a riding mode using the default parameters. The disorder DMA, DMF, and [NH2(CH3)2]+ molecules were geometrically restrained. For 1, the C, N, and O atoms from two coordinated DMA molecules and two free DMA molecules display positional disorders, and the relative ratios for C21−C25, C22−C26, C23−C27, C24−C28, N4−N5, and O8−O9 are reﬁned to 0.5/0.5; C29−C33, C30−C34, C36−C32, C35−C31, N6−N7, O11−O10, and C38−C39, C40−C41, C42−C43, and O14− O15 are reﬁned to 0.5/0.25; C45−C48, C46−C50, N9−N10, and O16−O17 are reﬁned to 0.25/0.25, respectively. In the case of 2, one C atom from the [NH2(CH3)2]+ molecule presents positional disorder, and the relative ratio for C21−C22 is reﬁned to 0.25/0.25. For 3, C and N atoms from a coordinated DMF molecule show positional disorders, and the relative ratios for C27−C28, C1A−C31, and N5−N6 are reﬁned to 0.667/0.333. For 4, one O atom from a coordinated DMA shows positional disorder, and the relative ratio for O9−O10 is reﬁned to 0.2/0.3. Although the electron densities of some guest solvents were detected, attempts to deﬁne the highly disordered guests were unsuccessful. As a result, the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON13 was applied to remove the diﬀraction contribution from guests to give a set of solvent-free diﬀraction intensities. SQUEEZE estimated a total count of 322 electrons per unit cell. According to the ﬁnal formula, which was calculated from elemental analyses and TG analyses, these electrons were assigned to be three DMF and one H2O molecules. As for 5, a large amount of spatially delocalized electron density in the lattice is found from which two half-dissociated DMA solvent molecules could be identiﬁed. However, the remaining electron density is seriously disordered, and attempts to ﬁx the half DMA are unsuccessful. Thus, the ﬁnal numbers of the solvent are conﬁrmed by element analyses and TG analyses. The ﬁnal formulas of 1−5 were checked by combining single-crystal data, elemental analyses, and TG analyses. The crystallographic data and structural reﬁnements for 1−5 are gathered in Table1. Additional crystallo- graphic data are available in the Supporting Information. Low-Pressure Sorption Experiments. All gas-sorption measure- ments were evaluated on a Quantachrom IQ2 automatic volumetric instrument. All gases applied were of 99.999% purity. The as-prepared 3 was immersed in CH2Cl2 for 3 d and then degassed at 75 °C for 12 h on degassing station to remove the guest molecules. Large bulb cell (9 mm, from Quantachrome) was loaded with degassed sample of 476 mg to use for gas-sorption experiments. The CO2 sorption isotherm at 195 K was recorded using a dry ice/acetone bath in the pressure range of 10−3−1 bar. And the CO2 and N2 sorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K were tested in a temperature-controlled water bath in the pressure range from 10−3 to 1 bar. To evaluate the adsorption selectivity abilities of 3 toward diﬀerent gases between CO2 and N2, the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST)14 selectivity is calculated based on the single gas adsorption data. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structural Descriptions. The as-synthesized PXRD patterns for 1−5 are in good agreement with the simulated PXRD patterns from the single-crystal data, indicating high phase purity for 1−5 (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The diﬀerent intensity may be attributed to the variation in preferred orientation of samples. Besides, bond-valence sum calculations15 suggest that all Mn ions in 1 and Co ions in 2 are in the +2 oxidation states, respectively. X-ray crystallographic analysis demonstrates that 1 belongs to the monoclinic space group P21/c, with two independent Mn ions, one abtc4−ligand, 2.75 coordinated DMA molecules, and 1.25 free DMA molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 1a), giving rise to the formula {[Mn2(abtc)(DMA)2.75]·1.25- (DMA)}n (1). Mn1 adopts six-coordinated distorted octahedral geometry with six O from three carboxylate groups of four abtc4−ligands: two bidentate and one chelating/bridging tridentate [Mn−O: 2.093(2)−2.491(2) Å] (Figure 1b). Mn2 displays the same geometry as that of the Mn1, which is deﬁned by three terminal O of DMA molecules [Mn−O: 2.105(2)− 2.188(8) Å], while the other three O are from three abtc4− Figure 1.

Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/ic502488c Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX C ligands [Mn−O: 2.137(2)−2.197(2) Å] (Figure 1c). Mn1 and Mn2 ions are connected by abtc4−ligands to give {Mn2(CO2)4} clusters, with the distance of Mn ··· Mn being 3.479 Å. The isophthalate group of the abtc4−ligand acts as a tetrakis- (monodentae) linker, which is bound to each side to two {Mn2(CO2)4} clusters through the carboxylate O in a syn−syn conﬁguration producing one-dimensional (1D) chains that run parallel to the a and b axes, respectively. The abtc4−ligand is coplanar and serves as a rectangular building unit. Each abtc4− is surrounded with four {Mn2(CO2)4} clusters, and each {Mn2(CO2)4} cluster is connected by four abtc4−ligands, which extend inﬁnitely to generate the 3D framework. There are open rectangular channels of approximately 10.0 × 10.2 Å along the c axis (Figure 1d), which are occupied by 2.75-coordinated DMA molecules and 1.25 free DMA molecules, as established by combining single-crystal structures, elemental analyses, and TG analyses. The void volume for 1 with and without coordinated DMA is 32.1% and 65.3% (excluding free DMA molecules), respectively, as calculated by PLATON.13 To know the structure of 1 more clearly, the topology of 1 is acquired by using the freely available program TOPOS.16 If the H4abtc ligands act as linkers and the {Mn2(CO2)4(DMA)2.75} clusters serve as four-connected nodes, the 3D framework of 1 can be presented as a (4, 4)-connected PtS-type topology (Figure 2). The solvothermal reaction of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and H4abtc in the mixed solvent of DMF/H2O generates red block crystals of 2. Complex 2 belongs to the orthorhombic space group Pnna. The structural unit of {[NH2(CH3)2][Co3(COOH)2.5- (abtc)(H2O)2]2·H2O}n (2) consists of two {Co3} cores, one abtc4−ligand, 2.5 COOH−groups, two coordinated H2O molecules (Figure 3a), two [NH2(CH3)2]+ ions, and one free H2O molecule. Three independent Co ions present six- coordinated distorted octahedral geometries (Supporting Information, Figure S2). Co1 is arranged by three O from two abtc4−ligands; two O are from two COOH−groups, and one O is from a water molecule [Co−O: 2.020(4)−2.192(4) Å]. The Co2 ion is bonded to four O from four abtc4−ligands and two O from two COOH−groups [Co−O: 2.046(4)− 2.196(4) Å], while the coordinated environment of Co3 is similar to that of Co1, being surrounded by three O from two abtc4−ligands, two O from two COOH−groups and one O from a water molecule [Co−O: 2.043(5)−2.212(3) Å]. Interestingly, Co1 and Co2 via an edge-sharing mode and Co2 and Co3 through a vertex-sharing mode form the {Co3} cluster. To the best of our knowledge, this type of {Co3} cluster has not been reported, which is signiﬁcantly distinguished from the linear trimer and triangular cluster documented.9d,17 Adjacent trimeric {Co3} clusters can be linked by COOH− groups to produce the {Co6} dimers (Figure 3b), further resulting in the 1D helical chain (Figure 3c). Adjacent chains are bridged by abtc4−ligands to produce the 3D framework (Figure 3d). Topologically, each {Co3} cluster acts as a six-connected node, while the H4abtc ligand serves as a linker; the 3D structure of 2 can act as a (4, 6)-connected topology with the Schläﬂi symbol of {3·45}{32·42·64·77} (Figure 3e), which is a new topology named as ZSW1.16 In the case of {[Zn3(abtc)1.5(DMF)3]·1.75(DMF)}n (3), it belongs to the monoclinic space group I2/c. The asymmetric unit contains three independent Zn ions, 1.5 abtc4−ligands, three coordinated DMF molecules (Figure 4a), and 1.75 free DMF molecules. Three independent Zn ions exhibit ﬁve- coordinated square pyramid geometries (Supporting Informa- tion, Figure S3). Zn1 and Zn2 ions in 3 are connected by four bridging carboxylates to produce a paddlewheel-shaped {Zn2(CO2)4} SBU, while Zn3 and its symmetric ion generate another paddlewheel {Zn2(CO2)4} SBU. Each paddlewheel {Zn2(CO2)4} SBU is connected by four carboxylate groups from four diﬀerent abtc4−ligands, and each Zn ion is also bound to a DMF molecule at the axial site of the paddlewheel SBU. Interestingly, six abtc4−ligands bridge six pairs of Figure 2. (left, center) A schematic view of the (4, 4)-connected net for PtS-type topology framework presented by 1. (right) The tiling.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX D {Zn2(CO2)4} SBUs to generate an octahedral cage with a cavity with a diameter of ca. 13.0 Å (Figure 4b), which is ﬁlled with coordinated and uncoordinated DMF molecules and thus reduce the space available. Adjacent cages are further connected by abtc4−ligands, leading to an extended NbO-type 3D network (Figure 4c−e). Since 3 is noninterpenetrated, high void can be promised. The solvent-accessible volume is 23.3%, calculated using PLATON,13 whereas the void volume of 3 with and without coordinated DMF is 45.9% and 66.4% (except the free DMF molecules), respectively, as estimated by PLATON.13 When DMF solvent for the synthesis of 3 is replaced with DMA and CH3OH, pure yellow strip crystals {[Zn2(abtc)- (H2O)0.75(DMA)0.5]·3(DMA)(H2O)}n (4) are harvested. X-ray single-crystal diﬀraction analysis indicates that 4 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c. The asymmetric unit contains of two independent Zn ions, one abtc4−ligand, 0.5- coordinated DMA, and 0.75-coordinated H2O molecules (Figure 5a), as well as three free DMA molecules and one free H2O molecule. The H2O molecules observed in the structure might come from the highly hydroscopic Zn(NO3)2· 6H2O salts. Two independent Zn ions exhibit diﬀerent coordinated geometries. Five-coordinated Zn1 atom displays a trigonal bipyramid geometry with ﬁve O from four carboxylate groups of four abtc4−ligands: three bidentate and one chelating linkers [Zn−O: 1.939(4)−2.396(3) Å] (Support- ing Information, Figure S4a), whereas Zn2 ion exhibits a six- coordinated distorted octahedral geometry (Supporting In- formation, Figure S4b), which is deﬁned by three O from three bidentate abtc4−ligands, one O from DMA and two O from water molecules [Zn−O: 1.927(5)−2.327(2) Å]. A pair of Zn ions are connected by four diﬀerent carboxylates of four i n d e p e n d e n t a b t c 4 − l i n k e r s , g e n e r a t i n g t h e {Zn2(CO2)4(H2O)0.75(DMA)0.5} SBU, which is further con- nected by abtc4−linkers to give the 3D structure (Figure 5b). From the topological point of view, taking the {Zn2(CO2)4(H2O)0.75(DMA)0.5} SBU as four-connected node and H4abtc ligands as linkers, the 3D structure of 4 can be shown as a (4, 4, 4)-connected network with the Schläﬂi symbol of {4·65}2{42·84}{64·82} (Figure 5c,d), which corre- sponds to nou-type topology and is rare for 3D CPs.16 {[Cd2(abtc)(DMA)2]·2(DMA)}n (5) is isomorphous to 1, and the structure skeleton of 5 is similar to that of 1, except for the numbers of coordinated and free DMA molecules. All ﬁve complexes are prepared by reactions of M2+ ions and H4abtc ligands under solvothermal conditions. According to the above structural analyses, it can be known that the bridged modes of abtc2−ligands (Scheme 1) and the coordination geometries of metal ions are diﬀerent in ﬁve complexes, which results in the diverse structures of the ﬁve compounds. Generally, the circuit symbols Schläﬂi (vertex) notations could be taken to present topologies and promote comparison of structures of distinct components.16 Since 1 and 5 are isomorphous, only 1 is taken for comparison here. Topological analyses of 1−4 by checking the schematic presentations of their chemical connectivity facilitate the depiction and contrast of four diﬀerent 3D MOFs. 1, 3, and 4 contain the {M2(CO2)4} SBU and H4abtc ligands; each abtc4−ligand acts as a rectangular building block and is linked with four {M2(CO2)4} SBU, and each {M2(CO2)4} SBU is connected Figure 4.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX E by four abtc4−ligands. Because abtc4−ligands adopt diﬀerent coordinated modes (Scheme 1), various topological structures are presented in these three compounds. For 2, three independent Co ions are connected by four abtc4−ligands to give {Co3(CO2)4} SBU. Each {Co3(CO2)4} cluster is bridged by six rectangular abtc4−ligands, and each abtc4−linker is embraced with four {Co3(CO2)4} clusters, which extends inﬁnitely to generate the (4,6)-net 3D framework. UV−vis Spectra and Photoluminescence Properties. The solid-state UV−vis spectra of 1−5 are recorded in the crystalline state at ambient temperature (Supporting Informa- tion, Figure S5a). The UV−vis spectra of 1−5 all exhibit three broad absorption bands centered at ca. 290, 350, and 460 nm, respectively. The observed main peaks may be attributed to the ligand-based π →π* or n →π* transitions including the −N N−based π →π* transition. Similar phenomena have been encountered for earlier MOFs prepared containing azo groups.18 For 2, besides the three absorption bands centered at ca. 290, 350, and 460 nm, the band at ca. 685 nm can be assigned as the d−d transition of CoII ion. In contrast, the UV− vis spectrum of the free H4abtc ligand presents three analogous broad bands at ca. 279, 341, and 455 nm, respectively (Supporting Information, Figure S5a). The coordination of H4abtc ligand to the metal ion does not seem to aﬀect these ligand-speciﬁc transitions in 1−5 substantially except for some minor shifts. MOFs with a d10 conﬁguration (such as Zn2+ and Cd2+) have been proven to present photoluminescent properties, and the conjugated π systems including aromatic rings are suitable for the exploitation of photoluminescent materials.3,9e,f In the case of 3−5, the abtc4−ligand, which has π-conjugated systems that simultaneously bind with the d10 center metals, may be excellent candidate for ﬂuorescent materials. As a result, the solid-state photoluminescence properties of 3−5 were charac- terized at ambient temperature on powered sample (Support- ing Information, Figure S5b). 3−5 all exhibit obvious photoluminescence with two maximum emissions at ca. 395 and 493 nm upon excitation at 310 nm, whereas the free H4abtc ligand presents similar emissions at ca. 388 and 493 nm (λ = 310 nm). The results suggest that these emission bands of 3−5 are neither ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) nor metal- to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) in nature because Zn2+ and Cd2+ ions are tough to reduce or to oxidize due to their d10 conﬁguration but rather could be chieﬂy attributed to an intraligand emission state, which is similar to previous reports.9e,f To verify the results, the emission spectra of 1 and 2 were also examined at the same conditions. As depicted in Figure S5b, both 1 and 2 show similar luminescence signs with the emission bands at ca. 393 and 493 nm, which further demonstrates that the emissions signs are derived from π →π* and/or n →π* transitions of the H4abtc ligand. The emissions of 1−5 are quite similar as the free ligand transitions; however, the intensities of 1−5 are much weaker than the free ligand, which is attributable to the variation of M2+ and the coordination geometries around them since the luminescence behavior is closely related to M2+ centers and the ligands bridged to them.9e,f These observations indicate that 1−5 could ﬁnd applications as potential ﬂuorescent porous materials. In addition, the expected emission signals coming from the vibronic characters of Zn2+ and Cd2+ ions are not detected and are hidden by the emission spectra of the organic ligands containing azo function groups in the region of 400−700 nm, which has also been encountered in our previous work.10 Magnetic Properties. The direct-current (dc) magnetic susceptibility measurements of 1 and 2 are recorded in the range of 1.8−300 K at an applied magnetic ﬁeld of 1000 Oe, as shown in Figure 6. For 1, the eﬀective χMT per two Mn2+ ions is 8.82 cm3·K· mol−1 at 300 K, which is close to the spin-only value of two uncoupled high-spin Mn2+ ions (8.76 cm3·K·mol−1, 6S5/2, g = 2).19 As the temperature is decreased, χMT decreases smoothly from 300 to 60 K, then decreases dramatically and reaches the minimum value of 0.32 cm3·K·mol−1 at 1.8 K (Figure 6); the decrease in χMT may be ascribed to the antiferromagnetic interaction between adjacent Mn2+ ions. As described in the crystal structures part, adjacent Mn2+ ions are connected by a COO−group to the {M2(CO2)4} SBU, and the Mn2+···Mn2+ distance is 3.479 Å, much shorter than the distances between adjacent two Mn2+ ions bridged by two COO−groups of the isophthalate group of the abtc4−ligand (longer than 8.28 Å). Scheme 1. 1 and 5: (a), (b); 2: (c); 3: (a), (d); 4: (a), (e)a aCoordination modes of abtc2−ligands are observed in 1−5. Figure 6.

Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/ic502488c Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX F And the single-ion zero-ﬁeld splitting D and rhombic splitting parameter E for Mn2+ ion are small and could be ignored.19 Therefore, we tried to interpret this magnetic system of 1 by use of the Heisenberg−Dirac−Van Vleck SA = SB = 5/2 spin- coupled dimer model (H = −JSASB).20 χ β ′ = Ng kT A B 2 M 2 2 (1) = + + + + A e e e e e 5 14 30 55 x x x x x 3 6 10 15 = + + + + + B e e e e e 1 3 5 7 9 11 x x x x x 3 6 10 15 In eq 1, N, β, k, and g have their default meanings, x = J/kT, and J is the exchange coupling constant within the adjacent Mn2+ dimer bridged by the same COO−group. A molecular ﬁeld (zJ′)21 representing intrachain Mn2+ ions magnetic interactions was added as needed to the actual essence of complex 1. Therefore, the equation for the magnetic susceptibility of 1 becomes χ χ χ β = ′ − ′ zJ Ng /[1 2 / ] M M M 2 2 (2) The best least-squares ﬁt parameters are g = 2.04, J = −2.44 cm−1, zJ′ = −0.23 cm−1, and R = ∑[(χMT)obsd −(χMT)calcd]2/ ∑[(χMT)obsd]2 = 3.97 × 10−7. The negative J value suggests the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction within the Mn2+ dimer, and the zJ′ value also indicates weakly antiferromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, the curve of χM −1 versus T in the range of 20−300 K obeys the Curie−Weiss law with C = 9.34 cm3·K·mol−1 and θ = −16.56 K (Supporting Information, Figure S6), which further supports the occurrence of a weak antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent Mn2+ ions in 1. For 2, the observed χMT value at room temperature is 17.84 cm3·K·mol−1 at 300 K, being larger than the spin-only value of six uncoupled high-spin Co2+ ions (11.22 cm3·K·mol−1, 4F9/2, g = 2), which can be ascribed to the obvious orbital contribution of six-coordinated Co2+ ion and is well-known to be pronounced in octahedral ﬁeld. Such phenomenon has been continually encountered in previously reported Co-containing compounds.22 The χmT steadily decreases with decreasing temperature to reach a minimum value of 3.46 cm3·K·mol−1 at 1.8 K (Figure 7). The decrease of χMT value could be attributed to the antiferromagnetic interaction and/or zero-ﬁeld splitting (ZFS) eﬀects.22 The curve of χM −1 versus T above 50 K can be ﬁtted by the Curie−Weiss law, to give C = 19.18 cm3·K·mol−1 and θ = −21.99 K (Supporting Information, Figure S7); the large and negative θ value imply the existence of antiferro- magnetic coupling in 2.22 According to the crystal structure of 2, the trimeric {Co3} cluster is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the linear trimer and triangular cluster documented,9d,17 which can be linked by COOH−groups to produce the {Co6} dimers. Therefore, it is hard to model the magnetic behavior in the complicated system by deducing an exact expression including J parameter even if the orbital contribution of Co2+ ion is neglected. However, it can be conﬁrmed by a poor ﬁt to an equation for Co2+ ion with ground state of 4T1g. Instead, the data can be well-ﬁtted by using an expression χM = 6χCo for S = 3/2 system with dominant ZFS eﬀects.22 χ β = + + − − Ng kT e e 1 9 4(1 ) x x 2 2 2 2 (3) χ β = + − + ⊥ − − Ng kT e e 4 (1 ) 4(1 ) x x x 2 2 3 2 2 (4) χ χ χ ′ = + ⊥ 2 3 (5) χ χ χ = ′ − ′ β ′ ( ) 1 zJ Ng Co 2 2 2 (6) where g is the Lande value, x = D/kT, D is the magnitude of the ZFS, z is the number of neighbors, and J′ is the magnitude of the intermolecular interactions. The best least-squares ﬁt parameters are g = 2.55, D = 74.06 cm−1, zJ′ = −1.19 cm−1, and R = ∑[(χMT)obsd −(χMT)calcd]2/∑[(χMT)obsd]2 = 4.29 × 10−3, which further demonstrates that antiferromagnetic interaction exists between adjacent Co2+ ions, being in accordance with the previously reported value for S = 3/2 system with dominant ZFS eﬀects.22 The ﬁeld dependence of magnetization (M) for 1 and 2 was tested at 2 K in the range of 0−7 T (Supporting Information, Figure S8). The M values are 3.85 NμB for 1 and 12.23 NμB for 2, which are far from the saturation values of 10 NμB for 1 and 18 NμB for 2, respectively, further suggesting the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions between adjacent Mn2+ ions in 1 and Co2+ ions in 2.22 To further study the dynamics of magnetization, the temperature dependence of the alternating-current (ac) magnetic susceptibilities for 1 and 2 are collected at zero dc ﬁelds. Unfortunately, no out-of-phase signal is detected in 1 and 2 (Supporting Information, Figure S9). Gas Adsorption and Separation. Considering that 3 possesses vacant pores, we attempt to soak the crystals of 3 in the low-boiling point solvents so that the free DMF molecules can be exchanged. When soak the samples in CH2Cl2 for 3 d, the samples are crystalline. PXRD patterns show that the framework is retained before and after exchanging solvents, as well as the activated one and after the measure (Supporting Information, Figure S10). The activated 3 only displays external surface adsorption of N2 at 77 K. In contrast, CO2 adsorption measured at 195 K exhibits a fully reversible type-I isotherm with a high CO2 uptake (190 cm3·g−1) at 0.15 bar; subsequently, this value slowly but steadily increases to 209 cm3·g−1 at 1 bar, indicating Figure 7. Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility in the forms of χMT and χM vs T for 2 at an applied ﬁeld of 1000 Oe between 1.8 to 300 K. The red solid lines represent the best ﬁtting results. Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/ic502488c Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX G that 3 possesses the microporous nature (Figure 8a).23 The Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (SBET) and Langmuir surface (SLangmuir) areas of 3 based on the 195 K CO2 adsorption data are 847 and 876 m2·g−1, respectively. The CO2 sorption measurements for 3 at 273 and 298 K are also completely reversible and show the steep rise at the low- pressure region with uptake of 76.8 (15.1%) and 39.0 cm3·g−1 (7.7%) at 1 bar, respectively (Figure 8b). Comparatively, the N2 uptakes are 5.7 and 3.4 cm3·g−1 at 273 and 298 K (1 bar), respectively (Figure 8b). To better know these results, the adsorption enthalpies (Qst)24 of CO2 are counted from the adsorption data at 273 and 298 K by using both Clausius− Clapeyron equation and virial-type ﬁtting method to quantitatively assess the binding strengths between CO2 and the framework (Supporting Information, Figure S11). As expected, the Qst values at zero coverage are 34.7 and 28.8 kJ·mol−1 calculated by Clausius−Clapeyron equation and virial- type ﬁtting method for 3 (Figure 9a), suggesting strong interactions between CO2 and the framework. Comparably high Qst values have only been observed in few microporous materials.2a,23 The gas-selective adsorption capacity in MOFs could be achieved from single-component sorption data.2b,23 The CO2/ N2 (10/90) selectivity abilities in a binary mixture would be required for practical utility; these abilities are calculated by employing IAST14 method from the adsorption data of CO2 and N2 at 273 and 298 K (Supporting Information, Figure S12), respectively, as illustrated in Figure 9b. Calculated from the experimental data, the CO2/N2 selectivity abilities at zero coverage are approximately 171:1 and 58:1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively, which have obvious increases in the whole measured pressure range and achieve the maximum values at 1 bar with 280:1 and 65:1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, such high CO2/N2 selectivity ability has only been observed for a small number of MOFs (Supporting Information TableS1),2b,23 which suggests that the selective sorption ability of 3 is among the norm MOFs for probable applications in highly selective CO2 adsorption and the separation of CO2 from the mixtures of CO2 and N2. ■CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, ﬁve MOFs constructed by {Mn(CO2)4}-type SBUs and abtc4−ligands have been successfully synthesized via Figure 8.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX H solvothermal method, and they exhibit four distinct architec- tures resulting from diﬀerent coordinated modes of abtc4− ligands. 1 and 5 present the PtS-type 3D framework. Three independent Co2+ ions in 2 are bridged by COOH−groups to aﬀord a scarce {Co3} cluster, which further are bridged by abtc4−ligands to present the 3D network with a new ZSW1- type topological structure. 3 exhibits the 3D NbO-type cage, and 4 displays the uncommon nou-type topological architec- ture. The solid-state luminescence properties of 1−5 have been examined. The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that dominant antiferromagnetic inter- actions exist in 1 and 2. Meanwhile, 3 shows signiﬁcant adsorption capability of CO2 and highly selective sorption of CO2 over N2. Notice that the successful preparation of 1−5 illustrates the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of reaction conditions (such as the species of metal centers, the rate of the reactants, the reaction temperature, and solvent) on structures. The work provides a promising pathway to rational design and preparation of MOFs with polycarboxylic ligands, and further eﬀort is being devoted to construct functional MOFs with desired structures by other organic polycarboxylic ligands. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Illustrations of metal ion coordination environments, plot indicating temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility, PXRD patterns, TGA, spectroscopic characterizations, and magnetic and crystallographic data of MOFs 1−5.
