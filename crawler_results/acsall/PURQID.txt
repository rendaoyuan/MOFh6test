With similar reaction conditions, reactions of the same organic ligand with different metals selected from different blocks (d-block and f-block) result in different coordination modes of carboxylate groups and final frameworks of 1 and 2. It is interesting that pores in 1 and 2 exhibit different behaviors to sodium cation, showing unique properties of MOFs based on flexible ligands. Porouscoordinationpolymers(PCPs) ormetal-organicframe- works (MOFs) have attracted great interest recently for potential applications in adsorption separations, gas storage, sensing, ion exchange, and catalysis.1 As organic-inorganic hybrids, MOFs have the advantage of rational designing over conventional porous materials. The structure of MOFs can be tuned and controlled by adopting different organic ligands and metal cations.2 The use of rigid ligands thus far represents the most promising approach towardthesynthesisofporousMOFs,3,4wherethemostsuccessful ligands are rigid polycarboxylates. In recent years, 1,3-benzenedi- carboxylates (H2BDC), 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylates (H3BTC), and their derivates have produced many porous MOFs with metal ions,5,6 in which the most famous and successful MOFs are the series of MOF-n7 and MIL-n8 synthesized by the Yaghi and Ferey group, respectively. However, the rigid polycarboxylates connect metal ions in a changeless direction owing to their rigid backbones. For example, H2BDC links metal nodes in a V-shape, and H3BTC bridges metal ions in a triangle shape. Compared with rigid ligands, flexible ligands may connect metal ions in different directions depending upon the freedom of rotation and twist of flexible skeletons. This character of flexible ligands may lead to interesting MOFs with unique properties such as breathing ability and adaptive recognition properties,9 which interests us in the synthesis of porous MOFs by flexible ligands. However, the flexibility of the backbones makes it difficult to control the final coordination networks. So far, only a few porous MOFs based on flexible polycarboxylate ligands have been synthesized success- fully.9,10 It remains a challenge to construct porous MOFs by flexible ligands. Compared to flexible polycarboxylate ligands containing a benzene or cyclane ring, paraffinic polycarboxylates are more flexible without the restriction of any rings. Therefore, it is more attractive and difficult to adopt paraffinic polycarboxy- lates ligands to construct porous MOFs than other polycar- boxylates. Because of the flexibility, divergent coordination modes, connect directions, and potential high denticity, 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (H4BTCA) is a good candi- date among different paraffinic polycarboxylates ligands. Up to now, it has been used as a ligand by several groups,11,12 but most studies failed in constructing MOFs with channels and it is necessary to study more in this field. Thus, we chose H4BTCA as the organic ligand to synthesize MOFs in this paper. Besides ligands, the metal cation is another important factor affectingthe final frameworkofMOFs. Thus, wetry tosynthesize porous MOFs of H4BTCA by selecting different metal cations. Currently, metal cations used in the synthesis of MOFs are usually d-block transition metal cations. Porous MOFs based on flexible ligands and rare earth metal nodes have less been reported so far. This is probably due to high coordination numbers of such ions making it more difficult to control the structures of the products.13-15 To our best knowledge, no groups obtained porous MOFs from the reactions of both transition and rare earth metal with the same flexible ligands. To explore the effect of different metal cations on the construc- tion of MOFs based on flexible ligand, we choose Zn(II) and Ce(III) from the transition and actinium family to construct MOFs, respectively. As polycarboxylate ligand, H4BTCA has four carboxyl groups. For decreasing the difficulty in controlling the final structure, we used excess NaOH to ensure H4BTCA are com- pletely deprotonated in the synthesis of both 1 and 2. Higher reaction temperature may result in complicated coordination modes of carboxyl groups, so we adopted a diffusion method to minimize the uncontrollable factors in the synthesis of MOFs. Reaction of H4BTCA with Zn(NO3)2 and CeCl3 at ambient temperature affords crystals {[Zn2(BTCA)] 3 5H2O}n (1) and {[CeNa(BTCA)(H2O)3] 3 4H2O}n(2) (see Supporting Information). Thestructuresof1and2weredeterminedbyX-raycrystallography16 andwefoundthat1and2crystallizeinthemonoclinicP2/nandC2/c space group, respectively. There are two crystallographically independent zinc ions and two halves of BTCA4- in 1. Both zinc cations are four-coordi- nated by four carboxylate groups from four BTCA4-, and each zinc cation is in tetrahedral geometry. All carboxylate groups in 1 are deprotonated and adopt monodentate coordination mode, so each BTCA4- bridge four zinc atoms (Figure S1, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 1a, through sharing metal nodes with adjacent BTCA4-, the BTCA4- ligands are connected intoone-dimensional(1D) double-strandschainwithsquaregrid, which extend along two diagonals of [101] plane, respectively. Zinc cations are all in tetrahedral geometry as mentioned above, so two coordination sites of each zinc cation in each double- strand chain are left unoccupied. The double-strand chains along one diagonal of the [101] plane intersect the double-strand chains along the other diagonal of the [101] plane at each zinc node. This means the unoccupied coordination sites of zinc cations in double-strand chains along one direction are occupied by carboxylate groups in double-strand chains along the other *Authortowhomcorrespondenceshouldbeaddressed.E-mail:fengli_xtu@ hotmail.com.

Thus, two adjacent double-strand chains along two different directions share two zinc cations with each other. Through sharing zinc nodes, all double-strand chains along one direction are linked into a two-dimensional (2D) network (Figure 1b), and the 2D networks are extended into a three- dimensional (3D) framework with the double-strand chains extending to the other direction (Figure 3a). Such 3D framework contains square channels with a size of about 8  8 A˚ along the [010] direction, and each channel is formed by the intersection of four 2D networks (all diameters of pores or channels given in this paper are measured from the center of mass of each atom). In each 2D network, there are two kinds of pores (Figure 1b). Each smaller pore contains two zinc cations bridged by the first and the second carboxylate groups of one BTCA4-. The angle of C(1)-C(2)-C(g2) is about 110o (Figure S2, Supporting Infor- mation), which makes this pore looks like a square with a dimension of 5.3  4.2 A˚. Each bigger pore contains two square pore units, and two square units are linked by two BTCA4- using the first and third carboxylate groups. The angles of C(1)- C(2)-C(3) (114) and C2-C3-C(g3) (105) make the bigger pore look like hexagon (4.3  6.7  7.2 A˚), though they only contain four metal nodes. Two square units can be regarded as two double-edges of one hexagonal pore. In 1, each square pore captures two free water molecules (O3w and O5w), and each hexagonal pore captures three free water molecules (O1w, O2w, and O4w) by hydrogen bonds, respectively. X-ray crystallography analysis reveals that there are one Ce3þ cation, one Naþ cation, and two halves of BTCA4- in the unit cell of 2 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Similar to 1, Ce(III) is also coordinated by four carboxylate groups from four BTCA4-. However, both oxygen atoms of each carboxy- late group in 2 are coordinated to the same metal cation, which is different from the monodentate coordination mode of carboxylate group in 1. Considering two coordinated water molecules, Ce(III) is coordinated by 10 oxygen atoms, and in Figure 2.

Communication Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 2, 2010 477 distorted bicap dodecahedron coordination geometry. In 2, each BTCA4- link four Ce(III) nodes, and by sharing metal cations for each other, adjacent BTCA4- are connected into 1D double-strand chain along the [001] direction (Figure 2a). The double-strand chains in 2 are very similar to those in 1, so the size of square pore of double-strand chains in 2 is almost as same as that in 1. However, each square pore in 2 captures one sodium cation, and the square pores in 1 just capture two water molecules by hydrogen bonds. This means the sodium cations show selectivity to square pores in 1 and 2. There are two differences between the square pores in 1 and 2: (I) the metal cation is different; (II) the coordination mode of carboxylate groups is different. The different behaviors to sodium cation of the square pores in 1 and 2 may be due to the cooperative effect of two differences. Each sodium cation is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four carboxylate groups of two BTCA4- and two coordinated water molecules, so each sodium cation is in octahedron geometry. Six Ce(III) are connected by eight halves of BTCA4-, and form a hexagonal metal-organic ring with a diameter of 15 A˚ (Figure 2b). Among six edges of such a metal-organic ring, two of edges are double-edges containing two halves of BTCA4-, respectively. Actually, each double-edge is one square pore of double-strand chains. As shown in Figure 2b, all hexagonal metal-organic rings at the [110] plane are linked into 2D networks by sharing edges and metal nodes. With the extending of double-edges into double-strand chains along the [001] direction, the 2D networks at the [110] plane are extended into 3D MOFs with hexagonal channels (Figure 3b). The six walls of each hexagonal channel are not the same, in which two opposite walls are two double-strand chains, and the left four walls are in charge of bridging two double-strand chains into a hexagonal channel (the detailed bridge mode is shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information, two adjacent double-chains are bridged by BTCA4-, and formed three kinds of pores (pore A, B, and C). Pore A is the square pore in the double-strand chain as mentioned above, which contains eight carbon atoms and two metal nodes (about 4.5  6.8 A˚); pores B and C contains 10 carbon atoms and 2 Ce(III) nodes, and 4 Ce(III) nodes and 18 carbon atoms (about 7.6  11.9 A˚), respectively. Among three kinds of pores, only each pore A captures one sodium ion, and the other pores just capture free water molecules, which may be explained by the difference in size. Obviously, the size of square pores in 2 is suitable for forming Na-O bonds and capturing sodium cations. Results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for 1 and 2 are shown in Figure S4, Supporting Information. For 1, the first step is completed at about 385 C (19.1%), corresponding to the loss offree water molecules(calculated 20.0%). Uponfurther heating, the material undergoes rapid decomposition. For 2, the first step is completed at about 135 C, corresponding to the loss of four noncoordinated water molecules (13.6%). The second step is between 135 and 428 C, which corresponds to the three coordi- nated water molecules (10.2%). The total solvent loss is 23.8% (calculated 24.3%), and the final loss due to framework decom- position starts at 428 C. In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized and characteri- zed two porous MOFs from reactions of flexible polycarboxylate ligand (H4BTCA) with Zn(NO3)2 and CeCl3. The channels in 1 and 2 are square and hexagonal with dimensions of 8  8 A˚ and 15  15 A˚, respectively. To our best knowledge, it is the first time porous MOFs have been obtained by the same flexible polycar- boxylate and different metal cations selected from different blocks of the periodic table of elements (d-block and f-block). Furthermore, it is worth noting that pores in 1 and 2 show different behaviors to sodium cation, although we use NaOH adjust the pH value in the synthesis of both 1 and 2. Among different pores in 1 and 2, only the smallest square pores in 2 can trap sodium cations. Pores with bigger sizes in both 1 and 2 cannot capture sodium cations, and square pores in 1 similar to those in 2 cannot capture sodium cation either, showing a unique property of MOFs based on flexible ligands.
