We illustrate its applicability to rationalizing MOF crystal structures by analysis of nine new MOFs which have been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Tetrahedral SBUs in Zn(ADC)2‚(HTEA)2 (MOF-31), Cd(ATC)‚[Cd(H2O)6](H2O)5 (MOF-32), and Zn2(ATB)(H2O)‚ (H2O)3(DMF)3 (MOF-33) are linked into diamond networks, while those of Ni2(ATC)(H2O)4‚(H2O)4 (MOF- 34) have the structure of the Al network in SrAl2. Frameworks constructed from less symmetric tetrahedral SBUs have the Ga network of CaGa2O4 as illustrated by Zn2(ATC)‚(C2H5OH)2(H2O)2 (MOF-35) structure. Squares and tetrahedral SBUs in Zn2(MTB)(H2O)2‚(DMF)6(H2O)5 (MOF-36) are linked into the PtS network, which is the simplest structure type known for the assembly of these shapes. The octahedral SBUs found in Zn2(NDC)3‚[(HTEA)(DEF)(ClBz)]2 (MOF-37) form the most common structure for linking octahedral shapes, namely, the boron network in CaB6. New structure types for linking triangular and trigonal prismatic SBUs are found in Zn3O(BTC)2‚(HTEA)2 (MOF-38) and Zn3O(HBTB)2(H2O)‚(DMF)0.5(H2O)3 (MOF-39). The synthesis, crystal structure, and structure analysis using the SBU approach are presented for each MOF. Introduction Considerable effort has been devoted to the assembly of extended frameworks from molecular building blocks due to the advantages such an approach offers for the design of materials.1 However, controlling the orientation of building blocks in the solid state and thus prediction of the resulting structure remains a great challenge. We have found this to be especially true in our early efforts to build porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) from monodentate ditopic linkers such as 4,4′-bipyridine, where the flexible nature of the angles within the metal coordination sphere resulted in less predictable and more flexible framework topologies, ultimately leading to nonporous structures.2 We later focused on using multidentate carboxylate func- tionalities as they are known to be essential in chelating metal ions and locking their position into M-O-C clusters, a, which can act as rigid entities, referred to as secondary building units (SBUs).3 Consideration of the overall shape adopted by the points of extension in an SBU (for example, the carboxylate carbon atoms forming a square SBU in a) is useful in predicting the topology of MOFs that would result from polymerizing these shapes with polytopic organic linkers.4 * Correspondence author.

The successful application of this approach has had significant implications for the design of highly porous and robust MOF structures for which the rigidity of the SBUs made it possible to predict the topology.5 Here we illustrate, using nine new MOFs assembled from a diverse set of large organic linkers and divalent transition metal ions, that this strategy can be generally applied to understanding, deter- mining, and predicting new structure patterns and topologies of complex MOF structures. Although the compounds in this study have structures that offer promising host-guest chemistry and porosity, already investigated for other MOFs,6 our main focus here will be on understanding the structural aspects relating to their construction from SBUs. Experimental Section Synthesis of MOFs, Abbreviations, and General Procedures. For easy reference, the crystallographic data for MOFs are listed in Table 1. The organic carboxylates used in this study are shown in Chart 1. The inorganic and organic SBUs identified in the crystal structures of MOF-31-39 including their respective spacers and structure topologies are summarized in Table 2. Unless otherwise indicated, all pore diameter values were obtained by considering the van der Waals radii of atoms making up the pores. Typically, preparation of a MOF was performed by combining the metal(II) salt with the acid form of the organic carboxylate at room temperature under aerobic conditions or under solvo(hydro)thermal conditions in a closed stainless steel Parr Teflon-lined vessel (23 mL). In room-temperature syntheses, triethylamine was diffused into the solution mixture of reactants often in the presence of in mixed solvents. Preparations involving MOF-31 to MOF-37 were repeated at least three times and found to be fully reproducible. In contrast, the synthesis of MOF-38 and MOF-39 was found to be difficult to reproduce; nevertheless, the materials have been structurally characterized. All metal salts, solvents, and the organic acids H2ADC, H3BTC, and H2NDC were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals and used without further purification. The organic acids H4MTB, H4ATC, and H4ATB were prepared, respectively, according to published procedures.7-9 However, H3BTB was prepared by combination of 1,3,5-tris(methyl- phenyl)benzene (1.0 g, 2.87 mmol), concentrated HNO3 (1.5 mL), and water (6.0 mL) in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel which was heated to 170 °C for 24 h to give 1.1 g of H3BTB (86% yield). Zn(ADC)2‚(HTEA)2, MOF-31. Acetylenedicarboxylic acid (H2ADC; 0.092 g, 0.80 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2‚6H2O (0.118 g, 0.40 mmol) were dissolved in ethanol (20 mL) and placed in a vial that was then inserted in a larger vial containing triethylamine/ethanol (0.2 mL/4.0 mL).

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction Studies. Relevant parameters for data collection, structure solution, and refinement are assembled for MOF-31-39 in Table 1. Further details have been deposited as Supporting Information. Results and Discussion The structures of MOF-31-39 can be appreciated by considering that a vertex in a network, b, can be replaced by more than one vertex to give a decorated network, c, as it has been demonstrated for In10S186- extended framework in which In10S1810- units occupy the position of 4-connected C atoms in the diamond network.10 The new cluster of vertexes is referred to as a SBU. The special case when a vertex in an n-connected network is replaced by n vertexes is called augmentation, d. Frameworks with large pores can be realized if vertexes in a network are spaced apart by longer links to give expanded structures. It is useful to keep in mind that polytopic organic links can also function as decorated and/or expanded vertexes to produce organic SBUs:11 Thus, the 1,3,5-carbon atoms in BTC and in the central benzene ring of BTB (Table 2) decorate a 3-connected vertex, because these atoms form a triangular SBU that can be linked to other shapes. The 2-connected benzoate rings in BTB space apart the central benzene ring from the carboxylate carbon atoms; thus, BTB is considered an expanded version of BTC. Our description of MOF-31-39 structures is facilitated by recognizing that the carboxylate carbon atoms in each structure represent points of extension in the same manner discussed for the paddle-wheel cluster in a. Thus, for a given MOF, the M-O-C cluster connectivity and the organic links are inspected and considered for determination of the shape of their respective SBUssan important step in recognizing the topology of that MOF structure (Table 2). In this regard, we have recently emphasized thatsfor the assembly of frameworks from sym- metric shapessonly a small number of simple, high-symmetry structures will be of oVerriding general importance, and they would be expected to form most commonly.4 In this report, we show that this thesis coupled with the SBU strategy can be employed as a predictive tool especially in cases where specific SBUs can be designed and synthesized. In the discussion that follows, we analyze nine new MOF structures to reveal how organic and inorganic SBUs play a crucial role in the application of these principles to the design and synthesis of MOFs. We will also show that SBUs with less symmetric and uncommon shapes can lead to new structure types. Tetrahedral Frameworks. Copolymerization of ADC with Zn2+ gives MOF-31 whose crystal structure is constructed from tetrahedral zinc centers linked by acetylene units (Table 2, Figure 1a-c). Each zinc is bound in a disordered monodentate fashion to four different ditopic ADC linkers to give two interpenetrating diamond networks with triethylammonium (HTEA) counterions (not shown) filling pores of 8 Å diameter. Although this is a simple structure, its description using SBUs is illustrative: The four carboxylate C atoms in each Zn(CO2)4 unit represent a tetrahedral inorganic SBU (Figure 1b) that augments the C vertex in the diamond network, while the acetylene (CtC) links space apart such SBUs to give an augmented-expanded interpenetrating framework (Figure 1c). When adamantane is used instead of acetylene, a framework (MOF-32) with inorganic and organic SBUs is produced (Table 2, Figure 1d-f). Here, the relatively larger size of Cd2+ compared to Zn2+ allows for the carboxylates to bind in a bidentate fashion. Thus, each cadmium center is connected to four carboxylates of four independent ATC links (Figure 1d). Note that the adamantane represents an organic tetrahedral SBU and the carboxylate carbons of each Cd(CO2)4 unit encompass an inorganic tetrahedral SBU (Figure 1e). These SBUs are linked to each other by sharing vertexes to produce an augmented diamond network (Figure 1f). Interpenetration is not observed here because the shortest distance across the pores (4 Å) is significantly lower than the diameter of an adamantane unit (7 Å), which would be required to fit in that space for interpenetra- tion to be possible. Instead, the void space is filled by one Cd(H2O)62+ counterion and five free water molecules per formula unit. ATC can be functionalized to produce its expanded analogue ATB, which when copolymerized with Zn2+ gives (MOF-33), a network that again has the diamond topology (Table 2, Figure 1g-i). In this structure, each pair of Zn atoms is bridged by a water and two carboxylates that bind in a dimonodentate fashion (Figure 1g). Each Zn center is further linked by one bidentate carboxylate to produce a complex cluster arrangement in which consideration of only the carboxylate carbon atoms reveals that it is a tetrahedral SBU (Figure 1h). In contrast to MOF-32, this SBU is spaced from the tetrahedral adamantane SBU by 2-connected benzene units to give a decorated-expanded structure of 2-interpenetrating frameworks having several chan- nels of 5 × 9 Å2 dimension that are filled with three water and three DMF molecules per formula unit (Figure 1i). Although the shapes of SBUs in MOF-31 and 32 and thus their diamond topology were not unexpected, prediction of the inorganic SBU in MOF-33 would have been more challenging; nevertheless, being able to recognize it as a tetrahedral SBU allows rationalization of the resulting structure. Analysis of MOF-34 and -35 structures using the SBU approach showed that they have two common tetrahedral networks, namely, the networks of the Al atoms in SrAl2 and the Ga atoms in CaGa2O4, respectively (Table 2, Figure 2).12 Both compounds were prepared by linking ATC with either Ni2+ (10) (a) Li, H.; Laine, A.; O’Keeffe, M.; Yaghi, O.

T.; O’Keeffe, M.; Yaghi, O. M. Science 2001, 291, 1021-1023. The idea of using extended groups to expand nets was clearly recognized in the work of Kinoshita, Y.; Matsubara, I.; Higuchi, T.; Saito, Y. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1959, 32, 1221, and is extensively discussed by Wells, A. F. Three-Dimensional Nets and Polyhedra, Wiley: New York, 1977. Other examples are to be found in ref 1. (12) O’Keeffe, M.; Hyde, B. G.

Soc., Vol. 123, No. 34, 2001 8243 (MOF-34) or Zn2+ (MOF-35) to produce frameworks based on linking of the tetrahedral adamantane SBU with dimeric metal carboxylate clusters. In MOF-34, two Ni centers are bridged by a water oxygen and two carboxylates that are bound in a dimonodentate fashion (Figure 2a). An additional two carbox- ylates are bound (one in a bidentate and the other in a monodentate fashion) to only one of the Ni centers. The other Ni center instead has an additional three terminal water ligands. We follow the reasoning expressed above in order to understand the topology of the MOF-34 framework: The carboxylate carbon atoms are vertexes to a tetrahedral SBU composed of Ni2(CO2)4 and the adamantane represents the other SBU (Figure 2b). These SBUs are linked together to form a 4-connected network that represents a decorated version of the Al network in the SrAl2 structure (Figure 2c)san arrangement that supports a 3-D channel system of 5 × 8 Å2 dimension in which four water molecules reside as guests. On the other hand, the dimeric clusters in MOF-35 are composed of two Zn centers that are bridged by three carbox- ylates bound in a dimonodentate fashion with one Zn having an additional monodentate carboxylate, while the other Zn is bound by an additional ethanol as a terminal ligand (Figure 2d). Again, the carboxylate C atoms form a tetrahedral SBU that shares its vertexes with the adamantane tetrahedral SBU (Figure 2e) and give a decorated form of the network defined by Ga in CaGa2O4 (Figure 2f). One ethanol and two water guests per formula unit occupy internal diameter cavities of 5 Å in diameter. The formation of these simple nets (SrAl2 and CaGa2O4) rather than that of diamond, which has higher symmetry, is related, at least in part to the fact that the SBU itself has less than the full tetrahedral symmetry. Ultimately, attempts at a priori prediction of the network adopted by assembled SBUs will have to take into account the symmetry of the SBUs and of the links. Indeed, the deliberate construction of low-symmetry components is a way of encoding the information necessary to produce more complex structures. In addition, to the three examples of common 4-connected networks discussed above, there are at least two more simple and commonly occurring networks that are expected from assembly of tetrahedra; these are the sodalite network and the boron network of CrB4, which to our knowledge, have not yet been reported for MOFs. However, we have recently prepared indium sulfide porous crystals with supertetrahedral SBUs that assemble into decorated sodalite and CrB4 networks as well as the decorated diamond network.10a,b Assembly of Square and Tetrahedra SBUs. The PtS network is expected to be formed from the assembly of square and tetrahedral shapes (see below).4 Indeed, MTB and Zn2+ were used to assemble the structure of MOF-36 in which there is Figure 1. Structures of MOF-31-33: Zn(ADC)2‚(HTEA)2 (MOF-31) showing tetrahedral zinc (blue) centers with disordered carboxylates of the acetylene links (a), tetrahedral SBUs formed by carboxylate carbon atoms (gray spheres) which are connected by acetylene bonds (gray rods) (b) to produce two interpenetrating diamond frameworks (c); Cd(ATC)‚[Cd(H2O)6](H2O)5 (MOF-32) having cadmium (orange) centers with bidentate carboxylates of ATC (d) resulting in tetrahedral inorganic (orange) and organic (blue) SBUs (e) that share vertexes in a diamond network (f); Zn2(ATB)(H2O)‚(H2O)3(DMF)3 (MOF-33), ATB bind to zinc (blue) to give a complex Zn-O-C cluster arrangement (g) in which the carboxylate carbon atoms and the adamantane units respectively form large and small tetrahedral SBUs (blue) (h) and assemble into two interpenetrating diamond frameworks (i). Atomic coordinates from single-crystal data were used to produce each diagram. Carboxylate carbon atoms were used to define the vertexes of all polyhedra representing the SBUs. Oxygen atoms are represented in red. 8244 J. Am. Chem.

Thus, the central C of MTB can be considered the S vertex, and the square composed of the carboxylate C atoms at the corners of the SBU decorates the Pt positions in PtS (Figure 3b,c). The benzene units space apart the vertexes to give an overall decorated-expanded PtS network Figure 2. Structures of Ni2(ATC)(H2O)4‚(H2O)4 (MOF-34) (a-c) and Zn2(ATC)‚ (C2H5OH)2(H2O)2 (MOF-35) (d-f).

Soc., Vol. 123, No. 34, 2001 8245 with 3-D pores of 5 × 5 Å2 dimension (Figure 3d) that are filled with five water and six DMF guests per formula unit. A fully decorated PtS network was previously found in MOF- 11 in which tetrahedral adamantane (from ATC) and square Cu-paddle-wheel SBUs were assembled to decorate the tetrahedral and square sites, respectively.13a In both MOF-11 and MOF-36 it was possible to construct their frameworks by design for two reasons: (a) we used synthetic conditions that yield the paddle-wheel arrangement, and (b) the PtS network is the only one available for the assembly of square and tetrahedral building blocks with all links related by symmetry. A Framework from Octahedral SBUs. Copolymerization of Zn2+ with NDC gives MOF-37 (Table 2, Figure 4), which has a framework constructed from dimeric Zn centers that are bridged by two carboxylates bound in dimonodentate fashion (Figure 4a). Each Zn also is bound by an additional two (13) (a) Chen, B.; Eddaoudi, M.; Reineke, T. M.; Kampf, J. W.; O’Keeffe, M.; Yaghi, O. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, 11559-11560. (b) Li, H.; Davis, C.

Soc., Vol. 123, No. 34, 2001 Kim et al. monodentate carboxylatessan arrangement where the car- boxylate C atoms form an SBU with an octahedral shape (Figure 4b). These octahedra are spaced apart by the long NDC links to give a decorated primitive cubiclike framework (Figure 4c) having the boron network in CaB6 (carboxylate C atoms replace the B atoms).4,12 This framework supports a 3-D channel system of 6 × 13 Å2 dimension filled with two HTEA, two DEF, and two ClBz guests per formula unit (Figure 4c). Analogous frameworks having this topology have been reported with other linkers such as BDC (MOF-3 and -5) and 1,4-diazodibenzoate (MOF-9).5b,13b,14 Again we note that this structure represents the simplest possibility for joining octahedra by equivalent links. New Structure Types Assembled from Triangles and Trigonal Prisms. Trigonal prismatic geometry is uncommon for metal ions in extended networks;12 however, using BTC and its expanded derivative BTB, we have been able to access frameworks constructed from SBUs having this geometry. Both MOF-38 and -39 have structures based on Zn3O clusters in which each of two Zn centers is bound by two bridging dimonodentate and one monodentate carboxylates (Table 2, Figure 5). The remaining Zn center is bound by a total of four bridging dimonodentate carboxylates. The only difference between the clusters is that in MOF-38 there are three terminal ligands (two water and one DMF, each bound to different Zn), while in MOF-39 there is only one terminal ligand (one water bound to the unique Zn center); so in MOF-38 the Zn3O cluster consists of two ZnO4 tetrahedra and a ZnO6 octahedron sharing a common corner, while in MOF-39 the cluster consists of two ZnO5 trigonal prisms and a ZnO6 octahedron sharing a common corner (Figure 5a,e). In both structures, the carboxylate C atoms are at the vertexes of a trigonal prism SBU (Figure 5b,f), and in MOF-38, the corners of these prisms are linked by six different BTC linkers (triangular SBUs) to give a 3,4 network or a decorated 3,6- connected network (Figure 5c). The structure arrangement illustrated for MOF-38 in which trigonal prism dimers are bridged by BTC (Figure 5d) is repeated in the structure of MOF- 39; however, in the latter, they assemble into an isomeric structure (Figure 5g) in which the prisms and triangles are spaced apart by 2-connected benzene units again to produce a 3,4 network or a decorated-expanded 3,6 network. As expected, the use of BTB as an expanded analogue of BTC allows for two identical networks to interpenetrate. As far as we are aware, the 3,6 nets that form the basis for these structures have not been described before, but we note that, as far as we are aware, very little attention was previously devoted to nets based on trigonal prismatic coordination. Both nets represent simple solutions to the problem of linking together trigonal prisms and trianglessan arrangement that does not appear to be possible with all links being the same (related by symmetry). It is interesting that in both cases the frameworks are polar (the triangular faces of the trigonal prisms have the same orientation) although in MOF-39 the interpenetrating nets have opposite polarity and the structure is centrosymmetric. Conclusions Analysis of metal-organic framework structures using the SBU approach provides new and simplifying principles to what otherwise are complex structures. The analysis of MOF-31- 39 using this approach, coupled to our thesis on the predomi- nance of simple extended structures obtained by the assembly of symmetric building blocks, illustrates a useful tool for understanding and designing structures. Symmetrical and simple M-O-C SBUs such as tetrahedra in MOF-31 and -32 and squares and tetrahedra in MOF-35 are easier to make predict- ably, and they lead to predictable geometries. In contrast, the formation of less symmetrical (complex) SBUs such as in MOF- 33, -34, and -36 is difficult to predict, but they lead to one of a small group of expected topologies. Complex SBUs with uncommon geometries lead to previously unobserved topologies as in MOF-38 and -39. The fact that SBUs have the flexibility to be of any connectivity, size, composition, and stereochemistry promises the design and synthesis of a wide diversity of functional MOFs. Acknowledgment.
