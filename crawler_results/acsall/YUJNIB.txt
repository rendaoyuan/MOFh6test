Sproll Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Munich (LMU), Butenandtstrasse 5-13, Munich D-81377, Germany Received July 20, 2009 The tetrazole-5-carboxylate anion was investigated as ligand for earth alkali metal and transition metal complexes. Therefore, the strontium 4a (*3H2O, *2.75H2O, *2.5H2O), barium 4b (*3H2O), copper 4c (*3.5H2O, *4H2O), manganese 4d (*4H2O, *5H2O), and silver tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4e (*1.56H2O) were synthesized and characterized by vibrational spectroscopy (IR), and the crystal structures of 4a (*2.75H2O, *2.5H2O), 4b*3H2O, 4c*4H2O, and 4d*5H2O were determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction. The thermal stability was investigated by DSC- measurements, and the sensitivity toward impact and friction was determined by BAM-standards. The copper, strontium, and barium tetrazole-5-carboxyate proved to be suitable thermal and physical stable colorants for pyrotechnic compositions. The crystal structure of the tetragonal modification of strontium tetrazole-5-carboxyate possesses channels along the c-axis, leading to a porous material. Introduction Tetrazoles possess a special place among nitrogen rich heterocycles. Despite their high content of nitrogen (80% for 1H-tetrazole), their thermal stability is astonishing high. The field of application of tetrazoles covers pharmaceutical1 and biomedical applications,2 as well as membranes,3 anti- foggants in photographic materials,4 and energetic mate- rials.5 Moreover, their diversity allows a usage as ligands in inorganic chemistry. One example for their versatility is the [μ-tris(1,2-bis(tetrazol-1-yl)propane-N1,N10)iron(II)] bis(per- chlorate), an iron(II) chain6 or [tris(1,4-bis(tetrazol-1-yl)- butane-N1,N1)iron(II)] bis(perchlorate), a three-dimensional structure7 both showing spin-crossover. Another interesting class of tetrazole-containing complexes is formed by the copper nitriminotetrazoles. These compounds show weak antiferromagnetic interaction.8 Beyond that, the chemistry of lanthanide tetrazolates is another proof for the versatility of the tetrazolate ligand. Examples are the formation of hydro- gels of La(III) cations with 5-(2-pyridyl)tetrazolate9 or po- tential new contrast agents based on lanthanide(III) cations and 5-(2-pyridyl)tetrazolate or 5-(2-pyridyl-1-oxide)tetra- zolate10 Furthermore, complexes containing cations like barium, strontium, or copper are sought components for pyrotechnical mixtures, by the combination of the energetic nitrogenrich ligand and thecolorant metalcation.11Especially *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The disadvan- tage of 5-nitrotetrazolates are their high sensitivity toward friction (in case of the potassium, rubidium, and cesium salt >5 N16) and high sensitivity toward impact (in case of the hydrazine, diaminoguanidine, and triaminoguanidine salt >4 J).17 The low physical stability complicates an industrial application, despite their good properties. To develop similar compounds that are much more stable, the corresponding derivatives of tetrazole-5-carboxylic acid were prepared and characterized. In contrast to the nitro group of nitrotetrazolate, the carboxylic moiety of tetrazole- 5-carboxylic acid can forma stable networkofintermolecular interactions. Moreover, the two different points of coordina- tion (the carboxylate moiety and tetrazolate moiety) could lead to interesting materials with new properties. With regard to an industrial application, special interest was paid on the investigation of colorant agents for pyro- technical compositions. Particularly in case of civil applica- tions, physical and thermal stable colorant agents are desired for a safe handling. Results and Discussion Synthesis. To synthesize complexes of tetrazole-5-car- boxylic acid, two different ways of preparation were investigated. The first method was the synthesis of ethyl 1H-tetrazole-5-carboxylate (2) developed by Behringer.18 The formed ethyl ester 2 was converted into the corres- ponding disodium salt of tetrazole-5-carboxylic acid (3a) by treatment with a concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide in hot water. In the second step, the solution was acidified to pH 1, and the desired metal nitrate was added (Scheme 1, method A). The second pathway was to generate directly the dipotassium salt of the tetrazole-5- carboxylic acid (3b) according to a European patent.19 The yields of this reaction were reported with up to 99% in case of 3a and 90% in case of the 3b. A further investigation of the formed colorless powder revealed that it contained a varying amount between 10% to 20% of the corresponding carbonates, a result of the decomposition of the used ethyl cyanoformate (1) during the reaction. Carrying out the reaction several times, only yields of 60% could be achieved (Scheme 1, method B). Compared with the yield of method A (10% to 15%), method B was more suitable to prepare large quantities of the tetrazole-5-carboxylate. The advantage of method A was the purity of the formed product. Instead of method B, method A yields pure product, and the formed salt can be used stoichiometrically. Compounds 3a and 3b of method B were always contaminated by carbonate and also contained a varying amount of crystal water. In this work, the tetrazole-5-carboxylate of method B was used because a stoichiometric usage of 3 and the desired cation was not necessary. The synthesis of the strontium, barium, and copper tetrazol-5-carboxylate was carried out with a view to an application as colorant agents in pyrotechnics. The silver tetrazol-5-carboxylate could be used for metathesis reac- tions to introduce nitrogen rich cations. To convert 3a or 3b into the desired strontium, barium, copper, manga- nese, and silver salts, 3a or 3b were dissolved in the corres- ponding 2N mineral acid to remove residues of carbonate (in case of nitrates in nitric acid or in case of the chlorides in hydrochloric acid) and a 5-fold excess of the salt was added (Scheme 2). In case of the copper (4c), manganese- (II) (4d), and silver tetrazol-5-carboxylate (4e), the pro- duct precipitated instantly, whereas the strontium (4a) and barium (4b) salts crystallized after some hours. Vibrational and NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 4a*3H2O, 4b*3H2O, 4c*3.5H2O, 4d*4H2O, and 4e*1.56H2O were characterized by IR spectroscopy. A comparison between the different spectra shows the characteristic bands of the anion, along with the vibrations of the crystal water. The broadness of the band at about 3400 cm-1 (OH-stretching) depends on the number of different molecules of crystal water. Compound 4d*4H2O pos- sesses a strong band at 3440 cm-1 with three shoulders at 3381 cm-1, 3289 cm-1, and 3171 cm-1, similar to the pattern of 4c*3.5H2O (strong band at 3421 cm-1 with two shoulders at 3256 cm-1 and 3118 cm-1). Surprisingly, the pattern of 4a*3H2O and 4b*3H2O are very different. Compound 4a*H2O only possesses a strong, sharp band at3421cm-1withtwoshouldersat3565cm-1and3250cm-1, whereas4b*3H2Oshowsfourequivalentbandsat3539cm-1, 3453 cm-1, 3368 cm-1, and 3230 cm-1. An investigation of the vibrations of the anion of 4a*3H2O, 4b*3H2O, 4c*3.5H2O, 4d*4H2O, and 4e*1.56H2O reveals only small differences between the different com- plexes (Table 1). An exception is the asymmetric valence Scheme 1. Methods A and B for the Synthesis of 3a or 3b (12) (a) Steinhauser, G.; Tarantik, K.; Klap::otke, T. M. J. Pyrotech. 2008, 27, 3–13.

The band of the asym- metric valence vibration ranges from 1576 cm-1 in case of the barium salt 4b*3H2O to 1661 cm-1 of the copper salt 4c*3.5H2O. For being the only compound with two cations per C2N4O2-anion, the silver salt 4e*1.56H2O was not considered in the discussion of the IR spectra. A comparison between selected vibrations of 4a*3H2O, 4b*3H2O, 4c*3.5H2O, 4d*4H2O, and 4e*1.56H2O and calculated values of the uncoordinated C2N4O2-anion are given in Table 1. The 13C and 15N NMR spectrum of the tetrazol-5- carboxylate anion was recorded using the disodium salt because the solubility of compounds 4a*3H2O, 4b*3H2O, 4c*3.5H2O, 4d*4H2O, and 4e*1.56H2O in any solvents was not sufficient for a NMR spectrum. To verify the assignment, the 13C and 15N NMR shifts were calculated using the isotropic magnetic shieldings of the GIAO (Gauge-Independent Atomic Orbital) method implemen- ted in Gaussian03.20,21 The NMR shielding tensors were calculated at the MPW1PW91/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory using the GIAO method.21 The calculations gave a chemical shift of 165.1 ppm for the carboxyl group and 162.8 ppm for the tetrazole carbon atom. These results confirm the assignment of C5 to the signal at 160.6 ppm and C6 to the signal at 167.5 ppm. Compared to sodium 5-nitrotetrazolate (167.5 ppm, C5, acetone-d6),22 ammo- nium 5-nitrotetrazolate (169.5 ppm, C5, DMSO-d6)23 and 1H-imidazole-2-carboxylic acid (141.1 ppm CN2, 157.6 COOH, DMSO-d6), the chemical shift of the quaternary carbon atom of the tetrazole moiety is located between these compounds. In case of the 15N NMR, the experimental shifts of -3.5 ppm for N2 and N3 and -67.3 ppm for N1 and N4 are in accordance with the calculated values of þ10.6 ppm for N2 and N3 and -47.5 ppm for N1 and N4. Crystal Structures. To investigate the different types of coordination of earth alkali salts and transition metal salts, crystals of 4a (*2.75H2O, *2.5H2O), 4b*3H2O, 4c*4H2O, and 4d*5H2O were synthesized. In this listing, the manganese salt 4d*5H2O is only of academic interest because an application as colorant agent in pyrotechnics is not possible. Transition Metal Complexes. The structures of the transition metal salts of tetrazol-5-carboxyate and copper 4c*4H2O and manganese 4d*5H2O are similar. Com- pound 4c*4H2O crystallizes in the monoclinic space- group C2/c with eight molecular formulas per unit cell and four molecules water per copper cation. The copper tetrazol-5-carboxylate units form dinuclear complexes, involving two copper tetrazol-5-carboxylate units and six molecules of water (Figure 1). The copper cation is Scheme 2.

Two other molecules of water are coordinated axial to the copper cation (O3/O5), leading to a distorted octahedral sphere of coordination (Figure 1). The bond length of the equatorial water molecule (O4; 1.931 A˚ ) is about 21% shorter than the bond length to the axial water molecule (O3; 2.343 A˚ ). The bond length of the other axial molecule of water (O5) with 2.523 A˚ is elongated, compared to O3. The remain- ing molecule water (O6) is connected by several hydrogen bonds to the other water molecules and to N3. Like 4c*4H2O, 4d*5H2O crystallizes in the monoclinic spacegroup C2/c with eight molecular formulas per unit cell and five molecules of crystal water per manganese cation. In contrast to 4c*4H2O, the manganese cation is coordinated octahedrally without distortion by two tetra- zol-5-carboxylate moieties and three molecules of water (Figure 2). The bond distances between the cation and the water molecules vary between 2.117 A˚ and 2.173 A˚ . Like the copper cation, the manganese cation is coordinated to O1 and N1 of the first and N2 of the second tetrazol-5- carboxylate anion. The molecules of crystal water have a significant part in the structure by stabilizing it with several hydrogen bonds. Three molecules of water are coordinated equatorially and axially to the manganese cation (O3, O4, and O5), whereas the last two water molecules form hydrogen bonds to the water molecules and N3. Earth Alkali Metal Complexes. Compound 4a crystal- lizes in two modifications, the tetragonal modification 4a1 and the monoclinic modification 4a2. The monoclinic modification was obtained of a hot saturated aqueous solution. The more symmetric tetragonal modification was obtained by a slow crystallization at room tempe- rature. Compound 4a2*2.5H2O crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)c with four molecular formulas per unit cell. The asymmetric unit contains four strontium tetra- zol-5-carboxylate moieties with 10 molecules of crystal Figure 1. Molecular structure of the dinuclear complex of 4c*4H2O.

Article Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 19, 2009 9553 water. The structure is built up by two different modes of coordination of the strontium cations. The first structural motif is built up by chains along the a-axis, formed by the coordination of the strontium cations to the N2, N3 and O1 and O2 of two different tetrazol-5-carboxylate anions (motif A, Figure 3). In addition, the chains are stabilized by the coordination of the two strontium cations to the bridging water molecules of O42/O43 or O45/O48 (motif A). The second motif contains the connection of two chains by three tetrazol-5-carboxylate moieties (motif B, Figure 4). The coordination of these tetrazol-5-carboxy- late anions is similar to the coordination of the copper and manganese salt. One strontium cation is coordinated to O1 and N1, whereas the second cation is coordinated to N2 (motif B). Beside the two main motifs, several tetra- zol-5-carboxylate anions are arranged to saturate open positions of coordination, like the tetrazol-5-carboxylate anion 3, coordinated to Sr1 (O31 and N31) and Sr4 (O32). The network of hydrogen bonds stabilizing the structure consists of 19 different hydrogen bonds. Compound 4a1*2.75H2O crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4/n with two molecular formulas per unit cell and 2.75 molecules of crystal water per tetrazol-5- carboxylate anion. In contrast to the monoclinic modifi- cation the tetragonal modification does only contain two water molecules embedded in the structure. The lesser role of the crystal water compared to 4a2*2.5H2O is pointed out by the small number of hydrogen bonds formed, compared to 4a2*2.5H2O (4a1*2.75H2O: 5 diffe- rent hydrogen bonds, 4a2*2.5H2O: 19 different hydrogen bonds). The structure of 4a1*2.75H2O is built up by two motifs. Motif A (Figure 5) consists of chains along the c-axis. The strontium atom is coordinated to N1 and O1 of two tetrazol-5-carboxylate anions. The connection between the strontium cations is formed by one tetra- zol-5-carboxylate anion that is coordinated with its oxy- gen atom to the first and N2 to the second strontium cation. The remaining free points of coordination are saturated by molecules of water (Figure 5). The chains are connected among each other by hydrogen bonds formed by molecules of water coordinated to the strontium atom (Figure 5). The combination of the chains leads to a porous structure with channels along the c-axis (Figure 6). A closer investigation of the channel structure reveals that two different kinds of channels are found as demon- strated in Figure 6. The first channel, channel I, is filled with the molecules of water attached to the strontium atom. The bigger channel II is filled with strongly dis- torted molecules of crystal water, which are not involved in the structure, either by coordination to a strontium cation, a tetrazol-5-carboxylate anion, or the formation of hydrogen bonds. Comparing the dimensions of the channels, channel I has a diameter of 7.3 A˚ , whereas channel II has a diameter of 9.5 A˚ (measured from one strontium cation to the opposing strontium cation). The crystal water was neglected for the determination of the diameter. If the crystal water attached to the strontium atom is considered for the determination of the diameter, Figure 6.

Taking these results into account, the structure could be able to absorb small atoms or molecules if the dis- torted, unbound water molecules are removed. This effect could turn this compound into an interesting struc- ture for further investigations in the field of porous materials. Compound 4b*3H2O crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)c with four molecular formulas per unit cell and three molecules of crystal water per tetrazol-5- carboxylate. The structure is built up by only one motif, as shown in Figure 7. The barium cation is coordinated to four tetrazol-5-carboxylate anions; two are coordinated by N1 and O1, whereas the third one is coordinated with N2/N3 and the last one with O1 and O2. Each tetrazol-5- carboxylate anion is bound to four barium atoms, two times by N1/N4 and O1/O2 and one time by N2/N3 and O1 and O2 (Figure 8). In addition, the structure is stabi- lized by six hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and of water molecules to N1 and N2. In contrast to structures 4a1*2.75H2O and 4a2*2.5H2O, the barium tetrazol-5-carboxylate forms layers in the b-c-plane. Thereby, the barium and tetrazol-5-carboxylate anions are situated in the layer, whereas the crystal water is arranged between these layers. The layers are connected by hydrogen bonds. The shortest distance between two layers neglecting the water molecules is 5.4 A˚ between the barium cation and N1 of the opposing layer. The data of the solution and refinement of the crystal structure for the tetrazol-5-carboxylate complexes are given in Table 2. A closer investigation of the bond lengths shows only small differences between the struc- tures. In cases 4c*4H2O and 4d*5H2O, the bond length of the coordinated oxygen atom is slightly elongated, com- pared to the uncoordinated oxygen atom (3.4% in case of 4c*4H2O and 1.0% in case of 4d*5H2O). Energetic Properties and Flame Color. The energetic properties were investigated by DSC-measurements, and the sensitivity toward impact and friction was determined by using BAM standards.24 In case of the determination of the sensitivity against friction, a small sample of the substance is placed on a rough plate made of ceramic and rubbed with a ceramic spike. If the substance shows any decomposition, flame, or detonates at a certain friction force, it is sensitive toward friction up to this value. The sensitivity toward impact is determined by a drop ham- mer. The substance is placed in a metal sleeve, and a drop hammer of a certain weight is dropped from a certain level. The sensitivity toward impact is defined by the force at which one sample of five shows any decomposition or detonation. The DSC-data were obtained by using the precipitated powder instead of the crystalline solid. The samples were dried under high vacuum to remove any moisture beside crystal water. The analysis of the thermal stability by DSC-measure- ments revealed significant differences between the com- pounds (Figure 9). Comparing the transition metal complexes 4c*3.5H2O, 4d*4H2O, and 4e*1.56H2O, the silver tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4e*1.56H2O was the most thermal unstable compound with a point of decomposi- tion of 200 C. The decomposition area of 4e*1.56H2O shows a broad exothermic signal, suggesting a complex mechanism of decomposition. The molecular formula obtained by elemental analysis of 4e*1.56H2O is (C14H5N28O14Ag9)*7H2O. In contrast to the other tetra- zol-5-carboxylate salts, the DSC-data of 4e*1.56H2O do not show any clear point of dehydration but a broad area of dehydration ranging from 60 to 140 C. Compounds 4c*3.5H2O and 4d*4H2O possess major differences con- cerning their thermal behavior, although having both Table 2.

Article Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 48, No. 19, 2009 9555 similar crystal structures. In case of the copper tetrazol-5- carboxylate 4c*3.5H2O, an endothermic signal at 116 C indicates the point of dehydration (powder possesses 3.5 molecules of crystal water per copper tetrazol-5-carboxy- late). The shoulder of this signal shows that the dehydra- tion takes place in two steps. The point of decomposition at 254 C is about 130 C lower than that of the manga- nese tetrazol-5-carboxylate (386 C). In contrast to the copper tetrazol-5-carboxylate, the points of dehydration of the manganese tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4d*4H2O can be clearly distinguished (powder possesses four molecules of crystal water). The first point of dehydration is located at 81 C, the second at 99 C, and the third and fourth is merged with an onset of 126 C. A comparison between the earth metal salts of tetrazol- 5-carboxylate reveals that the thermal stability of the strontium salt 4a*3H2O is 30 C lower than that of the barium salt 4b*3H2O. In contrast to the transition metal tetrazol-5-carboxylates, 4a*3H2O and 4b*3H2O pos- sess only one point of dehydration (4a*3H2O: 166 C, 4b*3H2O: 124 C). The difference of the points of dehy- dration of 40 C proofs the weaker bound crystal water in the barium structure 4b*3H2O. This finding is in accor- dance with the arrangement of the crystal water in the two structures. In case of the strontium tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4a*3H2O, the water molecules are involved in the struc- ture and have significant contribution to the stability of the structure. In case of the barium tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4b*3H2O, the crystal water is embedded between the barium tetrazol-5-carboxylate layers. The investigation of the sensitivity of the tetrazol-5- carboxylate salts toward friction and impact points out the higher stability of the tetrazol-5-carboxylate anion, compared to the nitrotetrazolate anion.16,17 Compounds 4a*3H2O, 4b*3H2O, and 4e*1.56H2O do not show any sensitivity toward friction and impact. In case of the transition metal salts, the copper tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4c*3.5H2O possesses a sensitivity toward friction of >288 N, whereas the manganese tetrazol-5-carboxylate with a sensitivity toward friction of >324 N is slightly more stable. Both compounds are insensitive toward impact.24-26 The grain sizes of the sample of 4a*3H2O and 4b*3H2O were between 500 and 1000 μm, the grain size of 4c*3H2O was 80 to 160 μm, and the grain sizes of 4d*4H2O and 4e*1.56H2O were between 250 and 500 μm. The flame color of compounds 4a*3H2O, 4b*3H2O, and 4c*3.5H2O are in accordance with the expected colors. The strontium salt 4a*3H2O decomposes under emission of a slightly red flame color, whereas the barium salt 4b*3H2O possesses a pale greenish flame color. In both cases, the intensity of the flame color is not very high because of the stability of the complexes. The intensity of the color could be achieved by higher temperatures of decomposition, using different oxidizers. In case of 4c*3.5H2O, the flame color is green with a moderate intensity. These findings turn compounds 4a*3H2O to 4c*3.5H2O into valuable components for pyrotechnic applications because of their simple high-yield synthesis along with a high thermal stability. Moreover, their insensitivity against friction and impact are another advantage, regarding an industrial application. Conclusion The strontium 4a (*3H2O, *2.75H2O, *2.5H2O), barium 4b (*3H2O), copper 4c (*3.5H2O, *4H2O), manganese 4d (*4H2O, *5H2O), and silver tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4e (*1.56H2O) were synthesized and characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy. In cases of 4a (*2.75H2O, *2.5H2O), 4b*3H2O, 4c*4H2O, and 4d*5H2O, the crystal structures were determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction. The analysis of the physical and thermal stability of the com- pounds revealed their insensitivity toward friction and im- pact, along with thermal stabilities up to 380 C. The flame coloration of the strontium tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4a*3H2O (red), barium tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4b*3H2O (pale green- ish), and copper tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4c*3.5H2O (green) renders these compounds into promising components for pyrotechnic applications. Another advantage of these com- pounds is their low solubility in water, along with a lack of toxic moieties (nitro groups, azides) or anions (perchlorate). These properties turn the strontium, barium, and copper tetrazol-5-carboxylates into ecologically interesting substi- tutes for toxic pyrotechnic compositions. Figure 9.

The porous structure of the tetragonal modification of the strontium tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4a1*2.75H2O contains channels along the c-axis. The bigger channel with a diameter of 9.5 A˚ (without crystal water) or 5.1 A˚ (with crystal water) should be able to absorb small molecules or atoms. This feature could be used for further investigations in the fields of catalysis or purification. Experimental Section Caution! Tetrazoles are highly energetic compounds with sensitivity toward heat and impact. Although we had no pro- blems in synthesis, proper protective measures (safety glasses, faceshield,leathercoat, earthenedequipmentand shoes,Kevlar gloves and ear plugs) should be used when undertaking work involving these compounds. General Procedures. All chemical reagents and solvents of analytical grade were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Acros Organics and used as supplied. 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR spectra were recorded using a JEOL Eclipse 400 instrument. The spectra were measured in D2O. The chemical shifts are given relative to tetramethylsilane (13C) or nitromethane (15N) as external stan- dards. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded using a Perkin- Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR instrument and KBr pellets at room temperature. Elemental analyses were performed with a Netsch Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer STA 429. Points of dehydra- tion and decomposition were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (Linseis DSC PT-10 instrument. Measure- ments were performed at a heating rate of 5 C min-1 in closed aluminum containers with a hole (1 μm) on the top for gas release with a nitrogen flow of 5 mL min-1. The reference sample was a closed aluminum container. The sensitivity data were performed using a BAM drophammer and a BAM friction tester. The calculations of vibrational spectra of 13 were obtai- ned using DFT BLYP/6-31G* after optimizing the geometry using the Gaussian 03 software15. The crystallographic data were collected using an Oxford Xcalibur3 diffractometer with a Spellman generator (voltage 50 kV, current 40 mA) and a Kappa CCD area detector with graphite-monochromated Mo KR radiation (λ=0.71073 A˚ ). The structure was solved using direct methods (SHELXS-97)27 and refined using SHELXL-9728. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Oak Ridge Thermal Ellipsoid Plots (ORTEPs) show the thermal ellipsoids with 50% probability for the non-hydrogen atoms. The dipotassium and disodium tetrazol-5-carboxylate was synthesized after a European patent.29 General Synthesis for Metal Tetrazol-5-carboxylates. Crude dipotassium tetrazol-5-carboxylate (1.0 g, 5.3 mmol) was dis- solved in 6 mL of 2 N nitric acid to remove residues of potassium carbonate. A saturated solution of the corresponding metal nitrate (15.9 mmol) was added at room temperature under vigorous stirring. In case of 4c*3.5H2O, 4d*4H2O, and 4e*1.56H2O, the pro- duct instantly precipitated as turquoise (4c*3.5H2O) or colorless (4d*4H2O and 4e*1.56H2O) powder. The solvent was removed by filtration, and the solid was washed with 50 mL of water and 20 mL of methanol. The product was dried under high vacuum. In case of 4a*3H2O and 4b*3H2O, the resulting solution was kept at room temperature, and the product was obtained by slow crystallization. The formed crystals were collected by filtration and were washed with 50 mL of water and 20 mL of methanol. The product was dried under high vacuum. Strontium Tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4a*3H2O.
