The results demonstrate that temperature plays a dominant role on controlling the redox reaction and the structural transformation. D uring the past decades, much eﬀort has been devoted to the design and synthesis of novel coordination polymers.1 In this ﬁeld, the phenomena of structural transformation are often found and play important roles in achieving functional materials.2 Studies on structural transformation would open opportunities to gain better understanding on the fundamental factors which inﬂuence crystal nucleation and growth and, hence, help to develop functional materials. In particular, structural transformations associated with physical property changes have signiﬁcant potential for preparing environ- mentally responsive materials. It is well-known that structural transformation between compounds can be classiﬁed into three kinds: solid state,3 solution,4 and solvent-mediated,5 among which the structural transformation via solvent-medium is less studied. Obviously, because this kind of transformation is essentially due to the dissolve−recrystallize process,6 it allows us to transfer the structure to a great extent. For example, irreversible structural transformation from a noninterpenetrating to an interpenetrat- ing network and reversible structural transformation between a homochiral triangular macrocycle and a helical coordination polymer have been observed.5b These are all believed to have a contribution from the solvent medium and might be very diﬃcult to be implemented merely in the solid state. These transformations can take place under mild conditions, but they may also take place or be accelerated under solvothermal conditions.5d For structural transformation via solvent-mediated, some strategy can be followed, for instance, ﬂexible ligands can be chosen because of their variable conﬁguration. In diﬀerent temperatures, such ﬂexible ligands may demonstrate diﬀerent conﬁgurations. In addition, metal ions whose valence states are easy to change can be introduced, because redox reactions may occur to induce structural transformation in the system. Inspired by the aforementioned consideration, we choose 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane (= tmdpy) and 2,6-pyridin-dicarbox- ylate (= 2,6-pdc) as our ligands and Cu(II) as metal center to learn the behavior of structural transformation in this system. Fortunately, we obtained three copper coordination polymers [CuII 2(tmdpy)(2,6-pdc)2]·(DMF) (1), [CuIICuI(tmdpy)(2,6- pdc)1.5]·(DMF) (2), and [CuII(tmdpy)(2,6-pdc)]·(DMF) (3), in which compound 2 is a mixed-valence copper(I, II) coordination polymer. Just as we expected, there exists a charming solvent-mediated structural transformation among these three compounds. Remarkably, the structural trans- formations between 2 and 3 are reversible through a redox reaction in the mother liquor. To the best of our knowledge, such a redox reaction induced structural transformation between coordination polymers is unprecedented up to date. A mixture of 2,6-H2pdc, tmdpy, NaOH, and DMF in a vial was stirred for 30 min to obtain a blue suspension. The reaction of the blue suspension under solvothermal conditions at 120 °C for 1 h produced compound 1.7 When the reaction continued, compound 2 was obtained after 2 days. To our surprise, compound 2 disappeared at room temperature after 1 week and compound 3 was obtained with, the solution becoming green from brown. It is notable that compound 1 can also be obtained under 100 °C after 2 days (Scheme 1). All compounds are structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction.8 In the structure of 1, the asymmetric unit contains two crystallographically independent Cu centers (Figure 1a). Both Cu centers show similar square pyramidal coordination geometry, and each Cu center is coordinated by three Received: August 5, 2012 Revised: September 26, 2012 Communication pubs.acs.org/crystal © XXXX American Chemical Society A dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg301120b | Cryst. Growth Des. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX carboxylate oxygen atoms from two distinct 2,6-pdc ligands and two nitrogen atoms from a 2,6-pdc ligand and a tmdpy ligand. The 2,6-pdc ligands link the Cu centers into a Cu-2,6-pdc chain, and two face-to-face chains are further bridged by the tmdpy ligands into a ladder-like double-chain (Figure 1a). The resulting chains are parallel to each other and stack into a 3D framework (Figure 1b). No obvious interactions are observed between the chains. Compound 2 is a layer structure which contains mixed valence Cu(I/II) centers. There are three crystallographically independent Cu centers (Cu1, Cu2, and Cu3) in the structure of 2 (Figure 2a). The 6-coordinate Cu2 center is chelated by two 2,6-pdc ligands, giving a distorted [CuO4N2] octahedral geometry. Both Cu1 and Cu3 centers exhibit a trigonal geometry, and each is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two tmdpy ligands and one oxygen atom from the 2,6-pdc ligand. Considering such coordination geometries of the Cu centers, the valence charge for each Cu center can be assigned as follows: the 6-coordinate Cu2 center is +2 changed, while both Cu1 and Cu3 centers are +1 charged. The tmdpy ligands link the Cu1 and Cu3 centers into a wavelike Cu(I)-tmdpy chain, and the resulting chains are further connected by the Cu(2,6-pdc)2 ligands to form an irregular honeycomb-like layer (Figure 2a). It is interesting that the honeycomb-like layers are further linked to each other by obvious Cu(I)···Cu(I) interactions into a 3D framework (Figure 2b,c). The shortest Cu···Cu distance between two layers is 2.950 Å. By considering such Cu(I)···Cu(I) interaction as one kind of connectivity, the whole framework of 2 can be topologically represented as a 4- connected ion net (Figure 2d). Unlike 1 and 2, compound 3 shows an open supramolecular framework with guest DMF molecules which is based on the packing of zigzag chains via C−H···O hydrogen bonding interactions. There is only one crystallographically independent Cu center in the asymmetric unit of 3, which is coordinated by two oxygen atoms from a 2,6-pdc and three nitrogen atoms from two diﬀerent tmdpy ligands and a 2,6-pdc. The tmdpy ligands link the Cu(2,6-pdc) units to form a zigzag chain (Figure 3a). It is worth noting that there are C−H···O hydrogen bonds between the zigzag chains, which linked the zigzag chains into a hydrogen bonding bilayer (Figure 3b). Each resulting bilayer exhibits channels which are ﬁlled by the guest DMF molecules (Figure 3c). The bilayers were further stacked up to form a 3D framework through the π···π interactions between the pyridine rings from adjacent bilayers (Figure 3d). It is interesting to note that the coordination modes of the 2,6-pdc ligand in three compounds are diﬀerent and the conformations of tmdpy ligand in these three compounds are also not the same. In 1, each 2,6-pdc ligand only bonds to two Cu centers. In 2, two 2,6-pdc ligands chelate one Cu center and one of them further bonds to two Cu centers. In 3, each 2,6- pdc ligand only chelates one Cu center. The conﬁguration of the tmdpy ligand in 1 and 2 is assigned to TT, while that in 3 is assigned to TG. The most unusual aspect about these three compounds is the structural transformation between two of them. There are two kinds of transformation observed here, which are the irreversible transformation from 1 to 2 and the reversible transformation between 2 and 3. First, if the blue crystals of 1 in its mother solution further remain at 120 °C for 2 days, all crystals change to brown and a new bulk sample 2 is successfully generated. Such an irreversible transformation is conﬁrmed by both single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction and powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) (Figure 4 and S4). After the brown crystals of 2 in its mother solution were placed at room temperature for 1 week, green crystals of 3 were generated, which are also characterized by single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction. Also, when the green crystal of compound 3 and it mother solution reacted in the sealed vial under 120 °C for 2 days, 2 was maintained again. These results prove that the trans- formation between 2 and 3 is reversible. It is obvious that the transformation among three compounds is associated with not only the structural reorganization but also the redox during the process. Several reported coordination polymers can react with oxidant or reductant, which leads to alteration of their frameworks, but those are irreversible and did not happen under solvothermal conditions.9,10 To the best of our knowledge, such a redox reaction induced a structural transformation between the three Cu(II) coordination polymers reported here that is unprece- dented.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX B The redox reaction between the three compounds is complicated because the factors aﬀecting the reactions are various. The most important factor is temperature. For the transformation from 1 to 2, Cu2+ ion might be a weak oxidant and tmdpy ligand might act as a reductant at high temper- ature.11 At 100 °C, no redox reaction occurred and compound 1 was obtained. When the temperature reached 120 °C, redox reaction between tmdpy ligands and Cu2+ occurred, so that compound 2 with mixed Cu2+ and Cu+ centers was obtained. Compound 2 can be retained for some days and cannot transfer to compound 3 if it is separated from the mother liquor and kept dry. If it is left in the mother solution, it becomes unstable and transforms to compound 3, which is due to the oxidation from unstable Cu+ to Cu2+ in the liquid and reorganization of the structure. Here, O2 in the air might be the oxidant. The reason why 3 can transfer back to 2 is because the redox Figure 2.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX C reaction between tmdpy ligands and Cu2+ ions may occur again when the temperature reaches to 120 °C. The thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) of 1, 2, and 3 were performed to investigate their thermal behavior (Figures S5−7 in the Supporting Information). For 1, the sum weight losses of the ﬁrst stage and second stage about 10% below 240 °C correspond to the release of free DMF molecules (calc 9.97%). The TG curve of 2 reveals that the main weight loss of about 10.5% occurs between room temperature and 180 °C, corresponding to the loss of free DMF molecules (calc 11.2%). For 3, the weight loss of about 14% below 210 °C corresponds to the release of the free DMF molecules (calc 14.5%). In summary, three new Cu(II) coordination polymers have been prepared under solvothermal in situ redox reaction conditions, and an interesting structural transformation among three compounds is observed. This presents an unusual example that shows reversible structural reorganization between two compounds (2 and 3) through a solvothermal in situ redox reaction. The results demonstrate that temperature plays a dominant role in controlling the redox reaction and the structural transformation. What’s more, such a redox reaction induced structural transformation provides us a better under- standing of the self-assembly and crystal growth of coordination polymers. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information TGA, powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns, and CIF ﬁles.
