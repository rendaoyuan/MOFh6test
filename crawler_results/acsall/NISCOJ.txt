Both series consist of 3D diamondoid networks with four-fold interpenetration. Solid-state NMR identiﬁes the metal coordination of the ligands, and assignment of all 1H and 13C shifts was enabled by the combination of 13C editing, FSLG-HETCOR spectra, and 2D 1H−1H back-to-back (BABA) spectra with results from NMR-CASTEP calculations. The incorporation of Co2+ replacing Zn2+ ions in the MOF over the full range of concentrations has signiﬁcant inﬂuences on the NMR spectra. A uniform distribution of metal ions is documented based on the analysis of 1H T1 relaxation time measurements. ■INTRODUCTION Coordination networks or often called metal−organic frame- works (MOFs) have attracted tremendous attention in recent years as a new class of porous compounds.1,2 The dramatic increase in the number of publications in this area shows its growing interest as can be seen for instance in two reviews.3,4 The wide structural diversity oﬀered by this class has high potential for various applications, including gas storage,5,6 catalysis,7 sensoring,8 gas separation,9 and others, such as heat- transformation applications.10−13 They are designed from inorganic building blocks, for example, metal ions or clusters interconnected by polyfunctional organic ligands. Carboxylates are the most extensively studied polyfunctional organic ligands. Apart from this, ligands having a combination of both neutral donor groups, such as pyridine or 1,2,4- triazoles, and anionic functional groups, such as carboxylates, are of interest14,15 where the coordination properties of both functional groups can be combined. 1,2,4-Triazole derived ligands show promising coordination chemistry especially when substituted with certain donor groups. The synthesis of such ligands has been reported16 and successfully applied for the preparation of novel MOFs.17,18 Especially MOFs with N- donor ligands show interesting properties for heterogeneous catalysis.19 On the basis of the ligands (L1−) (Me-3py-trz- pba)−and (L2−) (Me2trz-pba)−(shown in Scheme 1; the corresponding structural motifs of the coordination polymers are given in 1(b) and 2(b), respectively), we analyzed two Zn based MOFs (1 and 2, structures included in Scheme 1). Additionally, we also studied mixed metal MOFs (hetero- nuclear MOFs) ∞ 3 [Zn1−xCox(L)2] (Series I and Series II) using these ligands, combining metal ions of diﬀerent electron conﬁgurations. Such mixed-metal systems exhibit interesting catalytic properties.19 The heteronuclear MOFs were prepared Received: December 3, 2012 Article pubs.acs.org/IC © XXXX American Chemical Society A dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic302643w | Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX by partially substituting the diamagnetic Zn2+ ions with varying amounts of paramagnetic Co2+ ions in the full range from x = 0.02 to x = 1. Various experimental methods can be used for the structural characterization of porous coordination compounds. A better understanding of the various interactions present in the metal− ligand framework is inevitable to explore its potential applicability. Solid-state NMR is a versatile tool for studying the diﬀerent interactions present in porous coordination frameworks, which is increasingly used for the characterization of structure and dynamics in these materials.20−24 NMR spectra of solid samples provide information on the detailed local electronic structure of each nucleus reﬂected as a chemical shift without the need of long-range order. Therefore, noncrystalline materials can be characterized with solid-state NMR, which is increasingly used for the characterization of structure and dynamics in these materials.25−27 Furthermore, using this method, it is easy to determine the presence of small mobile molecules, while X-ray analysis is more complicated or impossible.28 In this paper, we report on the synthesis and detailed structural elucidation of two Zn MOFs together with their corresponding protonated ligands by means of X-ray structure analysis, 1H and 13C solid-state NMR, and quantum chemical calculations. Detailed assignments of NMR resonances were done, including the changes in individual chemical shifts with respect to the protonated ligands. Full resonance assignments were achieved with frequency switched Lee−Goldburg (FSLG) heteronuclear 1H−13C correlation experiments (HETCOR)29 and 1H−1H homonuclear correlation experiments using the back-to-back (BABA)30 sequence. Our experimental results were complemented by DFT calculations of NMR parameters, using the GIPAW method31 implemented in the CASTEP code,32 which has already been proven to be a reliable tool in characterizing the NMR properties of crystalline solids.33−40 Heteronuclear MOFs with varying percentages of para- magnetic Co2+ were also investigated with 1H and 13C NMR to study the inﬂuence of paramagnetic metal ions on the parent framework. In order to gain information about the distribution of Co2+ in the MOF network, an analysis of 1H T1 relaxation times was performed. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Synthesis. The synthesis of the respective N-donor ligands was previously reported by Lässig et al.16 While the synthesis and characterization of the coordination polymers ∞ 3 [M(Me-3py-trz-pba)2] (M = Zn: 1, Zn/Co: Series I) were reported earlier,17 herein, we present the structurally related system ∞ 3 [Zn(Me2trz-pba)2] (2) with the dimethylated ligand (Me2trz-pba)−. Multigram amounts of MOFs of the two isomorphous series were obtained by heating the starting materials, that is, Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and the respective protonated ligands H(Me-3py-trz-pba) and H(Me2trz-pba) under reﬂux in DMF for 48 h. Afterwards, the reaction mixtures were cooled to room temperature, and the solid products were washed with DMF and ethanol, yielding ﬁne microcrystalline powders after drying in air. The IR, thermogravimetric and PXRD data of 1 and 2 are given in the Supporting Information or can be found in the respective publication.17 For the preparation of mixed Zn/Co MOFs of type ∞ 3 [Zn1−xCox(Me-3py-trz-pba)2] (Series I), Zn(OAc)2·2H2O was partially replaced by 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 and 75% of CoCl2·6H2O, respectively. Similarly, for the preparation of mixed Zn/Co MOFs of type ∞ 3 [Zn1−xCox(Me2trz-pba)2]·DMF·1.5·H2O (Series II), Zn- (OAc)2·2H2O was partially replaced by 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 75% of CoCl2·6H2O, respectively. For both series, also samples with only cobalt as a metal connector were prepared as well. To determine the actual amounts of zinc and cobalt incorporated into the MOFs, atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was carried out. For this, the samples were ﬁrst incinerated and afterwards dissolved in nitric acid. Experiments were performed using a Varian SpectrAA 300 operating at wavelengths of 242.5 and 307.6 nm for cobalt and zinc, respectively. Because of the higher cobalt fraction xCo experimentally determined by AAS compared to the cobalt amount used in synthesis (cf. Table 1), we conclude that the incorporation of cobalt is favored over zinc. Notably, the reported synthesis procedure17 for microcrystalline material of 1 proved to be successful only for the incorporation of small percentages of cobalt, as shown in EPR studies.17 Nevertheless, by changing the reported method by the use of DMF instead of Scheme 1.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX B ethanol, higher amounts of Co2+ could be incorporated in yields ranging from 40% to 98%, depending on composition. X-ray Crystallography. The X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) data were collected on an IPDS-I (STOE) diﬀractometer using Mo−Kα radiation (λ = 71.073 pm).41 The structure was solved by direct methods and reﬁned using SHELX-97.42 The coordinates of the framework non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned using anisotropic displacement parameters, whereas the disordered water molecules were treated isotropically. The coordinates of hydrogen atoms of the framework were calculated for idealized positions. The PXRD (powder XRD) and TD-PXRD (temperature-depend- ent powder XRD) measurements were carried out on a STOE STADI- P diﬀractometer in Debye−Scherrer mode using Cu−Kα1 radiation (λ = 154.060 pm). The samples for these measurements were prepared in glass capillaries (outer diameter, 0.5 mm). The TD-PXRD measure- ments were carried out in steps of 5 °C from room temperature up to 500 °C. Thermogravimetry measurements were performed on a Netzsch F1 Jupiter thermobalance. Solid-State NMR. Solid-state NMR measurements were carried out at two diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds, 17.6 and 2.35 T. Experiments were performed at room temperature using 2.5, 4, and 7 mm MAS probes. 13C Measurements. High-ﬁeld experiments were done on a Bruker Avance 750 spectrometer operating at a ﬁeld of 17.6 T and a 13C resonance frequency of 188.41 MHz. To avoid overlap of spinning sidebands, 13C CPMAS43 spectra were acquired together with the TOSS (TOtal Sideband Suppression) sequence.44 The spinning frequency was 10 kHz, and contact times of 100 μs and 1 ms were used to diﬀerentiate protonated and nonprotonated carbon signals. For cross-polarization, a ramped pulse45 on the 1H channel was employed; 300 and 360 scans were acquired for the protonated ligands L1−and L2−with recycle delays of 50 and 70 s, respectively. For the MOF samples 1 and 2, 4000 and 1600 scans were collected with recycle delays of 5 and 10 s, respectively. The decoupling and Hartmann-Hahn matching ﬁelds were 80 and 65 kHz, respectively. The presence of paramagnetic Co2+ lowers the resolution of carbon spectra severely. Hence, only spectra for samples containing cobalt in low concentrations (up to 25%) were recorded. The corresponding spectra were recorded with recycle delays of 4 s or less, collecting 4000 scans. Spectral editing experiments using nonquaternary suppression (NQS),46 with two dephasing delays of 37 μs each within an echo sequence spanning two rotor periods helped in assignment. All measurements were done with high-power 1H decoupling using two pulse phase modulation (TPPM).47 The 2D FSLG-HETCOR29 experiments of the protonated ligand L1−and MOFs 1 and 2 were done at 10 and 8 kHz MAS and a contact time of 500 μs with 13 μs as the length of one FSLG block. For L1− and 1, 80 and 128 t1 increments were collected with 256 scans and 5 s as the recycle delay. For 2, a recycle delay of 4 s and 400 transients with 128 t1 increments were used. The States-TPPI48 mode for pure absorption spectra was employed. Chemical shifts are referenced to TMS using adamantane as a secondary reference with the downﬁeld signal at 38.56 ppm. 1H Measurements. High-ﬁeld measurements at 17.6 T were done at a frequency of 749.32 MHz. Single pulse excitation experiments were performed at various spinning frequencies of 10, 11, 12, 12.5, and 25 kHz, in particular for high resolution and to distinguish signals from spinning sidebands. (π/2) pulse lengths were about 3.6 μs at 12.5 kHz and 1.4 μs at 25 kHz MAS. For the paramagnetic samples, since the uniform excitation of the full spectrum is hard to achieve with a single pulse, a frequency-stepped acquisition was performed. Therefore, for both static and MAS experiments (10 kHz spinning frequency), Hahn- echo49 spectra with a 90° pulse length of 3.2 μs were measured at two diﬀerent excitation frequencies of 104 and −104 kHz from the center of the main resonance and the full spectrum was obtained by summing up the individual subspectra. 2D 1H−1H BABA30 double quantum experiments were performed using a 2.5 mm probe at a spinning frequency of 30 and 26 kHz for 1 and 2, respectively; 128 points were collected in the indirect dimension with 16 and 64 scans and recycle delays of 1 and 3 s for 1 and 2, respectively. During excitation and reconversion, the back-to- back (BABA) scheme was used, which recouples the 1H−1H dipolar coupling. (π/2) pulses were 1.6 μs, and recoupling over one rotor period was used. The z-ﬁlter delay was 20 μs. For pure-absorption spectra, the TPPI scheme was used.50 Static 1H T1 relaxation measurements were performed at a magnetic ﬁeld of 2.35 T and a frequency of 100.13 MHz using a Tecmag Apollo spectrometer. The inversion recovery sequence51 with (π/2) pulse lengths of 2.0 and 2.75 μs for 1 and 2, respectively, was used. The sequence was combined with DEPTH52 detection to remove probe background signal. The samples were packed in a 7 mm MAS rotor used under nonspinning conditions. The lower magnetic ﬁeld was chosen for the relaxation measurements since, in this case, uniform excitation was possible. All 1H spectra were referenced to TMS using a sample of PDMS as secondary reference (0.07 ppm from TMS). First-Principles NMR Calculations. Geometry optimizations and chemical shift calculations were carried out within the density functional theory (DFT) framework using the CASTEP (Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package) software.32 CASTEP uses plane-wave basis sets to describe the wave functions (it thus has an implicit translational symmetry) and is very well adapted to the description of solid crystalline systems. The GIPAW (gauge-including projector augmented waves) method,31 used with ultrasoft pseudo-poten- tials,53,54 provides an eﬃcient method for calculating chemical shifts in crystalline solids.55 The geometry optimization of the X-ray determined structure and the calculation of NMR parameters were carried out using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE exchange correlation functional56 and Vanderbilt-type pseudo- potentials.54 Only the proton positions were relaxed during the geometry optimization, keeping both the unit cell and all the other atoms ﬁxed to their X-ray determined positions. For the geometry optimization, a plane-wave cutoﬀenergy of 800 eV and a Monkhorst− Pack grid of k-points57 spacing of 0.05 Å−1 in reciprocal space were used. The NMR calculations were done on the proton-optimized structure using a higher cutoﬀenergy of 1000 eV and a k-point sampling of 0.05 Å−1. The NMR converges slowly because the part of the electronic structure on which it depends converges slowly, therefore, a higher cutoﬀenergy was used for the NMR calculations. To compare directly with experimentally measured isotropic chemical shifts, the calculated chemical shieldings were then converted into calculated chemical shifts, δcalc, using the relation, δcalc = σref −σcalc. The value of σref was determined with a linear regression between calculated and experimental shifts, imposing a slope of unity, where shifts and shielding were simply sorted by ascending and descending order, respectively. This procedure leads to a 13C reference value of 169.65 ppm, which was then used to determine the computed chemical shifts. Table 1.

Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX C ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION X-ray Diﬀraction Studies. Whereas the isomorphous Zn (1) and Zn/Co MOFs of Series I crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric monoclinic space group Pc (No. 7) with two formula units per unit cell, the coordination polymer 2 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric orthorhombic space group Pca21 (No. 29) with four formula units per unit cell. The atomic coordinates of 1 can be found in ref 17; those of 2 are reported in Table S 3 (Supporting Information). The formula units correspond to the asymmetric units in the crystal structures and consist of one metal ion, Zn2+ or Co2+, and two ligand anions (Me-3py-trz-pba)−or (Me2trz-pba)−, respectively. In addition, the asymmetric unit of 2 contains 1.5 noncoordinated water molecules and one DMF molecule. The Zn2+ ions in 1 and 2 possess coordination spheres in the transition from trigonal-bipyramidal to square-pyramidal (see Figure 1). Selected bond lengths and angles of 1 and 2 are given in Table S 2 (Supporting Information). The topology of both series is the one of the commonly observed diamondoid network (dia, point symbol {66}), which was determined using the program TOPOS 4.0.58 The porosity of these compounds is reduced by four-fold interpenetration (type la).59 The phase purity of the as-synthesized materials was proven by powder X-ray diﬀraction. The powder patterns are in good agreement with the respective simulated patterns for both 1 and 2, as shown in Figure 2. Additionally, all mixed zinc/cobalt MOFs were obtained as phase pure materials; no byproducts are observed, showing that there is no miscibility gap in both series. The crystallographic data were deposited as CCDC codes 783568, 783569, and 852802. Solid-State NMR. 13C NMR. Figure 3 compares the 13C CPMAS spectra of the Zn MOFs 1 and 2 and the corresponding protonated ligands. Four distinct functional regions ascribed to methyl, aromatic, pyridine-triazole, and carboxyl carbons are well separated in the ranges of 10−13, 120−140, 144−160 ppm, and above 165 ppm, respectively. Several diﬀerences are visible when comparing the NMR spectra of the same ligands incorporated into the 3D MOF network. It is noteworthy to point out the reduced line widths of the signals in the MOF spectra in comparison to its uncoordinated ligand, which indicates a higher degree of order in the coordination framework. A doubling of MOF resonances with respect to the protonated ligand is clearly evident from the 13C CPMAS spectra (see Figure 3). As reported before,60,61 this is due to the diﬀerent relative orientation of the two ligands in the asymmetric unit of the respective crystal structures. For example, in the coordination polymer 1, the carboxyl group of the ligand L1−is coordinated to the Zn2+ ion in a monodentate, in the second ligand, in a bidentate mode. The torsion angle between phenyl-triazole and triazole-pyridine rings are found to be 90° and 40° for the monodentate binding ligand, respectively. However, these values change to 78° and 56°, for the bidentate binding ligand. This leads to diﬀerent electronic environments and thus results in diﬀerent chemical shifts, leading to two signals for each carboxyl carbon atom. This is also in agreement with the results from the NMR- CASTEP calculations (see below) and can be documented by the diﬀerent carbon−oxygen distances for the same carbon atom in the two nonequivalent ligand molecules. Since the ligand L2−is symmetric about the C2 axis, the corresponding MOF spectrum possesses a more simple signal pattern additionally to the fact that the pyridine ring is absent. Metal binding via one nitrogen of the triazole ring and carboxyl oxygens (both mono- and bidentate) induces asymmetry, leading to a doubling of resonances as for 1. However, smaller chemical shift diﬀerences between the same carbon atoms in two nonequivalent ligand molecules are obtained due to the higher symmetry, and therefore, fewer signals than for 1 are resolved. Some signals are signiﬁcantly shifted in the spectrum of the MOF samples with respect to the protonated ligand, mainly due to metal coordination. This eﬀect of metal coordination to the ligand molecule can be analyzed by calculating the coordination induced shifts,60,62 obtained by subtracting from the carbon chemical shifts of the MOF those of the corresponding uncoordinated ligand. These numbers are summarized for the most signiﬁcant carbon atoms in Table 2. Table 2. 13C NMR Coordination Induced Shifts, Δδ for 1 and 2 carbon Δδ1 = δMOF −δlig Δδ2 = δMOF −δlig C-1 +5.7, +6.3 +3.2, +5.3 C-2 +2.0, −0.3 +0.0, +0.2 C-9 +4.9, +3.5 +3.3 C-10 +0.2, +1.6 +2.2 The carboxyl carbon (C-1) is found to be most sensitive to metal coordination60,63,62 in both MOFs. While incorporated into 1, this signal gets shifted downﬁeld by 5.7 and 6.3 ppm, which clearly corroborates the metal binding via the carboxyl group; however, for 2, the eﬀects are somewhat smaller. The shift diﬀerence for C-1 also induces a shift eﬀect on the neighboring carbon C-2 as well. Figure 1. Top: Structural motif of coordination polymers 1 (left) and 2 (right). The atom labels for 2 correspond to the crystallographic data (CCDC 852802) and that of 1 published elsewhere.17 Bottom: The four-fold interpenetrating networks of 1 (left) and 3D projection of a single net of 2 (right). Inorganic Chemistry Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic302643w | Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX D A large Δδ value has also been observed for carbon C-9 of the triazole ring, implying the eﬀect of metal coordination through its nearby nitrogen atom. However, this value being smaller than that of C-1 predominantly refers to a relatively larger metal−carbon distance64 (e.g., 263/250 pm for C-1 vs 309/313 pm for C-9 for 1). In contrast to C-9, C-10 shows a smaller Δδ value, indicating a comparatively larger distance to the metal center (411 pm for 1) and documenting binding via the nitrogen next to C-9. For 2, the shift eﬀects are less pronounced, though also showing the largest induced shifts for carbons C-1 and C-9. Other carbons not involved in metal binding typically show small shift diﬀerences between protonated ligand and MOF, which could be explained by the diﬀerent π−π stacking interactions in the uncoordinated ligand and the inter- penetrated frameworks. The full resonance assignments given in the Supporting Information were achieved by a combination of several techniques. Spectral editing (NQS and diﬀerent contact times, details given in the Supporting Information, Figures S 4−S 7) allowed us to distinguish protonated and quaternary carbons (as well as mobile, rotating groups, such as methyl groups). Comparison to literature values for similar compounds as well as the solution NMR data of structurally similar triazolyl ligands16 helped in reﬁnement. For 1, NMR-CASTEP calculation results are included in Figure 3 and in Table S 4 (Supporting Information), showing a very good agreement with the experimental spectrum. In accordance with the discussion of the crystal structure, two signals are present for every carbon atom of the ligand and results in a total of 30 lines. The deviation between experimental and calculated values might hint at a somewhat dynamic structure at room temperature. The assignment based on the calculated values are further revealed by FSLG-HETCOR experiments, as shown in Figure 4 for 1 and 2 (for the protonated ligand L1−shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S 8). The spreading of signals in two dimensions as well as the higher resolution in the indirect dimension from the homonuclear Lee−Goldburg decoupling enhances the information content. Especially for 1, resolution of diﬀerent 1H chemical shifts and the cross-peaks from the methyl protons to carbons C-9, C-5, and C-6 strengthen our assignments. For 2, the presence of four signals (two of them overlapping) for the four methyl groups is clearly visible, and the respective protons of these methyl groups show a diﬀerent coupling to the C-9 and C-10 carbon atoms. This means that the orientation in the crystal structure makes all methyl groups nonequivalent. A solvent signal at 162.2 ppm is identiﬁed by having unique coupling to a proton with no other cross-peaks. For ligand L1−, the resonance at 153.1 ppm could be clearly assigned to C-9 due to the cross-peak with the methyl protons (see the Supporting Information, Figure S 8). 1H NMR. The metal coordination by the oxygen atoms of the carboxylic group is clearly documented from the 1H MAS spectra (shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S 9) by the disappearance of the carboxylic acid proton at chemical shifts of 15.0 and 16.5 ppm for 1 and 2, respectively. For 2, two regions of signals around 7.5 ppm for aromatic and 2.0 ppm for methyl protons are visible. For 1, however, the methyl signal is more narrow than in the corresponding protonated ligand and shifted 1 ppm downﬁeld. Furthermore, aromatic signals span a range from 5 ppm up to 9 ppm. This larger range compared to that of 2 is due to the additional pyridine ring in the ligand. To get more information from the 1H spectra, we combine the information from the MAS spectrum with the results from the NMR-CASTEP calculations (for 1, experimental and calculated values are given in the Supporting Information, Table S 5) and the 1H projection from the FSLG-HETCOR spectrum with higher resolution (see above). Furthermore, the 2D 1H−1H double quantum BABA spectrum gives further insight from 1H−1H correlations, as shown in Figure 5, for 1 and 2 together with the MAS spectrum, the calculated spectrum, and the FSLG-HETCOR projection. In the HETCOR projection, the resolution is higher due to the homonuclear decoupling. In the 2D BABA spectrum, diagonal peaks indicate the proximity of two protons with the same chemical shifts. Oﬀ-diagonal peaks then identify the proximity of two protons with diﬀerent chemical shifts, the corresponding shift in the double-quantum dimension being the sum of the chemical shifts of the two involved protons. As seen in Figure 5, there is a very good agreement between experimental and calculated chemical shifts. Diﬀerences are seen predominantly only for the signals at 4.2 and 4.4 ppm in Figure 2. X-ray powder patterns of MOFs from Series I (left) and Series II (right) together with the simulated powder patterns for the pure Zn and pure Co compounds. For the pure Co MOF in Series II, no single crystal structure is available. Inorganic Chemistry Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic302643w | Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX E the calculated spectrum. Intensity diﬀerences between the diﬀerent 1H spectra arise from the diﬀerent excitation eﬃciencies in the BABA and HETCOR spectra. The assignments were made by combining the CASTEP results with the observed cross-peaks in the FSLG-HETCOR spectrum. The protons of the aromatic ring have rather typical chemical shifts with the exception of one of the H6 protons at 9.3 ppm, which agrees well with the calculated value. The protons of the pyridine ring, H13 and H14, are found at rather low chemical shifts, 4.9 and 5.2 ppm, respectively. These values presumably result from the shielding of these protons that are positioned above (below) the face of aromatic rings.65 The 2D BABA spectra show close through-space proximity of protons. Most clearly, this can be seen for 2. Because of the small shift range of both aromatic and methyl signals, no resolution of coupling within the aromatic or the methyl region is possible. However, oﬀ-diagonal peaks between aromatic and methyl signals are visible. These arise between the methyl protons and the protons at the C-4 and C-6 carbons. For compound 1, several correlation peaks are resolved because of the larger shift range within the aromatic range between 9.3 ppm for H6 and 4.9 ppm for H13 (see above). On the basis of the assignment of proton signals from the CASTEP calculations and the FSLG-HETCOR spectrum, all expected correlation signals can be found. Especially, at least three correlation peaks between the aromatic and methyl region can be identiﬁed, corresponding to the protons H4 and H6 from the aromatic ring (compare Scheme 1 for through-space distances). H12 shows no correlation peak, as expected. This can be seen, however, only at lower magniﬁcation of the 2D plot (not shown). Because of short excitation and reconversion times, intermolecular cross-peaks between the interpenetrated net- works are not observed in the 2D BABA experiment. The results show that 2D BABA experiments can be well used to identify the proton shifts by their coupling scheme. ■HETERONUCLEAR MOFS The presence of traces of paramagnetic impurities in the sample has various eﬀects on NMR spectra, such as unusual chemical shifts, dramatic line broadening, and shortening of relaxation times. The hyperﬁne interaction66 is responsible for the unusual chemical or paramagnetic shifts, the size of which is often hard to predict and can lead to shifts of up to 1000 ppm for 13C. Since magic-angle spinning removes only the isotropic part of the magnetic susceptibility, contributions from the anisotropic bulk magnetic susceptibility and short T2 also lead to the broadening of resonances. The demagnetizing ﬁelds created, for example, at grain boundaries, inﬂuence neighboring spins, and hence these orientation-dependent local ﬁelds cause a dispersion of chemical shifts and result in broadening of NMR resonances. This phenomenon has been investigated in the pioneering works by Lippmaa and VanderHart.67,68 Addition- ally, the presence of large magnetic susceptibilities in the sample even produces a large manifold of spinning sidebands in MAS spectra,69,70 which can be analyzed in a similar way as chemical shift anisotropy. The combined eﬀects of hyperﬁne interaction and anisotropic magnetic susceptibility limit good spectral reso- lution in our samples, both for 1H and 13C spectra (see discussion below). Nevertheless, NMR relaxation measure- ments can be used to analyze the dynamics and distribution of paramagnetic centers in the matrix of diamagnetic ions.71,72 It is noteworthy to point out the improvements in the detection and resolution of 1H and 13C signals in paramagnetic systems using fast magic-angle spinning by Ishii et al.73−75 Eﬀect of Paramagnetic Co2+ on the 13C and 1H NMR Spectra. For the demonstration of the inﬂuence of para- magnetic Co2+ on the NMR measurements, both 13C and 1H spectra were recorded. Figure 6 exempliﬁes the 13C spectra of MOFs from Series I with Co2+ amounts of x = 0.09 and 0.17 in comparison to the pure zinc compound 1 (see Figure S 10, Supporting Information, for Series II). In contrast to the diamagnetic MOF 1, the corresponding paramagnetic analogues have a rather low resolution due to broadening by the paramagnetic cobalt ions, with the isotropic shifts being unchanged. Diﬀerent eﬃcient decoupling sequen- ces76,77 were applied to improve resolution, but they showed no improvement. Also, higher spinning frequencies (>25 kHz) with or without decoupling did show no improvement, as, for instance, observed for copper-containing samples.73 In our cobalt-containing samples, the couplings are probably much stronger due to the higher number of unpaired electrons. Contrary to reports on NMR of paramagnetic systems,78 here Figure 3. 13C CPMAS spectra of 1 and 2 in comparison with their corresponding protonated ligands. The spectral range between 20 and 110 ppm with no signal intensity is cut out to enlarge the relevant signal areas. The asterisk indicates a solvent signal from DMF that resides in the pores. The remaining DMF peaks (30.1 and 35.2 ppm) are not shown since the axis break starts at 20 ppm. The spectrum of 1 simulated based on the results of the CASTEP calculations is also included for comparison (top), with all carbon signals having equal intensity and identical line width (for simplicity, the line width of the 150 ppm peak is used for simulation). Inorganic Chemistry Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic302643w | Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX F by no means any additional carbon shifts were detected, but only severe line broadening is observed. Our current explanation is that we cannot detect those 13C spins in direct vicinity of Co2+, which either might have shifted to some totally unpredictable range or more probably are severely broadened to be indistinguishable from the baseline.79 The line broadening of the remaining 13C spins next to Zn2+ then indicates reduction in T2 or T2* due to the presence of nearby cobalt ions, thus indicating the formation of a heteronuclear Co/Zn MOF. Figure 7 illustrates the line-broadening eﬀects for various regions of carbon signals with increasing cobalt content. Note that, for the diamagnetic spectra, a line broadening of 5 Hz has been applied. It can be seen that the line broadening increases almost exponentially with the cobalt content, and for x ≥0.25, no reasonable spectra can be obtained. Regarding functional groups, the increase in line width is comparatively small for the regions of 8−16, 155−160, and 170−176 ppm (range I) compared to the regions of 120−141 and 143−155 ppm (range II). To quantify it more precisely, we calculated the corresponding slopes by omitting the value at xCo = 0.25 by a linear ﬁt. The slopes are found to be almost the same in range I, being 40% smaller than those in range II. This lets us conclude that the line broadening is strongly inﬂuenced by the bulk magnetic susceptibility68 originating from the para- magnetic ions, which shows no preference to functional groups. The broadening eﬀect is enhanced in condensed aromatic systems, which probably can be explained by stronger electron−electron interactions between the cobalt electrons and the π-electron systems of the aromatic and triazole rings. Figure 4. 2D 1H−13C FSLG HETCOR spectra of 1 (top) and 2 (bottom). Individual 1H projections for the diﬀerent 13C regions are shown. The asterisks indicate spinning sidebands. Coherences marked with a # indicate the resolution of carbon signals in the 2D plot that are not resolved in the 13C CPMAS spectrum, as can be seen by the nonspherical shape of the coherences. Inorganic Chemistry Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic302643w | Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX G 1H 1D spectra and 1H T1 relaxation experiments can also be used to monitor the inﬂuence of paramagnetic Co2+ in the MOF lattice. 1H MAS and static spectra for all samples were collected at 17.6 T, as illustrated for the MAS spectra of Series I in Figure 8. Without cobalt, the spectrum shows individual resonances, followed by a narrow sideband pattern due to homonuclear 1H−1H dipolar coupling. However, with increas- ing cobalt content in the isotropic region, only one signal can be resolved. Additionally, a wide sideband pattern extending up to 490 kHz is visible as a result of the inhomogeneous electron−nucleus dipolar interaction.69 The 1H static linewidths (fwhh = full width at half-height) recorded at two magnetic ﬁelds are shown as a function of cobalt content in Figure 9. A steady increase in line width with increasing cobalt content is observed, with the eﬀect being larger at higher ﬁeld. This observation is supported by the literature,67 where it has been shown that the major contribution to the line broadening comes from the electron−nuclear interaction, which has been shown to be linear dependent on magnetic ﬁeld. We note that, for sample xCo = 0.09 and 0.17 for Series I at 17.6 T, the 1H line width is slightly smaller than that at 2.35 T. We assign this to experimental uncertainties that do not contradict the general observation. Inﬂuence of Co2+ on the 1H Spin−Lattice Relaxation Time. The inﬂuence of paramagnetic ions on the proton relaxation times has been studied by several authors.80−82 It is the ﬂuctuating electron magnetic moments of paramagnetic centers that aﬀect the nuclear relaxation. Protons in the immediate vicinity of Co2+ ions (high-spin) are directly inﬂuenced. In fact, their longitudinal relaxation time gets severely shortened, and we assume that we cannot measure their short spin−lattice relaxation time.82 These protons act as relaxation sinks that inﬂuence the relaxation behavior of other distant protons via eﬃcient spin diﬀusion. Therefore, the measured T1 H is the average relaxation time of all the protons together. There are two diﬀerent possibilities for the distribution of Co2+ in the host framework: either it forms Co2+-rich domains separated from Zn2+-rich ones or both metal ions are distributed uniformly and only one domain can be identiﬁed. In the ﬁrst case, two relaxation rates would be expected for Zn2+ Figure 5. 2D 1H BABA spectrum of 1 (left) and 2 (right) recorded at a spinning frequency of 30 and 26 kHz, respectively. The 1H single pulse MAS spectrum, the calculated spectrum based on the CASTEP results (for 1), and the 1H projection of the 1H−13C HETCOR spectrum are also shown for comparison. The horizontal lines in the 2D spectrum indicate selected correlations between coupled protons, H8−H3/H4, H8−H6, H6−H4 (left) and H8/8a−H4, H8/8a−H3/H6 (right). Inorganic Chemistry Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic302643w | Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX H and Co2+ domains separately, whereas in the second case, only one. All the relaxation curves obtained could be well-ﬁtted with a single exponential function. The relaxation times are found to be strongly inﬂuenced by the paramagnetic Co2+, with a larger eﬀect at higher cobalt concentration. The paramagnetic contribution to the proton T1 can be calculated using the sum-of-rates equation71 as = + T T T 1 1 1 1 1 pure 1 para (1) where T1 para represents the paramagnetic contribution to the relaxation and T1 pure is the 1H T1 relaxation time of the pure Zn MOF. The 1/T1 para values as a function of Co2+ content for the two series at 2.35 T are shown in Figure 10 (left). For both series, the strong inﬂuence of paramagnetic cobalt on 1/T1 para is clearly documented from the linear relation. Figure 10 (right) shows a correlation between the minimum cobalt−cobalt distance and 1/T1 para. The former is calculated from the known metal−metal distances from the crystal structure and the relative content of cobalt. This indicates a uniform distribution of cobalt within the MOF framework because the average distance between cobalt centers as a source of relaxation decreases with increasing cobalt content. For cobalt contents higher than 50%, the minimum cobalt−cobalt distance is constant since the ﬁrst two metal neighbors have equal distance in the crystal structure. Clearly, the presence of more cobalt atoms inﬂuences the 1H relaxation even further but cannot be expressed from the minimum cobalt−cobalt distance. However, the analysis of 1H spin−lattice relaxation times indicates that, for the whole range of cobalt concentrations, a uniform distribution of zinc and cobalt metal centers is present. ■CONCLUSIONS The crystal structures of two series of isomorphous MOFs have been determined. 1H and 13C chemical shifts of both series of Zn MOFs are reported and compared to their corresponding protonated ligands. The eﬀect of metal coordination is monitored by changes in the chemical shifts of those carbon atoms participating in the metal coordination, which is as large as 6.3 ppm. 13C assignments were achieved by combining the diﬀerent methods, spectral editing, heteronuclear correlation spectra, and CASTEP calculations for 1. The two ligand molecules in the asymmetric unit give rise to one signal set each that is clearly documented in the 13C spectra. The assignments of 1H chemical shifts was done based on the 1H projections from the FSLG-HETCOR experiments and CASTEP calculations for 1. These were veriﬁed by the 2D double quantum BABA spectra that identify close couplings between diﬀerent protons. Rather high (9.3 ppm) and low (5.0 ppm) shifts for aromatic protons are observed that agree with calculations and the latter can be explained, for example, by the shielding of these protons which are positioned above (below) the face of the aromatic rings. In two series of heteronuclear MOFs, the incorporation of paramagnetic Co2+ into the MOF structure being able to replace the Zn2+ ion in the full range of concentrations is documented by an increased line width in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Furthermore, a correlation of the paramagnetic Figure 6. 13C CPMAS spectra for selected samples of Series I, showing the inﬂuence of paramagnetic cobalt. Figure 7.

Inorganic Chemistry Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic302643w | Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX I contribution to the 1H spin−lattice relaxation time with the minimum Co−Co distance was obtained, which corroborates a uniform distribution of Co2+ and Zn2+ in the MOF structure. With this contribution, we have documented that the combination of diﬀerent solid-state NMR techniques shows excellent agreement with predictions of chemical shifts based on X-ray structures and DFT calculations. Though this probably has to be veriﬁed on other MOF materials, we expect that, in the future, solid-state NMR can be used as a standard technique for the characterization of MOFs, especially for those with low crystallinity or even those lacking crystallinity. These materials might still show excellent properties for diﬀerent applications. We will orient our eﬀorts in this direction. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information IR, thermogravimetric, and temperature-dependent PXRD data and atomic coordinates of 2 are given in the Supporting Information.

After cooling to room temperature, 5 ml of H2O/MeOH were carefully added as a second layer. A third layer consisting of 22.0 mg Zn(OAc)2·2H2O dissolved in 2 ml MeOH was slowly added on top. Afterwards the test tube was sealed with cotton wool and left for seven days until colorless, prismatic crystals were obtained. Yield: 14.3 mg (23.9 µmol, 48%) Single crystals of [Co(Me2-trzpba)2]·1.5H2O·DMF were obtained in a similar reaction using 25.0 mg Co(OAc)2·4H2O instead of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O. ∗To whom correspondence should be addressed 1 The heteronuclear Zn/Co MOFs of Series II, [Zn1−xCox(Me2-trzpba)2] (x = 0.03 - 0.99), were obtained by reacting mixtures of the respective metal acetates with H(Me2-trzpba) under the same conditions.

Afterwards for the TG curve a plateau is observed until 420◦C, where decomposition of the network starts. Between 200◦C and 340◦C, the DTA curve shows an endothermic process, followed by the decomposition of the networks as endothermic processes.

For the pure Co MOF in Series II, no single crystal structure is available. 420◦C are observed. The ﬁrst phase transition takes place between 100◦C-120◦C and corresponds to the loss of solvent molecules as evidenced by the TG-DTA measurements. It can be anticipated that the resulting phase belongs to the tetragonal crystal system as the reﬂections of the orthorhom- bic low temperature phase are merging continously. The second transition occurs at 200◦C and the third at 320◦C. Both transitions are not connected to mass losses as evidenced by TG curves and correspond well to the observed endothermic process between 200◦C-340◦C in the DTA curve. Eventually, as described earlier, decomposition of the networks occurs above 420◦C. 3 Table S 3: Atom coordinates, isotropic and anisotropic displacement parameters, Uiso and Ui j [104 pm2] of 2 x y z Uiso U11 U22 U33 U23 U13 U12 C1 0.1306 1.3773 0.4989 0.0311 0.0282 0.028 0.038 -0.001 0.003 0.0037 C2 0.1810 1.2280 0.5122 0.0282 0.025 0.025 0.034 -0.0044 0.000 0.0006 C3 0.2555 1.2535 0.5214 0.0380 0.029 0.024 0.062 -0.005 -0.006 -0.0045 C4 0.3020 1.1174 0.5337 0.0346 0.022 0.030 0.051 -0.004 -0.006 -0.0023 C5 0.2731 0.9532 0.5343 0.0274 0.026 0.026 0.031 -0.0008 0.0021 0.0038 C6 0.1993 0.9250 0.5246 0.0321 0.028 0.023 0.045 -0.0032 0.003 -0.0026 C7 0.1531 1.0630 0.5146 0.029 0.0220 0.027 0.040 -0.0041 0.0016 -0.0011 C8 0.4101 0.8617 0.4483 0.0375 0.037 0.038 0.037 0.014 0.007 0.009 C9 0.3794 0.7629 0.5076 0.0251 0.0237 0.026 0.025 0.002 -0.001 0.0018 C10 0.3114 0.6822 0.5940 0.0325 0.030 0.032 0.036 0.007 0.008 -0.002 C11 0.2529 0.6794 0.6477 0.0557 0.055 0.061 0.052 0.017 0.029 0.010 C12 0.4828 -0.2734 0.1023 0.0376 0.036 0.039 0.038 -0.012 -0.005 0.006 C13 0.4766 -0.1265 0.1530 0.0335 0.037 0.032 0.031 -0.008 -0.003 0.004 C14 0.4494 -0.1621 0.2177 0.0550 0.097 0.032 0.037 -0.002 0.013 -0.014 C15 0.4432 -0.0321 0.2664 0.0547 0.096 0.038 0.030 0.001 0.018 -0.011 C16 0.4661 0.1304 0.2504 0.0296 0.036 0.029 0.024 -0.004 -0.002 0.0036 C17 0.4922 0.1693 0.1855 0.0383 0.056 0.029 0.030 -0.002 0.005 -0.007 C18 0.4973 0.0382 0.1366 0.0388 0.050 0.039 0.027 -0.003 0.010 -0.002 C19 0.5659 0.1853 0.3777 0.0444 0.045 0.050 0.038 -0.009 -0.005 0.021 C20 0.4979 0.2809 0.3616 0.0292 0.033 0.028 0.027 -0.0019 -0.004 0.002 C21 0.3999 0.3716 0.3085 0.0385 0.043 0.040 0.032 -0.005 -0.007 0.017 C22 0.3428 0.3895 0.2549 0.067 0.063 0.084 0.053 -0.025 -0.026 0.037 C23 0.3443 0.1835 0.7143 0.084 0.088 0.097 0.067 -0.028 0.009 -0.025 C24 0.3992 0.4440 0.7543 0.105 0.122 0.088 0.103 -0.029 -0.028 -0.001 C25 0.3449 0.244 0.8365 0.141 0.229 0.126 0.067 -0.006 0.021 0.051 N1 0.4047 0.6166 0.5310 0.0246 0.0258 0.023 0.025 0.0018 0.0006 0.0007 N2 0.3618 0.5660 0.5868 0.0314 0.032 0.027 0.035 0.0077 0.0053 -0.0010 N3 0.3205 0.8089 0.5459 0.0272 0.0241 0.0250 0.033 0.0012 0.0042 0.0015 N4 0.4674 0.3979 0.3999 0.0290 0.033 0.027 0.026 -0.0031 -0.0029 0.0035 N5 0.4046 0.4563 0.3661 0.0389 0.045 0.041 0.032 -0.007 -0.007 0.017 N6 0.4576 0.2603 0.3024 0.0303 0.036 0.030 0.025 -0.0048 -0.0044 0.0065 N7 0.3610 0.2877 0.7672 0.085 0.107 0.091 0.057 -0.013 -0.009 0.023 O1 0.0628 1.3407 0.4940 0.0338 0.0274 0.0288 0.045 -0.004 -0.003 0.0051 O2 0.1561 1.5232 0.4928 0.0488 0.0367 0.0255 0.084 0.001 0.003 0.0012 O3 0.5062 -0.2400 0.0419 0.0417 0.046 0.040 0.039 -0.0139 0.002 0.0040 O4 0.4666 -0.4197 0.1206 0.0565 0.080 0.030 0.059 -0.012 0.001 0.002 O5A 0.3280 0.025 0.7266 0.098 - - - - - - O5B 0.3014 0.067 0.7143 0.098 - - - - - - O6 0.2605 0.6224 0.3952 0.0800 0.053 0.083 0.104 0.006 0.021 0.016 O7A 0.2761 0.948 0.3350 0.057 - - - - - - O7B 0.2829 0.890 0.3126 0.057 - - - - - - Zn1 0.49186 0.47462 0.50001 0.02282 0.0240 0.0196 0.0248 -0.0003 -0.0011 0.0003 4 Figure S 2: TG-DTA analyses of [M(Me2trz-pba)2]·1.5 H2O·DMF (M = Zn (black); M = Co (blue)).
