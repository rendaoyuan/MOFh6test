These transformations are directed by cooperative bond breakage and formation, resulting in expansion or contraction of the 3D framework by up to 33% due to the ﬂexible nature of the organic linker. These MOFs displays highly selective uptake of divalent transition-metal cations (e.g., Co2+ and Ni2+) over alkali-metal cations (Li+ and Na+). M etal−organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely investigated because of their potential applications in areas such as gas storage/separation,1,2 ion exchange,3 magnet- ism,4 catalysis,5 and nonlinear optics.6 Flexible MOFs have received particular recent attention because they can exhibit structural transformations upon single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SC−SC) processes triggered by external stimuli,7,8 a feature that can be accompanied by fascinating changes in host−guest behavior,9,10 magnetism,11 and photochemical reactivity,12 for example. Such transformations are generally accompanied (or generated) by the removal/addition of guest molecules13 or exchange of coordinated metal ions or counterions,14,15 processes in which the framework integrity is often retained. A seminal example of ﬂexible MOF formation is MIL-53 as reported by Férey and co-workers.16 The cell volume in said system varies by ∼40% between large-pore and narrow-pore forms, with respective expansion/contraction of the frameworks during adsorption/desorption of suitable guest molecules. In general, SC−SC processes involving the robust rearrangement of framework structures are comparatively rare because single crystals usually fail to maintain their crystallinity upon transformation. Herein we report soft anionic MOFs, constructed from the ﬂexible organic linker tetrakis[4- (carboxyphenyl)oxamethyl]methane acid (H4L) (Figure 1A), that act as transition metal (TM) cation receptors via ligand- directing SC−SC structural rearrangement (Figure 1B,C). These transformations involve incorporation of TM2+ cations into the anionic networks to aﬀord neutral and heterobimetallic systems. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the ﬁrst documented report of capture of metal ions by soft anionic MOFs in the solid state, the transformations of which involve cooperative bond breaking and formation rather than the more frequently encountered counterion-exchange mechanism.3,14,15b Interest in the coordination chemistry of H4L has been driven by both its ﬂexibility and its varied mode of coordination with TM ions.17 The reaction of H4L with Zn2+ under diﬀerent conditions aﬀords seven isomers based on diﬀerent Zn clusters that act as secondary building units (SBUs).18 Diverse ligand geometries such as tetrahedral, irregular, or near-ﬂattened are observed in these solids, and this ﬂexibility arises from twisting of the benzoate moieties around the central quaternary carbon atom (denoted as Ccore in Figure 1A) through ether links. With this in mind, we sought to explore the potential for constructing stimuli-responsive ﬂexible MOFs from H4L.

Soc. 2012, 134, 9581−9584 = N,N-dimethylacetamide) were recently reported by Cao and co-workers.19 These MOFs crystallize in the triclinic space group P1̅, and the asymmetric unit comprises one L4−ligand, two crystallographically independent TM2+ ions, and a [NH2(CH3)2]+ counterion generated in situ under solvother- mal conditions. One of the TM2+ ions is in a general position, while the other resides on an inversion center with 50% site occupancy. In our hands, two MOFs with the general anionic framework formula [Mn3(L)2]2−(1) were obtained under solvothermal conditions from diﬀering ratios of N,N- dimethylformamide (DMF) and water: [Mn3(L)2]2−·2- [NH 2(CH 3) 2] +·9DMF (1a) and [Mn 3(L) 2] 2 −·2- [H3O]+·12DMF (1b) [for experimental details, see the Supporting Information (SI)]. Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction (SCXRD) studies revealed that both structures display the same connectivity between the Mn3 SBUs and L4−linkers, resulting in anionic 3D frameworks with the same topology but disparate counterions (Figure S1 in the SI). Although this is the case, diﬀerent conformations of L4−in the solids results in varied dimensionality in 1a and 1b; the unit cell volume of 1a (V = 2671 Å3) is 14% smaller than that of 1b (V = 3052 Å3). Comparison of the conformations of L4−in 1a and 1b clearly shows that along the a axis, two of the four arms of L4−are more splayed in 1b than in 1a, causing the a axis of 1b to be 1.7 Å longer (Figure S2). Thus, the anionic framework of 1b can be regarded as an “expanded” form of 1a. The ﬂexibility of L4− within these anionic MOFs prompted us to investigate the possibility of exchanging the Mn2+ or NH2(CH3)2 +/H3O+ ions with other TM2+ ions such as Co2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+. A colorless single crystal of 1a was ﬁxed to the top of a glass ﬁber and immersed in a 0.2 M DMF solution of cobalt(II) nitrate. The crystal did not dissolve but turned to light-purple color within a few hours, indicating penetration of Co2+ into the framework. After 24 h, a deep-purple crystal of 2 was obtained and analyzed crystallographically. Surprisingly, the crystal structure of 2 is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that of 1a, despite the fact that they have the same space group and similar unit cell parameters. The asymmetric unit of 2 comprises one L4−linker, one aqua ligand, and three crystallographically independent Mn2+/Co2+ ions; two of these reside on inversion centers with 50% site occupancy while the third occupies a general position. In comparison with 1a, the SBU in 2 becomes neutral by uptake of one TM2+ (with 50% site occupancy) per asymmetric unit. On the basis of elemental analysis (EA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) studies, the formula of 2 was found to be MnCo3L2(H2O)2·12DMF. This implies that in addition to insertion of additional Co2+ into the framework, partial exchange of Mn2+ for Co2+ also occurs. Such an insertion/ exchange process, proceeding via an SC−SC transformation, must therefore involve the cooperative breakage/formation of metal−carboxylate bonds. This is evidenced by the fact that in moving from 1a to 2, two of the four carboxylate groups in the L4−ligand change their coordination modes (Figure S3). To provide a better understanding of the mechanism of the SC− SC transformation, we carefully compared the structural features of these two MOFs. Figure 2 shows extended structures of 1a and 2 along the b axis. In 1a, the Mn3 SBUs align along the c axis and are mutually interconnected by L4− linkers with a short distance (7.0 Å) between two nearest neighboring clusters. Insertion of Co2+ ions in the synthesis of 2 results in linkage of discrete Mn3 clusters in 1a to aﬀord an inﬁnite MnCo chain with a zigzag arrangement along the c axis. One octahedral Co2+ (Co1 and its symmetry equivalents) resides on an inversion center (between the positions of two neighboring Mn3 SBUs in 1a) and is bonded by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from diﬀerent L4−linkers and two oxygen atoms from aquo ligands. We hypothesize that in order to connect the inserted Co2+ (Co1) and meet the constraints of octahedral geometry, the carboxylate groups coordinated to two nearby terminal Mn2+ ions (Mn2 and Mn2A) of the Mn3 SBUs in 1a must change their coordination modes with a high degree of cooperativity: the chelating carboxylate groups change to bridging mode, the chelating/bridging carboxylate groups change to μ3-η2:η1-bridging mode, and the bridging carboxylate groups remain the same (Figure 2). This would mean that the terminal octahedral Mn2+ ions of the Mn3 SBUs in 1a would become four-coordinate with tetrahedral geometry prior to displacement by the Co2+ (Co2 and Co2A) ions. This theory is based on the short Co−O bond lengths evident in 2 (four Co2−O bonds in the range 1.950−2.043 Å). The variation in the coordination mode of the carboxylate groups is directed by the rotation around Ccore within the L4−linker, resulting in a slight change in ligand conformation and an expansion of the entire framework by 6.5% in going from 1a to 2. Single crystals of 1b are also transformed into 2 via a similar SC−SC process when treated in an identical fashion, and in this case, the framework contracts by 7.5%, demonstrating that the L4−linker can adjust its conformation to allow for either expansion or contraction of frameworks of 1. The insertion of Co2+ ions into the anionic framework of 1 indicated that other dications such as Zn2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ may be accommodated, given the degree of ligand versatility observed. Crystals of 1a were found to capture Cu2+ from a DMF solution via a process similar to that for Co2+ capture. An intermediate structure of Cu2+-inserted crystals (1a-Cu) was successfully solved and found to be isostructural to that of the Co2+-inserted analogue (Figure S4), but these crystals persistently lost their monocrystallinity following completion of the insertion/exchange process over a 24 h period. The insertion of either Mg2+ or Zn2+ into 1a resulted in crystal cracking/degradation and loss of single-crystallinity, thus preventing further structural analysis. Notably, crystals of 1a captured Ni2+ ions via an SC−SC process that is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that for either Co2+ or Cu2+. Light-green crystals Figure 2. Crystallographic views of (left) 1a and (right) 2 along the b axis (C, gray; O, red; Mn, cyan; Co, purple). The arrows propose how the carboxylate groups coordinated to two nearby terminal Mn2+ ions (Mn2 and Mn2A) of the Mn3 SBUs in 1a move cooperatively to connect the inserted Co2+ (shown as Co1 on the right-hand side).

Soc. 2012, 134, 9581−9584 9582 of 3 were obtained when 1a or 1b was soaked in a 0.2 M DMF solution of nickel(II) nitrate for 24 h. SCXRD analysis revealed that 3 retains the same space group (P1̅) but has a much larger unit cell volume (V = 3541 Å3) than 1a. The asymmetric unit of 3 comprises one L4−linker, three and a half aquo ligands, half a ligated DMF, and three crystallographically independent Mn2+/ Ni2+ ions, implying the insertion of Ni2+ into the 1a framework. EA, TGA, and EDX studies indicated the formula of 3 to be Mn1.3Ni2.7L2(H2O)7(DMF)·16DMF. Comparison of the struc- tural features of 1a and 3 indicates how the SC−SC transformation proceeds. Figure 3 shows views of 1a and 3 along the b axis. The 3D framework of 1a can be viewed as discrete 2D layers interconnected by the carboxylate groups coordinated to the terminal Mn2+ cations (Mn2 and Mn2A) of the Mn3 SBUs in a chelating coordination mode. The distance between neighboring layers is 11.664 Å. We hypothesize that the chelating carboxylate groups in 1a are cleaved from the terminal Mn2+ cations and that two proximal (now unbound) carboxylate groups coordinate to an inserted Ni2+ cation (Ni1). These would be located at apical positions, with ligated solvent molecules occupying the equatorial plane of the resulting octahedral geometry. In addition, each terminal Mn2+ of the Mn3 SBU (with 85% probability) in 1a is displaced by a Ni2+ ion, with two aquo ligands replacing the cleaved chelating carboxylate group to maintain an octahedral geometry. The overall result of this process would be the trimetallic NiMnNi cluster as the SBU of 3. It is noted that to accommodate the insertion of Ni2+ between the 2D layers of 1a, these layers are pushed ∼5 Å further apart in 3, a feature directed by a conformational change in the L4−linker. As a result, the a axis of 3 is signiﬁcantly longer than that of 1a, with an overall expansion of 33% upon SC−SC transformation. It is worth mentioning that attempts to synthesize 2 and 3 by conventional means (by combining mixed metal salts) failed, indicating that cation-insertion-induced SC−SC transformations represent a feasible method for the generation of new coordination compounds from anionic MOFs constructed with ﬂexible ligands. Photometric experiments were conducted to establish the cation uptake capabilities and kinetics of bulk 1a over a 48 h period (Figure S5). Co2+ was used as a suitable probe for uptake experiments because of its stability and UV spectro- scopic proﬁle. Framework 1a was introduced into a 0.2 M DMF solution of cobalt(II) nitrate, and the concentration was measured as a function of time; the observed Co2+ concentration was found to decrease by 19% over 8.5 and 37% over 24 h. No signiﬁcant decrease in Co2+ concentration was detected after 24 h, indicating uptake completion. The overall Co2+ uptake capacity of 1a was found to be 3.12 mol mol−1 (93 mg g−1), which correlates with the results of SCXRD and EDX analysis. Additional EDX studies were performed to evaluate the selective uptake/exchange capabilities of 1a toward a series of divalent metal ions (Zn2+ > Cu2+ > Co2+ > Ni2+ ≫ Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Sr2+). It was further demonstrated that crystals of 1a selectively capture Cu2+ from a DMF solution containing equimolar amounts of Cu2+ and Ca2+, implying that 1a could be used to sequester divalent cations from a mixture (Table S1 in the SI). Interestingly, 1a shows highly selective uptake of TM2+ ions in the presence of multiple competing alkali-metal cations such as Li+ and Na+. Powder XRD (PXRD) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) studies of crystalline 1a immersed in a DMF solution of either lithium or sodium nitrate showed that the anionic framework of 1a remained unchanged but that the NH2(CH3)2 + counterions were fully replaced by Li+ or Na+ ions. Subsequent competition reactions between combinations of either cobalt(II) nitrate or nickel(II) nitrate and lithium nitrate or sodium nitrate followed by ICP-OES and EDX measurements indicated that either Co2+ or Ni2+ ions were preferentially sequestered by 1a, with only trace amounts of Li+ or Na+ detected (Table S2). The soft framework of 1a shows a strong preference for Co2+/ Ni2+ via SC−SC processes, and this may be explained by the signiﬁcantly stronger interaction of carboxylate groups with the TM2+ cations. The ability to interchange and control the metal composition in such systems has the clear potential to vary the magnetic properties of the resulting solid.4 Magnetic susceptibility measurements on powdered microcrystalline samples of complexes 1−3 were carried out in an applied ﬁeld of 0.1 T, and the data are plotted as the χMT product versus temperature (Figure S6). For all of the compounds, the data are somewhat similar: χMT decreases slowly with decreasing temperature, indicative of relatively weak antiferromagnetic interactions between neighboring metal ions. The plots of χ−1 versus T (not shown) were linear, permitting ﬁts to the Curie−Weiss law, χ−1 = (T −Θ)/C, which aﬀorded Weiss constants (Θ) of −14.4 K (1a), −10.5 K (2), and −9.30 K (3). For complex 1, the susceptibility data could be ﬁtted to the simple isotropic Hamiltonian Ĥ = −2J(ŜMn1·ŜMn2 + ŜMn2·ŜMn3), which describes the system as a series of magnetically isolated Mn1−Mn2−Mn3 linear trimers in which all of the M···M interactions are equivalent. The upper solid red line in Figure S6 is the ﬁt with JMn−Mn = −1.42 cm−1 and g = 2.00. The data for complex 3 could be treated in a similar fashion by assuming isolated linear Ni1−Mn1−Ni2 chains [Ĥ = −2J(ŜNi1·ŜMn1 + ŜMn1·ŜNi2)] and noninteracting (paramagnetic) Ni monomers. The lower solid red line in Figure S6 is the ﬁt with JNi−Mn = −1.43 cm−1 and g = 2.21. The magnetochemical analysis of Co(II)-based complexes Figure 3. Crystallographic views of framework structures of (top) 1a and (bottom) 3 along the b crystal axis (C, gray; O, red; Mn, cyan; Ni, green). The arrows propose how the chelating carboxylate groups coordinated to terminal Mn2+ ions (Mn2 and Mn2A) of the Mn3 SBUs in 1a adapt to connect the inserted Ni2+ (Ni1).

Soc. 2012, 134, 9581−9584 9583 is nontrivial because of the combined eﬀects of spin−orbit coupling and the distortion of the octahedral crystal ﬁeld. This and the presence of signiﬁcant crystallographic disorder precluded any meaningful quantitative analysis of the magnetic data for complex 2. In summary, we have demonstrated that soft anionic MOFs (1a and 1b) are capable of sequestering metal cations through cooperative SC−SC processes, resulting in novel neutral and heterobimetallic systems with rearranged framework structures. These SC−SC transformations are directed by adaptation of the conformation and coordination modes of the ﬂexible organic carboxylate linker (L4−) to meet the coordination environment of inserted/exchanged metal ions, a process involving cooperative breakage/formation of metal−carboxylate coordination bonds in the solid state. These anionic MOFs also exhibit exceptional uptake/exchange selectivity for TM2+ ions in the presence of competing alkali-metal cations. In stark contrast to the rigid open 3D frameworks of zeolites, which tend to be less aﬀected by ion exchange, the framework ﬂexibility observed for the soft anionic MOFs reported here holds great potential for the design of selective sensors, selective ion-exchange media, and materials for the removal of toxic heavy-metal ions, all of which will be the focus of future studies.20 ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Sample preparation and characterization, including TGA, PXRD, and EDX data; crystallographic data (CIF); and additional structural ﬁgures.

Crystallographic parameters for 1a, 1b, 1-Cu, 2 and 3 SI 3 Experimental details: Materials and Methods ：Tetrakis[4-(carboxyphenyl)oxamethyl]methane acid (H4L) was synthesized according to published procedures.1 All metal salts and DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) (Sigma-Aldrich) were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240 CHN elemental analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were recorded on a D/Max-2500 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Thermal analyses (N2 atmosphere, heating rate of 5 °C/min) were carried out in a Labsys NETZSCH TG 209 Setaram apparatus. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was measured on a JEOL-7500F Microscope equipped with an energy–dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) instrument. ICP was measured by ICP-9000(N+M) (USA Thermo Jarrell-Ash Corp). A portion of the research was performed using EMSL, a national scientific user facility sponsored by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research and located at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (USA). Syntheses of structures. For all structures, TGA and elemental analysis revealed the amount of solvent in the crystals and were taken into account to decide the formula unit and calculate the yield. Synthesis of 1a: Tetrakis[4-(carboxyphenyl)oxamethyl]methane acid (H4L) (30.8 mg, 0.05 mmol) and MnCl2•4H2O (22 mg, 0.11mmol) were added to a mixture of (DMF) (4 mL) and H2O (100 µL) in a capped vial, sonicated to mix, and heated to 110 °C for 72 followed by slow cooling to room temperature over 8 h. Block-shaped colorless crystals of 1a were obtained in a 72% yield (based on H4L). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 1a SI 4 [Mn3(L)2]2-·2[NH2(CH3)2]+·9DMF: C, 55.77; H, 5.93; N, 7.19%. Found: C, 55.28; H, 5.84; N, 7.42%. Synthesis of 1b: H4L (30.8 mg, 0.05 mmol) and MnCl2•4H2O (22 mg, 0.11mmol) were added to a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (4 mL) and H2O (1 mL) in a capped vial, sonicated to mix, and heated to 110 °C for 24 h, followed by slow cooling to room temperature over 8 h. Bar-shaped colorless crystals of 1b were obtained in a 68% yield (based on H4L). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 1b [Mn3(L)2]2-·2H3O+·12DMF: C, 53.06; H, 5.98; N, 7.28%. Found: C, 52.09; H, 5.76; N, 6.78%. Note: one of the two solvated protons (2H3O+) per formula unit balancing the framework charge were found by X-ray diffraction analysis but the other one is suggested by TGA and elemental analysis. Transformation of 1a (or 1b) to 2 and 3: Fresh colorless crystals of 1a (or 1b) were briefly dried on filter paper and prior to immersion in a DMF solution of either Co(NO3)2 or Ni(NO3)2 (to afford 2 and 3 respectively). Upon standing the color of the immersed crystals gradually changed to purple and light-green, respectively. The crystals of 2 and 3 were filtered and washed with DMF. Following this, cation-captured crystals were stored in fresh DMF for convenient observation and to further remove any residual surface impurities. Cation capture/exchange experiments: The fresh colorless crystals of 1a (or 1b) were briefly dried on the filter paper, and then 20mg crystals were immersed in 2 mL DMF solution of M(NO3)2·xH2O (M=Zn, Cu, Co, Ni, Mg, Ca, Sr) or YNO3 (Y=Li, Na) with a molarity of 0.2 M/L (0.1 M/L for Sr2+). After three days, the crystals were filtered and washed with sufficient DMF to remove surface-absorbed cations. Then the crystals were examined by EDX or ICP-OES studies to decide the metal ratios (Table S1 and Table S2). For the selective metal ion capture experiments, the crystals were immersed in the blended DMF solution containing both metal SI 5 salts (0.2 M/L). For the UV-vis study of Co(II) ions capture process, 535mg (0.25mmol) crystals of 1a were soaked in 10 mL DMF solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2 M/L). X-Ray Structure Determination：All crystallographic data (Table S3) were collected with a Bruker Kappa APEX II Single Crystal Diffractometer, which was equipped with graphite monochromatic Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Structures were solved by direct methods with the SHELXTL-97 program and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques against F2 with the SHELXTL-97 program package.2 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms were located and refined isotropically. The contribution of disordered solvent molecules was treated as a diffuse using the Squeeze procedure in Platon.3 The resulting new HKL4 files were used to further refine the structures. CCDC 873429 (1a), 873431(1b), 873432 (2), 873430 (Cu- inserted 1a), and 873433 (3) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.
