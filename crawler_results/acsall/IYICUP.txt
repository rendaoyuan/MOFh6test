These three Ln-Co-based PCPs have similar rock-salt types and highly symmetrical porous structure and show a reversible structural collapse-regeneration accompa- nied by water-vapor desorption-adsorption. Similar struc tural regeneration was also observed for the Gd-Co PCP upon exposure to MeOH and CH3CN vapors, whereas the remaining two PCPs barely responded to organic vapors. P orous coordination polymers (PCPs) have attracted consid- erable attention over recent decades because of their con- trollable frameworks, interesting gas- and vapor-adsorption properties, and catalytic activity, among other properties.1-3 Until now, various metal ions and bridging ligands have been used to achieve large surface areas, to enhance host-guest interaction for hydrogen storage, and to introduce a catalytic active site inside their nanosized pores.4-6 The use of a metal- complex ligand as a bridging ligand is also one of the most useful methods of building new multifunctional PCPs.7 In addition, the stepwise synthesis of PCPs using metal-complex ligands may enable us to create new multifunctional materials more system- atically owing to the versatile functions of the metal-complex ligand.8 In this study, to build new multifunctional PCPs on the basis of the versatility of the [M(bpy)3] (bpy = 2,20-bipyridine) com- plex series, we used the cobalt(III) complex [Co(dcbpy)3]3- (H2dcbpy = 4,40-dicarboxy-2,20-bipyridine) as the metal-com- plex ligand. It is well-known that [M(bpy)3]-type metal complexes exhibit several interesting properties, including photosensitizers and O2-evolving catalysts of [Ru(bpy)n] deri- vatives, and spin crossover in the [CoII(trpy)2] moiety (trpy = 2,20,60,200-terpyridine), for example.9,10 We chose lanthanide ions as connectors in the [Co(dcbpy)3]3- complex ligands because of their ﬂexible and variable coordination modes.11 In this Communication, we report the syntheses, crystal structures, and vapor-adsorption properties of three PCPs, {La[Co- (dcbpy)3] 3 14H2O} (La-Co), {Nd[Co(dcbpy)3] 3 14H2O} (Nd-Co), and {Gd[Co(dcbpy)3] 3 14H2O} (Gd-Co), and demonstrate that the structural ﬂexibilities and vapor-adsorption properties of these PCPs strongly depend on f metal ions, despite their similar crystal structures. Figure 1 shows the crystal structures of La-Co and Gd-Co PCPs. These PCPs were synthesized by the simple reaction of [Co(Hdcbpy)3] and LnCl3 in basic aqueous solutions (see the Supporting Information, SI). The structures of all three PCPs are essentially of the rock-salt type. Among the three Ln-Co-based PCPs, only La-Co crystallized in the orthorhombic Fddd space group, while the others crystallized in the cubic Fm3m group. The metal-complex ligand [Co(dcbpy)3]3- coordinated to six Ln3þ ions to form a three-dimensional porous framework. The Co-N bond distances (1.89-1.94 Å) indicate that the Co ion remains in the trivalent oxidation state. Interestingly, two en- antiomers of Λ- and Δ-[Co(dcbpy)3]3- were disordered in Nd-Co and Gd-Co, but they were ordered in La-Co (Figure S1 in the SI) despite their almost identical synthetic procedures except for the diﬀerence in the f metal sources. In our preliminary results of the other Ln-Co PCPs, only two PCPs with La3þ and Ce3þ ions adopted the ordered Fddd structures, implying that the structural ordering of two enantiomers may be related to the ionic radius of the Ln3þ ion. Two of the six carboxyl groups in La-Co coordinated to La3þ ions in a monodentate fashion, while the other four coordinated in a bidentate fashion. By contrast, all of the carboxyl groups in Nd-Co and Gd-Co coordinated to the Ln3þ ion in a bidentate fashion. Thus, the coordination number of the La3þ ion was 10, while those of Nd3þ and Gd3þ were 12. It is noteworthy that all three PCPs have a large void space, approximately 55%, 51%, and 50% PCP volume in the unit cell (calculated using the PLATON SQUEEZE program12), for the La-Co, Nd-Co, and Gd-Co PCPs, respectively, which are probably occupied by water molecules in each case. Although the hydration numbers of these PCPs could not be determined by X-ray structural analyses owing to disorder of the water molecules, elemental analysis suggests that the hydration numbers of all three Ln-Co PCPs are 14. To investigate the rigidity of the porous framework of the three PCPs, powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) patterns were measured. As shown in Figure 2, the PXRD patterns of the La- Co and Gd-Co PCPs obtained after drying under vacuum are featureless amorphous patterns. IR spectra of the original and dried La-Co were almost identical with each other (see Figure S2 in the SI), suggesting that desorption of water did not aﬀect the local structure around the [Co(dcbpy)3]3- anion. Thus, the porous frameworks of these PCPs are not suﬃciently rigid to retain the porous structure without crystal water molecules.

Chem. 2011, 50, 2061–2063 Inorganic Chemistry COMMUNICATION However, interestingly, crystalline patterns identical with simula- tions based on the crystal structures were recovered upon exposure of the amorphous PCPs to water vapor. Similar changes in the PXRD pattern were observed for the Nd-Co PCP (Figure S3 in the SI). These results clearly show that the long-range structural ordering of Ln-Co-based PCPs is reversibly de- stroyed and regenerated by desorption and adsorption of water. It should be noted that the structure of the Gd-Co PCP could also be regenerated by exposure to methanol and acetonitrile vapors, but, surprisingly, such structural regeneration by these vapors was hardly observed for the La-Co PCP despite their similar structures. The Nd-Co PCP showed slightly similar structural regeneration under exposure to both methanol and acet- onitrile vapors (Figure S3 in the SI). Under exposure to other organic vapors, including ethanol, acetone, chloroform, n-hexane, and diethyl ether, the three Ln-Co PCPs failed to show structural regeneration (Figures S3-S5 in the SI). These results suggest that the radius of the f metal ion and disorder of the two enantiomers of [Co(dcbpy)3]3- signiﬁcantly aﬀect the ﬂexibility of the crystal lattice and its adsorption properties. For greater insight into this structural ﬂexibility, we measured the water-vapor-adsorption isotherms of these three Ln-Co PCPs, as shown in Figure 3. As expected from the results of the PXRD measurements, these PCPs can adsorb considerable amounts of water vapor, approximately 16.1, 14.5, and 13.5 mol 3 mol-1 for the La-Co, Nd-Co, and Gd-Co PCPs at saturated vapor pressure, respectively. These saturated amounts are close to the hydration numbers estimated from elemental analyses and seem to be proportional to the relative size of the void. It is interesting to note that the La-Co PCP can adsorb water vapor more eﬀectively at a very low pressure, whereas the other two PCPs adsorb it above P/P0 = 0.04 (inset of Figure 3). This diﬀerence may be related to disorder of the two [Co(dcbpy)3]3- Figure 1.

In summary, we synthesized three new rock-salt-type PCPs using lanthanide ions, Ln3þ, and a [Co(dcbpy)3]3- metal-complex ligand anddemonstrateda structuralcollapse-regenerationaccompanied by water-vapor desorption-adsorption. Interestingly, substitution of the lanthanide ion allowed us to modify the structural ﬂexibilities and adsorption properties dramatically, despite their similar rock- salt-type structures. Further studies focused on structural tuning using other lanthanide ions and functionalization of this PCP system by replacement of the [Co(dcbpy)3]3- metal-complex ligand are now in progress. ’ASSOCIATED CONTENT b S Supporting Information.
