R. China b S Supporting Information ’INTRODUCTION Remarkable progress has been achieved in the study of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), not only due to their variety of topologies and intriguing structures1 but also owing to their interesting physical and chemical properties, such as sensing materials,2 magnetism,3 gas adsorption,4 ion exchange,5 and catalysis.6 The use of multidentate organic ligands and suitable metal salts to construct metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) has been a major strategy of supramolecular chemistry in recent years.7 As far as we know, compared with ﬂexible ligands, rigid ligands with desired geometry, have been more inclined to be used to speciﬁcally design topologies. However, predictive coordination chemistry is still a challenge and deserves our careful study, because there are many other facts that can aﬀect the structure, such as the nature of the metal ions, the tempera- ture, the solvent, and the counterions.8 Besides that, the co- ordinating competition of the metal center between ligands and water molecules can aﬀect the structure. Recently, we synthesized a rigid tripodal ligand H3L = 50- carboxyl-[1,10:30,100-terphenyl]-4,400-dicarboxylic acid (H3L).9 Matzger and co-workers thought reduced symmetry linkers could oﬀer the potential to expose new regions of phase space and, ﬁnally, might discover novel materials.10 Besides, we con- sider the following aspects: First, multicarboxylate ligands are often employed as bridging ligands to construct coordination polymers because of their versatile coordination modes,11 and their ability to act as H-bond acceptors and donors. Second, H3L ligand has a planar structure and assembles with d10 metal ions to exhibit intriguing photoluminescent properties. Third, interpenetration control is an important challenge in the synth- esis of new materials; a potential beneﬁt of using the reduced symmetry linkers is that they tend to be a noninterpenetrated structure. Last, but not least, porous materials have achieved considerable attention in the past decade due to the development of microporous coordination polymers (MCPs) as a potentially viable alternative to sorbents.12 The fact that the H3L ligand links metal clusters or metal oxide clusters may generate microporous coordination polymers. To test the ability of the ligand to give new architectures and topologies, we selected H3L ligand and diﬀerent bivalent metal salts, and we solvothermally synthesized two new coordi- nation polymers with intriguing structures and topologies, namely, {[(Zn4O)1/2(Zn3OH)1/2L3/2O1/4(H2O)5/2(NO2)1/2] 3 (H2O)4}n (1) and {[Cd3L2(H2O)4] 3 (H2O)9 3 DMA}n (2). In addition, we chose 4,40-bibp based on its conformationally restraint as coligands to synthesize {[Co(HL)(4,40-bibp)]}n (3). Among the previous reports, linear, rigid, and bifunctional bridging ligands have been found to be one of the most versatile building blocks. All compounds are character- ized by elemental analysis, IR spectra, and X-ray crystallogra- phy. The crystal structures, topological analyses, photo- luminescent properties, and thermal properties are studied in detail. Received: March 23, 2011 Revised: May 8, 2011 ABSTRACT: Three novel metalorganic frameworks, namely, {[(Zn4O)1/2- (Zn3OH)1/2L3/2O1/4(H2O)5/2(NO2)1/2] 3 (H2O)4}n (1), {[Cd3L2(H2O)4] 3 (H2O)9 3 DMA}n (2), and {[Co(HL)(4,40-bibp)]}n (3; H3L = 50-carboxyl- [1,10:30,100-terphenyl]-4,400-dicarboxylic acid, 4,40-bibp = 4,40-bisimidazolylbiphe- nyl, DMA = N,N-dimethylacetamide), have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. These compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, and X-ray single-crystal diﬀraction. Compound 1 reveals an unusual 3D structure with {4 3 52}{4 3 62}{42 3 52 3 68 3 83}{52 3 6}{53 3 65 3 82} topology based on Zn4O and Zn3OH clusters. In compound 2, the H3L ligand assembles with Cd(NO3)2 to a 3D framework with sqc27 {4 3 62}2{42 3 610 3 83} topology. They are both three-dimensional frameworks containing one-dimensional channels. In compound 3, the HL2 anion and 4,40-bibp both act as bidentate ligands and coordinate to Co cations to form a three-dimensional 4-connected uninodal network. In addition, the thermal stabilities for 13 and luminescent properties for 1 and 2 are also discussed in detail. 3116 dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg2003673 |Cryst. Growth Des. 2011, 11, 3115–3121 Crystal Growth & Design ARTICLE ’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials and Measurements. The reagents and solvents em- ployed were commercially available. H3L and 4,40-bibp ligand were prepared by literature methods.13,14 IR absorption spectra of the compounds were recorded in the range 4004000 cm1 on a Nicolet (Impact 410) spectrometer with KBr pellets (5 mg of sample in 500 mg of KBr). C, H, and N analyses were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer.

X-ray Crystallography. Single crystals of 13 were prepared by the methods described in the synthetic procedures. X-ray crystallo- graphic data of 1 and 2 were collected at room temperature by way of sealing the better single crystals in a quartz tube with mother liquor, and X-ray crystallographic data of 3 was collected using epoxy-coated crystals mounted on glass fiber. X-ray crystallographic data of these compounds were collectedon a Bruker ApexSmart CCD diffractometerwith graphite- monochromated Mo KR radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Structure solutions were solved by direct methods, and the non-hydrogen atoms were located from the trial structure and then refined anisotropically with SHELXTL using full-matrix least-squares procedures based on F2 values.15 The hydrogen atom positions were fixed geometrically at Table 1.

The distribution of peaks in the channels of 2 was chemically featureless to refine using conventional discrete-atom models. To resolve these issues, the contribution of the electron density by the remaining water molecule was removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON.16 The numbers of solvent water molecules in 2 were obtained by elemental analyses. The relevant crystallographic data are presented in Table 1, while the selected bond lengths and angles are given in the Supporting Informa- tion (Table S1). A semiempirical absorption correction was applied using SADABS.17 ’RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crystal Structure {[(Zn4O)1/2(Zn3OH)1/2L3/2O1/4(H2O)5/2- (NO2)1/2] 3 (H2O)4}n (1). The crystal structure determination reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system Pnnm. The asymmetric unit contains half a Zn4O cluster, half a Zn3OH cluster, half a nitrate anion,18 one and a half L3 ligands, two and a half coordinated water molecules, four free water molecules, and a quarter of a bridging oxygen atom. The remaining portion in Figure 1a is generated by inversion sym- metry. Compound 1, with both independent Zn3OH and Zn4O clusters, has not been reported until now (Figure 1b),19a although many works reported MOFs with Zn3OH or Zn4O clusters.19 While, through the coordinating competition of water, the Zn4O clusters are different from these reported works,19e the μ4-oxo bridged Zn4O (Zn1, Zn2, Zn2#1, Zn3) cluster is edge- bridged by five carboxylate groups from five L3 ligands and two coordinated water molecules and one O atom from nitrate anion to provide the Zn4O(L)5(H2O)2 unit (Figure 2a), while the μ3-OH bridged Zn3O (Zn4, Zn5, Zn5#1) cluster is edge-bridged by four carboxylate groups from four L3 ligands and four coordinated water molecules and one O atom from nitrate anion to generate the (Zn3OH)(L)4(H2O)4 (Figure 2b). In pre- viously reported work, the coordinated number of Zn is four or five, while, in compound 1, Zn cations have three coordinated numbers: Zn1 and Zn5 are five-coordinate, and the τ trigonality factors are 0.098 and 0.329, indicating that they are in the distorted square pyramidal coordination geometry.20 Zn1 is anchored by two carboxylate bridges, one coordinated water molecule, one bridging O atom, and the central μ4-oxygen atom, while the Zn5 center is bridged by three carboxylates, one coordinated water molecule, and the central μ3-O atom. Zn2 and Zn3 are tetrahedrally coordinated, Zn2 is anchored by three carboxylate bridges and the central μ4-oxygen atom, while the Zn3 center is bridged by two carboxylate ligands, one O atom from nitrate anion, and the central μ4-oxygen. Zn4 is octahedrally anchored by two carboxylate bridges, two coordinated waters, one O atom from nitrate anion, and the central μ3-oxygen, as shown in Figures 1b and 2. The ZnO lengths are in the range 1.832(3)2.4221(8) Å, and they are all similar to those found in other Zn(II) compounds.21 The Zn4O clusters and Zn3OH clusters connect by one nitrate anion, and the two Zn4O clusters connect by O bridging atoms; ﬁnally, they assemble L3 ligands to a 3D structure with 1D channels, running along the c axis (Figure 3a). The channels are occupied by water molecules (Figure 3b). The desolvated framework shows 34.4% void space to the total crystal volume, as calculated by PLATON. To better understand the nature of this intricate framework, a topological approach has been applied; we reduce multidimensional structures to simple nodes and connection nets. (Zn4O)(L)5(H2O)2 and (Zn3OH) (L)4(H2O)4 can be regarded as 7-connected and 5-connected nodes, respectively. All crystallographically independent L3 ligands act as 3-connected linkers. The L3 ligands have three connection modes: one connects three Zn4O clusters, another connects three Zn3OH clusters, and the last connects two Zn4O and one Zn3OH (Figure 3c). Therefore, the whole structure can be represented as a new 3,3,3,5,7-c network topology (with the Schl€aﬂi symbol {4 3 52}{4 3 62} {42 3 52 3 613 3 7 3 83}{52 3 6}{53 3 66 3 7}) (Figure 3d). Crystal Structure {[Cd3L2(H2O)4] 3 (H2O)9 3 DMA}n (2). Single crystal X-ray analysis reveals compound 2 crystallizes in a triclinic crystal system of P1 space group. The asymmetric unit contains three cadmium cations, two L3 ligands, four coordinated waters, and one free DMA molecule and nine lattice water molecules (Figure 4a). In the asymmetric unit, the two L3 ligands take Figure 1. (a) Coordination environment of the Zn(II) ion in 1. The hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.

Growth Des. 2011, 11, 3115–3121 Crystal Growth & Design ARTICLE different coordination modes (modes II and III of Chart 1), and the difference sites in that one carboxylate group take the μ3- chelating-bridging tridentate mode while those in the other L3 ligand adopt the bismonodentate coordination mode to bridge two Cd centers. The other two carboxylate groups both chelate in a bidentate mode and a μ3-chelating-bridging tridentate mode. Cd1 is seven-coordinate, and Cd2 is six-coordinate; they both bond to O atoms, of which one O atom is from a water molecule andthe others areall from the L3 ligand. The bridgingcarboxylate groups of the L3 ligand link the Cd1 and Cd2 centers into an infinite 1D zigzag chain, as shown in Figure 4b, which contains nonbonded Cd 3 3 3 Cd contacts of 3.76 Å. The Cd3 cation in an octahedral coordination sphere bonds with six O atoms, of which four O atoms come from two carboxylates with chelating coordination to the same Cd centers. The other two O atoms are from two water molecules, respectively. In compound 2, the Cd cations also have two coordination numbers: seven and six coordination spheres (Figure 4c). The CdO lengths are in the range 2.135(11)2.587(10) Å, which are all similar to those found in other Cd(II) compounds.22 The 3D framework con- tains three kinds of channels, namely, A, B, and C, along the a axis, with DMA molecules in channel B (Figure 5a). The desolvated framework shows 39.9% void space to the total crystal volume, as calculated by the PLATON. A better insight into the nature of this intricate framework is provided by a topology analysis, reducing multidimensional structures to simple nodes and connection nets. The Cd2(CO2)4 units can be regarded as 6-connected nodes and all crystallographical independent L3 ligands act as 3-connected linkers. Therefore, the whole structure can thus be represented as a 3,3,6-c net sqc network topology, which is noninterpenetrated (with the Schl€afli symbol {4 3 62}2{42 3 610 3 83}) (Figure 5b). Crystal Structure {[Co(HL)(4,40-bibp)]}n (3). Compound 3 crystallizes in monoclinic space group C2/c, asshown in Figure 6a; the asymmetric unit contains one Co(II) ion, one partially deprotonated HL2 ligand, and one 4,40-bibp ligand. The Co(II) ion is coordinated by two carboxylic O atoms from two HL2 ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two 4,40-bibp ligands to form a distorted tetrahedron geometry. The bond lengths of Co1N1 and Co1N3 are 2.010(3) and 2.033(2), respectively, and the Co1O1 distance is 1.9443(2). They are reasonable compared with the values in reported work.23 It is obvious that the 4,40-bibp ligands have two different configurations when coordinated with Co atoms, which is attributed to the rotational flexibility about theaxis ofthe molecule. One isshown in turquoise, in which the biphenyl shows a coplanar mode. The dihedral angle between imidazole and phenyl is 23.829(1). The other in pink is a little twisted, in which the angle between the two phenyl rings is 27.777(1). The dihedral angles between imidazole and phenyl are 36.643(1) and 36.129(1), respectively. The two kinds of 4,40-bibp ligands connect Co atoms to form a 1D chain, alter- nately, resulting in a beautiful ruffling (Figure 6b). Then the HL2 ligands take mode IV (Chart 1) to join all infinite 1D chains into a 3D framework (Figure 6c). With the topological viewpoint, the Co can be viewed as 4-connecting nodes and the ligands as linkers, and the whole structure can be represented as a {42 3 6 3 83} sqc155 net, as displayed in Figure 6d. Effect of the Central Metals and Solvent on the Frame- work. The structures of coordination networks in MOFs have been found to be greatly influenced by the physical and chemical factors. Different metal ionshave a great influence onthestructural construction of MOFs as the ligands employed different Figure 4. (a) Coordination environment of the Cd(II) ions in 2.

Growth Des. 2011, 11, 3115–3121 Crystal Growth & Design ARTICLE coordination modes in different polymers, as shown in Chart 1. The different coordination environments of the central metals are the main reasons for the structural differences in 1 and 2. In 1, the five kinds of Zn(II) ions adopt three kinds of coordinated numbers, and they compose two kinds of clusters. Furthermore, they are linked by the L3 to generate a novel (3,3,3,5,7)- connected net. In 2, the three kinds of Cd(II) ions also display two coordination geometries, that is pentagonal-bipyramidal and distorted octahedral. They are bridged by the L3 to furnish a (3,3,6)-connected and 2-nodal sqc27 net, while, for compound 3, the solvent takes more important roles, since we cannot get the crystal in other similar solvent. Luminescent Properties. During the past few years, the coordination polymers with d10 metal centers have been investi- gated for fluorescence properties with potential applications in photochemistry, chemical sensors, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).24 Therefore, the solid-state photoluminescent spectra of compounds 1 and 2 and free ligands H3L were measured at room temperature, and the resultsare givenin FigureS1. The main emission peaks are observed at 415 nm (λex = 356 nm) for H3L ligand, which can be assigned to the π 3 3 3 π* transitions, 389 nm (λex = 355 nm) for 1, and 450 nm (λex = 350 nm) for 2. Compared to the free H3L ligand, the emission band of 1 is 26 nm blue-shifted and the emission band of 2 is 35 nm red-shifted, respectively. For compound 1, abundant lattice water molecules fill the network, forming important weak forces, which stabilize the framework and enhance the rigid structure.25 However, since the d10 configuration ions are difficultly oxidized or reduced, these bands should be assigned to the intraligand fluorescent emissions. In addition, it is noteworthy that compounds 1 and 2 showed intense emissions compared with that of free H3L at room temperature, which may be attributed to the strength of rigidity in the solid state.26 Furthermore, the emission decay lifetimes of compounds 1 and 2 were monitored and the curves are best fitted by biexponentials in solid.27 The emission decay lifetimes of the compounds 1 and 2 are τ1 = 2.99 μs, τ2 = 17.11 μs (χ2 = 1.296, Figure S3) for compound 1, and τ1 = 3.17 μs, τ2 = 17.08 μs (χ2 = 1.1517, Figure S4) for compound 2. Thermal Analysis and XRD Results. To estimate the stabi- lity of the coordination architectures, their thermal behaviors were studied by TGA (Supporting Information, Figure S2). For compound 1, a gradual weight loss of 7.45% is observed from 40 to 260 C, which is attributed to the loss of the lattice water (calcd 7.75%). The second weight loss of 10.05% (calcd 9.96%) corresponds to the loss of coordinated water mol- ecules and nitrate anion. Then the structure is decomposed starting at 420 C. In compound 2, a rapid weight loss of 6.74% Chart 1. Coordination Modes of Carboxylic Groups in Compounds 13 Figure 5.

The second weight loss of 12.46% (calcd 11.76%) is attributed to the loss of the nine lattice water molecules, which were removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON and were obtained by ele- ment analyses. The third weight loss was attributed to the loss of the four coordinated water molecules with a weight loss of 5.77% (calcd 5.23%); then the network subsequently col- lapsed at 420 C. The TGA study of compound 3 shows no weight loss from room temperature to 400 C, suggesting that the frameworks are thermally stable. Above 400 C, a rapid weight loss is observed which is attributed to the burning of the organic ligands. To confirm whether the crystal structures are truly representative of the bulk materials, PXRD experi- ments were carried out for 13. The PXRD experimental and computer-simulated patterns of the corresponding com- pounds are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S5S7). They show that the bulk synthesized materials and the measured single crystals are the same. To further examine the thermal stability of compounds 1 and 2, variable tempera- ture PXRD patterns were obtained, and the sample was heated at different temperatures under N2 gas flow. These results reveal that the structures remain unchanged until at least 300 C (Figure 7 and Figure S8). ’CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have successfully synthesized and character- ized three new compounds by the self-assembly of H3L, 4,40-bibp ligands, and diﬀerent bivalent metal salts under solvothermal conditions. The investigations not only illustrate that structural diversities of coordination polymers can be achieved by changing the central metals and the sovent but also provide a new example of the H3L ligand for the design of novel frameworks. Zn compound containing both Zn4O and Zn3OH clusters will enrich the ﬁeld of MOFs based on multicarboxylate ligands. Reduced symmetry linker (H3L) oﬀers a largely unknown ap- proach to the synthesis of high-performance coordination poly- mers. And the H3L ligand tends to construct the coordination polymers exhibiting metal oxide clusters and high porosity. Subsequent works will be focused on the structures and proper- ties of a series of coordination compounds constructed by the H3L ligand with more bis(imidazole) ligands and metal ions, to examine the inﬂuence of the ﬂexibility, spacer length, and steric hindrance of the imidazole ligands on the assembly of supramo- lecular entities. ’ASSOCIATED CONTENT b S Supporting Information.
