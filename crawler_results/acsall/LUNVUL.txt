The crystal structures of the 1:1 AgNO3:tz2(CH2) and AgNO2:tz2(CH2) adducts determined by X-ray studies show that tz2(CH2) coordinates to silver through the exodentate nitrogen atoms at the 4-positions of the triazole rings, yielding neutral polymers, while the ionic Ag(OTf):tz2(CH2) (3:4) adduct has a three-dimensional polymeric cation. The NMR and ESI MS data suggest that tz2(CH2) is only weakly coordinating, adducts between Ag(I) and CH3CN being more prevalent in acetonitrile solution. Introduction Following the initial reports on poly(pyrazolyl)borate ligands by Trofimenko, a large number of papers have appeared on the coordination chemistry of azole-containing donors.1 Modifications of polypyrazolylborates can be made by replacement of the boron bridging atom with carbon,2 silicon,3 or phosphorus.4 Other important variations can be effected by changing the substituents on the heterocyclic ring or by replacement of the pyrazolyl with triazolyl,5 imid- azolyl,6 and methimazolyl moieties.7 Poly(triazolyl)borate ligands with their diverse bonding centers give rise to an interesting coordination chemistry and supramolecular architecture possibilities in the solid state with the formation of, e.g., incorporated two-dimensional water layers and linkage isomerism;8 an increasing interest has been devoted to the controlled synthesis of inorganic * Corresponding author.

The coordination chemistry of poly(triazolyl)alkanes is notably underdeveloped, perhaps because of the ready formation of polymeric insoluble species.14 These include some diorgano- tin(IV) complexes which are linkage coordination polymers in which tz2CH2 acts as a bridging instead of chelating ligand,15 some group-6 metal carbonyl complexes in which 3,5-Me2tz2CH2 acts as a chelating bidentate ligand with two endodentate nitrogen atoms,16 and a 1,2-tz2(CH2)2 copper(I) compound in which the ligand coordinates through exo- nitrogen atoms in the azole rings.17 Tang has also reported the formation of heterobimetallic complexes containing diorganotin(IV) dihalides and group-6 metal carbonyls.16 In this paper we describe the synthesis of two- and three- dimensional coordination polymers from tz2CH2 with Ag(I) cations, their spectroscopic properties, and the results of some single-crystal X-ray studies. Experimental Section General Procedures. All reactions were carried out protected from light under an atmosphere of dry oxygen-free dinitrogen, using standard Schlenk techniques. Solvents were used as supplied or distilled by using standard methods. All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee) and used as received. The donor tz2(CH2) was synthesized by the procedure previously reported14 and purified by several recrystallizations from chloroform/hexane. Solvents were dried by standard techniques. The samples were dried in vacuo to constant weight (20 °C, ca. 0.1 Torr). Elemental analyses (C, H, N, S) were performed with a Fisons Instruments 1108 CHNS-O Elemental analyzer. IR spectra were recorded from 4000 to 100 cm-1 with a Perkin-Elmer System 2000 FT-IR instrument. 1H, 19F, and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a VXR-300 Varian spectrometer operating at room temperature (300 MHz for 1H, 282.2 MHz for 19F, and 75 MHz for 13C). H and C chemical shifts are reported in ppm vs SiMe4, F chemical shifts in ppm vs CFCl3. The electrical conductances of the acetone and acetonitrile solutions were measured with a Crison CDTM 522 conductimeter at room temperature. The positive and negative electrospray mass spectra were obtained with a Series 1100 MSI detector HP spectrometer, using a acetonitrile mobile phase. Solutions (3 mg/mL) for electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) were prepared by using reagent grade acetone or acetonitrile. For the ESI-MS data, masses and intensities were compared to those calculated by using the IsoPro isotopic abundance simulator version 2.1;18 peaks containing silver(I) ions are identified as the centers of isotopic clusters.

Complexes 1-6 can be obtained as colorless crystals, 5 with acetonitrile of crystallization, upon slow interdiffusion of solutions of reactants. No adducts were afforded under the same conditions when silver(I) halides were employed as acceptors. In addition no formation of adducts has been observed in more ionizing solvents such as acetone or DMSO. The stoichiometries found are independent of the ligand-to-metal ratio employed. For example, adduct 3 having a ligand-to-metal ratio 1:2 was obtained even when a large excess of tz2(CH2) was used. Some of these complexes were slightly soluble in chlo- rinated solvents but more soluble in oxygenated solvents such as acetone and DMSO. Even in the solid state compounds 5 and 6 were prone to absorb ambient water, while the other compounds were stable and not hygroscopic. Compounds 5 and 6 were also prone to absorb molecules of solvent from CH3CN solution from which they can be recrystallized. Compounds 1-6 exhibit conductivity values typical of electrolytic species according to eq 2. In the IR spectra of all compounds the ring breathing vibrations fall between 1540 and 1510 cm-1. Derivative 1 contains a five-coordinate geometry in the solid state with the counterion NO3- µ2-bridging via a single oxygen atom. The IR data are in accordance with this evidence; in particular the combination band ν1 + ν4 is split (1749 and 1741 cm-1) with ∆) 8 cm-1, typical of strongly asymmetric bridging bidentate or unidentate nitrate.20 The nitrite behavior in 2 is not well identified due to the presence in the solid spectra of several overlapped absorptions in the region 900- 1500 cm-1, but the existence of AgN4 and AgNO4 cores (see below) seems to be supported by the presence of weak to medium absorptions in the range 150-350 cm-1 ascribed to M-O and M-N stretching vibrations.21 The spectroscopic behavior of the perchlorate derivative 4 is typical of an ionic compound containing an outer-sphere group, only two absorptions being found at ca. 1090 and 620 cm-1 due to IR active vibrations ν3 and ν4.22 The ionic CF3SO3- group has lower symmetry (C3V), but the absence of splitting of the band at 1261 cm-1 (ν3) is consistent with that character of OTf in 5.23 In the case of carboxylate derivatives it is generally accepted that it is possible to distinguish between ionic, unidentate, chelating bidentate, or bridging bidentate groups on the basis of the ∆values (where ∆) νa(COO) - νs(COO)). In the spectrum of our tfa derivative 6 the ∆value is 182 cm-1 in accordance with an ionic formulation of this group.24 The chemical shifts of protons and carbons for the ligand in complexes 1-6 were similar to those of free ligands, only slightly shifted downfield compared with free ligands. These data indicate that extensive dissociation of 1-6 as suggested in eq 2 occurs in CD3CN and DMSO-d6, suggesting weaker interactions between the ligands and the silver(I) acceptors in these solvents. The positive electrospray mass spectra of complexes 1-6 (the most relevant data are reported in the Experimental Section) indicate that these derivatives mainly undergo loss of the anionic X- group. The isotopic distribution of these species is in accord with the calculated composition. Aceto- nitrile does show ligating properties itself toward silver(I) ions, and this is manifest in evidence for the formation of ions [Ag(MeCN)]+, [Ag(MeCN)2]+, and [Ag(MeCN)(tz2- (CH2))]+. However, the aggregation behavior seems to be most strongly dependent on the counterion, the NO3, tfa, and OTf groups being the more conspicuous coordinating anions in the vapor phase. Some small peaks present in the spectra of 1, 5, and 6 are due to the formation of bi- and trimetallic species [Ag2(tz2(CH2))2(X)]+ and [Ag3(tz2(CH2))2(X)2]+ re- spectively. In the case of the OTf compound 5, small peaks due to similar tetra- and pentametallic species were detected, as well, these ions containing bridging nitrito groups. The negative electrospray mass spectra are always dominated by the presence of molecular peaks due to X-, [AgCl(X)]-, [Ag(X)2]-, [Ag2(X)3]-, and [Ag3(X)4]-. No peaks containing the tz2CH2 ligand were found. X-Ray Diffraction Studies: Discussion. Low-temperature single-crystal X-ray studies have defined the structures of the free ligand as well as its 1:1 adducts with silver(I) nitrate and nitrite, 1 and 2, and the 3:4 adduct with AgOTf (as an acetonitrile solvate) 5. In the free ligand, two-half molecules, each with a crystallographic 2-axis passing through the central carbon atom (Figure 1) make up the asymmetric unit of the structure, the geometries of the two independent molecules being in good agreement, and showing some enhancement of double bond localization in N(2)-C(3) and N(4)-C(5) (Table 1). The only other bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)- methane structure recorded, devoid of crystallographic sym- metry, is aquadibromodiphenyltin(IV) bis(3,5-dimethyl-1,2,4- triazol-1-yl)methane,15 in which the precision of the ligand geometry is inherently diminished by the rather high heavy atom content. Close intermolecular hydrogen contacts are found between H(15)‚‚‚N(24) (1/2 + x, 1 - y, 1/ 2 + z), H(25)‚‚‚N(14) (1/2 - x, y - 1, 1/2 - z) 2.59(1), 2.62(1), as well as H(23)‚‚‚N(12) (1 - x, 2 - y, zj) 2.53(1) Å; within the complexes with silver(I), the interactions are predomi- nantly by way of the N(4), so that the role of the ligand in (20) Addison, C.

Although not isomorphous, silver(I) nitrite and nitrate adducts 1 and 2 crystallize in cells of very similar dimen- sionality. The roles of the anions in the two structures differ, almost all atoms of the nitrite anions interacting significantly with silver, whereas only one oxygen of the nitrate does so. Both structures, however, may be regarded as one-dimen- sional polymers or two-dimensional derivative thereof. The structure of AgNO3:L (1:1) 1 is shown in Figure 2; one formula unit, devoid of crystallographic symmetry, comprises the asymmetric unit of the structure. The silver atom is essentially linearily coordinated by a pair of N(4) nitrogens from different rings of different ligands (Ag- N(14), N(24) (1/2 + x, 1/2 - y, 1 + z) 2.163(2), 2.164(2) Å; N-Ag-N 165.50(6)°), the succession of bridged com- ponents generated by the glide operation parallel to c. Polymer strands overlaid with juxtaposed silver atoms have the latter weakly bridged by only one of the nitrate oxygen atoms which interacts significantly: Ag-O(1),O(1) (1/ 2 + x, 1/2 - y, z) 2.645(2), 2.802(2) Å, further feeble cross- linking in the third dimension occurring through N(22) (Ag‚‚‚N(22) (3/2 - x, 1/2 + y, 1/2 + z) 2.868(2) Å). Ag‚‚‚Ag (1/2 + x, 1/2 - y, z) is 4.5110(3) Å. The character of the silver(I) nitrite:tz2CH2 (1:1) adduct 2 is quite different, two formula units, again devoid of crystallographic symmetry, comprising the asymmetric unit of the structure. The coordination of Ag(2) again is quasi- linear as in the nitrate, Ag(2)-N(124, 214) longer at 2.217(4), 2.194(4) Å, N-Ag-N concomitantly diminished to 151.0(2)°); perturbation of the coordination occurs through the agency of N(224) (1 - x, 1/2 + y, 2 - z) (2.499(4) Å) Figure 1.

N(114) bridges to Ag(1) (2.315(4) Å) but the remainder of the coordination sphere of the latter is made up of a pair of O,O′- NO2 chelates (Table 2), whereof N(1) bridge to Ag(2) as indicated above, forming a loose two-dimensional array woven about the 21 screw (Figure 3). With a further diminution in anion basicity, it is unsur- prising that the adduct obtained with silver(I) triflate is devoid of metal-anion interactions, with concomitant increase in salt:ligand stoichiometry; both anions and solvent are uncoordinated, occupying lattice sites. One AgOTf:L (3:4). MeCN formula unit, 5, devoid of crystallographic symmetry, comprises the asymmetric unit of the structure, with the (Ag3L4)3+ cationic array polymeric. The silver atom coor- dination environments are diverse; interestingly, the metal atom coordination spheres involve not only N(4) of each ligand ring (on a basis of one Ag per N donor) but also N(2) similarly (N(222, 322) excepted) (Table 3). Further, through the latter, ligands 1 and 4 behave as chelates, toward Ag(1, 3) respectively, with interplanar dihedral angles similar to those of the free ligand, except that their putative symmetry is now m rather than 2. A section of the polymer is shown in Figure 4. Conclusion In summary, we have synthesized a new series of silver(I)-tz2CH2 complexes, quite stable in the solid state, fully characterized by analytical and spectroscopic measure- ments. Solution data are consistent with complete dissociation of the complexes, occurring through breaking of Ag-N bonds. The ligand tz2(CH2) coordinates the silver atom through the nitrogen atoms yielding two- and three- dimensional coordination polymers. The replacement of the pyrazole rings in the familiar poly(pyrazolyl)alkanes by 1,2,4- triazole leads to a ligand which can bridge between metal centers, thereby creating coordination polymers with interest- ing solid-state structures and properties. The nature of the polymer is dependent on the counterions and independent of the ligand-to-metal ratio and reaction conditions employed. Acknowledgment.
