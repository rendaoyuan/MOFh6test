R. China * S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: High stability and permanent porosity are the premise of general applicability for metal−organic framework materials (MOFs). By varying degrees of success on increasing the connectivity of the linear pillar 4,4′-bipyridine (bpy), two isostructural ﬂexible frameworks [M2(obb)2(DMF)2]·2DMF (1, M = Zn or Cu; H2obb = 4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid), DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide) with no gas sorption are structurally modiﬁed into two rigid frameworks [Zn2(obb)2(bpy)]·DMF (2) and [Cu2(obb)2(bpy)0.5(DMF)]·2DMF (3) with notable gas sorption and separation properties. Especially for 3, it exhibits gas selective uptake for the adsorption of CO2 over N2 and CH4 under 273 K and has an interesting physically lock eﬀect in benzene and cyclohexane sorption. The results provide a successful strategy on tuning framework stability of ﬂexible structures via adding rigid pillars. ■INTRODUCTION Porous coordination polymers (PCPs) or metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) with well-deﬁned channels or pores have been receiving intensive research interest because of their aesthetic framework structures and potential applications in gas storage/separation and catalysis.1,2 For a general applicability, MOFs should have high thermal stability to keep permanent porosity after removal of solvent molecules.3,4 However, it is a big weakness for most MOFs with large pores which are much easier to collapse or shrink into nonporous frameworks after guest removal.4a Therefore, how to retain the pores and avoid the structural shrinking may be extremely challenging. Inter- penetration and coordinatively linking interpenetrated frame- works have been demonstrated as the eﬀective chemical approaches for this aim.5 Moreover, several activated treatment methods, such as solvent-exchange, supercritical CO2, and freeze-drying treatment, have been recognized as other eﬀective physical approaches.6 In this contribution, we provide a new idea for tuning MOF stability and porosity via inserting pillars. It is very easy to image that a big room without any pillars would not be stable, and additional pillars should dramatically improve its stability. Although such a simple idea may be known by everybody, to our knowledge, which is rarely used for MOFs to tune their stability and porosity. Here, such an idea is utilized to optimize MOF stability and its adsorption properties. In this work, we report the synthesis, structural characterizations, and sorption properties of four new MOFs based on a V-shaped 4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid) (= H2obb) ligand, namely [M2(obb)2(DMF)2]·2DMF (1, M = Zn o r C u ) ; D M F = N , N - d i m e t h y l f o r m a m i d e ) , [Zn2(obb)2(bpy)]·DMF (2; bpy =4,4′-bipyridine), and [Cu2(obb)2(bpy)0.5(DMF)]·2DMF (3). All four compounds consist of paddle-wheel M2(COO)4 building units linked by the obb ligands, but they exhibit distinct structural topologies because of the attendance of auxiliary bpy ligands. One prominent feature of this work is the structural relationship between an unstable ﬂexible framework of 1 and a much rigid framework of 3. Although there are large potential free spaces in the framework of 1, it tends to shrink after the removal of solvent molecules and shows nonpore for gases. Once the bpy pillars are inserted into this similar framework, the resulting framework 3 is very rigid and good for gas storage and separation. The framework of 3 exhibits gas selective uptake of CO2 over CH4. Moreover, an interesting physically lock eﬀect is observed in benzene and cyclohexane sorption for 3. The results provide a successful strategy on tuning framework stability of ﬂexible structures via inserting rigid pillars. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Procedures.

The diﬀraction data for compounds were collected on an Oxford Xcalibur diﬀractometer equipped with a graphite−monochromatized Mo−Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293(2) K. Crystal data for 1-Zn: C34H29N2O12Zn2, M = 788.33, monoclinic, a = 27.3020(13) Å, b = 15.9448(6) Å, c = 21.0207(12) Å, β = 95.461(4)°, V = 9109.3(8) Å 3, T = 293(2) K, space group C2/c, Z = 8, 13939 reﬂections measured, 2494 independent reﬂections (Rint = 0.0693). The ﬁnal R1 value was 0.1281 (I > 2σ(I)). The ﬁnal wR(F2) value was 0.3489 (I > 2σ(I)). The goodness of ﬁt on F2 was 1.058. The high R1 value is due to the large porous feature of the framework with structurally disordered guest molecules. Crystal data for 2: C41H24N3O11Zn2, M = 865.41, orthorhombic, a = 16.7758(6) Å, b = 11.0644(3) Å, c = 22.4317(8) Å, V = 4163.6(2) Å3, T = 293(2) K, space group Pcca, Z = 4, 7219 reﬂections measured, 3044 independent reﬂections (Rint = 0.0246).

The ﬁnal R1 value was 0.1162 (I > 2σ(I)). The ﬁnal wR(F2) value was 0.3225 (I > 2σ(I)). The goodness of ﬁt on F2 was 1.109. The high R1 value is due to the large porous feature of the framework with structurally disordered guest molecules. The structures were solved by the direct method and reﬁned by the full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL-97 program. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Compound 1-Zn was solvothermally synthesized by heating a solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and H2obb in DMF/EtOH at 80 °C for ﬁve days. Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction reveals that 1- Zn crystallizes in the space group C2/c. There are two crystallographically independent Zn2+ ions and two deproto- nated obb2‑ ligands in each formula unit. Each V-shaped obb ligand connects two pairs of independent Zn2+ ions through two carboxylate ends. Two symmetry-related Zn2+ ions are bridged by four carboxylate groups of four obb ligands to form a common paddle wheel unit. Since each Zn2+ ion has square- pyramidal coordination geometry, its axial position is further coordinated by a solvent DMF molecule (Figure 1a). Because of the V-shaped nature of the obb linkers, they bridge the resulting Zn2(COO)4 units into a complicated three-dimen- sional network with very open channels along the c-axis (Figure 1b). The rhombic window of a channel consists of eight Zn2(COO)4 units and eight obb ligands, which shows a large dimension about 47.8 × 27.3 Å2. Such a framework can be topologically represented as a 4-connected pts net by reducing two kinds of Zn2(COO)4 units as two kinds of nodes and the obb ligands as the linkers (Figure S2).7 Another Zn-obb compound MCF-22 has been reported previously, but MCF-22 possessed a distinct 4-connected lvt topological network.8 3- Fold framework interpenetration is also found for this open structure of 1, but its whole structure still has channels with eﬀective window size 7 × 8 Å2 along the c-axis (Figure 1b). The large free spaces in 1-Zn are occupied by coordinated DMF molecules and structural disordered solvent molecules. The void volumes of 1 with and without coordinating DMF molecules are 35.8% and 53.8%, respectively, as estimated by the PLATON program. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on the as-synthesized sample of 1-Zn indicated a weight loss of 30.85% in the temperature range 20−230 °C, which is consistent with the release of two coordinating DMF molecules and two DMF guest molecules (calc. 31.23%) per formula unit (Figure S3). The TGA of the CH2Cl2-exchanged sample (1a-Zn) prepared by soaking 1-Zn in CH2Cl2 shows that all of the structural disordered guests can be completely exchanged by CH2Cl2. The powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) pattern of desolvated solid (1-Zn-ht), prepared by heating 1a-Zn at 100 °C for 8 h under vacuum, indicates that framework distort or structural transformation may occur, because the peaks are obviously changed as compared to that of the as-synthesized sample of 1- Zn (Figure 2). Notably, the origin open structure of 1-Zn can be restored after 1-Zn-ht is reimmersed in DMF for one day, as evidenced by PXRD patterns. However, further gas sorption measurements reveal that 1-Zn-ht is hard to adsorb any gas, such as N2, H2, and CO2 (Figure S4). The above results may conclude that compound 1-Zn is a ﬂexible framework and tends to shrink without the sustainers. When Cu(NO3)2 was used to replace Zn(NO3)2 for the synthesis, 1-Cu can be obtained, and it is isostructural to 1-Zn. Compared to the as-synthesized sample of 1-Zn, the XRD Figure 1. a) The coordination environment in 1-Zn and b) view of the 3-fold interpenetrating framework in 1-Zn along the c-axis. Inorganic Chemistry Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic300778m | Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX B pattern of 1-Cu indicates it has the same porous framework with 1-Zn (Figure 2e). The TGA of MeOH-exchanged sample (1a-Cu) prepared by soaking 1-Cu in MeOH shows that all of the structural disordered guests and coordinated DMF molecules can be completely exchanged by MeOH (Figure S5). A desolvated solid (1-Cu-ht) was prepared by heating 1a- Cu at 100 °C for 8 h under vacuum. For diﬀerent guest-loading 1-Cu, its PXRD patterns and gas sorption behaviors are similar to that of 1-Zn (Figures 2f-g and S6). The results indicate that the simple replacement of metal centers does not help for the stability of such a ﬂexible porous framework. Thus, our further eﬀort is trying to add the sustainers, such as the rigid 4,4′-bpy ligand, to support the pores. The solvothermal reaction of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, H2obb, and 4,4′- bpy under the similar conditions of 1 was performed, but a new compound 2 with distinct structural feature was obtained. The structure of 2 also consists of similar dinuclear paddle-wheel Zn2(COO)4 units which are linked by both obb ligands and 4,4′-bpy ligands (Figure 3a). However, the V-shaped bridging obb ligands in 2 only connect such Zn2(COO)4 units into a grid-like 44 Zn-obb layer, and the resulting layers are further pillared by the 4,4′-bpy ligands via the axial coordination of each Zn atom, forming a pillared layer structure. 2-Fold interpenetration is presented in the whole framework (Figure 3b). Each single framework can be topologically represented as a uninodal 6-connect rob net by reducing each Zn2(COO)4 unit into a 6-connected node.7 After interpenetration, the whole framework still shows open channels with small triangular apertures (the eﬀective window size of 3.5 × 3.5 Å2), and the void volume calculated by PLATON program is 26.3% of the total crystal volume. Viewed from the TGA curve of 2, the ﬁrst weight loss of 8.18% in the range of 25−230 °C corresponds to the loss of one guest DMF molecule per formula unit (calc. 8.36%). No further weight loss is observed until 350 °C (Figure S9). The guest-free compound (2-ht) underwent a minor structure change after evacuation at 150 °C under dynamic vacuum for 5 h, as conﬁrmed by PXRD analysis (Figure 4). Considering that Cu(II) centers may be more propitious to form paddle-wheel units, the replacement of Zn(II) in 1 with Cu(II) is possible to produce isostructural compound. Thus, a deliberate solvothermal assembly of Cu(NO3)2·6H2O, obb, and 4,4′-bpy generated our aimed product 3. In the structure of 3, there are two independent paddle-wheel Cu2(COO)4 units. One unit is covered by two coordinated DMF molecules and acts as a 4-connected node, while another unit is coordinated by two 4,4′-bpy ligands and acts as a 6-connected node (Figure 5a). The μ4-obb ligands link the Cu2(COO)4 units into a 3-fold Figure 2.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX C interpenetrating open framework which exhibits very similar porous structure with compound 1 along the c axis (Figure 5b). One obvious diﬀerence between 1 and 3 is that some coordinated DMF molecules in big rhombic channels of 1 have been substituted by the bridging 4,4′-bpy ligands in 3 (Figure 6). Topological analysis indicates that one simple framework of 3 features an unusual binodal (4,6)-connected seh topology when the paddle-wheel units are simpliﬁed as 4-connected and 6-connected nodes, respectively (Figure S7).7 Notably, if the 4,4′-bpy linkers are omitted, the simple Cu-obb framework has 4-connected lvt topology which is similar to MCF-22.8 It is clear now that this (4,6)-connected seh net can be derived from a lvt net through inserting additional linkers. Although 3-fold interpenetration is formed to avoid an extremely large void space, 3 still possesses a signiﬁcant solvent accessible space. Actually, disordered DMF guest molecules were found in the irregular rectangular channels. The eﬀective window size of each channel in 3 is 4 × 8 Å2, which is larger than that in 2. Taking into account the guest solvent molecules as well as the coordinated DMF molecules, the solvent-accessible volume in 3 is estimated to be 45.6% of the unit cell volume, among them 35.8% occupied by disordered DMF guest molecules. TGA of 3 reveals 24.17% weight loss from 25 to 260 °C (Figure S11), which corresponds to the loss of all DMF molecules in the framework (calc. 24.31%). The host framework starts to decompose rapidly from 285 °C. The high eliminating temperature of DMF might be related to the cage-like cavity of the structure. For gas adsorption studies, the sample of 3 was completely exchanged by methanol, and the methanol-exchanged sample was further activated by heating at 100 °C for 8 h under vacuum, giving a hollow framework 3-ht. The PXRD pattern of 3-ht is coincident with that of the simulated pattern derived from the X-ray single-crystal raw data, which conﬁrms that integrity of the framework is maintained upon solvent removal (Figure 7). These results reveal that the framework structure of 3 becomes much rigid and stable under the help of additional 4,4′-bpy pillars. To verify the porosity of solid 2-ht and 3-ht, gas sorption isotherms were measured with N2, H2, CO2, and CH4. Solid 3- ht adsorbs N2 to show a reversible type I isotherm, which indicates a permanent microporosity (Figure 8). However, 2-ht does not sorption N2 because of the size-exclusion eﬀect (N2 kinetic diameter: 3.6 Å). Solid 3-ht shows N2 uptake of approximately 228 cm3·g−1 (STP) at 1 bar. The BET and Langmuir surface areas of 3-ht are estimated to be 829 m2·g−1 and 906 m2·g−1, respectively. Pore size distribution based on Horvath−Kawazoe (H−K) model gives a pore diameter of 9.0 Å. The measured pore volume (0.337 cm3·g−1) from the N2 sorption was slightly higher than that (0.316 cm3·g−1) estimated from the single crystal structure, which indicated that the N2 molecules in the pore were compressed to a greater extent than in the liquid nitrogen at 77 K.9 To further explore their potential properties on gas separation under ambient conditions, the adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, and N2 for 2-ht and 3-ht were measured. Under 273 K and 1 bar, 3-ht can hardly adsorb N2 (2.9 cm3·g−1) (Figure 9f), but the capacity of CO2 for 3-ht are 65.9 cm3·g−1 at 273 K and 36 cm3·g−1 at 298 K and that of 2-ht are 24 and 17 cm3·g−1, respectively (Figure 9a-c, 9e). The enthalpy of CO2 adsorption for 2-ht and 3-ht were estimated from the sorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K using the virial equation to understand the strong aﬃnity toward CO2. At zero coverage, the enthalpy of CO2 adsorption is 26.5 kJ/mol for 2-ht and 21.3 kJ/mol for 3-ht. The higher enthalpy of CO2 adsorption for 2-ht can be attributed to its narrow pores. The initial slopes of the CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms were calculated, and the ratios of these slopes were used to estimate the adsorption selectivity for CO2 over N2 (Figure S19).10 From these data, the calculated CO2/N2 selectivity is 30:1 at 273 K. In addition, the capacity of 3-ht to adsorb CH4 is 19.2 cm3·g−1 (1.4 wt %) and much less than that of CO2 (65.9 cm3·g−1, 12.9 wt %) Figure 6.

PXRD patterns: simulated from the single-crystal data of 3 (a), as-synthesized 3 (b), MeOH-exchanged 3a (c), and desolvated 3- ht (d) obtained by heating 3a at 100 °C for 12 h under vacuum. Figure 8.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX D under the same conditions (Figure 9d), but at 72 bar, the uptake of CH4 can reach 125.4 cm3·g−1 (9.0 wt %, Figure S20). Both H2 sorption isotherms at 77 and 87 K of 3-ht show type I behavior (Figure 10). Note that the adsorption and desorption isotherm curves overlap with each other with no hysteresis and no noticeable change in the properties upon repeated cycling. At 77 K and 1 bar, solid 3-ht adsorbs H2 up to 150.4 cm3·g−1 (1.34 wt %). Under the same conditions, the fraction of the pore volume ﬁlled by liquid H2 (ρH2 = 0.0708 g/ cm3) at 1 atm and 77 K for 3-ht is 55.7%, notably higher than the corresponding values for MOF-5 (13.7%), IRMOF-2 (19.2%), IRMOF-6 (18.3%), IRMOF-11 (31.4%), IRMOF-13 (33.5%), and IRMOF-20 (12.5%) but lower than that of IRMOF-74 (64.1%).11 Moreover, the H2 adsorption enthalpy (Qst) calculated by the virial equation from the adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 87 K is 7.0 kJ·mol−1. Because the H2 sorption isotherm of 3-ht is not fully saturated at 1 bar, a higher H2 sorption capacity may be expected under higher pressures. The sorption isotherms of benzene and cyclohexane vapor for 3-ht also were measured at room temperature (Figure 11). The amount of benzene adsorbed by 3-ht is 20.6 wt %, a value surpassing that of cyclohexane (14.9 wt %). Remarkable, large hysteresis loops without complete desorption were observed in the both sorption isotherms of benzene and cyclohexane. It is possible to physically lock (imprison or encapsulate) guest molecules in a cage-like container with a diameter of approximate 0.9 nm, inducing strong sorbate−sorbent inter- actions to incomplete desorption.12 ■CONCLUSION By varying degrees of success on increasing the connectivity of the bridging bpy ligands, three new M(II)-4,4′-oxybisbenzoic frameworks with distinct framework topologies and comparable thermal stability are successfully synthesized. It is interesting the ﬂexible framework of 1-Zn and 1-Cu can hardly adsorb any gas, but the rigid framework of 3 exhibits gas selective uptake of CO2 over N2 and CH4. For 3, it has CO2 uptake of 65.9 cm3·g−1 under 273 K and 1 bar but only 2.9 cm3·g−1 for N2 and 19.2 cm3·g−1 for CH4. An interesting physically lock eﬀect is also observed in benzene and cyclohexane sorption for 3. The results reveal a successful example of tuning MOF stability and porosity via adding rigid pillars into ﬂexible frameworks. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Additional ﬁgures, TGA, gas sorption isotherms, isosteric heat isotherms, and CIF ﬁles.
