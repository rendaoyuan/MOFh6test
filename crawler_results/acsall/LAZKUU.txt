In this work, we designed a n d s y n t h e s i z e d a n o v e l l i g a n d b i s ( 4 , 4 ′ - dipyridylaminophenylene)butadiyne (L) by attaching two 4,4′- dipyridylamine moieties to a ﬂexible butadiyne linker. Starting from this novel ligand, seven coordination polymers [Zn2L- (HCOO)3(OH)]n (1), [Cd2L2Cl4]n·3nDMF·3nH2O (2), [CdLBr2]n (3), [Cd6L3(SO4)6]n·4nMeCN (4), [Hg2LBr4]n·3nCH2Cl2·nH2O (5), [Cu2LI2]n·0.5nCH2Cl2 (6), and [Ag2L(H2O)2]n(NO3)2n·2nH2O (7) were synthesized. Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analyses revealed that two forms of the ligand crystals, L and L·0.5DMF present straight and bent conformations, respectively, because of the ﬂexibility of the butadiyne unit. A rich structural diversity was observed for its d10 metal complexes. Complexes 1 and 5 present ladder-like structures. In complexes 2 and 4, the ligand molecules are linked by metal atoms to aﬀord 3D supramolecular structures. It is noteworthy that the 3D structure of complex 4 consists of interesting inﬁnite {Cd6(SO4)6}∞chains, whereas complexes 3, 6, and 7 exhibit 2D network structures. Interestingly, in the crystal of complex 7, each ligand links four metal ions and each Ag ion bridges two ligands, leading to the formation of undulated 2D sheets with large cavities composed of 66-membered metallomacrocycles, which are interpenetrated by three other such 2D sheets, aﬀording a 4-fold interpenetrated structure. In summary, the complex structures are dependent on the metal ions and the anions. In addition, the ﬂexibility of the butadiyne moiety provides additional means for modulating the structures. Solid state photoluminescence of the free ligand and the complexes shows emission maxima within the range of 420−515 nm, which can be modulated by the conformations of the ligand in addition to the variation of the metal ions and anions, and the introduction of the butadiyne unit has a bathochromic eﬀect. ■INTRODUCTION The design and construction of coordination polymers containing metal ions and organic ligands have attracted much attention not only because of their intriguing variety of structures, but also for their potential applications in many ﬁelds.1,2 It is well-known that inorganic−organic hybrid coordination polymers, especially those with d10 metal centers, exhibit photoluminescence and have potential applications as ﬂuorescence-emitting materials, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs).3 Hence, the design and synthesis of coordination polymers containing d10 metal centers have received remarkable attention. One of the current interesting topics in this area is to rationally design organic ligands with eﬃcient coordination groups and suitable conjugated systems. In this respect, both bridging and chelating pyridyl ligands have been intensely investigated due to the strong coordination ability and structural diversity. Thus, 2,2′-dipyridylamine (2,2′-dpa),4 4,4′- dipyridyl-amine (4,4′-dpa),5 and their derivatives6 have been proved to be eﬃcient building blocks in the construction of coordination polymers with one-, two-, or three-dimensional structures. During the past few years, our group has utilized 2,2′-dpa and 4,4′-dpa-derived ligands, including N,N-bis(2-pyridyl)-N′,N′- bis(4-pyridyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine (L1, Scheme 1) and N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine (L2, Scheme 1), as building blocks in the construction of coordination polymers with tunable luminescent properties.7 It can be expected that the design and utilization of similar tetrapyridyl ligands with various sizes of extended aromatic systems and various HOMO−LUMO gaps is a practical Received: December 15, 2011 Revised: April 26, 2012 Published: May 23, 2012 Article pubs.acs.org/crystal © 2012 American Chemical Society 3465 dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg201655n | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 3465−3473 approach to further tuning the ﬂuorescence wavelength and intensity of the coordination compounds. Thus, a novel butadiyne-containing tetrapyridyl ligand, bis(4,4′-dipyridyl- aminophenylene)butadiyne (L, Scheme 1) was designed. Compared with L2, it oﬀers some intriguing characteristics. First, the conjugated system is extended by the butadiyne moiety, which may be eﬃcient to tune the ﬂuorescence wavelength. Second, the ligand has better ﬂexibility due to the bending and rotation of the butadiyne unit.8 Thus, the conformational freedom may be better to satisfy the geometric needs of various metal ions in the construction of novel coordination polymers with diversiﬁed and intriguing archi- tectures and topologies. On the basis of these considerations, in this work, we synthesized the novel ligand L, and utilized it for coordination with Zn(II), Cd(II), Hg(II), Cu(I), and Ag(I) to aﬀord coordination polymers, [Zn2L(HCOO)3(OH)]n (1), [Cd 2L 2Cl4] n·3nDMF·3nH2O (2), [CdLBr2]n (3), [Cd6L3(SO4)6]n·4nMeCN (4), [Hg2LBr4]n·3nCH2Cl2·nH2O (5), [Cu2LI2]n·0.5nCH2Cl2 (6), and [Ag2L(H2O)2]n (NO3)2n·2nH2O (7). These complexes exhibit a rich structural diversity, including ladder-like structures, 2D networks containing (Cu2I2) units, 3D structures consisting of inﬁnite {Cd6(SO4)6}∞chains, and a 4-fold interpenetrated 2D structure. In addition, it is note- worthy that two diﬀerent crystals of the ligand, namely, L and L·0.5 DMF were obtained from MeOH and DMF, respectively, and they contain the butadiyne moieties in the straight and bent conformations, respectively. Both conformations are also observed in the complexes. The solid state emission maxima of these compounds lie in the range between 420 and 515 nm, and the emission behavior can be well tuned. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials.

The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned with full-matrix least-squares technique. Anisotropic thermal param- eters were applied to all non hydrogen atoms. All of the hydrogen atoms in these structures are located from the diﬀerential electron density map and constrained to the ideal positions in the reﬁnement procedure. All calculations were performed using SHELX-97 software package.9 Crystal data and experimental details for the crystals are summarized in Table 1 and S1, and selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in Table 2 and S2. DFT Calculations. The calculations were carried out by using the Gaussian03 program package.10 The geometries of L2 and L were optimized by density functional calculations employing the hybrid B3LYP function.11 The 6-31G* basis set12 was adopted to describe all atoms. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energies are listed in Table S3. Molecular structures and molecular orbitals were visualized by the Gabedit software.13 ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization. The ligand L was prepared from a one-pot synthesis comprising of a Sonogashira coupling reaction of (4-bromophenyl)-bis(4-pyridyl)amine with trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA) in DMF followed by an oxidative dimerization, using tetrakis(triphenyl-phosphine)- palladium, cuprous iodide, and diisopropylamine as catalysts and the base, respectively. When the reaction was performed at 80 °C, no reaction could be detected by TLC, so we tried to increase the reaction temperature. Thus the reaction was performed at 130 °C for 4 days to aﬀord L. At ﬁrst, in the reaction, the single-ethyne product was formed, then the alkynyl group is successively transferred from silicon to copper to generate alkynylcopper species, which then oxidatively dimerize to furnish the diacetylene compound L.14 It is noteworthy that two forms of ligand crystals were obtained by two diﬀerent methods: the form of L was obtained by slow evaporation of the MeOH solution at room temperature, and the form of L·0.5DMF was obtained by heating the ligand in a mixed solvent of DMF and H2O followed by cooling to room temperature. Single crystals of complexes 1−4 were obtained by solvothermal reactions of the corresponding metal salts with the ligand L and the crystals of complexes 5−7 were obtained by slow interlayer diﬀusion between the solutions of the ligand and corresponding metal salts. Thus, the two diﬀerent ligand Table 1.

Crystal Structures of L and L·0.5DMF. The molecule of ligand L in the crystal obtained from MeOH is centrosym- metric (Figure 1a). The butadiyne unit and the phenylene moieties are coplanar, and the dpa moieties are deviated from a planar structure due to steric hindrance. The dihedral angle between the neighboring pyridyl rings is 54.1(1)°, and the angles between the phenylene and the pyridyl rings are 70.0(8) and 70.3(5)°, respectively. The butadiyne unit of L adopts an approximately straight line conformation. In the crystal of L·0.5 DMF, the butadiyne unit and the two phenylene moieties are nonplanar (Figure 1b), which is in sharp contrast to the planar structure observed in the crystal of L obtained from MeOH. The two phenylene rings are approximately vertical, with the dihedral angle of 90.4(1)°. Table 2.

Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg201655n | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 3465−3473 3468 And the butadiyne unit adopt a bent conformation. The bending can be described by the angle δ between the single bonds attached to the butadiyne unit (Figure 1c). Thus, for a straight conformation, the δ value is 180°, and for bent conformations, δ will be smaller than 180°. The δ value in the crystal of L·0.5 DMF was found to be 155.4(3)°, indicating a severe distortion of the butadiyne unit, which may result in a decrease in the π conjugation system and a blue shift of the emission peaks (vide infra). Interestingly, hydrogen bonds are observed between the pyridyl N atoms of the 4,4′-dpa moieties and the phenylene H atoms of neighboring ligand molecules, with the H···N distances of 2.51 Å, and the C−H···N angles of 153°. In addition, slipped parallel π···π stacking interactions between the pyridyl rings are observed, with the interplane angles of 23.2(4)°, and the centroid···centroid distances of 4.58 Å. These values lie above the optimal distance for π···π stacking.15 Thus, the two ligand molecules are linked to aﬀord a dimeric structure. It is noteworthy that the dimer is also involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonds with two DMF molecules, with the H···O distances of 2.40 Å and the C−H···O angles of 166°, thus a [L (DMF)]2 dimer is formed. Hence, the wide occurrence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and π···π interactions may account for the severe distortion of the butadiyne unit. The presence of diﬀerent conformations of L may provide an eﬃcient approach for the construction of diversiﬁed and intriguing coordination architectures and topologies, which is demonstrated by the following crystal structures. Crystal Structure of [Zn2L(HCOO)3(OH)]n (1). The crystal data quality for complex 1 is relatively poor with an R1 value of 0.1198, which cannot be signiﬁcantly lowered even after repeated crystal growth and X-ray diﬀraction measurements. It shows a rough ladder-like structure (Supporting Information Figure S3). Related data are summarized in Supporting Information Table S1 and S2. Crystal Structure of [Cd2L2Cl4]n·3nDMF·3nH2O (2). Crystal structure of compound 2 is shown in Figure 2. L utilizes all its pyridyl nitrogens to coordinate with four Cd(II) atoms. Each Cd(II) has a distorted octahedral coordination geometry, with four pyridyl nitrogens coordinated in the equatorial plane and two chlorides coordinated at the axial positions, which is diﬀerent from the tetrahedral coordination geometry of Zn(II) observed in complex 1. The L ligands adopt embowed conformations with the δ value of 168.3(1)°, and the Cd−N and Cd−Cl bond lengths lie in the ranges of 2.364(7)− 2.400(8) Å, and 2.600(3)−2.630(3) Å, respectively. These values lie within the normal range for Cd−N and Cd−Cl lengths in similar complexes.7,16 Each Cd(II) links four ligands and each ligand links four Cd(II), which can be simpliﬁed as four−connected nodes, thus, aﬀording a well-known uninodal cds net, which is interpenetrated by another such cds net, aﬀording a 2-fold interpenetrated structure. Alternatively, the central N atoms of dpa units and the Cd(II) ions can be considered as 3- and 4-connected nodes, respectively, thus, the structure of 2 is a three-dimensional 2-fold interpenetrated network with the Schläﬂi symbol of {83}2{85;10}, which was obtained by TOPOS417(Figure 2c). Crystal Structure of [CdLBr2]n (3). In the crystal structure of complex 3 (Figure 3), the coordination environment of each Cd(II) is octahedral, which is similar to that observed in complex 2, except the coordination of bromine in place of chlorine atoms. Cd−N distances are 2.382(8) and 2.400(8) Å, similar to those observed in complex 2. Cd−Br distance is 2.7470(14) Å, which is within the typical Cd−Br bond length range as previously reported.18 The ligand L adopts an approximately straight conformation, and the ligand molecules are linked by Cd atoms to form 46- and 20-membered metallomacrocycles, with the closest Cd···Cd distances of 22.98 and 10.32 Å, respectively. These metallomacrocycles are interconnected to aﬀord a 2-D network. The structural diﬀerence between 2 and 3 may be caused by the diﬀerence in the anions, and it may also be ascribed to the diﬀerence in the conformations of the ligands. Both Cd(II) atoms and ligands are four−connected. Thus, the topology of 3 can be described as a uninodal 44-sql net. Alternatively, the central N atoms of dpa units can be considered as three-connected nodes and Cd(II) can be treated as four-connected nodes. On the basis of this simpliﬁcation, the topology of 3 is a (3,4)- connected two-dimensional network with the Schläﬂi symbol of {4; 62}2{42; 62; 82} (Supporting Information Figure S4). Figure 1.

Growth Des. 2012, 12, 3465−3473 3469 Crystal Structure of [Cd6L3(SO4)6]n·4nMeCN (4). Com- plex 4 was obtained from the reaction of L and CdSO4 in CH3CN and DMF. It has an interesting Cd6(SO4)6 core structure (Figure 4a) which consists of three diﬀerent types of crystallographically independent Cd(II) atoms. Cd1, Cd2, and Cd3 atoms have similar distorted octahedral coordination geometries. Cd1 coordinates with two pyridyl nitrogens from two L ligands and four O atoms from four sulfate anions, Cd2 is ligated by ﬁve O atoms from four diﬀerent sulfate anions and one pyridyl nitrogen from L, and Cd3 is coordinated by two pyridyl nitrogens from two L ligands, two O atoms from two sulfate anions and two O atoms from one chelating sulfate anion. The Cd−N distances for the pyridyl groups and the Cd−O distances for sulfate anions lie in the ranges of 2.282(6)−2.345(5) Å and 2.185(5)−2.590(5)Å, respectively. One of the interesting structural aspects of this compound is the rich coordination modes of the sulfates, including two tridentate sulfates (S1 and S3) and one tetradentate sulfate (S2), which binds four Cd atoms within one Cd6 unit. The average S−O distance of 1.434 Å for the noncoordinated oxygens are shorter than that of 1.471 Å for the coordinated oxygens, which is consistent with previous observations.19 The tridentate sulfate of S3 bridges two neighboring Cd6(SO4)6 cores, thus aﬀording inﬁnite {Cd6(SO4)6}∞chains, which are further bridged by the L ligands to form a 3D coordination framework (Figure 4b). To the best of our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst example of a complex incorporating hexanuclear Cd6(SO4)6 clusters as building blocks to form a 3D network structure. Topologically, the ligands can be treated as 3- and 4- connectors, and the complex structure can be simpliﬁed by TOPOS417 using cluster representation, resulting in a new 8,9,12 -connected topological net with the Schläﬂi symbol of {310;414;54}{314;414;58}{315;424;526;6}. Crystal Structure of [Hg2LBr4]n·3nCH2Cl2·nH2O (5). The asymmetric unit of crystal 5 (Figure 5) consists of two crystallographically independent Hg(II) atoms and each Hg(II) atom locates in a distorted tetrahedral coordination environ- ment, provided by two bromides and two pyridyl nitrogen atoms. The ligands show embowed conformations with the δ value of 168.0(1)°. Hg2−N distances are 2.340(15) and 2.350(13) Å, which are signiﬁcantly shorter than those of 2.386(13) and 2.416(14) Å for Hg1−N distances, which may also be caused by the presence of the embowed conformation. Thus, two diﬀerent 46-membered metallomacrocycles are formed with the distances of 22.78 Å and 21.59 Å for Hg1···Hg1a and Hg2···Hg2b, respectively. Finally, these metallomacrocycles are linked to aﬀord a ladder-like structure approximately along the c axis. Crystal structure of [Cu2LI2]n·0.5nCH2Cl2 (6). The structure of complex 6 is shown in Figure 6. The coordination sphere around each Cu(I) center is composed of two pyridyl N atoms and two iodine anions, with Cu−N bond lengths of 2.040(7) and 2.066(7) Å, and Cu−I bond lengths of 2.714(2) and 2.627(2) Å. These bond lengths are comparable to those observed in similar complexes.20 Two neighboring Cu(I) atoms are bridged by two iodides with the Cu(I)−I−Cu(I) bridging angles of 120.61(5)°, thus aﬀording Cu2I2 units, which are further linked by the tetrapyridyl L ligands to form a 2D coordination network composed of 46- and 24-membered metallomacrocycles. Cu2I2 units can be simpliﬁed as four-connected cluster nodes, thus the topology of 6 is a uninodal 44-sql net, which is similar to that of complex 3. Crystal Structure of [Ag2L(H2O)2]n(NO3)2n·2nH2O (7). The crystallographic asymmetric unit of complex 7 (Figure 7) comprises a [Ag2L]2+ cation, two weakly coordinated water Figure 4.

Growth Des. 2012, 12, 3465−3473 3470 molecules and two noncoordinated nitrate anions. Each Ag(I) atom is coordinated to two N atoms from two L ligands with the Ag−N bond lengths of 2.156(6) and 2.139(7) Å, and N− Ag−N bond angle of 159.3(3)°. Distortion of the N−Ag−N moiety from an ideal line is related to the weak coordination of a water molecule with the Ag−O bond length of 2.684(1) Å. The ﬁnal coordination geometry around Ag(I) is approximately T-shaped with O−Ag−N angles of 103.4(4) and 96.7(4)°. Thus, each L ligand links four Ag(I) ions and each Ag(I) ion links two L ligands, resulting in the formation of undulated with large cavities composed of 66-membered metallomacrocycles. Topologically, the central N atoms of dpa units can be considered as three-connected nodes and the 2D sheet can be described as a typical 63-hcb net, which is interpenetrated by three other such 63-hcb nets, aﬀording a 4-fold interpenetrated structure. Photoluminescence. Coordination polymers with d10 metal centers and conjugated organic linkers have potential applications in various areas such as luminescent materials and chemical sensors.21 Hence, the solid state photoluminescence properties of complexes 1−7, together with the crystalline samples of the free ligand L and L·0.5DMF were investigated at room temperature (Figure 8). The free ligand L exhibits a medium-intensity emission centered at 457 nm upon excitation at 330 nm, which may be attributed to the π* →π transition.22 In contrast, the main peak for L·0.5DMF is blue-shifted to a λmax of 420 nm, which may result from a decrease in the π conjugation system caused by the bent conformation observed its crystal structure (vide supra). For complex 1, intense emission band is observed at 444 nm, upon excitation at 310 nm, which is blue-shifted as compared to that of L. Considering the bent conformation of the ligand in this complex, it is more reasonable to compare it with L·0.5 DMF, which has a similar bent conformation. Thus, the emission at 444 nm is red-shifted compared to that of 420 nm for L·0.5 DMF. This result is consistent with previous observations.7a Complexes 2 and 3 in the solid state have very broad emission bands with λmax values of 496 and 515 nm, respectively, which are red-shifted, as compared with the corresponding values of the ligand crystals. Because the Cd(II) ions are diﬃcult to oxidize or to reduce, the emissions of 2 and 3 are neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) in nature.23 As a result, the emissions may be tentatively attributed to the intraligand transitions.24 It is clear that a further red shift of the emission occurs for 3, compared with complex 2, which is probably due to the diﬀerences of anions and coordination environment around the central metal ions, because photo- luminescent behavior is closely associated with the local environments around metal ions.25 Furthermore, the bent conformation of the ligands observed in complex 2 may also cause a blue shift of the emission band due to the decrease of the π conjugation system. Therefore, the emission at a longer wavelength is observed for 3, as compared to that of 2. The emissions of complexes 2 and 3 are signiﬁcantly weaker than that of L, which may be ascribed to the heavy-atom eﬀect.26 Obviously, the emission bands of 4 centered 442 nm also can be attributed to the intraligand transitions because of its similarity with that of L.24c,27 It is noteworthy that the intensity for 4 is stronger than that of the ligand, which may be related to the suppression of nonemissive energy-loss mechanism, probably induced by the better rigidity imparted by the tethering of the {Cd6(SO4)6}∞ chain motifs. Complex 5 in the solid state exhibits a slightly blue-shifted emission band (λmax = 437 nm) with respect to the free L ligand. This observation is similar to that for complex 1, and it also may be related to the bent conformation of the ligands, similar to that observed in complex 1. In contrast to these compounds, no clear luminescence was detected for 6 and 7, which may be related to the heavy atom eﬀect. Compared to our previously reported ligand L2 (Scheme 1) and its corresponding complexes, the emission peaks of L and its complexes 2, 3, 5 exhibit red shifts of 46, 61, 44, and 23 nm, respectively. This observation is consistent with our expectation of increasing the emission wavelength by extending the π conjugation system through the introduction of a butadiyne unit, and it is consistent with the calculated values of HOMO− LUMO energy gaps of 4.44 and 3.45 ev for L2 and L, respectively (Supporting Information Table S3 and Figure S5). ■CONCLUSIONS One novel tetrapyridyl ligand bis(4,4′-dipyridylamino- phenylene)butadiyne (L) containing a butadiyne unit was prepared and used to coordinate with d10 metals, including Zn(II), Cd(II), Hg(II), Cu(I) and Ag(I) to aﬀord a rich variety of complexes. The crystals of 1 and 5 exhibit ladder-like structures with the embowed-conformation ligands. 2 exhibits a 2-fold interpenetrated 3D network, and 4 exhibits a 3D coordination network consisting of inﬁnite {Cd6 (SO4)6}∞ chains. Complexes 3, 6, and 7 exhibit 2D structures, in which 3 consists of 46- and 20-membered metallomacrocycles, 6 is composed of 46- and 24-membered metallomacrocycles, and 7 exhibit 4-fold interpenetrated 2D sheets with the cavities composed of 66-membered metallomacrocycles. The photo- luminescence measurements illustrated that L, L·0.5DMF and complexes 1−7 exhibited emissions with the maxima wave- lengths varying in a large range of 420−515 nm. The variation in emission intensities and wavelengths can be rationalized in terms of the metal centers, the anions, the extended aromatic systems and the ﬂexible butadiyne units. The conformational ﬂexibility of the butadiyne moiety was observed, which provides additional means for modulating the structures and luminescent properties. Furthermore, it can be expected that design and utilization of similar tetrapyridyl ligands with the butadiyne unit connected to the pyridine rings in stead of the N atom is a practical approach of further extending the aromatic systems to further tune the ﬂuorescence wavelength and intensity, which is underway in our lab.
