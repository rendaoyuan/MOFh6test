Ureas are well-known for self-recognition and aggrega- tion behavior, resulting in loss of catalytic competency. The catalyst spatial isolation achievable in a porous MOF environment suggests a potentially general solution. The combination of a symmetrical urea tetracarboxylate strut, 4,4′-bipyridine, and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O under solvothermal conditions afforded a new microporous MOF (NU-601). This material is indeed an effective hydrogen-bond-donor catalyst for Friedel−Crafts reactions between pyrroles and nitroalkenes, whereas a homogeneous urea is much less competent. The higher rates of reaction of small substrates relative to larger ones with NU-601 strongly suggest that catalysis primarily occurs within the pores of this new material rather than on its exterior. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first example of specific engineering of successful hydrogen-bonding catalysis into a MOF material. C oordination polymers, including metal−organic frame- works (MOFs), have recently emerged as promising new materials1 for gas storage,2 gas separation,3 sensing,4,3b drug delivery,5 light harvesting,6 and heterogeneous catalysis.7 MOFs’ tunable nature, permanent microporosity, and defined reaction environments make them ideal candidates for new directions in catalyst design and application. On the basis of our collective interests in MOFs and catalysis, we have developed a collaborative program aimed at merging metal-free (organo- catalytic) and heterogeneous catalysts.8 Recently, we hypothe- sized that incorporating homogeneous catalysts that are prone to self-quenching into MOFs might lead to a new class of materials with significant potential. “Self-quenching” here is defined as unproductive self-assembly behavior due to catalyst−catalyst interactions (e.g., dimerization, oligomerization, etc.). This phenomenon is present in certain homogeneous systems, leading to a potential decrease in catalyst reactivity. By rendering the possibility of self-quenching unlikely, if not impossible, through spatial control of reactive catalysts centers engendered by MOF materials, new heterogeneous catalysts could potentially show increased and/or different reactivity in comparison with similar homogeneous catalysts. Such materials could also exhibit size selectivity in addition to being robust and reusable catalysts relative to their homogeneous counterparts. Hydrogen-bond-donating (HBD) catalysis has emerged as a biomimetic alternative to Lewis acid activation.9 These reac- tions usually employ a urea or thiourea as the key functional group capable of two-point hydrogen bonding through acidic N−H bonds. Numerous bond-forming reactions (e.g., Strecker reactions,10 Diels−Alder reactions,11 Claisen rearrangements,12 Mannich reactions,13 Friedel−Crafts reactions,14 conjugate additions,15 etc.) can be catalyzed by homogeneous HBD cat- alysts, often in excellent yield and selectivity. However, the competency of H-bond donors present in HBD catalysts such as ureas can be significantly attenuated as a result of dimeriza- tion and oligomerization through hydrogen bonding of catalyst molecules to each other.16 HBD catalysts are prime examples of catalysts that undergo self-quenching, and these unproductive interactions greatly decrease the catalyst solubility and reactivity (Figure 1 top). Consequently, new directions and opportunities might be realized if these catalysts were to be incorporated into coordination polymers, which possess defined reaction environ- ments and high porosity. The combination of a polytopic urea “strut”, a pillaring strut, and an appropriate metal ion could produce materials that avoid the possibility of self-quenching Received: November 16, 2011 Published: January 31, 2012 Figure 1.

Soc. 2012, 134, 3334−3337 while possessing spatially distinct hydrogen-bonding sites (eq 1 in Figure 1). Herein we report the synthesis and initial applica- tion of a new urea-containing MOF designed for heterogeneous HBD catalysis following the principles described above.17 We based our design of H-bond MOF strut 1 on a sym- metrical thiourea developed by Schreiner and co-workers (Figure 2).11 Thermal stability issues that we encountered with thioureas under standard MOF solvothermal conditions led us to instead use the corresponding ureas, given their strong pro- pensity to act as hydrogen-bond donors.12 The CF3 groups present in these urea/thiourea catalysts were replaced with car- boxylic acids, which serve a secondary and critical design criterion, as they are metal-binding groups. Strut 1 was produced efficiently from 5-nitroisophthalic acid in four steps with an overall yield of 50% [see the Supporting Information (SI)], allowing easy access to multigram quantities of this material. With the strut in hand, we set out to make a material with pores large enough to ac- commodate substrates for HBD-catalyzed reactions. We initially sought to synthesize MOFs containing 2D sheets of ureas connected by zinc paddlewheel secondary building units and pillared with 4,4′-bipyridine (BIPY) (Scheme 1). After 2 days of heating under solvothermal conditions, we ob- served light-yellow needle-shaped crystals having the formula Zn2(BIPY)2(1-4H), which we have designated NU-601. These crystals were subjected to single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) to elucidate their structure. XRD revealed that NU-601 does in fact contain 2D sheets of strut 1 pillared with BIPY. This material contains Zn2 nodes similar to those in a material reported by Li and co-workers.18 NU-601 exists in the P21/c space group. It possesses large channels in all directions (a axis, 12.05 Å × 13.95 Å; b axis, 11.38 Å × 13.69 Å; c axis, 11.38 Å × 4.87 Å; distances measured between atom centers) with N−H urea bonds projecting into the pores (Figure 3). As anticipated, the oxygen atoms of the remaining N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) molecules are tightly hydrogen-bonded to the urea N−H bonds in the solid- state structure. Powder XRD (PXRD) data from bulk samples of NU-601 matched the simulated PXRD pattern (generated from the CIF file; see the SI). To open the N−H urea sites and render NU-601 catalytically active, it was necessary to remove the residual hydrogen-bonded DMF. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of NU-601 revealed ∼30% weight loss after heating to 125 °C (see the SI). Another weight loss event was observed beginning at ∼200 °C, which we attribute to the loss of hydrogen-bonded DMF. However, the PXRD pattern of this heated material indicated a loss of crystallinity, and additional standard thermal strategies proved unsuccessful in removing all of the DMF. The crucial activation was accomplished by exchanging the DMF with MeNO2 over a period of 4 days. The MOF was then digested in D2SO4, and 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis confirmed that DMF had been >95% replaced with MeNO2. 1H NMR spectroscopy (500 MHz) also allowed us to determine the percentage by weight of strut 1 in NU-601 [∼36% (w/w) 1; see the SI], which was necessary to calculate the catalyst loading. Solvent exchange (vs thermal activation) has proved to be a general and effective method of preparing MOFs for solution-phase catalysis reactions, especially when thermal activation is problematic. The next goal was to determine whether the urea-containing NU-601 after MeNO2 exchange/activation could function as an HBD catalyst. Given NU-601’s medium pore size, it was necessary to model substrates and products from known HBD reactions12,10,11,13 using MM2 to predict whether these mole- cules could penetrate the MOF structure. The Friedel−Crafts reaction between pyrroles and nitroalkenes19 was identified as a potential test for NU-601, since the substrates appeared to be accommodated by the pores and the corresponding homoge- neous reaction employs a urea catalyst similar to strut 1.14 During this in silico evaluation, we also determined that any Figure 2.

Soc. 2012, 134, 3334−3337 3335 Friedel−Crafts products between pyrroles and nitroalkenes bound to a urea site within NU-601 (directly after carbon− carbon bond formation) would be large enough to preclude access to a second adjacent site, thereby blocking catalysis by ∼50% of the ureas within the MOF (see the SI). The initial experiments to catalyze the Friedel−Crafts reaction between N-methylpyrrole (5) and (E)-1-nitroprop-1-ene (6) with 10 mol % NU-601 (0.1 M in toluene at 23 °C; Figure 4) afforded no consumption of 6 as observed by GC (data not shown). This result was attributed to product inhibition in the nonpolar solvent, which is used in homogeneous systems to increase the catalyst−substrate interactions (i.e., the overall reaction rate). To promote catalyst turnover and product displacement by substrates in the more challenging heterogeneous system, the reaction solvent (toluene) was changed to a more polar mixture (1:1 MeNO2/THF) to potentially facilitate more H-bonding exchange. In addition, the reaction concentration and tem- perature were increased to 1.0 M and 60 °C. Under these new reaction conditions, 98% consumption of 6 was observed after 36 h. Next, we compared NU-601 to diphenylurea, a homogeneous urea (under our reaction conditions) prone to oligomerization/ self-quenching as observed in the solid state.16 As shown in Figure 4, NU-601 is a more active catalyst than diphenylurea for the Friedel−Crafts reaction (90% conv. at 18 h vs 65% conv.). These overall rate data validate the hypothesis that encapsulating a urea catalyst within a MOF leads to improved reactivity. Indeed, even when NU-601 was used at 5 mol % catalyst loading (which assumes every catalyst site is available), it compared favorably to diphenylurea (80% conv. at 18 h vs 68% conv.). Importantly, NU-601 showed a significantly higher rate of substrate consumption versus the control reaction. We then sought to confirm that the active catalyst species did not leach into solution by performing the reaction with removal of NU-601 after 6 h. This elicited a sharp decrease in the rate, which is strong evidence that the reaction is heterogeneous in nature (see the SI). NU-601 also proved to be reusable, maintaining its reactivity after one cycle of use and experiencing only a slight degradation of reactivity after five cycles while retaining its crystallinity as determined by PXRD (see the SI). We next investigated whether the catalysis occurred on the surface or within the pores of NU-601 by using larger substrates as steric probes (Scheme 2). Toward this end, when 1-phenethyl-1H-pyrrole (8) and/or (E)-(4-nitrobut-3-en-1-yl)- benzene (9) were employed, the substrate consumption and reaction yield decreased rapidly. These observations provide strong evidence that NU-601 exhibits reagent size selectivity, since large and small reagents show similar reactivities in related homogeneous systems (see the SI). Another key result is that while an observable amount (<5%) of Friedel−Crafts product 10 was detected when nitroalkene 9 was used with 5, no Friedel−Crafts products were observed when pyrrole 8 was used, suggesting that large substrates, especially pyrroles, cannot enter the porous network. To investigate further the size selec- tivity of NU-601, we performed a competition reaction by com- bining 6 and the larger conjugate acceptor 9 (1 equiv each) with 5 under the standard urea MOF conditions using 5 mol % NU-601. While both products 7 and 10 were possible, especially in a homogeneous approach, we were pleased to only observe 7, albeit in a diminished yield (see the SI). In summary, a novel urea-containing MOF was synthesized from a tetracarboxylate strut (1), 4,4′-bipyridine, and Zn(NO3)2· 6H2O. This new material is a competent and size-selective hydrogen-bond-donor catalyst for Friedel−Crafts reactions. When NU-601 is used, large substrates show significantly diminished yields versus small substrates, strongly supporting the conclusion that catalysis occurs mainly within the pores. This new heterogeneous organocatalyst also shows an increased rate enhancement versus diphenylurea, which presumably is limited in reactivity as a catalyst because of self-quenching behavior. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first example of hydrogen-bonding catalysis in a MOF. Efforts are currently underway in our laboratories to synthesize MOF- based HBD catalysts that are more highly active and to design other MOF-based heterogeneous systems that provide different characteristics than corresponding homogeneous systems.

Modeling with the aryl rings aligned in-plane with the urea carbonyl group clearly showed that the ester substituents of one urea engender destablizing/unfavorable van der Waals interactions with a second 3,5-dicarboxyurea ester before the carbonyl group of one molecule is close enough to the NH groups of a second urea molecule for intermolecular self-quenching.

The reagents and solvent were added to a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask and sonicated until the solution was homogeneous. This flask was capped with a rubber septum and placed in an oven set to 90 °C. After 2 days light yellow needle crystals were visible. The solvent was replaced with fresh DMF (50 ml), which had been warmed to 90 °C. The flask was then allowed to cool to room temperature. The crystals were isolated by vacuum filtration and exchanged with MeNO2 by suspending the crystals in a fresh MeNO2 solution and exchanging the solution every day for 4 days. After four days of exchanging NMR spectroscopy (500 MHz, D2SO4) was used to confirm all of the DMF had been removed (Figure S8). From Figure S9, one can see there are 3.4 MeNO2 molecules per strut 1, corresponding to 3.4 MeNO2 molecules per unit cell. If a unit cell has one molecule of 1 (minus 4 hydrogen atoms), two 4-4’ BIPY molecules, 2 zinc atoms, and 3.4 MeNO2 molecules (mw unit cell = 384+(166*2)+(65*2)+(61*3.4) = 1053) then the unit cell is 36.46% 1 w/w (384/1053 = 0.3646). Total amount of NU-601 isolated was 280 mg, so with a theoretical mass of 496 mg (0.181g of 1/0.3646), the % yield is 56.5%. IR (ATR) 3385, 1611, 1555, 1415, 1373, 1219, 782, 725, 631 cm-1. Experimental Procedures for Catalysis Reactions and Conversion Plots. A stock solution of (E)-1-nitroprop-1-ene (6) in 1:1 THF:MeNO2 with mesitylene as an internal standard was prepared by mixing 5ml of THF, 5ml of MeNO2, 0.773 ml 6, and 0.125 ml of mesitylene (Stock Solution A). A similar stock solution was prepared in the same manner, but instead of using 6, 1.772g of (E)-(4-nitrobut-3-en-1-yl)benzene2 (9) was used (Stock Solution B). % conversion and % yield calculations were done using 5 μl of mesitylene/reaction as an internal standard. GC measurements were made using an Agilent Systems 6890 Network GC with a 7683 Series Injector. HP CORE Chemstation software was used on the GC, and we employed a Agilent 19091J-413 column using a method ramping from 30 °C to 170 °C @ 15 °C/min and following the ramp a 10 min hold @ 170 °C. We employed a 10:1 split ratio, 22.2 ml/min flow @ 9.52 psi and used 2 μl injections. NMR yields were calculated using mesitylene as an internal standard. Preparative HPLC was preformed using a 1200 Agilent HPLC with a 6130 MS quadrapole analyzer and a IFC-PAL Fraction Collector/Autosampler and Chemstation software (B 04.02). 2 Taylor, E. C.; Liu, B.

Page S10 Modeling of Product 7 in NU-601 With NU-601 as the HBD catalyst, when product molecule 7 is bound to a urea active site, another catalyst site proximal to the bound product molecule is obstructed. This unfavorable interaction decreases the number of possible catalyst sites ~50% of all possible sites available. In our model, made using VMD, the bond distances between the nitro group on 7 and the hydrogen atoms on the urea nitrogen atoms (atom center to atom center) is 2.25 Å, which is consistent with crystallographic data.3 By placing two molecules of product 7 in neighboring unit cells, the distance between one product molecule and another can be estimated. Using the van der Waals radii of oxygen (1.5 Å) and hydrogen (1.2 Å), the distance between van der Waals surfaces of the molecules (the pyrrole hydrogen on the left molecule to the nitro group oxygen on the right molecule) is 1.6 Å, which would preclude two product molecules being next to each other at the same time. Shown below in Figure S4 is a graphical representation of the two product molecules hydrogen bound in NU-601. Figure S4. Two molecules of product 7 bound to adjacent urea sites in NU-601.

Page S11 Characterization of NU-601 A single crystal of NU-601 was mounted in oil on glass a fiber and placed under a nitrogen cold stream at 100K on a Bruker AXS APEX2 diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector and a CuKα IμS microsource with MX optics. The crystal used for data collection was twinned, therefore scaling and an absorption correction were applied via TWINABS. The “detwinned” HKLF4 format data yielded the best refinement model. All solvent molecules, though highly disordered, were refined. See supporting CIF files for further refinement details. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns for NU-601 were collected using a Rigaku XDS 2000 diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Predicted PXRD spectra were generated using Mercury v. 2.4 for Mac OsX. Samples were mounted on quartz sample holders as a slurry of ground NU-601 and DMF. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was recorded on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851e interfaced with a PC using Star software. The heating range was from 25 °C to 600 °C. The heating rate was 10 ºC/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. All samples were filtered directly from DMF solutions before the experiment. PXRD of NU-601. Figure S4.
