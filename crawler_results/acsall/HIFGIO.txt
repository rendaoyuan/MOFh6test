Manuscript Structural Diversity and Luminescence Properties of Coordination Polymers Built With a Rigid Linear Dicarboxylate and Zn(II)/Pb(II) Ion Jhasaketan Sahu, Musheer Ahmad, and Parimal K. Bharadwaj* Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, 208016, India * S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: A rigid linear ligand incorporating a carboxylic acid group at either end, p-terphenyl-4,4″-dicarboxylic acid, 2′,5′- dimethyl (H2L) has been used to construct four coordination polymers with Zn(II) through solvothermal techniques. The four products formed are formulated as {[Zn3(L)2(OH)2]·8EtOH·4DMF}n (1), {[Zn(L)(bpmp)0.5]·EtOH·1/2DMF}n (2), {[(Zn)0.5(L)0.5(py)0.5]·5/2DMF·EtOH}n (3), and [Zn(L)(HNMe2)]n (4). With Pb(NO3)2 the ligand aﬀords two polymers, {[Pb2(L)1.5(O)0.5]·EtOH·2H2O}n (5) and {[Pb3(L)3(H2O)]·6H2O}n (6). All of these compounds have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diﬀraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, elemental analysis, and powder X-ray diﬀraction measurements. Topological analyses reveal that complex 2 is a 6-connected pcu net, while complexes 3 and 4 are simpliﬁed as a 4-connected sql net. In the case of complexes 1 and 6, one-dimensional rod-shaped metal carboxylate based secondary building units have been obtained. However, an uncommon structure and topology have been obtained in complex 5. Surprisingly, such type of parallel ladder-like packing is not explored much in coordination polymers. Solid-state photoluminescence studies have been carried out for all of the complexes upon excitation at 347 nm at room temperature. ■INTRODUCTION Coordination polymers1 have attracted considerable attention during the last couple of decades not only due to their fascinating connectivities and topologies but also for their potential applications as functional materials in many ﬁelds such as luminescence,2 chemical sensors,3 separation,4 magnet- ism,5 gas adsorption,6 catalysis,7 and so on. Recently, luminescent coordination polymers have been widely examined for their practical applications in ﬂuorescence sensors,8 nonlinear optics,9 photocatalysis,10 and biomedical imaging.11 Meanwhile, the rational design of coordination polymers is very challenging and depends on the judicious selection of linkers as well as metal ions. In this context, aromatic polycarboxylate linkers12 and their analogues have been extensively utilized to synthesize various coordination polymers having beautiful architectures with excellent physical properties. These aromatic polycarboxylates in particular are very promising candidates due to their abundant modes of coordination to the metal ions as well as the ability to show properties such as luminescence. Although unsubstituted carboxylate ligands have been studied comprehensively, less attention has been given to the methyl- substituted polycarboxylate ligands. Introduction of methyl groups in the aromatic polycarboxylates alters the planarity which has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the topologies of the ﬁnal structure of the coordination polymers.13 Here, we have chosen a rigid and symmetric ligand, p-terphenyl-4,4″-dicarboxylic acid, 2′,5′-dimethyl (H2L) (Scheme 1), which can potentially aﬀord various coordination modes as well as diverse architectures. It is also capable of showing luminescence due to the presence of three phenyl rings. Besides, metal ions play an important role in Received: March 13, 2013 Revised: April 9, 2013 Article pubs.acs.org/crystal © XXXX American Chemical Society A dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg400376g | Cryst. Growth Des. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX the formation of coordination polymers depending upon its coordination tendencies. Often d10 transition metal ions14 such as Zn(II) and Cd(II) are of main interest in luminescence studies due to the lack of a quenching eﬀect such as paramagnetic transition metal ions and high transparency in the UV region. Pb(II) are also used in luminescence coordination polymers.15 In addition to this, reaction conditions are another important factor aﬀecting the ﬁnal architecture of the coordination polymers.16 For example, we have illustrated that the addition of diﬀerent bases can play an important role in controlling the ﬁnal structures of complexes 1, 3, and 4. Often, successful incorporation of various coligands having diﬀerent functionalities also allow construction of frameworks with a greater variety of structural motifs, compared with using only one type of ligand.17 Introduction of pyridine-based ditopic coligands18 into the reaction medium can result in a wide variety of interesting architectures. Herein, we report four coordination polymers of Zn(II) having the formulas {[Zn3(L)2(OH)2]·8EtOH·4DMF}n (1), { [ Z n ( L ) ( b p m p ) 0 . 5 ] · E t O H · 1 / 2 D M F } n ( 2 ) , {[(Zn)0.5(L)0.5(py)0.5]·5/2DMF·EtOH}n (3), and [Zn(L)- (HNMe2)]n (4), and two Pb(II) based coordination polymers, { [ P b 2 ( L ) 1 . 5 ( O ) 0 . 5 ] · E t O H · 2 H 2 O } n ( 5 ) a n d {[Pb3(L)3(H2O)]·6H2O}n (6) with the ligand, H2L.

Reagent grade 1,4-dibromo-2,5-dimethyl benzene, 4- methoxycarbonylphenylboronic acid, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)- palladium, piperazine, 4-(chloromethyl)pyridine hydrochloride, Zn- (NO3)2·6H2O, and Pb(NO3)2 were acquired from Aldrich and used as received. All other chemicals and solvents were obtained from S. D. Fine Chemicals, India. Solvents were puriﬁed following standard procedures prior to use. Physical Measurements. Infrared spectra were obtained (KBr disk, 400−4000 cm−1) on a Perkin-Elmer Model 1320 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were obtained on a Mettler Toledo Star System (heating rate of 5 °C/min). Microanalyses for the compounds were performed using a CE-440 elemental analyzer (Exeter Analytical Inc.). Solid-state photoexcitation and emission spectra were recorded using double UV−Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian Model Cary 5000) and Jobin Yvon Horiba Fluorolog-3 spectroﬂuorimeter at room temperature. Variable temperature powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns for the compounds (CuKα radiation, scan rate 3°/min, 293 K) were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance Series 2 powder X-ray diﬀractometer. Single-Crystal X-ray Studies. Single crystal X-ray data of complexes 1−6 were collected at 100 K on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD diﬀractometer using graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The linear absorption coeﬃcients, scattering factors for the atoms, and the anomalous dispersion corrections were referred to from the International Tables for X-ray Crystallography.19 The data integration and reduction were worked out with SAINT20 software. Empirical absorption correction was applied to the collected reﬂections with SADABS,21 and the space group was determined using XPREP.22 The structure was solved by the direct methods using SHELXTL-9723 and reﬁned on F2 by full-matrix least-squares using the SHELXTL-97 program24 package. All non-H atoms were reﬁned anisotropically except N1 atom of complex 3 and O2, O7, C23, C45, C66 atoms of complex 6. The H-atoms of lattice solvent molecules in complex 5 and the H-atoms of coordinated water molecule in complex 6 could not be located in diﬀerence Fourier maps. The H-atoms attached to carbon atoms were positioned geometrically and treated as riding atoms using SHELXL default parameters. Several DFIX commands were used for ﬁxing some bond distances in complexes 1, 3, 5, and 6. Squeeze reﬁnement was performed for 1−3 and 6 using PLATON.25 It shows two EtOH and one N,N-dimethylformamide molecules for 1, one EtOH and half N,N-dimethylformamide molecules for 2, one EtOH and 2.5 N,N-dimethylformamide molecules for 3, while six water molecules are found for 6 per formula weight. The contribution of all the solvent atoms has been incorporated in both the empirical formulas and formula weights of the complexes. The crystal and reﬁnement data are collected in Table 1. Selective bond distances and angles are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Synthesis of the Ligands.

The IR spectra of all the complexes show strong absorption bands between 1712 cm−1 and 1406 cm−1 attributable28 to coordinated carboxylate groups.29 Broad bands at the region 3610−3312 cm−1 indicate the presence of hydroxyl groups30 as well as lattice and coordinated water molecules.31 Sharp peaks between 1647 cm−1 and 1674 cm−1 in the IR spectra of complexes 1−3 are indicative of the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide mole- cules. Structural Description. Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis reveals that complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg400376g | Cryst. Growth Des. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX C space group C2/m, and the asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically independent Zn(II) sites (one with half occupancy and second one with one-fourth occupancy), half L2−ligand, half OH group in addition to a half DMF molecule and two EtOH molecules in the lattice. Both the carboxylate groups of the L2−ligand adopt μ4-η1:η1:η1:η1 coordination mode in bridging fashion. The coordination modes of L2−are shown in Figure 1a. The Zn(II) ions form a trimeric unit through bonding from a bridging μ3-OH group and carboxylate group of L2−ligand. In the trimeric unit, Zn(1) sits on the 2-fold axis of symmetry as well as resides on a mirror plane and shows a distorted octahedral coordination environment where as Zn(2) sits on the 2-fold axis of symmetry and shows a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Zn(1) is coordinated to four bridging carboxylates from four diﬀerent L2−(Zn−O = 1.983(5) Å) occupying the Figure 1. (a−e) Coordination modes of L2−in complexes 1−6. Figure 2. (a−f) Metal coordination modes in complexes 1−6. Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg400376g | Cryst. Growth Des. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX D equatorial positions and two bridging μ3-OH (Zn−O = 2.039(4) Å) occupying the axial positions. Zn(2) is coordinated to two diﬀerent carboxylates of L2−(Zn−O = 1.930(3) Å) and two bridging μ3-OH (Zn−O = 2.004(3) Å) as depicted in Figure 2a. All Zn−O bond distances are consistent with the reported Zn based coordination polymers.2 The trimeric units extend to a 3D framework via bridging carboxylate group of L2−ligands and bridging μ3-OH groups. Notably, the open framework in 1 is sustained exclusively by 1-D metal cluster chain running along the c-direction as shown in Figure 3a. This packing gives rise to rhombic-shaped channels along the diagonals with a dimension of ca. 31.65 × 21.21 Å2. Topology analysis of 1 using the Topos software32 indicates that it can be described as parallel packing ladder-like rods as building units. Within these units, both tetrahedral and octahedral units bound to four and two carboxylate groups respectively (Figure 3b). These groups are further coordinated to the metal center via bridging μ3-OH ions. Thus, inﬁnite Zn−O−C rods are stacked parallel as ladders which is further connected by organic linkers to give the sra net (Figure 3c).33 Complex 2 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1̅ with the asymmetric unit consists of one Zn(II) ion, one ligand L2−, a half of the bpmp coligand besides one EtOH and a half DMF molecules in the lattice. The carboxylate groups of the L2− ligand bind to the metal in a similar fashion as in 1. The metal ion shows a distorted square-pyramidal (τ = 0.02) ZnNO4 coordination from four carboxylate O (Zn−O = 2.024(2)− 2.123(3) Å) from four L2−ligands and one N (Zn−N = 2.039(3) Å) from pyridyl group of the bpmp ligand (Figure 2b). The coordination of carboxlylates to the metal ions leads to a paddle-wheel [Zn2(OCO)4] secondary building unit (SBU) with a Zn···Zn separation of 2.990 Å which further propagates to a 3D framework via N atoms of the ﬂexible bpmp ligand (Figure 4). These ancilliary bpmp ligands act as pillars interconnecting the M4L4 layers in the crystallographic 101 direction. Overall, a 3-fold interpenetrating architecture is Figure 3. Representation of (a) 3D view of framework with SBUs linked via linear ligand, (b) ball-and-stick model of SBUs, and (c) parallel packing ladder-like rods in complex 1.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX E generated because of the interpenetration of three 3D frameworks (Figure 5). On considering the rigid linear ligand L2−and bpmp coligand as lines and dimeric Zn2 cluster as one node, complex 2 can be simpliﬁed as a 6-connected pcu net with point symbol {412.63}(Figure 6). Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis reveals that complex 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/m. The asymmetric unit consists of a half Zn(II) ion, a half L2−ligand, and a half pyridine molecule besides two and a half DMF and a EtOH molecules in the lattice. Zn(II) exhibits an ideal square pyramidal (τ = 0) ZnNO4 coordination with ligation from four diﬀerent carboxylate O (Zn−O = 2.023(5)−2.029(4) Å) of L2− ligands occupying the basal positions and one pyridyl N (Zn− N = 1.996(8) Å) (Figure 2c), situated at the apical position. All Zn−O and Zn−N bond distances are within the range reported for Zn(II)-based coordination polymers.2 Here, carboxylate coordination to the metal ions results in a classical paddle- wheel SBU. Further, these paddle-wheels extend to a 2D grid- like structure by L2−ligands in the crystallographic 201 plane. Because of stacking of the 2D grids involving strong noncovalent CH···π interactions between the pyridine moieties of adjacent layers, an overall 3D supramolecular architecture is obtained (Figures 7 and 8). On considering the rigid linear ligand L2−as line and dimeric Zn2 clusters as one node, complex 3 can be simpliﬁed as a 4- connected sql net with point symbol {44.62} (Figure 9). Complex 4 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbca with the asymmetric unit consisting of one Zn(II) ion, one L2− ligand, and a coordinated dimethylamine molecule. Zn(II) shows a distorted tetrahedral coordination from carboxylate O (Zn−O = 1.941(2)−1.989(2) Å) of three diﬀerent L2−ligands and a N (Zn−N = 2.021(3) Å) atom of dimethylamine produced by in situ hydrolysis of solvent DMF (Figure 2d). Here, the two carboxylate groups of the L2−ligand bind diﬀerently to the metal ions viz., μ3-η0:η1:η1:η1 coordination mode (Figure 1b), leading to a 2D sheet-like structure. These 2D sheets are stacked along the b-axis through H-bonding between −NH of the coordinated dimethylamine moiety and the free carboxylate O of L2−ligand from adjacent layers. In addition, 2D sheets are also generated perpendicular to the stacked layers involving CH···π interactions which results in a polycatenated 3D supramolecular architecture (Figure 10). The framework 4 can also be described as 4-connected sql net with point symbol {44.62} (Figure 11). Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis reveals that complex 5 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. The asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically independ- ent Pb(II) ions, one and a half L2−ligands, a μ4-O in addition to one EtOH, and two H2O molecules in the lattice. The four Pb(II) ions form a tetranuclear unit [Pb4(μ4-O)]6+ through bonding from one bridging μ4-O. This tetrahedral Pb4O cluster is not very common in the literature.34 Each tetrahedral cluster is linked to six neighboring ones by six L2−ligands. Out of the six L2−ligands four show μ5:η1:η2:η1:η2 and two μ6:η2:η2:η2:η2 L2−binding modes (Figure 1c,d). In the tetramer, Pb1 shows a distorted pentagonal pyramidal geometry with ligation from carboxylate O (Pb−O = 2.520(3)−2.686(3) Å) from four L2− ligands besides the bridging μ4-O (Pb−O = 2.247(3) Å). Pb2 shows a distorted octahedral geometry with bonding from carboxylate O (Pb−O = 2.561(3)−2.736(3) Å) from four L2− ligands and the bridging μ4-O (Pb−O = 2.332(3) Å) (Figure 2e). Bonding of the L2−ligands to the Pb4O clusters lead to a 3D framework (Figure 12). Large channels with the dimension of ca. 37.76 × 13.89 Å2 can be seen in the framework when viewed along the crystallographic b-axis. The channels are not empty but contain water and EtOH molecules in the form of a chain through H-bonding interactions (Figure 13). On considering the rigid linear ligand L2−as lines and Pb4O as a 6-connected node by topological analysis of 6, it can be described as parallel packing ladder-like rods as building units. These rods are further linked by the L2−ligands generating a 3D framework (Figure 14). Complex 6 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Cc, and the asymmetric unit consists of three crystallographically independent Pb(II) ions, three L2−ligands, one coordinated aqua molecule, and six lattice water molecules. The Pb(II) ions form a trimeric unit through bonding from the carboxylate groups of the L2−ligands. In the trimer, both Pb1 and Pb3 exhibit hexa coordination from carboxylate O (Pb−O = 2.409(6)−2.746(14) Å) of ﬁve diﬀerent L2−ligands. Both Figure 5.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX F Pb1 and Pb3 are in a distorted octahedral coordination environment. However, Pb2 adopts a distorted pentagonal pyramidal geometry through bonding from four diﬀerent L2− ligands (Pb−O = 2.375(7)−2.739(6) Å) and a coordinated aqua (Pb−O = 2.457(8) Å) molecule (Figure 2f). All the bond distance values are within the range reported for Pb(II)-based coordination polymers.34 The carboxylate groups ligate to the metal ions in a diﬀerent fashion as μ4:η1:η1:η2:η2 and μ6:η2:η2:η2:η2 (Figure 1c,e). This connectivity pattern is repeated inﬁnitely to create Pb−C−O rods along the crystallographic c direction. Topological simpliﬁcation with Topos software32 shows parallel packing ladder-like rods as building units. These rods are further linked by the L2−ligands, which connect each rod to four neighboring rods generating a 3D framework. The overall structure shows rhombic channels with a dimension of ca. 36.04 × 12.11 Å2 along the crystallographic c-axis (Figure 15). Thermal stabilities of all the six complexes were examined.29 Complex 1 shows weight loss of ∼15.23% (expected = 15.27%) in the temperature range, 60−260 °C corresponding to loss of one DMF and two EtOH molecules. The desolvated framework is found to be stable up to ∼400 °C. Complex 2 exhibits a weight loss of ∼13.02% (expected = 13.18%) in the Figure 7.

Decomposition of this complex takes place only above 380 °C. Complex 3 shows a weight loss of ∼31.60% (expected =31.88%) in the temperature range 50−350 °C that corresponds to loss of two and a half DMF and one EtOH molecules. Decomposition of the complex is accomplished beyond 390 °C. Complex 4 exhibits no weight loss and found to be stable up to ∼360 °C. Complex 5 exhibits a weight loss of ∼8.21% (expected = 8.04%) in the temperature range of 50−320 °C that corresponds to loss of one EtOH and two water molecules. Gradual decomposition of complex 5 takes place only above 410 °C. Complex 6 exhibits a weight loss of ∼6.25% (expected = 6.18%) in the temperature range of 50−250 °C that corresponds to loss of six water molecules. It shows thermal stability up to 400 °C, and gradual decomposition is observed beyond this temperature. PXRD Analysis. Powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) patterns of complexes 1−6 were in excellent agreement with the simulated patterns. The observed diﬀerences in intensity could be due to preferred orientation of the powder samples (Supporting Information, S7−S12). Luminescence Properties. Luminous MOF with carbox- ylate-based systems and close-shell metal ions have been reported in the literature.35 The solid-state luminescence of complexes 1−6 as well as the free ligand H2L were investigated at room temperature. The results are depicted in Figure 16. It can be seen that the metal-free H2L exhibits an emission band at 403 nm with excitation at 347 nm. Irradiation of crystalline complexes 1−6 with ultraviolet light (λex = 347 nm) at room temperature results in broad unsymmetrical emissions. Since the proﬁle of the emission band is quite similar to that of the metal-free ligand, the emission of 1−6 could be attributed to intraligand (π−π*) emission. The diﬀerence in the emission behavior in 1−6 may be due to diﬀerences in the nature of encapsulatd guest, crystal packing, and nature of metal clusters. The possibility of cluster-centered transitions can also be ruled out in 1−6 because of the metal···metal separation in the cluster is more than ∼3.6 Å. Compared with the ligand, the complexes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 display enhancement in luminescent intensity. Usually, the rigidity imposed by the lattice in metal− organic frameworks constrains the ligands in such a way that is not typically observed for a free complex in solution, which reduces the loss of energy by radiation-less decay and thus photoluminescence intensity and also quantum eﬃciencies enhanced.36 In addition to this, the quenching of ﬂuorescence Figure 10.

We have chosen a symmetrical rigid carboxylate based organic ligand for construction of coordination polymers with d10 metal ions. Topologically complexes 2, 3, and 4 are normally observed in coordination polymers, while complexes 1 and 6 are unusual rod-type. However, an uncommon structure and topology has been obtained in complex 5. Solid-state emissions of the complexes have been recorded at room temperature. We are in the process of synthesizing similar type ligands for constructing coordination polymers for various applications. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information X-ray crystallographic data in CIF format, table for selected bond angles and bond distances for complexes 1−6, and complete data for IR, TGA analysis, PXRD and UV/vis.
