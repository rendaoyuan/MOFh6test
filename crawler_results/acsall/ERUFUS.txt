R. China Joan Ribas Departament de Quı´mica Inorga`nica, UniVersitat de Barcelona, Diagonal, 647, 08028-Barcelona, Spain Received August 24, 2003 Six new metal-organic coordination networks based on linking unit 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole (L1) or 2,5- bis(3-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (L3) and inorganic CuII, CdII, and CoII salts have been prepared and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Using L1 to react with three different CuII salts, Cu(OAc)2‚H2O, Cu(NO3)2‚3H2O, and CuSO4‚5H2O, respectively, two different one-dimensional (1-D) coordination polymers, {[Cu2L1(µ-OAc)4](CHCl3)2}n (1) [triclinic, space group P1h, a ) 7.416(3) Å, b ) 8.207(3) Å, c ) 14.137(5) Å, R ) 100.333(7)°, â ) 105.013(6)°, γ ) 94.547(6)°, Z ) 1] and {[CuL1(NO3)2](CHCl3)0.5}n (2) [monoclinic, space group C2/c, a ) 28.070(8) Å, b ) 9.289(3) Å, c ) 15.235(4) Å, â ) 113.537(5)°, Z ) 8], and a chiral 3-D open framework, {[CuL1(H2O)(SO4)](H2O)2}n (3) [orthorhombic, space group P212121, a ) 5.509(2) Å, b ) 10.545(4) Å, c ) 29.399(11) Å, Z ) 4], were obtained. Reaction of L1 and Cd(ClO4)2‚6H2O or Co(ClO4)2‚6H2O, in the presence of NH4SCN, yielded another 3-D open framework, {[CdL1(NCS)2](CH3OH)1.5}n (4) [monoclinic, space group C2/c, a ) 28.408(10) Å, b ) 9.997(5) Å, c ) 7.358(4) Å, â ) 99.013(8)°, Z ) 4], or a 2-D network, {[Co(L1)2(NCS)2]- (H2O)2.5}n (5) [orthorhombic, space group Pnna, a ) 22.210(5) Å, b ) 12.899(3) Å, c ) 20.232(4) Å, Z ) 4]. When L1 was replaced by L3 to react with Co(ClO4)2‚6H2O and NH4SCN, another 2-D coordination polymer, [Co(L3)2(NCS)2]n (6) [monoclinic, space group P21/c, a ) 8.120(3) Å, b ) 9.829(4) Å, c ) 17.453(6) Å, â ) 103.307(6)°, Z ) 2], was constructed. These results indicate that the nature of the ligands, metal centers, or counteranions plays the critical role in construction of these novel coordination polymers. The interesting porous natures of two 3-D open frameworks 3 and 4 were investigated by TGA and XPRD techniques, and the magnetic properties of the CuII and CoII complexes were studied by variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements. Introduction The crystal engineering of one-, two-, or three-dimensional coordination polymers has attracted considerable current attention, not only because of their novel topologies and fascinating structural diversities,1 but also for their potential applications in optical, electrical, magnetic, and microporous materials.2 The ultimate aim of supramolecular chemistry is to control the structure of the target product with tailored properties and functions, for which much effort has been devoted to the attempts at designing and constructing new coordination polymers with specific network topologies, and * Corresponding author.

The synthetic strategies for these polymers come from a variety of parameters, basically including the versatile coordination geometries of metal nodes, and the design of suitable organic ligands. So far, a variety of discrete and a wide range of one- or multidimen- sional infinite solid-state coordination architectures have been achieved by chemists in the past decade.1,3 We and others have been currently investigating the coordination chemistry of an angular dipyridyl-donor ligand, 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (L2), and its 3-N-donor analogue 2,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (L3) (see Chart 1).4a-h Such ligands exhibit several particular characteristics when bonding to the metal centers: (a) As reported in our previous work, these ligands can take versatile bonding modes, such as monodentate (using one pyridyl nitrogen donor), bidentate bridging (using two pyridyl nitrogen donors), and tridentate bridging (using two pyridyl and one oxadiazole nitrogen donors) coordination fashions in different conditions. (b) The structural geometries of the ligands themselves are also multiform. The dihedral angles between the oxadiazole ring and two pyridyl rings as well as that between two pyridyl rings within each ligand are changeful and adaptable to meet the requirements for constructing diverse frameworks, and so is the angle between the central oxadiazole ring and two pyridyl nitrogen donors. With respect to L3, it can exhibit three trans or cis conformations under approximate conditions. (c) The aromatic groups within each ligand, including two pyridyl rings and the central oxadiazole system, sometimes show a tendency to completely or partly participate in intermolecular π-π interactions, which may affect the packing arrangement of the crystal structures. Recently, the role of anions in the construction of novel AgI coordination polymers with a related ligand, 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole (L1, Chart 1), was initially investigated by us, and some different structural features were observed in these complexes com- pared with the corresponding Ag-L2 supramolecular systems.4i As a continuation of our systemic contribution on this interesting project, we describe here the preparation and structural characterization of a series of new CuII, CdII, and CoII coordination polymers with L1 and L3, including {[Cu2L1(µ-OAc)4](CHCl3)2}n (1), {[CuL1(NO3)2](CHCl3)0.5}n (2), {[CuL1(H2O)(SO4)](H2O)2}n (3), {[CdL1(NCS)2](CH3- OH)1.5}n (4), {[CoL12(NCS)2](H2O)2.5}n (5), and [CoL32- (NCS)2]n (6). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) techniques were utilized to study the porous natures of materials 3 and 4. The magnetic properties of the CuII and CoII complexes were investigated and the magneto-structural correlation also discussed in detail. Experimental Section Materials and General Methods. All the solvents and reagents for synthesis were commercially available and used as received. The ligand L1 was commercially available and used without further purification, and L3 was synthesized according to the literature procedure.5 Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra (KBr pellets) were taken on a FT-IR 170SX (Nicolet) spectrometer. Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiment was carried out on a Dupont thermal analyzer from room temperature to 800 °C under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/ min. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data were recorded on a Rigaku RU200 diffractometer at 60 kV, 300 mA for Cu KR radiation (λ ) 1.5406 Å), with a scan speed of 2 deg/min and a step size of 0.02° in 2θ. The calculated XRPD pattern was produced using the SHELXTL-XPOW program and single-crystal reflection data. Magnetic Studies. The variable-temperature magnetic suscep- tibilities were measured in “Servei de Magnetoquı´mica (Universitat de Barcelona)” on polycrystalline samples (ca. 30 mg) with a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID susceptometer operating at a magnetic field of 0.1 T between 2 and 300 K. The diamagnetic corrections were evaluated from Pascal’s constants for all the constituent atoms. Magnetization measurements were carried out at low temperature (2 K) in 0-5 T range.

CAUTION! Perchlorate complexes of metal ions in the presence of organic ligands are potentially explosive. Only a small amount of material should be handled with care. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determinations. X-ray single-crystal diffraction data for complexes 1-6 were collected on a Bruker Smart 1000 CCD diffractometer at 293(2) K with Mo KR radiation (λ ) 0.71073 Å) by φ-ω scan mode. The program SAINT6 was used for integration of the diffraction profiles. The crystal of 5 is sensitive to air and measured in a sealed capillary. All the structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS program of the SHELXTL package and refined by full-matrix least- squares methods with SHELXL (semiempirical absorption correc- tions were applied using SADABS program).7 Metal atoms in each complex were located from the E-maps, and other non-hydrogen atoms were located in successive difference Fourier syntheses and refined with anisotropic thermal parameters on F2. The hydrogen atoms of the ligand were generated theoretically onto the specific atoms and refined isotropically with fixed thermal factors (the hydrogen atoms of the coordianted water molecules in 3 and the solvent molecules were located using difference Fourier method). Further details for structural analysis are summarized in Table 1. Results and Discussion Synthesis and General Characterization. Complexes 1, 2, and 3 were prepared by the reactions of corresponding CuII salts with the ligand L1, the first two in CH3OH/CHCl3 and the latter in CH3OH/H2O medium (see Scheme 1). The reaction of Cu(NO3)2‚3H2O with L1 resulted in two types of crystals with different colors. One was complex 2 with a color of dark blue, as described above. The other unidentified light blue crystals (2a), which could not be investigated by X-ray analysis for their poor quality, were obtained later. The composition of 2a was proved to be definitely different from that of 2 by elemental analyses and IR spectroscopy.

Coordination Polymers from Dipyridyl Ligands Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 43, No. 3, 2004 933 isolated within few minutes using a 1:1 ligand-to-metal molar ratio in a stirring CH3OH/H2O solution, which was confirmed by elemental analyses, IR spectroscopy, and XPRD. Com- plexes 4, 5, and 6 were prepared under similar conditions. Similar to 3, a bulk sample of 4 could be obtained immediately by adding the CH3OH solution of an excess of NH4SCN directly to the stirring solution of CH3OH/CHCl3 containing Cd(ClO4)2‚6H2O and L1 in 1:1 molar ratio, which has also been confirmed by elemental analyses, IR spec- troscopy, and XPRD. Indeed, the final products for com- plexes 4, 5, and 6 were independent to the quantity of NH4SCN. The red crystalline samples of 5 are not stable and turn green gradually when exposed to air as stated above. The green substance is amorphous and insoluble in water solution, the composition of which seems to be {[Co(L1)2- (NCS)2](H2O)1.5}n (5a) according to the results of the elemental analyses. Exposing the sample of 5a to water vapor for 72 h to examine if the lost guest water molecule could be reintroduced, however, was negative. The IR spectra of all six complexes show absorption bonds resulting from the skeletal vibrations of the aromatic rings in the 1400-1600 cm-1 range. In the IR spectra of 3, 4, and 5, the broad band centered at ca. 3400 cm-1 indicates the O-H stretching of the aqua or CH3OH solvents. For 1, the characteristic bands of the acetate anions appear at 1615 νas(C-O), 1430 for νsym(C-O), and 700 cm-1 for δ(O-C-O). The ∆value (νas - νsym) indicates that the acetate anion coordinates to the CuII center in bridging mode. For 2, the characteristic bands of the NO3- anions appear at the range 1479-1509 cm-1 for νa (NO2), 1293 cm-1 for νs (NO2), and 1016 cm-1 for ν (NO). The (νa - νs) value is in the range 186-216 cm-1, suggesting the bidentate chelated coordina- tion mode of NO3- with CuII center. The IR spectrum for 3 displays the characteristic bands of the SO42- anions at 1026-1149 cm-1, 962 cm-1, and 660 cm-1, indicating the monodendate or tridendate coordination feature (C3V sym- metry) of SO42- groups when coordinated to the CuII center. The IR spectra show the very strong adsorption bands of the NCS- groups at 2068, 2094, and 2057 cm-1 for complexes 4, 5, and 6, respectively. X-ray Single-Crystal Structures of Complexes 1-6. {[Cu2L1(µ-OAc)4](CHCl3)2}n, 1. The structure of complex 1 consists of a 1-D neutral coordination chain [Cu2L1(OAc)4]n and CHCl3 solvent molecules. As shown in Figure 1, the CuII ion is pentacoordinated to four oxygen atoms of four distinct acetate anions (Cu-O lengths in 1.960(4)-1.978- (4) Å region) and one nitrogen atom from the pyridine ring of L1 (Cu-N ) 2.174(4) Å) to form a square-pyramid geometry. The CuII center deviates from the mean equatorial plane defined by four coordinated oxygen atoms toward the apical nitrogen atom by 0.193 Å. The bond distances and angles (Table 2) are similar to those in its analogues.4e,g Four acetate anions bridge two CuII centers in syn-syn fashion, to form a [Cu2(OAc)4] binuclear building unit, in which the Cu-Cu distance is rather short (2.617(1) Å). This Cu-Cu unit is further linked by the L1 ligands in a trans arrangement and thus generates the 1-D linear chain with the neighboring Cu‚‚‚Cu separation bridged by L1 of 15.219 Å. Two pyridyl rings within each L1 are parallel and related to each other by a crystallographic center of symmetry, which is not observed in the related compounds.4 The dihedral angle between the thiadiazole and the pyridyl ring is 30.0°. Figure 1. 1D chain structure for 1 (hydrogen atoms and CHCl3 molecules are omitted for clarity). Scheme 1 Huang et al. 934 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 43, No. 3, 2004 {[CuL1(NO3)2](CHCl3)0.5}n, 2. In complex 2, the CuII ion has a slightly distorted square-planar geometry composed of two oxygen atoms of two NO3- anions [Cu-O lengths of 1.997(3) and 2.007(3) Å] and two pyridyl nitrogen atoms from two distinct L1 ligands [Cu-N lengths of 1.983(3) and 1.998(3) Å]. Four N-Cu-O bond angles range from 87.0- (1)° to 91.31(1)° (Table 3). Weak coordination interactions, such as Cu(1)-O(2) (2.532(4) Å), Cu(1)-O(5) (2.646(1) Å), Cu(1)-N(5) (2.657(7) Å), Cu(1)-N(6) (2.729(4) Å), and Cu(1)-O(4) (2.651(2) Å, the O(4) atom from the NO3- also coordinating to another CuII center), were observed. The deviation of the CuII center from the mean coordination plane N(1)-N(4)-O(1)-O(4) is 0.110 Å. Different from com- plexes 1, 3, 4, and 5, the L1 ligands in 2 surrounding the CuII centers herein are in cis arrangement. Within each L1 molecule, the dihedral angle between two pyridyl rings is 7.3°. The bridging feature of L1 gives rise to an infinite linear [-Cu-L1-Cu-L1-]n chain with the N-Cu-N angle of 175.5(1)°. The intrachain neighboring Cu‚‚‚Cu distance is 14.784 Å, slightly shorter than that in complex 1 (15.219 Å). Moreover, two neighboring antiparallel chains are ligated together through the weak coordination interactions between the CuII centers and the NO3- anions, as previously noted, to form a 1-D double-chain motif (the shortest interchain Cu‚‚‚Cu distance is 3.854 Å). Within each double-chain architecture, two nearly parallel pyridyl rings (with a dihedral angle of 7.3°) from the different chains are involved in a π-π stacking interaction8 with the center-to-center separation of 3.737 Å (average interplanar separation ) 3.683 Å), and so are two strictly parallel thiadiazole rings characterized by the center-to-center separation of 3.532 Å (average interplanar separation ) 3.489 Å). Actually, such intermo- lecular aromatic contacts in this case should be considered as an effective force for the formation of this double-chain motif.8b These double-chains extend in two directions (with respect to each other by a 36.6° rotation) and stack alternating along the [001] direction (Figure 2b), leaving space occupied by the disordered CHCl3 molecules. A very similar structure based on 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene and Cu(NO3)2‚3H2O has been reported by Carlucci et al.3e {[CuL1(H2O)(SO4)](H2O)2}n, 3. Complex 3 is a more interesting material, which crystallizes in chiral space group P212121. It consists of a neutral 3-D porous network with guest water molecules included in the pores. The CuII ion coordinates to one aqua oxygen atom, two oxygen atoms of two SO4- anions, as well as two pyridyl nitrogen atoms from distinct L1 ligands (Figure 3a). The bond distance of Cu(1)- O(4) (2.396(3) Å) is longer compared with those of the remaining Cu-O (1.978(3) and 1.982(3) Å) or Cu-N (2.020(3) and 2.038(3) Å) lengths. Moreover, each CuII center also presents one long contact (Cu(1)-O(3) ) 2.625(1) Å) with one oxygen atom from the third SO4- anion. Taking into account this weak interaction, the coordination geometry of the CuII center can be described as a distorted octahedron with Jahn-Teller distortion. As shown in Figure 3b, each SO4- anion bridges three CuII ions in a µ3 coordination mode to form a 2-D (6,3) sheet in crystallographic ab plane (regarding the sulfur and copper atoms as the connecting nodes). The basic motif of the 2-D layer is the [Cu3(µ3-SO4)3] ring, in which three anion-bridged Cu‚‚‚Cu distances are 5.509, 5.903, and 6.088 Å, respec- tively. The Cu-O bond vector of the coordinated aqua is on the coordination sheet plane. These sheets are further connected by L1 in a trans arrangement along the [001] direction to form a 3-D open framework. The topology of this network has the Scha¨fli symbol (63).(69.8). The neigh- boring Cu‚‚‚Cu distance connected by L1 is 14.704 Å. Within each L1, two pyridyl rings bent to the same direction with a dihedral angle of 6.7°. Two types of centrosymmetrical openings are created in this network along the [100] direction (Figure 3c). The larger channels with the dimensions of ca. 14 Å × 6 Å are occupied by two uncoordinated water molecules, which represent ca. 19.9% of the total volume of the unit cell.9 The structure of 3 is isomorphic to that of {[CuL2(H2O)(SO4)](H2O)2}n, indicating such 3-D structure is thermodynamically stable.4h (8) (a) Janiak, C.

Coordination Polymers from Dipyridyl Ligands Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 43, No. 3, 2004 935 {[CdL1(NCS)2](CH3OH)1.5}n, 4. The structure of 4 also has a 3-D coordination framework, in which the CdII ion is six-coordinated to two nitrogen atoms and two sulfur atoms of four distinct NCS- groups, as well as two pyridyl nitrogen atoms from two L1 ligands. The metal center has an elongated octahedral coordination geometry with two longer Cd-S bonds (Cd-SNCS ) 2.722(2) Å) in the axial positions, and four shorter Cd-N bonds (Cd-Npy ) 2.368(3) Å, Cd- NNCS ) 2.309(3) Å) in the equatorial plane. The cis N-Cd-N and N-Cd-S bond angles range from 87.76(9)° to 92.24(9)° (Table 5). Both L1 and NCS- ligands herein are coordinated in a trans fashion. The geometry of the NCS- group is linear with the N-C-S angle of 179.59(2)°. The two pyridyl rings within each L1 deviate by 19.4° from coplanarity. The overall array of 4 is somewhat similar to that of 3; both of them are constructed by linking the 2-D metal-anion layers through L1-metal-L1-metal chains. Different from 3, however, herein each bridging NCS- group links two Figure 2.

The CdII centers in each layer are disposed at the nodes of a rhombic grid with the NSC-bridging Cd‚‚‚Cd distance of 6.207 Å. The angles of Cd(1)-S(2)-C(7) and Cd(1)-N(3)-C(7) are 98.8- (1)° and 165.2(3)°, respectively. Furthermore, each L1 links two Cd atoms from the neighboring layers with the L1- bridging Cd‚‚‚Cd distance of 15.220 Å.

These channels are not empty, and are filled with the disordered CH3OH molecules, which account for 25.4% of the total crystal volume. A similar host framework consisting of [CdL2- (NCS)2]n was reported recently, the voids of which are occupied by the CH3CN guest molecules.4b {[Co(L1)2(NCS)2](H2O)2.5}n, 5. The coordination environ- ment of the CoII ion in 5 is shown in Figure 5a. Each metal center is six-coordinated to two NCS- groups and four L1 ligands. The Co-N distance involving the NCS- group (Co- NNCS ) 2.080(9) Å) is shorter than the Co-Npy lengths (2.175(3) and 2.188(3) Å). It is clear that each CoII center lies in a slightly distorted octahedral environment with the cis N-Co-N angles being in the range 87.3(11)°-93.2- (10)°. The trans N-Co-N bond angles for NCS- and L1 ligands are 175.0(19)° and 177.5(1)°. The two pyridyl rings within each L1 deviate by 23.6° from coplanarity. The NCS- ligands are coordinated axially in a terminal mode with the angles of 167(3)° for Co(1)-N(5)-C(13) and 174(3)° for N(5)-C(13)-S(2). Selected bond distances and angles for 5 are listed in Table 6. Figure 5b shows the lamellar network of 5, in which the adjacent CoII centers are linked by the bridging L1 in two different directions to form large and nearly square repeating grids (the ligand-bridging Co‚‚‚Co distance is 15.022 Å and the internal angles of each square are 84.66° and 95.34°), forming a 2-D (4,4) sheet. These sheets are stacked along the b axis with an ABAB sequence, offset by approximately 0.25(a + c) along the ac plane so that large channels are created with a square cross section (ca. 9 Å × 9 Å), as illustrated in Figure 5b. The stacking separation between two adjacent sheets is ca. 6.4 Å, and the shortest intersheet Co‚‚‚Co distance is 8.505 Å. The disordered water molecules (2.5 per formula unit) are incorporated in the channels and the interlayer regions. An analysis of the voids of 5 shows ca. 32.0% of the space empty even if calculating the water molecules, and after the removal of these solvents, the empty space adds up to 47.0%. We have used L2 to react with Co(NCS)2 in a CH3CN/ CHCl3 medium, affording a mononuclear complex [Co(L2)- (NSC)2(H2O)2], whose extended structure contrasts greatly with that of complex 5.4d At first we considered that this discrepancy may result from the different solvents, as described in the literature.10 However, our further experi- ments showed the crystals of 5 could also be obtained by the reaction of L1 with Co(SCN)2 in various media, such as Figure 5.

[Co(L3)2(NCS)2]n, 6. The coordination environment of CoII ion in complex 6 is similar to that in 5 (Figure 6a). Each CoII center, being located at the inversion center, is in a compressed octahedral environment composed of two ni- trogen atoms of two NCS- groups in the axial positions and four pyridyl nitrogen atoms from four L3 molecules in the equatorial plane. The bond distance of the Co-NNCS (2.077- (3) Å) is shorter than that of Co-Npy [Co-N(1) ) 2.178(3) Å, Co-N(4) ) 2.247(3) Å], and the cis N-Co-N bond angles fall in the range 88.3(1)-91.8(1)°. The NSC- groups act as terminal ligands in a bent mode with the Co(1)-N(5)- C(13) bond angle of 157.2(3)°. Selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 7. In contrast to 5, where they are in a cis coordination fashion, herein two terminal NCS- groups are coordinated axially in a trans fashion. Two pyridyl rings within each L3 ligand deviate by 38.7° from coplanarity. The L3 ligand adopts a trans conformation, and each bridges two CoII centers to give a 2-D (4,4) sheet, featuring “double-edged axe-shaped” [Co4(L3)4] macrocycles as sub- units. The CoII atoms are disposed at the nodes of a rhombic grid in the undulating [Co(L3)2(SCN)2]n layer with the ligand- bridging Co‚‚‚Co distance of 11.559 Å (Figure 6b). These layers are stacked in an offset fashion with an ABAB sequence, resulting in interdigitation of the coordination NCS- groups in the cavities of the adjacent network (Figure 6c). Different from complex 5, such closely packed layered structure in 6 leaves no free space to accommodate guest molecules. The shortest intersheet Co‚‚‚Co distance is 8.120 Å. Comparing the structures of three thiocyanate-containing complexes 4-6, we find the NCS- groups take monodentate coordination mode and serve as terminal groups in 5 and 6; however, both Cd-NCS and Cd-SCN coordination fashions are preferable, and the NCS- group serves as bridging ligand in 4. This maybe results from the different natures of the CoII and CdII ions. Exclusion and Inclusion of Guest Molecules: TGA and XRPD Studies. Coordination polymers possessing porous channels are especially of great interest due to their unique properties. As described above, both complexes 3 and 4 have the appealing 3-D frameworks exhibiting open channels filled with guest molecules. The free void, if omitting the guest molecules, is 19.9% of the cell volume for 3 and 25.4% for 4. The question arises as to whether the framework or the structural regularity will be maintained after the removal of the guest molecules, which is essentially important for generating the new microporous materials. To verify this, we adopt TGA and XRPD techniques to investigate the (10) (a) Lu, J.; Paliwara, T.; Lim, S. C.; Yu, C.; Niu, T.; Jacobson, A. J. Inorg. Chem. 1997, 36, 923. (b) Withersby, M.

Huang et al. 940 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 43, No. 3, 2004 framework stability and removal-reintroduction the guest molecules of complexes 3 and 4. For 3, the TGA reveals there is a weight loss (found: 7.82%) from ca. 80 to 130 °C, corresponding to the loss of the free water molecules (calcd: 7.94%). The polycrystalline sample is stable up to 340 °C above which the decomposition starts. According to the TGA results, the freshly ground sample of 3 is evacuated at 160 °C for 6 h. It consequently experiences weight losses being consistent with the removal of two included water molecules per formula unit, which is also confirmed by elemental analyses. The similarity between the XPRD pattern recorded at this point and that of the original starting sample suggests the dried solid {[CuL1- (H2O)(SO4)]}n retains the initial crystal structure of 3. The slight shift and splitting of some peaks may be attributed to the subtle change of the relative positions of some atoms in the crystal lattice.4b The guest water species, however, can be reintroduced into the porous sample of 3 by exposure to water vapor for 10 h, which is confirmed by XRPD (Figure 7), the weight gain of the sample, and elemental analyses. During this repetition, a vivid color change of this material occurs, from light blue for the original sample, to bottle green for the desolvated sample, and to light blue again for the final product. The color change, from another point of view, also proves the feature of reversible exclusion and inclusion of the guest molecules of 3. For 4, TGA reveals the CH3OH molecules are eliminated from the network on raising the temperature from room temperature to ca. 90 °C (a weight loss of 7.20% is a little smaller than the calculated value, 9.23%, probably resulting from the sensitivity to temperature and humidity or a very slow liberation of the guest molecules from 4 at room temperature), corresponding to the loss of CH3OH molecules. The decomposition of the framework begins only above ca. 280 °C. Upon evacuation of the freshly ground sample of 4 at 160 °C for 6 h, it experiences weight losses that are consistent with the removal of 1.5 included CH3OH mol- ecules per formula unit, which is also confirmed by elemental analyses. To our surprise, though the dried solid [CdL1- (NCS)2]n still gives a sharp XPRD pattern, this pattern is not coincident with that of the original sample. Thus, we conclude that the structure of the dried empty solid is changed, but its structural regularity is maintained after the removal of the guest molecules. Notably, the desolvated sample of 4 can regain CH3OH molecules and interestingly revert to the original structure by exposure to CH3OH vapor for 2 h, which is also confirmed by XRPD (Figure 8), the weight gain of the sample, and elemental analyses. The above results demonstrate two potentially different microporous materials: 3 represents one type of complex, which has rigid vacant channels after the removal of the guest molecules, and the structure of the empty sample coincides with that of the original material; 4 represents another type of framework which has the property that removal of guest molecules makes a structural change in the network, how- ever, it can revert to the original structure by reintroducing the guest molecules. The desolvated solids of 3 and 4 may be applied as adsorbents of some small guest molecules. Magnetic Properties. For complex 1, the susceptibility curve (Figure 9a) shows a round maximum at 270-280 K, indicating a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling. At very low temperature, there is a clear increase of the øM values, indicating a small percentage of monomeric CuII impurities. The temperature dependent on the øMT (per two CuII ions) is also indicative of this strong antiferromagnetic coupling: it starts at 0.43 cm3 mol-1 K (much more lower than the value of two noncoupling CuII ions, 0.80 cm3 mol-1 K) and tends to zero from 50 to 2 K (Figure 9a).

Coordination Polymers from Dipyridyl Ligands Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 43, No. 3, 2004 941 The large antiferromagnetic coupling observed in this compound is in agreement with those observed in the large family of tetra-µ-carboxylato-O,O′-dicopper(II) complexes, where the most common value observed is about -300 cm-1.12 The presence of the small percentage of impurities avoids the possible calculation of the coupling between the long organic ligands which should give a very small (almost nil) coupling. The very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between tetra- µ-carboxylato-O,O′-dicopper(II) unit can also be manifested by the ESR spectra at different temperatures. At room temperature, the pattern of the S ) 1 excited state (populated at this temperature) is very indicative and can be related to the strength of the coupling, as indicated by several publica- tions.13 For J values close to -300 cm-1, the D parameters is close to 0.5 cm-1 and gz can be very high, such as 2.5. For complex 1, the ESR spectrum at room temperature together with its simulation is shown in Figure 9b. The best simulation gives the following values: D ) 0.47 cm-1; E ) 0 cm-1; gx ) gy ) 2.12 and gz ) 2.55 (isotropic bandwidth ) 300 G). The band which appears in the region of 3000 G in the experimental spectrum is due to the |0, -1> (ground-excited state) and from the impurities of monomeric CuII ions. Effectively, by lowering the temper- ature to 4 K, only this band centered at 3000 G remains, with all other bands disappearing, which indicates the depopulation of the excited S ) 1 state, due to the strong coupling, as indicated above. The magnetic properties of complexes 2 and 3 are very similar, almost identical. As a representative example, øMT (øM is the molar magnetic susceptibility for one CuII ion) and reduced magnetization, M/Nâ, (inset) plots for complex 2 are shown in Figure 10. The value of øMT at 300 K is 0.41 cm3mol-1K, which is as expected for magnetically quasi-isolated spin doublets (g > 2.00). øMT values are almost constant to 50 K and below 50 K decrease quickly to 0.20 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K. The global feature is (12) Dalai, S.; Mukherjee, P. S.; Zangrando, E.; Lloret, F.; Chaudhuri, N. R. J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans. 2002, 822 and references therein.

Huang et al. 942 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 43, No. 3, 2004 characteristic of very weak antiferromagnetic interactions. The reduced molar magnetization plot versus H of complex 2 at 2 K (Figure 10 inset) clearly corroborates that the antiferromagnetic coupling is very small. The M/Nâ value at 5 T is close to 1 Nâ, and the curve follows the Brillouin law, assuming g ) 2.11. Complexes 2 and 3 are magnetically one-dimensional systems with very long Cu‚‚‚Cu distances (14.784 Å for 2 and 14.704 Å for 3), due to the organic bridge that links the CuII centers. This feature gives uniform S ) 1/2 systems with J coupling parameter for the Cu-bridge-Cu pathway. The fit of the magnetic data has been carried out with the Clumag program,14 modeling the input with 12 cycled CuII atoms, which is the typical number taken in these cases of CuII, as it approaches an infinite number. The best-fit parameters obtained with this computing model are J ) -1.6 ( 0.1 cm-1, g ) 2.10 ( 0.01, and R ) 1.2 × 10-5 for 2 and J ) -1.7 ( 0.1 cm-1, g ) 2.12 ( 0.01, and R ) 1.6 × 10-5 for 3. The coincidence between the two J values agrees with the existence of the same bridge in complexes 2 and 3. The only “noninnocent” difference between 2 and 3 is the terminal ligand: nitrate for 2, which links two chains through the O4 atom of the nitrate group, but with Cu1-O4 distances at 2.651(2) Å in apical-equatorial positions, and sulfate for 3, which gives a three-dimensional structure with Cu1-O3 and Cu1-O4 distances at 2.625(1) and 2.396(3) Å, respec- tively, in axial-equatorial position (see structural details). The small J values can be interpreted, thus, as a consequence of the almost nil overlap between the CuII ions through the long ligands and through the packing between the one- dimensional entities in the corresponding nets. For the two CuII complexes 2 and 3, the Cu‚‚‚Cu distances are almost the same, and the torsion angle between the two pyridyl rings is small (7.3° for 2 and 6.7° for 3). The CuII ion is placed almost perpendicular to the π system, avoiding any possible magnetic pathway. Thus, the magnetic coupling should be very small, as experimentally found. The magnetic properties of complexes 5 and 6 in the form of øMT versus T plots (øΜ is the molar magnetic susceptibility for one CoII ion) and M/Nâ vs H at 2 K (inset) are shown in Figure 11a,b, respectively. øMT values at 300 K are 3.18 cm3 mol-1 K for 5 and 3.48 cm3 mol-1 K for 6, which are larger than that expected for the spin-only case (øMT ) 1.87 cm3 mol-1 K, S ) 3/2), indicating that an important orbital contribution is involved. The øMT values continuously decrease from room temperature to 0.91 cm3 mol-1 K at 2 K for 5 and to 0.79 cm3 mol-1 K for 6. The reduced molar magnetization (M/Nâ) per CoII attends to 2.3 Nâ for 5 and 6. The Co‚‚‚Co distance in complex 5 is 15.022 Å, and the torsion angle between the two pyridyl rings is 23.6°, which avoids any delocalized π-pathway between the CoII ions. In complex 6, the ligand is different concerning the position of the two N-donor atoms, the Co‚‚‚Co distance is 11.559 Å, but the torsion angle between the pyridyl rings is 38.7°. Thus, even if the Co‚‚‚Co distance is lower than that in 5, the torsion angle is greater, avoiding also the possible π-π delocalized pathway. As a consequence of these structural features, the possible magnetic pathways in 5 and 6 are almost nonexistent, and thus, the magnetic coupling must be almost nil. A quantitative interpretation of the magnetic data is not straightforward because of the orbital degeneracy of octa- hedral CoII. As indicated by Antolini et al.,15 in the noncoupled CoII complexes, the small temperature depen- dence of øMT down to ca. 100 K rules out any possibility of (14) CLUMAG Program: Gatteschi, D.; Pardi, L.

The observed decrease of øMT at lower temperature can be attributed to the thermal depopulation of the excited Kramer’s doublets originated by spin-orbit and low sym- metry splitting of 4T1g of the CoII ion. Considering the complicated structures for 5 and 6, and the spin-orbit coupling in the CoII atoms, any attempts to fit the øMT data will be unsuccessful.16-18 Assuming, thus, that the antiferromagnetic coupling inside and between the layers are very small, an attempt has been made to fit the øMT results with the magnetic formula for a mononuclear CoII complex, calculating the λ value (spin-orbit coupling parameter) and the A parameter (A ) 1.5 in the limit of the small field), and assuming J ) 0 cm-1, as did by Miller et al. in similar noncoupled complexes.17 Applying the formula given by Mabbs16 and Miller,17 the best fit parameters are λ ) -134 cm-1 and A ) 1.30 for 5, and λ ) -131 cm-1 and A ) 1.45 for 6. The λ parameters are close to that expected for an isolated CoII ion (-175 cm-1). The difference indicates the effect of the covalence and the geometrical distortions with regard to regular octahedral CoII complexes. The lack of total coincidence in the shape of these curves (Figure 11) indicates either some amount of weak magnetic coupling or slightly distorted octahedral geometry in cobalt ions, with is consistent with the crystal structure. It is also possible to apply another different approach: the degeneracy of the 4T1g ground state of the octahedral CoII ion is removed by the action of axial and rhombic distortions of the crystal field, as well as by spin-orbit coupling. The overall effect of low-symmetry crystal field components and spin-orbit coupling produces up to six Kramer’s doublets and results in an strongly anisotropic doublet ground state. Thus, at low temperature (<30 K), CoII systems may be described as having an effective spin of S ) 1/2 with large anisotropy. As a consequence, the assumption of axial J (Jx ) Jy, Jz) and gCo (gx ) gy, gz) must be used.19 With this hypothesis in mind and assuming that J ) 0, we have carried out a full diagonalization calculation of the magnetization data, considering axial anisotropy of g.20 The best fit values are as follows: g| ) 5.8 and g⊥) 2.4 for 5 and g| ) 5.5 and g⊥) 2.8 for 6 (see Figures 11a,b, inset). These g values perfectly agree with those reported in the literature for axially distorted CoII systems.21 Conclusion Six new CuII, CdII, and CoII coordination polymers based on the organic ligands 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole (L1) and 2,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (L3) have been prepared and structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. In all these polymers, the ligand takes the bidentate bridging mode when binding to the metal center, and the oxadiazole or thiadiazole nitrogen donors are not involved in the coordination. The interesting porous natures of two 3-D networks 3 and 4 have been investigated by TGA and XPRD techniques. The results demonstrate the framework is retained for complex 3, and for 4, the framework is changed but remains regular, after the removal of the guest molecules. Both complexes 3 and 4 may be used to generate new porous materials. A very strong antiferromagnetic coupling is involved in the [Cu2(OAc)4] dimeric unit of 1, and for the other complexes, very weak antiferromagnetic interactions are found due to the long distances of the L1 ligands which bridge the CuII or CoII ions. The coordination chemistry of other type of angular oxadiazole or thiadiazole- containing building blocks is under way in our lab. Acknowledgment.
