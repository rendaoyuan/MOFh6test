Except for two 2D-layer coordination polymers 3 and 4, the rest samples exhibit 3D metal−organic frameworks with certain pore sizes, especially MOFs 1 and 5. Spectroscopic and crystallographic investigations demonstrate that the absorption and emission energies of the BODIPY chromophores are sensitive to the coordination modes. Moreover, in case 2, the transition metal centers coordinated with the dicarboxylate ligands L2−are capable of forming the two BODIPY units in coplanar arrangements (θ = 37.9°), simultaneously suppressing the uncommon J-dimer absorption band centered at 705 nm with a long tail into the near-infrared region at room temperature. On the other hand, in comparison with the ligand H2L, the emission of monomer-like BODIPY in case 3 is enhanced in the solid state by a considerably long distance between the parallel BODIPY planes (about 14.0 Å). ■INTRODUCTION During the past decade, metal−organic frameworks (MOFs), also called porous coordination polymers (PCPs), made by reticular synthesis with polytopic organic struts and inorganic nodes, have constituted an attractively versatile platform for achieving long-range organization and order.1,2 Because of their easily tailored structures and exploitable properties, MOFs have been one hot subject of research in the eyes of many chemists and material scientists, which have aroused them with great enthusiasm in diﬀerent areas.3−5 In particular, the multifunc- tional nature of these systems was used to explore the applications in light-emitting devices,6 light-harvester,7 non- linear optics,8 photoinduced hydrogen production,4e,9 chemical sensor,10 and biomedicine11 by combining optical properties with several other properties,3a,12 such as microporosity, molecule and ion sensing, and catalysis. 4,4-Diﬂuoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY), one kind of brilliant small molecule dye,13 shows distinctly charming photophysical properties that include strong visible absorption, relatively sharp ﬂuorescence with eﬃcient quantum yield, relative insensitiveness to environment pH or polarity, and reasonable stability to physiological conditions.14 In addition, the packing of such a dye in aggregated solid states may be engineered to facilitate the formation of J-type aggregates (head-to-tail), which exhibit large bathochromic shifts in absorption spectra relative to the monomers.15 Signiﬁcantly, because small modiﬁcations of their structures enable tuning their photophysical features, BODIPY-derived materials have been widely employed as useful tools for many diﬀerent applications.16,17 Accordingly, the attachment of BODIPY units to a transition metal center is also highly attractive, most of which are complex molecule examples.18−22 Recently, Nitschke and co-workers have synthesized a series of emissive metallo-supramolecular cages by incorporating BODIPY ﬂuorophores.20 Despite the intriguing properties, the chemistry of BODIPY-derived coordination polymers has remained relatively unexplored. In 2011, Hupp and co-workers ﬁrst reported two BODIPY-derived MOFs (BOB and BOP), which are capable of harvesting light across the entire visible spectrum by strut-to-strut energy transfer.21 As followed, another two photoluminescent MOFs were obtained based on a BODIPY-derived bipyridine ligand.22 Since such ﬁeld is at an early stage of development, we are very interested in constructing new BODIPY-derived MOFs and exploring the relationship between photophysical properties and the structures in order to get a series of multifunctional materials Received: September 14, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/IC © XXXX American Chemical Society A DOI: 10.1021/ic502219y Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX with potential applications in optoelectronics, light-harvesting, etc. Herein, by employing 2,6-dicarboxyl-BODIPY ligand H2L as a chromophore linker, ﬁve coordination polymers {[Zn2(L)2(bpp)]·2H2O·2EtOH}n (1), {[Cd2(L)2(bpp)]· 2H2O·EtOH}n (2), {[Cd2(L)(bpe)3(NO3)2]·2H2O·DMF· EtOH}n (3), {[Cd(L)(bpe)0.5(DMF)(H2O)]}n (4), and {[Cd- (L)(bpe)0.5]·1.5H2O·DMF}n (5) (bpp =1,3-bi(4-pyridyl)- propane, bpe = 1,2-bi(4-pyridyl)ethane) have been formulated by changing the metal ions and auxiliary pyridine ligands. Except for two 2D-layer coordination polymers 3 and 4, the rest of the samples exhibit 3D MOFs with certain pore sizes, especially MOFs 1 and 5. Spectroscopic investigations demonstrate that in case 2, the uncommon J-dimer absorption band is observed at λmax = 705 nm with a long tail into the near- infrared (NIR) region at room temperature. On the other hand, in comparison with the ligand H2L, the emission of monomer- liked BODIPY in case 3 is enhanced more than twice in the solid state. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials. All chemical reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further puriﬁcation, unless otherwise indicated. Ligand H2L was synthesized by the procedure in Scheme 1. Physical Measurements. 1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were measured on a Varian inﬁnity-plas spectrometer with TMS as the internal standard. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-ALPHA spectrophotometer using dry KBr disks in the range of 4000−400 cm−1. Elemental analyses for carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen were carried out on a FLASH EA 1112 analyzer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were implemented on a Netzsch STA 449C thermal analyzer, and the samples were heated at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under the air atmosphere. The room-temperature powder X-ray diﬀraction spectra were performed on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diﬀractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation. UV−vis absorption spectra in the solid state were measured from 200 to 1100 nm by a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with a 110 nm diameter integrating sphere. The measurements of steady-state emission spectra in the solid state were conducted on a Hitachi 850 ﬂuorescence spectropho- tometer at room temperature. The quantum yield of sample emission in the solid state was detected with an absolute photoluminescence quantum yield measurement system (C11347-11, Hamamatsu Photonics) under excitation at 450 nm at room temperature. The gas sorption isotherms of coordination polymers 1 and 5 were collected on a Micromeritics 3Flex surface area and pore size analyzer under ultrahigh vacuum in a clean system, with a diaphragm and turbo pumping system. Ultrahigh-purity-grade (>99.999%) N2 gas was applied in all adsorption measurements. The experimental temperature was maintained by liquid nitrogen (77 K). Prior to measurement, to remove the solvent molecules, the bulk samples of complexes 1 and 5 were soaked in acetone for 2 days with the solvent refreshed every 12 h and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Moreover, supercritical CO2 (SC−CO2) activation also was used to remove the solvent molecules in sample 1 by a custom-built system. Typically, a bulk sample of complex 1 was washed by absolute ethanol (EtOH) three times, dried under a vacuum, and then transferred into a stainless steel column. After 20 min of soaking and venting of supercritical CO2 by a DB-80 simplex pump, the column pressure regulator was set at 100 bar by soaking SC−CO2, and the column temperature was raised to 55 °C. SC−CO2 in the column was gradually vented after 14 h. The activation samples were placed in sealed containers for nitrogen adsorption. TGA experiments and powder X-ray diﬀraction were carried out to make sure that the solvent molecules were removed completely and the framework structures retained crystallinity after activation, respectively. Syntheses. tert-Butyl 2-Hydroximino-3-oxobutyrate (8). tert- Butyl 3-oxobutanoate (6, 40 mL, 241 mmol) was dissolved in acetic acid (80 mL) in a round-bottomed ﬂask, and the mixture was cooled in an ice bath to about 10 °C. Sodium nitrite (18 g, 261 mmol) was added over 1 h while the temperature was kept under 15 °C. The cold bath was removed, and the mixture was allowed to stir for 3.5 h at room temperature to give a crude solution of 8 which was used in the next step without further puriﬁcation. 3, 5-Dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-2, 4-dicarboxylic Acid 2-tert-Butyl Ester 4-Benzyl Ester (9).

At this temperature, the crude 8 precipitated slowly. The temperature was then increased to 75 °C for 1 h, and then the Scheme 1.

Crystal Data Collection and Reﬁnement. Single crystal X-ray diﬀraction analyses of complexes 1 and 2 were carried out on a SuperNova diﬀractometer with graphite monochromated Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) at 100(2) K, whereas the data of complexes 3−5 were collected on a Rigaku Saturn 724 CCD diﬀractometer with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 20 ± 1 °C. The empirical absorption corrections were applied by the multiscan program. The crystal data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization eﬀects. The structures were solved by direct methods and then reﬁned for non- hydrogen atoms by full-matrix least-squares techniques on the basis of F2 using the SHELXL-97 program.24 There were large solvent accessible pore volumes in complexes 1, 2, and 5, occupied by highly disorded solvent molecules as well as those of complex 3. No satisfactory disorder model could be achieved, and therefore the SQUEEZE program implemented in PLATON was used to remove these electron densities. The numbers of guest molecules for 1, 2, 3, and 5 were calculated by the TGA and elemental analysis data. Crystallographic processing parameter and selected bond lengths and bond angles for 1−5 are listed in Tables S1 and S2 (in the Supporting Information), respectively. Crystallographic data for 1−5 have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre with CCDC reference numbers 1023699−1023703. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthetic Aspect. As we know, the luminescence was often ascribed to the π-conjugated organic linker in many MOFs, such as dicarboxylate-containing species. Because of the excellent luminescent property of the BODIPY-based dicarbox- ylic acid H2L in solution,23 it would be a novel platform to construct functional high-dimensional coordination com- pounds. As shown in Scheme 1, the chromophore linker, H2L was synthesized by a simpliﬁed procedure compared to the reported literature.23 At ﬁrst, screening for simple and cheap precursor 6 as the starting material, intermediate product 9 was synthesized by the fast one-step cyclization reaction with very high yield. Subsequently, complex 10 was obtained by 1 h elimination reaction. Signiﬁcantly, in comparison with the reported procedure,23 this synthetic process was not only with higher yield but also needed much less reaction time and softer chemical condition. Crystal Structure and Characterization. Five coordina- tion polymers 1−5 were successfully obtained by the solvothermal reactions with the chromophore linker H2L, metal salts (M(NO3)2, M = Zn/Cd) and auxiliary pyridine ligands (bpp and bpe) in DMF and HNO3 in ethanol media, respectively. Single crystal X-ray diﬀraction analyses present all the structures of coordination polymers 1−5, which are further conﬁrmed by the powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), elemental analyses, and infrared (IR) spectroscopy experiments. In case 1, the single crystal X-ray diﬀraction pattern demonstrates a 3D pillared-layer framework, which belongs to the monoclinic system with C2/c space group. As shown in Figures 1a and S1, two adjacent Zn ions, bridged by the carboxylate groups of BODIPY-based ligands, form a paddle- wheel type secondary building unit (SBU)−[Zn2(COO)4] with Zn−Zn distance about 3.0 Å, which is connected by four BODIPY-based dicarboxylic acid groups and further extended into a 2D sheet-like layer. At the same time, these 2D layers are pillared by the bpp linkers along the c axis to give rise to a 3D pillared-layer porous framework with pore sizes of ∼14.8 × 14.8 Å2, while the structure induces 2-fold interpenetration of the framework which reduces the void space with pore sizes of Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/ic502219y Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX C ∼11.5 × 11.5 Å2. Therefore, MOF 1 can be represented as a 6- connected 2-fold interpenetration topology, and the point symbol for the net is 412·63. A PXRD experiment for case 1 also has been carried out to check its phase purity. As shown in Figure S2, the peak positions of the experimental PXRD spectrum match well with that of th esimulated one, indicating that the crystal structure is truly representative of the bulk sample. The diﬀerences in intensity may be due to the preferred orientation of the crystal products. In addition, application of the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON suggests that a void volume is 35% in the total cell. These channels are occupied by H2O and EtOH, which are conﬁrmed by elemental analysis and TGA. Furthermore, a TGA experiment was performed under air atmosphere to check the thermal stability of MOF 1 (Figure S3). For instance, it successively lost weight of 10.05% (calcd 10.03%) in the range of 30−277 °C due to one lattice water molecule and one EtOH molecule, which also implies the porosity. Over 277 °C, the framework of sample 1 was unstable and decomposed gradually. Thus, gas sorption measurement for the as-synthesized sample 1 after acetone exchange was conducted up to a relative pressure (p/p0) of 1.0 on the activated frameworks at STP. N2 adsorption isotherm demonstrates that MOF 1 exhibits a small gas adsorption value of 18 cm3/g with a Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface area of 27 m2/g (Figure S4). This result may be attributed to the change from crystalline phase to amorphous phase of MOF 1, on account of the broadening, or even disappearing of some peaks in the PXRD spectrum (Figure S2).22 Furthermore, the ﬂowing SC−CO2 activation also has been used to avoid collapse during volatile solvent evacuation.28 After SC−CO2 activation, as shown in Figure S4, the N2 adsorption isotherm of MOF 1 illustrates the BET surface area of 257 m2/g with the gas adsorption value of 121 cm3/g. Surprisingly, by the same solvothermal method except changing metal salts into Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, coordination polymer 2 features a totally diﬀerent 3D framework, which can be simpliﬁed into a 8-connected topology with the point symbol 424·64 (Figures 1b and S5). Two carboxylic groups of BODIPY-based ligands both adopt μ2-η2:η1-chelate/bridge coordination fashions, which link Cd(II) ions to provide a tetranuclear SBU−[Cd4(CO2)8]. Each tetranuclear SBU is surrounded by eight L2−units and further furnish a complicated 3D MOF, while the bpp ligand just plays a role in connecting Cd(II) ions from two adjacent SBUs to add the linking numbers of the tetranuclear SBUs. Hence, a void volume of 22% in the total cell was indicated by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON. In case 2, the experimental PXRD data also displayed that the crystal structure was totally representative of the bulk sample (Figure S6). Moreover, TGA experiment showed that coordination polymer 2 lost two lattice water molecules and one EtOH molecule (obsd 6.05%, calcd 6.19%, Figure S7) when the temperature was raised from 30 to 254 °C. In addition, the resultant structure was stable up to 306 °C and ﬁnally decomposed to CdO. In consideration of interpenetration in MOF 1, we tried to reduce the ﬂexibility of pyridine ligand to construct 3D MOF probably containing larger porosity. Surprisingly, when the bpe linker was used instead of the bpp group, two 2D-layer coordination polymers 3 and 4 were obtained by the similar solvothermal method (Figure 2a,b). For coordination polymer 3, as shown in Figures S8 and 2a, the bpe groups connect Cd(II) ions to form a 1D ladder-shape chain, and subsequently, linked by BODIPY-based dicarboxylic acids in chelated coordination modes, the chains are extended into a 2D wave- like layer. Complex 3 illustrated very high phase purity detected by the PXRD experiment (Figure S9). In contrast, while the volume ratio of reaction solvent DMF/EtOH was turned into 1:1, the two carboxylic groups of ligand L2−adopt μ1-η1:η1 and μ1-η0:η1 coordination modes in complex 4 (Figures S10 and 2b), respectively, which provide a 1D inﬁnite chain by linking Cd(II) ions. Interestingly, bridged by the bpe groups, the 1D chains further form a graphene-like 2D layer. In each hexagonal circle unit of such 2D layer, six Cd(II) ions are like the “C atoms”, which are linked by four BODIPY-based dicarboxylic acids and two bpe moieties. The experimental PXRD data also exhibited that the crystal structure of complex 4 was totally representative of the bulk sample (Figure S11). As shown in Figure S7, from 90 to 230 °C, complex 3 lost two lattice water molecules, one EtOH and one DMF (obsd 10.50%, calcd 10.58%) and became unstable beyond 260 °C. In comparison with that of case 3, the thermal stability of coordination polymer 4 was better, which lost one coordinated water molecule and one coordinated DMF molecule in the scale of 90−330 °C (obsd 12.60%, calcd 12.91%), and above 330 °C, complex 4 decomposed continuously until 800 °C. Ultimately, under the same solvothermal reaction condition except for raising the reaction temperature to 100 °C, a 3D pillared-layer framework 5 was successfully synthesized, which was the isoreticular framework of complex 1 deliberated by the crystallographic analysis (Figure 2c). For instance, ligands L2− chelate Cd1 ion and symmertry-related Cd1A ion to form a [Cd2(CO2)4] binuclear SBU with Cd−Cd distance about 3.04 Å, which further gives rise to a 2D layer (Figure S12).

Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/ic502219y Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX D Furthermore, the 2D networks are sustained by the bpe moieties along the c direction to generate a pillared-layer 3D framework. Structural topology analysis reveals that 412·63 is the point symbol for this net. As a result of 2-fold interpenetration with real pore sizes of ∼11.3 × 11.3 Å2, calculation by using PLATON suggests the guest accessible void comprises 40% of the total cell volume. Although complexes 1 and 5 are isoreticular, the distances of two adjacent binuclear SBUs bridged by pyridine ligands bpp or bpe in complexes 1 and 5 are 16.0286 and 16.675 Å, respectively, which may be attributed to diﬀerences of the pillar molecules (bpp for complex 1 and bpe for complex 5) and metal nodes (Zn for complex 1 and Cd for complex 5). As shown in Figure S13, because the data of the experimental PXRD spectrum is consistent with that of simulated one, the crystal structure of 5 completely expressed the bulk sample. For MOF 5, a weight loss of 14.33% in 20− 245 °C range was consistent with the removal of one DMF and one and a half lattice water molecules (calcd 14.00%, Figure S14), and the dehydrated compound was stable to 308 °C. To consider the results of crystallographic analysis and TGA measurement, 1D channels with considerable void spaces are present in MOF 5. As shown in Figure S15, sample 5 shows a type-I behavior in N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K, which indicates a gas uptake of 60 cm3/g with the BET surface area of 138 m2/g. Photophysical Properties. Before the detailed spectro- scopic investigations of the coordination polymers 1−5, macroscopic images of 1−5 under natural light and 365 nm UV irradiation would roughly manifest some photophysics information. As shown in inset images of Figure 3, case 2 exhibits the much deeper color comparing to the rest of the as- synthesized samples and red ligand H2L (Figure S16), indicating that the energy of S0 →S1 transition in 2 is probably lower than those of the rest of the samples (1, 3, 4, and 5) and ligand H2L. On the other hand, under irradiation of 365 nm UV light, all the samples show orange or red photoluminescence with the naked eyes. In this work, the UV−vis absorption spectra of ligand H2L, bpe, bpp, and the coordination polymers 1−5 were recorded in the solid state at room temperature (Table 1, Figure S17). As depicted in Figure 4a, ligand H2L exhibits several intense absorption bands in the range of 210−570 nm. At the same time, careful inspection of the spectrum on the low-energy side reveals a small peak in the region of 600−800 nm. This could indicate a weak transition centered at around 651 nm (15 360 cm−1) within the tail. The intense absorption band is at λmax = 562 nm (17795 cm−1), which is ascribed to the π →π* transition of the monomer-like BODIPY group, while the weak band in lower energy range is possibly the transition of J- aggregates based on dipole−dipole interaction in the aggregate.23,25 Furthermore, the lowest energy absorption band of ligand bpp or bpe is at λ < 285 nm (35090 cm−1, Figure S17), which is distinctly higher than that of ligand H2L in the energy level. As a result, the BODIPY group of ligand H2L will play a key role as the chromophore after being coordinated with the Zn(II)/Cd(II) metal ions. Remarkably, compared to that of ligand H2L, the π →π* transition of the monomer-like BODIPY group is visibly blue- shifted in each of the samples 1−5 (Table 1, 1: 535 nm, 2: 539 nm, 3: 524 nm, 4: 540 nm, and 5: 537 nm), which might result from the increasing electron-withdrawing character of carbox- ylate groups at the 2,6-positions by being coordinated with the transition metal ions.23 In addition, in comparison with the inferred transition of powder sample H2L in lower energy level, the relative intensity are enhanced in the coordination polymers except for sample 3. Especially in case 2, such absorption band grows into a strong shoulder peak centered at 705 nm (14 185 cm−1) with a long tail into the near-infrared (NIR) region. However, in case 3, such estimated dimer transition disappeared as shown in Figure 4a. As we know, BODIPY groups in J aggregates are arranged in a head-to-tail direction or coplanar displacements with θ < 54.7°. Only the transition to the lowest excited state is allowed, which is characterized by a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum compared to the monomer.26 As exhibited in Figure 5a, the BODIPY moieties in complex 2 can be arranged in coplanar displace- ments with θ = 37.9°, and the center distance between the BODIPYs is about 5.7 Å measured by the crystallographic Figure 3.

Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/ic502219y Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX E analysis. Hence, in case 2, such absorption band centered at 705 nm is clearly assigned by the transition of J-dimer based on dipole−dipole interaction. Furthermore, to prove the hypothesis for the evidence in absorption spectroscopic measurement, some information was observed in the luminescence studies of the ligand H2L and as- synthesized coordination polymers 1−5. The room temper- ature emission spectra of the ligand H2L and samples 1−5 in the solid state are shown in Figure 4b. Upon excitation at λ > 590 nm, ligand H2L has no emission observed, although such S0 →S1 transition would result in a potential luminescence in the NIR, as the associated long radiative lifetime of the corresponding emission is easily quenched by the surrounding environment in solid state or suﬀered by the self-quenching due to the high concentration. Interestingly, upon excitation at 450 nm, it exhibited an emission at λmax = 577 nm (17330 cm−1) at room temperature with a small absolute quantum yield of 0.0073. Moreover, due to the small Stokes shift of 465 cm−1 (Table 1), this ﬂuorescence is derived from the 1ππ* excited state of the monomer-like BODIPY group in nature. Similar to ligand H2L, there are also no emissions in the spectra of complexes 1, 2, 4, and 5 upon excitation at 600 nm. In contrast, upon excitation at λ > 430 nm, complexes 1−5 still display the emissions assigned to the 1ππ* excited state of BODIPY group (1: 577 nm, 2: 602 nm, 3: 574 nm, 4: 596 nm, and 5: 573 nm), although in cases 2 and 4, the emission bands are distinctly red-shifted. As shown in Table 1, the quite large Stokes shifts in complexes 1−5 (1170−1942 cm−1) comparing to the ligand H2L suggest a geometrical rearrangement between the ground and excited states,27 which may be explained by the inﬂuence of the coordinated transition metal ions. Signiﬁcantly, the emission quantum yield is increased more than twice in complex 3 (ϕF = 0.017). This result is in accordance with the absorption study, which is further proved by the partial packing diagrams of the BODIPY units in 3 (Figure 5b). Herein, the BODIPY units in complex 3 adopt parallel arrangements of the transition dipoles with the slip angle of θ = 84°, and the measured distance between the BODIPY-planes is about 14.0 Å. In such rigid frameworks, the BODIPY moieties could not be allowed to form the dimers and also the concentration quenching of ﬂuorescent dyes was hindered by the considerably long distance between the BODIPY-planes in the solid state. Normally, the emission of monomer-liked BODIPY in case 3 will be enhanced. ■CONCLUSIONS As a consequence, by using BODIPY-based dicarboxylic acid H2L as a chromophore linker, ﬁve coordination polymers 1−5 were successfully obtained by the solvothermal reactions with moderate-to-good yields in this work. By the metal center Cd(II) instead of Zn(II), the 3D pillared-layer framework 1 was replaced by a more compact coordination polymer 2, which featured a totally diﬀerent 3D framework with the point symbol 424·64. As the bpe linker instead of the bpp group reduces the ﬂexibility of pyridine ligand, two unanticipated 2D-layer coordination polymers 3 and 4 were obtained, whereas 3D pillared-layer framework 5 was prepared with larger porosity by raising the reaction temperature at 100 °C. The combination of spectroscopic investigation and crystallographic analysis dem- onstrates that the absorption band of J-dimer can be observed at λmax = 705 nm in the solid state since the BODIPY moieties in complex 2 are arranged in coplanar displacements with θ = 37.9°. Furthermore, in comparison with the ligand H2L, the emission of monomer-liked BODIPY in case 3 was enhanced in the solid state, because the BODIPY moieties could not be allowed to form the dimers, and also the concentration quenching of ﬂuorescent dyes was hindered by considerably long distance between the parallel BODIPY-planes. These results imply that, due to this BODIPY-based dicarboxylic acid H2L as the novel chromophore linker, our study opens up interest in this new platform to construct excellently luminescent BODIPY-derived MOFs for exploring applications in optoelectronics and light-harvesting. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Details of crystal structures, TGA, and PXRD experiments of 1−5, the gas sorption measurements of 1 and 5, the macroscopic image of H2L and the diﬀuse-reﬂectance UV−vis Figure 4.

Crystal Structure of {[Zn2(L)2(bpp)]·2H2O·2EtOH} (1). According to X-ray diffraction analysis, structure 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic system with C2/c space group and features a 3D pillared-layer framework. In the asymmetric unit, there exists one independent Zn(II) ion, one L2- ligand, half a bpp ligand, one lattice water molecule and one EtOH molecule. As shown in Figure S1, Zn (II) ion is residing in a square pyramidal geometry, five-coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four different µ2-η1:η1-bridge carboxylates composing the equatorial plane and one nitrogen atom from the bpp ligand at the apical positions [Zn−O=2.020−2.062 Å, Zn−N=2.054 Å, which are all in conformity with the common bond lengths in reported works 1]. Two adjacent Zn ions, bridged by carboxylate groups of L2- ligands, form a paddle-wheel type secondary building unit (SBU)-[Zn2(COO)4] with Zn−Zn distance about 3.0 Å. Each SBU is connected by four L2- ligands a b c d and further extended into a 2D sheet-like layer. The 2D layers are pillared by bpp linkers along c axis to give rise to a 3D pillared-layer porous framework with pore sizes of 14.8 × 14.8Å2. The structure induces 2-fold interpenetration in the framework which reduces the void space with pore sizes of ~11.5 × 11.5Å2. Application of the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON suggests the presence of a void volume of 35% of the total cell volume. These channels are occupied by H2O and EtOH, which are confirmed by elemental analysis and TGA. Structural topology analysis reveals that the [Zn2(COO)4] SBUs can be considered as a 6-connected nodes and the L2- ligands and bpp ligands can be viewed as linkers. Therefore, complex 1 can be represented as a 6-connected 2-fold interpenetration topology and the point symbol for the net is 412·63. Figure S2.

Crystal Structure of {[Cd2(L)2(bpp)]·2H2O·EtOH} (2). The results of crystallographic a c b d analysis reveal that complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system P21/c and features a 3D MOF structure. The asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically independent Cd(II) ions, two L2- ligands, one bpp ligand as well as two lattice water and one EtOH molecules. Cd1 and Cd2 are all in distorted pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometries. We describe Cd1 ion in detail, which is anchored by six oxygen atoms from four different µ2-η2:η1-chelate/bridge carboxylates and one nitrogen atom from one bpp ligand (Figure S5). Cd−O distances range from 2.251−2.505 Å, and Cd−N bonds are 2.317 and 2.321 Å, which are fairly similar to the bonds in other cadmium compounds.2 Two carboxylic groups of L2- ligand both adopt µ2-η2:η1 coordination fashions, which link Cd ions to provide a tetranuclear SBU [Cd4(CO2)8]. Each tetranuclear SBU is surrounded by eight L2- ligands and further furnish a complicated 3D MOF. The bpp ligands play a part in connecting Cd ions from two adjacent SBUs, which just add the linking numbers of the tetranuclear SBUs. PLATON suggests the presence of a void volume of 22% of the total cell volume. To better understand the nature of the 3D MOF, topology analysis is exhibited: L2- and bpp ligands can be regarded as linkers, and the tetranuclear SBU [Cd4(CO2)8] can be regarded as 8-connected node. The whole 3D MOF can be simplified into an 8-connected topology with the point symbol 424·64. Figure S6. The simulated (black) and experimental (red) PXRD patterns for complex 2. Figure S7.

Crystal structure determination confirms that 3 crystallizes in the triclinic system with a space group of P-1.The asymmetric unit contains two independent Cd2+ ions, one L2- ligand, three bpe ligands, two coordinated NO3- ions and guests. The guests contain two water molecules, one DMF molecule and one ethanol molecule, which are confirmed by elemental analysis and TGA. As depicted in Figure S8 and 2a, Cd1 is ligated by two oxygen atoms from L2-, two oxygen atoms from NO3- and three nitrogen atoms from bpe ligands displaying a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination sphere. Cd2 are in the same coordination environment with Cd1. Cd−O=2.305−2.557Å, Cd−N=2.313−2.384Å, which are all in the normal range.2 The bpe ligands connect Cd ions to give rise to a 1D ladder-shape chain. Linked by L2- in chelated coordination mode, the 1D chains are extended to a 2D wave-like layer. Figure S9. The simulated (black) and experimental (red) PXRD patterns for complex 3. Figure S10.

The crystal structure determination reveals that complex 4 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system P21/c. The asymmetric unit contains one crystallographically independent Cd ion, one L2- ligand, half a bpe ligand, one associated water molecule, as well as one coordinated DMF. The Cd ion displays distorted octahedral coordination geometry, anchored by four oxygen atoms from two L2- ligands and one DMF at equatorial position, and one O atom of the coordinated water molecule and one N atom from one bpe ligand at the axial position. The two carboxylic groups of L2- ligand adopt µ1-η1:η1 and µ1-η0:η1 coordination modes, respectively, which connect Cd ions to provide a 1D infinite chain. Interestingly, bridged by the bpe groups, the 1D chains are further extended into a graphene-like 2D layer. In each hexagonal circle unit of such 2D layer, six Cd(II) ions are like the “C atoms”, which are linked by four BODIPY-based dicarboxylic acids and two bpe moieties (Figure S10 and 2b). Figure S11.

Crystal Structure of {[Cd(L)(bpe)0.5]·1.5H2O·DMF}n (5). The result of crystallographic analysis shows that structure 5 is isoreticular framework of compound 2. As shown in Figure S12, a b c d the asymmetric unit of 5 contains one crystallographically unique Cd(II) ion, one L2- ligand, half a bpe ligand, one and a half lattice water molecules and one DMF. Cd ion is surrounded by four oxygens atoms (O1A, O2, O3B, O4C) from four L2- ligands and one nitrogen atom (N1) from bpa ligand, displaying a distorted square pyramidal sphere. The Cd−O bond lengths fall in the range of 2.196−2.283 Å, while Cd−N bond length is 2.261 Å. L2- ligands chelate Cd1 ion and symmertry-related Cd1A ion to form a [Cd2(CO2)4] binuclear SBU with Cd…Cd distance about 3.0362Å and further extend into a 2D layer. Furthermore, the 2D networks are sustained by the bpe moieties along c direction to generate a pillared-layer 3D framework. As a result of 2-fold interpenetration with real pore sizes of ~11.3 × 11.3Å2, calculation using PLATON suggests the guest accessible viod comprises 40% of the total cell volume. Structural topology analysis reveals that the point symbol for the net is 412·63. Figure S13.
