The metal ion and ligand functionalization modulate their sorption properties, making these materials suitable for gas storage and separation purposes. The optimization of the adsorption properties of porous solids is a present day challenge, boosted by industrial and environmental applications of selective gas storage, separa- tion, and catalysis.1,2 One of the most interesting classes of porous materials comprises the open metal-organic frame- works (MOFs).3 These kinds of materials are extremely promising for H2 storage applications and, although very high mass percent storage capacities (up to 3.8%) have been recently reported,4 the usual low density of MOFs results in a low storage capacity on a volume basis, which should be subject to improvement by employing new synthetic strate- gies. Besides, the formation of MOFs involves a self- assembly process of metal fragments and organic spacers, which is facilitated by the use of labile metal ions [i.e., first- row, divalent transition-metal ions, Cu(I), Ag(I), Zn(II), and Cd(II)]. Pd(II) possesses an intermediate robustness, which makes it adequate for the obtention of stable discrete polynuclear systems with cavities and voids ready for molecular recognition and catalytic processes.5 However, to the best of our knowledge, this metal ion has not yet been employed for the construction of crystalline porous coordina- tion polymers. We have recently reported the preparation, solid-liquid sorption, and structural properties of neutral and flexible 3D, sodalite-type coordination polymers of the [CuL2]n formula, with L ) 2-pyrimidinolate (2-pymo)6 or 4-pyrimidinolate (4-pymo).7 We have found that their overall structural features are nearly independent of the position of the exocyclic oxygen atom, but we have also shown that the shape, size, hydrophilicity, and ion-pair affinity of their cavities are highly affected. In this Communication, we report the base-promoted polymerization of [PdCl2(2-Hpymo)2] (1), leading to a novel, 3D microporous sodalitic network, [Pd(2-pymo)2]n (2) (Fig- ure 1), which is thermally stable up to 330 °C in air.8 We also discuss the solid-gas adsorption properties of 2 and of its congeners, namely, [Cu(2-pymo)2]n (3)6 and [Cu(4- * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The structural features of the precursor 1, of the hydrated polymer [Pd(2-pymo)2]n‚2nH2O (2‚H2O), and of the anhy- drous [Pd(2-pymo)2]n form of the latter (2) have been disclosed by ab initio X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) methods.9 As expected, 1 consists of discrete square-planar trans-[PdCl2(2-Hpymo)2] complexes (with N-monodentate 2-Hpymo ligands). At variance, both 2‚H2O and 2 are characterized by undistorted 3D, sodalite-type frameworks, built upon Pd(II) centers connected through N,N′-exobidentate 2-pymo bridges, which define three different structural motives, namely, planar molecular hexagons, metallacalix[4]arenes, and metallacalix[6]arenes (Figure 1). The three different structural motives interlock each other to build a 3D open framework of the sodalite zeotype (Figure 1D). The local coordination of the Pd(II) ions is, as expected, square-planar, even in the hydrated phase 2‚H2O, where the shortest Pd‚‚‚O contacts fall well above 5.0 Å. At variance, short(er) “apical” bonds of the Cu‚‚‚O type [2.76(3) Å] were observed in the hydrated 4‚H2O phase, which results in a concomitant increase of ∼100 °C for the dehydration temperature.7 The porous framework of 2 is defined by the sodalitic â cages (Figure 1D), with an interior diameter of ca. 9 Å, interconnected by hexagonal windows. It should be noted that there are two kinds of hexagonal windows: one narrower (pore opening 4.8 Å) and hydrophilic (Figure 1C) and the other wider (8.8 Å) and hydrophobic (Figure 1A). Calcula- tions with SMILE10 show that, in the evacuated species 2, the available volume for the inclusion is ca. 1800 Å3 per unit cell, i.e. 42% of the crystal volume (see Table 1). To evaluate the permanent porosity of the open frame- works 2-4 and to estimate their possible use in catalysis and for gas separation or storage application purposes, we have studied the sorption isotherms of H2, N2, and CO at 77 K and of CO2 at 293 K (see Figures 2 and 3).11 The N2 and CO isotherms are of type I and reversible in all cases, except 3 (see note ref 12 and Table 1), indicative of materials with pores in the nanometer range. Indeed, density functional theory (DFT)13 and Horvath-Kawazoe analysis14 of the N2 isotherms for 2 and 3 account for adsorption taking place in very narrow pores (<11 Å width), in agreement with the (9) Crystal data for 1: C8H8Cl2N4O2Pd, fw 369.49 g mol-1, triclinic, P1h, a ) 7.2254(3) Å, b ) 8.5025(2) Å, c ) 5.5925(2) Å, R ) 97.876- (2)°, â ) 110.901(2)°, γ ) 109.065(2)°, V ) 290.58(2) Å3, Z ) 1, F ) 2.111 g cm-3, T ) 20 °C, Rwp ) 0.143, Rp ) 0.109, RB ) 0.040.

COMMUNICATION 2398 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 45, No. 6, 2006 values obtained for the sodalitic â cages by our crystal structure analysis (ca. 9 Å; see above). The results are also in agreement with strong adsorbate-adsorbent interactions, with the micropores being filled by N2 and CO guest molecules at very low pressures. In addition, 2 and 3 show a relatively high capacity for CO2 storage, viz. ca. 3 and 1.5 CO2 molecules per â cage,15 respectively, at room temper- ature and low relative pressures (Figure 3). 2 and 3 also show fully reversible type I H2 sorption isotherms, indicative of the filling of the micropores only. It is worth noting that the two species possess a relevant capacity of H2 storage at 77 K and 900 Torr: ca. 1.3% and 0.86% weight percentage, i.e., 11.6 and 6.6 H2 molecules per â cage, respectively. This results in high storage volumetric densities, viz., 0.018 kg of H2/L for 2 and 0.013 kg of H2/L for 3. Thus, 2 overcomes the highest known values observed for MOF-type materials at similar experi- mental conditions, namely, 0.017 kg of H2/L for MOF-505 [Cu2(bptc)],4b which shows the maximum known value of H2 weight percentage uptake (2.47% at 77 K and 760 Torr). Another implication of the gas sorption performances of 2 and 3 is the relative surface coverage of H2 molecules16 (83 and 94%, respectively), which are among the highest known values, i.e., Mn(HCOO)2 (150%),17 Cu3[Co(CN)6]2 (94%),18 [Cu2(bptc)] (52%),4b zeolite HSSZ-1319 (76%), and highly activated porous carbon materials (38%).1b The steep slope of the hydrogen sorption isotherms of 2 and 3 in the low- pressure range is also indicative of the strong interaction of the hydrogen molecules with the pore walls. It is noteworthy that 2, based on the heavier Pd, outperforms the behavior of 3 and 4, thanks to the significantly longer M-N bonds in 2, leading to a higher pore surface (see below and Table 1). It is also interesting to note that the much steeper slope of the N2/CO isotherms than the H2 ones in the low-pressure range clearly points to a N2/CO selectivity of 2 and 3 over H2. In addition, it should be noted that 3 and 4, although sharing nearly equal cell parameters and empty volumes, have different sorption performances. Indeed, they mainly differ in the distinct decoration of the metallacalix[6]arene motives: in 3, the internal surface of these pores is covered by hydrogen atoms, while some of them (one out of three) are substituted by oxygen atoms in 4. Presumably, the oxygen atoms in 4, pointing away from the Cu atoms into the open cavities, hinder the diffusion of adsorbate molecules through the pores, thus accounting for the dramatic lowering of its affinity for guest molecules. Another interesting feature of 3 is the marked effect of the activation temperature on its adsorption selectivity. Thus, activation at 105 °C results in no measurable N2 uptake and significant, although slow, sorption of H2 (0.33 wt %) (Figure 2). This effect can be explained by the presence of a few residual water molecules in the host MOF, hindering the diffusion of large guests (N2) but allowing smaller molecules (like H2) to permeate. From the analysis of the unit cell volumes of the hydrated and anhydrous species (see Table 1), a structural interpreta- tion of the sorption behavior can be derived. Indeed, (i) given the actual site symmetry of the metal ions, the size of the unit cell strictly depends on the M-N bond distances, which control the X-pymo-bridged M‚‚‚M contacts (i.e., the edges of the sodalitic framework): longer M-N values [e.g., for Pd(II)] thus cooperatiVely result in a much larger empty volume and higher surface area (as observed in 2); (ii) the copper species 3 and 4 (reversibly) deflate (by as much as 430 Å3 per unit cell, or 11%) to their evacuated analogues upon loss of water molecules because Cu-N bonds shrink with the lowering of the Cu(II) coordination number in the anhydrous phase;7 (iii) such an effect is not observed on passing from 2‚H2O to 2, probably because the low tendency of Pd(II) ions to coordination numbers higher than 4 forces the water molecules to cluster in the sodalitic cages.20 As far as the sorption of hydrogen is concerned, the performance of 2 closely approaches those of the best MOFs reported up to date3a,4 on a volume basis. This is related to the empty volume actually available for inclusion and to the stability of the framework. In light of possible practical applications, another remark- able feature of 2 and 3 is the reversibility of their sorption isotherms; moreover, their ability for adsorption of molecules other than H2 (i.e., H2O, CO, and CO2) should also be emphasized because the removal of small amounts of contaminant gases from H2 is still an open challenge for the real use of hydrogen as a fuel.21 Acknowledgment.

IC060049R (12) The irreversibility of the N2 isotherm for 3 in the microporous region can be related to a probable structural phase change taking place upon guest uptake.6 On the other hand, the N2 and CO isotherms of 2-4 show interparticle gas condensation at pressures close to the saturation point, which should be related to the small particle size (a few hundred angstroms) of these microcrystalline materials.

Diffraction data (CuKα, λ = 1.5418 Å) were collected on a θ:θ Bruker AXS D8 diffractometer equipped with primary and secondary Soller slits (2.3°), divergence, antiscatter and receiving slits (0.5°, 0.5° and 0.2 mm, respectively), secondary beam curved graphite monochromator, Na(Tl)I scintillation detector and pulse height amplifier discrimination. The generator was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Nominal resolution for the present set-up is 0.07° 2θ (FWHM of the α1 component) as measured from the Si(111) peak at 28.44° (2θ). Long step-scans with ∆2θ = 0.02° were performed overnight in the 5 < 2θ < 105° range. Indexing by TREOR901; space group assignments by systematic absences and, if applicable, isostructural evidence; the probable space groups were later confirmed by successful structure solution and refinement. Whole profile structure solutions using simulated annealing2 were performed with TOPAS 2.0 suite of programs3. 2-pymo ligands were treated as rigid bodies, assigning them average literature bond distances and angles. Convergence to a chemically significant model was supported by imposing soft restraints on the independent Pd-N bond distances. The final refinements were performed by the Rietveld method using TOPAS, maintaining the rigid body and soft restraints described above (statistically significant standard deviations for fractional atomic coordinates are thus not available). Peak shapes were described by the fundamental parameters approach4. The experimental background was fit by a polynomial description. Systematic errors were modelled with a sample-displacement angular shift; metal atoms were given a refinable, isotropic displacement parameter (BM), while lighter atoms were assigned a common B = BM + 2.0 Å2 value. Scattering factors, corrected for real and imaginary anomalous dispersion terms, were taken from the internal library of TOPAS.
