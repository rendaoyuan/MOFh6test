Fluorescence studies reveal that both 1 and TBAPy display strong emission bands at 471 and 529 nm, respectively, upon excitation at 390 nm, with framework coordination of the TBAPy ligands signiﬁcantly increasing the emission lifetime from 0.089 to 0.110 ms. Upon desolvation, the emission band for the framework is shifted to lower energy: however, upon re-exposure to DMF the as-made material is regenerated with reversible ﬂuorescence behavior. Together with the lifetime, the emission intensity is strongly enhanced by spatial separation of the optically active ligand molecules within the MOF structure and is found to be dependent on the amount and chemical nature of the guest species in the pores. The quantum yield of the material is found to be 6.7% and, coupled with the ﬂuorescence lifetime on the millisecond time scale, begins to approach the values observed for Eu(III)-cryptate-derived commercial sensors. Introduction Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted consider- able attention for their large pore volumes accessible through the porous network topologies resulting from the binding of multidentate ligands to metal centers.1 The ability to chemically modify the ligand either pre- or postsynthesis,2 combined with the potential for open metal sites,3 allows the generation of catalytic centers4 and speciﬁc interactions with tailored internal surfaces for applications such as drug delivery5 and provides exceptional ﬁgures of merit for “standard” porous materials applications such as gas storage.6 The combination of porosity with other properties7 allows the generation of guest-responsive multifunctional materials from MOFs; however, a combination of signiﬁcant stable porosity and intense ﬂuorescence in these materials is relatively uncommon. Fluorescent MOFs8 are of great interest for potential applications as sensors for small molecules,9 for their use as light-emitting diodes,10 and in medical diagnostics and cell biology.11 MOF ﬂuorescence can be centered on the organic linking group of the framework, particularly if this is highly conjugated, and may be assigned to pure intraligand emission,12 ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT),13 or metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT).14 Emission can also be metal-based, usually involving the incorporation of a rare-earth element into the coordination framework,15 where emission can be enhanced if the organic linker itself functions as an antenna.16 Guest molecules can also confer ﬂuorescent properties onto MOFs, including through exciplex formation. To date, detailed studies on porous ﬂuorescent MOFs17 have revealed the inﬂuence of (1) (a) Ferey, G. Dalton Trans 2009, 4400. (b) Kitagawa, S.; Kitaura, R.; Noro, S. Angew. Chem., Int.

SOC. 2010, 132, 4119–4130 9 4119 the network topology on the ﬂuorescence of conformationally ﬂexible stilbene-based MOFs,18 whose emission can be irrevers- ibly modiﬁed upon guest removal, and shown that guests can control ﬂuorescence wavelengths. More weakly emitting 4,4′,4′′- nitrilotris(benzoic acid)-based materials can have their guest- sensitive emissions tuned by the presence or absence of π-π interactions in desolvated and solvated materials.19 Such studies now present the opportunity to exploit framework-forming ligands based on cores speciﬁcally selected for their desirable optical properties, in particular strong and long-lived emission, that are functionalized to generate large accessible pore volumes. This is an important step in order to design ﬂuorescent materials with the required lifetimes and quantum yields for viable sensing devices.20 In this paper we report a new tetracarboxylate ligand, TBAPy, based on the optically active and strongly ﬂuorescent pyrene core as illustrated in Scheme 1, which is functionalized in the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 8-positions with benzoate fragments. (E)-Stilbene and pyrene are attractive molecules, due to their use as optical brighteners, dyes, or dye precursors. We have chosen the pyrene core as a linker, as its lifetime and quantum yield (τ ) 113 ns,21 φ ) 0.6522 in EtOH at 293 K) are much higher than those of (E)-stilbene (τ ) 1.7 ns,23 φ ) 0.02 in acetonitrile24), and In(III) as the inorganic component to form coordination-based reticular structures with spatially separated pyrene-derived TBAPy ﬂuorophore ligands. Indium has previously been used to prepare topologically diverse MOFs from small carboxylate- based ligands,25 which have been investigated for hydrogen storage,6d ion exchange,26 and catalysis.27 It was anticipated that the combination of ﬂuorophore separation in the solid state and the [Kr]4d10 conﬁguration of In(III) would limit destructive nonradiative pathways to yield highly emissive permanently porous framework structures. The reaction of In3+ and TBAPy in acidic solution gives a three-dimensional noninterpenetrated porous and strongly ﬂuo- rescent framework. The speciﬁc geometry derived from the ligand and metal ion connectivity affords signiﬁcant permanent porosity and modulates the ligand-ligand interactions respon- sible for the optical response. The ﬂuorescent behavior of the framework reversibly responds to the precise nature of the guests (of a range of shapes and sizes permitted by the window and pore sizes) through the position, intensity, and lifetime of the emission. Moreover, the quantum yield and microsecond lifetime of the framework are comparable to those of Eu(III) cryptate based commercial sensors.28 Experimental Section General Information. Reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without further puriﬁca- tion. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were obtained using a Thermo EA1112 Flash CHNS-O Analyzer. X-ray powder diffrac- tion data were collected in transmission geometry using a STOE Stadi-P diffractometer with Cu KR radiation at 298 K, except in the case of toluene-loaded 1′, for which the data were collected at station I11 of the Diamond Synchrotron, U.K., at a wavelength of 0.82633 Å.

Single-crystal diffraction data were collected at station 9.8 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source at Daresbury Laboratory, which has a Bruker-Nonius APEXII CCD area detector and D8 diffractometer at an X-ray wavelength of 0.6939 Å. Data were collected at 150 K. The reﬂection data were integrated using the APEX II software program.29 The data were corrected for absorption, decay, and other systematic errors using SADABS V2008-1.30 The structure was solved (by direct methods) and reﬁned using SHELX-97.31 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The experiment was performed under an O2 atmosphere on a Seiko S-II instrument. A dried crystalline sample was heated at a rate of 5 °C/min up to 650 °C and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/min. Gas Sorption Measurements. The gas (N2 and H2) isotherms of 1 were measured using an Intelligent Gravimetric Analyzer (IGA) from Hiden. The sample was washed with DMF and dried in a desiccator under vacuum overnight. The nitrogen and hydrogen isotherm measurements were performed at 77 K, to a pressure of 1 bar and up to 20 bar, respectively. Solid-State NMR. All solid-state NMR experiments were conducted at 9.4 T using a Bruker DSX-400 spectrometer operating at 100.61 and 400.13 MHz for 13C and 1H, respectively. All chemical shifts are quoted in ppm from external TMS standard. 1H-13C CP/MAS NMR spectra were acquired at an MAS rate of 10.0 kHz. The 1H π/2 pulse length was 3.1 µs and a recycle delay of 20 s was used during acquisition. Two-phase pulse modulation (TPPM) decoupling was used during acquisition. 1H-13C variable contact time (VCT) CP/MAS NMR spectra were acquired using contact times in the range of 0.02-12.0 ms. The 13C{1H} MAS NMR spectra were measured at an MAS rate of 10.0 kHz using TPPM decoupling. The 13C π/3 pulse was 2.6 µs. The spectra were measured using a recycle delay of 30.0 s. Ultraviolet/Visible Spectroscopy. UV/visible absorbance was collected in the solid state at room temperature on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 650S UV/vis spectrometer equipped with Labsphere integrating over the spectral range 190-900 nm using BaSO4 reﬂectance standards. The spectra for 1, 1′, and TBAPy were collected by dispersing the same amount of solid in a solid-state holder; the holder for 1′ was ﬁlled in the drybox. Fluorescence Measurements, Quantum Yield, and Lifetime. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were collected at room temperature on a Perkin-Elmer LS 55 ﬂuorescence spectrometer. Excitation and emission spectra were collected in the range between 200-600 and 400-700 nm, respectively, with a scan speed of 10 nm/min, and the slits were set at 5.0 (excitation slit) and 6.0 (emission slit). The ﬂuorescence quantum yield for 1 was deter- mined in the solid state according to published procedures.32 Fluorescence lifetimes were measured using a single ﬂash with a delay of 0.15 ms and gate time of 0.45 ms. Lifetime data were ﬁt using a ﬁrst-order single expotential with a good quality of ﬁt based on the reduced 2 statistics. Results Synthesis and Crystal Structure Determination of 1. The reaction of 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-benzoic acid)pyrene (TBAPy) with In(NO3)3·9H2O in an acidic DMF/dioxane/H2O (2/1/1) solvent mixture in a sealed vessel at 85 °C yields pale yellow X-ray- quality single crystals of the ﬂuorescent three-dimensional framework [In2(OH)2(TBAPy)]·(guests) (1). The preparation of 1 is extremely sensitive to synthetic conditions: in order to preclude the formation of an In(OH)3 impurity phase, for example, 1 is prepared for 12 h only. At higher temperatures and longer reaction times, phase-pure samples of 1 are not accessible. The mineralizing agent HCl is required for high yields and crystallinity, and the presence of dioxane aids the solubility of the reactants. While the dioxane does not directly inﬂuence the synthesis of 1, the presence of DMF in the solvent mixture is critical: an exploration of the synthesis of 1 in a range of solvents and solvent mixtures reveals that 1 is only formed in the presence of controlled amounts of DMF, since in pure DMF the TBAPy ligand is recrystallized unreacted. Framework 1 is based on inﬁnite chains of octahedral InO4(OH)2 units (Figure 1a), where each In(III) is bound to four TBAPy ligands and two µ2 trans hydroxide anions (Figure 1b). This is a common coordination motif for M(III) (where M ) In, Fe, Cr, Al)33 with carboxylate ligands and has previously been reported for In frameworks derived from naphthalenetet- racarboxylate34 and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate.25a The InO4(OH)2 chains in 1 are aligned parallel to the crystallographic b axis, with the hydroxide and TBAPy carboxylate groups alternating on either side of the chain backbone related by the 21 screw axis of the Cmmm space group. The four carboxylate-derived oxygens from the TBAPy ligands form an approximate equatorial square plane around the octahedrally coordinated In (Figure 1b), with a mean In-Ocarboxylate distance of 2.152(2) Å. The hydroxide bridges (29) APEX II; Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI, 2005. (30) SADABS Version 2008-2; Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI, 2007. (31) Sheldrick, G. M.

SOC. 9 VOL. 132, NO. 12, 2010 4121 A Fluorescent 3D Microporous Metal-Organic Framework ARTI CLES thus occupy the axial sites, with a slightly shorter mean In-O distance (average 2.056(0) Å) and a bridging In-OH-In angle of 119.90°. The observed In-O distances and the In-OH-In angle are typical for this coordination motif.25a,33-35 The InO4(OH)2 octahedra are corner-shared through the bridging µ2-OH and are further linked through the TBAPy ligands. The chains are decorated by the TBAPy ligands, which link four of them to form the observed three-dimensional open- framework structure 1 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Each TBAPy ligand is coordinated to eight adjacent indium atoms (Figure 1c), such that each of the benzoate groups at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 8-positions of the pyrene core are bound in a bidentate bridging fashion. The benzoate groups themselves are almost orthogonal to the pyrene core with dihedral angles of -104.16 and 74.51°. This perpendicular arrangement of the benzyl substituents arises from the need to prevent steric clashes between the phenyl H atoms in positions 3 or 5 and the pyrene core H atoms in positions 2 and 7, a common arrangement in solid-state structures of 1,3,6,8-tetrabenzyl-substituted pyrenes.36 The square-grid arrangement of the pyrene cores viewed along [010] arises because each In center binds four TBAPy ligands. The pyrene cores of the TBAPy ligands are eclipsed along [010] and are separated by 7.120(1) Å (Figure 1d), partially enforced by the alternate arrangement of bridging µ2-OH and ligand carboxylate groups along the length of the InO4(OH)2 chains. Framework 1 is a binodal network of stoichiometry (6-c)2(8- c), since each In(III) is a six-coordinate node (4 × ligands, 2 × µ2-OH) and each TBAPy is an eight-coordinate node (8 × In) (Figure S2). Topological analysis of 1 using the TOPOS4.0 software package37 designates this material as a sea network, using the three-letter notation of O’Keefe.38 The topology of 1 is comparable with that of other In-based MOFs constructed from tetracarboxylate ligands: e.g., MIL60 and MIL122.25a,34 The orientation of the TBAPy ligands around the indium atoms affords an open three-dimensional channel stucture, which can be accessed via all three crystallographic axes. Along [100] access to the porous network is through windows of 5.96 × 2.89 Å (including van der Waals radii). Along [010], however, TBAPy bridging of In centers via the ligand benzoate fragments forms two distinct channels, as shown in Figure 1e, due to the anisotropy of the phenyl substituents on the pyrene unit: the 1-8 separation (5.58 Å) is greater than the 1-3 separation (2.41 Å). The window dimensions for the smaller channel are 4.93 × 9.83 Å and for the larger one are 8.96 × 6.82 Å (see Figure 1e). Along [001] there is only one channel type with window dimensions of 4.84 × 3.72 Å (Figure 1d,f). Despite the large size of the TBAPy ligand, 1 forms a single network that is not interpenetrated, as observed for several MOFs with similarly sized organic linking groups.39 This is most likely to do with the rigid nature of the pyrene core. The solvent-accessible volume of 1 determined using PLATON is 54%.40 The large channels in as-made 1 are occupied by crystallographically ill- deﬁned solvent species.

This corresponds to three molecules of DMF and four molecules of H2O (calculated 180 electrons), which is in excellent agreement with the analytical formula and thermo- gravimetric analysis for bulk phases of 1. Bulk Characterization and Thermal Stability of 1. The phase purity and thermal stability of bulk 1 is conﬁrmed from powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. Fitting the PXRD data of 1 according to the Le Bail method yields reﬁned cell parameters a ) 30.8894(9) Å, b ) 7.1883(2) Å, c ) 15.9833(4) Å, and R )  ) γ ) 90° with excellent ﬁt indicators (Rwp ) 4.58%, 2 ) 1.56) (Figure 2), consistent with those obtained from the single-crystal structure determination (a ) 30.748(18) Å, b ) 7.120(4) Å, c ) 15.932(9) Å at 150 K). 1 is thermally stable to loss of the guest solvent molecules up to 380 °C (Figure S3), yielding the desolvated phase 1′. Complete desolvation of 1 can also be achieved by outgassing the sample overnight at 150 °C under vacuum using a standard laboratory Schlenk line. While the desolvated material has the same [In2(OH)2(TBAPy)] framework stoichiometry as 1 (conﬁrmed by elemental analysis; see the Supporting Information), it is clear from PXRD data that there is a structural change and loss of crystallinity upon guest loss. Despite this, the main framework peaks are observed for 1′, although broadened, with the appearance of additional (broad) peaks at 2θ ≈9.2 and 9.9°. The PXRD proﬁle of 1′ can be indexed with a primitive monoclinic cell (a′ ) 21.540(2) Å, b′ ) 31.972(3) Å, c′ ) 15.626(1) Å, ′ ) 128.66(1)°, V′ ) 8403(1) Å3, P2) (Figure S4) related to a monoclinic distortion of the as-made material (a′ ≈3b, b′ ≈a, c′ ≈c). The desolvated lattice parameters and lowering of symmetry are a clear indication of a loss of structural equivalence on removal of solvent from 1. The structural change on going from 1 to 1′ was probed further using solid-state NMR methods, which have previously been shown to be a powerful tool for investigating diamagnetic MOF structures.19 The 1H-13C CP/MAS NMR spectra and peak assignments of as-made 1 and desolvated 1′ are shown in Figure 3. The spectra of 1 show resonances corresponding to the framework and to encapsulated DMF solvent, all of which display signiﬁcantly enhanced intensity in the corresponding 13C{1H} MAS NMR spectra (Figure S5). The assignment of the framework resonances is entirely consistent with the expected intensities of the lines and 1H-13C CP kinetic experiments (Figure 3). The latter clearly distinguish between H-bearing and quaternary aromatic carbon sites, and the equivalence of the carboxyl groups in 1 is conﬁrmed by the presence of a single resonance at 173.4 ppm. The complete removal of solvent from 1 is conﬁrmed by the absence of DMF resonances in the spectrum for 1′ and the marked broadening of the signals corresponding to the TBAPy ligand. This can be attributed to rotational rearrangements of Figure 2.

The inset shows the assignment of the resonances in 1 to the carbons in the TBAPy ligand.

Importantly, two nonequivalent sites with approximately equal populations are observable for the carboxylate groups: the chemical shift of the ﬁrst is identical with that observed in 1, while the second is shifted downﬁeld to 174.6 ppm. This is indicative of changes in the binding modes of the carboxylate groups upon solvent removal and excludes the possibility of the presence of -CO2H moieties.19,41 The resonance at 145.7 ppm, corresponding to the quaternary carbon attached to the pyrene core, also broadens, showing additional features at 144.5 and 143.0 ppm most likely due to the structural nonequivalence of the benzoate groups in desolvated 1′. This splitting of the carboxylate signal and concomitant broadening of the phenyl ring resonances supports the lowering of symmetry and crystal- linity and loss of structural equivalence observed by diffraction methods. Guest-Dependent Structure of 1. Signiﬁcantly, the as-made material 1 can be fully recovered after 1′ has been immersed in fresh liquid DMF for 3 h (Figure S6) or mixtures containing DMF (viz. DMF/dioxane 1/1) but is not regenerated on exposure to the other solvents (H2O, dioxane) that are also used in the synthesis of 1 in their pure forms or small aromatic molecules such as toluene (Figure 4). This reversible structural change on exposure to DMF provides further evidence of its critical role in the formation of open-framework 1. The other guests do, however, afford materials of different structure and crystallinity. Water has the greatest effect on 1, and the structure is found to be very sensitive to the number of water molecules present within the porous network (Figure 4). When desolvated 1′ is exposed to the atmosphere, the partially rehydrated phase 1a, [In2(OH)2(TBAPy)]·1.6H2O, results due to the absorbance of moisture from the laboratory atmosphere. 1a is found to be slightly less crystalline than 1′; there are shifts in the peak positions, and some of the lower angle peaks are split with Le Bail proﬁle ﬁtting possible with the cell a ) 15.315(5) Å, b ) 16.355(3) Å, c ) 15.998(3) Å, R )  ) γ ) 90°, and Pmmm (Figure S7). The 13C{1H} MAS NMR data (Figure S5) show that 1a has a level of structural disorder similar to that of 1′. If, however, 1′ is immersed in water for 30 min, the fully rehydrated material [In2(OH)2(TBAPy)]·5.9H2O may be prepared with a much higher water loading. The PXRD of fully rehydrated 1 clearly shows a signiﬁcant loss of crystallinity compared to both 1′ and 1a (Figure S8), suggesting that increased amounts of water in the porous network lead to signiﬁcant structural disorder and distortion, with reduction in crystallinity due to the accompanying strain. This reduction in crystallinity suppresses the Bragg diffraction at high angles and frustrates attempts to reﬁne the structure. Although other guests do not re-form the as-grown structure controlled by DMF, the framework returns to high crystallinity upon addition of nonpolar dioxane or toluene to 1′ (Figure 4), and in both cases the low-angle peak has been split, with the former also exhibiting a broad low-intensity peak at 2θ ≈7.1°. There are also shifts in the positions of the other major Bragg reﬂections compared to 1, although the structural changes are less pronounced than those in the case of water discussed above. The PXRD proﬁle of 1′ loaded with dioxane can be indexed with unit cell parameters of a ) 14.332(1) Å, b ) 32.398(2) Å, c ) 9.446(3) Å, R ) 97.30(9)°,  ) 94.75(1)°, γ ) 96.60(7)°, V ) 4300(5) Å3, and P1j (Figure S9). The relationship of the cell to as-grown 1, and the difference from 1′ and 1′- toluene (see below), shows the range of guest-induced structural change possible. Elemental analysis of toluene-loaded 1′ indicates that there are 2.1 toluene molecules per In2(OH)2(TBAPy) formula unit, consistent with a maximum loading level of 2.7 based on the crystallographically derived pore volume40 and the liquid density of toluene. Indexing and initial Rietveld reﬁnement required lowering of the crystal symmetry to a related monoclinic cell of similar size to the orthorhombic cell of 1 (am′ ) 15.6281(7) Å, bm′ ) 16.1859(4) Å, cm′ ) 14.3261(5) Å,  ) 76.828(9)°, Vm′ ) 3528.5(1) Å3), using the single-crystal structure of 1 as the starting model. Analysis of the difference Fourier (Fo - Fc) map (Figure 5a, inset) shows the location of one toluene molecule with a fractional occupancy of 0.75(3) intercalated between pyrene cores stacked parallel to the [001]m direction, forming π-π interactions. Sequential Rietveld reﬁnement of the framework (Figure 5a) and difference Fourier map analysis revealed in total three discrete positions of the toluene guest molecules, accounting for 1.7(1) molecules in the formula unit. Guest molecules occupy both the large and small channels that run parallel to the [001]m direction with fractional occupancies of 0.40(3) and 0.52(3), respectively (Figure 5b,c)sthese mol- ecules are more disordered than those identiﬁed in the ﬁrst Fourier map located between the pyrene cores. In all three cases, the position of the toluene methyl side group is disordered over at least two positions, with strong residual disorder in the case of the 0.52 occupied molecule modeled with an elevated displacement parameter. For the Rietveld reﬁnement, the two para positions with higher density in the Fourier maps were speciﬁed and the occupancies split accordingly. The ﬁnal difference Fourier map indicated no further discrete peaks, indicating that the remaining solvent found analytically is disordered in the channels. It is clear from the above that the hydrogen-bonding polar guest water has a much greater effect on the structure of 1, creating more structural disorder relative to the incorporation of nonpolar molecules such as toluene and dioxane into the porous network, though the weaker interactions involving these guests are still able to distort the structure from that adopted in the presence of DMF while reducing the local disorder and resulting strain and loss of crystallinity compared to the water (41) Chandra, D.; Kasture, M.

Dubinin-Radushkevich analysis42 affords a pore volume of 0.639 cm3/g (Figures S10 and S11), which is slightly larger than that calculated from the single-crystal structure of 1 (0.600 cm3/g). This difference clearly arises from the observed structural changes between 1 and 1′ and is consistent with the strong guest dependence of the structure discussed above. Gravimetric H2 sorption data were also recorded (0-20 bar at 77 K, Figure S12) and show that the desolvated framework 1′ reversibly adsorbs 1.16 wt % at 1 bar, increasing to a total uptake of 1.83% at 20 bar. Optical Properties of 1. UV/vis Spectroscopy. The solid-state UV/vis spectra of 1, 1′, and the free TBAPy ligand were recorded under ambient conditions (Figure S13). The TBAPy ligand itself displays strong absorption bands in the UV spectral region from 200 to 500 nm, arising from the π-π* transition of the aromatic rings.43 These bands are not strongly perturbed upon its coordination to In(III); however, a blue shift of 54 nm is observed for the as-made framework 1. The absorbance of desolvated 1′ shows absorption behavior similar to that of 1; however, the absorbance maxima are now slightly red-shifted (39 nm) back toward those values observed for the free TBAPy ligand. The clear differences in the absorption spectra between 1 and 1′ must result from the structural changes observed by PXRD and NMR upon desolvation of 1. Fluorescence Study. The ﬂuorescence properties of 1, 1′, and the TBAPy ligand were also investigated in the solid state at room temperature (Figure 7), and the latter in highly dilute DMF solution (Figure S14). The excitation wavelength of 390 nm was set from the absorption maximum determined from the UV/ vis spectral data. A blue shift of 66 nm in the solid-state excitation spectrum was observed (Figure 7) upon coordination of the free TBAPy ligand into the as-made framework 1, although it is clear that metal binding does not disturb the detailed electronic structure of the UV/vis and excitation spectra, which clearly resemble that of the free TBAPy linker. The free TBAPy ligand ﬂuoresces in the solid state with an emission maximum at 529 nm, whereas TBAPy in DMF solution (8 × 10-9 M) displays a ﬁne structure emission proﬁle that is broader than in the solid state and contains two bands at 386 and 441 nm (Figure S14), blue-shifted relative to the solid-state emission. The ﬂuorescence of as-made 1 displays a strong emission band at 471 nm with a small shoulder at λmax 445 nm, which is tentatively assigned to a ﬁne-structure emission of the highly diluted free ligand in the framework. Further, the absence of an LMCT band13b,44 indicates that the observed emission of 1 is generated solely by the ligand. Upon complete desolvation of 1 to yield 1′, a 34 nm red shift of λmax, disappearance of the shoulder, and a slight decrease of the emission intensity was observed.

SOC. 9 VOL. 132, NO. 12, 2010 ARTI CLES Stylianou et al. state emission spectra to the maximum emission intensity observed for 1 indicates that the emission of 1′ is decreased by 10% but both framework structures display higher emission intensity than the free TBAPy ligand. The ﬂuorescence lifetime of 1 was determined to be τ ) 0.1100 ( 0.0027 ms (Figure S15 and Table 1), signiﬁcantly longer than those reported for other ﬂuorescent MOFs which are often on the nanosecond time scale.18,45 It is noteworthy that the lifetime of 1 is also longer than that observed for the solid-state emission of the uncoor- dinated TBAPy ligand, whereas the lifetime of 1′ is slightly shorter than that of TBAPy. This indicates that the ﬂuorescence lifetime is enhanced in the as-made framework but that a slight change in structure upon desolvation returns this to the level observed for the free ligand, even though the emission intensity of 1′ remains 2.5× higher. Quantum yield, Φf, is a measure of the emission efﬁciency of a ﬂuorochrome and is deﬁned as the number of photons emitted divided by the number of photons absorbed. The quantum yield (Figure S16) of 1 is 6.7% and is smaller than that reported for some MOFs; for example, the quantum yields reported for 2-D square grid structures based on Zn(II) and norﬂoxacin are >20%, although their ﬂuorescent lifetimes remain very short at 10-9 s.45 In the present case, however, the coupling of the modest quantum yield with a microsecond ﬂuorescence lifetime is comparable with a number of Eu(III) cryptates,46 some of which have been labeled with biomarkers and found utility as commercial sensors for the detection of biological analytes through homogeneous time-resolved ﬂuorescence (HTRF) or time-resolved ampliﬁed cryptate emission (TRACE).28 Guest-Dependent Fluorescence of 1. It is known that some ﬂuorescent MOF materials exhibiting linker-centered emission are sensitive to the presence or absence of guest solvent molecules18,47 and their exact chemical nature.19 In order to investigate the role of DMF in the formation of 1 and the time course evolution of the structural regeneration (1′ to 1 in the presence of DMF), the desolvated framework 1′ was exposed to anhydrous DMF solvent over a range of different times and emission spectra of the DMF solvates recorded. A blue shift of 19 nm is observed with respect to the emission band of 1′, for a sample exposed to DMF for 5 min only. After 3 h, however, the position of λmax (474 nm) returns to the wavelength recorded for as-made 1, clearly indicating the reversible access of DMF molecules in the cavity to regenerate the emission proﬁle of 1 within this time (Figure 8). Further, a weak shoulder at 426 nm appeared for the 5 min exposed sample and became more intense after 3 h, consistent with the ligand ﬁne-structure emission observed in as-made 1. The lifetime of the DMF-loaded samples follows the same trend as the emission intensity (Table 1), increasing from 0.0890 ( 0.0023 ms in the case of the desolvated material, 1′, to 0.1100 ( 0.0027 ms for the 3 h DMF exposed material. We have further examined the sensitivity of the emission response of 1 to the other solvents employed in the synthesis (viz. dioxane and H2O) and also to the presence of an aromatic guest molecule (toluene) (Figure 9 and Table 1). After activation, desolvated 1′ was immersed in the liquid solvents for 30 min prior to measurement (experimental details are given in the Supporting Information). Exposure of 1′ to H2O induces the largest shift of λmax (520 nm) relative to as-made 1, which is comparable to that observed for the free TBAPy ligand. Further, there is a quenching of the emission intensity to I ) 0.72 compared to the maximum emission of 1. The ﬂuorescence lifetime of this material, at 0.054 ms, is approximately 50% of that observed for as-made 1. The shift in the position of the emission band and the reduction of emission intensity and lifetime are dependent on the amount of water present in the framework, since the partially hydrated material (1a) has a λmax and lifetime similar to those of desolvated 1′, whereas the emission intensity is only 50% of that observed for the fully desolvated material and 63% of that for the hydrated phase (Table 1). Clearly the ﬂuorescence response of the framework is sensitive not only to water but also to the number of guest water molecules present within the porous network and, thus, the changes in both structure and structural order noted above. At low loadings of water (1.6 per FU) longer lifetimes are recorded but emission intensity is reduced, whereas at higher loadings (5.9 per FU) the intensity is almost restored to that observed for 1′ but the lifetime is much reduced. This is related to the differences observed in structure between the partially and fully (re)hydrated samples of 1′. Immersion of 1′ in anhydrous dioxane results in a smaller shift in λmax, to 502 nm, but induces a signiﬁcant quenching of the emission intensity (I ) 0.36), comparable to that of free TBAPy (Table 1). The ﬂuorescence lifetime of 1′ reloaded with dioxane is 0.064 ms, much lower than that determined for 1′ (0.081 ms) or the free TBAPy ligand (0.089 ms) but higher than that recorded for rehydrated 1′ (0.0540 ms). It is clear that both H2O and dioxane have a dramatically different effect on the emission of 1 when compared to each other or anhydrous DMF under the same conditions: exposing 1′ to DMF for 30 min shifts λmax by 6 nm only, and the emission intensity is almost equal to that of as-made 1, the spectrum being further character- (45) Chen, Z.

SOC. 9 VOL. 132, NO. 12, 2010 4127 A Fluorescent 3D Microporous Metal-Organic Framework ARTI CLES ized by a shoulder at 428 nm (Figure 8). It is notable that this shoulder, assigned to ligand ﬁne-structure emission, is not present when 1′ is exposed to either H2O or dioxane. As dioxane appears to have a large effect on both the lifetime and the emission intensity compared to DMF, we also investigated the immersion of 1′ in a dioxane/DMF 1/1 solvent mixture. We reasoned that in the presence of controlled amounts of DMFsas in the synthesis of 1sthe effects on the ﬂuorescence properties would be less pronounced than for dioxane alone. Indeed, after immersion of 1′ in the 1/1 DMF/dioxane mixture for 30 min, the emission proﬁle more closely resembles that observed for the sample reloaded with only DMF (for 30 min), indicating that its inﬂuence on the structure and hence ﬂuorescent characteristics of framework 1 is more far-reaching than that of any other of the solvents investigated. An aromatic solvent molecule was also loaded into 1′, to see if the emission response was affected by species that have the potential to interact directly with the highly aromatic TBAPy component of the framework through π-π interactions. Expo- sure of 1′ to toluene caused a blue shift in λmax of 19 nm (relative to 1′) and a quenching of the emission intensity by 30% of that recorded for 1 (Figure 9 and Table 1). The emission band is blue-shifted compared to the desolvated material and is no broader than in the presence of other solvents; therefore, it is unclear whether this is attributable to exciplex emission48 in the present case: this cannot be completely ruled out, however, due to the demonstrable interactions between toluene and the pyrene cores of TBAPy determined from toluene-loaded 1′ (Figure 5). Concomitant with the shift of λmax is a reduction in the ﬂuorescence lifetime from 0.1100 ms in 1 to 0.0670 ms, a value comparable to reloading 1′ with dioxane (see Table 1). Although the lifetimes for the dioxane- and toluene-loaded samples are similar, the shift of the emission band and the reduction in intensity are much less for toluene than for dioxane. This most likely indicates that these guests interact with the framework in different ways depending on their exact chemical naturessince they are of similar polarity as reﬂected in their dielectric constants of 2.21 and 2.38, respectively, for dioxane and toluenesand induce a similar structural change in 1. The toluene-loaded 1′ sample can be reactivated at 100 °C for 18 h under vacuum in a Schlenk tube and re-exposed to liquid DMF for a further 12 h. The resulting PXRD (Figure S19) conﬁrms that the slight shift of the Bragg peaks and the splitting of the low-angle peak observed in the toluene-loaded material are absent and that phase-pure 1 was recovered, as further evidenced by the maximum emission band of 470 nm, equal to λmax for 1 (Figure S20). Discussion The thermally stable open-framework structure 1 is composed of highly conjugated pyrene-derived TBAPy ﬂuorophore ligands linked into a three-dimensional network by chains of corner- sharing InO4(OH)2 octahedra. While the pyrene cores of the TBAPy organic linking groups are relatively rigid, the benzoate groups substituted at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 8-positions have a degree of rotational freedom, allowing the structure of 1 to respond to small guest molecules. The structural arrangement of the TBAPy ligands in 1 electronically isolates the optically active pyrene cores while simultaneously exposing them to the large solvent- accessible extra-framework volume (Figure 1e): coupled with the ability of the open framework to respond to changes in the composition and nature of the solvent molecules within its pore stucture, this has signiﬁcant implications for the ﬂuorescence properties of this material. The as-made framework 1 does not display any metal-ligand or ligand-metal charge transfer (MLCT and LMCT, respec- tively) bands in its ﬂuorescence emission spectra, consistent with the ﬂuorescent response of the framework being determined only (48) (a) Wagner, B.

A similar trend is observed in cubic MOFs with linker-centered emission, where organic linkers of increasing conjugation display the greatest blue shift of the emission band.18 It is the high degree of conjugation in the pyrene core of the TBAPy ligands and position of the energy levels in In(III)49 that ensures the ﬂuorescence of 1 is centered on the ligand; if less-conjugated chromophores are employed, the charge transfer to the metal is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient and LMCT bands could be observed.13b,44 The ligand-centered emission of 1 is consistent with ﬂuorescent In(III) MOFs containing 2,2′-bipyridyl ligands50 and octahedral dipyrrinato complexes of group 13 metal ions.49 Electronic interactions between polyaromatic molecules in the solid state are known to strongly control their optical properties through π-π interactions,51 which can lead to quenching of the emission intensity.52 The intensity of the lowest energy (0-0) emission peak of solid-state TBAPy at 529 nm, however, can be enhanced by a factor of 3 upon coordination in as-made framework 1. This is indicative of a signiﬁcantly decreased interaction between the pyrene cores and results from their 7.12 Å spatial separation within the three-dimensional open framework structure, a distance that precludes the speciﬁc π-π interactions that can lead to emission quenching. This effect can also be achieved by decreasing the interchromophore coupling by highly diluting a solution of the optically active centers, and indeed a 10-9 M DMF solution of TBAPy displays ﬁne structure in its emission proﬁle and is blue-shifted compared to its solid-state emission. As demonstrated, the complete desolvation of 1 to 1′ induces a 34 nm red shift of the emission band and modest quenching of the ﬂuorescence. This is consistent with increased interactions between the optically active TBAPy linkers and must be attributable to the structural rearrangements of 1 upon desol- vation, as observed by PXRD and NMR spectroscopic studies. This has previously been observed in Zn4O(NTB)2·3DEF·EtOH (where NTB ) 4,4′,4′′-nitrolotris(benzoate))19and Zn4O(SDC)3 (where SDC ) 4,4′-stilbenedicarboxylate),18 where interactions between two interpenetrated nets are enhanced upon guest solvent removal, such that desolvation allows the linkers to rotate or change conformation to increase their proximity, causing a concomitant increase in π-π interactions red-shifting the ﬂuorescence emission maxima. Although 1 is not an interpen- etrated structure, it does exhibit signiﬁcantly less long-range order on desolvation (to 1′) due to a loss of structural equivalence, particularly of the benzoate groups substituted in the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 8-positions of the pyrene core. It is unlikely that the planar pyrene cores, rigidly held in place by the chains of corner-shared InO4(OH)2 octahedra, will be able to approach sufﬁciently closely to interact with one another without an enormous structural rearrangement. While the reﬁned cell parameters of desolvated 1′ do indicate structural change and a reduction in symmetry, such a signiﬁcant rearrangement clearly does not occur. We therefore attribute the observed red shift and 10% decrease in intensity and lifetime to rotations of the benzoate groups as seen in the 13C{1H} MAS NMR data, which have the potential to increase the degree of conjugation, thus red-shifting the emission.45 Such enhancement of conjugation would be consistent with the loss of interactions with guests as a factor determining the conformation of the TBAPy ligand. The emission band of 1 is clearly sensitive to structural changes induced by rotations of the TBAPy benzoate donor groups, but it is also inﬂuenced by the presence and chemical nature of guest solvent molecules within the pores (Figure 9). This is common for MOFs with linker-centered emission, where a solvatochromic effect in the ﬂuorescence emission spectra dependent on the polarity of the included solvent molecules can occur.19 The size of the shift is dependent on the chemical nature of the guest and how this interacts with the organic linking group of the framework, which may lead to emission quenching.9c The emission response of the desolvated material 1′ to each of the solvents employed in the synthesis of the framework was examined, as was an aromatic guest molecule (toluene) that could potentially interact directly with the linker through π-π interactions. Most notably, the presence of DMF in the pores of desolvated 1′ causes the structure of as-made 1 to be regenerated, indicating that the structural change and ﬂuores- cence characteristics are fully reversible, a desirable property for the formation of sensors. The increase in lifetime of 1′, the enhancement of the intensity of the ﬂuorescence signal, and the appearance of ﬁne-structure emission upon exposure to DMF are due to the nature of the three-dimensional structure of 1 and its speciﬁc interactions with the polar DMF guest molecules. In contrast with the reversible changes in structure and ﬂuorescence behavior between 1 and 1′ upon exposure of the desolvated material to DMF, the other guest molecules examined (water, dioxane, and toluene) do not regenerate the structure nor reproduce the ﬂuorescence characteristics of as-made 1. Undoubtedly, the exact response is related to the complex interplay between the chemical nature of the solvent (e.g., polarity, aromaticity) and the extent to which this can change the structure of 1. Polar guest molecules, for example, have the greatest inﬂuence on the structure of framework 1 in comparison to nonpolar guests, as demonstrated by the loss of long-range order on exposure of 1′ to water. With respect to the emission characteristics of 1′ exposed to solvent molecules for 30 min, it appears that polar guests have the greatest effect on the ﬂuorescence lifetime with an accessible range of ∆lifetime ) 0.045 ms, in comparison with ∆lifetime ) 0.003 ms for nonpolar guests. Conversely, the nonpolar guests exert the greatest inﬂuence on the emission intensity with ∆intensity ) 0.33, wheras polar guests have ∆intensity ) 0.18. The lifetime therefore appears more sensitive to changes in structure upon adsorption of polar molecules, whereas the intensity is more sensitive to speciﬁc interactions with nonpolar guests. The latter is evidenced by our ability to locate speciﬁc guests in the toluene-loaded structure of 1′ that clearly sit between the highly conjugated pyrene cores of the framework. The exception to this is the partially hydrated sample 1a, where low levels of water do not change the lifetime signiﬁcantly but severely reduce the intensity. This may be related to speciﬁc water-binding sites in close proximity to the framework structure of 1, which are occupied at low loadings of the guest. The differences in the position of the emission maxima are attributed to a solvochro- (49) Thoi, V. S.; Stork, J. R.; Magde, D.; Cohen, S. M. Inorg. Chem. 2006, 45, 10688. (50) Tian, Z. F.; Song, T.

Reproduction of the shoulder attributed to ﬁne-structure emission of the TBAPy ligand in as-made 1 only occurs with DMF, which has the smallest effect on the structure despite its polarity. In addition to a speciﬁc role for DMF in the synthesis of 1, this suggests that the ligands are at their most dilute in the framework when DMF is present. This arrangement is disturbed due to structural changes or speciﬁc interactions with the pyrene core upon adsorption of other guests; therefore, the ﬁne-structure emission band is not observed. The reversibility of the optical behavior upon loading of DMF following desolvation to form 1′, loading, and then unloading of the toluene conﬁrms the reversible access of DMF in the pores and its essential role in the formation of the original lifetime and minimization of self- quenching. Conclusion The judicious combination of a highly ﬂuorescent pyrene- derived ligand with a d10 metal ion that is known to form networks sustained by inorganic clusters and chains6d,25a yields a highly emissive, permanently porous three-dimensional frame- work, 1, that displays good quantum yield and a millisecond ﬂuorescent lifetime. In the present case, the combination of linker-based ﬂuorescence with large robust pores and a BET surface area >1000 m2/g in a single frameworksdesirable properties previously restricted to ﬂuorescent MOFs based on lanthanoid emission16,53sallows the emission wavelength, lifetime, and intensity of 1 to be tuned for a wide variety of guest species and loadings: the resulting changes in lifetime and ﬂuorescence intensity are consistent with, respectively, the inﬂuence of the guest on the structure and the chemical nature of the guest itself. Polar aprotic DMF produces a high degree of structural order and separates the linkers to minimize self-quenching phenomena, resulting in a ﬁne-structure emission proﬁle. Removal of this guest disorders and alters the conformation of the benzoate groupssconsistent with NMR data and the observed red-shifting of the emissionsincreasing structural disorder. Although loss of DMF clearly reduces crystallinity and local order, the porosity apparent from the structure of as-grown 1 is completely retained (judged by the sorption-derived pore volume) in desolvated 1′. The hydrogen-bonding capabilities of the polar water guest confer qualitatively distinct characteristics from DMF to strongly distort the structure, possibly due to interaction with the carboxylate groups, which become inequivalent when the DMF (around which the structure forms) is removed. The structural distortions induced by the interaction with polar guests strongly affect the lifetime of the emission. Nonpolar dioxane and toluene guests both produce less distortion of the framework structure than water, but the speciﬁc π-stacking revealed by diffraction allows toluene to strongly interact with the ﬂuorescent pyrene core, reducing the emission intensity. The sensitivity of the ﬂuorescence to the aliphatic dioxane is surprising but reﬂects the role of multiple weak interactions in controlling MOF structures where there are no dominant bonds. The ligand design, with a long lifetime ﬂuorescent core in guest-controllable interactions with its surrounding benzoate groups, combines guest sensitivity due to direct interactions with the ligand itself and via guest-induced framework distortions with the capability of accessing large-pore structures such as those in the MIL and IRMOF families. The potential chemical tunability of linker-based ﬂuorescence would allow for consid- erable enhancement of the guest sensitivity observed here. Acknowledgment.

Under inert conditions, the samples were re-exposed to dry liquid solvents such as toluene, dioxane, and DMF-dioxane mixture for 30 minutes and to DMF for 5 and 30 minutes and 3 hours. Then, the liquid solvent was transfered by syringe (under inert conditions) in a round bottom flask and the loaded samples were dried under Schlenk line for about 30 minutes at room temperature. Quartz capillaries were filled with the loaded samples in the dry box and sealed with grease.

A similar method was followed for the water loaded sample and 1a and their emission spectra were also collected in capillaries. 300 400 500 600 700 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 a. u. wavelength (nm) Figure S14 : Emission spectra of TBAPy in DMF solution (8x10-9M) S14 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1 1' TBAPy Intensity (a.u) time (μs) 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1/e = 0.368 Intensity (a.u) time (μs) Figure S15 : Lifetime curves of 1 (blue), 1′ (red) and TBAPy (green).
