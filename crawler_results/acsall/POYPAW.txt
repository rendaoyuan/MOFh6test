Ni(II) complexes of dipyrrin (dpm) ligands bearing peripheral pyridyl or imidazolyl units have been shown to self-assemble into coordination polymers with the metal cation in an octahedral environment coordinated to two bis-pyrrolic chelates and two neutral monodentate coordinating units such as pyridyl or imidazolyl moieties. Taking advantage of the chelate eﬀect, the two monodentate units may be replaced by a diimine ligand leading to the disassembly of the networks by the formation of discrete soluble complexes. The latter can be employed as metallatectons for the construction of heterometallic architectures upon reaction with a secondary metal salt. This approach was applied using either 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) or 2,2′-bipyrimidine (bpm) as chelates leading to a series of mono- and binuclear metallatectons of the (phen)Ni(dpm)2 and (bpm)[Ni(dpm)2]2 type. Subsequent assembly with CdCl2 aﬀorded either interpenetrated 2D grid-type architectures or 3D MM′MOFs. ■INTRODUCTION Fueled by applications in gas storage, catalysis, sensing, and detection, the ﬁeld of coordination networks (CNs) and metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged over the past decades as an active research area.1 These architectures are constructed by association of metal centers or complexes with polytopic organic ligands. Regarding the latter, carboxylate, azole, and pyridyl derivatives as well as combinations thereof have been extensively exploited.2 Dipyrrins (dpms) represent another class of species of interest.3 These bis-pyrrolic compounds can be readily functionalized and form, under mild basic conditions, monoanionic chelates leading to a variety of metal complexes. Thus, when the dipyrrin is appended with an additional peripheral coordinating group, its association with metal centers generates metallatectons4 or metalloligands5 prone to self-assembly for the formation of CNs. Both homo- and heterometallic architectures (MOFs and mixed metal− organic frameworks, MM′MOFs, respectively) have thus been prepared.6−10 MM′MOFs obtained by reaction of a dpm based metallatecton with a second metal center, such as Ag(I) and Cd(II) salts, have been reported.6−8 On the other hand, homometallic MOFs are obtained by self-assembly of complexes incorporating a cation capable of increasing its coordination number (see Scheme 1) such as (acacR)Cu(dpm) (acacR = acetylacetonate derivatives)9 or Cd(dpm)2 and Ni(dpm)2 complexes with dipyrrin ligands bearing a pyridyl or phenylimidazolyl moiety (for example, derivatives 1−3, Scheme 2).10 In the crystalline state, the metal cation is bound not only to the chelates but also to the coordinating unit introduced at the periphery of the dpm ligand of a neighboring complex, leading to an inﬁnite network. These homometallic CNs may be converted into heterometallic ones by disassembling the inﬁnite structures via decoordination of the peripheral neutral unit into a discrete (soluble) metallatecton, and subsequent reassembling with a second metal cation (see Scheme 1). In the case of (acacR)Cu(dpm) species, the disassembly process can be directly achieved upon solubilization of the complex and subsequent addition of M′ salt leads to MM′MOFs.7 In contrast, Cd(dpm)2 and Ni(dpm)2 complexes are rather insoluble in common organic solvents preventing the synthesis of MM′MOFs.10 Since within the extended architecture the Cd(II) or Ni(II) cation, adopting an octahedral coordination geometry, is bound to two dpm as well as to two pyridyl or imidazolyl groups belonging to two consecutive complexes, it should be possible to bring these metallatectons into solution upon breaking the coordination network using a neutral chelate unit such as a diimine ligand. Indeed, owing to the chelate eﬀect, the two neutral monodentate moieties may Received: December 10, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/IC © XXXX American Chemical Society A DOI: 10.1021/ic502950k Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX be replaced by the chelating ligand, aﬀording thus discrete heteroleptic octahedral complexes bearing two peripheral binding units available for binding of a second metal center leading to MM′MOFs (see Scheme 1). To our knowledge, this strategy has not been explored so far. We report herein on the conversion of inﬁnite coordination networks based on self- assembled Ni(II)−dpm complexes into MM′MOFs using CdCl2 salts through the generation of discrete heteroleptic metallatectons of the (diimine)Ni(dpm)2 type. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Crystal Structure of the Metallatectons. Pyridyl, phenyl-pyridyl, and phenyl-imidazolyl appended dipyrrins 1−3 have been reported to form self-assembled architectures, 4−6, respectively, in the presence of Ni(II) salts (Scheme 3).10 These CNs, insoluble in most common organic solvents, were used for the formation of heteroleptic metal- latectons by reaction with a diimine ligand such as phenanthro- line or bipyrimidine. A suspension of 4−6 was thus reacted with 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) in CHCl3 leading to a complete dissolution of the solid and formation of discrete mononuclear complexes 7−9 of the (phen)Ni(dpm)2 type, in 84−96% yield. Reaction of the bis-chelating ligand 2,2′- bipyrimidine (bpm) with a suspension of MOF 6 in CHCl3 (Scheme 3) led also to the formation of discrete complex 10, a rare example of binuclear dpm based compound,11 in 51% yield. The metallatectons thus obtained were characterized by elemental analysis, single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction, and UV−vis spectroscopy. For all four compounds, two intense absorption bands between 460 and 500 nm are observed in CH2Cl2. These bands correspond to π−π* ligand centered transitions of the dpm as reported for other Ni(II) dipyrrinato complexes.12 Single-crystals of complexes 7−10 suitable for X-ray diﬀraction analysis were obtained by n-pentane or diethyl ether vapor diﬀusion into a concentrated CHCl3 or THF solution of discrete complexes (Tables 1 and 2). For mononuclear compounds 7−9, the Ni(II) cation, in an octahedral environment, is coordinated to two dpm chelates and one phen unit (Figure 1). As expected, both Δ and Λ enantiomers are present within the crystals. As reported for the self-assembled complexes 4−6 and (2,2′-bipyridine)Ru(dpm)2 complexes,10,13 the Ni−N distances are shorter with the dipyrrin chelates than with the diimine ligand (Table 1). It should be noted that, unlike what is observed for other heteroleptic species of the (acetylacetonate)Co(dpm)2 type, no distortion around the N−N hinge of the dpm is present for metallatectons 7−9.8c Binuclear complex 10, crystallizing as a solvate (Table 2), (10)(CHCl3)3, features two Ni(II) cations bridged by a bpm ligand and each coordinated to two dpm chelates with Ni−N distances similar to the ones observed for 7−9 (Figure 1).

For the preparation of heterobimetallic MM′MOFs, metallatectons 7−10 were combined with CdCl2. This salt has been chosen in light of its propensity to form coordination polymers with pyridyl and imidazolyl based ligands and complexes.14,15 In particular, we have reported that association of CdCl2 with homoleptic metallatectons of the M(dpm)2 type (M = Cu(II), Pd(II), and Zn(II)) or heteroleptic (acacR)Co(dpm)2 complexes (dpm = 1 or 2) produces a series of MM′MOFs.8 Layering a DMF or CH2Cl2 solution of 7−10 through a DMF or CH2Cl2/MeOH (1/1) buﬀer, with a MeOH solution of CdCl2, produced crystals after few days for all metallatectons used, except 9. Metallatecton 7 in DMF led to the formation of MM′MOF 11, [(7)2CdCl2](DMF)2(H2O) (Table 3). The Cd(II) cation is in an octahedral coordination environment with two apical chloride anions and four pyridyl groups of four complexes 7 in the square base. As a result, 2D grid-type networks are formed in the ab plane with Cd(II) cations separated by ca. 16.5 Å (Figure 2 left). This arrangement is reminiscent of square grids observed for [M(dpm)2]2CdCl2 MM′MOFs based on linear bridging complexes.8 However, owing to the octahedral nature of the metallatectons, the 2D sheets are not ﬂat (Figure 2, middle). The cavities present in the grids are occupied by another identical network as a result of double homointerpenetration in a parallel fashion (Figure 2, right). Within each individual grid, both Λ and Δ enantiomers of the Ni(II) complex are present. Analogous reaction starting from metallatecton 8 either in DMF or CH2Cl2 led to the formation of crystals composed of MM′MOFs 12 and 13, respectively, [(8)2CdCl2](solvent) (Table 3). Both compounds diﬀer by the nature of the solvent molecules included in the structure but feature isomorphous coordination networks. Therefore, only 12, [(8)2CdCl2](DMF)6(H2O), will be described hereafter. As observed for 11, the CdCl2 nodes are bridged by Ni(II) complexes (present as both Λ and Δ enantiomers) leading to a similar grid type arrangement, albeit expanded owing to the presence of a phenyl spacer between the dpm chelate and the peripheral pyridyl group in ligand 2. As a consequence, the Cd(II) cations within a grid motif are separated by ca. 25.5 Å (Table 1), and the cavities formed by the network are larger than in the case of 11. Triple interpenetration in a parallel fashion is observed in this case (Figure 2 right). It is interesting to note that the expansion of the network by substituting ligand 2 for 1 has already been observed in the crystal structures of the self-assembled coordination polymers 4 and 5.10a Although MM′MOFs 11−13 present diﬀerent interpenetration,16 the solvent accessible voids calculated using the PLATON software Table 2.

It should be noted that, as for 13, some solvent molecules present in the crystal are disordered, and therefore, the SQUEEZE command was applied to remove the corresponding electron density for reﬁnement of the structure.17 Here again, the Cd(II) cation is coordinated to two apical chloride anions and four imidazolyl groups belonging to four binuclear complexes, present as meso isomers. As for 11−13, [4 + 4] metallamacrocycles are formed leading to a 3D network (Figure 3) where the Cd(II) centers are separated by ca. 18.1 and 25.5 Å (Table 1). These cavities are not empty but occupied by two other networks with a triple interpenetration (Figure 3 bottom) with a 48% solvent accessible void calculated using PLATON (1.2 Å radius).17 X-ray powder diﬀraction study on 11 and 12 shows the presence of a homogeneous single crystalline phase for the diﬀerent MM′MOFs (Figure 4, top and middle).

The measurements were performed under a static applied ﬁeld of 5 kOe in the 1.8−300 K temperature range. For both compounds, the temperature dependent evolution of the χT value (Figure 5) can be ﬁt using the following spin Hamiltonian H = −J·SNi1·SNi2, thus considering noninteracting dimers within the structures. The ﬁt leads to g = 2.06(1), J = −17.6(1) cm−1, ρ = 4.1(1)% for 10 and g = 2.12(1), J = −18.2(1) cm−1, ρ = 2.1(1)% for 14 with good agreement factors (R = 4 × 10−6 and 1.8 × 10−5, respectively). (g = Landé factor, and ρ = percentage of paramagnetic impurity to account for the increase of χ at low temperature. The presence of such a paramagnetic impurity is common for antiferromagnetic binuclear compounds, and is attributed to the ﬁnite size of the crystals and to defects.) These values of antiferromagnetic coupling are in agreement with what has been reported for other bpm bridged binuclear complexes of octahedral Ni(II) cations.18 Figure 3.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX E ■CONCLUSION A strategy based on assembly−disassembly−reassembly pro- cesses for the conversion of self-assembled dipyrrin-based Ni(II) coordination networks into mixed metal−organic frameworks has been developed. In the parent homometallic architectures, the Ni(II) cations are in an octahedral environ- ment, coordinated to two bis-pyrrolic chelates and two neutral peripheral monodentate binding units of neighboring com- plexes. Taking advantage of the chelate eﬀect, a diimine ligand such as 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) or 2,2′-bipyrimidine (bpm) has been used to replace the two pyridyl or imidazolyl monodentate entities leading to the disassembly of the networks and thus to the formation of discrete and soluble complexes of the (phen)Ni(dpm)2 or (bpm)[Ni(dpm)2]2 type. The latter have been employed as metallatectons for the construction of heterometallic architectures upon reaction with CdCl2. Complex 7, incorporating a pyridyl-appended dpm, leads in the presence of CdCl2 to the formation of MM′MOF 11 displaying a 2D grid-type arrangement with double interpenetration. Interestingly, an analogous reaction using the expanded metallatecton 8 led to similar MM′MOFs, 12 and 13, with larger cavities leading to 3-fold interpenetration. The binuclear complex 10 yielded a 3D MM′MOF, 14, with large cavities, also subject to a triple interpenetration. Magnetic studies on the compounds featuring bpm-bridged Ni(II) cations indicated weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the S = 1 metal centers. Future work will focus on the extension of this strategy to other dpm complexes as well as to other self- assembled architectures such as the ones based on acetylacetonate derivatives. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Synthesis.

This formula takes into account six water molecules that have not been reﬁned in the crystal structure determination but have been removed using the SQUEEZE command. X-ray diﬀraction. Single-crystal data (Tables 2 and 3) were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD diﬀractometer with Mo Kα radiation. The structures were solved using SHELXS-97 and reﬁned by full matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELXL-97 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms.19 The hydrogen atoms were introduced at calculated positions and not reﬁned (riding model). For compounds 13 and 14, some solvent molecules present in the structures show high positional disorder. To account for the corresponding electron density, the SQUEEZE command was used.17 CCDC 1037594−1037601 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for compounds 7−14. These data can be obtained free of charge via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. Powder X-ray diﬀraction diagrams were collected at 293 K on a Bruker D8 diﬀractometer using monochromatic Cu Kα radiation with a scanning range between 4 and 40° using a scan step of 2°/mn. Magnetic Properties. Magnetic measurements on compounds 10 and 14 were performed using a Quantum Design Squid-VSM magnetometer. Data were corrected for the sample holder, and diamagnetism was estimated from Pascal constants. Magnetization measurements at diﬀerent ﬁelds at room temperature conﬁrm the absence of ferromagnetic impurities. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Crystallographic data in CIF format.
