Manuscript High Tc Ferrimagnetic Organic−Inorganic Hybrid Materials with MnII−L−MnII and MnII−NC−NbIV Linkages (L ) Pyrazine, Pyrazine-N,N′-dioxide, Bipyrimidine) Robert Podgajny,*,† Dawid Pinkowicz,† Tomasz Korzeniak,† Wojciech Nitek,† Michał Rams,‡ and Barbara Sieklucka*,† Faculty of Chemistry, Jagiellonian UniVersity, Ingardena 3, 30-060 Krako´w, Poland and M. Smoluchowski Institute of Physics, Jagiellonian UniVersity, Reymonta 4, 30-059 Krako´w, Poland Received September 14, 2007 A series of heterobimetallic, cyano-bridged 3D inorganic−organic hybrid networks with MnII−L−MnII and MnII−NC− NbIV linkages are reported. Reaction of [Mn(H2O)6]2+ with [Nb(CN)8]4- in the presence of organic linker L (pyrazine (pyz), pyrazine-N,N′-dioxide (pzdo), and 2,2′-bipyrimidine (bpym)) in H2O affords {MnII2(pz)2(H2O)4[NbIV(CN)8]}‚ pz‚3H2O (1), {MnII2(pzdo)(H2O)4[NbIV(CN)8]}‚5H2O (2), and {MnII2(bpym)(H2O)2[NbIV(CN)8]} (3), respectively. 1−3 were examined by X-ray crystallography and vibrational and magnetochemical studies. 1 is characterized by the coexistence of 3D inorganic cyano-bridged and 1D organic [Mn−(µ-pyz)]n2n+ sublattices along with the presence of monocoordinated and crystallization molecules of pyrazine. Assemblies 2 and 3 exhibit dimeric {MnII2−(µ-L)}4+ coordination motifs. The magnetic behavior of heterobimetallic 1−3 complexes is dominated by antiferromagnetic coupling between MnII and NbIV centers mediated by cyano bridges, resulting in long-range ferrimagnetic ordering with a high TC of 27 (1), 37 (2), and 50 K (3). The magneto-structural correlation leads to the conclusion that the magnitude of TC is related to the type of coordination polyhedra of [Nb(CN)8] moieties (SAPR (1), intermediate between SAPR and DD (2), and DD (3)), the relative number of cyano bridges per Mn2Nb unit, and coexistence of inorganic and organic connectivity. FC/ZFC responses appear to be sensitive to the degree of organic connectivity. The discussion of magneto-structural correlation is based on the spin-density properties of adequate heterobimetallic systems containing octacyanometalates. Introduction High-dimensional architectures of coordination compounds have received an enormous amount of attention over the last decades due to the variety of phenomena related to the magnetic interaction between metal centers through molec- ular bridges. The numerous magnetic assemblies were characterized by the transitions to/between the ordered (ferro, ferri, antiferro, including canted) magnetic structures with high Tc.1-24 The particular impact was observed for the 3D cyano-bridged Prussian blue analogues, which revealed Tc ranging from liquid helium to temperatures exceeding room temperature.1-3 The structural similarities of the Prussian blue family members allowed correlating the magnitude of Tc and type of long-range ordering in relation to the electronic configuration and spin state of the metal centers.3a This * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Use of trans-{MnL1(H2O)2}2+ and trans-{NiL2(H2O)2}2+ complexes, where L1 and L2 are four- and five-coordinative macrocyclic ligands, respectively, afforded 1D {[MnL1]2[Nb(CN)8](H2O)‚5H2O}∞and discrete {[NiL2]12[Nb(CN)8]6(H2O)6}‚100H2O assemblies.39 Both com- pounds are characterized by the alternative 1:1 arrangement of the 3d metal and niobium(IV) moieties, chain-like in the former and ring-like in the latter, with the additional [ML- (NC)(H2O)]+ moiety pending out of the basic coordination unit. Antiferromagnetic interaction between 3d metal and niobium centers through cyano bridges was observed for both assemblies. Several theoretical approaches were applied to explain the origin of the effective intermetallic magnetic coupling or/ and long-range ordering in 3D 3d-metals-octacyanometa- lates assemblies.32,34,40-43 The critical factor modulating the magnetism in these systems is a type of coordination polyhedra of participating metal centers influencing the electronic ground state as well as the spin density transferred onto the molecular orbitals of cyano bridges. It was shown that highly symmetrical SAPR [Mo(CN)8]3- and [W(CN)8]3- ions (dz21 ground state) are characterized by an almost identical spin density distribution over all eight cyano bridges, while the lower symmetry DD ions (dx2-y21 ground state) reveal significantly increased spin density for privileged equatorial positions B and decreased spin density for the apical positions A compared to those of SAPR.41,42 This difference is well illustrated in the case of the Mn(II)-Mo- (V) antiferromagnetic interactions considered for dinuclear Mn-NC-Mo linkages extracted from Mo6Mn9 high-spin cluster, where the |J| value for CN- bridges at position B were significantly higher compared to those of position A.41 Another crucial factor is the type of coordination polyhedra of the 3d metal center. It has been shown that 3D MnII2- [MoIII(CN)7] networks reveal long-range ordering of TC increasing with decreasing coordination number (C.N.) and change of coordination polyhedra: for cis-[MnII(µ-NC)4- (H2O)2] (C.N. ) 6) and mer-[MnII(µ-NC)3(H2O)3] (C.N. ) 6) TC ) 51 K;7 for fac-[MnII(µ-NC)3(Otea)2Ntea] (C.N. ) 6) and [MnII(µ-CN)4Otea] (C.N. ) 5, square pyramid) TC ) 75 K,11 for fac-[MnII(µ-NC)3(Otea)2Ntea] (C.N. ) 6) and [MnII- (µ-CN)4] (C.N. ) 4, tetrahedron) TC ) 106 K) (tea ) triethanoloamine).11 A natural extension of the studies of 3D magnetic octacyanometalate-MnII networks is investigation of the inorganic-organic hybrid assemblies built by [NbIV(CN)8]4- and MnII building blocks. Although each MnII center has a potential to bridge up to six metal centers, in 3D {MnII2- (H2O)4[NbIV(CN)8]‚4H2O}38 coordinates four [NbIV(CN)8]4- moieties. Use of organic linkers should give rise to a number of related, yet different, structural topologies derived from the same basic structural MnII2NbIV unit tuned by N- or/and O-donor organic linker. We presumed that organic linker will modify the metric parameters of Mn-NC-Nb linkages and introduce the additional coordination and magnetic arrange- ment in the form of organic {M-(µ-L)}n2n+ or {M-L-M}4+ open motives. We chose three organic linkers of well- documented ability to ensure the magnetic coupling between d-metallic connectors with the magnitude of J intermetallic coupling constants of one-tenth to units: pz,44-54 pzdo17,55 (pyrazine-N,N′-dioxide), and bpym.33,56,57 The presence of the {M-(µ-L)}n2n+ polymeric arrangement may influence magnetic ordering implying metamagnetic behavior or an increase of Tc values.17,44-47,50-55 Herein, we present three 3D high-Tc ferrimagnetic organic- inorganic hybrid materials with MnII-L-MnII and MnII- NC-NbIV linkages: {MnII2(pz)2(H2O)4[NbIV(CN)8]}‚pz‚ 3H2O (1), {MnII2(pzdo)(H2O)4[NbIV(CN)8]}‚5H2O (2), and {MnII2(bpym)(H2O)2[NbIV(CN)8]} (3).

TGA/DTG/QMS measurements done on freshly prepared sample show two peaks in the temperature regions 30-120 and above 120 °C assigned to collective loss of H2O and CN-. The first region is dominated by loss of crystallization and coordination H2O, while the second one is dominated by loss of CN-. {MnII2(bpym)(H2O)2[NbIV(CN)8]} (3). Yellow, single crystals of 3 were grown by slow diffusion of three substrate solutions in an H-shaped tube of total volume 8 mL during the period of 3 weeks. An aqueous solution of the potassium octacyanoniobate(IV) (0.1 mmol, 50 mg in 0.5 mL) in one arm and an aqueous mixture of MnCl2‚4H2O (0.5 mmol, 99 mg, 0.75 mL) with bipyrimidine (0.5 mmol 80 mg in 0.75 mL) in the other were connected with an aqueous solution of bipyrimidine (0.42 g in 7 mL). Product was washed with water and dried in air. Yield: ca. 25%. Anal. Calcd for C16H10Mn2N12NbO2: C 31.8; H 1.7; N 27.9. Found: C, 31.8; H, 1.8; N 27.5.

TGA/DTG/QMS measurements show no weight loss below 120 K; then collective decomposition starts. Structure Solution and Refinement. The single-crystal dif- fraction data were collected on a Nonius Kappa CCD equipped with a Mo KR radiation source and graphite monochromator. The space groups were determined using the ABSEN61 program. For compounds 1 and 2 the structures were solved by the Patterson method using SHELXS-97.62 The structure of compound 3 was solved by direct methods using SIR-97.63 Refinement and further calculations for all compounds were carried out using SHELXL- 97.62 The non-H atoms were refined anisotropically using weighted full-matrix least-squares on F2. All hydrogen atoms joined to carbon atoms in organic components of the discussed compounds were positioned with an idealized geometry and refined using a riding model with Uiso(H) fixed at 1.2Ueq(C). All reachable H atoms in water molecules were found from the difference Fourier map and then refined using a riding model (AFIX 3) with Uiso(H) fixed at 1.5Ueq(O). Selected crystallographic data for the studied compounds are shown in Table 2. Structural diagrams were prepared using Mercury 1.4.1 or ORTEP 3264 software. Physical Techniques. Infrared spectra were measured in KBr pellets between 4000 and 400 cm-1 using a Bruker EQUINOX 55 spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on a EuroEA EuroVector elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric data in the temperature range 25-400 °C were collected on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e microgravimeter equipped with QMS Thermostar GSD 300 T Balzers at a heating rate of 5 °C/min in an Ar atmosphere. Magnetic susceptibility vs temperature, T, and vs magnetic field, H, was performed using a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. Results Synthetic Strategy. Compound 1 was prepared according to the two-step strategy35,36 consisting of cross-linking the preorganized pyrazine-bridged {MnII-(µ-pz)}n2n+ chains by octacyanoniobate ions. Taking into account the influence of the reaction conditions on formation of possible homome- tallic Mn-pz byproducts65 or heterometallic {MnII2(H2O)4- [NbIV(CN)8]‚4H2O} we used a large excess of pyrazine over MnII and [NbIV(CN)8]4- ions in the H tube. Compound 2 was afforded in a one-pot reaction under using excess organic linker over metal ions with a molar ratio of pzdo:Mn of 8:1. The synthetic strategy for compound 3 was adapted from the literature method (slow diffusion in the H tube) applied (58) Kiernan, P. M.; Griffith, W. P. J. Chem Soc., Dalton Trans. 1975, 2489-2494.

The crystal structure of 1 is shown in Figures 1and 2 and Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2. The basic coordination units are linear 1D trans- {MnII-(µ-pz)}n2n+ chains interlocked with the 3D network of MnII-CN-NbIV linkages into the hybrid organic- inorganic 3D coordination framework (Figures 1 and 2). The constitution is completed by monocoordinated and crystal- lization pyrazine as well as coordination and crystallization water molecules. Crystallization pyrazine molecules are stabilized by hydrogen bonding to H2O molecules and strong π-π interaction with two bridging pyrazine molecules (Figure S1). Selected details of the manganese and niobium coordination units are presented in Figure S2 and Table S1. Mn1, Mn2, and Mn3 centers forming {MnII-(µ-pz)}n2n+ chains coordinate two nitrogen atoms of bridging pyrazine, two nitrogen atoms of [Nb(CN)8]4- moieties, and two oxygen atoms of aqua ligands in a trans-elongated octahedral geometry. Within the chain the dihedral angle between the plane of the bridging pz molecule and the MnN2(Npz)2 or Table 2.

Water molecules and terminal CN- ligands are omitted for clarity. Podgajny et al. 10420 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 46, No. 24, 2007 Mn(Npz)2O2 plane of the Mn complex is very close to 45°. Mn4 and Mn5 centers are involved in a cyano-bridged network only. They coordinate three nitrogen atoms of the [Nb(CN)8]4- units in a fac-geometry, two oxygen atoms of the aqua ligands, and one nitrogen atom of the monodentate pyrazine molecule. The geometry of Mn4 and Mn5 deviates strongly from an ideal octahedron. [Nb(CN)8]4- moieties of square-antiprismatic (SAPR) geometry distorted toward dodecahedral (DD) coordinate five bridging and three terminal cyano ligands, giving rise to mixed Nb:Mn 5:2 and 5:3 inorganic connectivity. The metric parameters are in agreement with those of [Nb(CN)8]4- moieties38,39 and those of Mn-pyrazine coordination compounds.44-46,65-67 The crystal structure of 2 is shown in Figures 3and 4 and Supporting Information Figure S3. The extended 3D cyano- bridged coordination framework is built of waved 2D niobium-nodded Mn2Nb sheets of square grid topology (Mn-N1-C1-Nb and Mn-N4-C4-Nb linkages) (Figure 3) joined together by a system of Mn-N3-C3-Nb linkages (Figure 4). The architecture of the 3D framework results in channels filled with bridging pzdo molecules as well as coordination and crystallization H2O molecules involved in the hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interaction network. It may be also perceived as a supramolecular 3D coordination scaffold constructed of sets 1D straight NbMn ladders interlocked in Nb centers (Figure 4). The pzdo molecules create the dimeric coordination arrangement, forming pzdo- capped [MnII2-(µ-pzdo)]-{(µ-CN)2-[NbIV(CN)6]} triangles (Figure S3). The most important metric parameters are presented in Table S1. Manganese centers coordinate three nitrogen atoms [Nb(CN)8]4- units in the mer-geometry. The pseudo-octahedral coordination is completed by two oxygen atoms of H2O ligands molecules and one oxygen end of the pzdo ligand bridging Mn(II) centers of Mn2(pzdo)Nb tri- angles. The bridging coordination of pzdo is realized by the almost ideal gauche conformation with a torsion angle Mn- O-O′-Mn′ of 91.7°.68 The observed conformation is dif- ferent from the trans one observed for homometallic Mn- (NCS)2(pzdo)255 and MnN3pzdo17 as well as [Mn(NCS)2(2,5- dmpdo)1.5(H2O)2]‚0.5(2,5-dmpdo)‚H2O, Mn(N3)2(2,5- dmpdo)(H2O)2, and Mn(dca)2(2,5-dmpdo) (2,5-dmpdo ) 2,5- dimethylopyridine-N,N′-oxide, dca- ) dicyanamid) networks (Mn-O-O′-Mn′ angle ) 180°).69 The basal plane of the pzdo ligands is oriented parallel to the square planes of [Nb(CN)8]4- with close contact distances Cpzdo‚‚‚NCN and Opzdo‚‚‚NCN of about 3 Å. Octacyanoniobate moieties have intermediate geometry between square antiprism and dodeca- hedron (DD) and coordinate six neighboring manganese centers, giving rise to Nb:Mn 6:3 inorganic connectivity. The metric parameters are in agreement with those of [Nb(CN)8]4- moieties. The crystal structure of 3 is shown in Figures 5 and 6 and Supporting Information Figure S4. The basic coordination units are dimeric {Mn2(µ-bpym)}2+ moieties exhibiting a bis- chelating coordination mode of bpym (Figure S4). Coordina- tion of octacyanoniobate(IV) (Mn-N1-C1-Nb and Mn- N4-C4-Nb linkages) leads to 2D layers built of alternatively aligned stripes of {Mn2(µ-bpym)}2+ and Nb2Mn2 squares involved in cyano-bridged ribbons (Figure 5). Further coordination of [Nb(CN)8]4- (Mn-N3-C3-Nb linkage) leads to a closely packed 3D cyano-bridged network (Figure 6). The constitution is completed by coordinated H2O molecules. No crystallization molecules are observed. The (66) Kumagai, H.; Kawata, S.; Kitagawa, S. Inorg. Chim. Acta 2002, 337, 387-392.

The signatures of CtN stretching modes render infrared spectroscopy a useful tool for char- acterization of octacyanometalates based coordination net- works. The IR spectra of 1-3 in the ν(CN) region together with their Gaussian deconvolution as well as spectra of K4- [Nb(CN)8]‚2H2O are presented in Figures S5 and Table 3. The spectra exhibit strong broad complex absorption bands in 2090-2180, 2110-2170, and 2100-2170 cm-1 wave- number range, respectively. Comparison to the spectra of ionic potassium salts of [Nb(CN)8]4-58 shows additional bands above 2140 cm-1, which are generally assignable to bridging modes of CN- ligands.70 The compounds do not exhibit any regular dependence between the bridging-to- terminal CN- ligands ratio and the intensity ratio of appropriate bands. We interpret the whole ν(CN) region of 1-3 to be intrinsic features related to the σ- and π-donor as well as π-acceptor properties of bridging cyanides of respective networks.71 Spectra of 1 and 2 along with spectra of relevant linker in the solid state in the range characteristic for vibrations of organic molecules are presented in Figures S6 and S7, respectively. The spectrum of 1 exhibits significant changes compared to the spectrum of free pyrazine (Figure S6).72 The 469, 449, and 441 cm-1 bands are representative for the [Nb(CN)8]4- moiety (skeletal ν(Nb-C))58 as well as coor- dinated pyrazine,73-77 while the very visible shoulder at ca. 417 cm-1 is attributed to a crystallization molecule of pyrazine.72 The changes in the energy and intensity are also seen in the 1200-1000 cm-1 region characteristic of γ(ArCH in-plane) vibrations, and we attribute them to the presence of bridging, monocoordinated, and hydrogen-bond- and π-π stacking-stabilized pyrazine. The spectrum of 2 exhibits significant changes compared to the spectrum of free pzdo (Figure S7).60 The changes are attributed to the presence of bridging modes of pzdo. The most pronounced shifts are seen in the 850-880, 1030- 1060, and 1230-1280 cm-1 regions. The spectrum of 3 in the range 1800-400 cm-1 (Figure S8) generally exhibits features characteristic for coordinated bpym ligand including the presence of a very strong band at 1580 cm-1 along with the absence of a band close to 1530 cm-1, both characteristic of bis-chelation of the bpym ligand.33 Magnetic Properties. The temperature dependences of the magnetic susceptibility M(T) measured at 1 kOe for magnetic networks 1-3 are presented in Figure 7. The high-temper- ature øT product values of 8.8 (1), 8.9 (2), and 8.6 (4) cm3‚mol-1‚K are very close to 9.13 cm3‚mol-1‚K expected for two high-spin MnII (S ) 5/2) and one NbIV (S ) 1/2) assuming g ) 2.0. On cooling M values increase slowly; then the signals increase, abruptly reaching the highest point at about 27 (1), 37 (2), and 50 (3) K, then saturating at low temperatures. Such a temperature dependence of M suggests the presence of long-range magnetic ordering below critical temperatures Tc. The M(H) dependences of 1-3, measured at 2 K, are presented in the Figure 7.

Podgajny et al. 10422 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 46, No. 24, 2007 magnetization at saturation Msat are 8.8 (1), 9.1 (2), and 9.0 Nâ (3), strongly suggesting a magnetic structure with one Nb (S ) 1/2) spin-up and two Mn (S ) 5/2) spin-down, where a saturation value of 9 Nâ is expected. The increase of M(H) signals is extremely fast, reaching about 95% of Msat below H ) 2 kOe. No magnetic hysteresis is observed at 2 K. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetizations, recorded at a magnetic field of 5 Oe, demonstrate sharp anomalies at 27 (1), 37 (2), and 50 K (3) (Figure S9), confirming magnetic ordering at these temper- atures. All observations point out that 1-3 are soft, classical 3D ferrimagnets. The FC curve for 1 reveals the unusual behavior below 25 K along with the additional anomaly around 5 K, suggesting that magnetic structure undergoes further transitions, at least in low magnetic fields. The ø-1(T) curves above ordering temperatures reveal two distinguish- able regions of linearity with a slight shoulder around 90 (1), 150 (2), and 180 (3) K (Figure S10). Fitting the Curie- Weiss law ø-1 ) (T - θCW)/C to the data above 100 for 1 and above 200 K for 2 and 3 gives θCW ) 23 (1), 7 (2), and 26 K (3) (in the case of 1 the fit is in the 100-150 K range).78 In all three cases θCW values are significantly lower than ordering temperatures TC, which is in agreement with the ferrimagnetic structure. Discussion X-ray structural characterization shows that the dominating bridging motifs responsible for the 3D coordination archi- tecture in 1-3 are NbIV-CN-MnII linkages. We assign the presence of ordering temperature TC in 1-3 mainly to the effective antiferromagnetic Nb(IV)-Mn(II) coupling through extended inorganic connectivity of the cyano-bridged frame- work. The magneto-structural correlation for 3D Mn2Nb assemblies is presented in Table 4. The tentative geometry of the [Nb(CN)8]4- moiety coordination polyhedra was proposed based on the detailed investigation of selected sets of dihedral angles between the normals of adjacent triangles, defined as δ, and nonplanarity of the trapezoidal-type atoms, defined by the angle φ (Table 5).42,79 Precise determination of the structure of [Nb(CN)8] in 1-3 was performed using continuous shape measure (CShM) analysis for eight- coordinate polyhedra (Table 6).80-84 Figure 8 presents the coordination environment of [Nb(CN)8]4- moieties in 1-3. In 1 [Nb(CN)8]4- complexes with a geometry close to SAPR with the shape measures SSAPR ) 0.47 and 0.54 and SDD ) 1.50 and 1.66. [Nb(CN)8]4- ions coordinate five Mn(II) centers (Figure 8a). In 2 octacyanoniobates(IV) have a geometry of intermediate character between SAPR and DD (SSAPR ) 1.17, SDD ) 0.69) and coordinate six Mn(II) complexes using six cyanides, four of them located at “vertexes B”-like and the remaining two located at “vertexes A”-like positions (Figure 8b). In 3 [Nb(CN)8]4- has DD geometry (SSAPR ) 2.33, SDD ) 0.28) and coordinate six Mn- (II) complexes using six cyanides, four of them located in the vertexes B and the remaining two vertexes A (Figure 8c). The relatively small values of parameter ∆(SAPR,DD) indicate that the actual shapes of [Nb(CN)8] polyhedra in 1-3 are very close to the ideal SAPR f DD interconversion pathway, which makes the bicapped trigonal prism (BTP) contribution to be of minor importance. We correlate the observed increase of TC from 1 (27 K) to 2 (37 K) and 3 (50 K) mainly with the change in the geometry of [Nb(CN)8]4- coordination polyhedra from SAPR (1) via intermediate SAPR/DD (2) toward DD (3) and with the increase of the number of cyano bridges per each Nb center (1 and 2). We also denote the shorter and more bent Nb-CN-Mn linkages in higher TC 3 compared to lower TC 2. A strong dependence of the magnitude and sign of the J coupling constant on the bending angle M′-NC-M′′ linkages (M′, M′′ ) 3d- electronic metal ions) was observed for hexacyanometalate- based cyano-bridged assemblies.85,86 This correlation in the case of octacyanometalates-based compounds may be, how- ever, of minor significance as it was suggested by Ruiz et al. for Mo6Mn9 high-spin cluster.41 Particularly interesting is the coincidence of TC values (50 K) for 3 and the 3D ferrimagnetic {MnII2(H2O)4[NbIV(CN)8]‚4H2O} network char- acterized by dominating SAPR character of [NbIV(CN)8]4- and increased Nb:Mn inorganic connectivity (8:4) compared to 3 (6:3).38 We relate this equality to the DD character of [NbIV(CN)8]4- along with the four equatorial and two apical cyano bridges in 3. This configuration may possibly ensure the spin density localized on CN- bridges to be high enough (78) The data were carefully corrected for background diamagnetism.

Figures 9 and S11 represent the Mn- (II)-NC-Nb(IV) magnetic coupling in networks 1-3, qualitatively depicting the differences in overlap of π*(CN) orbitals with Nb magnetic orbitals dx2-y2 (A vertex cyano bridge) (3) (Figure 9a), dz2 (Figure 9b) (1), and dxv-y2 (B vertex cyano bridge) (Figure 9c) (3). The extent of overlap is in agreement with the general trend of increasing spin density on going from the A vertex CN- of DD via SAPR vertex CN- toward B vertex in CN- of DD found for [Mo(CN)8]3- and [W(CN)8]3- moieties.42 All manganese- (II) centers in 1-3 have a pseudo-octahedral environment (t2g3eg2 ground-state configuration) and effectively provide one-electron dxy, dxz, and dyz orbitals, ensuring domination of antiferromagnetic coupling characteristic for cyano- bridged d1 octacyanometalate-Mn(II) compounds (M(d1) ) NbIV, MoV, and WV).38,41,87,88 The influence of organic linker on the magnetic signals of 1-3 relies strongly on the degree of organic connectivity.

Podgajny et al. 10424 Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 46, No. 24, 2007 sublattice represented by the {MnII-(µ-pz)}n2n+ 1D chains. 1D coordination of pz and 3d metal ions MII (MnII, CoII, FeII, CuII) is characterized by antiferromagnetic MII-pz- MII interaction with the coupling constant |J| of one-tenth to several cm-1 and in many cases strongly influences the magnetic ordering, implying metamagnetic behavior or the increase of Tc values.44-47,50-54 The |JMnMn| values through the pz bridge are generally lower44-47 than |JMMn| values for MnII-NC-MV(CN)7 (M ) Mo, W) linkages, estimated to fall within the range from -3 to -23 cm-1.32,41,87,89 The cross-linking the {MnII-(µ-pz)}n2n+ 1D chains with a 3D cyano-bridged framework leads to competition between the antiferromagnetic interaction via MnII-NC-NbIV and MnII- pz-MnII linkages. Assemblies 2 and 3 are characterized by the local linking within dimeric entities only. The respective FC-ZFC curves reveal a shape characteristic of classical ferrimagnets without any additional features below TC, which is correlated with the absence of any influence of organic connectivity. This observation is also in a good agreement with the negligibly small |JMnMn| coupling constant assumed for {Mn2-(µ-pzdo)} dimer in 2 and |JMnMn| calculated for {Mn2-(µ-bpym)} dimers (J ) -1.1 cm-1)33 in {MnII2- (bpym)(H2O)2[NbIV(CN)8]} (M ) Mo, W) networks com- pared to the magnitude of |JMMn| values for MnII-NC- MV(CN)7 (M ) Mo, W) linkages. Conclusions Our investigations on MnII2NbIV organic-inorganic hybrid networks have afforded a series of 3D cyano-bridged ferrimagnetic assemblies exhibiting long-range ordering below TC in the range 27-50 K. Magneto-structural cor- relation reveals that the magnetic response depends on the structural parameters of 1-3. The observed increase of TC on going from 1 (27 K) to 2 (37 K) and 3 (50 K) is correlated with the approximate geometry of the [Nb(CN)8]4- moiety, SAPR for 1, intermediate SAPR/DD for 2, and DD for 3, and to the increased number of cyano bridges per Mn2Nb unit. Furthermore, the FC/ZFC characteristics are sensitive to the degree of coexisting organic connectivity related to MnII-L-MnII linkages (L ) pyrazine, pyrazine-N,N′- dioxide, and 2,2′-bipyrimidine). The pseudo-octahedral en- vironment of MnII centers is of minor significance in the explanation of magnetic properties. Complex {MnII2(pz)2(H2O)4[NbIV(CN)8]}‚pz‚3H2O (1) is the first example of a hybrid network that displays the coexistence of a cross-linked 3D cyano-bridged framework and 1D {MII-(µ-L)}n2n+ chains, filling for the first time an empty space in the classification table of hybrid materials proposed by Cheetham et al. with a notation of I3O1.27 This research clearly indicates that this class of octacy- anoniobate(IV) polynuclear hybrid materials has great po- tential as high Tc magnetic material that is worthy of further exploration.
