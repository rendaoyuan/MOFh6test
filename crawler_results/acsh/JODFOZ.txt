Box 426 Ibrahimia, Alexandria 21321, Egypt §Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543 * S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: We report the synthesis, structure, and sorption properties of a family of eight diamondoid (dia) metal− organic materials (MOMs) that are sustained by Co(II) or Zn(II) cations linked by one of three rigid ligands: 4-(2-(4- pyridyl)ethenyl)benzoate (1), 4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoate (2), and 4-(pyridin-4-yl)acrylate (3). Pore size control in this family of dia nets was exerted by two approaches: changing the length of the linker ligand from 1 to 3, and using solvent as a template to control the level of interpenetration in nets based upon 1 and 3. The resulting MOMs, dia-8i-1, dia-5i-3, dia-7i-1- Zn, dia-7i-1-Co, dia-4i-3-a, dia-4i-3-b, dia-4i-2, and dia-4i-1, exhibit 1D channels with pore limiting diameters (PLDs) of 1.64, 2.90, 5.06, 5.28, 8.57, 8.83, 11.86, and 18.25 Å, respectively. We selected dia nets for this study for the following reasons: their 1D channels facilitate study of the impact of pore size on gas sorption parameters in situations where pore chemistry is similar (pyridyl benzoate-type linkers) or identical (in the case of polymorphs), and their saturated metal centers eliminate open metal sites from dominating sorbent−solvate interactions and possibly masking the eﬀect of pore size. Our data reveal that smaller pore sizes oﬀer stronger interactions, as determined by the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) and the steepness of the adsorption isotherm in the low-pressure region. The porous MOM with the smallest PLD suitable for physisorption, dia-7i-1-Co, was thereby found to exhibit the highest Qst values for CO2 and CH4. Indeed, dia-7i-1-Co exhibits a Qst for CH4 of 26.7 kJ/mol, which was validated through grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation studies of CH4 adsorption. This Qst value is considerably higher than those found in covalent organic frameworks and other MOMs with unsaturated metal centers. These results therefore further validate the critical role that PLD plays in gas adsorption by porous MOMs. ■INTRODUCTION Natural gas (NG), which is predominantly methane, is the most abundant source of hydrocarbon fuel and oﬀers several advantages over liquid and solid hydrocarbon fuels: 30−40% lower carbon footprint, 60−80% less smog-producing pollu- tants, and lower cost. However, the current technologies for storage and transportation of NG, compressed NG and liqueﬁed NG, face considerable hurdles to their more widespread adoption because of the challenges and costs associated with pressurization and cooling, respectively. In addition, NG is typically contaminated with CO2 and H2S, which should be reduced in concentration to “sweeten” NG prior to use. The development of technologies for NG storage/ puriﬁcation and carbon capture based upon porous materials has been intensely studied in recent years with emphasis upon zeolites,1 porous activated carbon and carbon nanotubes,2−4 covalent organic frameworks (COFs),5 and metal−organic materials (MOMs).6−8 Their structures (especially their modularity) and properties (especially permanent porosity)9−11 also make MOMs a particularly attractive class of materials for applications beyond gas storage and separation,12 including heterogeneous catalysis,13 drug delivery,14 and conductivity.15 In the context of gas storage, MOMs for hydrogen storage have not yet come close to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) targets.16 In contrast, NG storage is more promising,17,18 since there are already MOMs that meet an early DOE target for volumetric uptake of CH4 (180 cm3/cm3 at 298 K, 35 bar).17 The newer DOE target for volumetric CH4 uptake is 263 cm3/ cm3 (298 K, 65 bar), and it was recently reported that the prototypal MOMs HKUST-1 and Ni-MOF-74 exhibit CH4 uptake of 270 and 250 cm3/cm3, respectively, at these conditions.19,20 Ni-MOF-74 outperforms HKUST-1 at lower pressure (<35 bar) because of its high isosteric heat of Received: January 1, 2014 Published: March 10, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/JACS © 2014 American Chemical Society 5072 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja500005k | J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 5072−5077 adsorption (Qst) of 21.4 kJ/mol (HKUST-1 exhibits Qst = 17 kJ/mol). Recent studies concerning selective carbon capture in a family of MOMs sustained by saturated metal centers (SMCs)21,22 revealed the profound eﬀect that pore size can impart upon CO2 capture performance. In order to further optimize performance for NG puriﬁcation and storage, it is necessary to address both the energetics of gas sorption and surface area. Herein we address the matter of energetics by reporting how systematic pore size control through crystal engineering can be accomplished in diamond- oid (dia) MOMs with SMCs. A new benchmark for the isosteric heat of sorption for CH4, Qst = 26.7 kJ/mol, was thereby observed along with conﬁrmation of the modulating eﬀect of pore size. Our experimental results and accompanying theoretical studies22 further indicate that optimal pore size lies in the range 4−8 Å, or just above the kinetic diameter of CH4 (3.8 Å).17,23,24 MOMs with smaller pore size typically exhibit relatively high uptake of CH4 in the lower pressure region (1− 40 bar) because of stronger interactions between CH4 molecules and the framework (as measured by higher Qst values). In contrast, MOMs with large pore limiting diameters (PLDs) are better suited for higher pressure uptake (40−200 bar).17 The Qst across the range of loadings also plays a critical role in CH4 storage applications. When CH4 is utilized for vehicle operation, it is desirable to have a high Qst value at the charging pressure and a low Qst value at the discharging pressure.25 In contrast, a relatively high Qst value at low pressure is optimal for other applications, such as storage of CH4 in tanks, CH4 puriﬁcation, and CH4 bioﬁltration. Therefore, in order to generate MOMs that are optimal for such applications, it is necessary to fully understand how to optimize both pore size and chemistry. In this contribution, we focus upon the matter of pore size through the systematic study of a family of dia networks formed by complexation of the ligands L1−L3 to Co(II) or Zn(II) (see Figure 1). ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION All reagents were used as purchased. Solvents were puriﬁed according to standard methods and stored in the presence of molecular sieves. Powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) data were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diﬀractometer at 20 kV, 5 mA for Cu KR (λ = 1.5418 Å), with a scan speed of 0.5 s/step (6°/min) and a step size of 0.05° in 2θ. Calculated PXRD patterns were produced using Powder Cell for Windows Version 2.4 (programmed by W. Kraus and G. Nolze, BAM Berlin, 2000). Gas adsorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer. Co(L1)2, dia-4i-1, was aﬀorded by solvothermal reaction at 105 °C of 0.10 mmol (0.029 g) of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.20 mmol (0.048 g) of HL1 in 15 mL of tert-butylformamide/tert-butyl alcohol (2:1 ratio). Red, needle-like crystals of dia-4i-1 were harvested after 24 h (yield 40%, 0.10 g based on Co(NO3)2). Single-crystal X-ray crystallography revealed that dia-4i-1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group F222 (a = 12.8020(3) Å, b = 34.9232(8) Å, c = 43.7551(1) Å, V = 19562.3 Å3). TOPOS revealed four independent networks related by two translation vectors, [0.5,0.5,0] and [0.5,−0.5,0]. Adjacent nets are separated through these vectors at 18.60 Å. Dia-4i-1 exhibits rectangular channels parallel to [1,0,0] with a PLD of 18.25 Å. The PLD values reported herein represent the accessible pore size as obtained by measuring the longest diagonal of the channel and subtracting 3.5 Å for van der Waals distances. Co(L1)2, dia-7i-1-Co, was synthesized via the same method as that used for dia-4i-1 except DMF/EtOH was used as solvent. Red, rod- shaped crystals of dia-7i-1-Co were harvested after 24 h (yield 62%, 0.13 g based on Co(NO3)2). Dia-7i-1-Co crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Cc with a = 13.337(1) Å, b = 24.979(2) Å, c = 8.5046(7) Å, V = 2797.56 Å3. Seven independent networks are interpenetrated, with a translational vector corresponding to the crystallographic c axis (8.50 Å) (Figure 2a). Dia-7i-1-Co exhibits narrow pores along [001] with PLDs of 5.28 Å. Zn(L1)2, dia-7i-1-Zn, is isostructural with dia-7i-1-Co and was synthesized via similar procedures (see Supporting Information). Co(L1)2, dia-8i-1, was synthesized via the same reaction method as used for dia-4i-1, except DMA/EtOH was used as solvent. Dark red triangular crystals were isolated after 24 h (yield 54%, 0.12 g based on Co(NO3)2). Dia-8i-1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Aba2 (a = 13.1543(8) Å, b = 21.7445(11) Å, c = 8.6774(6) Å, V = 2482.03 Å3) and exhibits 8-fold interpenetration with nets related by a translation vector of 11.55 Å along [0,0.5,0.5] and [0,0.5,−0.5]. Dia-8i- 1 exhibits pores along [1,0,0] with PLD of only 1.643 Å. Isostructural variants of dia-7i-1-Co and dia-8i-1 have been reported previously.26,27 Co(L2)2, dia-4i-2, was prepared by reaction of 0.10 mmol (0.029 g) of Co(NO3)2 and 0.20 mmol (0.040g) of HL2 in 15 mL of DMF at 105 °C for 24 h, yielding red, needle-like crystals (yield 65%, 0.13 g based on Co(NO3)2). Dia-4i-2 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4212 with a = b = 22.6250(7) Å, c = 12.7634(5) Å, V = 6533.46 Å3. Figure 1. Ligands (HL1−HL3) used herein for the synthesis of dia nets. Figure 2.

Journal of the American Chemical Society Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja500005k | J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 5072−5077 5073 Analysis using TOPOS revealed that dia-4i-2 is a class IIIa dia net with two sets of 2-fold nets (Figure 2c,d). The interpenetration vector in each set is parallel to the c axis with a relative displacement 11.88 Å, and it can be described as a (2+2) interpenetrated dia system.28 Dia- 4i-2 exhibits rectangular channels along the c axis with a PLD of 11.86 Å. Co(L3)2, dia-4i-3-a, was prepared by reaction of 0.10 mmol (0.029 g) of Co(NO3)2 and 0.20 mmol (0.040 g) of HL3 in 15 mL of DMF at 105 °C for 24 h. Dark red, rod-like crystals were isolated (yield 60%, 0.12 g based on Co(NO3)2). Dia-4i-3-a crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4212, with a = b =17.4848(8) Å, c = 20.2126(9) Å, and V = 6179.32 Å3. It exhibits four interpenetrated nets that are related by two translation vectors parallel to the c axis and separated by 20.33 Å. Rectangular channels lie parallel to the [0,0,1] direction with a PLD of 8.57 Å. Co(L3)2, dia-4i-3-b, was synthesized via the same reaction method as that used for dia-4i-3-a, except DMA was used as solvent. Rectangular purple crystals were isolated after 24 h (yield 54%, 0.11 g based on Co(NO3)2). Dia-4i-3-b crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnna with a = 12.4892(15) Å, b = 13.6324(15) Å, c = 12.1687(15) Å, and V = 2071.82 Å3. TOPOS revealed that the interpenetration is class IIIa, the same as that exhibited by dia-4i-2. The interpenetration vector is parallel to the c axis with a relative displacement 12.07 Å, and the structure can be described as (2+2) interpenetration. The interpenetrated nets are equally separated along [010] by 6.944(12) Å. Dia-4i-3-b exhibits rectangular channels along [010] with a PLD of 8.83 Å. Co(L3)2, dia-5i-3, was synthesized via the same reaction method as that used for dia-4i-3-a except EtOH was the solvent. Red triangular crystals were isolated after 24 h (yield 48%, 0.10 g based on Co(NO3)2). Dia-5i-3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Cc with a = 11.6908(4) Å, b = 21.0100(6) Å, c = 8.5286(2) Å, and V = 1588.33 Å3). The structure of dia-5i-3 consists of 5-fold inter- penetrated dia nets, with a translation parallel to the crystallographic c axis of 8.34 Å. Dia-5i-3 exhibits narrow pores parallel to [001] with PLDs of 2.7 Å (see SI for full crystallographic details). ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We selected dia nets for our study because of their amenability to design, relative ease of synthesis, and absence of unsaturated metal centers (UMCs). UMCs can enhance gas selectivity and storage capacity, as exempliﬁed by Mg/DOBDC29 (DOBDC = 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalate), the Mg analogue of MOF-74,30 and CPO-27-Zn,31 which exhibits high CO2 storage capacity (35.2 wt% at 298 K, 1 atm), high Qst (47 at zero loading), and high selectivity for CO2 over CH4 (11.5 at 1 atm). However, there are high energy costs for activating and regenerating MOMs with UMCs, at least in part because they tend to exhibit high aﬃnity toward H2O. Further, UMCs can mask the eﬀect of pore size. MOMs with SMCs rely upon weaker molecular recognition forces (physisorption) and therefore represent an attractive platform for directly testing the impact of pore size upon Qst. Several MOM families or “platforms” with SMCs have already been extensively studied in the context of CO2 and CH4 sorption, in particular, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)32,33 and pillared square grid MOMs.21 Dia nets represent a platform which has not yet been well studied in terms of gas adsorption, despite being one of the earliest and most widely studied classes of MOMs from a structural perspective.34 This is presumably because dia nets tend to exhibit interpenetration,35−37 which mitigates against high surface area and increases density. However, there are studies which indicate that interpenetration in MOMs that are topologically amenable to interpenetration can be con- trolled.38−41 Further, nets of general formula [Co(L)2], L = a pyridylcarboxylate ligand, can aﬀord a rich diversity of pore sizes and levels of interpenetration, as exempliﬁed by the variants prepared for this study: dia-8i-1 (8-fold interpenetra- tion, L1); dia-5i-3 (5-fold interpenetration, L3); dia-7i-1-Co (7- fold interpenetration, L1); dia-7i-1-Zn (7-fold interpenetration, L1); dia-4i-3-a (4-fold interpenetration, L3); dia-4i-3-b (4-fold interpenetration, L3); dia-4i-2 (4-fold interpenetration, L2); and dia-4i-1 (4-fold interpenetration, L1). 1D channels exhibiting PLDs of 1.64, 2.90, 5.28, 8.57, 8.83, 11.86 and 18.25 Å, respectively, were aﬀorded in this family of dia nets. Notably, dia-8i-1, dia-7i-1-Co, and dia-4i-1 are polymorphs, as are dia-4i-3-a, dia-4i-3-b, and dia-5i-3. A comparison between polymorphs facilitates an “apples-to-apples” comparison of the eﬀect of pore size upon gas sorption. Pore size control in dia nets is addressed herein through the use of two crystal engineering strategies.42 The ﬁrst approach uses solvent as a template to control the level of inter- penetration during the reaction of HL1 or HL3 with Co(NO3)2 at 105 °C, thereby aﬀording two sets of three polymorphs: dia- 4i-1 (4-fold), dia-7i-1-Co (7-fold), and dia-8i-1 (8-fold) from HL1 and dia-4i-3-a (4-fold), dia-4i-3-b (4-fold), and dia-5i-3 Scheme 1. Schematic Representation of the Control over the Level of Interpenetration in dia Nets Achieved via Solvent Templation Journal of the American Chemical Society Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja500005k | J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 5072−5077 5074 (5-fold) from HL3 (Scheme 1). Dia-4i-1, dia-7i-1-Co, and dia- 8i-1 were evaluated through TOPOS,43,44 which revealed that the nets belong to class 1a (Figure 2a,b).28 tert-Butylformamide aﬀorded dia-4i-1, the polymorph with the largest void volume and PLD (18.25 Å). The use of less bulky solvents, DMF and DMA, aﬀorded dia-7i-1-Co and dia-8i-1, analogues with much narrower channels (PLDs of 5.28 and 1.64 Å, respectively). Dia-4i-3-a, dia-4i-3-b, and dia-5i-3 were also analyzed by TOPOS, which revealed that dia-4i-3-a and dia-4i-3-b are 4-fold interpenetrated but in diﬀerent modes. Dia-4i-3-a exhibits class Ia interpenetration in which the nets are related by translational symmetry operations (Figure 2b), whereas dia-4i-3-b belongs to class IIIa;28 i.e., the nets are related by both translational and nontranslational symmetry operations (Figure 2c,d). Dia-5i-3 exhibits 5-fold interpenetration and belongs to class 1a. The exploitation of DMF and DMA as solvent and template aﬀorded dia-4i-3-a and dia-4i-3-b with PLD values of 8.54 and 8.78 Å, respectively, while EtOH, a less bulky solvent, aﬀorded dia-5i-3 and much smaller pores (2.90 Å). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that demonstrates how crystallization solvent can systematically and rationally impact the level of interpenetration exhibited by dia nets. Such an approach could well be generally applicable toward control over interpenetra- tion. Perhaps more importantly, such control facilitates study of the impact of pore size upon gas sorption in polymorphs. The second approach used herein for control of pore size was a more traditional crystal engineering approach;45,46 the use of linker ligands of varying length. HL1, HL2, and HL3 aﬀorded four dia nets with the same levels of interpenetration (4-fold) and similar pore chemistry, dia-4i-1, dia-4i-2, dia-4i-3-b, and dia-4i-3-a, but drastically diﬀerent PLDs of 18.25, 11.86, 8.83, and 8.57 Å, respectively. The variable PLDs of the eight dia nets detailed herein facilitated systematic evaluation of the eﬀect of pore size on CH4 adsorption. The volumetric CH4 uptakes (298 K, 35 bar) in dia-7i-1-Co, dia-4i-3-a, and dia-4i-2 were observed to be 95, 93, and 153 cm3/cm3, respectively (corresponding to PLDs of 5.28, 8.57, and 11.86 Å, respectively). The Qst values for CH4 were calculated from adsorption data collected at 298, 273, and 248 K for dia-4i-3-a and dia-4i-2 using three methods: the Clausius−Clapeyron equation, the Langmuir−Freundlich equation, and the virial equation. Selected gas adsorption isotherms are presented in Figure 3. Gas sorption isotherms for dia-7i-1-Co, the dia net that was found to exhibit the strongest interactions toward CH4, were collected three times using three diﬀerent samples to ensure reproducibility. Further, the isotherms were measured over a wide range of temperatures, 298, 273, 248, and 223 K. Qst was calculated using the experimental sorption isotherms (see SI). The material with the smallest PLD in this group was found to exhibit much stronger interactions with CH4 than those with larger pore size: Qst values of 26.7, 20.2, and 12.1 kJ/mol at low loading for dia-7i-1-Co, dia-4i-3-a, and dia-4i-2, respectively (Figure 4). Interestingly, the measured Qst value for methane (26.7 kJ/mol) in dia-7i-1-Co, the compound with the narrowest accessible pores (5.28 Å), is the highest value yet reported for CH4 adsorption. Indeed, the Qst value at low loading surpasses even those of MOMs with UMCs, such as HKUST-1,19 Mg-MOF-74,17,47 Co-MOF-74,17,47 Ni-MOF- 74,19 Mn-MOF-7417,47 Zn-MOF-74,17,47 PCN-14,19 and UTSA-20,19 which exhibit Qst values of 17, 18.5, 19.6, 21.4, 19.1, 18.3, 18.7, and 18.2 kJ/mol, respectively. This value is also higher than those of covalent organic frameworks18,48 such as COF-1, COF-5, COF-6, COF-8, COF-10, COF-102, and COF- 103, which exhibit Qst values of 17, 8.5, 19, 12, 8.5, 8.6, and 9.5 kJ/mol, respectively. Similar uptakes at high pressures were observed for porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), which also exhibit dia topology and various levels of interpenetration.49 This result was validated through grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation studies of CH4 adsorption in dia-7i-1-Co (see Supporting Information). These observations prompted us to evaluate other gases such as CO2 and H2 with the same series of nets and the Zn analogue of dia-7i-1-Co, dia-7i-1-Zn. Dia-4i-1and dia-4i-2 were found to exhibit CO2 uptakes of 173 and 168.5 cm3/g and 96 and 105.4 cm3/g near 1 atm at 273 and 298 K, respectively. The CO2 adsorption isotherms measured at 273 and 298 K in dia- 4i-3-a and dia-7i-1-Co are suggestive of strong aﬃnity toward CO2 because of the relatively steep CO2 uptake in the low- pressure regions compared to those seen for dia-4i-1 and dia-4i- 2. This is also consistent with the smaller PLDs of dia-4i-3-a and dia-7i-1-Co, promoting strong sorbent−sorbate interac- tions. The CO2 uptakes of dia-4i-3-a at 1 atm were found to be Figure 3. (a,b) Volumetric CH4 uptake isotherms measured at 298, 273, and 248 K for (a) dia-4i-2 and (b) dia-4i-3-a. (c) Volumetric CH4 uptake isotherms measured at 298, 273, 248, and 223K for dia-7i-1-Co. Journal of the American Chemical Society Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja500005k | J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 5072−5077 5075 69.8 and 90.5 cm3/g at 298 and 273 K, respectively, whereas those of dia-7i-1-Co were found to be 54.8 and 74.8 cm3/g at 298 and 273 K, respectively. Since dia-4i-3-a and dia-4i-3-b are isostructural with similar PLDs, we selected dia-4i-3-a for more detailed study (gas adsorption isotherms for dia-4i-3-b are presented in SI). The Qst values for CO2 were determined using adsorption data collected at 273 and 298 K (see SI for full details) and revealed values for dia-7i-1-Co, dia-4i-3-a, dia-4i-2, and dia-4i-1 of 30, 25, 22, and 19 kJ/mol at zero loading, respectively. The CO2 Qst data further demonstrate the eﬀect that pore size can impart upon the strength of sorbent−sorbate interactions (Figure 5). Dia-7i-1-Co, dia-7i-1-Zn, and dia-4i-3-a were found to exhibit sharp increases in H2 uptake in the low-pressure region when compared to those seen for dia-4i-1 and dia-4i-2 (see SI for more details). Overall, the sorption results for CH4, CO2, and H2 reveal that small pore size enhances sorbent−sorbate interactions in the low-pressure region. Notably, the pore chemistry of all structures described herein is similar or identical (for polymorphs), and the presence of SMCs eliminates the possibility that open metal sites can dominate sorbent−solvate interactions and thereby mask the eﬀect of pore size. ■CONCLUSION In summary, we have demonstrated two relatively facile strategies to modulate the pore size of dia networks: exploitation of solvent as a template to control the level of interpenetration, and the use of linkers with diﬀerent lengths to aﬀord nets with the same degree of interpenetration but diﬀerent PLDs. This has enabled a systematic study of the impact of PLD upon gas adsorption in dia nets with SMCs. The porous MOMs with the smallest PLD were found to exhibit the highest Qst for CH4 and CO2 and the highest selectivity for CO2 over N2. Whereas narrow PLD/high Qst materials might not exhibit the highest volumetric uptakes at higher pressures and be of utility with respect to on-board vehicle storage of natural gas, they direct us toward deﬁning PLDs that oﬀer optimal physicochemical properties for natural gas puriﬁcation and storage. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Additional gas adsorption isotherms and crystallographic tables.

Powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were recorded on a BrukerD8 Advance X-ray diffractometer at 20 kV, 5 mA for Cukα (λ = 1.5418 Å), with a scan speed of 0.5 s/step (6°/min) and a step size of 0.05° in 2θ at room temperature. The calculated XPD patterns were generated using Powder Cell for Windows Version 2.4 (programmed by W. Kraus and G. Nolze, BAM Berlin, 2000). Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Avatar 320 FT-IR spectrometer. Low pressure gas adsorption isotherms were measured on the Micrometrics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer. Synthesis of bis{4-[2-(4-Pyridyl)ethenyl] Benzoic Acid (HL1) The ligand HL1 was prepared by a modified literature method[1] by reacting 100 mmol (9.8 ml) of 4-methylpyridine (4-picoline) with 100 mmol (15.2 g) of 4-formylbenzoic acid in 100 ml acetic anhydride, the reaction mixture was heated at 145 0c for 10 h. the mixture then cooled to room temperature and the precipitated white-yellow crude product was collected by filtration and was washed several times with water followed by ethanol and finally with diethyl ether and recrystallized with hot DMF (16.5 g, yield 75%). Synthesis of Zn (L1)2(dmf), dia-7i-1-Zn: HL1 (0.022 g, 0.1 mmol) was dispersed in DMF and added a solution of Zn (ClO4)2·6H2O (0.018 g, 0.05 mmol) in EtOH. The resulting solution was heated in a scintillation vial 105°C for 12 h and cooled slowly to room temperature at a rate of 5oC min-1 that gave pale yellow block shaped single crystals (yield, 57%). Scheme S1: HL1, HL2 and HL3 facilitate systematic control over pore size in dia nets. S3 Scheme S2: An illustration of the solvent template effect that controls the level of interpenetration in dia nets formed by Co(II) and 4-(2-(4-pyridyl)ethenyl)benzoic acid (HL1). S4 Scheme S3: An illustration of the solvent template effect that controls interpenetration in dia nets formed by Co(II) and 4-(pyridin-4-yl)acrylic acid (HL3). S5 Description of crystal structures: Single crystal X-ray crystallography revealed that dia-4i-1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group F222 (a=12.8020(3) Å, b=34.9232 (8) Å, c=43.7551(1) Å, V= 19562.3 Å3). Dia-4i-1 exhibits adamantanoid cages (Scheme S2) with Co…Co edge distances of 15.3699 (3) Å to 15.4323 (3) Å and diagonal distances of up to 43.7551(1) Å. The adamantanoid cages are elongated along the a axis and exhibit dimensions (corresponding to the intercage Co…Co distances) of 2a×b×c (25.6040(6) Å × 34.9232 (8) Å × 43.7551(1) Å). Apical distances are 21.6553 (4) Å, 25.0093 (8) Å, and 27.9917 (8) Å. A mentioned above, TOPOS revealed that the four independent networks are related by two translation vectors corresponding to crystallographic [0.5, 0.5, 0] and [0.5,-0.5, 0]. Adjacent nets are equally separated through these vectors by 18.60 Å as schematically shown in Figure S3 (a,b). Adjacent nets are also equally separated along 001 (Co…Co = 6.4237 (2) Å). The distortion of the adamantanoid cages from ideal geometry arises from factors such as Co2+cations exhibiting distorted tetrahedral geometry through two pyridyl and two bidentate carboxylate moieties. In dia-4i-1 there are two different Co nodes having different bond angles and distances (N-Co1-N =97.22°(0), O-Co1-O=104.59 °(0), N-Co1- O=101.08°(1) and 128.06°(0), N-Co2-N 98.882°(0), O-Co2-O 112.149°(1), O-Co2-N 97.984°(0) and 126.547°(1). Figure S1. The isoreticular synthesis of dia nets using HL1, HL2 and HL3 afforded four 4-fold dia nets with widely different different PLDs. Co-Co-Co angles between each node are also pseudo-tetrahedral (Co2-Co1-Co2 = 91.935°(0), 130.736°(0), 110.105°(1) and 88.433°(0); Co1-Co2-Co1 =90.179°(0), 108.331°(0), 130.736°(1) and 111.889°(1). These distortions explain why the orthorhombic space group F222 is adopted rather than the ideal cubic space group Fm(3d). Dia-4i-1 exhibits rectangular channels parallel to [1,0,0] with dimensions based on Co…Co of 21.746 Å × 17.644 Å and a PLD of 18.25 Å (PLDs for all dia nets reported herein were determined by measuring the diagonal of the channel and subtracting 3.5 Å for Van der Waals distances). S6 Dia-7i-1-Co crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Cc with a= 13.337 (1) Å, b= 24.979 (2) Å, c = 8.5046 (7) Å, V = 2797.56 Å3. The adamantanoid cages are less elongated (Co…Co edges are 15.3996(18) Å and 15.4633 Å) and smaller (maximum dimensions of 3a×b×3.5c = 40.9215 (33) Å × 24.9790 (24) Å ×30.1519 (112) Å) than those of dia-4i-1 (Scheme S2). The separation between Co atoms that lies across the diagonal of each adamantanoid cage is 38.4572 (31) Å whereas the apical distances are 23.9714 (20) Å, 26.8511 (24) Å and 22.9287 (19) Å. The distortion from ideal geometry is reflected by the Co2+ nodes (N-Co-N = 97.550°(205), O-Co-O = 111.838°(232), N-Co-O = 98.220°(221)and 119.246°(236)). The Co-Co-Co edge angles are 95.962°(7), 120.505°(8), 143.544°(9) and 101.920°(8). The seven independent networks are interpenetrated with a translational vector corresponding to the crystallographic c axis (8.50 Å) as illustrated in Figure S2 (g,h). Dia-7i-1-Co exhibits narrow pores along [001] with PLDs of 5.28 Å. Dia-7i-1-Zn crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Cc with a= 13.4836 (11) Å, b= 24.964 (2) Å, c = 8.3985 (7) Å, V = 2793.1 Å3. Zn+2 cations exhibit distorted tetrahedral geometry through two pyridyl moieties, one monodentate carboxylate moiety and one bidentate carboxylate moiety. The separation between Zn cations that lies across the diagonal of each adamantanoid cage is 41.336 (21). The seven independent networks are interpenetrated with a translational vector corresponding to the crystallographic c axis (8.30Å). Dia-7i-1-Zn exhibits narrow pores along [001] with PLDs of 5.06Å. Dia-8i-1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Aba2 (a = 13.1543 (8) Å, b = 21.7445 (11) Å, c = 8.6774 (6) Å, V = 2482.03 Å3) and exhibits 8-fold interpenetration with adamantanoid cages with Co…Co edge distances of 15.3872(39) Å and Co-Co-Co edge angles of 111.342°(0), 111.342°(0), 129.389°(0) and 90.085°(0). The adamantanoid cages are more elongated along the c axis than the other polymorphs with dimensions (corresponding to the longest intercage Co…Co distances) of 2a×2b×4c = 26.3086 (16) ×43.4890(24) ×34.7096 (31) Å. The diagonal Co…Co distance is 43.4890(24) Å while the apical distances are 21.7767 (19) Å, 27.8211 (17) Å, 25.4138 (10) Å. Nets are related by a translation vector of 11.55 Å along [0, 0.5, 0.5] and [0, 0.5,-0.5]. Dia-8i-1 exhibits pores along [100] with PLD of only 1.643 Å. Isostructural variants of dia-7i-1-Co and dia-8i-1 have been reported previously.[1,2] Dia-4i-2 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4212 with a = b = 22.6250 (7) Å, c = 12.7634 (5) Å, V = 6533.46 Å3. The 4-fold interpenetrated dia net exhibits distorted adamantanoid cages with Co…Co edges of 12.9609 (16) Å and 13.0338(16) Å and Co-Co-Co edge angles of 105.176°(10), 100.389°(10), 100.389°(10), 120.339°(9), 107.565°(10), 121.576°(9) and 102.729°(10). The diagonal Co…Co distance is 31.9966 (15) Å whereas the apical distances are 20.3053(17) Å, 22.6250(15) Å and 19.9698 (17) Å. Analysis using TOPOS revealed that dia-4i-2 is a class IIIadia with two sets of 2-fold nets (FigureS3 (a, b)). The interpenetration vector in each set is parallel to the c axis with a relative displacement 11.88 Å and it can be described as a (2+2) interpenetrated diamondoid system.[3] dia-4i-2 exhibits rectangular channels along the c axis with PLD of 11.86 Å. S7 Figure S2. Illustrations of the dia nets reproted herein that belong to class Ia. S8 Figure S3. Illustrations of the class IIIa dia nets reported herein, a and b refer to dia-4i-2 whereas c and d refer todia-4i-3-b. Dia-4i-3-a crystallizes in the tetragonal space group p4212 with a= b=17.4848(8) Å, c=20.2126(9) Å and V= 6179.32 Å3 and contains adamantanoid cages with Co…Co edge distances of 11.07 (3) Å and 11.04 (3) Å(Scheme S3). The diagonal Co…Co distance in each adamantoid cage is 27.0918 (17) Å and they are elongated along the c axis with dimensions (corresponding to the longest intercage Co…Co distances) of a×b×4/3c (24.6206 (18) Å×24.6439 (18) Å×27.0918 (17) Å). Apical distances are 18.2882 (9) Å, 18.4687 (9) Å and 17.4176 (9) Å (Figure S52). A TOPOS analysis revealed that the four interpenetrated nets are related by two translation vectors parallel to the c axis. Nets are separated by 20.33 Å as illustrated in Figure S2 (c,d). There are four independent Co(II)cations that exhibit distorted tetrahedral geometry. Rectangular channels lies parallel to [0,0,1] direction with dimensions with a PLD of 8.57Å. Dia-4i-3-b, crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnna with a = 12.4892 (15) Å, b = 13.6324 (15) Å, c = 12.1687 (15) Å and V = 2071.82 Å3. TOPOS revealed that the type of interpenetration is class IIIa, the same as that exhibited by dia-4i-2 (Figure S3 (c, d)). The interpenetration vector is parallel to the c axis with a relative displacement 12.07 Å and it can be described as (2+2) interpenetration (Figure S3). The adamantanoid cages exhibit maximum dimensions of 2a×2b×2c (24.9784 (30) Å × 27.2648 (30) Å × 24.3374 (34) Å). The diagonal distance between Co…Co atoms is 27.2648 (30) Å S9 while the apical distances are 17.4372 (18) Å, 18.4884 (15) Å and 18.2735(18) Å. The interpenetrated nets are equally separated along [010] by a Co…Co distance of 6.944 (12) Å. The Co…Co edge distances are 11.0136 (26) Å and 11.0441 (26) Å whereas Co-Co-Co edge angles are 103.963°(1), 113.296°(1), 111.298°(1) and 111.298°(1). Co(II)cations exhibit distorted tetrahedral geometry with bond angles as follows: O-Co-O=102.440°(0), N-Co-N=99.999°(0), O-Co-N=106.641°(0), O-Co-N= 123.365°, O-Co- N=122.684°(0) and O-Co-N=103.20°(0)). Dia-4i-3-b exhibits rectangular channels along [010] with a PLD of 8.83 Å. Dia-5i-3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Cc with a = 11.6908 (4) Å, b = 21.0100 (6) Å, c = 8.5286 (2) Å and V = 1588.33 Å3). The structure of dia-5i-3 consists of dia nets with adamantanoid cages that exhibit Co…Co edge distances of 11.1878 (4) Å and 11.0200 (2) Å. The diagonal distance between Co…Co atoms is 27.2197 (12) Å while the apical distances are 17.1925 (5) Å, 18.4236 (4) Å and 17.4772 (4) Å. The distortion of the adamantanoid cages from ideal geometry can be attributed to distorted tetrahedral geometry around each Co(II) ion: N-Co-N =99.405°(17), O-Co-O = 122.560°(18), N-Co-O = 107.759°(19), 100.087°(19), 99.829°(11) and 127.274°(11). Co-Co-Co edge angles are 103.807°(1), 133.05°(1), 113.423°(1) and 101.456°(1). The 5-fold interpenetration occurs with a translation parallel to the crystallographic c axis of 8.34 Å illustrated in FigureS2 (e, f). Dia-5i-3 exhibits narrow pores parallel to [001] with PLDs of 2.7 Å. Figure S4. Infrared spectroscopy (diffuse reflectance) for dia-4i-1. S10 Figure S5. Infrared spectroscopy for dia-4i-2. Figure S6.

Gas sorption properties: Activation of samples: As-synthesized crystals of dia-4i-1 were exchanged with DMF for 4 days (3 times a day), exchanged with MeOH for another 4 days (to remove t-butylformamide from the pores) before crystals were harvested and subjected to super critical CO2 drying. The CO2 adsorption isotherm at 195 K revealed a Langmuir surface area of 1668 m²/g. Crystals of dia-4i-2 were exchanged with DMF for 2 days (3 times a day), exchanged with acetonitrile for 4 days (3 times/day) before crystals were harvested and placed in the sorption cell without exposing them to atmosphere. The sample was degassed under dynamic vacuum at 70 Ԩ for 15 h. The CO2 adsorption isotherm at 195 K revealed a Langmuir surface area of 1448 m²/g. Crystals of dia-4i-3-a and dia-7i-1-Co were activated using the same procedure as that used for dia-4i-2. Permanent porosity was confirmed via CO2 adsorption measurements at 195 K for dia-4i-3-a and dia-7i-1-Co (see Supporting Information). Langmuir surface areas of 757 m2/g and 833 m2/g were determined for dia-4i-3-a and dia-7i-1-Co, respectively. Dia-8i-1 and dia-5i-3 are nonporous according to N2 isotherms measured at 77 K. This is unsurprising given the crystallographically measured PLDs of 1.643 Å and 2.90 Å, respectively. S15 Figure S18. CO2 isotherm of dia-4i-1 measured at 195 K. Figure S19.

Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory The ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST)[4] was used to predict the equimolar binary mixture adsorption of CO2 and CH4 from the experimental pure-gas isotherms. The single-component isotherms were fit to a Langmuir-Freundlich equation: q=qm×[b×p/(1+b×p)] Here, P is the pressure of the bulk gas at equilibrium with the adsorbed phase (kPa), q is the adsorbed amount per mass of adsorbent (mol/kg), qm is the saturation capacity of adsorption (mol/kg), b is the affinity coefficient (1/kPa). S21 Indeed we calculate the IAST selectivity values for 10:90 CO2:N2 mixture for dia-7i-1-Co, dia-4i-3-a, dia-4i-2 and dia-4i-1 that are 41, 27.5, 22.5 and 10, respectively (Figure S35). Figure S35. IAST selectivities for a 10:90 CO2:N2 mixture for dia-4i-1, dia-4i-2, dia-4i-3-a and dia-7i- 1-Co. These observations prompted us to determine the selectivity of CO2 over N2 by calculating the CO2/N2 gravimetric selectivity in the context of post-combustion CO2 capture by determining wt% at 0.15 bar and 0.75 bar for CO2 and N2, respectively, at ambient temperature. The wt% of CO2 at 0.15 bar in dia- 7i-1-Co, dia-4i-3-a, dia-4i-2 and dia-4i-1 were 3.44%, 4.91%, 4.32% and 2.65%, respectively, whereas for N2 at 0.75 bar values were found to be 0.33%, 0.68%, 0.61% and 0.83%, respectively. Therefore, the selectivity of CO2 over N2 in dia-7i-1-Co, dia-4i-3-a, dia-4i-2 and dia-4i-1 under these conditions was found to be 52.1, 36.2, 35.4 and 15.9, respectively.

Computional studies and simulation details of CH4 sorption in dia-7i-1-Co: Simulations of CH4 sorption in dia-7i-1-Co were performed using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) methods[5] in a 2 × 2 × 2 system cell of the MOM. A spherical cut-off corresponding to half the shortest system cell dimension length was used for the simulations. The chemical potential for CH4 was determined for a range of temperatures through the Peng-Robinson equation of state.[6] In this work, two CH4 models were considered for simulations of CH4 sorption in dia-7i-1-Co. Model 1 is a single-site model that includes only repulsion/dispersion interactions using the Lennard- Jones 12–6 potential; this model is based on the TraPPE force field.[7] Model 2 is a nine-site model that includes repulsion/dispersion and electrostatic parameters. In this model, the Lennard-Jones parameters are located on the carbon atom and four off-site positions that are each positioned 0.816 Å from the carbon atom and along the C–H bond vector. In addition, there are partial charges located on the C and H atoms. Model 2 was developed using an adsorbate potential fitting procedure as described in previous work.[8-11] The parameters for both CH4 models can be found in Table S1. Only van der Waals interactions were considered for the simulations in this work; thus, the potential energy of the MOM-CH4 system was calculated using only the Lennard-Jones potential. Preliminary simulation results using model 2 with electrostatic interactions turned on revealed that van der Waals interactions contribute to 99% of the total potential energy for CH4 sorption in dia-7i-1-Co. This is due to the narrow pore sizes (PLD = 5.28 Å) that are present in the material, as it allows the adsorbate molecules to interact with multiple portions of the MOM simultaneously. Indeed, the confined space in the MOM causes van der Waals interactions to dominate. Thus, partial charges were not assigned to the nuclear center of the atoms of the MOM for CH4 sorption in this work. The Lennard-Jones parameters for the atoms in dia-7i-1-Co were taken from known force fields. Specifically, the parameters for all C, H, and N atoms were taken from the OPLS-AA force field,[12] while those for Co and O were taken from the universal force field.[13] The Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules[14] were used to calculate the interactions between different species. S33 Table S1: The parameters for the two CH4 models that were used for the simulations in this work. COM refers to the center-of-mass position and OS refers to the off-site positions.

The simulations were performed using the Massively Parallel Monte Carlo (MPMC) code.[16] For all state points considered, the simulations consisted of 5 × 106 Monte Carlo steps to guarantee equilibration, followed by an additional 5 × 106 steps to sample the desired thermodynamic properties and to ensure good averages for the Qst values. In general, the simulated CH4 Qst values in dia-7i-1-Co are in reasonable agreement with the experimental Qst values across the considered loading range for both CH4 models (Figure S47). The best agreement between experiment and simulation can be observed at low loading. Note, the difference in the shape in the Qst plots between experiment and simulation can be attributed to the difference in methodology in computing the Qst values for the respective techniques. The experimental Qst values are based on empirical fitting of the experimental CH4 sorption isotherms, whereas the theoretical Qst values are taken directly from GCMC simulation. Nevertheless, both experiment and simulation reveals that the initial Qst values for CH4 in dia-7i-1-Co ranges from 26 to 27 kJ mol-1, which is currently the highest out of all MOMs reported thus far.

Hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions and included in the refinement process using riding model with isotropic thermal parameters: Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(-CH), Uiso(H) = 1.5Ueq(-CH3). Low resolution observed in case of structure dia-4i-2 could probably be attributed to the presence of large cavities (47% Potential Solvent Area) filled with disordered solvent. In this case the contribution of heavily disordered solvent molecules was treated as diffuse using Squeeze procedure implemented in Platon program.34, 35 Atomic displacement parameters in this structure were refined using restraints (DELU C10 C9 C8 C12 C3 C11 N1 C5 C6 C7 C20 C21 C13 C14 and ISOR C13 C1).
