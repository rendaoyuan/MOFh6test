Vittal* Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543 * S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Four coordination polymers of s-block metal ions, namely, Na(I), K(I), and Ba(II) with rctt-cyclobutanetetracarboxylate (rctt-cbtc) ligand were synthesized, and their solid-state structures were determined by X-ray crystallography. Of these, [Na2(rctt-cbtc-H2)(H2O)4] (1) and (2) are supramolecular isomers with mog and pcu topologies. While the three- dimensional structure of [K2(rctt-cbtc)(H2O)2] (3) is constructed based on a (6,8) net, [Ba2(rctt-cbtc)(H2O)6] (4) has fsh topology with (4,6) connectivity. Compounds 1−3 have been found to undergo thermal isomerization, contrary to the expected thermal cleavage of the cyclobutane ring, in the temperature range 200−250 °C cleanly to the rtct isomer in 50− 85% yield, but not 4. Interestingly, recrystallization of the isomerized product of 1 yielded single crystals of [Na3(rtct-cbtc-H)(H2O)3]n (5). Although the composition has changed in this process, the stereochemistry at the cyclobutane ring was conﬁrmed in this three-dimensional coordination polymer with a new topology. ■INTRODUCTION Alkali and alkaline earth metal ions play an important role in living cells; for example, Na(I) and K(I) maintain the ionic equilibria, Mg(II) and Ca(II) are essential mineral nutrients in which Mg(II) makes the ATP active and catalyze the photosynthesis, while Ca(II) is an important constituent of the bone tissue. Many of their compounds are of great importance in industry such as pharmaceuticals and dyes.1 Recently lightweight Mg(II)-based metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) were found suitable for CO2 uptake; surprisingly the coordination chemistry of these metal ions is not well explored.2 Being highly electropositive and possessing a rather big ionic radii make the coordination number of the s-block metal ions relatively erratic.3 The basic nature and high enthalpy of hydration make it relatively tough to design the coordination polymers (CPs) of s-block metal ions as well as synthesize them from aqueous solution.4 The random and unpredictable nature of its coordination number and pH- dependent self-assembly can nevertheless facilitate the for- mation of novel topologies with a number of designed ligands. Structural transformations involving bond making and breaking in CPs have always been interesting. Most of these transformations are commonly stimuli driven by light, heat, pressure, or guest molecules. Accompanying these trans- formations are changes in the dimensionality, connectivity, or geometry of the metal ion in the building unit. For example, structural transformations induced thermally are due to the change in binding modes of the coordinated ligand.5 However, structural transformation studies with respect to the ligands are rare in this area.6 Supramolecular isomerism is a well-known phenomenon in the structural chemistry of CPs.7 Diﬀerent synthetic exper- imental conditions as well as structural transformations can result in supramolecular isomers. The variable coordination number in s-block metal ions is expected to introduce variation in the self-assembly process, which is likely to increase the occurrence of supramolecular isomerism. Tetracarboxylate anions are an interesting class of spacer ligands to design CPs with novel connectivities.8 Of these, cyclobutane-based tetracarboxylate ligands were seldom used for this purpose.8e,9 A rarely studied tetracarboxylate ligand, namely, cyclobutane tetracarboxylate (cbtc), can be a potential spacer ligand to make CPs for various applications. Its rigidity arises from the strong bonding interactions between metal and oxygen based on hard soft acid base theory (HSAB) and can give rise to robust frameworks suitable for applications. Its high acidity from the four carboxylic acids would also ensure that it reacts well with basic metal ions. This ligand exists in two of the four possible stereoisomeric forms.9c,10a In a few cases, the rctt isomer has been found to isomerize to the more stable rtct- isomer under solvothermal, acidic, or basic conditions.9c,11,12 Usually a cyclobutane derivative in either organic or inorganic Received: March 3, 2014 Revised: April 11, 2014 Published: April 23, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/crystal © 2014 American Chemical Society 2605 dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg500307q | Cryst. Growth Des. 2014, 14, 2605−2613 systems has been studied for its ability to cleave back to oleﬁns reversibly. Recently our research group reported two systems where it undergoes 100% reversible cleavage in three- dimensional (3D) CPs. In the ﬁrst case, it was a 3D MOF having dia topology with bpeb ligand that polymerizes under UV light and depolymerizes upon heating,10b whereas in the second case, it was stilbenedicarboxylate (SDC), which undergoes a reversible [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction in K2(SDC).10c Hence, we proposed to investigate the possible thermal reactivity of the cbtc ligand in thermally stable alkali and alkaline metal salts. Herein, we report the synthesis of ﬁve s-block metal 3D coordination networks by reacting NaOH, KOH, and Ba(OH)2 with rctt-cbtc in water and alcohol mixture by slow evaporation. They are [Na2(rctt-cbtc-H2)(H2O)4] (1) and (2), which are supramolecular isomers, [K2(rctt-cbtc)(H2O)2] (3), [Ba2(rctt- cbtc)(H2O)6] (4) and [Na3(rtct-cbtc-H)(H2O)3]n (5) from (1). Thermal properties of these CPs showed varying behavior: 1, 2, and 3 show partial isomerization, whereas 4 did not show this property, which might be due to the intricate coordination mode of the cbtc ligand with the Ba(II) ions. In all three cases of isomerization, the single crystallinity was lost after heating. Hence, the product obtained after thermal isomerization of 1 was recrystallized to get 5 in order to conﬁrm the stereo- chemistry of the cyclobutane unequivocally by X-ray crystallog- raphy. It would be interesting to investigate the topology and connectivity of these CPs of s-block elements that exhibit diverse coordination modes: 1-mog, 2-pcu, and 4-fsh top- ologies, whereas 3 and 5 show diﬀerent connectivity and topology. The details of our investigation are described below. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials and General Methods. All of the purchased chemicals were of reagent grade and were used without further puriﬁcation. H4cbtc was synthesized according to a literature method (see Supporting Information).13 Elemental analysis was carried out at the Elemental Analysis Laboratory, CMMAC, the Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C min −1 on a SDT 2960 thermal analyzer. NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer with TMS as an internal reference. For all of the NMR spectra recorded, D2O was used. For 5, a drop of HNO3 was added to dissolve insoluble samples to dissociate the metal ions from the organic ligands. Powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns (PXRD) were recorded on a Siemens D5000 diﬀractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at RT (23 °C). Variable-temperature PXRD was recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 advance powder X-ray diﬀractometer with an Anton Paar model HTK 1200 high-temperature chamber. X-ray Crystallography. Intensity data for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were collected at 100(2) K on a Bruker APEX diﬀractometer attached with a CCD detector and graphite-monochromated Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation using a sealed tube (2.4 kW). An empirical absorption correction was applied to the data using the SADABS14 program. All the structures were solved by using direct methods and reﬁned on F2 by full- matrix least-squares procedures with SHELXTL.15 Crystal data as well as details of data collection and reﬁnement are summarized in Table 1.

This ligand readily forms the salts of alkali and alkaline metal ions, but the single crystals of Na(I), K(I), and Ba(II), namely, 1−5, were successfully obtained by the acid−base reaction and structurally characterized. The solid-state structures are described below. Structure of [Na2(rctt-cbtc-H2)(H2O)4], (1). For Z = 1 in the triclinic space group P1̅, the asymmetric unit has half of the dimeric repeating unit with the crystallographic center of inversion. The Na1 ion has octahedral core with four bridging water molecules along with a monodentate carboxylate anion and a monodentate carboxylic acid of two diﬀerent cbtc ligands in cis fashion (see Figure 1). The water molecules bridge the Na+ ions to form a [Na(OH2)2] polymer chain along the a-axis, whereas [Na2(rctt-cbtc-H2)] forms a plane approximately in (11̅0) and the combination of these produces a 3D CP. If the Na+ is considered as tetrahedral node and the cbtc as square planar node, then the topological simpliﬁcation by TOPOS16 yields to a binodal (4,4) connected moganite (mog) net where both the metal and ligand node are 4-connected as shown in Figure 1d. The point (Schlaﬂi) symbol for the net is Figure 1.

The Na(I) ions are shown as golden yellow balls, oxygen atoms as red ball and carbon in gray. The C−H hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity in (a), (b), and (c).

This com- pound has the same formula and is isomorphous to 1 crystallized in a triclinic space group P1̅. For Z = 1, 2 also has a crystallographic inversion center in the middle of the Na2(OH2)2 ring. But this [Na2(μ-OH2)2(H2O)2] is a discrete dimer and does not form a one-dimensional (1D) aggregate like 1 as shown in Figure 2a. The Na1−O6···Na1E (symm code for E is 1−x, 2−y, 1−z) distance of 4.06 Å is too far way to bridge the neighboring metal ion. The coordination geometry at Na1 is still octahedral but highly distorted with the oxygen atoms of the two bridging aqua ligands along another one from the terminal aqua ligand and the oxygen atoms from three diﬀerent cbtc ligands in a facial manner. The [Na2(rctt-cbtc- H2)] forms a 14-membered ring in the ab-plane through O2 and O3 atoms as shown in Figure 2b, while connnectivity with O1 and O2 produced an eight-membered ring perpendicular to it producing a 3D coordination polymeric network structure (Figure 2c). The cbtc-H2 is connected to six diﬀerent sodium ions, and the Na+ dimer is simpliﬁed into a single node which is linked through six diﬀerent linkages; thus topology analysis of the 3D structure yielded a 6-connected pcu or, α-Po uninodal net with point (Schlaﬂi) symbol for the whole net as {412.63} (Figure 2d).16 The hydrogen bond parameters are tabulated in Table 3. The two 3D structures 1 and 2 have the same molecular formula but diﬀerent connectivity. Figure 3 gives a detailed comparison on the connectivity of cbtc ligand and coordination environment of Na(I) ions in both cases. They are true supramolecular isomers.7b,c,17 Both were synthesized by similar experimental conditions, but methanol was used instead of ethanol, for 2. Structure of [K2(rctt-cbtc-H2)(H2O)2] (3). For Z = 1 in the triclinic space group P1̅, the dimeric building block in 3 has a crystallographic inversion center. The hepta-coordinated K1 is highly distorted to describe in terms of any ideal geometry. However, the O5B−K1−O2D (symm code for B = −1/2 + x, 3/2 −y, −1/2 + z and D = x, y, −1+ z) and O3C−K1−O4A (symm code for A = 2 −x, 2 −y, 1 −z and C = 3/2 −x, −1/2 + y, 1/2 −z) angles, 170.85(4)° and 140.18(3)°, indicate that it could be well-described as monocapped pentagonal pyramid. The unique K1 is coordinated to two bridging water molecules, one chelating carboxylate of cbtc (O3 and O4), and three Figure 2.

Of the two carboxylates of cbtc, one carboxylate is in the chelating mode, Z, Z-μ2-η2:η1 with O3 atom bridging another K atom, while the second carboxylate O atoms are bonded to two diﬀerent K1 atoms in Z, E-μ2-η2:η1 mode. The aqua ligands bridges K1 to form a 1D aggregate which extends approximately along the [1̅10] axis. The overall structure is of 3D nature considering the connectivity with cbtc. Here if each K represents a six connected node, and cbtc has an eight-centered node, the connectivity can be simpliﬁed by TOPOS15 in terms of (6,8) topology, which does not match any reported in the literature, and the point (Schlaﬂi) symbol for the whole net is {34.46.54.6}2{34.48.512.63.7}.15 Structure of [Ba2(rctt-cbtc)(H2O)6], (4). The asymmetric unit in 4 contains half of the formula in the space group P1̅ with Z = 1. The coordination number of the metal ions increases, as the size of the metal ion increases. Thus, the BA(II) ion in 4 is nine-coordinated with a heavily distorted trigonal prismatic square tricapped18 geometry where it is coordinated to aqua ligands of which two are bridging and are related by the center of inversion. The rest of the coordination sites are satisﬁed by the tetra carboxylate ligand which also has a crystallographic center of inversion. The cbtc anion has two types of carboxylate binding modes, one monodentate μ1-η2 and other one with a chelating and bridging mode, μ2-η2:η1. The Ba1 forms a four-membered Ba2O2 ring with the oxygen atoms of two diﬀerent carboxylates (O1 and O3) forming a 1D chain which extends along a-axis, while the cbtc anion connects these chains through the formation of a seven-membered ring along the c-axis forming a two-dimensional (2D) structure in the ac-plane.

This structure is unique in the sense that three diﬀerent four- membered Ba2O2 rings connect in three directions to produce this 3D architecture. Here also, Ba(II) has a four-connected node and the cbtc ligand has a six-connected node to form a (4,6) connected fsh 3D net where the point (Schlaﬂi) symbol for the whole net is {43.63}2{46.66.83} (as shown in Figure 5).

Growth Des. 2014, 14, 2605−2613 2610 thermal isomerization of rctt-cbtc has not been investigated in the solid-state so far. On the other hand, thermal cleavage of the cyclobutane ring to the oleﬁns has been noted in a few cases.6c,20 Since the CPs have better thermal stability than the organic solids, we have investigated the solid-state thermal reactivity of these compounds. It would be interesting to investigate whether there will be any cleavage of the cyclobutane ring, isomerization, or just decomposition of the compounds 1−4. The weight loss from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 indicated the removal of the coordinated water around 100 °C followed by the decomposition at 230 °C. Hence, 1 was heated at 230 °C for 72 h in air, and the resultant solid was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy in D2O, as identiﬁed by the small endotherm peak observed in the DSC curve (see Supporting Information, Figure S3b). To our surprise, a new chemical shift at 3.13 ppm due to rtct-isomer appeared along with the peak at 3.49 ppm due to C−H proton of the rctt-cbtc.21 Integration of the two peaks showed ∼85% of the isomerization occurred from rctt to rtct isomer as shown in Figure 7, which is optimized from a few trials. Increase in temperature or time did not yield quantitative isomerization. Nevertheless, the pure product 5 was separated by recrystallization from water (see Experimental Section for detailed synthesis). Interestingly, the supra- molecular isomer 2 shows diﬀerent thermal stability, and it is stable only up to 200 °C after dehydration at 100 °C. Consequently, when 2 was heated at 200 °C for 96 h in air, the maximum isomerization at the optimized condition was only 50% (see Supporting Information, Figure S6). This could be due to the extended connectivity of the cyclobutane ligand as compared to 1. Usually, polymorphs are known to exhibit diﬀerences in physical and chemical properties.22 Such observations have been noted only for a few cases in CPs and supramolecular isomers.7a,c,17b,23 Here we encountered yet another example of the supramolecular isomers exhibiting diﬀerence in chemical properties, i.e., thermal isomerization. As the alkali metal ion size increases down the group, the thermal stability of 3 and 4 was found to be better than 1 and 2 due to stronger ionic interactions with the ligand. The solid 3 was found to be stable up to 250 °C after the removal of aqua ligands at 100 °C. The variable temperature powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) studies of 3 indicated that it loses its crystallinity at 205 °C. A maximum isomerization of 83% was observed when 3 was heated at 240 °C for 18 h in air, and conversion of rctt-cbtc to rtct-cbtc isomer was monitored by the small endotherms in the DSC curve (see Supporting Information Figure S7b) and the 1H NMR spectral studies (see Figure 8). On the other hand, the dehydrated 4 is very stable up to 350 °C and did not show any cleavage or isomerization of the cyclobutane ring as investigated by the 1H NMR spectroscopy. The high thermal stability of 4 could be due to the intricate coordination mode of the cbtc ligand with the metal ions. These observations on thermal stability and reactivity studies provided us with a clear relation between the connectivity, thermal stability, and reactivity of coordination polymers in the solid-state. It also suggested that solid-state reactivity can be favored by the metal organic environment as shown in this case where the ligand alone shows less reactivity, whereas the coordination polymer showed enhanced reactivity. As a result, comparatively enhanced thermal stability of the rctt- isomer in the CPs allowed the solid-state transformation as compared to the organic ligand alone. Structure of [Na3(rtct-cbtc-H2)(rtct-cbtc-H3)(H2O)3] (5). The compound 5 after recrystallization has changed its composition, but the isomerization to the rtct-isomer was conﬁrmed by single crystal X-ray crystallography, unequiv- ocally. It crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2/c with Z = 4, and the asymmetric unit contains only half of the formula unit. Further, the cyclobutane has two carboxylic acids ligands (O2 and O4 atoms with hydrogen atoms), and a half hydrogen atom has been assigned to O6 to compensate for 1.5 positive charges due to the extra half Na(I) atom in the asymmetric unit. There are two unique Na(I) atoms in the asymmetric unit and Na1 lies on a 2-fold axis. Both Na1 and Na2 have Figure 6. Isomers of cyclobutane ring.

Growth Des. 2014, 14, 2605−2613 2611 octahedral coordination geometry satisﬁed by two aqua ligands, one axial, the other equatorial in both structures, and the rest of the coordination sites are occupied by the monodentate carboxylate/carboxylic acid ligands. In the cbtc ligand, two carboxylates coordinate in a monodentate η1 fashion, whereas the third one although monodentate coordinates in η2 mode and the fourth one coordinates in a bidentate μ2-η2:η1 mode. The presence of half H atoms in O6 produces O6−H6···O6A (symmetry code A = −x, y, 1/2−z). The 3D structure present in 5 can be simpliﬁed with the help of topological analysis which shows (4,5,6) connected trinodal net where Na1 was simpliﬁed to a four-connected node, Na2 to a six-connected node and the cbtc ligand to a ﬁve-connected node. This topology appears to be new and was not found in the list of known structures with a point (Schlaﬂi) symbol for the whole net as {3.44.53.62}2{3.44.53.66.7}2{32.5.62.7}.15 ■CONCLUSION The solid-state structures of the coordination polymers of rctt- cbtc with selected alkali and alkali metal ions have been investigated. They form interesting but complicated 3D structures with diverse coordination modes. Structures of 1 and 2 belong to mog and pcu topology, respectively. The connectivity in 3 is made up of (6,8) nets, while 4 is based on (4,6) connected fsh net. Thermal isomerization occurs when these solids were heated in air to above 200 °C. The rctt-isomer cleanly isomerized to the more stable rtct-isomer, but no quantitative conversion was achieved as monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Despite higher thermal stability up to 350 °C after the removal of aqua ligands, no isomerization of the cyclobutane ring in 4 was observed. This has been attributed to the strong and intricate coordination mode of the cbtc ligand with the BA(II) ions with higher coordination number. It is likely that higher coordination number and very strong metal− ligand bonds may not be suitable for solid-state thermal isomerization process. More work is needed to establish a facile conversion of these stereoisomers of cyclobutane in the solid- state which might prove to be a useful route to access diﬀerent isomers of cyclobutane derivatives. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Selected bonding parameters, experimental details, 1H NMR, PXRD, TGA, and DSC data for the compounds.

Figure S9: Variable Temperature Powder X-ray Diffraction (VTPXRD) of 3 Thus, powder X-ray data collected for 3 at 60°C was found to be different from the room temperature (RT) phase and interestingly this phase was found to be reversible ie, once cooled back to RT it regained the original RT phase. As 3 maintained its single crystallinity, X-ray diffraction data was collected while heating it at 60°C to account for the phase transformation observed. The cell at 60°C was found to be very different from the original but once collected the complete data set the data could be solved only in the orginal space group and the surprsingly the structure came out to be the same. As this intermediate phase might influence the isomerization mechanism studied below it would be very interesting to look at this intermediate phase. This baffling result prompted the collaboration with a PXRD expert to solve the structure using powder pattern and the study is still on-going. 11 a) b) Figure S10: a) TGA and b) DSC of [Ba2(rctt-cbtc)(H2O)6] (4).

The reaction was monitored by 1H-NMR spectroscopy which showed a downfield shift of two chemically equivalent ethylene protons at 6.34 ppm to 3.71 ppm upon dimerization of maleic anhydride. The dimerized product was hydrolyzed in concentrated HCl but the 1H-NMR showed the peak having the same chemical shift as the anhydride dimer. Therefore, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) had to be carried out for the hydrolyzed compound and it matches well with the reported one in the literature.
