China * S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Two microporous cadmium(II) metal−organic frameworks, [Cd(cptpy)(Ac)(H2O)·(DMA)(H2O)]n (1) and [Cd(cptpy)2·(DMF)2]n (2) (Hcptpy = 4-(4-carboxyphenyl)- 2,2′:4′,4″-terpyridine, DMA = N,N-dimethylacetamide, DMF = dimethylformamide) have been solvothermally synthesized under diﬀerent reaction conditions. Complex 1 is a double-interpenetrating 3D network, while 2 is a noninterpenetrating (3,5)- connected 2D framework. The dehydrated forms of compounds 1 and 2 exhibit selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 and H2O over CH3OH. In addition, the adsorption value of CO2 for 2 is higher than that of 1. The contents of uncoordinated pyridine nitrogen (Lewis basic sites) per formula unit of 1 and 2 are 2.16 and 4.36%, respectively. Obviously, the grafting of more uncoordinated pyridine nitrogen into compound 2 could enhance adsorption of the acidic CO2 molecule. Notably, both 1 and 2 display strong photoluminescence. The nature of electronic transitions for complex 1 in the photoluminescent process was investigated by means of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations and molecular orbital analyses, which collaborates that the luminescent property is ligand-based. ■INTRODUCTION Over the past few years, microporous metal−organic frame- works (MMOFs) have attracted great attention owing to their aesthetic framework structures and exceptional properties such as gas storage/separation and catalysis.1 In the design and synthesis of such porous materials with new structures and permanent porosity, multicarboxylate linkers are widely used as bridging ligands due to the high thermal and chemical stabilities of the carboxylate−metal fragment.2 However, controllable synthesis of MOFs is a great challenge because many factors may aﬀect self-assembly of them, such as the chemical structure of the ligands chosen,3a the coordination geometry preferred by the metal,3b reaction temperature, the counterions,3c the solvent system,3d pH value,3e the metal-to-ligand ratio,3f and the methods of the crystallization,3g leading to their structural and dimensional variations.4 In contrast to plentiful research in bridging carboxylic acid, elongated bridging pyridyl carboxylic acids undertaken in MMOFs remains largely unexplored.5 We have, therefore, investigated a newly designed polytopic ligand with three pyridyl donors and one carboxylic group, namely 4-(4- carboxyphenyl)-2,2′:4′,4″-terpyridine (Hcptpy), in the syn- thesis of novel MMOFs (Scheme 1). Ligand Hcptpy is a particularly eﬀective building block because (1) it has many potential coordination modes, allowing for the construction of a topologically diverse family of materials, (2) it is rigid, which helps enable the preparation of permanently porous materials, and (3) it is an ideal building block for constructing materials for CO2 capture. Hcptpy’s multiple Lewis basic sites (pyridine nitrogens), can interact with CO2, potentially resulting in materials with high CO2 adsorption energies. In this contribution, two porous cadmium(II) frameworks, [Cd- (cptpy)(Ac)(H2O)·(DMA)(H2O)]n (1) (DMA = N,N-dime- thylacetamide) and [Cd(cptpy)2·(DMF)2]n (2) (DMF = dimethylformamide) have been obtained and characterized. Complex 1 is a double-interpenetrating 3D network with (10,3)-b topology, while 2 is a noninterpenetrating (3,5)- connected 2D framework. The gas or vapor sorption behaviors as well as the solid luminescent property of 1 and 2 have been studied in detail. Furthermore, the nature of electronic transitions for complex 1 in the photoluminescent process was investigated by means of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations and molecular orbital analyses.

Growth Des. 2012, 12, 4083−4089 ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials and Measurements. Reagents and solvents as well as ligand Hcptpy employed were commercially available and used as received. C, H, and N microanalyses were carried out with a Perkin- Elmer 240 elemental analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on KBr discs on a Bruker Vector 22 spectrophotometer in 4000−400 cm−1 region. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed on a simultaneous SDT 2960 thermal analyzer under ﬂowing N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C/ min between ambient temperature and 700 °C. The powder XRD data were collected on a Siemens D5005 diﬀractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418 Å) over the 2θ range of 5−50° at room temperature. Fluorescence measurements were recorded with a Hitachi 850 ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer. Gas Adsorption Measurement. Nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methanol (CH3OH), and H2O sorption experiments were carried out on a BELSORP-max volumetric gas sorption instrument. Prior to the measurement, the samples were treated using the following procedure. The as-synthesized samples of 1 and 2 were immersed in fresh distilled methanol for 4 days to remove the nonvolatile solvates (DMA or DMF and H2O), and the extract was decanted every day and fresh methanol was replaced. Then they were activated by drying under a dynamic vacuum at 150 °C overnight. Before the measurement, the samples were dried again by using the “degas” function of the surface area analyzer for 10 h at 150 °C. Computational Procedures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the electronic ground states and time-dependent DFT calculations in the singlet states were carried out by the Gaussian 03 program6 with the B3LYP hybrid functional.7 “Double-ξ” quality basis set LANL2DZ, which uses Duning D95 V basis set on ﬁrst row atoms, and Los Alamos ECP plus DZ on Na−Bi, was employed as the basis set. Synthesis of [Cd(cptpy)(Ac)(H2O)·(DMA)(H2O)]n (1). A mixture of Cd(Ac)2·2H2O (26.7 mg, 0.10 mmol) and Hcptpy (17.7 mg, 0.05 mmol) in 3.0 mL of DMA−H2O (1:1 volume ratio) was placed in a parr Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 cm3), and then the vessel was sealed and heated at 100 °C for 2 days. After the mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature, colorless plate crystals of 1 were obtained (yield: 70% based on Cd). Anal. Calcd For C28H30CdN4O7: C, 51.98; H, 4.67; N, 8.66%.

A mixture of Cd- (NO3)2·4H2O (30.7 mg, 0.1 mmol), Hcptpy (35.3 mg, 0.10 mmol), and 4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid) (25.5 mg, 0.1 mmol) in 3.0 mL of DMF−H2O (1:1 volume ratio) was heated at 130 °C for 2 days analogous to the procedure for 1.

Suitable single crystals of 1 and 2 were selected and mounted in air onto thin glass ﬁbers. X-ray intensity data for 1 were collected on a Rigaku Saturn 724+ CCD X-ray diﬀractometer with graphite monochromatic Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 173 K. CrystalClear software (Rigaku Inc., 2007) was used for data reduction and empirical absorption correction. 2 was measured at room temperature on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD- based diﬀractometer with graphite-monochromatic Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data reductions and absorption corrections were performed with the SAINT and SADABS software packages, respectively.8 The structures of all the crystals were solved by direct method using SHELXS-979 and developed by conventionally alternating cycles of least-squares reﬁnement on F2 (SHELXL-97)10 and diﬀerent Fourier synthesis. All the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. The hydrogen atom positions were generated theoretically, allowed to ride on their respective parent atoms and included in the structure factor calculations with assigned isotropic thermal parameters. The solvent DMA and DMF molecules in 1 and 2 are disordered into two positions. For 2, the disordered C18/C19/ C22/C23 atoms of benzene rings were restrained in order to obtain reasonable thermal parameters. Crystallographic data and other pertinent information for 1−2 are summarized in Table 1, while the selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. More details on the crystallographic studies as well as atom displacement parameters are presented in the CIF. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Description of the Crystal Structures. The asymmetric unit in 1 consists of one cptpy−anion, one cadmium(II) ion, one coordinated water molecule, one coordinated Ac−anion, one disordered guest DMA, and one lattice water molecule (Supporting Information Figure S1a). As shown in Figure 1a, the Cd(II) is seven-coordinated in a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry, the basal positions are occupied by four oxygen atoms of two carboxylate groups adopting μ1-η1:η1 from Table 1.

The apical position are occupied by one coordinated water and one cptpy−nitrogen atom. The Cd−O and Cd−N bond lengths are in the range of 2.300(9)− 2.510(6) Å and 2.325(10)−2.374(6) Å, respectively, which are in good agreement with previous studies.11 In 1, on the one hand, each cptpy−ligand binds to three Cd(II) via one carboxylate and the two outer pyridyl donors, leaving the inner pyridyl amine unbound (Supporting Information Figure S1b); on the other hand, each cadmium(II) in turns to connect three cptpy−fragments, resulting in a three- dimensional (3D) porous structure with large hexagonal cavities of approximately 16.60 × 15.14 × 12.61 Å3 (based on C···C or C···O distance) along b and c axes, as presented in Figure 1b. Careful examination indicated that both cptpy− ligands and Cd(II) centers serve as topologically equivalent three-connected nodes. Thus 1 is a uniform three-connected net with extended Schläﬂi symbol of 102 × 104 × 104, which is assigned to the (10,3)-b topology according to Wells’ classiﬁcation12 or the ths net (Figure 1d).13 The large voids formed by a single 3D network allow incorporation of another identical network. Therefore, the eventual structure of 1 is a doubly interpenetrating 3D framework belonging to class IIa (Figure 1c). The value of PICVR corresponds to the translational degree interpenetration Zt and Z = Zn = 2.14 Despite the framework interpenetration, the 1D channel with a cross section of ca. 5.74 × 3.57 Å2 with consideration of van der Waals radii along b direction in 1 was observed (Supporting Information Figure S1c). The structure retains 27.8% solvent accessible void volume (1534.5 out of the 5520.0 Å3 unit cell volume), where guest DMA and water molecules reside as labile ligands. As anticipated, the lattice water molecule (O2W) are attached to the main backbone through stronger hydrogen bonds with the coordinated oxygen atoms (O4 and O2#1), with distance varying from 2.803(17) to 2.870(13) Å. In addition, the DMA guest solvent (O1S#3, symmetry codes for #3: 2 −x, y, 3/2 −z) form weaker hydrogen bonds with aromatic C4−H4 function of cptpy−moiety, with separation of 3.43(2) Å. These weak interactions play important roles in the stabilization of the crystal structure of 1. The asymmetric unit in 2 consists of two cptpy−anion, one cadmium(II) ion, and two guest DMA molecules (Supporting Information Figure S2a). The Cd(II) is seven-coordinated in a single-capped octahedral geometry, deﬁned by four oxygen atoms of two carboxylate groups adopting μ1-η1:η1 from two cptpy−anions and three nitrogen atoms from diﬀerent cptpy− moieties (Figure 2a). In 2, two crystallographically independent cptpy−anions present diﬀerent bridging modes (Supporting Information Figure S2b). One adopts the same μ3-coordination mode to that in 1, and the other bridges two cadmium ions as a linear linker, thus giving rise to a 2D coordination network of 2, as shown in Figure 2b. For better insight into the intricate polymeric framework of compound 2, topological analysis is completed. Cd1 atom can be simply considered as a node linking two Cd1 atoms and three μ3-bridged cptpy−anions, whereas each μ3-bridged cptpy−anion in turn acts as the other node connecting three Cd1 atoms. It is clear that the resulting structure of 2 exhibits a 2D binodal (3,5)-connected net with the Schläﬂi symbol of (526)(55647), as illustrated in Figure 2c. In contrast to the extensive investigations on (3,5)-connected 3D coordination networks,15 there have been only a few on (3,5)-connected 2D networks.16 Within the 2D structure, there are 1D channels with the eﬀective cavity size being ca. 8.37 × 5.63 Å2 and 8.15 × 6.09 Å2 with consideration of van der Waals radii along a or c directions in 2 (Supporting Information Figures S2c and S2d), which are full of free DMF molecules. A calculation using PLATON led to a potential solvent area of 2607.5 Å3 per unit cell volume of 9162.0 Å3 in 2, namely 28.5% of the total crystal volume. The DMF guest solvent (O6, C49) form weaker hydrogen bonds, respectively, with aromatic C10−H10 function and carboxylate oxygen (O1#4, symmetry codes for Figure 1.

From 1 to 2, the dramatic structural change observed clearly results from the distinct coordination environment of cadmium(II) centers and the diﬀerent bridging modes adopted by cptpy−anion. It is well-known that diﬀerent structural motifs generated under diﬀerent reaction conditions, such as in the cases of 1 and 2, changing the reaction temperatures from 100 to 130 °C, varying the counterions from Ac−to NO3 −, and converting the metal-to-ligand ratio from 2:1 to 1:1. In addition, it is noticeable that in the synthesis of 2, the addition of 4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid) is essential for the formation of 2 even though is not incorporated into the crystal structure. In the absence of 4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid), resulting polycrystal- line samples could not be identiﬁed. It is clear that 4,4′- oxybis(benzoic acid) may play template eﬀect in the formation of 2. Unfortunately, the precise mechanism and roles of 4,4′- oxybis(benzoic acid) have not been determined. Thermal Stability and Powder X-ray Diﬀraction (PXRD). Compound 1 shows the weight loss (16.20%) below 228 °C, corresponding to the release of one lattice water and one DMA molecule (calcd 16.23%). The decomposition of residual composition occurs beyond 228 °C. Compound 2 shows a two-step weight loss of 15.27% below 211 °C ascribed to the loss of two DMF molecules (calcd 15.15%). The dehydrated phase remains stable up to 340 °C until the organic ligands start to be released, exhibiting high thermal stability. The phase purity of the bulk material was independently conﬁrmed by powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD). The PXRD patterns after CO2 adsorption of 1 and 2 still match well with the simulated forms, showing that the framework structures of the two complexes remain stable. Sorption Properties. The sorption measurements of 1 and 2 for CO2 gave typical type I isotherms for microporous materials. Complex 1 shows adsorption amount of CO2 at 195 K and 1 atm (40.70 cm3 g−1 at STP, 7.99 wt %), corresponding to 1 CO2 molecule per formula unit (Figure 3a). Under the Figure 2.

CO2 (195 K) and N2 (77K) sorption isotherms for compounds 1 (a) and 2 (b). Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg300566x | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 4083−4089 4086 same conditions, complex 2 exhibits comparatively high uptake of CO2 (83.14 cm3 g−1 at STP, 16.33 wt %), corresponding to 3.5 CO2 molecule per formula unit (Figure 3b). The CO2 uptakes of both complexes 1 and 2 are nearly 3 times higher than those of N2 (12.48 cm3 g−1 for 1 and 30.38 cm3 g−1 for 2 at STP) at 77 K. The BET surface areas estimated from the CO2 adsorption isotherm is 90 and 151.12 m2 g−1 for 1 and 2, respectively. The adsorption value of CO2 for 2 is higher than those of tris-o-phenylene-dioxycyclotriphosphazene containing 1D channels (60.5 cm3 g−1 at STP) and of SNU-15′ (78.02 cm3 g−1 at STP),17 as well as comparable to that of 2D framework [Co(dcpy)(bipy)0.5(H2O)]·2H2O (80 cm3 g−1 at STP, H2dcpy = 3-(2′,5′-dicarboxylphenyl)pyridine, bipy = 4,4′-bipyridine).18 In contrast, the resulting N2 adsorption isotherms for 1 and 2 are also shown in Figure 3, which is a characteristic type-H3 sorption behavior.19 Furthermore, hysteresis was also observed between the adsorption−desorption curves. The result implies that only surface adsorption has occurred, indicating that nitrogen molecules can not diﬀuse into the channels at this temperature. Therefore, the distinct diﬀerence of adsorption capacity between CO2 and N2 were found for both 1 and 2. We conclude that 1 and 2 may have potential application in the separation of CO2/N2 mixtures. The selective sorption of CO2 over N2 gases may be attributed to the smaller kinetic diameters of CO2 than that of N2 (CO2, 3.3; N2, 3.6 Å). Additionally, the selective sorption of CO2 rather than N2 gas can also be attributed to the high quadrupole moment of CO2 (−1.4 × 10−39 cm2) in comparison with that of N2 (−4.7 × 10−40 cm2), which induces speciﬁc interactions with the host framework.20 Signiﬁcantly, the contents of uncoordinated pyridine nitrogen (Lewis basic sites) per formula unit of 1 and 2 are 2.16 and 4.36%, respectively. Obviously, the grafting of more uncoordi- nated pyridine nitrogen into compound 2 could enhance adsorption of the acidic CO2 molecule. Given the favorable CO2 capturing property of 1 and 2, we further studied their storage capacity for the attractive energy carrier gas hydrogen. Compound 1 absorbs H2 up to 0.22 wt % at 77 K and 1 atm (Figure 4). The hydrogen gas adsorption isotherm for 1 is prominent at the low pressure region, indicating the strong interaction between relatively small pores and H2 molecules, under the same conditions, but almost no H2 adsorption was observed for 2. In addition, 1 and 2 were also subjected to vapor adsorption. At 298 K, 1 adsorbs large volumes of H2O (249 cm3 g−1) and CH3OH (117 cm3 g−1) at 1 atm (Figure 5). Interestingly, the sorption isotherms of H2O and CH3OH for 1 demonstrate rapid uptake until ∼0.10 atm and after that sorption increases linearly with elevated pressure and exhibits large hysteresis. A rapid increase in the amount of adsorbed vapor under low pressure indicates the diﬀusion of adsorbates into the channels. For 2, the isotherms of H2O show a three-step adsorption proﬁle. At 298 K, about 70 cm3 g−1 H2O is adsorbed in the ﬁrst step (up to 0.3 atm). In the second step, about 133 cm3 g−1 H2O is taken up in the pressure range of 0.3−0.8 atm. In the ﬁnal step, the H2O uploading reaches 205 cm3 g−1 at 1 atm. Compound 2 displays steep uptake of CH3OH molecules at low pressure region, and the adsorption capacity for CH3OH is only 50 cm3 g−1 at 298 K and 1 atm. Approximately 7.2 H2O and 5.0 CH3OH molecules are adsorbed about per formula unit for 1 and those for 2 are 8.8 and 2.1, respectively. Therefore, complexes 1 and 2 also have highly selective adsorption of H2O over CH3OH, which should be ascribed to the diﬀerent kinetic diameters of these molecules (H2O, 2.68 Å; CH3OH 3.8 Å).21 Fluorescence Properties. The solid-state luminescence of complexes 1 and 2 as well as the free ligand has been investigated at room temperature, which is shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that the free ligand Hcptpy exhibits a main emission band at 386 nm with excitation at 329 nm. Emission bands were observed at 386 and 388 nm for 1 and 2, which is neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to- metal charge transfer (LMCT) in nature, because the Cd2+ ion is diﬃcult to oxidize or to reduce due to its d10 conﬁguration. It may be assigned to the intraligand (π−π*) ﬂuorescent emission because similar emissions are observed for the free ligand.22 Figure 4. H2 (77K) sorption isotherms for compound 1. Figure 5. Solvent vapor adsorption and desorption isotherms of 1 (a) and 2 (b) at 298 K. Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg300566x | Cryst. Growth Des. 2012, 12, 4083−4089 4087 Compared with the emission of the free ligand, the enhance- ment of that in complexes 1 and 2 may be ascribed to the increase in the conformational rigidity of the ligand, which is due to their coordination to Cd(II) ion resulting in a decrease in the nonradiative decay of intraligand excited states.23 To better understand the nature of the luminescent emission, time-dependent density functional theory calculations and molecular orbital analyses for complex 1 were carried out to investigate the electron transitions in the photoluminescent process. The related mononuclear species [Cd(Hcptpy)(Py)- (Ba)(Ac)] (Py = pyridine, Ba = benzoic acid) ground-state geometry adapted from the truncated X-ray data were used to calculate and evaluate their electronic structure and ground- state properties. The results indicate that the lowest energy emission of complex 1 is dominated by the transitions of LUMO →HOMO. With respect to 1, HOMO are mostly composed of π orbitals of three pyridine rings of Hcptpy, and LUMO mainly consist of π* orbitals of two pyridine rings and one benzoic acid of Hcptpy (Figure 7). The energy gap between the frontier orbitals is 3.14 eV, which compares well with the corresponding experimental value of 3.21 eV (386 nm). The result demonstrates that the luminescent emission of 1 is an intraligand charge transfer (ILCT character), which agrees well with the experiment result. ■CONCLUSION Two microporous cadmium(II) metal−organic frameworks polymorphs, [Cd(cptpy)(Ac)(H2O)·(DMA)(H2O)]n (1) and [Cd(cptpy)2·(DMF)2]n (2) have been solvothermally synthe- sized under diﬀerent reaction conditions. Complex 1 is a double-interpenetrating 3D network with ths topology, while 2 is a noninterpenetrating (3,5)-connected 2D framework. The dehydrated forms of compounds 1 and 2 show selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 and H2O over CH3OH. The results of the present study provide two nice examples of MMOFs with interesting properties of highly selective sorption for speciﬁc molecules. Equally interestingly, the adsorption value of CO2 for 2 is higher than that of 1. The contents of uncoordinated pyridine nitrogen (Lewis basic sites) per formula unit of 1 and 2 are 2.16 and 4.36%, respectively. Obviously, the grafting of more uncoordinated pyridine nitrogen into compound 2 could enhance adsorption of the acidic CO2 molecule. Notably, both 1 and 2 display strong photo- luminescence. The nature of electronic transitions for complex 1 in the photoluminescent process was investigated by means of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations and molecular orbital analyses, which verify that the luminescent property is ligand-based. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Additional crystal ﬁgures, TGA, and PXRD for complexes 1 and 2 (PDF and CIF).
