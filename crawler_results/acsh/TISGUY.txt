The framework components undergo dynamic structural transformation in response to removal and rebinding of the suitable guest molecules. Microporous metal–organic framework (MOF) materials have received increasing attention mainly because of their potential application in adsorption, ion exchange, and catalysis, as well as intriguing architectures and topologies.1,2 In particular, dynamic porous MOF materials retain crystallinity after some structural transformations, including stretching, rotational, “breathing”, and scissoring mechanisms, responding to external stimuli, which is essentially distinct from that of the rigid classical porous materials.3 Those reversibly dynamic structural changes, being induced by removal/readsorption of guest molecules and/or caused by the removal/addition of ligands from/to the host framework itself, may be used for the accommodation and separation of speciﬁc molecules. However, it is still a challenge to control the pore size and chemical characteristics of the internal surface as well as decorate the topology of dynamic porous MOF materials.4 A promising route to such materials is the rational choice of suitable inorganic compositions as secondary building units (SBUs) and ﬂexible organic ligands as the spacers. 1,1′-Biphenyl-2,2′-dicarboxylic acid (H2dpa) is an effective twisted aromatic dicarboxylate ligand, in which the phenyl rings can rotate around the C–C bond.5,6 Here, we report a new microporous MOF material with mixed ﬂexible dpa and rigid pyrazine (pyz) ligands, [Ni4(dpa)4(pyz)4- (H2O)8]·11H2O (1), which can be dehydrated to give new solid- phase [Ni4(dpa)4(pyz)4] (1′). 1′ exhibits not only permanent microporosity but also dynamic structural transformation triggered by the removal/readsorption of guest molecules. Compound 1 was prepared by the hydrothermal reaction of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, H2dpa, pyz, KOH, and H2O in the molar ratio of 3:2:1:6:1111 at 175 °C (see the Supporting Information). X-ray structural analysis reveals that there are two crystallo- graphically unique NiII ions (Ni1 and Ni2) in the asymmetric unit with similar coordination environments (Figure 1) and that each nickel ion is in a N2O4 octahedral coordination environment surrounded by two trans-related oxygen atoms from different bis- monodentate dpa ligands [Ni–O ) 2.046(3)-2.091(3) Å], two cis- related pyz ligands [Ni–N ) 2.083(4)–2.132(4) Å], and two cis- related water molecules [Ni–Oaqua ) 2.031(4)–2.095(4) Å]. Both carboxylate groups of a dpa ligand are approximately perpendicular to each other [91.619(4)°] to form a L-shaped coordination vector.5,6 Four nickel ions are bridged by four L-shaped dpa ligands to form a quasi-planar 36-membered Ni4(dpa)4 macrocycle (Scheme 1). The intracycle adjacent and opposite Ni· · ·Ni distances are 6.942 and 7.079 Å and 9.464 and 10.346 Å, respectively. It is remarkable that all aqua ligands point toward the center of the Ni4(dpa)4 circle, forming a hydrophilic cavity (Figure S1 in the Supporting Informa- tion). Each Ni4(dpa)4 cyclic unit connects eight neighboring ones by eight µ-pyz spacers with the intercycle shortest Ni· · ·Ni distances of 6.939 and 7.051 Å, forming a new three-dimensional (3D) MOF with 1D channels along the c axis (Figure 2a). The diagonal lengths and effective window size of the channels are ca. 4.33 × 4.10 and 2.99 × 3.78 Å, respectively, taking into account the van der Waals radii for constituent atoms. The Vvoid of 1′ (without guest and aqua ligands) is 22.1% as calculated by PLATON.7 The 11 water guest molecules per molecular formula determined by the X-ray single- crystal diffraction analysis and following thermalgravimetric analy- sis (TGA) are located in the hydrophilic channels. One-dimensional hydrogen-bonded water columns with fused 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 10- membered cyclic water cluster units are formed among the lattice and coordinated water molecules via plentiful hydrogen-bonding interactions (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). New water clusters have received scientiﬁc interest for their unusual properties in many physical, chemical, and biological processes.8 * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN 2007 VOL. 7, NO. 11 2286–2289 10.1021/cg070602v CCC: $37.00 2007 American Chemical Society Published on Web 09/26/2007 The coordination network of 1 can be simpliﬁed as a uninodal 4.65 topology (the long symbol is 4·62·6·6·6·6) by considering the NiII ions as tetrahedral nodes and the dpa and pyz ligands as linkers. It is interesting to note that this quasi-regular topological net is homeomorphic to that of BCT zeolite and CrB4 (Figure 2b), which is rarely found in MOF materials9 because the common networks with tetrahedral nodes are diamond or quartz nets. The thermal stability of 1 was examined by TGA and variable- temperature powder X-ray diffraction (VTPXRD). The TG curve exhibits two signiﬁcant mass changes over the temperature range of 25–220 °C (Figure 3). A ﬁrst weight loss of 10.5% (calcd 10.7%) occurs below 75 °C and corresponds to the loss of lattice water in the channels. The departure of the coordinated water molecules occurs between 75 and 120 °C (found, 7.4%; calculated, 7.7%). The host MOF of 1′ starts to decompose up to 220 °C. VTPXRD studies (inset of Figure 3) show that 1 is stable up to 220 °C and crystallinity is retained upon the loss of all water molecules. The XRD patterns recorded between 25 and 70 °C show no evident changes, which could be associated with the removal of guest water molecules. The XRD patterns recorded above 120 °C show that a few new diffraction peaks at 2θ ) 6.9, 14.8, 15.2, and 17.3° appeared and the diffraction peak 2θ ) 8.6 (120) disappeared, although most other diffraction peaks could be observed up to 220 °C with the removal of eight coordinated water molecules. These observations suggest that the departure of aqua ligands is followed by a signiﬁcant structural deformation, which should be ascribed to the local distortion of the coordination environments around the Ni ions. The possibility of rearrangement of the coordination geometry of NiII from octahedron to square can be ruled out because both carboxylate groups are coordinated in trans positions and are rather difﬁcult to adjust to be in cis positions in the 3D MOF structure. Therefore, adjusting the coordination mode of the carboxylate groups from former mono- dentate to chelate to complete a distorted octahedral coordination sphere is most likely. Above 220 °C, the departure of the organic moieties leads to the collapse of the framework, and the resulting amorphous phase crystallizes at higher temperatures to give NiO.10 The phenomenon of signiﬁcant positional and rotational re- arrangements of the MOF components upon external stimuli has received much attention.11 Enlightened by the results of TG and VTPXRD studies on the reversible hydration–dehydration process between 1 and 1′,12 we measured the adsorption properties of porous phase 1′ with different guests to investigate the details of the structural changes induced by the removal/readsorption of coordi- nated water molecules.

Communications Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 7, No. 11, 2007 2287 Figure 4 shows the adsorption isotherms for the different adsorbates. The adsorption isotherm of H2O shows the anticipated behavior. Below a speciﬁc pressure (P/P0 ) 0.18), the amount adsorbed in the micropore increases slightly from 0 to 42.3 mL/g (2.9 H2O molecules per formula unit for 1′). Above the speciﬁc pressure, the amount adsorbed increases suddenly to 190.5 mL/g at P/P0 ) 0.25 (12.9 H2O molecules per formula unit). Finally, the isotherm reaches the saturation point of approximately 243.6 mL/g (16.5 H2O molecules per formula unit). A similar sorption phenomenon was also observed for the use of MeOH as the adsorbate at 298 K. The isotherm shows an abrupt rise at P/P0 ) 0.5 and reaches 124.5 mL/g (8.4 MeOH molecules per formula unit) at P/P0 ) 0.52. Finally, the isotherm reaches the saturation point of approximately 163.5 mL/g (11.1 MeOH molecules per formula unit). Such adsorption behaviors of H2O and MeOH are typical of an adsorption process in which a guest-induced phase transition takes place.13 This characteristic adsorption proﬁle supports the conversion of a phase 1′ to a phase 1, with some of the water molecules chemically binding to Ni centers and the dpa ligands going back into their former positions (Scheme 2). The absorption amount of acetone and CO2 is small, and there is no evident structural change that can be evaluated from the isotherms. The steep rise in the adsorption isotherm of CO2 (20.4 mL/g) was observed at extremely low pressures relative to the saturation vapor pressure of CO2 (P/P0 ) 0.02), and this initial uptake indicates the presence of intrinsic micropores in [Ni4(dpa)4(pyz)4] (1′). The maximum adsorbed amount of CO2 is about 37.1 mL/g at P/P0 ) 0.95 and 2.5 molecules per formula unit. The adsorption isotherm for Me2CO is a typical physical adsorption. Me2CO cannot be adsorbed apparently because its kinetic diameter (6.60 × 4.13 × 5.23 Å) is greater than the effective pore window size. Such selectivity for different adsorbates (H2O, MeOH, CO2, and Me2CO) is excellent for porous metal–organic frameworks, which may arise from the differentiations on size or chemical characteristics on host–guest interactions. In summary, we have constructed a new dynamic microporous MOF material with 1D hydrophilic channels and rare BCT zeolite net topology by using ﬂexible dpa ligand and rigid pyrazine spacers. The activated phase 1′ obtained by removal of the guest and coordinated water molecules functions as a dynamic microporous MOF material responding to H2O and MeOH, as evidenced by TGA, high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HTXRD), and gas/solvent adsorption studies.

Gas adsorption measurement. The sorption isotherm measurements for CO2, Me2CO, H2O and MeOH were carried out at 195 K and 298 K respectively by using an automatic volumetric adsorption apparatus (BELSORP 18; BEL inc). A known weight (70-100 mg) of the as-synthesized sample was dried under high vacuum at 383 K for 12 h to remove the solvated and coordinated water molecules. The adsorbate was placed into the sample tube, then the change of pressure was monitored and the degree of adsorption was determined by the decrease of the pressure at the equilibrium state.
