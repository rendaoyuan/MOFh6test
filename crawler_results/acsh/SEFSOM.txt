China ReceiVed September 7, 2005; ReVised Manuscript ReceiVed NoVember 3, 2005 ABSTRACT: Four novel interesting cadmium(II) or zinc(II) metal coordination polymers, [Cd2(2,3-pydc)2(bix)3‚2H2O]n (1), [Cd2- (µ2-OH2)(2,6-pydc)2(bix)]n (2), [Cd3(SIP)2(bix)4‚8H2O]n (3), and [Zn2(SIP)(bix)3(OH)‚2H2O]n (4) (bix ) 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)- benzene; 2,3-pydc ) pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid; 2,6-pydc ) pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid; SIP ) 5-sulfoisophthalic acid monosodium salt), have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions and structurally characterized. Polymer 1 features a 3D porous framework with uncoordinated water molecules trapped in the pores. Polymer 2 is a 2D infinite layer framework, and the resulting 2D structure is interconnected by hydrogen-bond interactions to lead to a 3D supramolecular architecture. Polymer 3 also possesses a 3D porous framework; the most prominent cavities are parallel to the a- and b- directions and are filled with free water molecules. Polymer 4 exhibits 4-fold interpenetration related by three different translation vectors. These four compounds exhibit strong fluorescent emissions in the solid state at room temperature and could be significant in the field of photoactive materials. Introduction The rational design, synthesis, and characterization of novel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been of great current research interest, not only because of their intriguing variety of architectures and topologies1 but also because of their potential applications such as magnetism, electric conductivity, molecular adsorption, and heterogeneous catalysis.2,3 Searching for new assemblies of porous materials from organic ligands and metal- ion building blocks to generate desired supramolecular archi- tectures is one of the great challenges in this area.4-6 Because of the diversity of the coordination modes and high structural stability, the multidentate O-donor organic aromatic polycarboxylate ligands, such as 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate, and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate have been extensively employed in the construction of a rich variety of high-dimensional structures.7,8 In contrast, as members of the aromatic multicarboxylate ligands containing N-donors or sulfonate moiety, pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (2,3-pydc) and pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (2,6-pydc), as well as 5-sul- foisophthalic acid monosodium salt (SIP), have been still rarely reported.9-11 To better understand the coordination chemistry of 2,3-pydc, 2,6-pydc, and SIP and, in addition, to prepare novel materials with beautiful architecture and good physical proper- ties, we start to elaborate new high-dimensional coordination polymers constructed from the three polycarboxylate ligands. With the introduction of a N-containing auxiliary ligand, highly flexible imidazole-based 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-benzene (bix), into {M-polycarboxylate} (M ) Zn2+, Cd2+), four new MOFs have been obtained. In the present paper, we report four interesting coordination polymeric complexes, [Cd2(2,3-pydc)2- (bix)3‚2H2O]n (1), [Cd2(µ2-OH2)(2,6-pydc)2(bix)]n (2), [Cd3(SIP)2- (bix)4‚8H2O]n (3), and [Zn2(SIP)(bix)3(OH)‚2H2O]n (4). In parti- cular, d10 center metals and the conjugated π systems containing aromatic rings favor the development of fluorescent materi- als.12,13 Experimental Section Materials and Physical Measurement.

X-ray Crystallography. Intensity data for the four compounds were collected at 293(2) K on a Siemens SMART-CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromatic Mo KR radiation (λ ) 0.710 73 Å). Data reductions and absorption corrections were performed with the SAINT and SADABS software packages, respectively. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-9715 and were refined by full matrix least-squares methods using SHELXL-97.16 Anisotropic dis- placement parameters were refined for all non-hydrogen atoms except for the disordered atoms. The hydrogen atoms except for those of water molecules were generated geometrically and refined using a riding model. The positions of the disordered water molecules were refined at half site occupancy. Crystallographic data and other pertinent information for 1-4 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table 2. More details on the crystal- lographic studies, as well as atom displacement parameters, are given in the Supporting Information. The pore volumes of the frameworks were calculated by using the program PLATON; the guest molecules and hydroxyl anion moieties were omitted in these calculations.17 Results and Discussion Syntheses. Although compounds 1-4 have been prepared with molar ratio 1:1:1 for metal salts/bix/aromatic polycarboxyl- ate, to our surprise, the isolated compounds always have different stoichiometry. Both bix and the sodium salts of aromatic polycarboxylate have good solubility in water; there- fore, the superfluous reactant may remain in water under hydrothermal reactions. In addition, phase purity of compounds 1-4 was evidenced by comparisons of their powder diffraction patterns with those calculated from the single-crystal data. As is well-known, the final structures of coordination polymers constructed from polycarboxylate are influenced by the degree of deprotonation, the coordination modes and capabilities, and the sizes and shape of the polycarboxylic acids, as well as by the coordination sphere of the metal centers. The 2,3-pydc ligand with its two carboxylate groups in the 2 and 3 positions is structurally unsymmetrical and possesses higher dipole moment than 2,6-pydc, which has limited steric hindrance. As to ligand SIP with a conformationally flexible sulfonate group, which is nearly rigid with both carboxylate and sulfonate as potential coordinating groups, it is expected that the strong coordination ability of the carboxylate groups can impart stability and rigidity onto the resulting network. The three polycarboxylates can assume versatile coordination modes and are suitable H-bonding acceptors. Furthermore, bix can assume cis or trans conformations according to the different geometric needs of metal ions.18,19 Although the synthesis conditions are similar, the difference in coordination modes of the aromatic polycarboxylic acids and the versatile conformation of bix exert a profound influence on the final 3D supramolecular architectures of complexes 1-4; hence, each one of these compounds has a unique structural feature. Crystal Structure of 1. A single-crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that 1 adopts a 3-D supramolecular structure. As shown in Figure 1a, the Cd(II) ion is in a distorted octahedral coordination sphere that is defined by two different bix nitrogen donors occupying the axial positions while the equatorial positions are furnished by one nitrogen atom and one carboxyl- ate oxygen atom from one 2,3-pydc ligand, one carboxylate oxygen from another 2,3-pydc and one bix nitrogen atom. For the bix ligand to which N1 belongs, located at a crystal- lographic inversion center, two terminal imidazole groups as- sume trans conformation and have their planes steeply tilted 96° with respect to the average plane of phenyl ring. In the case of the bix containing N3, two terminal imidazole groups are in cis conformation and the dihedral angles between the imidazole ring planes and the least-squares plane of phenyl group are 95° and 97°, respectively, with the two imidazole groups twisted by 5°. The bidentate bix molecules establish a physical bridge between Cd centers, imposing Cd‚‚‚Cd separa- Table 1.

The 2,3-pydc lig- and, acting as a bis connector by the monodentate carboxylate and pyridyl N moiety, links cadmium ions to form a 1D chain running along the c axis with Cd‚‚‚Cd distance of 5.166 Å (Figure 1b). The 1D chain is further cross-linked by cis-bix along the a axis, resulting in an infinite corrugated 2D layer, which is extended to a 3D porous framework through trans-bix ligands running parallel to the b axis. Compound 1 is related to the five-connected “bnn” net observed in hexagonal BN.20 The uncoordinated water molecules are trapped in the pores, which constitute 9.8% of the unit cell volume (Figure 1c and Figure S1). The lattice water molecule (O1W) forms a strong hydrogen bond with the noncoordinated carboxylate oxygen (O2#, sym- metry code: # x, 3/2 - y, 1/2 + z) with separation of 2.845(6) Å. Crystal Structure of 2. As depicted in Figure 2a, there exist two types of coordination environments around the cadmium Figure 1.

The 2,6-pydc ligand acts as a triconnector by the bis- monodentate carboxylate and pyridyl N group. Cd1 atoms and Cd2 atoms are bridged by three µ2-O bridges from two separate carboxylate moieties and one aqua ligand with Cd1‚‚‚Cd2 separations of 3.505 Å to form dimer units, which are further interconnected by another two carboxylate oxygen bridges to lead to a 1D chain running along the c axis (Figure 2b). All bix ligands reside at crystallographic inversion centers and adopt trans conformations. For the bix containing N3, the imidazole ring and phenyl group are twisted by ca. 91°; for the bix containing N5, the two planes are inclined by ca. 73°. Progres- sion of the 1D chains through bix along the b axis yields a 2D infinite layer framework (Figure 2c). The resulting 2D structure is cross-linked by hydrogen-bond interactions between C-H groups from bix and uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms, thus leading to the formation of a 3D supramolecular architecture (Figure S2). Crystal Structure of 3. The phenyl group to which C27 belongs is disordered over two sites with occupancy of 0.72 and 0.28 for each. For clarity, only one of these sites is shown in Figure 3a. There are two crystallographically unique Cd centers assuming different coordination geometries in the asymmetric unit. The Cd1 center situated at an inversion center and displaying an octahedral coordination environment, is bound by four different bix nitrogen atoms and two sulfonate oxygen atoms from different SIP anions. The Cd2 center, in a highly distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination sphere, is coordinated by two distinct bix nitrogen atoms, two carboxylate oxygen atoms in bidentate chelating fashion, and one carboxylate oxygen atom in unidentate mode from two SIP anions. However, the Cd2-O6#2 distance is 2.725(2) Å, suggesting a nonnegligible interaction with the uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atom, which can be described as a semi-chelating coordination mode.21 Hence, the Cd2 atom may be also described as in a trigonal prismatic coordination environment. Each SIP ligand is connected to three Cd2+ ions through its one chelating carboxylate, one monodentate carboxylate, and one monodentate sulfonate group and thereby acts as a µ3 bridging ligand, which is similar to that of the previously reported polymer in the literature.22 It should be noted that there are three independent sets of bix spacers, which establish a physical bridge between Cd atoms. For the two sets to which N1 and N3 belong, both assume trans conformation and reside at crystallographic inversion centers, whereas the set to which N5 belongs adopts cis conformation. A pair of symmetry-related Cd2 atoms are bridged by the cis-bix to construct a dinuclear unit with Cd‚‚‚Cd distance of 11.434 Å; meanwhile the dinuclear unit is interconnected through SIP anions to yield a 1D tubelike chain along the a direction (Figure 3b). The 1D structures are further stacked along the b and c directions with the bidentate trans-bix spacers occupying the void spaces, thus leading to the formation of a three-dimensional porous framework. The most striking feature in crystal structure of 3 is that it contains channels in two directions, both distributed in a rectangular grid fashion, which are filled by eight crystallographically unique uncoordinated water molecules involved in O-H‚‚‚O hydrogen bonds falling Figure 3.

Four d10 Metal-Organic Frameworks Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 6, No. 2, 2006 533 into the range from 2.667(4) to 3.006(2) Å (Figure S3). The most prominent cavities are ca. 7.0 × 6.3 Å2 in cross-section and run along the a axis; other rectangular-shaped but smaller channels with cross-section of ca. 9.8 × 2.5 Å2 are parallel to the b direction, as indicated in Figure 4 (cavity dimensions were calculated by overlapping rigid spheres with van der Waals radii for each element: O, 1.52 Å; N, 1.55 Å; C, 1.7 Å; S, 1.8 Å; and Cd, 2.2 Å). Compound 3 is a trinodal (6,3)-connected net: Cd1 acts as a ‘‘six-connected” center, Scha¨fli symbol (44.610.8); both Cd2 and the SIP ligand are three-connected centers with Scha¨fli symbol 63. Considering the stoichiometry, the overall topology can be defined as (Cd1)(Cd2)(SIP)2, Scha¨fli symbol (44.610.8)(63)(63)2. The uncoordinated water molecules constitute 23.7% of the unit cell volume. Two kinds of strong hydrogen bonds are observed: (a) hydrogen bonds between free water molecules; (b) hydrogen bonds between free water molecules and unco- ordinated carboxylate or sulfonate oxygen atoms. Crystal Structure of 4. The replacement of the cadmium center in 3 by zinc results in a quite different structure of 4. As illustrated in Figure 5a, the fundamental building unit of 4 is composed of a Zn center, half SIP ligand, and one and a half bix ligand, in which each Zn center lies in a distorted tetrahedral coordination sphere completed by three different bix nitrogen atoms and one carboxylate oxygen atom from a SIP ligand whose sulfonate moiety shows positional disorder over two sites (S1, O3B, O4, O5 and S1B, O3, O4B, O5B) with equal site occupancy. In addition, a hydroxyl anion moiety with site occupancy of 0.5 has been found to compensate the charge balance. Each SIP ligand, serving as bis connector through its two carboxylate moieties in monodentate mode whereas the proto- nated sulfonate group does not participate in the coordination, bridges a pair of Zn centers with separation of 10.229 Å to form the [Zn2SIP] unit. The SIP ligands reported here coordinated to metal atoms in a similar coordination mode to that found in [{Cu(H2O)2(HSIP)}‚2H2O‚(PIP)1/2]n and [{Cu(H2O)3(HSIP)}‚ 6H2O‚(hmt)1/2]n.23 As for the bidentate bix ligands, they all adopt trans conformation in the structure. Figure 5b shows a 1D infinite ladder-like chain arranged in the a axis, assembled from [Zn2- SIP] unit acting as rungs and the bix ligand to which N1 belongs serving as rails. The 1D chain is further staked along the b and c axes with the bidentate bix to which N5 belongs spacers occupying the void spaces, thus resulting in the formation of a 3D porous framework. The individual 3D network is “open” with large hexagonal channels of size ca. 25.8 × 24.6 Å2 and rectangular channels of size ca. 14.1 × 13.6 Å2 (based on Zn‚ ‚‚Zn separations) along the a- and b- axes, respectively. Taking the Zn2+ cations as nodes, “long” connections between metal centers corresponding to bix bridges, and “short” connections representing SIP bridges for [Zn2(SIP)(bix)3(OH)‚2H2O]n, the single framework topology representations for 4 parallel to the bc and ac planes are illustrated in Figure 6. The net of a single frame can be described as a four-connected “sra” topology with Schla¨fli symbol 42638, which is related to the prototypical structure of SrAl2.24,25 These “empty” spaces are filled through another three independent identical nets generated by the translation vectors [0 1 0], [1/2 1/2 0], and [1/2 -1/2 0]. Consequently, 4 exhibits a 4-fold interpenetration of identical [Zn2(SIP)(bix)3(OH)‚2H2O]n frameworks, which is similar to those observed in [Ag(sebn)2]- (PF6) and [Ag(sebn)2](AsF6) and belongs to class Ib,26,27 as illustrated in Figure 7. The resulting effective cavities are 8.6% of the unit cell volume. The crystallographically unique crystal- lization water molecules and hydroxyl groups occupy the small available space (Figure S4). The lattice water molecule O7 is involved in a hydrogen bond with an uncoordinated sulfonate oxygen atom (O5#, symmetry code #: 1/2 + x, -1/2 + y, z) with O‚‚‚O separation of 3.290(6) Å and an uncoordinated carboxylate (O2) with O‚‚‚O separation 2.894(4) Å. Thermal Properties. For 1, the weight loss of 1.50% from 118 to 158 °C (calcd 1.38%) corresponds to the loss of one free water molecule per formula. A plateau region is observed from 158 to 200 °C, and the second loss corresponding to the release of almost all free water molecules is detected below 227 °C (obsd 2.73%, calcd 2.76%). Compound 2 is stable up to 190 °C. The first weight loss of 2.34% below 230 °C is assigned to the liberation of an aqua ligand, which is in agreement with the calculated value (2.22%). The burning of the organic groups starts from 300 °C. For 3, the total weight losses of 7.36% below 318 °C are assigned to the departure of free water molecules, which is consistent with the calculated value (7.62%). For 4, the first step from 53 to 194 °C is Figure 4. Projections along the a direction (a) and the b direction (b) of the 3D framework in 3 showing the cavities. Hydrogen atoms and water molecules have been omitted for clarity, and cross-sections have been calculated based on van der Waals radii. 534 Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 6, No. 2, 2006 Wen et al. attributed to the removal of a free water molecule. The observed weight loss of 3.34% is close to the calculated one (3.15%). The dehydrated compound is stable up to 263 °C. This result may indicate that the guest molecules are difficult to remove from the host molecules due to the existence of strong hydrogen bonds between the host and guest molecules. Guest water molecules are removed by heating 1, 3, and 4 at 230, 320, and 200 °C, respectively, for 2 h under N2. Powder X-ray diffraction study of 1 before and after water expulsion shows major changes in the diffraction patterns, indicating the breakdown of 1 after removal of the guest water molecule. Clearly, in the case of 3 and 4, only minor changes are observed, which suggests that the 3D porous structure of 3 and the 4-fold interpenetration MOFs of 4 are intact in the absence of guest molecules. Luminescent Properties. The emission spectra of complexes 1-4 in the solid state at room temperature are investigated, as depicted in Figure 8. Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit intense blue- fluorescent emission bands at ca. 423 and 417 nm upon excitation at ca. 363 nm. In addition, complexes 3 and 4 display strong fluorescent emission bands at ca. 399, 416, and 423 nm, respectively, upon excitation at ca. 348 and 355 nm. These emissions are neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) nor ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) in nature since the Zn2+ or Cd2+ ions are difficult to oxidize or to reduce due to their d10 configuration and can probably be assigned to the intraligand (π-π*) fluorescent emission because similar emis- sions are observed at 402 nm for the free 2,3-pydc, 396 nm for 2,6-pydc, and 355 nm for SIP. The enhancement of the emissions for 1-4 compared with those of the free ligands may be ascribed to the increase in the ligand conformational rigidity due to their coordination to Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions resulting in a decrease in the nonradiative decay of intraligand excited states.28 They appear to be good candidates for novel hybrid inorganic- organic photoactive materials. Conclusion In summary, using aromatic polycarboxylate ligands, 2,3- pydc, 2,6-pydc, and SIP in the presence of the heterocyclic bridge bix, we have assembled four novel coordination polymers with different topological structure. Although the synthesis conditions are similar, the difference in coordination modes of the polycarboxylic acids and the versatile conformation of bix exert a profound influence on the final 3D supramolecular architectures of complexes 1-4; hence, each one of these compounds has a unique structural feature. They appear to be good candidates for novel hybrid inorganic-organic photoactive materials. Acknowledgment. Special thanks are offered to the review- ers for their constructive suggestions.
