The results of adsorption measurements on 1, using probing gas molecules of alcohol (MeOH and EtOH) for the size effect and Me2CO for the influence of hydrogen bonding, show that alcohol adsorptionisothermsaregradualtwo-stepprofiles,whereastheMe2COisothermisatypicaltype-Iisotherm,indicatingthatatwo- stepadsorption/desorptionisinvolvedwithhydrogenbonds.Tofurtherclarifythesecharacteristicadsorption/desorptionbehaviors, selecting nitroterephthalate (bdc-NO2), bromoterephthalate (bdc-Br), and 2,5-dichloroterephthalate (bdc-Cl2) as substituted dicarboxylate ligands, isomorphous jungle-gym-type porous coordination polymers, {[Zn2(bdc-NO2)2(dabco)] 3 solvents}n (2 ⊃ solvents), {[Zn2(bdc-Br)2(dabco)] 3 solvents}n (3 ⊃solvents), and {[Zn2(bdc-Cl2)2(dabco)] 3 solvents}n (4 ⊃solvents), were synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray analyses. Thermal gravimetry, X-ray powder diffraction, and N2 adsorption at 77 Kmeasurements reveal that [Zn2(bdc-NO2)2(dabco)]n (2), [Zn2(bdc-Br)2(dabco)]n (3), and [Zn2(bdc-Cl2)2(dabco)]n (4) maintain their frameworks without guest molecules with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 1568 (2), 1292 (3), and 1216 (4) m2 g-1. As found in results of MeOH, EtOH, IPA, and Me2CO adsorption/desorption on 2-4, only MeOH adsorption on 2 shows an obvious two-step profile. Considering the substituent effects and adsorbate sizes, the hydrogen bonds, which are triggers for two-step adsorption, are formed between adsorbates and carboxylate groups at the corners in the pores, inducing wide pores to become narrow pores. Interestingly, such a two-step MeOH adsorption on2 dependson the temperature, attributed to the small free-energy difference (ΔFhost) between the two guest-free forms, wide and narrow pores. Introduction Porous coordination polymers with structurally well-defined nanoscale cavities are of great interest1 because of their unique properties, such as gas storage,2 separation,3 and catalysis,4 which are all associated with the presence of functional pores. Numerous types of porous coordination polymers, namely, open metal-organic frameworks, have been synthesized and constructed with judicious choices of metals and designed bridg- ing ligands affording tailored open channels and cavities.1,5,6 *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The interesting aspect found in those open spaces is their framework’s flexibilities,7,8 where pore shapes and sizes change in response to penetrating guest molecules with maintaining of the framework in the solid state. Such a stimulus-driven struc- tural responsiveness is rarely observed in other classes of porous materials such as zeolites and activated carbons, and therefore provides a unique entry into the development of functional materials for gas separation and sensing.8 The framework flexibilities reflect characteristic adsorption isotherm profiles, which are impossible to be grouped into the IUPAC classification9 for adsorption isotherms. Those char- acteristic isotherm profiles are roughly divided into two types. Oneisan isothermcontainingathresholdpressure,10definedas the “gate pressure”,10a where adsorption amounts suddenly increaseatthatpressure,asshowninScheme1a.Theothertype is a stepwise isotherm,6f,k,l,11-13 whose behavior in porous coordination polymers is best exemplified by MIL-53,12 where a wide f narrow f wide pore transition with gas filling has been observed (Scheme 1b), termed the “breathing effect”.8 Both types of isotherms show obvious hysteresis loops. From a thermodynamic point of view, gate pressure was recognized as the equilibrium pressure between the initial (closed form) and final (open form) states;10e,h however, the adsorption mechanisms that have been reported to date for the stepwise isotherms except for MIL-5312 are still difficult to understand. It has been pointed out that the breathing effect produced by distortion around the secondary building unit (SBU) is allowed only for SBUs possessing a crystallographic mirror plane.8 For example, a family of highly porous IRMOFs, which have a cubic structure, constructed using Zn4O(COO)6 as the SBU,14 is inhibited from demonstrating the breathing effect because of the absence of a mirror plane in Zn4O- (COO)6.8 In contrast, in MIL-53, the planes consisting of metals and a coordinated carboxylate group are perpendicular to each other (Scheme 2), which allows a hinge-like motion around the metals, producing framework flexibility.12 Simi- larly to MIL-53, the paddle-wheel unit, Zn2(COO)4(L) (L = nitrogen donor ligand),5,6,13 which is another SBU with a different connectivity from Zn4O(COO)6, typically resultingin a tetragonal (distorted cubic) structure, is allowed to breathe. Actually, [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)]n (1, H2bdc = 1,4-benzenedicar- boxylic acid, dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)5 shows an unambiguous two-step process for isopropanol (IPA) Scheme 1 (7) (a) Kitagawa, S.; Uemura, K.

Here, we show MeOH, EtOH, IPA, and Me2CO adsorption on four types of jungle-gym-type porous coordination polymers (Scheme 3), 1, [Zn2(bdc-NO2)2(dabco)]n (2, bdc-NO2=nitro- terephthalate), [Zn2(bdc-Br)2(dabco)]n (3, bdc-Br=bromoter- ephthalate), and [Zn2(bdc-Cl2)2(dabco)]n (4, bdc-Cl2 = 2,5- dichloroterephthalate), to clarify the condition for stepwise adsorption.

Experimental Section Materials. Terephthalic acid was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate was obtained from Wako Co. Bromoterephthalic acid, nitroterephthalic acid, 2,5-dichloro- terephthalic acid, and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane were obtained from Tokyo Kasei Industrial Co. [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)]n (1) was obtained according to the previous procedure.5 Compound {[Zn2- (bdc-NO2)2(dabco)] 3 solvents}n (2 ⊃solvents) was synthesized ac- cording to the previous procedure.13c Synthesis of {[Zn2(bdc-Br)2(dabco)] 3 solvents}n (3 ⊃solvents). H2(bdc-Br) (490 mg, 2.0 mmol), Zn(NO3)23 6H2O (595 mg, 2.0 mmol), and dabco (112 mg, 1.0 mmol) were mixed in dimethyl- formamide (DMF, 30 mL) and homogenized by stirring for 5 min. The slurry was heated to 120 C in a Teflon autoclave for 48 h to obtain white crystals. For elemental analysis these crystals were collected and dried in vacuo at 100 C for 2 h to afford [Zn2(bdc- Br)2(dabco)]n (3) (602 mg, 83%).

H2(bdc-Cl2) (470 mg, 2.0 mmol), Zn(NO3)2 3 6H2O (595 mg, 2.0 mmol), and dabco (112 mg, 1.0 mmol) were mixed in DMF (30 mL) and homogenized by stirring for 5 min. The solution was heated to 120 C in a Teflon autoclave for 48 h to obtain white crystals. For elemental analysis these crystals were collected and dried in vacuoat 140 C for 1 h toafford [Zn2(bdc-Cl2)2(dabco)]n (4) (313 mg, 44%).

Single crystals of 3 ⊃solvents and 4 ⊃ solvents were mounted on a glass fiber and coated with epoxy resin. X-ray data collections were carried out using an imaging plate detector of a CCD two-dimensional detector of Rigaku Mercury diffractometer (3 ⊃solvents) or a Rigaku RAXIS- RAPID diffractometer (4 ⊃solvents) with graphite monochro- mated Mo-KR radiation (λ = 0.7107 A˚ ). For 3 ⊃solvents, the sizes of the unit cells were determined from reflections collected on the setting angles of six frames by changing ω by 0.5 for each frame, and intensity data were collected with a ω scan width of 0.5. For 4 ⊃solvents, the sizes of the unit cells were determined from reflections collected on the setting angles of three frames by changing ω by 3.0 for each frame, and intensity data were collected with an ω scan width of 5.0. Two different χ settings were used. Empirical absorption correction16 was performed for all data. The structures were solved (Table 1) by the direct method with the subsequent difference Fourier syntheses and the refinement with the SHELXTL (version 5.1) software package.17 The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropi- cally and all hydrogen atoms were placed in the ideal positions. In 3 ⊃solvents, the disordered C5-9 atoms of dabco were isotropically refined. In 4 ⊃solvents, the O5, O6, N2, N3, and C12-17 atoms of DMF molecules were found in final stage, and isotropically refined under the rigid condition. In both 3 ⊃ solvents and 4 ⊃solvents, it is impossible to find additional DMF molecules in the framework because of the highly disorders. Physical Measurements.

(100 mL/min) with heating rate of 10 K/min. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out with a Rigaku Instrument TG8230 in a nitrogen flow (70 mL/min) with heating rate of 20 K/min, and the heats of desorption were calibrated by melting high-purity indium, lead, and antimony. IR spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-610 spectrophotometer with samples prepared withKBr.X-raypowderdiffraction(XRPD) datawerecollectedon a Rigaku RINT-2200YS diffractometer with CuKR radiation. N2 (77 K) adsorption measurement was carried out in Quantachrome Autsorb-1. The adsorption isotherms of gaseous MeOH, EtOH, i-PrOH, and Me2CO were measured by using BELSORP18-Plus volumetric adsorption equipment from BEL JAPAN. The satu- rated vapor pressures were calculated using the following equation, log10P = A - B/(T þ C), where P is the saturated vapor pressure (Torr), T is the temperature in degrees Celsius, and A, B, and C are constants defined by the adsorbate. MeOH: A = 8.07246, B = 1574.99, C = 238.86; EtOH: A = 8.21337, B = 1652.05, C = 231.48; i-PrOH: A=8.39424, B=1730.00, C=231.45; Me2CO: A=7.23967, B = 1279.87, C = 237.5. Results and Discussion i-PrOH, EtOH, and Me2CO Adsorption/Desorption on [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)] (1). As reported previously, i-PrOH (IPA) adsorption/desorption on 1 shows a two-step profile (Supporting Information, Figure S1a).13a,b The IPA adsorp- tion process involves the intermediate state {[Zn2(bdc)2- (dabco)] 3 3IPA}n (1 ⊃3IPA), in which the framework is highly shrunk with loading of three IPA molecules per pore, compared with empty or filled frameworks.13a This shrink- age produces a slowing down of the adsorption kinetics, and then a further increase in the adsorption pressure after the threshold pressure (Pth,ad) leads to a reopening of the total porosity and complete pore filling (eq 1). 1 þ 4:5IPA a 1⊃3IPA þ 1:5IPA a 1⊃4:5IPA ð1Þ A similar stepwise adsorption is observed in the MeOH and EtOH adsorption isotherms on 1 (Supporting Informa- tion, Figures S1b and S1c).13b In contrast, Me2CO adsorp- tion on 1 shows a single step, indicative of a typical type-I isotherm (Supporting Information, Figure S1d), where Me2- CO micropore filling occurs in the very low P/P0 region.13b Saturated Me2CO amounts are about 5.0 molecules per Zn2, at which {[Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)] 3 5Me2CO}n (1 ⊃5Me2CO) is produced. As the adsorbate molecular sizes decrease (IPA> Me2CO>EtOH>MeOH), the saturated amounts increase: 4.5 (IPA), 5.0 (Me2CO), 6.0 (EtOH), and 8.0 (MeOH) molecules per pore.18 Considering that alcohol adsorption isotherms are two-step profiles but those of Me2CO are not, it could be concluded that hydrogen bonds are involved in the two-step adsorption on jungle-gym-type porous coordi- nation polymers. As found in the IPA adsorption process,13a two-step adsorption is attributed to the highly shrunk inter- mediate state. Consequently, MeOH and EtOH molecules are also adsorbed via the shrunk intermediate state, which is produced by the hydrogen bonds. The remaining problem is how hydrogen bonds form in the pores, and it is possible to obtain detailed information using isomorphous frameworks, the results of which are shown in the next paragraph. Syntheses and Crystal Structures of 2 ⊃solvents, 3 ⊃ solvents, and 4 ⊃solvents. The advantageous property pertinent to the jungle-gym-type porous coordination poly- mers is the ability to modify pore environments while main- taining the topology of the host framework.5b To monitor the differences in adsorption behaviors under the same con- ditions, we set out to vary the dicarboxylate ligands (bdc) in the original framework 1 without altering the overall con- nectivity of the nets. Dicarboxylate linkers with bdc-NO2, bdc-Br, and bdc-Cl2 were used instead of bdc in 1, which resulted in a series of isomorphous frameworks, {[Zn2(bdc- NO2)2(dabco)] 3 solvents}n (2 ⊃solvents), {[Zn2(bdc-Br)2- (dabco)] 3 solvents}n (3 ⊃solvents), and {[Zn2(bdc-Cl2)2- (dabco)] 3 solvents}n (4 ⊃solvents).

(18) Strictly speaking, integer values are not proper for adsorption amounts because adsorption is a continuous process. However, it is valid to use in the comparison of adsorption amounts among several adsobate- absorbent systems. Hereafter, all adsorption amounts are made in this way. (19) Single crystals of 2 ⊃solvents keep their crystalline form without guest molecules, which was checked by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Single- crystal X-ray analysis, TG, XRPD, and N2 adsorption measurements for 2 are reported in reference 13c. Article Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 49, No. 21, 2010 10137 and 4 ⊃solvents, respectively. The primary building unit in all three compounds is a well-known binuclear “paddle- wheel” zinc carboxylate complex, where these Zn2 units are connected in 2-D via rigid dicarboxylic bridges into infinite planar layers having a grid topology. Axially coordinated dabco ligands to Zn2 units link each layer along the c-axis, affording a porous 3-D net with tetragonal (distorted cubic) structure. Considering the van der Waals radii for the constituent atoms, the free sizes of the intersecting channels along the c-axis vary from 6.2  4.3 A˚ 2 for 2 to 5.0  2.0 A˚ 2 for 3 ⊃solvents, and 3.8  3.8 A˚ 2 for 4 ⊃solvents. In 2, the nitromoietiesareorientedtotheporewitha65.9 inclination to the benzene plane, and the dihedral angles of the benzene rings are inclined (20.0) to the channel direction along the c-axis. Also in both 3 ⊃solvents and 4 ⊃solvents, the Br and Clmoietiesstickoutfromtheporeswiththebenzeneinclined to the channel (26.0 and 23.1, respectively). The calculated guest-accessible free volumes for frameworks 2-4 were found to be 27, 44, and 57%, respectively.20 The inner microporous space of the as-prepared hosts is occupied by guest solvent DMF molecules; however, we were not able to locate these guest molecules in 3 ⊃solvents and 4 ⊃solvents because of the high crystal symmetry and intrinsic disorder. Interestingly, the layer stacking modes in 2, 3 ⊃solvents, and4⊃solvents aredifferent.In2and3⊃solvents,thelayers of [Zn2(COO)4N2] are situated exactly on top of each other and hence form AAAA-type packing, where 2 has a square section like [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)]n (1),5a and 3 ⊃solvents has a rhomboid section like {[Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)] 3 2C6H6}n (1 ⊃ 2C6H6).5a In contrast, in 4 ⊃solvents, the undulating layers alternate obeying an ABAB law, like {[Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)] 3 4DMF3 1/2H2O}n (1 ⊃4DMF3 1/2H2O),5a as shown in Figure 3b. This difference in the layer stacking modes is attributed to the framework flexibilities mainly originating from the variety of coordination modes around the Zn2 units. Figures 1c, 2d, and 3d show the three types of coordi- nation modes around the Zn2 units found in 2, 3 ⊃solvents, and 4 ⊃solvents, respectively. In 2, mutually perpendicular coordination bonds (type-R) afford square cross-sectional pores, whereas in 3 ⊃solvents, rhomboid cross-sectional pores are produced by inclination of coordination bonds to one another (type-β) with angles of 84.2. In contrast, in 4 ⊃solvents, the coordination is asymmetrically distorted (type-γ): all angles among the coordination bonds are different (95.5, 90.9, 84.5, and 89.1). Table 2 summarizes the jungle-gym-type porous coordina- tion polymers containing dabco ligands, which are classified into three types of coordination mode (type-R, -β, and -γ) Figure 2.

The trend is found that type-R is favored when symmetrical dicarboxylate ligands are coordinated to the Zn2 units. A noteworthy success is that all these three types of coordination mode are constructed with the introduction of substitution into 1, in 2, 3 ⊃solvents, and 4 ⊃solvents, respectively. It is possible for 1 to have two types of coordination modes, type-R and type-β, responding to the guest species.5a As reported pre- viously,13a the intermediate 1 ⊃3IPA is type-β, where two states originating from type-R and type-β go back and forth between the counterparts. Thermal Stabilities and Porosities of 2-4. Supporting Information, Figure S2 shows the thermograms of 2 ⊃ solvents, 3 ⊃solvents, and 4 ⊃solvents in the temperature range 20-300 C for a heating rate β = 10 C/min. In the temperature range 20-200 C, the thermograms of 2 ⊃ solvents and 3 ⊃solvents showed a mass loss (observed = 30.0% and 30.4%, respectively) corresponding to guest molecules. In contrast, the thermogram of 4 ⊃solvents showed a two-step loss in the temperature range of 20- 78 C (observed = 32.3%) and 78-180 C (observed = 19.7%), which correspond to surface-adsorbed molecules and guest molecules, respectively. On the assumption that all guests are DMF, 3.9, 4.4, and 4.0 molecules are adsorbed in one pore of 2 ⊃solvents, 3 ⊃solvents, and 4 ⊃solvents, respectively. All 2 ⊃solvents, 3 ⊃solvents, and 4 ⊃solvents were readily desolvated to give [Zn2(bdc-NO2)2(dabco)]n (2), [Zn2(bdc-Br)2(dabco)]n (3), and [Zn2(bdc-Cl2)2(dabco)]n (4) by drying in vacuo at 120 C for 3 h, at 100 C for 2 h, and 140C for1 h(SupportingInformation, FigureS2b, d, and f), respectively. AsshowninFigure4, the XRPD patterns of 2, 3, and 4 show sharp peaks at similar peak positions correspond- ingtotheas-preparedcompounds,indicatingthatcompounds 2, 3, and 4 maintain their frameworks after removal of the guest molecules. Figure 5 shows the results of N2 adsorption/desorption experiments conducted on 2-4 at 77 K. The adsorption isotherms display type-I curves, corresponding to apparent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas, as shown in Table 3. Despite the bulky substitution in 2, the surface area of 2 is comparable to that of 1. N2 adsorption amounts on 2-4 are 10.6 (2), 9.7 (3), and 8.8 (4) Table 2.

These results also supports the pore stabilities of 2-4 without guest molecules. Vapor Adsorption/DesorptionIsotherms on1-4.Figure 6 shows MeOH, EtOH, IPA, and Me2CO adsorption/ desorption isotherms on 1-4. Following the order of molec- ular sizes, compounds 1-4 adsorb each adsorbate with saturated amounts of MeOH > EtOH > Me2CO g IPA. XRPD patterns of 2-4 exposed to each of the solvent vapors show intense peaks with similar positions (Supporting In- formation, Figure S6-8), indicatingthat 2- 4 adsorbvapors without framework collapse.21 As well as 1, Me2CO adsorp- tion isotherms on 2- 4 exhibit type-I isotherms and show no apparent hysteresis. In contrast, almost all alcohol vapor isotherms show hysteresis loops. In 2 - 4, the most remark- able feature is that a clear two-step isotherm is only observed in MeOH adsorption on 2 (a substep isotherm is observed in MeOH adsorption on 3). Although the larger sizes of EtOH and IPA adsorption on 1 exhibit clear two-step isotherms (Figure 6a), those on 2 - 4 show single-step isotherms. The characteristic curve using the Polanyi adsorption potential (=RT ln(P0/P)) displays adsorption data at low pressures much better and demonstrates clearly the difference in the affinity for the adsorbates.6k Comparisons of charac- teristic adsorption curves corresponding to those in Figure 6 are shown in Figure 7. All compounds adsorb Me2CO in higher affinity regions in conformity with sharp uptakes at lower relative pressures, which may be attributed to the π affinitieswiththeinternalbenzeneringsoftheframeworks.In contrast, alcohol molecules are adsorbed at lower regions of RT ln(P0/P), because jungle-gym-type porous coordination polymers 1-4 havelesshydrophilic pores. Such a logarithmic plot for the MeOH isotherm on 2 also shows an apparent two-step profile, as well as the alcohol isotherms on 1. Although the information about first adsorption sites of MeOH on both 1 and 2 would set the stage for the origin of the two-step adsorption, observations by single-crystal X-ray analyses are difficult because of the high crystallogra- phic symmetry. However, on the assumption that the mole- cules are mostly adsorbed near the corners of the cavities,22 the first adsorption site of MeOH is presumed to be the corner around the carboxylate groups of bdc (or bdc-NO2) ligands. This hypothesis is supported by previous reports23 on molecule adsorption sites in 1, where methane and hydrogen adsorption sites were determined by in situ single- crystal X-ray crystallography and calculation, respectively. Both results show that parts of the first adsorption sites form the corner around the carboxylate groups of the bdc ligands. Furthermore, it is valid to consider that penetrated hydro- philic MeOH molecules are far apart from hydrophobic spacesaffordedbytheinternalbenzenerings,andbroughtso close to the carboxylate groups with hydrogen bonds. There- fore, it seems reasonable to assume that such a formation Figure 6.

Undoubtedly, under conditions that hinder such formation of a hydrogen bond by introducing substitu- tion (-NO2, -Br, -Cl) as obstacles around the corner, or using bulky alcohols making it hard to penetrate into the corner, the two-step adsorption is not observed. Thermal Analyses of Two-Step Adsorption Isotherms on 1. To fully understand the difference, the mechanisms of i-PrOH, EtOH, and Me2CO adsorption/desorption on 1 were pursued by thermal analyses. Figures 8 and S11 show adsorption/desorption isotherms for EtOH and Me2CO at various temperatures, respectively. Each EtOH adsorption isotherm shows a sharp increase at low relative pressures and then assumes the plateau form to be {[Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)] 3 4EtOH}n(1⊃4EtOH).AfterreachingPth,ad(0.73(288),1.29 (298), 1.81 (308), 2.94 (318), and 4.55 kPa (328 K)), the curve exhibits another gradual increase and finally attains a satu- rated level at which {[Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)] 3 6EtOH}n (1 ⊃ 6EtOH) is produced. In both EtOH and Me2CO adsorption isotherms, the saturated amounts do not vary over the mea- sured temperatures, that is, without collapsing the frame- work 1 adsorbs EtOH and Me2CO with a similar adsorption mechanism in those temperature regions, affording 1 ⊃ 6EtOH via 1 ⊃4EtOH, and 1 ⊃5Me2CO, as expressed in eqs 2 and 3, 1 þ 6EtOH a 1⊃4EtOH þ 2EtOH a 1⊃6EtOH ð2Þ 1 þ 5Me2CO a 1⊃5Me2CO ð3Þ Figure 7.

The adsorption enthalpy for the second EtOH adsorption (that is, for the process 1 ⊃ 4EtOH þ 2EtOH f 1 ⊃6EtOH) is ΔHad,2 (EtOH)=-70.4 kJ mol-1, which is relatively smaller than that in 1 ⊃3IPA þ 1.5IPA f 1 ⊃4.5IPA (ΔHad,2 (IPA)=-81.6 kJ mol-1).13a Considering the vaporization enthalpy of ΔHvap (EtOH)= 42.32 kJ mol-1 and ΔHvap (Me2CO)=30.99 kJ mol-1,25 the total adsorption enthalpies were estimated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements for 1 ⊃6EtOH and 1 ⊃5Me2CO: ΔHad (EtOH) =-141.6 kJ mol-1 and ΔHad (Me2CO) = -127.5 kJ mol-1. Figure 9 summarizes the energy diagrams of the IPA, EtOH, and Me2CO adsorption processes on 1.26 The total adsorption enthalpy of Me2CO is slightly smaller than those of IPA (ΔHad (IPA)=-151.2 kJ mol-1) and EtOH, because Me2O adsorption does not involve hydrogen bonds, which supports the claim that alcohol adsorption on 1 involve the formation of hydrogen bonds. Comparing IPA and EtOH adsorption on 1, the value of the first adsorption enthalpy for EtOH is comparable to that for IPA: ΔHad,1 (IPA) = -69.6 kJ mol-1 and ΔHad,1 (EtOH) = -71.2 kJ mol-1, indicating that both adsorptions proceed via the shrunk intermediate state, that is, a wide f narrow f wide pore transition has occurred. Although the two-step profile in EtOH adsorption on 1 is relatively ambiguous compared with those of IPA, from an energetic point of view, similar framework transformations are produced. Only focusing on the framework deformations, the energy balances are exothermic in the wide f narrow and endothermic in the Table 4.

The reason is that in the second adsorption processes hydrogen bonds are reformed among the adsorbate molecules with the realignment (Supporting Information, Figure S9). Temperature Dependence of Two-Step MeOH Adsorp- tion Isotherm on 2. As mentioned previously, the MeOH adsorption isotherm on 2 at 298 K clearly shows a two-step profile. At 298 K, the MeOH adsorption isotherm shows a gradual increase at low pressures and then assumes the plateau form to be {[Zn2(bdc-NO2)2(dabco)] 3 6MeOH}n (2 ⊃6MeOH). After reaching Pth,ad (9.21 kPa), the curve exhibits another gradual increase and finally attains a satu- rated level at which {[Zn2(bdc-NO2)2(dabco)] 3 8MeOH}n (2 ⊃8MeOH) is produced, as expressed in eq 4. 2 þ 8MeOH a 2⊃6MeOH þ 2MeOH a 2⊃8MeOH ð4Þ This two-step profile would also be attributed to the shrunk framework of 2 ⊃6MeOH produced by the hydrogen bonds between MeOH molecules and carboxylate groups of the framework. Figure 10 shows MeOH adsorption/desorption iso- therms on 2 at 288, 298, 308, 318, and 328 K. At 288 K, the adsorption/desorption isotherm shows a single-step pro- file with narrower hysteresis loop. Taking into account that the saturated amounts are 8.0 molecules per pore, 2 adsorbs MeOH to be 2 ⊃8MeOH without a pathway of 2 ⊃ 6MeOH, as expressed in eq 5. 2 þ 8MeOH a 2⊃8MeOH ð5Þ As the temperature is raised, the width of hysteresis loop becomes narrower with the higher shift of Pth,ad (13.06 (308), 17.36 (318), and 25.69 kPa (328 K)), and the step in the adsorptionisothermat328Kisambiguous.Thosetrendsare obviously observed in the logarithm plots of adsorption iso- therms (Figure 10 left). Thus, there is a temperature depen- dence(298-318K) fortheappearanceoftwo-stepprofilesin MeOH adsorption on 2, which also supports the claim that the formation of hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate groups and guest molecules producing the shrunk frame- works is the origin of the two-step adsorption. Above 318 K, it is hardto form hydrogen bonds between MeOH molecules and carboxylate groups, because the formation is exother- mic. In contrast, in thecase below 298K, the hydrogen-bond formation may be hindered by another formation between -NO2 moieties and MeOH molecules. Because -NO2 moieties in 2 are hydrophilic,13c lower temperature promotes adsorbates to be hydrogen bonded to -NO2 moieties rather than carboxylate groups. Free-Energy Differences (ΔFhost) between the Two Guest-Free Forms. The free-energy difference (ΔFhost) between the two guest-free forms, wide pore and narrow pore, would be helpful for considering the ease of transfor- mation. Two-step adsorption on jungle-gym-type porous coordination polymers proceeds via a wide f narrow f wide pore transition. Although the thermodynamics of the two concomitant processes, host-guest interactions and host structural transition, cannot be easily resolved experi- mentally, it is possible to calculate ΔFhost using a recently developed thermodynamic model.27 This method relies on adsorption isotherms, which can be obtained experimen- tally. Figure 11a shows the applied results for IPA adsorp- tion on 1 at 308 K. Intwo regions, 0.13-2.01(blue) kPa for the narrowpore and 2.61-9.45(red) kPafor the widepore, each Langmuir curve is well fitted. Each of the produced osmotic thermodynamic potentials27b as a function of pressure for the narrow pore (blue) and wide pore (red) intersect at 2.13 kPa (= Pth,ad), another intersection being obtained at 0.32 kPa, indicating that shrinkage of frame- work 1 is completed at 0.32 kPa. The estimated ΔFhost value for 1 is 10-13 kJ mol-1, which is smaller than the 16-19 kJ mol-1 for postsynthetic modified [Zn2(bdc- NH2)2(dabco)]n (DMOF-1-AM3).15 On the assumption that adsorption enthalpy, ΔHad (IPA), can simply be ascribed to the sum of ΔFhost, the heat of condensation of the guest molecules (ΔHg-g), and heat of interaction Figure 11. Experimental adsorption isotherms of (a) i-PrOH on 1 at 308 K and (b) MeOH on 2 at 308 K with Langmuir fittins. Langmuir fittings (upper) of i-PrOH adsorption isotmerm on 1 were carried out in 0.13-2.01 (blue) kPa and 2.61-9.45 (red) kPa regions. Osmotic thermo- dynamic potentials (below) as a function of pressure, calculated from the Langmuir fittings, are corresponding to the narrow pore (blue) and large pore (red) form of 1. In the case of MeOH adsorption on 2, Langmuir fittings were carried out in 5.11-12.74 kPa region of adsorption isotherm for the narrow pore (blue) form and 2.01-24.69 kPa region of desorption isotherm for the large pore (red) form.

In the case of MeOH adsorption/desorption on 2 at 308 K (Figure 11b), we succeeded in Langmuir fitting to the 5.11-12.74 kPa region of the adsorption isotherm for the narrow pore form (blue) and to the 2.01-24.69 kPa region of the desorption isotherm for the wide pore form (red). Interestingly, the estimated ΔFhost value for 2 is 1-3 kJ mol-1, which is smaller than that of 1. A smaller ΔFhost value, which shows the relative stability of the two phases, indicates that it is easier for 2 to go back and forth between the counterparts, wide and narrow pores. Be- cause of this smaller energy difference between the two phases, the appearance of two-step MeOH adsorption on 2 strictly depends on the temperature. Conclusion This work was devoted to further understanding the two- step adsorption/desorption isotherms on jungle-gym-type por- ous coordination polymers. We have succeeded in synthesizing and characterizing novel ligand-substituted jungle-gym-type porous coordination polymers, [Zn2(bdc-NO2)2(dabco)]n (2), [Zn2(bdc-Br)2(dabco)]n (3), and [Zn2(bdc-Cl2)2(dabco)]n (4). Using various adsorbates, MeOH, EtOH, IPA, and Me2CO, adsorption/desorption measurements were carried out on ligand-substituted jungle-gym-type porous coordination poly- mers 2-4 as well as [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)]n (1), showing that two- step profiles were obtained in alcohol on 1 and MeOH on 2. These results indicate that two-step adsorption is produced by the hydrogen bonds between the adsorbates and the carbox- ylate groups of the frameworks at the corners of the pores, leading to a wide to narrow pore transformation. Interestingly, the two-step profile found in MeOH adsorption on 2 depends on the temperature. As it would initially seem that the struc- tural flexibility of these materials is related to the hydrogen- bonding nature of the probe gas molecule and frameworks, such results could pave the way for in-depth understanding of stepwise adsorption behaviors.
