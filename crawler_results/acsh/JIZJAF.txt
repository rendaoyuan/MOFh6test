Crystallog- raphy shows that the framework is not altered by the replacement of DMF by diﬀerent solvents or by the removal of the solvent molecules during the single-crystal to single-crystal (SC-SC) transformations, while upon exchange with H2O or partial oxidation by molecular iodine, the crystallinity is aﬀected. 1 absorbs N2, H2, CH4, CH3OH, C2H5OH, PrOH, C6H6, and I2, but once it is in contact with H2O the absorption eﬃciency is drastically reduced. Upon PSM, the magnetism is transformed from a canted antiferromagnet (1·3DMF and 1·xGuest) to single- chain magnet (1), to a ferrimagnet (1a·7H2O), and to a ferromagnet (1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO). Raman spectroscopy suggests the color change (purple to green 1a·7H2O or yellow 1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO) is associated with a change of geometry from a strained octahedron due to the very acute chelating angle (∼60°) of the lactate of a cobalt center to a regular octahedron with a monodentate carboxylate and one H2O. The magnetic transformation is explained by the diﬀerent interchain exchanges (J′), antiferromagnetic for 1·3DMF and 1·xSolvent (J′ < 0), SCM for 1 (J′ verge to 0), and ferromagnetic for 1a·7H2O (J′ > 0), between homometal topological ferrimagnetic chains (two octahedral and one tetrahedral CoII ions) connected by the double walls of pybz at 13.3 Å (shortest Co···Co). For 1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO the moment of the tetrahedral site is turned oﬀ, thus stabilizing a ferromagnetic state (J′ > 0). The present stabilization of four magnetic ground states is unique in the ﬁeld of metal− organic frameworks as well as the electrical conductivity of 1·2.7I2. 1. INTRODUCTION Recently the multifunctionalization of microporous metal− organic frameworks (MMOFs) has become one of the principal focuses of inorganic and materials chemistry because multiple physical properties may coexist and even synergetically interact.1 Therefore, better performance or tuning of functions or new applications is expected.1,2 In this context, magnetic MMOFs especially those displaying long-range ordering are viewed as one of the signiﬁcant candidates of multifunctional molecular materials.3 In order to achieve long-range ordered magnetic materials one of the ﬁrst requirement is the consideration of distance between the nearest-neighbors moment carriers.4 In general, the critical temperature decreases exponentially with increasing the number of nonmagnetic atoms bridging the carriers. For example, metals have Curie temperature (TC) approaching 1400 K, oxides have high TC up to nearly 900 K, while for cyanides, the TC is below 350 K, and those containing three-atom bridges are well below 50 K.4 As such, one of us previously made the statement that long-range magnetic ordering and porosity are inimical based on the idea that long-range magnetic ordering requires a short connection between moment carriers and that porosity requires long ones.5 This has been shown not to be the case under the condition that there are fragments containing M−O−M connections within the framework and weak magnetic interaction exists between them.3,6 Thus, it is possible to classify the following four types of magnetic MMOFs: (i) organic molecules act as linkers between 1D inorganic M−O−M chains, so-called rod- spacer; (ii) organic pillars between inorganic M−O−M layers, Received: January 8, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/JACS © XXXX American Chemical Society A dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja500191r | J. Am. Chem. Soc. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX so-called pillared-layer; (iii) organic molecules sitting in the gallery of inorganic M−O−M layers; and (iv) organic ligands connecting discrete M−O−M clusters, containing two or more metal ions or isolated metal ions, so-called cluster base MMOFs. The same analogy can be done for cyanides, but their transition temperatures for layer and chain compounds are expected to be lower than those with M−O−M connections.3c Among the rod-spacer compounds of type I the magnetic ground states of Co3(OH)2(C4O4)2·3H2O7 and Ni3(OH)2(1,4- chdc)2(H2O)4·2H2O8 were found to be modiﬁed by the presence of the lattice water. In the presence of water both are antiferromagnet, while in the absence the former is a ferromagnet and the latter is a ferrimagnet. Presumably the electron density of the solvent molecules introduces a weak antiferromagnetic exchange between the magnetic chains. Thus, the magnetic properties of these two compounds and also others established the importance of the solvents in magnetic MMOFs in contributing to the exchange.9 Therefore, we may anticipate that if the chains are connected by longer nonmagnetic ligands and in the absence of solvent in the cavities, the chains may behave as single-chain magnets, while in the presence of solvent they may exhibit long-range ordering.6,10 Using the same arguments, those of type IV would be single molecule magnet.11 Many more examples showing modulation of TC, TN, or magnetic hysteresis have since been reported but only few show changes of ground state and usually two at most,3,6−8,12 which was mainly due to the removal/inclusion/exchange of guest molecules (Table S1). In porous 3D framework, such transformation from an anti- ferromagnet to ferromagnet, ferrimagnet even single-chain magnet, single molecule magnet is rarely observed.13 On the other hand, in rod-spacer MMOFs, the introduction of longer ligand is possible and beneﬁcial for generating large voids. Hence, we expect magnetic MMOFs with rod-spacer feature to be a typical model to investigate magnetic switching behavior and also a good candidate of multifunctional molecular materials. In order to test the above hypothesis, we made the cobalt analogue [CoII 3(lac)2(pybz)2]·3DMF (1·3DMF, purple) of the only double-walled framework, [Zn3(pybz)2(lac)2]·2.5DMF, which has been shown to contain M−O−M connectivity within the well-separated square chains.14 Solvent exchanged [CoII 3(lac)2(pybz)2]·xSolvent (xSolvent = 6MeOH, purple; 4.5EtOH, purple; 3PrOH, purple; 2C6H6, purple), iodine loaded [CoII 3(lac)2(pybz)2]·2.7I2 (1·2.7I2, black), and desol- vated [CoII 3(lac)2(pybz)2] (1, purple) were obtained in SC-SC manner and the magnetic behaviors were investigated to reveal the relevance between host−guest interaction and magnetic ground state. Furthermore, given that post-synthetic mod- iﬁcation (PSM) can modify either the organic linker or the coordination of the metal center without perturbing the parent framework and modify its physical properties,15,16 we successfully conducted PSM on 1 by coordination and oxidation of the metal center to obtain two derivatives, hydrated [CoII 3(pybz)2(lac)2(H2O)2]·7H2O (1a·7H2O) and partially oxidized [CoIIICoII 2(pybz)2(lac)2(H2O)2]I·2H2O· 1.5DMSO (1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO). Here, we report the syntheses, structures, interconversions, Raman spectra, thermal stability, gas sorption, and magnetic properties of these compounds (Scheme 1). As-prepared 1·3DMF, solvent exchanged 1·xSolvent, and I2 loaded 1·2.7I2 behave as canted antiferromagnets, while upon desolvation 1 behaves as a single- chain magnet, and 1 is transformed into a ferrimagnet when it is hydrated 1a·7H2O. By partial oxidation of 1 or 1a·7H2O by I2 in DMSO/H2O ferromagnetic 1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO is obtained. These changes were possible by the PSM of the as- prepared 1·3DMF which alters the magnetic exchange interaction between the chains of cobalt ions from being antiferromagnetic through the electron density of the guests in the channel, to being nonexistent in the desolvated 1, and ﬁnally to ferromagnetic through H2O and DMSO. The series of compound realize for the ﬁrst time the switching between four ground states by the modulation of host−guest interaction, magnetic M−O−M chain, and also the oxidation state of the spin carrier. 2.

Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Netzsch TG 209 instrument in ﬂowing N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C per minute in the range of 25 to 600 °C. PXRD measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diﬀractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. PXRD measurements at diﬀerent temperatures were recorded after the sample had been kept at the respective temperature for 20 min in ﬂowing N2. The crystalline powder samples were prepared by crushing the single crystals, and scans of 3−60° at a rate of 5°/min were recorded. Calculated PXRD patterns were generated using Mercury 3.0.17 Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope equipped with a 785 nm diode laser and a 1200 lines/mm grating. The N2 sorption isotherm was recorded with an automatic volumetric adsorption apparatus (IGA-003 series, Hiden Isochema Ltd.) at 77 K. The benzene and methanol vapor sorption measurements were performed using a Belsorp-Max automatic volumetric adsorption apparatus. The high-pressure gas sorption measurements were performed using the Belsorp HP-60 high-pressure sorption system. Magnetizations of polycrystalline samples were measured in the temperature range of 2.0−300 K and ﬁeld range ±50 kOe using a Quantum Design MPMS XL-5 SQUID magnetometer. 2.3. X-ray Diﬀraction. For the crystal structure determination, single crystals of 1·3DMF, 1·6CH3OH, 1·3PrOH, and 1·2C6H6 were selected from batches covered with solvent and ﬁxed to glass ﬁber for diﬀraction data collection at 173 K. However, for guest free 1, the data were collected at 298 K using the crystal of 1·6CH3OH after the methanol was removed by heating the crystal at 355 K for 1 h on the diﬀractometer. Single-crystal diﬀraction data were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex CCD diﬀractometer using graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Absorption corrections were applied by using multiscan program SADABS.18 The structure was solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares method on F2 using the SHELXTL program package.19 All nonhydrogen atoms except C15 were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters. The solvent molecules in 1·3DMF and 1·6CH3OH were located from diﬀerence maps, and some of the solvent molecules were treated using a disorder model by dividing into parts with diﬀerent occupancy ratio. Except for one C6H6 and one PrOH solvent molecule located from diﬀerence maps, other disordered guest molecules which cannot be modeled in 1·2C6H6 and 1·3PrOH were treated by the SQUEEZE routine,20 and the amounts were determined by TGA results and elemental analyses. Hydrogen atoms of the organic ligands were reﬁned using the riding model. Crystal data as well as details of data collections and reﬁnements are summarized in Table S2. Selected bond distances and bond angles are listed in Table S3. The CCDC reference numbers are 978270−978274 for 1·3DMF, 1·6CH3OH, 1, 1· 3PrOH, and 1·2C6H6, respectively.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Crystal Structures. The key feature of the ﬁve structures is the square pillars consisting of octahedral and tetrahedral cobalt ions and a racemic mixture of lactate ions (lac2−) connected through the long pybz forming double walls between the pillars (Figure 1). The structure is the same as that for the Zn analogue but 1·3DMF crystallizes in the space group P-4c2 instead of P-421c for the Zn analogue. It contains two crystallographically distinct cobalt atoms in the ratio 2 (Co1, distorted octahedral):1 (Co2, tetrahedral) (Figure S1). Co1 is located on a general position and has a distorted octahedral geometry with ﬁve oxygen atoms [Co−O = 1.988−2.334 Å] of two lac and one pybz and one nitrogen atom [Co−N = 2.105 Å] of another pybz (Figure S2). Co2 is located at the 4e position and adopts a tetrahedral geometry with two deprotonated hydroxyl groups [Co−O = 1.905 Å] of two lac and two oxygen atom [Co−O = 1.963 Å] of carboxylate from two pybz. The lac exhibits η5, μ2, μ2, μ1-coordination modes, and the equivalent lac anions alternately link Co2+ into the square tubular [Co3(D-/L-lac)2]2+ chains parallel to the c-axis. This chain can be viewed as a square with vertex of four equivalent six-coordinated Co2+ ions (Co1···Co1A distance of 4.391 Å) bridged by a single oxygen atom of a lac (Co1−O4− Co1 of 162.9°) linked by two four-coordinated Co2+ ions (Co1···Co2 distance of 3.424 Å) by two bridges of one oxygen atom and a syn−syn carboxylate of pybz (Co1−O3−Co2 of 123.1°) (Table 1, Table S4). The Co1−O4−Co1 angles for 1· 3DMF, 1·6CH3OH, 1, 1·2C6H6, and 1·3PrOH are 163.0°, Figure 1. Schematic diagram of construction of a rod-spacer MMOF (H atoms are not shown for clarity).

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX C 162.6°, 164.3°, 162.5°, and 162.8°, respectively. It should be noted that the structure diﬀers from previous linear, zigzag, ladder, helical, and ribbon chains widely found in 1D, 2D, or 3D coordination polymers which use a single metal center as node.3d The present thick and rigid chain can be viewed as constructed by their two square alternately connected vertexes (Figure 1). Such a feature renders both the chain and the framework high stability that is crucial for subsequent PSM.15 Especially, the dominant M−O−M connectivity in the chain is crucial for magnetism, hence variation of such connectivity may greatly aﬀect the magnetic behavior of the compound.6 These chains of cobalt are further linked by double pybz bridges along the a and b directions, forming a 3D neutral framework with square 1D channels which are occupied by guest solvent in 1·xSolvent and empty in 1. Taking the van der Waals radii of the atoms into consideration, using PLATON the window of these channels was estimated to be ca. 10.8 × 10.8 Å2 (distance of pairs of the ligand constituted the opposite walls) with a solvent accessible volume of 43.1% of the unit cell.20 The framework is retained for all ﬁve of the compounds except for the small variation of bond distances and angles. The very low residual electron density in the crystal structure analyses of 1 indicates that all of the CH3OH has been removed from the channels. No global change in connectivity occurs in the framework upon desolvation except for minimal changes in metal−ligand bond distances and angles. The average coordination bond lengths of Co1 and Co2 in 1 are 2.120 and 1.943 Å, respectively, which are slightly longer than those [2.111 and 1.934 Å] of 1·3DMF. This diﬀerence may be due to the higher temperature at which the data of 1 was collected. The solvents, 3DMF, 4.5EtOH, 6CH3OH, 3PrOH, and 2C6H6 per molecular unit within the channels, are reasonable and quite compact even though most of them were reﬁned in disorder models. 3.2. Thermal Properties. Thermogravimetric analyses of all the compounds show the destruction of the framework at ca. 400 °C. Before being destroyed it is stable for a wide temperature range over 200 °C (Figure S3, Table S5). Such thermal stability is comparable to the highly thermo-stable MMOFs21 and can be associated with the strong intra- and inter-rod connection that also contributes to subsequent PSM. The solvents are removed slowly from room temperature in all cases, but the temperature at which all the solvents are removed diﬀers from compound to compound. This temperature is an indication of the strength of the interaction between the solvent molecules and the solvent with the framework, and it increases in the order methanol < ethanol < propanol < benzene < DMF. Except for the anomalous temperature for benzene, the order respects the boiling point of the liquids, which suggests the solvent−solvent interaction cannot be ignored. When the crystals of 1 are immersed in water or exposed to water vapor, they turn green. TGA of the green crystals 1a· 7H2O exhibits gradual loss of water from room temperature with a step at ca. 165 °C (13.3%) and ﬁnishes at 250 °C (3.9%) (Figure S4). The ﬁrst loss amounts to 7H2O (calculated 13.8%) and the second to 2H2O (calculated 4.0%) (Table S5). We infer that 7H2O resides in the channels, and the other two are coordinated to the cobalt. The coordinated water to the highly distorted octahedral cobalt Co1 will force it to become more regular, and the color of that center is expected to be pink. Consequently, in the presence of the blue tetrahedral cobalt the overall color of the compound will appear green.22 3.3. Powder X-ray Diﬀraction. PXRD has been used to check the purity of the samples and also to study the structural changes that take place during certain modiﬁcation. First the experimental PXRD of 1·3DMF is the same as that calculated using the single crystal result (Figure S4). After desolvating, the PXRD of 1 is again similar to that calculated using the single crystal result. The temperature dependence of the trans- formation of 1·3DMF to 1 was studied in situ, and it is found to be a smooth one with retention of the crystallinity. However, when 1 is soaked in water or exposed to water vapor it is transformed to a poorly crystalline material 1a·7H2O (Figure S5). The crystallinity is further deteriorated upon dehydrating of 1a·7H2O to [CoII 3(pybz)2(lac)2] (1′). The XRD pattern for the latter appears to be very diﬀerent to the original 1. From the patterns no structural characteristics can be elucidated. 3.4. Raman and IR Spectroscopy. The Raman spectra (Figure 2) of 1·3DMF, 1, 1a·7H2O, and 1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO belong to two diﬀerent classes, that is those without water in the crystals (1·3DMF and 1) and those with (1a·7H2O and 1b· I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO). The bond energies and the diﬀerences between them for the two classes can be used to derive the coordination geometries of the metals and the modes of bonding of the ligands.23 The Raman bands, which are not perturbed by the presence of water, are assigned to the organic ligand pybz. In contrast, the bands which are perturbed are assigned to the lactate ions and the metal−ligand vibrations. Our assumption, based on our previous work24 and the crystallographic data reported by Bourne et al.,25 is that the long bond and the strained coordination of the carboxylate of the lactate to Co1 are easily removed by the coordination of incoming water to give a regular octahedral Co1. The ν(OH) band of water for 1a·7H2O and 1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO is at 3216 cm−1. The region of the carboxylate vibrations (1100− 1450 cm−1) has four intense bands which can be identiﬁed by Figure 2. Raman spectra for 1·3DMF (red), 1 (blue), 1a·7H2O (green), and 1b·I‑·2H2O·1.5DMSO (black), in which the sensitive peaks are highlighted. Journal of the American Chemical Society Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja500191r | J. Am. Chem. Soc. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX D the diﬀerence between carboxylate νs(OCO) and νas(OCO).23 The diﬀerence of ca. 146 cm−1 in the four compounds is consistent with that of a relaxed carboxylate, and thus we assigned these pairs of bands to the benzoate of pybz. In contrast for the highly strained lactate the diﬀerence is 188 cm−1 for 1·3DMF and 1, while it is reduced to 136 cm−1 upon solvation with water. Thus it is reasonable to assume that the long Co−O(lac) bond is broken while relieving the strain of the coordination.24,25 This is associated to the color change from purple to green consistent with the change of electronic structure resulting in a lower extinction coeﬃcient for the less distorted octahedral cobalt, which in the presence of the expected blue color of the tetrahedral cobalt will give a jade green color.22 The bending modes lowering from 844 (1· 3DMF and 1) to 830 cm−1 (1a·7H2O and 1b·I−·2H2O· 1.5DMSO) are again in line with the arguments presented above. For 1·3DMF and 1, the Co−O stretching modes are numerous in the range 350−450 cm−1, which is due to the highly irregular octahedron around Co1 and they collapse into one band at 308 cm−1 for 1a·7H2O and 1b·I−·2H2O· 1.5DMSO.24,25 As a comparison, the IR spectra of these four compounds were dominated by carboxyl groups and water guest molecules and also can be divided to two diﬀerent classes like the Raman spectra. And the similar information further conﬁrmed the structure transformations and the stability of the host framework (Figure S6). In the absence of crystal structures for 1a·7H2O and 1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO, the Raman and IR spectra were useful in elucidating the molecular structures and thus allow further discussion of structure−magnetic properties relationship. 3.5. Gas Sorption. The observation of a stable porous framework with large channels of 10.8 × 10.8 Å2 after removal of the solvents prompted us to study the gas sorption properties especially in view of the presence of a surface having diﬀerent potential sites for sorption. We have therefore study the sorption of gases (N2, CO2 up to 1 bar and H2, CH4 up to 40 bar) and solvent vapors (C6H6 and CH3OH up to 1 bar) for 1 and 1′ (desolvated 1a·7H2O), respectively. The N2 sorption isotherm for 1 at 77 K shows a typical type I behavior with maximum uptake of 256 cm3 g−1 (STP) at 1 bar (Figures 3 and S7), corresponding to a Langmuir surface area of 1050 m2 g−1, which is comparable to the Zn analog and among one of the highest for magnetic MMOFs (Table S6).14,26 It demonstrates once again that the rod-spacer strategy is an eﬀective method to construct magnetic MMOFs with large voids by the introduction of longer linker. In addition, 1 shows maximum H2 and CH4 uptake of 252 cm3 g−1 (77 K, 40 bar) and 84.8 cm3 g−1 (298 K, 39 bar), respectively (Figures 3 and S8). In contrast, 1′ has nearly no N2 sorption. For high- pressure H2 or CH4 sorption, a similar phenomenon was also observed with a maximum uptake of 42 cm3 g−1 (one-sixth of that of H2 for 1) and 11.4 cm3 g−1 (one-eighth of that of CH4 for 1). Such results suggest that the 1D porous channel and/or the windows may shrink due to twist of the pybz linker during the transformation from 1 to 1a·7H2O driven by the change of the coordination of one of the cobalt ions.24,27 For solvent vapor, 1 shows typical type I benzene sorption curve with saturated uptake of 249 mg g−1 (2.3 benzene molecule per formula unit) (Figure 3). Though sharing analogous sorption isotherm, the saturated benzene uptake of desolvated 1′ (124 mg g−1, about 1.2 benzene molecule per formula unit) is just one-half of the value of 1. Comparing to benzene, the sorption of MeOH increases slowly with the increase of vapor pressure and the maximum uptake was 172 mg g−1 (4.3 methanol molecule per formula unit) at P/P0 = 0.88. This not fully saturated value compared to the methanol exchanged crystals 1·6CH3OH. Hence, methanol shows recovery ability of the shrinking channels of 1′. 3.6. Enrichment versus Oxidation of 1 by I2. In contrast to iodine uptake by the Zn analogue, the cobalt compound can uptake iodine as well as get oxidized. When crystals of 1 (100 mg) were soaked in aprotic cyclohexane solution of I2 (3 mL of 0.1 M), the dark-violet coloration of the I2 solution slowly fades to transparent light purple, and the resulting crystals become very dark purple to black (Figure 4). The uptake is 0.9 g iodine per gram of 1 to give [CoII 3(lac)2(pybz)2]·2.7I2 (1·2.7I2, iodine content of 47.8%) which is close to that of the Zn analogue ([Zn3(lac)2(pybz)2]· 3I2 (iodine content of 49.8%). The loading process appears to be slower for 1 (Figures S9 and S10).14 The reverse process, that is I2 release was monitored by UV−vis transmission spectroscopy by soaking some crystals of 1·2.7I2 in ethanol (Figure S11). The iodine absorption bands were found to increase slowly with time and tend toward saturation after 3 h. Two-probe electrical conductivity measurement on a powder sample, contacted with gold paint, shows an ohmic behavior in the voltage of −1 to 1 V (Figure S12). The conductivity (σ) is 7 × 10−6 S/cm for 1·2.7I2 which is higher than the 10−6 to 10−8 S/m found for the iodine-loaded single crystal of tris(o- Figure 3.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX E phenylenedioxy) cyclotriphosphazene28 but much less than that of the single crystal of the iodine-loaded Zn analogue of 3 × 10−3 (σ∥) and 1 × 10−4 (σ⊥) S/cm.14 However, when crystals of 1 were soaked in a DMSO/H2O (v/v = 1:1) solution of iodine, the crystals slowly change color from purple to orange 1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO (Figure 4). Its PXRD shows very few peaks, which is common to that found for 1a·7H2O and indicates that the two compounds are next to being amorphous (Figure S5). TGA shows two weight losses before the framework is destroyed at ca. 400 °C; the ﬁrst at ca. 150 °C amounts to 15.6% which corresponds to 2H2O and 1.5DMSO solvent molecules (Figure S3, Table S5). The elemental analysis results also coincide well with such a composition. The Raman spectrum shows a close similarity in band energies as that of 1a·7H2O (Figure 2). Using similar arguments as above, we can assume that the lactate is now monodentate and that one water molecule is coordinated to each Co1. Since 1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO is not green but orange is a strong indication that the tetrahedral Co2 is no longer four coordinated but ﬁve or six. Thus, we propose that it is the Co2 that is oxidized favorably.29 Therefore, only the Co1 will be moment carriers, and a reduction in moment is found as expected (see below). 3.7. Magnetic Properties. The magnetic properties of the compounds have been studied as a function of temperature, ﬁeld, and ac frequencies (Figure 5). The results can be presented by the behavior at high and low temperatures. In high-temperature regions all the compounds behave as Curie− Weiss paramagnets with diﬀering exchange interactions. Analyses of the high temperature data (150−300 K) have been performed in each case using the Curie−Weiss function (Table 2). From the analyses we ﬁnd two classes: those (1· xSolvent, 1·2.7I2 and 1) (Figures S13−18) with a fairly high Weiss temperature of ca. −130 K and those (1a·7H2O and 1b· I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO) with ca. −10 K. The former compounds exhibit a broad maximum in the susceptibility at ca. 65 K and a minimum around 25 K. The temperature dependence between 25 and 300 K may be associated with low-dimensional behavior. Considering the structural parameters, interatomic distances and angles (Table 1), we can deﬁne two principal exchange interactions within each chain where both are mediated through one single oxygen atom, that is J1 (Co1−Co1) with Co···Co distance of 4.37−4.47 Å and Co1−O−Co1 angle of 162.5−164.3 and J2 (Co1−Co2) with Co···Co of 3.41−3.43 Å and Co1−O−Co2 of 122.4−123.6.21,30 From the interatomic distances we can intuitively assume that |J1| < |J2|. Secondary exchange interactions (J3) exist for example Co1−Co2 at distances of about 6.09 Å and Co1−Co1 at 6.07 Å. The latter will be weak in comparison to the former ones. Between chains we can consider two interactions: J4 through the connecting pybz bridge and dipolar through space and the other (J′) through the solvents in the channels. The lack of magnetic ordering in 1 would suggest that J4 is negligible. In the case of 1·xSolvent and 1, the susceptibility in the high- temperature region can be interpreted as dominated by the strong antiferromagnetic coupling J2. As kT approaches ≈65 K the Co1−Co1 antiferromagnetic coupling, J1, becomes Figure 5.

Journal of the American Chemical Society Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja500191r | J. Am. Chem. Soc. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX F operative and further decrease the susceptibility. For 1· xSolvent, the presence of solvents provides enough electron density to generate the weak interchain (J′) interaction (Figure 6), and long-range magnetic ordering is observed at the same temperature of 18 ± 1 K. The strong ﬁeld dependence and the weak isothermal magnetization at 2 K indicate the ground state for these compounds is canted antiferromagnetic.30 This is further conﬁrmed by the low magnetization in high ﬁeld. Using the magnetization (16 cm3 G/mol) at 2 K measured in 1 Oe ﬁeld cooling for 1·3DMF and an expected saturation magnetization for a ferromagnetic chain of 3 μB (3 × 5585 cm3 G/mol), the canting angle is estimated as 0.006°. For 1· 2.7I2 the high-temperature behavior is almost the same, but the canting appears at lower temperature of 10 K (Figure S18) and ac susceptibilities independent of frequency of the ac ﬁeld. The high-temperature susceptibility behavior of 1 is similar to those of 1·xSolvent (Figure 5), which indicate the interactions involved are of the same signs and magnitudes. However, the low-temperature behavior is quite diﬀerent. There is no long-range order, and the magnetization increases continuously to the lowest temperature of 2 K. The ac susceptibilities of 1 in a 5 Oe ﬁeld oscillating at diﬀerent frequencies and a zero dc ﬁeld exhibit strong frequency dependence. Both the in-phase (χ′) and out-of-phase (χ″) susceptibilities peak temperatures shift with increasing frequency, for example, Tmax (χ′ shifts from 2.7 K at 1 Hz to 4.5 K at 997 Hz). The relaxation process is deﬁned by the parameter ϕ = (ΔTmax/T)/Δ(log υ) = 0.12, which is in agreement with that expected for superparamagnetism. The strong frequency-dependent behavior can be further conﬁrmed by the Cole−Cole diagram at 3.5 K (Figure S19), which follows a generalized Debye model with α = 0.4 (R = 2.09 × 10−5), indicating a relative narrow distribution of relaxation times. The relaxation time (τ) of 1 follows the Arrhenius behavior (τ = τ0 exp(Δτ/kBT)), with Δτ = 41(8) K and τ0 = 1.7 × 10−8 s (R = 0.999). Therefore, with these parameters we can imagine the chains are magnetically isolated and can be considered as single-chain magnets within a 3D framework.31,32 The high-temperature behavior of the susceptibility of 1a· 7H2O belongs to the second class mentioned above. It does not show the broad maximum at 65 K and instead the susceptibility increases on cooling below 120 K (Figure 5). This indicates that J1 is now ferromagnetic (Figure 6). To discuss the magnetic properties we have to recall that the Raman spectroscopy has indicated a change of geometry of Co1 from a highly distorted to a regular octahedron. Thus, this structural change has major eﬀect on the susceptibility due to the change of the electronic structure and especially with the additional anisotropy of the Co1 in the regular octahedral geometry. The low Weiss temperature suggests the modiﬁca- tion of the geometry of Co1 induces either a reduction in both J1 and J2. The χmT versus T plot is characteristic of that of a ferrimagnet with a minimum at 100 K. The ZFC-FC magnetization in a ﬁeld of 10 Oe exhibits a bifurcation temperature of 32 K (Figure S20). Both component of the ac susceptibilities are nonzero, and χ′ has a peak at 27.0 K at 1 Hz which is shifted to 28.5 K at 1 kHz. χ″ becomes nonzero below 33 K, conﬁrming a critical temperature of 32 ± 1 K, but the frequency dependence is weaker. The magnetization below 33 K is ﬁeld dependent due to the long-range ordering. The isothermal magnetization at 2 K is hysteretic with a coercive ﬁeld of 2.4 kOe, saturation magnetization at 50 kOe of 5.2 μB, and a remanant magnetization of 0.84 μB (Figures 7 and S20). Both the coercive ﬁeld and the remanant magnetization decrease upon warming. All the characteristics, except for the saturation magnetization of 5.2 μB, tend to the conclusion of a ferrimagnetic ground state.33 If the exchange interactions, J1 and J2, are antiferromagnetic we can have a situation as depicted in Figure 7, where the moments of two Co1 are antiparallel to the other two Co1 and to the two Co2. Assuming the moments of each chain are oriented equally in the same direction, then a ferrimagnet results but the saturation moment is expected to be 3 μB (that is +1 × 2.4 μB per Co1, −1 × 2.4 μB per Co1, +1 × 3 μB per Co2). To account for a saturation of 5.2 μB, we may invoke alignment of the moments of Co1 and Co2 along diﬀerent axes given the diﬀerent anisotropies. Thus, we propose one possible solution where the four Co1 moments, behaving as xy, point away from the center of the square in the ab-plane but with a canting along the c-axis and the Co2 moments, behaving as Ising, lie along the c-axis. The surplus moment requires that each Co1 moment be canted by sin−1(1.1/2) = 3.66° from the ab-plane. Such a model requires neutron diﬀraction to conﬁrm its validity, but such an experiment is not feasible due to the amorphous nature of the compound. Figure 6.

Soc. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX G For 1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO, χmT is only 6.48 cm3 mol−1 K at 300 K (Figure 5). On lowering temperature it is decreased to 5.22 cm3 mol−1 K at 30 K before reaching a maximum of 16.11 cm3 mol−1 K at 7.0 K. The Curie−Weiss ﬁt of the high- temperature data gives a negative θ of −6(1) K and C = 6.91 cm3 mol−1 K. Both the ac susceptibilities show a peak at ca. 7 K which is independent of frequency suggesting long-range ordering. The isothermal magnetization at 2 K increases gradually with ﬁeld without saturation at 5 T and shows a small hysteresis of 340 Oe and remanant magnetization of 0.334 μB (Figure S21). The maximum magnetization value is 4.65 μB, which is close to that expected for two Co(II) ions of 4.6 μB. These characteristics suggest a ferromagnetic ground state,34 which according to the discussion above consist of parallel octahedral Co1 moments. The low Curie temperature is consistent with the weaker exchange interaction between Co1 within the squares and even weaker Co1−Co1 between squares via the oxidized diamagnetic Co2. Hence, the magnetism appears to be little aﬀected by the diﬀerent solvents as 1·3DMF and 1·xSolvent all show canted- antiferromagnetism, but their presence is important to provide weak antiferromagnetic interchain couplings to give a long- range ordered ground state (Figure 6). By removing the guests those weak couplings are turned oﬀ, and the magnetism is that of noninteracting chains, therefore a superparamagnetic state akin single-chain magnetism is observed. By modifying the geometry through coordination of H2O to a more regular octahedron for Co1, the strength of the Co1−Co1 and Co1− Co2 is drastically reduced, and in addition anisotropy of Co1 is elevated. These structural and magnetic anisotropy changes result in a ferrimagnetic state due to a ferromagnetic interchain coupling. Upon partial oxidation of the tetrahedral Co2 site that results in it becoming diamagnetic (d6, S = 0), a ferromagnetic state is stabilized, as the interchain coupling is ferromagnetic. 4. CONCLUSION [CoII 3(pybz)2(lac)2] as its Zn analogue is one of the most stable MMOFs due to its very strong square rod of Co-lactate and the double wall connection between them. Single-crystal to single- crystal transformation conﬁrms the removal of the solvents and the porous channels can house diﬀerent solvents (DMF, methanol, ethanol, propanol and benzene) and gases (N2, H2 and CH4) reversibly. Post-synthetic modiﬁcation with water changes the geometry of the cobalt, while I2 in DMSO/H2O partially oxidized the metal ions. Raman spectroscopy conﬁrms these structural changes. The magnetism resulted for the ﬁrst time in the observation of four magnetic ground states in any material, canted antiferromagnets for [CoII 3(pybz)2(lac)2]· xSolvent and iodine-loaded samples due to the interchain coupling (J′) via the solvent or iodine molecules being negative, single-chain magnet for the desolvated [CoII 3(pybz)2(lac)2] as J′ approached 0, ferrimagnet for [CoII 3(pybz)2(lac)2(H2O)2]· 7H2O as J′ > 0, and ferromagnet for the partially oxidized [CoIIICoII 2(pybz)2(lac)2(H2O)2]I·2H2O·1.5DMSO as J′ > 0. In addition, the iodine-loaded [CoII 3(pybz)2(lac)2]·2.7I2 is a weak conductor. This family of compounds derived from a single framework is unique in its stability, gas sorption, and solvent exchange and especially its stabilization of four magnetic ground states as well as introducing electrical conductivity in a MMOF. It also presents a vivid example of chemically driven dynamic magnetic MMOFs. We believe that the diﬀerent chemistry bringing in multifunctionalities in MMOFs will be useful in the development of emergent materials for the future. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Addition ﬁles: crystal data in CIF ﬁles, TG, PXRD, sorption data of H2 and CH4, magnetic properties of 1·xSolvent and 1· 2.7I2, isothermal magnetization and hysteresis loops of 1· 3DMF, 1, 1a·7H2O, and 1b·I−·2H2O·1.5DMSO.

Figure S5. X-ray powder diffraction patterns of 1a·7H2O, 1', the resolvated form 1'·xDMF obtained by soaking 1' in DMF for 24 h and 1b·I-·2H2O·1.5DMSO. Comparing to as-synthesized 1·3DMF, both 1a·7H2O and 1b·I-·2H2O·1.5DMSO shows just few peaks. This can be explained by the ording of the framework was disturbed because of the H2O coordination to Co1 and subsequent distortion of chain and also the twisting of the linker. Hence, even most peaks in 1·3DMF greatly weaken or disappear, remaining evident peaks suggest the connection of the skeleton still maintained. Further dehydration of 1a·7H2O to 1' make those remaining peaks disappeared and no structure feature can be deduced. However, if soaking 1' in DMF for 24 h to get the resolvated form of 1'·xDMF, we found 1'·xDMF shows much clear patterns comparing to 1a·7H2O and 1' and similar to that of 1·3DMF. Such result suggests DMF shows recovery ability of crystalline state of the framework. Figure S6. The IR spectroscopys for 1·3DMF, 1, 1a·7H2O and 1b·I-·2H2O·1.5DMSO in which the sensitive peaks are highlighted. Overall, the characteristic features carboxyl groups and water guest molecular dominate the spectrum but the four compounds can still divide to two different classes of those without water in the crystals (1·3DMF and 1) and those with (1a·7H2O and 1b·I-·2H2O·1.5DMSO). The S8 strong and broad absorption bands appear at 3100-3500 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching of -OH groups, indicating containing of water molecules in 1a·7H2O and 1b·I-·2H2O·1.5DMSO while almost absent in 1·3DMF and 1. The strong peaks around from 1600 and 1400 cm–1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the carboxyl groups, respectively. There are numerous peaks below 1600 cm–1, these information further confirmed the structure transformations and the stability of the host framework of 1. Figure S7.

High-pressure H2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms at 77 K of 1, 1' and 1'' (soaking 1' in DMF for 24 h to obtain resolvated form 1'·xDMF and followed by heating 1'·xDMF at 120 oC for 24h under dynamic vacuum). As mentioned above, the PXRD data of 1'·xDMF suggest the framework of 1' can be recovered by soaking in DMF. To further verify it, high pressure of H2 and CH4 sorption isotherm for 1'' was recorded. As a result, 1'' process saturated H2 uptake of 125 cm3·g-1 which increase for about 300% comparing to 1', and saturated CH4 uptake of 38.8 cm3·g-1 which increasing for about 340% comparing to 1'. Hence, by soaking 1' in DMF, the inclusion of DMF into the channels induced the shrank channel partly restore and then get a higher sorption ability comparing to 1'. S10 Figure S9. To evaluate the iodine sorption ability of [Zn3(lac)2(pybz)2] and [Co3(lac)2(pybz)2], a simple experiment was designed in which 100 mg desolvated sample was soaked in 20 ml 0.1 M iodine solution of cyclohexane and sample was isolated and weighted at different time, the increased weight contributes to iodine uptake. For [Zn3(lac)2(pybz)2], iodine sorption saturated after about 100 hours and the maximum uptake is 0.96g iodine per gram of [Zn3(lac)2(pybz)2], corresponding to a formula of [Zn3(lac)2(pybz)2]·3I2. While for the Co analogue, iodine sorption saturated after about 200 hours and the maximum uptake is 0.89g iodine per gram of [Co3(lac)2(pybz)2], corresponding to a formula of [Co3(lac)2(pybz)2]·2.7I2. The uptake of iodine is quicker for Zn analogue although the frameworks, void volumes and channels are almost the same and the iodine sorption ability is expected to be similar. 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 2 Theta / Degree 1-2.7I2 1-3DMF 200 400 600 800 0 20 40 60 80 100 TG / % Temperature / oC 37.2% 7.0% Figure S10 (a) X-ray powder diffraction patterns of 1·3DMF and 1·2.7I2. They process similar peaks in the recorded range and confirm the framework is maintained before and after iodine loading though the diffraction intensity of 1·2.7I2 weaken greatly and hence few peaks in the high degree (2) can’t be observed. (b) The TG of 1·2.7I2 (5 °C /min, 25-800 °C) and the temperature is maintained at 200 °C for 4 h to remove the loading iodine molecules. As a result, there is a weight loss of 37.2% in the temperature range of 25-200 °C which corresponds to the leaving of iodine guest molecular but lower than the calculated iodine content of 47.8%. However, further weight loss of about 7.0% was observed under heating up to 380 °C and later the compound will decompose based on the variable-temperature X-ray powder diffraction patterns of 1·3DMF. Hence, the total weight loss attributed to iodine should be 44.2%, which just slightly less than calculated value of 47.8% and may be explained by the incompletely leaving S11 of iodine. It should be noted that, though known as easily sublimed solid, the iodine resided in the 1D channel seems can’t be easily removed which may be ascribed to the strong interaction between iodine and the framework. 200 300 400 500 600 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1min 3min 5min 9min 15min 21min 31min 49min 75min 95min 125min 160min Abs Wavelength / nm 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 0.00 0.15 0.30 0.45 0.60 0.75 0.90 Abs Time / min 203nm 290nm 360nm Figure S11. Temporal evolution of UV/vis absorption spectra for the I2 delivery of 1·2.7I2 in EtOH. To investigate the kinetics of I2 delivery of 1·2.7I2, in situ UV/vis spectrum of a crystal of 1·2.7I2 in 3 mL ethanol was determined at room temperature. The absorbance of I2 in ethanol increases gradually with time. The iodine releasing rate is quick in the first 20 minutes follow by a slower process up to 160 minutes. Though the iodine releasing of the Zn analogy can be empirically adjusted as zero order equation in the first hour, such nonlinear iodine releasing of 1·2.7I2 is reasonable because the measured sample is polycrystal while the measured Zn analogy is a single crystal. -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 -2.0x10 -4 -1.5x10 -4 -1.0x10 -4 -5.0x10 -5 0.0 5.0x10 -5 1.0x10 -4 1.5x10 -4 2.0x10 -4 I / A U / V Figure S12.
