China Received June 21, 2009; Revised Manuscript Received December 4, 2009 ABSTRACT: Five novel coordination polymers [Co4(OABDC)2(OH)2(H2O)4]n 3 (H2O)4.4n (1), [Ni4(OABDC)2(OH)2(H2O)4]n 3 (H2O)4n (2) (OABDC = 5-oxyacetateisophthalate), [Co2(OABDC)(bpe)(OH)]n 3 (H2O)2.9n (3), [Zn2(OABDC)(bpe)(OH)]n 3 (H2O)3.5n (4) (bpe = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene), and [Co2(OABDC)(bpy)(OH)]n 3 (H2O)2.2n (5) (bpy = 4,40-bipyridine) have been acquired at similar hydrothermal conditions. All compounds are constructed from tetranuclear [M4(μ3-OH)2] (M = Co for 1, 3, and 5, Ni for 2, Zn for 4) clusters. Compounds 1 and 2 are isomorphous, in which the M4(OH)2 units act as 6-connected nodes and the frameworks are two-dimensional (2D) (3,6)-connected nets with the rare CdI2 type. If considering the strong H-bond interactions between neighboring layers, both exhibit three-dimensional (3D) microporous networks with channels running along the [100] direction. Complexes 3 and 4 are also isomorphous, in which the 2D CdI2-based layer was pillared by bpe spacers; thus channels occur along the [100] direction. While adopting bpy instead of the bpe ligand, smaller channels are observed along the [100] direction for 5. The last three compounds all feature 3D networks with one of the scarce (3,8)-connected (43)2.(46.618.84) topologies. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that compound 1 shows strong antiferromagnetic behavior, while 2 exhibits strong ferromagnetic behavior. Introduction Crystal engineering based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) continues to attract considerable interest not only because of their intriguing variety of architectures but also because of their potential functional properties such as mag- netism, nonlinear optics, hydrogen storage, and catalysis.1 The ability to rationally design and modify the crystal struc- ture of MOF materials is the key to increase the potential for commercial applications.2 Recently, Yaghi et al. have success- fully developed a secondary building unit (SBU) strategy to direct the assembly of MOFs, which has been widely used for understanding and predicting structural topologies.3 The use of secondary building blocks is attractive in part because of their steric requirements and rigidity, which dramatically reduce the number of possible network topologies arising for a given node-linker combination.4 Metal-carboxylate based clusters, where metals are locked into their positions, have been synthesized in situ and successfully used as rigid directional secondary building units to design and construct stable open metal-organic assemblies.3a,5 For example, a family of highly porous MOFs has been constructed using Zn4O(COO)6 as the SBU.6 Multicarboxylate ligands are often selected as multifunctional organic linkers to build metal clusters because of their abundant coordination modes to metal ions, resulting from completely or partially deproto- nated sites, allowing for various structural topologies, and also because they can be regarded not only as H-bond acceptors and but also as donors depending upon the number of deprotonated carboxylic groups.7 For example, aromatic multicarboxylates (benzene dicarboxylate, benzene tricarbox- ylate, benzene tetracarboxylate, heterocyclic carboxylates such as pyridine-, pyrazole-, and imidazole-carboxylates) have been widely investigated for the synthesis of MOFs.8 Compared to the above analogous multicarboxylates ligands, H3OABDC (OABDC = 5-oxyacetateisophthalate) (Chart 1) was scarcely used, which has two rigid carboxyl groups and one flexible carboxyl group with a suitable length, and was expected to combine the merits of a rigid and flexible carbox- ylate system employed in the self-assembly reaction.9 To assemble a three-dimensional (3D) framework from infinite nets, the bpy and bpe ligands as rigid dipyridyl spacers were chosen, whichhave proven to be goodcandidates for auxiliary ligands.10 Herein we report five novel complexes based on tetra- nuclear[M4(μ3-OH)2] clusters,[Co4(OABDC)2(OH)2(H2O)4]n3 (H2O)4.4n (1), [Ni4(OABDC)2(OH)2(H2O)4]n 3 (H2O)4n (2), [Co2(OABDC)(bpe)(OH)]n 3 (H2O)2.9n (3), [Zn2(OABDC)- (bpe)(OH)]n 3 (H2O)3.5n (4), and [Co2(OABDC)(bpy)(OH)]n 3 (H2O)2.2n (5) (bpe = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene; bpy = 4,40- bipyridine). 1 and 2 represent a rare two-dimensional (2D) CdI2 type layer adopting the OABDC ligand as the 3-con- nected node and the [M4(μ3-OH)2] cluster as the 6-connected node. By adding the bpe ligand as an organic linker, two microporous compounds (3 and 4) were acquired.

How- ever, compounds 3, 4, and 5 are unstable, and the loss of lattice water molecules occur at room temperature according to TGA. The absence of IR absorption bands around 1700 cm-1, attributed to the protonated carboxyl group, indicates the full deprotonation of the H3OABDC ligands in 1-5, as revealed by the single crystal structure analysis. The strong peaks at 1570 and 1392 cm-1 for 1, 1572 and 1393 cm-1 for 2, 1566 and 1368 cm-1 for 3, 1573 and 1367 cm-1 for 4, 1557 and 1370 cm-1 for 5 correspond to νasym and νsym of the coordinated carboxylate groups, respectively. Crystal Structure of [Co4(OABDC)2(OH)2(H2O)4]n 3 (H2O)4.4n (1) and [Ni4(OABDC)2(OH)2(H2O)4]n 3 (H2O)4n (2). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that the asymmetric unit of 1 contains four six-coordinated Co (II) centers, two OABDC ligands, two μ3-OH, four coordinated water molecules, and 4.4 free water molecules. As depicted in Figure 1a, four Co(II) centers are all located in the distorted octahedral geometry, but with two different kinds of co- ordination environments. Co1 and Co4 are respectively co- ordinated by two oxygen atoms from the ether and carboxyl of the flexible carboxylic group, two carboxylic oxygen atoms of the rigid carboxylic groups from the other two OABDC molecules, one oxygen atom from the μ3-OH group, and one from the coordinated water molecule, while Co2 and Co3 are separately bounded by two oxygen atoms from the rigid carboxylic groups of different OABDC molecules, two from the μ3-OH groups, one from the flexible carboxylic group, and one from the aqua ligand. The Co-O distances are within the normal range (Table 2). The coordination mode adopted by the OABDC ligand can be classified as μ6-(κ7O1: O10,O2: O20, O30: O30: O300), of which the ether oxygen atom of the flexible carboxylic group also participates to chelate Co(II) centers (see Figure 1, Supporting Information). The similar mode can also be found in complex [Zn2(OABDC)(OH)]n, of which the two rigid carboxylic groups employ the syn-syn and anti-syn pattern, respectively, while in 1, both two adopt the syn-syn fashion.9c The four Co(II) ions are located at four vertices of a defect dicubane (two cubanes sharing one face and each missing one vertex) with the Co 3 3 3 Co separations in the range of 3.113-3.558 A˚ , and the bridging Co-O-Co angles are all within the bound of reported complexes.14 The linkage between Co1 and Co2, Co3, and Co4 are achieved by one rigid carboxylic group, one carboxylic oxygen atom, and one μ3-OH group, while for Co2 and Co4, Co1, and Co3, the centers are connectedby one rigidcarboxylic groupandone μ3-OHgroup. This kind of connection mode is rare in metal-carboxylate based clusters according to the literature. The four Co(II) ions joined by the hydroxyl and carboxylic oxygen atoms act as an SBU and are jointly coordinated by Table 2.

From the view of topology, if taking the OABDC-3 ligand as a three-connected node and the [Co4(μ3-OH)2] cluster as a six-connected node, the framework can be simplified as a (3,6)-connected net, which is the same with [Cd2(OABDC)- (phen)2(μ3-OH)]n 3 1/3nH2O.9b The main difference is that the latter has two independent Cd(II) centers, and the four Cd ions of the Cd4(OH)2 unit are arranged in an absolute parallelogram with a larger window of 3.605  4.287 A˚ . As seen from Figure 1c, the 2D layer is composed of tetragons sharing edges or vertexes, corresponding to the CdI2-type layer structure, which is still rare in organic-inorganic hybrid materials.15 If considering the strong H-bond inter- actions between neighboring layers (the shortest O-H 3 3 3 O distance is 2.8 A˚ ), the whole structure will be a 3D micro- porous framework with channels running along the [100] direction occupied by free water molecules (see Figure 1d). The PLATON calculation16 shows that the effective void volume is 509.1 A˚ 3 per unit cell, which is 16.8% of the crystal volume. Complexes 2 and 1 are isomorphous, of which Ni1 and Ni4 are respectively bounded by three carboxylic oxygen atoms and one aqua molecule in the equatorial plane, and two oxygen atoms from μ3-OH and -OCH2- groups occupied the axial positions, while Ni2 and Ni3 are apart coordinated by one aqua molecule, one carboxylic, and two μ3-OH oxygen atoms in the basic plane, and two carboxylic oxygen atoms in the axial positions. The [Ni4(μ3-OH)2] clusters are also shaped by two μ3-OH groups, four rigid and two flexible carboxylic groups with the Ni 3 3 3 Ni separation in the range of 3.050-3.540 A˚ . The unit cell contains three free water molecules in 2, and thus the effective void volume is 482.7 A˚ , which is 16.2% of the crystal volume. Figure 1. (a) Ball-and-stick representation of 1.

Crystal Structure of [Co2(OABDC)(bpe)(OH)]n 3 (H2O)2.9n (3) and [Zn2(OABDC)(bpe)(OH)]n 3 (H2O)3.5n (4). Complexes 3 and 4 are also isomorphous, so take 3 for example. Single- crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that compound 3 crystallizes in the P1 space group and exhibits a 3D micro- porous framework with tfz-d topology. The asymmetric unit contains two crystallographically independent Co(II) centers, one OABDC-3 ligand, one bpe ligand, one μ3-OH group and 2.9 free water molecules (see Figure 2a). Co2 is six-coordinated in a slightly distorted octahedron geome- try defined by one N donor from the bpe ligand (Co-N = 2.121 A˚ ), two μ3-OH groups and one carboxylic oxygen donor in the equatorial plane, and two other carboxylic oxygen atoms in the axial positions, while Co1 is four coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral geometry which is composed of one N donor from the bpe ligand (Co-N = 2.026 A˚ ), one hydroxyl oxygen, and two carboxylic oxygen atoms from two rigid carboxylic groups (Co-O = 1.954-1.984 A˚ ). The OABDC ligand in 3 adopts a μ5-(κ5O1: O10,O2,O30: O300) coordination mode, which have not been seen in the reported compounds. The Co1 and Co2 atoms are bridged by one hydroxyl and two carboxylate groups with Co1 3 3 3 Co2 separation of 3.09 A˚ to form a dinuclear unit, which is further linked by μ3-OH into a tetranuclear cluster that is jointly coordinated by six OABDC anions and four bpe ligands. In the basic [Co4(μ3- OH)2] cluster, four Co(II) ions are located at four vertices of a defect dicubane like in 1 and 2. From another point of view, the four Co (II) ions can also be seen as lying in a parallelo- gram with a window of 3.09  3.511 A˚ . Each [Co4(μ3-OH)2] cluster is connected by six OABDC-3 ligands to form a 2D CdI2-type layer as in 1 and 2. Then the 2D nets are further pillared by rigid bpe ligands; thus channels can be seen running along the [100] direction with parallelogram windows of 8.16  16.40 A˚ (Figure 2b). Water molecules occupy the interspace to afford hydrogen bonds to stabilize its construction. The PLATON calculation shows that the effective void volume is 283.8 A˚ 3 per unit cell for 3 and 275.8 A˚ 3 for 4, corresponding to 22.4% and 21.9% of their respective crystal volume. The [Co4(μ3-OH)2] cluster is surrounded by six OABDC anions and four bpe ligands, while two bpe ligands doubly connect two clusters, which means that each cluster is linked by eight other neighboring ones. From the topology view, the tetranuclear cluster can be reduced as a 8-connected node and the OABDC-3 ligand as a 3-connected one. Since the two kinds of nodes are arranged in a ratio of Co4/OABDC= 1:2, the short Schl€afli symbol of the topology can be classified as the (43)2(46.618.84), corre- sponding to the tfz-d topology (Figure 2c). This type of topology is still rare, and few examples are reported accord- ing to the literature.17 Crystal Structure of [Co2(OABDC)(bpy)(OH)]n 3 (H2O)3n (5). Complex 5 is isostructural to complexes 3 and 4, which also features a 3D microporous nework based on a CdI2-type layer. As seen from Figure 3, Co1 is bounded by one N atom of a 4,40-bipy ligand (Co-N = 2.134 A˚ ), three O atoms of three individual OABDC ligands, and two O atoms of μ3- hydroxyl ligands (Co-O = 2.069 and 2.141 A˚ ) in a distorted octahedral geometry. Co2 is four coordinated by two O atoms of two individual OABDC ligands (Co-O = 1.955 and 1.959 A˚ ), one O atom of a μ3-OH ligand (Co-O 1.943 A˚ ), and one N atom of 4,40-bipy ligand (Co-N = 2.008 A˚ ) in a slightly distorted tetrahedral environment. The average Co-O distance of Co1 (2.1048 A˚ ) is appreciably longer than Figure 2. (a) View of the coordination environment of the Co(II) atom in 3. H atoms and lattice water molecules were omitted for clarity. Symmetry codes: a = 3 - x, -y, -z. (b) Polyhedral representation of the 3D microporous network showing paralle- logram channels along the [100] direction (green and pink repre- sent Co1 and Co2, respectively). Free water molecules in the channels have been omitted. (c) Scheme view of the (3,8)- connected tfz-d topology in 3 and 4 (Blue nodes represent OABDC-3 ligands and pink nodes represent [Co4(μ3-OH)2] clusters.) Article Crystal Growth & Design, Vol. 10, No. 2, 2010 539 in 3, while for Co2, the distance (1.952 A˚ ) is shorter than in 3 (1.969 A˚ ). Co1, Co2, and their inversion centers lie in an absolute parallelogram with a window of 3.150  3.604 A˚ , of which the Co 3 3 3 Co separation is larger than that in 3. The [Co4 (μ3-OH)2] cluster is jointly coordinated by six OABDC anions and four bpy ligands. Since the length of bpy is shorter than the bpe ligand, the whole framework has smaller channels along the [100] direction (Figure S2, Supporting Information). According to the PLATON calculation, the effective void volume is 178.1 A˚ 3 per unit cell, corresponding to 16.3% of the crystal volume. Thermogravimetric Analysis and X-ray Powder Diffrac- tion. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on crystalline samples from 40 to 700 C under a nitrogen atmosphere. A weight loss of 9.2% by 87 C was observed for 1, corresponding to the release of water molecules (calculated 9.1%). For 2, the removal of water molecules was completed by 109 C, indicated by a weight loss of 9.7% (calculated 9.2%). Decomposition of organic components started at 110.4 C for 1, and 170 C for 2. No obvious loss of water molecules occurred for complexes 3, 4, and 5, which may be due to the instability of the three compounds. The rapid decrease of organic components for 3, 4, and 5 appearred at 382, 392, and 318 C, respectively (Figure S3, Supporting Information). X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns have also been carried out for compounds 1 and 2. The measured XRPD patterns of the two compounds are in good agreement with the patterns simulated from the respective single-crystal data, confirming the bulk purity of the two samples (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Magnetic Properties. The temperature-dependent dc mag- netic susceptibility of compounds 1 and 2 has been mea- sured under a 1 kOe applied field in the temperature range of 2-300 K (Figure 4). For 1, the χMT value at 300 K is 13.58 cm3 K mol-1, which is larger than the expected value of 10.8 cm3 K mol-1 for four noninteracting CoII(S = 3/2) centers.14a Upon cooling of the sample, the χMT value smoothly decreases to 7.32 cm3 K mol-1 around 50 K, then sharply decreases to 0.38 cm3 K mol-1 at 2.0 K, which may be mainly ascribed to the spin-orbit coupling of Co(II) in 1.14b,18 The fitting of χM -1 vs T in the temperature range of 50-300 K obeys the Curie-Weiss law and gives θ = -60.95 K and C = 16.54 cm3 K mol-1. For 2, on decreasing the temperature, the χMT value increases gradually from the room temperature (300 K) value of 5.16 cm3 K mol-1 to the highest value of 10.0 cm3 K mol-1 at 15 K and then decreases abruptly to 6.63 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. This behavior indicates the ferromagnetic coupling within the NiII cations in 2.19 The χM -1 data above 50 K can be well reproduced based on the Curie- Weiss law with θ = 14.54 K and C = 4.95 cm3 K mol-1. Conclusion A family of five novel coordination polymers with similar tetranuclear clusters has been obtained with H3OABDC or H3OABDC-bpe/bpy mixedligands as organiclinkers.Byfine- tuning the pH value, two types of framework can be acquired. 1 and 2 display a 2D CdI2-based layer with small channels formed by H-bond interactions between neighboring layers. Strong antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic behaviors can be measured in 1 and 2, respectively. By employing the pyridyl ligands as the extended linkers, 3, 4, and 5 were obtained, all of which feature 3D microporous networks with nanochannels occupied by free water molecules. Our results manifest that assembly of infinite supramolecular networks from SBUs is a successfulmethod,whichcanalsobeexpandedtoothertransi- tionmetals.Withmoremulticarboxylateligandsbeing synthe- sized, this method may play a more important role in the crystal engineering filed.
