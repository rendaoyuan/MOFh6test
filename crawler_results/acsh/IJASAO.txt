Received April 26, 2010 Two isostructural lanthanide-organic frameworks (1 and 2) with 2-fold interpenetrating nets have been synthesized based on 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC). By application of an organic ligand with hindrance groups and a terminal chelating ligand to replace BDC and coordinated solvates, interpenetration has been effectively controlled. The gas-sorption properties of the noninterpenetrating net have been studied. The rational design and synthesisof porousmetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) received a great deal of attention because of their fascinating structures and intriguing poten- tials in applications such as separation, gas storage, etc.1-5 Almost all of the applications are highly determined by the porosity and stability of the porous MOFs. One effective way to increase the porosity of an MOF is to extend the size of the ligand sustaining the framework.6 However, extending the size of the ligand may lead to interpenetration of the frame- work and/or partial collapse of the framework upon guest molecule removal.7 Hence, how to control interpenetration to synthesize stable MOFs with high porosity becomes one of the most compelling challenges to chemists. Although several examples on controlling the interpene- tration of MOFs have been reported,8 two mainly efficient methods can be achieved: one is to apply an organic ligand containing large hindrance groups to prevent the formation of interpenetration (Scheme1), which has been reported less in the literature; the other is to use in situ generated rod- shaped secondary building units (SBUs). Recently, Yaghi and co-workers have reported a series of porous MOFs based on rod-shaped SBUs,9 in which the rigidity of the rod-shaped SBUs has efficiently avoided interpenetration and thus improved the porosity of the resulting frameworks. Very recently, temperature and concentration control over interpenetration in a cadmium-organic framework has been *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The solvothermal reaction of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) and ErCl33 6H2O or Tm(NO3)3 3 3H2O in DMF/ EtOH/H2O resulted in the formation of a large amount of prismatic crystals of 1 or 2. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that complexes 1 and 2 are isostructural and both crystallize in triclinic space group P1. The following discus- sions on the structural aspects will mainly be focused on com- plex 1. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of one erbium ion, three halves of BDC ligands, one coordinated DMF molecule, and one coordinated H2O molecule. The central erbium ion is eight-coordinated by six oxygen atoms from different BDC ligands, two oxygen atoms from one coordinated DMF molecule, and one coordinated H2O molecule with an average Er-O distance of 2.366(3) A˚ . Two erbium ions are bridged by two carboxylate groups to generate a binuclear SBU, which is further coordinated by four carboxylate groups from different BDC ligands in a chelating mode. Thus, the binuclear SBUs are further bridged by BDC ligands in different directions to give rise to a 3D porous framework containing 3D channels. The dimensions of the channels are 11.3  14.7 A˚ . Because of the existence of large channels in1, the final structure is a 2-fold interpenetrating framework. Two such porous nets interpene- trate each other, providing a 3D nonporous framework (Figure 1). If the binuclear SBU can be considered as a single node and the BDC ligand as a linear linker, then complex 1 would be a 2-fold interpenetrating pcu net. Interpenetration in 1 has limited porosity and application such as in gas storage, etc. To improve the porosity of the framework, the key is to control interpenetration to cons- truct a noninterpenetrating MOF. Interpenetration may derive from the existence of large channels without any sustenation.15 After careful analysis of the structure of 1, we found that the coordinated H2O and DMF molecules locateina position adjacent to the OH2O-Er-ODMF angle of 78.56. Hence, to control interpenetration, the following strategies can be achieved: (i) replacing the coordinated solvates by other chelating ligands such as phen, (ii) replacing the BDC ligand by another analogical ligand with a hindrance group, or (iii) their combination. Thus, the solvothermal reaction of H2BDC or H2TBDC and ErCl3 3 6H2O or Tm(NO3)3 3 3H2O in DMF/EtOH/H2O gave rise to complexes 3-5 (Figure 2). Compared to complex 1, complex 3 is synthesized by replacing coordinated DMF and H2O molecules in complex 1 with chelating phen ligands, and complex 4 is based on H2TBDC, instead of H2BDC, but the coordinated solvates are unchanged, while in complex 5, both H2BDC and coordinated solvates are replaced by H2TBDC and chelating phen ligands, respectively. Com- plexes 3-5 possess the same topology with complex 1, but no interpenetrating frameworks. The following discussions on the structural aspects will mainly be focused on complex 5. Scheme 1.

Communication Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 49, No. 17, 2010 7607 The asymmetric unit of 5 consists of one erbium ion, three halves of TBDC ligands, and one coordinated phen molecule. The coordination environment of the central erbium ion re- mains unchanged with that in complex 1, except that the two coordinated solvates in complex 1 are replaced by the chelat- ing ligand of phen in complex 2 (Figure 2), with the N-Er-N angle being 65.7, which is smaller than the OH2O-Er-ODMF angle in complex 1. The coordination modes of carboxylate groups of TBDC also remain unchanged with those of BDC in complex 1. As expected, because of the steric hindrance of the methyl groups in the TBDC ligand as well as the rigid phen ligand, complex 5 is a noninterpenetrating porous framework with the methyl groups of TBDC and the coordinated phen ligand pointing toward the pores to partly block the channels (Figure 3). The resulting dimensions of the channels are 6.9  5.09, 6.0  5.09, and 8.1  5.13 A˚ (from atom to atom) along the [1 0 0], [0 1 0], and [0 0 1] directions, respectively, with a solvent-accessible volume of 38.9% calculated with PLATON. In order to check the permanent porosity of complex 5, variousgas-adsorptionstudieshavebeenperformed(Figure4). The gas-adsorption behaviors of the activated complex 5, which had been vacuum-dried at 120 C after soaking in me- thanol, have been studied for N2, Ar, and H2 at 77 K and for CO2 at 195 K. The N2 and Ar (kinetic diameter: 3.64 A˚ for N2 and 3.54 A˚ for Ar) sorption isotherms did not indicate any appreciable amount of adsorption, presumably because of the limited pore size. However, the activated complex 5 can adsorb a moderate amount of CO2 (51 cm3 g-1) and H2 (56 cm3 g-1, 0.49% wt%), with type I behavior. Derived from the CO2 adsorption data, complex 5 has a Langmiur surface area of 141 m2 g-1. Considering the kinetic diameters of 2.89 A˚ for H2, 3.3 A˚ for CO2, and 3.54 A˚ for Ar, it can be speculated that the pore opening of activated 5 should fall into the range from 3.3 to 3.54 A˚ , which only allows CO2 and H2 to enter the channels. In summary, we have synthesized two 3D interpenetrating lanthanide-organic frameworks (1 and 2) with pcu nets based on binuclear lanthanide SBUs. By application of steric hindrance effects, three types of porous noninterpenetrating lanthanide-organic frameworks (3-5) have been construc- ted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systemic research on control over interpenetration in lanthanide- organic frameworks. The results and conclusions of these investigations are summarized as follows: (i) the replacement of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid with its derivative 2,3,5,6- tetramethyl-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid containing hin- drance groups or coordinated solvates with chelating phen ligands has effectively controlled the interpenetration with- out changing the original topology; (ii) owing to the use of a carboxylate ligand with a hindrance group and the large terminal ligand in the construction of complex 5, the pore opening is limited to a narrow scale, which makes complex 5 possess adsorption selectivity of CO2 and H2 over N2 and Ar, although the selectivity is lower compared to other reported results.16 Our research provides an effective strategy on con- trol over interpenetration in MOFs. In particular, the strat- egy of using ligands with hindrance groups to block inter- penetration may generate porous MOFs with wavy channels and a limited size of free passage, which may possess excellent gas storage capability or selectivity.17 The gas-adsorption measurement for complexes 3 and 4, as well as synthesis of other noninterpenetrating lanthanide- organic frameworks with high thermal stability, is currently underway and will be reported in a full paper.

Thermogravimetric experiments were performed using a TGA/SDTA851 instrument (heating rate of 10˚C/min, argon stream). Elementary analyses were carried out in the elementary analysis group of this institute. X-ray experimental Crystallographic data for 1–5 were collected on a Bruker Smart APEXII CCD diffractometer with MoKα(λ = 0.71073 Å) at room temperature. All structures were solved by the direct method using the SHELXS program of the SHELXTL package and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method with SHELXL. The metal atoms in each complex were located from the E-maps, and other non-hydrogen atoms were located in successive difference Fourier syntheses and refined with anisotropic thermal parameters on F2. The organic hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically (C-H 0.96 Å). Due to the large number of disordered counterions and solvent molecules in 5, SQUEEZE routine in PLATON was employed in the structural refinement of 5.

Er(BDC)1.5(dmf)(H2O) (1) A mixture of ErCl3·6H2O (40 mg, 0.11 mmol) and H2BDC (20 mg, 0.12 mmol) was suspended in the solution of DMF/EtOH (V/V = 2:1, 10 ml) and heated in teflon-lined steel bomb at 110℃ for 4 days. The pink block crystals were collected, washed with water and dried in the air. Yield: 64% (based on H2BDC).

The two types of BDC ligand with different coordination modes in 1. There are two types of BDC ligands that adopt different coordination modes: 1) both carboxylate groups adopt chelating mode to link one erbium ion (aBDC); 2) both carboxylate groups adopt bidentate bridging mode to connect two erbium ions (bBDC). Figure S3. The two interpenetrating pcu nets in complex 1. Figure S4. The coordination environment of Er ions in complex 3, showing the binuclear SBU. The central Er ion adopts the similar coordination geometry with the Er ion in complex 1, except that the coordinated dmf and water molecules in 1 are replaced by chelating phen ligand. The average Er-O and Er-N distances are 2.344(5) and 2.468(7) Å, respectively. The BDC ligand adopt the similar coordination mode with those in complexes 1 and 2, to connect the binuclear SBUs to form the 3D non-interpenetrating framework with pcu net. Figure S5. The 3D non-interpenetrating framework of 3 along a axis, showing the coordinated phen ligands (yellow color) in the channels. There exists strong π···π stacking between the coordinated phen ligands (3.534 Å). Figure S6. The 3D porous framework of 3 along [1 1 1] direction showing the channels, in which the uncoordinated solvates reside. The solvent-accessible volume calculated with PLATON is 24.0%. Figure S7.

Different from complexes 1-3, the TBDC ligand in complex 4 possesses three types of coordination modes. Type a: each carboxylate group adopts chelating mode to link one Tm ion; type b: each carboxylate group adopts chelate-bridging mode to connect two Tm ions; type c: each carboxylate group adopts monodentate mode to link one Tm ion. Figure S10. The 2D layer in complex 4. The three types of TBDC play different roles in the formation of the 3D framework. The TBDC ligands in types a and b coordination modes connect the binuclear SBU to form a 2D grid, with the dimensions of 9.955 × 15.166 Å. The 2D layers are further connected by the TBDC in type c mode to give rise to a 3D non-interpenetrating framework with pcu net. Figure S11. The 3D porous framework of complex 4 along a axis. The uncoordinated solvates reside in the channels. The solvent-accessible volume calculated with PLATON is 53.8.0%, which is significantly larger than that of complex 3. Figure S12.

TGA for complexes 1, and 5. TGA measurement on complexes 1 and 5 revealed that all three complexes can be stable up to 450 oC. For complex 1, there is no weight loss from 50 to 150 oC. The first weight loss of 17.5 % from 150 to 210 oC is in accordance with the loss of one coordinated dmf and one coordinated water molecules (calcd: 18.1%). We could not determine the second weight loss of 4.2% from 210 to 290 oC. There is no weight loss from 290 to 570 oC, and after 570 oC, 1 starts to decompose. For complex 5, the gradual weight loss of 17.6% from 40 to 260 oC corresponds to the loss of two uncoordinated dmf molecules and one uncoordinated water molecule (calcd: 19.5%). There is no weight loss from 260 to 480 oC, and after 480 oC, 5 starts to decompose.
