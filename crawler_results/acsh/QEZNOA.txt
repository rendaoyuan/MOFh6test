Manuscript Inﬂuence of Halogen Bonding Interaction on Supramolecular Assembly of Coordination Compounds; Head-to-Tail N···X Synthon Repetitivity Hamid Reza Khavasi* and Alireza Azhdari Tehrani Faculty of Chemistry, Shahid Beheshti University, General Campus, Evin, Tehran 1983963113, Iran * S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: In this study, N-(3-halophenyl)-2-pyrazinecarboxamide ligands, L3‑F, L3‑Cl, L3‑Br, and L3‑I, carrying a diﬀerent halogen atom on the phenyl meta-position and N-phenyl-2-pyrazinecarboxamide ligand, LH, have been employed for the synthesis of 12 mercury(II) complexes, [HgCl2(LH)]n, 1, [HgCl2(L3‑Cl)]n, 2, [Hg2Cl4(L3‑Br)2], 3, [Hg2Cl4(L3‑I)2], 4, [Hg2Br4(LH)2], 5, [HgBr2(L3‑F)], 6, [HgBr2(L3‑Cl)], 7, [HgBr2(L3‑Br)], 8, [HgBr2(L3‑I)], 9, [Hg2I4(LH)2], 10, [HgI2(L3‑Br)], 11, and [HgI2(L3‑I)]n, 12. Interestingly, structural analysis clearly shows that, by the replacing of coordinated anions from chloride with bromide and iodide in each series containing the same ligand, the coordination geometry and structural motif of the resulting compounds have been dramatically aﬀected. One of the common features in the crystal structures of these complexes is that there is a strong tendency to form halogen bonding synthons between adjacent halophenyl and pyrazine rings. The inﬂuence of these halogen bonding interactions on the supramolecular assemblies has been discussed with the help of geometrical analysis and theoretical calculations. The X···N halogen bonding distances are 2.5−9.4% shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of nitrogen and halogen atoms. Theoretical methods also show the halogen bonding energies within a range of −27.86 to −46.15 kJ·mol−1. In all complexes synthesized here, the pyrazine ring is coordinated to the mercury(II) ion through the N atom syn to the carbonyl. Therefore, the second common feature of the crystal structures for complexes studied here is the selectivity of the metal ion coordination site. The halogen bond synthon repetitivity across these compounds and selectivity in the mercury(II) ion coordination site further point to application in the coordination crystal engineering research ﬁeld. ■INTRODUCTION Structural assemblies in coordination compounds rely on a range of directional and nondirectional intermolecular interactions to hold the components together. The most extensively exploited of these interactions is highly directional hydrogen bonding.1 The inﬂuence of π···π, cation···π, anion···π, lone-pair···π, and metal···π interactions is also well accepted among supra- molecular coordination chemists.2 Another interaction that has more recently become of interest as a construction tool in the ﬁeld of crystal engineering is directional attractive halogen bonding interaction (hereafter referred to as XB). The XB, denoted in the general form D···X−Y (Y = C, N, halogen, etc.), refers to any noncovalent interaction involving a halogen as the acceptor of electron density, a Lewis acid, and an electron- donating atom, D, as a Lewis base.3 Various types of XB, including R-X···Nu, X2···Nu, R-X1···X2-R, R-X1···X2-M, and R- X1···X2−, where Nu is a nucleophile, R-Xi is a haloalkyl group, X2 is a dihalogen molecule, Xi−is a halide anion, and M is a metal, have been studied in detail.4 Although the role of XB in metal- containing crystal structures and analogies and diﬀerences with respect to hydrogen bonds have been reviewed by Brammer5 and Received: September 28, 2012 Article pubs.acs.org/IC © XXXX American Chemical Society A dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic3021113 | Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX Bertani and co-workers,6 compared to organic systems, to our knowledge, far less attention has been paid to systematic studies that examine the eﬀect of halogen bonding on the supra- molecular aggregation of coordination complexes. To make progress in controlling speciﬁc interactions in the solid state of coordination compounds, it is desirable to synthesize a series of coordination compounds of predetermined chemical structure, allowing for a comparison between assemblies with speciﬁc and controllable changes to their molecular structure. Recently, the possibility of using CO···X (X = Cl, Br, I) halogen bonds for directed assembly in copper(II) coordination compounds containing β-diketonate moieties bearing chloro, bromo, and iodo substituents has been systematically studied by Aakeröy and co-workers.7 In 2008, competition between coordination network formation and halogen bond network formation using copper(II) iodobenzoate units was reported by Brammer and co-workers.8 On the other hand, with the exploration of how weak interactions work individually or cooperatively in the supra- molecular structure, the identiﬁcation of reproducible synthons in the supramolecular structures is an important line of research.9 In this regard, even failed attempts at supramolecular assembly can oﬀer some insight into discovering how intermolecular interactions can be ranked in terms of structural eﬀectiveness. Assembly of discrete copper(II) and cobalt(II) coordination compounds into 1D linear chains using halogen bond interactions has been investigated by Aakeröy, and the results showed that attempts at creating desired architectures had failed.10 In Ward and co-worker’s paper, the repetitivity of C− I···NC(Ru) halogen bonds in [Ru(bipy)(CN)4]2−salts contain- ing iodinated cations has been shown, while the analogous brominated cations do not exhibit halogen bond interactions.11 During our research eﬀort on π−π stacking,12a C−H···π12b interaction, and ligand substituent eﬀect12c in the crystal packing of mercury coordination compounds containing pyrazine carboxamide ligands, that the authors are developing, the eﬀect of halogen bonding on the three-dimensional supramolecular architecture of coordination compounds has herein been reported. In this Article, a series of N-(3-halophenyl)-2- pyrazinecarboxamide ligands, L3‑F, L3‑Cl, L3‑Br, and L3‑I, and N- phenyl-2-pyrazinecarboxamide ligand, LH (Scheme 1), carrying a diﬀerent halogen atom in the phenyl meta-position, have been employed for the synthesis of mercury(II) complexes in order to get insights into the eﬀect of halogen bonding interactions on the structural assembly of the complexes. Because of the freedom of C−C and C−N single bond rotations in these ligands, the pyrazine and halophenyl rings can be freely twisted to meet the requirements of the coordination geometries of metal atoms and intermolecular interactions in the assembly process. Twelve Hg(II) complexes of these ligands, [HgCl2(LH)]n, 1, [HgCl2- (L3‑Cl)]n, 2, [Hg2Cl4(L3‑Br)2], 3, [Hg2Cl4(L3‑I)2], 4, [Hg2Br4- (LH)2], 5, [HgBr2(L3‑F)], 6, [HgBr2(L3‑Cl)], 7, [HgBr2(L3‑Br)], 8, [HgBr2(L3‑I)], 9, [Hg2I4(LH)2], 10, [HgI2(L3‑Br)], 11, and [HgI2(L3‑I)]n, 12, have been prepared by the reaction of equimolar quantities of mercury(II) halides (chloride, bromide, and iodide) in a methanol solution (Scheme 1). The structural details show that the presence of Cl, Br, and I atoms in the meta- position of the N-phenyl ring signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the structural assembly of the resulting mercury(II) complexes and the ligands are pointed toward the adjacent molecules to generate simple or head-to-tail N···X (X = Cl, Br, I) halogen bond synthons. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis. The ligands LH, L3‑F, L3‑Cl, L3‑Br, and L3‑I were prepared by simply mixing the same equivalents of meta- haloaniline or aniline and pyrazinecarboxylic acid in pyridine in the presence of triphenyl phosphite.13 The reaction of equimolar Scheme 1.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX B amounts of these ligands and HgX2 (X = Cl, Br, and I) in methanol gave the corresponding complexes. Slow evaporation of the solvent resulted in air-stable block crystals of 1, 3−5, 8, and 10−12; prism crystals of 2, 7, and 9; and needle crystals of 6, after a few days. Attempts were made to form complexes with HgCl2 and HgI2 using the L3‑F ligand and HgI2 using the L3‑Cl ligand. Yet unfortunately, no mercury-containing species were isolated from the reaction mixtures. Crystallographic data for compounds 1− 12 are listed in Table 1. Selected bond distances and angles are summarized in Table 2. Structural Analysis of HgCl2 Complexes, [HgCl2(LH)]n, 1, [HgCl2(L3‑Cl)]n, 2, [Hg2Cl4(L3‑Br)2], 3, and [Hg2Cl4(L3‑I)2], 4. A simple reaction between HgCl2 and LH, L3‑Cl, L3‑Br, and L3‑I in methanol aﬀorded well-formed crystals of 1−4. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of one crystallographically independent Hg2+ ion, one N-phenyl-2-pyrazinecarboxamide, LH, and two chloride ions. As depicted in Figure 1a, in this compound, the highly distorted tetrahedral geometry of the Hg(II) center can be better described as a seesaw structure. The Cl−Hg−Cl angle is 176.17(10)°, where the two Hg−Cl bonds form the plank (Table 2). The angle between the other two bonds (Table 2), which form the pivot, is 90.0(2)°. The Cl−Hg−Cl and N−Hg−O planes are nearly perpendicular, with a dihedral angle of 87.0(4)°. For this complex, the four-coordinate geometry index, τ4, of 0.64 ﬁts with a seesaw description.14 Compound 2 crystallizes in the P1̅ space group. The asymmetric unit of 2 consists of one Hg2+ ion, two halogen anions, and one crystallographically independent ligand. As Table 1.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX C depicted in Figure 1b, the coordination geometry around the metal center is a square-based pyramid (SBP) (Table 2) with a trigonality index, τ5,15 of 0.03. In this structure, the plane of the square-based pyramid is occupied by four halogen anions (Table 2). The apical position is occupied by a nitrogen atom from the pyrazine ring of the L3‑Cl ligand at a normal distance of 2.575(5) Å. As it is clear from the τ5 value and geometrical parameters around the central metal atom (Table 2), the coordination geometry around Hg(II) is almost perfect SBP. Dinuclear isostructural compounds 3 and 4 consist of two diﬀerent mercury environments. In these compounds, each asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically independent mercury centers, four chloride ions, and two neutral L3‑Br or L3‑I ligands (Figure 1c,d). The Hg1 atom is located in a three coordination environment, chelating with two chloride atoms and one pyrazine nitrogen atom from the ligand L3‑X (X = Br, I) (Table 2). The Cl−Hg−Cl angle of 169.44(2)° and 169.81(9)° for 3 and 4, respectively, shows that the geometry around the metal center is slightly distorted T-shaped. In these compounds, the L3‑X ligand acts as an angular bridge via the carbonyl oxygen and the pyrazine nitrogen atoms to link Hg1 and Hg2 ions. The coordination geometry around the Hg2 atom in compounds 3 and 4 can be described as a seesaw structure with a τ4 index of 0.67 for both complexes, with nearly linear Cl−Hg−Cl (Table 2) forming the plank, and N−Hg−O (Table 2) for 3 and 4 forming the pivot. The dihedral angles between the Cl−Hg−Cl and N− Hg−O planes are 83.78(6)° and 84.91(7)° for 3 and 4, Table 2.

We propose a simple geometry index for almost planar three-coordinate complexes, trigonal-planar index, τ3, eq 1 τ α β γ α = | + + −| − || [( )/360] ( 120)/60 3 (1) inspired by Houser’s four-cooordinate τ4 index14 and Addison and Reedijk’s ﬁve-coordinate τ5 index.15 In this equation, α is the largest angle in the three-coordinated complex. The values of τ3 will range from 1.00 for a perfect trigonal-planar geometry, since [(120 + 120 + 120)/360] −[(120 −120)/60] = 1 −0 = 1, to zero for a perfect T-shaped geometry, since [(180 + 90 + 90)/ 360] −[(180 −120)/60] = 1.00 −1.00 = 0. Therefore, this parameter can be used for almost planar three-coordinate complexes since trigonal-planar and T-shaped geometries are the extremes. Trigonal-planar index, τ3, for Hg1 in compound 3 and 4 is 0.17 for both complexes. In 1, the adjacent mercury atoms are linked by CO−Hg bonds to form a 1D linear polymeric chain spanning along the a axis (Figure 2a). In this compound, the phenyl ring involved in the intramolecular π−π stacking interaction with the adjecent pyrazine rings is arranged in such a way that the angle between the plane (containing C−CO−N fragment) normal and the O− Hg vector (for geometrical deﬁnition, see ref 12a) reaches about 36.81(6)°. In πphen···πpyz interactions, the centroid−centroid distance is 3.569(5) Å. Such π−π interaction eﬀects on the primary structure directing the coordination geometry around Hg(II), which contain similar ligands to those discussed in this paper, have previously been reported in detail by some of us.12a As shown in Figure 2b, these 1D linear chains are further linked to each other from one side by head-to-tail dimeric Cphen− H···Hg−Cl and Cphen−H···OC nonclassical hydrogen bonds (Table S1, Supporting Information), and from the other side by head-to-tail Hg···Cl contacts and Hg···πphen intermolecular interactions (Table 3). Coordination geometry and intermo- lecular interactions of compound 1 are illustrated in Scheme 2. Within the asymmetric unit of 2, each mercury coordinates to the nitrogen donor atom of the pyrazine ring, the N atom syn to the carbonyl, of the L3‑Cl ligand, while each chloride atom in the basal plane bridges two adjacent metal centers to generate a 1D double-chain motif in the a direction (Figure 3a). The planar organic ligands stack along both sides of the HgCl skeleton, and the distance between their mean planes is 3.933(1) Å (Figure 3a). These 1D chains are further linked to adjacent ones by Hg···Cl contacts to generate a double chain in the a direction (Table 3). The resulting double chains are further linked to adjacent chains from one side by head-to-tail dimeric Cphen− Figure 1.

The coordina- tion geometry and the intermolecular interactions of compound 2 are illustrated in Scheme 2. In isostructural 3 and 4, the two independent dinuclear moieties are closely packed through head-to-tail Hg···Cl contacts (Table 3) to generate dimeric units (Figure 4a). Adjacent dimeric units are further linked to each other by head-to-tail N···Br/I halogen bonds (Figure 4b). In the packing of these complexes, the overall supramolecular structure results from the linkage of neighboring units of Hg···πphen, Cphen−H···OC, and Cphen− H···Cl−Hg with nonclassical hydrogen bonds (Figure 4c).

Structural Analysis of HgBr2 Complexes, [Hg2Br4(LH)2], 5, [HgBr2(L3‑F)], 6, [HgBr2(L3‑Cl)], 7, [HgBr2(L3‑Br)], 8, [HgBr2(L3‑I)], 9. The reaction of 1 equiv of HgBr2 with 1 equiv of LH in methanol produces a dinuclear mercury complex, 5, with a 12-membered ring (Figure 5a). This compound displays 2/m point symmetry in the solid state, making half of the molecules crystallographically unique. Metal is in a seesaw geometry, with a four-coordinate geometry index, τ4, of 0.64, coordinated by two Br atoms (Table 2) at the plank and one pyrazine nitrogen atom of the LH ligand and one carbonyl oxygen atom of the second LH ligand (Table 2), which form the pivot. The recent LH ligand acts as an angular bridge via carbonyl oxygen and pyrazine nitrogen Table 3.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX F atoms to link Hg1 and Hg1i (symmetry code: (i) x, 2 −y, 2 −z) ions. The Br−Hg−Br and N−Hg−O planes are nearly perpendicular, with a dihedral angle of 80.17(9)°. The coordination geometries around the Hg atom in 6−9 are similar and made up of discrete neutral HgBr2L3‑X units. Figure 5b−e depicts the representative molecular structure showing the arrangement about the Hg(II) center for 6−9, and selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 2. The Hg atom lies in a T-shaped structure deﬁned by two bromide atoms and one the pyrazine nitrogen atom of the L3‑X ligand (Table 2). Trigonal- planar indexes, τ3, for these compounds are 0.27, 0.32, 0.33, and 0.35, respectively (Table 4). The angle between the Br−Hg−Br plane and the pyrazine ring for 6 is 6.87(9)° and for 7−9 is almost 0.00°. In 5, the structure is stabilized by an ordered network of intermolecular π···π interactions that exist between the pyrazine and phenyl rings (Figure 6, Table 3). In these πphen···πpyz interactions, the centroid−centroid distance is 3.847(5) Å. As shown in Figure 6, these π···π interactions cooperate with Cphen− H···Br−Hg and Cpyz−H···Br−Hg to further link to each other from one side by head-to-tail dimeric Hg−Cl···H−Cphen nonclassical hydrogen bonds (Table S1, Supporting Informa- tion). The coordination geometry and intermolecular inter- actions of compound 4 are illustrated in Scheme 2. In compounds 6−9, discrete units are linked to adjacent ones by Hg···Br contacts to generate a double-stranded stair motif (Figures 7a, 8a, and 9a). In these compounds, the Hg···Br contacts of 3.378(4) and 3.454(4) Å for 6 and 3.401(1), 3.411(1), and 3.443(1) Å for 7−9, respectively (Table 3), are comparable to those previously reported (3.385(1) Å) by Wu et al.16a The resulting double chains are further linked to adjacent chains by πphen···−NHCO−interactions (Figures 7a and 8a and Table 3). In 6, these chains are further linked to adjacent chains by Cphen−H···Br−Hg and Cpyz−H···F−C intermolecular inter- actions (Table S1, Supporting Information), while in 7−9, cooperation of Npyz···Cl/Br/I halogen bonds and Cphen− H···OC nonclassical hydrogen bonds are main factors in the generation of supramolecular assemblies (Figures 7b, 8b, and 9b). It is notable that compounds 8 and 9 have isostructural coordination geometries, and intermolecular interactions of compounds 6−9 are illustrated in Scheme 2. Structural Analysis of HgI2 Complexes, [Hg2I4(LH)2], 10, [HgI2(L3‑Br)]n, 11, and [HgI2(L3‑I)]n, 12. In compound 10, the metal center has the same seesaw geometry observed in compounds 1 and 5, with two iodide atoms as the plank, and one iodide and one pyrazine nitrogen atom in the pivot position (Table 2). For this complex, the four-coordinate geometry index, τ4, is 0.70. In this compound, each discrete molecular unit consists of a centrosymmetric dinuclear iodo-bridge Hg2I2 fragment. This bridged Hg2I2 forms a unsymmetric tetra-atomic rhombohedral plane (Figure 10a). In 1D structures of 11 and 12, each asymmetric unit consists of one crystallographically independent Hg center, two iodide ions, and one neutral L3‑Br or L3‑I ligand. In both structures, the coordination geometry around the Hg center is square-based pyramid (SBP) (Figure 10b,c), respectively, with a trigonality index, τ5, of 0.09 and 0.03, respectively. In both structures of 11 and 12, the plane of square-based pyramid is occupied by iodide anions (Table 2). The apical position in both structures is occupied by a nitrogen atom from the pyrazine ring of the L ligand at a normal distance of 2.474(10) and 2.484(7) Å for 11 and 12, respectively. As it is clear from the τ5 values and geometrical parameters around the central metal atoms (Table 2), Hg has a slightly distorted SBP environment in both compouds. In 10, the dinuclear units are further linked to adjacent ones from one side by Cphen−H···I−Hg nonclassical hydrogen bonds (Figure 11a) and from the other side by πpyz···πphen intermolecular interactions (Figure 11b and Table 3). The coordination geometry and intermolecular interactions of compound 10 are illustrated in Scheme 2. In 11 and 12, the arrangement of the asymmetric units deﬁnes the well-known double-stranded stair motif16 (Figure 12a). In this stair 1D polymer, the translation axis is parallel to the b direction. In these compounds, the Hg−I bond distance of 3.4957(5) and 3.5182(4) Å is comparable to that previously reported (3.3773(5) Å) by Popovic et al.16b The I1 atom adopts a μ3 mode to bridge three Hg atoms, while I2 is coordinated to metal centers as a terminal ligand. The iodide anion in the stair is tricoordinated with distorted T-shaped geometry (diagonal I···I = 4.3733(9) and 4.4005(6) Å for 11 and 12, respectively). The organic ligand moieties approximately preserve their planarity and stack along both sides of the HgI skeleton (Figure 12a). These 1D chains are further linked by head-to-tail Npyz···Br/I halogen bonds in the other direction (Figure 12b). Coordination geometries and intermolecular interactions of compounds 11 and 12 are illustrated in Scheme 2. Inﬂuence of Halide Counteranion and Halogen Bonding on Coordination Geometry and Supramolecular Assembly. Progress in controlling the structural assemblies of coordination complexes in the solid state requires investigation of the families of compounds designed so that the eﬀects of diﬀerent factors on the resultant supramolecular and structural properties may be systematically delineated. In this regard, the eﬀect of halogen bonding and the eﬀect of diﬀerent halogen Figure 3.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX G anions on the coordination geometry and supramolecular architecture of the 12 coordination compound of mercury(II) have been studied. Much of the diﬀerence in the structural motifs can be explained by the changing of the halogen atom on the halophenyl ring, but the role of the diﬀerent halogen ions should not be neglected. Therefore, in the following discussion, ﬁrst, we will focus on controlling the eﬀect of the coordinated anion on the structural motif of the resulting coordination compounds. Inﬂuence of Halide Anion on Coordination Geometry and Supramolecular Assembly. It is well-known that anions play an important role in the crystal engineering of self-assembled coordination polymers.17 Some of us have recently demonstrated that cooperative noncovalent interactions can lead to the formation of one- or two-dimensional architectures under anion-directed self-assembly.18 Interestingly, structural analysis clearly shows that, by the replacing of coordinated anions from chloride with bromide and iodide in each series containing the same ligand, the coordination geometry and structural motif of the resulting compounds have been dramatically aﬀected. It seems that the size of the coordinated halides would make a substantial contribution to the local mercury coordination environment and can also aﬀect the extended structures.17a,18,19 In compounds 1, 5, and 10, where the carboxamide ligand, LH, is similar, all complexes have the same seesaw coordination geometries (Table 4, Scheme 2). Compound 1 shows a 1D linear chain structure. The situation for compounds 5 and 10 (where the chloride anion is replaced by bromide and iodide) is quite diﬀerent from that of compound 1. The diﬀerent structural motifs between 1, 5, and 10 are seemingly attributed to the anion size eﬀect. Unlike the formation of the 1D linear chain in 1, the bulkier Br and I ions in 5 and 10 are sterically hindered to form a larger aggregate. By replacing the coordinated anion from chloride to bromide and iodide, the supramolecular structure changed from 1D linear chains to dinuclear units (Table 4). Similar results were also observed for complexes 2 and 7. For complexes containing the L3‑Cl ligand with HgCl2 and HgBr2, 2 and 7, the coordination sphere changes from SBP for 2 to T-shape for 7 (Table 4, Scheme 2). The structural motifs in these compounds are also quite diﬀerent, and the 1D double chain in 2 is changed to a discrete monomer structure in 7. For HgX2 adducts, while the carboxamide ligand is L3‑Br, from 3 to 8 and to 11 (where counteranions are chloride, bromide, and iodide, resepectively), the coordination sphere changes from the seesaw/T-shape (for two crystallographically independent metal ions) in 3, to a T-shape in 8 and SBP in 11 (Table 4, Scheme 2). As listed in this table, compounds 3 and 8 show dinuclear and monuclear structures, respectievely, whereas compound 11 has a 1D ladder chain structure. In the case of 11, although increasing the size of the anion results in the formation of a larger molecular complex, the study of Hg−I distances indicates that two of the four Hg−I bond lengths in the basal plane, connecting Hg metal Figure 4.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX H centers through a Hg−I−Hg bridge, are much longer than the others, 3.496(1) Å, compared to the remaining Hg−I bond lengths, and deviate considerably from the average bond length (Table 2). It is noteworthy that a search of the Cambridge Structural Database20 for the Hg−I distance shows that there are only 8 out of a total of 468 hits that have values longer than 3.496 Å. In the recent series, the structural analysis conﬁrms that, as the size of the counteranion increases, the extended structures change signiﬁcantly. It can be anticipated that the halide steric factor cannot be the only factor dictating the coordination environment and extended structures but certainly plays an important role in this regard. As compounds 3 and 4, 8 and 9, and 11 and 12 are isostructural, for HgX2 adducts, while the carboxamide ligand is L3‑I (compounds 4, 9, and 12), the same trend as L3‑Br (compounds 3, 8, and 11) is observed (Table 4, Scheme 2). Inﬂuence of N···X Halogen Bonding Interaction on Supramolecular Assembly. The compounds studied here were designed to probe the inﬂuence of halogen bonding interactions on the supramolecular assembly of similar coordination compounds. Organic ligands with ﬂexible torsions can indeed generate dissimilar conformations with diﬀerent halogen bond patterns and packing modes. The common feature in the crystal structures of complexes obtained from the reaction between HgX2 and L3‑Cl, L3‑Br and L3‑I ligands is the existence of a N···X halogen bond. Thus, a systematic evaluation of supramolecular synthons consisting of N···X halogen bonding interactions in a series of conformationally ﬂexible mercury complexes containing halophenyl pyridazinamides is interesting. In these compounds, since the halophenyl ring is ﬂexible in rotation around the Namide−Cphen bond, this allows subtle conformational adaptation of L3‑X to produce additional synthons via the rotation of the halophenyl ring. In all Hg(II) complexes reported here, the coordination of the pyrazine ring occurred through the N atom syn to the carbonyl and the N atom anti to the carbonyl is involved in classical intramolecular N− H···N hydrogen bonds. Because of the presence of such intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the pyrazine-CONH moiety is approximately planar, and C5O1 and C4−N1 bonds are in the anti position. Therefore, the conformational variation of L3‑X can be discussed by a dihedral angle of O1C5−C8−X, which is listed in Table 5 for compounds 1−12. As in compounds 3 and 4, each asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically independent L3‑X ligands; two diﬀerent values for this angle are listed in Table 5. According to the direction of the CO and C− X bonds, the L3‑X ligands can be arranged in anti and syn conformations (Scheme 3). In the presence of this ﬂexibility, the halogen atom of the halophenyl ring is pointed toward the adjacent molecule to generate diﬀerent synthons. Two basic halogen bond synthons (Scheme 3) were observed in the mercury complexes examined. Compound 7 adopts the syn conformation while the others, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, and 12, adopt anti conformations. It is notable that these two diﬀerent con- formations play diﬀerent roles in the formation of packing. The syn-conformational L3‑Cl ligand generates a single Cl···N halogen bond in 7, whereas in the complexes of HgX2 with L3‑Br and L3‑I, and also HgCl2 with L3‑Cl, the anti-conformational ligands generate a head-to-tail halogen bond synthon (Table 5). Table 5 provides a summary of the geometrical parameter of the halogen bonding synthons observed in 2−4, 7−9, 11, and 12. These results show that there is a strong tendency to form halogen bonding synthons between adjacent halophenyl and pyrazine rings, in order to stabilize the packing of these compounds. As it is clear from Table 5, halogen bonds show geometries consistent with a donor−acceptor binding model in which the pyrazine nitrogen atom serves as the electron donor and the halocarbon C−X bond serves as the acceptor. In complexes containing the L3‑Cl ligand, 2 and 7, contact distances of Cl···N were 3.190(6) and 3.217(5) Å, respectively (Table 5), indicating a 3.3% and 2.5% reduction of the sum of van der Waals radii.21 The Br···N halogen bonding distances in compounds 3, 8, and 11, complexes containing the L3‑Br ligand, were found between 3.100(3) and 3.251(9) Å, which are 8.8−4.4% shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of nitrogen and bromide atoms.21 Figure 5.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX I Since iodide is the most polarizable atom, it would have a higher positive charge than bromide and chloride. This should also aﬀect the intermolecular bond strength, which is indeed reﬂected in the observed distance between I and N (of C−I···N) (Table 5). The C−I···N intermolecular distances in compounds 4, 9, and 12, containing the L3‑I ligand, were found to be between 3.198(7) and 3.300(9) Å, which are 9.4−6.5% shorther than the sum of the van der Waals radii of nitrogen and iodide atoms.21 As expected,22 Table 5 shows that the strength of the halogen bond increases from chloride to bromide and further to iodide. Besides the N···X distance, another contributing factor to halogen bond strength is the halogen bond angle C−X···N. The C−X···N angles are all close to linearity, which is consistent with the theory of electron donation into the C−X σ* orbitals of the X-bond donor.23 The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) was analyzed for halogen bonding of 2−4, 7−9, 11, and 12 to determine the common range of NM−X···N interactions, where NM is a nonmetal and nonhalogen and X is Cl, Br, or I (Figure 13).20 Table 4.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX J Similar plot correlations have been reported for C−I···N halogen bonds.24 This ﬁgure reveals that all parameters for determining these interactions are in the normal range. Therefore, it seems that the driving force for the crystal formation of these compounds is a halogen bond between the pyrazine nitrogen atom and the halogen atom on the halophenyl ring. It was thought of interest to further investigate the XB energy in these compounds by using theoretical methods. The binding energies obtained from DFT on two relative fragments (from complexes 2−4, 7−9, 11, and 12) provide us an opportunity to evaluate the complexes involving XB interactions. Calculations were performed with the experimental structures as the starting point at the LDA-ZORA-TZP level. The outcomes obtained from DFT methods are listed in Table 5. From these data, it is explicit that halogen bonding energies vary within a range of −27.86 to −46.15 kJ·mol−1. In view of the directionality and Figure 9.

Structural analysis clearly shows that the size of the coordinated halides would make a substantial contribution to the local mercury coordination environment and can also aﬀect the extended structures. In each series containing the same ligand, the bulkier Br and I ions are sterically hindered to form a larger molecule. The crystal packing of the studied compounds is determined mostly by C−H···O/X (X = F, Cl, Br, I) nonclassical hydrogen bonds and π···π/Hg/amide and Hg···X intermolecular interactions. Since the halophenyl ring is ﬂexible in rotation around the Namide−Cphen bond, it allows for subtle conforma- tional adaptation of L3‑X (X = Cl, Br, I) to produce additional halogen bond synthons via the rotation of the halophenyl ring. In view of the directionality and strength of the halogen bonds, the Npyz···Cl/Br/I interaction can be recognized as an eﬀective Table 5.

The N···X halogen bonding distances are 2.5−3.3, 4.4−8.8, and 6.5−9.4% shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of nitrogen and halogen in complexes containing L3‑Cl, L3‑Br, and L3‑I ligands, respectively. Theoretical methods show that the halogen bonding energies within a range of −27.86 to −46.15 kJ·mol−1 are comparable to classical hydrogen bonding. The presence of a strong tendency to form halogen bonding synthons between adjacent halophenyl and pyrazine rings is one of the common features in the crystal structures of these complexes. Structural analysis of complexes studied here has clearly resulted in new sets of ligands that have been especially developed for selective and eﬃcient metal coordination. Designing ligands that can provide capabilities for selective metal ion coordination is one of the important factors in controlling the architecture of self-assembled species. In all complexes synthesized here, the pyrazine ring is coordinated to the mercury(II) ion through the N atom syn to the carbonyl. Accordingly, the second nitrogen of the pyrazine ring, the N atom anti to the carbonyl, is now available to serve as a halogen bond acceptor to interact with the halogen atom. Therefore, the second common feature of the crystal structures of complexes studied here is the selectivity of the metal ion coordination site. The similarity of the halogen bond synthon across these compounds and selectivity in the mercury(II) ion coordination site further point to their application in coordination crystal engineering especially in the clever design of such special metal species and the crystal structure prediction research ﬁeld. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General. All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich or Merck and used without further puriﬁcation. The synthesis and recrystallization of LH, L3‑F, L3‑Cl, L3‑Br, and L3‑I, and mercury(II) complexes 1−12 were carried out in air. The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded on a Bruker AC- 300 MHz spectrometer at ambient temperature in CD3OD. All chemical shifts are quoted in parts per million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane. Infrared spectra (4000−250 cm−1) of the solid sample were taken as 1% dispersion in CsI pellets using a BOMEM-MB102 spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed using a Heraeus CHN-O Rapid analyzer. Melting points were obtained by a Bamstead Electrothermal type 9200 melting point apparatus and corrected. All ligands were prepared according to the reported procedure.13 Single-Crystal Diﬀraction Studies. For crystals 1−9, 11, and 12, intensity data were collected using a Bruker SMART APEX-II CCD diﬀractometer, equipped with a ﬁne focus 1.75 kW sealed tube with Mo Kα radiation (λ, 0.71073 Å). The total number of images was based on the results from the program COSMO.25a Cell parameters were retrieved using APEX II software25b and reﬁned using SAINT on all observed reﬂections. Data reduction was performed using the SAINT software,25c which corrects for the Lorentz and polarizing eﬀects. Scaling and absorption corrections were applied using the SADABS25d multiscan technique, supplied by George Sheldrick. X-ray data for compound 10 were collected on a STOE IPDS-II diﬀractometer with graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ, 0.71073 Å). Data were collected in a series of ω scans in 1° oscillations and integrated using the Stöe X-AREA26a software package. A numerical absorption correction was applied using the X-RED26b and X-SHAPE26c software. All structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-9727 and reﬁned with full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXL-9727 program package. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were added at ideal positions and constrained to ride on their parent atoms, with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq. All reﬁnements were performed using the X-STEP32 crystallographic software package.28 Structural illustrations have been drawn with ORTEP-329 and MERCURY.30 Crystallographic data for compounds 1−12 are listed in Table 1. Selected bond distances and angles are summarized in Table 2. As expected, the highest peaks and deepest holes for these mercury complexes are slightly high, but the residual densities are close to heavy mercury atoms (with a maximum distance of 1.21 Å from Hg1 in complex 1). For compounds 5 and 11, which have high residual densities, the highest peaks and deepest holes are close to the Hg atoms with a distance of 0.86 and 0.79 Å for the highest peaks and 0.89 and 0.85 Å for deepest holes, respectively. Synthesis of N-(3-Halophenyl)pyrazine-2-carboxamide li- gands, LH, L3‑F, L3‑Cl, L3‑Br, and L3‑I. These ligands were prepared by using the previously reported method.13 Synthesis of [HgCl2(LH)]n, 1.

The mixture was heated at 40 °C for about 1 h and then ﬁltered. Upon slow evaporation of the ﬁltrate at room temperature, suitable yellow cystals of complex 1 for X-ray analysis were obtained after 5 days (yield 41%, mp = 153−155 °C). Anal.
