Framework 1 shows an interesting three-dimensional (8,8)-connected net with a Schläﬂi symbol of (33·418·55·62)2(36·414·57·6), while 2 exhibits an unusual (4,8)-connected sqc21 net with a Schläﬂi symbol of (32·42·52)(34·48·512·64). Luminescence studies of 1 reveal that the luminescence intensity increases when the framework is dehydrated. ■INTRODUCTION Hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis has been a promising technique in preparing hybrid materials with novel structures and special properties.1 However, unexpected results may occur because many factors have been found to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the products. Decarboxylation can occur under hydro(solvo)- thermal conditions,2 which can proceed via C−C bond cleavage.3 Although decarboxylation reactions will increase the diﬃculty of the syntheses of compounds with required structures, they generate some novel compounds containing interesting organic species that are diﬃcult to obtain by routine synthetic methods.4 There have been many reports that transition metals such as Cu(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II) ions play a unique catalytic role in decarboxylation reactions.2,5−14 Few reports describe decarboxylation reactions involving lanthanide ions.15,16 In such reactions, some multi- carboxylic acid ligands lost their partial carboxyl groups through cleavage of the C−C bond and release of CO2 molecules, and then the decarboxylation products coordinated metal ions.15 In other cases,16 oxalate can be obtained in decarboxylation through the process that includes the anionic ̇CO2 −radical formation and the subsequent radical coupling. Investigations of the products of decarboxylation and the factors that inﬂuence the decarboxylation of multicarboxylic acids are ongoing in our laboratory. We have found that high temperature and low pH are very eﬀective for decarboxylation in the presence of ds-block metal ions.2 Here, decarboxylation also occurs at high temperature and low pH in the presence of Tb(III) or Yb(III) ions. Thus, the study of decarboxylation factors can be supplemented and applied to some lanthanide ions such as Tb(III) and Yb(III) ions. Metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) containing lanthanide (Ln) ions are attractive because of their versatile coordination chemistry, unique luminescent17 and magnetic properties, and possible high framework stability. Guest-sensitive properties, such as the guest-dependent luminescence of lanthanide polymers, have become an interesting focus. However, to the best of our knowledge, few examples of the guest-dependent luminescent property of a lanthanide complex have been reported. In these studies, the luminescence of the complex decreases when the complex is dehydrated because the surrounding framework of the Tb3+ ion becomes soft.18 In the present work, the luminescence intensity increases with the removal of water molecules, and the framework does not collapse when it is dehydrated. This phenomenon may have a certain value for the research and application of guest sensing and recognition because it can produce a luminescent response to guest absorption and exchange.19 Received: November 12, 2013 Article pubs.acs.org/IC © XXXX American Chemical Society A dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic402803s | Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX Furthermore, the investigation of hydrogen-bonded water clusters or networks and the description of the morphology of water clusters with novel structure are also fascinating. It is exciting that large water clusters, novel water tapes, and water layers were recently observed and reported by our group.2,20−23 In this work, a novel two-dimensional (2D) water layer containing T8(4)10(4) water tape as the substructure can provide insight into the hydrogen-bonding motif and the understanding of the 2D structure of water. Herein, two new three-dimensional (3D) lanthanide coordination polymers from H4ptc and its decarboxylation products, {[Tb3(Hptc)(ptc)(pdc)(H2O)6]·2H2O}n (1) and {[Yb2(ptc)(ox)(H2O)5]·7H2O}n (2), have been successfully synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X- ray diﬀraction, element analysis, and IR, ﬂuorescence, and thermal analyses. In 1, Tb(III) ions are bridged by the carboxyl groups of the ligands, resulting in a three-dimensional (8,8)- connected net with a Schläﬂi symbol of (33·418·55·62)2(36·414· 57·6). In 2, the Yb(III) framework is bridged by the carboxyl groups of ptc4−and ox2−, forming an usual (4,8)-connected sqc21 net with a Schläﬂi symbol of (32·42·52)(34·48·512·64). ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials and Measurements.

Crystal Structure Determinations. Single-crystal X-ray diﬀrac- tion data of 1 and 2 were collected on a computer-controlled Rigaku Saturn CCD area detector diﬀractometer equipped with confocal monochromatized Mo Kα radiation with a radiation wavelength of 0.71073 Å using the ω−φ scan technique. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned with a full-matrix least-squares technique based on F2 using the SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 programs.24 Anisotropic thermal parameters were assigned to all non- hydrogen atoms. Crystallographic data and structural reﬁnement parameters are listed in Table 1. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Syntheses of 1 and 2. A hydrothermal reaction of Tb4O7 with H4ptc in water in the presence of HCl results in the formation of 1, while a reaction of Yb(NO3)3 with H4ptc in water leads to the formation of 2. In complex 1, pdc2−might form from the ptc4−through the cleavage of the C−C bond and the release of CO2 molecules, while in complex 2, oxalate may form from the coupling of two ̇CO2 −radicals released from ptc4−. The decarboxylation behavior has been clearly observed for some ligands similar to H4ptc, such as pyrazine-2,3,5,6- Table 1.

Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX B tetracarboxylic acid (H4pztc). In our previous work,2 a series of hydrothermal reactions of H4pztc were designed to explore the eﬀect of temperature and pH on the decarboxylation of H4pztc. The results showed that decarboxylation of H4pztc occurred more easily at high temperature and low pH. Because the two ligands have very similar structures, for example, both belong to the N-heterocyclic ligands containing four carboxyl groups, it was inferred that decarboxylation also occurred at high temperature and low pH in the presence of Tb(III) or Yb(III) ions because the reactions were carried out under the conditions of low pH (about 2−3) and high temperature (150 °C). Then complexes 1 and 2 have the distinct 3D open- framework architectures due to the presence of pdc2−and ox2−, respectively. Structural Analyses of {[Tb3(Hptc)(ptc)(pdc)(H2O)6]· 2H2O}n (1). Complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic system in the P21/c space group. Complex 1 is a very uncommon complex because it shows the following three characteristics: (1) the metal ions have three coordination modes, and Tb1 and Tb3 are coordinated by ﬁve multicarboxylate ligands to overcome the steric hindrance; (2) two crystallographically independent coordination modes (Hptc3−and ptc4−) of the ligand are shown, which are reported for the ﬁrst time; and (3) decarboxylation occurred during the synthesis under high temperature and low pH, and 3,5-bipyridine carboxylate (pdc2−) was obtained. Complex 1 is a 3D open MOF constructed via Hptc3−, ptc4−, pdc2−, and Tb(III) ions. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of three crystallographically independent Tb(III) atoms, one Hptc3−, one ptc4−, one pdc2−, six coordinated water molecules, and two uncoordinated water molecules, in which Tb1, Tb2, and Tb3 are all 8-coordinated and adopt square antiprismatic geometries. Especially, for Tb1 and Tb3, they are very rare examples for ﬁve multicarboxylate ligands coordinating to one metal center.25 The coordination environments of Tb1, Tb2, and Tb3 are shown in Figure 1. Each Tb1 ion coordinates with one tridentate Hptc3−(O6, O7, and N1) and three monodentate Hptc3−(O3, O4, and O1) together with one monodentate pdc2−(O9) and a coordinated water molecule (O21). Tb2 is coordinated by eight O atoms, three of which are from carboxylate groups of one ptc4−(O13) and two pdc2−(O10 and O12), and the other ﬁve are from water molecules. Each Tb3 ion also coordinates with ﬁve multicarboxylate ligands: one tridentate ptc4−(O14, N3, and O20), one bidentate ptc4−(O15 and O16), two monodentate ptc4−(O17 and O18), and one monodentate pdc2−(O11). The average Tb−Ocarboxylate, Tb−Owater, and Tb−N bond lengths are shown in Table 2. The average Tb−O and Tb−N bonds lengths for Tb1 and Tb3 are obviously shorter than those documented in the literature,26 which may be because the ﬁve multicarboxylate ligands coordinating with one metal center made the structures more compact. The formation of these coordination structures overcomes the steric hindrance. In complex 1, H4ptc has not been completely deprotonated, and it forms Hptc3−and ptc4−, two diﬀerent anions with two diﬀerent coordination modes (Figure 2), both of which are found for the ﬁrst time. Hptc3−coordinates four Tb1 ions with monodentate, bidentate, and tridentate modes (Figure 2, mode A), while ptc4−coodinates four Tb3 and one Tb2 with monodentate, bidentate, and tridentate modes (Figure 2, mode B). For pdc2−, it coordinates one Tb1, one Tb3, and two Tb2 ions with bidentate modes, and the N ion does not coordinate to any metal ion (Figure 2, mode C). Then, Tb1 ions are bridged by Hptc3−(Figure 2, mode A) to form a sort of layer structure in the bc plane (Figure 3). Each Hptc3−acts as bridging ligand and bridges four Tb1 ions: the head side of the ligand coordinates one Tb1 in a tridentate manner, and the tail side bridges three Tb1 centers in monodentate and bidentate manners. Each Tb1 ion is also coordinated by four Hptc3−from its four directions. Simultaneously, each Tb1 center is coordinated by one carboxylate O atom (O9) from pdc2−, which sticks oﬀthe layer structure so that the layer can further self-assemble into a 3D structure. Similarly, Tb3 ions are bridged by ptc4−(Figure 2, mode B) to form another sort of layer structure also in the bc plane (Figure 4). The layer has some similarities with the one previously discussed: ptc4−coordinates four Tb3 ions, and each Tb3 ion is connected by four ptc4−ligands. However, there are some diﬀerences: each ptc4−also coordinates one Tb2 ion, except four Tb3 ions, and Tb3 is also coordinated by one pdc2−, which makes the layer connect on the outside and form the 3D network. Furthermore, the Tb2 ion is coordinated by three carboxylate O atoms from ptc4−and pdc2−and ﬁve water molecules to form an inﬁnite asymmetric chain along the c axis (Figure 5). The other carboxylate O atoms from ptc4−and pdc2−coordinate Figure 1. Coordination environments of Tb1, Tb2, and Tb3 in 1, which are shown in purple, yellow, and green, respectively. H atoms are not shown for clarity. Table 2.

Two types of layer structures are connected by a chain structure to form 3D coordination networks (Figure 7). When viewed along the b or c axis, the two layer structures present themselves alternately, and the chain formed by Tb2, ptc4−, and pdc2−interspaces the two layers, which acts as the connector to help form the 3D network. It seems that Tb2 ions and pdc2− play an important role in the formation of the 3D network. Furthermore, the rich hydrogen-bonding network involving the water molecules, the carboxylate oxygen atoms, and the aromatic N atom of pdc2−inserts in the framework of complex, which makes the 3D structure more rigid and steady.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX D group. Complex 2 shows the following two characteristics: (1) decarboxylation occurs during the synthesis under high temperature and low pH, and oxalate is obtained from the coupling of two ̇CO2 −radicals, similar to the process that also occurred in other systems;16 (2) a novel water layer is observed in 2, which is novel in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).27 Complex 2 is a 3D open MOF constructed by Yb1, Yb2, ptc4−, and ox2−. The asymmetric unit of 2 consists of two crystallographically independent Yb(III) atoms, one ptc4−, one ox2−, ﬁve coordinated water molecules and six and three- quarters uncoordinated water molecules (Figure 8a). Yb1 is 9- coordinated with monocapped square antiprism coordination geometry, and Yb2 is 8-coordinated with distorted square antiprism coordination geometry. Yb1 ion is coordinated by one tridentate ptc4−(O1, N1, and O8), bidentate ptc4−(O5 and O6), and ox2−(O9 and O10), together with one monodentate ptc4−(O5a) and one coordinated water molecule (O11). Yb2 is coordinated by four coordinated water molecules (O14, O15, O16, and O17) and four carboxylate O atoms, of which two are from two ptc4−in monodentate mode (O3 and O4) and two are from one ox2−(O12 and O13) in bidentate chelating mode. The average Yb−Ocarboxylate, Yb−Owater, and Yb−N bond lengths are shown in Table 2. The Yb1−Ocarboxylate bond lengths are obviously longer than Yb2−Ocarboxylate bond lengths because of the existence of a longer Yb(1)−O(5) bond with a bond length of 2.890 Å and the increase in the coordination number. In complex 2, ptc4−adopts a diﬀerent coordination mode with 1 (Figure 8b), which is reported ﬁrst. H4ptc is completely deprotonated in complex 2, which coordinates to three Yb1 ions with a tridentate mode and two Yb2 with a bidentate mode. As shown in Figure 9, two Yb1 ions (Yb1 and Yb1a) are linked by O5 and O5′ atoms to form a binuclear unit, and every two units continue to be bridged by two ptc4−to form a double chain structure along the a axis. Then ox2−ligands act as connectors to link the double-chains and form an inﬁnite 2D structure in the ab layer. All Yb1 ions in the 2D structure are coplanar, and the four Yb1 ions link together to form a parallelogram building block with distances of 4.458 Å Figure 7. Two-layer structures connected by chain structures to form 3D coordination networks viewed along (left) the c axis and (right) the b axis in 1. Figure 8.

XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX E (between Yb1 and Yb1a) and 8.670 Å (between Yb1 and Yb1c). As shown in Figure 10, two Yb2 ions are connected to two ptc4−in a bidentate coordinating mode to form eight-numbered rings (Yb2, O3, O4, and C8 and their symmetric equivalents), which are further connected by ox2−to form a 1D chain along the b axis. The other three carboxylate groups of ptc4−ligands coordinate to Yb1 ions, which makes the chain connect with the above layer structure. Thus, the inﬁnite one-dimensional (1D) chain acts as the connector to connect the layer structure to form the 3D coordination network. When viewed along the a or b direction (Figure 11), the 3D network is seen to be formed by a 2D layer structure formed by Yb1 ions in the ab layer and an inﬁnite chain structure formed by Yb2 ions along the b axis. The simpliﬁed topological structures of 1 and 2 can be ﬁnished by the application of topology analysis via the freely available computer program TOPOS.28 As depicted in Figure 12, for 1, if the binuclear Tb1Tb2(pdc) clusters are viewed as 8- connected nodes and the Tb3(ptc) clusters are viewed as 8- connected nodes, then the structure can be described as a usual (8,8)-connected net with a Schläﬂi symbol of (33·418·55·62)2(36· 414·57·6). Topologically, for 2, if the binuclear Yb22(OX) clusters are considered as 4-connected nodes and Yb12(ptc) clusters are viewed as 8-connected nodes, then the structure can be simpliﬁed as a (4,8)-connected sqc21 net with a Schläﬂi symbol of (32·42·52)(34·48·512·64), which is rare for 3D MOFs. A novel 2D water layer is stabilized in the 3D network (Figure 13a). The 2D water layer is basically an assembly of T8(4)10(4)29 water tapes that are interconnected via O19··· O20 and O17···O20 hydrogen bonds (Figure 13b). The T8(4)10(4) water tape as the substructure of the water layer is described in detail (Figure S1a in Supporting Information). The water molecules form 8-membered and 10-membered cyclic rings, in which four water molecules (O24, O17, O14, and O15) are shared to form an extended tape along the a axis. On the two sides of the tape, every water molecule hydrogen- bonds to one water molecule, and the hydrogen-bonding motif of the water tape presented herein is multiplied. O16 and O15 act as acceptors or donors to form three and four hydrogen bonds, respectively. In O24 (Figure S1b in Supporting Information), an 8-centered (pentafurcate) hydrogen bond is formed. O24 acts as a donor to hydrogen-bond two water molecules (O11 and O15) and as an acceptor to be hydrogen- bonded by three water molecules (O16, O17, and O18). To the best of our knowledge, the formation of this type of hydrogen bond around one water molecule is very diﬃcult to form because of the steric hindrance.20,21 Furthermore, lattice water molecule O20 does not participate in this water tape; instead, it is inserted in the space between two tapes and acts as the connector to link two tapes into a 2D water layer through O19···O20 and O17···O20 hydrogen bonds Figure 10.

Thus, an inﬁnite water layer is formed through numerous O20 connections in the interspaces of a complex framework. Nonbonded O···O distances and O−H···O angles for the cluster are presented in Table 3. The O···O distances range from 2.707 to 3.470 Å, resulting in an average O···O distance of 2.949 Å. The O···O···O angles range from 126.69 to 170.89°, and the average O···O···O angle is 149.57°. We believe that this type of water cluster structure has not been described previously. TGA. TGA was carried out for 1 in the as-prepared phase in the temperature range of 30−700 °C (Figure S3A in Supporting Information). The ﬁrst weight loss from 70 to 110 °C is 3.30%, corresponding to the loss of two uncoordinated water molecules (calcd 2.79%). The second weight loss, 8.94%, occurred in the temperature range of 110− 150 °C due to the loss of six coordinated water molecules (calcd 8.38%). The third weight loss above 460 °C corresponds to the decomposition of the compound. Luminescence of the Complex upon Anhydrous and Enhydrous Phases. To investigate the eﬀect of the water molecules on the framework and the luminescence intensity, the luminescence measurements of samples containing diﬀerent water molecules were studied. Powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) and TGA were used to check the phases. The as- prepared sample (A) was heated at 130 °C for 1 h, leading to loss of two uncoordinated water molecules, as evidenced by TGA (Figure S3 in Supporting Information), where the weight loss of 9.1% up to 150 °C corresponds to the loss of six water molecules (calcd 8.62%). Thus, a sample loss of two water molecules (B) was obtained. The as-prepared sample (A) was heated at 250 °C for 7 h, leading to a loss of eight water molecules and yielding sample C, which was also checked by TGA. The luminescent property of 1 upon anhydrous and enhydrous phases is shown in Figure 14. For A, the excitation wavelength for the emission spectra is 340 nm. The excitation slit and the emission slit are 10 and 5 nm, respectively. The ﬂuorescent emission consists of four main peaks at 495 (5D4 → 7F6), 549 (5D4 →7F5), 586 (5D4 →7F4), and 622 nm (5D4 → 7F3). The emission band at 549 nm (5D4 →7F5) is obviously stronger than the others. The ﬂuorescent spectra show the characteristic peaks of the terbium complex.30 However, for the partly or completely dehydrated samples (B and C), luminescence intensity increases so signiﬁcantly that the Figure 13.

Emission spectra of 1 in its dehydrated and enhydrous phases: A, the sample as-prepared; B, the sample after the loss of two uncoordinated water molecules; C, the sample after the loss of eight water molecules; and D, the sample soaked in water for 24 h. Inorganic Chemistry Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic402803s | Inorg. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX G peaks overrun the measurement area. To compare the luminescence intensity more equitably for A−D, we chose the same instrumental conditions, an excitation wavelength of 360 nm, and both excitation and emission slits of 5 nm. It is interesting to observe the large intensity increase in luminescence upon dehydration of the sample. For B, the luminescence intensity is more than 5 times stronger than that of A on the strongest emission of the 5D4 →7F5 transition at 549 nm. When B continued to lose residual water molecules (C), the luminescence intensity continues to increase, while the peaks do not move. So, it is found that a decrease in the number of water molecules in samples is accompanied by an increase in luminescence intensity, which is accordant with terbium sulfate hydrate reported by Mamykin et al.,31 but it is diﬀerent from the Tb3+ complex reported by Gao et al.18 in which a decrease of luminescence when it is dehydrated might relate to the amorphous feature of the dehydrated phases, where the surrounding of Tb3+ ion becomes soft. In this work, the loss of two uncoordinated water molecules does not change the framework of the complex, so its perfect crystallinity can be preserved, as indicated by comparing their PXRD patterns to the as-prepared ones (Figure 15). Furthermore, the decrease in the number of waters may reduce energy consumption caused by O−H vibrations in water molecules, which results in an increase in luminescence intensity. For C, the dehydrated phases showed X-ray scattering ability and obvious PXRD peaks, which indicated that the framework did not collapse, although some degradation might occur, and its luminescence intensity is stronger than that of B. Therefore, water molecules in fact weaken the luminescence but do not increase it when the framework has not collapsed. When C was soaked in water for 24 h, sample D was obtained, the water molecules were not recovered, and its TGA and PXRD patterns, as well as its luminescence intensity, were similar to those of the dehydrated samples C. Thus, the dehydrated and rehydrated processes were not basically reversible for complex 1. ■CONCLUSION In summary, we have demonstrated two 3D lanthanide coordination polymers of Tb(III) and Yb(III) obtained by the hydrothermal method of in situ decarboxylation. The decarboxylation products are pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate and oxalate in 1 and 2, respectively, which participate in coordination and play an important role in the formation of the 3D networks. The decarboxylation occurred under high temperature and low pH. For complex 1, the luminescence intensity increases when the water molecules are driven oﬀ, and when the dehydrated sample is soaked in water, the water molecules cannot be recovered. The signiﬁcant luminescence changes with diﬀerent numbers of waters render the material potentially applicable for sensing water. For complex 2, the novel 2D water layer containing T8(4)10(4) water tape as the substructure may provide insight into the hydrogen-bonding motif and enhance our understanding of the 2D structural aspects of water. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Water tape substructure for 2, TG curves for 1, and crystallographic data for 1 and 2 (cif).
