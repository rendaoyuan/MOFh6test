Chem. 2011, 50, 1392–1401 DOI: 10.1021/ic102057p Structure and Gas Sorption Behavior of a New Three Dimensional Porous Magnesium Formate Arijit Mallick, Subhadeep Saha, Pradip Pachfule, Sudip Roy, and Rahul Banerjee* Physical/Materials Chemistry Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Dr. Homi Bhabha Road, Pune-411008, India Received October 12, 2010 A new three-dimensional magnesium formate polymorph, namely, γ-[Mg3(O2CH)6] has been synthesized via in situ formate anion generation method. γ-Mg-formate crystallizes in space group Pbcn, and structural determination by X-ray single crystal diffraction reveals a three-dimensional network of Mg2þ linked by formate anions. All formate anions possess similar binding mode to the metal center with one oxygen of a particular formate anion binds to one metal center (μ1 oxygen) and other oxygen binds to two metal centers (μ2 oxygen). N2 adsorption studies indicate that the framework displays permanent porosity. The specific surface area of γ-Mg-formate (BET, 120 m2 gm-1) is lower than the R- polymorph (BET, 150 m2 gm-1). However, the initial hydrogen uptake of γ-Mg-formate reached almost 1.0 wt % when the adsorbate pressure approached 760 Torr at 77 K. This is higher than the hydrogen uptake of R-Mg- formate (0.6 wt %). γ-Mg-formate, shows a moderate affinity and capacity for CO2 (3.4 A˚ kinetic diameter) at 298 K. The CO2 uptake at 760 Torr is 2.01 mmol gm-1(47.0 cc gm-1). Although this CO2 uptake is somewhat modest, it compares well with the CO2 uptake of several Mg-MOFs and ZIFs reported in the literature. Introduction Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)1 represent a new class of network solids that have great potential in applica- tions like separation,2 storage3 and controlled drug delivery.4 Recently, the researchonporous metal formates, a sub family of MOFs, has emerged as one of the most active areas of research because of their potential applications as adsor- bents,5 heterogeneous catalysis6 and in multiferroics.7 Although molecular formates are well-known in literature,8 but a challenging target in this field is the design and synthesis of extra-large microporous formate frameworks so that catal- ysis and separation can be performed on large molecules. To achieve high porosity with large pore openings, several *To whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail: r.banerjee@ ncl.res.in. Fax: þ 91-20-25902636. Phone: þ 91-20-25902535.

In particular, a number of porous formates have been synthe- sized in the presence of organic amines as structure-directing agents (SDA).9 The use of organic amines, a well-known SDA for zeolite synthesis,10 is currently receiving great attention because change in the SDA may result three- dimensional (3D) porous metal-formates with different architecture and diverse porosity. Although MOFs containing transition metals (e.g., cobalt, nickel, zinc, and copper) have been widely investigated,11 the coordination chemistry of MOFs based on main-group metals, in particular, light main group metals (like Mg2þ or Ca2þ) are very rare.12 Divalent magnesium has a number of similarities to the transition metal ions asit prefers octahedral coordination, has a comparable ionic radius (72 pm for Mg2þ compared to 74 pm for Zn2þ and 73 pm for Cu2þ) and similar hydration energy. However, only a handful of magnesium containing MOFs are reported, as magnesium carboxylates rarely form extended 3D structures because Mg2þ has a high affinity for oxygen donor atoms of water and other polar solvents.13 Recent research on Mg-based MOFs showed that some Mg-MOF has the capability to store significant amount of carbon dioxide (8.08 mmol/g at 298 K) and hydrogen (1.96 wt % at 77 K).14 However, often it has been found that the competitive coordination by water or other solvents with the polyfunctional ligands used for the synthesis of Mg-MOFs, makes it more challenging to get a 3D Mg-MOF with high porosity. We report here synthesis and structural studies of new 3D magnesium formate polymorph, namely, γ-[Mg3(O2CH)6] synthesized via in situ formate anion generation method and adding 1,3-benzene-ditetrazole as SDA.15 The crystal struc- ture of this new γ- polymorph of magnesium formate is com- pletely different from other reported magnesium formates (R and β polymorph).16 The occurrence of polymorphism17 is likely for a particular compound that can be synthesized or crystallized under different experimental conditions. The structure of γ-[Mg3(O2CH)6] has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and further identified by IR spectroscopy (FTIR) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). We measured the thermal stability of these γ-[Mg3(O2CH)6] by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and its ability to (4) (a) Dupuis, A.; Guo, N.; Gao, Y.; Godbout, N.; Lacroix, S.; Dubois, C.; Skorobogatiy, M.

In addition, in situ variable temperature PXRD has been carried out on R and γ magnesium formate to analyze their stability and crystallinity at high temperature and dehydration-rehydration cycle. We have used Grand Canoni- cal Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation18 to predict the initial positions of the hydrogen molecules in the framework and Density Functional Theory (DFT) method to optimize the positions of the each hydrogen molecules in the framework and their related adsorption energies. Experimental Section General Procedures. All reagents and solvents for synthesis and analysis were commercially available and used as received. The Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra (KBr pellet) were taken on Perkin Elmer FT-IR Spectrum (Nicolet) spectrometer. PXRD patterns were recorded on a Phillips PANalytical dif- fractometer for Cu KR1 radiation (λ=1.5406 A˚ ), with a scan speed of 2 min-1 and a step size of 0.02 in 2θ. Thermo- gravimetric experiments (TGA) were carried out in the tem- perature range of 25-800 C on a SDT Q600 TG-DTA analyzer under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 C min-1. All low pressure gas adsorption experiments (up to 760 Torr) were performed on a Quantachrome Quadrasorb automatic volu- metric instrument. Synthesis of γ-Mg-formate Mg3(O2CH)6⊃[NH(CH3)2]0.5. As 1,3-benzene-ditetrazole is sparingly soluble in water at mode- rate temperature, we used the solvent DMF in which it is readily soluble. We used the solvothermal condition (Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 125 to 150 C) for synthesis which results in the formation of single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction. Before solvothermal reactions, stirring of the hetero- geneous solutions for a period 30 min was helpful for the high purity of the product.

Single crystal data of γ-Mg-formate was collected on a Bruker SMART APEX three circle diffracto- meter equipped with a CCD area detector (Bruker Systems Inc., 1999a) and operated at 1500 W power (50 kV, 30 mA) to generate Mo KR radiation (λ=0.71073 A˚ ). The incident X-ray beam was focused and monochromated using Bruker Excalibur Gobel mirror optics. Crystal of the γ-Mg-formate reported in the paper was mounted on nylon CryoLoops (Hampton Research) with Paratone-N (Hampton Research). Data was inte- grated using Bruker SAINT software.19 Data was subsequently corrected for absorption by the program SADABS.20 Space group determinations and tests for merohedral twinning were carried out using XPREP.21 Here, the highest possible space group was chosen. This structure was solved by direct methods and refined using the SHELXTL 97 software suite.22 Atoms were located from iterative examination of difference F-maps following least-squares refinements of the earlier models.23 Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and included as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters 1.2-1.5 times Ueq of the attached C atoms. Data was collected at 293(2) K for the γ-Mg-formate reported in this paper. The stru- cture was examined using the Addsym subroutine of PLATON24 to ensure that no additional symmetry could be applied to the models. All ellipsoids in ORTEP diagrams are displayed at the 50% probability level unless noted otherwise. The Supporting Information contains a detailed data collection strategy and crystallographic data for the γ-Mg-formate reported in this paper.

N2, H2, and CO2 Adsorption Measurements. Hydrogen adsorption-desorption experiments were conducted at 77 K using Quantachrome Quadrasorb automatic volumetric instrument. Ultrapure H2 (99.95%) was purified further by using calcium aluminosilicate adsorbents to remove trace amounts of water and other impurities before introduction into the system. For measurements at 77 K, a standard low-temperature liquid nitro- gen Dewar vessel was used. CO2 adsorption-desorption mea- surements were done at room temperature (298 K). Before gas adsorption measurements, the sample was activated at room temperature (for 24 h) and 120 C (for 6 h) under ultrahigh vacuum (10-8 mbar) overnight. About 75 mg of samples were loaded for gas adsorption, and the weight of each sample was recorded before and after outgassing to confirm complete removal of all guest molecules. Computational Procedures Initial Structure Generation. Selection of initial positions of hydrogen molecules in the framework is the most important step for calculating the probable binding sites and the corresponding binding energy. Proper scanning of pore surface is important to get the adsorption site with the lowest binding energy. It is difficult to create homogeneously distributed initial positions of hydrogen molecules in the framework due to the 3D structure of the MOF. Even if we find homogeneously distributed positions, executing calculations for all the initial structures leads to large number of optimization calculations. Therefore, we choose the initial structure from the output of our classical grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation, which we have performed for calculat- ing adsorption isotherms. The conventional GCMC simulation technique is used to compute adsorption isotherms. The input for the simulation consists of models (structures) for the adsorbent andthe adsorbate as well as force fields which describe the interactions between them. MOFs are crystalline therefore the model for the adsorbent in the atomistic representation of the framework is taken from its crystallographic coordinates. Here, for γ-Mg-formate we have (17) (a) Desiraju, G. R. Organic Solid State Chemistry; Elsevier: Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 1987. (b) Desiraju, G. R.

Article Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 50, No. 4, 2011 1395 used the original crystal structure ignoring the solvent molecule residing in the pore. In all the simulations, the framework is treated as rigid (a valid assumption for many MOFs at low temperature), although models for flexible MOFs have been proposed recently.25 We have calculated the theoretical hydro- gen adsorption isotherm for γ-Mg-formate and R-Mg-formate formate. To avoid boundary or finite size effects and to allow simulations that are valid for the extended crystal lattice, peri- odic boundary conditions has been used,18 resulting in simula- tions that take place in an infinite, perfect structure. To model adsorbate/adsorbate and adsorbate/framework interactions, van der Waals interactions (normally modeled by Lennard- Jones potentials) have been taken into account. Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters for the individual atoms and for H2 molecule UFF26 potential parameters has been considered. LJ potential parameters for cross interactions were computed from Lorentz- Berthelot combining rules. The cutoff radii for both the MOFs were set to be 4.8 A˚ . For GCMC calculations the volume (V), the temperature (T), and the chemical potential (μ) are kept fixed, and under these conditions, the average number of H2 molecules adsorbed is computed. Each step in the Monte Carlo routine consisted of the insertion of a new molecule, deletion of an existing molecule, or translation of an existing molecule. A total of 5 million steps were used, the first half for equilibra- tion and the second half to calculate the ensemble averages. A configuration is defined as an attempted translation, rotation, creation, or deletion of a H2 molecule. The probability of attempt- ing creation or deletion of a molecule was set to 0.3; an equation of state for hydrogen27 was used to obtain the relationship between the bulk pressure and fugacity. We have converted the total adsorption obtained from simulation to excess adsorp- tion to compare with the experiments. The details of the con- version calculations can be found in the literature. Along with the adsorption isotherm, the positions (coordinates) of the adsorbed hydrogen molecules in the pores of both of R and γ-Mg-formate were obtained. Finite structures (shown in Sup- porting Information, Figure S8) of the frameworks have been generated with different positions of hydrogen molecules. These initial structures were further optimized by ab initio quantum chemical calculations. Calculation of Adsorption Energy and Site. Finite structure obtained from the periodic structure possesses artificial dan- gling bonds. We have saturated those bonds with H atoms. For geometry optimization, the Gaussian 09 software suite28 has been used. The ModRedundant option has been employed to perform the selective optimization of H atoms which have been attached to the clusters to saturate the dangling bonds at the B3LYP29/6-31G level of theory to get the energy, E(BAREMOF) of the finite structure. A hydrogen molecule on the finite structure was inserted at the same positions that we obtained from GCMC simulation. Then we have optimized the positions of hydrogen molecules of each initial structure containing finite formate clusters (R-formate and γ-formate both) and one hydrogen molecule using DFT with a 6-31G basis set. The energies we calculated from these calculations are for adsorbate- adsorbent complex, E(BAREMOFþH2). We have determined the binding energy of hydrogen using the following equation, where E(H2) is the energy of H2 molecule obtained from DFT calcula- tion with the same basis set. Eads ¼ EðBAREMOF þ H2Þ - ðEðBAREMOFÞ þ EðH2ÞÞ Adsorption energies after optimization of all initial configura- tions for each type of MOFs were compared. The lowest adsorption energies refer to the positions of the hydrogen molecules in the pores and reported in the paper. Results and Discussion Synthesis. In most of the literature on Mg-formates, Mg2þ centers are surrounded by formate groups as well as coordinated water molecules.30 Till this date, there are only three anhydrous Mg-formates reported in the litera- ture where Mg2þ centers are coordinated only with for- mate anions. Powell and co-worker16a first reported the solvothermal synthesis of two unsolvated Mg- formates (R form and β form) of which only the non-porous β-[Mg(O2CH)2] form was structurally determined. Later Rood et al. reported the structural characterization and gas adsorption study of R-Mg-formate [Mg3(O2CH)6⊃ HCO2H].16b Recently there has been a report of a third anhydrous phase Mg(HCOO)2(HCOOH)⊃(CH3)2NH.31 Formic acid had been the source of formate anion in all these three cases. Mg(NO3)2 3 6H2O was the source of metal for the R and β form, whereas anhydrous Mg(HCOO)2(HCOOH)⊃(CH3)2NH could be prepared from Mg(NO3)2 3 6H2O, Mg(CO2CH3)2 3 4H2O, and Mg(ClO4)23 6H2O. We introduced a different synthetic route of generating formate anion in situ by addition of nitric acid (HNO3) into the reaction media that contains N,N0- dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent.32 We antici- pated that reaction between nitric acid and DMF at high temperature and pressure inside a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave may create formate anion, which upon reaction with Mg2þ might result into Mg-formate. All our attempts to synthesize a new Mg-formate polymorph resulted into the production of mixtures of γ-Mg-formate (major product) and previously reported anhydrous Mg(HCOO)2(HCOOH)⊃(CH3)2NH (minor product). Our attempt of using diverse structure directing agents (like tetra-butyl ammonium salts) to synthesize phase pure (25) Salles, F.; Ghoufi, A.; Maurin, G.; Bell, R.; Mellot-Draznieks, C.; Ferey, G.

However, after several attempts we discovered that solvothermal reaction (in Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 125 to 150 C) of Mg(CO2CH3)2 3 4H2O with nitric acid (HNO3) in a DMF solution in the presence of 1,3-benzene-ditetrazole in 3:2:1 mol ratio for 72 h afforded a colorless homogeneous microcrystalline γ-Mg-formate as phase pure form with a dodecahedron morphology. So far we are unable to understand the role of 1,3-benzene-ditetrazole during the synthesis and crystal- lization of γ-Mg-formate as we are unable to find its existence in the resulting crystal structure. We anticipate that it might be acting as a structure directing agent. The as-synthesized compound is stable in most organic sol- vents and was characterized and formulated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies as Mg3(O2CH)6⊃ [NH(CH3)2]0.5. The same result was obtained when we used either Mg(ClO4)2 3 6H2O or Mg(NO3)2 3 6H2O, with no significant differences for phase purity (less than 50% yield), as confirmed by the PXRD patterns (see Support- ing Information, Figure S1). Crystal Structure of γ-Mg-formate Mg3(O2CH)6⊃- [NH(CH3)2]0.5. The γ-Mg-formate crystallizes in space group Pbcn, and structural determination by X-ray single crystal diffraction reveals a 3D network of Mg2þ linked by formate anions. The asymmetric unit of Mg-formate consists of four crystallographically independent Mg2þ ions, each of which is octahedrally coordinated by six different formate anions. All formate anions posses a similar binding mode to the metal center with one oxygen of a particular formate anion binding to one metal center (μ1 oxygen) and the other oxygen binding to two metal centers (μ2 oxygen). So each formate anion binds with three Mg2þ and each Mg2þ binds with six formate anions, and hence the chemical formula could be derived as Mg3(O2CH)6 with 1:2 Mg2þ and ligand ratio (Figure 1). This η2 μ3 type binding motif is also seen in R- and β-Mg- formates. γ Mg-formate has interesting structural simi- larity with its R- polymorph as it contains similar coordi- nation environments for the metal centers. Mg(1) center is connected with the six μ2 oxygen, Mg(2) center is con- nected with four μ2 oxygen and two μ1 oxygen, whereas Mg(3) and Mg(4) centers are connected with four μ1 oxygen and two μ2 oxygen. Although Mg(3) and Mg(4) centers have similar connectivity but they have different coordination environments. The Mg(3) is connected to Mg(1) through two formate bridges and one μ2 oxygen (O7), and here the bridging dihedral angles (τ)33 are 21.29 (Mg3-O11-O8-Mg1) and 27.00 (Mg3-O1- O5-Mg1) (Figure 1c). Mg(4) is also connected with Figure 1. Local geometries surrounding the four independent, octahedrally coordinated magnesium centers within γ-Mg-formate. Color code: O (red), C (gray), Mg (green).

The Mg-O(μ1) bond distance ranges from 2.012(2) to 2.053(3) A˚, and the Mg-O(μ2) bond distance ranges from 2.063(2) A˚ to 2.132(2) A˚ (Figure 1d). Mg(1) and Mg(2) are linked through edge-shared MgO6 octahedra and form a one-dimensional (1D) chain along the crystallographic a-axis. These chains are connected to each other through vertex-sharing octahedra of Mg(3) and Mg(4), and thus it forms a 3D network. The network contains 1D channels along the crystallographic a-axis. Here the channels are filled by the disordered dimethylamine molecules. The void space was calculated using PLATON,24 suggesting 5.1% void volume to the total crystal volume; however, this would be increased to 24.7% after removal of the disordered solvent molecules. The pore diameter of the channel is 3.6 A˚ (the channel size is measured by con- sidering the van der Walls radii of the constituting atoms). As mentioned previously there are three other an- hydrous Mg-formates (R-Mg-formate, β-Mg-formate, Mg(HCOO)3⊃(CH3)2NH) reported in literature. In case of R, β and γ-Mg-formate (reported in this paper), μ1 and μ2oxygenarebindingwithMg2þ centers(Figure2).Whereas anhydrous Mg(HCOO)2(HCOOH)⊃(CH3)2NH has only μ1 oxygen binding metal centers. The R-Mg-formate crystallizes in monoclinic space group (P21/n), and β,γ- Mg-formate crystallizes in orthorhombic space group (Pca21 and Pbcn). All the Mg-formates contain octa- hedral Mg2þ centers. In case of R-Mg-formate and γ-Mg- formate, the edge share MgO6 octahedra form a 1D chain, and the chains are also connected through vertex share octahedra to form 3D frame works. Whereas, in the β-Mg-formate the 1D chains, formed by edge share octa- hedra, are connected through formate anions (HCO2 -) and not through vertex share octahedra. In R-Mg-for- mate Mg(3) and Mg(4) are in transoid orientation with respect to the planes formed by Mg(1)-Mg(2)-Mg(1) (Figure3b) andMg(1)-Mg(4)-Mg(1) (Figure3c);whereas in γ-Mg-formate those Mg atoms are arranged in cisoid orientation (Figure 3e and Figure 3f). As a result, the edge shared MgO6 octahedra in R-Mg-formate are arranged parallel (Figure 3a) while in γ-Mg-formate they are arranged in an orthogonal manner (Figure 3d). The μ1 and μ2 Mg-O bond distances in all three R, β and γ-Mg- formate range from 2.01 A˚ to 2.05 A˚ and 2.06 A˚ to 2.13 A˚ respectively. Thermal Stability and PXRD Analysis. We have synthe- sized R- and γ-Mg-formates in bulk for in situ variable temperature PXRD analysis. To confirm the phase purity of the bulk materials, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were carried out on those compounds. The PXRD of experimental and computer-simulated pattern of γ-Mg-formate is shown in the Figure 4a. All major peaks of the experimental powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns match quite well that of simulated XRPD, indicating their reasonable crystalline phase purity. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) performed on as-synthesized γ-Mg-formate revealed this compound’s high thermal stability (see Section S3 in the Supporting Information for all data regarding guest mobility and thermal stability of γ-Mg-formate). The TGA trace for γ-Mg-formate showed a gradual weight-loss step of 27% (108-155 C), corresponding to the escape of all solvent molecules trapped in the pores [2(CH3)2NH; calcd 27 %] followed by a plateau (155-370 C) indicating its high thermal stability in the absence of guest molecules (Figure 4b). We note that the dimethylamine molecules in Mg-formate were released without damaging the fra- meworks, as evidenced by the coincidence of the PXRD patterns of the γ-Mg-formate powder sample heated to and held at 120 C, in N2 atmosphere with the PXRD patterns simulated from single crystal structures. Such high thermal and architectural stability of γ-Mg-formate was also verified from its in situ VT-PXRD patterns at different temperature which coincide with the patterns simulated from single crystal structures. In situ VT- PXRD of R-Mg-formate (Figure 4c) and γ-Mg-formate (Figure 4d) indicate the retention of crystallinity of these samples at high temperature. It also reveals that there are no possibilities of phase changes at higher tempera- ture for these samples. We were unable to perform a VT-PXRD experiment on β-Mg-formate as all our attempts to synthesize it in phase pure bulk failed result- ing in the production of a mixture of β-Mg-formate and anhydrous Mg(HCOO)2(HCOOH)⊃(CH3)2NH.

We focused to examine the porosity of γ-Mg-formate and prepared it at the gram scale to allow detailed investigation of the aforemen- tioned property. An important structural feature of this γ-Mg-formate is that they possess pores (3.6 A˚ in diameter) (Figure 5a). Recently researchers envisaged that MOFs containing open Mg metal sites (Mg-MOF-74) rivals competitive materials in CO2 capture, with 8.9 wt % dynamic capacity, and undergoes facile CO2 release at 80 C.14 The dimethylamine molecules inside the pore in Figure 3.

Article Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 50, No. 4, 2011 1399 as-synthesized γ-Mg-formate could be more readily removed by solvent-exchange. The thermogravimetric behavior of γ-Mg-formate was significantly simplified after they were immersed in organic solvents, such as chloroform. To remove the guest species from the frame- works and prepare the evacuated forms of γ-Mg-formate for gas-adsorption analysis, the as-synthesized γ-Mg- formate samples were immersed in chloroform at ambient temperature for 48 h, and evacuated at ambient tempera- ture for 24 h, then at an elevated temperature (120 C) for 6 h. The MOF sample thus obtained was optimally evac- uated, as evident from the long plateau (108-370 C) in the TGA traces. The architectural rigidity and consequently the perma- nent porosity of evacuated γ-Mg-formate were unequivo- cally proven by gas-adsorption analysis. The nitrogen (N2), hydrogen (H2), and carbon-dioxide (CO2) gas- adsorption experiments were carried out on γ-Mg-for- mate (Figure 5). These isotherms exhibit typical physi- sorption behavior, with a steep initial increase at low pressures and saturation at higher pressures. γ-Mg-for- mate adsorbs less nitrogen (38 cc gm-1) than the R-Mg- formate (88 cc gm-1) reported by Rood et al.16b As a result the specific surface area of γ-Mg-formate (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), 120 m2 gm-1) is low- er than the R- polymorph (BET, 150 m2 gm-1). However, initial hydrogen uptake of γ-Mg-formate reached almost 1.0 wt % when the adsorbate pressure approached 760 Torr at 77 K (Figure 5b). This is higher than the hydrogen uptake of R-Mg-formate (0.6 wt %) reported by Rood et al.16b under similar conditions. It is noteworthy that low pressure hydrogen uptake of newly found γ-Mg-formate compares well with the reported hydrogen uptake of R-Mg-formate at pressure higher than 760 Torr.16b The maximum excess hydrogen uptake of the R-Mg-formate at 77 K is about 1.1 wt % with no hysteresis between adsorption and desorption. Although this H2 adsorption is somewhat moderate, they compare well with the value of 0.7 wt % obtained for the highest capacity zeolite ZSM-5 and some of Mg-MOFs reported in the litera- ture.34 Recently researchers have shown that MOFs can hold large amounts of carbon dioxide and have demon- strated that MOFs can capture CO2 selectively from CO and CH4. Figure 6b shows the CO2 adsorption isotherms for γ-Mg-formate, which shows a moderate affinity and capacity for CO2 (3.4 A˚ kinetic diameter) at 298 K. The CO2 uptake of γ-Mg-formate at 298 K (2.01 mmol gm-1) (Figure 5c) is higher than the R-polymorph (1.69 mmol gm-1). Although this CO2 uptake is somewhat modest, but it compares well with the CO2 uptake of several Mg-MOFs and ZIFs reported in the literature (see Table S2 and S3 in Supporting Information, for a detailed list of MOFs and Mg-MOFs with high CO2 uptake). Quantum Chemical Calculations. Portion of the 111 supercell of both R and γ-Mg-formate, which have been used for all ab initio quantum chemical calculation as cluster model (Supporting Information, Figure S8). It is clearly visible from the crystal structure of these two R and γ-Mg-formate (Figure 3) that there are highly elec- tronegative oxygen atoms (from formate ligand), which are exposed to the pore surface. These particular surface areas have been scanned for adsorption energies and adsorption sites. We have calculated adsorption energies for each position for each hydrogen and compared the lowest energy positions at each surface sites. The adsorp- tion energies we get are the local energy minima from every complete optimization cycle. Comparison of the adsorption energies often suggested similar adsorption energies and sites due to the choice of initial position of hydrogen molecules. The corresponding position of the hydrogen molecule with lowest adsorption energy can be obtained from the coordinate of the optimized geometry, which is depicted in Figure 6. It is clearly visible from Figure 6 that the hydrogen molecules are oriented toward Figure 5. (a) Space fill model of γ-Mg-formate showing the 1D channels. Gas adsorption isotherms of γ-Mg-formate.

This shows that oxygen atoms have pronounced affinity to bind to the free hydro- gen molecules. The lowest energy adsorption sites of hydrogen molecules with respect to the oxygen atoms of formate anion are represented in Figure 6. The cluster for quantum chemical calculations was extracted from the supercells of these two formates. Therefore some oxygen carbon bonds were cleaved and hydrogen atoms satu- rated the dangling bonds. So the chemistry of those oxy- gen atoms changed, and we had two types of oxygen atoms in the cluster; the first one is the original formate oxygen from the supercell, and the second one is hydroxyl oxygen which we have generated while making the cluster (Figure 6a and 6b). We have found from this quantum chemical calculation that hydroxyl oxygen (binding energy is ∼-5.9 KJ/mol for R-formate and ∼-5.5 KJ/mol for γ-formate) has a higher affinity to attract hydrogen than the formate oxygen (∼-2.6 KJ/mol for both of them). But it is also evident that if we do not replace the formate oxygen with hydroxyl oxygen, a hydrogen molecule would interact with formate oxygen but with lesser interaction energy than that of hydroxyl oxygen. Figures 6c and 6d shows the comparison between experimental and simulated single component H2 adsorp- tion isotherms of R-Mg-formate and γ-Mg-formate at the low pressure region. The excess amount adsorbed, Nex, is defined as Nex = Ntotal - FV, where F is the density of the bulk gas phase and V is the pore volume (calculated from the X-ray crystallographic structure). The data for the H2 adsorption isotherm in R-Mg-formate has been taken from the literature.16a Calculated adsorption isotherms for pure H2 are obtained by GCMC simulations. The GCMC simulations predict the measured and available experimental results with acceptable accuracy. The cal- culated loading of hydrogen in R-Mg-formate is 54.38 cc/g, and in the case of γ-Mg-formate the value is 155.34 cc/g at 760 Torr. pressure. The difference between experimental and simulated isotherms can be attributed to the contrac- tion of pores after removal of the solvent.35 These pore contractions of the γ-Mg-formate giving rise to lesser amount of loading with respect to the theoretically pre- dicted isotherm which has been calculated from the original crystal structure (ignoring the solvent molecules). In addition, the empirical force fields used may not be accurate enough to describe such discrepancy, particu- larly in case of R-Mg-formate. Conclusion A new 3D magnesium formate polymorph, namely, γ-[Mg3(O2CH)6] has been synthesized via an in situ formate anion generation method and structurally characterized. Figure 6.

(35) The difference in the simulated and experimental adsorption iso- therms could be due to poor activation as mentioned in the paper. However we cannot over rule the possibility of over estimation while calculating the simulated adsorption isotherm. Article Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 50, No. 4, 2011 1401 Crystal structure of this new γ polymorph of magnesium formate is completely different from other reported magne- sium formates (R and β polymorph). The γ-Mg-formate has 1D channels along the a-axis, and shows reversible hydrogen (∼1.0 wt % at 77 K, 760 Torr) and CO2 uptake (2.1 mmol gm-1 at 298 K, 760 Torr). Quantum chemical calculation predicted the adsorption energies, which is in the range of physisorption and explains the low intake of hydrogen gas in this system. γ-Mg-formate outperforms the R and β poly- morph with respect to CO2 and H2 uptake. This work may provide a potential way of using the in situ formate anion generation method for the design and synthesis of new MOFs. We, on the basis of the present work, are planning to investigate the possibility of preparing a series of metal formates to produce functionalized, porous, and lightweight framework materials.

N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was purchased from Rankem chemicals. All starting materials were used without further purification. All experimental operations were performed in air. Synthesis of γ-Mg-formate Mg3(O2CH)6⊃[NH(CH3)2]0.5 : As 1,3-benzeneditetrazole is sparingly soluble in water at moderate temperature. So we used the solvent DMF in which it is readily soluble. So we used the solvothermal condition (teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 125 to 150 °C) for synthesis which results into the formation of single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction. Before solvothermal reactions, stirring of the heterogeneous solutions for a period of 30 minutes was helpful for the high purity of the product. Solvothermal reaction of Mg(CO2CH3)2•4H2O (0.214 g, 1 mmol) with 1,3- benzeneditetrazole (0.214 g, 1 mmol) in a 25 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave in 5 ml DMF and 0.2 ml HNO3 (3.6 M) mixture at 150 °C for 60 h produces colorless crystals of Mg3(O2CH)6⊃[NH(CH3)2]0.5 in 61% yield. Crystals were collected by filtration and dried in air (10 min). [Yield: 61%, 0.130 gm depending on Mg(CO2CH3)2•4H2O].

Single crystal X-ray diffraction data collection, structure solution and refinement procedures. General Data Collection and Refinement Procedures: The single crystal data was collected on a Bruker SMART APEX three circle diffractometer equipped with a CCD area detector and operated at 1500 W power (50 kV, 30 mA) to generate Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073 Å). The incident X-ray beam was focused and monochromated using Bruker Excalibur Gobel mirror optics. Crystal of the γ-Mg-formate reported in the paper was mounted on nylon CryoLoops (Hampton Research) with Paraton-N (Hampton Research). Crystals were flash frozen to 293(2) K in a liquid nitrogen cooled stream of nitrogen. Initial scans of each specimen were performed to obtain preliminary unit cell parameters and to assess the mosaicity (breadth of spots between frames) of the crystal to select the required frame width for data collection. In this case frame widths of 0.5° was judged to be appropriate and full hemispheres of data were collected using the Bruker SMART1 software suite. Following data collection, reflections were sampled from all regions of the Ewald sphere to re-determine unit cell parameters for data integration and to check for rotational twinning using CELL_NOW2. In no data collection was evidence for crystal decay encountered. Following exhaustive review of the collected frames the resolution of the dataset was judged. Data was integrated using Bruker SAINT 3 software with a narrow frame algorithm and a 0.400 fractional lower limit of average intensity. Data was subsequently corrected for absorption by the program SADABS4. The space group determinations and test for merohedral twinning was carried out using XPREP3. In this case, the highest possible space group was chosen. The structure was solved by direct method and refined using the SHELXTL 975 software suite. Atoms were located from iterative examination of difference F-maps following least squares refinements of the earlier models. Final model was refined anisotropically (if the number of data permitted) until full convergence was achieved. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions (C-H = 0.93 Å) and included as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters 1.2-1.5 times Ueq of the attached C atoms. In some cases modeling of electron density within the voids of the frameworks did not lead to identification of recognizable solvent molecules in these structures, probably due to the highly disordered contents of the large pores in the frameworks. Highly porous crystals that contain solvent-filled pores often yield raw data where observed strong (high intensity) scattering becomes limited to ~1.0 Å at best, with higher resolution data present at low intensity. A common strategy for improving X-ray data, increasing the exposure time of the crystal to X-rays, did not improve the quality of the high angle data in this case, as the intensity from low angle data saturated the detector and minimal improvement in the high angle data was achieved. Additionally, diffused scattering from the highly disordered solvent within the void spaces of the framework and from the capillary to mount the crystal contributes to the background and the ‘washing out’ of the weaker data. The only optimal crystals suitable for analysis were generally small and weakly diffracting. Unfortunately, larger crystals, which would usually improve the quality of the data, presented a lowered degree of crystallinity and attempts to optimize the crystal growing conditions for large high-quality specimens have not yet been fruitful. Data were collected at 298(2) K for the MOF presented in this paper. This lower temperature was considered to be optimal for obtaining the best data. Electron density within void spaces has not been assigned to any guest entity but has been modeled as isolated oxygen and/or carbon atoms. The foremost errors in all the models are thought to lie in the assignment of guest electron density. The structure was examined using the Adsym subroutine of PLATON7 to assure that no additional symmetry could be applied to the models. The ellipsoids in ORTEP diagrams are displayed at the 50% probability level unless noted otherwise. For all structures we note that elevated R-values are commonly encountered in MOF crystallography for the reasons expressed above by us and by other research groups.8-17 Table S1 contains crystallographic data for the γ-Mg-formate. 1.

The loop was mounted on a SMART APEX three circle diffractometer. A total of 2830 reflections were collected of which 1417 were unique and 1000 of these were greater than 2σ (I). The range of θ was from 2.47 to 25.97º. All non- hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. γ-Mg-formate contains six formate anion and three metal atom in the asymmetric unit. It should be noted that other supporting characterization data (vide infra Section S1) are consistent with the crystal structure. Final full matrix least-squares refinement on F2 converged to R1 = 0.0687 (F >2σF)) and wR2 = 0.1257 (all data) with GOF = 0.937. Table S1.

In this work apart from the synthesis and experimental characterization ab-initio quantum chemical study (DFT) has been performed on the finite structure of α - formate and γ-Mg-formate. To build MOF based materials with high gas storage capacity it is essential to have a molecular level understanding of interactions. The storage capacity of different types of gases at different temperatures is strongly dependent upon the interactions between the MOF framework and gas molecules. The measure of this interaction is the adsorption energy between the framework and gas molecules. Low adsorption energies e.g. lower than -10 KJ/mol attribute to weak interaction and leads to physisorption. Whereas adsorption energies higher than these may lead to stronger interactions hence better binding to the framework,i.e, chemisorption. Finding the adsorption sites in the framework and their energies will also produce valuable information about the amount of the intake of gas molecules. If the adsorption energy is much higher at a particular site of the pore (e.g. near to the metal center) than other sites then the number of adsorbed gas molecules will be more at that particular site. Therefore first principle quantum chemistry calculations are useful to scan the adsorption sites and their respective adsorption energies to predict the adsorption capacity and further tuning the chemistry of the framework. In this study we have used grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation using the to predict the initial positions of the hydrogen molecules in the framework and ab-initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) method to optimize the positions of the each hydrogen molecules in the framework and their related adsorption energies. Initial structure generation. Selection of initial positions of hydrogen molecules in the framework is the most important step for calculating the probable binding sites and the corresponding binding energy. Proper scanning of pore surface is important to get the adsorption site with the highest binding energy. It is difficult to find homogeneously distributed initial positions of hydrogen molecules in the framework due to the 3 dimensional structure of the MOF. Even if we find homogeneously distributed positions, executing calculations for all the initial structure means large number of optimization calculations. Therefore, we choose the initial structure from the output of our classical grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation, which we have performed for calculating adsorption isotherms. The conventional GCMC simulation technique is used to compute adsorption isotherms. The input for the simulation consists of models (structures) for the adsorbent and the adsorbate as well as force fields which describe the interactions between them. MOFs are crystalline therefore model for the adsorbent in the atomistic representation of the framework is taken from its crystallographic coordinates. Here, for γ–Mg-formate we have used the original crystal structure ignoring the solvent molecule residing in the pore. In all the simulations, the framework is treated as rigid (a valid assumption for many MOFs at low temperature), although models for flexible MOFs have been proposed recently. We have calculated the theoretical gas adsorption isotherm for γ–formate and α- formate. In order to avoid boundary or finite size effects and to allow simulations that are valid for the extended crystal lattice, periodic boundary conditions has been used, resulting in simulations that take place in an infinite, perfect structure. To model adsorbate/adsorbate and adsorbate/framework interactions, van der Waals interactions (normally modelled by Lennard-Jones potentials) have been taken into account. Lennard- Jones (LJ) parameters for the individual atoms and for H2 molecule UFF potential parameters has been considered. LJ potential parameters for cross interactions were computed from Lorentz–Berthelot combining rules. The cutoff radii for both the MOFs were set to be 4.8 Å. For GCMC calculations the volume (V), the temperature (T) and the chemical potential (μ) are kept fixed and under these conditions, the average number of molecules adsorbed is computed. Each step in the Monte Carlo routine consisted of the insertion of a new molecule, deletion of an existing molecule, or translation of an existing molecule. A total of 5 million steps were used, the first half for equilibration and the second half to calculate the ensemble averages. A configuration is defined as an attempted translation, rotation, creation or deletion of a H2 molecule. The probability of attempting creation or deletion of a molecule was set to 0.3 an equation of state for hydrogen was used to obtain the relationship between the bulk pressure and fugacity. We have converted the total adsorption obtained from simulation to excess adsorption to compare with the experiments. The details of the conversion calculations can be found in the literature. Along with the adsorption isotherm the positions (coordinates) of the adsorbed hydrogen molecules in the pores of both of α and γ-Mg-formate were obtained. Finite structures (shown in figure S6) of the frameworks have been generated with different positions of hydrogen molecules. These initial structures were further optimized by ab-initio quantum chemical calculations. Calculation of adsorption energy and site. Finite structure obtained from the periodic structure possesses artificial dangling bonds. We have saturated those bonds with H atoms. For geometry optimization Gaussian 09 software suite has been used. The ModRedundant option has been employed to perform the selective optimization of H atoms which have been attached to the clusters to saturate the dangling bonds at the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory to get the energy, E(BAREMOF) of the finite structure. Hydrogen molecule on the finite structure was inserted at the same positions that we obtained from GCMC simulation. Then we have optimized the positions of hydrogen molecules of each initial structure containing finite formate clusters (α-formate and γ– Mg-formate both) and one hydrogen molecule using density functional theory (DFT) with 6-31G basis set. The energies we calculated from these calculations are for adsorbate-adsorbent complex, E(BAREMOF+H2). We have determined the binding energy of hydrogen using the following equation, where E(H2) is the energy of H2 molecule obtained from DFT calculation with the same basis set. Eads = E(BAREMOF+H2) - (E(BAREMOF)+E(H2)) Adsorption energies after optimization of all initial configurations for each type of MOFs were compared. The lowest adsorption energies refer to the positions of the hydrogen molecules in the pores and reported in the paper.
