The copper complexes 1−4 are discrete molecules to three-dimensional (3D) inﬁnite networks. Complexes 1 and 2 formed in diﬀerent reaction temperatures exhibit a mononuclear motif and one-dimensional (1D) chain, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 were obtained through controlling reaction solvent systems, and 3 features a two-dimensional (2D) (4,4) network by taking the binuclear [Cu2(Cl)2] as 4-connecting nodes, whereas 4 is a 3-fold interpenetrating mog net with Point (Schläﬂi) symbol of (4·64·8)2(42·62·82). The 4-HIBA−ligands act as rod-type two-connectors to connect metal Cd(II) centers into 4- connected 3D frameworks with diﬀerent topologies: binodal 4-connected network with a Point (Schläﬂi) symbol of (86) (5) and uninodal (65·8) net (6), uninodal 4-connected [2 + 2] interpenetrating (66) dia net (7), and 5-fold interpenetrating dia net (8), respectively. Complex 9 has a 1D double chain structure, while 10 and 11 are isostructural as 7. Fluorescence and gas adsorption properties of the compounds have also been explored. ■INTRODUCTION Crystal engineering of metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) assembled from inorganic and organic building units has now reached a stage where signiﬁcant interest is slowly shifting from design strategies of artistic architectures to exploration for potential applications in luminescence, gas storage/separation, chemical sensing and catalysis for speciﬁc reactions, and so on.1 In terms of the fabrication of MOFs, the assembly with desired structural types is totally dependent on the judicious choice of appropriate organic spacers,2 and reaction conditions such as temperature, solvent, metal center, and pH value also have an important inﬂuence on the structures of the resulting coordination polymers.3 In this regard, organic linkers with N and/or O donors often have been employed as eﬀective building blocks in the construction of MOFs.4 Among the N- donors, polytopic imidazole-containing ligands with two diﬀerent series of 1H-imidazol-1-yl or 1H-imidazol-4-yl moieties have been intensively engaged in the formation of MOFs associated with interesting structures, topologies, and properties in our systematic studies (Scheme 1).5,6 Apparently, the 1H-imidazol-1-yl-containing ligands or its analogue can only act as neutral ligands to utilize terminal N atoms to ligate metal ions,5 therefore, showing rigid coordination modes. Comparatively, the 1H-imidazol-4-yl groups can be deproto- nated to form the imidazolate anion and provide diﬀerently positioned N atoms of imidazolyl groups to connect metal atoms, possessing more ﬂexible coordination modes.6 Similarly, the O-donors of carboxylate groups have versatile coordination modes as well, and thus the designable ligands incorporating multi-N and carboxylate groups may be a useful strategy for construction of novel MOFs.7 For example, the series of difunctional organic linkers combining anionic carboxylates and neutral 1H-imidazol-1-yl donors such as 4-(1H-imidazol-1- yl)benzoic acid (HIBA) and 3,5-di(imidazol-1-yl)benzoic acid, which are employed as good candidates for the construction of MOFs in our previous study.7a−d The HIBA ligand was successfully employed as an IBA−anion to construct some novel MOFs that showed interesting reversible guest-depend- Received: December 4, 2013 Revised: July 17, 2014 Published: July 21, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/crystal © 2014 American Chemical Society 3727 dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg401811c | Cryst. Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3727−3741 ent dynamic behavior and single-crystal to single-crystal transformations.8 In this work, considering that the 1H- imidazol-4-yl moiety may possess more ﬂexible coordinate sites as exhibited in our previous study,6 we endowed the backbone of HIBA with the 1H-imidazol-4-yl moiety instead of its 1H-imidazol-1-yl group and synthesized a new ligand 4-(1H- imidazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (4-H2IBA) (Scheme 2). It is noteworthy that the subtle modiﬁcation employed on the HIBA can signiﬁcantly increase the resultant ligand’s coordination diversities, which may have the potential to construct diverse frameworks. In this paper, we report the construction and properties of 11 complexes based on the linker incorporating difunctional groups of 1H-imidazol-4-yl and carboxylate donors. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION All the commercially available chemicals and solvents are of reagent grade and used as received without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were performed on a PerkinElmer 240C Elemental Analyzer at the Modern Analysis Center of Nanjing University. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 500 NMR spectrometer at room temperature. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a simultaneous SDT 2960 thermal analyzer under nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. FT-IR spectra were recorded in the range of 400−4000 cm−1 on a Bruker Vector22 FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. The luminescence spectra for the powdered solid samples were measured on an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectroﬂuorometer with a xenon arc lamp as the light source. In the measurements of emission and excitation spectra the path width is 5 nm, and all the measurements were carried out under the same experimental conditions. Power X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) patterns were measured on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diﬀractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation at room temperature. Nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) sorption experiments were carried out on a Belsorp-max volumetric gas sorption instrument. The sample was activated by using the “outgas” function of the surface area analyzer for 24 h at 180 °C. Preparation of 4-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)benzoic Acid (4-H2IBA).

Crystallography.

The diﬀraction data were integrated by using the SAINT program,10 which was also used for the intensity corrections for the Lorentz and polarization eﬀects. Semiempirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program.11 The structures were solved by direct methods, and all the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically on F2 by the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXL-97 crystallographic software package.12 The hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically except those of water molecules (O3, O4) in 1, (O5, O6) in 2, (O4) in 5, (C12, C13, C15) in 7, and (O1W, O2W) in 8 were located directly. The distribution of peaks in the channels of 10 and 11 was chemically featureless to reﬁne using conventional discrete-atom models. To resolve these issues, the contributions of the electron density by the remaining C2H5OH and DMF in 10, and the DMF molecules in 11 were removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON.13 The numbers of solvent molecules were obtained by element analyses. The compounds of 5, 6, and 8 crystallized in tetragonal space group P4̅n2, orthorhombic space group Pna21, and monoclinic space group Cc with Flack parameter of about −0.04(7), −0.01(2), and 0.07(5) respectively, conﬁrming the correct absolute structures.14 The noncentrosymmetric space groups are probably due to some polar packing within the networks, induced by strong chain hydrogen bonding and the same orientation.15 The details of the crystal parameters, data collection, and reﬁnements for the complexes are summarized in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and angles with their estimated standard deviations are listed in Table S2, Supporting Information. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Description of Crystal Structures. Complex [Cu(4- HIBA)2(H2O)4] (1). The result of X-ray diﬀraction analysis revealed that complex 1 crystallizes in a triclinic form with space group of P1̅, and the asymmetric unit has a half molecule of [Cu(4-HIBA)2(H2O)4], namely, a Cu(II) atom sitting on a special position with a half of occupancy, one 4-HIBA−ligand, and two coordinated water molecules. As exhibited in Figure 1a, compound 1 represents a molecular complex structure with mononuclear octahedral [CuN2(H2O)4] bonded to two 4- HIBA−ligands and four coordinated water molecules. The uncoordinated carboxylate group of 4-HIBA−deprotonate to act as an anionic component to balance the positive charge of the metal ions (Scheme 3, I), and rich hydrogen bonds are present between the carboxylate groups and terminal coordinated water molecules (Table S2, Supporting Informa- tion). As a result, the mononuclear units of 1 are linked together by this set of strong charge-assisted hydrogen bonds resulting from aqua ligands to the carboxylate O atoms, Table 1. continued compound 9 10 11 θ range /° 1.87−27.58 2.20−27.53 2.19−27.48 reflns collected 11001 9845 9559 independent reflns 4091 3170 3170 goodness-of-fit 1.069 0.980 1.045 R1a (I > 2σ(I)) 0.0313 0.0319 0.0414 wR2b (I > 2σ(I)) 0.1109 0.0859 0.1355 aR1 =Σ||F0| −|Fc||/Σ|F0|. bwR2 = |Σw(|F0|2 −|Fc|2)|/Σ|w(F0)2|1/2, where w = 1/[σ2(F0 2) + (aP)2 + bP].

Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3727−3741 3730 generating a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular frame- work (Figure 1b).16 Particularly, the benzene ring rings between the adjacent two-dimensional (2D) layers are parallel with a dihedral angle of 0.00(81)° and are separated by a centroid−centroid distance of 3.83 Å, indicating the presence of π−π stacking interactions (Figure 1b).17 Crystal Structure of [CuIICuI(4-HIBA)(4-IBA)(H2O)2]·2.3H2O (2). When the reaction temperature is changed to 120 °C in the reaction system of 1, a new complex 2 with a diﬀerent structure was isolated. As reported previously, nitrogenous ligands are eﬀective reducing agents under hydrothermal condition, and consequently, mixed valence or fully reduced metal centers are very common in the hydrothermal products especially for the metal copper.18 In this case, reduction occurred in the hydrothermal medium to produce the mixed-valence Cu(II)/ Cu(I) species 2. Compound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c and exhibits one-dimensional (1D) chain. The divalent Cu1 atom is six-coordinated with distorted octahedral coordination geometry deﬁned by NO5 donor set (Figure 2a). The equatorial plane is built up by one nitrogen atom from 4-imidazolyl group [Cu1−N1 = 1.943(3) Å] (Table S1), one oxygen of carboxylate group [Cu1−O1A = 1.989(2) Å], and two water molecules [Cu1−O5 = 1.980(3) Å, Cu1−O6 = 1.999(2) Å], while the two axial positions are occupied by one oxygen of carboxylate group and one water molecule [Cu1−O2A = 2.469(2) Å, Cu1−O6B = 2.502(2) Å], which are signiﬁcantly longer than those of the equatorial Cu−O bond lengths due to the Jahn−Teller distortion.19 Two Cu1 atoms are linked by two μ2-H2O molecules forming a binuclear [Cu2(H2O)2] subunit with a Cu···Cu distance of 3.454(6) Å. The monovalent Cu2 atom adopts a linear coordination geometry with two N atoms from two diﬀerent ligands [Cu2− N2 = 1.861(3) Å, Cu2−N3 = 1.873(3) Å, N2−Cu2−N3 = 178.41(14)°] (Table S1). It is noteworthy that the 4-H2IBA ligands are deprotonated to give 4-HIBA−and 4-IBA2−with diﬀerent coordination modes in 2 (Scheme 3, II and III), and these two kinds of anion ligands link the copper centers into a 1D chain (Figure 2b). The adjacent 1D chains pack together via extensive O−H···O and C−H···O hydrogen bonds interactions, generating a 3D supramolecular framework, as shown in Figure 2c (Table S2). Crystal Structure of [Cu(4-HIBA)(Cl)] (3). Compound 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, and the asymmetric unit contains one unique Cu(II) atom, one 4- HIBA−ligand, and one coordinated chloride ion. As depicted in Figure 3a, each Cu1 is ﬁve-coordinated by one N atom from 4- HIBA−ligand, two O atoms from chelating carboxylate group and two μ2-Cl−anions to form distorted square-pyramidal coordination geometry with a τ factor of 0.012.20 The Cu−Cl bond distances of 2.286(11) and 2.720(12), and Cu−Cl−Cu angle of 84.40(34)° in 3 are fairly consistent with the corresponding Cu−Cl distances and the Cu−Cl−Cu angles of the similar μ2-chloro-bridged dicopper(II) complexes.21 Each such binuclear subunit links four identical ones through four linear bridging 4-HIBA−ligands (Scheme 3, III), leading to formation of a 2D network with (4,4) topology by taking the binuclear SBUs as 4-connecting nodes and the 4-HIBA−ligands as linkers (Figure 3b). The 2D layers are further linked together via intermolecular hydrogen bonds to generate a 3D structure (Figure 3c). Crystal Structure of [Cu3(4-HIBA)6]·7.8H2O (4). When the mixed solvent of H2O/DMA was utilized in place of the system of H2O/DMF under similar synthetic conditions in 3, a diﬀerent structure was formed for 4. In the structure of complex 4, the asymmetric unit consists of one and a half of crystallographically independent Cu(II) atoms, three 4-HIBA− ligands, and 3.9 free water molecules. As shown in Figure 4a, The coordination geometry around Cu1 atom is square- pyramidal deﬁned by two carboxylate O atoms and two N atoms (O1, O3, N1A, and N3B) at the basal position, and another carboxylate O atom (O2) at the apical position with a τ factor of 0.030. The Cu2 atom with a half of occupancy exhibits a distorted octahedral environment in which the basal plane consists of the two O atoms from carboxylate groups and two 4-imidazolyl N atoms while the axial position is ﬁlled by two symmetrical O atoms (O6 and O6C) from carboxylate groups of two diﬀerent 4-HIBA−ligands with Cu−O bond distances substantially longer than the equatorial ones due to the Jahn− Teller distortion (Table S1).19 On the other hand, each 4- HIBA−ligand in 4 employs a μ2-bridge to connect two Cu(II) atoms by means of the terminal imidazolyl and carboxylate groups. Two kinds of 4-HIBA−ligands bridge the Cu(II) atoms to form a 2D layer with (6, 3) topology where Cu1 and Cu2 act Figure 1.

The third kind of 4-HIBA−ligands acts as two-connector pillars to link Cu(II) atoms of adjacent 2D nets to form 3D pillar-layered frameworks with large channels (14.42 Å × 38.96 Å) along the Figure 2.

From the viewpoint of topology, Cu1 and Cu2 centers are all surrounded by four 4-HIBA−ligands, which can be viewed as 4-connected nodes. Each Cu1 node is connected with two Cu1 and two Cu2 nodes with the Cu···Cu distances and adjacent Cu···Cu···Cu angles in the range of 11.740(12)−12.299(10) Å and 67.955−140.503°, respectively, indicating a considerable distortion from the ideal tetrahedron (Figure S1). Each Cu2 node, however, is bridged with four Cu1 nodes. The Cu···Cu distances and adjacent Cu···Cu···Cu angles are in the range of 11.741(12)−12.299(10) Å and 67.955− 180.00°, respectively, exhibiting a slight distortion from the ideal planar square (Figure S1). As a consequence, the whole net is constructed by mixed nodes ratio of 2:1 for distorted tetrahedral and planar nodes, displaying binodal 4-connected mog net22 with Point (Schläﬂi) symbol of (4·64·8)2(42·62·82) and long symbol of 4·88·6·6·6·6 and 4·4·62·62·86·86, by TOPOS program23 (Figure 4d). In order to minimize the big hollow cavities and stabilize the framework, the large cavities are completely ﬁlled via mutual interpenetration of the independ- ent frameworks, leading to the formation of a 3-fold interpenetrating 3D architecture (Figure 4e). Despite the 3- fold interpenetration, the total void value of the channel with a pore diameter approximately 3.4 Å (considering van der Waals radii) is estimated (by PLATON)13 to be 1221.1 Å3, 32.7% of the total crystal volume of 3766.0 Å3 ﬁlled by disordered water molecules. Crystal Structure of [Cd(4-HIBA)2(H2O)]·2H2O (5). Complex 5 was prepared by layered diﬀusion of solutions of 4-H2IBA and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O. X-ray crystallography shows that 5 crystal- lizes in a tetragonal system space group P4̅n2 (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of 5 contains two crystallographically independent Cd(II) atoms both sitting on a special position with a quarter of occupancy, one 4-HIBA−ligand, half of coordinated water molecule, and one free water molecule. As shown in Figure 5a, the Cd1 has a distorted octahedral environment, in which the equatorial plane contains N1, N1A, N1B, and N1C from four distinct 4-HIBA−ligands, and the atoms O3 and O3C from two diﬀerent water molecules occupy the axial positions with an O3−Cd1−O3C angle of 180.0° (Table S1). The Cd2 atom is eight-coordinated by four pairs of O (O1, O2; O1D, O2D; O1E, O2E and O1F, O2F) atoms of chelating carboxylate groups from four diﬀerent 4-HIBA−via symmetry transformation forming a tetragonal antiprismatic geometry.24 The coordination angles around Cd(II) center range from 52.24(9) to 180.0°, and the Cd−O fall in the range of 2.287(3)−2.619(3) Å and Cd−N bond lengths is 2.270(3) Å respectively, which are compatible to those of other Cd(II) complexes reported previously.25 In 5, it is noticeable that these two distinct Cd(II) centers are alternately interconnected by 4- HIBA−to generate a 3D inﬁnite framework, showing triangular channels with a pore diameter approximately 3.5 Å viewed along the b axis (Figure 5b). The total void value of the channel without water guests is estimated (by PLATON) to be 702.7 Å3, 28.6% of the total crystal volume of 2456.5 Å3. Topologically, 4-HIBA−ligand links two Cd(II) atoms and each Cd(II) connects four 4-HIBA−in turn; accordingly the 4- HIBA−, Cd1, and Cd2 can be regarded as a 2-, 4-, and 4- connected nodes, respectively. According to the simpliﬁcation Figure 4. (a) The coordination environment of Cu(II) atom in 4 with the ellipsoids drawn at the 30% probability level.

Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3727−3741 3733 principle, the resulting structure of the complex 5 is a binodal 4- connected net with a Point (Schläﬂi) symbol of (86) (Figure 5c). Crystal Structure of [Cd(4-HIBA)2] (6). Heating a mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and 4-H2IBA dissolved in DMF−H2O (1:8, v/v, 9 mL) at 80 °C for 72 h aﬀorded pure-phase 6 as colorless block crystals. The asymmetric unit of 6 is composed of one Cd(II) atom, two 4-HIBA−ligands as shown in Figure 6a. In 6, the Cd1 center with O4N2 binding set is coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from two distinct 4-IBA−ligands and two nitrogen atoms from other two 4-IBA−ligands, displaying a highly distorted octahedral coordination sphere. A distance of 2.806 Å between Cd1 and O4B indicates the existence of weak interaction between them.25c Interestingly, the 1H-imidazol-4- yl group exhibits variable coordination modes as we have reported (Scheme 3, II and IV),6d and in 6, two diﬀerent 4- HIBA−ligands ﬂexibly utilize diﬀerent positioned N atoms of 4- imidazolyl groups to meet with the requirement of coordination geometries of metal ions with the Cd1···Cd1A and Cd1···Cd1B (symmetry codes: A, 0.5 + x, 0.5 −y, 1 + z; B, 1 −x, 1 −y, −0.5 + z) separation of 12.86(14) and 9.19(8) Å, respectively. It is noticeable that the left- and right-handed Cd(II)−(4- HIBA−) 1D helical chain motifs coexist with a 1:1 ratio in the bc plane (Figure 6b). The Cd(II) −(4-HIBA−) 1D chains are interconnected by another kind of 4-HIBA−to generate a 3D network (Figure 6b). Topologically, the linear 4-HIBA−ligand and Cd(II) atom can be regarded as 2- and 4-connected nodes respectively, and the overall framework of 6 is accordingly simpliﬁed as illustrated in Figure 6c, which is also a uninodal 4- connected net with its Point (Schläﬂi) symbol of (65·8). Crystal Structure of [Cd(4-HIBA)2]·2DMF (7), [Zn(4-HIBA)2]· C2H5OH·DMF (10), and [Co(4-HIBA)2]·2DMF (11). Complexes 7, 10, and 11 crystallize in the same orthorhombic Pnna space group with similar cell parameters (Table 1), and the results of X-ray crystallographic analysis indicate that they are isomor- phous and isostructural, exhibiting an unusual [2 + 2] diamond framework (dia net). Thus, as a typical example, only the structure of 7 is described here in detail. In 7, the asymmetric unit has a half molecule of [Cd(4-HIBA)2]·2DMF, namely, a Cd(II) atom sitting on a special position with a half of occupancy, one partly deprotonated 4-HIBA−ligand, as well as two halves of lattice DMF molecules. The Cd(II) atom is six coordinated with two pairs of oxygen atoms of chelating carboxylate groups from two symmetry related 4-HIBA− ligands and two N atoms from other two 4-HIBA−ligands (Figure 7a). The average Co1−O and Co1−N distances are 2.395(2) and 2.249(2) Å, respectively, while the coordination angles around the Cd1 are in the range of 54.24(8)− 151.31(8)° (Table S1). Given that the chelating carboxylates are treated as one connecting point, each Cd(II) atom is connected to four adjacent Cd(II) atoms through the four linear 4-HIBA−linkers to result in a 3D diamond-like framework with the point symbol 66 and the long symbol 62· 62·62·62·62·62, typical of a dia topology, containing large adamantanoid cages (Figure 7b,c). The Cd···Cd distances separated by 4-HIBA−ligand are 12.646(17) Å, respectively, and the Cd···Cd···Cd angles range from 100.59° to 127.19°, which is a signiﬁcant deviation from the 109.5° expected for an idealized diamond network. A single adamantanoid framework is illustrated in Figure 7b, which possesses maximum dimensions (the longest intracage distances across the unit Figure 5.

Such a large cavity causes four independent equivalent cages to inter- penetrate with each other (Figure 7d). An analysis of the topology of interpenetration according to recent classiﬁcation26 reveals that 7 belongs to Class IIIa (all the interpenetrated nets are generated only by translation and the translating vector is the crystallographic c axis (11.25 Å)). In spite of the fact that many 3D nets with diamond topology of various inter- penetration degrees ranging from 2- to 25-fold have been reported,27 4-fold dia interpenetrating MOFs with [2 + 2] mode are relatively scarce.28 Despite even 4-fold inter- penetration, a 1D porous framework with rhombic channels along the b axis (distance from atom to atom: 22.58 × 19.60 Å) ﬁlled with DMF molecules is also generated in the compound. The total void value of the channel without DMF guests is estimated to be 1386.6 Å3, approximately 46.9% of the total crystal volume of 2957.4 Å3. Crystal Structure of [Cd2(4-HIBA)4]·H2O (8). When the mixed solvent of DMF/EtOH was utilized in place of the system of DMF/H2O under similar synthetic conditions in 6, a diﬀerent structure was formed for 8. In contrast to 6, complex 8 crystallizes in monoclinic space group Cc, rather than the orthorhombic space group Pna21 in 6 (Table 1). Each Cd(II) center with distorted octahedral coordination geometry is six- coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N1, N3) from two diﬀerent 4-HIBA−ligands with Cd−N bond lengths of 2.256(9) and 2.217(9) Å, and four oxygen atoms (O1A, O2A, O3B, O4B) from two pairs of chelating carboxylate groups of 4-HIBA−ligands with Cd−O bond lengths in the range of 2.262(6)−2.581(8) Å (Figure 8a and Table S1). On the other hand, each 4-HIBA−ligand links two adjacent Cd(II) ions, and four 4-HIBA−ligands coordinated to one Cd(II) have a pseudotetrahedral extension. Thus, a 3D dia network with Schläﬂi symbols of 66 is formed (Figure 8b), which consists of elongated [Cd10(4-IBA−)6] adamantane-liked subunits with a furthest top-to-bottom length of 34.28 Å. In order to minimize the big hollow cavities in 8 and stabilize the overall network, the huge chamber facilitates other four independent equivalent networks to interpenetrate, generating a 5-fold interpenetrated 3D architecture (Figure 8c). Topologically, the structure of complex 8 consists of dia framework, and ﬁve independent dia nets are interpenetrated within the whole structure, related by a translation vector corresponding to the crystallographic c axis (7.64 Å). Diﬀerent from 7, complex 8 belongs to Class Ia, which means all independent nets are related by a single vector.26 Despite the 5-fold interpenetration, 8 still possesses large triangular channels with a pore diameter 4 Å along the c direction (Figure 8d), estimated to be about 536.6 Å3, that is, 23.2% of the unit cell. Crystal Structure of [Zn(4-HIBA)2]·H2O (9). When Zn- (NO3)2·6H2O, instead of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, was used in the reaction of 6, 9 with a diﬀerent structure was isolated. Compound 9 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1̅. The X-ray diﬀraction study revealed that the asymmetric unit of 9 contains one unique Zn(II) atom coordinated by two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N3ii) from two diﬀerent 4-HIBA−ligands and two carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2 and O4i) from other two 4- HIBA−, thereby forming a 4-coordinated tetrahedral coordina- Figure 6.

Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3727−3741 3735 tion geometry with a N2O2 donor set (Figure 9a). The Zn1−N and Zn1−O average bond lengths are 1.9320(16) and 2.0282(18) Å, respectively, and the coordination angles around Zn1 are in the range of 100.02(8)−117.18(8) (Table S1). Pairs of 4-HIBA−ligands use carboxylate and imidazole groups to link Zn(II) atoms to form an inﬁnite 1D chain (Figure 9b), which are further connected into 2D layer by hydrogen bonding interaction between free water molecule and 1D chain (Figure 9c). In the crystal packing diagram, the 2D layers pack together via N−H···O, O−H···O, and C−H···O hydrogen bonds, which further consolidate the structure of the complex (Table S2), generating a 3D supramolecular structure (Figure 9d). Synthesis of the Complexes and Comparison of the Structures. In the context, the networks of 1−11 produced in this work are determined by the coordination environments of metal and linking modes of 4-H2IBA ligand as well as the selection of reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, solvent systems, and counterions. Reaction temperature is a key factor in controlling the topology and dimensionality of the frameworks by thermal desolvation and changing the coordination modes.29 Under the same reaction solvent, molecular complex 1 was obtained at 80 °C, while 2 with 1D chain was crystallized at a high temperature 120 °C. This result indicates that formations of 1 and 2 are thermodynamically controlled. In addition to reaction temperature, the experiments reveal that the mixed solvent systems regulate the formation of the self-assembly process for three pairs of complexes of 3, 4; 6, 8; and 9, 10.3f Using the diﬀerent reaction solvents to obtain 3 (DMF−H2O/1:5) and 4 (DMA−H2O/1:5), it means that the organic solvent DMF and DMA can play important role in determining the structures of the complexes by the synergy eﬀect of the diﬀerent volume of DMF or DMA molecules as well as the template eﬀect.30 Two pair of complexes 6, 8 and 9, 10 were synthesized under the reaction system of DMF/H2O (v/v = 1:8) and DMF/C2H5OH (v/v = 1:1) respectively, which may suggest that polarity of solvent can insensibly inﬂuence the crystal growth. In this case, it is apparent that the polarity of DMF/H2O (v/v = 1:8) in 6 and 9 is stronger than that of DMF/C2H5OH (v/v = 1:1) in 8 and 10. Considering the eﬀect of polarity of the solvent on the assembly of complexes, we have attempted to regulate the DMF/H2O ratio ranging from 1/8 to 3/4, and as a result, the yield of compound 6 gradually decreased with increasing of apolar solvent DMF. In this mixed solvent system, apolar DMF was mainly employed as a weak base to deprotonate 4-H2IBA and provide automatic control of the acid/base balance of the solution.30 When polar H2O solvent was replaced by less polar C2H5OH solvent, new complex 8 was synthesized. Further study has shown that complex 8 can be obtained from the mixed solvent system of DMF with other less polar solvents such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, and acetonitrile, but the mixed solvents of DMF with polar H2O are in favor of the formation of 6. On the other hand, 4-H2IBA involving difunctional groups of carboxylate and 4-imidazolyl can exert diverse coordination modes as shown in Scheme 3. Generally, the carboxylate group of 4-H2IBA are easily deprotonated to give 4-HIBA−to ligate with bivalent metal ion, forming the building units of {M(II)(4- Figure 7.

Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3727−3741 3737 HIBA−)2} with a 1:2 ratio for metal ion and 4-HIBA−ligand, as exhibited in complexes 1 and 4−11. In addition, it should be mentioned that the 1H-imidazol-4-yl group of 4-H2IBA can not only deprotonate to give the imidazolate anion to build complex 2 (Type III, Scheme 3), as we have previously reported,6a−c but also ﬂexibly employ the 1-/3-N coordination site to satisfy the geometric need of metal centers in the assembly process as shown in 6 and 9 (Scheme 3). Also, the nature of diﬀerent metal centers is a key factor to construct diverse frameworks, and diﬀerent coordination geometry around CuII/I/CdII centers resulted in completely diﬀerent structures for two series of CuII/I/CdII complexes 1−8. Compared to the ionic radius of Cu(II) ion (73 pm), that of disparate Cd(II) metal ion (97 pm) is relatively larger; as a result it has tendency to adopt higher coordination numbers to accommodate more bulkiness in its coordination sphere, thereby forming complicated or higher dimensional struc- tures.31 But in this work, higher coordination numbers Cd(II) centers are just ligated by carboxylate groups in μ1-η1:η1- chelating mode to form the same 4-connected nodes as Cu(II), Zn(II), and Co(II) centers. Therefore, similar coordination geometry around CdII/ZnII/CoII centers makes complexes 7, 10, and 11 isostructural. Generally, there are two types of nodes to be involved in this 4-connected coordination geometry, and the diﬀerent target nets produced rely on which type is present. For example, the square planar node favors the generation of NbO (64·82-a), CdSO4 (65·8), Ivt (42·84), and quartz dual net (75·9), whereas the tetrahedral node would typically lead to quartz (64·82-b), diamond (66), and SrAl2 (42·63·8) nets.32 The combination of mixed nodes is less reported, which is dependent upon the nodes ratio of 1:1 (PtS) or 2:1 (mog), respectively.33 In the case of 4, mixed 4-connected nodes with ratio of 2:1 for distorted tetrahedral and planar nodes are connected into the mog framework with Point (Schläﬂi) symbol of (4·64·8)2(42·62·82). Complex 5 can be simpliﬁed to a tetrahedral binodal 4-connected topology with the short symbol of 86 and the full vertex symbol of 8·8·8·8·82·82, while 6 is tetrahedrally uninodal 4-connected net with the short symbol of the net (65·8). For 6, it looks like the tetrahedral nodes have the same short point symbol as that observed in the well-known CdSO4 net (65·8), but they can be distinguished by their vertex symbols, 6·6·6·6·62·8∞for CdSO4 while 6·6·6·6·62·82 for the present net. 7, 10, 11, and 8 can be simpliﬁed as 66 dia net based on tetrahedral uninodes, but 7, 10, and 11 are a [2 + 2] interpenetrating dia net belonging to Class IIIa, while 8 is another diﬀerent 5-fold interpenetrating dia net of Class Ia. The diﬀerent structures of 7 and 8 may ascribe to the fact that the vacant channel of 7 is decorated by the bulky DMF molecules, which reduces the eﬀective void volume and may inﬂuence the topological type of dia and also suppress the occurrence of 5-fold interpenetration as 8. Interestingly, the complex {[Cd(IBA)2]·2DMF}n built from Cd(II) cations and IBA−by Bharadwaj group has the identical building blocks in the same ratio as [Cd(4-HIBA)2]·2DMF (7) except its structure moiety of IBA−in discordance with that of 4- HIBA−(Scheme 2),8b but their frameworks are diﬀerent. {[Cd(IBA)2]·2DMF}n is the 4-fold interpenetrated 3D dia net of Class Ia, related by a translation vector corresponding to the crystallographic a axis (8.25 Å) rather than the [2 + 2] interpenetrating (66) dia net for 7. Thermal Stabilities and Powder X-ray Diﬀraction of the Complexes. Complexes 1−11 were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to ascertain the stability of their respective supramolecular architectures, and the results are shown in Supporting Information Figure S2. For 1, the ﬁrst weight loss of 13.9% in 95−175 °C indicates the exclusion of two coordinated water molecules (calc. 14.12%), and the decomposition of the residue occurred at 260 °C. A total weight loss of 13.2% was observed for 2 in the temperature range of 55−195 °C, which is attributed to the loss of water molecules (calc. 13.33%), and the residue is stable up to about 295 °C. No obvious weight loss was found for 3 before the decomposition of the framework occurred at about 210 °C, which is in good agreement with the results of the crystal structure. Complex 4 shows a weight loss of 9.6% in the temperature range of 50−135 °C corresponding to the release of lattice water molecules (calc. 9.67%), and pyrolysis of the residue occurs at 235 °C with consecutive weight losses, which did not stop until the sample was heated to 700 °C. Complex 5 shows a weight loss of 9.8% in the temperature range of 65− 120 °C corresponding to the release of free and coordinated water molecules (calc. 9.98%), and the decomposition of the residue occurred at 330 °C. No obviously weight loss was found for complex 6 before the decomposition of the framework occurred at about 400 °C, which is in good agreement with the result of the crystal structure. For 7, the framework is instable in air, accompanied by a series of consecutive steps of weight loss until heating ends, and the end product of decomposition of complex 7 is CdO with a weight percentage of 20.6% (calc. 20.28%). A total weight loss of 1.9% was observed for 8 around 100 °C, which is attributed to the loss of the coordinated water molecules (calc. 1.81%), and the residue is stable up to about 400 °C. For 9, a weight loss starts at 175 °C with the liberation of the free water molecules with a weight of 3.81% (calc. 3.83%), and the decomposition of the residue observed at about 325 °C. The TGA curves for 10 and 11 display weight losses of 22.21% and 25.02% at 195 and 210 °C, respectively, suggesting the loss of the corresponding free solvent molecules (calc. 21.29% for 10 and 25.22% for 11), and the frameworks of 10 and 11 are stable up to 325 and 315 °C, respectively. The pure phase of the complexes was proven by the powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD), where the patterns of as- synthesized 1−6 and 8−11 are consistent with the correspond- ing simulated ones (Figure S3). However, complex 7 cannot be a stable porous material because it easily loses its crystallinity upon being exposed to the atmosphere despite 7 holding an apparent solvent accessible volume ratio of 46.9%. The further stability information about the porous structures is required in order to make gas adsorption measurements for the porous materials of 4, 5, and 8. After heating of 4, 5, and 8 at 180 °C for 24 h in a vacuum, the guest water molecules were removed. The PXRD patterns at varied temperature show that the framework of 4, 5, and 8 are retained (Figure S3), indicating that complexes 4, 5, and 8 have permanent porosity after evacuation. Luminescent Properties. Inorganic−organic hybrid coor- dination complexes, especially with d10 metal centers, have been investigated for ﬂuorescence properties owing to their potential applications as luminescent materials.34 The ﬂuorescence properties of the stable materials 5, 6, 8, and 9, as well as free 4-H2IBA ligand have been investigated in the solid state at room temperature, as depicted in Figure S4. The free 4-H2IBA ligand shows intense emission band at 415 nm upon excitation at 366 nm, which may be attributed to π* →π transition of the intraligands.35 It can be seen that compounds 5 and 6 exhibit strong broad blue photoluminescence with emission maxima at Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg401811c | Cryst. Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3727−3741 3738 510 and 505 nm upon excitation at 415 and 405 nm. In contrast to the case for the free ligand, the emission bands of complexes 5 and 6 are 95 and 90 nm red-shifted, respectively. Such board emission bands may be tentatively assigned to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT).36 However, the ﬂuorescent emission at 428 nm (λex = 366 nm) and 418 nm (λex = 358 nm) observed in 8 and 9 may be tentatively assigned to the intraligand ﬂuorescence since the free ligand exhibited a similar emission under the same condition.37 In addition, it is noteworthy that the enhancement of luminescence for the complexes 5, 6, 8, and 9 compared with the free ligand under the same conditions may mainly originate from the coordination interactions between the metal Cd(II) atom and the ligand, which enhanced its conformational rigidity and then decreased the nonradiative energy loss.38 Gas Sorption Properties. As discussed above, the frameworks 4, 5, and 8 can maintain their porous framework after evacuation, and thus gas adsorption properties of the complexes can be expected. The N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms for the porous desolvated materials 4′, 5′, and 8′ are shown in Figures 10−12, respectively. It can be seen that no N2 uptake was observed at 77 K for 4′ and 5′ in the low-pressure region, and only shows 51.73 cm3/g and 39.34 cm3/g at 1 atm, which exhibits type III sorption proﬁles, suggesting that only surface adsorption occurs (Figures 10 and 11).39 The gas sorption isotherms shows the CO2 uptake of 43.07 cm3/g and 19.33 cm3/g at 195 K and 1 atm equivalent to 1.26 and 0.42 CO2 molecules per formula unit of the solid 4′ and 5′ respectively, and a little hysteresis were observed between the adsorption and desorption curves. Except that the distinct diﬀerence of adsorption capacity between CO2 and N2 for 4′ and 5′ must be mainly associated with the smaller kinetic diameters of CO2 (3.3 Å) than that of N2 (3.64 Å), the Quadrupole Moment of CO2 (−1.4 × 10−39 Cm2) is the important factor that aﬀect the distinct diﬀerence of adsorption capacity.40 The gas adsorption isotherms of 8′ display a steep rise at the relative low pressure region which can be categorized as reversible type-I, exhibiting a typical permanent micro- porosity (Figure 12). The amounts of adsorbed N2 and CO2 increase abruptly at the beginning and reach to 75.24 cm3/g (9.40 wt %) for N2 at 77 K and 0.9 atm, 63.54 cm3/g (12.48 wt %) for CO2 at 195 K and 1 atm, corresponding to 3.27 N2 and 2.76 CO2 molecules per formula unit were adsorbed for 8′. Therefore, 8′ exhibits no selective adsorption property for N2 and CO2 gases, but that is distinct from selective adsorption of the porous imidazolate framework [Co(HL)]·DMF·H2O [H3L = 1,3,5-tri(1H-imidazol-4-yl)benzene] built from the Co(II)- Im−moieties by our groups.6b The diﬀerence of the selective sorption behaviors of CO2 over N2 between the imidazolate framework {[Co(HL)]} and 8′ can be ascribed to the fact that the reported electron-rich framework [Co(HL)] can induce speciﬁc interactions with the signiﬁcant quadrupole moment of CO2 to improve the CO2 adsorption capacity in comparison with N2;41 however, neutral host framework of 8′ cannot possess the characteristic. Fitting the BET equations to the N2 adsorption isotherm gives an estimated surface area of 245 m2/ g for the desolvated solid 8′. It is noteworthy that the isotherms of 8′ show stepwise and hysteresis proﬁles, which is similar to that of the doubly interpenetrated 3D porous SNU-9.42 And the sorption isotherms show hysteretic behaviors due to their interactions between guest molecules and small pore apertures of 4 Å diameter.43 Figure 10.

Crystal Growth & Design Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/cg401811c | Cryst. Growth Des. 2014, 14, 3727−3741 3739 ■CONCLUSION On the basis of a rationally designable difunctional organic linker combining carboxylate and 1H-imidazol-4-yl donor, two series of copper and cadmium complexes have successfully been constructed. The copper complexes 1−4 possess discrete molecule to 3D inﬁnite networks, while cadmium coordination polymers 5−8 exhibit diverse topology based on the tetrahedrally 4-connected nodes. The complexes 5, 6, 8, and 9 with high stability exhibit photoluminescence properties, while desolvated porous materials 4′, 5′, and 8′ exhibit adsorption properties for N2 and CO2. The results have demonstrated that the self-assembly of metal ions and 4-H2IBA containing difunctional organic linkers is an eﬀective moiety to generate unique architectures and topologies. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information X-ray crystallographic ﬁle in CIF format, selected bond lengths and angles (Table S1), hydrogen bonding data (Table S2), structure illustrations for complex 4 (Figure S1), TGA (Figure S2), PXRD data (Figure S3), and photoluminescence (Figure S4).
