Manuscript Synthesis and Crystal Structures of a Lanthanum(III) 1D Polymer and a Mixed-Ligand Cerium(III) Binuclear Complex Derived from Pyridine-2,6-dicaboxylic Acid Shahzad Sharif • Islam Ullah Khan • Onur S¸ahin • Saeed Ahmad • Orhan Bu¨yu¨kgu¨ngo¨r • Salamat Ali Received: 22 April 2012 / Accepted: 20 June 2012 / Published online: 8 July 2012  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 Abstract Lanthanum(III) and cerium(III) complexes of pyridine-2,6-dicaboxylic acid (H2Pydc) have been prepared and their crystal structures were determined by X-ray crystallography. The single crystal analysis reveals that the lanthanum(III) complex, 1 is polymeric consisting of {[La(Pydc)2(H2O)2]4H2O}n units linked through carbox- ylate oxygen atoms and exhibiting nine coordination number. Intermolecular O–HO hydrogen bonds produce R1 1(6), R4 4(16) and R4 4(20) rings, which lead to three- dimensional polymeric chains. The crystal structure of the cerium(III) complex, 2 [{Ce(Pydc)3}{Ce(Pydc)(HO– CH2CH2–OH)(H2O)3}6H2O)] shows that the complex is a mixed-ligand binuclear system in which one cerium coor- dinated to three Pydc molecules, while the other cerium is bound to one Pydc, one oxygen atom of the other Pydc, one ethylene glycol and three water molecules. Each of the two Ce(III) ions is nine coordinated. Intermolecular O–HO hydrogen bonds produce R2 2(8) and R2 2(20) rings, which lead to three-dimensional polymeric chains. The complexes were further investigated using elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis.

These mate- rials can successfully be developed by carefully tuning the choice of the ligands [7–10], counter ion [9–13], metal coordination geometry, solvent [11–14], metal to ligand ratio [11–13, 15, 16] and temperature [17]. Among these, the selection of organic ligands (spacers) and metal ions (nodes) are very important factors. Changes in symmetry of organic ligands; their ﬂexibility and length, and metal ions can generate a remarkable class of materials bearing diverse architectures and properties [18–20]. In addition, understanding and control of intermolecular interactions also play an important role in crystal engineering of these functional materials [21–23]. Polydentate organic ligands can act as a glue to inter- connect the metal centers and play an important role in dictating polymer framework topology [24–29]. Among these, pyridine-2,6-dicaboxylic acid owing to existence of rich N, O donors is of special interest, because they can construct more stable plane or inﬁnite chain polymers [30– 33]. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a lanthanum(III) 1D polymer, {[La(Pydc)2(H2O)2].4H2O}n (1) and a mixed- S. Sharif (&)  I. U.

In these complexes, H2Pydc adopts two kinds of coordination modes as shown Fig. 1, while La(III) and Ce(III) lie at the core of surrounding nine atoms and molecules of the accessible ligands as shown in Fig. 2. The complexes were also characterized by elemental, FTIR and thermogravi- metric analysis. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Measurements All reagents and solvents were commercially available and were used as received without further puriﬁcation. Ele- mental analysis for C, H and N was performed on Vario Micro Cube, Elementar, Germany. The IR spectra of the complexes were recorded on Perkin–Elmer FTIR 180 spectrophotometer using KBr pellets over the range 4,000–400 cm-1. Thermal analysis (25–1200 C) was carried out in a continuous nitrogen ﬂow, with a ramp rate of 10 C min-1 by using differential scanning calorimeter/ thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA/DSC), model SDT Q600, V8.3, TA Instruments, USA. 2.2 Crystal Structure Determination Suitable crystals of 1 and 2 were selected for data collec- tion which was performed on a Bruker KAPA APEX II CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochro- matic Mo Ka (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) radiation at 296 K. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS- 97 and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 using SHELXL-97 [34] from within the WINGX [35] suite of software. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic parameters. Water H atoms were located in a difference map and reﬁned subject to a DFIX restraint of O–H=0.83(2) A˚ . All other H atoms were located from different maps and then treated as riding atoms with C–H distances of 0.93–0.97 A˚ and O–H distances of 0.82 A˚ . Supramolecular and polyhedral analyses were performed and the diagrams were prepared with the aid of PLATON and CrystalMaker [36, 37]. Molecular diagrams were created using MERCURY [38]. Crystal data and parame- ters of the structural experiment are given in Table 1. 2.3 Synthesis 2.3.1 Synthesis of C14H19LaN2O14 To a solution of 84 mg (0.5 mmol) of pyridine-2,6-dri- caboxylic acid in 10 mL water was slowly added 5 mL mixture of water containing 54 mg (0.125 mmol) of lan- thanum nitrate hexahydrate.

The asymmetric unit of the polymeric complex consists of a La(III) ion, four non- coordinated water molecules, two Pydc anions and two coordinated water molecules. The La(III) ion is nine coordinated with tricapped trigonal prism geometry attained by two water molecules (O9 and O10), two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2) from two pyridine rings and ﬁve oxygen atoms (O2, O3, O5, O6ii and O7) from ﬁve carboxylic groups (Fig. 2a). The monomeric units are linked through the oxygen atom (O6ii) of a bridging car- boxylic group from a symmetrically related Pydc anion, to form a linear chain running parallel to the c axis, The monomeric units are linked through the oxygen atom (O6ii) of a bridging carboxylic group from a symmetrically related Pydc anion, to form a linear chain running parallel to the c axis, as shown in Fig. 4. The bond distances of La– O ranged between 2.4968(16) and 2.5917(15) A˚ and that of La–N bond lengths are 2.6620(16) and 2.6709(17) A˚ . The La–N and La–O bond distances are in the range observed for the similar complex reported in the literature [39, 40]. The bond angles of O–La–O ranged between 70.18(5) and 154.47(5). The selected bond lengths and bond angles are given in Table 2. The pyridine ring mean planes from are approximately planar, with maximum deviations of 0.0092(16) A˚ for N1 atom and 0.0163(15) A˚ for C11 atom, respectively. The molecules of the complex 1 are linked by inter- molecular hydrogen bonding, and we employed graph-set notation [41] to describe the patterns of hydrogen bonding.

A Polyhedral view of 1, showing the formation of a 1D layers parallel to the [001] direction 1168 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:1165–1173 123 Molecules of 1 are linked into sheets by a combination of O–HO hydrogen bonds (Table 3). Water atom O10 in the reference molecule at (x, y, z) acts as a hydrogen-bond donor, via H10A, to atom O5 in the molecule at (x, -y ? 1/2, z - 1/2), so forming a C(4)[R1 1(6)] chain of rings running parallel to the [001] direction. Similarly, water atom O10 in the reference molecule at (x, y, z) acts as a hydrogen-bond donor, via H10B, to atom O1 in the mol- ecule at (-x, y - 1/2, -z ? 1/2), so forming a C(6) chain running parallel to the [010] direction. The combination of the C(4) and C(6) chains along [011] generates a chain of edge-fused R4 4(16)R4 4(20) rings (Fig. 5). Strong intermo- lecular hydrogen bonds are observed between water mol- ecules and oxygen atoms of carboxyl groups and water molecules, with the OO distances range from 2.650(3) to 3.084(4) A˚ (Table 3). Also, the presence of water mole- cules of crystallization and coordinated water molecules make polymeric chains along the [100], [010] and [001] directions through O–HO hydrogen bonds forming 3D networks (Fig. 6). 3.2 Crystal Structure of 2 The molecular structure of 2 and atom-labeling scheme are shown in Fig. 7. The complex 2 consists of two indepen- dent binuclear units each consisting of two Ce(III) ions. In each binuclear unit cerium atom is nine coordinated in a tricapped trigonal prism mode. There are two kinds of coordination environments around the cerium atoms. One of the cerium atom (Ce1) is coordinated to three Pydc anions (through N2, N3 and N4 of the pyridine rings and six oxygen atoms O7, O10, O11, O13, O15 and O17 of six carboxylic groups) as shown in Fig. 2b, while the other cerium (Ce2) is bound to one Pydc (N1, O2 and O3), one oxygen atom of the other Pydc (O18), one ethylene glycol (O5 and O6) and three water molecules (O19, O20 and O21) as shown in Fig. 2c. The two cerium centers are bridged by the oxygen atom (O18) of the bridging Pydc ligands. The Ce1–O/N bond lengths are somewhat longer than those of Ce2–O/N bonds indicating a stringer binding of Ce1 compared to Ce2. The bond distances of Ce–O ranged between 2.319(2) and 2.660(3) A˚ and that of Ce–N ranged between 2.515(3) and 2.650(3) A˚ . The Ce–N bond lengths are slightly longer than the Ce–O distances. The bond distances are comparable to the similar reported complexes [42, 43]. The bond angles of O–Ce–O ranged between 61.30(9) and 154.71(9) and that of N–Ce–N ranged between 115.24(8) and 123.37(9). The selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 2. The pyridine ring mean planes from are approximately planar, with maximum deviations of 0.0017(25) A˚ for C1 atom, 0.0067(22) A˚ for N2 atom, 0.0066(23) A˚ for C21 atom and 0.0090(22) A˚ for C24 atom, respectively. Molecules of 2 are linked into sheets by a combination of O–HO hydrogen bonds (Table 3). Water atom O19 in the reference molecule at (x, y, z) acts as a hydrogen-bond donor, via H19B, to atom O2 in the molecule at (-x ? 2, -y ? 2, -z ? 1), so forming a centrosymmetric R2 2(8) Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and bond angles () for 1 and 2 Symmetry code iix, -y ? 1/2, z - 1/2 1 N1–La1 2.6709(17) O3–La1 2.5917(15) La1–O9 2.4968(16) N2–La1 2.6620(16) O5–La1 2.5728(14) La1–O6ii 2.5135(14) O2–La1 2.5228(15) O7–La1 2.5575(14) La1–O10 2.5235(16) N2–La1–N1 112.14(5) O2–La1–O10 98.65(6) O10–La1–O3 71.40(6) O9–La1–O2 80.92(6) O9–La1–O7 85.95(6) O2–La1–O5 75.92(5) O7–La1–N1 139.25(5) O2–La1–O7 154.47(5) O5–La1–O3 81.83(5) 2 O2–Ce1 2.489(2) O10–Ce2 2.368(2) N1–Ce1 2.650(3) O3–Ce1 2.660(3) O15–Ce2 2.376(2) N2–Ce2 2.518(2) O7–Ce2 2.319(2) O17–Ce2 2.379(2) N3–Ce2 2.515(3) Ce1–O6 2.540(3) O13–Ce2 2.348(2) N4–Ce2 2.522(3) Ce1–O20 2.460(3) O18–Ce1 2.454(2) O11–Ce2 2.348(2) Ce1–O5 2.608(3) Ce1–O19 2.509(3) Ce1–O21 2.527(2) O18–Ce1–O20 141.59(9) O19–Ce1–O3 152.43(9) O11–Ce2–O17 147.16(8) O18–Ce1–O2 75.15(8) O7–Ce2–O15 148.58(8) O11–Ce2–N2 78.28(8) O18–Ce1–O5 79.73(9) O13–Ce2–O15 86.07(9) O13–Ce2–N4 72.13(8) O2–Ce1–O19 68.82(8) O13–Ce2–O10 145.05(8) O17–Ce2–N3 135.19(9) O6–Ce1–O5 61.30(9) O6–Ce1–N1 143.47(10) O7–Ce2–O11 86.38(9) O2–Ce1–O3 121.01(8) O7–Ce2–N2 63.82(8) N3–Ce2–N2 123.37(9) J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:1165–1173 1169 123 ring centered at (1, 1, 1/2). Similarly, atom O6 in the ref- erence molecule at (x, y, z) acts as a hydrogen-bond donor, via H6, to atom O9 in the molecule at (-x ? 2, -y ? 1, -z ? 1), so forming a centrosymmetric R2 2(20) ring cen- tered at (1, 1/2, 1/2). Furthermore, strong hydrogen bonds are observed between water molecules and oxygen atoms of carboxyl groups and water molecules, with the OO distances range from 2.610(4) to 3.144(4) A˚ (Table 3).

Sharp m(C=O) bands at 1,634 and 1,633 cm-1 correspond to the asymmetric stretch, and 1,424–1,366 and 1,436–1,362 cm-1 correspond to the symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate groups. In the cerium com- plex, the stretching vibrations of CH2 group of ethylene glycol were also observed at 2,922 and 2,851 cm-1. The presence of m(C=O) at lower frequency relative to its characteristic values of about 1,684–1,721 cm-1 indicates, the ligand is deprotonated. TGA was carried out to study thermal stability of 1 and 2, is an important characteristics of functional materials [44–46]. The results of thermal analysis of the complexes are consistent with the proposed stoichiometry. The decomposition pattern of the lanthanum(III) com- plex is illustrated in Fig. 9. Thermal decomposition starts at about 60 C and is completed around 820 C. At the ﬁrst stage water is released, corresponding to the weight loss of about 17.9 % (calculated value 18.7 % for 2 coordinated and 4 non coordinated water molecules) between 90 and 160 C. At 250 C the polymer begins to decompose as the second weight loss of 49.8 % up to 810 results from the successive release of pydc (calculated value 48.9 %). The residual mass of 28.7 % corresponds to the formation of Fig. 5 Part of the crystal structure of 1 showing the formation of a chain edge-fused R4 4ð16ÞR4 4ð20Þ rings along [011] Fig. 7 View of the molecule of 2, showing the atom-numbering scheme Fig. 6 View of 3D network of 1, showing solvent ﬁlled channels J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:1165–1173 1171 123 lanthanum oxide (calculated weight loss 28.2 % (0.5 La2O3). A similar pattern of decomposition is also observed in the thermal analysis of cerium complex as shown in Fig. 10. The decomposition of the complex starts at about 70 C and occurs in four steps. At the ﬁrst stage water is released, corresponding to the weight loss of 14.2 % (cal- culated value 13.8 %) at 70–130 C. The next weight loss of 5.9 % (calculated value 5.3 %) is due to release of ethylene glycol molecule. At 260 C the dimer begins to decompose as the removal of Pydc takes place in two steps; the weight loss of about 52.4 % (calculated value 52.9 %) due to the removal of Pydc ligands takes place in the range of 260–420 C, while the second is lost in the range of 450–870 C. The residual mass of 27.5 % corresponds to the formation of cerium oxide (Ce2O3 calculated weight loss 27.9 %). 4 Conclusion The present report describes the crystal structures of two lanthanum(III) and cerium(III) complexes with pyridine- 2,6-dicarboxylic acid. The La(III) is a 1D chain and the mononuclear fragments are connected by strong hydrogen bonds to construct a 3D polymer. The mixed-ligand cer- ium(III) is a binuclear complex derived from Pydc and Fig. 9 TGA/DSC curves of 1 Fig. 10 TGA/DSC curves of 2 Fig. 8 View of 3D network of 2, showing solvent ﬁlled channels 1172 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:1165–1173 123 ethylene glycol as a co-ligand. In cerium(III), strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds are also observed, which leads to three-dimensional polymeric chains. The com- plexes show signiﬁcant thermal stability. In addition, the mixed-ligand approach as well as hydrogen bonding plays an important role to build supramolecular architectures. 5 Supplementary Material CCDC No. 769540 and 769541 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for compounds 1 and 2, can be obtained free of charge via http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/ conts/retrieving.html, or from the Cambridge Crystallo- graphic Data Centre, 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK; fax: (?44) 1223-336-033; or e-mail: deposit@ccdc. cam.ac.uk.
