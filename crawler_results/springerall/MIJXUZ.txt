Manuscript Eﬀect of Coordinating Solvents on Solution Speciation and the Crystallisation via ROP of a Triphos-Silver Coordination Cage Xingling Xu,1 Mark Nieuwenhuyzen,1 Jianyong Zhang,1 and Stuart L. James1,2 There is a general lack of understanding of how coordination polymers (metal-organic frameworks) form. Some insight can be gained from observations of formal ROP (ring- opening polymerisation) relationships between coordination polymers and their discrete sol- uble precursors. Most ROP examples reported previously have involved bidentate bridging ligands. Here we present an unusual example of a ROP relationship based on a tripodal ligand. In particular, 1,3,5-tris(diphenylphosphino)benzene (L1) is found to form a symmet- rical coordination cage of stoichiometry Ag3(L1)2 in solution in acetonitrile. This contrasts with previous observations in less-coordinating solvents in which higher nuclearity cages are also formed, and shows that the coordinating acetonitrile solvent reduces anion-templating eﬀects. On crystallization from acetonitrile a one-dimensional polymeric structure [Ag3(L1)2(NCCH3)(OTf)3]n is obtained. The structure is noteworthy in being a ROP isomer of the trinuclear cage observed in solution. The structure also exhibits solvent-ﬁlled channels (maximum diameter 6.1 A˚ ) but the material is not stable to desolvation. The structure of the polymer contrasts with that obtained from less-coordinating solvents, the latter being a stable hexagonal 2-dimensional structure with nanoporosity.

INTRODUCTION Coordination polymers, or metal-organic frame- works, have become intensely studied since the pioneering work by Robson showed that it was possible to prepare inﬁnite framework materials by using metal ions and organic ligands as building blocks [1]. Spectacular structures have since been prepared and impressive sorption properties observed by several groups, including those of Yaghi, Kitag- awa and Rosseinsky [2]. Whereas most research has employed pyridine- or carboxylate-based ligands, our approach has been to use bulky phosphines in the expectation of unusual structures, reactivities and insights [3]. One important aspect is that 31P NMR spectroscopy is very useful for studying the soluble precursors to coordination polymers. Simultaneously with Puddephatt et al. [4], we observed discrete soluble precursors which crystallised in polymeric form, and the discrete and polymeric structures were formally interrelated by ring-opening polymerisation ROP (Fig. 1) [3a]. These and other reports of coordination-ROP relationships (sometimes called ‘supramolecular isomerism’) [5], have focussed mainly on bidentate ligands. Therefore, in most cases the initial species is a cyclic structure, rather than a cage, and the products are normally linear coordina- tion polymers [6]. We have also previously discussed the intriguing ROP relationship between a two- dimensional chicken-wire polymer (D in Fig. 3) [3b] 1 Centre for the Theory and Application of Catalysis, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Queen’s University Bel- fast, David Keir Building, Stranmillis Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 5AG, UK. 2 To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The polymer was obtained using the benzene-cored tripodal triphosphine 1,3,5-tris(diphenylphosphi- no)benzene (L1), whereas the discrete bowls are observed using heterocycle-cored trisphosphines 2,4,6-tris(diphenylphosphino)triazine (L3) or 2,4,6- tris(diphenylphosphino)pyrimidine (L2) (see Fig. 2 for structures of these ligands) [3c]. The bowl-shaped aggregates are of further fundamental interest since they are based on partial polyhedra (i.e. they are unusual examples of polar self-assembled structures) and because they can be further connected into larger discrete aggregates (G in Fig. 3) [3d]. In addition, they can be capped with diﬀerent tripodal ligands to give mixed ligand coordination cages which are not based on uniform polyhedra (F in Fig. 3) [3e]. In this paper we report further on the chemistry of 1,3,5-tris(diphenylphosphino)benzene, L1, with regard to formation of discrete soluble precursors and coordination polymers. In particular, changing to the more strongly coordinating solvent acetonitrile reduces anion-templating eﬀects on the solution-state speciation, which aﬀects the nuclearity of the cage species formed. Crystallisation from this solution gives a 1-dimensional polymer which is formally related to the precursor cage by ROP (structures A and E in Fig. 3). 2. EXPERIMENTAL General: Reagents were purchased from Aldrich and used as supplied unless otherwise stated. L1 was prepared as previously described 3b. 31P NMR spectra were recorded at 121.5 MHz and 27C unless otherwise stated, and are referenced to external H3PO4 (aq) 85%. Polymer [Ag3(L1)2(CH3CN)(OTf)3]n: To a solu- tion of 1,3,5-tris(diphenylphosphino)benzene (L1; 21 mg, 0.033 mmol) in CH3CN (2 ml) was added a solution of silver triﬂuoromethanesulfonate (AgOTf; 12.9 mg, 0.050 mmol) in CH3CN (1 ml). Colourless block crystals were obtained after diﬀusion of ether vapour into the resulting solution 16 mg, 47%. Microanalysis after desolvation (calc.): C50.78 (51.43), H 3.17 (3.25). Solution state 31P NMR (CD3CN): d8:85 ppm, 1J(109Ag–31P) = 452 Hz. X-ray crystallographic data for [Ag3(L1)2(NC- CH3)(OTf)3] 2((CH3CH2)2O) were collected using a Bruker SMART diﬀractometer with graphite mono- chromated Mo-K a radiation. The crystal stability was monitored and there was no signiﬁcant decay (±1%). Data were collected at low temperature ca. 153 K. Omega\phi scans were employed for data collection and absorption, Lorentz and polarisation corrections were applied. The structure was solved [7, 8] by direct methods and ordered non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic atomic displacement parameters. Hydro- gen-atom positions were added and idealised posi- tions and a riding model with ﬁxed thermal parameters (Uij=1.2Ueq for the atom to which they are bonded (1.5 for CH3)), was used for subsequent reﬁnements.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Addition of two equivalents of L1 to three equivalents of silver triﬂate in acetonitrile resulted in a single symmetrical species according to 31P NMR spectroscopy. The spectrum (Figure 4) reveals the expected coupling of phosphorus to the two spin- active silver isotopes, 109Ag and 107Ag ( d ¼ 8:8 ppm, 1J(109Ag–31P)=452 Hz). This contrasts markedly with the situation when less coordinating solvents were used 3b. In particular, use of CDCl3–CH3NO2 mixtures results in a mixture of two, or three symmetrical species, depending on the concentration. These symmetrical species can only be rationalised as having polyhedral cage structures, such as trinuclear and hexanuclear cages A and B in Fig. 3. We have also previously found, when ﬂexible triphosphines Fig. 4. 31P NMR spectrum of the reaction between L1 and AgOTf in a 2:3 mole ratio in CD3CN.

Formation of the coordination polymer [Ag3(L1)2(NCCH3) (OTf)3] via coordination cage [Ag3(L1)2][OTf]3. These structures correspond to C and E in Figure 3. 434 Xu, Nieuwenhuyzen, Zhang, and James were used, that anions can have a critical templating eﬀect on the formation of stable coordination cages. This arises from the abilities of anions to coordinate simultaneously to several metal centres, which com- bined with their range of nucleophilicities and various geometries can stabilise diﬀerent cage structures. In the case of the system AgX+triphos {tri- phos = 1,1,1-tris(diphenylphosphinomethyl)ethane} for example, stable hexanuclear cages [Ag6(tri- phos)4(anion)4]2+ (analogous to B in Fig. 3, but based on triphos instead of L1) emerge instanta- neously from complex dynamic mixtures on addition of the appropriate templating anions. Such anions must combine suﬃcient nucleophilicity (i.e. oxoa- nions rather than ﬂuoroanions) with the ability to coordinate simultaneously to three metal centres on one face of the Ag6 octahedron (i.e. NO 3 rather than NO 2 ). Appropriate anions are therefore CF3SO 3 , NO 3 , ClO 4 and ROSO 3 , and inappropriate ones are BF 4 , SbF 6 and NO 2 . Coordinating solvents such as acetonitrile are expected to compete with anions for coordination at the metal centres, and so the tem- plating eﬀects of anions are expected to be lessened in such solvents. Electrospray mass spectrometry on the acetonitrile solution, with acetonitrile solution as the mobile phase, showed three signals at m/z=528, 886 and 1882, which correspond to the entropically favoured lowest nuclearity ‘cyclophane’ cage (A in Fig. 3) having zero, one or two triﬂates coordinated respectively, i.e. [Ag3(L1)2]3+, [Ag3(L1)2(OTf)]2+ and [Ag3(L1)2(OTf)2]+. These results contrast with the ES-MS results we previously obtained for the corre- sponding CHCl3/CH3NO2 solutions, which showed, in addition to those peaks seen in acetonitrile, a mixture of species including the higher-nuclearity cage [Ag6(L1)4(OTf)3]3+ (B in Fig. 3) and the bowl- shaped complex [Ag4(L1)3(OTf)]2+ (analogous to C in Fig. 3, but based on L1 instead of L2 or L3) 3b. The higher nuclearity species therefore seem to be a consequence of anion templating, which is strong in non-coordinating solvents, but weak in coordinating solvents. The possibility of forming a simple trinu- clear cage in acetonitrile is strengthened by the observation of analogous cages [Pt3L2Cl6] [9] and [Pd3L2Cl6] [10] which have been characterised by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Crystallisation from the acetonitrile solution occurred on diffusion of diethyl ether vapour into the solution and the structure as determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography is given in Figs. 6 and 7. It shows a polymeric structure of formula [Ag3(L1)2(NCCH3)(OTf)]n. The repeat unit of the polymer chain contains a 12-membered ring with two AgP2 units. A third, exocyclic, AgP2 linkage connects these rings together to propagate the chain. There is inversion symmetry about the centroid of the 12-membered ring. The two Ag centres in this ring have triﬂate anions coordinated in monodentate fashion (Ag...O distance=2.539 A˚ ). The Ag...Ag distance across the 12-membered ring is 5.02 A˚ , too long for an Ag...Ag interaction. The exocyclic Ag centre has a monodentate triﬂate (Ag...O=2.443 A˚ ) Fig. 6.

The overall conformation of the chain is sinusoidal, as can be seen from Fig. 7a–c. Interestingly, neighbouring sinusoidal chains pack ‘out of phase’ with each other which generates signiﬁcant solvent-ﬁlled cavities. These solvent-ﬁlled cavities propagate in the crystal- lographic a direction to form channels. These chan- nels are ﬁlled by a combination of water molecules, which occupy the central space, and by diethyl ether molecules which take up positions closer to the polymer chains. The eﬀect on the packing diagram of artiﬁcially removing the solvent molecules is shown in Fig. 7b and c. The maximum diameter of the channels is 8.504 A˚ (H64B...H64B) which gives 6.1 A˚ when the van der Waals radii of H (1.20 A˚ ) [11] are taken into account. Unlike the 2-dimensional honeycomb polymer obtained previously 3b, which has a stable nanoporous structure, this one-dimen- sional polymer collapses on solvent loss, as evidenced by rapid deterioration of the crystal transparency on removal from the crystallisation solvent. This lower stability is consistent with its lower dimensionality. The polymer is a formal ROP isomer of its precursor, the trinuclear cyclophane cage (Figure 5). 4. CONCLUSIONS The main ﬁndings of the current work are that: 1. Silver-phosphine polyhedral cages of diﬀerent nuclearity were obtained depending on the coordinating power of the solvent, which can be rationalised in terms of the coordinating solvent reducing anion templating. 2. We have observed formal ring-opening poly- merisation of a trinuclear cage which crystal- lises to give a linear coordination polymer. It is an unusual example of ROP in that it is based on a tripodal ligand and involves a cage rather than cyclic precursor. 3. The polymer has solvent-ﬁlled channels. REFERENCES 1. B. F.
