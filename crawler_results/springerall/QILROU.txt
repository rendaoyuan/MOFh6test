Complex 1 is a slightly spin-frustrated antiferromagnetic layer with sulfonate aggregated CuII 6 clusters periodically ex- tended by ditopic sulfonate linkers. 2 is a grid-based coplanar sheet with hydroxyl group bridged CuOCu linear-chain inter- linked by pairs of μ3-atr ligands, exhibiting strong antiferromagnetic interactions to lead to an S = 0 spin ground state at low temperature. In contrast, air-instable 3 has a ladder-like broad-ribbon structure constructed from triangular CuII 3 cores and cen- trosymmetric CuII 1 octahedra. Obviously, the variable CuII-ligand connectivity and the involving magnetic properties are sig- nificantly dominated by the cooperative and variable binding modes of the mixed sulfonate-atr ligands and bi-/tridentate bridging hydroxyl heterobridges. 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole, polynuclear metal cluster, magnetism, spin frustration 1 Introduction Magnetic metal-organic frameworks (MMOFs) constructed from different paramagnetic transition metal ions and effec- tive magnetic exchange mediators have always attracted intense interest due to their significance in interpretation of the underlying magneto-structural correlations [1] as well as their new developments and applications in quantum com- puting and information storage [2, 3]. In contrast to those popular one- to three-atom short bridges (O2, CN, N3  HCOO, C2O4 2, and so on) [4, 5], five-membered mono-heterocyclic triazole-type ligands have recently be- come one of promising magnetic mediators in their neutral and anionic forms due to their ability to aggregate multiple metal sites into dense clusters [6–10], a super- ex- change capacity reflected in unusual magnetic properties of their complexes [11], as well as their facile derivatizations to provide versatile bridging groups [12]. Up to now, lots of triazolate-based paramagnetic entities have been construct- ed by incorporating various types of auxiliary ligands and the first row transition metals with different spin quantum number and/or magnetic anisotropy, which have exhibited strong antiferromagnetic couplings [4, 5], canted and/or frustrated antiferromagnetism [13–15], as well as spin-crossover behavior [13–15]. More interestingly, the structure diversity, the symmetry, and the polymorphism of the magnetic systems can also be well tuned by the depro- tonation extent of the secondary carboxylate-containing coligands [16, 17], the kinds of the counter anions [18], as 466 Yang EC, et al. Sci China Chem April (2013) Vol.56 No.4 well as the supramolecular packing patterns [19], which can further modify the superexchange interactions between the spin carriers and result in different spin ground states. Herein, self-assembly reactions of heterocyclic 4-amino- 1,2,4-triazole (atr) and hydrated copper(II) sulphate were performed under controllable diffusion conditions. Our spe- cial interest focused on the cooperative or competitive binding behavior of the sulfonate group and atr ligands in the atr-based ternary system [20, 21]. As a result, three nov- el magnetic complexes with scarcely observed CuII 6 clus- ter-based undulated sheet for 1, linear CuII chain-based co- planar layer for 2, as well as ladder-like broad-ribbon for 3 were respectively obtained by varying structure-directing agents and metal-ligand ratios. Magnetically, an S = 1 spin ground state with a slight spin-frustration for 1 and an S = 0 spin ground state for 2 were respectively observed in the antiferromagnetic coupled CuII 6 cluster of 1 and in the linear CuOCu chain of 2. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and general methods All chemicals were commercially purchased (4-amino- 1,2,4-triazole, camphoric acid, 5-nitroisophthalic acid, and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid were from Acros and other analytical-grade reagents were from Tianjin chemical rea- gent factory) and used as received without further purifica- tion. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were carried out with a CE-440 (Leeman-Labs) analyzer. Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra (KBr pellets) were taken on an Avatar-370 (Nicolet) spectrometer in the range of 4000400 cm1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were per- formed on a Shimadzu simultaneous DTG-60A composi- tional analysis instrument from room temperature to 800 °C in N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min1. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were obtained from a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA for Cu Kα radiation ( = 1.5406 Å), with a scan speed of 0.1 sec/step and a step size of 0.01° in 2. The simulated PXRD patterns were calculated using single-crystal X-ray diffrac- tion data and processed by the free Mercury v1.4 program provided by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center. Magnetic susceptibilities were acquired on a Quantum De- sign SQUID MPMS-XL-7 magnetometer with polycrystal- line samples, in which the phase purity of the samples was determined by PXRD experiments. The magnetic suscepti- bility was corrected for the contribution of the gel capsule and for the core diamagnetism (using Pascal’s constants). 2.2 Synthesis of complexes 13 2.2.1 Synthesis of {[Cu6(atr)6(H2O)2(μ3-OH)2(SO4)5]·5.25H2O}n (1) An ethanol solution (8.0 mL) containing camphoric acid (19.8 mg, 0.1 mmol) and atr (16.8 mg, 0.2 mmol) was care- fully layered onto a buffer layer of ethyl acetate (2.0 mL) in a straight glass tube, below which an aqueous solution (8.0 mL) of CuSO4·5H2O (24.9 mg, 0.1 mmol) was placed.

Semiempirical multi-scan absorption corrections were applied by SADABS [22], and the program SAINT [23] was used for integration of the diffraction profiles. The structures were solved by direct Yang EC, et al. Sci China Chem April (2013) Vol.56 No.4 467 methods and refined with the full-matrix least-squares tech- nique using the SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 programs [24, 25]. Non-H atoms were located by difference Fourier maps and subjected to anisotropic refinement. H atom was added according to theoretical models. The coordinated water molecule (O24) in 1 is varied between two sym- metry-related positions with the equal site occupancy. The site occupancy of lattice water molecule (O30) in 1 is 0.25. The crystal structures for complexes 13 have been depos- ited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre and allocated the deposition numbers CCDC 872261, 872262, and 877949. Detailed crystallographic data were summa- rized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles were given in Tables 24, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Syntheses and IR spectra In the presence of camphoric acid, 5-nitroisophthalic acid and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, diffusion reactions of CuSO4·5H2O and atr at room temperature afforded green (for 1) and blue block-shaped crystals (for 2 and 3) by var- ying the metal-to-ligand ratios. Interestingly, rather than serving as a coligand to competitively coordinate with the CuII ions, the different organic acids with functional car- boxylate group in 13 prefer to act as structure-directing agents to facilitate the crystallization of the target complex- es. In the absence of the structure-directing agent, unknown amorphous powder was generated. With the decrease of the amount of the structure-directing agent, only small crystals of 1−3 could be obtained, which were unsuitable for the single-crystal X-ray diffractions. Such synthetic strategy was frequently employed in the triazolate-based self- assembly systems [6]. Additionally, as compared to air-stable 1 and 2, complex 3 is highly air-sensitive and can quickly lose the crystalline form out of the mother liquor. Therefore, only the crystal structure and IR spectrum of 3 were presented herein. Multiple absorptions beyond 3232 cm1 in the IR spectra of 1–3 indicate the OH and NH stretching vibrations for hydroxyl and amino groups, confirming the presence of water and atr ligand [26]. The characteristic bands for the asymmetric stretching (ν3) and bending (ν4) vibrations of the sulfonate group are observed at ca. 1100 and 610 cm1. In- terestingly, the ν3 mode in 1 and 3 splits into four bands located at 1130, 1077, 1020, and 958 cm1 for 1 and 1090, 1047, 1004, and 973 cm1 for 3. The ν4 vibration splits into two bands at 642 and 619 cm1 for 1, and 681 and 618 cm1 for 3. In contrast, both the ν3 and ν4 bands in 2 appear as doublets at 1120 and 1080 cm1 as well as at 616 and 542 cm1, respectively. The spectrum of free sulfonate ion with a high symmetry of Td consists of two absorption bands at Table 1 Crystal data and structure refinement parameters for 1–3 1 2 3 Formula C12H40.5Cu6N24O29.25S5 Cu2C4H16N8O9S Cu3.5C6H21N12O17S3 Fw 1530.72 479.39 851.92 Crystal system monoclinic monoclinic triclinic Space group P21/c P21 P 1 a (Å) 10.7689(5) 6.2086(5) 8.380(3) b (Å) 16.2241(7) 17.8205(13) 11.188(4) c (Å) 26.4529(11) 6.7436(5) 14.137(5) α (º) 90 90 110.125(6) β (º) 98.2040(10) 102.9200(10) 96.370(6)  (º) 90 90 92.405(6) V (Å3) 4574.4(3) 727.22(3) 1232.3(8) Z 4 2 2 Dc (g cm3) 2.223 2.189 2.296  (mm1) 3.089 3.134 3.343 F (000) 3074 484 853 Limiting indices –10  h  12 –19  k  13 –31  l  31 –7  h  5 –21  k  20 –8  l  7 –9  h  9 –12  k  13 –16  l  11 Data / restraints / params 8065 / 20 / 698 2386 / 7 / 217 4309 / 3 / 376 Rint 0.0322 0.0232 0.0447 GoF on F2 1.026 1.040 1.025 R1 a), wR2 b) [I >2σ(I)] 0.0311, 0.0654 0.0260, 0.0673 0.0488, 0.0948 R1, wR2 [all data] 0.0484, 0.0714 0.0272, 0.0684 0.0854, 0.1114 Residuals (eÅ–3) 0.817, –0.436 0.463, –0.514 0.708, −0.682 a) R1 = Σ(||Fo||Fc||)/Σ|Fo|; b) wR2 = [Σw(|Fo|2|Fc|2)2/Σw(Fo 2)2]1/2. 468 Yang EC, et al. Sci China Chem April (2013) Vol.56 No.4 ca. 1104 cm1 for ν3 and at ca. 614 cm1 for ν4 [27]. There- fore, the split of absorptions suggests the differences on the binding modes and the local symmetry of the sulfonate group in 1–3 [20, 21, 27]. The IR results are thus in good agreement with those from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. 3.2 Crystal structures 3.2.1 {[Cu6(atr)6(H2O)2(μ3-OH)2(SO4)5]·5.25H2O}n (1) Complex 1 is a novel CuII 6 cluster-based two-dimensional (2D) layer extended by bidentate bridging sulfonate con- nectors. There are six crystallographically independent CuII ions, six neutral -N1, N2-atr ligands, five sulfonate anions in three different binding modes, two 3-OH groups, two bound and 5.25 lattice water molecules in the asymmetric unit of 1. As shown in Figure 1(a), three CuII atoms (Cu1, Cu2, and Cu6) are in elongated octahedra surrounded by a N2O4 donor set. The N donors of the octahedral CuII ions are from two isolated triazolyl groups and the four O atoms belong to μ3-OH group and sulfonate anions (for Cu1 and Cu2), or terminal water molecules (for Cu6). The CuO and CuN separations fall in the normal range (see Table 2) and are comparable with the CuII-containing complexes with triazolate ligands [79]. In contrast, the other three CuII sites (Cu3, Cu4, and Cu5) are in the N2O3 donor sets with two separate triazolyl N donors, one sulfonate O and one μ3-OH in the basal plane and the other sulfonate O atom in the api- cal position, displaying distorted square-pyramidal coordi- nation polyhedra with  = 0.14, 0.21, and 0.06 for Cu3, Cu4, and Cu5, respectively [28]. The Addison parameter is de- fined as an index of trigonality [28]. The apical CuOsulfonate separations are 0.2150.460 Å longer than those of Cu Ohydroxyl and CuN in the basal plane (see Table 2). A pair of tridentate 3-OH groups (O21 and O22, Figure 1(a)) aggregate six separate CuII ions into two separately triangular CuII 3 cores with the intermetallic distances of 3.3707(1), 3.3614(1), and 3.4075(1) Å for Cu1Cu5, Cu5Cu6, and Cu6Cu1, as well as 3.4180(1), 3.3222(1), and 3.3922(1) Å for Cu2Cu3, Cu3Cu4, and Cu4Cu2. Each edge of the two CuII 3 triangles is further enhanced by six -N1,N2-atr ligands. Furthermore, two individual 4-SO4 2 anions labeled with S3 and S5 join the two adja- cent CuII 3 cores together through a η1: η1: η2: μ4, 4. 2110 mode to lead to a scarcely observed CuII 6 cluster. The Cu1Cu2 separation by the 4-SO4 2 group within the CuII 6 cluster is 3.52691 Å, slightly longer than those of ion-pairs in the CuII 3 cores. As shown in Figure 1b, each CuII 6 cluster in 1 is periodi- cally extended by two pairs of crystallographically unique -SO4 2 anions denoted by S2 and S4 to generate an undu- lated coordination layer. The inter-cluster intermetallic sep- arations are 5.744 and 5.664 Å for Cu2Cu5 and Cu1Cu3, considerable longer than those within the CuII 6 cluster and are expected to transmit weak magnetic interactions. Thus, five unique sulfonate anions in 1 play three different roles: to complete the metal coordination sphere by the terminally unidentate fashion, to form the unusual CuII 6 cluster by the 4-mode, as well as to extend the hexanuclear clusters into 2D layer by bidentate bridging mode. Additionally, inter- layer OHO and NHN hydrogen-bonding interactions between the coordinated water molecule and sulfonate group as well as between the amino group and triazolyl moiety of atr ligands assemble the adjacent layers into a 3D supramolecular network (Table S1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). 3.2.2 {[Cu2(atr)2(OH)2(SO4)]·3H2O}n (2) Complex 2 exhibits a coplanar 2D layer with hydroxyl groups extended linear CuOCu chains interlinked by pairs of neutral μ3-atr ligands. As shown in Figure 2(a), the Cu1 site adopts a distorted octahedral coordination geome- try surrounded by four N atoms from triazolyl or amino group of four individual atr ligands and two O donors from two crystallographically unique μ-OH groups. The axial CuNamino separations are considerable longer than those in the equatorial plane (see Table 3). In contrast, the coordina- tion sphere of Cu2 ion is defined by two separate triazolyl N and three O donors from two bridging hydroxyl groups and one terminal sulfonate anion, adopting a slightly pseudo- Figure 1 (a) Local coordination environments of CuII ions in 1 (H atoms were omitted for clarity.

Furthermore, these parallel chains are further interconnected by pairs of face-to-face μ3-atr ligands, resulting in a coplanar 2D layer (Figure 2(b)). Obviously different from the bidentate bridg- ing atr ligand in 1, the atr linker in 2 presents two heterocy- clic and one exocyclic amino group N donors to coordinate with CuII ion in a tridentate mode. To the best of our knowledge, such a tridentate binding mode of atr ligand has been infrequently observed in the atr-based metal complex- es [29]. The interchain CuIICuII distances by μ3-atr ligand is 6.2086(5) and 6.3798(4) Å for Cu1Cu1 and Cu1Cu2, considerable longer than that extended by -OH groups within the linear chain. The coplanar sheets of 2 are further built into a 3D supramolecular architecture through the NHO hydrogen-bonding interactions produced by exo- cyclic amino group of atr ligand and terminal sulfonate an- ion (Table S1 and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). 3.2.3 {[Cu7(atr)6(H2O)6(μ3-OH)2(SO4)6]·2H2O}n (3) Complex 3 is a ladder-like broad-ribbon consisting of tri- angular CuII 3 clusters and centrosymmetric CuII 1 octahedra. The asymmetric unit of 3 contains three and a half CuII at- oms with octahedral and square-pyramidal coordination geometries, three neutral -atr bridging ligands, one μ3-OH group, three sulfonate anions in terminally monodentate, bridging bidentate and unusual quadridentate modes, and four water molecules (three of which are coordinated and the last one is lattice water molecule). Located at an inver- sion center, the Cu1 atom is six-coordinated by an O6 donor set from two sulfonate groups and four aqua ligands, dis- playing an elongated octahedron with equatorial CuOwater/ CuOsulfonate bond lengths considerable shorter than those of axial CuOwater distances (Figure 3(a) and Table 4). Octa- hedral Cu3 site is in a general position and surrounded by a N2O4 donor set from two separate atr ligands, two sulfonate anions, one μ3-OH, and one coordinated water molecule. In contrast, the other two independent CuII ions in 3 are in the distorted square-pyramidal coordination octahedra with  = 0.30 and 0.08 for Cu2 and Cu4, respectively. The basal planes of the both CuII ions are formed by N2O2 donors Yang EC, et al.

Two centrosymmetric CuII 3 cores are then connected with the elongated Cu1 octahedron by a pair of μ4-sulfonate homo- bridges along the crystallographic b-axis to lead to a CuII 7 subunit, which is further expanded by pairs of μ-SO4 2 ani- ons running along the crystallographic a-direction. As a result, an infinite 1D broad-ribbon is generated in crystallo- graphic ab plane, as shown in Figure 3(b). These separated ribbons of 3 are further stacked into a 3D supramolecular network by extensively non-covalent N–HO, O–HO and N–HN interactions produced by the amino group of atr ligand, coordinated water molecule and sulfonate anions (Table S1 and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). 3.3 XPRD and TGA analyses of 1 and 2 TG curve (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) of 1 reveals two separate weight-loss processes attributable to the removal of lattice and coordinated water molecules be- tween 55 °C and 107 °C (obsd. 7.2%, calcd. 8.5%) and the decomposition of the layered structure between 235 °C and 440 °C. In contrast, complex 2 exhibits only one continuous weight-loss stage from room temperature to 720 °C for the release of free water molecules and the collapse of the polymeric layer. The final products of the two complexes are calculated to be CuO (obsd. 30.3%, calcd. 31.2% for 1; obsd. 31.7%, calcd. 33.2% for 2). PXRD experiments have been carried out for 1 and 2 to confirm their crystalline phase-purity. The experimental and computer-simulated PXRD patterns of the two bulk samples (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) are in a good agreement with each other, indicating the phase purity of the as-synthesized products. 3.4 Magnetic properties of 1 and 2 Variable-temperature (2.0–300 K) magnetic susceptibilities of the polycrystalline samples of 1 and 2 were measured under an applied field of 2 kOe. As shown in Figure 4, the observed χMT value per CuII 6 cluster of 1 is 1.79 cm3 K mol–1 at 300 K, much lower than the spin-only value (2.25 cm3 K mol–1) expected for six magnetically uncoupled CuII ions with S = 1/2 and g = 2.0. Upon cooling, the χMT prod- uct of 1 steadily decreases to reach the value of 0.80 and 0.49 cm3 K mol–1 at 50 and 2.0 K, respectively. The χMT of 1 at 50 K is close to the spin-only value (0.75 cm3 K mol–1) for two non-interacting S = 1/2 spin carriers, indicating that the overall antiferromagnetic couplings between the CuII ions in 1 lead to an S = 1 spin ground state at low tempera- ture. The magnetization (M) of 1 at 2.0 K shows a continu- ous increase with the increasing field (Figure 5). At 70 kOe, the magnetization of 1 is 1.56 Nβ, considerable lower than the saturation value (2.00 Nβ) for an S = 1 spin ground state at high field. Herein, the lowered experimental values of χMT and M for 1 than the theoretical ones for an S = 1 spin ground state can be significantly due to the slight spin-frustration occurred in the double-triangular magnetic units. Structurally, the magnetic couplings of 1 are essentially dominated by the mixed magnetic bridges of μ3-OH, μ-N1,N2-atr and single-atom O bridge of sulfonate anion in the local CuII 6 cluster, because the inter-cluster CuII···CuII separations are much farther than those within the CuII 6 cluster. The three CuII ions within the CuII 3 triangles are almost magnetically equivalent; the superexchange path- ways of 1 can be thus simplified into a 2-J model (Figure 4 inset). The magnetic data over 50–300 K can be successful- ly fitted with the spin Hamiltonian equation H = –2J1(S2·S3 + S2·S4 + S3·S4 + S1·S5 + S1·S6 + S5·S6) – 2J2(S1·S2) and molecule-field approximation by MAGPACK program [30]. The obtained parameters were g = 2.07, J1 = – 67.7 cm–1, J2 = – 9.3 cm–1, and zJ′ = –3.2 cm–1 and with R = 8.2  104, where R is the agreement factor defined as Σ[(χMT)obsd– (χMT)calcd]2/Σ[(χMT)obsd]2. The stronger antiferromagnetic coupling of J1 than J2 is due to the relatively favorable spa- tial-orientation of the μ-N1,N2-atr and μ3-OH toward the Figure 4 Temperature dependence of χMT for 1 and 2. The solid lines represent the best fits indicated in the text. Inset: Superexchange pathways within the CuII 6 cluster of 1 and the linear CuII chain of 2. Yang EC, et al. Sci China Chem April (2013) Vol.56 No.4 473 spin carriers. The two mediators are located in the basal planes of CuII ions with a dense d electron density, which can produce a good magnetic orbital overlap and contribute to stronger antiferromagnetic interaction. In contrast, weak magnetic orbital overlap of the both CuII ions occurs through pairs of apical single-atom O bridge of sulfonate with a specific bond angle of Cu–O–Cu (105.01(11)º), which results in a weak antiferromagnetic coupling (J2). Additionally, the small negative value of zJ′ should be as- cribed to the weak inter-cluster antiferromagnetic interac- tions transmitted by μ-SO4 2 anion and/or hydrogen-bonding pathways. The χMT value per CuII ion of 2 is 0.15 cm3 K mol–1 at 300 K (Figure 4), much lower than the expected value (0.375 cm3 K mol–1) for one magnetically isolated CuII ion with S = 1/2 and g = 2.0. As the temperature decreases, the χMT product of 2 continuously decreases and reaches a val- ue of 0.003 cm3 K mol–1 at 2.0 K, suggesting that the strong antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions in the 2D layer of 2 essentially lead to an S = 0 spin ground state at low temperature. Such magnetic behavior can be further confirmed by the nearly zero magnetization of 2 even at 70 kOe (Figure 5). From a viewpoint of the magnetostructural relationship, complex 2 can be treated as a 1D magnetic chain model with the equal spaced CuII ions. Thus the mag- netic data can be treated by the spin Hamiltonian i i 1 1 A A 1 n i H J S S       (1) and molecule field approximation (2) over the whole temperature range [31]. 2 2 2 chain 2 3 0.25 0.074975 0.075235 1.0 0.9931 0.172135 0.757825 Ng x x kT x x x         (1) with x = |J | /kT 2 2 M chain chain /[1 ( ' / )] zJ Ng       (2) The best-fit parameters were g = 2.06, J = –187.4 cm1, and zJ′ = –3.2 cm1 with R = 3.1  104.

In contrast, the zJ′ value should be at- tributable to the weak interchain antiferromagnetic interac- tions mediated by the two three-atom –NCN– pathways of atr ligands. 4 Conclusions Three interesting coordination polymers with novel CuII 6 cluster, linear –CuOCu– chain and triangular CuII 3 core are constructed from the hydrated copper(II) sulphate and 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole by changing the metal-to-ligand ra- tios and structure-directing agents. Their different crystal- line structures are more significantly dominated by the var- iable binding modes of sulfonate group, which together with the cyclic triazole mediator and bridging hydroxyl group can cooperatively influence the overall antiferromagnetic behavior of the resulting complexes. Further work on the exploration of the strong susceptibility and applicable mag- netic materials with cooperative triazolate and sulfonate mediators is in progress.
