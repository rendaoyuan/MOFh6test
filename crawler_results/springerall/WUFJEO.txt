Manuscript Syntheses, Crystal Structure, and Luminescence Properties of Three Metal–Organic Compounds Bearing Diverse Dimensionalities Based on Mixed N- and O-Donor Organic Ligands Yongzheng Zhang • Xiuling Zhang • Baoyong Zhu • Yu’e Qiu • Zaiwu Yuan Received: 2 October 2014 / Accepted: 15 November 2014 / Published online: 25 November 2014  Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014 Abstract Three new MOFs, namely [Ni(pip)(H2O)2] (1), [Ba(pip)(H2O)] (2), [Zn(pip)] (3), based on 6-(3-pyri- dyl)isophthalic acid (H2pip) were obtained and character- ized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analyses, PXRD, IR and TGA. By adjusting the reaction solvent, temperature and selecting different metal centers, compounds 1 and 2 possess 1D and 2D network, respec- tively, compound 3 show a 3D network containing a pad- dlewheel secondary building unit [SBU, Zn2(COO)4] with the Schla¨ﬂi symbol (462)2(4261083). The structural dif- ferences among compounds 1–3 exhibit the backbone of such mixed N- and O-donor atoms organic ligands can be used to construct diverse dimensional MOFs by adjusting the reaction environment. Furthermore, the luminescence properties of compounds 2 and 3 were investigated, and both of them exhibit intense ﬂuorescent emissions in the solid state at room temperature. Keywords Metal–organic frameworks  Synthesis  Crystal structure  Luminescence 1 Introduction Considerable attention has been given to control the struc- tures of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in the past decade because of their enormous diverse structures and great potential applications in gas storage, magnetism, luminescence and so on [1–9]. The variety of coordination interactions between metal ions/clusters and organic ligands lead to inﬁnite structures and interesting properties of MOFs. In spite of the great progress has been achieved, the predicted and controlled synthesis of MOFs are still a major challenge at present because there are many factors which can affect the self-assembly of frameworks and ﬁnal structures of MOFs, such as ligand structures, reaction solvents, temper- atures, bridging auxiliary ligands and so on [10–16]. Among these factors, the selection of organic ligands and metal cations is an important approach to construct MOFs. After all, the nature of the metal centers and organic ligands are the crucial components for construction of MOFs. While the coordination number and geometry of metal centers are relatively ﬁxed, organic ligands acting as bridging linkers play the essential role [17]. In this work, 6-(3-pyridyl)isophthalic acid (H2pip) was selected as ligand, three new MOFs were obtained under solvothermal conditions, namely, [Ni(pip)(H2O)2] (1), [Ba(pip)(H2O)] (2), [Zn(pip)] (3). Herein, we report on their synthesis, crystal structures, and luminescence properties. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Measurements All commercially available chemicals and solvents are of reagent grade and were used as received without further Y.

The IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet IR200 FT-IR spectrometer as KBr pellets (4,000–400 cm-1). The elemental analysis for C, H and N were performed on a elementar vario micro cube analyzer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a SHIMADZU DTG-60 thermo analyzer under nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 C min-1 from room temperature to 800 C. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on a SHIMADZU XRD-6000 X-ray dif- fractometer using Cu Ka radiation (k = 0.1542 nm), in which the X-ray tube was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA at room temperature. 2.1.1 X-ray crystallography Diffraction intensity data of the single crystals of com- pound 1 was collected on a Bruker SMART APEXII CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromated Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) by using a x-scan mode. Empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS programs [18]. All the structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 using the program SHEXL 97 [19]. The single suite WINGX was used as an integrated system for all the crystallographic programs [20]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were located by geometrically calculations, and their positions and thermal parameters were ﬁxed during the structure reﬁnement. The crystallographic data are sum- marized in Table 1. The data of relevant bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. For compound 3, the volume fractions of disordered solvent in the pores could not be modelled in terms of atomic sites and were treated using the SQUEEZE routine in the PLATON software package [21]. CCDC-1025414 (1), 1025412 (2) and 965687 (3) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. 2.1.2 Synthesis of [Ni(pip)(H2O)2] (1) The hydrothermal reaction of NiCl26H2O (0.0714 g, 0.3 mmol), 6-(3-pyridyl) isophthalic acid (H2pip) (0.0243 g, 0.1 mmol), imidazole (0.0068 g, 0.1 mmol) and distilled water (5 ml) was heated to 160 C for 96 h in a 25 ml stainless steel reactor with a Teﬂon liner.

In compound 1, Ni(II) atom is coordinated by three O atoms of carboxylate from two pip2- ligands, one N atom of pyridyl from pip2- ligand and two O atoms from water molecules to form an octahedron geometry (Fig. 1). The Ni–O bond distances are in the range of 2.034(2)– 2.1370(16) A˚ , and the Ni–N bond distance is 2.074(2) A˚ . The bond angles between the donor atoms around the Zn(II) center range from 61.88(6) to 177.20(9) (Table 2). Ni(II) centers are connected by pip2- anions in a l2-g1:g1/ l1-g1:g0 coordination mode (Scheme 1a) into one-dimen- sional (1D) propagating chain along c axis (Fig. 2a, b). These chains are packed together via O–HO hydrogen bonds (Table 3) between the O–H groups from coordinated water molecules and O atoms from carboxylates of pip2- anions into 3D supramolecular structures (Fig. 2c). 3.1.2 [Ba(pip)(H2O)] (2) Single-crystal structure analysis reveals that compound 2 crystallized in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c. In compound 2, the Ba atom is eight-coordinated by eight O atoms of which seven from different pip2- ligands and one atom from water molecule (Fig. 3). The Ba–O bond dis- tances are in the range of 2.6685(17)–2.9722(16)A˚ . The bond angles between the donor atoms around the Ba(II) center range from 44.77(5) to 159.68(5) (Table 2). The pip2- anions connect Ba(II) ions in a l4-g2:g2/l3-g2:g1 coordination mode (Scheme 1b) to form a 2D layer parallel to (100) plane (Fig. 4a, b). As a result, this 2D layers are stacked together in a AAA sequence via intermolecular O–HN hydrogen bonds between the O–H groups from coordinated water molecules and uncoordinated pyridyl N atoms of pip2- ligands into 3D supramolecular structures (Fig. 4c). 3.1.3 [Zn(pip)] (3) Single-crystal structure analysis reveals that compound 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c. In compound 3, the pip2- anions connect Zn(II) ions in a l2-g1:g1/l2-g1:g1 coordination mode (Scheme 1c). As shown in Fig. 5, there exists only one crystallographic indepen- dent Zn(II) center which is coordinated by four O atoms of carboxylate from four pip2- ligands and one N atom of pyridyl from pip2- ligand to form a pyramidal geometry.

The axial sites of such paddlewheel SBUs are occu- pied by the N atoms of pyridyl from pip2- ligands with Zn– N bond length being 2.0347(15)A˚ . The ZnZn distance is 2.9644(12)A˚ . In compound 3, each SBU links to six pip2- ligands, and each pip2- ligand binds three SBUs to form an irregular long and narrow quadrilateral 1D channel alone a axis (Fig. 7). The approximate dimensions of channels are only 0.4 9 8.6 A˚ (attributed to the size of pip2- and the coordination mode of compound). The measuring of dimensions takes into account the van der Waals radii/ (atom to atom distances). Taking the organic ligand and the SBU as 3-connected and 6-connected nodes respectively, the overall structure could be described as an inﬁnite 3D (3,6)-connected binodal [Schla¨ﬂi symbol (462)2(4261083)] (Fig. 8) topological network.

The TGA curve of compound 1 displayed two steps weight loss, the ﬁrst weight loss of 10.9 % from 190 to 275 C corresponds to loss of coordination water molecules (calcd. 10.7 %), leaving net remains stable beyond 350 C and beginning to decompose at 370 C. For compound 2, the observed weight loss (4.6 %) in the temperature range of 35–156 C is in excellent agreement with the loss of the coordination water molecules in the crystal structure (calcd. 4.5 %), then the framework of 2 is stable up to 550 C, followed by the compound starting to decompose. As the compound 3 shown by the TGA curve (Fig. 9), the ﬁrst weight loss of 3 attributed to loss of the disordered solvent molecules in channels is 1.5 % from 50 to 130 C. Left frameworks can be stable up to 330 C. Simulated and experimental PXRD patterns of com- pounds 1–3 are shown in Fig. 10a–c. The patterns from the as-synthesized bulk products approximately match those in the simulated ones generated from single-crystal diffrac- tion data, which conﬁrms the phase purity of the as-syn- thesized bulk products. 3.3 Luminescent Properties Organic–inorganic coordination polymers, especially those with d10 metal centers, have been found to exhibit excellent luminescence properties and posses great potential appli- cations as ﬂuorescent-emitting materials [23–28]. Fluo- rescent properties of compounds 2, 3, and H2pip ligand were investigated in the solid state at room temperature and the emission spectra are depicted in Fig. 11. Upon excita- tion at 335 nm, compounds show almost symmetrical emission bands at 406 and 381 nm, respectively, while free H2pip ligand exhibits an relatively broad band at 423 nm Fig. 5 Coordination environment of the Zn(II) in compound 3 (all H atoms omitted for clarity).

In comparison with the free ligand, blue shifts of 17 and 42 nm occur in the maximum emission peaks in compounds 2 and 3. The luminescence of these two compounds should be ascribed as the p*–p transitions and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) [29]. Incor- poration of metal center effectively increases the rigidity of the ligand and reduces the loss of energy by radiation-less decay or vibrational motion [28, 30], thus, the blue shift and enhanced luminescence intensities of the two com- pounds were observed. 4 Conclusions Three MOFs with structural diversities based on 6-(3- pyridyl) isophthalic acid (H2pip) have been synthesized by adjusting the reaction solvent, temperature and selecting different metal centers. The reaction solvent and tempera- ture play important roles in crystal growth, if any compo- sition of the co-solvent is absent in the mixture, the crystals of compounds 2 and 3 will not be obtained, meanwhile the reaction temperature has a signiﬁcant impact on the quality of the obtained crystals. Moreover, compared to the three compounds, the structural diversities show the versatile Fig. 7 a Polyhedral views of the quadrilateral 1D channels forming by SBUs and pip2- in 3, b space-ﬁlling view of 1D channels in compound 3 along a axis (Color ﬁgure online) Fig. 8 Schematic representation of the (3,6) topological net; the pink balls represent six-connected Zn2 nodes, and green balls represent the three-connected ligand pip2- (Color ﬁgure online) Fig. 9 The TGA curves of compounds (Color ﬁgure online) 642 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2015) 25:635–644 123 coordination modes of the pip2- anions, as well as the nature of the metal cations play an important role in modulating the formation of structures. Compound 3 pre- sents a rarely paddlewheel secondary building unit [SBU, Zn2(COO)4] with the Schla¨ﬂi symbol (462)2(4261083). In addition, the compounds containing Ba(II) and Zn(II) ions exhibit strong luminescent properties in the solid state at room temperature.
