Keywords Coordination polymer of Ag(I)  Thiodiglycolic acid  Ag–Ag bond  Photoluminescence 1 Introduction The design and synthesis of coordination polymers (CPs) remains an area of interest, due to their potential applications in the frontier areas of adsorption [1], catalysis [2] ion- exchange [3] and optical materials [4]. Thiodiglycolic acid (tdgaH2) has received increasing attention as a ligand in this domain because of its ﬁve potential donor centers i.e., four carboxylate oxygen and a thioether group. In last few years tdgaH2 has been applied to the synthesis of diverse coordi- nation polymers with different kind metal ions; e.g., main group, transition and lanthanoids [5–15]. The binding modes of the thiodiglycolic ion ligand (tdga2-) are shown in Scheme 1. The tridentate coordination mode of the ligand is observed for the metal ions like Mg(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), V(IV) [7, 11, 14, 15] (Scheme 1a). Alarco´n-Payer et al. reported Cu(II) coordination polymer of the title ligand with a head-to-tail bridge (Scheme 1b) (without Cu–S bond) and apical conformation mode of the ligand (Scheme 1i) [9] whereas lanthanoid metal ions exhibit an intriguing coordi- nation mode (Scheme 1c–g) [16]. Wu et al. reported coor- dination mode in a Zn(II) complex (Scheme 1i) [12]. Ca(II), Ba(II) and Sr(II) ions can be coordinated to tdga2- where four metal ions are bonded simultaneously (Scheme 1j, k) [5, 6]. Hence, it is evident that the tdga2- ligand can bonds a maximum of six metals simultaneously. No attempt has been made to date to explore the binding behavior of the tdga2- ligand with Ag(I). In this work we report the synthesis, X-ray structure and thermogravimetric study of a novel coordina- tion polymer of silver(I), the [Ag2(tdga)]n complex, where tdga2- offers a new type of bonding mode by coordinating eight Ag(I) centers simultaneously, which leads to a 3D coordination polymer with a ligand-supported weak Ag–Ag bond. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Instrumentation Silver nitrate (AgNO3) and tdgaH2 were purchased from MERCK and SIGMA-ALDRICH Inc., respectively. All the chemicals were used without further puriﬁcation. The IR spectrum of 1 was recorded from 4000 to 400 cm-1 with a JASCO FT/IR-6200 applying the ATR technique. Ele- mental analyses (C, H, N) were carried out on a 240C M. Bera  A. Rana  D. S. Chowdhuri  D. Hazari  S. K. Jana  S.

The ﬂuorescence spectra of the ligand and the complex were recorded in the solid state at room temperature using a HITACHI F-7000 spectroﬂuorimeter. 2.2 Synthesis of [Ag2(tdga)] (1) Complex Aqueous solution (*10 ml) containing AgNO3 (167 mg, 1 mmol) and tdgaH2 (0.075 g, 0.5 mmol) was reacted under ultrasonic irradiation (160 W, 40 kHz) at ambient temperature. Aqueous NH3 (25%) was added dropwise to the mixture to yield a clear colorless solution. The resultant solution was allowed to evaporate slowly in the dark at ambient temperature for 10-days to give colorless crystals of [Ag2(tdga)] (1); yield, 55%).

The crystallographic data and the reﬁnement results are listed in Table 1. 3 Result and Discussion 3.1 Description of Crystal Structure of [Ag2(tdga)] 1 The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that 1 is a 3D coordination polymer. The complex crystallizes in P21/c space group. Two crystallographically independent Ag(I) (Ag1 and Ag2) and one tdga2- anion are present in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1). Both Ag(I) centers adopt a dis- torted trigonal bipyramidal geometry by coordinating three- carboxylate oxygens from three different tdga2- units and one sulfur from a thioether moiety. The ﬁfth position occu- pied by silver (Ag2 for Ag1 and Ag1 for Ag2) completes the coordination (Fig. 2). The difference in the nature of the Ag(I) centers are supported by bond length and bond angle data (Tables 2, 3). The Ag–O bond lengths range from 2.2363(3) to 2.470(2) A˚ (Table 2) and are in accordance with reported values [19]. Similarly, the Ag–S distance of 2.5679 A˚ (Ag1–S34) and 2.5841 (9) A˚ are also in agreement with the previously reported Ag–S bond distance [20, 21]. A closure look at 1 reveals a novel coordination mode of the tdga2- (Fig. 3) where a single tdga2- ligand generates a l8-bridging mode, which connects eight Ag(I) ions (four Ag1 and four Ag2 atoms) via g1-(O11), g2-(O12), g2-(S3), g1-(O51) and g2-(O52) coordination. The bonding of a single tdga2- di- anion to eight metal centers is new and is the ﬁrst report of its kind. The sulfur atom of the thioether group is coordinated to two Ag(I) centers simultaneously due to its sulfur’s larger size. The tdga2- ion contains four O-donor centers from the carboxylate groups, which are hard centers, and a S-atom Fig. 1 Asymmetric unit of complex 1 Fig. 2 Coordination environment around silver(I), Ag1(a, b) and Ag2 (c, d) Table 2 Bond lenghts for 1 Atom Length/A˚ Atom Length/A˚ Ag2–Ag1 2.9675(4) S3–C4 1.813(4) Ag2–S31 2.5841(9) S3–C2 1.819(4) Ag2–O522 2.393(2) O52–C5 1.266(4) Ag2–O513 2.292(3) O51–C5 1.255(4) Ag2–O12 2.311(3) O12–C1 1.264(4) Ag1–S34 2.5679(10) O11–C1 1.252(4) Ag1–O523 2.363(3) C1–C2 1.521(5) Ag1–O125 2.470(2) C4–C5 1.517(5) Ag1–O11 2.230(3) 1 2 - X, 1 - Y, 1 - Z; 21 - X, -1/2 ?

The Ag(I) ion present in the complex is also soft. According to the hard– soft acid–base (HSAB) principle, the soft Ag? prefers a soft S center. In addition, the soft Ag(I) ion bonds to the hard carboxylate oxygens in multiple numbers to neutralize the basicity [22]. Therefore, it is the HSAB principle that is the driving force unique coordination of the tdga2- ligand. A zig-zag 1D chain is formed along a-axis where paddle wheel units are indentiﬁed. Each paddle wheel unit is formed by the Ag1 and Ag2 centers and is connected to each other via carboxylate coordination (Fig. 4). These chains are bridged by the carboxylate oxygen of tdga2- (along the b-axis) to form a 2D inﬁnite layer in the ab- plane (Fig. 5). Three different Ag1Ag2 separations are seen in the chain (a-axis) with distances 2.9674(1), 3.7045(2) and 5.1945(2) A˚ . The distance, 2.9674(1) A˚ , is well below the sum of the van der Waal’s radii between two Ag(I) atoms (3.44 A˚ ) [23] and is close to the AgAg separation in silver metal (2.89 A˚ ). This suggests weak Ag1–Ag2 bonding.

Two different Ag1Ag2 separations are explored along the b axis (8.9830(4) and 11.3587(5) A˚ ). It is worth noting that an alternate 4- and 16-membered ring is formed in the ab-layer (Fig. 5). Another 2D layer is seen in the bc-plane, which is formed by the coordination of the Ag(I) centers with the thioether and carboxylate group of tdga2- to form alternate 5, 10, 5 and 12-membered rings in the same plane (Fig. 6). The 2D layer in ab plane grows along the c-axis via coordination of the Ag(I) centers with the thioether group to form a 3D architecture (Fig. 7). 3.2 Thermal Study Thermogravimetric analysis of 1 was carried from 30 to 600 C (Fig. 8). The TGA shows that the complex 1 is stable to 195 C. On further heating, the complex decom- poses. A weight loss of 41.4%, (Calculated: 40.7) corre- sponds to the decomposition of the complex to form residual metallic silver 58.6% (calcd, 59.2%).

The free ligand, tdgaH2, displays photolumines- cence with the emission maximum at 477 and 507 nm (kex = 250 nm). The emission bands of the free ligand is assigned to a p*–n transition as observed previously reported for aliphatic carboxylic acid [24]. When 1 is excited at 250 nm, an emission maximum at 483 nm is observed. The emission of the complex can tentatively be assigned as a cumulative effect of intra-ligand and metal- centered (d–s/d–p) transitions as the X-ray study reveals the existence of a weak Ag–Ag bond in the titled complex. 4 Conclusions The synthesis and characterization of a Ag(I) coordination polymer with thiodiglycolate ligand is described. The unusual l8-coordination of the ligand is unique represent- ing a new structurally characterized complex. The complex has short distance of 2.96 A˚ between two Ag (I) centers suggesting that the ligand supported a weak Ag–Ag bond. The overall geometry of the complex is three-dimensional. Photoluminescence reveals that the emission behavior of the complex is due to intra-ligand and metal-centered transition. 5 Supplementary Materials Crystallographic data for the structural analysis have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Cen- ter, CCDC.
