Manuscript COMMUNICATION Syntheses, Structures and Properties of Two Metal–Iodide Polymers Based on a Flexile N-Donor Ligand Ya-Juan Fan • Jun-Yi Liu • Shuang-Quan Zang • Ying Zhou • Hong-Wei Hou Received: 22 December 2010 / Accepted: 16 April 2011 / Published online: 28 April 2011  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract Two novel metal–organic frameworks based on 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-benzene (m-bix), namely [(Cu4I4)(bix)2]n (1) and [HgI2(bix)]n (2) have been syn- thesized and characterized by IR, elemental analysis, thermogravimetry, luminescent properties and X-ray crys- tallography. The structure of compound 1 exhibits a 1D metal–organic chain composed of Cu4I4 clusters and m-bix ligands, and such chains are further united together to generate a 3D supramolecular structure through inter-chain pp interactions. In compound 2, the HgI2-bix chains interact each other to form a layer structure through pp interactions, then the layers are extended to 3D supra- molecular architecture through intermolecular C–Hp interactions.

In previous studies, the rational assembly of target supramolecular architectures depends on deliberate designs of ligands with adjustable connectivity and a reasonable choice of metal cations with speciﬁc coordination nature [5–8]. Ligands with pyridyl, imidazole or carboxylate groups have been exploited to prepare novel supramolecular architectures. In the last decades, many imidazole- containing ligands have been successfully employed in the generation of interesting systems in possession of multidimensional networks and properties [9–13]. In contrast to the well-investigated Ag(I), Zn(II) and Cd(II), metal ions such as Cu(I) and Hg(II) coordination poly- mers have been less studied. To explore further various factors that inﬂuence the formation of structures in the assembly reactions, we have undertaken synthetic and structural studies of two new Cu(I)- and Hg(II)-coordi- nation polymers based on the highly ﬂexible bidentate ligand, 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-benzene (m-bix): i.e., [(Cu4I4)(bix)2]n (1) and [HgI2(bix)]n (2). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Measurements m-Bix was prepared according to the literature [14]. All other starting materials were of analytical grade (Alfa Aesar (Tianjin) Chemical Ltd) and used without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analysis for C, H, and N were performed on a Perkin–Elmer 240 elemental analyzer. The FT-IR spectra were recorded as KBr pellets from 4,000 to 400 cm-1 on a Bruker VECTOR 22 spec- trometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were per- formed on a SDT 2960 thermal analyzer from room temperature to 800 C at a heating rate of 20 C/min under nitrogen ﬂow. Luminescence spectra for the solid samples were recorded on a Hitachi 850 ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer. Y.-J. Fan  J.-Y. Liu  S.-Q. Zang (&)  Y. Zhou  H.-W.

Lorentz polarization and absorption corrections were applied. The structures were solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97 [16] and reﬁned with the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXL-97 [17] program. Anisotropic thermal parameters were assigned to all non-hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms of the ligands were included in the struc- ture factor calculation at idealized positions by using a riding model and reﬁned isotropically. Analytical expres- sions of neutral atom scattering factors were employed, and anomalous dispersion corrections were incorporated. The crystallographic data and selected bond lengths and angles for 1–2 are listed in Tables 1 and 2. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Description of Crystal Structures X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that 1 crystallizes in tetragonal space group I41/acd. The asymmetry unit of 1 contains one crystallographic Cu(I) atom, one I-atom and a half bix ligand. Each Cu(I) center is coordinated to three I-atoms and one N-atom of the bix ligand to complete a tetrahedral geometry; Cu–I and Cu–N distances are 2.687–2.773 and 2.007 A˚ . Similar to other reported Cu4I4 tetramer units [18–20], each Cu(I) or I-atom links three neighboring I-atoms or Cu(I) centers to form a distorted cubane Cu4I4 unit in which Cu(I) and I-atoms occupy the cubic corners alternatively (Fig. 1a). The Cu–Cu distances are within the normal range. There are one-fourfold axis and three mutually perpendicular twofold axes passing through the center of the cube. Each bix ligand acts as a l2-bridge in GG conformation linking two Cu4I4 units through two coordinated terminal N-atoms. Two cubane- like Cu4I4 units are bridged by a pair of symmetry-related ligands to give rise to a 26-atomic macrocycle; adjacent macrocycles are mutually perpendicular and further link to each other to form a 1D ribbon running along the c-axis by sharing a Cu4I4 cluster (Fig. 1b). It is noteworthy that the adjacent imidazole rings from different ribbons are almost parallel, which contributes to the formation of face-to-face pp interactions. Each ribbon is further connected to four other similar rib- bons through signiﬁcant intermolecular pp interactions Table 1 Crystal data and structure reﬁnement details for 1 and 2 Compound 1 2 Empirical formula C7H7CuIN2 C14H14HgI2N4 Formula weight 309.59 692.68 Crystal system Tetragonal Triclinic Space group I41/acd Pı¯ a (A˚ ) 19.7726(6) 8.8205(1) b (A˚ ) 19.7726(6) 8.9955(1) c (A˚ ) 18.3546(8) 11.5582(2) a () 90 74.746(1) b () 90 87.942(1) c () 90 84.191(1) V (A˚ 3) 7175.8(4) 880.19(2) Z 32 2 Dc (g cm-3) 2.292 2.614 l (mm-1) 5.812 12.249 F(000) 4640 624 Reﬂns collected 7767 12350 Independent reﬂns 1580 3126 R(int) 0.0465 0.0308 GOF on F2 1.039 1.057 Data/restraints/parameters 1580/1/102 3126/0/191 R1 a/wR2 b (I [ 2r (I)) 0.0323/0.0501 0.0215/0.0461 R1 a/wR2 b (all data) 0.0460/0.0533 0.0227/0.0466 Max/min(e A˚ -3) 0.388/-0.470 0.935/-0.705 a R1 = P||Fo|-|Fc||/P|Fo| b wR2 = {P[w(Fo 2-Fc 2)2]/P[w(Fo 2)2]}1/2 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2011) 21:718–722 719 123 between the imidazole rings of the m-bix ligands (inter- centroid distance 3.686 A˚ ) along four orientations to form a 3D supramolecular framework (Fig. 1c). 3.1.1 [HgI2(bix)]n (2) The X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that 2 crystal- lizes in triclinic space group Pı¯. The asymmetric unit consists of one Hg(II)-atom, one m-bix ligand and two I-atoms (Fig. 2a). The metal center is surrounded by two I-atoms and two N-atoms from different m-bix ligands to achieve a distorted tetrahedral environment. Each m-bix ligand acts as a l2-bridge in TG conformation with a dihedral angle between the two imidazole rings of ca. 68. The twist of the aromatic rings of the ligand may contribute to the formation of the helical segments. Adjacent metal atoms are bridged by the ligand through two terminal N-donors to result in an inﬁnite chain running along the c-axis in which the helical segments have the same chi- rality (Fig. 2b). The neighboring chains are arranged anti- parallel and the whole structure is centrosymmetric. A number of interchain face-to-face pp interactions (inter- centroid distance: 3.718, 3.876, and 3.965 A˚ ) can be detected, which contributes to the formation of the 2D supromolecular structure (Fig. 2c). An additional investigation of this structure indicates that the imidazole ring and adjacent phenyl ring from different layers are arranged almost mutually perpendicular, which is ideally situated for the formation of the C–Hp interactions (H3–centroid: 2.974 A˚ ). The adjacent layers are further Table 2 Selected bond lengths and angles for 1 and 2 Compound 1a Cu(1)–N(1) 2.007(4) Cu(1)–Cu(1)#1 2.6389(2) Cu(1)–I(1)#2 2.6874(8) Cu(1)–I(1)#1 2.7003(8) Cu(1)–Cu(1)#2 2.7084(1) Cu(1)–Cu(1)#3 2.7084(1) Cu(1)–I(1) 2.7733(8) N(1)–Cu(1)–Cu(1)#1 137.16(1) N(1)–Cu(1)–I(1)#2 110.11(1) Cu(1)#1–Cu(1)–I(1)#2 112.299(2) N(1)–Cu(1)–I(1)#1 106.09(1) Cu(1)#1–Cu(1)–I(1)#1 62.57(3) I(1)#2–Cu(1)–I(1)#1 112.21(3) N(1)–Cu(1)–Cu(1)#2 152.37(1) Cu(1)#1–Cu(1)–Cu(1)#2 60.845(2) I(1)#2–Cu(1)–Cu(1)#2 61.85(3) I(1)#1–Cu(1)–Cu(1)#2 59.59(2) N(1)–Cu(1)–Cu(1)#3 143.82(1) Cu(1)#1–Cu(1)–Cu(1)#3 60.845(2) I(1)#2–Cu(1)–Cu(1)#3 60.06(3) I(1)#1–Cu(1)–Cu(1)#3 109.74(2) Cu(1)#2–Cu(1)–Cu(1)#3 58.31(3) N(1)–Cu(1)–I(1) 100.00(1) Cu(1)#1–Cu(1)–I(1) 59.80(3) I(1)#2–Cu(1)–I(1) 109.96(3) I(1)#1–Cu(1)–I(1) 117.55(3) Cu(1)#2–Cu(1)–I(1) 107.60(2) Cu(1)#3–Cu(1)–I(1) 58.70(2) Compound 2b Hg(1)–N(4)#1 2.304(4) Hg(1)–N(1) 2.339(3) Hg(1)–I(1) 2.6569(4) Hg(1)–I(2) 2.7252(3) N(4)#1–Hg(1)–N(1) 92.26(1) N(4)#1–Hg(1)–I(1) 120.62(9) N(1)–Hg(1)–I(1) 108.74(8) N(4)#1–Hg(1)–I(2) 100.64(9) N(1)–Hg(1)–I(2) 103.80(8) I(1)–Hg(1)–I(2) 125.00(1) a #1 –x ? 1, -y ? 1/2, z; #2 –y ? 3/4, x - 1/4, -z ? 9/4; #3 y ? 1/4, -x ? 3/4, -z ? 9/4; #4 y ? 1/4, x - 1/4, -z ? 7/4 b #1 x, y, z ? 1 Fig. 1 a Cu4I4 unit, metal coordination and atom labeling of 1 (thermal ellipsoids at 50% probability level).

For 1, no obvious weight loss was observed up to 350 C. For 2, a rapid weight loss was observed above 245 C. 3.3 Luminescence Properties The photoluminescence properties of 1 and 2 and the free ligand in the solid state were investigated (Fig. 4). For 1, excitation at 381 nm leads to an intense broad green-ﬂuo- rescent emission at 561 nm while for 2 the weak violet ﬂuorescence emission is observed at 408 nm. The emission band for the free ligand is at 398 nm when excited at 308 nm. Relative to the emission peak for the free ligand, the emission of 1 with an enhancement of luminescence and bathochromic shift may be attributed to a combination of a ‘cluster–cantered’ excited-state containing mixed halide-to-metal charge-transfer and a d–s transition by Cu–Cu interactions, instead of pure metal-to-ligand or ligand–metal charge-transfer.[21–23] The weak emission of 2 may be assigned to the intra-ligand (p–p*) ﬂuorescent emission because a similar emission is observed at 398 nm for the free ligand. Thus, 1 may be suitable a candidate of green-ﬂuorescent materials since it is thermally stable and insoluble in common solvents. 4 Conclusions Two d10 metal halide m-bix coordination polymers with different and interesting structural modes were prepared.
