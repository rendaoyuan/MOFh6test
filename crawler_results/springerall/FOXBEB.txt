Manuscript ORIGINAL PAPER Synthesis and Crystal Structure of Three Alkaline Earth Coordination Compounds Based on 1,2,5-Thiadiazole-3,4- Dicarboxylic Acid Ligand Zhen-Xin Zhao • Bu-Wei Ma • Bo-Yu Zhou • Li-Fu Wang • Guo-Jian Ren • Ying-Hui Zhang Received: 2 April 2014 / Accepted: 6 August 2014 / Published online: 21 August 2014  Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014 Abstract 1,2,5-thiadiazole-3,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2tdzdc) ligand has been used to construct three coordination com- pounds [Mg(tdzdc)(H2O)4](1), [Ca(tdzdc)(H2O)2]n(2) and [Sr(tdzdc)(H2O)3]n(3) by the solvothermal reaction. Single- crystal structure analyses reveal a mononuclear coordina- tion structure for compound 1 and two dimensional coor- dination structure both for compound 2 and 3. Furthermore, all of these three compounds comprise any amount of hydrogen bond interactions, which extends their crystal structure into three dimensional (3D) frameworks. Differ- ent crystal structure of compounds 1–3 reveals diversiﬁed coordination modes of H2tdzdc ligand toward alkaline earth metal ions, depending mainly on the radius and the electron shell number of metal ions used. Keywords Alkaline earth metal  Coordination modes  Crystal structure Introduction Although great progress has been made, designing metal organic coordination compounds with fascinating structure and peculiar properties has continuously been an exciting challenge in the past two decades. Accordingly, many effective construction strategies have been developed to synthesize target coordination compounds [1–11]. As two typical coordination groups, carboxylate and azole often be used together in designing new coordination ligands, such as dicarboxylate imidazole and dicarboxylate triazole. The obtained coordination compounds based on these ligands show versatile structure, and therefore have potential application prospects in the ﬁeld of adsorption, catalysis and functional materials [12–19]. In comparison with much studied transition metal ions, alkaline earth metal ions, such as Mg and Ca ions, although being widespread in living organisms as essential trace elements [20–22], receive relatively little attention in the ﬁeld of coordination compounds. In this report, the coordination modes of 1,2,5- thiadiazole-3,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2tdzdc) ligand toward Mg, Ca and Sr ions were studied by solvothermal reaction, in order to develop new alkaline earth-based coordination compounds. The Co(II) and Ni(II) coordination compounds with tdzdc ligand have been reported by in situ solvothermal reaction of 3,4-dicyano-1,2,5-thiadiazole with metal chlo- ride [23]. However, direct using of H2tdzdc as reaction reagent has not been studied. Our study reveals crucial dependence of the crystal structure of alkaline earth ion coordination compounds with tdzdc ligand on the radius and electron shell number of alkaline earth metal ion used. Experimental Section 1,2,5-thiadiazole-3,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2tdzdc) was synthesized according to literature [19]. All reagents and solvents employed are of AR Grade from commercially sources and were used as received. Elemental analysis of Z.-X. Zhao  B.-W.

The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments have been carried out on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer, operated at 40 kV and 100 mA, using a Cu-target tube and a graphite monochromator. Synthesis [Mg(tdzdc)(H2O)4] (1): A mixture of 104.4 mg H2tdzdc (0.6 mmol), 153.8 mg Mg(NO3)26H2O (0.6 mmol), 5 %(w/w) NaOH solution (5d), ethanol (4 mL) and H2O (6 mL) was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. Then, the mixture was sealed in a Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 160 C for 48 h. After cooled to room temperature, the colorless transparent crystals of 1 were collected by ﬁltration, washed with water and ethanol respectively, and dried in air, with a yield of 40 % (based on metal salts).

X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determinations Single crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected on a SCX-mini diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 293 K by an x scan mode. The program SAINT [24] was used for the inte- gration of the diffraction proﬁles. Absorption correction was applied by using multi-scan program SADABS [25]. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares technique using SHELXTL [26]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters. The H atoms of the ligands were generated theoretically onto speciﬁc atoms and reﬁned isotropically with ﬁxed thermal factors. Crystallographic data (excluding structure factors) for polymer 1, 2 and 3 have been deposited with the Cam- bridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC, 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB21EZ, UK).

Detailed inspection of compound 1 reveals the co-existence of several kinds of hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond formed between the N atoms of thiadiazole ring and the coordinating water molecules of adjacent mononuclei results in a 1D chain (Fig. 1b), which is further extended into 3D network by the hydrogen bond formed between carboxylate groups and coordinating waters molecules (Fig. 1c). In general, each mononuclear is linked with eight adjacent mononuclei by three kinds of hydrogen bonds: one between N atoms and the coordinat- ing water of adjacent mononuclei, one between carboxylate groups and the coordinating water of adjacent mononuclei, and one between coordinating water molecules and the carboxylate groups of adjacent mononuclei. Detailed structure parameters of these hydrogen bonds are listed in Table 3.

Each Ca(II) is seven- coordinated by one N atom and six O atoms (two O atoms from H2O and four O atoms from four tdzdc ligands). Two adjacent Ca(II) ions are double-bridged by two tdzdc ligands both in l2-jN,O: jO mode, to form a di-nuclear Ca(II) cluster that is nearly coplanar with thiadazole ring. Furthermore, two adjacent di-nuclear Ca(II) clusters are double-bridged, in perpendicular direction, by two car- boxylate group from other two tdzdc ligands in l2-jO: jO0 mode, to form a two-dimensional (2D) plane structure (Fig. 2c). In brief, each di-nuclear Ca cluster is coordinated by six tdzdc ligands, while each tdzdc ligand, adopting a l4-j N,O: jO: jO0: jO00 mode, connects three di-nuclear Ca(II) unit. Simplifying the di-nuclear Ca(II) unit as a six-con- necting node and tdzdc as a topological three-connecting bridge node, the structure can produce a 2D kdg topolog- ical structure with point symbol of {43}2{466683} (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, 2D layers are linked by the hydrogen bond formed between carboxylate groups(coor- dinating water molecules) and coordinating water mole- cules (carboxylate groups) of adjacent layers (Fig. 2e), to form a 3D network. Some selected hydrogen bonds with bond angle larger than 150 degree are listed in Table 3. [Sr(tdzdc)(H2O)3]n (3): Crystallographic analysis revealed that compound 3 crystallizes in triclinic space group P-1, with a 2D layer structure. The asymmetric unit contains one Sr(II) ion, one tdzdc ligand and three coor- dinated water molecules. The Sr(II) ion is nine-coordinated by ﬁve carboxylate oxygen atoms from four individual tdzdc ligands, three oxygen atoms from three coordinated H2O molecules and one N atom from one tdzdc ligand, as shown in Fig. 3a, while a tdzdc ligand bridges four Sr(II) ions in l4-jN,O:jO0,O00: jO0: jO00 mode (Fig. 3b), to build a two-dimensional layer structure (Fig. 3c). Simplifying the Sr(II) as four-connecting node and tdzdc as a topological two-connecting bridge node, the framework can be simpliﬁed as a sql topologic network with a point symbol of {44.62} for compound 3 (Fig. 3d). Hydrogen bond interactions are also observed for com- pound 3, formed between carboxylate groups (coordinating water molecules) and coordinating water molecules (car- boxylate groups) of adjacent layers (Fig. 3e) and link the adjacent 2D layers to form a 3D network.

Analyses on the Coordination Model of tdzdc Ligand Based on above analyses on the structure of compounds 1-3, it’s revealed that tdzdc ligand exhibits different coordination modes toward different alkaline earth metal ions, as concluded in Fig. 4. This difference can be ratio- nalized in the term of different ionic radius as well as different electron shell number. From Mg(II), to Ca(II) and Sr(II) ions, both ionic radius and electron shell number increases gradually, which would lead to increasing coor- dination number, as testiﬁed in compounds 1-3. The smallest Mg(II) exhibits six-coordinated structure in com- pound 1, due to larger steric hindrance effect, wihle larger Ca(II) ion is seven-coordinated in compound 2 and the largest Sr(II) ion displays nine-coordinated structure in compound 3, because of increasing atomic radius and electron shell number. Conclusions Based on H2tdzdc ligand, three new alkaline earth coor- dination compounds were synthesized with different crystal structure, due to different ion radius and electron shell number.
