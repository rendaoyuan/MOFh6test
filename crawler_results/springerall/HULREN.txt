Owing to their intrinsic characters such as porous structures and large surface areas, they have attracted great attention not only due to their intriguing structural and topological diversities [2–8], but also to their potential applications in many ﬁelds such as catalysis, magnetism, optics, ion exchange, gas storage and photochromism [9–16]. Among the MOFs, special attention has been paid to the structurally sensitive materials based on conformation changes of ligands [12]. So far, for the preparation of structurally sensitive materials, the main strategy is the proper choice of organic ligands, such as the polydentate ligands with both rigidness and ﬂexibility containing N- or O-donors. The linear N, O-containing ligands are efﬁcient l2-bridged linkers that can provide both rigidness and ﬂexibility to access structurally sensitive materials. For example, terephthalic acid and benzidine can be assembled into square-grid networks containing large cavities [17]. Furthermore, those ligands containing imidazole or carboxylate groups are of special interests due to their good coordination abilities and diverse coordination modes [18, 19]. So far, about 50 complexes employing ligands consisting of both imidazole and carboxylate as building block for the construction of functional MOFs have been reported [12, 20–24]. Besides, Cu(II)/Ni(II)-based compounds have exhibited many promising applications as new functional materials, such as gas adsorptions and ﬂuorescent probes [5, 25]. We aim to construct novel metal–organic materials with excellent structurally sensitive behavior. Herein, by using 4-(imidazole-1-yl)-benzoic acid (imbz) ligand, we successfully synthesized two new coordination frameworks [Ni(imbz)2]n (1), [Cu(imbz)24H2O]n (2), which exhibit tunable photoluminescences upon thermochromisms. Experimental Materials and Methods All the starting materials were AR grade and used as purchased without further puriﬁcation. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum-2000 FTIR spectrophotometer (4,000–400 cm-1) on powdered sample spread on KBr plate. Elemental analysis for C, H and N were performed on a Vario MICRO elemental analyzer. UV–Vis solid diffuse reﬂectance spectra were carried out at room temperature on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-800 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Thermo- chromic tests were implemented at the XTS20 Zoom Stereo microscope. Fluorescence spectra were executed on a FL900/FS900 ﬂuorescence spectrometer produced by Edinburg Co. Ltd. in England. 1320 X.-H. Chao et al. 123 Synthesis of [Ni(imbz)2]n (1) 4-(imidazole-1-yl)-benzoic acid (0.0188 g, 0.1 mmol) and NaOH (0.0040 g, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL distilled water under stirring condition, and then NiCl25H2O (0.0472 g, 0.2 mmol) was added with light blue deposits obtained. 10 mL methanol was added into the resultant suspension and kept stirring for 2 h at the temperature of 60 C. The solution was removed to a 25 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel and then heated at a rate of 5 C/h to 160 C under autogenous pressure. After maintained for 72 h, the reaction vessel was cooled to room temperature, blue rod-like crystals in ca.56 % yield based on Ni were obtained. Elemental Anal. Calc.

Synthesis of [Cu(imbz)24H2O]n (2) The synthesis process of 2 is similar to that of 1 except the NiCl25H2O was replaced by CuCl22H2O (0.0342 g, 0.2 mmol). Deep blue crystals in ca.37 % yield based on Cu were obtained. Elemental Anal. Calc. (%) for C20H22N4CuO8 (509.96): C, 47.11; H, 4.34; N, 10.99. Found (%): C, 47.43; H, 4.31; N, 10.71. IR (KBr, cm-1): 3513m, 3148s, 1606s, 1523s, 1380s, 1305s, 1187w, 1122w, 1066m, 961m, 786s, 648m, 505m, 379m. We have found that under the similar reaction conditions, higher temperature and longer times inhibit the formation of the target products. X-ray Crystallography Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for 1 and 2 were collected on Rigaku Weissenbery IP diffractometer with MoKa (k = 0.71069 A˚ ) at 298(2) K by using an x–2h scan mode. The corrections multi-scan absorption corrections were applied. The structures were solved by direct method, and the non-hydrogen atoms were subjected to anisotropic reﬁnement by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL97 package [26]. Hydrogen atoms excluding those on water molecules were generated geometrically and included in structure factor calcula- tions. Due to the presence of several disordered waters without precise positions, some short OO distances can be observed, and the hydrogen atoms on the water molecules were not located. Crystallographic and reﬁnement details are summa- rized in Table 1, selected bond lengths and angles are list in Table 2. Hydrogen bond details are given in Tables 3. Crystallographic data for 1 and 2 have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center as supplementary publications. Coordination Frameworks Constructed from imbz 1321 123 Results and Discussion Structural Descriptions X-ray analysis reveals that the compound 1 is neutral MOFs with tetragonal system and P4322 space group. It exhibits two-dimensional layer structure based on the linkage of imbz ligands. The central Ni(II) lies in a special position of twofold rotation axes and is in tetra-coordinated distorted tetrahedral geometry environment, completed by two oxygen atoms from carboxylates and two nitrogen atoms from imidazole groups with Ni–O distance of 1.938(3) A˚ and Ni–N distance of 2.031(3) A˚ (Fig. 1a), which cab be comparable with other transition metal- N(O) bond distances [12, 27–29]. Its distorted tetrahedral geometry can also be judged from the O–Ni–N bond angles (110.5(2)–118.03(2)). In 1, the carboxylate group is completely deprotonated with the averaged C–O bonds of carboxylate group (1.225(6) and 1.277(6) A˚ for C–O bonds, Table 1), and it adopts a monodentate mode. The dihedral angles of the two aromatic rings (benzene and imidazole) and benzene ring to carboxyl plane are 43.949(15) and 14.019(3), indicating a great distortion of imbz ligand compare with its free conﬁguration. The most striking structural feature of 1 focuses on its 2-D layer along the ab plane, which is generated from the linkage of carboxylate and imidazole groups of imbz Table 1 Crystal data and structure reﬁnement for 1 and 2 Compound 1 2 Empirical formula C20H14N4NiO4 C20H22CuN4O8 Formula mass 433.04 509.96 Crystal system Tetragonal Tetragonal Space group P4322 I41/a a[A˚ ] 8.0722(8) 20.278(2) c [A˚ ] 28.111(5) 12.745(3) V[A˚ 3] 1831.7(5) 5240.7(16) Z 4 8 Dc[g/cm3] 1.570 1.272 l[mm-1] 1.096 0.879 F(000) 888 2040 Reﬂections, total 6269 9012 Reﬂections, independent 2118 (Rint = 0.0541) 2980 (Rint = 0.0642) Reﬂections, observed 1431 1820 Goodness-of-ﬁt on F2 0.959 0.947 Data/restraints/parameters 2118/0/132 2980/18/166 R1[I [ 2r(I)]a 0.0511 0.0664 wR2I [ 2r(I)] 0.1207 0.1885 R indices (all data) 0.0889, 0.1408 0.1134, 0.2268 Residual extremes[e/A˚ 3] 0.348,-0.934 0.848, -0.298 a R1 = kF0|-|Fck/|F0|, wR2 = [w(F0 2 Fc 2)2/[w(F0 2)2]1/2 1322 X.-H. Chao et al. 123 ligands (Fig. 1a). This (4, 4)-network of 1 is structurally similar to reported compounds [28–30], which can also be described as the repeated inﬁnite regular square grids (Ni–Ni separation of 11.416 A˚ , Ni–Ni–Ni angle of 90.0). Therefore, compound 1 exhibits a perfect square grid with square dimensions of 11.4158(11) 9 11.4158(11) A˚ , which is represented by square grid model (Fig. 1). Adjacent layers stack along the c axis with the interlayer separation 7.029(1) A˚ (Fig. 1b). In addition, inter-molecular C–HO hydrogen bonds can also be found to stabilize the structure (Table 3). Interestingly, the structure is further stabilized by intra-layer and inter-layer pp stacking interactions between adjacent imidazole and phenyl rings (Table 4), respectively. X-ray structural analysis reveals that the compound 2 is three-dimensional neutral metal–organic framework with tetragonal system and I41/a space group, and some isolated waters are encapsulated in its cavities. In [Cu(imbz)24H2O]n, Cu(II) center located on a crystallographic 2-fold axis and displays a planar square coordination geometry with its coordination sphere deﬁned by two carboxyl oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms of imbz ligands, as shown in Fig. 2a. In this CuO2N2 tetrahedron, Cu–O(N) bond distances are normal with range of 1.964(2)–1.973(2) A˚ [31]. However, the copper atoms have weak axial connections to semicoordinated carboxylic atoms (Cu(1)–O(2) and Cu(1)–O(2)#1: 2.765(2) A˚ , symmetry code: -x ? 1/2,-y - 1/2,-z ? 1/2), resulting in a 4 ? 2 coordination sphere for the copper atom (Fig. 2a). Therefore, the carboxyl groups can be treated as bidentate chelated mode with averaged C–O lengths 1.222(5) and 1.262(4) A˚ . It can also be veriﬁed from the infrared spectrum, the absorption peaks at 1606 cm-1 can be attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of carbonyl Vas(COO-) and the absorption peaks at 1523 cm-1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of Vs(COO-). The difference between Vas(COO-) and Vas(COO-) is only 140 cm-1, indicating its bidentate chelated coordinated model [32]. In one imbz ligand, the Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and bond angles (deg) for 1 and 2 Compound 1 Ni(1)–O(2) 1.938(3) Ni(1)–N(2)#2 2.031(3) O(2)–Ni(1)–O(2)#1 100.6(2) O(2)–Ni(1)–N(2)#2 118.03(14) O(2)#1–Ni(1)–N(2)#2 110.52(15) N(2)#2–Ni(1)–N(2)#3 100.1(2) Compound 2 Cu(1)–O(1) 1.964(2) Cu(1)–O(2) 2.765(2) Cu(1)–N(2)#1 1.973(2) O(1)–Cu(1)–N(2)#1 90.32(9) Symmetry codes for 1: #1 –x - 1, y, -z; #2 x - 1, y - 1, z z; #3 -x, y - 1, -z Symmetry codes for 2: #1 -x ? 1/2, -y - 1/2, -z ? 1/2 Table 3 Hydrogen bond lengths (A˚ ) and bond angles (deg) for 1 and 2 Compound D–HA d(D–H) d(HA) d(DA) \DHA Symmetry codes 1 C(7)–H(7)O(1)#1 0.93 2.46 3.184(6) 134 -x, 1 ? y, -z 2 C(8)–H(8)O(2)#2 0.93 2.56 3.320(4) 139 1/2-x, -y, -1/2 ? z Coordination Frameworks Constructed from imbz 1323 123 Fig. 1 a 2-D layer of 1 along ab plane showing the coordinated environment of Ni centers; b the square- like network of 1, only the nickel atoms and the connections between them are shown 1324 X.-H. Chao et al. 123 dihedral angles of the two aromatic rings (benzene and imidazole) and benzene ring to carboxyl plane are 40.08(2) and 13.321(2), respectively, which is slightly less distortion than that in 1. The CuN2O4 polyhedron is alternately bridged by two carboxylate groups and two imidazole groups to result in 3-D tetragonal-grid layer structure. The extended 3-D framework of compound 2 involving 1-D open channels viewing along the crystallographic a axis can be seen in Fig. 2. The approximate dimensions of these channels are 20.278(2) 9 39.5565(8) A˚ (calcu- lated from the distance of the neighboring Cu atoms) [33], which are large enough to encapsulate four guest solvent water molecules. The single channels in 2 illustrating its capacity (disordered waters in channels were omitted for clarity) can be seen in Fig. 2. A similar compound [Cu(ibz)22H2O]n with generally the same network (channel size: 20.278(2) 9 39.5565(8) A˚ ) has been previously reported [34], which accommodates less guest waters. In addition, some other analogues constructed from imbz ligands can be structurally compared. For example, in [Cu(IB)2]nn(H2O), each Cu center is bridged by four IB ligands to give rise to a double stranded chain [35]. And {[Cu(imbz)2]}n has a Kagome structure with 1D hexagonal open channels [36], but [Cu5(IBA)4(N3)2(SO4)2]4H2O present a two- dimensional layer structure based on the bridged nature of IBA ligands in the ab plane [37]. Finally, structural analysis also suggests that inter-molecular C(8)- H(8)O(2) hydrogen bond (Table 3) can be observed and contribute to the structure stabilization, but p–p stacking interactions can not be found. Absorption Spectrum and Linear Absorption Optical Properties The room-temperature UV–Vis absorption spectra in the 200–800 nm region (Fig. 3a) exhibit absorption peaks at 282 nm (for 1 and 2). The absorption peaks at 282 nm belong to the p–p*and n–p* transitions of aromatic ring in imbz ligand [38]. The absorption spectra of 1 and 2 were calculated from reﬂection spectra by the Kubelka–Munk function (Fig. 3b) [39, 40]. The energy gaps of 1 and 2 determined by extrapolation from the linear portion of the absorption edge in a (a/S) versus energy plot are about 3.81 and 3.96 eV respectively, suggesting their insulator nature.

Chao et al. 123 Tunable Photoluminescence Upon Thermochromisms We have measured the photoluminescence spectra of powder samples of imbz ligand, 1 and 2 at room temperature with excitation wavelengths at 366 nm (for imbz ligand) and 482 nm (for 1 and 2). What’s more, we also detected the photoluminescence spectra of 1 and 2 after thermochromism under the same conditions simultaneously, and their solid state photoluminescence spectra together with those before and after thermochromism are depicted in Fig. 4. The imbz ligand presents a strong emission at 471 nm upon excited at 366 nm (Fig. 4a). At room temperature (before thermochromism), both compounds exhibit emissions in visible 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 compound 1 compound 2 FR Wavelength/nm 282 (a) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Kubelka-Munk Eg/ev compound 1 compound 2 (b) Fig. 3 UV–Vis absorption spectra (a) and optical adsorption spectra (b) of 1 and 2 Coordination Frameworks Constructed from imbz 1327 123 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 0 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 7000 6000 5000 4000 3000 2000 1000 450 500 550 600 650 600 610 620 540 614 630 heat heat 615 2000 4000 6000 8000 Intensity/a.u.

Chao et al. 123 region when excited at 482 nm (Fig. 4a, for 1: stronger peak at 615 nm; for 2: stronger peak at 540 nm and a weak peak at 614 nm). By comparison the ﬂuorescent emissions of imbz ligand and complexes, the emission peaks at 615 nm for [Ni(imbz)2]n (1) and 614 nm for [Cu(imbz)24H2O]n (2) might be assigned to LMCT (ligand-to-metal charge transfer), while the emission peak at 540 nm for 2 is close to that of imbz ligand, hence it is reasonable to attribute this emission to the intra-ligand p–p* transition of ligand [28]. Generally, multiple p–p stacking interactions can enhance the ﬂuorescence efﬁciency [41, 42]. It is clearly that the luminescence intensity of 2 is much stronger than that of 1, which stems from the less distortion of imbz ligand in 2. Interestingly,both1and2 are reversible thermochromic materials,thatis, theychange color as a function of temperature. In detail, compound 1 undergoes a color change from blue to green when it is heated to 100 C, and its ﬂuorescent intensity is signiﬁcantly reduced(from3500to1600 a.u.).Comparably,compound2exhibitsacolorchangefrom deep blue to light blue with transformation temperature of 80 C. To our interest, the ﬂuorescence of2 disappearsafter thermochromism. This thermally inducedcolor change accompanied by a reduction or the disappearance of the ﬂuorescent intensity is probably due to the increase of energy barrier of the electronic transition after heating [43]. Therefore, the energy of obtained electron under the irradiation of the same wavelength excitation is lower than the energy needed for electronic transition. Anyway, it will remain a great challenge in the future to clarify the mechanism of thermochromism associated with disappear or reduction of ﬂuorescence intensity. These compounds can be potentially applied in the new molecular switches. Different from the viologen-based thermochromism compounds, where electron transferring to the viologen molecule is coming from and stabilized by inorganic moieties [44, 45], the electron in this study may be stabilized by the multiple p-p stacking interactions and the distance between the aromatic rings of tetragonal-grid layer structure, which has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the ﬂuorescent intensity and thermochromism properties. Conclusions In conclusion, two new two- and three-dimensional transition-MOFs [Ni(imbz)2]n (1), [Cu(imbz)24H2O]n (2), (imbz = 4-(imidazole-1-yl)-benzoic acid) have been synthesized by solvothermal reactions. Two compounds exhibit two- and three- dimensional networks. Interestingly, they present tunable photoluminescences upon thermochromisms. In detail, two compounds undergo a color change from blue to green (for 1) and dark blue to light blue (for 2) accompanied by a reduction or disappear of the ﬂuorescent intensities. Our research provides a new way to design and synthesize new thermochromism hybrids with excellent switching properties.
