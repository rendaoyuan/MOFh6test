Interesting Copper(I) and Mercury(II) 1D Coordination Polymers Based on 3,6-Bis(2-pyridylthio)pyridazine Ligand: Syntheses, Structures and Properties Rui-Feng Song • Ying-Ying Sun • Jun Yang • Xiao-Yuan Yang Received: 30 August 2010 / Accepted: 30 December 2010 / Published online: 15 January 2011  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract Two interesting d10 metal complexes of 3,6- bis(2-pyridylthio)pyridazine ligand (PTP), [Cu3I3(PTP)]n (1) and [HgI2(PTP)]n (2), have been synthesized and characterized by IR, elemental analysis, UV–Vis–NIR spectra, thermal analysis and single crystal X-ray diffrac- tion analysis. Single-crystal X-ray analyses show that two complexes are both 1D chain coordination polymer. Complex 1 is a linear chain structure which is constructed from trinuclear Cu3I3 butterﬂy-shaped units by means of Cu–I bonds. Complex 2 is one-dimensional helical chain structure. In complex 2, two helical single chains form a double helix structure, and these double helix structures are further assembled to form a quasi 2D network by C–H_I hydrogen bonds. Optical diffuse-reﬂection spectra results suggest complex 1 has the property of the semiconductor. Keywords Copper(I) complex  Mercury(II) complex  Coordination polymer  Crystal structure 1 Introduction The design and crystal engineering of self-assembled coordination polymers containing metal ions and organic bridging ligands are of great current interest owing to their varied structures and potential properties such as magnetism, nonlinear optics, electronics, catalysis and molecular recognition [1–3]. In fabricating the coordina- tion polymer, the speciﬁc structures can be prepared through self-assembly reactions by introducing specially designed ligands and carefully selected metal ions with deﬁnite coordination geometry [4, 5]. Heterocyclic ﬂexi- ble thioethers containing nitrogen and sulfur donors are well established ligands in coordination and metallosu- pramolecular chemistry, and their ﬂexibility and multi- modal nature often give rise to less predictable architectures [6, 7]. On the other hand, the d10 metals are promising for fabricating such coordination assemblies due to their wide variety of coordination numbers and geometries. In this respect, the d10 metal complexes of N-containing heterocyclic ﬂexible thioethers ligands are especially extensively studied [6–9]. Although the com- plexes of the thioether ligands containing pyridazine group have attracted considerable interest [10–20], d10 metal complexes of these ligands are still comparatively rare [10, 11, 17–20]. As a thioether ligand containing pyridazine group, 3,6- bis(2-pyridylthio) pyridazine (PTP) (Scheme 1) reacts respectively with Cu(II), Zn(II) and Co(II) salts to produce a series of complexes [17–20]. However, to our knowl- edge, its d10 metal complexes only reported dinuclear complexes of Cu(I) ion [17–19]. Herein, we report the crystal structures of two interesting complexes, [Cu3I3 (PTP)]n (1) and [HgI2(PTP)]n (2), obtained through self- assembly reactions of CuI and HgI2 with the ligand PTP, respectively. These two complexes were characterized by FT-IR, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and ele- mental analysis, and their optical properties and thermal stability were determined.

FT-IR spectra (KBr pellet) were taken on a FT-IR 170 SX (Nicolet) spectrometer in the 4000–400 cm-1. Elemental analysis (C, H and N) was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 240C analytical instrument. Thermal analysis (TG/DTA) of the complexes was conducted on 204F1Phoenix thermal analyzer with a heating rate of 10 C/min from 30 to 800 C with a 50.0 mL/min nitrogen gas ﬂow. UV–Vis– NIR spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrometer at room temperature. 2.2 Syntheses of Complexes 2.2.1 [Cu3I3(PTP)]n (1) The solution of CuI (18.5 mg, 0.1 mmol) in CH3CN (5 mL) was slowly added to the solution of PTP (30 mg, 0.1 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5 mL). The reaction mixture was kept in the dark and was allowed to evaporate slowly, and obtained red single crystals 1 suitable for X-ray analysis in 73.2% yield based on CuI.

The determination of unit cell parameters and data collections were performed with Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). Unit cell dimensions were obtained with least-squares reﬁnements and all structures were solved by direct methods [22]. Metal atoms in complexes were located from E-maps. The other non-hydrogen atoms were located in successive difference Fourier syntheses. The ﬁnal reﬁnement was performed by full matrix least-squares methods with anisotropic thermal parameters for non- hydrogen atoms on F2 [23]. Hydrogen atoms were added theoretically and riding on the concerned atoms. Crystal- lographic data and experimental details for structural analyses are summarized in Table 1.

In the ﬁrst Cu(I) cen- tre, each Cu(I) centre [Cu(1) and Cu(1)B] adopts a dis- torted tetrahedral coordination geometry comprised of two iodines and a pyridine N atom and a pyridazine N atom from one PTP ligand [the angles vary from 93.8(2) to 116.00(14)]. The Cu–N bond lengths [Cu1–N2 2.062(5) A˚ , Cu1–N1 2.063(5) A˚ ] are in the normal range for such coordination bonds [20]. The copper centers (Cu1 and Cu1B) are bridged by one ligand and one iodide atom (I2), which forms a dinuclear unit. Signiﬁcantly, a bridging iodide (I2) and two iodide atoms (I1 and I1B) bound to Cu1 and Cu1B are coordinated to Cu2A (the second center), which constructs a Cu3I3 but- terﬂy-shaped unit. The Cu2A atom displays a distorted tetrahedral geometry [the angles vary from 98.15(4) to 122.32(6)] coordinated by I1, I2, I1B atoms and one iodide atom (I2A) from another Cu3I3 butterﬂy-shaped unit [Cu–I ranges from 2.6081(8) A˚ to 2.8054(14) A˚ ]. Then, the [Cu3I3(PTP)] unit extends along the a axis to lead to a 1D chain (CuI)n by means of Cu–I bonds (Fig. 2). The Cu2– donor bond distances are all within normal values. The (CuI)n substructure is a chain structure with Cu3I3 butterﬂy- shaped unit which is different from other 1D chains such as split stair chain, zigzag chain, helical chain, staircase chain, rack chain and column [24–27]. To our best knowl- edge, Complex 1 is the ﬁrst example of a linear chain structure motif formed by trinuclear Cu3I3 unit in copper(I) chemistry. In complex 1, the ligand adopts a pronounced syn twist, creating an angle of 67.1(1) between two pyridine planes and angles of 42.8(1) between the pyridine planes and the Fig. 1 a Perspective view of the coordination environment of Cu(I) center, I atoms and ligands in 1 (displacement ellipsoids drawn at 30% probability).

In ﬁve chelate ring N2–N2B–Cu1– I2–Cu1B, iodide atom is linked to two copper centers in an l2-fashion, with a Cu_Cu separation of 3.081 A˚ and a Cu–I–Cu bridge angle of 69.72(4). In the Cu3I3 butterﬂy- shaped unit, the iodine atoms bridge the Cu(I) atoms either in a l2-mode or in a l4-mode, and the Cu_Cu distances are all 2.7258(13) A˚ . From the above discussion, we may conclude that the formation of the Cu3I3 butterﬂy-shaped unit owes to the role of the iodine bridge and the chelate nature of the ligand. 3.1.2 Crystal Structure of Complex [HgI2(PTP)]n (2) The X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic form with space group C2/c and has an inﬁnite one-dimensional helical chain motif. The coordination environment of Hg(II) atom in complex 2 is depicted in Fig. 3a. It can be clearly seen that each Hg(II) atom is in a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment comprised of two N atoms from two different PTP ligands and two iodide from HgI2 with Hg–I and Fig. 2 View of the (CuI)n skeleton with Cu3I3 butterﬂy- shaped unit in 1 Fig. 3 a Perspective view of the coordination environment of Hg(II) center, I atoms and ligands in 2 (displacement ellipsoids drawn at 30% probability). Symmetry code for A: -x ? 1, y, -z ? 3/2; B: -x ? 1, y, -z ? 5/2; b Perspective view of the 1D helical chain structure of 2 240 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2011) 21:237–243 123 Hg–N bond distances of 2.6576(6) and 2.547(4) A˚ , respectively. Complex 2 has a compressed N–Hg–N angle of 96.6(2) and an expanded I–Hg–I angle of 144.01(2), and its Hg–N bond lengths are longer than those observed in the reported Hg(II) complexes with N and I donors [28–31]. In the solid state, HgI2 units are connected to each other by cis-PTP ligands through the pyridyl nitrogen atoms into a one-dimensional chain along the crystallographic c axis (Fig. 3b). The ligand adopts a pronounced twist, creating an angle of 22.6 between two pyridine planes and angles of 81.3 between the pyridine planes and the pyridazine plane. The two pyridyl groups in PTP are not coplanar, and the bending of the ligand and its coordination at the Hg(II) center result in a 1D chain that adopts a helical twist. Interestingly, two helical single chains form a double helix structure (Fig. 4a). These double helix chains are further assembled to form a quasi 2D network by C–H_I hydro- gen bonds involving the 3-H and 4-H atoms of pyridazine rings and the terminal iodide atoms [the distances and angle: C_I 4.049 A˚ , H_I 3.118 A˚ , C–H_I 170.9] (Fig. 4b) [32]. The intrachain Hg_Hg contact is 9.971 A˚ , while the shortest interpolymer Hg_Hg distance is 7.520 A˚ . The shortest intrachain I_I contact found in 2 is 5.055(1) A˚ . All these double helical chains exactly stack together along the crystallographic c-axis instead of the single helix [31, 33] and triple helix structure [34]. In complexes 1 and 2, the ligand adopts a very similar cis-conformation, but their conformation has a subtle dif- ference (Fig. S1). The difference may be the consequence of this rotation of the pyridine plane, and this meant that the PTP ligand could readily adopt two different confor- mations in complexes 1 and 2, respectively. So, the Fig. 4 a The double helicalchains in 2; b the quasi 2D network packed from the double helical chains through intermolecular C–H_I hydrogen bonds in 2 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2011) 21:237–243 241 123 ﬂexibility and multimodal nature of the PTP ligand play a positive role in the formation of 1 and 2. 3.2 Thermal Analyses Thermal stability and decomposition behaviors of both complexes have been studied by TG-DTA in the ﬂowing atmosphere of N2. The TG-DTA curves of the complex 1 were illustrated in Fig. S2. The decomposition of complex 1 occurs in the temperature range from 30 to 800 C. The ﬁrst step starts at 228.9 and ends at 432.6 C with an exothermic DTA peak at 272.2 C, which was accompanied by a weight loss of 25.4%. This may attribute to the loss of the pyr- idylthio moiety of the ligand PTP (calcd. 25.33%). The decomposition of the residual complex 1 is observed in the subsequent stages. In the temperature range 447.1–795.3 C the weight loss is 31.9%. This may corresponds to the elimination of the pyridazine ring moiety of the ligand PTP and the intermediate product (CuI)n framework (calcd. 31.10%). The residual material weight of 42.8% may be the residue (CuI)n framework (calcd. 43.79%). The decomposition of complex 2 undergoes two step process (Fig. S3). The complex 2 is thermally stable up to 129.3 C and the ﬁrst mass loss takes place between 129.3 and 196.5 C with an endothermic DTA peak at 146.2 C. The experimental mass loss of 11.1% may correspond to the elimination of the pyridazine ring moiety of the ligand PTP (calcd. 10.64%). The second stage in the range 209.3–783.7 C is the gradual decomposition of the residual complex 2 with the weight loss of 88.9% (calcd. 89.36%), and 100% weight loss was observed. From the TG-DTA study results of complexes 1 and 2, the decomposition process are different. The results may be due to the different coordination mode of the ligand PTP. Comparing their structures, the N atoms of the pyridylthio moiety of the two complexes are all bond to metal ion, but two N atoms of the pyridazine ring moiety are bond to metal ion in complex 1 and non-coordinated to metal ion in complex 2. So, the thermal stability of the non-coordinated pyridazine ring moiety of complex 2 is less than that of the coordinated moieties of the two complexes, while the thermal stability of coordinated pyridazine ring is more than that of pyridylthio moiety in complex 1. Then, the pyridazine ring moiety is lost ﬁrstly and the pyridylthio moiety loss is observed in the second stage in complex 2, but the decomposition of complex 1 is quite the contrary. Consequently, the decomposition process occurs at such different temperatures between the two complexes. 3.3 Optical Properties Optical diffuse-reﬂection spectra were measured at room temperature. The absorption (a/S) data were calculated from the reﬂectance using the Kubelka–Munk function, a/S = (1 - R)2/2R [35]. The optical band gaps (Eonset) obtained by extrapolation of the linear portion of the absorption edges are estimated as 1.8 eV for 1 and 3.3 eV for 2 (Fig. 5). The band gap of 1 is less than values of the low temperature c-CuI (3.1 eV) which exhibits the prop- erties of the semiconductor [36], and this suggests that complex 1 has good semiconductor property. The different band gaps of 1 and 2 might be the result of their different metal polymeric structures. 4 Conclusions Two interesting d10 metal complexes of 3,6-bis(2-pyridyl- thio)pyridazine ligand (PTP), [Cu3I3(PTP)]n (1) and [HgI2(PTP)]n (2), have been synthesized and characterized. Single-crystal X-ray analyses show that two complexes are both 1D chain coordination polymer. Complex 1 is a linear chain structure motif constructed from trinuclear Cu3I3 butterﬂy-shaped unit. Complex 2 is one-dimensional heli- cal chain structure. Their structure differences should be the result of two major factors. One is the ﬂexibility and multimodal nature of the ligand, and the other is the co- ordination preference nature of distinct metal ion. The ﬂexible ligand PTP provides two donor regions, and this arrangement allows for the unconstrained formation of dinuclear unit in complex 1 and polymeric complex 2. In complex 1, the chelate nature of the ﬂexible ligand PTP and the role of the iodine bridge results in the formation of trinuclear Cu3I3 butterﬂy-shaped unit. In complex 2, the ﬂexibility of the ligand allows for the more effective use of donor atoms and results in hydrogen bonding employed to link the double helical chain structure into sheet. Optical diffuse-reﬂection spectra of two Complexes were mea- sured, and the band gaps of 1 and 2 suggest that complex 1 exhibits the property of the semiconductor. 2 3 4 5 6 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 2 1 α /S Energy(eV) Fig. 5 Solid-state optical absorption spectra of complexes 1 and 2 242 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2011) 21:237–243 123 5 Supplementary Material Tables of atomic coordinates, an isotropic thermal parame- ters, and complete bond distances and angles have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic data center, and CCDC Nos. 790849 and 790850 for complexes 1 and 2.
