Manuscript ORIGINAL RESEARCH Silver coordination polymers with remarkably high packing coefﬁcients Yutian Wang • Mihaela S¸erb • Ulli Englert Received: 11 September 2009 / Accepted: 20 November 2009 / Published online: 6 December 2009  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009 Abstract Silver meso- and rac-tartrate and silver squa- rate have been synthesized, and the crystal structure of a new polymorph of the latter is reported. Three reaction products of these silver salts with pyrazine have been obtained and structurally characterized: From silver squa- rate, a chain polymer with linear coordination of Ag(I) by two pyrazine ligands is formed, whereas the silver tartrates yield solids in which the inner coordination sites around the metal are only partially occupied by N donors; in contrast to expectation, oxygen coordination prevails. All the four new Ag(I) coordination compounds reported show high packing coefﬁcients in the range between 0.789 and 0.885. In order to put these results into a meaningful context, packing coefﬁcients for the crystal structures of almost 30,000 compounds retrieved from the Cambridge Struc- tural Database have been determined. Tartrates pack sig- niﬁcantly closer than pyrazine complexes or metal- containing compounds in general. The exceptionally high packing coefﬁcient of the new polymorph of silver squarate is due to stacking of anions and concomitant AgAg contacts, both along the shortest lattice parameter which amounts to only 3.3990(9) A˚ . Keywords High packing coefﬁcients  Silver coordination polymers  Pyrazine complexes  Silver squarate  Silver tartrates Introduction Coordination polymers currently attract considerable inter- est in view of their potential applications [1–3], their unmatched versatility in building up extended structures [4–8]andtheirfascinatingdynamicbehaviour[9–11].Inaddi- tion to coordination networks based on one type of cations, more complex bimetallic systems have also been described [12–16]. Polymers based on silver cations are particularly attractive: Their lability facilitates crystallization and dissolution processes [17], and closed-shell interactions between Ag(I) cations have recently emerged as candidates for crystal engineering [18–20]. These AgAg contacts around 3 A˚ distance have been referred to as argentophilic [18, 19, 21–23] interactions, and their contribution to lattice energy has been compared to that of hydrogen bonds [24]. The fast-growing ﬁeld of silver coordination polymers has been covered by several review articles [17, 25, 26] and even by a special issue in the Australian Journal of Chemistry [27]. Owing to their pronounced preference for linear coor- dination, Ag(I) cations are well-suited metal centres for the synthesis of coordination polymers even with usually chelating ligands such as trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane [28–31]. In our earlier study, we have used silver salts of weakly coordinating anions, amongst them silver acetate [28] and alkylbenzoates [32] as starting materials. The suc- cessful preparation of Ag(I) oligomers via reaction of silver 4-aminobenzoate and 4,40-bipyridine [33] supports the idea that bidentate N donor ligands can, in general, replace the harder oxygen atoms in the coordination sphere of silver Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11224-009-9564-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Having this concept in mind, we prepared the silver squarate 1 and tartrates 2a and 2b and studied their reaction products with pyrazine, the compounds 3, 4a and 4b. Synthesis, composition and ste- reochemistry of the coordination polymers prepared in the context of this study are shown in Scheme 1. In this contribution, the crystal structures of 1, a new polymorph of silver squarate, and the pyrazine complexes 3, 4a and 4b are reported. Only in the case of compound 3, the coordination of the silver cations is unexceptional, with an essentially linear N–Ag–N core. In contrast, the N donor pyrazine is only partially involved in the coordination spheres around the metal in 4a and 4b. The unusual coordination of the Ag(I) cations in the latter two com- pounds will be described, and we will discuss the highly efﬁcient packing of all the four solids in the context of a comprehensive study based on data from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) [34]. Efﬁcient space ﬁlling represents an important aspect of solids in general and a relevant driving force for the formation of coordination polymers as evidenced by single-crystal-to-single-crystal reactions [9] and phase transitions [10, 35]. It can also be regarded as one of the decisive criteria for the stabilization of a given polymorph of a compound [36, 37]. Experimental Chemicals and reagents Silver carbonate, squaric acid, rac- and meso-tartaric acids and pyrazine were purchased and used without further puriﬁcation. Synthesis and characterization IR spectra were recorded with a Nicolet Avatar 360 E.S.P. FT instrument as nujol mulls; nujol mulls were preferred over KBr pellets to avoid artefacts due to formation of AgBr in the samples. Absorption bands are reported in cm-1. Elemental analyses were carried out on a Heraeus CHNO-Rapid apparatus. 1, Ag2(C4O4), squarato-disilver(I): To 827 mg (3.0 mmol) of Ag2CO3 suspended in 100 mL of H2O:CH3CN = 1:1 at 70 C, an excess of squaric acid (ca. 6 mmol) is added. The reaction mixture is reﬂuxed for 30 min and ﬁltered whilst hot. The ﬁltrate is evaporated to dryness, and the colourless solid is washed three times with 20 mL of water.

After 2 days, light yellow crystals suitable for X-ray dif- fraction are obtained by isothermal evaporation. 2a and 2b can be prepared by a similar procedure as 1 from Ag2CO3 and the corresponding tartaric acid. Owing to their low solubilities yields of 1, 2a and 2b are almost quantitative with respect to Ag2CO3. 3, Ag(C4H4N2)(C4O3OH), hydrogensquarato-pyrazine- silver(I): A solution of 80 mg (1.0 mmol) of pyrazine in 10 mL of water is added dropwise to a solution of 327 mg (1.0 mmol) 1 in 20 mL H2O:CH3CN = 1:1 at room tem- perature.

General properties of 1, 3, 4a and 4b The compounds described in this article are remarkably stable to light, and no decomposition was observed during exposure to X-rays. Crystals of 1 undergo a very slow colour change from light yellow to olive green over a period of almost 1 year, but their diffraction pattern still corresponds to that of the freshly prepared solid. 1, 3, 4a and 4b do not melt but decompose under formation of metallic silver; the ther- mal stability of the squarato complexes 1 and 3 exceeds that of the tartrato derivatives 4a and 4b. In contrast to their behaviour in acetonitrile, water solubility is rather low for all coordination polymers reported in this study: From a satu- rated aqueous solution of the most insoluble compound 4a not even AgCl may be precipitated. Only crystals of 1 show a tendency to non-merohedral twinning. Crystallographic studies Compounds 1, 3, 4a and 4b have been studied by single- crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystals were mounted on glass ﬁbres and placed directly in a cold stream of dinitrogen. Crystal data, parameters of data collection and convergence results are listed in Table 1. Intensity data were collected with a Bruker Smart APEX CCD (Mo-Ka radiation, k = 0.71073 A˚ , graphite monochromator) area detector on a D8 goniometer in the x scan mode. A temperature of 130(2) K was maintained during all the data collections with the help of an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream 700 cooler. Multi-scan absorption corrections were performed by MULABS as implemented in PLATON [38] or by SADABS [39]. The structures were solved by direct methods (SHELXS97) [40] and reﬁned by full matrix least-squares on F2 (SHELXL97) [40]. Non-hydrogen atoms were assigned anisotropic displacement parameters, and H atoms were introduced in their idealized positions and reﬁned using a riding model. The positions of the hydrogen atoms in the hydrate water molecule in 4b were obtained as local maxima of electron density in a Fourier difference synthesis; the O–H bond distances were idealized to 0.84 A˚ . These positions are in agreement with classical hydrogen bonds between the water oxygen atom and two close acceptors. Relevant local maxima and minima in the ﬁnal Fourier difference syntheses for 3, 4a and 4b were located in close proximity of the Ag cations, cf Table 1. Searches in the CSD [34] refer to Version 5.29, including the updates of January 2008, with a total of 436384 entries. All the searches were restricted to error- free data without disorder and to entries for which 3D coordinates were available. Calculations concerning space ﬁlling properties were performed with PLATON, using van der Waals parameters of 1.70 for C, 1.20 for H, 1.55 for N, 1.52 for O and 1.70 A˚ for Ag. For the van der Waals radius of the metal, we refer to our earlier study [28]. Bondi has suggested a similar (1.72 A˚ ) [41] and Batsanov [42], a larger value (2.0 A˚ ).

Results and discussion We will ﬁrst describe the experimentally observed crystal structures and then discuss their space-ﬁlling properties with respect to the information retrieved from the CSD. Reaction of Ag2CO3 with squaric acid provided excellent crystals of the silver squarate 1. Robl and Weiss [43] had obtained crystals of the same chemical composition by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium squarate. According to these authors, silver squarate shows polymorphism: They had studied a yellow modiﬁcation by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and mentioned an alternative white modiﬁcation which had not been further characterized due to inferior crystal quality. The solid obtained by us [44] differs from the yellow modiﬁcation of Robl and Weiss with respect to lat- tice parameters, symmetry, and coordination of the silver cation. 1 might either correspond to the second modiﬁcation described as colourless by the earlier authors or represent, yet, another polymorph. 1 shows higher density and a smaller unit cell volume per formula unit than the yellow modiﬁcation from the literature. The asymmetric unit of our silver squarate contains one cation in general and a dianion in special position, located on a crystallographic centre of inversion. The projection of the crystal structure on the bc plane in Fig. 1, left, shows that each dianion binds to six Ag(I) cations, and that, in agreement with the stoichiometry Struct Chem (2010) 21:203–211 205 123 of the solid, each cation is coordinated by O donors of three squarates. Inspection from both view directions along [100] and [010] in Fig. 1 allows to address 1 as a three-dimen- sional solid. Squarates and cations are translated along the short lattice parameter a which amounts to only 3.4 A˚ . The coordination polyhedron around the Ag(I) cation is represented in Fig. 2: The closest oxygen donors O1a, O2 and O2d, corresponding to the three coordinating squarates associated with Ag–O bonds shorter than 2.5 A˚ form an acute triangle, with two larger and one smaller O–Ag–O angle. In the absence of alternative N donor atoms, this coordination is not surprising. In this and the following ﬁgures which summarize silver coordination, not only conventional bonds between metal cations and donor ligands have been included for good reason: In recent con- tributions by our own [16, 28] and other groups [18, 19, 21, 22, 45], AgAg distances of ca 3 A˚ have been discussed; it is obviously not acceptable to emphasize interactions of this Table 1 Crystal data, data collection parameters and convergence results for compounds 1, 3, 4a and 4b Compound 1 3 4a 4b Empirical formula C2O2Ag C16H10N4O8Ag2 C12H12N2O12Ag4 C12H15N2O13Ag4 Formula weight 163.89 602.02 807.72 826.74 Crystal size (mm) 0.260.150.07 0.410.030.02 0.220.170.03 0.220.040.04 Crystal colour and habit Light yellow rod Yellow needle Colourless plate Colourless rod Crystal system Monoclinic Triclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Space group P21/c P-1 P21/n P2/n a (A˚ ) 3.3990(9) 7.102(3) 9.9947(15) 15.392(3) b (A˚ ) 6.5186(17) 10.403(4) 10.2858(16) 6.2359(8) c (A˚ ) 11.159(3) 12.502(4) 16.355(3) 19.822(3) a () 98.195(5) b () 99.619(7) 104.413(5) 99.536(2) 108.350(2) c () 106.921(4) V 243.77(11) 832.5(5) 1658.2(4) 1805.9(4) Z 4 2 4 4 q (gcm-3) 4.466 2.402 3.235 3.041 l (Mo Ka) (mm-1) 7.955 2.414 4.732 4.352 F(000) 300 584 1528 1572 h range () 3.6–26.4 2.4–26.5 2.2–30.9 2.8–30.7 Reﬂs. collected 1371 8725 24215 25284 Rint 0.0205 0.1144 0.0433 0.0521 Unique reﬂs. in ref. 495 3443 4878 5284 Reﬂs. with I [ 2r(I) 475 1953 4116 4287 Param. reﬁned 47 271 271 280 R1 (2r(I)) 0.0155 0.0624 0.0334 0.0430 R1 (all data) 0.0166 0.1152 0.0415 0.0538 wR2 0.0436 0.1048 0.0815 0.1149 Goodness of ﬁt 1.000 0.956 1.023 1.048 Diff. peak/hole (e/A˚ 3) 0.445/-0.703 1.103/-1.779 2.522/-1.162 3.443/-1.995 (1.03 A˚ from Ag1) (0.73 A˚ from Ag2) (0.70 A˚ from Ag4) CCDC 722189 722190 722191 722192 Fig. 1 Packing in 1.

We agree with those authors who interpret AgO distances of ca. 2.8 A˚ as weak interactions [46, 47]. When compared to other salts with organic anions, the calculated density of 1 is remarkably high: Our silver squarate ranks ninth amongst 3755 carbon-containing entries for which silver is the heaviest element documented in the CSD; four of the eight entries associated with a higher density refer to the same compound, namely silver oxalate. Signiﬁcantly higher densities are only encountered for inorganic silver salts. Reaction of 1 with the bidentate ligand pyrazine pro- ceeds in line with the ideas discussed in the Introduction: The oxygen atoms are displaced from the inner Ag(I) coordination in favour of two pyrazine N atoms, and a one- dimensional polymer is formed, which extends along the crystallographic [100] direction. The asymmetric unit of 3 contains two Ag(I) cations, two pyrazine ligands and two hydrogensquarate monoanions rather than fully deproto- nated squarates as in 1. The anions are linked via weak Ag– O interactions to the polycationic chains. Figure 3 shows the overall arrangement of the constituents in the crystal structure of 3. The coordination environments around the symmetri- cally independent metal cations are represented in Fig. 4. They are both characterized by a rather conventional, almost linear arrangement of two close N donors and show only minor differences with respect to secondary interac- tions. Closest AgAg distances are only slightly shorter than twice the van der Waals radius of Ag(I). In analogy to its reaction with squaric acid, silver car- bonate and either rac or meso-tartaric acid afford the cor- responding silver tartrates. However, reaction of these salts 2a and 2b with pyrazine did not afford simple polymers based on Ag–pyrazine–Ag chains analogous to the structure of 3, but rather resulted in the formation of the unexpected Fig. 2 Ag coordination in 1.

These reaction products share a remarkable common feature: Both compounds contain four independent Ag(I) cations in the asymmetric unit. Despite the presence of the N donor pyrazine, two of these metal centres remain exclusively coordinated by oxygen. The other two cations are associated with a complex coor- dination sphere to which both N and O donor atoms con- tribute. Figures 5 and 6 provide detailed information about the Ag coordination; weak interactions have deliberately been taken into account. It is important to note that the experimental section compiles the most efﬁcient syntheses for 4a and 4b, established after the characterization of the products. The same compounds are obtained, however, when an excess of pyrazine is used. Even under these conditions, coordination of the Ag(I) cations is largely based on O donors, although a sufﬁcient amount of potential N donor sites of the pyr- azine ligand is available. In the case of 4b, only N2 bonded to Ag3 originates from pyrazine, whereas N1 represents the terminal nitrogen atom of an acetonitrile molecule. Ace- tonitrile has been used as a solvent in all the preparations but only appears as a constituent in the crystal structure of 4b. In this solid, three different ligands, the N donors pyrazine and acetonitrile and the O donor tartrate, compete for silver coordination. In agreement with the substoichiometric content of the N donor pyrazine, tartrate dianions represent the dominant bridging ligands in 4a and 4b. Figure 7 (see also Fig. S1 in the supplementarymaterial)depictsthe packingintherac-tartrate 4a and shows how the dicarboxylates link cations to layers in the ac plane, with the shortest AgO bonds in [101] direction. Interlayercontactsalong[010]areestablishedbypyrazineand ligand-unsupported AgAg interactions of ca. 3 A˚ . The leading structural motif associated with the shortest Ag–O bonds in 4a and 4b consists in silver carboxylate dimers shown in Fig. 8. These moieties resemble the classical carboxylic acid dimer synthon [48, 49], with Ag(I) cations rather than protons connecting pairs of oxy- gen atoms in a slightly less linear fashion. In 4b, the AgAg separation within this moiety is rather short and amounts to only 2.8 A˚ . This dicarboxylatodisilver synthon links the tartrate anions to chains in the direction of the crystallographic b axis in 4b; in addition, the metal centres in this compound are engaged in alternating acetonitrile and pyrazine coor- dination in [100] direction.

Compound 4b is a stable monohydrate: The water molecule acts as a donor for two and as an acceptor for one classical hydrogen bond. It occupies a remarkably small void of only 15 A˚ 3. The reversibly released water molecule in a Eu complex has been associated with a larger volume of 30 A˚ 3 [50].

The program can easily be scripted, and non-default values for van der Waals radii may be used (see Experimental). Obviously, sensible van der Waals radii represent a prerequisite for calculating reasonable numbers for the Kitaigorodskii packing coefﬁcients. In order to ensure a statistically relevant comparison with the situation in our crystalline solids, we calculated packing coefﬁcients for several classes of potentially related compounds; the calcu- lations were based on all matching entries in the CSD for which coordinates were available, cf. Experimental. Our calculations include all metal tartrates, all pyrazine metal complexes, all metal squarates and ﬁnally, the large sample of all metal compounds studied at low temperatures. The results are summarized in Table 2. The results indicate that higher packing coefﬁcients may be expected for tartrates, albeit the signiﬁcance of this observation is somewhat lim- ited due to the relatively small number of compounds in this class. The results for 4a and 4b are in line with this observation. The silver squarate 1 exhibits the highest packing coefﬁcient amongst the compounds reported here. This very efﬁcient space-ﬁlling cannot be explained in terms of its constituents and is rather due to a combination of favourable facts. For the polymorph described earlier by Robl and Weiss [43], a slightly lower packing coefﬁcient of 0.839 is calculated. Generally spoken, voids in molecular crystals occur between rather than within molecular frag- ments. In 1, the squarate dianions and hence the covalent bonds roughly extend in the bc plane, and a, the lattice parameter orthogonal to this plane, amounts to only 3.3990(9) A˚ . In the case of 1, which does not contain any hydrogen atoms, such a short repeat unit necessarily stacks all the atoms in the unit cell at a distance similar to the double van der Waals radius, i.e. in touch with neighbours generated by translation: No major vacancies exist in the bc plane, and no voids are generated after stacking subsequent layers; consequently, the new polymorph of silver squarate is remarkably efﬁcient with respect to space ﬁlling. In the CSD database, only 18 error-free structures with 3D coordinates are documented, which feature any lattice parameter shorter than 3.4 A˚ . Three of these compounds are metal squarates [52–54], which differ from our solid with respect to stoichiometry and/or packing; nevertheless, they all are associated with high packing coefﬁcients ranging from 0.849 to 0.866. Yuﬁt and colleagues [52] have noticed the fact that their compound is close packed: Its lattice parameters remained almost constant upon cooling.
