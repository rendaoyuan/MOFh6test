Introduction Non-molecular solids such as coordination polymers (CPs) and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been attracting considerable importance since Yaghi et al. reported the ﬁrst family of MOFs with large porosity and high surface areas.1 Majority of CPs and MOFs are grown from solution either under ambient or solvother- mal/hydrothermal condition. A signiﬁcant structural feature of all these solids is the occurrence of extended metal-ligand interactions analogous to supramolecular synthons2 with varying dimensionality. Robson was the ﬁrst one to recognize metal-ligand interaction as an effective tool to build multi-dimensional coordina- tion polymers.3 Yaghi exploited the utility of coordi- nation linkages such as metal-carboxylate and metal- nitrogen to construct porous 3-D MOF solids.4,5 In recent years, these zeolite-analogues turned out to be promising materials with greater ﬂexibility and pro- visions to incorporate multiple functionality.6 In con- trast to organic solids, crystallization of metal organic solids is quite complex and involves several competing reactions with different rates. To interpret a crystal synthesis, it is important to analyze the aggregation pro- cess leading to a crystal nucleus in terms of ‘chemically reasonable molecular bricks’ from a chemical soup. ∗For correspondence Our group has developed a retrosynthetic approach to interpret the supramolecular aggregation during the crystallization of several metal organic solids.7–10 We demonstrated its usefulness with many examples drawn from literature and crystals grown in our own group to construe the molecular events preceding crystalliza- tion by invoking possible ‘chemical bricks’ that even- tually lead to the ﬁnal condensed product from a solu- tion. The present work is an attempt to investigate the structural landscape of the system CuIIXn (X=SO4 or Cl)–ligand–H2O with an objective to explore the role of the synthons–Cu–OSO3– or –Cu–Cl–in engineering extended structural units of the type –X-Cu–X–Cu–. Further, we wanted to probe the competing nature of these with the desirable synthon –L-Cu– which is responsible for the formation of CPs and MOFs. Our earlier analysis of several copper organic solids sug- gested that synthons of the type –Cu–OSO3– and–Cu– Cl– also compete with –Cu–L– (L-multidentate organic compound) in engineering non-molecular solids.8,9 A CSD analysis showed 11 and 19 hits respectively for extended –Cu–OSO3– and –Cu–Cl– interactions in non-molecular copper organic solids.10 In this paper, we discuss our recent results on the crystallization of a few copper-based coordination solids grown on the basis of our rationale and describe its crystal structures providing molecular insights. The choice of sulphate and chloride anion is particularly signiﬁcant as they can inﬂuence supramolecular assembly in two ways: either 1433 1434 Vineet Kumar et al. it directly coordinates with copper or may occur as counteranion. Theorganic ligands chosen were both non- bridging (pyrazole, imidazole and 1,10-phenanthroline) and bridging (glutamic acid). Our previous experiences showed that the use of ligands like 4,4′-bipyridine or pyrazine favoured extended –Cu–L–Cu– linkages resulting in coordination polymers. In a few cases, the bridging ligands compete with halide ions to form extended interactions.11 ,12 In this paper, we discuss the structural chemistry of four new coordination solids including one chiral coordination polymer providing molecular insights. 2. Experimental 2.1 Synthesis All the chemicals were bought and used without further puriﬁcation. CuSO4.5H2O(0.375g, 1.5 mmol) was dissolved in17 mL of water and the organic ligand (1.5 mmol) was added to this aqueous solution while being stirred. The resultant solution was then trans- ferred to Teﬂon-lined stainless steel digester and heated at 150◦C for 3 days. The contents were cooled to room temperature and allowed for crystallization at room temperature. For the synthesis of 1, [Cu(1,10-phen)SO4 (H2O)2],1,10-phenanthroline (0.270g, 1.5 mmol); for the synthesis of 2, [{Cu(pz)4SO4}{Cu(pz)4SO4(H2O)}]. H2O, pyrazole (0.102g, 1.5 mmol) and for the synthesis of 3, [Cu(imi)4SO4], imidazole (0.102 g, 1.5 mmol) were used as organic ligands. Blue coloured single crys- tals suitable for X-ray diffraction study were obtained in all the three cases. For the synthesis of 4, [Cu(imi)4 (NO3)2], Cu(NO3)2. 3H2O (0.360 g, 1.5 mmol) was used as copper source and imidazole (0.102 g, 1.5 mmol) was used as organic ligand under similar conditions as for the synthesis of 1, 2 and 3. Synthesis of 5, [Cu(glu) Cl(H2O)] was carried by grinding as well as slow eva- poration method. Here CuCl2.2H2O (0.170 g, 1 mmol) was taken as copper source and glutamic acid (0.147 g, 1 mmol) was used as organic ligand. We employed D, L and DL glutamic acid in our synthesis. The reactants were ground in a mortar and pestle, dissolved in 10 mL water and kept for crystallization. Dark blue coloured single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained after 4-5 days. When we used D or L glutamic acid, crystallization yielded either right-handed or left-handed helices as conﬁrmed by structural analysis. However, use of racemic DL acid resulted in sponta- neous resolution leading to a mixture of right-handed and left-handed helices. Schemes 1 and 2 summarize the experimental condition for the growth of all solids reported in this study. 2.2 X-ray crystallography X-ray diffraction study of a crystal mounted on a capillary was carried out on a BRUKER AXS SMART-APEX diffractometer with a CCD area detec- tor (MoKα: 0.71073 Å, monochromator: graphite).13 Table 1.

Results and Discussion Crystallization from a solution containing copper sulphate and organic ligand (1,10-phenanthroline, pyrazole and imidazole) yielded two new non- molecular solids, [{Cu(pz)4SO4}{Cu(pz)4SO4(H2O)}]. H2O2 and [Cu(imi)4SO4] 3 and one known solid [Cu(1, 10-phen)SO4(H2O)2] 1 (scheme 1). An interesting fea- ture of the three solids is the occurrence of extended copper–sulphate interaction leading to 1-D chains. The chains, however pack differently depending on the nature of secondary non-covalent forces exhibited by the organic groups. The solid 1 is identical to the com- pound already reported in the literature except that our synthesis involves only reaction of copper source with the organic ligand.17 The previous report does not consider the extended interaction between cop- per and sulphate. In 1, a strong H-bonding between a pair of water molecules coordinated with copper and the uncoordinated sulphate oxygens are responsible for almost linear metal–ligand chain (ﬁgure 1). This also facilitates π · · · π interactions between phenanthroline groups to form a sheet. C-H· · · O interactions between the sheets result in a 3-D network for 1. The solid 2 is an interesting example of how the system optimizes crystal packing. The major directing force is still an extended –Cu–OSO3–Cu– interaction to form neutral 1-D chains (ﬁgure 2). However, the presence of pyra- zole groups on copper dictates a different assembly to stabilize the chains. A discrete zwitterionic complex, {Cu(pz)4SO4(H2O)} enters the lattice to pack the chains efﬁciently through weak interactions (S-O· · · H2O and π · · · π). In 3, we employed imidazole, an isomer of pyrazole. The 1:4 copper complex with the azole unit is the same as in 2. Nevertheless, the –N–H group in imidazole is favourable to H-bond with sulphate Figure 2. (a) {Cu(pz)4(SO4)} units interact with sulphate groups to form neutral 1-D chains in 2; the chains are similar to the one observed in 1. (b) Discrete zwitterionic complex, {Cu(pz)4SO4(H2O)} in 2. (c) The discrete neutral complex enters into the supramolecular assembly to stabilize adjacent chains by facilitating favourable interactions between S-O · · · H2O and π · · · π. Design of non-molecular coordination solids 1437 oxygens of adjacent neutral chains (ﬁgure 3). In all the three cases, we obtained only the same solid even when we altered the ligand to metal ratio. We performed another crystallization reaction starting with copper nitrate rather than sulphate. The solid 4 is a molecu- lar solid and favourable H-bonding interactions such as N-H· · · ONO2 and C-H· · · ONO2 dictate the aggrega- tion of the discrete complex, {Cu(imi)4(NO3)2}. The overall H-bonded assembly in 4 is shown in ﬁgure 4. Lack of good quality crystals and probable disorder resulted in poor statistics for 4. Reaction of copper nitrate with 1,10-phenanthroline and pyrazole did not yield any new metal organic solids. It appears that a favourable N-H· · · O with imidazole unit is respon- sible for the isolation of 3. Use of copper chloride resulted in known solids18 for pyrazole and imidazole, [Cu(pz)4Cl2] and [Cu(imi)4Cl2]. With an objective to crystallize new coordination polymers, we attempted reaction of copper sulphate and copper chloride with an amino acid, namely glutamic acid which is chiral and multidentate. One side of glutamic acid is ideal for chelation with copper while the other side can be extended to form a CP. Glu- tamic acid showed different crystallization behaviour when it was reacted with copper chloride and cop- per sulphate (scheme 2). To start with, copper chlo- ride and copper sulphate salts produced different pH when dissolved in aqueous solution. We did not alter pH of initial solution with any external source. In the case of copper chloride, initial pH was around 2 and crystallization led to a blue colour crystal, 5 after a few days. Single crystal X-ray analysis established the compound to be [Cu(glu)Cl(H2O)]. Interestingly, when we increased pH of the initial solution above 5 using dilute NaOH, morphologically different blue colour crystal 6 was obtained. Single crystal X-ray analysis conﬁrmed the solid 6 to be [Cu(glu)(H2O)].H2O. The compound 6 was found to be exactly the same as the one reported earlier by Mizutani et al.19 Whenever we used copper sulphate or copper nitrate as the source, Figure 3. (a) Neutral 1-D chains in 3 also occur through extended –Cu–OSO3– interactions similar to 1 and 2. (b) H-bonding between N-H of the imidazole units and uncoordinated sulphate oxygen stabilizes adjacent chains. The different chains are represented in different colors. 1438 Vineet Kumar et al.

When we attempted a mechanochemical reaction between copper chloride and glutamic acid, we observed a few new peaks along with reactants; the peaks were later identiﬁed to belong to 5. Both 5 and 6 are 1-D coordination polymers crystallizing in the same chiral space group, P212121 Scheme 2. Crystallization of 1-D coordination polymers engineered through the synthon –Cu–glutamate–. * Structure is identical to the phase already reported in the literature but obtained by a different route.19 Design of non-molecular coordination solids 1439 Figure 5. Extended –Cu–glutamate–Cu– interactions are responsible for the occurrence of chiral coordination polymers in 5 and 6. (a) In 5, two independent helices occur, favoured through extended –Cu–glutamate–Cu– and –Cu–Cl– Cu– running parallel to each other almost on the same plane (Hydrogen atoms and tail of glutamic acid are removed for clarity). (b) In 6, the helices occur only through –Cu–glutamate–Cu– interactions as in solid 5; however, the interaction is different in nature. with an absolute structure parameter (Flack parameter) of ∼0.00. Crystal structures of 5 and 6 showed a remarkable self assembly induced by the counter anion as well as the organic ligand (ﬁgure 5). In 5, two alter- nate helical chains are observed – one formed through extended –Cu–Cl–Cu– and another through –Cu– L–Cu–. A signiﬁcant characteristic is that both chloride and glutamate bridge adjacent copper ions forming two independent helical chains. Copper forms a chelate with N and a carboxylate oxygen while the other carboxy- late oxygen is coordinated to a different copper thereby Figure 6. In 5, the sheets containing the helices are fur- ther connected through a favorable H-bonding between the uncoordinated carboxylic acid unit and water molecule and oxygen coordinated to copper. leading toa helical chain (ﬁgure 5). The terminal car- boxylic acid group of the amino acid stabilizes these sheets through a favourable H-bonding (ﬁgure 6). In 6, the crystal structure shows a different helical chain. In this reaction, the building block during aggregation is {Cu(glu)(H2O)4}+ with no Cl attached to copper. To compensate for charge compensation, the complex becomes zwitterionic releasing the proton from the terminal carboxylic acid group. Formation of 1-D Figure 7. In 6, the two sheets containing the helices are further connected through a favorable H-bonding one lat- tice water works as bridge between two coordinated water molecules. 1440 Vineet Kumar et al. Figure 8. Supramolecular condensation in solid 5 is analyzed through a ret- rosynthetic approach. The copper chelate, {Cu(glu)Cl(H2O)3} is the building block in 5. A favourable –Cu–glutamate–Cu– and –Cu–Cl– Cu– interactions are responsible for the particular assembly with a pair of independent helices observed in 5. Figure 9. Supramolecular condensation in solid 6 is analyzed through a retrosynthetic approach. The copper chelate, {Cu(glu)(H2O)4} is the building block in 6. The absence of Cl in the complex dictates a different assembly in 6. Extended –Cu–glutamate–Cu–is still the major directing force forming 1-D helical chains. In 6, all carboxylate oxygens are involved in extended metal–ligand interactions. Design of non-molecular coordination solids 1441 helical chain is still a favourable direction to assemble. However, the system opts for the free carboxylate group at the tail for favourable coordination with neighbour- ing complex. To further strengthen the 1-D chains, a lattice water comes into play for efﬁcient packing resulting in the overall composition for the solid 6 as [Cu(glu)(H2O)].H2O. The structural chemistry of the solids 5 and 6 clearly demonstrate how a combination of different forces, a strong metal–ligand interaction and a directional weak H-bonding dictate the outcome of a crystallization reaction (ﬁgures 7, 8 and 9). 3.1 Magnetic properties The temperature dependent magnetic susceptibilities of 5 and 6 were recorded over a range of 300–3K. χ−1 M versus T plots for 5 and 6 are shown in ﬁgure 10. The observed effective magnetic moment at tempera- ture 298 K for solid 5 and 6 are 2.58 and 2.14. The magnetic susceptibility data of 5 and 6 obey the Curie- Weiss law, χM = C/(T −θ) (C = 0.6730 emu mol−1 K, θ = –10.80 K for 5, and C = 0.5776 emu mol−1 K, θ = – 7.19 K for 6. The small Weiss constants in these complexes reveal the weak anti-ferromagnetic interactions.The magnetic moments calculated per cop- per(II) was found to be higher than the spin only value of 1.73 BM; this may be due to larger g values. A few coordination polymers show higher magnetic moments arising from g values greater than 2.0.20 Detailed mag- netic characterization on single crystals combined with ESR analysis and calculation is required to understand the origin of magnetic ordering in these compounds. It should be noted, a few non-molecular solids con- taining extended –Cu–Cl–Cu– chains seem to show interesting magnetic ordering: CuCl2 is multi-ferroic21 and paratacamite, [Cu2Cl(OH)3] is ferrimagnetic below 2K.22 Figure 10. Plot of χ−1 M versus T for the solids 5 and 6. 4. Conclusion The examples described in this paper illustrate the importance of analyzing intermolecular interactions responsible for the isolation of a crystal from mother liquor. Metal–X (X-halide, sulphate, etc.) interactions are competitive synthons to produce extended struc- tures or non-molecular solids and can be judiciously exploited to obtain desirable CPs and MOFs. Retro syn- thetic analysis provides chemical insights into the oper- ation of various intermolecular forces which assemble a particular crystal structure. Inﬂuence of pH and metal source and participation of innocent species present in the mother liquor including solvent molecules in the supramolecular assembly may become obvious once we identify the chemically reasonable building blocks.
