Whereas 1 represents a homochiral single- stranded helicate the related complex 2 shows a typical zigzag chain arrangement. Both structures are character- ized by a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment of the Ag(I) centres each based on a N4 coordination pattern of two ligand molecules. The resulting strands are con- nected by a hydrogen bonding network including ClO4 - anions and solvent molecules forming 2-D layers. Addi- tional p–p and CH–p interactions between the aromatic parts of the ligand molecules give a 3-D arrangement of the packing. In contrast, a discrete dinuclear metallocycle, [Ag2(L2)2](ClO4)2CH3OH (3), has been formed by reac- tion of AgClO4 with L2 when CH2Cl2 in the solvent mix- ture was replaced by CH3OH. Again each Ag(I) has a distorted tetrahedral geometry and is coordinated to two pyridylimine units of two ligand molecules. Additional weak hydrogen bonds involving perchlorate and solvent molecules as well as edge-to-face and face-to-face p–p interactions allow a 3-D packing arrangement. Keywords Silver(I)  Bis(2-pyridylimine) ligands  Self-assembly  Supramolecular chemistry Introduction The coordination chemistry of multifunctional pyridine ligands has been the focus of a considerable number of investigations. One of the main areas of research relates to the self-assembly of corresponding metal complexes, and gaining an understanding of the factors that affect such processes remains a challenge [1, 2]. Among the ligand types used, the bis(2-pyridylimine) mixed donor system linked directly, or by different spacer units, has been of considerable interest [3–24]. This ligand category was introduced by Yoshida and Ichikawa [4] and Hannon et al. [5] in 1997. The ligands are known for their ability to form coordination polymers [6–8], metallocycles [9, 10] as well as single-, double- and triple-stranded or circular helicates [11–24] with various d-block metal ions. Generally, due to its coordination ﬂexibility allowing the design of manifold supramolecular architectures with useful properties, the d10 ion Ag(I) has received increasing attention [25–30]; it has been demonstrated to form a range of different complexes also with structurally related N4-donor ligands to those studied in this work [6–13, 15–19, 21, 24]. Hannon et al. found that L1 forms both a dimeric box-like complex and a double-stranded helicate with Ag(I) in solution [5, 13]. Cheng et al. have succeeded in the characterization of a crystalline dinuclear box-like complex between AgBF4 and L2 [9], whereas Tesouro Vallina and Stoeckli-Evans could isolate a coordination polymer with zigzag motif by Dedicated to Len Lindoy, a remarkable chemist and good friend, on the occasion of his 75th birthday.

Both groups used similar experimental conditions; the solvent was methanol and the concentration ratio of Ag(I) to ligand 1:1. Our interests span ion recognition and binding processes by multifunctional pyridine ligands as well as the build-up of supramolecular assemblies based on both coordinate bond- ing and weak non-covalent interactions [23, 24, 31–35]. We have employed a series of bis-pyridylimine derivatives having different linking elements as building blocks for new supramolecular architectures [23, 24]. As part of our ongoing studies we report herein results of the self-assembly of the two bis(2-pyridylimine) ligands L1 and L2, having a diphenyl methane or a diphenyl ether linkage (Scheme 1), with sil- ver(I) perchlorate. The architecture of three novel Ag(I) complexes and the factors inﬂuencing the self- assembly process in their formation are discussed.

Results and discussion Structure of {[Ag(L1)]ClO4CH3CN}n (1) The reaction of L1 with equimolar amounts of AgClO4 in a 1:1 solvent mixture of CH3CN and CH2Cl2 results in the formation of the coordination polymer 1 having a mono- helical arrangement. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2, each Ag(I) is coordinated by two chelating pyridylimine units of two ligands giving a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. All bond lengths and angles are within the expected ranges, but the different lengths of both Ag– Npyridyl (Ag–N1: 2.412 A˚ , Ag–N29: 2.254 A˚ ) and Ag– Nimine (Ag–N8: 2.302 A˚ , Ag–N22: 2.458 A˚ ) bonds are a precondition for twisting the molecule. In addition the two pyridylimine arms within the ligand molecule are not planar and the diphenyl methane linker shows a strong twist around the central methylene of about 107 leading to opposite directed pyridylimine donor functions and generating helical strands along a-axis. The crystal studied was homochiral and possesses a right-han- ded (P) orientation of the helix. Single helical strands are connected within the ac-plane by an extensive hydrogen bonding network including pairs of one ClO4 - ion and one Fig. 3 Crystal packing of 1 showing the p–p interactions between the single helical strands. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity Fig. 4 ORTEP diagram of the molecular structure of complex 2.

As a result two-dimensional layers are formed. The crystal packing is stabilized by additional p–p stacking interactions (Fig. 3) between phenyl and pyridyl units (Cg6Cg5 distance 3.70 A˚ ; b = 18) as well as pyridyl rings themselves (Cg5Cg4 distance 3.60 A˚ ; b = 19) and CH–p interactions (Table 3) between adjacent phenyl rings (C–HCg distances 2.91–3.12 A˚ ). This Fig. 5 Side view along the b-axis of 2 showing the layers formed by hydrogen bonding network including perchlorate anions and CH2Cl2 molecules and chlorine–p contacts.

Perchlorate anions and dichloromethane molecules are omitted for clarity 348 J Incl Phenom Macrocycl Chem (2011) 71:343–352 123 combination of different weak interactions within complex 1 should be an important factor of inﬂuence in favouring the helical twist of the polymeric chains formed. Structure of {[Ag(L2)]ClO4CH2Cl2}n (2) Under identical experimental conditions as for ligand L1 the reaction of L2 with AgClO4 also gives a coordination polymer with a related composition of {[Ag(L2)]- ClO4CH2Cl2}n (2); again the typical N4 coordination environment of each Ag(I) centre is formed by two ligand molecules (Fig. 4). Also the bond lengths and angles are in the same order of magnitude (Table 4). However, both phenyl rings of the linker are twisted with respect to each other by only 52 and the ligand arms are, in contrast to 1, almost planar; the angles with respect to pyridyl-phenyl planes are 6 and 10. The result is a distinct change of the crystal packing as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. In contrast to the helicate 1, complex 2 forms polymeric zigzag chains which are connected to 2D-layers by an extended hydrogen bonding network that includes the ClO4 - anions and CH2Cl2 molecules (Fig. 5, Table 3). These layers are stabilized by additional rare C–Clp contacts of the solvent CH2Cl2 with the pyridyl units (CClCg distance 3.53 A˚ ) and weak CHO contacts (2.57 A˚ ) between anions and solvent molecules. The two-dimensional layers are stabilized by CH–p interactions (Fig. 6, Table 3) as well as p–p interactions (Cg–Cg distance 3.81 A˚ ; b = 27) along the c-axis. The structure of complex 2 corresponds to a large extent with the previously reported Ag(I) complex by Tesouro Vallina and Stoeckli-Evans having the composition {[Ag(L2)]CF3SO30.4H2O}n [6]. Structure of [Ag2(L2)2](ClO4)2CH3OH (3) In the case of L2 a second Ag(I) complex of composition [Ag2(L2)2](ClO4)2CH3OH (3) has been isolated. In con- trast to the experiments leading to coordination polymers, in this preparation the CH2Cl2 in the solvent mixture was replaced by CH3OH. The molecular structure of the com- plex shown in Fig. 7 is characterized by a cyclic arrange- ment that is closely related to the Ag(I) complex of composition [Ag2(L2)2](BF4)21.5CH3CN described by Cheng et al. [9]. Again both silver (I) ions are coordinated by two pyr- idylimine arms of the two different ligand molecules giving distorted tetrahedral coordination geometries. However, in contrast to the polymers discussed above, a discrete me- tallocycle is formed. Each ligand bridges both Ag(I) cen- tres; one ligand molecule passes above the Ag(I)– Ag(I) axis and the other beneath. Such an arrangement is much more twisted than occurs in the polymer structures. The torsion angle of the two central phenyl rings around the ether oxygen linker is 77, between the related angles in 1 and 2. In contrast, one of the pyridylimine arms is twisted with a pyridyl-phenyl angle of 56 while the second is only moderately twisted with an angle of 19. In analogy to 1 and the related literature example [9] the observed lengths of the Ag–Npyridyl or Ag–Nimine bonds differ by around 0.13 A˚ each (Table 5). The metallocycles are connected by hydrogen bonding interactions including perchlorate anions and methanol solvent molecules Fig. 7 ORTEP plot of the cyclic [Ag2(L2)2]2? cation showing 50% probability displacement ellipsoids.

Due to an occupational disorder of the solvent (a site occupancy of 0.5 is observed in the reﬁnement), methanol molecules are statistically present in every second void only. Strong intermolecular face-to-face p–p interactions between the phenyl rings (Cg7–Cg7 distance 3.58 A˚ ; b = 22) along the a-axis and CH-p interactions (CHCg5 2.88 A˚ ; angle 163) along c-axis result in a 3-D packing arrangement (Fig. 9). Conclusions In this study three different supramolecular silver(I) per- chlorate complexes of two structure-related bis(pyridyli- mine) ligands (L1 and L2) have been successfully synthesized and their structures characterized by X-ray structure analysis. The observed structural motifs shown in Fig. 10 correspond to the known coordination patterns of this ligand type toward Ag(I) [6, 9, 11]. Two kinds of coordination polymers, a single-stranded homochiral helicate 1 and a zigzag-chain arrangement 2, resulting from the two ligands possessing slightly different linking elements for the pyridylimine arms (CH2 in L1 against O in L2) could be identiﬁed. The third complex 3 represents a cyclic arrangement connecting two silver ions by two ligand molecules of L2. Obviously the formation of the latter one is favoured by replacement of dichloro- methane by methanol in the binary solvent mixture used for the reaction. The structural differences within the novel three complexes and the related examples in literature [6, 9, 11] clearly illustrate the signiﬁcance of both the kind of the linker as well as the nature of the counter anion and the solvent system for the sensitive interplay of weak interac- tions during the self-assembly process.
