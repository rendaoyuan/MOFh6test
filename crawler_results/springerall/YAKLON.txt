The two structures both contain extensive hydrogen bonding between water molecules as well as between water molecules and sebacic anions. The water molecules and sebacic acid O atoms assembled 2D supramolecular corrugated sheets with different mor- phology in the two complexes.

Water clusters of different nuclearities have been observed in crystal hydrates of organic and metal-organic compounds. In most of the reported examples, basic units of a small number of water molecules are inter- connected with each other to generate infinite polymeric networks such as chains [1], tapes [2], and 2D layers [3, 4]. The water pentamer is of particular interest, which ap- pears in large water clusters, liquid water, and the surfaces of proteins and DNA. Theoretical calculations predict a cyclic quasi-planar ring structure as the most stable form for water trimer, tetramer and pentamer clusters, while the low- energy structures of larger clusters have 3D cage-like con- formations [13, 14]. In contrast to the frequently observed even-membered water ring morphology such as (H2O)n (n = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 18) in solid state complexes, the odd-number water rings are rarely reported [15]. The larger clusters are expected to have 3D geometries, with the hexamer behaving as the transition from 2D to 3D structures [16]. Theoretical calculations for the hexamer have revealed the existence of several energy minima cor- responding to “ring”, “book”, “bag”, “cage”, and “prism” topologies within 0.7 kcal mol1 [13, 14, 17]. The lowest energy conformer is the “cage” followed by the “book” and “prism” structures, which are less than 0.1 and 0.2 kcal mol1 higher in energy, respectively [13, 14, 17]. The “ring” and “bag” structures have been shown to be 0.5 and 0.7 kcal mol1 higher in energy than the “cage”. Three types of cyclic water hexamers have been detected in host lattices characterized using X-ray crystallographic analysis, and they are denoted as “chair”, “boat” and “planar” cyclic water hexamers. In the structure of the title compounds, cyclic water hexamers with the “planar” conformation are present. Polymeric architec- tures are accomplished using synthons that are rich in hy- drogen-bond donor/acceptor groups [18, 19], with inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding and other noncovalent 2540 XIAN HuiDuo, et al. Sci China Chem December (2010) Vol.53 No.12 interactions being the main driving forces for the assembly of such systems. The sebacic dianion, which contains two carboxylate groups, could be harnessed in hydrogen-bonding networks, and it also serves as a template in the formation of hydrogen-bond-driven polymeric systems. Herein, we describe two novel water sheets stabilized by sebacic anions in complexes of Zn(II) and Co(II). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and instruments ZnSO4·7H2O, CoSO4·7H2O, sebacic acid, O-Phen and other chemical reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. The metal content was determined by EDTA complexometric titration after decompositing a known amount of the complex with con- centrated nitric acid. Elemental analyses were carried out on an Elementar Vario EL III elemental analyzer. IR spectra on KBr pellets were recorded on a Nicolet NEXUS 670 FTIR spectrophotometer in the range of 4000–400 cm1. Thermal analyses were carried out using a Mettler-Toledo TGA/ SDTA851e thermal analyzer with a heating rate of 10 °C min1 from 30 to 900 °C in air atmosphere. 2.2 Synthesis of the complexes Synthesis of [Zn(phen)3]2·[Zn(C10H16O4)·(H2O)3]·(C10H16O4)2· 20H2O (1) Addition of 0.2876 g (1 mmol) sebacic sodium to a stirred aqueous solution of ZnSO4·7H2O (1 mmol) in 20.0 mL H2O yielded a white precipitate, which was finally added to a stirred solution of phenanthroline monohydrate (1 mmol) in 20 mL EtOH. The mixture was further stirred at 60 °C for 5 h and the insoluble solid was filtered off. The filtrate was allowed to stand at room temperature. The orange block crystals were collected after slow evaporation at room tem- perature for about 2 weeks. Yields: 46% (based on ZnSO4). Anal. Calcd.

Absorption corrections were applied using SADABS [20]. The structures were solved with direct methods using SHELXS-97 [21] and refined with the full-matrix least- squares technique based on F2 using the SHELXL-97 [22] program package. Anisotropic thermal parameters were applied to all non-hydrogen atoms. The water hydrogen atoms were located from difference maps and refined with isotropic temperature factors. Experimental details for X-ray data collection are presented in Table 1, and the se- lected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2, and hydrogen bond geometry are listed in Table 3. CCDC No. 713320, 726833 of 1, 2 contain the supplementary crystal- lographic data for this paper. The data is obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Elemental analysis Both theoretically calculated values and actual values of the C, H, N, Ln percentage are in accordance with their chemi- cal formula of the complexes. 3.2 IR spectra The FTIR spectra of 1 and 2 show a broad band centered around 3417 cm1 attributable [23] to the OH stretching frequency pertaining to the water cluster. This broad band significantly reduces on heating the compounds under vac- uum at 180 °C for 2 h, suggesting escape parts of the water molecules from the lattice. Re-absorption of water is ob- served upon deliberate exposure to water vapor for 3 days as monitored by FTIR spectroscopy. The OH stretching vibrations of small water clusters (H2O)n (n = 2–10) in the gaseous state have been investigated [24] using infrared depletion and fragment spectroscopy. The stretching vibra- tions are found to be size specific spreading over a wide range from 3610 to 2967 cm1 with the higher nuclearity cluster showing the vibration below 3400 cm1. In comparison, the OH stretching vibration in ice appears [25] at 3220 cm1, while in liquid it shifts [25] to 3280 and 3490 cm1. Therefore, the OH stretching frequencies of the water cluster XIAN HuiDuo, et al.

Com- plex 1 contains one [Zn(C10H16O4)(H2O)3], two [Zn(Phen)3]2+ cations, two sebacic dianions and twenty lattice water molecules. The center Zn atoms display two coordination modes. Complex 1 contains neutral [Zn(C10H16O4)(H2O)3] and [Zn(Phen)3]2+ cation in a molar ratio of 1:2. In the [Zn(Phen)3]2+ unit, the Zn atom exhibits a slightly distorted octahedral geometry in which the Zn atom is coordinated to six nitrogen atoms from three phenanthroline molecules. All ZnN bond distances are almost equal and in good agreement with the previous reports [26–30]. The phenanthroline C atoms form weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds to the water mole- cules and carboxylic O atoms. In the [Zn(C10H16O4)(H2O)3] unit, the zinc atom is five-coordinated in a distorted trigo- nal-bipyramidal ZnO5 environment, in which the basal co- ordination sites are occupied by three oxygen atoms (O11, O21W, O22W), with the bond lengths of 2.0078(25), XIAN HuiDuo, et al. Sci China Chem December (2010) Vol.53 No.12 2543 Figure 1 ORTEP representation (30% thermal probability ellipsoids) of the crystal structure of 1. 1.9639(19) and 2.0237(22) Å, respectively. The bond angles going from 109.198(90)° to 140.776(82)°. O10 and water molecule O23w approach the zinc atom in axial positions at 2.1448(16) and 2.2128(17) Å and form an angle of 168.441(67)° with the zinc atom. Compared to the similar zinc complexes reported [30], which are two heteroleptic zinc(II) complexes with azelaic and sebacic acid coordi- nated and assembled into layers, the zinc complex reported here contains two different coordinated modes and forms interesting water networks. An ordered 2D hydrogen-bonded water layer is observed in the ab-plane (Figure 2). These water pentamers and hexamers are linked with the sebacic anions to self-assemble a 2D supramolecular morphology with a corrugated sheet. An interesting feature of 1 is the presence of the water pentamer and hexamer (Figure 3). Within the water pen- tamer, both water molecules act as both hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors. There is little variation in the O···O···O angles averaging about 98.736°, which is consid- erably lower than the corresponding tetrahedral values of 109.3° to 109.7° found in hexagonal ice and previously re- ported water clusters [15, 26–29]. By contrast, O···O sepa- rations in 1 vary significantly between 2.6503(43) and 2.8855(38) Å comprising the range between ice Ih (2.759 Å) and the averaged value in liquid water (2.85 Å) [31]. As previously mentioned, the preferred geometry of the water pentamer is cyclic. Acyclic structures may be possible if extra stabilization is achieved due to interactions of the wa- ter cluster with the organic or metal-organic moieties in the crystal. The sebacic anions form several hydrogen bonds Figure 2 Hydrogen-bonded network of the water molecules and carbox- ylic anions in complex 1. Figure 3 A perspective view showing the water pentamer and hexamer in complex 1. with the water pentamer. These interactions may be consid- ered as the governing factor for the stabilization of the acyclic pentamer in 1. Within the water hexamer, the H2O molecule bonded outside periphery is not coplanar with the core unit, but is situated above or below the plane described by the hexamer so as to accommodate the bulky sebacic anions. The hexameric core in the current assembly adopts a quasiplanar benzene-like cyclic structure. Although this is a higher- energy isomer, it is stabilized by the environment. Four water molecules (O8W, O8W, O11W and O12W) act as both hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, while O7W acts ex- clusively as a hydrogen-bond acceptor, and O10w acts ex- clusively as a hydrogen-bond donor. The average O···O dis- tances reported for the Ice I and II phases are 2.75 and 2.77–2.84 Å, respectively [32]. This distance for the water cluster reported herein is 2.7894 Å, which is remarkable given that the planar hexamer is implicated in bulk water. Notably, the bulk water has a short-range order in the O···O X-ray diffraction radial-distribution curve at 2.85 Å (for the gas phase it is 0.1 Å longer) [31]. In addition, the water molecules of the pentamer and 2544 XIAN HuiDuo, et al. Sci China Chem December (2010) Vol.53 No.12 hexamer donate hydrogen bonds to carboxylate O atoms (O2, O3, O7, O9 and O10 ) and water molecules (O6W, O10W, O13W). The neighbouring water pentamer and hexamer are linked by the water molecule (O6W). As a consequence of these hydrogen bonds, the water pentamers, hexamers, remaining water molecules and sebacic anions are assembled into a two-dimensional supramolecular sheet. Complex 2 contains one [Co(H2O)6]2+ cation, two [Co(phen)3]2+ cations, three sebacic dianions and thirty lat- tice water molecules (Figure 4), among which the [Co(H2O)6]2+ cation and [Co(phen)3]2+ cations are in a molar ratio of 1:2. In the [Co(phen)3]2+ unit, the Co atom exhibits a slightly distorted octahedral geometry in which the Co atom is co- ordinated to six nitrogen atoms from three phenanthroline molecules. In the [Co(H2O)6]2+ cation, there are six water molecules in the coordination sphere of each metal center which has an ideal octahedral geometry. Three independent Co-O bond lengths are almost equal to each other in com- pound 2. Each metal center is constrained to lie on the least-squares plane defined by O1W, O1Wa, O2W and O2Wa. The sum of the bond angles within the plane is 360° and the O3WCoO3Wa bond angle is linear, which could be defined as the apex of the octahedron. An ordered 2D hydrogen-bonded water layer is observed in the bc-plane (Figure 5). Hydrogenbonding association generates a 16-membered centrosymmetric water ring (Fig- ure 6) consisting of two O7W, two O8W, two O10W, two O11W, two O12W, two O13W, two O14W and two O18W centers. These 16-membered rings are fused together to form a 2D supramolecular (H2O)16 morphology with a cor- rugated sheet. A closer view of the (H2O)16 rings illustrates that each water monomer acts as both a hydrogen-bond do- nor and a hydrogen-bond acceptor. The average O···O sepa- ration of 2.9234 Å in the supromolecular (H2O)16 morphol- ogy is close to the corresponding value of 2.85 Å in liquid water [30]. In contrast to the recently observed 2D su- pramolecular (H2O)18 morphology, which is structurally similar to liquid water [19], the O···O separation in our (H2O)16 morphology is structurally similar to liquid water. The O···O···O angles range from 98.715° to 162.378°, con- siderably deviating from the preferred ideal tetrahedral ge- ometry of water. Further analysis of the crystal packing reveals that this structure also contains extensive hydrogen bonding between Figure 4 ORTEP representation (30% thermal probability ellipsoids) of the unit of crystal structure of 2.

The most signifi- cant of these are O7W···O6W = 2.836(5) Å, O6W···O12W = 2.938(5) Å, O12W···O8W = 3.029(6) Å, O8W···O9W = 2.772(5) Å, O9W···O10W = 2.792(4) Å, and O10W···O7W = 2.832(5) Å, affording a six-membered cyclic motif. Within the hexamer, six oxygens are arranged in the expected pucker mode. Additional O7W···O8W (2.817(5) Å) water- water interactions extend these hexamers to form a unique 1-D tape. Normally, water clusters locate in organic molecular hosts or inorganic-organic hybrid frameworks. In this case, these water tapes may play a complementary role in stabi- lizing the network structure. The result is expected, as the water molecule acts as a “glue” to assemble the [Co(H2O)6]2+ cations around it, leading to the 3D structure. 3.4 Thermogravimetric analysis The thermal decomposition profiles for 1 and 2 are shown in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. To compound 1, water re- moval showed a 17.85% weight loss between room tem- perature and 176 °C corresponding to loss of free water molecules (calc. 18.05%). The complete decomposition of the compound is achieved above 700 °C. Compound 2 un- dergoes a preliminary dehydration process between 80 and 161 °C, corresponding to the loss of a total of thirty water molecules (mass loss ca. 22.01%, calc. 21.53%). 4 Conclusions In summary, we have observed a 3D supramolecular water layer containing water pentamers and hexamers in 1 and (H2O)16-containing 2D supramolecular water sheets by us- ing sebacic dianions as a template in 2. The supramolecular self-assembly observed here is the result of hydrogen- Figure 8 TG curve for 1. Figure 9 TG curve for 2. bonding interactions between water molecules as well as between water molecules and sebacic anions. As water molecules play a significant role in contributing to confor- mation, stability, function, and dynamics of biomacro- molecules, the water clusters may provide insight into the hydrogen-bonding motif of the aqueous environment in living systems and enhance understanding of the structural aspects of water. 2546 XIAN HuiDuo, et al.
