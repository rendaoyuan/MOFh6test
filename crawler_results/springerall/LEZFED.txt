A three-dimensional highly stable cobalt(II) metal–organic framework based on terephthalic acid: synthesis, crystal structure, thermal and physical properties Alireza Abbasi • Sara Tarighi • Alireza Badiei Received: 15 May 2012 / Accepted: 25 July 2012 / Published online: 25 August 2012  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012 Abstract A metal–organic framework complex, [Co(l3–tp)(l2-pyz)]n, where H2tp = 1,4-benzenedicarb- oxylic acid (terephthalic acid) and pyz = pyrazine, has been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions and character- ized by physico-chemical and spectroscopic methods, ther- mogravimetric analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Each Co(II) center is surrounded by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from three tp ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two pyrazine ligands, giving a distorted octahedral geometry. The entire framework is made up of two-dimensional sheets of dicobalt ions linked via terephthalate ligands to form rectangles. The sheets are then linked into each other via the axial pyrazine ligands, forming an interlocked 3-D network, which is ﬁnally arranged as an ABAB interconnected pat- tern. Photoluminescence measurements for the polymer in the solid state show an emission at 414 nm, which suggests this complex as a potential blue-light material. The elec- trochemical behavior of a modiﬁed carbon paste electrode prepared from the complex has been studied by cyclic vol- tammetry, indicating quasi-reversible redox behavior. Introduction Organic–inorganic hybrid materials, which contain metal centers connected by organic spacers, have attracted much attention in recent years [1–4]. In particular, coordination polymers (CPs) or metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are of considerable interest owing to their potential applica- tions including gas storage, catalysis, luminescence, mag- netism and electrochemical activity [5–9]. The design and construction of these MOFs have been widely studied, and a wide variety of frameworks have been prepared through self-assembly processes. Rigid ligands, such as benzene polycarboxylic acids and heterocyclic aromatic compounds, are known as good can- didates for assembly of CPs. Among them, terephthalic acid is one of the best spacers for design and construction of MOFs, due to the equally spaced carboxylate groups, rigidity of the phenyl skeleton and especially its various bridging abilities [10, 11]. The latter has led to a variety of structures based on diverse coordination modes including bis-bidentate (A), bis-monodentate (B), bridging bis-monodentate (C) and others (Scheme 1). Employment of mixed ligands has allowed the construction of frameworks with a greater variety of structural motifs, compared with using only one type of ligand. Hence, introduction of auxiliary ligands such as aromatic N-donors into the reaction systems can result in wide variety of architectures [12]. Control of dimensionality is a major challenge in the preparation of MOFs. Polyfunctional ligands that provide steric hindrance around the metal centers tend to result in coordination of water or other solvent molecules, which results in lower dimensionalities. From entropic and kinetic points of view, it is advantageous to arrange the building blocks in a more organized fashion and remove the water ligands by reaction at higher temperatures or for longer reaction times [13,14]. Considering all these various aspects, we report here a new metal–organic framework, [Co(tp) (pyz)]n, prepared under hydrothermal conditions at high temperature, in which two-dimensional sheets of tere- phthalate linkers are linked via pyrazine molecules to form a Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11243-012-9638-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

This polymer interestingly reveals high ther- mal stability due to lack of any co-crystallized molecules or water ligands. Furthermore, the prepared MOF exhibits interesting luminescence and electrochemical properties. Experimental Materials and instrumentation All reagents for the synthesis were commercially available and used as received. IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Enquinox 55 spectrometer, equipped with a single reﬂection diamond ATR system, in the 600–4,000 cm-1 region. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed with a NET- ZSCH STA 409 PC/PG TG instrument at a heating rate of 20 K/min. Solid-state diffuse-reﬂectance UV/Vis spectra in the 200–1,200 nm range were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer UV/Vis spectrophotometer using BaSO4 as a white stan- dard. Fluorescence spectra were obtained in the solid state on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50b luminescence spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu-Ka radiation (k = 1.54178 A˚ ) ranging from 5 to 50. The simulated PXRD pattern was prepared using the Mercury program from the corresponding single-crystal data. Electrochemical measurements were carried out with a PalmSens Instru- ments BV (Holland) instrument, using a three-electrode system, consisting of a carbon paste working electrode, Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as reference electrode and platinum wire as counter electrode. Cyclic voltammetric experiments were recorded at 298 ± 1 K. Crystallographic data were collected on an Oxford Xcalibur 3 diffractometer equipped with CCD area detector using Mo-Ka X-ray radiation. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 and reﬁned using full-matrix least-squares methods on F2, within SHELXL-97 [15]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were added at ideal positions and reﬁned using a riding model. The data have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, with deposition number CCDC-827598. Synthesis An aqueous solution (5 mL) of Co(NO3)2.6H2O (0.291 g, 1 mmol) was added to an aqueous solution (10 mL) of pyrazine (0.080 g, 1 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 15 min at room temperature and then transferred to a 23 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel container. After the addition of terephthalic acid (0.166 g, 1 mmol) to the mixture, the container was heated to 200 C and held at this temperature for 48 h, followed by cooling to room temperature at a rate of 10 C h-1. The resulting red-brown needle-like crystals were ﬁltered off and washed with DMF, in order to remove the unreacted terephthalic acid components. Yield: 0.233 g (79 % based on Co). Preparation of cobalt-modiﬁed carbon paste electrode (Co-CPE) The Co-CPE was prepared by hand-mixing 0.1 g of graphite powder and 0.02 g of [Co(l3-tp)(l2-pyz)]n (in a ratio of 5:1) in an agate mortar for about 20 min to get a homogenous mixture. Parafﬁn oil was added and mixed in carefully to form a paste. The resulting homogenized mixture was packed into a glass rod with inner diameter of 4 mm, which was equipped with a copper rod as electrical contact. Before each experiment, the carbon paste electrode was polished manually with a piece of paper and rinsed with distilled and de-ionized water [16]. Results and discussion Synthesis and general characterization The title MOF was synthesized under hydrothermal condi- tions at high temperature. In general, higher dimensionality can be obtained by removing the solvent ligands using higher reaction temperatures or longer reaction times [13, 14]. On the other hand, high temperature may decom- pose the linkers. For instance, pyridinedicarboxylic acid underwent in situ decarboxylation at high temperature to give nicotinic acid [17–19]. We could ﬁnd only one struc- ture involving Co(II) benzenedicarboxylate and pyrazine coordination polymers in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, in which the two-dimensional [Co(pyz) (tp)(H2O)2] network contains two water ligands in the inner coordination sphere. This complex was prepared under mild reaction conditions [20]. The high thermal stability of terephthalic acid allowed us to increase the reaction temperature to get the title compound, which lacks any Scheme 1 Different coordination modes of terephthalate ion, a bidentate, b monodentate, c bis-monodentate 680 Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:679–685 123 co-crystallized or coordinated solvent compared to other similar polymers. The crystals are air-stable, insoluble in common solvents and retain their crystalline integrity under ambient conditions for a considerable length of time. The stability of the polymer was veriﬁed by TGA, as discussed below. Structure analysis The crystallographic data and ORTEP diagram of the three-dimensional network of the polymer are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1, respectively. In the asymmetric unit, each cobalt atom is six-coordinated in a distorted octahe- dral geometry, comprising four oxygen atoms from three different terephthalate ligands in the equatorial plane and two nitrogens from two different pyrazine ligands occu- pying the axial positions (Scheme S1). Along the basal plane, pairs of cobalt atoms are bridged by terephthalate ligands in a l3-bridging style. The terephthalate linkers show two bridging styles, namely bidentate and bridging bis-monodentate modes, forming an 8-membered ring via the latter bridging mode. The entire framework is made up of two-dimensional sheets of dicobalt atoms linked via terephthalate ligands to form rectangles. The dimensions of these rectangles, established with respect to the average CoCo distances of adjacent 8-membered rings, are 10.58 9 10.87 A˚ . The two-dimensional sheets are linked to each other through the axial pyrazine ligands, forming a 3-D network (Fig. 2). These axial pyrazine linkages form an interlocked network of the two-dimensional sheets, where the axial pyrazine groups of one layer occupy the rectangular opening of the two-dimensional sheet above and below. This arrangement ultimately leads to an inter- connected ABAB pattern for the stacked layers. All bond lengths and angles are in the expected ranges for this type of bonding [13, 21–23]. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. The average Co–O bond lengths are 2.18 A˚ and 2.00 A˚ for the bidentate and Table 1 Crystal data and structure reﬁnement Empirical formula C12H8CoN2O4 Formula weight 295.07 Crystal system Orthorhombic Space group P b c a Temperature (K) 295 (2) Radiation Mo–Ka (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) Unit cell dimensions (A˚) a 7.1230 (3) b 17.3538 (7) c 18.0545 (7) Volume (A˚ 3), Z 2,231.74 (15), 8 Calculated density (Mg m-3) 1.804 Absorption coefﬁcient (mm-1) 1.549 F(000) 1,224 h range for data collection 2.26–25.68 Limiting indices -8 B h B 8; -21 B k B 21; -21 B L B 20 Independent reﬂections 2,028 [R(int) = 0.1677] Total reﬂections 14,913 Data/restraints/parameters 2,028/0/172 Goodness-of-ﬁt on F2 0.958 Final R indices [I [ 2r(I)] (All data) R1 = 0.0497, wR2 = 0.0629 R1 = 0.1142, wR2 = 0.0703 Fig. 1 View of the molecular structure of [Co(l3-tp)(l2-pyz)] with atom labeling and 50 % probability of thermal ellipsoids.

The axial positions, occupied by nitrogen atoms from the pyrazine ligands, have an average Co–N bond length of 2.17 A˚ . The CoCo distances for the cobalts separated by pyrazine ligands are about 7.12 A˚ . Both this value and the corre- sponding value for the CoCo distances in the 2-D layers separated by terephthalates are in good agreement with those reported for two analogous structures, [Co(py- z)(tp)(H2O)2] and {[Co2(C10H2O8)(pyz)(H2O)4]2H2O}n [20, 24]. The slight differences could arise from the dif- ferent coordination modes of the carboxylate groups in these three structures. Other weak interactions also exist in the polymer framework: the terephthalate rings in parallel layers show p–p interactions (centroid…centroid distance, 3.716 A˚ ; angle, 9.09), and there are also CH…p interactions between the benzene C–H of the terephthalates and pyra- zine molecules located in another direction (distance, 3.189; angle, 76.89), (Fig. S1a and 1b). An electron micrograph of the obtained MOF shows well-shaped and high-quality rod-like crystals (Fig. 3). PXRD measurement was performed to ensure the phase purity of the sample for further analyses. As shown in Fig. 4, the experimental PXRD pattern of the polymer is similar to that calculated from its single-crystal X-ray data, which is a good indication of phase purity of the bulk product. The differences in intensity between the experi- mental and simulated XRPD patterns may be due to the preferred orientation of the powder sample during the experiment. Thermogravimetric and spectroscopic data On heating the compound to 600 C under argon atmo- sphere, no obvious decomposition was observed until ca. 400 C. The TGA plot (Fig. 5) shows an obvious weight loss of 70 % above 410 C, relating to decomposition of the organic components. The polymer exhibited high thermal stability in comparison with similar structures that start to lose weight at about 150 C. The observed stability of the polymer until 400 C can be explained by the lack of any co-crystals or solvent coordinated in the structure, and this leads to one-step weight loss compared to analogous structures that decompose in two or three steps because of their water ligands or presence of co-crystallized species in their framework [10, 13, 17, 25].

Splitting of tasym(CO2) conﬁrms that the carboxyl- ate groups have two different coordination modes, which is consistent with the crystal analysis. The absence of the expected characteristic bands at 1,690–1,730 cm-1 for protonated carboxylate groups is consistent with the com- plete deprotonation of the terephthalic acid ligands in this complex [17, 26, 27]. The solid-state Uv/Vis spectrum of the compound is shown in Fig. 6. The spectrum shows a relatively strong absorption band below 350 nm, assigned to the ligand-cen- tered transitions of the tp and pyz aromatic rings. A broad absorption band, which tails from 350 nm into the visible region, could be mainly attributed to N ? Co and O ? Co LMCT bands merged into one intense band. The weaker d–d spin-allowed transitions of the d7 (Co2?) ion [4T1g(F) ? 4T1g(P)], which typically appear near 500 nm, are also merged into this wide feature, accompanied by a shoulder at about 850–900 nm assigned to a weak 4T1g(F) ? 4A2g(F) transition. Finally, a band observed at about 1,000 nm could be assigned to the 4T1g(F) ? 4T2g(F) tran- sition [28, 29]. Photoluminescence properties The solid-state photoluminescence of the compound at room temperature was investigated for the crystalline powder scattered on a plate intersecting with incidence at an angle of 45 and is shown in Fig. 7. The polymer exhibits blue photoluminescence, with an emission maxi- mum at 414 nm upon excitation at 270 nm. The free tp and pyz ligands also showed ﬂuorescence emissions in the solid state, with maximum emissions at 318 nm (kex = 270 nm) Fig. 5 The TGA–DTA diagram of [Co(l3-tp)(l2-pyz)]n showing high stability up to 400 C Fig. 6 Electronic spectrum of the titled MOF with BaSO4 as the background Fig. 7 Solid-state emission spectrum at room temperature showing an emission at 414 nm Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:679–685 683 123 and 302 nm (kex = 250 nm), respectively. Hence, the polymer exhibits a signiﬁcant red shift of about 100 nm in its luminescence emission, compared to the free ligands. This observation, as well as the absence of any ligand- based emissions in the ﬂuorescence spectra, suggests energy transfer from the ligands to the Co(II) centers during photoluminescence [30]. Thus, the photolumines- cence can be attributed to ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transitions, which could be further assigned to the tp ligand, considering the excitation wavelengths men- tioned above. Similar LMCT features have been reported for several analogous coordination polymers. A similar emission band at 392 nm for [Co(tp)(phen)(H2O)]n and 400 nm for [Co{1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane}(tp)] has been observed previously [32, 33]. These observations indicate that the polymer may be a suitable candidate for high thermal stability, blue-ﬂuorescent materials [31–33]. Electrochemical behavior The electrochemical behavior of the Co-CPE was studied by cyclic voltammetry. The voltammogramms were obtained in 0.1 M glycine buffer solution adjusted to pH 2, and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solutions adjusted to pH values of 4, 7 and 10. It can be seen that the redox peaks of the Co-CPE are inﬂuenced by the pH value of the supporting electrolyte solution, and well-deﬁned behavior is observed at pH 2 (Fig. S2) [34]. Therefore, pH 2 was selected for further investigations. The cyclic voltammograms depicted in Fig. 8 exhibit anodic and cathodic peaks with Epa = -0.05 V and Epc = -0.62 V, versus the Ag/AgCl electrode at pH 2, indicating quasi-reversible behavior [35]. These peaks can be related to the Co?3/Co?2 redox process [36]. The effect of scan rate on the electrochemical properties was also studied over a range of t = 0.03–0.09 V S-1 (Fig. 8). Plots of the anodic and cathodic peak currents are linearly proportional to the square root of the scan rate, conﬁrming a diffusion-controlled pro- cess (Fig. S3). With consecutive potential cycling, peak current values remained almost unchanged (Fig. S4). This remarkable stability and lack of any leaching from the electrode could be attributed to insolubility of the investi- gated MOF. Conclusion A new three-dimensional highly stable Cobalt(II) MOF, [Co(l3–tp)(l2–pyz)]n, has been synthesized under hydro- thermal conditions and structurally characterized. The solid- state structure is unusual compared to similar structures, by having no solvent-coordinated or co-crystallized species. The metal atoms are coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from three tp ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two pyrazine ligands in a distorted octahedral fashion. The tp linkers bridge in a l3 fashion, giving rise to 2-D inﬁnite layers in the bc plane. These layers are linked by pyrazine along the a axis, forming an interlocked 3-D network, arrayed in an ABAB interconnected pattern. No obvious decomposition was observed until ca. 400 C, indicating high thermal stability. This is explained by the lack of any free molecules or coordinated solvent in the structure. The polymer shows a reasonable electrochemical activity in a carbon paste electrode, involving quasi-reversible redox behavior with acceptable stability. The polymer also showed a blue ﬂuorescence emission at 414 nm and therefore can be a good candidate for blue-light materials.
