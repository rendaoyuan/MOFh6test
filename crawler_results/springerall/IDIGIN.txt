Manuscript Hydrothermal syntheses, crystal structures and ﬂuorescent properties of ﬁve transition metal–organic hybrids incorporating an unsymmetrical benzotriazole carboxylate ligand Zhong Zhang • Kun Hu • Yun-jia Shi • Jin-man Qin • Zi-lu Chen • Fu-pei Liang Received: 8 December 2012 / Accepted: 10 January 2013 / Published online: 29 January 2013  Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013 Abstract The hydrothermal reactions of nitrate or chloride salts of Co(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Hg(II) and Ag(I) with an unsymmetrical benzotriazole derivative 1H-1,2,3-benzo- triazole-1-propionic acid (Hbtap) afforded ﬁve new metal–organic coordination polymers with formula of [M(btap)2(H2O)2]n (M = Co 1,Zn2, Cd 3),[Hg(btap)Cl]n(4) and {[Ag(btap)]H2O}n (5), which were characterized by X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic methods. The anionic btap- ligands in these complexes assume the same anti con- formation, but show different coordination behaviors toward transition metal ions. Complexes 1, 2 and 3 are isostructural and reveal inﬁnite one-dimensional (1D) looped-chain struc- tures constructed by hexacoordinated metal centers and 2-connected btap- bridges. Complex 4 features 1D zigzag polymeric arrays, which are interlinked with each other resulting in a chiral three-dimensional (3D) 4-connected framework. In complex 5, the 3-connected ligands join Ag(I) atoms into a 1D ribbon motif. The photoluminescence spectra of three d10metal complexes 2, 3 and 4 were measured at room temperature. The emission peaks of these complexes resemble that of the free ligand and can be ascribed to the intraligand p–p* transitions.

In the recent years, a great number of hybrid coordination frameworks with novel structures have been obtained by employing the modular synthesis strategy, and many of them offer a wide range of applications such as gas storage and separation, optical and chemical sensing, magnetic materials, and so on [4–7]. Even so, more experimental research will be needed to give us detailed information about the general principles of the design and synthesis of MOFs. In fact, the judicious selection of organic connectors with appropriate ﬂexibility, suitable arrangement of the donor groups as well as speciﬁc coordination requirements may be regarded as a key ingredient in determining the dimension- ality, network topology, porosity and physical–chemical properties of the metal–organic coordination networks [8–11]. For this reason, many multidentate O-containing and N-containing bridging ligands have been used as effective building blocks in the construction of the metal–organic frameworks with desired structures and properties [12–14]. Among them, azole heterocycles have proved to be versatile synthons for developing a new type of porous material termed as metal-azolate frameworks (MAFs) [15–18]. As a further investigation, the introduction of the carboxylic acid substituents on the azole rings will afford a class of Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11243-013-9697-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

In the past few years, this sub-ﬁeld has drawn much attention from many research groups, and some studies on the optical properties of the metal–organic hybrids derived from these ligands have been reported [19–24]. In this paper, grafting of the ﬂexible propionic acid pendant arm onto a benzotriazole ring gives rise to a heterocyclic car- boxylic acid derivative Hbtap as bridging ligand. The coor- dination capability of the ligand toward some transition metal ions was investigated systematically for the ﬁrst time (Scheme 1), and four low-dimensional coordination poly- mers formulated as [M(btap)2(H2O)2]n (M = Co 1, Zn 2, Cd 3) and {[Ag(btap)]H2O}n (5), along with a 3D chiral framework [Hg(btap)Cl]n (4) were produced. The thermal behaviors and photoluminescence emission properties of some selected complexes were explored. Experimental section Materials and physical measurements The ligand Hbtap was prepared following a published procedure [25]. All other starting materials were purchased from Merck in analytical grade and used without any fur- ther puriﬁcation. Elemental analysis for C, H and N was carried out using an Elementar Vario Micro Cube ele- mental analyzer. 1H NMR spectra were collected at 500 MHz on a Bruker Avance AV500 instrument, (CD3)2SO and TMS were used as solvent and internal standard, respectively. IR spectra were recorded as KBr disks on a Perkin–Elmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrometer in the 4,000–400 cm21 spectral region. Thermogravimetric analysis was obtained using a Setaram Labsys Evo TG– DTA/DSC instrument at a heating rate of 5 C min21 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The ﬂuorescence spectra were performed on a Horiba Jobin–Yvon FL3-P-TCSPC ﬂuorescence spectrometer in the solid state at room tem- perature. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements (PXRD) for poly-crystalline samples of complexes 1–5 were per- formed on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 V diffractometer equip- ped with Cu–Ka radiation (k = 1.54178 A˚ ) over the 2h range from 5 to 60. Synthesis of [Co(btap)2(H2O)2]n (1) A mixture of Hbtap (0.076 g, 0.40 mmol), Co(NO3)26H2O (0.058 g, 0.20 mmol) and 12 ml distilled water was sealed in a 25-ml Teﬂon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The sealed vessel was heated to 120 C for 48 h. Subsequently, the mixture was slowly cooled to ambient temperature over 24 h for crystalli- zation. The pink block crystals of 1 were obtained and col- lected by ﬁltration, washed with water for several times and dried in air. Yield 0.040 g (42 % based on Co). Anal.

Crystal structure determination The diffraction data for complexes 1–5 were collected on an Agilent SuperNova single-crystal diffractometer equip- ped with graphite-monochromated Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL program package [26]. All non- hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms of water molecules were found in the difference Fourier maps and reﬁned isotropically, with the O–H bond distances restrained to 0.85 A˚ , all other hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically and reﬁned as riding models. Details of crystal data and structure reﬁnement parameters for complexes 1–5 are listed in Table 1. Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for complexes 1–5 are summa- rized in Table S1. Hydrogen bond distances (A˚ ) and angles () for complex 1–5 are listed in Table S2. Results and discussion Synthesis and IR spectra The ligand Hbtap was synthesized by the Michael addition of 1,2,3-benzotriazole to acrylic acid in 1:1 molar ratio, whose 1H NMR spectrum is given in Fig. S1. Complexes 1–5 were prepared under similar hydrothermal conditions, and the stoichiometry of the corresponding complexes is independent of the metal to ligand ratio employed (1:1; 1:2; 1:3). However, the yields of products from dif- ferent experimental runs are quite different. As shown in Fig. S2, the IR spectra of all the complexes show charac- teristic mas and ms stretching bands of COO- groups in the wavenumber ranges of 1,582–1,564 cm-1 and 1,417–1,404 cm-1, respectively, accompanied by the absence of the C=O stretching band of the carboxyl group, conﬁrming that the ligands present in these solid complexes are fully deprotonated. Description of the crystal structures Complexes 1, 2 and 3 are isostructural and isomorphous, which exhibit the same 1D inﬁnite looped-chain structure. Thus, we only select complex 1 as a representative to describe their crystal structures. Complex 1 belongs to monoclinic system with space group P2(1)/c, and the local coordination environment of the central Co(II) atom is depicted in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the Co(II) atom lies on the crystallographic inversion center, and it has an N2O4 donor set deﬁned by two triazole N atoms (N3 and N3A) from two anionic btap- ligands, two carboxylate O atoms (O1 and O1A) from another two btap- ligands and two O atoms (O3 and O3A) provided by two water ligands. The cis bond angles at the central Co(II) atom fall in the range of 87.30(8)–92.70(8), very close to the ideal value of 90, which reveal that the geometry around Co(II) is slightly distorted from regular octahedral. The Co–O bond length of 2.0610(18) A˚ and Co–N bond length of 2.0997(18) A˚ are all comparable to the values found for the analogous Co(II) complexes [27, 28]. In 1, each btap- serves as a bidentate linker to connect two Co(II) atoms by using its triazole group and carboxylate substituent (mode a in Scheme 1), while one Co(II) atom is surrounded by four btap- ligands, giving rise to a 1D looped-chain composed of vertex-shar- ing 16-membered cyclic [Co2(btap)2] subunits (Fig. 2). Within the bimetallic ring, two symmetry-related anionic ligands bridge two metal centers in a head-to-tail fashion and each of them adopts an anti conformation with the torsion angle N1–C7–C8A–C9A being -161.7(2). The shortest Co…Co separation through the ﬂexible bifunc- tional ligand is 8.715 A˚ , much longer than that observed in Transition Met Chem (2013) 38:327–334 329 123 the Co–btae- (btae- = 1H-1,2,3-benzotriazole-1-acetate) complex [27]. The neighboring 1D metal–organic hybrid chains are arranged in an antiparallel fashion along the bc plane, and the O–H…O hydrogen bond interactions between water ligands and carboxylate groups assemble these 1D chains into a 2D hydrogen bonding network (Fig. S3). Viewed from the crystallographic b axis, hydrophobic aromatic rings are evenly distributed on the two sides of the 2D layer, which can facilitate the p–p stacking between the aromatic rings from adjacent layers to extend the 2D layers into a 3D supramolecular net (Fig. S4). The interplanar distance between parallel benzotriazole rings is 3.357 A˚ , and the centriod–centriod separation is 4.019 A˚ .

All hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity 330 Transition Met Chem (2013) 38:327–334 123 4 including the coordinated Cl- ligands was generated. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the central Hg(II) atom is located in a severely distorted six-coordinated NO4Cl geometry, sur- rounded by a triazole N atom (N3A) of one btap- ligand, four carboxylate O atoms (O1, O2, O1B and O2C) from another three btap- ligands and a chloride ligand. The two shortest bonds around the Hg(II) atoms are to the triazole N atom and Cl- ion with the bond lengths of 2.173(7) and 2.316(2) A˚ , respectively. The Hg–O bond lengths change from 2.525(7) to 2.721(7) A˚ . These values are expected for the bonds between the chelating-bridging carboxylate and Hg(II) atoms [29]. With its l3 chelating-bridging carboxylate group and triazole N3 atom, each btap- ligand acts as a 4-con- nected organic node linked with four Hg(II) atoms (mode bin Scheme 1). At ﬁrst, the ﬂexible btap- linkers join the adja- cent Hg(II) atoms into a 1D zigzag chainalongthe b axis. The Hg…Hg separation across btap- is 10.455 A˚ . The ligands within the chain assume the anti conformation, having the torsion angle N1–C7–C8–C9 close to 180. Furthermore, the 1D zigzag chains are linked with each other through the bridging action of the carboxylate O1 and O2 atoms between Hg(II) atoms coming from different 1D chains, to yield a uninodal 4-connected 3D polymeric network with a (42.63.8) topology (Fig. 4). The p–p stacking interactions between aromatic rings of adjacent chains provide additional stabil- ization to the 3D architecture. Complex 5 also crystallizes in a monoclinic P2(1)/c space group, yet it shows some different structural characteristics with respect to complexes 1, 2 and 3. Two chelating car- boxylate O atoms (O1B and O2B) and two triazole N atoms (N3 and N2A) from three distinct btap- ligands occupy the coordination sites around the Ag(I) atom to give a twisted tetrahedral environment, where the O–Ag–N bond angles deviate from the ideal value of 109.47 (Fig. 5). The Ag–N and Ag–O bond distances vary from 2.227(2) to 2.524(2) A˚ and fall into the normal range for such coordination species [23]. The anionic ligands ﬁrstly bridge Ag(I) atoms through the carboxylate groups and triazole N3 atoms into a 1D linear chain running along the a axis. After that, two neighboring antiparallel chains are paired via Ag1–N2 bonds, to generate a double-chain ribbon (Fig. 6) in which the spacer ligand has an anti conformation with the torsion angle N1–C7–C8–C9 of 171.9(2). Thus, each btap- ligand can be treated as a 3-connected linker to coordinate with three Ag(I) atoms (mode c in Scheme 1). From another view, the 1D double- chain ribbon structure can be considered as consisting of alternating 6- membered and 14-membered metallacycles. The Ag…Ag separation across the 6-membered ring is 3.643 A˚ and that across the 14-membered ring is 6.728 A˚ . The double-chain ribbons are further extended into a 3D supra- molecular net through aromatic p–p stacking (centriod– centriod separation of 3.954 A˚ ) and O–H…O hydrogen bonding involving the lattice water molecules (Fig. S5). Powder X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis The experimental PXRD patterns measured for the bulk samples of complexes 1–5 are in fair agreement with the corresponding simulated ones based on the single-crystal Fig. 2 The inﬁnite 1D looped-chain in 1 propagating along the c axis Fig. 3 The local coordination environment of the Hg(II) atom in 4. All hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity Transition Met Chem (2013) 38:327–334 331 123 X-ray diffraction data (Fig. S6), which implies the phase purity of the as-synthesized products. In order to charac- terize the thermal behavior of this series of metal–organic hybrids, TGA experiments were performed on the bulk samples of complexes 1, 2, 3 and 5 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The TGA proﬁles shown in Fig. S7 reveal that all four compounds have similar thermal decomposition processes. The ﬁrst weight losses of 7.74, 7.07, 7.59 and 5.46 % in the temperature ranges of 140–180, 130–175, 130–180 and 70–220 C for complexes 1, 2, 3 and 5, respectively, correspond to the removal of two coordinated water ligands from 1, 2 and 3 (calcd 7.58, 7.48 and 6.81 %) or the release of one lattice water molecule from 5 (calcd 5.70 %). Afterward, the second weight losses of 30.52, 29.51, 27.82 and 23.26 % from 260 to 410, 270 to 410, 230 to 390 and 230 to 300 C for 1, 2, 3 and 5, respectively, are consistent with the loss of CH2CH2COO2 functional groups from the anionic ligands (calcd 30.32, 29.92, 27.26 and 22.80 %). Eventually, a further increase in temperature causes the combustion of the remaining azole components for all compounds. Fluorescent properties Some metal–organic hybrids containing d10 metal centers reveal attractive ﬂuorescent properties, which make them eligible candidates for chemical sensors or optical devices [30, 31]. Here, the solid state photoluminescent properties of complexes 2, 3 and 4 with d10 metal cations were investigated at ambient temperature (Fig. 7). Excitation of the microcrystalline samples of complexes 2, 3 and 4 at 323, 322 and 319 nm produces intense luminescence bands with maxima at 390, 368 and 363 nm, respectively. To interpret the nature of these emission peaks, we also have measured the ﬂuorescent properties of the free ligand under the same conditions, and it displays a strong emission peak at 410 nm upon excitation at 327 nm. By comparing the emission spectra of the three complexes with that of Hbtap, Fig. 4 View of the chiral 3D 4-connected coordination network in 4 Fig. 5 The local coordination environment of the Ag(I) atom in 5. All hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity 332 Transition Met Chem (2013) 38:327–334 123 it can be proposed that the ﬂuorescence emission of the complexes is assigned to the intraligandp–p* transitions. However, 20–50 nm blue shifts of the emission maxima of these complexes areobserved with respect to that of the free ligand. The blue shifts of the emission spectra may be induced by a number of factors, including the deprotona- tion of the ligand and the coordination interactions between the ligand and the metal centers [32]. Conclusions A series of new metal–organic hybrids derived from a ﬂex- ible unsymmetrical benzotriazole carboxylic acid ligand was prepared and characterized. These complexes are provided with three different types of coordination architectures: 1D looped-chain topological structures of 1, 2 and 3; 3D chiral framework of 4 and 1D ribbon chain of 5. Structural analysis suggests that the diverse coordination fashions of btap- ligand are the chief factors that govern the aggregation features of these compounds. Three hybrid complexes con- taining the zinc family metals display ligand-based ﬂuores- cence emission in the solid state. Our ongoing studies focus on the construction of hybrid coordination frameworks with varied structures and dimensionalities via tuning the con- formations of the ﬂexible bifunctional linker.
