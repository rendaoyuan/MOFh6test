Manuscript Hydrothermal Synthesis, Crystal Structures and Fluorescent Properties of Two New d10 Metal Coordination Polymers with Two Mixed Flexible Ligands Baoyong Zhu Received: 29 February 2012 / Accepted: 12 April 2012 / Published online: 3 May 2012  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 Abstract Two complexes, [Zn(qda)(bpp)]n (1) and {[Cd (qda)(bpp)2]2H2O}n (2), (H2qda = hydroquinone-O,O0-di- acetic acid, bpp = 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane), were hydro- thermally synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, FTIR and elemental analysis. Both compounds exhibit two-dimensional structures. The qda anions in compound 1 adopt two different trans con- formations, coordinating to Zn2? ions in a monodentate fashion, while in compound 2 they adopt only one trans conformation yet keeping the same coordination fashion as in compound 1. The bpp molecules show same anti-gauche coordination conformation in both 1 and 2. In addition, photoluminescence for 1 and 2 has been investigated in the solid state at room temperature.

A powerful strategy in constructing functional coordination polymers is to utilize appropriate metal ions and organic multitopic ligands [9–13]. However, even the same starting materials might produce various structures with different coordination modes. Many factors such as the coordination geometry of the central atom, the structural characteristics of the ligands, the solvent system, and the counter ions can greatly affect the construction of coordination networks, making the prediction of the ﬁnal supramolecular framework really difﬁcult. Although there have been plenty of MOFs reported, it is still a big challenge to synthesize structures under control by altering synthetic conditions, especially for solvothermal reactions [14]. In order to obtain functional complexes, the ligands used in many cases are rigid [15–17]. In recent years, there have also been growing interests in ﬂexible ligands [18–20]. In contrast to rigid ligands that have little or no conforma- tional changes when they interact with metal ions, the ﬂexible ligands have more possible coordination modes because they can adopt different conformations according to the geometric needs of different metal ions. Due to the ﬂexibility of hydroquinone-O,O0-diacetic acid (H2qda) and 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp), they may adopt different conformations and coordination modes to form new coor- dination polymers. Thus in this work, H2qda and bpp were selected as mixed ﬂexible ligands to react with Zinc nitrate or Cadmium nitrate under hydrothermal conditions, which produced two new coordination polymers. Herein, we report their synthesis, crystal structures and photolumi- nescent properties. 2 Experimental 2.1 General Material and Method All reagents and solvents were commercially available and used as received without puriﬁcation.

IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet IR200 FT-IR spectrometer as KBr pellets (4,000–400 cm-1). Fluorescent spectra were obtained on a Hitachi F-4600 spectroﬂuorometer. 2.2 Preparation of Compounds 2.2.1 [Zn(qda)(bpp)]n (1) To a mixture of H2qda (0.0226 g, 0.1 mmol), bpp (0.0197 g, 0.1 mmol), NaOH (0.008 g, 0.2 mmol) and Zn(NO3)26H2O (0.030 g, 0.1 mmol) was added 4.0 mL deionized water. After thoroughly stirred in air at ambient temperature for about half an hour, the mixture was placed in a 15 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated to 120 C for 72 h to give rise to colorless block crystals of 1, which were collected by ﬁltration. The colorless crystals were collected by ﬁltration, washed with water and dried in air. Yield: 0.022 g (45 % based on H2qda). Anal. Calcd. for C23H22N2O6Zn (%): C 56.58, H 4.51, N 5.74.

The selected crystal was mounted on glass ﬁber and then the crystallo- graphic data collection was carried out on a Bruker Smart ApexII CCD area-detector diffractometer with graphite- monochromated Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 23 C using x and u-scan technique. The SAINT program [21] was used for the integration of diffraction data and the intensity corrections of the Lorentz and Polarization effects. Semiempirical absorption correction was applied by using the SADABS program [22].The crystal structures of 1 and 2 were solved by direct method using SIR97 program [23] and reﬁned anisotropically for all non- hydrogen atoms by full-matrix least squares on all F2 data using SHELXL97 [24]. The single suite WINGX was used as an integrated system for all the crystallographic pro- grams [25]. The hydrogen atoms of the water solvent molecules in 2 were not found from the Fourier map and an effort was made to ﬁnd it using CALC-OH program inte- grated in WINGX yet without a success, so the hydrogen atoms of the water solvent molecules in 2 were not located. All other hydrogen atoms were added according to theo- retical models, assigned isotropic displacement parameters and allowed to ride on their respective parent atoms, the Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C). Crystal data and a structure deter- mination summary for 1 and 2 were listed in Table 1. The selected bond lengths and angles for 1 and 2 were listed in Table 2. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Structure Description 3.1.1 [Zn(qda)(bpp)]n (1) Compound 1 crystallizes in triclinic system with a P1 space group. The asymmetric unit contains one Zn cation, one qda anion and one bpp molecule. In the crystal structure, there is only one crystallographically unique Zn atom. As shown in Fig. 1, each Zn1 adopts a distorted pyramidal coordination geometry, coordinated by two N atoms (Zn– N = 2.036(2) and 2.097 (2) A˚ ) from two different bpp molecules, as well as by two O atoms (Zn–O = 1.947(2) and 1.949(2) A˚ ) from two different qda anions, however, a ﬁfth weak interaction between Zn1 and O6 (2.574(2) A˚ ) is observed. Each two adjacent Zn ions are linked by the bpp molecule, forming a 1D [Zn(bpp)]n chain. The bpp Fig. 2 The 2D layer structure of compound 1 assembled from [Zn(bpp)]n chains and [Zn(qda)]n chains Fig. 1 The coordination environments of the Zn cation in compound 1 with the ellipsoid of 50 % probability.

The qda anion links two Zn ions in a l1 - g1/l1 - g1 coordination mode with two different trans conformations (Scheme 1), forming a 1D [Zn(qda)]n chain structure. These two kinds of chains are intercon- nected together with the single node Zn metal center into two-dimensional (2D) layer structure parallel to (01-1) plane (Fig. 2). Topologically, compound 1 can be reduced as sql net with point symbol for net: {4462} (Fig. 3). 3.1.2 {[Cd(qda)(bpp)2]2H2O}n (2) Compound 2 crystallizes in monoclinic system with a C2/c space group. The asymmetric unit contains one Cd cation, half qda anion, one bpp molecule and solvent water molecules. As in compound 1, there is also only one crystallographically unique Cd atom in compound 2. As shown in Fig. 4, the Cd metal center is located on an inversion center, possessing a slightly distorted octahedral geometry which is completed by two oxygen atoms (O1, O1A) from two carboxylate groups of two different qda anions at the apical positions and four nitrogen atoms (N1B, N1C, N2, N2A) in the equatorial plane from four different bpp molecules. The average distance between Cd1 and oxygen atoms is 2.308(3) A˚ ; which for Cd1–N2 and Cd1–N1B is 2.328(3) and 2.381(3) A˚ , respectively. Each two adjacent Cd ions are linked by two bpp mole- cules, constructing a 1D [Zn(bpp)2]n chain along to [1–10] direction (Fig. 5a). The bpp molecule in compound 2 adopts the same anti-gauche coordination conformation as that in compound 1. As shown in Fig. 2b, the neighboring [Zn(bpp)2]n chains are further connected to 2D layered structure by qda anions in a l1 - g1/l1 - g1 coordination mode with one trans conformation (Scheme 1b). 3.2 Photoluminescence Properties There have been reports about the photoluminescence properties of carboxylate containing systems with a d10 metal [26]. The solid-state luminescent emission spectra of 1, 2, and H2qda were studied at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 6, the emission of H2qda shows a broad peak at 450 nm upon excited at 390 nm, which could be ascri- bed to the p* ? n or p* ? p electronic transitions. Compared with the luminescence of H2qda ligand, com- pound 1 and 2 both display strong emission with maximum band at 453 nm and 451 nm upon excitation at 350 nm and 340 nm, respectively, which may be assigned to metal- perturbed p* ? n or p* ? p charge transfer emission due Fig. 6 The ﬂuorescent emission spectra of 1 and 2 in solid state at room temperature Fig. 5 a The 1D [Cd(bpp)2]n chain structure of compound 2. b View of the 2D layer of compound 2 Fig. 4 View of the coordination environment of Cd cation in compound 2 with the ellipsoid of 50 % probability. The solvent water molecules and hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity (symmetry codes: A -x ? 2, -y, -z ? 1; B -x ? 3/2, -y ? 1/2, -z ? 1; C x ? 1/2, y - 1/2, z) 1072 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:1069–1073 123 to their remarkable resemblance of the emission bands with those of the H2qda ligands [27]. Notably, signiﬁcant enhancement in the emission intensity of compound 1 and 2 is realized compared with the free ligand. The enhance- ment of luminescence in both of 1 and 2 might be attrib- uted to the ligation of the ligands to metal centers and the reduce of the energy loss through a radiation less pathway due to the coordination enhancing the rigidity of the ligand [28]. The intensity difference between 1 and 2 might result from different metal centers and conformational ligands as well as weak interactions in the crystal packing, which may affect the rigidity of the whole network and further the energy transfer involved in the luminescence [29]. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have synthesized two new coordination polymers with Zn2? and Cd2? ions under hydrothermal conditions using two ﬂexible oxygen-containing ligands and nitrogen-containing ligands. Both compounds show 2D layered structure, in which the bpp molecules adopt the same anti-gauche coordination conformation but the qda anions display two different trans conformations. The different conformations of qda anions in these two com- pounds are mainly induced by different metal coordination conﬁgurations in compound 1 and 2, considering that other synthetic parameters were intentionally held constant. Moreover, the photoluminescence behaviors of 1 and 2 were also discussed. 5 Supplementary Material Crystallographic information of the two compounds has been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as supplementary publication number CCDC [Zn (qda)(bpp)]n (868374) and CCDC {[Cd(qda)(bpp)2]2H2 O}n (868375).
