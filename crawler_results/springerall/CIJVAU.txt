Manuscript The anion-directed self-assembly of manganese complexes derived from 2-ethoxy-6-[(2-phenylaminoethylimino)methyl]phenol Zhong-Lu You • Mei Zhang • Dong-Mei Xian • Hai-Hua Li • Qian-Feng Weng Received: 12 December 2011 / Accepted: 31 January 2012 / Published online: 12 February 2012  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012 Abstract The mixed valence manganese(II/IV) complex, [MnIIL2(MeOH)2][MnIVL2(OAc)2]2(MeOH) (1), and the chloride-bridged 1D polymeric manganese(III) complex, [MnIIIL2(l-Cl)]n (2), where L is the deprotonated form of 2-ethoxy-6-[(2-phenylaminoethylimino)methyl]phenol (HL), have been prepared and structurally characterized by single- crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and IR spectra. The Mn atoms in both complexes are octahedrally coordinated. The self-assembly of the complex structures is apparently direc- ted by the anions of the manganese salts. Introduction A large number of Schiff base complexes of copper(II), zinc(II),nickel(II),andcobalt(II/III)havebeenreported[1–5]. The Schiff base manganese complexes have been found to possess interesting catalytic properties [6–8], biological activities [9, 10], and magnetic properties [11–13]. However, the number of manganese complexes with Schiff base ligands is still relatively small. Due to our present state of knowledge, the systematic design and synthesis of such complexes with predictable molecular structures are still great challenges, since different kinds of interactions and many subtle factors play important roles during the self-assembly processes [14–16]. Thus, the rational design and synthesis of manganese complexes, with a view to understand the factors that inﬂu- ence the ﬁnal structures, are of continuing interest in coordi- nation and structural chemistry. A search of the Cambridge Crystallographic Database (version 5.31 with addenda up to May 2011) [17] has revealed that chloride-bridged polymeric manganese complexes are very rare [18–20], and no mixed valencedmanganese (II/IV)complexeswithSchiff baseshave so far been reported. Hirotsu and coworkers reported the anion-controlled assembly of several manganese complexes with Schiff bases [14]. As an extension of previous work on the anion-directed self-assembly of such complexes, in the present work, the novel mixed valence manganese(II/IV) complex, [MnIIL2(MeOH)2][MnIVL2(OAc)2]2(MeOH) (1), and the novel chlorido-bridged 1D polymeric manganese(III) complex, [MnIIIL2(l-Cl)]n (2), where L is the deprotonated form of 2-ethoxy-6-[(2-phenylaminoethylimino)methyl]phe- nol (HL; Scheme 1), have been prepared and characterized. Experimental 5-Ethoxysalicylaldehyde and N-phenylethane-1,2-diamine (AR grade) were purchased from Lancaster. Other reagents and solvents were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company and used as received. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet AVATAR 360 spectrometer as KBr pellets in the 4,000–400 cm-1 region. C, H, and N analyses were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Analyzer Model 240. The Schiff base was synthesized according to the literature method [21]. Preparation of [MnIIL2(MeOH)2][MnIVL2(OAc)2] 2(MeOH) (1) To a stirred methanol solution (50 ml) of the Schiff base HL (0.28 g, 1.0 mmol) was added an aqueous solution (5 ml) of manganese acetate (0.17 g, 1.0 mmol).

Diffraction quality single crystals of the complex were obtained after a few days by slow evaporation of the ﬁltrate in air. The crystals were collected by ﬁltration, washed three times with cold methanol, and dried in air. Yield: 63%. Anal. Found (%): C, 61.1; H, 6.7; N, 7.7. Calcd (%) for C76H98Mn2N8O16: C, 61.3; H, 6.6; N, 7.5. Characteristic IR data (KBr, cm-1): 3,413 (br, w, mOH), 3,326 (sh, w, mNH), 1,616 (vs, mC=N), 1,614 (vs, mC=N), 1,555 (s, masCH3COO), 1,466 (s, msCH3COO). Preparation of [MnIIIL2(l-Cl)]n (2) Complex (2) was prepared by a similar procedure as that described for (1), but with manganese acetate replaced by manganese chloride (0.20 g, 1.0 mmol). Yield: 54%. Anal. Found (%): C, 61.8; H, 5.9; N, 8.6. Calcd (%) for C34H38ClMnN4O4: C, 62.1; H, 5.8; N, 8.5. Characteristic IR data (KBr, cm-1): 3,339 (sh, w, mNH), 1,615 (vs, mC=N). X-ray crystallography Single crystals of the complexes were mounted on thin glass ﬁbers. Diffraction intensities for the complexes were collected at 298(2) K using a Bruker SMART 1000 CCD area detector with Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). The collected data were reduced using the SAINT program [22], and multi-scan absorption corrections were performed using the SADABS program [23]. The structures of the complexes were solved by direct methods and reﬁned against F2 by full-matrix least-squares methods using the SHELXTL program [24]. All of the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. The amino and methanol H atoms in the complexes were located from difference Fourier maps and reﬁned isotropically, with N–H and O–H distances restrained to 0.90(1) and 0.85(1) A˚ , respectively. The remaining hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and constrained to ride on their parent atoms. The crystallographic data for the complexes are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 2. Crystallographic data for the complexes have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center [CCDC 769313 (1) and 857871 (2)]. Results and discussion The complexes (1) and (2) were prepared by the reaction of the Schiff base HL with manganese acetate and manganese chloride, respectively, in methanol. The complexes were characterized by satisfactory elemental analysis, IR spectra, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. On aerial oxi- dation in methanol, the MnII atoms in the manganese acetate and chloride starting materials were changed to MnIV in (1) and MnIII in (2). Both complexes are soluble in methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, DMF, and DMSO, but insoluble in water.

In the IR spectra, the strong absorption bands of the azomethine groups (C=N) are at 1,616 and 1,614 cm-1 for (1) and at 1,615 cm-1 for (2). The weak and broad absorption at 3,413 cm-1 for (1) is assigned to the O–H stretching vibrations of methanol, which is absent in the spectrum of (2). Weak and sharp bands indicative of the N–H groups are at 3,326 cm-1 for (1) and at 3,339 cm-1 for (2). The asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the acetate ligands in (1) are observed at 1,555 and 1,466 cm-1, respectively. X-ray crystallography reveals that the asymmetric unit of complex (1) contains one mononuclear centrosymmetric manganese(II) complex [MnIIL2(MeOH)2], (Mn2), one mononuclear centrosymmetric manganese(IV) complex [MnIVL2(OAc)2], (Mn1), and two methanol molecules (Fig. 1). The Mn1 atom in (1) has octahedral coordination, with phenolate O and imine N atoms from two Schiff base ligands deﬁning the equatorial plane, plus the O atoms from two acetate ligands occupying the axial positions. The Mn2 atom in (1) also has octahedral coordination, with phenolate O and imine N atoms from two Schiff base ligands deﬁning the equatorial plane and with the O atoms from two methanol ligands occupying the axial positions. The Mn1 and Mn2 atoms are located within the least- squares planes deﬁned by the four equatorial donor atoms. The bond lengths of Mn1–O1 [1.871(2) A˚ ] and Mn1–N1 [2.046(2) A˚ ] for atom Mn1 are comparable to those of Mn2–O3 [1.858(2) A˚ ] and Mn2–N3 [2.045(2) A˚ ] for Mn2. It is obvious that the axial Mn1–O5 bond [2.183(2) A˚ ] and the Mn2-O7 bond [2.214(2) A˚ ] are much longer than those in the equatorial planes. This axial elongation can be attributed to Jahn–Teller distortion, which is commonly observed in octahedral manganese(III) complexes.

Displacement ellipsoids are drawn at the 30% probability level. Atoms labeled with the sufﬁx A or unlabeled in Mn1 molecule are at the symmetry position 2-x, 2-y, -z. Atoms labeled with the sufﬁx B or unlabeled in Mn2 molecule are at the symmetry position -x, 1-y, 1-z Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:279–283 281 123 The Mn1–O5 bond is shorter than the Mn2-O7 bond, which can be explained by the neutral nature of the methanol ligand, compared with the anionic acetate ligand. The coordinate bond lengths for Mn1 and Mn2 are close to those in other manganese(III) complexes with Schiff bases [15, 26]. The equatorial bond angles are all close to 90. In the crystal structure of (1), the methanol molecules are linked to the [MnIIL2(MeOH)2] and [MnIVL2(OAc)2] complex molecules through intermolecular N4–H4AO8, O8–H8O6, and N2–H2O8 hydrogen bonds. The com- plex molecules are further linked by intermolecular O7– H7AO6 hydrogen bonds formed between the methanol and acetate ligands, to form chains running along the c axis, as shown in Fig. 2. There are no obvious short contacts among the chains. The smallest repeat unit of the 1D polymeric manga- nese(III) complex (2) contains two [MnL2]? cations and one chloride bridge (Fig. 3). The MnMn distance is 4.721(1) A˚ . Each Mn atom shows octahedral coordination, with phenolate O and imine N atoms from two Schiff base ligands deﬁning the equatorial plane and with two Cl atoms occupying the axial positions. The bond lengths of Mn1– O1 [1.862(1) A˚ ] and Mn1–N1 [2.044(2) A˚ ] in the Mn1 coordination sphere are comparable with the bond lengths of Mn2–O3 [1.862(2) A˚ ] and Mn2–N3 [2.034(2) A˚ ] in the Mn2 coordination sphere. It is obvious that the axial Mn1- Cl1 bond [2.617(1) A˚ ] and the Mn2–Cl1 bond [2.619(1) A˚ ] are much longer than those in the equatorial planes, which again can be attributed to Jahn–Teller distortion. The bond lengths and angles subtended at Mn1 and Mn2 are com- parable to each other and also comparable to those in complex (1) as well as to other Schiff base manganese(III) complexes [27–29]. The equatorial bond angles are all close to 90. In the crystal structure of (2), the [MnL2]? cations are linked by Cl atoms, to form chains running along the a axis, as shown in Fig. 4.

The anions from the metal salts can inﬂuence the valence of the Mn atoms and the structures of the complexes. The results of this study may help the further design and development of new complexes by varying metal salts.
