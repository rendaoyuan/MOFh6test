Omojasola Received: 2 April 2014 / Accepted: 24 June 2014 / Published online: 17 July 2014  Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014 Abstract A novel –M–X–M–X– type inﬁnite chain 1D copper(II) complex of Eﬂornithine, Dichloro-[2-amino-5- ammonio-2-(diﬂuoromethyl)pentanoate]copper(II) hydrate, [Cu(C6H12F2N2O2)Cl2]H2O 1 has been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, spectroscopic tech- niques (UV/Vis and FT-IR), TGA and X-ray diffraction. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the complex 1 showed the structure to be monoclinic with space group Cc, a = 13.1295(15) A˚ , b = 12.1859(14) A˚ , c = 8.1927(9) A˚ , b = 118.359(3) A˚ , V = 1153.5(2) A˚ 3, Z = 4. The com- plex exhibits a quadratic planar coordination of the Cu- atom. The Cu(II) centre is coordinated by two chloride atoms, an oxygen atom of the carboxyl- and a nitrogen atom of the amino-group, respectively, forming a quadratic planar geometry. The terminal amino group of the ligand is protonated to form NH3 ? while the carboxylic moiety is deprotonated to form Zwitterionic eﬂornithine ligand, with the coordination of the metal at the nitrogen atom of the second amino group. The compound has –M–X–M–X– inﬁnite 1D chain polymeric structure. Two neigbouring Cu(EFL)Cl chain units are bridged by an Cl- ion, forming a –Cu–Cl–Cu–Cl– linear chain structure along C-axis. The antibacterial activities of the complex on Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudo- monas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) were investigated and found to be active at higher concentration than the parent ligand.

The disease progresses from haemolymphatic infection (ﬁrst stage disease), which is characterized by fever, headaches, joint pains and itching to meningoen- cephalitic (neurological phase) (second stage) which begins when the parasite invades the central nervous sys- tem. Disruption of the sleep cycle is a leading symptom of this stage [1]. Tryptophol is a chemical compound that induces sleep in humans and this is produced by the Try- panosoma in sleeping sickness [2]. Other neurological symptoms include confusion, tremor, general muscles weakness, paralysis of a limb [3]. Damage caused in the neurological phase is irreversible [4]. Most patients with second stage disease are treated with a series of intravenous injections of melarsoprol. This drug has been used since 1949 but is associated with severe toxic effects, in partic- ular a reactive encephalopathy, which affects 5–10 % of patients, with 10–70 % of these cases dying [5, 6]. The encephalopathy cannot be predicted, prevented, or man- aged satisfactorily, despite half a century of investigations. Melarsoprol related death rates are about 6 % [7]. An additional concern is the increase in treatment failures with melarsoprol, as high as 30 %, reported in several foci in J. A. Obaleye (&)  A. C. Tella  W. A. Osunniran  N.

Eﬂornithine initially evaluated for the treatment of cancer, is the only alternative drug registered for the treatment of second stage human African trypano- somiasis especially West Africa form. The drug exerts a trypanostatic effect by inhibiting the parasite’s ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme needed for the synthesis of polyamines, themselves involved in cell multiplication and differentiation [11–13]. Adverse effects of Eﬂornithine include seizures, gastrointestinal disorders, and myelosup- pression. A major disadvantage of the drug is the labour intense mode of its administration, requiring one intrave- nous infusion every 6 h for 14 days (56 infusions in total). Even though, Eﬂornithine is considered as the safer drug to treat Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), the difﬁ- culties in logistics as stated above actually necessitate urgent need for alternative therapy. In search for a pharmacological control of HAT disease, metal complexes appear to be a promising new approach [14, 15]. The use of metal complexes as pharmaceuticals, particularly modiﬁcation of existing drug by coordination to metal centre has shown promising results recently [16, 17]. The efﬁcacy of therapeutic agent is known to be enhanced upon coordination to metal ion [18]. Metal ions are electron deﬁcient, whereas most biological molecules such drug and protein are electron rich. The attraction between these opposite charges leads to a general tendency for metal ions to bind and interact with biological mole- cules [19]. Copper was chosen for its importance in bio- logical and physiological activities that mediate a multitude of chemical reaction needed for life [20–22]. Copper complexes of various pharmaceutical active ingredients are reported in the literature [23–27]. It is interesting to state that little has appeared in the literature on antitrypanosomiasis metal complexes particularly Eﬂornithine hydrochloride. In continuation of our studies coordination of metal with biologically important ligand, we report the ﬁrst crystal structure of zwitterion novel copper complex containing Eﬂornithine hydrochloride hydrate as ligand (Fig. 1). 2 Experimental Section 2.1 Materials The Eﬂornithine hydrochloride hydrate was commercially obtained and used without further puriﬁcation. Hydrated metal salts (CuCl22H2O), used for complexation was obtained from British Drug House (BDH) Poole, England. 2.2 Synthesis of the Complex 2.2.1 Synthesis of [Cu(C6H12F2N2O2)Cl2]H2O 1 This complex was synthesized by adding to a solution of Eﬂornithine hydrochloride hydrate (0.2367 g, 1 mmol) in distilled water (10 ml), a solution of CuCl22H2O (0.1705 g, 1 mmol) in methanol (10 ml). The mixture was stirred for 1 h, the blue precipitate formed was separated out by ﬁltration and washed with methanol (Scheme 1). Single blue crystal suitable for X-ray analysis was obtained by vapour diffusion at room temperature of methanolic solution of complex with hexane as antisolvent.

IR spectra on the range of 4,000–400 cm1 were obtained from samples in the form of KBr pellets using FTIR-8501 Schimadzu Spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a TA instrument TAQ-500. Sample of 1-2 mg was heated at 10 C min-1 under nitrogen gas ﬂow (50 ml min-1). Electronic absorption spectra (200–1,100 nm) were recorded using JENWAY 6405 Uv/Vis spectrophotometer. The melting points were determined on MPA100 Optimelt Automated Melting Point System. 2.4 Crystallographic Data Collection and Structural Analysis For complex 1 single crystal suitable for X-ray crystal- lography were obtained by slow vapour diffusion of NH2 F F H2N O OH H2O HCl Fig. 1 Molecular structure of Eﬂornithine hydrochloride hydrate 828 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:827–835 123 methanolic solution of complex with hexane as antisolvent.

Nutrient broth was seeded with standard- ized inocula of the test organisms. These were challenged with varying concentrations of the Copper II complex and Ligand (EFL) samples. For the antimicrobial susceptibility testing, ten clinical antibiotics with their concentrations given in parentheses were used as control as recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 2006) [31]. The antibiotics used to challenge P. aeruginosa and E. coli being gram negative organisms were cipro- ﬂoxacin (10 lg), gentamycin (10 lg), perﬂoxacin (30 lg) and tarivid (10 lg). Those used for S. aureus a gram positive organism were erythromycin (30 lg), gentamycin (10 lg), augumentin (30 lg), chloramphenicol (10 lg), cotrimoxazole (10 lg), streptomycin (30 lg) and cipro- ﬂoxacin (10 lg). 3 Results and Discussions The preparation of EFL-copper(II) complex (EFL = C6H12F2N2O2) can be represented by general scheme thus: C6H12F2N2O2 ð Þ ½   HClH2O þ CuCl22H2O ! stirred=reflux ½MeOH;H2O Cu C6H12F2N2O2 ð ÞCl2 ½ H2O The complexes are generally soluble in distilled water and DMSO, but insoluble in common organic solvents. The elemental analysis result of the complex is in good agree- ment with the formula [Cu(C6H12F2N2O2)Cl2]H2O and conﬁrmed by X-ray crystal structure of 1. Determination of stoichiometric ratio using Job’s method suggested mole ratio 1:1 metal to ligand. The complex consists of metal ion which coordinates through the nitrogen atom of the amino and oxygen atom of the carboxylate groups of the ligand with two chloride ions to form tetrahedral structure. The complex formed Zwitterionic structure. The termi- nal amino group of the ligand is protonated to form NH3 ? while the carboxylic moiety is deprotonated to form Zwitterionic eﬂornithine ligand, with the coordination of the metal at the nitrogen atom of the second amino group. This ﬁnding is in agreement with our previous work on metal complex of quinine in which quinine ligand is pro- tonated to form Zwitterionic ligand [32]. The structure can also be compared with a molecular L-histidinium trichlorozincate[L-histidine H?] ZnCl3. This is an example of protonation/deprotonation species N–H and O–H stretching [33]. Protonation at the amino group removes the free lone pair electron of the nitrogen atom and this limits the hydrogen bonding of the N-terminus to a donor only site [34]. Water is attached to one of the three hydrogen atoms of the protonated amino group. The formula of the structure gives a net formula charge of -1, the excess negative charge of -1 is then balanced by protonation of the Eﬂornithine ligand as given in the formula. 3.1 Infrared Spectra Characterization The infrared spectra of the metal complex in the far IR region 4,000–400 cm-1 was compared with that of the ligand as shown in Fig. 2. The infra-red spectra of the complex was found to be different from that of the ligand and showed either a shift or disappearance of some char- acteristic frequencies and appearance of some new fre- quencies. In the ligand two amino groups are present. The terminal one is protonated and the second is involved in coordination with copper ion. The absorption band at 3,242–3,142 cm-1 assigned to the N–H stretching is due to protonation of terminal amino group to form NH3 ?. This is evidenced by the appearance of two characteristic absorption bands between 1,600 and 1,453 cm-1, one is at 1,600–1,512 cm-1 representing asym- metric bending vibration and another at 1,452–1,303 cm-1 representingsymmetric vibration mode ofNH3 ? [35, 36].The sharp and medium intensity based at 3,381 cm-1 (assigned to N–H stretching in the ligand) shifted to 3,491 cm-1. This is 4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 200 220 240 260 280 300 320 340 360 [Cu(EFL)(Cl2)]H2O Eflornithine ligand % Transmittance wavenumber(cm -1) Fig. 2 FT-IR spectra of Eﬂornithine ligand and [Cu(EFL)Cl2]H2O complex 830 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:827–835 123 probably due to the involvement of second NH2 group in coordination with the copper ion [37]. A strong band observed at 3,553 cm-1 is assignable to H(OH) lattice water [38, 39] which is supported by the bending mode at 1,650 cm-1. Hydrogen bonding between the NH of the NH3 ? of the ligand and OH of the water shows peak at 2,581 and 2,481 cm-1. In the IR spectrum of the free, Eﬂornithine ligand there is a strong absorption band at 1,639 cm-1 for the COOH group. In the Cu (II) complex, this absorption band is absent due to deprotonation and the band due to asymmetric stretch masym(COO-) and the symmetric stretch msym(COO-) are observed at 1,651 and 1,373 cm-1 respectively [40]. The difference masym(COO) and msym(COO-) being 278 cm-1 can be taken as a proof of unidentate coordination of the carboxylate group to the central atom [41]. This is in good agreement with the results obtained from X-ray diffraction measurements. The mC–O stretching frequency in C–O–H observed at 1,273 and 1,211 cm-1 in the free ligand has shifted to 1,280 and 1,246 cm-1 in the spectra of all com- plexes due to coordination of OH via deprotonation [42]. There is no change in position and intensity of absorption band at 1,281 cm-1 due to m(C–F) in eﬂornithine ligand after coordination. This indicates that ﬂuorine atoms are not involved in coordination to the metal. The peak position is the same in other ﬂuorine containing compounds [19]. The low frequency skeletal vibration due to M–O, M–N and M-Cl stretching provide direct evidence for complex- ation. The bands in the 569, 505 and 434 cm-1 have been assigned to m (M–O) and m (M–N) vibrations respectively [43, 44]. 3.2 Electronic Spectra The UV–VIS spectrum of Eﬂornithine hydrochloride hydrate showed absorption peaks at wavelengths between 218 and 314 nm which are assigned to II–II*, n–II* inter ligand transition. This band is shifted to higher energy in the complexes. The low intense band (348–355 nm) found in complexes is assignable to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) [45, 46] transition. The blue crystal of Cu (II) exhibited another broad band at 660 nm which is attributed to d–d transition (2T2–2E) which is an evidence of distorted tetrahedral structure. 3.3 Thermogravimetric Analysis Thermogravimetric analysis curve of the complex 1 is given in Fig. 3. Thermal analysis shows that the compound is stable at room temp. The thermal behavior of the com- plex was followed up to 400 C. In the ﬁrst stage of ther- mal decomposition the complex starts to lose one water molecule between 118 and 160 C with the experimental loss of 5.89 % (calc. mass loss 5.39 %). The second stage between 160 and 235 C is related to the release of one eﬂornithine ligand (found = 55.58 %, calc. = 54.50 %). The experimental mass loss agrees with the calculated for the two decomposition stages. 55.58% (0.8782mg) 202.35°C 235.02°C 5.889% (0.09304mg) 118.23°C 138.65°C 20 40 60 80 100 120 Weight (%) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Temperature (°C) Sample: alfa Size: 1.5800 mg Method: RT-400@ 10 TGA File: C:...\Administrator\Desktop\alfa.001 Operator: Clement Run Date: 12-Oct-2013 13:31 Instrument: TGA Q500 V20.13 Build 39 Universal V4.5A TA Instruments Fig. 3 The TGA curve of the [Cu(C6H12F2N2O2)Cl2]H2O J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:827–835 831 123 3.4 Description of the Crystal Structure of Complex 1 The Ortep representation of the structure of 1, indicating atom numbering scheme, is shown in Fig. 4 and selected bond length and bond angles are listed in Table 2. The complex exhibits a quadratic planar coordination of the Cu- atom. The Cu(II) centre is coordinated by two chloride atoms [d = 2.2834(3) and 2.2324(3) A˚ ], an oxygen atom [d = 1.9469(8) A˚ ] of the carboxyl- and a nitrogen atom [d = 2.0269(8) A˚ ] of the amino-group, respectively, forming a quadratic planar environment in the ﬁrst coor- dination sphere. Another chloride ion of a neighboring complex molecule (1) is located at a distance of 2.948(3) A˚ from the copper atom, leading to a 4 ? 1 coordination in a square-pyramidal fashion and interconnecting the complex molecules 1 to inﬁnite linear chains running along the crystallographic c-axis (cf. Fig. 5). The crystal structure contains one water molecule, connecting three molecules of 1 via two oxygen atoms of the carboxyl-groups and one hydrogen-atom of the ammonium-group, respectively. All hydrogen atoms attached to N were reﬁned freely, the hydrogen atoms attached to C and O were reﬁned with the riding model. The Cu–N (2.023 A˚ ), Cu–O (1.947 A˚ ) and Cu–Cl (mean = 2.257 A˚ ) are normal and are similar to those observed for copper(II) complexes of related bio- logical ligands [47–50]. As expected Cu–N (2.023 A˚ ) bonds are larger than the Cu–O (1.947 A˚ ) one, this observation is similar to the study reported earlier which involved coordination of copper via amino nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen atoms of the square planar [51]. All the planar angles are distorted to a slight extent, the square planar angles are Cl1–Cu1–Cl2 94.9 (12), O2–Cu1–Cl2 82.21 (3), O2–Cu1–N1 83.16 (3) and N1–Cu1–Cl1 95.39 (3) as compared to ideal square planar angle of 90, indicating that the coordination geometry is quadratic planar [52]. The bonds O2–Cu1–Cl1 and N1–Cu1–Cl2 have angles of 175.81 (3) and 168.50 (2) respectively which are close to 180 in line with the quadratic planar arrangement. The compound is halogen-bridged metal complexes. It has –M–X–M–X– inﬁnite 1D chain poly- meric structure. Two neigbouring Cu(EFL)Cl chain units are bridged by an Cl- ion, forming a –Cu–Cl–Cu–Cl– linear chain structure along C-axis (Fig. 5). The chain structure of MXM is stabilized with the ligand by hydrogen bonds between –NH3 ? (ammonio ion) and oxygen atoms of water. This ﬁnding is in close agreement with similar studies by previous worker [53]. Protonation of N2 results in slight increase in N–C–C bond angle which are greater in protonated amine bond angles (N2–C5–C4111.52 (9)) as compared with unprot- onated amino group N1–C2–C1 109.13 (7) probably due to shift of Ione pair electron of the nitrogen atoms towards their protons [54]. Furthermore, the N–C distances are slightly different. The N2–C5 (1.496 A˚ ) of the protonated amine is [N1–C2 (1.4830 A˚ ) of the unprotonated amino group, this may be due to electron withdrawing behavior of Fig. 4 Ortep diagram of molecular structure of 1 with numbering scheme adopted. Ellipsoids are shown at 50 % probability level 832 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:827–835 123 the proton leading to increase of N–C–C angle and lengthening of the N–C bond [19]. 3.5 Antibacterial Results The results of the antibacterial screening as contained in Tables 3 and 4 show appreciable activity of the drug metal complexes compare to the ligand when challenged with test organisms at varying concentrations. Copper complex was effective at virtually all concentrations used except against E. coli and P. aeruginosa at 0.0001 gL-1. Highest susceptibility to Copper complex was recorded by S. aur- eus with clearance zone of 4.2 mm at 1.0 gL-1. The results show that all the metal-drug complex pos- sesses a measure of antibacterial activity against all the organisms tested. The results also agree with the ﬁndings of other researchers [55, 56] that antibacterial potency is usually concentration dependent. The data as shown in Tables 5, 6 and 7 also revealed that the activity of the Ligand EFL was bacteriostatic against all the organisms tested, while the activity of the copper (II) complex was bacteriostatic against E. coli and P. aeruginosa but bactericidal against S. aureus at 0.0001 g/L concentration.

A quadratic planar structure was assigned to the complex by analyzing elemental analysis, FTIR, electronic spectra, TGA and X-ray crystallographic. To the best of our knowledge, the single X-ray crystal structure of copper complex obtained represents the ﬁrst copper crystal struc- ture of eﬂornithine hydrochloride hydrate which is zwit- terionic with –M–X–M–X– inﬁnite chain 1D structure. The screening data revealed that the complex exhibits more efﬁcient antimicrobial activity than the free ligand. These ﬁndings may lead to development of novel metal based drugs. 5 Supporting Information Available CCDC 969579 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.
