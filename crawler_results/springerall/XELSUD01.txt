Synthesis and X-ray structural characterization of three complexes of type cis-[M(dafone)2(NCS)2] (M = Co(II), 1; Ni(II), 2; Zn(II), 3; dafone = 4,5-diazaﬂuoren-9-one) and a polymer cis-[Cd(dafone)(NCS)2]n (4) have been reported. Each of the four complexes is crystallized in orthorhombic crystal system. Structural study reveals that each metal(II) centre in the four complexes adopts distorted octahedral geometry with MN6 chromophore in 1-3 and MN4S2 chromophore in 4. The room temperature steady-state ﬂuorescent intensity of dafone in dimethyl formamide at 402 nm is found to be quenched in these reported dafone complexes (1-4). Keywords. Transition metal ions; imine ligand; crystal structure; ﬂuorescence. 1. Introduction Design and synthesis of coordination compounds of different nuclearity are being continued1,2 because of their various synthetic, structural and physicochemical features. Different diimine ligands are being used3,4 in this direction because of synthetic accessibilities and spectroscopic properties of their own and the com- plexes synthesized there from. Common bipyridyls with diimine functions such as 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), etc. and their derivatives are often used3,4 to synthesize variety of complexes with different nuclearity and interesting properties. The ambidentate thiocyanates, having soft sulphur and hard nitrogen donor centres, show a number of coordina- tion motifs5 towards metal ions exhibiting different molecular structures with different dimensionalities.5 In recent times a number of transition and innertran- sition metal complexes from diimine donors as a part of Schiff base ligand had been reported by our group.6 In this study, we have used 4,5-diazaﬂuoren-9-one ∗For correspondence (dafone),7 the diimine with larger chelate bite than the bpy and phen (free dafone: 3.05 Å, bpy: 2.62 Å, phen: 2.64 Å),8 oxidized from 1,10-phenanthroline to synthe- size a series of complexes with Co(NCS)2(1), Ni(NCS)2 (2),8a,8b Zn(NCS)2 (3) and Cd(NCS)2 (4). Interestingly, the X-ray structural analyses in each case reveal that all these are cis complexes and the mononuclear cis moiety of Cd(NCS)2 forms polymer because of the soft-hard nature of the thiocyanate. The complexes also show room temperature steady-state ﬂuorescence behaviour. Though a few of the Cu(II),8a,8b,9 Ni(II),8a,8b Zn(II),8c Ru(II)10 and Pt(II)8c complexes of dafone are reported in literature, here we have tried to establish the structural systematics and photophysical behaviour of a group of new complexes including a reported one.8a,8b 2. Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the complexes 1-4 2.1a Chemicals, solvents and starting materials: High purity 1,10 phenanthroline (E Merck, India), potassium permanganate (E Merck, India), potassium 717 718 Abhijit Pal et al. hydroxide (E Merck, India), cobalt(II) perchlorate hexahydrate (E Merck, India) , nickel(II) nitrate hexa- hydrate (E Merck, India), zinc(II) acetate dihydrate (E Merck, India) and cadmium(II) acetate dihydrate (E Merck, India) and all other solvents were purchased from the respective companies and used as received. Solvents were dried according to standard procedure and distilled prior to use. (Caution! Perchlorate salts of metal ions are poten- tially explosive, especially in the presence of organic ligands. Only a small amount of material should be prepared and it should be handled with care.) 2.1b Preparation of L and 1-4: The ligand dafone was prepared using a reported method.10 The ligand was characterized by X-ray crystallography (ﬁgure 1, table 1). Dafone (0.364 g, 2 mmol) in methanol was added slowly to the methanolic solution of Co(ClO4)2 (0.361 g, 1 mmol) resulting in a light brown coloured solution which was intensiﬁed on gradual addition of NH4NCS (0.152 g, 2 mmol). The ﬁnal reaction solu- tion was kept in open air for slow evaporation. Light brown crystals appeared after about a week. Yield: (based on metal salt) 0.388 g (72.00%). Anal.

UV- Vis (λ, nm; dimethylformamide): 269, 304, 316, 528, 623. The aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2 (0.290 g, 1 mmol) in a beaker was mixed with dafone (0.364 g, 2 mmol) in methanol slowly. The solid NH4NCS (0.152 g, 2 mmol) was added in portion with continuous Figure 1. ORTEP of dafone with 20% ellipsoid probability for all non-hydrogen atoms. stirring. The resultant solution was kept in open air for slow evaporation to obtain green crystals after 7 days. Yield: (based on metal salt) 0.380 g (75.00%). Anal.

UV-Vis (λ, nm; dimethylformamide): 268, 304, 316, 592, 660. Solid Zn(OAc)2 (0.219 g, 1 mmol) and aqueous NH4NCS (0.152 g, 2 mmol) were consecutively added to methanolic solution of dafone (0.364 g, 2 mmol) to get a yellow solution. Light yellow crystals appeared from this solution after a week or so in open air at room temperature. Yield: (based on metal salt) 0.415 g (76.00%). Anal.

UV-Vis (λ, nm; dimethylfor- mamide): 271, 303, 316. Complex 4 was prepared following the same proce- dure as for 3. Only Cd(OAc)2 (0.266 g, 1 mmol) was used in place of Zn(OAc)2. The proportion of dafone (0.182 g, 1 mmol) and NH4NCS (0.152 g, 2 mmol) was also different. Yield: (based on metal salt) 0.575 g (70.00%). Anal.

UV-Vis, IR and ﬂuorescence spectra (KBr discs, 4000–300 cm−1) were recorded using a Shi- madzu UV-Vis 2450 spectrophotometer, Perkin–Elmer FT-IR 0model RX1 spectrometer and Perkin-Elmer LS55 ﬂuorimeter, respectively. 2.3 X-ray diffraction Single crystals of dafone and 1-4 suitable for X- ray crystallographic analysis were selected following examination under a microscope. Diffraction data at room temperature for dafone and 2, respectively and for 1, 3 and 4 were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX II CCD and Bruker-Kappa APEX II CCD diffrac- tometers, respectively using Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å).

(2) The complexes were characterized by microanaly- tical (C, H and N), spectroscopic and other physico- chemical results. The microanalytical data are in good conformity with the formulations of 1–4 (scheme 1). The moisture insensitive complexes are stable over long periods of time in powdery and crystalline states, and are soluble in dimethyl formamide only, but are insolu- ble in water, methanol, acetonitrile, etc. In the IR spec- tra, relatively intense peaks around 1580–1620 cm−1 due to the C=N stretching frequency and weak bands in the range of 2980–2900 cm−1 due to the aliphatic C-H stretching frequency appear in both the com- plexes. Characteristic bands for carbonyl in dafone and thiocyanate in complexes appear at ∼1720 and ∼2100 cm−1. 3.2 Description of crystal structure 3.2a X-ray structures: X-ray crystallographic char- acterization in each compound results in a distorted Structural systematics of some metal 721 Table 2.

Owing to the larger chelate bite in dafone than in bpy and phen (free dafone: 3.05 Å, bpy: 2.62 Å, phen: 2.64 Å),8 the complexes form one normal and one larger metal-imine bonds. Each of the crystal structures are described here. [Co(dafone)2(NCS)2] (1) Bond angle–bond distance data (table 2) describes the coordination geometry around Co(II) in 1 as a dis- torted cis-octahedron (ﬁgure 2) with two thiocyanates, where one imine nitrogen (N1*) and one thiocyanato nitrogen (N4*) occupy the axial position. The rest of the imine nitrogens (N1, N2 and N2*) from two organic ligand units and another thiocyanato nitrogen (N4) occupy equatorial positions.

[Ni(dafone)2(NCS)2] (2) Structural analysis reveals a distorted cis-octahedral geometry of 2 with Ni(II) at the metal centre (ﬁgure 3). According to bond angle–bond distance data (table 3), N7 (imine nitrogen) and N11 (thiocyanato nitrogen) are at axial position. The rest of the coor- dinating atoms N7*, N9, N9* (imine nitrogens) and N11* (thiocyanato nitrogen) are at the equatorial posi- tion. The bond distance ranges in axial and equatorial positions are same (0.196 Å). N coordination of thio- cyanate towards Ni(II) is conﬁrmed by the shorter N-C bond (table 3, 1.152(5) Å) than the C-S bond (table 3, 1.618(4) Å). [Zn(dafone)2(NCS)2] (3) Figure 3.

Bond distance ranges in the axial and equatorial positions are 0.0163 Å and 0.197 Å, respectively. Owing to the larger chelate bite, as stated earlier, it will be found from tables 2–5 that one of the metal– imine distances for a single bidentate dafone Co(1)- N(1), Ni(2)-N(7), Zn(1)-N(2), Cd(2)-N(1) is larger than the other Co(1)-N(2), Ni(2)-N(9*), Zn(1)-N(1), Cd(1)- N(2), respectively. In case of 3, hard N donors from dafone (the organic ligand backbone) make the borderline Zn(II) hard. Hence, N ends of NCS coordinate to Zn(II) making it a mononuclear complex with no S coordination. But for 4, hard N donors from dafone do not increase hardness of the soft Cd(II) centre to that extent so that coordi- nation with further N donor site(s) is possible. Rather, the soft S centre from another NCS unit binds to the Cd(II) centre. The N end of one NCS and S end of Figure 5.

Absorption bands of compounds 1 and 2 are assigned as spin allowed and that of 3 and 4 are intraligand transitions14 (ﬁgures S1–S4, Supplementary ﬁle). All its complexes (1–4) show broad emission band (excitations at 332, 335, 336 and 334, respectively) in dimethyl for- mamide at about same wavelength as in dafone indi- cating charge transfer nature of transition.15 Quench- ing of ﬂuorescence of an organic moiety (ligand) by its complexation with transition metal ions is a common phenomenon,16 which is explained by the process of magnetic perturbation, redox activity, electronic energy transfer, etc. Moreover, increasing spin–orbit coupling with heavier atoms relaxes the spin selection rule for radiative and radiationless transitions of the metal com- plexes resulting in quenching the emission intensity of lowest excited state.17 All these physical phenomena are responsible for ﬂuorescence intensity quenching in our complexes. 4. Conclusion We have synthesized and crystallographically charac- terized four metal complexes of Co(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) in combination with dafone and thio- cyanate. In each case, the complexes form cis iso- mer which is in good agreement with the previously reported compounds.8,9 The room temperature steady- state emission of dafone is quenched in its complexes which are also in good conformity with the standard theories of spin-orbit coupling, magnetic perturbation, redox activity, electronic energy transfer, etc. Supplementary information CCDC Nos. 941025, 941023 and 941024 contain sup- plementary crystallographic data for 1, 3 and 4, respec- tively.
