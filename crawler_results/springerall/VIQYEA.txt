Klein Gebbink Received: 3 May 2007 / Accepted: 2 August 2007 / Published online: 8 September 2007  SBIC 2007 Abstract The coordination chemistry of the 2-His-1-car- boxylate facial triad mimics 3,3-bis(1-methylimidazol-2-yl) propionate (MIm2Pr) and 3,3-bis(1-ethyl-4-isopropylimi- dazol-2-yl) propionate (iPrEtIm2Pr) towards ZnCl2 was studied both in solution and in the solid state. Different coordination modes were found depending both on the stoichiometry and on the ligand that was employed. In the 2:1 ligand-to-metal complex [Zn(MIm2Pr)2], the ligand coor- dinates in a tridentate, tripodal N,N,O fashion similar to the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad. However, the 1:1 ligand- to-metal complexes [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)] and [Zn(iPrE- tIm2Pr)Cl] were crystallographically characterized and found to be polymeric in nature. A new, bridging coordina- tion mode of the ligands was observed in both structures comprising N,N-bidentate coordination of the ligand to one zinc atom and O-monodentate coordination to a zinc second atom. A rather unique transformation of pyruvate into oxa- late was found with [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl], which resulted in the isolation of the new, oxalato bridged zinc coordination polymer [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)]6H2O, the structure of which was established by X-ray crystal structure determination. Keywords Zinc  N,N,O ligands  Pyruvic acid  Oxalic acid Introduction The 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad is a structural motif of increasing prominence among structurally characterized metalloenzymes. Next to the rapidly growing subgroup of non-heme iron enzymes [1, 2], several mononuclear zinc enzymes also feature this triad at their active site [3]. The proteases thermolysin, carboxypeptidase, and neutral pro- tease, for example, catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds. The zinc ion in these enzymes is coordinated by three endogenous residues, i.e., one glutamate and two histidine residues (Fig. 1). The fourth coordination site of the pseudo-tetrahedral zinc center is occupied by a catalytically important water or hydroxide ligand. This 2-His-1-carbox- ylate facial triad is a variation of the most commonly observed structural motif for the active sites of zinc- containing enzymes. Typically, the tetrahedral zinc centers in these enzymes are bound by a combination of histidine (N), glutamate or aspartate (O) and/or cysteine (S) residues. The resulting NxOySz donor set determines its biological function [3]. Accordingly, it is important to understand how a particular combination of donor groups modulates the reactivity of the Zn(II) metal center. The study of small synthetic analogues has focused on establishing a basis for such a structure–function relation- ship for these mononuclear zinc-containing enzymes [3, 5].

In order to obtain close structural models for the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad containing zinc enzymes, one would preferentially like to construct small analogues based on a tripodal N,N,O ligand framework that incorporates the biologically rele- vant donor groups. Of the complexes with a mixed N/O donor set reported to date [9–22], only a few make use of such tridentate, tripodal N,N,Ocarboxylato ligands. These tripodal ligands should be particularly well suited for the structural modeling of tetrahedral metal centers [23]. Dowling and Parkin [24] and Ghosh and Parkin [25] reported the ﬁrst example of an N,N,O model complex with a carboxylato donor group, which resulted from the inser- tion of carbon dioxide into a borohydride bond. More recently, the groups of Burzlaff [9, 12] and Carrano [11, 18, 19] have reported studies on the zinc coordination chemistry of the bispyrazolylacetate ligand family. Beck et al. [9], for instance, reported that a 2:1 ligand–zinc complex was obtained with bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-2- yl)acetate (bdmpza), a ligand closely related to 3,3-bis(1- methylimidazol-2-yl)propionate (MIm2Pr). These 2:1 complexes were obtained regardless of the ratio of reac- tants, i.e., even with stoichiometric amounts of ligand and zinc(II). Very recently, Friese et al. [22] constructed mononuclear zinc models via a new approach, i.e., by the use of sterically hindered carboxylato and N-donor ligand building blocks. We have been studying the copper and iron coordination chemistry of the new ligand family of the substituted 3,3- bis(1-alkylimidazol-2-yl)propionates as accurate structural mimics of the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad [26–28]. These ligands incorporate the biologically relevant donor groups, i.e., two imidazoles and a carboxylate group, into a monoanionic, tripodal framework. Their general biomi- metic potential has been illustrated by the structurally characterized copper [27, 28] and iron [26] complexes of these ligands. Here, our studies are expanded to the structural modeling of the zinc-containing enzymes and describe the zinc coordination chemistry of the ligands MIm2Pr and 3,3-bis(1-ethyl-4-isopropylimidazol-2-yl)pro- pionate (iPrEtIm2Pr) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the attempted synthesis of zinc complexes with 3,3-bis(1-methylimi- dazol-2-yl)acetate (MIm2Ac), a direct analogue of the bispyrazolylacetates, is described. During the course of these studies, we found that zinc complexes of ligand MIm2Pr catalyze the unexpected and unprecedented con- version of pyruvate to oxalate in aqueous solution. Materials and methods Air-sensitive organic reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of dry, oxygen-free N2 using standard Schlenk techniques. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diethyl ether were dried over sodium benzophenone ketyl and distilled under N2 prior to use. Methanol was dried over magnesium methoxide and distilled under N2 prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian AS400, a Varian Inova 300, or a Varian Mercury 200 spectrometer, operating at 25 C. IR spectra were recorded with a Perk- inElmer Spectrum One Fourier transform IR instrument. Elemental microanalyses were carried out by the Micro- analytisches Laboratorium Dornis & Kolbe, Mulheim a.d. Ruhr, Germany.

Results As part of our efforts to study the coordination chemistry of the substituted 3,3-bis(1-alkylimidazol-2-yl)propionate ligand family, the complexes of MIm2Pr and iPrEtIm2Pr with ZnCl2 were synthesized and structurally characterized (Fig. 2). MIm2Pr is the parent ligand of the family and iPrEtIm2Pr offers the most steric hindrance of the ligands studied so far. The coordination chemistry of MIm2Pr and iPrEtIm2Pr with zinc was found to be stoichiometry- dependent. Zinc complexes of MIm2Pr The formation of different species upon addition of either 0.5 or 1.0 equiv of ZnCl2 to a solution of the potassium salt of MIm2Pr in D2O is evidenced by the respective 1H NMR spectra in D2O (Fig. 3). All four resonances associated with ligand MIm2Pr (spectrum a) shifted upon addition of 0.5 equiv of ZnCl2 (spectrum b). The observation of two sharp signals of equal intensity for the imidazole protons shows that all four imidazole groups are equivalent. This is indicative of symmetric binding of both ligands to the zinc ion. The resonances of the methyl groups and the methine proton at the bridging carbon shift downﬁeld relative to the free ligand, whereas the propionate CH2 protons shift upﬁeld. Note that the methine proton resonance of the free ligand is hidden under the residual solvent signal in spectrum a. The lack of any other resonances suggests the clean formation of a neutral, 2:1 [Zn(MIm2Pr)2] complex. Upon addition of another 0.5 equiv of ZnCl2 several resonances shift and signal broadening is observed (spectrum c). Especially, one of the two imidazole signals is severely broadened. Again, no free ligand is observed in the spectrum. These obser- vations indicate a dynamic system with an overall 1:1 ligand–zinc stoichiometry. The isolation and puriﬁcation of the complex formed with 2 equiv of MIm2Pr with respect to ZnCl2 proved troublesome. The separation of the inorganic salts formed as a by-product in the synthesis by means of repetitive washing in all cases resulted in partial loss of coordinated ligand (as observed by NMR), regardless of the A[MIm2Pr] salt (A is K+, [Bu4N]+) originally employed. We therefore attempted the synthesis of this complex by the reaction of 2 equiv of the acid HMIm2Pr with Zn[N(SiMe3)2]2. Zinc bis(trimethylsilyl)amide can be synthesized in sizeable quantities [30] and was found to be a convenient reagent in this case. Indeed, the reaction of Zn[N(SiMe3)2]2 with 2 equiv of HMIm2Pr in acetonitrile resulted in the forma- tion of a white precipitate, which was recrystallized from an acetonitrile–water solution and was identiﬁed as the 2:1 complex [Zn(MIm2Pr)2]. Unfortunately, all attempts at obtaining single crystals of [Zn(MIm2Pr)2] failed. On the basis of ESI–MS, IR, and the previously described NMR analysis, we propose that [Zn(MIm2Pr)2] (Fig. 4) is isostructural to the crystallograph- ically characterized analogous complex [CuII(MIm2Pr)2] [27]. The position of the symmetric and asymmetric carbonyl stretching vibrations proved to be indicative of the binding mode of MIm2Pr (Bruijnincx et al., submitted) [27]. The mas(C=O) and ms(C=O) are found at 1,581 and 1,391 cm–1, respectively, indicative of a monodentate binding mode of the carboxylate [D(mas – ms) = 190 cm–1, identical to Dionic] [38]. Furthermore, the clean ESI–MS spectrum of [Zn(MIm2Pr)2] conﬁrmed the structure of a mononuclear, neutral 2:1 species with [M + X]+ (X is H, Na, K) as the prominent ions.

Asterisks denote the residual solvent peak 1186 J Biol Inorg Chem (2007) 12:1181–1196 123 The 1:1 complex [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl)] was synthesized by the reaction of equimolar amounts of ZnCl2 and K[MIm2Pr] in dry methanol. This led to the precipitation and isolation of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] in almost quantitative yield. The broad- ened signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl)] in D2O prompted us to study this complex by variable- temperature NMR (Fig. 5). As complex [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl)] is insoluble in organic solvents, the variable-temperature NMR studies were limited to aqueous solutions, which restricted the temperature range that could be studied. Spectra were recorded in the range from 2 to 70 C. Figure 5 shows that at elevated temperatures two sharp imidazole resonances are observed. In the spectrum rec- orded at 70 C, the (small) coupling between the two imidazole protons H1 and H2 can also be discerned. The imidazole signal at higher ﬁeld broadens upon cooling and ultimately splits into two separate (broad) resonances. This implies that at higher temperature the imidazole H1 protons (Fig. 3) become magnetically equivalent, whereas at lower temperature exchange slows down with the result that decoalesence into two broad resonances occurs. This behavior can be tentatively explained by the possibility of two different spatial orientations of the imidazole rings with respect to the carboxylate group of a second ligand upon coordination to zinc (vide infra), which would result in nonequivalent imidazole H1 protons at lower tempera- ture. At higher temperatures these orientations average on the NMR timescale and only one signal is observed. The asymmetric and symmetric carbonyl stretch vibra- tions of isolated [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] were observed at 1,615 and 1,390 cm–1 [D(mas – ms) = 225 cm–1], respectively. The asymmetric stretch thus shifted to higher wavenumbers compared with that observed for [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] and a different, but still monodentate coordination mode of the carboxylate must therefore be present in [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl]. The ESI–MS spectrum of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] showed the presence of several different species, with ions correspond- ing to, e.g., [MIm2Pr + Zn]+, [2(MIm2Pr) + Zn + H]+, [2(MIm2Pr) + 2Zn + Cl]+, [3(MIm2Pr) +2Zn + H]2+ and [3(MIm2Pr) + 2Zn]+. On the basis of the NMR, IR, and ESI– MS data, the structure of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] can be described as an oligomeric/polymeric species both in the solid state and in solution. This was conﬁrmed by the single-crystal struc- ture determination of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)]. Crystal structure of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)] Colorless single crystals of complex [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)] suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained from a solution of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] in H2O upon standing. The molecular structure of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)] is depicted in Fig. 6, with selected bond lengths and angles presented in Table 2. The single-crystal structure determination reveals that the structure of the metal complex is that of a coordination polymer. The zinc atom is coordinated by two 1-methy- limidazole groups of one MIm2Pr ligand, while the carboxylato group of this ligand coordinates to a neighbor- ing zinc atom. In this way an inﬁnite one-dimensional chain parallel to the crystallographic c-axis is formed. The chlorido anion and a coordinated water molecule complete the coordination sphere around each zinc center and render it ﬁve-coordinate. Thus, a new, bridging coordination mode of MIm2Pr is observed in the structure of [Zn (MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)] comprising N,N-bidentate coordination to one metal center and O-monodentate coorrdination to a second one. This coordination mode complements the alternative N,N,O-tridentate facial capping mode of the ligand, which is commonly observed for divalent transition metals [26, 27, 39].

Symmetry operation a 3/2 – x, 1 – y, z – 1/2 J Biol Inorg Chem (2007) 12:1181–1196 1187 123 ﬁve-coordinate Zn atom is distorted trigonal bipyrimidal (s = 0.72) [40]. The equatorial positions are occupied by N4 and the monoanionic carboxylato O1a and chlorido Cl1 ligands with O1a–Zn1–N4, Cl1–Zn1–O1a, and N4–Zn1– Cl1 angles of 109.55(5), 130.40(4), and 109.50(4), res- pectively (Rangles = 360). The axial positions are occupied by O3 of the water molecule and imidazole N2 [O3–Zn1–N2 173.58(5)]. The Zn1–N2 and Zn1–N4 bond lengths are different [2.1203(15) and 2.0517(14) A˚ ], consistent with their respective axial and equatorial positions. The Zn1–O1a distance of 1.9975(11) A˚ is slightly longer than the Zn– Ocarboxylato bond length observed in [Zn(bdatBu2,Me2)Cl]2 (1.942 A˚ ) [12] [bpatBu2,Me2 is (3,5-di-tert-butylpyrazol- 1-yl)(30,50-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)acetate], in which a carb- oxylato group is similarly coordinated to the metal center. The zinc-aquo distance of 2.1860(13) A˚ in [Zn(MIm2Pr) Cl(H2O)] is rather long compared with most reported Zn– OH2 distances (mean Zn–OH2 distance for ﬁve-coordinate zinc complexes is 2.046 A˚ ; Cambridge Structural Database version 5.27) [41]. In the related coordination polymer [Zn(bpatBu,Me)(H2O)](ClO4) [11] [bpatBu,Me is bis(5-tert- butyl-3-methylpyrazol-2-yl)acetate], where the water mol- ecule occupies a position in the basal plane of the trigonal bipyramid, the zinc–water distance, for example, amounts to 1.961 A˚ . [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)] crystallizes in the noncen- trosymmetric space group P212121 and the determination of the Flack parameter indicates that the crystal is enantio- merically pure. The one-dimensional linear chains in Zn(MIm2Pr) Cl(H2O)] are interconnected via hydrogen-bonding inter- actions into a two-dimensional network (Fig. 7, Table 3). The water molecule binds via its two hydrogen atoms by hydrogen bonding to a carbonyl O and a chlorido anion as hydrogen acceptors of a [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)] molecule in a neighboring strand. Zinc complexes of iPrEtIm2Pr In order to assess the inﬂuence of the presence of steric bulk in the ligand framework, we also studied the zinc coordination chemistry of ligand iPrEtIm2Pr. The ethyl and isopropyl substituents of this ligand provide signiﬁcant steric hindrance and, moreover, increase the solubility of its complexes in organic solvents. The 1:1 complex [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] was synthesized by the reaction of equimolar amounts of ZnCl2 and K[iPrEtIm2Pr] in meth- anol. The complex was isolated in almost quantitative yield. The IR spectrum of [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] showed the asymmetric and symmetric carbonyl stretch vibrations at 1,627 and 1,381 cm–1 [D(mas – ms) = 246 cm–1], respec- tively. The structure of [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] was determined by X-ray crystal structure determination. Crystal structure of [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] Colorless single crystals of [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained from a solution of [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] in methanol. The molecular structure of [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] is depicted in Fig. 8, with selected bond lengths and angles presented in Table 4. The crystal struc- ture shows that whereas like [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)] [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] also crystallizes as a coordination polymer, the molecular structure of [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] is noticeably different.

Instead of the ﬁve-coordinate structure in [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)], the zinc atom in [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] is four-coordinate. It has a pseudotet- rahedral coordination geometry with two imidazole groups of one iPrEtIm2Pr ligand, a chlorido, and a carboxylato group of a neighboring ligand coordinated to it. The bridging mode of iPrEtIm2Pr observed in [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr) Cl] is the same as found in [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)]. The deviation from ideal tetrahedral geometry is reﬂected in the observed bond angles [91.90(9)–119.66(6)]. The smallest angle (N2–Zn1–N4) is caused by the inherent geometrical restrictions imposed by the ligand and the largest angle (Cl1–Zn1–O1a) probably reﬂects the steric inﬂuence of the isopropyl groups. The Zn–N, Zn–O, and Zn–Cl bond lengths in [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] are shorter than the corre- sponding distances in [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)], which reﬂects the stronger Lewis acidity of zinc(II) in a four-coordinate versus a ﬁve-coordinate geometry. The Zn1–O1a bond length of 1.9628(19) A˚ is comparable to values reported for other tetrahedral N,N,O zinc complexes with a monodentate carboxylate [9, 11, 12, 18]. The different coordination geometry at zinc results in a more folded zigzag polymer chain in [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl], compared with the more stretched zigzag chain observed for [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)]. The structure of [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] and more generally the coordination chemistry of iPrEtIm2Pr with Zn in methanol solution were studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy and ESI–MS. The 1H NMR spectra of a titration experi- ment comprising the addition of ZnCl2 to the potassium salt of iPrEtIm2Pr in methanol solution are shown in Fig. 9. Comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of K[iPrEtIm2Pr] (Fig. 9, spectrum a) with that of an equimolar K[iPrE- tIm2Pr]–ZnCl2 mixture shows signiﬁcant shifts pointing to the formation of a [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] complex (spectrum b). In the 1H NMR spectrum of [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] one sharp resonance is observed for the imidazole protons at 6.99 ppm, which is shifted to lower ﬁeld compared with that of the free ligand. The two imidazole rings are equivalent on the NMR timescale, suggesting that they are symmetrically bound to zinc. Importantly, the CH2 reso- nance of the ethyl groups is shifted and split into two signals of equal intensity (4.20 and 4.32 ppm). Similarly, the methyl groups of the isopropyl substituent now appear as two doublets of equal intensity. These splittings conﬁrm that the CH2(Et) and CH3(iPr) groupings contain diaste- reotopic protons and methyl groups, respectively. No splitting or change in multiplicity of the resonances asso- ciated with the propionate backbone is observed, which is indicative of mirror symmetry of the complex in solution. Although at ﬁrst sight the NMR data would allow an assignment of the solution structure for [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] as a mononuclear zinc complex with a facially capped ligand, a bridged oligomeric species (similar as the one discussed before for [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl]) is preferred. ESI–MS data support the latter description since trimeric, dimeric, and monomeric species are observed. Prominent ions corresponding to [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl + H]+, [Zn2 (iPrEtIm2Pr)2Cl2 + H]+, and [Zn3(iPrEtIm2Pr)3Cl3 + H]+ are, for instance, observed. The structure of [Zn(iPrE- tIm2Pr)Cl] in solution can therefore best be described as a coordination polymer similar to [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl]. Upon addition of 2 equiv of K[iPrEtIm2Pr] to ZnCl2 in CD3OD (Fig. 9, spectrum c), a second species is formed next to the 1:1 complex [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl]. The fact that two species are observed, indicates that an equilibrium is obtained, i.e., the clean formation of a symmetrical 2:1 iPrEtIm2Pr to zinc complex, as previously observed for MIm2Pr, does not occur. Further inspection of the 1H NMR spectrum indicated that all resonances of the 1-ethyl-4- isopropylimidazole groups of the new species are split into two signals of equal intensity, e.g., the imidazole ring protons at 7.37 and 7.19 ppm. This suggests that the two Table 3 Selected hydrogen bond lengths (angstroms) and angles (degrees) for [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)] Donor–Hacceptor D–H HA DA D–HA O3–H1OO2i 0.78 (3) 1.95 (3) 2.7307 (19) 176 (3) O3–H2OCl1ii 0.84 (3) 2.31 (3) 3.1472 (15) 171 (3) Symmetry operations i 1 – x, 1/2 + y, 1/2 – z; ii –1/2 + x, 3/2 – y, –z Fig. 8 Molecular structure of [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] in the crystal, showing three molecules of the carboxylato-bridged coordination polymer.

For instance, the two resonances of the CH protons of the two isopropyl groups are found at 2.96 and 1.03 ppm. Furthermore, the methine proton at the bridging carbon is still a single triplet, whereas the CH2 group of the propionate backbone has become diastereotopic. Variable-temperature NMR studies over a temperature range from –40 to 60 C did not show signiﬁcant spectral changes. The ESI–MS spectrum of a 2:1 K[iPrEtIm2Pr]–ZnCl2 solution showed prominent ions corresponding to the [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)2 + H]+ and [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)2 + 2H]2+ cations. On the basis of these data, the structure of the new species is proposed to be a 2:1 ligand-to-zinc complex [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)2] in which each ligand is coordinated via its carboxylate group and one imidazole group, resulting in a four-coordinated zinc(II) ion (Fig. 10). The coordination of two of the three donor atoms in a 2:1 ligand-to-metal complex has also been observed with bulky N,N,S(thiolate) ligands in the complexes [Zn(L2S)2] [L2SH is (3-tert- butyl-5-methyl-2-thiophenyl)bis(3,5-dimethyl pyrazolyl) methane] and [Zn(L2)2] [L2 is 1-methoxy-2-methyl-1,1-bis (1-methyl-4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propane-2-thiol] [42, 43]. The addition of a third equivalent of K[iPrE- tIm2Pr] (spectrum d) results in the disappearance of the signals associated with [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] and both free ligand K[iPrEtIm2Pr] and [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)2] are detected. No attempts to isolate [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)2] were undertaken. Attempted synthesis of a zinc bis(1-methylimidazol-2-yl) acetate complex Recently, the zinc coordination chemistry of bis(pyrazolyl) acetates (bpa) has been actively explored to mimic the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad found in several different zinc enzymes [9, 11, 12, 18, 19]. The backbone of bpa is more rigid than the backbone of the ligands MIm2Pr and iPrEtIm2Pr used in the present study. In particular, the bridging N,N-bidentate-O-monodentate coordination mode reported here is less favorable for bpa, for which a strong predisposition to an N,N,O facial capping mode is expec- ted. The synthesis of zinc complexes of MIm2Ac would therefore be desirable, since it would allow a direct com- parison of the respective pyrazole and imidazole donor groups (Fig. 11). We attempted the synthesis of ligand MIm2Ac, but found that the common synthetic procedure, i.e., lithiation of MIm2CH2 followed by reaction with carbon dioxide [45], did not result in product formation in acceptable yields.

[39]. The benzyl ester of bis(1- methylimidazol-2-yl)acetic acid (BnMIm2Ac), however, was sufﬁciently stable and could be isolated and puriﬁed after reaction of lithio bis(1-methylimidazol-2-yl)methane with benzylchloroformate. Since hydrolysis and hydrogen- olysis of the ester moiety resulted in decomposition of the ligand, the 1:1 zinc dichloride complex with BnMIm2Ac was synthesized in the hope that autocatalytic ester hydro- lysis by the zinc complex would yield the desired zinc bis (1-methylimidazol-2-yl)acetate complex. A similar app- roach, involving the autocatalytic saponiﬁcation of a zinc bis(picolyl)glycine ethyl ester complex, has been reported by Abufarag and Vahrenkamp [46]. The reaction of equimolar amounts of ZnCl2 and BnMIm2Ac gave the complex [ZnCl2(BnMIm2Ac)] as a white powder in quantitative yield. The structure of [ZnCl2(BnMIm2Ac)] was determined by X-ray diffraction studies and showed the BnMIm2Ac ligand bound to the zinc center in an N,N-bidentate way (Fig. 12, top). How- ever, stirring of [ZnCl2(BnMIm2Ac)] in H2O at room temperature in an attempt to obtain [Zn(MIm2Ac)Cl] resulted in decomposition of the ligand and formation of [ZnCl2(MIm2CH2)], which was isolated as one of the decomposition products. [ZnCl2(MIm2CH2)] was also characterized crystallographically (Fig. 12, bottom). On the basis of these ﬁndings, it was concluded that the MIm2Ac monoanion is too unstable for practical studies and the pursuit of this ligand was abandoned. Reaction of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] with sodium pyruvate: oxalate formation In an attempt to prevent the formation of coordination poly- mers of MIm2Pr and to obtain mononuclear complexes with the desired N,N,O facial capping mode of the ligand, several different monoanionic, bidendate coligands were used. In the course of this study, we also investigated the reaction of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] with sodium pyruvate. The addition of 1 equiv of sodium pyruvate to a solution of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] in D2O resulted in the appearance of a new singlet at 2.38 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 13, top spectrum). The signal is not shifted with respect to the signal observed for free sodium pyruvate, which indicates that the interaction between [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] and the pyruvate anion is weak, at best. The ESI–MS spectrum of an aqueous solution of equi- molar amounts of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] and sodium pyruvate, however, did show some major ions corresponding to a mononuclear {[Zn(MIm2Pr)(pyruvate)] + Na}+ and a dinu- clear {[Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(pyruvate)]}+ cation, in addition to the ions observed in the ESI–MS spectrum of a solution of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] in water. However, when the mixture of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] and pyruvate in D2O was followed in time by NMR spectros- copy, the gradual decrease in intensity of the signal of the pyruvate methyl group was noticed until it ultimately dis- appeared (Fig. 13, bottom spectrum). After several days colorless crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were formed in the NMR tube. To our surprise, the X-ray crystal structure showed the structure of the zinc complex [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)]6H2O. [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)]6H2O has the structure of a coordination polymer involving [Zn(MIm2Pr)]+ cations bridged by oxalato dianions. Fig. 10 Proposed structure for [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)2]. The structure was calculated by molecular mechanics geometry optimization (Spartan SGI [44] MMFF94) Fig. 11 Ligands benzyl bis (1-methylimidazol-2-yl)acetate (BnMIm2Ac), MIm2Ac, and bis(pyrazolyl)acetate (bpa) and the synthesis of complexes [ZnCl2(BnMIm2Ac)] and [ZnCl2(MIm2CH2)] J Biol Inorg Chem (2007) 12:1181–1196 1191 123 To unequivocally prove the relevance of the structure obtained, zinc coordination polymer [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)] was also synthesized independently. Indeed, the addition of 0.5 equiv of K2C2O4H2O to an aqueous solution of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] yielded a white, insoluble powder. This powder was identiﬁed as [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)] by elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy. Typical features of the IR spectrum of [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)] include absorptions at 1,674, 1,638, 1,591, and 1,399 cm–1, which can be attributed to the oxalato and carboxylato groups in the polymer. Crystallization of [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)] proved difﬁcult given its general insolubility. Single crystals could, however, be obtained via the gel crystallization method [47]. A gel formed from a solution of tetrameth- oxysilane and potassium oxalate hydrate in water was layered with an aqueous solution of K[MIm2Pr] and ZnCl2. Single crystals were obtained after several days and could be unequivocally identiﬁed as [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)] by X-ray crystal structure determination. Crystal structure of [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)]6H2O The molecular structure of [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)]6H2O is shown in Fig. 14, with selected bond lengths and angles presented in Table 5.1 The polymeric structure of [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)]6H2O comprises two crystallographi- cally inequivalent zinc atoms. Both zinc centers are ﬁve- coordinate and differ only in the slightly different bond lengths and angles. Each zinc atom is coordinated in an N,N-bidentate fashion by the 1-methylimidazole groups of one MIm2Pr ligand, two oxygen atoms of a bis O,O-bid- entate bridging oxalato group, and a carboxylato O donor atom of a neighboring MIm2Pr ligand. The combination of the bridging oxalato and MIm2Pr ligands constructs a polymeric structure leading to the formation of two- dimensional sheets. The coordination geometry around each zinc center is best described as a severely distorted trigonal bipyramid, with s values of 0.60 and 0.59 for Zn1 and Zn2, respec- tively [40]. The equatorial positions are occupied by N24b/ N14, and the anionic carboxylato O11/O21 and oxalato O32/O42 ligands for Zn1/Zn2, respectively. The axial positions are occupied by O31/O41 of the oxalato group and imidazole N22b/N12 for Zn1/Zn2 [O–Zn–N angles of 161.43(9)/160.51(8)]. The planar oxalato moieties are rather asymmetrically bound to the metal centers, with the Zn1–O31 and Zn1–O32 distances amounting to 2.258(2) and 2.018(2) A˚ , for instance. This asymmetry has also been observed in other bisbidentate bridged zinc–oxalato com- plexes with ﬁve-coordinated metal centers and is consistent with the occupation of one equatorial and one axial site of the trigonal bipyramid [10, 48]. The shortest ZnZn dis- tances via the bridging oxalato group are 5.5667(7) A˚ for Zn1Zn1d and 5.5332(7) A˚ for Zn2Zn2c. The distances of the metal centers to the donor atoms of MIm2Pr follow the same trend as observed in [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)].

The oxalato groups are, for instance, involved in two chelated, three-centered hydrogen bonds with two water molecules via four O–HO hydrogen bonds. Discussion The aim of this investigation was to explore the biomimetic modeling potential of the MIm2Pr ligand family with respect to mononuclear zinc enzymes featuring the 2-His- 1-carboxylate facial triad. Complex [Zn(MImPr)2] shows that the facial capping mode of MIm2Pr, as earlier observed with copper [27, 28] and iron (Bruijnincx et al., submitted) [26], is also accessible for zinc. The crystal structure of the 1:1 complex [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)], however, shows that MIm2Pr can also adopt other coordination modes. The formation of the oligomeric/polymeric structure of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl], both in solution and in the solid state, can be attributed to the ﬂexibility of the ligand due to the CH2 spacer of the propionate backbone. The formation of polymeric [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)] is further aided by the insolubility of the resulting coordination polymer. Two strategies were explored to circumvent polymer formation, i.e., increasing the steric bulk of the ligand and elimination of the CH2 spacer. The latter approach demanded the synthesis of the bis(1-methylimidazol-2-yl)acetate ana- logue of MIm2Pr, which was found to be rather unstable and its zinc complexes could not be obtained. The effect of more steric bulk was studied with iPrEtIm2Pr, which con- tains the sterically more demanding isopropyl and ethyl substituents. Zinc complexes of iPrEtIm2Pr are polymeric in nature as well, albeit with a different coordination geometry at the zinc atom as observed in [Zn(MIm2Pr) Cl(H2O)]. The ﬁrst coordination spheres of [Zn(MIm2Pr) Cl(H2O)] and [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] are compared in Fig. 16. Fig. 14 Molecular structure of [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)]6H2O in the crystal.

The coordination around zinc in [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] resembles the ﬁrst coordination sphere of the active sites of the zinc enzymes thermolysin, car- boxypeptidase A, and neutral protease. The polymeric rather than monomeric nature of the complex, however, clearly limits its potential as a biological mimic. The isolation of [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)] from the reaction of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] with sodium pyruvate was rather unexpected and is, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst report of the nonoxidative formation of oxalate from pyruvate (Scheme 1).2 Interestingly, Takeste and Vah- renkamp [51] very recently reported a trispyrazolylborato– zinc complex with pyruvate, representing the ﬁrst struc- turally characterized zinc complex of an a-keto acid. Although in their case the zinc–pyruvate complex obtained was stable, unexpected cleavage reactions with other a-keto acids, such as benzoylformic acid, and a-diketones were observed. A control experiment showed that an aqueous sodium pyruvate solution is stable under the reaction conditions. Apparently, [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] mediates the conversion of pyruvate to oxalate. The product [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)] invariably deposited as crystals in experiments done on the NMR scale. On a preparative scale (0.3 mmol), the reaction also takes place, yet the product was isolated as an insoluble white powder. The IR spectrum of this powder was identi- cal to that obtained for independently synthesized [Zn2 (MIm2Pr)2(ox)]. Most importantly, further experiments revealed that the reaction is catalytic in zinc. For example, addition of 20 equiv of sodium pyruvate to a solution of [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] in water under ambient conditions resulted in ten turnovers after 24 h. The disappearance of the pyru- vate methyl signal was also observed in a solution containing ZnCl2 and sodium pyruvate without any further additives. Concomitantly, a precipitate was observed in the NMR tube. However, the composition of this precipitate, i.e., the for- mation of oxalate, could not be unambiguously established. Fig. 15 Hydrogen bonding network and crystal packing of [Zn2(MIm2Pr)2(ox)]6H2O Fig. 16 Comparison of the ﬁrst coordination spheres of the zinc atoms in the coordination polymers [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl(H2O)] (top) and [Zn(iPrEtIm2Pr)Cl] (bottom) Scheme 1 The observed transformation of pyruvate to oxalate mediated by [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] 2 Unexpected oxalate formation by Zn complexes is not completely unprecedented. The reaction of Zn(NO3)2 with pyridine-2,4,6-tricar- boxylic acid in the presence of pyridine at room temperature resulted, for instance, in the formation of the zinc oxalato polymer [Zn(ox)(py)2]H2O [49]. Another oxalato bridged zinc coordination polymer was obtained from the hydro(solvo)thermal reaction between Zn(NO3)2 and pyridine in ethanol or methanol [50]. It was proposed that the oxalate resulted from ethanol oxidation and oxidative coupling of methanol for the two different solvents, respectively. Clearly, different reaction mechanisms are operative in these cases. 1194 J Biol Inorg Chem (2007) 12:1181–1196 123 Since it is known that pyruvate keto–enol tautomeriza- tion is catalyzed by divalent metal ions such as Zn(II) [52, 53], the disappearance of the methyl signal could in prin- ciple also be attributed to consecutive H/D-exchange steps. This would yield the deuterated pyruvate-d3 anion, which is also invisible in 1H NMR spectroscopy. To be able to exclude this possibility, experiments were performed in H2O and samples were diluted with 2 equiv of D2O just before the measurement. The same observations were made as previously, i.e., gradual disappearance of the methyl signal and slow crystallization of the product in the NMR tube. The presence of appreciable amounts of enolate should also lead to the detection of the dimerization product of pyruvate [52, 53]. This pyruvate dimer, which results from an aldol condensation reaction and has characteristic signals at 1.38 (singlet) and 3.35 (AB pat- tern) ppm [52–54], was not observed under these conditions. Phenyl pyruvic acid (and other a-ketoacids) is oxidized by molecular oxygen to give benzaldehyde and oxalate or the carbon oxides (CO and/or CO2) [55, 56]. This reaction is catalyzed by several metal ions, such as Mn(II), Fe(II), and Cu(II), but not by Zn(II) [57, 58], and has been attributed to the presence of the enol tautomer, which is capable of reacting with dioxygen [61]. In the absence of dioxygen, i.e., under an Ar atmosphere, pyruvate does react with [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl] to form oxalate. The anaerobic reactivity cannot be attributed to any residual dioxygen traces, since phenyl pyruvate (a substrate more prone to the reaction with dioxygen) did not show any reactivity under these conditions. The observed conversion of pyruvate to oxalate under anaerobic conditions clearly places it outside previously observed formation of oxalate from oxidative transforma- tions of a-keto acids [55, 56, 59–63]. The observation is important, since pyruvate is a major metabolic junction and it is therefore of prime importance to understand its reac- tivity. At present no biological counterpart has been reported for the pyruvate–oxalate conversion catalyzed by [Zn(MIm2Pr)Cl]. The chemical transformation as reported here, however, takes place at room temperature and phys- iological pH and should therefore be considered as a possible alternative pathway in the reactivity of pyruvate. The mechanism of this conversion is currently not clear. No other products could be detected by NMR during the reaction, which precludes the formulation of a mass bal- ance for the reaction and clearly hampers a mechanistic interpretation. In any case, the pyruvate to oxalate con- version requires the scission of a C–C bond. On the other hand, the reactivity of zinc enzymes and their model complexes is often of hydrolytic nature. This can be attributed to the generation of a nucleophilic hydroxide species and/or the activation of a coordinated substrate towards attack of such a nucleophile [3]. The formation of oxalate from pyruvate via a hydrolytic mechanism is, however, difﬁcult to envision. Further investigations have to be performed to address the mechanistic questions concerning this transformation. Conclusions The difference in applied steric bulk by the ligands MIm2Pr and iPrEtIm2Pr is reﬂected in the coordination chemistry of the two ligands towards ZnCl2. Octahedral (MIm2Pr) ver- sus tetrahedral (iPrEtIm2Pr) and trigonal pyramidal (MIm2Pr) versus tetrahedral (iPrEtIm2Pr) coordination geometries were obtained in the 1:1 and 2:1 ligand-to- metal complexes, respectively. The bridging binding mode of the two crystallographically characterized coordination polymers illustrates the intrinsic ﬂexibility of the 3,3- bis(imidazol-2-yl)propionate ligand framework. The poly- meric nature of the complexes could limit their biological relevance with respect to the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad in the case of zinc. On the other hand, attempts aimed at obtaining structurally more faithful mononuclear com- plexes led to the observation of the unprecedented Zn-mediated pyruvate to oxalate conversion. This new, nonoxidative transformation of an important metabolic junction is intriguing and warrants further investigation. References 1.
