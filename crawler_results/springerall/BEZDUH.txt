Manuscript Multiple-layer heterometallic MnII–AgI coordination polymers constructed from [Ag2 I(CN)3]2 and [AgI(CN)2]2 units Nanthawat Wannarit • Viwat Hahnvajanawong • Chaveng Pakawatchai • Sujittra Youngme Received: 1 October 2011 / Accepted: 27 October 2011 / Published online: 15 November 2011  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011 Abstract Two multiple-layer heterometallic MnII–AgI coordination polymers, {MnII(ampyz)(H2O)[Ag2 I(CN)3]- [AgI(CN)2]ampyz}n (1) and {[MnII(benzim)2[AgI(CN)2]2]- [(benzim)AgI(CN)]H2O}n (2) where ampyz = 2-amino- pyrazine and benzim = benzimidazole, have been prepared and structurally characterized. Compound 1 reveals a mul- tiple-layer two-dimensional network with strong hexanu- clear argentophilic interactions leading to an inﬁnite three- dimensional framework. Compound 2 has an unprecedented double-layer two-dimensional squared grid-type network with (4,4) topology through AgIAgI and p–p interactions between two adjacent squared layers. These double-layer networks of 2 are linked to others by p–p interactions, leading to a three-dimensional framework. Introduction The search for new coordination polymers is a challenge for coordination chemists, especially in areas of current interest such as supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering and molecular magnetism. Such compounds have interesting functional properties such as molecular adsorption, luminescence and catalysis [1–9]. The rational design and synthesis of new coordination polymers have been carried out by using judicious choices of transition metals and ligands to control the supramolecular topology and dimensionality. In addition, intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, p–p stacking and van der Waals interactions can also greatly inﬂuence the resulting crystal structure and its dimensionality [10, 11]. In recent years, much effort has been devoted to developing new manga- nese(II) coordination polymers by the incorporation of dicyanoargentate(I) building blocks with mono-, di- or tetradentate co-ligands, which can show various types of dimensionality, structural architectures and magnetic properties [12–16]. The dicyanoargentate(I), [AgI(CN)2]- bridging ligand has frequently been employed to construct unique multidimensional (1D, 2D and 3D) coordination network architectures and to extend the stabilized coordi- nation framework via silversilver attractions (argento- philic interactions) [17, 18]. Interestingly, the self-assembly of this bridging ligand may be lead to the formation of the [Ag2 I(CN)3]- unit which has been shown to exhibit a remarkable diversity of coordination networks [19–21]. With the aim to extend these systems, our research group has attempted to design and synthesize new Mn(II) coordination polymers using dicyanoargentate(I) bridging ligands to increase the dimensionality and enhance the stability of whole frameworks via silversilver interac- tions, while co-ligands such as 2-aminopyrazine (ampyz) and benzimidazole (benzim) are included to facilitate the intermolecular interactions, namely H-bonding and p-p stacking, respectively, stabilizing the overall coordination framework. In this work, two new multiple-layer two- dimensional heterometallic MnII–AgI coordination poly- mers were successfully synthesized and structurally char- acterized. Herein, we report the synthesis, spectroscopic Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11243-011-9560-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Although no problems were encountered in this work, perchlorate salts are potentially explosive and should be handled in small quantities. X-ray crystallography X-ray single-crystal data for both compounds were col- lected at 293 K. Reﬂection data were collected on a 1 K Bruker SMART APEX CCD area-detector diffractometer using rotating mode, graphite-monochromated Mo Ka radiation, (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at a detector distance of 4.5 cm and swing angle of -30. Raw data frame integration was performed with SAINT [22], which also applied correction for Lorentz and Polarization effects. An empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS [23] program, which resulted in transmission coefﬁcients rang- ing from 1.000 to 0.697 and 1.000 to 0.707 for 1 and 2, respectively. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares methods on (Fobs)2 using the SHELXTL-PC Version 6.12 software package [24]. For compound 1, all hydrogen atoms were introduced in calculated positions and reﬁned with ﬁxed geometry with respect to their carrier carbon atoms except those of the amine group on coordinated ampyz, H(5), H(6) and water molecule, H(7) and H(8), while hydrogen atoms of the ampyz lattice molecule could not be located. All non- hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. An ampyz lattice molecule lies on the inversion center, and the amine group of this molecule was disordered with site occupan- cies of 0.5. In compound 2, all hydrogen atoms were introduced in calculated positions and reﬁned with ﬁxed geometry with respect to their carrier nitrogen and carbon atoms except those of the water lattice molecule. All non- hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. For the water lattice molecule, the oxygen atoms were disordered with site occupancies of 0.5. Results and discussion Description of crystal structures {[MnII(ampyz)(H2O)[Ag2 I(CN)3][AgI(CN)2]]ampyz}n (1) The asymmetric unit of compound 1 consists of two independent MnII centers located on an inversion center with the position occupancy of 0.5, two crystallographi- cally independent units, [Ag2 I(CN)3]- and [AgI(CN)2]- and a lattice ampyz molecule (Fig. 1a). The crystallographic data and selected bond distances and angles of compound 1 are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The coordination sites of the two MnII centers, Mn(1) and Mn(2) are similar with four N atoms coordinated in an equatorial position, two N atoms of [AgI(CN)2]- units (Mn–N, 2.230(2) and 2.232(2) A˚ ) and two N atoms of [Ag2 I(CN)3]- units (Mn–N, 2.204(2) and 2.241(2) A˚ ). The axial positions are occupied by two N atoms of ampyz ligands (Mn–N = 2.324(1) A˚ ) for Mn(1) and two O atoms of water ligands (Mn–O = 2.163(1) A˚ ) for Mn(2) to give MnN6 and MnN4O2 distorted octahedral chromophores for Mn(1) and Mn(2), respectively. 80 Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:79–84 123 Along the crystallographic b axis, the Mn(1) and Mn(2) atoms are connected by [AgI(CN)2]- units in an alternation of Mn(1) and Mn(2) sites to give an inﬁnite 1D chain-like Table 1 Crystallographic and reﬁnement data for compounds 1 and 2 Compound 1 2 Empirical formula C22H16Ag6Mn2N19O2 C26H18Ag3MnN11O Formula weight 1335.64 879.06 T/K 293(2) 293(2) Crystal system Triclinic Orthorhombic Space group P-1 Pbca a (A˚ ) 7.5739(3) 13.6499(7) b (A˚ ) 8.5028(4) 16.6200(8) c (A˚ ) 15.4945(7) 26.3379(13) a () 99.5680(10) 90.00 b () 103.0090(10) 90.00 c () 90.6710(10) 90.00 V (A˚ 3) 957.45(7) 5975.1(5) Z 1 8 Dcalc (g cm-3) 2.303 1.954 l (mm-1) 3.684 2.391 F(000) 629 3400 Crystal size (mm) 0.36 9 0.22 9 0.15 0.31 9 0.20 9 0.13 Number of reﬂection collected 13,070 58,327 Number of unique reﬂections (Rint) 4,604(0.0250) 5,889(0.0340) Data/restraints/ parameter 4604/0/242 5889/0/389 Goodness-of-ﬁt 1.062 1.048 Final R indices [I [ 2r(I)] R1 = 0.0224 R1 = 0.0198 wR2 = 0.0543 wR2 = 0.0495 R indices (all data) R1 = 0.0247 R1 = 0.0237 wR2 = 0.0555 wR2 = 0.0514 Largest difference in peak and hole (e3) 0.638 and -0.997 0.394 and -0.388 R = R||Fo| – |Fc||/R|Fo|, Rw = [Rw{||Fo| – |Fc||}2/Rw|Fo|2]1/2 Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles (deg) with e.s.d.s. in parentheses for {[MnII(ampyz)(H2O)[Ag2 I(CN)3][AgI(CN)2]]amp- yz}n (1) Bond lengths Mn(1)–N(1) 2.324(1) Mn(2)–O(1) 2.163(1) Mn(1)–N(1)c 2.324(1) Mn(2)–O(1)e 2.163(1) Mn(1)–N(4) 2.230(2) Mn(2)–N(5) 2.232(2) Mn(1)–N(4)c 2.230(2) Mn(2)–N(5)e 2.232(2) Mn(1)–N(6)a 2.204(2) Mn(2)–N(8) 2.241(2) Mn(1)–N(6)d 2.204(2) Mn(2)–N(8)e 2.241(2) Ag(1)Ag(2) 3.0320(3) Ag(1)Ag(3) 3.0530(3) Ag(2)Ag(2)f 3.3420(5) Bond angles N(1)–Mn(1)–N(4) 89.20(8) O(1)–Mn(2)–N(5)e 91.06(8) N(1)–Mn(1)–N(4)c 90.80(8) O(1)–Mn(2)–N(8)b 91.52(8) N(1)–Mn(1)–N(6)a 89.51(7) O(1)–Mn(2)–N(8)g 88.48(8) N(1)–Mn(1)–N(6)d 90.49(7) O(1)–Mn(2)–O(1)e 180.00(3) N(1)–Mn(1)–N(1)c 180.00(13) N(5)–Mn(2)–N(5)e 180.000(1) N(4)–Mn(1)–N(1)c 90.80(8) N(5)–Mn(2)–N(8)b 89.63(8) N(4)–Mn(1)–N(6)a 88.64(9) N(5)–Mn(2)–N(8)g 90.37(8) N(4)–Mn(1)–N(6)d 91.36(9) N(5)–Mn(2)–O(1)e 91.06(8) N(4)–Mn(1)–N(4)c 180.00(15) N(8)c–Mn(2)– O(1)e 88.48(8) N(1)e–Mn(1)– N(4)c 89.20(8) N(8)–Mn(2)–N(5)e 90.37(8) N(1)e–Mn(1)– N(6)d 89.51(7) N(8)–Mn(2)–N(8)e 180.00(9) N(4)e–Mn(1)– N(6)d 88.64(9) O(1)g–Mn(2)– N(5)e 88.94(8) N(6)b–Mn(1)– N(1)c 90.49(7) O(1)g–Mn(2)– N(8)g 91.52(8) O(1)–Mn(2)–N(5) 88.94(8) N(5)g–Mn(2)– N(8)g 89.63(8) Ag(2)–Ag(1)– Ag(3) 165.148(10) Symmetry code: a = x, -1 ? y, z; b = x, 1 ? y, z; c = -x, -y, -z; d = -x, 1 - y, -z; e = 1 - x, 2 - y, 1 - z; f = 1 - x, 1 - y, 1 - z and g = 1 - x, 1 - y, 1 - z Fig. 1 a Asymmetric unit and atomic numbering scheme (thermal ellipsoids are shown at 50% level) and b two- dimensional network for compound 1 (symmetry code i = 1 - x, 1 - y, -z), hydrogen atoms and a lattice ampyz molecule are omitted for clarity Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:79–84 81 123 structure with the Mn(1)Mn(2) distance of 10.5260(4) A˚ . These chains are further linked by [Ag2 I(CN)3]- units along the crystallographic a axis in the same manner of alter- nating Mn(1) and Mn(2) sites, leading to a 2D network (Fig. 1b) with the Mn(1)Mn(2) distance of 15.6819(4) A˚ . Furthermore, the extended 2D networks include rather strong AgIAgI (argentophilic) interactions between the [Ag(1)(CN)2]- and [(NC)Ag(2)(CN)Ag(3)(CN)2]- groups of adjacent 2D layers along the crystallographic a axis. These interactions could be deﬁned as the hexanuclear moieties (Fig. 2a), [Ag(3)Ag(1)Ag(2)Ag(2)iAg(1)i Ag(3)i, symmetry code i = 1-x, 1-y,-z] with AgIAgI distances of 3.0530(3), 3.0320(3) and 3.3420(5) A˚ for Ag(1)Ag(3), Ag(1)Ag(2) and Ag(2)Ag(2)i, respec- tively. These AgIAgI distances are signiﬁcantly lower than 3.60 A˚ , the sum of the van der Waals radii of two AgI centers [17, 18]. Both the [AgI(CN)2] and the [Ag2 I(CN)3] moieties are not perfectly linear (C(6)–Ag(1)–C(5) of 171.6(1), C(7)–Ag(2)–C(8) of 169.1(1) and C(9)–Ag(3)– N(7) of 177.8(1)), which could be due to the presence of argentophilic interactions. These interactions generate an inﬁnite 3D structure of multilayer 2D networks, as illus- trated in Fig. 2b and S1. The inﬁnite 3D network of compound 1 is also stabilized by hydrogen bonding between coordinated water molecules and lattice ampyz molecule along the a axis (Figure S2). Although containing the same [Ag2 I(CN)3]- and [AgI(CN)2]- units, the novel coordination network of the heterometallic MnII–AgI compound 1 is distinct from those of related coordination polymers, such as {FeII(3,5-Me2py)2- [Ag2 I(CN)3][AgI(CN)2]}n (I) [5], {CdII(pyz)2[Ag2 I(CN)3]- [AgI(CN)2]}n (II) [20] and {FeII(pmd)2[Ag2 I(CN)3]- [AgI(CN)2]}n (III) [21] (3,5-Me2py = 3,5-dimethylpyri- dine, pyz = pyrazine, and pmd = pyrimidine). These rela- ted compounds show interpenetrated 3D structures in which the distorted octahedral MII sites are also coordinated by [Ag2 I(CN)3]- and [AgI(CN)2]- units in equatorial positions, but the axial positions are occupied by monodentate 3,5- Me2py and bidentate bridging pyz and pmd ligands for I, II and III, respectively, whereas compound 1 shows a 3D structure of multiple-layer 2D networks involving strong hexanuclear argentophilic interactions with the axial posi- tions coordinated by monodentate ampyz and aqua ligands. {[MnII(benzim)2[AgI(CN)2]2][(benzim)AgI(CN)]H2O}n (2) The asymmetric unit of compound 2 consists of a MnII atom, two independent [AgI(CN)2]- units, a [(ben- zim)AgI(CN)] unit and a lattice water molecule (Fig. 3a). The crystallographic data and selected bond distances and angles for compound 2 are shown in Tables 1 and 3. Fig. 3 a Asymmetric unit and atomic numbering scheme (thermal ellipsoids are shown at 50% level) and b two- dimensional squared layers with (4,4) topology for compound 2. Hydrogen atoms and water lattice molecule are omitted for clarity Fig. 2 a Hexanuclear AgI unit (symmetry code i = 1 - x, 1 - y, -z), b side view of multiple-layer 3D network via hexanuclear AgIAgI interactions Hydrogen atoms, coordinated ampyz, water and lattice ampyz molecules are omitted for clarity 82 Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:79–84 123 The MnII center has a MnN6 chromophore in a distorted octrahedral geometry in which the equatorial positions are occupied by the N atoms of two [AgI(CN)2]- units (Mn–N, 2.241(1) and 2.276(1) A˚ ) and two benzim ligands (Mn– N = 2.240(1)–2.273(1) A˚ ), while the axial positions are occupied by the N atoms of another two [AgI(CN)2]- units (Mn–N, 2.256(1) and 2.312(1) A˚ ). The Mn(II) atoms are connected by [Ag(1)(CN)2]- units along the crystallographic a axis, to give an inﬁnite 1D chain-like structure with the Mn(1)Mn(2) distance of 10.7365 (5) A˚ . These Mn(II) atoms are further coordinated by [Ag(2)(CN)2]- units along the crystallographic b axis with the Mn(1)Mn(2) distance of 10.7704(5) A˚ , to give (4,4) topology of the 2D layer (Fig. 3b). Surprisingly, the structure of compound 2 also contains unexpected [(ben- zim)AgI(CN)] units that are attached to the 2D layer net- work via AgIAgI interactions with Ag(1)Ag(3) distance of 3.1225(3) A˚ . Interestingly, adjacent layers are linked together by two types of interlayer interactions, namely argentophilic and p-p interactions, leading to an unprece- dented double-layer 2D framework (Fig. 4 and S3). There are AgIAgI interactions between layers, with Ag(1)Ag(2)i distance of 3.2551 (3) A˚ , and the bonds angles of C(26)–Ag(1)–C(17) (174.02(9)) and C(8)– Ag(2)–C(9) (172.00(9)) deviate slightly from linearity which could be due to the presence of these argentophilic interactions. The double 2D sheets show face-to-face p–p interactions between the ﬁve-membered ring (Cg1) of benzim ligands in [(benzim)AgI(CN)] units of the ﬁrst layer and six-membered ring (Cg2) of monodentate benzim ligands coordinated to the MnII of a second layer, with centroidcentroid distance (Cg(1)Cg(2)i) of 3.6298 A˚ [symmetry code: i = 1/2 ? x, y, 1/2 - z]. Moreover, these double-layer 2D networks of compound 2 are further linked to the others by p–p interactions between the coordinated benzim ligands which coordinate to MnII along the c axis, leading to a three-dimensional framework (Figure S4). Infrared spectra The IR spectra display strong peaks at 2,159 and 2,151 cm-1 for compounds 1 and 2, respectively, which can be assigned to the CN groups in both [AgI(CN)2]- and [Ag2 I(CN)3]- units which act as bidentate bridging ligands. These peaks are at higher wavenumbers than that of free [Ag(CN)2]- (2,135 cm-1) at room temperature [5]. The IR spectrum of compound 1 also exhibits strong and sharp peaks at 3,494 and 3,380 cm-1 corresponding to the m(O– H) vibration of an aqua ligand and m(N–H) vibration of an amino group in the ampyz ligand. That of compound 2 displays a broad band at *3,500 cm-1 which can be assigned to the m(O–H) vibration of a lattice water mole- cule, together with a strong and sharp peak at 3,328 cm-1, corresponding to the m(N–H) vibration of a N–H group in the benzim ligand. Conclusion Two new multiple-layer two-dimensional network hetero- metallic MnII–AgI coordination polymers have been pre- pared and structurally characterized.
