Blanton,(1) Kena J. Lanham,(1) and Sean Parkin(2) Received July 1, 2002 Reaction of CuSCN with 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (2,5-me2pyz) yields a polymeric mate- rial, [Cu2(SCN)2(2,5-me2pyz)]∞, which has been crystallographically characterized. The compound crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n with a = 5.6850(2) ˚A, b = 6.92877(3) ˚A, c = 14.3575(6) ˚A, β = 93.435(1)◦, and Z = 2. It contains [Cu(SCN)]∞ sheets in which each thiocyanate ligand acts in a µ-N,S,S-bridging mode. The sheets are bridged by 2,5-dimethylpyrazine ligands to generate a three dimensional network. The compound has also been characterized by infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. KEY WORDS: Copper(I) thiocyanate; 2,5-dimethylpyrazine; coordination polymer. Introduction Crystal engineering of coordination poly- mers is of great current research interest because it offers the potential for the rational design and synthesis of new materials with, for example, novel structural, electronic, magnetic, and cata- lytic properties.1–3 Despite the great strides made in the design and synthesis of coordination poly- mers, many factors such as the nature of the metal and ligand, solvent, temperature, and metal to lig- and mole ratio inﬂuence reactions and it is still not possible to always predict the structures of the products on the basis of the components present in (1) Department of Chemistry, Eastern Kentucky University, Richmond, Kentucky 40475-3102.

In order to achieve improved structural control, more exploratory work has to be done in this area. The generation of inﬁnite-ordered frame- works may be achieved by linking together tetrahedral or octahedral metal centers through rod-like connecting ligands, such as pyrazine.4 Copper(I) is a suitable candidate for pyrazine and its derivatives because, as a soft acid, it favors coordination to soft bases such as ligands con- taining nitrogen and sulfur atoms. Lever et al.5,6 prepared the ﬁrst copper(I)-pyrazine complexes in the early 1960s, but it was not until 1989 that we reported the ﬁrst X-ray structural study of a pyrazine-bridged copper(I) polymer.7 Since then the number of structural studies of one-, two-, and three-dimensional coordination polymers of copper(I) with pyrazine and its methyl substituted derivatives has continued to grow.8–25 As part of our ongoing research in this area, we report here the synthesis and structural, spectral, and thermal 335 1074-1542/03/0600-0335/0 C⃝2003 Plenum Publishing Corporation 336 Otieno, Blanton, Lanham, and Parkin properties of a three-dimensional coordination polymer of CuSCN and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine. Experimental 2,5-Dimethylpyrazine and copper(I) thio- cyanate were from commercial sources and used as received. To a slurry of CuSCN (1.00 g, 8.22 mmol) in 10 mL of acetonitrile was added 3.50 mL (32.0 mmol) of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine. The yellow precipitate that formed was isolated by ﬁltration, washed with small amounts of ace- tonitrile and diethyl ether, and then dried under vacuum for 2 h. Yield, 1.35 g (94%).

Crystals for X-ray analysis were obtained by thermal gradient recrystallization as follows. A 15-cm-long test tube containing a saturated ace- tonitrile solution of the above yellow product over an excess of the solid was placed in a heating block such that the lower end of the tube (4.5 cm) was at about52◦Candtheupperendatroomtemperature. Crystals were harvested after a 6-week period. Elemental analysis was performed by Midwest Microlab, Indianapolis, IN. Infrared spectra were recorded as KBr pellets on a Bio- Rad Model FTS3000 FT-IR spectrometer.

Fig. 1 and selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 3. The coordination geometry around each copper atom is made up of two sulfur atoms from two different thiocyanate ligands, one nitrogen atom from a third thiocyanate ligand, and a second nitrogen atom from a 2,5- dimethylpyrazine ligand. Bond angles about the copper atom range from 97.06(6)◦to 134.10(8)◦. Thus, the CuS2N2 chromophore has a highly distorted tetrahedral geometry. The Cu---S bond lengths in 1, 2.4189(8) and 2.4230(8) ˚A, are longer than those observed in other copper(I)- Fig. 1. A view of the copper(I) coordination environment in [Cu2(SCN)2(2,5-me2pyz)]∞.

For example, [Cu(SCN) (quinoline)]∞,28 [Cu(SCN)(4-methylpyrimidine]∞,11 and [Cu(SCN) (PCH3(C6H5)2)2]229 have Cu---S bond lengths of 2.407(2) ˚A, 2.456(1) ˚A, and 2.46(1) ˚A, respectively. The three-dimensional structure of 1 is sim- ilar to that observed for the parent pyrazine ana- logue, [Cu2(SCN)2(pyz)]∞,12 and is shown in Fig. 2. The coordination of three thiocyanate groups (one µ-N and two µ-S) about each copper atom results in the formation of ten-membered Cu---S---Cu---NCS---Cu---NCS rings. Each ring can be considered to assume a pseudo-chair con- formation if the rigid rod-like thiocyanate ligand is treated as a single center. The rings are fused together to form undulating sheets perpendicular to the c axis. Adjacent sheets are cross-linked by 2,5-dimethylpyrazine ligands to generate a three- dimensional network containing channels running parallel to the a axis. Similar channels in the 338 Otieno, Blanton, Lanham, and Parkin Fig. 2. A packing diagram of [Cu2(SCN)2(2,5-me2pyz)]∞viewed down the a axis and showing the channels. Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity. unsubstituted pyrazine analogue were found to have no solvent accessible volume.12 Thus, the channels in 1 also would not be expected to ac- commodate solvent molecules, especially since the methyl substituents on the pyrazine ring im- pose additional steric constraints. Compound 1 has also been characterized by infrared spectroscopy and TGA. The thiocyanate ion has three vibrational modes, namely the C---N stretching mode (νCN), the C---S stretching mode (νCS), and the NCS bending mode (δNCS). The in- frared spectrum of 1 exhibits an intense band at 2123 cm−1 assigned to νCN. Two additional bands of weak to medium intensity (2174 cm−1 and 2078 cm−1) are observed in the νCN stretching re- gion. νCS and δNCS are observed at 768 cm−1 and 444cm−1,respectively.Thesespectralfeaturesare consistent with those observed for other copper(I) thiocyanate complexes.12,13,30 The TGA thermo- gram of 1 shows a weight loss corresponding to one 2,5-dimethylpyrazine in the 117–240◦C tem- perature range (observed = 29.6%, calculated = 30.8%). The resultant CuSCN decomposes in two steps, with weight losses of 18.2% and 6.8% observed in the temperature ranges 280–450◦C and 450–570◦C, respectively. The weight of the residue observed at 570◦C suggests that the prod- uctatthistemperatureisCu2S(observed=44.5%, Polymer of CuSCN with 2,5-dimethylpyrazine 339 calculated = 45.3%). The initial loss of the neutral ligand near 200◦C has been observed for the anal- ogous complexes, Cu2X2(pyz), where X = Cl, Br, or I and pyz = pyrazine.8,9 This is followed by the almost complete loss of the resulting metal halides in the 530–580◦C temperature range.
