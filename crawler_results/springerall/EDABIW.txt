Manuscript Synthesis, Crystal Structures and Luminescence of Organic-Lanthanide Complexes with Nicotinic Acid and Adipic Acid Ligands Jian-Ling Wang • Feng-Ying Bai • Zhuo Wang • Zhao-Yan Deng • Yong-Heng Xing Received: 12 October 2011 / Accepted: 24 November 2011 / Published online: 9 December 2011  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract Two new lanthanide coordination polymers, [Sm2(nic)3(ad)0.5(H2O)(l3-O)2] (1), [Pr(nic)(ad)]2H2O (2) (nic = nicotinic acid, ad = adipic acid) have been syn- thesized hydrothermally from the self-assembly of the lanthanide ions (Ln3?) with rigid nicotinic acid and the ﬂexible adipic acid. They were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray dif- fraction. Structural analyses reveal that both of the com- plexes crystallize in triclinic, space group P-1 and have different framework characterization. Because of different coordination modes of nicotinate, complexes 1 and 2 exhibit 2D and 3D framework structure, respectively. In 1, the Sm1 and Sm2 atoms and their corresponding centro- symmetric atoms are connected by bridging oxygen atoms to form a 1D Sm2(l3-O)2 polymeric chain along [010] direction. The photoluminescent properties of 1 and ther- mogravimetric analysis of 1 and 2 are discussed in detail. Keywords Lanthanide coordination polymers  Nicotinic acid  Adipic acid  Crystal structures  Thermal stability 1 Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest in recent years not only stemming from their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis, gas adsorption, magnetism, NLO materials, luminescence, molecular sensing and separation and molecular recogni- tion, but also from their fascinating structural diversity and the intriguing topological networks [1–6]. The use of appropriate bridging ligands which can bind metal ions in various coordination modes is a successful strategy in building such frameworks. Among the various ligands, pyridine carboxylate is a conjugated structural motif and asymmetrically divergent ligands, and it can bind to two, three or more lanthanide metal centers by the pyridyl N atom and the carboxylic O atoms [7–12]. Thus pyridine carboxylic acid as a potential linker has drawn extensive attention in the construction of MOFs [13–17]. And the long chain dicarboxylate [O2C(CH2)nCO2] has also a large variation in coordination behavior including chelating, bidentate-bridging or chelating-bridging modes, which allows for the formation of clusters, cage structures or open frameworks [18–21]. As we know, lanthanide ions, with their high and variable coordination numbers and ﬂexible coordination environments, are good candidates used to provide unique opportunities for constructing unusual MOFs [22–26]. On the basis of above-mentioned consid- eration, we are currently interested in using pyridine car- boxylate ligand to construct lanthanide-based MOFs. So far, most of the work has been documented in the ﬁeld of constructing lanthanide-nicotinic acid complexes [27–30]. Lanthanide-nicotinic acid coordination frameworks with ancillary ligands, however, have much less been investi- gated [31, 32]. In this paper, we combined nicotinic acid ligand, adipic acid ligand and Ln3? cation, successfully Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10904-011-9641-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

The luminescent properties of 1 and thermal stability of 1 and 2 have also been investigated. 2 Experimental Section All chemicals purchased were of reagent grade or better and were used without further puriﬁcation. C, H and N analyses were made on a Perkin-Elmer 240 C automatic analyzer at the analysis center of Liaoning Normal Uni- versity. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on JASCO FT/ IR-480 PLUS Fourier transform spectrophotometer with pressed KBr pellets in the range 200–4,000 cm-1. The luminescence spectra were reported on a JASCO FP-6500 spectroﬂuorimeter (solid). Thermogravimetric anaylsis (TGA) was performed under N2 atmosphere at 1 atm with a heating rate of 10 C/min on a Perkin Elmer Diamond TG/ DTA. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data were collected on a Bruker Advance-D8 with Cu Ka radiation, in the range 5 \ 2h \ 60, with a step size of 0.02 (2h) and an acquisition time of 2 s per step. 2.1 Synthesis of [Sm2(nic)3(ad)0.5(H2O)(l3-O)2] (1) Complex 1 was prepared by hydrothermal reaction. Sm2O3 (0.10 g, 0.29 mmol), nicotinic acid (0.10 g, 0.81 mmol), adipic acid (0.10 g, 0.68 mmol) and H2O (10 mL) were mixed in 25 mL beaker. After stirring for 2 h, the mixture was sealed in the bomb and heated at 180 C for three days, then cooled at 10 C/3 h to 100 C, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. After ﬁltration, the product was washed with distilled water and then dried at room temperature. Yellow crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained in ca. 54% yield based on Sm(III).

Reﬂection data were collected at room temperature on a Bruker AXS SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). All absorption corrections were performed using the SADABS program [33]. Crystal structures were solved by the direct method. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropi- cally. All hydrogen atoms were ﬁxed at calculated posi- tions with isotropic thermal parameters. All calculations were performed using the SHELX-97 program [34].

Under rela- tively high temperature and pressure, the problems associated with ligand solubility can be well-solved; thus the reactivity of reactants in the crystallization process was efﬁciently enhanced. In the hydrothermal process, many factors may affect the crystallization and structural con- struction of the products, such as initial reactants, pH value, and temperature, etc. In our ﬁrst attempts, lanthanide nitrate salts were treated with the two types of carboxylic acids, namely, nicotinic acid and adipic acid, with various molar ratios and pH values. Unfortunately, we only obtained the clear solution, corresponding to 1 and 2 were not obtained. Later, we replaced lanthanide nitrate salts with lanthanide oxide, the complex 1 and 2 were obtained by choosing nicotinic acid, adipic acid and Ln2O3 (Ln = Sm, Pr) as the starting materials, respectively.

Hence it may be attributed to the nature of the different lanthanide ions. 3.2 Crystal Structure Analysis X-ray single crystal analysis indicates that complex 1 has a two-dimensional framework, crystallizing in triclinic sys- tem, space group P-1. It is a dinuclear complex, and the asymmetric unit of [Sm2(nic)3(ad)0.5(H2O)(g3-O)2] con- tains one eight-coordinated samarium ion (Sm1) and one nine-coordinated samarium ion (Sm2), three nicotinic acid ligands, half adipic acid ligand, one coordinated water molecule and two bridging O atoms. The coordination environments of the two samarium ions (Sm1 and Sm2) are shown in Fig. 1a. Sm1 is coordinated with eight oxygen atoms from one chelating bidentate carboxyl group (O2 and O3) and two monodentate carboxyl group (O1 and O4) from nicotinic acid, one monodentate carboxyl group (O5) from adipic acid, and three bridging O atoms (O6, O7 and O7#1). The nine oxygen atoms coordinated with Sm2 are from three monodentate carboxyl groups (O2#1, O8 and O10) from nicotinic acid ligand, one chelating bidentate carboxyl group (O5#2 and O11) from adipic acid ligand, one coor- dinated water (O9W), and three bridging O atoms (O6, O6#2 and O7). Thus, eight oxygen atoms coordinate to Sm1 ion to form a slightly distorted dodecahedron SmO8 poly- hedron conﬁguration (Fig. 1b). For Sm2 the nine oxygen atoms coordinated together with Sm2 ion to form a slightly distorted tricapped prism SmO9 polyhedron geometry (Fig. 1c). The Sm–Oad (from adipic moiety), Sm–Onic (from nicotinic moiety) and Sm–Owater (from coordinated water) bond lengths are in the ranges of 2.414(4)– 2.633(4) A˚ , 2.411(4)–2.684(4) A˚ , and 2.436(4) A˚ , respec- tively, all of which are similar to those found in the related samarium-oxygen donor complexes [35]. The O– Sm –O bond angles vary from 50.42(13) to 155.69(12)8. The nic- otinic acid ligand exhibits two types of coordination modes: (i) the carboxylate group adopts a l2–g1–g1-bridging (namely one oxygen atom of the carboxylate group con- nects one samarium ion, the other one connects also one samarium ion and the carboxylate group coordinates to two metal ions) coordination mode (Scheme 1b); (ii) the car- boxylate group adopts a l1–g1–g1-bridging (namely one oxygen atom of the carboxylate group connects one samarium ions, the other one connects one samarium ion and the carboxylate group coordinates to one metal ion) coordination mode (Scheme 1c). There is in only one type of coordination mode of bridging tridentate for every side carboxylate group of the adipate. Whole adipate ligand is bound in the form of six bridging tridentate chelate coor- dination (Scheme 1a). In the framework, lanthanide metal center atoms (Sm1 and Sm2) and their corresponding centrosymmetric atoms are interconnected through adipate ligand to be assembled into a complicated two-dimensional (2D) structure. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Sm1 and Sm2 ions and their corre- sponding centrosymmetric atoms are connected by l32O (O6, O7) to form a 1D Sm2(l32O)2 polymeric chain along [010] direction. The chain is further connected by adipate ligand to give a 2D planar layer in the ac plane (Fig. 2b), moreover nicotinic acid ligand inserted in the structure to amplify the construction of the 2D structure (Fig. 2c). The crystal structure of the complex 2 reveals that it is a three-dimensional framework, crystallizing in triclinic Fig. 2 a The 1D chain linked by bridging O atoms; b 1D chain linked by adipate forming a 2D structure in ac plane; c The 2D packing framework of complex 1 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:807–815 811 123 system, space group P-1. An asymmetric unit of 2 contains one nine-coordinated praseodymium ion (Pr), one nicotinic acid ligand, and one adipic acid ligand, exhibiting a slightly distorted dodecahedron conﬁguration (Fig. 3b). The coordination environment of the praseodymium ions (Pr) is shown in Fig. 3a. The Pr ion is coordinated by four oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3#3, O4#3) of chelating bidentate carboxyl groups from two different adipic acid ligands, two oxygen atoms (O1#5, O3#1) of monodentate carboxyl groups from two different adipic acid ligands, two oxygen atoms (O5#2, O6#4) of monodentate carboxyl groups from two nicotinic acid ligands, and one nitrogen atom (N1) of monodentate from one nicotinic acid ligand. The Pr–Oad (from adipic moiety) and Pr–Onic (from nicotinic moiety) bond lengths are in the range of 2.410(4)–2.756(4) and 2.422(4)–2.461(4) A˚ , respectively, while Pr-N1 is 2.736(5) A˚ . The O–Pr–O bond angles vary from 49.40(13) to 154.89(12)8. All of them are similar to those found in the related praseodymium-oxygen donor complexes [36]. Each nicotinic acid ligand acts as a l3-bridge to link three Pr(III) ions as shown in Scheme 1d, in which carboxyl group links two metal atoms in monodentate fashion and the one nitrogen atom also ligates one metal atom in monodentate fashion. The coordination mode of adipate is similar to that of 1. Pr atom is interconnected through nicotinate ligand and adipate ligand to be assembled into a three-dimensional (3D) structure. As shown in Fig. 4a the adjacent Pr ions are linked through bridging oxygen atoms of the carboxylate groups from adipate ligand to form a 1D Pr–O2–Pr poly- meric chain along [010] direction. The PrPr contact along the Pr–O2–Pr 1D chain is 11.9723 A˚ . The chain is further connected by adipate ligand to give a 2D Pr–ad planar layer in the [101] plane (Fig. 4b). When viewed along the [010] direction, the rigid nicotinate ligand further links these 2D layers, to construct a 3D packing framework (Fig. 4c). Two novel lanthanide coordination polymers 1 and 2 were successfully synthesized under the same conditions except for using different metal ions. In the two coordi- nation polymers, different metal ions have different coor- dination conﬁgurations, metal radii and coordination environments. X-ray single crystal analysis indicates that complex 1 exhibits a 2D structure and it is a dinuclear complex, while 2 has a 3D structure. Additionally, Fig. 3 a The coordination environment of Pr(III) ion in 2. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. (Symmetry codes follow: #1 -x, -y ? 1, -z; #2 -x ? 1, -y ? 2, -z ? 1; #3 x ? 1, y, z ? 1; #4 x, y - 1, z; #5 -x, -y ? 1, -z ? 1); b The distorted tricapped trigonal prism polyhedron structure of Pr 812 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:807–815 123 although the complexes 1 and 2 contain the same ligands, they show different packing structures, this is because they have different coordination modes of the nicotinate ligand. For 1, the nicotinate adopts two types of coordination modes as a terminal coordination to metal atom (Sche- me 1b). For 2, the nicotinate ligand adopts a tridentate bridging mode to coordination metal ions (Scheme 1d). As for adipate ligand, it adopts the same coordination modes in 1 and 2. Thus, in the process of formation of the com- plexes, the coordination mode of the rigid carboxylate is an important factor that inﬂuences the packing structure. Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that it is the metal source and different coordination modes that inﬂuences the structures of the coordination polymers. 3.3 X-ray Powder Diffraction Study The X-ray powder diffraction data of complexes 1 and 2 were measured. The experimental peak positions are in agreement with that simulated on the basis of their struc- tural data (Figs. 5, 6). The results show that complexes have been obtained successfully as pure crystalline phases. 3.4 Thermal Properties The thermal stability of complex 1 and 2 in N2 atmosphere were examined by thermogravimetry in the temperature range of 25–1,000 C. As shown in Fig. S1, the thermal decomposition process of complex 1 can be divided into two stages. The ﬁrst weight loss of 10.6% is between 36 and 352 C, corresponds to the release of one coordination water molecule and half adipate ligand (11.4%, theoretical weight loss). The second weight loss of 46.3% was observed in the temperature range of 352–788 C, which is attributed to the release of three nicotinate ligand (46.4%, theoretical weight loss). For 2, the thermal decomposition process shows two stages (Fig. S2). The ﬁrst weight loss of 7.50% between 39 and 359 C corresponds to the release of two lattice water molecule (8.12%, theoretical weight loss). The second weight loss of 42.28% was observed in the temperature range of 359–837 C, which is attributed to the release of one CO2 molecule and one adipate ligand (42.45%, theoretical weight loss). 3.5 Photoluminescent Properties The solid-state luminescent behavior of complex 1 was investigated at room temperature. When excited at 402 nm with slit width (3:1), it emits pink light. The emission spectra of polymer 1 are shown Fig. 7. A wide and strong emission band, which appeared at 412–467 nm was assigned to intraligand transition of nicotinic acid, imply- ing that the energy was not fully transferred from the linker nicotinic acid to Sm ions. The band in the region 540–640 nm was assigned to the emission of samarium, which corresponds to the 4G5/2?6Hn (n = 5/2 - 9/2) transitions at 562, 602 and 644 nm, respectively. But it was found that the emission signals of samarium are very weak. It might be because the triplet-state energy of ligand is a little greater than the energy gap (DE) between the excited state and ground state of the lanthanide metal ion, so that low efﬁcient luminescence could be observed [37–39]. 3.6 IR Spectrum The IR spectra of complexes 1 and 2 are examined (Figs. S3, S4). The IR spectra of complexes 1 presents a wide and strong peak around 3,450 cm-1, accounting for the Fig. 4 a 1D Pr–O2–Pr inﬁnite polymeric chain of complex 2 along [010] direction; b 2D sheet structure formed by polymeric chain and adipate ligand in the ac plane; c The 3D packing framework of complex 2 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:807–815 813 123 appearance of the coordination water molecule. The bands in the region of 1547 and 1469, 1424 cm-1 are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylate groups in nicotinate and adipate ligands. The bands of 2,953 and 2,866 cm-1 are typical absorptions of the mC–H vibration modes of –CH2– groups within the carbon chain of adipate. The IR spectra of complexes 2 present a wide and strong peak around 3,433 cm-1, accounting for the appearance of the guest water molecule. The bands in the region of 1615, 1547 and 1420, 1323 cm-1 are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylate groups in nicotinate and adipate ligands. The bands of 2,949 and 2,871 cm-1 are typical absorptions of the mC–H vibration modes of –CH2– groups within the carbon chain of adipate. 4 Conclusions In this work, two new lanthanide coordination polymers based on nicotinate and adipate as ligand have been syn- thesized for the ﬁrst time under hydrothermal conditions. The X-ray analyses reveal that different lanthanide com- plexes have different structures. For complex 1 the Sm1 and Sm2 ions are connected by two l32O to form a di- nuclear units and it is a 2D structure while complex 2 has a three-dimensional molecular structure. The thermogravi- metric analysis and photoluminescent properties of 1 were discussed. Complex 1 emits green luminescence at room temperature and they could be anticipated as potential ﬂuorescent materials. Currently, we are pursuing the design and construction of lanthanide coordination polymers with nicotinic acid ligand and other ﬂexible ligand as mixed- linkers in our laboratory. 5 Supporting Information Available Figure S1 have denoted the TG curves for complex 1 and Figs.
