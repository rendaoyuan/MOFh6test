Manuscript Monomeric and polymeric structures derived from 3,30,4,40-biphenyltetracarboxylic acid, phenanthroline and metal ions Shourong Zhu Æ Hui Zhang Æ Min Shao Æ Yongmei Zhao Æ Mingxing Li Received: 30 January 2008 / Accepted: 10 April 2008 / Published online: 30 April 2008  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008 Abstract Under similar hydrothermal synthetic conditions, the reactions of Fe(NO3)3/FeCl2, CuCl2, NiCl2, and CdCl2 with phenanthroline (phen) and 3,30,4,40-biphenyltetra- carboxylic acid (H4BPTC) afforded complexes [Fe(phen)3]- (H3BPTC)2 (1), [Cu(phen)(BPTC)0.5  H2O]  H2O (2), [Ni3(phen)3(BPTC)1.5(H2O)5]  4H2O (3) and [Cd(phen)- (BPTC)0.5]  H2O (4). The short Fe–N distance in the mono- meric Fe(phen)3(H3 BPTC)2 (1) shows that the Fe(II) is in a low-spin state. H3 BPTC4- acts as a counter-ion in this com- plex. In [Cu(phen)(BPTC)0.5  H2O]  H2O (2), the central Cu(II) is ﬁve-coordinated in a square-pyramidal geometry. The ligand BPTC4- is centrosymmetric and the four depro- tonated carboxylic groups of BPTC4- are coordinated to four different copper ions to form a 1D ladder complex indicating a comparatively strong coordination. In [Ni3(phen)3(BPTC)1.5- (H2O)5]  4H2O (3), all nickel(II) atoms are in an octahedral coordination environment. There are two different BPTC4- ligands; one is centrosymmetric and the other is asymmetric. Metal ions are linked through fully deprotonated BPTC4- ligands to form a 2D metal-organic sheet. [Cd(phen) (BPTC)0.5]  H2O (4) has a 3D metal-organic framework. TG, IR, and ﬂuorescence data for the complexes are presented. Introduction The designed construction of coordination polymers from soluble molecular building blocks represents one of the most challenging issues facing synthetic chemistry today [1, 2]. In the past decade, considerable progress has been made in the design and engineering of multidimensional metal-organic compounds with regard to their potential application in various areas. Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are important coordination polymers that have attracted widespread interest in the past decade because of their fascinating structures and intriguing potential applications. Studies in catalysis, mag- netism, nonlinear optics, separation, and gas storage illustrate the versatility of MOFs [3–7]. In particular, porous structures constructed from discrete metal-carboxylate clusters and organic links have been shown to be amenable to systematic variation in pore size and functionality, an aspect that has led to the synthesis of MOFs capable of remarkable methane and hydrogen storage properties [8–13]. Most coordination polymers and/or MOFs use multi- oxygen and nitrogen building blocks which can coordinate with metal ions in different ways, resulting in the formation of various MOFs with speciﬁc topologies and useful properties. Many efforts have been directed toward the rational design of functional metal-organic crystalline materials [14]. Various metal-organic coordination frame- works have been constructed from the metal complexes of bi-, tri-, and tetracarboxylate ligands [2, 10] (Chart 1). The prediction of crystal structures is still a difﬁcult task, but their retrospective analysis provides important information for the design of materials with speciﬁc properties. The ﬁnal supramolecular architecture is inﬂu- enced by the reaction conditions, the anions, and the solvent used. The inﬂuence of counterions and solvent molecules can be drastic because they can exhibit coordi- nating properties or, in a template role, are involved in noncovalent interactions such as H-bonding or pi-pi stacking, so stabilizing the metal-organic assembly [15].

The ﬁrst step to achieve this goal is to synthesize MOFs from transition metals with multidentate spacer ligands. In this context, we chose neutral phen as a chelating ligand, plus exodentate biphenyltetracarboxylic acid as a linear spacer building block. BPTC has been well explored as a component for high performance polymers [16]. MOFs composed from BPTC4- anions [17–20] are far fewer than those from 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid [21–23] and 3,5-tris- (4-carboxyphenyl)benzene (BTB) [24, 25]. During the preparation of this manuscript, a report on the BPTC4--Cd(II) complex appeared, however, the syn- thetic process are somewhat different and the structure we discuss and the photoluminescence data are somewhat different from reported [26]. Experimental Materials and methods All chemicals purchased were of reagent grade and used without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analyses were determined using a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. IR spectra were recorded in the 4000–400 cm-1 region using KBr pellets and a Nicolet AVATAR-370 spectrometer. Excitation and emission spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu F-4500 ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer, using slit width of 3 nm excitation and 3 nm emissions at room temperature for the solid samples. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) data were collected on a Netzsch STA-409PC instrument under air in the temperature range 30–600 C with a heating rate of 10 C/min.

X-ray crystallography A Bruker SMART Apex II CCD diffractometer Mo- Ka(k = 0.71073 A˚ ) was used to collect data on the crys- tals. Data collection and cell reﬁnement was performed using APEX2 and Bruker SAINT programs. Structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 [27] and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares reﬁnement on F2 with anisotropic displacement parameters for non-H atoms using SHELXL-97 [27]. Hydrogen atoms were generated geo- metrically. The crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1. The selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. Results and discussion The structures of coordination polymers containing car- boxylate ligands are very often sensitive to the pH values of the solutions. Our goal is to synthesize a neutral coor- dination polymer, so base is needed to deprotonate H4BPTC to balance the positively charged metal ions. We therefore, added four drops 1.0 M NaOH corresponding to 0.15– 0.20 mmol, which is 3–4 equivalent to H4BPTC, hence roughly neutral. Strong base would precipitate metal ion while acid conditions will decrease the coordination ability of BPTC due to its protonation. As we expected, H4BPTC is deprontated in all the complexes except [Fe(phen)3](H3- BPTC)2. The chemistry of iron-phenanthroline (Fe/phen) complexes has a long history. Formation of complexes involving Fe and 1,10-phenanthroline depends on the synthetic conditions, especially the oxidation state of the iron. Tris-(1,10-phenanthroline)iron(II), ([Fe(phen)3]2+, commonly known as ferroin) is generally prepared from iron(II). The analogous [Fe(phen)3]3+ complex does not exist in solutions prepared from iron(III) [28, 29]. Tem- perature will also increase the oxidation potential. Reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) under hydrothermal condition has been reported previously [30–32]. As for the proton- ation of BPTC4- in [Fe(phen)3]  (H3 BPTC)2, this can be explained by the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) which will increase the acidity. Due to oxidation changes and very low yields in syn- thesis of [Fe(phen)3]  (H3 BPTC)2, we used FeCl2 instead of Fe(NO3)3, biphenyltetracarboxylic acid dianhydride was doubled, and phen tripled as required by the formula. The yield from this experiment was much higher. Thermogravimetric analysis In order to examine the thermal stability of the four com- pounds, TG in air under 1 atm of pressure at a heating rate of 10 C/min was performed on polycrystalline samples, which showed multi-step weight loss in the temperature range of 30–500 C. 1 is stable up to 243 C. It lost 43% of its weight at 349 C, corresponding to the loss of three phen (43.1%). The TGA diagram of 2 indicates three main steps of weight loss. The compound loses two water Transition Met Chem (2008) 33:669–680 671 123 molecules in the range 45–170 C (observed: 8.2%, calcd: 8.1%). The release of the BPTC ligands occurs in tem- perature ranges 250–370 C (observed: 31.3%, calcd: 33.2%). Further increase in temperature results in loss of phen. The ﬁnal residue of 17.7% at 710 C is in agreement with the percentage of CuO (calcd: 17.9%). The TGA diagram of 3 indicates three main steps of weight loss. The initial weight loss of 5.2% at 145 C corresponds to the removal of four crystalline waters in the complex. The weight loss of 11.9% at 261 C corresponds to the removal of nine water molecules (calcd: 11.9%), all waters including coordinated water are lost at this tem- perature. The third weight loss of 38.9% between 210 and 440 C is consistent with the removal of phen (calcd: 39.51%). The TGA diagram of 4 indicates three main steps of weight loss. The weight loss of 3.3% from room temper- ature at 178 C corresponding to one crystalline water (3.80%). The complex is very stable up to *355 C. The second weight loss of 34.23% occurs in the range 355– 430 C, which can be attributed to the elimination of BPTC (calcd: 34.43%). The third step is attributed to the further decomposition of the phen ligands. Crystal structures of [Fe(phen)3]  (H3bptc)2] (1) As shown in Fig. 1, six nitrogens of three phenanthrolines are coordinated to Fe(II). H3BPTC- is not coordinated. The N–Fe–N angle in each phen is *838. All other angles are quite close to a regular octahedron. The Fe–N distances are 1.957–1.967 A˚ , the same as in tris(1,10-phenanthro- line)iron(II) [33, 34]. This is the shortest M–N distance in all four metal complexes (M = Fe(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), and Cd(II)), suggesting that the central Fe(II) is low-spin [35]. The distance between the nearest H3BPTC- layers shown in Fig. 1b is roughly 4.6 A˚ , which is longer than the pi-pi stacking distance *3.5 A˚ and therefore, shows there are no pi-pi stacking interactions in 1 [36, 37]. In Fig. 1b, the nearest distance between the H3BPTC- layers is 7.4 A˚ , while the longest distance is 8.5 A˚ , which is smaller than the [Fe(phen)3]2+ polyhedra diameter of 9.2 A˚ . The [Fe(phen)3]2+ polyhedra are arranged as shown in Fig. 1b.

H3BPTC- is not coordinated to the metal ion. The two phenyl rings in H3BPTC- are not coplanar. They have a torsion angle of 17.728 which helps them form a puckered sheet around the complex cation (Fig. 1b). The H3PBTC- sheets are linked by H-bonds between carboxylate oxygens to form a 38-membered ring. A coordinated phenanthroline is perpendicularly located in the center of the ring. The crystal structure shows several intermolecular hydrogen bonds (Table 2).

The BPTC4- and complex are centrosymmetrically linked by C(16)–C(16) of BPTC4-. Cu(II) is coordinated to two carboxylic oxygens O(1) and O(4) with Cu–O distances of 1.932(2) and 1.950(2), respectively. Two phenanthroline nitrogen atoms also chelate to Cu with Cu–N distances of 2.013(2) and 2.023(2) A˚ , respectively. A water molecule O(1w) is coordinated to Cu in the axial position with a longer Table 2 continued N(5)–Ni(3)–O(5) 96.61(13) O(9)–Ni(3)–O(14) 86.36(13) N(5)–Ni(3)–O(14) 92.65(14) O(5)–Ni(3)–O(14) 87.18(12) O(9)–Ni(3)–N(6) 95.45(13) N(5)–Ni(3)–N(6) 80.11(15) O(5)–Ni(3)–N(6) 176.67(13) O(14)–Ni(3)–N(6) 93.51(14) O(9)–Ni(3)–O(15) 93.15(11) N(5)–Ni(3)–O(15) 87.77(12) O(5)–Ni(3)–O(15) 93.71(11) O(14)–Ni(3)–O(15) 178.97(13) N(6)–Ni(3)–O(15) 85.64(12) The H-bond distances (DA) and angles (D–HA) are D–HA d(D–H) d(HA) d(DA) \(DHA) O(19)–H(19B)O(8) 0.87 1.95 2.778(6) 156.7 O(19)–H(19A)O(18)#4 0.78 2.17 2.921(8) 161.4 O(18)–H(18A)O(2) 0.85 2.00 2.761(5) 148.7 O(18)–H(18B)O(19)#5 0.90 2.07 2.921(8) 157.4 O(20)–H(20A)O(6)#6 0.87 1.90 2.767(5) 173.8 O(17)–H(17A)O(20) 0.82 1.91 2.701(5) 162.6 O(15)–H(15A)O(10) 0.82 1.90 2.636(4) 149.0 O(13)–H(13A)O(8)#1 0.82 1.83 2.579(4) 151.4 4d Cd(1)–O(3)#1 2.2206(17) Cd(1)–N(1) 2.323(2) Cd(1)–O(4)#2 2.3227(18) Cd(1)–N(2) 2.382(2) Cd(1)–O(1) 2.387(2) Cd(1)–O(2) 2.4386(18) Cd(1)–O(4) 2.787(2) O(3)#1–Cd(1)–N(1) 123.89(7) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(4)#2 109.16(7) N(1)–Cd(1)–N(2) 71.00(8) O(4)#2–Cd(1)–N(2) 83.56(7) O(3)#1–Cd(1)–O(1) 104.37(7) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(1) 87.90(7) O(4)#2–Cd(1)–O(1) 151.06(6) N(2)–Cd(1)–O(1) 80.14(7) O(3)#1–Cd(1)–O(2) 87.25(6) N(1)–Cd(1)–O(2) 137.77(7) O(4)#2–Cd(1)–O(2) 100.07(6) N(2)–Cd(1)–O(2) 83.10(7) O(1)–Cd(1)–O(2) 54.42(6) O(3)–Cd(1)–O(4) 51.15(7) The H-bond distances (DA) and angles (D–HA) are D–HA d(D–H) d(HA) d(DA) \(DHA) O(1 W)–H(1 WB)O(1)#1 0.82(5) 2.15(5) 2.899(4) 152(5) O(1W)–H(1WA)O(2) 0.87(5) 2.09(5) 2.955(3) 170(5) Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms: a#1 –x + 1,y, -z + 1/2; #2 x, -y + 1, z – 1/2; #3 x, -y, z – 1/2 b#1 x + 1, y, z; #2 –x - 1, -y + 1, -z + 1; #3 x - 1, y, z c#1 –x + 1, -y, -z + 2; #2 –x + 1, -y + 1, -z + 2; #3 –x + 1, -y + 1, -z + 1; #4 x - 1, y, z; #5 x + 1, y, z; #6 –x + 1, –y, –z + 1 d#1 –x, –y + 1, –z; #2 x, –y + 1, z + 1/2 674 Transition Met Chem (2008) 33:669–680 123 distance of 2.263(2) A˚ . It should be mentioned that one carboxylic oxygen O(3) has a longer Cu–O distance of 2.872 A˚ with the O(1w)–Cu–O(3) angle of 140.16(7), which is almost trans to coordinated water. A 2.675(3) A˚ Cu–O distance has been described as a bond [38]. The sum of the van der Waals radii of the Cu and O atoms (2.92 A˚ ) [39] is quite similar to 2.872 A˚ , therefore, we think the 2.872 A˚ Cu–O distance is too long for coordination. The angle in the four-membered ring, O(4)–Cu(1)–O(3) angle 50.44(7)8 is smaller than in ruthenium(II) complex 60.22(5)8 [40], therefore, the angle is too sharp to be considered as coordination. Each BPTC4- ligates to four Cu(II) atoms. The two phenyl rings are coplanar, but the two carboxylate groups are neither coplanar nor perpendicular to the phenyl ring. They have torsion angles of 358 and 608. In a similar complex [Cu2 (3,5-BPTC)(H2O)2(dmf)3(H2O)] (where 3,5-BPTC is 3,30,5, 50-biphenyltetracarboxylate), the carboxylate functionalities Fig. 2 (a) Crystal structure of [Cu2(phen)2(BPTC)  (H2O)2]  2H2O segment. O(3)–Cu distance is 2.872 A˚ and may be considered weak coordination. (b) view of the 1D ladder coordination polymer from c-axis Fig. 1 (a) Crystal structure of [Fe(phen)3]  (H3BPTC)2] segment.

The complex forms a 1D ladder polymer as shown in Fig. 2b.Cu is the node that links BPTC4-into theladder. The 1D ladder chain alternates to form the 3D structure. There are H-bonds between adjacent [Cu2(phen)2(BPTC)  (H2O)2]  2H2O 1D ladders through crystalline water O(2w). The H-bond distances (DA) and angles (D–HA) are listed in Table 2. Structure of [Ni3(phen)3(BPTC)1.5(H2O)5]  4H2O (3) As shown in Fig. 3, there are three different Ni(II) and two different BPTC4- ligands in the asymmetric unit. Each Ni(II) coordinates to one phen via 2 N atoms and Fig. 3 (a) Crystal structure of [Ni3(phen)3(BPTC)1.5(H2O)5]  4H2O segment. There are two BPTC4- ligands and three different Ni(II) ions (b) view of the 2D coordination polymer from b-axis. For clarity, water has been omitted and phen represented as a ﬁve-membered ring with thin bonds, while BPTC4- is presented in thick bonds. The black triangle is a benzene ring in a BPTC4- ligand. B and C are two rings composed by Ni and PBTC4- ligands 676 Transition Met Chem (2008) 33:669–680 123 four oxygen atoms to form a NiN2O4 octahedral coordi- nation environment. There are two different BPTC4- anions in the asymmetric unit. Both BPTC4- ligands are fully deprotonated. One BPTC4- is centrosymmetrically linked through C(44). Four deprotonated carboxylate groups are monodentately coordinated to two nickels, i.e., Ni(2) and Ni(3) via carboxlylate oxygens O(12) and O(9), respectively. Not surprisingly, the two phenyl rings are coplanar in the centrosymmetric BPTC4-. The other BPTC4- shows no symmetry. The asymmetric BPTC4- coordinates to Ni(1), Ni(2) and Ni(3) via carboxylate oxygens O(1), O(3), O(7); O(4) and O(5). Ni(2) and Ni(3) coordinate to both the symmetric and asymmetric BPTC4- ligands, while Ni(1) has no connection to the symmetric BPTC4- anion. The other coordination sites are occupied by water ligands, all the nickel atoms being octahedral. The coordinated waters around Ni(2) and Ni(3) are in axial positions with longer Ni–O distances compared to the other coordinate bonds (Table 2). Ni(1) has a single water ligand at 2.158 A˚ . In the asymmetric BPTC4-, all the deprotonated carboxylates act as mono- dentate ligands except carboxylate O(3)–C(26)–O(4), which acts as a bridging ligand to Ni(1) and Ni(2). The torsion angle of the two phenyl rings in the asymmetric BPTC4- is 34.24(56)8. The nearest NiNi distance is Ni(1)Ni(2) 5.242(6) A˚ , while Ni(1)Ni(1) and Ni(2)Ni(3) are 5.456(7) and 7.616(6) A˚ , respectively. Compared with the Cu(II) complex, the equatorial M–N and M–O distances in the nickel complex 3 are obviously longer (0.05–0.1 A˚ ) indicating weaker coordination, but due to stronger Jahn-Teller effects in the Cu(II) complex, its axial position bond distances are longer than for the Ni(II) complex. As expected, the coordinated waters form H-bonds with the uncoordinated carboxylic oxygens or crystalline water (Table 2). Although the linkage in the complex is very complicated, it forms a 2D network rather than a 3D one as shown in Fig. 3b. For clarity, water has been omitted and phen represented as a ﬁve-membered ring with thin bonds, while BPTC4- is presented in thick bonds. The black triangle is a benzene ring in a BPTC4- ligand. There are three different macrocycles composed of BPTC4- and Ni(II) ions. The largest one contains six nickel atoms and six BPTC4- ligands, other two contain two Ni and two BPTC4- ligands. The largest ring is in the bc plane. Structure of [Cd(phen)(BPTC)0.5]  H2O (4) The structure of this complex has been published while this article was in preparation [26]. Our method of the prepa- ration of the complex is somewhat different from the reported procedure. 4 is a 3D microporous MOF. Based on the above structures, we summarize the coordination modes of BPTC4- in Chart 2. In complex 2, BPTC4- forms six coordination bonds with four Cu(II). The two carboxylates trans to each other are monodentately coordinated to Cu(II), while the other two carboxylates chelate to Cu(II) (Chart 2a). In complex 3, the symmetric BPTC4- coordinates to four Ni(II), each carboxylate coordinates to a Ni(II) in monodentate mode. The asym- metric BPTC4- coordinates to ﬁve Ni(II) monodentately (Chart 2b, c). In 4, each BPTC4- forms 10 coordination bonds to six Cd(II) ions. All four carboxylates chelate to Cd(II). Two carboxylates also act as bridging ligands. IR and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy Free H4BPTC has peaks at 1713, 1678, 1297, and 1264 cm-1. In the Fe(II) complex, H3BPTC- anion is not coordinated to the metal, its carboxylate bands are shifted to slightly higher wavenumbers at 1722 and 1699 cm-1. The 1297 and 1264 cm-1 bands are unchanged. These data agree well with the bands at 1690–1730 cm-1 in [Co(4,40- bipy)(H2O)4](H2BPTC)2H2O [18] and are attributed to the protonated carboxylic group. The high wavenumber indi- cates that deprotonation of the H4BPTC ligand is incomplete, while the absence of the corresponding peaks in other complexes is consistent with complete deproton- aton of the H4BPTC ligand. The very strong signals at 1297 and 1264 cm-1 observed in free H4BPTC are absent in the spectra of the Cd, Ni and Cu complexes. Free phen has very strong bands at 1504, 1423, 864, and 739 cm-1; upon coordination, the 1504 and 1423 cm-1 peaks are shifted to 1404–1387 cm-1 in the complexes. From the crystal structure data, Fe has the most strong coordination to phen; it also has the greatest shift (from 1504 to 1633 cm-1), followed by the Cu complex at 1617 cm-1. The 864 and 739 cm-1 signals in free phen are also slightly shifted to lower wavenumber in all four complexes (Fig. 4). Concerning the ﬂuorescence spectra, as shown in Fig. 5, 1 has two excitation peaks at 357 and 384 nm for 414 nm emission. When excited with higher energy 350 nm light, the complex gives two emission peaks at 418 and 437 nm. When excited with lower energy 384 nm light, the 437 nm emission is absent. This marked variation in emission peaks with excitation wavelength has been observed before [41]. Compared with photoluminescence emission bands of [Fe(phen)3]2+ at 360 and 347 nm, [42, 43] the conjugated counter ion plays an important rule in photoluminescence. Compound 4 shows a strong photoluminescence in the solid state at room temperature, with a maximum emission band at 430 nm upon excitation at 370 nm. The very broad ﬂuorescence is typical for a complex emission. These data are quite similar to [Zn(H2BPTC)(bpy)] which shows Transition Met Chem (2008) 33:669–680 677 123 maximum emission at 456 nm upon excitation at 338 nm [17] and may be attributed to ligand to metal charge transfer. However, Wang et al have reported two intense emission peaks at 419 and 506 nm for 4, respectively [26]. We measured its ﬂuorescence spectra intensively at dif- ferent wavelengths with different batches of complex. In our experiments, the complex always gives a single broad peak with emission maximum *430 nm. 300 wavelength (nm) a b c d e f g 350 400 450 500 550 600 Fig. 5 Solid state Fluorescence spectra of (a) [Cd(phen)(BPTC)0.5]  H2O (416EM); (b) [Cd(phen)(BPTC)0.5]  H2O (370EX); (c) [Fe(phen)3]  (H3BPTC)2 (414EM); (d) [Fe(phen)3]  (H3BPTC)2 (439EM); (e) [Fe(phen)3]  (H3BPTC)2 (350EX); (f) [Fe(phen)3]  (H3BPTC)2 (378EX); (g): [Fe(phen)3]  (H3BPTC)2 (384EX) O O O O O O O O Cu Cu Cu Cu O O O O O O O O Ni Ni Ni Ni O O O O O O O O Ni Ni Ni Ni Ni O O O O O O O O Cd Cd Cd Cd Cd Cd a b c d Chart 2 Coordination fashion of BPTC4- in complex 2 (a), 3 (b and c) and 4 (d) Fig. 4 Crystal structure of [Cd(phen)(BPTC)0.5]  H2O 678 Transition Met Chem (2008) 33:669–680 123 The emission data for structurally similar complexes are listed in Table 3. [Cd(phen)(BPTC)0.5]  H2O, [Cd(bpdc)- (phen)2]2H2O (H2bpdc = biphenyl-4, 40-dicarboxylic acid), Cd(BDC)(phen)DMF (H2BDC = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid), and Cd2(btec)(phen)2(H2O)2 (H4btec = 1,2,4,5-ben- zenetetracarboxylic acid) are structurally very similar to 4, they all have maximum emission at *400 nm [14], similar to our emission data. [Cd2(m-bptc)(4,40-bpy)0.5(H2O)4] (m-H4bptc = 1,10-biphenyl-2,30,3,40-tetracarboxylic acid, 4, 40-bpy = 4,40-bipyridine). Excitation of solid samples at 360 nm produces luminescence peaks with a maximum at 406 nm, this emission was attributed to intraligand emission from m-bptc [44]. [Zn(H2BPTC)(bpy)]  5bpdo (bpy = 4,40- bipyridine, and bpdo = 4,40-bipyridine N,N0-dioxide) shows strong photoluminescence in the solid state at room temper- ature,withamaximumemissionbandat456 nm(single)upon excitation at 338 nm (Fig. 5) [17]. A recent review on the ﬂuorescence of phen complexes shows that without a strong electron-donating substituent on the aromatic ring, all the emission maxima are ata wavelength lower than 500 nm with a single emission maximum [45]. Conclusion In summary, four coordination compounds, from the monomeric [Fe(phen)3]  (H3BPTC)2, 1D coordination polymer [Cu2(phen)2(BPTC)  (H2O)2]  2H2O, 2D coor- dination polymer [Ni3(phen)3(BPTC)1.5(H2O)5]  4H2O to the 3D MOF [Cd(phen)(BPTC)0.5]  H2O were con- structed. Bond distances vary according to the nature of metal: Fe(II) coordinates to phenanthroline strongly, Cu(II) coordinates to phenanthroline and carboxylic oxygen stronger than do Ni(II) and Cd(II). Fe(II), Ni(II), and Cd(II) are six-coordinated in octahedral geometry while the larger Cu(II) is ﬁve-coordinated to in square-pyramidal geometry. With 430 nm ﬂuorescence emission, [Cd(phen)(BPTC)0.5] can withstand 350 C without decomposition.
