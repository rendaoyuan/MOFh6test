Single-crystal X-ray studies show that the diphosphanes act as bridging ligands to yield a dinuclear complex (1) and one-dimensional coordi- nation polymers (2 and 4), whereas the sac ligand adopts a l2- N/O bridging mode in 2, and is N-coordinated in 1 and 4. The interaction of the silver(I) complexes with ﬁsh sperm DNA was investigated using UV–vis spectroscopy, ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, and agarose gel electrophoresis. The binding studies indicate that the silver(I) complexes can interact with ﬁsh sperm DNA through intercalation, and complexes 1 and 3 havethehighestbindingafﬁnity.Thegelelectrophoresisassay further conﬁrms the binding of the complexes with the pBR322 plasmid DNA. The minimum inhibitory concentra- tions of the complexes indicate that complex 1 exhibits very high antibacterial activity against standard bacterial strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococ- cus aureus, being much higher than those of AgNO3, silver sulfadiazine, ciproﬂoxacin, and gentamicin. Moreover, com- plexes 1–3 exhibit very high cytotoxic activity against A549 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines, compared with AgNO3 and cisplatin. The bacterial and cell growth inhibitions of the sil- ver(I) complexes are closely related to their DNA binding afﬁnities. Keywords Silver(I) complexes  Saccharinate  Tertiary diphosphanes  DNA binding  Antibacterial activity Introduction Elemental silver and silver(I) compounds have been used as antimicrobial agents for decades [1–4], and the anti- microbial activity depends on the release of Ag? ions. Silver sulfadiazine (AgSD) was introduced as an anti- bacterial and antifungal agent to prevent bacterial infec- tions in cases of severe burns [5–11]. AgSD has a polymeric structure, in which the silver(I) ions are coor- dinated by the nitrogen atoms of the pyrimidine ring and V. T. Yilmaz (&)  E. Gocmen  C.

Its effectiveness as an antimicrobial agent is due to its tendency to dissociate in solution, providing a steady supply of silver(I) ions over a period of time [6]. The mechanism for the antimicrobial action of silver(I) ions is not properly understood; however, it is generally accepted that they interfere with cell growth in three ways: (1) inhibition of transport functions in the cell wall, (2) interruption of cell metabolism, and (3) interaction with DNA [14–16]. Moreover, it was concluded that the magnitude of antimicrobial properties of silver complexes is related to the ease with which they participate in ligand exchange reactions [17]. The biological activity of sil- ver(I) complexes with oxygen-donor ligands comes from the weaker bonding property of the Ag–O bonds. In the biological system, the ease of ligand replacement of the silver(I) complexes will result in further replacement with biological ligands as protein, enzymes, and membrane- containing thiol groups in their active sites [18–21]. The water-soluble alkali salts of saccharin (also named 1,1-dioxo-1,2-benzothiazol-3-one or o-benzosulﬁmide) are widely used as a noncaloric artiﬁcial sweetener and food additive. The imino hydrogen of saccharin is acidic and thus in solution the molecule can be easily converted into the corresponding nitranion, saccharinate (sac). Sac has different coordination sites, such as one negatively charged imino nitrogen atom, one carbonyl oxygen atom, and two sulfonyl oxygen atoms. As a polyfunctional ligand, it is able to form metal complexes from mononuclear to coor- dination polymers, but in the case of bulky ligands, it sometimes remains outside the coordination sphere as a counterion [22]. Although a large number of metal com- plexes of sac have been reported in the literature, their biological activities have received less attention and only a few metal complexes of sac with anticancer activity have been reported. For example, K[Pt(sac)3(H2O)] and [(PTA)Au(sac)] (PTA is 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaada- mantane) exhibited strong antigrowth effects on HeLa and A2780 cells, respectively [23, 24]. We recently reported a number of highly cytotoxic palladium(II) and platinum(II) complexes of sac with bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine [25], 2,20:60,200-terpyridine [26–28], 2-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine [29], and 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyridine [29]. The DNA binding studies indicated that the metal sac complexes with 2,20:60,200-terpyridine interact with ﬁsh sperm DNA (FS- DNA) strongly via both intercalation and coordination as dual-function metallointercalators [30]. In addition to their antimicrobial properties, the anti- cancer activities of silver(I) complexes have received great attention in the last decade. The main advantage of the use of silver(I) complexes in the development of new anticancer drugs is their low toxicity toward humans [31]. Recently, Banti and Hadjikakou [32] reviewed the antiproliferative and antitumor properties of silver(I) compounds. The lit- erature shows that in some cases, silver(I) complexes exhibit signiﬁcant anticancer activity compared with cis- platin, a clinically used anticancer drug. The synthesis and structures of silver(I) sac complexes with phosphine ligands were not studied extensively, and there is only one example, [Ag(sac)(PPh3)2] [33]. In addi- tion, to the best of our knowledge, there is as yet little information available concerning biological evaluation of silver(I) complexes of sac, and only two studies of their antimicrobial activities have been reported [34, 35]. It was found that [Ag(sac)]n was very effective on a wide range of bacteria [35]. The encouraging results with regard to the antibacterial and anticancer activities of the metal complexes of sac led us to design a series of new silver(I) complexes bearing both sac and diphosphine ligands (named as phos- phane by IUPAC), namely, [Ag2(sac)2(l-dppm)H2O]H2O (1), {[Ag2(l-sac)2(l-dppe)]3H2OCH2Cl2}n (2), [Ag2(l- sac)2(l-dppp)]n (3), and [Ag(sac)(l-dppb)]n (4) [dppm is 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)methane, dppe is 1,2- bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, dppp is 1,3-bis(diphenyl- phosphino)propane, and dppb is1,4-bis(diphenylphos- phino)butane] (Fig. 1)]. The interactions of these complexes with DNA were studied using absorption and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, and gel electrophoresis measurements. Fur- thermore, in vitro antibacterial activity tests were performed on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and in vitro anticancer activities were tested against two human cancer (CH2)n P P S O O N C O Sac 1 2 3 4 5 6 n = 1 dppm n = 2 dppe n = 3 dppp n = 4 dppb Fig. 1 Tertiary diphosphane and saccharinate (sac) ligands used in the synthesis of [Ag2(sac)2(l-dppm)H2O]H2O (1), {[Ag2(l-sac)2(l- dppe)]3H2OCH2Cl2}n (2), [Ag2(l-sac)2(l-dppp)]n (3), and [Ag(sac)(l-dppb)]n (4), and the numbering scheme for NMR spectroscopy 30 J Biol Inorg Chem (2014) 19:29–44 123 cell lines (A549 and MCF-7) as well as a normal cell line (WI-38). Materials and methods All chemicals used in the experiments were commercial products and were used without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analyses for carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen were performed using a Costech elemental analyzer. UV– vis spectra were measured with a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded from 400 to 4,000 cm-1 with a Thermo Nicolet 6700 Fourier transform (FT) IR spectrophotometer and are reported with the following abbreviations: vs (very strong), s (strong), m (medium), w (weak), and vw (very weak). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Mercuryplus spectrometer at 400 and 100 MHz, respec- tively, in dimethyl-d6 sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) using tetra- methylsilane as an internal reference at room temperature, whereas 31P NMR spectra were recorded with an INO- VA-500 spectrometer at 200 MHz in DMSO-d6. Thermal analysis curves [thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA)] were obtained using a Seiko Exstar TG/DTA 6200 thermal analyzer in a ﬂowing air atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 C min-1 using a sample size of 5–10 mg and platinum crucibles. Fluo- rescence spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer equipped with a xenon pulse lamp of 75 kW. For all ﬂuorescence mea- surements, both slits were maintained at 5 nm. The electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker Daltonics micrOTOF II ESI time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer. The electrical conductivity measure- ments of MeOH and DMSO solutions of the sil- ver(I) complexes were performed with an Inolab Cond 730 conductimeter at room temperature and are reported as KM (S cm2 mol-1). Synthesis of 1 A solution of Na(sac)2H2O (0.06 g, 0.25 mmol) in MeCN/MeOH (10 mL, 1:1) was added dropwise to a solution of AgNO3 (0.04 g, 0.25 mmol) in MeOH (5 mL) and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room tempera- ture. Then, dppm (0.05 g, 0.125 mmol) in MeCN (5 mL) was added to the solution. The resulting clear solution was stirred for 2 h and allowed to stand in darkness at room temperature.

The addi- tion of MeCN (10 mL) to the milky suspension resulted in a clear solution. The addition of dppe (0.05 g, 0.125 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5 mL) to the solution resulted in a biphasic solution, which turned into a monophasic clear solution on addition of a mixture of DMSO and MeCN (10 mL, 2:1).

X-ray crystallography The intensity data for complexes 1, 2, and 4 were collected with an STOE IPDS 2 diffractometer with graphite-mono- chromatized Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 296 (2) C. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned on F2 with the SHELX-97 program [36]. All non- hydrogen atoms were found from the difference Fourier map and were reﬁned anisotropically, whereas the hydrogen atoms bound to carbons were reﬁned using a riding model, but those of water were reﬁned freely. Compounds 1 and 2 contain highly disordered water molecules, which were eliminated from the reﬁnement of these structures by means of the SQUEEZE subroutine of PLATON [37], and the hkl intensities were modiﬁed accordingly. In addition, the crystal of 2 was a nonmerohedral twin (twin lattice quasi- symmetry) crystal with two reciprocal lattices differently oriented, giving rise to double diffraction spot sets. The data sets of the twin parts for two different crystals were inte- grated separately and then scaled to give the hkl set used. But, because the partial overlapped reﬂections could not be integrated separately, the reﬂection count and reﬂection angle are less than 85 and 65 %, respectively. Crystal data and reﬁnement details are summarized in Table 1. Crystallographic data (without structure factors) for the structures reported in this article have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) as supplementary publication no.

DNA binding studies The concentrations of the complexes in various solutions used in this work were based on their empirical formula. FS- DNA solutions of various concentrations (0–100 lM) dis- solved in a tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethan (Tris)–HCl buffer (pH 7) were added to complexes 1–4 (10 lM dis- solved in MeOH). The amount of MeOH in these ﬁnal solutions was 4.0 %. The values of r (ratio of complex concentration to DNA concentration) ranged from 0.1 to 1.0. Absorption spectra were recorded after equilibrium had been attained at 20 C for 10 min. The intrinsic binding constant (Kb) was determined using the following equation [38]: ½DNA=ðea  efÞ ¼ ½DNA=ðeb  efÞ þ 1=Kbðeb  efÞ ð1Þ where [DNA] is the concentration of DNA in base pairs, ea, ef, and eb correspond to Aobs/[M], the extinction coefﬁcient 32 J Biol Inorg Chem (2014) 19:29–44 123 of the free metal(II) complex, and the extinction coefﬁcient of the complex in the fully bound form, respectively. The ratio of the slope to the intercept in the plot of [DNA]/ (ea - ef) versus [DNA] gives the value of Kb. Ethidium bromide (EB)–FS-DNA ﬂuorescence quench- ing experiments were conducted in the buffer by keep- ing the ratio of the DNA concentration to the EB concentration at 10 (50 lM DNA, 5 lM EB), and then the silver(I) complexes (2.5–50 lM) in MeOH were added to this solution. The buffer used in the binding studies was 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.0), containing 20 mM NaCl. All solutions were allowed to equilibrate thermally at 20 C for about 30 min before measure- ments. The ﬂuorescence spectra of the solutions were recorded in the range from 500 to 750 nm with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The quenching ability of the complexes was evaluated by the Stern–Volmer constant (KSV) [39]: I0=I ¼ 1 þ KSV ½complex ð2Þ where I0 and I are the emission intensities in the absence and presence of the complexes, respectively. KSV depends on the ratio of the concentration of bound EB to the concentration of DNA and is also called the quenching constant. On the other hand, the binding constants Kapp and KA were determined from Eq. 3 [40] and Eq. 4 [41], respectively: KEB½EB ¼ Kapp ½complex ð3Þ in which the complex concentration is that which results in a 50 % reduction of the ﬂuorescence intensity of EB and KEB = 1.0 9 107 M-1 (5.0 lM EB); log(F0  FÞ=F ¼ n logKA  n logf 1/[complex]  ½EB  DNAðF0  FÞ=F0g ð4Þ where [EB-DNA] and [complex] are the total concentra- tion of EB-DNA and silver(I) complexes, respectively. The plot of log(F0 - F)/F versus log{1/([complex] - [EB-DNA](F0 - F)/F0)} was drawn and ﬁtted linearly, and then the slope gives n, which is the number of binding sites per nucleotide. The interaction of the silver(I) complexes with super- coiled pBR322 plasmid DNA was monitored using agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid DNA (10 lM) in Tris– HCl/EDTA buffer (pH 7.6) was treated with different amounts of the silver(I) complexes (10–100 lM) in MeOH, followed by dilution with the Tris–HCl buffer to a total volume of 10 lL. Then, the samples were incubated at 37 C for 1.5 h.

Then, the samples were electrophoresed on 1 % agarose gel with 1 lg/mL EB, using 0.59 Tris– borate–EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for 1 h at 120 V at room temperature. Finally, the gel was photographed under UV light. Antibacterial activity Bacterial strains of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922 and O157:H7), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923 and ATCC 33591) were used. Broth microdilution testing was performed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cipro- ﬂoxacin, gentamicin, and the silver(I) complexes according to the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute [42]. The bacterial cultures were prepared in Mueller–Hinton broth at 37 C for 20 h. All compounds were dissolved in DMSO. Freshly prepared stock solutions were sterilized using 0.20-lm single-use ﬁlter units (Min- isart, Sartorius Stedim Biotech). Dilutions ranging from 0.007 to 775 lM were prepared in Mueller–Hinton broth, and inocula with a density equivalent to 0.5 McFarland turbidity were added to tubes containing the dilutions of the compounds. After incubation at 37 C for 20 h, the MICs were deﬁned as the minimum concentration of the com- pound that inhibited growth of the organism. The optical densities of the cultures were measured at a wavelength of 595 nm (iMark, Bio-Rad). All MIC determinations were performed in duplicate. Cytotoxic activity The samples for in vitro tests were obtained from 50 mM stock solutions of the complexes in neat DMSO. The stock solutions were then sequentially diluted with the required amount of cell culture medium in order to obtain the solutions studied, the concentration of which ranged from 1 nM to 100 lM. Untreated cells were used as a control group (0.2 % DMSO vehicle). WST-1 viability assay (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitro- phenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate sodium salt, Roche Applied Science) was performed to examine the cytotoxic effects of the concentrations of complexes 1– 4 that cause 50 % inhibition of cells (IC50) on A549 (human lung carcinoma), MCF-7 (human breast adeno- carcinoma), and WI-38 (normal human ﬁbroblasts) cell lines. The assay is based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt by viable cells into a colored formazan product that can be measured spectrophotometrically. For this purpose, these cell lines were incubated at a density of 1 9 104 cells per milliliter using 96-well plates for 24, 48, and 72 h. After the incubation periods, 10 lL of WST-1 solution was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37 C for 1 h. The absorbance (optical density) of each well was read at wavelengths of 450 and 630 nm using a microplate reader (Multiskan FC, Thermo Scientiﬁc). Each compound was tested at every concentration in triplicate in a single experiment, which was repeated three times. AgNO3 and cisplatin were used as reference cytotoxic agents. Values obtained for the vehicle-treated cells were used as the reference for 100 % viability. IC50 values were determined by sigmoidal dose–response functions using GraphPad Prism. Results and discussion Synthesis and characterization The complexes were synthesized by the reaction of Na(sac)2H2O with AgNO3 in the presence of the equiva- lent amount of the tertiary diphosphanes in solution at room temperature. The analytical data conﬁrmed the stoi- chiometry of complexes 1–4. The structures of complexes 1, 2, and 4 were conﬁrmed by X-ray crystallography. Complex 1 has a dinuclear structure, whereas complexes 2 and 4 are coordination polymers. In some cases, the molecular formula differs as a result of recrystallization. For example, the polycrystalline powder of 2 has three water molecules and a CH2Cl2 solvate in the empirical formula, but it contains only a water molecule in the crystal form, as will be discussed below. Regrettably our attempts to grow X-ray-quality crystals of complex 3 failed; how- ever, on the basis of elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy, complex 3 is assumed to have a molecular structure similar to that of complex 2, but it does not contain any solvent molecules such as water or CH2Cl2 present in 2. All complexes were obtained in high yields (over 70 %). Complexes 1–3 are stable to light for a long time, but complex 4 begins to turn brown after 2 weeks. On the other hand, the solutions of the complexes in MeOH and DMSO were kept for up to 72 h at room temperature and were checked by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The observations showed that these solutions did not change color during that time and also that there was no decom- position product in the NMR spectra. Moreover, a com- parison of the initial 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the solutions of the silver(I) complexes with those after 72 h indicated that the spectra were identical and the chemical shifts (d) differ by only 0.03 ppm for the 1H NMR spectra and 2.0 ppm for the 13C NMR spectra. All the complexes are nonhygroscopic and highly soluble in MeOH, MeCN, and DMSO. The electrical conductivity measurements indicate that the complexes exhibit a nonelectrolytic 34 J Biol Inorg Chem (2014) 19:29–44 123 behavior, with KM ranging from 21 to 58 S cm2 mol-1 in MeOH, and from 9 to 14 S cm2 mol-1 in DMSO [43]. The thermal stability of the silver(I) complexes was studied by TG–DTA. Complex 1 dehydrates between 57 and 157 C with a mass loss of 3.0 % (calculated 2.9 %), involving the lost of both the lattice and coordination water molecules. Then, the anhydrite complex begins to decom- pose exothermically at around 260 C, and the decompo- sition ends at approximately 580 C. The total mass loss of 76.7 % is consistent with the formation of Ag2O (the cal- culated mass value is 77.8 %). The mass loss up to 86 C is due to the removal of the CH2Cl2 solvate in 2, followed by dehydration. The complex decomposes exothermically between 270 and 700 C to give Ag2O (total mass loss, found 80.1 % and calculated 79.3 %). Complexes 3 and 4 are stable up to approximately 300 C, and their decom- positions end at around 800 C. The mass losses are in accord with the structures of these complexes and suggest the formation of Ag2O as the ﬁnal decomposition product. Complexes 1–4 were characterized by the positive-ion ESI–MS spectra. The different cationic species present in MeOH solution of the complexes were identiﬁed, and most relevant data are reported in ‘‘Materials and methods.’’ The isotopic distribution of these species is consistent with the calculated composition. The strongest peaks for these complexes usually correspond to dinuclear silver(I) species such as [Ag2(sac)(dppm)3]?, [Ag2(sac)(dppp)2]?, and [Ag2(sac)(dppb)2]? in accordance with possible aggrega- tion in solution and formation of these species. However, in the case of 2, the [Ag(dppe)2]? cation is the most abundant. In addition, the ESI–MS spectra also exhibit several less intense peaks related to the presence of mononuclear [Ag(diphos)]? or [Ag(diphos)2]? and dinuclear [Ag2(sac)]? cations, arising from fragmentation under the conditions used [44–49]. The spectral characterizations were performed using polycrystalline powders of the silver(I) complexes. In the IR spectra of complexes 1–4, the bands between 2,852 and 3,085 cm-1 are due to the absorption of the phenyl and CH2 groups. The C=O vibration of the sac ligand is observed as a very sharp band at in the frequency range from 1,635 to 1,655 cm-1. The asymmetric stretching of the SO2 group appears to be split into two strong bands at approximately 1,280 and 1,250 cm-1, whereas the sym- metric stretching is observed as a sharp band at approxi- mately 1,150 cm-1. A 10-cm-1 decrease in ms(SO2) in the spectrum of 2 is evidence for the coordination via the sulfonyl group in this complex. The bands at 1,425–1,450 and 1,000 cm-1 are usually assigned to the P–C vibrations of the free forms of the phosphane ligands [50, 51]. However, in the case of mixed-ligand metal complexes, it is very difﬁcult to assign these bands, and therefore the very strong absorption bands centered at around 690 cm-1 were attributed the P–C bonds in the free forms of the ligands and their complexes [52]. The 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra of complexes 1–4 were measured at room temperature in DMSO-d6 solution. The aromatic protons of both sac and diphosphanes appear Fig. 2 Molecular structure of 1. All C–H hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. The probability level of thermal ellipsoids is 40 % J Biol Inorg Chem (2014) 19:29–44 35 123 between 7.36 and 7.95 ppm as multiplets. The bridging methylene protons in 1 and 2 are observed as a singlet at 2.05 and 2.57 ppm, respectively, whereas those in 3 and 4 are centered at 2.05–2.62 and 1.55–2.36 ppm, respectively, as doublets. The methylene protons of the diphosphanes generally experience deshielding on complexation. In addition, there was a detectable signal at d 5.77 ppm cor- responding to the protons of the CH2Cl2 solvate in 2. In the 13C NMR spectra of the complexes, the carbonyl group of the sac ligand occurs at approximately d 167.50 ppm, whereas the chemical shifts for the phenyl carbons are observed in the range from 120.0 to 144.0 ppm. The 31P NMR spectra of complexes of silver(I) with phosphorous- donor ligands usually exhibit splitting owing to the 1J(P- Ag) coupling. The phosphorous nuclei in the diphosphane ligands experience deshielding by approximately 22.0–32.0 ppm at room temperature compared with those in the free forms of the ligands. The 31P NMR spectrum of complex 1 consists of a triplet centered at 8.82 ppm with two coupling constants of 504 and 688 Hz. These different Fig. 3 The coordination environment around silver(I) and the one- dimensional polymeric structure of 2. Hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity. The probability level of thermal ellipsoids is 40 %. Symmetry code: -x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z ? 1 36 J Biol Inorg Chem (2014) 19:29–44 123 coupling constants are believed to arise from the different chemical environments around the phosphorous nuclei in 1, as will be shown in the X-ray structure of the complex. On the other hand, the spectra of 2 and 4 reveal well-resolved doublets at 10.04 and 5.86 ppm, respectively. The calcu- lated coupling constants of 1J(31P-107,109Ag) are 579 Hz for 2 and 488 Hz for 4, being typical of silver(I) complexes containing the corresponding diphosphane ligands [47, 48]. In particular, the 31P NMR spectrum of 3 consists of a broad singlet at 5.86 ppm, presumably in consequence of reasonably fast exchange equilibrium at room temperature. Description of crystal structures The molecular structures of complexes 1, 2 and 4 together with their numbering schemes are given in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 2. The diphosphanes in these silver(I) complexes behave as bridging ligands as expected [53, 54], whereas the sac ligand exhibits different coordination modes [22]. Complex 1 has a dinuclear structure, in which the dppm ligand bridges the two silver(I) centers. In addition, each sil- ver(I) ion is coordinated by a nitrogen-donor sac ligand. These two silver(I) ions exhibit different coordination geometry: one has a linear geometry with an angle of 175.49 (17), whereas the other one displays a T-shaped geometry with the additional coordination of an aqua ligand (Fig. 2). The Ag–N bond distances of 2.151 (5) and 2.132 (5) A˚ are typical for silver(I) complexes containing a nitrogen-bonded sac ligand [35, 55–66], whereas both Ag– P bond distances are identical, being 2.3550 (17) A˚ and similar to those found in the silver(I) complexes of dppm [67–74], but signiﬁcantly shorter than the corresponding bonds in silver(I) complexes containing the same ligand [44–46, 49, 72, 75–96]. These short Ag–P bond distances in complex 1 may be due to the low coordination number Fig. 4 View of the coordination environment around silver(I) and the one- dimensional polymeric structure of 4. Hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity. The probability level of thermal ellipsoids is 40 %. Symmetry codes: (i) –x ? 2, y ? 1/2, -z ? 3/2; (ii) –x ? 1, y ? 1/2, -z ? 1/2 J Biol Inorg Chem (2014) 19:29–44 37 123 of silver(I) and relatively less steric hindrance of the sac ligand compared with the co-ligands in the other sil- ver(I) complexes of dppm. The individual molecules of 1 are connected by strong intermolecular O–HO hydrogen bonds between the aqua and sac ligands in the adjacent species. Moreover, relatively weak interactions such as C–HO [CO bond distance 3.464 (8) to 3.485 (7) A˚ ] and p(sac)p(sac) [CgCg bond distance 3.811 A˚ (x, -1 ? y, z); Cg, ring centroid] are also present in 1. Complex 2 is a one-dimensional coordination polymer of {[Ag2(l-sac)2(l-dppe)]H2O}n. The sac ligands adopt a l2-bridging mode via the imino nitrogen and the sulfonyl oxygen atoms, forming dinuclear [Ag(sac)]2 units with a chairlike eight-membered ring. The coordination geometry around each silver(I) ion is T-shaped. The [Ag2(sac)2] units are further bridged by the dppe ligands, leading to a linear polymeric chain of 2 (Fig. 3). The Ag–N and Ag–O bond distances are 2.160 (8) and 2.527 (7) A˚ , respectively, and are in the range of those reported for silver(I) complexes containing N,Osulfonyl bridging sac ligands [56, 97–99]. The Ag–P bond distance in complex 2 is 2.356 (3) A˚ (Table 2), being similar to the bond distances found in the sil- ver(I) complexes of dppe reported in [70, 100], but it is obviously shorter than the bond distances for sil- ver(I) complexes of dppe reported in [44, 47, 49, 91, 101– Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for complexes 1, 2, and 4 1 2 4 Ag1–N1 2.151 (5) 2.160 (8) 2.313 (2) Ag2–N2 2.132 (5) – 2.336 (2) Ag1–P1 2.3550 (17) 2.356 (3) 2.4115 (8) Ag1–P2 2.3552 (17) – 2.4198 (8) Ag2–P3 – – 2.4212 (8) Ag2–P4 – – 2.4300 (8) Ag1–O1W 2.594 (4) – – Ag1–O2i – 2.527 (7) – N1–Ag1–P1 169.11 (13) 156.0 (2) 112.70 (7) N1–Ag1–P2 – – 106.67 (7) N2–Ag1–P2 175.49 (17) – – N1–Ag1–O1W 95.27 (16) – – N1–Ag1–O2i – 95.6 (3) – P1–Ag1–O1W 95.40 (12) – – P1–Ag1–P2 – – 140.17 (3) N2–Ag2–P3 – – 112.39 (7) N2–Ag2–P4 – – 107.54 (7) P3–Ag2–P4 – – 139.59 (3) P1–Ag1–O2i – 108.37 (18) – Symmetry code: -x ? 1,-y ? 1, -z ? 1 Fig. 5 UV–vis spectra of complexes 1–4 (10 lM) in MeOH solution in the presence of increasing amounts of ﬁsh sperm DNA (0–100 lM).

As mentioned earlier, the complex contains a highly disordered water molecule, which was removed during the reﬁnement. The presence of the lattice water molecule is important for hydrogen bonding between the chains in 2, but the exclusion of the water molecule makes the dis- cussion of the crystal packing meaningless. However, it can be said that in addition to the possible hydrogen- bonding interactions involving the water molecules, the chains are connected by p(sac)p(sac) stacking interac- tions of 3.65 (1) A˚ (symmetry code 1 - x, -y, 1 - z) and the structure of 2 is further reinforced by C–Hp(dppe) and C–HO interactions, ranging from 3.00 (3) to 3.28 (2) A˚ . As shown in Fig. 4, complex 4 has two species in its asymmetric unit with a similar conformation. The struc- ture of 4 consists of polymeric chains of [Ag(sac)(l- dppb)]n, which are built up from the bridging of the sil- ver(I) ions by the dppb ligands (Fig. 4). The trigonal geometry around silver(I) is completed by the coordination of the sac ligand via the nitrogen atom. Although the synthesis of 4 is similar to that of 2, it has a different polymeric structure in which the bridging of sac is prob- ably avoided by the dppb ligand containing a much longer ethylene chain than those of dppe in 2. The Ag–N bond distances in Table 2 are similar to those of previously reported silver(I) complexes of sac [55–66]. On the other hand, the Ag–P bond distances are in the range from 2.4115 (8) to 2.4300 (8) A˚ , and are similar to those found in silver(I) complexes of dppb reported in [48, 49, 110, 111], but are noticeably longer than the corresponding bonds in silver(I) complexes containing dppb reported in [70, 112]. In addition, a few examples of silver(I) com- plexes of dppb with much longer Ag–P bond distances have also been reported [47, 84]. The polymeric chains of 4 are connected with each other by a number of weak C–HO [CO bond distance 3.32 (2) to 3.38 (3) A˚ ], and C–Hp [HCg bon distance 2.67 (2) to 2.96 (2) A˚ ] interactions in the solid state. DNA binding Electronic absorption titration is one of the commonest methods to investigate the interactions between metal complexes and DNA. The intense absorption band centered at approximately 260 nm was used to monitor the interac- tion of the silver(I) complexes with FS-DNA. The elec- tronic absorption spectra of complexes 1–4 in the absence and presence of increasing amounts of FS-DNA are shown in Fig. 5. The absorption band of DNA decreases in inten- sity with increasing DNA concentration. This is a typical ‘‘hypochromic effect,’’ suggesting that the complexes most likely bind to DNA through intercalation. The hypo- chromicity of complexes 1–4 is 33.3, 23.5, 32.1, and 28.8 %, respectively, at r = 0.3. The intrinsic binding constants (Kb) of the complexes determined from Eq. 1 are given in Table 3 and Fig. 5. The Kb values are in the range from 2.00 9 104 to 3.00 9 104 M-1 and suggest a signif- icant association of these complexes with FS-DNA. Com- plexes 1 and 3 exhibit the highest binding afﬁnity; however, the binding constants are much lower than that reported for the classic intercalator EB (Kb = 1.4 9 106 M-1) [113]. To further clarify the nature of the binding interactions between the silver(I) complexes and DNA, competitive binding experiments were performed. The studies involved the addition of the complexes to solutions of DNA pre- treated with EB, and then the measurement of the emission intensities of EB in the range from 600 to 620 nm. Fluo- rescence quenching of the EB–DNA complex in the pre- sence of a new molecule can be used to realize the binding mode of the molecule. The emission spectra of EB binding to FS-DNA in the absence and presence of complexes 1–4 are shown in Fig. 6. A reduction in the ﬂuorescence inten- sity is observed on the addition of the complexes to FS- DNA pretreated with EB. From the Stern–Volmer plots in Fig. 6, the quenching constants (KSV) of the complexes were calculated (Table 3). The KSV values indicate that complexes 1 and 4 exhibit greater quenching efﬁciency than Table 3 Quenching constant (KSV) and binding constants (Kapp and KA) for binding of complexes 1–4 and other compounds with ﬁsh sperm DNA Compounds KSV (9104 M-1) Kapp (9106 M-1) KA (9104 M-1) Number of binding sites per nucleotide Kb (9104 M-1) 1 1.85 ± 0.13 1.00 1.02 ± 0.24 1.01 2.86 ± 0.16 2 0.63 ± 0.14 –a 0.07 ± 0.02 1.40 2.50 ± 0.22 3 0.87 ± 0.13 –a 0.76 ± 0.06 1.04 3.00 ± 0.12 4 1.07 ± 0.21 –a 0.04 ± 0.02 1.47 2.00 ± 0.17 AgNO3 0.46 ± 0.01 –a 0.10 ± 0.07 1.20 0.83 ± 0.07 AgSD 1.97 ± 0.25 0.57 1.40 ± 0.22 1.02 3.75 ± 0.21 AgSD silver sulfadiazine a These values could not be determined because the corresponding compounds did not cause a 50 % reduction in the ﬂuorescence intensity of the ethidium bromide–DNA solutions J Biol Inorg Chem (2014) 19:29–44 39 123 the other complexes. The DNA binding constants (Kapp and KA) are listed in Table 3, and the corresponding plots obtained from the experimental quenching data are shown in Fig. 7. Kapp is the apparent binding constant and is based on the concentration of the complex that causes a 50 % reduction of the ﬂuorescence intensity of the EB–DNA adduct (Eq. 3), and KA is the intrinsic binding constant obtained from the ﬂuorescence quenching studies using Eq. 4. The Kapp values of complexes 2–4 and AgNO3 could not be determined, because increasing their concentrations did not cause a 50 % reduction in the ﬂuorescence intensity of the EB–DNA solutions. The interaction of complexes 1 and 3 results in the highest binding constants (KA), and this observation is consistent with the ﬁndings (Kb) obtained from the absorption studies, suggesting that complexes 1 and 3 strongly bind to FS-DNA by an intercalative mode. However, all binding constants for AgSD were higher than those for the silver(I) complexes. When a molecule binds to DNA it affects the size or shape of the DNA, and it will affect the electrophoretic mobility of DNA. The electrophoretic patterns of pBR322 plasmid DNA incubated with complexes 1–4 at various concentrations are shown in Fig. 8. The double-stranded plasmid pBR322 exists in a compact supercoiled conformation (form I), which has faster mobility compared with its closed circular (form II) and linear (form III) forms, resulting from the cleavage of one or two of the strands of the double helix. As shown in Fig. 8, complexes 2 and 4 do not have any impact on DNA mobility at the concentrations investigated, whereas com- plexes 1 and 3 exhibit noticeable retardation of the super- coiled DNA band with increasing complex concentration, indicating unwinding of the plasmid DNA owing to the binding of these complexes, since an intercalator is expected to unwind the DNA by lengthening and stiffening it [114].

AgNO3 and AgSD were used as reference silver(I) compounds for susceptibility testing. Three bac- terial species were used in this study. Among the bacterial species, E. coli (O157:H7) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (ATCC 33591) are considered to be two of the most virulent microorganisms for the human population. The effect of the solvent (DMSO) on bacterial growth was tested and was found to be negligible. Complex 4 is totally inactive, whereas the MICs of complexes 1–3 range from 15.9 to 116.4 lM. The highest antibacterial activity is observed for complex 1 against all bacterial strains, except for E. coli (ATCC 25922), compared with AgNO3 and AgSD (Table 4). Moreover, complex 3 also exhibits better activity against S. typhimurium and S. aureus than the antimicrobial agents and AgNO3, but it has less activity than AgSD and AgNO3 in the case of E. coli. On the other hand, complex 2 exhibits higher activity against S. ty- phimurium and S. aureus than the antimicrobials. The relatively high bacterial growth inhibition of these com- plexes is consistent with their DNA binding afﬁnities. Although silver(I) complexes with Ag–P bonds generally exhibit weak antibacterial activity [74, 115, 116], complex 1 may be a candidate for clinical applications after further tests. Cytotoxic activity We tested the in vitro cytotoxic activity of complexes 1–4 against two human cancer cell lines (A549 and MCF-7) and a normal cell line (WI-38). The IC50 values were determined from the dose dependence of surviving cells after exposure to the silver(I) complexes for 24, 48, and 72 h (Fig. 9). The inhibition of cell proliferation by the complexes after 72 h is presented in Table 5 and is com- pared with inhibition by AgNO3 and the clinically used anticancer agent cisplatin. The antigrowth effect of the complexes increases with increasing incubation time (Fig. 9). As shown in Table 5, the IC50 values of these complexes range from 0.74 to 86.40 lM and indicate that complexes 1 and 3 exhibit very high cytotoxic activity Table 4 Antibacterial activities (minimum inhibitory concentration, lM) of complexes 1–4 and other compounds Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) Escherichia coli (O157:H7) Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028) Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 33591) 1 15.9 15.9 31.9 15.9 15.9 2 116.4 116.4 58.2 58.2 58.2 3 32.3 32.3 32.3 32.3 32.3 4 C1,000 C1,000 C1,000 C1,000 C1,000 AgNO3 23.5 23.5 47.1 94.2 94.2 AgSD 22.4 22.4 44.8 22.4 22.4 Ciproﬂoxacin 0.05 96.6 772.6 772.6 772.6 Gentamicin 33.5 134.0 536.0 134.0 134.0 Fig. 8 Electrophoretic mobility of pBR322 plasmid DNA (10 lM) in the absence of the silver(I) complexes (lane 0) and in the presence of the silver(I) complexes (a 1, b 2, c 3, and d 4) at 10, 20, 50,and 100 lM (lanes 1–4) J Biol Inorg Chem (2014) 19:29–44 41 123 against all the cell lines, compared with AgNO3 and cis- platin. The high inhibition activity of these complexes is in accord with their relatively high propensity to bind DNA. Among the silver(I) complexes, complex 4 is the least active against the A549 cell line, whereas its antigrowth effect on MCF-7 cells is close to that of cisplatin. The IC50 values of cancer and control cell lines were found to be similar. Cytotoxicity in the WI-38 cell line was evaluated as untoward side effects. Only one report on the anticancer activity of cationic silver(I) complexes with diphosphane ligands, namely, [Ag(R2P(CH2)nPR2)2]NO3 (R is Ph or Et and n = 2), has appeared in the literature [117] and sig- niﬁcantly low IC50 values were reported for B16 melanoma cells. The anticancer activity of silver(I) complexes containing phosphane ligands has received less attention so far. The results of the present study indicate that further studies are warranted to assess their pharmacological properties and elucidate the actual mechanism of their biological activity. Conclusion Four new silver(I) complexes, [Ag2(sac)2(l-dppm)H2O] H2O (1), {[Ag2(l-sac)2(l-dppe)]3H2OCH2Cl2}n (2), [Ag2(l-sac)2(l-dppp)]n (3), and [Ag(sac)(l-dppb)]n (4), have been synthesized and fully characterized. The struc- tures of complexes 1, 2, and 4 were determined by X-ray diffraction. All phosphane ligands act as bridging ligands. The DNA binding afﬁnity of the complexes was studied by spectroscopic methods such as absorption and ﬂuorescence titrations. The results show that the complexes bind to DNA by intercalation. The binding of the complexes to the pBR322 plasmid DNA was further conﬁrmed by gel electrophoresis measurements. The biological activities of the silver(I) complexes were tested against ﬁve bacterial strains and two human cancer cell lines. Among the com- plexes, complex 1 exhibits powerful antibacterial activity against the licensed antimicrobials, being much more powerful than AgNO3 and AgSD. The cytotoxicity studies indicate that complexes 1 and 3 are very effective against Fig. 9 The antigrowth effect of complexes 1–4, AgNO3, and cisplatin on A549, MCF-7, and WI-38 cells treated with the compounds for 24, 48, and 72 h.

It may be concluded that the high antibacterial and anticancer activities of the silver(I) complexes correlate well with their DNA binding afﬁnities.
