Vittal2 Multiphoton upconversion is a process where two or more photons are absorbed simulta- neously to excite an electron to an excited state and, subsequently, the relaxation of electron gives rise to the emission of a photon with frequency greater than those of the absorbed photons. Materials possessing such property attracted attention due to applications in bio- logical imaging, photodynamic therapy, three-dimensional optical data storage, frequency- upconverted lasing and optical power limiting. Here we report four-photon upconversion in metal–organic frameworks containing the ligand, trans, trans-9,10-bis(4-pyridylethenyl)an- thracene. The ligand has a symmetrical acceptor–p–donor–p–acceptor structure and a singlet biradical electronic ground state, which boosted its multiphoton absorption cross-sections. We demonstrate that the upconversion efﬁciency can be enhanced by Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer within host–guest metal–organic frameworks consisting of encapsulated high quantum yielding guest molecules. Using these strategies, metal–organic framework mate- rials, which can exhibit frequency-upconverted photoluminescence excited by simultaneous multiphoton absorption, can be rationally designed and synthesized.

I n recent times, materials based on metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)1 have been extensively investigated as they hold the key for promising hybrid materials with unique properties. By taking advantage of the combined properties of the metal ions that connect the organic ligands, many functional materials suitable for gas sorption2, separation3, luminescence4, catalysis5, magnetism6 and conductivity7 can be constructed. Herein, we describe a new, previously unexplored feature of MOFs. Multiphoton harvesting (up to ﬁve photons) arose from the simultaneous absorption of multiple, identical and energized photons was observed for (E)-3-(4-(2-(1-hexyl-4-methyl-1H- imidazol-5-yl)vinyl)pyridinium-1-yl)propyl sulphate recently8. This is particularly an enticing property suitable for many diverse applications in optical limiting9, lasing10, optical data storage11 and high contrast bioimaging12. Compared with the lower-order nonlinear absorption, the ﬂuorescence excited by simultaneous four-photon absorption (4PA) in the short infrared wavelength would possess stronger spatial conﬁnement, larger penetration depth, improved sensitivity and resolution. There have been reports on frequency-upconverted ﬂuorescence from lanthanides13,14 and lanthanides-based MOFs15. However, the absorption and consequential photoluminescence response did not originate from the ligand in the framework but the lanthanide cation, thus restricting amenability to the metal ion. Furthermore, the lanthanide MOFs exhibit sequential stepwise multiphoton excitation but not simultaneous multiphoton absorption that enables higher contrast in bioimaging. By encapsulating suitable dyes in the solvent accessible void of MOFs, two-photon imaging16 and lasing17 were documented not long ago. Despite reports on two-photon-excited photoluminescence in zinc(II)-based metal–organic polymers18,19, the lack of solid-state structure and the difﬁculty in synthesizing the organic polymer constrained its tunability. In all, the predictability of structural property relationship in MOFs has drawn us to work on this project. It is important to differentiate this work from the second- harmonic generation reported for MOFs20. During the revision of this manuscript, Qian et al.21 reported the incorporation of a zwitterionic ligand into a MOF, which displayed two-photon- excited ﬂuorescence via the multivariate strategy. To rationally synthesize MOFs with multiphoton harvesting property, we select the ligand based on well-established guiding principles in the architecting of chromophoric ligands with large absorption cross- sections (sn). We successfully synthesized trans,trans-9, 10-bis (4-pyridylethenyl) anthracene (An2Py) ligand according to literature (see SI for details) and translated its multiphoton harvesting character into three MOFs. The choice of this organic ligand is based on the correlation between nonlinear optical (NLO) response and second hyperpolarizability (c). It has been shown that hyperpolarizability of organic compounds is dependent on several factors such as symmetrical conjugated substituted structure with general structure22 of donor–p– acceptor–p–donor (D–p–A–p–D) or acceptor–p–donor–p– acceptor (A–p–D–p–A) arrangement and a biradical ground state that can enhance c (refs 23–26). Furthermore, models on biradical systems supported that chromophores with a singlet biradical nature27–29 can contribute to an enhanced third-order NLO response. Hydrocarbons with an open-shell structure have also been demonstrated to yield an enhancement over the close-shell counterpart30. Here we successfully synthesized a MOF with multiphoton upconversion property (up to simultaneous absorption of four photons at 1,500 nm) by incorporating NLO active organic chromophores as ligands. We demonstrate that the solid-state multiphoton-excited photoluminescence (MEPL) of the MOF is enhanced compared with its organic ligand due to the rigidifying effect in the MOF. Moreover, we achieve further enhancement of the MEPL by encapsulating high quantum yielding guest molecules into the voids of the MOF, providing an additional synthetic possibility to amend the upconversion property. Such enhancement is believed to be caused by the Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the host MOF and the guest molecules. Our initial results suggest that utilizing the above two strategies could make MOF a promising efﬁcient frequency-upconverted luminescent material in the solid state. Results Synthesis and solid-state structures. The systematic solvother- mal synthesis of three isostructural zinc(II) MOFs with An2Py, trans,trans-4,40 stilbenedicarboxylic acid (H2SDC) and two guest molecules is carried out yielding [Zn2(SDC)2(An2Py)]  dimethyl formamide (DMF)  4H2O (1), [Zn2(SDC)2(An2Py)]  perylene (2) and [Zn2(SDC)2(An2Py)]  anthracene (3). Solid-state structures of 1–3 were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction tech- niques and their purities conﬁrmed by powder X-ray diffraction patterns (Supplementary Figs 1–4). Single crystal X-ray diffrac- tion studies revealed that 1 crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2/c with Z ¼ 4, whereas 2 and 3 crystallized in monoclinic space group P21/n with Z ¼ 2. Nonetheless, all the three MOFs shared the same fourfold interpenetrating pcu topology rendering them essentially analogous (Fig. 1a–c; (Supplementary Fig. 5). Their asymmetric units contain half the formula units and crys- tallographic inversion centres are present in the [Zn2(SDC)2] paddlewheel units and An2Py ligands. Each paddlewheel repeating unit is shared by four SDC ligands forming a (4,4) net in the (ı%01) plane. Each paddlewheel unit is further connected to each other by An2Py pillar ligands. 1 is assembled such that the anthracene moiety of An2Py is stacked alternating along the c axis with the closest edge to edge C28–C28 distance between the anthracenes to be 4.55 Å. As for 2, the tilting and p-stacking are similar to 3, but differing slightly from the vinyl C7 of the ligand to the centroid of the perylene guest distance, 3.48 Å. The anthracene guest molecules in 3 are p-stacked in between the An2Py along a axis and are tilted in the direction of (101) plane with a distance of 3.51 Å from the vinyl C23 of the ligand to the centroid of the guest. Topological study revealed that 3 is slightly compressed as compared with 1. This is reﬂected in the diagonal distances of the (4,4) plane (Zn???Zn, 27.43 and 20.78 Å in 1 and 30.48 and 16.02 Å in 3). Framework compression due to desolvation. On removal of the guest solvents, 1 does not retain single crystallinity and it slowly became powdery even on exposure to air. But the framework is still intact as the resultant powder remained insoluble in dime- thylsulphoxide. To further probe the structure, the guest solvents were fully removed from the framework by heating at 100 C for 2 h to obtain 1a and powder X-ray diffraction pattern revealed the formation of a new crystalline phase. This new phase, 1a is similar to that of the compressed framework of 3 on comparison. It is likely that such ﬂexible paddlewheel framework undergoes con- traction31 during the solvent removal. Hence, we simulate the crystal structure of the compressed framework, 1a by removing the anthracene guest and lowering the symmetry of crystal structure 3 to Pı%. Using total pattern analysis solution (TOPAS) (Supplementary Fig. 2), the powder data were reﬁned to reveal a new phase ascertaining the phase compression. Despite attempts to obtain 100% framework compressed phase, the framework absorbs moisture from the air to regain partially the original framework of 1. It was found that the powder used for subsequent analysis consists of 92.23% of the compressed phase (1a) and 7.77% of the original uncompressed phase (1).

The selective encapsulation of highly emissive perylene32 and anthracene33 in 1 resulted in 2 and 3. These guest molecules have emissions in the excitation region of 1, which makes FRET34 possible (Fig. 2). Furthermore, these aromatic hydrocarbons were also reported to have two-photon excitation ﬂuorescence35. The one-photon-excited photoluminescence studies were carried out before probing the MEPL (Supplementary Fig. 6). At 400-nm excitation, chloroform solution of An2Py displayed ﬂuorescence at 550 nm with quantum efﬁciency of 35.7% (Supplementary Fig. 7), while H2SDC afford signiﬁcantly lesser, 4.3%. The solid-state emission spectra of compound 1a revealed higher quantum efﬁciency (17.3%) compared with powdered An2Py (6.2 %) (Supplementary Fig. 7). This is due to the increased rigidity sustained by the MOF that minimizes non- radiative decay rate due to aggregation induced quenching of the ligand, contributing to the enhanced ﬂuorescence over the ligand itself. Moreover, the MOF emission proﬁle is similar to An2Py (Supplementary Fig. 8).

The quantum yield of 2 (25.4%) and 3 (26.2%) measured were found to be much better than 1a. The p–p stacking of the anthracene guest molecules (perylene in 2 and anthracene in 3) and An2Py brought them within close proximity at which FRET is allowed to occur. Furthermore, the spectra overlap of the guest emission and the excitation of the MOF suggested FRET occurred (Fig. 2). As a result, the emission of the guest molecules were quenched in 2 and 3 on excitation and a sole broad ﬂuorescence band of 570 nm appeared, validating the energy transfer that led to the emission enhancement. Multiphoton excitation photoluminescence. Femtosecond laser pulses (150 fs, 1 kHz repetition rate) with wavelengths ranging from 800 to 1,500 nm were subsequently used to study the MEPL at room temperature. The measurements were carried out by packing well powdered single crystals of the ligands and MOFs in a 1-mm-thick quartz cuvette (Supplementary Figs 10 and 11). Multiphoton action cross-section, which is the product of mul- tiphoton absorption cross-section (sn) and photoluminescence quantum yield (Z), is a direct measurement of the MEPL brightness. To determine the sn values of the investigated sam- ples, perylene, which shows two-photon emission on exciting with 800-nm laser beam, was utilized as a standard sample35,37. Photos in Fig. 1e clearly demonstrate the frequency upcon- verted photoluminescence when the MOFs are illuminated with near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses. The solid-state reﬂectance spectra of the compounds indicated absorption maxima at 400 nm (Supplementary Fig. 9). Correspondingly, the MEPL spectra of the MOF samples collected at 800 nm for two-photon absorption (2PA), 1,200 nm for three-photon absorption (3PA) and 1,500 nm for four-photon absorption (4PA) are displayed in Fig. 3. (Note: different samples have different molar concen- tration used for the determination of snZ as recorded in the Supplementary Table 1.) Excitation intensity dependence of the MEPL signal (shown in the inset of Fig. 3) further justify that 2PA, 3PA and 4PA are responsible for the excitation at 800, 1,200 and 1,500 nm, respectively. The same photoluminescence spectra proﬁle obtained regardless of a single-photon exitation, or multiphoton excitation (Supplementary Fig. 12), is indicative that the emission involves the same electronic state of the MOFs. Furthermore, the slopes indicative of the order of absorption process from the excitation intensity dependence of MEPL signals (An2Py and three MOFs) across different wavelengths were summarized in Fig. 4a. In the short-wavelength range from 800 to 900 nm, the slopes of photoluminescence from the samples are around 2, clearly indicating 2PA. 3PA processes with slopes increasing to around 3 appear to dominate as the excitation wavelength is increased from 950 to 1,400 nm. As excitation wavelengths are increased to the range from 1,450 to 1,500 nm, the slopes are around 4, signalling the dominance of 4PA processes. As for the co-ligand H2SDC, its one-photon absorption peak at around 384 nm. As such, the wavelength range in which the n-photon absorption process occurs differs from An2Py and the MOFs. 3PA ﬂuorescence is dominant in the wavelength range of 800–1,150 nm with slope 3. While at longer wave- lengths of 1,200–1,350 nm, a 4PA ﬂuorescence process occurred (Supplementary Fig. 11). Multiphoton action cross-section of the MOFs.

With several reasonable assumptions, the strength of the collected MEPL signal (Fn) can be obtained for 2PA, 3PA and 4PA processes, respectively. (Supplementary Figs 10 and 11) Utilizing perylene as a standard sample, the Zsn (n ¼ nth order photon absorption) values of the An2Py and MOFs were determined and shown in Fig. 4b–d, respectively. Here the experimental error results mainly from the uncertainty in ﬂuctuation of input laser pulse energy and determination of laser beam characteristics such as minimum beam waist and pulse duration. Discussion To demonstrate the amenability of the sn (n ¼ nth order photon absorption) in MOFs, the selective encapsulation of highly emissive perylene and anthracene in 1 was carried out, which resulted in 2 and 3. These guest molecules have high quantum efﬁciency and an emission in the excitation region of 1 that makes FRET possible (Fig. 2). The p–p interactions between the ligand and guest ensured the ease of host–guest formation during the synthesis without altering the interpenetration or topology. In addition, such aromatic hydrocarbons were reported previously to have two-photon excitation ﬂuorescence. The same photoluminescence spectra proﬁle obtained regardless of a single-photon excitation, or multiphoton excitation (Supplementary Fig. 12), is indicative that the emission involves the same electronic state of the MOFs. 400 600 800 Wavelength (nm) 104 a b c 103 103 103 102 102 102 Intensity (a.u.)

As depicted in Fig. 4b, 1a has larger 2PA action cross- section than An2Py, which is about three times greater. This difference can be mainly attributed to 1a possessing about three times higher ﬂuorescence quantum yield (17.3%) than An2Py (6.2%), as a result of the increased rigidity sustained by MOF. This trend is similar to the linear excited ﬂuorescence. Enhanced Zs2 observed in 2 and 3 came from FRET occurring between the encapsulated guests and the host MOF. Overall, the measured Zs2 is relatively small compared with the usual solution samples expected from laser dyes. This can be due to reabsorption and scattering effects of solid samples that is present during the collection process. In the wavelength range of the dominant 3PA process (950–1400 nm), a maximum Zs3 at 950 nm was revealed for all the samples and it decreases with increasing wavelength. The maximum Zs3 obtained among the compounds is (3.9±0.6)  10  79 cm6 s2 per photon2 for 3 at 950 nm. However, similar to 2PA, the Zs3 value could be underestimated with the measurement setup. Noteworthyly, this behaviour of Zs3 decreasing with the increasing wavelength is similar to typical semiconductor crystals. It is documented that 3PA coefﬁcient is a function of the photon energy as (3:o/Eg–1)5/2(3:o/Eg)  9, where Eg is the bandgap for the semiconductor crystals41. Strikingly, although 1a has almost the same s3 as that of An2Py, it demonstrates thrice as large ﬂuorescence (Zs3) than An2Py due to its three times higher ﬂuorescence quantum yield (Z). On a separate note, similar enhancements in Zs3 were obtained in 2 and 3 as a result of FRET between the host MOF and guest molecules perylene or anthracene. Four-photon process is further demonstrated at 1,450 and 1,500 nm, and similar trend to that of 2PA and 3PA were observed. Although it is underestimated, the maximum Zs4 obtained among the compounds is (5.7±0.8)  10  110 cm8 s3 per photon3 for 3 at 1,450 nm. Across all wavelengths, it is evident (Fig. 4) that 3 possessed the highest multiphoton action cross-section among the MOFs synthesized. This could be the better overlap of the anthracene emission with the MOF compared with the perylene guest. Nevertheless, 2 exhibited higher excited ﬂuorescence than 1a at all wavelengths due to FRET while the enhancement demonstrated by all the MOFs over the ligand is due to the rigidity sustained by the MOF framework. To investigate the open-shell character of the compounds, the solid-state electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to probe An2Py, H2SDC and the three MOFs (Supplementary Figs 13–17) for open-shell character. Indeed, the spectra revealed the presence of an isotropic radical signal with g-values at 2.00412, 2.00177, 2.00392, 2.00348 and 2.00424 for An2Py, H2SDC, 1a, 2 and 3, respectively. However, it is crucial to note that the signal from H2SDC is extremely weak compared with An2Py and MOFs. The g-values of the compounds are very close to 2.00232, which are for a free electron with no spin coupling. This conﬁrms that the open-shell character of An2Py has been incorporated into the MOFs as they present the same isotropic signal in their EPR spectra. Although both ligands seemed to contribute to the radical electronic state in the MOFs, it appeared that the contribution from An2Py is more signiﬁcant as judged by the more intense signal. The variable temperature EPR was carried out for An2Py and it showed a decreasing signal with decreasing temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 13b) indicating a singlet biradical ground state that is in equilibrium with a higher energy triplet biradical state42. Subsequently, multiconﬁguration calculations (see SI for details) suggested that An2Py should exist as a closed-shell 4 An2Py 1a 3 2 An2Py 1a 3 2 An2Py 1a 3 2 An2Py 1a 3 2 3 Slope 2 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 1,600 Wavelength (nm) 800 850 900 Wavelength (nm) 10 1 2PA 2 (GM) 1,000 900 1,200 1,100 1,400 1,300 Wavelength (nm) 1 0.01 0.1 3PA 3 (10–79 cm6 s2 photon–2) Wavelength (nm) 1,450 1,500 1 10 0.1 4PA 4 (10–110 cm8 s3 photon–3) a b c d Figure 4 | Multiphoton-excited ﬂuorescence action cross-sections for An2Py, 1a, 2 and 3.

We are able to locate an open-shell singlet state that is 165.8 kJ mol  1 higher in energy than a closed-shell singlet state. The triplet open-shell state is only 1.3 kJ mol  1 higher in energy than the open-shell singlet state. Interestingly, the chloroform solution of An2Py ligand is EPR silent (Supplementary Fig. 13c) and the 1H-NMR spectrum of An2Py ligand in CDCl3 solution is normal, neither broadened nor shifted due to paramagnetic nature. These results are consistent with the multireference calculations carried out for the individual molecules. However, the solid-state ligand exhibits an open-shell character contrary to the solution state. Hence, we attribute the behaviour of the ligand in the solid state to packing effect (‘crystal property’) as opposed to its molecular behaviour in solution. In the solid state, the crystal close packing often allows intermolecular interactions that lead to a different photolumines- cence proﬁle from the solution state. These intermolecular interactions are accountable for lower quantum efﬁciency, broadening and stoke shifts of the emission proﬁle43. As such, the ﬁndings of multiconﬁguration calculation cannot completely describe An2Py in the solid state but accurately for isolated single molecule. Nonetheless, the solid-state singlet open-shell character of An2Py was experimentally veriﬁed by the variable temperature EPR. In summary, usually multiphoton harvesting property exhib- ited by the organic molecules in the solution is quenched in the solid state due to aggregation. However, efﬁciently luminescent materials in the solid-state form are highly preferable in many photonic applications such as upconversion lasing and light emission due to a higher resistant to photobleaching. We demonstrated that MOFs with large NLO response can be designed by rational choice of ligands with high second hyperpolarizability (c). With both A–p–D–p–A structure and open-shell singlet character, An2Py displayed multiphoton- excited ﬂuorescence signal strong enough to be collected and characterized. The property was duly expressed in the MOF that formed. This shows a successful incorporation of a multi- photon-excited emissive organic chromophore into a MOF that resulted in solid-state MEPL. The rigidifying of the chromophore in the MOFs led to the enhancement in MEPL. Subsequent incorporation of suitable guests in the voids of 1a resulted in MOFs 2 and 3 and displayed enhancement due to FRET providing an additional synthetic possibility to amend the upconversion property. Methods Materials. Preparation of the ligand An2Py was according to reported procedures (see SI). Starting materials are purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals unless otherwise stated.

Yield: 53% Preparation of [Zn2(SDC)2(An2Py)]  anthracene (3): 2.2 mg (0.0125 mmol) of anthracene was weighed into a 25 -ml scintillating vial containing the chemicals from 1. Two days at 120 C followed by slow cooling yielded bright yellow plate- like crystals. Yield: 54% Optical measurements. One-photon-excited absorption and ﬂuorescence spectra for solution samples were acquired through utilizing an UV-1601 Shimadzu ultraviolet–visible spectrometer and a Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectro- photometer, respectively. One-photon-excited ﬂuorescence spectra for well powdered single crystals were collected by employing a Horiba Jobin-Yvon FluoroMax-4 Spectroﬂuorometer with appropriate sample holder at excitation wavelength of 400 nm. Excitation spectra of the well powdered single crystals were obtained in the same set-up at their peak emission wavelengths. Quantum yield measurements were performed using the absolute method on a ﬂuorescent spectrometer FSP920 from Edinburgh Instruments equipped with a BaSO4-coated integrating sphere, a xenon lamp and a photomultiplier tube detector. MEPL measurements were conducted using the following apparatus. The excitation laser pulses (1 kHz, 285–2,600 nm, pulse width o150 fs) were generated by an optical parametric ampliﬁer (TOPAS-C, Light-Conversion) pumped by a regenerative ampliﬁed femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser system (800 nm, 1 kHz, pulse energy 3 mJ, pulse width o150 fs, Libra, Coherent), which was seeded by a femtosecond Ti-saphhire oscillator (80 MHz, pulse width o100 fs, 800 nm, Vitesse TM 800-2, Coherent). The MEPL spectra of the excitation pulses were recorded with a spectrometer (Avaspec-2048-SPU, Resolution of 0.5 nm; see SI). The laser power was measured by an optical power meter (Optical power meter 1917-R, Newport) with the appropriate sensor. (Detector 919P-003-10, Newport). References 1.

Supplementary Fig. 11 shows the excitation intensity dependence of MEPL for all the compounds used. The slopes clearly indicate the occurrence of multi-photon absorption processes. As shown by Supplementary Fig. 12, the comparison between one- photon-excited and MEPL spectra indicates that the emission involves the same electronic state of the MOFs which is independent of the excitation wavelength. (Since the three-photon and four-photon excited PL signals are relatively weak and noisier, we have performed the average for every five sequential points for their PL spectra for better comparison.) It should be pointed out that our MEPL set up was calibrated by the measurements of third harmonic generation (THG) signals of a quartz plate, as displayed in Supplementary Fig. 25. Time- resolved measurements for the multi-photon fluorescence (two-photon shown here) were performed with the time-correlated single photon counting(TCSPC) technique utilizing femtosecond laser pulses excitation at 800 nm for An2Py, 1a, 2, 3 and at 650 nm for guest molecule anthracene, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 26. The measurement results reveal that the lifetimes of the investigated up-conversion fluorescence (or of the excited states) are several nanoseconds, and the FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) efficiency in compound 3 is E = 1- compound 3/Anthracene = 1- 1.67/3.96 ≈ 58%. Computational Methods – Multi-configurational Calculations of the Three Electronics States of An2Py There are three possible electronic states of An2Py (with Ci symmetry), namely 3Au, 1Au, and 1Ag, arising from two electrons occupying two orbitals, namely, Ag and Au (see Supplementary Fig. 27). We investigated the structures and energies of these three states using multi-configurational methods, which are expected to provide a proper description of the near degeneracy problem involved. Geometry optimizations were carried out with complete active space SCF (CASSCF)10 calculations with an active space involving two electrons and two orbitals (CASSCF(2,2)), using the 6-31G* basis set. The two active orbitals involved in these CASSCF calculations are Ag and Au (see Supplementary Fig. 27). Higher level relative energies were obtained through single-point calculations inclusion of dynamic electron correlation at second-order multi-reference perturbation (CASPT2)11 level, based on the CASSCF(2,2)/6-31G* optimized geometries. All multi-configurational calculations were performed using the MOLPRO program12. The optimized geometries are shown in Figure S28. Several structural features are worthwhile to note. Firstly, the torsional angle between the anthracene moiety and the main conjugated chain is significantly different for the three electronic states. This torsional angle is significantly smaller for the open-shell singlet (34.3°), compared to those in triplet (55.8°) and closed-shell singlet (78.0°). Secondly, the olefin double bond is significantly longer for the open-shell singlet state (1.356 Å, Figure S28). Thirdly, the central ring of the anthracene moiety is less aromatic in the triplet state. Our multi-configurational calculations clearly established that the closed-shell singlet 1Au state is the ground state of An2Py. Both the triplet (3Au) and open-shell singlet (1Ag) lie significantly higher in energies, by 167.1 and 165.8 kJ/mol, respectively. Interestingly, the open-shell singlet is slightly more stable than the triplet, by just 1.3 kJ/mol. In summary, the computational result is consistent with the solution-phase experiment, which did not show any EPR signal. Supplementary Methods Synthesis and Structural Characterization All the chemicals and solvents were of reagent or better grade and purchased from different commercial resources and used without further purification. An2Py and H2SDC were synthesized according to a reported procedure1-4. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were recorded on a D5005 Siemens X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at room temperature (298 K). 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz BrukerAvance 300 FT-NMR spectrometer by calibrating the residual solvent as the reference in D6-DMSO solution. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1, 1a and 3 were performed under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 5˚C min-1 on a TA instruments SDT-2960. Analysis was done in Universal V3.9A. TGA of 2 was obtained using Discovery TGA TA instrument under nitrogen gas flow with a heating rate of 5˚C min-1, and analysis was done with Trios V3.1. The C, H, N analysis were carried using ElementarVario Micro Cube instrument at the Elemental Analysis Lab, CMMAC, Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore. Continuous wave X-band EPR spectra were obtained with a JEOL JES-FA200 EPR spectrometer using MgO:Mn2+ marker The Mn marker consists of six Mn2+ signals which the third (2.034) and fourth (1.981) signals are calibrated to account for field variations. PXRD measurement for desolvated compound 1: The sample amount was too small for a large sample holder. A small amount of the sample was dispersed onto a low background sample holder (Si-crystal cut along (011) planes) and measured on a Bruker D8 diffractometer (Bruker-AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a Cu-Ka source, 2.5 degree soller slits, 0.5 degrees divergence slit, an air scattering screen and a gas-filled position sensitive detector. Further details are in the table below: TOPAS and Rietveld refinements Rietveld refinements with Topas Rietveld refinements were performed with Topas v4.2 (Bruker-AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). The main phase was D708 (desolvated compound 1). The analysis clearly showed that the symmetry was lowered to the triclinic space group P-1. Rigid body formalism was used to describe the movement of the large linker molecules. Preparation of the ligand An2Py: The 3 steps synthesis was according to reported procedures2-4. They are briefly mentioned below. 1) 1.78 g of anthracene was mixed with 3.56 g N-Bromosuccinimide, 0.16 g LiClO4 and 0.64 g SiO2 in 100 ml dichloromethane for 30 mins. The resulting yellow precipitate was filtered off and filtrate was washed with copious amount of water via separatory funnel. The washed organic layer was allowed to crystallize. Yellow needle-like crystals (9,10 dibromoanthracene-AnBr2) were formed. Yield = 99%. 2) 2.004 g of AnBr2 were mixed with 8.1 ml of 1.6 M nBuLi in dry ether at 0˚C for 2 h.

The orange precipitate (9,10-anthracenedicarbaldehyde-AnAd2) that ensued was filtered and used for the next step. Yield = 30%. 3) 0.468 g of AnAd2 was refluxed with 4.4 ml of 4-picoline in 5 ml of acetic anhydride for 12 h at 100˚C. The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for another 12 h.

Optical characterization with one-photon excitation Solution samples were diluted to 10-3 M or 10-4 M and the UV-vis absorption spectra was measured on UV-1601 Shimadzu UV-visible spectrometer. Solution fluorescence intensity measurements were performed using the Cary Eclipse Spectrophotometer with Cary WinFLR software at 350 nm excitation wavelength. Solid-state diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra were measured on UV-2450 Shimadzu UV-visible spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere and barium sulphate as reflecting reference. The solid-state absolute fluorescence quantum yields of the An2Py and 1a, 2, 3 were measured by a steady-state and phosphorescence lifetime spectrometer (FSP920, Edinburgh) coupled with an integrating sphere (150 mm; internally coated with barium sulphate) with the excitation at 400 nm. Using the same instrumental setup, the solution quantum efficiencies of An2Py (excited at 400 nm) and H2SDC (excited at 350 nm) were measured. All the measurements are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6-9, 24. Optical characterization with multi-photon excitation The multi-photon excited photoluminescence (MEPL) measurements were performed at room temperature in the wavelength range of 800-1500 nm. In these measurements, the excitation laser pulses (1 kHz, 285-2600 nm, pulse width < 150 fs) were generated by an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-C, Light-Conversion) pumped by a regenerative amplified femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser system (800nm, 1 kHz, pulse energy 3 mJ, pulse width < 150 fs, Libra, Coherent), which was seeded by a femtosecond Ti-saphhire oscillator (80 MHz, pulse width < 100 fs, 800 nm, VitesseTM 800-2, Coherent). The frequency up- converted PL spectra and THG of the excitation pulses were recorded with a spectrometer (Avaspec-2048-SPU, Resolution of 0.5 nm). The laser power was measured by an optical power meter (Optical power meter 1917-R, Newport) with the appropriate detector (Detector 919P-003-10, Newport). Mostly, MEPL are measured for solution samples contained in a 1-cm-thick quartz cuvette, where the incident laser beam can be focused into the middle part with small loss and the MEPL was collected in the perpendicular direction to the excitation beam. Different from this, our samples were compact solid powder and the interaction between incident laser beams and the powder samples mainly occurred on the surface with small interaction length. Therefore, we applied a slightly different experimental setup for measuring the MEPL of our powder samples, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 10. The incident laser pulses were focused by a lens (L1) with a focal length of 6 cm. The distance between the powder samples contained in a 1-mm-thick quartz cuvette and L1 was kept at 7.5 cm, in order to avoid the high excitation peak intensity on the samples. The spot size of the incident laser beam was controlled at 3 mm by the iris before L1. Incident angle between the incident laser beam and the sample plane was maintained at 45, and MEPL signal was collected in the perpendicular direction of the incident light using a collection system of two 10 cm focal length lenses (L2 and L3). The excitation laser beams were filtered out by a short-pass filter cut at 750 nm and the obtained pure MEPL signal was coupled into a spectrometer (Avaspec-2048-SPU, Resolution of 0.5 nm). As a calibration, a standard solid state sample, well grinded perylene single crystal, which shows two-photon excited fluorescence at 800 nm5-6, was employed in the same experimental set-up. Although our experimental set-up is slightly different from the normal one for solution samples, the applied relative measurement method utilizing a standard sample can give us reasonable and accurate results. Determination of the multi-photon absorption action cross-sections of the investigated samples. MEPL strength Fn can be obtained by integrating fn over the entire laser focused volume and time. fn is given by7-9: ( ) ( ) (1) The factor of 1/n accounts for the fact that n photons are absorbed from the near infrared (NIR) laser light for each fluorophore excitation generated. is the photon energy of the NIR incident laser beam. is the fluorescence collection efficiency of the experimental setup,  is the PL quantum yield, n is the multiphoton absorption cross-section,  is the sample molar concentration, ds dz is the small volume of the focused laser beam considered, and is the nearly constant laser intensity at this small volume. In our case, the sample is compact solid powder and the interaction length between incident laser beams and the sample will be small, therefore, we can reasonably assume this interaction length as small constant L0 and hence, Eq. (1) approximates to ( ) ( ) (2). Since the spatial profiles of the input laser pulses are Gaussian functions, the integration out of the beam radius region at the sample position are relative small compared to that within the beam radius and can be neglected. Under these approximations and with the assumption that the temporal profiles of the input laser pulses are also Gaussian function, the totally collected MEPL signal can be obtained by performing integration for (2) as follows. By defining that the directions of x and y axes are indicated as in the following diagram (y is in the direction perpendicular to the plane of paper and outward, O is the zero point), we have the laser beam intensity as:     2 2 2 1 2 00 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 1 ( cos( / 4)) / exp 1 ( cos( / 4)) / r x y t I I d x z w d x z                             where  is the pulse duration of the Gaussian laser pulse, is the peak intensity of the input laser pulse at the focal point, is the beam waist and is the diffraction length and d is the distance between the focal point of laser beam and the central point on the sample.
