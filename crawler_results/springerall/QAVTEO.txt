However, the rational design and syn- thesis of MOFs with unique structure and function still remain a long-term challenge. The resultant structural framework is frequently inﬂuenced by various factors such as medium, pH value of solution, temperature, the nature of metal ions, coordination geometry, and number of coordi- nation donors provided by organic ligands [9–14]. Gener- ally, polycarboxylate ligands feature prominently in the construction of coordination polymers, and the reported coordination polymers are mostly constructed by rigid polycarboxylate ligands. Recently, more and more atten- tion has been paid to the ﬂexible polycarboxylate ligands [15–17], but studies of semi-rigid V-shaped dicarboxylate ligands are relatively few [18, 19]. 4,40-Methylenediben- zoic acid is often used as the organic component in such framework compounds [20]. The relative positions of the carboxylic acid groups are directly dependent on the angle between the two phenyl rings which should give rise to a more ﬂexible coordination chemistry of this ligand. On the other hand, the employment of mixed ligands during the self-assembly process has gradually become an effective approach, which is expected to obtain frame- works with more diverse structural motifs compared to using only one type of ligands [21–23]. Therefore, the imidazole-containing ligands, for example, 1,4-di(1-imid- azolyl)benzene (dib) [24], 4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)- benzene (bix) [25], 1,4-bis(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-butane (bimb) [26], and 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-benzene (mbix) [27], can freely rotate to meet the requirement of coordi- nation geometries of metal ions in the assembly process. Syntheses of new imidazole ligands are still a long- standing fascination of chemists, and we have designed and synthesized a new V-shape imidazole ligand, 4,40- bis(imidazol-1-yl)diphenyl ether (BIDPE), which may be regarded as a semi-rigid ligand.

Herein, we present its synthesis, crystal structure, and magnetic properties. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Measurements All the reagents and solvents for syntheses and analyses were commercially available and used as received without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analyses were performed with a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. The IR spectra as a KBr disk were recorded on a Nicolet Avatar-360 FTIR spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a simultaneous SDT 2960 thermal analyzer under nitrogen ﬂow with a heating rate of 10 C min-1. Variable-temperature susceptibilities were measured using a MPMS-7 SQUID magnetometer. Diamagnetic correc- tions were made with Pascal’s constants for all constituent atoms [28]. 2.2 Synthesis of 4,40-Bis(Imidazol-1-yl)Diphenyl Ether (BIDPE) A mixture of Cu2O (1 mmol), 4,40-dibromodiphenyl ether (20 mmol), imidazole (80.0 mmol), and K2CO3 (40.0 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (60 mL) in a 150 mL three-necked round-bottom ﬂask under Ar was stirred at 150 C for 48 h. The reaction mixture was ﬁltered, and then the ﬁltrate was added into 200 mL of H2O. The precipitation was ﬁltered and washed with water and dried in vacuum. The crude product was recrystallized in EtOH to provide 4.4 g (73% yield) of the desired product as colorless crystals. Anal. Calcd. for C18H14N4O (%): C, 71.51; H, 4.67; N, 18.53.

The data were integrated by using the SAINT program [29], which also evaluated the intensities that were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effect. Absorption corrections were applied using multi-scan technique [30]. The struc- tures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-97 program [31] and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXL-97 program [32]. All of the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms except for those of water molecules were generated theoretically onto the speciﬁc atoms and reﬁned with isotropic thermal parameters riding on the parent atoms. The hydrogen atoms of water molecules were located with difference Fourier map. The detailed crystal- lographic data and structure reﬁnement parameters are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and bond angles () are listed in Table 2. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Crystal Structure of Complex 1 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that complex 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P21/c and features a one-dimensional chain structure based on triply bridged binuclear units. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the asymmetric unit of complex 1 contains two divalent nickel ions, two DBA dianions, two entire BIDPE mole- cules, and a ligated water molecule located on a crystal- lographic 2-fold axis. The nickel ion possesses a distorted [NiO4N2] octahedral coordination environment with a cis orientation of its nitrogen donors, which belong to two different BIDPE ligands. Bond lengths and angles about the nickel ion are standard for octahedral coordination (Table 2). Three of the oxygen donors belong to three different DBA anions, while the remaining coordination site is occupied by an aqua ligand. Each DBA anion serves as an exotridentate linker, connecting two nickel ions at one carboxylate terminus in a bis-bridging binding mode J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:258–263 259 123 with a third nickel ion via the other carboxylate locus in a monodentate binding mode. The aqua ligand serves to bridge two Ni ions in a l2-fashion; two Ni ions are in turn also bridged by two carboxylate termini from two different DBA anions to form a triply bridged binuclear unit. These have a Ni_Ni distance of 3.524 A˚ , with the two bridging carboxylate groups situated 44.42 apart. Individual binu- clear units are connected into a 1D [Ni2(DBA)2(BID- PE)2(l-H2O)]n chain motif, coursing along a-axis, by means of the monodentate carboxylate termini of the DBA anions (Fig. 2). The Ni_Ni contact distance through the full extent of the DBA dianionic tethers is 14.917 A˚ . The BIDPE ligands fosters a Ni_Ni distance of 14.936 A˚ . Adjacent [Ni2(DBA)2(BIDPE)2(l-H2O)]n chains are con- joined in the a and b crystal directions by intermolecular weak interactions to construct the 3D supramolecular net- work (Fig. 3). Complex 1 is different from [Ni(BIDPE)2 (5-OH-bdc)(H2O)33H2O] reported by Zheng et al. [33], which is cause by the ﬂexibility of the DBA ligand. 3.2 TGA TGA were carried out for the synthesized complex, and the results of the TGA are shown in Fig. 4. A weight loss of 1.50% below 150 C (calcd. 1.44%) was observed, due to the loss of coordinated water molecules. Further weight loss was found from ca. 290 C, due to the decomposition of the framework.

At room temperature, the vMT value is 2.45 cm3 K mol-1 and somewhat higher than that (2.0 cm3 K mol-1) expected for two magnetically isolated spin-only Ni(II) ions, indicating that the orbital contribution is incompletely quenched [34]. Upon cooling, the vMT values lightly decreases until 45 K Fig. 1 ORTEP representation of complex 1 (hydrogen atoms have been omitted for the sake of clarity). The thermal ellipsoids are drawn at 30% probability. Symmetry codes: #1: x, -y ? 1/2, z ? 1/2; #2: x, -y ? 1/2, z - 1/2 Fig. 2 View of 1D [Ni2(DBA)2(BIDPE)2(l-H2O)]n chain motif in 1 Fig. 3 Molecular packing diagram projected along a-axis in 1. Double-headed arrow lines represent weak p–p interactions J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:258–263 261 123 and below 45 K, the vMT value rapidly decreases on further cooling; while the vM increases gradually to 0.374 cm3 K mol-1 at 2 K. The general features of two curves (vM and vMT) are characteristic of intramolecular antiferro- magnetic coupling between nickel ions, which has been observed in the reported compounds [Ni(pdc)(4,40-bipy)]1/ 2MeOH (H2pdc = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylicacid) [35] and [Ni(tzda)(4,40-bipy)(H2O)]n [28]. A reported empirical formula for analyzing binuclear Ni(II) system is used to ﬁt magnetic susceptibility data [36]: vM ¼ Nb2g2 kT 2 exp x þ 10 exp 3x 1 þ 3 exp x þ 5 exp 3x   þ vT; where x ¼ J=kT Using this method, the best-ﬁt parameters for 1 are J = -2.13 cm-1, g = 2.19, vT = 5.8 9 10-4 cm3 mol-1 and R = 3.12 9 10-4. The negative value of J corrobo- rates the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling. As is well known, a plausible model of magnetic interactions can be made using orbital overlap arguments [37]. In 1, there are two pathways of magnetic interaction within the binuclear Ni(II) units from the structural point of view: the two carboxyl groups and one water bridge between two Ni(II) ions, thus small overlaps between the magnetic orbits of Ni(II) ions occurs, accounting for the weak antiferromag- netic coupling. 4 Supplementary Material Crystallographic data, excluding structure factors, for the structures reported in this study have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center as supple- mentary publication Nos.
