Keywords Zn(II) compound  4,40-oxydiphthalic acid  Topology  Luminescence 1 Introduction Crystal engineering of coordination polymers is of current research interest not only owing to their variable structural diversity but also owing to their potential applications in luminescence, catalysis, NLO, gas storage and separations [1–4]. Over the past few decades, mixed ligand self-assem- bly strategy has gradually become an effective approach, which is expected to fabricate frameworks with more diverse structural motifs compared to using only one type of ligands [5–12]. However, controllable synthesis of coordination polymers with desired frameworks remains a great challenge to chemists. Therefore, the selection of special organic ligands with appropriate shape, ﬂexibility and functionality together with metal ions is very important in the construction of target polymers [13, 14]. In addition, accurate control of the change of some external conditions (e.g., pH value, template, solvents, temperature, counterion, substitute group on the organic ligand, auxiliary ligand) in the self-assembly process is also very important [15, 16]. A series of variable frameworks via varying external conditions have been suc- cessfully obtained [17, 18]. Encouraged by previous inves- tigations, in this work we selected 4,40-oxydiphthalic acid as main ligand owing to its backbone ﬂexibility and versa- tile bridging modes, which will make the structures of their complexes more diversiform. By varying auxiliary ligands, two new Zn(II) coordination polymers; namely, [Zn(H2ODPT)(bpe)(H2O)]n (1) and [Zn(H2ODPT)(bpp)]n (2) (H4ODPT = 4,40-oxydiphthalic acid, bpe = 1,2-bis(4- pyridyl)-ethane, bpp = 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)-propane), which feature distinct topological frameworks, were obtained. 1 features a 3D extended framework, which can be simpliﬁed into a 4-connected cds topological net; 2 features a 2D lay- ered framework, which can be simpliﬁed into a 4-connected sql tetragonal plane net.

Element analyses (C, H and N) were determined with an elemental Vairo EL III analyzer. Infrared spectra using the KBr pellets were measured with a Nicolet Magna 750 FT-IR spectrometer from 400–4,000 cm-1. Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro powder diffrac- tometer with Cu/Ka radiation and 5 B 2h B 50. Fluo- rescence spectra of the solid samples were performed with an Edinburgh Analytical instrument FLS920. Single crystal X-ray diffraction was carried out using a Saturn724 dif- fractometer (Mo/Ka radiation, k = 0.71073 A˚ , graphite monochromator) at 293(2) K.) 2.2 Synthesis of Compomds 1 and 2 2.2.1 Synthesis of [Zn(H2ODPT)(bpe)(H2O)]n (1) Synthesis of 1: A mixture of Zn(NO3)26H2O (0.060 g, 0.20 mmol), H4ODPTA (0.060 g, 0.20 mmol) and bpe (0.037 g, 0.2 mmol), and H2O (12 mL) was placed in a 23 mL Teﬂon lined vessel. The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and then the mix- ture was sealed in a Parr autolave and kept at 160 C for 3 days. After slow cooling to room temperature, colorless prism crystals of 1 (0.027 g) were isolated. Yield: 45 % based on Zn(NO3)26H2O.

Empirical absorption corrections were applied to the data using the SADABS program [19]. The structures were solved by the direct method and reﬁned by the full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXL-97 program [20]. All non–hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically; and, all hydrogen atoms attached to carbon were placed at their ideal positions. The hydrogen atoms of coordinated water molecule for 1 were found from difference Fourier maps.

Selected bond lengths and angles for compounds 1 and 2 are listed in Tables 2 and 3. 3 Result and Discussion 3.1 Crystal Structure Description of 1 Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 features a extended 3D framework, which can be simpliﬁed into a 4-connected cds topological net. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one Zn(II) ion, half of H2ODPT2- ligand, half of bpe ligand and one coordinated water molecule. Each Zn ion locates at the core of an octahedral geometry with two sym- metry-related carboxylate oxygen atoms and two symmetry- related water ligands deﬁning the equatorial plane, and two symmetry-related nitrogen atoms occupying the axial sites (Fig. 1a). The Zn–O distances range from 2.072(3)– 2.2851(11) A˚ ; and, the Zn–N distance is 2.106(3) A˚ . These values are in accordance with previous reports [21]. In 1, the H4ODPT ligand deprotonates two protons into H2ODPT2-, and H2ODPT2- and thereby using its two deprotonated car- boxylate groups in uniform monodentate mode links two the Zn(II) ions. Adjacent Zn(II) ions are bis-bridged by one water molecule and one H2ODPT2- ligand; and, this bis-bridged mode further results in a 1D chain extending along crystal- lographical c axis (Fig. 1b). The adjacent 1D chains are connected by the bpe ligands to give rise to the ﬁnal 3D framework of 1. From the topology viewpoint, if the bis- bridge (bridged water molecules and H2ODPT2-) and bpe ligands may be viewed as linkers; and, the Zn(II) ion is reduced to a 4-connected node. This framework may be simpliﬁed into a 4-connected distorted cds net with the Schla¨ﬂi symbol, {65.8}. Although this cds net is based on one type of node, there are two types of linkers deﬁned by two different node–node distances (i.e., 4.4149 and 13.4839 A˚ ), which make the 4-connected planar node distorted from square-planarity causing a distorted cds network. 3.2 Crystal Structure Description of 2 A new framework 2 was obtained when bpe ligand was replaced by another bridged ligand under the same condi- tions. Single crystal X-ray analysis reveals that 2 is a 2D layer framework, which can be simpliﬁed into a 4-con- nected sql tetragonal plane net. There are one Zn(II) ion, one H2ODPT2- ligand and one bpp ligand in the asym- metric unit of 2. Each Zn(II) ions is tetrahedrally coordi- nated by two carboxylate O-atoms from two different H2ODPT2- ligands and two N-atoms from two different bpp ligands. The Zn–O and Zn–N distances range from 1.960(3)–2.103(5), 2.039(4)–2.043(4) A˚ , respectively, which are in the normal range (Fig. 2a) [21]. Like 1, H4ODPT ligand also deprotonates two protons to H2ODPT2-, and H2ODPT2- links two Zn(II) ions with two deprotonated carboxylate groups in uniform monodentate Table 3 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for 2 Zn(1)–O(1) 1.960(3) Zn(1)–N(2)a 2.039(4) Zn(1)–N(1) 2.043(4) Zn(1)–O(8)b 2.103(5) O(1)–Zn(1)–N(2)a 101.82(15) O(1)–Zn(1)–N(1) 118.78(17) N(2)a–Zn(1)–N(1) 109.01(16) O(1)–Zn(1)–O(8)b 97.65(16) N(2)a–Zn(1)–O(8)b 133.50(16) N(1)–Zn(1)–O(8)b 97.40(16) Symmetric code: a -1 ? x, y, z; b -0.5 ? x, 0.5 - y, -0.5 ? z Fig. 1 a View of the coordination environments of Zn(II) ions in 1 (Symmetry codes: (a) -x, -y, -z). b 1D chain motif constructed by bridged water molecule and H2ODPT. c Polyhedral representation of the 3D framework for 1. d Schematic representation of 4-connected cds topological net J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:485–490 487 123 mode. Therefore, Zn(II) ions are bridged by H2ODPT2- and bpp ligands, extending into a 2D layer framework along crystallographical ac plane (Fig. 2b). If each Zn(II) ions can be reduced into a 4-connected node; i.e., a 4-connected sql tetragonal plane net with Schla¨ﬂi symbol {44.62} (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, the parallel stacking of the layers results in a 3D supramolecular framework (Fig. 2d). This stacking is directed by the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the coordinated carboxylate groups and undeprotonated carboxylate groups from the adjacent lay- ers. The distances of OO range from 2.6242–2.6294 A˚ ; the O–HO angles range from 154.6–156.9, which are within the accepted values [22]. 3.3 Effect of N-Donor Ligands on the Frameworks of 1 and 2 The difference between 1 and 2 reveals that the second N- donor ligands are crucial to direct self-assembly of their frameworks. Although bpe and bpp adopt identical l2 bridging mode, they have different lengths of spacers and can adopt different conformation in the self-assembly process. In 1 and 2, H4ODPT deprotonate two protons to H2ODPT2-, which further connects Zn(II) ions into a 1D chain. For 1, these 1D chains are connected by bpe ligands in a trans-conformation from four different directions, thereby forming a 3D cds topological network. For 2, these 1D chains are connected by bpp ligands in cis-transfor- mation from two different directions, giving rise to a 2D sql tetragonal plane network. Therefore, the N-donor ligands may be regarded as the structure-directing agents. 3.4 PXRD Patterns and Thermal Analysis The experimental X-ray powder patterns for 1 and 2 are similar with the corresponding calculated X-ray powder diffraction patterns (Fig. 3a, b). The patterns support rea- sonable phase purities for 1 and 2. To evaluate the thermal behavior, thermal analysis of 1–2 were analyzed on poly- crystalline samples under a nitrogen atmosphere from 30 to 900 C (Fig. 3c, d). In the TGA of 1, the ﬁrst weight loss of 3.12 % from 90 to 100 C corresponds to the departure of one coordinated water molecules per unit cell (calcd: 2.95 %). The dehydrated sample of 1 is stable to 360 C. Above 360 C, a rapid and signiﬁcant weight loss occurs because of the decomposition of the organic ligands. The residue weight (obs. 13.39 %) corresponds to ZnO as the ﬁnal product (calcd. 13.28 %). For 2, no obvious weight loss was observed below 370 C. Above 370 C, 2 undergoes a rapid and signiﬁcant weight loss owing to the decomposition of organic ligands. The ﬁnal residue (obsd. 12.98 %) is ZnO powder (calcd. 13.32 %). 3.5 Luminescent Properties Excellent luminescent properties of coordination polymers with d10 metal centers have attracted interest because of their potential applications in chemical sensors, Fig. 2 a View of the coordination environment of Zn(II) ion in 2 (Symmetry codes: (a) -1 ? x, y, z; (b) -0.5 ? x, 0.5 - y, -0.5 ? z). b 2D layer framework for 2. c Schematic representation of 4-connected sql tetragonal plane net. d 3D supramolecualr framework for 2 (blue dotted lines: hydrogen bonds) 488 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:485–490 123 photochemistry and electroluminescent displays. The solid- state luminescence of 1 and 2 were investigated at ambient temperature (Fig. 4). Compound 1 exhibits a maximum emission at 440 nm upon excitation of 332 nm; 2 exhibits a maximum emission at 483 nm upon excitation of 335 nm. To ascertain these emission bands, the luminescent prop- erties of the free ligands were also investigated under the same conditions. Thus, H4ODPT shows a maximum emission at 376 nm (kex = 339 nm), bpp shows a weak broad emission band maximum at 515 nm (kex = 400 nm), and bpe does not exhibit luminescent emission in visible light. The emissions of H4ODPT and bpp may be assigned to p* ? n and p* ? p transitions of the intraligands. Since Zn(II) ions are difﬁcult to oxidize or reduce, the emission bands for 1 and 2 may originate from mixed ligand–ligand charge transition and intraligand charge transfer [23]. 4 Conclusions Two new Zn(II) coordination polymer with different topolo- gies were successfully synthesized by varying auxiliary ligands. The results suggest that N-donor ligands can play a structure-directing role in tuning different topological frameworks. In addition, the luminescent and thermal stabil- ities properties of these two compounds were investigated. 5 Supplementary Data CCDC Nos. 950664 and 950665 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.
