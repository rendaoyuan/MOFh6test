The structures of two compounds have been determined by single- crystal X-ray diffraction analyses and further characterized by IR spectrum, elemental analyses, powder X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. The compounds are iso- structural, conﬁrmed by their powder XRD measurements. They feature a pillared layered framework structures. Within the layer, the dinuclear [M2O2] units through the bridge of the coordination water molecule are found, which are connected by carboxylate groups along the a- and b-axis, respectively. The layers are further pillared by the pyridyl groups of the 2,5- PDC2- ligands. Furthermore, the luminescent properties of two compounds have also been investigated in the solid state. Keywords Coordination polymer  Alkaline–earth  Crystal structure  Luminescence 1 Introduction The rational design and assembly of coordination poly- mers (CPs) or metal–organic frameworks have received increasing attention in recent years owing to their intriguing architectures and topologies as well as potential applications in the areas of ion exchange, adsorption, magnetic materials and luminescence, and so on [1–9]. Generally, particular interest of many research works so far has been focused on the exploration of transition metal ions and rare-earth ions as coordination centers [10–14]. However, relatively less attention has been paid to the alkaline–earth metal CPs. Recently, more and more research attention of alkaline–earth metal coordination polymer materials have been developed by using the alkaline–earth metals, which feature various coordination modes and low polarizability [15]. Espe- cially, many studies on alkaline–earth metal compounds are meaningful to the interpretation of the biological functions and biochemical reactions with Ca(II) depen- dence, because the Ca(II) plays a key role in many above processes [16, 17]. On the other hand, the calcium-based porous CPs have been used to investigate the role of calcium in natural CO2 separation and storage [18]. Apart from metal centers, the rational choice of organic linkers is crucial for building CPs. Multicarboxylate ligands are widely popular for their diverse coordination modes and geometries. As a class of important multi- carboxylate ligands, pyridinedicarboxylate was used to synthesize a series of transition metal and lanthanide compounds, where diverse coordination abilities were observed [19–22]. As an extension of the research on CPs based on the alkaline–earth metals and the pyri- dinedicarboxylate, the 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylate (2,5- PDCH2) has been selected in this work to react with strontium and barium ions. Here we report the syntheses, crystal structures, thermal stabilities and luminescent properties of two pillared layered CPs [M(2,5-PDC) H2O]n [M(II) = Sr(1), Ba (2)].

Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were performed on a PE 240C elemental analyzer. IR spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4,000 cm-1 on a Nicolet iS10 spectrometer using KBr pellets. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed with a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA instrument in the range of 30–800 C under a nitrogen ﬂow at a heating rate of10 C/min. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Ka radiation (k = 1.54056 A˚ ). The luminescent spectra for polycrystalline samples were measured at room temperature on a Perkin Elmer LS 55 ﬂuorescence spec- trometer with a xenon arc lamp as the light source. 2.2 Experimental Section 2.2.1 Synthesis of [Sr(2,5-PDC)H2O]n (1) A mixture of Sr(NO3)2 (0.1050 g, 0.50 mmol), 2,5-PDAH2 (0.0835 g, 0.50 mmol) 2 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide, and 8 mL of H2O was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and then the mixture was sealed in a 25 mL Teﬂon-lined autoclave, which was heated at 110 C for 4 days. After being slowly cooled to room temperature, colorless prism crystals of 1 were collected by ﬁltration and washed by water for several times with a ﬁeld of 30 %. Elemental Anal.

A hemisphere of data were collected in the h range 3.38–26.00 for 1 and 3.28–26.00 for 2 using a narrow-frame method with scan widths of 0.30 in x and exposure time of 10 s/frame.

The data were inte- grated using the Siemens SAINT program [23], with the intensities corrected for Lorentz factor, polarization, air absorption, and absorption due to variation in the path length through the detector faceplate. Absorption cor- rections were applied. The structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-97 program [24] and reﬁned on F2 by full matrix least squares using SHELXL- 97 program [25]. All non-hydrogen atoms were located from the Fourier maps and reﬁned anisotropically. All the hydrogen atoms were put on calculated positions or located from the Fourier maps and reﬁned isotropically with the isotropic vibration parameters related to the non- H atom to which they are bonded.

The asymmetric unit consists of one Sr(II) ion, one 2,5- PDC2-, one coordination water molecule (Fig. 1). The Sr(II) ion in 1 is eight-coordinated with a distorted dodecahedral geometry. The eight positions are occupied by ﬁve carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O1A, O2F, O3C and O4D) from ﬁve equivalent 2,5-PDC2- ligands, the remaining three positions are provided by the pyridine nitrogen (N1) and two equivalent water molecules (O1 W and O1 WE). The Sr–O/N bond lengths fall in the range of 2.498(2)–2.856(2) A˚ , comparable with those observed in the other strontium carboxylate compounds [26]. The O–Sr–O bond angles are between 67.15(8) and 155.69(8). The 2,5-PDC2- ligand displays a hexadentate coordination Table 3 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for compound 2a a Symmetry codes: #1: x ? 1, y - 1, z; #2: -x, -y ? 1, -z ? 1: #3: -x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z; #4: -x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z ? 1; #5: -x, -y ? 1, -z; #6: -x ? 1, -y, -z ? 1; #7: x-1, y ? 1, z Ba(1)-O(2)#1 2.654(4) Ba(1)-O(1 W)#4 2.857(5) Ba(1)-O(1)#2 2.699(5) Ba(1)-O(1 W) 2.918(4) Ba(1)-O(1) 2.702(4) Ba(1)-N(1) 2.936(5) Ba(1)-O(3)#3 2.735(5) Ba(1)-O(4)#5 2.960(5) C(6)-O(1) 1.244(8) C(7)-O(3) 1.239(8) C(6)-O(2) 1.251(7) C(7)-O(4) 1.276(8) O(2)#1-Ba(1)-O(1)#2 110.47(15) O(2)#1-Ba(1)-N(1) 109.75(15) O(2)#1-Ba(1)-O(1) 143.73(16) O(1)#2-Ba(1)-N(1) 121.28(13) O(1)#2-Ba(1)-O(1) 64.54(16) O(1)-Ba(1)-N(1) 57.61(14) O(2)#1-Ba(1)-O(3)#3 76.16(16) O(3)#3-Ba(1)-N(1) 76.70(14) O(1)#2-Ba(1)-O(3)#3 153.95(17) O(1 W)#4-Ba(1)-N(1) 138.09(13) O(1)-Ba(1)-O(3)#3 125.20(15) O(1 W)-Ba(1)-N(1) 83.25(14) O(2)#1-Ba(1)-O(1 W)#4 81.81(14) O(2)#1-Ba(1)-O(4)#5 75.53(14) O(1)#2-Ba(1)-O(1 W)#4 88.56(14) O(1)#2-Ba(1)-O(4)#5 73.87(14) O(1)-Ba(1)-O(1 W)#4 131.65(15) O(1)-Ba(1)-O(4)#5 68.57(15) O(3)#3-Ba(1)-O(1 W)#4 67.02(14) O(3)#3-Ba(1)-O(4)#5 131.45(14) O(2)#1-Ba(1)-O(1 W) 149.06(14) O(1 W)#4-Ba(1)-O(4)#5 143.87(13) O(1)#2-Ba(1)-O(1 W) 83.52(15) O(1 W)-Ba(1)-O(4)#5 135.40(12) O(1)-Ba(1)-O(1 W) 67.05(14) N(1)-Ba(1)-O(4)#5 76.89(13) O(3)#3-Ba(1)-O(1 W) 80.04(15) Ba(1)#4-O(1 W)-Ba(1) 109.23(14) O(1 W)#4-Ba(1)-O(1 W) 70.77(14) Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for compound 1a a Symmetry codes: #1: -x ? 1, -y ? 2, -z ? 1; #2: x, y - 1, z; #3: -x, -y ? 2, -z; #4: -x ? 1, -y ? 2, -z; #5: -x, -y ? 2, -z ? 1; #6: x, y ? 1, z Sr(1)-N(1) 2.729(3) Sr(1)-O(1 W) 2.725(2) Sr(1)-O(1) 2.575(2) Sr(1)-O(2)#6 2.498(2) Sr(1)-O(1)#1 2.539(2) Sr(1)-O(1 W)#5 2.725(2) Sr(1)-O(3)#3 2.564(2) Sr(1)-O(4)#4 2.856(2) C(6)-O(1) 1.253(4) C(7)-O(3) 1.246(4) C(6)-O(2) 1.247(4) C(7)-O(4) 1.268(4) O(2)#6-Sr(1)-O(1)#1 103.55(7) O(2)#6-Sr(1)-N(1) 108.00(7) O(2)#6-Sr(1)-O(3)#3 77.47(8) O(1)#1-Sr(1)-N(1) 126.25(7) O(1)#1-Sr(1)-O(3)#3 155.69(8) O(3)#3-Sr(1)-N(1) 74.65(7) O(2)#6-Sr(1)-O(1) 143.13(8) O(1)-Sr(1)-N(1) 61.37(7) O(1)#1-Sr(1)-O(1) 67.15(8) O(1 W)#5-Sr(1)-N(1) 141.20(7) O(3)#3-Sr(1)-O(1) 126.04(7) O(1 W)-Sr(1)-N(1) 87.97(7) O(2)#6-Sr(1)-O(1 W)#5 81.35(7) O(2)#6-Sr(1)-O(4)#4 73.35(7) O(1)#1-Sr(1)-O(1 W)#5 85.22(7) O(1)#1-Sr(1)-O(4)#4 72.73(7) O(3)#3-Sr(1)-O(1 W)#5 70.82(7) O(3)#3-Sr(1)-O(4)#4 129.22(7) O(1)-Sr(1)-O(1 W)#5 130.37(7) O(1)-Sr(1)-O(4)#4 69.82(7) O(1 W)#5-Sr(1)-O(4)#4 140.93(7) N(1)-Sr(1)-O(4)#4 76.13(7) O(1 W)-Sr(1)-O(4)#4 140.18(7) Sr(1)#5-O(1 W)-Sr(1) 111.45(8) J Inorg Organomet Polym (2013) 23:1153–1158 1155 123 mode to chelate and bridge ﬁve Sr(II) ions through its one nitrogen and four oxygen atoms (Fig. 2a). The Sr1(II) and Sr1A(II) ions are connected by the coordination water molecules (O1 W and O1 WA) to be a dinuclear unit. The Sr1-O1 W-Sr1E bond angle and Sr1Sr1E distance are 111.454(9) and 4.5032(4) A˚ , respectively. The units are further connected by the car- boxylate (O–C–O) units, forming a chain running along the a axis. The neighboring chains are connected through the O–C–O bridges along the b axis, resulting in an undulating inorganic layer in the ab plane (Fig. 3). The Sr1Sr1F and Sr1ASr1E distances are 6.8344(7) and 6.4368(6) A˚ , respectively. The inorganic layers are pillared by the pyr- idyl groups of the ligands, with an interlayer distance of 8.3979(7) A˚ (Fig. 4). Compound 2 is isostructural to 1, conﬁrmed by their powder XRD patterns (Fig. S2). A pillared layered struc- ture is again observed where the undulating inorganic layers are separated by organic groups (Fig. S3, Fig. S4, and Fig. S5). The Ba–O/N distances are 2.654(4)– 2.960(5) A˚ . The Ba1Ba1D distance and Ba1-O1W-Ba1D angle over the l2-O1W bridge are 4.7082(7) A˚ and 109.226(16), respectively. The Ba1Ba1 along the a-axis and Ba1Ba1A along the b-axis distances are 6.7057(9) and 7.1179(10) A˚ , respectively. The interlayer distance is 8.3339(7) A˚ . It is worth mentioning the metal CPs incorporating 2,5- PDCH2 ligand are largely described. A few examples include transition metal, lanthanide and alkaline–earth metal compounds, a novel chiral two-dimensional (2D) layered compound [Co(PDC)(H2O)2H2O] [27], a three- dimensional (3D) structure compound [Co(PDC)(H2O)3 Fig. 1 Asymmetric building unit of 1 with the atomic labeling scheme (50 % probability).

Among the above compounds reported thus far, many exhibit 2D layered or 3D framework structures. In fact, the Sr (II) or Ba(II) ions in the two compounds adopt eight-coordinated with dis- torted dodecahedral geometries in accord with lanthanide compounds based on the same ligand. The structural dif- ferences between them could be attributed to the different building unit. In 1 and 2, an inorganic chain structures are formed through the O–C–O based on the dinuclear units [M2O2], and the inorganic layer are also linked the O–C–O, the layers are connected by pyridine groups resulting in a pillared-layered structure, while the 3D Ln(III) ions prefer different cluster structures resulting in 3D frameworks by the organic groups. 3.2 Thermal Analyses To characterize the thermal stabilities of two compounds, their thermal behaviors were investigated by TGA. The experiments are performed on the samples consisting of numerous single crystals of two compounds under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 C/min. As shown in Fig 5, compounds 1 and 2 show similar thermal behaviors. Compound 1 is stable up to about 240 C, above which the weight loss in the temperature range 240–310 C (6.73 %) corresponds to the release of one coordination water mole- cule (calc. 6.67 %). Above 310 C, a plateau is found until the burning of the compound occurs above ca. 500 C. For compound 2, the weight loss between 230 and 290 C (5.90 %) is attributed to the release of one coordination water molecule (calc. 5.63 %). The dehydrated sample keeps stable up to about 550 C, then the structure begins to collapse. 3.3 Luminescent Properties Luminescent CPs including alkaline–earth CPs are prom- ising candidates for photoactive materials with potential applications in ﬂuorescent sensors, nonlinear optics, pho- tocatalysis, displays, electroluminescent devices [9, 33–37]. The luminescent properties of 1 and 2 have been investi- gated in the solid-state at room temperature (Fig. 6). For the compounds, the strong emission bands are 552 nm (kex = 370 nm) for 1, 546 nm (kex = 370 nm) for 2, respectively. The comparison of the luminescent spectrum of the CPs with that of the free ligand enables us to examine how luminescent behavior changes with the structure. The free 2,5-PDCH2 ligand emits weak ﬂuorescence centered at 553 nm (kex = 370 nm). The luminescent behavior of free ligand could be probably assigned to p or n to p* orbital transitions. It is noteworthy that the emission bands of the compounds are similar to that of the free ligand. Therefore, these emission bands are neither ligand-to-metal charge transfer nor metal-to-ligand charge transfer, which could probably be attributed to the intraligand ﬂuorescent emis- sion [38]. 4 Conclusions In summary, two new alkaline–earth metal CPs, [M(2,5- PDC)H2O]n [M(II) = Sr(1), Ba(2)] have been synthesized utilizing the reactions of the 2,5-PDCH2 and corresponding metal ions. The two compounds were isostructural, and display a three-dimensional pillared layered structure. In Fig. 5 TGA curves for 1 and 2 Fig. 6 Emission spectrum of 1 and 2, and the free ligand 2,5-PDCH2 (L) in the solid-state at room temperature J Inorg Organomet Polym (2013) 23:1153–1158 1157 123 addition, the thermal stabilities and luminescent properties of compounds 1 and 2 were investigated in detail. The results demonstrate that pyridinedicarboxylate ligands may be a suitable efﬁcient building block in constructing alka- line–earth metal coordinations polymers with versatile architectures. Further work is in progress to explore other polymers materials based on the multicarboxylate ligands with interesting structures and functional properties.
