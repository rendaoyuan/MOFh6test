Manuscript Synthesis, structure and properties of a two-dimensional iron(II) metal-organic framework Mansheng Chen • Julan Zeng • Yifang Deng • Chunhua Zhang • Zhimin Chen • Daizhi Kuang Received: 18 February 2012 / Accepted: 11 April 2012 / Published online: 6 May 2012  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012 Abstract Reaction of FeSO47H2O with 5-(isonicoti- namido)isophthalic acid (H2INAIP) in the presence of NaOH results in the formation of a two-dimensional net- work [Fe(INAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2O. In the complex, each INAIP2- ligand links three Fe(II) atoms to give a double- chain structure using its two carboxylate groups in l1–g1:g1 and l2–g1:g1 coordination modes. The chains are inter- linked to form a layer structure through Fe–N interactions, which it is extended to a three-dimensional supramolecular structure by H-bonding interactions. The thermal and magnetic properties of the complex were investigated, and antiferromagnetic interactions were observed. Moreover, the adsorption behavior shows that the title complex has obviously selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 after the removal of the solvent molecules within the pores. Introduction In the past decades, much attention has been focused on the design and synthesis of coordination polymers, owing to their potential applications in gas separation and their interesting magnetic properties [1–12]. Many multi-carboxylate or heterocylic carboxylic acids have been used for this purpose. 3-and 4-pyridinecarboxylic and pyridinedicarboxylate anions have recently been found to act as excellent building blocks with multi-connecting ability in the construction of functional coordination polymers with porous, photoluminescent or magnetic properties [8–10]. Compared with the previously investigated pyridinecarboxylate ligands, 5-(isonicotinami- do)isophthalic acid (H2INAIP) has the advantage of multiple bridging moieties, which leads to a variety of connectivities for transition metal centers and provides various structural motifs [13–15]. In order to further investigate the inﬂuence of the organic ligand H2INAIP and different metal ions on the coordination architectures and related properties, in this contribution, we report the crystal structure and properties of a new 2D Fe-INAIP coordination polymer, namely [Fe(INAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2O. Experimental The reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. The IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vector22 FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr disks. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a TGA V5.1A Dupont 2100 instrument heating from room temperature to 700 C under N2 with a heating rate of 20 C/min. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were measured on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffractometer with CuKa (k = 1.5418 A˚ ) radiation at room temperature. Magnetic mea- surements in the range of 1.8–300 K were performed on a MPMS-SQUID magnetometer at a ﬁeld of 2 kOe on a crystalline sample in the temperature settle mode. All the M. Chen (&)  Y.

X-ray crystallography The X-ray diffraction measurement for the complex was carried out on a Rigaku RAXIS-RAPID imaging plate diffractometer at 200 K using graphite-monochromatized MoKa radiation (k = 0.71075 A˚ ). The structures were solved by Direct Methods using SIR92 [16] and expanded using Fourier techniques [17]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically by the full-matrix least- squares method on F2. The hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically. All calculations were carried out with the CRYSTALSTRUCTURE crystallographic software pack- age [18]. Details of the crystal parameters, data collection and reﬁnements are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. Results and discussion IR and crystal structures In the IR spectrum, the band at 3,418 cm-1 is due to the m(O– H) absorptions of water molecules. Strong absorptions at 1,626, 1,563 cm-1 [mas(COO-)] and 1,429, 1,397 cm-1 [ms(COO-)] are assigned to the carboxylate groups [19–21]. There is no obvious absorption at 1,700 cm-1, which clearly indicates the carboxylate groups of the ligand are entirely deprotonated in complex [Fe(INAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2O. The results of the structural analysis revealed that the complex has a 2D double-layer structure. The asymmetric unit of [Fe(I- NAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2O containsone Fe(II)atom,one INAIP2- ligand, a water ligand and two lattice water molecules. As shown in Fig. 1a, the Fe(II) atom is located in a distorted octahedral coordination environment; three O atoms and one N atom (O31, O32, O51B and N10C) are lying in the equa- torial plane and the O atoms (O10 and O52A) from aqua and INAIP2- ligands in the axial sites. Firstly, an inﬁnite double chain is built up by Fe(II) atoms and INAIP2- ligands through l2–g1:g1 and l1–g1:g1coordination modes of the carboxylate groups. Then, the adjacent double chains are interlinked by Fe–N interactions to form a 2D bilayer structure, as shown in Fig. 1b. A topological analysis was carried out to get an insight intothe structure ofthe complex.EachINAIP2- ligand is neighbored by four Fe(II) atoms and thus can be considered as a 4-connector. On the other hand, each Fe(II) atom links four INAIP2- ligands and can also be viewed as a 4-connector byomittingtheterminalwater ligandmolecule. Therefore,the ﬁnal topology of complex [Fe(INAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2O, cal- culated by TOPOS [22], is a uninodal 4-connected net with a Schla¨ﬂi symbol of (4363) (Fig. 1c), which is the same as that of {[Co(INAIP)(H2O)]2H2O}n, but is entirely different from complexes {[Mn(INAIP)(H2O)2]4H2O}n and [Ni(I- NAIP)(H2O)2]nnH2O [14, 15].

The hydrogen bonding data are summarized in Table 3. Thermogravimetric analyses, PXRD patterns and Gas Sorption The purity of the complex is conﬁrmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis, in which the experimental PXRD pattern is well consistent with the one obtained from the stimulated PXRD based on the single crystal samples at room temperature (Fig. 2a). The thermogravimetric analy- sis (TGA) reveals that there are two stages of weight loss in the temperature range of 25–700 C (Fig. 2b). The ﬁrst stage, occurring between 25 and 155 C, is attributed to the loss of two free and one coordinated water molecules per formula (observed weight loss, 13.73%; calcd., 13.70%). The weight is almost unchanged in the temperature range of 155–400 C. Above 400 C, the residue begins to decom- pose. This means that complex [Fe(INAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2O is stable up to the high temperature of 400 C. Before gas adsorption tests, activation to remove the guest molecules from the pores by heating under vacuum is a required pretreatment, and the as-synthesized crystal samples were heated at an optimized temperature of 120 C for 20 h. From the PXRD pattern, it was found that the framework of [Fe(INAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2O still has good crystallinity without solvent molecules, and thus, gas sorption was investigated. The N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms for the complex are shown in Fig. 3. The results indicate that almost no N2 uptake was observed at 77 K; however, it was found that signiﬁcant amounts of CO2 (195 K) were adsorbed, and the isotherm presents typical type-I curves [23–26], which is the characteristic of a microporous material. The amounts of CO2 uptake increase abruptly at the beginning and reach to 27.67 cm3 (STP)/g at 1.0 atom; for [Fe(INAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2O, approximately 0.26 CO2 molecules per formula unit were adsorbed, indi- cating a uniform microporous structure. It is noteworthy that no N2 was adsorbed in spite of the channel size being little smaller than the kinetic diameter of N2; therefore, the selective sorption of CO2 rather than N2 gas can mostly be attributed to the signiﬁcant quadrupole moment of CO2 (-1.4 9 10-39 C m2), which induces speciﬁc interactions with the host framework to the channels [27–29]. Magnetic properties of [Fe(INAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2O The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility was investigated from 300 to 1.8 K with an applied mag- netic ﬁeld of 2 kOe, and for the data obtained, diamagnetic corrections were carried out. The vMT versus T curve for [Fe(INAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2O is shown in Fig. 4. The value of vMT is 6.62 emu K mol-1 at 300 K, which is larger than the value of 6.0 emu K mol-1 expected for two magneti- cally independent Fe(II) (S = 2) centers, suggesting the presence of high spin Fe(II), which is typical for octahedral Fe(II) complexes [30]. The vMT decreases slowly and then more rapidly below 50 K to reach a value of 0.27 emu K mol-1 at 1.8 K. Such magnetic behavior indicates an antiferromagnetic coupling interaction, which mainly depends on the bridging carboxylate oxygen atoms in the [Fe(OCO)]2 dinuclear unit, and the spin coupling through INAIP2- ligands is negligible. The magnetic data can be ﬁtted by using the simple isotropic dimer model with a spin Hamiltonian H = -2JS1S2, where J is the coupling con- stant between the neighboring metal ions; the numerical expression is: Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles (deg) for [Fe(INAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2Oa Fe(1)–O(10) 2.1854(17) Fe(1)–O(32) 2.3433(15) Fe(1)–O(52)#1 2.0073(15) Fe(1)–N(10)#3 2.1637(17) Fe(1)–O(51)#2 2.1814(16) Fe(1)–O(31) 2.0830(17) O(52)#1–Fe(1)–O(31) 157.93(6) O(52)#1–Fe(1)–O(32) 99.14(6) O(52)#1–Fe(1)–N(10)#3 111.27(6) O(31)–Fe(1)–O(32) 59.15(5) O(31)–Fe(1)–N(10)#3 90.40(6) N(10)#3–Fe(1)–O(32) 149.54(6) O(52)#1–Fe(1)–O(51)#2 89.67(6) O(51)–Fe(1)–O(32) 88.71(6) O(31)–Fe(1)–O(10) 88.76(6) O(10)–Fe(1)–O(32) 88.06(6) O(52)#1–Fe(1)–O(10) 86.37(6) O(31)–Fe(1)–O(51)#2 93.47(6) N(10)#3–Fe(1)–O(10) 92.20(6) N(10)#3–Fe(1)–O(51) 92.87(6) O(51)#2–Fe(1)–O(10) 174.44(5) a Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms: #1 x, 1 ? y, z; #2 1 - x, 1 - y, -z; #3 1 ? x, 1 ? y, -1?z Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:463–468 465 123 vM ¼ Ng2b2 3kT  6e2J=kT þ 30e6J=kT þ 84e12J=kT þ 180e20J=kT 1 þ 3e2J=kT þ 5e6J=kT þ 7e12J=kT þ 9e20J=kT ¼ 2Ng2b2 kT  e2J=kT þ 5e6J=kT þ 14e12J=kT þ 30e20J=kT 1 þ 3e2J=kT þ 5e6J=kT þ 7e12J=kT þ 9e20J=kT Fitting the vMT versus T data to this model leads to g = 2.15, J = -1.99 cm-1 and the agreement factor R = P[(vMT)obsd–(vMT)calcd]2/P(vMT)obsd 2 is 2.2 9 10-3.

The results have revealed that unusual structures can be built by combining transition metals and pyridine-carboxylate ligands. The complex has also been characterized by IR spectroscopic, thermal gravimetric, magnetic measurements and gas sorption. And the experimental ﬁtting indicates that there are weak antiferromagnetic interactions between two high spin Fe(II) ions in [Fe(INAIP)(H2O)]n2nH2O.
