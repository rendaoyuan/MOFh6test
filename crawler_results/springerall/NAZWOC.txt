Manuscript Syntheses, Structures and Luminescent Properties of Three new Zinc(II) Complexes Constructed from Dicarboxylate and N-donor Coligands Ting Xue Received: 28 June 2011 / Accepted: 8 September 2011 / Published online: 17 September 2011  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract Three new metal coordination polymers, [Zn(oba)(bim)]n (1), [Zn(oba)(2,20-bipy)]n (2) and [Zn(o- ba)(pbim)]n (3) [H2oba = 2-(4-carboxyphenoxy)benzoic acid, bim = benzimidazole,2,20-bipy = 2,20-bipyridine and pbim = 2-(4-Pyridyl)benzimidazole], were synthesized and structurally characterized by elemental analysis, IR and X-ray diffraction. Compound 1 is a two-dimensional supramolecular framework, which is connected by one- dimensional chains through hydrogen bonding interactions. In compound 2, an alternate arrangement of the right- and left-handed helical chains through interchained p-p stacking interactions, formed a two-dimensional supramolecular framework. Compound 3 exhibited a 2D ? 3D interdigital architecture with side arms. In compounds 1, 2 and 3, the oba2- ligands act as bridging ligands exhibiting three coor- dination modes to link metal ions; i.e., bis-monodentate, bidentate chelating and monodentate modes. The lumines- cent properties of 1, 2 and 3, were also investigated.

The construction of metal—organic frameworks (MOFs) depends mainly on the nature of the organic and metal ions, which are key elements for building MOFs. Therefore, a considerable number of transition metal com- pounds with carboxylate ligands have been reported during thepastdecadebecause carboxylateligandsadopta variety of coordinationmodesthat result indiverse multidimensionality [20–29]. Most studies were focused on rigid carboxylate ligands [30–33]. Metal—organic polymers containing semi- rigid multicarboxylate have been less reported [34–36]. Semi-rigid V-shaped multicarboxylate ligands, which con- tain two benzene rings as a central molecular framework and bridged by a nonmetallic atom (C, O, S, or N atom), are excellent ligands. These ligands can freely twist around the nonmetallic atom to meet the requirements of the coordina- tion geometries of metal atoms in the assembly process. With this in mind, we chose 2-(4-carboxyphenoxy)benzoic acid as a ligand along with nitrogen-containing auxiliary ligands to construct new metal coordination polymers. In the present paper, three different coordination polymers, [Zn(oba) (bim)]n(1),[Zn(oba)(2,20-bipy)]n (2) and [Zn(oba)(pbim)]n (3), where H2oba = 2-(4-carboxyphenoxy)benzoic acid, bim = benzimidazole, 2,20-bipy = 2,20-bipyridine andpbim = 2-(4-pyridyl)benzimidazole], have been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Physical Measurements All reagents and solvents were commercially available and used as received without further puriﬁcation.

Selected bond and angle parameters are listed in Table 2. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Description of Crystal Structure 3.1.1 [Zn(oba)(bim)]n (1) The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of 1 reveals that each Zn(II) ion is square-pyramidally coordinated by four carboxylate groups at the basal positions [Zn—O, ranging from 2.019(1) to 2.110(2) A˚ ] and one bim mole- cule at the apical position [Zn-N, 2.004(2) A˚ ] (Fig. 1). Each pair of Zn(II) ions is bridged by four carboxylate groups, which generate a paddle-wheel second building unit (SBU). Two adjacent SBUs are interlinked via two different oba2- ligands to form 1D strands that can be described as double zigzag chains along the a axis. This structure is similar to the coordination environment observed in other reported mixed-ligand zinc-complexes [39] (Fig. 2). The Zn…Zn separation within the SBU is 3.006 A˚ . Two phenyl rings of oba2- ligand have a dihedral angle of 86.75. Strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the N–H groups of bim and O-atoms of oba2- are observed in 1 with an N…O distance of 2.842(2) A˚ (symmetry code: -x, 2-y, -z) and an angle of 157. The H-bonding leads to assembly and stabilization of the double-stranded chains into a 2D supramolecular structure (Fig. 3). 3.1.2 [Zn(oba)(2,20-bipy)] (2) In 2, the two ZnII ions show different coordination geome- tries (Fig. 4). The Zn1 center is coordinated by two O-atoms from two different oba2 ligands [Zn(1)-O(5) = 1.971(5) A˚ Table 2 Selected bond lengths (A˚ ) and angles () for complexes 1–3 Symmetry code for compounds: (1): (i) -x, -y, -z?1, (ii) -x?1, -y, -z?1, (iii) x-1, y, z; (2): (i) x, y-1, z; (3) : (i) -x-1/2, y?1/2, -z?1/2 Compound 1 Zn(1)—N(1) 2.004 (2) Zn(1)—O(4)ii 2.056 (2) Zn(1)—O(2)i 2.019 (1) Zn(1)—O(5)iii 2.110 (2) Zn(1)—O(1) 2.053 (1) N(1)—Zn(1)—O(2)i 107.67 (6) O(2)i—Zn(1)—O(4)ii 90.27 (6) N(1)—Zn(1)—O(1) 94.69 (6) O(1)—Zn(1)—O(4)ii 87.91 (6) O(2)i—Zn(1)—O(1) 157.48 (5) N(1)—Zn(1)—O(5)iii 99.73 (6) N(1)—Zn(1)—O(4)ii 101.32 (6) O(2)i—Zn(1)—O(5)iii 87.48 (6) O(4)ii—Zn(1)—O(5)iii 158.50 (5) O(1)—Zn(1)—O(5)iii 86.08 (5) Compound 2 Zn(1)—O(7) 1.935 (5) Zn(2)—O(1) 2.035 (5) Zn(1)—O(5v 1.971 (5) Zn(2—N(1) 2.075 (5) Zn(1)—N(3) 2.072 (5) Zn(2)—N(2) 2.105 (5) Zn(1)—N(4) 2.091 (5) Zn(2)—O(10)i 2.111 (4) Zn(2)—O(2) 2.342 (5) Zn(2)—O(9)i 2.203 (5) O(7)—Zn(1)—O(5) 112.5 (2) O(1)—Zn(2)—N(1) 98.8 (2) O(7)—Zn(1)—N(3) 131.3 (2) O(1)—Zn(2)—N(2) 111.2 (2) O(5)—Zn(1)—N(3) 97.6 (2) N(1)—Zn(2)—N(2) 78.2 (2) O(7)—Zn(1)—N(4) 102.8 (2) O(1)—Zn(2)—O(10)i 146.54 (18) O(5)—Zn(1)—N(4) 134.1 (2) N(1)—Zn(2)—O(10)i 105.71 (18) N(3)—Zn(1—N(4) 78.9 (2) N(2)—Zn(2)—O(10vi 96.05 (18) O(1)—Zn(2—O(9)i 94.6 (2) N(2)—Zn(2)—O(9)i 154.07 (19) N(1)—Zn(2—O(9)i 96.0 (2) O(10)i—Zn(2)—O(9)i 60.85 (17) O(1)—Zn(2—O(2) 59.09 (18) O(10)i—Zn(2)—O(2) 97.26 (17) N(1)—Zn(2—O(2) 156.85 (18) O(9)i—Zn(2)—O(2) 92.67 (17) N(2)—Zn(2—O(2) 102.50 (19) Compound 3 Zn(1)—O(1) 1.936 (3) Zn(1)—O(2) 1.969 (3) Zn(1)—O(5)i 1.945 (2) Zn(1)—N(1) 2.006 (3) O(1)—Zn(1)—O(5)i 118.42 (13) O(2)—Zn(1)—N(1) 97.78 (13) O(1)—Zn(1)—O(2) 118.31 (12) O(1)—Zn(1)—N(1) 99.34 (13) O(5)i—Zn(1)—O(2) 98.75 (11) O(5)i—Zn(1)—N(1) 123.64 (11) 388 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:386–394 123 and Zn(1)-O(7) = 1.935(5) A˚ ] and two N-atoms [Zn(1)- N(3) = 2.072(5) A˚ and Zn(1)- N(4) = 2.091(5) A˚ ] from one 2,20-bipy, showing a trigonal pyramidal geometry. Zn2 has octahedral coordination geometry. The Zn2-O bond distances range from 2.035(5) to 2.342(5) A˚ and the Zn2-N bond distances are 2.075(5)–2.105(5) A˚ . The oba2- ligands are l2-bridge, linking two Zn(II)-atoms through bidentate chelation and monodentate modes to form a 1D helical chain along the b-axis with a pitch of 14.316 A˚ . Two adjacent helical chains with different handedness are assembled by aromatic p-p stacking interactions of 2,20-bipy ligands to form a racemic 2D supramolecular network. The corre- sponding centroid-to-centroid distance is 3.816 A˚ , which is consistent with the value for reported Zn-carboxylate coor- dination polymers [40] (Fig. 5). 3.1.3 [Zn(oba)(pbim)]n (3) The X-ray crystal structure analysis of 3 reveals that it crystallizes in the monoclinic system, P2(1)/n space group. Fig. 3 Extended 2D supramolecular network interlinked by 1D chain through hydrogen bonding interactions Fig. 2 1D chain structure of 1(hydrogens are omitted for clarity) Fig. 1 Local coordination geometry of central Zn(II) with thermal ellipsoids drawn at 50% probability (hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity) J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:386–394 389 123 Each Zn(II) cation exhibits a distorted trigonal–bipyrami- dal geometry with an NO4 coordination sphere from three oba2- ligands and one pbim ligand (Fig. 6). The Zn–O bond lengths vary from 1.936(3) to 1.969(3) A˚ . The oba2- ligands are coordinated to Zn(II) in bidentate chelate and bis-monodentate modes. Adjacent Zn–Zn pairs are linked by two oba2- units to form an eight-member ring. The Zn– Zn separation in the ring is 3.687 A˚ . This connection motif is then propagated into a 2D coordination polymeric structure with simple (4,4) topology along the (100) plane. On the basis of connection modes, the Zn-atoms are linked by oba2- ligands to form left- and right-handed helical chains running along a crystallographic 21 axis in the b direction with a pitch of 11.309 A˚ (Fig. 7). This structure results from the ﬂexible and twisted skeleton of the oba2- ligands. The structure of 3 is similar to the polythreading net observed for [Zn(HL1)(4,4’-bpy)]n (L1 = 1,2,4- ben- zenetricarboxylate)) [41]. Remarkably, pbim has a monodentate coordination and hangs on both sides to the 2D layer as dangling ligands. This results in a 2D ? 3D polythreading motif (Fig. 8). 3.2 The Coordination Modes of oba2- and Neutral Ligands on the Framework It is well known that dicarboxylate ligands are good candi- dates for construction of coordination polymers due to their varied coordination modes. To design the target metal— organic networks, it is necessary to compare and compre- hend the coordination modes of the carboxylate ligand. There are three different coordination modes of the oba2- ligands in complexes 1, 2 and 3 (Scheme 1). In 1, two carboxylate groups of the oba2- adopt bis-monodentate coordination mode. The oba2- ligands assume a l4-bridging mode. In 2, the oba2- ligands adopt a l3-bridging mode with one carboxylate in a l1-g1:g1 bidentate chelating mode and Fig. 4 Coordination environment of the Zn(II) ions in 2 with thermal ellipsoids at 50% probability; (hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity) Fig. 5 The 2D supramolecular structure through p-p interceptions 390 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:386–394 123 the other in a l1-g1:g0 monodentae mode. In 3, two car- boxylate groups of the oba2- ligand adopt bis-monodentate and bidentate modes. The dihedral angles between two phenyl rings in the oba2- ligands of 1–3 are 86.75, 85.16 and 79.11, respectively. Clearly, the two benzene rings of the central molecular framework that is bridged by an O-atom can freely twist around the O-atom to meet the requirements of the coordination geometries. The secondary ligands also have a signiﬁcant effect on the construction of the frameworks. In 1–3, the structural differences are primarily affected by the introduction of secondary ligands. When bim and 2,20-bipy in introduced, 1 and 2 are a one-dimensional chain. When pbim is used, a 2D structure is obtained and a 2D ? 3D polythreading net is obtained. 3.3 Photoluminescent Properties Metal—organic coordination polymers with d10 metal centers (CdII, ZnII, CuI, AgI, HgII) have been investigated Fig. 6 View of the coordination environment of Zn(II) ion in 3 with thermal ellipsoids at 50% probability (hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity) Fig. 7 View of the right- and left-handed helical chains in bc plane for 3 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:386–394 391 123 for their photoluminescent properties and potential applications as ﬂuorescence emitting materials [42–45]. Therefore, the luminescent properties of H2oba, pbim, 1, 2 and 3 were investigated in the solid state at room temperature. Complexes 1, 2 and 3 exhibit strong ﬂuo- rescent emission bands with the maxima at 411, 456 and 484 nm upon excitation bands at 339, 395 and 397 nm, respectively (Fig. 9). Thus, all three complexes may be excellent candidates for blue-emitted photoactive mate- rials. To understand the nature of these emission bands, the emission spectra of the three compounds and those of free organic ligands were compared. H2oba exhibits a broad weak ﬂuorescent emission centered on 361 nm with an excitation maximum at 280 nm. which is attributable to the p*-n or p*-p transition (Fig. 10). Free bim, pbim, and 2,20-bipy display ﬂuorescent emis- sion bands at ca. 391, 386 and 530 nm, respectively [46– 48]. The blue shifts of the emission bands that occur in 1, 2 and 3 are probably due to the cooperative effects of intraligand emission and ligand-to-metal charge transfer [49–52]. 4 Conclusions Three Zn(II) coordination polymers were synthesized. The weak forces of inter-molecular hydrogen bonding interac- tions or p-p aromatic stacking interactions provide a 2D Fig. 8 Schematic illustration of the polythreading fashion for two adjacent layers Fig. 9 Solid-state photoluminescent spectra of 1, 2 and 3 at room temperature Scheme 1 The coordination modes of oba2- ligand in 1, 2 and 3 392 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2012) 22:386–394 123 supramolecular network for 1 and 2. Compound 3 exhibits a 2D ? 3D interdigital architecture with side arms. Fur- thermore, the solid state luminescent spectra demonstrate that 1, 2 and 3 may be good candidates for blue-light emitting materials. 5 Supplementary Materials Crystallographic data for the structural analysis have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, CCDC reference numbers : 788630,788631 and 808868.
