In complexes 1–3, the M2? ions linked three different Hnico ligand formed [M(Hnico)3]- subunit which further inter- linked the six-coordination M0? cation constructed 3D network. The network topology of 1–3 can be simpliﬁed a rare 3D (4,4)-connected (41263) net. Keywords Heterometallic polymer  Topology  Raman spectrum Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have raised an upsurge of interest in the ﬁelds of crystal engineering and functional materials, due to their intriguing structural features as well as desired properties, including sensor technology [1–3], separation processes [4–6], gas storage [7–11], lumines- cence [12, 13], ion exchange [14, 15], magnetism [16–20], and catalytic materials [21–23]. The rational design of speciﬁc complexes with a speciﬁed set of properties is still a challenge for chemists. One of these efforts has con- centrated on the controlling factors on the self-assemblies. For example, the selection of organic ligands as building spacers is a key point. On the other hand, the supramo- lecular interactions such as halogen–halogen interactions, hydrogen-bonding, p–p stacking, and metallophilic inter- actions also play the key roles in the recognition process forming ﬁnal three-dimensional architectures [24–26]. Careful selection of a suitable organic ligand with cer- tain features, such as versatile bonding modes and the ability to undergo supramolecular interaction, is helpful for constructing and tailoring metal–organic architectures with desirable properties [27, 28]. From the structural point of view, 2-hydroxy-nicotinic acid (H2nico) molecule pos- sesses three interesting characteristics: (1) as a multidentate and rigid ligand with multiproton acceptor–donor sites, the nico anion possesses one nitrogen atom of pyridine ring and three oxygen atoms of carboxylate groups and phenolic hydroxyl group, and might be utilized as versatile linker in constructing interesting coordination polymers with abun- dant hydrogen bonds and p–p stacking interactions; (2) the Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11224-010-9684-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

In fact, many studies about H2nico were focused on the transition metal coordination chemistry [29–34]. However, Alkali- and transition-metal heterometallic complexes with H2nico ligand have not been reported. Herein, we report the syn- thesis and crystal structures of three novel heterometallic coordination polymers named {M(Hnico)3M0}n (1, M = Co, M0 = K; 2, M = Ni, M0 = K; 3, M = Co, M0 = Na) which possess rare 41263 topology, as well as 22.6%, 22.1% and 20.4% porosity factor for 1–3, respectively. Experimental General methods Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed on a Perkin- Elmer 2400 II CHN elemental analyzer. FT/IR spectra were recorded in the range 4000–400 cm-1 on an Alpha Centaurt FT/IR spectrophotometer using a KBr pellet. Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw Plc Wotton under-edge UK (Single crystal sample) in the range 2000–200 cm-1. Thermogravimetric analyses were per- formed on Perkin-Elmer TGA7 instrument in ﬂowing N2 with a heating rate of 10 C min-1. All chemicals and solvents were commercially available and used as received without further puriﬁcation. Synthesis Preparation of 1: An ethanol solution (4 mL) of H2nico (0.148 g, 1.2 mmol), KOH (0.056 g, 1 mmol) was added to a water solution (4 mL) of Co(Ac)24H2O (0.099 g, 0.4 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 15 min. The mix- ture was placed in a 15-mL Teﬂon-lined autoclave and heated at 160 C for 120 h. The autoclave was cooled and 1 as red block crystals were collected by ﬁltration, washed with ethanol, and dried in air. Phase-pure crystals of 1 were obtained by manual separation.

Structure determination Single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses of the three compounds were carried out on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochro- mated Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) by using x - h scan technique at 298 K. Raw frame data were integrated Scheme 1 Various coordination modes of the nico ligand in its metal complex: a g1:g1:g2:l3-O; b g2:g2:g2:g1:l4-O,N; c g2:g1:l2-O; d g1:g1:l1-O; e g1:g2:g2:g1:l3-O,N; f g1:g1:l2-O; g g1:g1:g1:l2-O,N; h monodentate 136 Struct Chem (2011) 22:135–140 123 with the SAINT program [35]. The structures were solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97 and reﬁned by full- matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELXS-97 [36]. The empirical absorption correction was applied with the pro- gram SADABS [37]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were set in the cal- culated positions and reﬁned by a riding mode. The crys- tallographic details are provided in Table 1, while the selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 2. Crystallographic data for the structural analysis have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Cen- ter. CCDC reference numbers for 1–3 are 752967, 752966 and 752965, respectively. Results and discussion Crystal structures of 1–3 The three compounds are practically identical (Table 1), differing by the nature of the alkali ions and transition metal ions (K?, Co2? (1), K?, Ni2?

Herein, the Hnico ligand displays the l4:g2:g1:g1 coordination mode (Scheme 1a). To our best knowledge, seven coordination modes of the 2-hydroxy-nicotinic acid ligand have been reported (Scheme 1b–h) [29–34]; its unusual tetradentate l4:g2:g1:g1 coordination mode in 1 (Scheme 1a) has not been reported, where the proton is transferred from the phenolate hydroxy group to the nitrogen atom of pyridine ring [38]. Each coordination anion [Co(Hnico)3]- regard- ing as a metal complex ligand displays the sixdentate l6:g3:g1:g1:g1 coordination mode which linked four K ion. Each K ion forms [KO6] octahedral geometry completed by three phenolato oxygen and three carboxyl group from six Hnico ligands (Fig. 1). The K1–O3 bonds are 2.733 A˚ for 1 and 2.737 A˚ for 2 which are markedly narrower than the K–O distances of potassium complexes (K–O distances range from 2.617 to 3.230 A˚ ) [39, 40]; but K1–O2 distances are 2.572 A˚ for 1 and 2.579 A˚ for 2 went beyond the range of the K–O distances which are the shortest K–O distances till today [39, 40]. The complexes further constructed 3D network, while the alkali and transition metal ions located in right line in the c direction (Fig. 2) and formed 3D porous compounds with 22.6%, 22.1%, and 20.4% porosity factor for 1–3, respectively (Fig. S1). A closer look at the environment of the K ions in 1 and 2 is presented in Fig. 1 and shows up to six of the KH distances in 1 and 2 (Table 3) are within the range of agnostic interaction from 3.292 to 3.380 A˚ for 1, 3.239 to 3.341 A˚ for 2 (commonly discussed close HK contacts of about 2.99–3.42 A˚ [39]). The network topology of 1–3 can be simpliﬁed by considering just the alkali and transition metal ions which linked phenolic hydroxyl group by as a single node Fig. 1 Molecules structure of a complex 1, b complex 2, c complex 3. Part hydrogen atoms were omitted. The dashed line indicates the interaction between alkali metal and transition metal Fig. 2 3D network of complexes 1–3 along c direction Table 3 List of HM0 distances (A˚ ) in 1–3 1 CoK 2 NiK 3 CoNa H1M0 3.292(2) 3.239(1) 3.242(1) H3M0 3.380(2) 3.341(2) 3.253(2) 1 M0 = K, 2 M0 = K, 3 M0 = Na 138 Struct Chem (2011) 22:135–140 123 (represented by a octahedral node), and carboxylate groups (represented by a line (grey line)). A topological analysis of this net was performed with OLEX [41]. The resulting nets, shown in Fig. 3, is a rare 3D topology (41263) net. IR spectrum IR spectrum of 1 (Fig. S2) shows a strong band at 3445 cm-1 assigned to N–H from Hnico ligand which suggested that the proton is transferred from the carboxyl acid group to the nitrogen atom of imine pyridine ring. 1384 and 1464 cm-1 are assigned to msCOO- and masCOO-, respectively [26]. The strong band located at 1104 cm-1 is assigned to C–O from Hnico ligand. At very low frequen- cies (500–450 cm-1), a weak band at 492 cm-1 is observed from Co–O; bands from Co–N and Co–O stretching vibrations are usually observed around or below 400 cm-1. Raman spectrum Raman spectrum of complexes 1 (a line), 2 (b line) and 3 (c line) in the frequency region (200–2000 cm-1) is shown in Fig. 4. The relative strong bands at 663, 845, 913, 1086, 1145, 1234, 1313, 1378, 1461, 1558, and 1655 cm-1 are observed when excited with the line at 514 nm. The observation of new band at about 415, 442, and 569 cm-1 in the spectrum of complex indicated the formation of M–O band. Unfortunately, much vibrational modes of M–O were not detected because of the low sensitivity and technique difﬁculty in the very low frequency region. For the six-membered ring, its stretching vibrational mode is at about 913 cm-1. The COO- symmetric and asymmetric stretching mode at 1461 and 1558 cm-1, respectively, and the 1655 cm-1 is assigned to C=O stretching. Both the 1086 cm-1 band (C–COO- stretching motions) and the 1145 cm-1 band (C–C stretching) are relatively strong in Raman [42]. The C=N of the six-membered ring symmetric and asymmetric stretching mode at 1234 and 1313 cm-1, respectively, are very strong in the spectrum [43]. Thermal decomposition In order to examine the thermal stability of the polymers, thermal gravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analyses (DTA) of 2 were carried out for compound 2 between 25 and 650 C in the ﬂowing atmosphere of N2 and the heating rate with 10 C min-1 (Fig. S3). The TG curve of 2 indicates that compound 2 is stable up to 265 C at which temperature it begins to decompose. The TG curve of compound 2 indicates the release of carboxyl group of Hnico ligand takes place at 265–353.9 C (observed 24.85%, calcd. 25.77%). The solid residue formed at around 353.9 C further was decomposed between 353.9 and 654 C and release the pyridine ring of the Hnico ligand with two exothermic effects. The last solid residue formed is suggested to be KO2NiO. Conclusions In conclusion, three novel heterometallic microporous coordination polymers have been successfully synthesized from a conventional synthesis method and their single- crystal structure was determined. The combination of nickel or cobalt and alkali metal ions, as well as a special ligand Hnico, is a good strategy for obtaining novel ‘‘heterometallic polymer’’ systems.
