Manuscript Syntheses and Crystal Structures of Di- and Trimethyltin Carboxylates: Ladders and 1D Zig–Zag Chains Polymers Ru-Fen Zhang • Bao-Ying Zhang • Yun Ren • Chun-Lin Ma Received: 12 April 2011 / Accepted: 11 August 2011 / Published online: 23 August 2011  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract A series of organotin(IV) carboxylates com- plexes; namely, [(Me2Sn)4O2(RCOO)4] (R = C12H15 1, C9H11 2, C8H8ClO 3, C7H9 4) and [Me3(RCOO)]n (R = C12H15 5, C9H11 6, C8H8ClO 7, C7H9 8) have been syn- thesized. All complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, and NMR (1H, 13C and 119Sn) spectros- copy. Among them, the structures of complexes 1–3 and 5–8 were also determined by X-ray crystallography. The structural analysis showed that complexes 1–3 are the same tetranuclear monomer, and complexes 5–8 are the same 1D zigzag chain coordination polymer. Furthermore, each complex 1, 2 and 3, can form a supramolecular chain through weak intermolecular interactions. Keywords Organotin (IV)  Carboxylic acids and carboxylate complexes  Ladder structures  1D zigzag chain polymer 1 Introduction During the past few decades, research on the synthesis and characterization of coordination polymers has intrigued scientists not only for their fascinating structures but also for their potential applications [1, 2]. It has become apparent that coordination polymers may be prepared by the appropriate selection of a metal and multifunctional ligands [3, 4]. Among these materials, organotin(IV) car- boxylate complexes have been actively investigated by a large number of researchers due to their signiﬁcant reduction in tumor growth rates [5], interesting topologies and various structural types including monomers, dimers, tetramers, oligomeric ladders and hexameric drums [3]. Recently, a number of polymeric organotin complexes have been synthesized; e.g., a 3D supramolecular coordi- nation polymer containing organotin copper cyanide quinoxaline [6] and a series of tributyltin(IV) complexes based on 4-[((E)-1-{2-hydroxy-5-[(E)-2-(aryl)-1-diazenyl] phenyl}methylidene)-amino]benzoates acid [7] have been reported. In our previous work, we reported a series of organo- tin(IV) carboxylates complexes using carboxylic acid ligands such as phenylsuccinic acid, 5-mercapto-1(H)-tet- razoleacetic acid and 6-chloro-3-pyridineacetic acid [8–10]. In this study, a-phenlycycloclopentylacetic acid, 2-phen- ylbutyric acid, 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid and 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid was chosen as ligands. Eight organotin (IV) carboxylates complexes were obtained and were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR and NMR (1H, 13C and 119Sn) spectroscopy. The structures of all but 4 were determined by X-ray crystallography. 2 Experimental Details 2.1 Materials and Measurements Trimethyltin(IV) chloride, dimethyltin(IV) dichloride and the four carboxylic acids were purchased from Alfa Aesar and were used without further puriﬁcation. The melting points were obtained with an X-4 digital micro-melting R.-F. Zhang  B.-Y. Zhang  Y. Ren  C.-L.

Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet-5700 spectrophotometer using KBr discs. 1H, 13C and 119Sn NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Mercury Plus 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to tetra- methylsilane (TMS, external) for 1H and 13C NMR and tetramethyltin for 119Sn NMR. 13C spectra are broadband proton decoupled. Elemental analyses were performed with a PE-2400II apparatus. 2.2 Synthesis of Complexes 1–8 2.2.1 Synthesis of Complex 1 The a-phenylcyclopentylacetic acid (0.10 g, 1.0 mmol) and sodium ethoxide (0.068 g, 1.0 mmol) were added to the solution of methanol in a Schlenk ﬂask and stirred for 30-min. Dimethyltin dichloride (0.220 g, 1.0 mmol) was added, the reaction mixture was stirred for 12-h at 45 C and then ﬁltered. The solvent in the ﬁlter was gradually removed by evaporation under vacuum until solid product was obtained. The solid was recrystallized from ether to give transparent colorless crystals. 2.2.2 Synthesis of Complexes 2–4 The synthetic procedure is similar 1. The acid (1.0 mmol), sodium ethoxide (0.068 g, 1.0 mmol) and dimethyltin dichloride (0.220 g, 1.0 mmol) were reacted for 12-h at 45 C. 2.2.3 Synthesis of Complexes 5–8 The synthetic procedure is similar to 1. The acid (1.0 mmol), sodium ethoxide (0.068 g, 1.0 mmol) and trimethyltin chloride (0.199 g, 1.0 mmol) were reacted for 12-h at 45 C. The properties of 1–8 are list in Table 1. The IR and NMR data for 1–8 are list in Tables 2 and 3. 2.3 X-Ray Crystal Structure Diffraction data were collected on a Smart CCD area- detector with graphite monochromated Mo–Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). A semi-empirical absorption correction was applied to the data. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 and reﬁned against F2 by full matrix least-squares using SHELXL-97. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions. Crystal data and experimental details of the structure determinations are listed in Tables 4 and 5. 3 Results and Discussion The synthesis of complexes 1–8 is summarized in Scheme 1. The IR spectra of 2–8 are summarized in Table 2. The strong absorption in the 439–499 cm-1 region, which is absent in the free carboxylate moiety, is assigned to the Sn–O stretching mode. These values are consistent with other organotin(IV)derivatives[11–13].Thebroadbandfrom602to 640 cm-1 for 1–4 is assigned to the m(Sn–O–Sn) mode [14].

The Dm (Dm = m(COO)mas - m (COO)ms) values for complexes 1–4 are 244–265 and 182–207 cm-1; for 5–8 Dm is 188–207 cm-1. When these values are compared to those for the corresponding sodium salts, it is clear that the coordination mode for the carboxylate group in 5–8 is bidentate, and for 1–4 is both bidentate and monodentate. The conclusions drawn from the IR data are consistent well with the X-ray crystallography study (see below). The NMR spectra of 1–8 are summarized in Table 3. The 1H NMR spectra show the expected integration and peak multiplicities. In the spectrum of the free ligand, the resonance observed at about 10.50 ppm, which is absent in the complexes, indicates the formation of Sn–O in the complexes. This conclusion is consistent with the IR data and the X-ray crystal structure. The 1H NMR spectra also show that the methyl groups in the complexes occur from 0.51 to 0.91 ppm. In the 13C NMR spectra, the position of the carboxylate carbon moved to the lower ﬁeld relative to the free ligands. This indicates participation of the carboxylic group in coordination to tin [16]. The chemical shifts fall within the normal range of ﬁve-coordinated tin complexes [17] and overall six-coordination. These results too are consistent well with the X-ray crystal structures. The 119Sn NMR chemical shifts appear to depend not only on coordination number, but also on the type of donor atoms bonds to the metal ion [15]. 119Sn NMR chemical shift values may be used to give tentative indications of the environment around Sn-atoms. Holee˘ek et al. [18] have suggested that chemical shifts in solution for four-coordinated tin occur from ?200 to -60; for ﬁve-coordinated tin, from -90 to -190; for six-coordinated tin, from -210 to -400 ppm. The 119Sn NMR spectrum of complexes 1–4 exhibits two signals, suggesting there are either ﬁve- or six-coordinated Sn-atoms in the distannoxane. There is only one signal in the 119Sn NMR spectrum of complexes 5–8, which is typical for ﬁve-coordinated species [19]. 3.1 Description of Crystal Structures 3.1.1 Crystal Structures of Complexes 1–3 The molecular structures of 1–3 are shown in Figs. 1a, 2a and 3a.

For example, 1 is a tetranu- clear centro-symmetric dimer of an oxoditin unit having a central four-member ring composed of Sn(2)–O(5)–Sn(2A)– O(5A). In this complex, the central Sn2O2 core is fused with two four-member and two six-member rings. The four- member rings; i.e., [Sn2O2, i.e., O(3)–Sn(1)–O(5)–Sn(2A) and O(3A)–Sn(1A)–O(5A)–Sn(2)], are due to the bridging of the monodentate ligand through O-atoms, O(3)–Sn(2A) and O(3A)–Sn(2), respectively. Although the Sn(2)–O(3) distances (2.60 A˚ ) do not fall within the expected range for signiﬁcant bonding interactions between these atoms, they are signiﬁcantly shorter than sum of the Van der Waals’ radii for these atoms (3.68 A˚ ). If these weaker interactions are taken into consideration, the geometry around endocyclic Sn-atoms looks like skew trapezoidal with three Sn–O bonds and two Sn–C covalent interactions. The sixth position is occupied by a weaker Sn–O interaction. The axial C–Sn–C angle [C(18)–Sn(2)–C(18A) = 150.2(11)] deviates from ideal (180) and shows that adequate space is available for equatorial ligands to coordinate to the metal atom. Two six- member rings [Sn2O3C; i.e., Sn(1)–O(1)–C(1)–O(2)–Sn(2)– O(5), Sn(1A)–O(1A)–C(1A)–O(2A)–Sn(2A)–O(5A)] also overlap central Sn2O2.

The C–Sn–C angles around endocyclic [C(17)–Sn(1)–C(17A) = 146.5(9)] and exocyclic tin [C(18)–Sn(2)–C(18A) = 150.2(11)] atoms show that the distortion around the endocyclic tin atoms is relatively shorter than exocyclic tin atoms. It is worth mentioning here that there appears to be weak intermolecular SnO or C–HO interactions in 1–3. Nevertheless, through weak intermolecular interactions, 1–3 can form a supramolecular chainlike structure (vide the Figs. 1b, 2b and 3b). 3.1.2 Crystal Structures of Complexes 5–8 The molecular structures and 1D inﬁnite chain structures of 5–8 are illustrated in Figs. 4, 5, 6 and 7. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 7. Complex 6 has been previously reported [21]; it will not be described here. As seen in Figs. 4, 5, 6 and 7, the largest class of compounds of general formula [Me3Sn(O2CR0)] are best described as trans-R3SnO2 type [22, 23]. These structures are polymeric with association via the bridging carboxylate ligands. The Sn-atoms in these structures exist in distorted trigonal bipyramidal environments with the three organo substituents deﬁning the trigonal planes so that the C3Sn groups are very nearly planar The average angle of the plane is about 358.7. The two carboxylic atoms occupy the axial positions. It is noteworthy that there is constancy in the repeat distance of the polymers, which are invariably aligned along a crystallographic unit-cell edge such that the average repeat distance is 5.2(3) A˚ per monomeric entity. Furthermore, the polymeric structures are propagated along a crystallographic axis. In the remaining structures, a zig– zag array is aligned along a mirror plane [24]. 4 Conclusion Eight di- and triorganotin carboxylic complexes were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically and by X-ray crystallography. Complexes 1–4 are monomers. Species 5–8 have 1D zigzag chains structures.
