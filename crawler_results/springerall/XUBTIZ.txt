Manuscript Synthesis and characterization of three cobalt(II) coordination polymers with tetrabromoterephthalic acid and ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) ligands Huan Huan Li • Yan Jie Ma • Yan Qin Zhao • Guang Hua Cui Received: 9 August 2014 / Accepted: 18 September 2014 / Published online: 4 October 2014  Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014 Abstract Three cobalt(II) coordination polymers, namely {[Co(tbta)(pbdmbm)]0.5H2O}n (1), [Co(tbta)(bbdmbm) (H2O)2]n (2), and [Co(tbta)(bbbm)]n (3), have been hydrothermally synthesized by self-assembly of cobalt(II) nitrate with tetrabromoterephthalic acid (H2tbta) and three ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) ligands, respectively, 1,10-(1,4- butanediyl)bis-1H-benzimidazole (bbbm), 1,10-(1,3-pro- panediyl)bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole) (pbdmbm), and 1,10-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole) (bbdmbm). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 1 has a 1D ladder-like chain structure, while both complexes 2 and 3 feature a uninodal 2D (4, 4) layer structure with a {44.62}-sql topology. Additionally, the ﬂuorescence properties and catalytic activities of the complexes for degradation of congo red by a Fenton-like process were investigated. Introduction In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in the crystal engineering of metal–organic coordination polymers (MOCPs), not only due to their intriguing architectures but also owing to their potential applications in photolumines- cence, catalysis, gas storage, adsorption, and magnetism [1– 3]. Mixed-ligand assembly systems have gradually proven to be an effective synthetic strategy to construct interesting MOCPs [4–6], and the selection of organic spacer ligand is undoubtedly the main factor in their judicious design [7, 8]. A large number of fascinating organic ligands, especially those involving multidentate N/O-donor linkers, have been utilized in mixed-ligand assembly systems to build MOCPs [9–13]. In particular, ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) deriva- tives, as a class of classic N-containing organic linkers, have been well used in the construction of MOCPs, since they can satisfy the coordination needs of metal centers by freely rotating and bending their –CH2– groups [14–19]. In addi- tion, aromatic dicarboxylates have proved to be excellent co- ligands, owing to their versatile coordination modes and remarkable coordination ability [20, 21]. However, related dicarboxyl ligands with inert halogen groups have rarely been applied in the rational design of MOCPs to date [22, 23]. In this work, we selected tetrabromoterephthalic acid (H2tbta) as the main ligand. Three Co(II) coordination polymers, namely {[Co(tbta)(pbdmbm)]0.5H2O}n (1), [Co(tbta)(bbdmbm)(H2O)2]n (2), and [Co(tbta)(bbbm)]n (3) (bbbm = 1,10-(1,4-butanediyl)bis-1H-benzimidazole, pbdmbm = 1,10-(1,3-propanediyl)bis(5,6-dimethylbenzim- idazole), bbdmbm = 1,10-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(5,6-dimeth- ylbenzimidazole) (Scheme 1), were hydrothermally synthesized, and the inﬂuences of ﬂexibility and spacer length of these neutral bis(benzimidazole)-based neutral ligands on the structures of their cobalt complexes have been investigated. Furthermore, the ﬂuorescence properties and catalytic performances of the title complexes for the degra- dation of congo red in a Fenton-like process have been reported. Experimental All reagents and solvents for syntheses were commercially available and used without further puriﬁcation. The free ligands pbdmbm, bbdmbm, and bbbm (see Scheme 1) were H. H. Li  Y. J.

Elemental anal- yses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C automatic analyzer. IR spectra were taken on a Nicolet FT-IR Avatar 360 spectrophotometer in the 4,000–400 cm-1 region (KBr pellets). The thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were recorded on a NETZSCH TG 209 thermal analyzer from room temperature to 800 C under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 C/min. Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Synthesis of complex 1 A mixture of CoCl26H2O (24 mg, 0.1 mmol), pbdmbm (33 mg, 0.1 mmol), H2tbta (48 mg, 0.1 mmol), and H2O (10 mL) was stirred for 20 min at room temperature and then transferred to a 25 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel, which was heated at 150 C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 C /h.

Catalytic experiments The heterogeneous catalytic performances of complexes 1–3, which did not dissolve in the catalytic solutions, but remained as a solid suspension, were investigated for degradation of congo red at 40 C. A reaction mixture containing 30% H2O2 (2 mL) and congo red aqueous solution (20 mg/L, 200 mL) was placed in a 500 ml bea- ker, and then, 15 mg CoCl26H2O or complex 1–3 was added. All the complexes are powders and are ground up to a uniform particle size with 60–80 mesh. The solution is taken out from the reactor at desired time intervals and was centrifuged. The centrifugate was analyzed by UV–Vis spectroscopy using Shanghai Jingke UV765 spectropho- tometer at 496 nm. This procedure was also done in the absence of catalyst as a control experiment under the same conditions.

X-ray crystallography The crystallographic data for single crystals of the three com- plexes were collected at 293 K on an Bruker Smart 1000 CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.7103 A˚ )byx-2hscanmode.Allabsorptioncorrections were applied using the SADABS program [26]. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned on F2 by full-matrix least-squares techniques using the Bruker SHELXTL program package [27]. All the non-hydrogen atoms were treated aniso- tropically, and hydrogen atoms of the ligands were placed in geometrically idealized positions and reﬁned isotropically. Hydrogen atoms of coordinated water molecules for 2 were located in a difference Fourier map. The crystallographic data for the complexes are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths for all three complexes are listed in Table 2. Results and discussion Syntheses Hydrothermal reaction is an effective and powerful method in the construction of crystals, due to the simplicity, mild conditions, low aggregation, and high crystallinity [28, 29]. The reaction of H2tbta and ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) ligands with CoCl26H2O generated nameless precipitates using convention methods, whereas with the application of hydrothermal method, desirable compounds were prepared. Additionally, in order to investigate the inﬂuence of bis(benzimidazole) ligands on the structure of compounds, bbdmbm and bbbm were used to replace pbdmbm under the same reaction conditions, and three cobalt(II) com- pounds 1–3 were synthesized by varying the molar ratio and composition of the initial reactants, the solvent amount, reaction time, and temperature. The obtained samples were suitable characterized by X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis.

Structures of the complexes Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of complex 1 {[Co(tbta)(pbdmbm)]0.5H2O}n reveals that it crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1. The asymmetric unit is composed of one crystallographically independent cobalt center, one dianionic tbta ligand, one pbdmbm ligand, and half of one lattice water molecule. As displayed in Fig. 1a, each cobalt center is tetra-coordinated by two oxygen atoms (O1A and O4, symmetry code: A = -x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z ? 1) from the carboxyl groups of two differ- ent tbta2- ligands and two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N3B, symmetry code: B = x ? 1, y, z) from two pbdmbm ligands, forming a distorted trigonal pyramidal geometry. The Co–O and Co–N distances are in the ranges of 1.939 (6) - 1.997 (5) and 2.021 (6) - 2.029 (6) A˚ , respectively. Both Co–N and Co–O bond lengths are well matched to those observed in similar complexes [30, 31]. The O–Co–O angle is 105.8 (2) and the N–Co–N angle is 111.3 (3), while the O–Co–N angles are in the range of 97.9 (2) - 122.0 (3). The distortion of the geometry can be indi- cated by the calculated value of the s4 parameter being 0.87 (for ideal trigonal pyramid s4 = 0.85), according to the geometry of a four-coordinate metal system introduced by Houser [32]. In complex 1, the anionic tbta2- ligands display biden- tate bridging l2 - g1, g1 coordination and connect the neighboring cobalt centers, giving dinuclear [Co2(tbta)2] units, In which the planes of the benzene rings in the two tbta2- ligands are parallel. The adjacent [Co2(tbta)2] units are further linked by pbdmbm ligands adopting bis- monodentate mode along the b direction to form a 1D ladder-like chain with the CoCo distances being 8.28 (2) A˚ (Co1Co1B) and 10.06 (3) A˚ (Co1Co1C) (sym- metry code: C: x - 1, y, z; Fig. 1b).

Complex 2 [Co(tbta)(bbdmbm)(H2O)2]n is a coordina- tion polymer that crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. The asymmetric unit is made up of one cobalt center, one tbta2- ligand, one bbdmbm ligand, and two- coordinated water ligands. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the cobalt center exhibits a slightly distorted octahedral geometry coordinated by two-coordinated water molecules (O1W and O1WB) and two nitrogen atoms (N1, N1A) from two different bbdmbm ligands comprising the equa- torial plane, plus two oxygen atoms (O2 and O2A) (sym- metry codes: A= -x ? 1, y, -z ? 3/2, B: -x ? 3/2, -y ? 1/2, -z ? 1) from two distinct tbta2- ligands loca- ted in the axial sites with the O2–Co1–O2A angle being 176.23 (8). The Co1–N1 and Co1–N1A bond distances are 2.126 (3) A˚ , while the Co–O bond lengths are between 2.094 (2) and 2.166 (2) A˚ . The N–Co–N bond angles are 86.91 (15), while the O–Co–N and O–Co–O bond angles are in the ranges of 91.72 (9) - 178.53 (10) and 88.59 (9) - 176.23 (12), respectively. The completely deprotonated tbta2- ligands in 2 coor- dinate to the cobalt atoms in a bidentate bridging l2 - g1, g1 coordination mode, resulting in 1D linear [Co(tbta)]n chains (Fig. 2b). The ﬂexible bbdmbm acts as a bis- monodentate ligand to bridge two cobalt atoms, exhibiting cis-trans-trans conﬁguration with the dihedral angles between the mean planes of the two benzimidazole rings in bbdmbm being 49.97 (9). The overall structure is an inﬁnite 2D (4, 4) grid framework, where the dimensions of each [Co4(tbta)2(bbdmbm)2] grid is 9.490 (1) 9 11.410 (1) A˚ as measured by through-space CoCo distances, with Co–Co–Co angles of 54.698 (1), 125.302 (1) (Fig. 2c). If each cobalt(II) center is considered as a four- connected node, and the tbta2- and bbdmbm ligands as Fig. 1 a Coordination environment around the cobalt(II) center in 1 at 30 % probability thermal ellipsoids, all hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity.

Complex 3, formulated as [Co(tbta)(bbbm)]n, crystal- lizes in the triclinic P-1 space group. The asymmetric unit contains one cobalt atom, one tbta2- ligand, and one bbbm ligand. As depicted in Fig. 3a, the Co(II) center is four- coordinated by two oxygen atoms (O2, O3) from two deprotonated tbta2- ligands and two nitrogen atoms (N2, N3A, symmetry codes: A= x, y - 1, z) from two bbbm ligands, exhibiting a distorted tetrahedral geometry with a s4 factor of 0.90 (for an ideal tetrahedron, s4 = 1). The Co–O bond distances vary from 1.943 (2) to 1.994 (2) A˚ , and the Co–N bond lengths are in the range of 2.014 (3) - 2.037 (3) A˚ . The bond angles around Co(II) range from 103.15 (10) to 122.69 (11). In complex 3, the tbta2- ligands again adopt bridging bidentate l2 - g1, g1 coordination with adjacent cobalt(II) centers to build a 1D zigzag [Co(tbta)]n chain, where the Co–Co–Co angle deﬁned by the orientation of the tbta2- ligands in the chain is 115.129 (5) (Fig. 3b). The bbbm ligands show cis-cis-trans conformation, in which the dihedral angles between the mean planes of the two benzimidazole rings are 70.312 (9), and further link the 1D chains to furnish an undulating 2D (4, 4) net (Fig. 3c). There are two types of 40-membered macrocycles in this net formed by four Co(II) atoms, two tbta2- ligands, and two bbbm ligands with dimensions of 19.127 (8) A˚ 9 1.0823 (7) A˚ and 20.460 (9) A˚ 9 8.083 (6) A˚ (diagonal lengths), respectively. From a topological view- point, the structure of 3 can be simpliﬁed to a puckered {44.62}-sql network (Fig. 3d). From the structure description above, it can be clearly seen that although complexes 1–3 are all constructed from tbta2- ligands and different bis(benzimidazole) derivatives under similar conditions, they show different structures. Compound 1 contains a 1D ladder-like chain. Compounds 2 has a coplanar 2D layer structure with a {44.62}-sql topology, while complex 3 features a undulating 2D layer with the same topology type. As discussed above, all of the tbta2- ligands in the three complexes act as bridging ligands with bidentate l2 - g1, g1 coordination linking the neighboring metal centers. In complex 1, all the benzene rings of the tbta2- ligands are parallel to each other. As for complexes 2 and 3, it is interesting to note that the two dicarboxylate ligands in each (4,4) grid of both complexes also manifest parallel mode, whereas the dihedral angles of the adjacent acids in the same 1D chains are about 52.995 (2) and 82.231 (3) in complexes 2 and 3, respectively. Additionally and remarkably, although all of the N-donor ligands in 1–3 uni- formly behave as bis-monodentate bridging ligands, they display various conformations, which may be tentatively assigned to the variations in spacer lengths, spacer angles (as shown in Table 2), and the steric hindrance of the methyl substituents. The bdmbm ligand in complex 1 adopts cis- trans conformation with a terminal NN distance of 7.1902 (98) A˚ . The N-containing ligands in 2 and 3 adopt cis-trans- trans and cis-cis-trans conformations, respectively, with NN distances being of 7.4428 (42) A˚ for 2 and 8.3995 (49) A˚ for 3. The NN distances in complexes 2 and 3 are much longer than that in 1 because of the extra –CH2– spacer.

Bands observed at around 3,198–3,646 cm-1 for 1 and 3,580–3,660 cm-1 for 2 are assigned to the O–H stretching vibrations of water mole- cules. Strong peaks at 1,510 cm-1 for both 1 and 2, 1,511 cm-1 for 3, can be attributed to mC=N of the N-het- erocyclic rings in the N-containing ligands, while weak absorption bands at around 2,940 cm-1 for 1, 2,928 cm-1 for 2, and 2,933 cm-1 for 3 can be assigned to –CH2– groups. The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibra- tions of the coordinated –COO- groups appear at 1,618 and 1,412 cm-1 for 1, 1,594 and 1,400 cm-1 for 2, and 1,621 and 1,400 cm-1 for 3, respectively, indicating the uniform unidentate coordination mode of the carboxylate groups of the tbta2- ligand. To estimate the stability of these coordination archi- tectures, TG analyses of complexes 1–3 were carried out. The TG curve of 1 indicates that the lattice water mole- cules are released between 70 and 96 C (Calcd: 1.02%; Found: 1.05%); the decomposition of the framework begins from 120 C. Decomposition is complete by 650 C, with the ﬁnal product identiﬁed as CoO (calcd: 8.51 %; found: 8.64 %). For complex 2, weight loss from 103 to 183 C is assigned to two-coordinated water ligands (Calcd: 3.91%; Found: 3.88%). Further weight loss is ascribed to the release of the organic ligands, and the residual weight of 8.13% is equivalent to CoO (cal- culated 8.96%). For 3, the weight loss observed from 183 Fig. 4 TG curve of title compounds Fig. 5 a Solid-state photoluminescence spectra of pbdmbm ligand and compound 1; b Solid-state photoluminescence spectra of bbdmbm ligand and compound 2; c Solid-state photoluminescence spectra of bbbm ligand and compound 3 Transition Met Chem (2015) 40:21–29 27 123 C can be assigned to the tbta2- and bbbm ligands, and the framework continued to decompose until 793 C (Fig. 4). Photoluminescence properties The solid-state photoluminescent properties of complexes 1–3 and the three bis(benzimidazole)-based ligands were studied in the solid state at room temperature. As illustrated in Fig. 5, complexes 1–3 exhibit similar emission peaks with maxima at 393 nm for 1, 395 nm for 2, and 391 nm for 3 upon excitation at 250 nm. The free bis(benzimid- azole)-based ligands give emission maxima at 368 nm for pbdmbm, 365 nm for bbdmbm, and 395 nm for bbbm with excitation wavelengths of 315, 315, and 349 nm, respec- tively. The resemblance between the emissions of the free N-donor ligands and their corresponding complexes indi- cates that the emissions of the complexes can be tentatively assigned to the intraligand charge transitions of their bis(benzimidazole)-based ligands [33]. The small blue shift of the emission maximum in 3 is probably due to the inﬂuence of the bbbm ligand on the metal atom, while the red shifts of 1 and 2 may be tentatively assigned to the inﬂuence of the coordination of the ligand to the metal atom, as well as the effects of steric hindrance of the methyl substituents. Catalytic degradation of congo red Congo red is a typical azo dye. Such compounds are extensively used in textile, dyeing, rubber, printing, paper, food, wood, plastic, cosmetic industries, and related industries. This dye is harmful to the aquatic environment and human beings, so it is important to remove such dyes before discharging waste water [34, 35]. Herein, as an extension of our previous work, cobalt(II) complexes 1–3 were used as heterogeneous catalysts of the Fenton-like oxidation of congo red. The results of the congo red degradation experiments are depicted in Fig. 6. CoCl26H2O was also assessed as a catalyst under identical experimental conditions for com- parison (This control experiment is homogeneous). It can be clearly seen that in the presence of all three complexes, obvious degradation occurred in the initial 10 min; and after 30 min, the degradation rate of congo red reached up to 77.3% for 1, 96.3% for 2, and 99.7% for 3, compared to just 12.7% for the blank control experiment. In the pre- sence of CoCl2, the degradation rate is 55.6%, which is lower than for the title complexes. Conclusion Three new cobalt(II) MOCPs based on tetrabromotereph- thalic acid and ﬂexible bis(benzimidazole) ligands bearing different spacer lengths and substituents have been obtained by hydrothermal reactions. Polymer 1 has a 1D ladder-like chain structure, while complexes 2 and 3 have a 2D layer structure with {44.62}-sql topology. Additionally, complexes 2 and 3 present higher catalytic activity than complex 1 in the Fenton-like degradation of congo red dye.
