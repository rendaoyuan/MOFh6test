Manuscript Two 3D Supramolecular Cadmium(II) Coordination Polymers Derived from Semi-rigid Bis(2-methylbenzimidazole) and Different Dicarboxylate Ligands Rui Yang • Wen Chen Xiao • Kristof Van Hecke • Guang Hua Cui Received: 24 October 2014 / Accepted: 20 December 2014 / Published online: 27 December 2014  Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014 Abstract Two cadmium(II) coordination polymers, [Cd(L)(nda)(H2O)0.75H2O]n (1) and [Cd(L)(tbta)(H2O)]n (2) (L = 1,3-bis-(2-methylbenzimidazol-1-ylmethyl)ben- zene, H2nda = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, H2 tbta = tetrabromoterephthalic acid), were synthesized under hydrothermal conditions and characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and powder X-ray diffractionanalysis. Both complexesexhibit 2D (6,3) honeycomb-like structures. Complex 1 is further extended into a twofold interpenetrating 3D 4,4-connected mog supramolecular architecture with point symbol of {4.64.8}2{42.62.82} via classical O–HO hydrogen bonding interactions, while 2 displays a 3D supramolecular framework through p–p stacking interactions. The ﬂuorescence proper- ties and thermal stability of the two complexes were investigated. Keywords Bis(benzimidazole)  Cadmium(II) coordination polymer  Crystal structure  Fluorescence property 1 Introduction The rational design and synthesis of metal–organic coordina- tion polymers (MOCPs) have been receiving great attention in the ﬁeld of crystal engineering and supramolecular chemistry, owing to their intriguing structures along with functional applications such as luminescence, magnetism, gas adsorp- tion, ion exchange and catalysis [1–5]. The appropriate design of organic ligands as building blocks is undoubtedly a crucial element in assembling these coordination polymers [6–13]. Among these ligands, derivatives of the bis(benzimidazole) ligand with various ﬂexible spacers between the two 2-meth- ylbenzimidazol functions have attracted considerable interest [14, 15]. The methyl group, introduced into the 2-position of the benzimidazole ring, plays an important role in enhancing the electron donating ability of the N-donor ligand; the ﬂexi- bilityofthespacer cansatisfythecoordinationrequirementsof transitionmetal centersand can giverise to robust andintricate networks, such as interpenetrating networks and high dimen- sional frameworks. Moreover, this type of ligands contains both the imidazole ring and a larger conjugated p system, capable of acting as hydrogen-bond donors and for p–p stacking interactions to diversify the supramolecular archi- tectures. All these features increase the potential applications of its MOCPs as solid functional materials [16–23]. For example, Fan’s group presented a series of cadmium(II)/zin- c(II)-MOFs, based on 1,10-(1,3-propane)bis-(2-methylbenz- imidazole), which manifested good photocatalytic activities for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) in water under the irradiation of a high-pressure mercury lamp [18]. Our group already reported two cobalt(II) coordination polymers, [Co(L1)(tbi)(H2O)]n and [Co(L2)(tbi)]n (L1 = 1,4-bis(benz- imidazole)butane, L2 = 1,4-bis(2-methylbenzimidazole)- butane, H2tbi = 5-tert-butyl isophthalic acid). Both of these complexes showed higher activity in the degradation of congo R. Yang  G. H.

In order to further investigate the inﬂuence of the carboxylate anions mixed with the semi-rigid 1,3-bis-(2-methylbenzimidazol-1-ylmethyl) benzene (L) ligand on the architectures of cadmium(II) coor- dination polymers, two 3D supramolecular MOCPs [Cd(L)(nda)(H2O)0.75H2O]n (1) and[Cd(L)(tbta)(H2O)]n (2) (H2nda = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, H2tbta = tetr- abromoterephthalic acid (Scheme 1)), constructed with 2D (6,3) layered subunits, have been successfully synthesized and characterization. The thermogravimetric analyses and solid- state luminescence properties of two complexes are also discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and Methods All the solvents and reagents for the syntheses were pur- chased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd. and used without further puriﬁcation. The ligand L was pre- pared according to the literature method [25]. Elemental analyses were made on a Perkin–Elmer automatic analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FT–IR Avatar 360 spectrophotometer in the range of 4,000–400 cm-1 using KBr pellets. The TG measurements were performed on a NETZSCH TG 209 thermal analyzer from room tempera- ture to 800 C under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 C min-1. X-ray powder diffraction (XPRD) measure- ments were executed on a D/MAX 2500PC X–ray dif- fractometer using Cu Ka radiation (k = 1.542 A˚ ) in the 2h range of 5–50 with a step size of 0.02 and a scanning rate of 10 min-1. The solid ﬂuorescence spectra were performed with a Hitachi F-7000 ﬂuorescence spectro- photometer at room temperature. 2.2 Synthesis of [Cd(L)(nda)(H2O)0.75H2O]n (1) A mixture of Cd(OAc)23H2O (0.1 mmol, 23.1 mg), L ligand (0.1 mmol, 36.6 mg), H2nda (0.1 mmol, 21.6 mg), NaOH (8.0 mg, 0.2 mmol) and H2O (10 mL) was stirred for 0.5 h at room temperature, and then transferred and sealed in a 25 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless vessel reactor and heated to 140 C for 3 d under autogenous pressure. The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 C/h. The colorless block crystals of 1 were isolated by ﬁltration, washed with distilled water and dried in air. Yield 36.8 % based on Cd(OAc)23H2O. Calcd. for C36 H31.5CdN4O5.75 (Fw = 724.55): C 59.68, H 4.38, N 7.73 %; found: C 59.54, H 4.13, N 7.40 %. FTIR (KBr pellet, cm-1): 3359s, 3050m, 2908m, 1602s, 1556w, 1490m, 1453m, 1395s, 1354m, 1096m, 857w, 794m, 746m, 557m, 454m. 2.3 Synthesis of [Cd(L)(tbta)(H2O)]n (2) This complex was prepared in an analogous manner to that of 1 except that H2nda (0.1 mmol, 21.6 mg) was used instead of H2tbta (0.1 mmol, 48.1 mg). The colorless block-shaped crystals of 2 suitable for X-ray diffraction were collected by mechanical separation from an amor- phous solid with 58.2 % yield based on Cd(OAc)23H2O. Calcd. for C32H22Br4CdN4O5 (Fw = 974.58): C 39.44, H 2.28, N 5.75 %; found: C 39.68, H 2.11, N 5.66 %.

X-ray crystallographic data for title complexes were collected at room temperature using epoxy-coated crystals mounted on glass ﬁbers. All measurements were carried out on a Bruker Smart 1000 CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) and x-2h scan mode at 293(2) K. Absorption corrections were applied with the SADABS program [26]. All structures of the complexes were solved by direct methods, and the non-hydrogen atoms were located from the trial structures and then reﬁned anisotropically with SHELXTL using a full-matrix least-squares procedure based on F2 values [27]. All non- hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms of water molecules were located in a difference Fourier map, while other hydrogen atoms were included in calculated positions and reﬁned with isotropic thermal parameters riding on the parent atoms. Complex 1 showed disorder in C32, C33, C34, C35, C36 of the naphthalene group, these atoms were reﬁned with a split model with site occupation factor 0.60 and SADI distance restraints for the related disordered atoms. In addition, the 0.75 lattice water molecules are disordered and the structure was further reﬁned by the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON [28]. Crystallographic data and other pertinent information for the coordination polymers are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Crystal Structure of [Cd(L)(nda)(H2O)0.75H2O] n (1) Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, each Cd atom adopts a slightly distorted J Inorg Organomet Polym (2015) 25:772–779 773 123 octahedron structure, being coordinated by three oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3) from two different nda ligands and one oxygen atom (O1W) from one water molecule and two L ligand nitrogen atoms (N1, N3A) (symmetry code: A -x ? 1, -y ? 2, -z ? 1). The equatorial positions are built by O1, O2, O3 and N1 and the sum of the four angles of the plane is 359.6, the apical positions are occupied by O1W and N3A with the O1W–Cd–N3A angle of 177.10(9). The Cd–O bond distances range from 2.249(2) to 2.562(2) A˚ , and the Cd1–N1 and Cd1–N3A bond lengths are 2.242(3), 2.352(3) A˚ , respectively, which are in good agreement with those of similar Cd complexes [29]. In 1, two Cd atoms are bridged by four nitrogen atoms from two L ligands with l2-bridging mode to form [Cd2L2] binuclear subunits with a CdCd distance of 14.0610(8) A˚ . The L ligand adopts the anti-conformation mode.

It is noteworthy that the H2nda ligands are fully deprotonated and act a bis-mono- dentate bridging mode/bis-chelating ligand mode, which further connect the [Cd2L2] binuclear subunits into a hon- eycomb-like 2D (6,3) structure (Fig. 1b). The CdCd dis- tances across two different kinds of nda ligands are 13.2707(5) and 13.3120(5) A˚ , respectively. The 2D layers are extended into a 3D supramolecular network via classical hydrogen bonding interaction between the coordinated water molecule and carboxylate oxygen atom O4 of the nda ligand (O1W–H1BO4C 165, H1BO4C 1.98 A˚ , sym- metry code: C -x, -y, -z) (Fig. 1c). When examination of this 3D supramolecular framework is performed with the TOPOS4.0 program [30], it is clear this network can be simpliﬁed to a 2-nodal 4,4-connected mog(moganite) topology with the vertex symbol {4.64.8}2{42.62.82} [31] by considering each Cd atom as a 4-connected node, and L as well as nda ligands as linkers. A single 3D network contains huge voids, which are further ﬁlled through the interpene- tration of second network, leading to a twofold interpene- trating 3D mog network with FIV [0,1,0] (12.38 A˚ ) (Fig. 1d). The two interpenetrated networks belong to a single translational vector (Class Ia) via H-bonding interactions, and the values of Zt and Zn are 2 and 1, respectively. Inhere, Zt is the translational degree of inter- penetration, and Zn is the non-translational degree of inter- penetration [32]. In the ﬁeld of 4-connected frameworks, diamond nets are often encountered; in contrast, mog, sra, PtS, quartz, and CdSO4 nets are relatively rare [33, 34], and mog nets with twofold interpenetrated are even rarer. To the best of our knowledge, the framework of 1 is the ﬁrst example of a twofold interpenetrated mog network of Cd(II) supramolecular MOCPs. Previously, Tong and co-workers obtained a [Cu2(l4-Cl)(4,40-bpy)2(NO3)]n compound, which contained single mog covalent networks with tetrahedral and square-planar nodes [35]. Additionally, Kang reported a 3D coordination framework [Cd2(Ad)2(IN)(DMF)(H2 O)]DMF (Ad = Adenine, IN = isonicotinic acid) with a 4-connected mog topology [36]. 3.2 Crystal Structure of [Cd(L)(tbta)(H2O)]n (2) Complex 2 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P 1. The asymmetric unit consists of one Cd(II) ion, one tbta dian- ion, one L ligand and one coordinated water molecule. As Fig. 1 a Coordination environment around the Cd(II) ion in 1 at 30 % probability thermal ellipsoids, all hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity.

The Cd–O bond lengths vary from 2.246(2)– 2.509(3) A˚ and the Cd–N distances are in the range of 2.268(3)–2.317(3) A˚ . In 2, Two Cd atoms are bridged by two L ligands to form a 24-membered macrometallacycle ring subunit with a CdCd distance of 10.4841(7) A˚ , in which the L ligands adopt the syn-conformation mode. The dihedral angle between the mean planes of the two benzimidazole rings is 77.89(9). Two different coordination modes of the car- boxylate groups in each tbta ligand were observed. The subunits are connected by one kind of tbta ligand as a l2- g2, g2 linker into 1D zigzag chains, which are further conjoined into 2D layers through the other tbta adopting a bis-monodentate bridging mode (Fig. 2b). The CdCd distance through two kinds of tbta ligands are 11.2095(6) and 11.5571(6) A˚ , respectively. Topologically, each Cd atom can be simpliﬁed as a 3-connected node, the ligands can be deﬁned as linkers, therefore, 2D layers can be described as a 63 topology. In addition, two different patterns of pp stacking interactions between the imid- azole rings and benzene rings of the L ligands further assemble the 2D (6,3) layers into a 3D supramolecular network (Fig. 2c). The pp parameters (Cg–Cg distance and interplanar separation) are, for Cg1–Cg1A (Cg1: C2– C3–C4–C5–C6–C7) 3.6878, 3.6289 A˚ , Cg2–Cg3 (Cg2: N3–C17–N4–C18–C23, Cg3: C18–C19–C20–C21–C22– C23) 3.5280, 3.2873 A˚ , which contribute to the stabiliza- tion of the crystal packing.

No band at 1,700 cm-1 was observed for both complexes, indicating that the carboxylate groups of the organic moieties are completely deprotonated, which is in good agreement with the crystal structure of each complex. Bands at 1,490 for 1 and 1,508 for 2 can be attributed to the mC=N absorption of the benzimidazole rings of the L ligand. The weak bands observed at 746 and 857 cm-1 for 1 and 740 and 848 cm-1 for 2 are due to 1,3-disubstituted benzene [37]. There are strong bands at 1602, 1453, 1354 cm-1 for 1 and 1583, 1414, 1323 cm-1 for 2, that can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the carboxyl groups. The separations Dm = [mas(COO)–ms(COO)] between the bands indicate that the carboxyl groups of two aromatic dicarboxylate ligands exhibit monodentate (248 cm-1 for 1, 262 cm-1 for 2) and chelating (149 cm-1 for 1, 171 cm-1 for 2) coordination modes. 3.4 Thermal Properties In order to evaluate the thermal stability of complexes 1–2, thermogravimetric experiments were carried out as depic- ted in Fig. 3. It can be easily found that there are two weight loss steps for complex 1. The weight loss of 4.6 % from 80 to 110 C is related to the loss of water molecules (calcd.: 4.3 %). Subsequently, complex 1 keeps losing weight between 230 and 530 C, revealing the decompo- sition of organic ligands (calcd.: 82.5 %, found.: 82.1 %), with CdO as the assumed residue of 13.3 % (calcd.: 13.2 %). For 2, three weight loss steps can be distin- guished. The ﬁrst one occurs between 125 C and 158 C, corresponding to the removal of water molecules (calcd.: 1.8 %, found.: 1.7 %). The second one exhibits a weight loss in the range of 210–385 C, which can be assigned to the loss of L ligands (calcd.: 37.3 %, found.: 37.6 %). And the third one begins to decompose from 440 to 650 C, implying the release of tbta ligands (calcd.: 47.7 %, found.: 47.4 %). The residual weight was assumed to be CdO 13.3 % (calcd.: 13.2 %). 3.5 XPRD Results To conﬁrm the purity of the bulk materials, XPRD exper- iments were also carried out for both complexes. As shown in Fig. 4a, b, the XPRD experimental patterns of com- plexes 1–2 are well consistent with the simulated ones, based on the single crystal data, which indicate phase purities of the bulk materials and conﬁrm that the Fig. 4 a X-ray powder diffraction patterns of 1. b.

Herein, the lumi- nescent properties of coordination polymers containing Cd ions and free L ligands were examined in the solid state at room temperature (Fig. 5). The free L ligand displays an intense emission maximum at 400 nm upon excitation at 328 nm, which can be attributed to the p ? p* transition [17]. The main emission peaks are observed at about 370 nm (kex = 260 nm) for 1 and 385 nm (kex = 328 nm) for 2. Compared with the free L ligand, there is an obvious red-shifted emission of 30 nm for 1 and 15 nm for 2, which may be attributed to intraligand transitions due to Cd2? ions of d10 conﬁguration, which are difﬁcult to oxidize or reduce [39]. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have successfully synthesized two new Cd(II) coordination polymers based on ﬂexible bis(2- methylbenzimidazole) tuning different carboxylates. Complex 1 exhibits a 2D (6,3) layered structure, which is further extended into a twofold interpenetrating mog 3D supramolecular architecture via O–HO hydrogen bond- ing interactions, while complex 2 displays a 3D supramo- lecular framework constructed with 2D (6,3) networks through face-to-face p–p stacking interactions. This work illustrates that hydrogen bonding and p–p stacking inter- actions have dominating effects on the construction of supramolecular architectures with desired properties. Both complexes show strong solid-state ﬂuorescence properties at room temperature and could be promising candidates as photoactive materials. 5 Supplementary Material X-ray crystallographic ﬁles in CIF format for 1 and 2, have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre with CCDC No: 1030692 and 1030693.
