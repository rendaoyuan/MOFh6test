Complex 1 crystallizes in a chiral space group and has a two-fold interpenetrated 2D network structure with (4,4) topology, while complex 2 is a 3D porous dia network with four nets interpene- trating each other.

Among them, the most common and important types of polymeric frameworks are related to the interpenetrated architectures, which is in general generated by the existence of large free void in a single network, although it has been demonstrated that interpenetration can not prevent the possibility for ob- taining open porous materials[5,6]. In addition, merits of the interpenetrating networks have been discovered, and it has been proved that the interpenetrating networks could be utilized in gas storage when an entrapment mechanism happened in which the hydrogen molecule has a close affinity with the interpenetrating host frameworks[7]. Moreover, particular magnetic and electric properties have been also found in interpenetrated networks[8]. It is well known that coordination polymers with dia network which are inherently noncentrosymmetric[9 －11] have a high propensity to interpenetrate in order to fill the void space, and the reaction between unsymmetric rigid linear bridging ligands and d10 metal centers usually with tetrahedral or pseudotetrahedral extension often leads to the formation of dia networks which are necessary for sec- ond-order nonlinear optics (NLO) effects[12]. Herein, we report two novel interpenetrating frameworks, [Zn(IBA)2]n (1) and {[Cd(IBA)2(H2O)]·4H2O}n (2), obtained by the assembly reactions of 4-imidazole- benzoic acid (HIBA) and transition metal salts of Zn(II) and Cd(Ⅱ). Complex 1 has a two-fold interpenetrating two- dimensional (2D) network with (4,4) topology. Complex 2 is a three- dimen- sional (3D) porous framework with unprecedented four- fold interpenetrated dia topology. The SHG (second- har- monic-generation) activity of 1 and photoluminescent property of 2 were investigated in the solid state at room temperature.

The HIBA ligand was prepared by the method similar to that reported in ref. [13]. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vector22 FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr disks. C, H and N analyses were conducted on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. Measurements of SHG response: The second-order nonlinear optical intensity was estimated by measuring a powder sample with 80－150 μm in diameter in the form of a pellet relative to urea. A pulsed Q-switched Nd: YAG laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm was used to generate an SHG signal from powder samples. The backscattered SHG light was collected by a spherical concave mirror and passed through a filter that transmits only 532 nm radia- tion. The luminescent spectra for the solid samples were recorded at room temperature on an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrophotometer with xenon arc lamp as the light source. In the measurements of the emission and excitation spectra, the pass width was 5.0 nm. 2.2 Synthesis of [Zn(IBA)2]n (1) A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (59.4 mg, 0.1 mmol), HIBA (37.6 mg, 0.2 mmol), and triethylamine (0.2 mmol) in H2O (8 mL) was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon lined stainless steel container and heated at 160℃ for 3 days. After cooling to the room temperature, colorless block crystals of 1 were collected by filtration and washed by water and ethanol for several times with a yield of 60%. Anal.

The data integration and empirical absorption corrections were carried out by SAINT programs[14]. The structures were produced by direct methods (SHELXS 97)[15]. All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically on F2 by full-matrix least-squares techniques (SHELXL 97)[16]. All the hy- drogen atoms except for the water molecules in 2 were generated geometrically and refined isotropically using the riding model. The hydrogen atoms of the water molecules in 2 except for the disordered O4W were lo- cated in a difference Fourier map. Details of the crystal parameters, data collection and refinements for 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for 1 and 2 are listed in Table 2.

As shown in Figure 1, there is one Zn(Ⅱ) sitting on a specific position and one IBA- ligand in the asymmetric unit of 1. Each Zn(Ⅱ) atom with distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry is four- coordinated by two oxygen atoms from two different IBA− ligands with Zn—O bond length of 0.1916(4) nm, and two nitrogen atoms from other two IBA− ligands with Zn—N distance of 0.2028(5) nm. Thus, each metal center is coordinated by four IBA− ligands and each ligand in turn links two Zn(Ⅱ) atoms in complex 1 with the adjacent Zn···Zn distance of 1.136 nm. Such coordi- nation mode makes complex 1 a 2D network with nanometer-sized square grids (1.136×1.136 nm) created by the long spacer of the IBA− ligand as illustrated in Figure 2. Interestingly, there are two individual grids with (4,4) topology interpenetrating each other to fill the void space, and the vertexes of one net are located in the Figure 1 The coordination environment of Zn(Ⅱ) in 1. center of the other grid (Figure 3). It is noteworthy that the single crystal of 1 is chiral although it was con- structed from achiral IBA− ligand, and the chirality may come from the propagating of two-fold entangled 41 he- lixes with a pitch of 3.221 nm along a axis (Figure 4). However, the bulk sample of complex 1 is racemic. Figure 2 (a) Polyhedral representation of the 2D network of 1 and (b) the schematic representation of (4,4) topology of 1.

Complex 2 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group Pbcn. Each seven- coordi- nated Cd(Ⅱ) center with pentagonal bipyramidally coor- dination geometry is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two different IBA− ligands with Cd—N bond lengths in the range of 0.2283(4)－0.2298(5) nm, four oxygen atoms from other two different IBA− ligands and one water oxygen atom with Cd—O bond lengths in the range of 0.2337(4)－0.2573(4) nm (Figure 5 and Table 2). On the other hand, each IBA− ligand links two adjacent Cd(II) ions, and the four IBA− ligands coordinated to one Cd(II) have a tetrahedral or pseudo-tetrahedral extension. Thus, a 3D dia network with short and long Schläfli sym- bols of 66 and (62.62.62.62.62.62) is formed[17], and there are large rhombic channels with the size of 1.223×2.147 nm in the diamond unit (Figure 6). A more careful examination of 2 shows that interpen- etration happens inevitably because of the large voids in each single net, and there are three other identical dia nets interpenetrating with one in order to fill the voids (Figure 7). However, there are still one- dimensional (1D) channels in complex 2 occupied by uncoordinated water molecules. Although there is a large amount of MOFs with dia topology reported, complex 2 is the rare example of interpenetrating framework containing porous channels[18－20].

Complex 1 crystallizes in the space group P4(1)22, belonging to polar point group C4 [24], so we performed quasi-Kurtz SHG measurements on powder sample of 1 to confirm its acentricity and to evaluate its potential application as the second-order NLO material. The preliminary result showed the bulk materials display the modest powder SHG activity with a response of ap- proximately 0.4 times that for urea. Thus, compound 1 appears to be a good candidate for novel coordina- tion-based NLO material. 3.4 Photoluminescent property of 1 and 2 In general, coordination polymers involving transition metals of zinc(Ⅱ) or cadmium(Ⅱ) have been investi- gated to make clear the fluorescence properties because of their potential applications as luminescent materi- als[25,26] and in this study, we investigated the photolu- minescent property of 1 and 2 in the solid state at room temperature. Interestingly, only complex 2 exhibits a strong emission band at 480 nm upon the excitation at 365 nm, while the salt of ligand NaIBA exhibits a simi- lar emission at 475 nm under the same conditions (Fig- ure 8). Therefore, the emission of 2 may be ascribed to the intraligand π-π* fluorescent emission[27]. Figure 8 Phosphorescence emission spectra of NaIBA and 2. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, by using an unsymmetric rigid ligand of HIBA as building unit reacting with d10 metal salts, we successfully obtained two interpenetrated coordination polymers. Complex 1 shows moderate SHG activity which has a 2D two-fold interpenetrating architecture, while 2 has a novel four-fold interpenetrating dia framework with a 66 net topology. The results indicate that the coordination geometry of the metal centers has great influence on the resulting structures of this system and also prove the HIBA is an effective building unit in the construction of novel coordination polymers with novel net topology and interesting properties. 1 Eddaoudi M, Moler D B, Li H L, Chen B L, Reineke T M, O’Keeffe M, Yaghi O M.
