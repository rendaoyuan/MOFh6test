Manuscript Tin(IV) Polymers: Part 1. Synthesis of Diorganotin Esters of Thiosalicylic Acid: X-ray Crystal Structure of Polymeric Thiosalicylatodiorganotin Handong Yin,1,2 Haolong Xu,1 Kaozhen Li,1 and Gang Li1 Thiosalicylatodiorganotin, [R2Sn(O2CC6H4S)]n, (R = Me (1), n-Bu (2), Ph (3), 3-Cl–PhCH2 (4)), are prepared from thiosalicylic acid and diorganotin chlorides. All the compounds, 1–4, are characterized by elemental analysis as well as IR and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the 2 and 4 shows that the structures are polymeric with neigh- boring diorganotin centers being linked by one O-atom of the carboxylate ligands. The car- boxylate moiety is involved in coordination to one Sn atom via one O-atom while the other O-atom coordinates to the neighboring Sn atom. The mercaptotropone sulfur atom is bonded to the central Sn atom thereby establishing that Sn is ﬁve-coordinate and exists in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. KEY WORDS: Thiosalicylic acid; thiosalicylatodiorganotin; diorganotin compounds; X-ray crystal structure. 1. INTRODUCTION Organotin (IV) carboxylates have attracted much attention owing to their potential biocidal activity [1– 4] and cytotoxicity [5] as well as their industrial and agricultural applications [6–10]. In general, the bio- cidcal activity of organotin compounds is greatly inﬂuenced by the molecular structures and coordina- tion number of the tin atoms [11]. It has been revealed that organotin compounds containing carboxylate ligands with additional donor atoms (e.g. N, O or S) that are available for coordinating to the tin atom may result in new structure types, which may lead to diﬀerent activities [12]. The coordination chemistry of thiosalicylic acid has just started to receive the attention it deserves; yet, relatively few of their metal complexes have so far been reported. Recent work on Au(III), Pt(II) and Pd(II) thiosalicylates has demon- strated, apart from the structural versatility, their high biological activity, e.g., potent cytotoxicity towards P838 leukemia cells [13]. From the structural view- point, thiosalicylic acid can potentially be a monod- entate, bidentate and tridentate ligand; it may also participate as an intermolecularly bridging or intra- molecularly chelating ligand. In the present work, we have synthesized four new polymeric, linear, inﬁnite- chain diorganotin compounds with thiosalicylic acid, [R2Sn(O2CC6H4S)]n, (R = Me (1), n-Bu (2), Ph (3), 3-Cl–PhCH2(4), Scheme 1). All the compounds (1–4) were characterized by elemental analysis and IR and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The structures of 2 and 4 have been determined by X-ray diﬀraction. 2. EXPERIMENTAL 2.1.

All X-ray crystallographic data were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD 1000 diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo–Ka radiation (k=0.71073 A˚ ) at room temperature. A semi-empirical absorption correction was applied to the data. The structures were solved by direction methods and reﬁned against F2 by full-matrix least squares using SHELXL-97. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The assignment of FTIR bands of the title complexes has been made in comparison with the IR spectra related organotin complexes, thiosalicylic acid and R2SnCl2. The free thiosalicylic acid shows a broad O–H and S–H absorption at 3000– 2500 cm)1. This is commonly observed in carboxylic acids [14] but is absent from the spectra of the title complexes. This indicates a deprotonation of the COOH and S–H groups during the reaction. After deprotonation and coordination to a Sn atom, this band disappears and is replaced by strong bands in the 548–536 cm)1 and 316–305 cm)1 regions, which are assigned to the stretching mode of the Sn–C and Sn–O linkages, respectively. In the far-IR spectra, the absorption in the 305–316 cm)1 region for all the complexes, 1–4, which is absent in the spectrum of the ligand, is assigned to the Sn–S stretching vibration. All the values are located within the range for Sn–S vibrations that are observed in common organotin thiolate derivatives (viz. 300–400 cm)1) [15, 16]. The positions of the asymmetric thiolate carbonyl bands of all the compounds, relative to that found for free acid, indicate that one O-atom of the carboxyl group is bridging. Regarding the 1H-NMR spectra, the resonance appearing at 10–13 ppm in the free ligand is absent in the thiosalicylatodiorganotin compounds, thereby indicating replacement of the proton of carboxylic acid. And the signal of the –SH proton (1.65 ppm) in the spectrum of the ligand is absent in all the complexes, supporting the removal of the –SH proton and the formation of an Sn–S bond. This result agrees well with the FTIR spectra. Moreover, the 1H-NMR spectra show that the chemical shifts of the phenyl group (Sn–C6H6) in 3 and those of methyl or methylene units that are connected directly to tin in compounds 1, 2 and 4 shift upﬁeld relative to comparable groups in the corresponding precursors. All these data are similar to those cases that appear in literature [17]. An unambiguous assignment of the structure for compounds 2 and 4 are aﬀorded from single crystal Table I.

The X-ray diﬀraction investigation of these two complexes indicate that the structure is a polymeric chain in the solid state with neighboring diorganotin centers being linked by one O-atom in carboxylate ligands. The molecular structure and unit cell of complexes 2 and 4 are shown in Figs. 1–4. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Tables II and III. Fig. 1. Molecular structure of 2. Fig. 2. Molecular structure of 4. 322 Yin, Xu, Li, and Li As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the carboxylate moiety is involved in coordination to one Sn atom via one O atom of the carboxylate moiety, while the other O atom coordinates to the neighboring Sn atom. The mercaptotropone sulfur atom is bonded to the center Sn atom. Therefore, thiosalicylic acid behaves as intramolecularly chelating ligand. In complex 2 (Fig. 1), owing to the presence of weak interaction Sn(1)…O(2) and Sn(2)#...O(3), the minimum repeating unit is composed of the group that contains two Sn atoms. The intramolecular Sn(1)...O(2) and O(3)...Sn(2)#2 separations of 3.147 and 3.074 A˚ , respectively, are much greater than the sum of the van der Waals radii for Sn and O, which is 2.80 A˚ . The crystallographic data show clearly that the O(2) atom does not make any signiﬁcant contacts with the Sn atom. Although not involved in coordination to Sn, the O(2) and O(3) atoms form signiﬁcant intermolecular contacts in the crystal lattice. The Sn–O bond distances associated with the O atoms having a Sn...O interaction are longer than the other Sn–O bond distances; i.e., (Sn(2)– Table II.

Each Sn atom center is ﬁve-coordinate and exists in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with the O-atoms occupying the axial sites (O(1)–Sn(1)–O(3), 164.49(17) and O(4)#1–Sn(2)–O(2), 176.90(18)). In addition, the Sn(1)–S(2) bond distance (2.409(2) A˚ ) is close to the Sn(2)–S(1) bond distance (2.413(2) A˚ ). The structure of complex 4 is similar to that of complex 2. In the complex 4 (Fig. 2), each Sn atom center is also ﬁve-coordinate and exists in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with the O-atoms occupying the axial sites. The O(2)#1–Sn(1)–O(1) angle is 167.3(3). The minimum repeating unit is composed of a group that contains only one Sn atom. As with 2, the O(1)...Sn(1)#2 separation of 3.251 A˚ is much greater than the sum of the van der Waals radii for Sn and O. Moreover, the data show that the O(2) atom does not make signiﬁcant contact with the Sn atom. Although not involved in coordination to Sn, the O(1) atom also forms signiﬁcant intermolecular contacts in the crystal lattice. The Sn(1)–S(2) bond distance is 2.397(4) A˚ . The Sn(1)–O(2)# and Sn(1)– O(1) bond distances are 2.209(5) A˚ and 2.210(4) A˚ , respectively. 4.
