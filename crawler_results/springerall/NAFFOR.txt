Manuscript Hydrothermal syntheses and characterization of cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes of 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylic acid and 1,10-phenanthroline Hong-Zhen Xie • Shi-Jie Huang • Jin Zhou • Shu-Ping Yu • Dan-Yi Wei Received: 13 April 2010 / Accepted: 24 June 2010 / Published online: 8 July 2010  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010 Abstract Two coordination complexes, namely [Co(phen)- (H2O)L]H2O and [Ni2(phen)2(H2O)2L2]4H2O (phen = 1,10- phenanthroline, H2L = 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylic acid) have been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally charac- terized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. [Co(phen)- (H2O)L]H2O consists of 1D chains of the complex plus lattice H2O molecules. Interchain hydrogen bonds and p–p stack- ing interactions assemble the 1D chains into 2D layers. [Ni2(phen)2(H2O)2L2]4H2O is a binuclear complex which is assembled into a 3D supramolecular structure by strong hydrogen bonds and p–p stacking interactions. Both com- plexes were characterized by physico-chemical and spectro- scopic methods. Introduction The design and synthesis of supramolecular coordination complex networks, especially those constructed by p–p stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding, has been a ﬁeld of rapid growth due to their special physical properties and potential applications in functional materials [1, 2]. In particular, p–p stacking interactions between aromatic rings are important in proteins and protein-DNA systems for protein stabilization and various regulatory processes [3–5]. The geometries and properties of the organic ligands have a great effect on the structure of such supramolecular coordination complex networks [6]. Our recent interest has focused on the self-assembly of transition metals with 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylate anions. 1,3-Adamantanedi- carboxylic acid possesses several interesting characteris- tics; as a rigid ligand, it has two carboxyl groups which may be completely or only partially deprotonated, pro- viding a rich variety of coordination modes and allowing interesting structures with higher dimensionality; it can also act not only as a hydrogen bond acceptor but also as a hydrogen bond donor, depending on the protonation state of the carboxyl group. Hence, 1,3-adamantanedicarboxy- lic acid may be a good choice for the construction of supramolecular structures. The literature about metal complexes of 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylate is quite scarce [7–9]. In the present study, we report the hydrothermal syntheses and structural characterization of two com- plexes of the 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylate anion, namely [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O and [Ni2(phen)2(H2O)2L2]4H2O. Their structures indicate that hydrogen bonds and p–p interactions are responsible for supramolecular assemblies. Experimental All chemicals of p.a. grade were commercially available and used without further puriﬁcation. Infrared spectra were recorded in the range 4,000–400 cm-1 on a Shimadzu FTIR-8900 spectrometer using KBr pellets. The combined TG/DTA 6300 measurements were carried out from 25 to 900 C in a ﬂowing nitrogen atmosphere using a Seiko Exstar 6000 TG/DTA 6300 instrument with a heating rate H.-Z. Xie  S.-J.

The excitation and emission spectra were measured with an Aminco Bowman Series 2 instrument with a xenon arc lamp as the excitation light source for the solid state samples at room temperature. Synthesis Synthesis of [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O Dropwise addition of 0.1 M aqueous NaOH (6.0 ml) to a stirred aqueous solution of CoCl26H2O (0.0714 g, 0.30 mmol) in H2O (5.0 ml) produced a violet precipitate of Co(OH)2nH2O, which was centrifuged and washed with water until no Cl- was detected in the supernatant. The resulting solid was added to a solution of H2L (0.0672 g, 0.30 mmol) and phen (0.0595 g, 0.30 mmol) in H2O (10 ml). The mixture (pH 4.30) was then placed in a 23 ml Teﬂon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated at 150 C for 3 days, then cooled at 10 C/h to room tem- perature. The product was ﬁltered off, washed with ethanol and then dried under ambient conditions. Red crystals of [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O suitable to X-ray diffraction anal- ysis were obtained (yield: ca. 40%, based on Co). Synthesis of [Ni2(phen)2(H2O)2L2].4H2O [Ni2(phen)2(H2O)2L2]4H2O was prepared analogously to [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O except that NiSO47H2O (0.0843 g, 0.30 mmol) was used instead of CoCl26H2O and the ﬁnal mixture was pH 6.00. Green block crystals were obtained (Yield: ca. 35% based on Ni). Crystal structure determination and reﬁnement Suitable single crystals of [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O and [Ni2(phen)2(H2O)2L2]4H2O were selected for single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Data collections were performed at 298(2) K on a RIGAKU RAXIS–RAPID diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo–Ka radiation (k = 0.71073). All calculations were carried out with SHELXTL- 97 programs [10, 11]. The structures were reﬁned by full matrix least squares with anisotropic displacement parame- ters for non-hydrogen atoms. For both complexes, all hydrogen atoms belonging to water molecules were found in the electron density maps but ﬁxed in the riding model. The other H atoms were generated geometrically and treated as riding. Details of crystal data, collection and reﬁnement of the two complexes are summarized in Table 1, while selected interatomic distances and bond angles are listed in Table 2 for [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O and Table 3 for [Ni2- (phen)2(H2O)2L2]4H2O. Results and discussion Structure of [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O Single crystal X-ray structural analysis shows that the structure of [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O consists of the 1D ? 1[Co(phen)(H2O)(L)2/2] polymer chains and lattice H2O molecules. The Co atom is surrounded by two N atoms from one chelating phen ligand, three carboxylate oxygen atoms from two different L and one oxygen from a H2O ligand to complete a distorted octahedral coordination environment with one phen N atom and one carboxyl O(4)i atom at the apical positions (Fig. 1). Equatorial Co–N and Co–O bond distances average to 2.107 and 2.140 A˚ , respectively, and the apical Co–O bond is 2.093(2) A˚ , which is slightly shorter than the axial Co–N bond distance of 2.160(2) A˚ (Table 1). These values are similar to those reported in the literature [12–14]. The bond angles of \O–Co–O, \O–Co–N and \N–Co–N fall in the ranges 60.04(7)–158.74(7) and 77.39(7)–164.84(7) (Table 2), showing signiﬁcant deviation from the ideal values. Bond distances and angles of L are as expected when compared to those found in free H2L [15]. In the L ligands, one Table 1 Crystllographic data for complexes [Co(phen)(H2O)L] H2O [Ni2(phen)2(H2O)2L2] 4H2O Empirical formula C24H26N2O6Co C48H56N4O14Ni2 Formula mass 497.40 1030.39 Radiation Mo Ka Mo Ka Wavelength 0.71073 A˚ 0.71073 A˚ Crystal system Monoclinic Triclinic Space group P21/c P 1 a (A˚ ) 13.151(3) 10.029(2) b (A˚ ) 18.240(4) 11.582(2) c (A˚ ) 9.247(2) 12.245(2) a () 62.64(3) b () 105.01(3) 67.16(3) c () 74.74(3) V (A˚ 3) 2,142.5(7) 1,157.9(4) Z 4 1 Dcalc (g/cm3) 1.542 1.478 l (mm-1) 0.847 0.886 F (000) 1036 540 h range () 3.19–27.48 3.13–27.48 Reﬂns collected 20,545 11,386 Reﬂns independent 4,883 5,231 Reﬂns observed 3,435 4,186 R1 [I [ 2r] 0.0398 0.0480 R1 [all data] 0.0716 0.0631 GOF 1.025 1.140 774 Transition Met Chem (2010) 35:773–778 123 carboxylate group coordinates to one Co(II) atom by che- late mode, the other also links one Co(II) atom by a monodentate mode. In this way, the Co atoms are bridged into 1D zigzag chains which extend along the [001] direction (Fig. 1). The water ligands as well as lattice H2O molecules donate hydrogen atoms to the coordinated and non-coordinated carboxyl O atoms of L to form intrachain hydrogen bonds (Table 2), which contribute to the stabil- ization of the crystal structure. The interchain hydrogen bonds between O atoms of coordinated water molecules and the coordinated carboxyl O(2) atoms of the neighbor- ing chains are responsible for the formation of the ladder- like double chains. In the zigzag single chains, the distance between the neighboring Co(II) atoms is 9.247(2) A˚ and the phen ligands are parallel on one side; but in the double chains, the distance between the neighboring Co atoms is 5.405(3) A˚ and the phen ligands are situated on both sides. In the ladder-like chains, the inorganic and organic moie- ties constitute alternating hydrophilic and lipophilic chan- nels. The double ladder-like chains are assembled into open supramolecular 2D layers (Fig. 2) perpendicular to the [100] direction via signiﬁcant p–p stacking interactions between the neighboring phen ligands from different chains, with a mean interplanar phen-to-phen distance of 3.36 A˚ .

As illustrated in Fig. 3, as for [Co(phen)- (H2O)L]H2O, the Ni atoms are also in a distorted octahedral environment surrounded by two N atoms of one phen ligand, four O atoms from two L ligands and one H2O ligand. The Ni–N bond distances are 2.064(2) and 2.077(2) A˚ , and the Ni–O distances vary from 2.035(2) to 2.359(2) A˚ (Table 3). The apical positions are occupied by one phen N(2) atom and one carboxyl O(4)i atom. The coordination mode of L is similar to that in [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O. Each L acts as a tridentate bridging ligand to link two Ni(II) atoms into the binuclear [Ni2(phen)2(H2O)2L2] structure, in which there are strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the aqua oxygen atoms and the non-coordinated carboxylate O(3) atoms (Table 3). The complex molecules are assembled into 1D chains along the [100] direction by hydrogen bonds between the aqua oxygen atoms and the coordinating car- boxylate O(2) atoms. Two neighboring phen ligands of dif- ferent 1D supramolecular chains face opposite directions at an interplanar distance of 3.39 A˚ , with the fragments of phen partially covered, which suggests signiﬁcant interchain p–p stacking interactions. Through such interactions, the 1D chains are assembled into 2D layers parallel to (101) (Fig. 4). The lattice molecules are sandwiched between layers. The resulting layers are further interlinked by interlayer hydro- gen bonds between lattice molecules and oxygen atoms from different layers to generate a 3D framework. Spectroscopic and thermal analysis The IR spectrum of [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O shows the characteristic bands of the carboxylate groups at 1,540(s), 1,510(s) cm-1 for asymmetric stretching and 1,423(s), 1,385(s) cm-1 for symmetric stretching. The O–H band (from the coordinated and lattice water molecules or the O atoms of the L) centered at 3,450 cm-1 is broadened by hydrogen bonding [16]. The IR spectrum of [Ni2(phen)2- (H2O)2L2]4H2O is very similar to that of [Co(phen)- (H2O)L]H2O. The characteristic bands of the carboxylate groups for [Ni2(phen)2(H2O)2L2]4H2O are observed at 1,543, 1,514, 1,402 and 1,338 cm-1. As shown in Fig. 5, the DTA curve of [Co(phen)- (H2O)L]H2O displays three endothermic peaks at 143, 430 and 509 C, and one exothermic peak at 773 C. The thermal decomposition process can be divided into two stages. The ﬁrst weight loss of 7.5% (calcd: 7.2%) over 90–153 C corresponds well to the release of both lattice and coordinated waters. The second weight loss occurs in the temperature range of 230–900 C, with about 69.5% weight loss. The ﬁnal decomposition product is presumably Co2O3C4N, 23.0% (calcd: 22.9%). For [Ni2(phen)2- (H2O)2L2]4H2O, the DTA curve displays three endother- mic peaks at 89, 154 and 455 C, and one exothermic peak at 778 C. The ﬁrst weight loss of 9.7% (calcd: 10.5%) to 182 C corresponds to the loss of both lattice and coordi- nated water. The second weight loss is 58.8% over 385– 900 C. The ﬁnal decomposition product is presumably Ni2O3C11N2, 31.5% (calcd: 31.6%). In the solid state, [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O exhibits an intense emission band at 365 nm (kex = 330 nm) at room temperature. To understand the nature of the emission, we analyzed the photoluminescence properties of the free H2L and phen ligands. The strongest emission peaks for H2L and phen are at 450 and 383 nm, respectively, which are Fig. 2 The supramolecular 2D layer of [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O through p–p stacking interactions Fig. 1 ORTEP view of [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O with a limited atom numbering scheme.

Thus, the emis- sion band observed for [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O, which is different from those of the individual organic ligands, may arise from ligand-to-metal transfer (LMCT) [18,19]. As is well known, Co(II) is not an excellent metal for photolumi- nescence; hence, the observation that [Co(phen)(H2O)L] H2O exhibits strong emission suggests that the photolumi- nescence property is closely related to the structure of this complex. We speculate that the p–p stacking interactions in [Co(phen)(H2O)L]H2O can promote the charge transfer and delocalization within the whole structure, and thus enhance the photoluminescence. In contrast, [Ni2(phen)2(H2O)2L2] 4H2O, does not show comparable photoluminescence, since similar LMCT is not possible. Conclusion We have synthesized two new Co(II) and Ni(II) coordi- nation complexes with bridging 1,3-adamantanedicarb- oxylic acid ligands. The uncoordinated oxygen atoms of the 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylato ligand and the water molecules in both complexes are involved in strong hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition, the p–p stacking interactions of the auxiliary phen ligand phen have a signiﬁcant effect on the structures and the photolumi- nescence properties of the title compounds.
