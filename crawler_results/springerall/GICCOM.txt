All these complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and X-ray crystallogra- phy. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that com- plexes 1–4 are isostructural and have a one-dimensional chain structure. Upon the addition of the solvent DMF, the inﬁnite linear chain array in 4 is converted to a 1-D wave- like chain motif in 5 with a different space group (P1 for 4 and P21/c for 5). The difference between structures 1–4 and 5 can be attributed to the coordination mode of carboxylate changing from trans to cis fashion. The ZnII and CdII complexes 1 and 2 display similar emissions in the solid state, which essentially are intraligand transitions. Introduction There is currently signiﬁcant interest in the design and controlled assembly of coordination polymers based on transition metal ions and multifunctional bridging ligands owing to their versatile and intriguing architectures and topologies as well as potential applications [1–6]. In this ﬁeld, the structural and functional diversiﬁcation for such crystalline materials signiﬁcantly rests with the appropriate choice of suitable organic ligand (spacers) and metal ions (nodes) as well as the synthetic conditions [7–13]. Among various organic ligands, aromatic polycarboxylate com- pounds, for example, 1,n-benzenedicarboxylate (1,n-BDC, n = 2, 3, and 4), have been extensively used as multi- functional spacers, due to their extension ability both in covalent bonding and supramolecular interactions (H-bonding and aromatic stacking) [14–21]. To investigate the inﬂuence of the bulky group functionalization of such ligands on the structures and properties of their coordina- tion complexes, the analogues of 1,4-BDC-type organic tectons with electron-donating or -accepting substituents such as methyl [22], methylthio [23], allyloxy [24], hydroxyl [25], mercapto [26], ﬂuoro [27], chloro [28], and bromo [29], have been documented so far. In these metal– ligand coordination systems, it has been suggested [26–29] that the introduction of large substituents in ortho to the carboxylate group on the benzene ring of BDC-type ligands plays an essential role in the coordination mode of carboxylate, the connectivity of the ligand, and the overall topological networks, as well as producing some interest- ing effects on the physical properties compared with their nonfunctional analogues. We are currently engaged in a detailed study of the coordination chemistry of polyhalogen-substituted ben- zenedicarboxylate ligands, due to their unique linking S.-C. Chen  M. Hu  Z.-H.

In this work, we chose to investigate a rigid periodi- nated ligand, 2,3,5,6-tetraiodo-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC-I4) as a building block, considering its fol- lowing characteristics: (a) the bulky iodine groups can signiﬁcantly affect the relative orientation of the carbox- ylate groups; (b) the four large iodine atoms can preclude interpenetration; (c) the four iodine atoms as the functional groups can act as potential interaction sites for forming O–HI, C–HI, or C–Ip halogen bonds that may help to extend the linkage into high-dimensional supramolecular networks. CuII or ZnII polymers based on 2,3,5,6-tetraiodo- 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC-I4) have been syn- thesized and applied for nanoparticle materials bearing computed tomography (CT) contrast enhancement [34]. In order to study the effects of ligand nature and solvent systems on the formation of metal complexes, ﬁve new coordination polymers {[M(BDC-I4)(MeOH)4](H2BDC-I4)(MeOH)2}n (M = ZnII for 1, CdII for 2, CoII for 3 and MnII for 4) and {[Mn(BDC-I4)(MeOH)4](DMF)}n (5) were obtained by the reactions of H2BDC-I4 with the corresponding transition metal salts in MeOH (for 1–4) or MeOH/DMF (for 5) at room temperature and structurally characterized. In addition, the luminescent properties of 1 and 2 in the solid state will also be discussed. Experimental All chemicals were commercially available and used as received. The Fourier transform IR spectra (KBr pellets) were taken on a Nicolet ESP 460 FT-IR spectrometer in the range of 4,000–400 cm-1. Elemental analyses were per- formed on a PE–2400II (Perkin-Elmer) analyzer. Ther- mogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 25–800 C on a Dupont thermal analyzer under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 C min-1. Luminescence spectra in the solid state were measured at room temperature on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer.

After stirring for 25 min, the reaction solution was ﬁltered and left to stand at room temperature.

X-ray crystallography Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements of 1–5 were taken on a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer at the ambient temperature with MoKa radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ). In each case, a semiempirical absorption correction was applied using SADABS, and the program SAINT was used for the integration of the diffraction proﬁles [35]. The structures were solved by the direct methods using SHELXS program of SHELXTL packages and reﬁned anisotropically for all non- hydrogen atoms by full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL program [36]. C-bound hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positionsby using a riding model. O-bound hydrogen atoms were ﬁrstly localized by difference Fourier maps and then ﬁxed geometrically with isotropic temperature factors. Further, crystallographic data and structural reﬁnement parameters are summarized in Table 1, and the selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. Results and discussion Synthesis and general characterization Continuing our effort toward the formation and design of new coordination frameworks with polyhalogen-substi- tuted benzenedicarboxylate ligands [28, 30, 32], we thought that the tetraiodo-substituted tecton bearing four bulky iodine groups may be of interest for the formation of coordination networks when associated with connecting transition metal ions. In this work, two different routes were applied through changing the transition metal ions and solvent media. Complexes 1–4 were prepared from the reactions of H2BDC-I4 with different transition metal ions (ZnII for 1, CdII for 2, CoII for 3, and MnII for 4) under Table 1 Crystallographic data and structural reﬁnement summary for complexes 1–5 Complex 1 2 3 4 5 Empirical formula C22H26ZnI8O14 C22H26CdI8O14 C22H26CoI8O14 C22H26I8MnO14 C15H23I4MnNO9 Formula weight 1595.02 1642.04 1588.56 1584.57 923.88 Crystal size (mm3) 0.26 9 0.24 9 0.24 0.30 9 0.28 9 0.28 0.22 9 0.20 9 0.20 0.24 9 0.22 9 0.20 0.28 9 0.26 9 0.22 Crystal system Triclinic Triclinic Triclinic Triclinic Monoclinic Space group P1 P1 P1 P1 P21/c a (A˚ ) 9.601(2) 9.6553(8) 9.6110(5) 9.6199(9) 13.642(1) b (A˚ ) 9.989(2) 10.2252(8) 10.0099(5) 10.1033(9) 8.717(1) c (A˚ ) 10.919(2) 10.9908(9) 10.9078(5) 10.939(1) 25.437(2) a () 102.779(3) 103.799(1) 102.811(1) 103.169(2) 90.00 b () 97.358(3) 97.002(2) 97.302(1) 96.954(2) 122.062(4) c () 109.478(3) 108.937(1) 109.399(1) 109.183(2) 90.00 V (A˚ 3) 939.4(3) 973.0(1) 941.90(8) 955.3(2) 2563.4(5) Z 1 1 1 1 4 Dcalc (mg m-3) 2.820 2.802 2.801 2.754 2.394 l (mm-1) 7.284 6.962 7.068 6.865 5.374 F(000) 724 742 721 719 1,716 Total reﬂections 5,166 5,352 5,258 5,248 13,789 Independent reﬂections 3,254 3,428 3,242 3,311 4,499 Rint 0.0262 0.0275 0.0157 0.0208 0.0547 Goodness of ﬁt on F2 1.031 1.026 1.096 1.075 1.077 Final R indices [I [ 2r(I)] R1 = 0.0291, wR2 = 0.0871 R1 = 0.0287, wR2 = 0.0963 R1 = 0.0237, wR2 = 0.0633 R1 = 0.0300, wR2 = 0.1007 R1 = 0.0354, wR2 = 0.0882 R indices (all data) R1 = 0.0352, wR2 = 0.1234 R1 = 0.0346, wR2 = 0.1361 R1 = 0.0291, wR2 = 0.0654 R1 = 0.0405, wR2 = 0.1587 R1 = 0.0544, wR2 = 0.1295 Residuals (e A˚ -3) 1.281, -1.383 1.478, -1.454 0.543, -0.869 2.194, -2.191 1.930, -2.255 Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:619–627 621 123 similar reaction conditions. The results of X-ray crystal- lographic analysis revealed that compounds 1–4 are isostructural and display similar 1-D coordination frame- works, highlighting the ligand-directed assemblies. When the solvent DMF was added into the reaction system of 4, the crystalline product of 5 with a different structure was obtained, indicating the solvent-regulated synthesis. All these complexes are air stable and were characterized by elemental analyses and IR spectra. For the IR spectra of 1– 5, the broad bands centered at ca. 3,440 cm-1 indicate the O–H stretching frequencies. The antisymmetric and sym- metric stretching vibrations of carboxylate are found in the range of 1,590–1,640 cm-1 and 1,380–1,450 cm-1, respectively. In addition, the strong peak at ca. 1,705 cm-1 in the IR spectra of 1–4 reveals the presence of the free H2BDC-I4 ligand, which is also conﬁrmed by the X-ray single-crystal structure analysis. Crystal structure of {[M(BDC-I4)(MeOH)4](H2BDC-I4)- (MeOH)2}n (M = ZnII for 1, CdII for 2, CoII for 3, and MnII for 4) Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that com- plexes 1–4 are isostructural (see Table 1) and thus herein, only the crystal structure of 4 is described in detail. Complex 4 crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. In the asymmetric unit of 4, there exists one MnII ion, one completely deprotonated BDC-I4 dianion, and one lattice- free H2BDC-I4, which all lie on inversion centers, as well as four MeOH ligands, and two guest MeOH molecules. As shown in Fig. 1a, the octahedral sphere of the MnII center is provided by two carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1 and O1A) from two trans BDC-I4 dianions and four oxygen atoms (O3, O3A, O4, and O4A) from four terminal MeOH molecules.

Each BDC-I4 dianion takes the l1-g1:g0-monodentate coordination mode for each carbox- ylate group, to bridge two adjacent MnII ions. As a con- sequence, the MnII ions are extended by the BDC-I4 spacers to afford a 1-D chain almost along the [010] direction (see Fig. 1b), within which the distance between successive MnII ions is 11.4345(8) A˚ . Within the BDC-I4 dianionic entity, two carboxylate groups are inclined to the tetraiodinated central benzene ring with a dihedral angle of 81.1(6) due to the steric hindrance of the bulk iodine atoms located at the ortho positions of carboxylate, which is similar to those of other carboxylate compounds with a polyiodinated backbone [37, 38]. With respect to the non- binding H2BDC-I4 guest, it works as a linker to fabricate a supramolecular layer by connecting two neighboring par- allel coordination chains through intermolecular O–HO hydrogen bonds (O6–H6O2, see Fig. 1c; Table 3) with the uncoordinated carboxylate O2 atoms of BDC-I4, which is also consolidated by H-bonding involving guest metha- nol (O7–H7O2 and O7–H7O5, see Table 3). Further, such layers showing a parallel arrangement are connected by interlayer C11–H11BI2 and O6–H6I1 (see Table 3) interactions to generate a 3-D supramolecular network (see Fig. 1d). Additionally, the weak edge-to-face C–Ip [C10–I4BCg1ii (Cg1 = C2–C4, C2A–C4A): I4Cg1, 3.651(4) A˚ ; C10Cg1, 5.341(1) A˚ ; ii = x - 1, y - 1, z] intermolecular interactions are found to stabilize this 3-D framework. Crystal structure of {[Mn(BDC-I4)(MeOH)4](DMF)}n (5) X-ray single-crystal study demonstrates that compound 5 crystallizes in the space group P21/c. The asymmetric unit of 5 consists of two crystallographically independent MnII centers, one completely deprotonated BDC-I4 dianion, four MeOH ligands, and one guest DMF molecule. As depicted in Fig. 2a, the coordination spheres for the distorted octa- hedral Mn1 and Mn2 are quite similar and are composed of two oxygen donors from two BDC-I4 ligands and four oxygen atoms from four terminal MeOH molecules. The Mn–O distances range from 2.076(4) to 2.226(7) A˚ , and Table 3 Possible hydrogen- bonding geometries in the crystal structures of 1–5 Complex D–HA HA (A˚ ) DA (A˚ ) D–HA () Symmetry code 1 O3–H3O2 2.08 2.78(1) 143 O4–H4O7 1.97 2.69(1) 147 O6–H6O2 1.87 2.665(9) 162 x, y ? 1, z O7–H7I4 2.62 3.119(8) 121 x ? 1, y, z C6–H6CI1 3.06 3.97(1) 160 -x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z ? 1 C11–H11BO5 2.58 3.42(2) 147 -x, -y ? 1, -z 2 O3–H3O7 1.95 2.69(1) 149 -x, -y, -z ? 1 O4–H4O2 2.36 2.92(1) 126 -x, -y, -z ? 1 O7–H7O2 2.41 3.01(1) 130 O7–H7O5 2.34 2.98(2) 136 C6–H6I1 2.92 3.679(7) 155 3 O3–H3O2 2.11 2.803(6) 142 O4–H4O7 1.90 2.709(6) 168 O6–H6O2 1.81 2.628(5) 175 x, y ? 1, z O7–H7O2 2.49 3.003(5) 122 -x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z ? 1 O7–H7O5 2.16 2.899(6) 150 -x ? 1, -y ? 2, -z ? 1 4 O4–H4O7 1.90 2.70(1) 165 O6–H6O2 1.94 2.65(1) 143 -x ? 1, -y, -z O7–H7O2 2.45 3.00(1) 125 O7–H7O5 2.22 2.94(1) 146 -x ? 1, -y, -z C11–H11BI2 3.03 3.91(2) 155 x, y, z - 1 5 O8–H8O9 1.86 2.64(1) 158 O9–H9I4 2.83 3.12(1) 103 -x ? 1, y ? 1/2, -z ? 1/2 O6–H6I1 2.94 3.69(1) 155 -x ? 1, -y ? 1, -z ? 1 O7–H7O4 1.96 2.75(1) 161 624 Transition Met Chem (2012) 37:619–627 123 the O–Mn–O bond angles are in the range of 85.2(2)– 180.0(1). Each BDC-I4 ligand, adopting a l1-g1:g0- monodentate coordination mode for each carboxylate group, joins neighboring MnII centers into a 1-D linear chain, as depicted in Fig. 2b, within which the adjacent Mn1Mn2 separation is 10.779(1) A˚ , and the closest MnMn separation between the neighboring strands is 8.094(1) A˚ . Within each BDC-I4 ligand, the rotation angles between the carboxylate groups and the tetraiodinated central benzene ring are 79.9(3) and 84.3(2), respectively. Intramolecular O7–H7O4 and O6–H6I1 interactions (further, hydrogen bond parameters are listed in Table 3) have been found to stabilize such 1-D coordi- nation motifs. Notably, the coordinated methanol molecule is involved in a strong intermolecular hydrogen bond (O8– H8O9i, HO/OO distances: 1.86/2.642(7) A˚ , angle: 158, i = -x ? 1, y ? 1/2, -z ? 1/2) to the lattice DMF molecule. Meanwhile, such 1-D coordination arrays are distributed in parallel along the [001] direction and inter- connected by intermolecular O9–H9I4 (see Table 3 for Fig. 2 View of (a) the coordination environment of the MnII centers in 5.

Thermal stability To investigate the thermal stabilities of complexes 1–5, TGA measurements were taken from room temperature to 800 C. The corresponding curves are depicted in Fig. 3. The TGA curves of 1–4 are similar for their isostructural nature. The ﬁrst two weight losses in the range of 40–185 C indicate the exclusion of coordinated methanol and DMF molecules, and the corresponding weight losses were 11.7 % (calculated: 12.1 %) for 1, 12.2 % (calcu- lated: 11.7 %) for 2, 11.1 % (calculated: 12.1 %) for 3, and 10.9 % (calculated: 12.1 %) for 4, respectively. The residual solids start to decompose beyond 250 C in three consecutive steps of weight losses, which do not stop until heating to 800 C. For 5, the ﬁrst weight loss of 19.7 % (calculated: 21.8 %), occurring from 45 to 200 C, corre- sponds to the release of lattice DMF guests and coordinated methanol molecules. Subsequently, pyrolysis of the resid- ual coordination framework is observed upon heating to 265 C with a sharp weight loss, and further heating to 800 C reveals a gradual weight loss of the sample. Photoluminescence property Due to the excellent luminescent properties of d10 metal complexes, solid-state ﬂuorescent spectra of the polymeric ZnII (for 1) and CdII (for 2) complexes as well as the free ligand H2BDC-I4 were recorded at room temperature (see Fig. 4). The free ligand exhibits an emission maximum at 474 nm upon excitation at 336 nm, which could be ascribed to the p ? p* and/or n ? p* transitions. For complexes 1 and 2, the maximum emission bands are similarly observed at 472 nm for 1 and 471 nm for 2 (kex = 336 nm), respec- tively, which are tentatively attributed to the ligand-centered transitions. Furthermore, the effective enhancement of the luminescence intensity for 1 and 2 may be assigned to the increased rigidity of the deprotonated ligand upon com- plexation that reduces the nonradiative decay of the intrali- gand (p ? p*) excited state [39, 40]. Conclusion This work presents the preparation, crystal structures, and properties of a series of new ZnII, CdII, CoII, and MnII coordination polymers with a periodinated benzenedicar- boxylate tecton BDC-I4. Apparently, the steric demands of the bulky iodine groups enforce the formation of isostruc- tural 1-D coordination chains that are independent of the metal used. However, the solvent used in the preparations plays a signiﬁcant role in the resulting host–guest supra- molecular networks, which are also stabilized by intermo- lecular halogen bonding and related Ip interactions. The current results may offer new insights into crystal engi- neering of coordination crystalline materials based on hal- ogenated benzenedicarboxylate ligands and transition metal ions, and further systematic investigation of the substituent effect for organic building blocks on structural construction of related supramolecular systems are ongoing.
