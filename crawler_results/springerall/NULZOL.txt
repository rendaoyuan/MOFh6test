The H2dtba ligand came from the in situ S–S function reaction of 2-mercaptobenzoic acid (H2mba) under the hydrothermal condition. Complex 1 is a 2D bamboo-like sqr-topology layered structure, and the 3D (4, 4, 6)-connected supramolecular frameworks is produced by the hydrogen bonds of O–HO. Complexes of type II (from 2a to 2g) are isostructural and they are assigned to 1D rope-like chains by introducing the chelating ligand of diimidazole. These 1D rope-like chains are further linked by N–HO hydrogen bonds into a 3D supramolecular framework with CdSO4-type topology. Photoluminescence studies reveal that complexes 2b, 2c, 2d, 2f, 2g exhibit strong lanthanide characteristic emission bands in the solid state at room temperature. Keywords In situ reaction  2, 20-Dithiodibenzoic acid  Lanthanide complexes  Luminescent property 1 Introduction Rational design and construction of metal–organic supra- molecular complexes with various multifunctional ligands have attracted enormous attention owing to their intriguing architectures and topologies, as well as potential applica- tions in many ﬁelds, such as catalysis, magnetism and gas absorption [1–8]. Therefore, choosing or designing the suitable ligands with certain features is signiﬁcant for us. Compared with the rigid ligands, the skew and versatile coordination orientation of the ﬂexible multidentate ligands is favorable for constructing novel structures [9]. 2, 20- Dithiodibenzoic acid (H2dtba) ligand, formed via the in situ S–S function reaction of 2-mercaptobenzoic acid (H2mba) under the hydrothermal conditions, is a good choice due to the ﬂexible and multifunctional coordination sites, more- over, the phenyl rings can be well twisted at different degrees across the C–S and S–S single bond sites for the steric effect when they react with different metal salts, leading to the formation of the novel frameworks with high dimension. Obviously, in situ synthesis of the ligand is often a serendipitous process, in which the intended ligands undergoes redox or other chemical reactions to produce a modiﬁed ligands which react with metal directly to gen- erate single crystals of novel coordination complexes [10– 13]. In situ synthesis, as an attractive synthetic route in coordination chemistry and organic chemistry, has the following four beneﬁts: (a) In situ ligand synthesis opens the possibility of novel ligand generation and simultaneous metal coordination; (b) In some cases, it may be a simple Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10904-014-0027-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Lanthanide complexes have been attracted a lot of attention due to their potential applications in ﬂuorescence materials, magnetic properties and medical ﬁelds [15–19], and also the lanthanide ions often display high and variable coordination. It is known that lanthanide ions have high afﬁnity for oxygen donor atoms and possess high coordi- nation numbers [20, 21]. H2dtba ligand is a good ligand for the preparation of metal–organic complexes because of its ﬂexibility and more donor O atoms. Up to now, H2dtba, as a ﬂexible multidentate ligand, has been used in the con- struction of metal–organic supramolecular complexes with both single transition metal and alkali metal ions as nodes [22–26]. However, the lanthanide-organic complexes of H2dtba remain largely unexplored. Herein, we reported two new types of the lanthanide-organic complexes of H2dtba for the ﬁrst time, namely [Yb(dtba)(Hdtba)]n (Type I, 1), [Ln(dtba)1.5(biim)]n [Type II: Ln = Pr (2a), Nd (2b), Sm (2c), Eu (2d), Gd (2e), Tb (2f), Dy (2g)], respectively. The H2dtba ligand of these lanthanide complexes comes from the in situ S–S function reaction of 2-mercaptobenzoic acid (H2mba) under the hydrothermal conditions. In type I complex, H2dtba ligands bridge Yb3? cations to generate 2D lattice (4, 4) layers, which are linked by N–HO hydrogen bonds, resulting in 3D unique (4, 4, 6)-connected supramolecular network with the point symbol of (42.84)(44.62)2 (48.66.8)2. Complexes of type II (from 2a to 2g) with diimidazole as auxiliary ligand, are all 1D rope- like chain structures which are further linked by N–HO hydrogen bonds into 3D supra-molecular frameworks with CdSO4-type topology. The thermal stability and applica- tion properties as the potential luminescent material of these lanthanide-organic frameworks have also been stud- ies by the thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and lumi- nescent properties. 2 Experimental 2.1 Instruments and Materials All starting chemicals and solvents for synthesis were commercially available and used as received without fur- ther puriﬁcation. The IR spectra were recorded in the range 400–4,000 cm-1 on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 2000 FT-IR Fourier transform spectrometer with pressed KBr pellets. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recor- ded on a PANalytical X’pert Pro diffractometer equipped with Cu Ka radiation (k = 1.5406 A˚ ) at room temperature. The C, H and N elemental analyses were performed with an Elementar Vario EL III elemental analyzer. Thermo- gravimetric analyses were recorded in Perkin-Elmer TGA 7 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 C/min. The 2D- COS IR correlation spectra were recorded in the same instrument equipped with temperature controller (Model 50–886, Love Control Corporation) which worked in the temperature from 323 to 393 K at intervals of 10 K and the results were analyzed with 2D-COS IR correlation analysis software provided by Tsinghua University. The steady ﬂuorescence spectra with solid sample of complexes 2 (from 2a to 2g) were obtained on Edinburgh-Instrument Spectra- Fluorimeter. 2.2 Synthesis and Characterization 2.2.1 Synthesis of [Yb (dtba)(Hdtba)]n (Type I: 1) 2-Mercaptobenzoic acid (H2mba) (0.2 mmol, 0.0308 g) and Yb2O3 (0.2 mmol, 0.0788 g) were added to 10 ml distilled water.

The diffraction points of I [ 2r(I) were selected to determine the structures of com- plexes 1 and 2a–2d, and solved by direct methods and reﬁned by full-matrix least-squares methods using the SHELXS and SHELXL programs of SHELX 97 crystal- lographic software package [27, 28]. All metal atoms, total or partial of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and sulfur were reﬁned with anisotropic thermal parameters on F2. Hydrogen atoms except those of lattice water were gener- ated theoretically onto the speciﬁc atoms with bond dis- tance restraints of 0.95 A˚ for O–H and 0.86 A˚ for C–H, and reﬁned with isotropic thermal parameters riding on the parent atoms. CCDC 971666 (1), 971,664 (2a), 971663 (2b) 971665 (2c) and 971662 (2d) have contained the supplementary Crystallographic details. These data can be obtained free of charge at www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/conts/ retrieving.html. The crystallographic data and structural reﬁnement parameters for 1 and 2a–2d are summarized in Table 1. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Descriptions of Structure 3.1.1 Structure of [Yb (dtba)(Hdtba)]n (Type I: 1) Single crystal X-ray analysis reveals that complex 1 crys- tallizes in the triclinic system, P-1 space group, The asymmetric unit of 1 contains two types of independent Yb(III) (Yb1 and Yb2) with the occupancy of 0.5, one Hdtba- and one dtba2- ligand (Fig. 1). The Yb1 and Yb2 atoms lying in the inversion centers, both adopt octahedral geometry with Yb–O bond lengths varying from 2.1735 (8) to 2.2675 (8) A˚ and O–Yb-O bond angles changing from 84.24 (2) to 92.76 (2) . The completely deprotonated dtba2- ligand adopts l4-(g1:g1:g1:g1) coordination mode linking four Yb centers in four monodentate bridging modes, while the partly deprotonated Hdtba- behaves as l2-(g1:g1) coordination mode connecting two Yb atoms in two monodentate modes (Scheme 1a, b and Fig. S1). The dtba2- and Hdtba- ligands both adopt nearly orthogonal conformations with a –C–S–S–C– torsion angle of 85.10 (3) and 93.20 (3)  by the in situ S–S function bond, respectively. The Yb1 and Yb2 centers are alternately bridged by three carboxylate groups from two dtba2- and one Hdtba- ligands, generating a 1D intertwining rope-like chain running along a axis (Fig. S2). The adjacent chains are linked by dtba2- ligands to form a 2D bamboo-like layer in the ab plane (Fig. 2a, b). From the topological point of view, the 2-D layer of 1 is a 4-connected net. All Yb atoms and dtba2- ligands act as four-connected nodes. The net is sqr-typed topology with the point symbol of (44.62) which is calculated by TOPOS 4.0 (Fig. 2c, d). Hdtba- ligands are attached to the 2D layer as branches by bridging carboxlate groups above or below the layer. The 2D layers stack in –AAA- mode along the [0–11] direction. The O–HO hydrogen bonds [O8O7,2.661 (8) A˚ ] between the Hdtba- ligands link the adjacent layers into a 3-D supramolecular framework (Fig. 3a). Topologically, the 3D supra-molecular framework can be regarded as a 3-nodal (4, 4, 6)-connected net. A pair of Hdtba- ligands server as four-connected node, each dtba2- ligand func- tions as four-connected node and every Yb atom acts as a six-connected node in the ratio 1:2:2. The point symbol of the 3D net is (42.84)(44.62)2(48.66.8)2 whose topological type is 4,4,6T6 (MOF.ttd) (Fig. 3b). 3.1.2 Structure of [Ln(dtba)1.5(biim)]n [Type II : Ln = Pr (2a), Nd (2b), Sm (2c), Eu (2d), Gd (2e), Tb (2f), Dy (2g)] Complexes of 2a–2g are isomorphous and crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2/c. Therefore, only the structure of 2d is described in detail. Single-crystal X-ray analysis reveals that complexes 2d is described as 1-D columnar- like structure running along c axis. The asymmetric unit of 2d contains one Eu(III) ion, one and a half dtba2- ligands and one bimm ligand. The coordination geometry for the nine-coordinate Eu3? ion is close to that of a tricapped trigonal prism with two nitrogen atoms from biim ligand and seven oxygen atoms from ﬁve dtba2- ligands (Fig. 4). The Eu–O bond lengths fall in the regions 2.344 (3)–2.796 (3) A˚ , and the Eu–N bond lengths are 2.548 (5) and 2.573 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:633–643 635 123 Table 1 The crystallographic data and structural reﬁnement parameters for 1 and 2a–2d 1 2a 2b Empirical formula C28H17O8S4Yb C27H18N4PrO6S3 C27H18N4NdO6S3 Formula weight 782.70 731.54 734.87 Temperature (K) 293 (2) 293 (2) 293 (2) Wavelength (A˚ ) 0.71073 0.71073 0.71073 Crystal system Triclinic Monoclinic, Monoclinic Space group P-1 C2/c C2/c Unit cell dimensions (A˚ , ) a 8.9435 (18) 19.714 (7) 19.750 (4) b 10.941 (2) 11.312 (4) 11.345 (2) c 15.688 (3) 23.775 (10) 23.820 (5) a 94.36 (3) 90 90 b 92.60 (3) 91.97 (2) 91.95 (3) c 110.03 (3) 90 90 Volume (A˚ 3), Z 1,433.9 (5), 2 5,299 (3), 8 5,334.4 (19), 8 Dc (g/cm3) 1.813 1.834 1.830 F(000) 766 2,904 2,912 Limiting indices -11 B h B 11; -14 B k B 12; -20 B l B 20 -22 B h B 25; -14 B k B 14; -30 B l B 28 -22 B h B 25; -14 B k B 14; -30 B l B 23 Reﬂections collected 12,080 20,595 21,923 Independent reﬂections [R(int) = 0.0490] 6,313 [R(int) = 0.1382] 5,695 [R(int) = 0.0444] 5,962 Goodness-of-ﬁt on F2 1.082 1.018 1.209 Final R indices [I [ 2r(I)] R1 = 0.0512, wR2 = 0.1431 R1 = 0.0699, wR2 = 0.1642 R1 = 0.0483, wR2 = 0.0992 R indices (all data) R1 = 0.0617, wR2 = 0.1530 R1 = 0.1413, wR2 = 0.2149 R1 = 0.0549, wR2 = 0.1028 2c 2d Empirical formula C27H18N4SmO6S3 C27H18N4EuO6S3 Formula weight 740.98 742.59 Temperature (K) 293 (2) 293 (2) Wavelength (A˚ ) 0.71073 0.71073 Crystal system Monoclinic, Monoclinic, Space group C2/c C2/c Unit cell dimensions (A˚ , ) a 19.641 (4) 19.599 (4) b 11.347 (2) 11.347 (2) c 23.770 (5) 23.735 (5) a 90 90 b 92.22 (3) 92.31 (3) c 90 90 Volume (A˚ 3), Z 5,293.5 (18), 8 5,276.2 (18), 8 Dc (g/cm3) 1.860 1.870 F(000) 2,928 2,936 Limiting indices -25 B h B 25; -10 B k B 14; -30 B l B 30 -23 B h B 25; -10 B k B 14; -30 B l B 30 Reﬂections collected 21,741 21,559 Independent reﬂections [R(int) = 0.0454] 6,067 [R(int) = 0.0551] 6,056 Goodness-of-ﬁt on F2 1.198 1.209 Final R indices [I [ 2r(I)] R1 = 0.0480, wR2 = 0.0888 R1 = 0.0427, wR2 = 0.1508 R indices (all data) R1 = 0.0550, wR2 = 0.0917 R1 = 0.0462, wR2 = 0.1546 636 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:633–643 123 (4) A˚ . The dtba2- adopts two kinds of distinctly different bridging modes: one behaves as a l4-dtba mode linking four Eu atoms (Scheme 1a), which is observed in 1; the other acts as l5-dtba mode connecting ﬁve Eu atoms in a bis(bidentate) and a monodentate modes (Scheme 1c and Fig. S3). Two central-symmetric Eu atoms are bridged by two l2-O atoms of two l5-dtba ligands to form a [Eu2O2] rhombic unit. Two biim ligands are attached to the vertices of the rhombic unit by coordinating to the Eu atoms to give a secondary building unit (SBU) of [Eu2O2bimm] (Fig. S4). The adjacent SBUs are simultaneously bridged by three dtba2- ligands to generate a 1D columnar-like structure running along c axis, which is composed of three zigzag chains (Fig. 5a). These columns are packed along [100] and [010] directions, and held together further by the interchain hydrogen bond of N–HO interactions between Scheme 1 Coordination modes of H2dtba in type I and type II compounds Fig. 1 The asymmetric unit of complex 1 drawn at 50 % probability level, all the hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity, symmetry codes: A: -1-x, -y, 1-z; B: -1?x, -1?y, z; C: -x, 1-y, 1-z; D: 1-x, 1-y, 1-z; E: -x, -y, 1-z; F: 1?x, y, z.

The broad bands at 3,478–3,058 cm-1 for type I and 3,344–3,131 cm-1 for type II indicate the presence of O–H and N–H, respectively, and existence of hydrogen bonding interactions in type I and type II com- plexes. The disappearance of S–H stretching vibration over 2,500 cm-1 and the existence of S–S stretching vibration at 851 cm-1 in type I and 853 cm-1 in type II indicate that 2-mercaptobenzoic acid (H2mba) has been changed to 2,20- dithiodibenzoic acid (H2dtba) ligand via the in situ S–S function reaction in type I and type II complexes. These facts are consistent with the XRD results. 3.4 Thermo-gravimetric Analysis To explore the thermal stability of these materials, thermal analyses were carried out from 30 C to 650 C for type I and 30 C to 1,000 C for type II under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 7). Complex 1 is stable until the tem- perature reaches 414 C. The weight loss of 67.47 % (calcd, 67.39 %) in the temperature of 414–550 C can be assigned to the release of dtba2- ligands.

This method is a practical and effective measure in the dynamic analysis [31, 32]. With 2D-IR COS, it is possible to clearly describe the molecular dynamic mech- anism in certain conditions [33–35]. In this paper, in order to clarify the structural changes of compounds type I and type II more efﬁciently, 2D correlation spectra of them were showed. Fig. 8 depicts the synchronous 2D IR correlation spectra of 1 over a tem- perature range from 50 to 120 C. As showed in Fig. 8, in 1,350–1,700 cm-1, four strong auto-peaks were observed along the diagonal at 1,411, 1,566, 1,588 and 1,673 cm-1 with heat perturbation, which demonstrates that the inten- sity changes of the ms(C=O), mas(C=O), m(ph) and mas(COOH) are sensitive to heat perturbation. The sensitive response of ms(C=O) and mas(C=O), originates from the OCOO- coordinated to the Yb3? which makes the electron density of C = O lower. But the response of mas(COOH) are due to the O–HO hydrogen bonds between the Hdtba to decrease the electron density of C = O of COOH. In the region between 3,000 and 3,600 cm-1, the synchronous and asynchronous plot are dominated by the very strong auto-peak at 3,400 m-1,which is assigned to the the stretching vibra- tions of O–H bands are sensitive to heat perturbation due to the weak O–HO interaction. The strong auto-peaks at 1,387 and 1,583 cm-1 along the diagonal line in the syn- chronous spectra of type II are assigned to temperature- induced stretching vibrations of C = O coordinating to the Ln(III) centers (Fig. 9). The sensitive response of the C = O stretching vibrations originate from the effect of N– HO hydrogen bonds. The thermal measurements by 2D- IR COS for type I and type II complexes are in good agreement with the structural analyses. 3.5 Luminescent Properties Due to the excellent luminescent properties of lanthanide complexes, the photoluminescent spectra of 2b(Nd), 2c(Sm), 2d(Eu), 2f(Tb) and 2g(Dy) were measured in the solid state. The compounds of 2b(Nd), 2d(Eu) and 2f(Tb) exhibit the characteristic emission of Ln(III) ions; while the compounds of 2c(Sm) and 2g(Dy) exhibit the characteristic emission of Ln(III) ions and ﬂuorescence of intraligand p*- p transition, indicates that the energy transfer is incomplete in 2c(Sm) and 2g(Dy). When complex 2c(Sm) was excited at 360 nm, it exhibits a typical Sm3?emission spectra and one broad band (Fig. 10a). The emission at 563, 601 and 645 nm is attributed to the characteristic emission of 4G5/2 ? 6H5/2, 4G5/2 ? 6H7/2 and 4G5/2 ? 6H9/2 transition, respectively. In addition, the broad band ranging from 450 to 550 nm may be attributed to the LLCT (Ligand-to-ligand charge transfer) luminescence of p* ? p transition. Complex 2g(Dy) also exhibits the typical Dy3? emission spectra and ﬂuorescent emission band of ligand-centered p* ? p transition, which overlap each other (Fig. 10b). The emission at 482, 576 and 657 nm is attributed to the characteristic emission of 4F9/2 ? 6HJ (J = 15/2, 13/2 and 11/2) transition of the Dy3?. The other emission bands with Fig. 7 The TGA curves of 1 and 2 under N2 atmosphere 640 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:633–643 123 Fig. 8 The thermal-induced 2D-IR COS spectra for 1((a), (b), (c) and (d)) with the temperature range from 50 C to 120 C Fig. 9 The synchronous 2D correlation spectra of 2a(a), 2b(b), 2d(c), 2f(d) in the range of 1350–1600 cm-1 with the temperature from 50 C to 120 C J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:633–643 641 123 a maximum around 460 nm originates from the ligand centered p* ? p transition. Compound 2b(Nd) displays characteristic emission bands of Nd(III) in the near-infrared region (kEx = 580 nm) (Fig. 11a). The emission of 2b(Nd) consisted of the three f ? f transition bands at 985, 1,066, 1,340 nm, which are attributed to the transitions of 4F3/2 ? 4I9/2, 4F3/2 ? 4I11/2 and 4F3/2 ? 4I13/2, respectively. Upon excitation at 394 nm, complex 2d(Eu) displays intense red luminescence and exhibits the characteristic transition of 5D0 ? 7FJ (J = 0–4) of the Eu(III) ions (kEx = 580 nm) (Fig. 11b). The most intense emission at 618 nm is attributed to 5D0 ? 7F2 tran- sition induced by electric dipole, suggesting that the interac- tions between the complex and its local environment are strong [36] and that the Hdtba ligand generated from the in situ reaction is favorable for the red luminescence for Eu(III) ions under the experimental conditions used [37]. The medium strong emission at 590 and 700 nm are correspond- ing to the magnetic dipole induced 5D0 ? 7F1 transition and the electric dipole induced 5D0 ? 7F4 transition, respec- tively. The intensity of the5D0 ? 7F2 transition (electric dipole) is clearly stronger than that of the 5D0 ? 7F1 transi- tion (magnetic dipole), the intensity ratio of 8.6 for I (5D0 ? 7F2)/I (5D0 ? 7F1) indicates that the coordination environment of the Eu(III) ions is asymmetric, which is conﬁrmed by the crystallographic analysis. The luminescence Fig. 10 The emission spectra of 2c(Sm) and 2g(Dy) in solid state at room temperature Fig. 11 The emission spectra of 2b(Nd), 2d(Eu) and 2f(Tb) in solid state at room temperature 642 J Inorg Organomet Polym (2014) 24:633–643 123 decay curve of 2d(Eu) at room temperature is well ﬁt into a bi-exponential function as I = A ? B1 9 exp(-t/s1) ? B2 9 exp(-t/s2). The emission decay lifetimes of compound 2d(Eu) are s1 = 89.3 ls and s2 = 25.6 ls (45.90 %) (v2 = 0.994). Complex 2f(Tb) exhibits the characteristic transition of 5D4 ? 7FJ (J = 3–6) of the Tb(III) ions (Fig. 11c). Two intense emission bands at 491 and 545 nm correspond to 5D4 ? 7F6 and 5D4 ? 7F5 while the weaker emission bands at 585 and 622 nm originate from 5D4 ? 7F4 and 5D4 ? 7F3 transition, respectively. No emission bands from the ligands are observed in 2b(Nd), 2d(Eu) and 2f(Tb), indicating that ligands transfer the excitation energy efﬁ- ciently to the Nd(III), Eu(III) and Tb(III). 4 Conclusion A series of novel lanthanide-organic coordination polymers based on the 2, 20-dithiodibenzoic acid ligand have been synthesized by the hydrothermal method, and characterized by single-crystal XRD along with XRD, IR, UV and ﬂuorescent analysis. Interestingly, 2, 20-dithiodibenzoic acid came from the in situ S–S function reaction of 2-mercaptobenzoic acid (H2mba) under the hydrothermal conditions. The synthesis of situ ligands is proﬁtable due to the simplicity of one-pot synthesis and its potential to be friendly to our environment than traditional synthetic routes. Type I complex contains a 2D sqr-typed bamboo- like layer, which are linked via O–HO hydrogen bonds interactions to generate a 3D (4, 4, 6)-connected supra- molecular framework with the point symbol of (42.84)(44.62)2(48.66.8)2. Type II complexes are iso-struc- tural and possess 1D columnar-like structures, which are composed of three zigzag chains. These 1D columns are held together further by the interchain hydrogen bond of N–HO interactions, resulting in a 3D supra-molecular framework with cds-topology (CdSO4) net. Photolumi- nescence investigation suggested the ligand ﬁelds at these centers are different. For 2b(Nd), 2d(Eu) and 2f (Tb), the efﬁcient energy transfers from ligands to the Ln(III) ions were observed, which result in intense characteristic emission of Ln(III) ions. In contrast, 2c(Sm) and 2g(Dy) both display broad bonds and characteristic emission of Ln(III) ions, indicating that the energy transfer is incom- plete in 2c and 2g. The photoluminescent emission of compound 2b(Nd), 2d(Eu) and 2f(Tb) indicates that these lanthanide-organic coordination polymers may be good candidates for optical materials.
