Manuscript & Magnetic Properties Spin Frustration in a Family of Pillared Kagom Layers of High- Spin Cobalt(II) Ions Long-Fei Wang,[a] Cui-Jin Li,[a, b] Yan-Cong Chen,[a] Ze-Min Zhang,[a] Jiang Liu,[a] Wei- Quan Lin,[a] Yan Meng,[a] Quan-Wen Li,[a] and Ming-Liang Tong*[a] Abstract: Based on the analogous kagom [Co3(imda)2] layers (imda=imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate), a family of pillar- layered frameworks with the formula of [Co3(imda)2(L)3]·(L)n·xH2O (1: L=pyrazine, n=0, x=8; 2: L= 4,4’-bipyridine, n=1, x=8; 3: L=1,4-di(pyridin-4-yl)benzene, n=1, x=13; 4: L=4,4’-di(pyridin-4-yl)-1,1’-biphenyl, n=1, x=14) have been successfully synthesized by a hydrother- mal/solvothermal method. Single-crystal structural analysis shows a significant increase in the interlayer distances synchronized with the extension of the pillar ligands, namely, 7.092(3) (1), 10.921(6) (2), 14.780(5) (3), and 19.165(4)  (4). Despite the wrinkled kagom layers in com- plexes 2–4, comprehensive magnetic characterizations re- vealed weakening of interlayer magnetic interactions and an increase in the degree of frustration as the pillar ligand be- comes longer from 1 to 4; this leads to characteristic mag- netic ground states. For compound 4, which has the longest interlayer distance, the interlayer interaction is so weak that the magnetic properties observed within the range of tem- perature measured would correspond to the frustrated layer. Introduction Geometric spin frustration, which is an effective method for in- ducing macroscopic quantum states in electron systems, will arise when none of the nearest neighbor interactions can be satisfied simultaneously because of the special arrangement of spins.[1] The kagom lattice, which is characterized by a two-di- mensional array of corner-sharing triangles, presents an ideal structure to study frustration. In theory, a S=1/2 antiferromag- net with a kagom lattice has the greatest possibility of having an interesting magnetic ground state, which is a so-called reso- nating valence bond (RVB) or spin-liquid state that corresponds to no magnetic ordering, even at zero temperature.[2] However, when spin frustration is coupled with some pertur- bations, such as anisotropy, lattice disorder, next-nearest inter- actions, and higher S, exotic physical properties and ground states can be observed.[3] There have been extensive theoreti- cal and experimental investigations into the magnetic behavior of frustrated kagom antiferromagnetic systems when consid- ering one or more perturbations. For example, Rao et al. per- formed a theoretical calculation of the low-energy magnetic spectrum of a finite kagom lattice with different magnitudes of spin carriers and found that half-odd-integer spins led to the strongest frustration.[4] As synthesized by Nocera et al., pure-phase FeIII–jarosites with the formula of AxFe3(OH)6(SO4)2 (x=1 for A=Na+, K+, Rb+, Tl+, Ag+, and NH4 +; x=0.5 for A= Pb2+) displayed a weak field-induced ferromagnetic transition below the Nel temperature because of the role of Dzyaloshin- skii–Moriya (DM) interactions, resulting in anisotropy in the sys- tems.[5] Gao et al. presented a pillar-layered framework, [Co(N3)2(bpg)]·4/3DMF, with a kagom layer constructed from Co2+ ions and azido ligands with interesting re-entered mag- netic behavior.[6] Recently, we presented the preliminary characterization of two pillared, layered frameworks,[7] [Co3(imda)2(pyz)3]·8H2O (1; imda=imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate, pyz=pyrazine) and [Co3(imda)2(4,4’-bpy)3]·(4,4’-bpy)·8H2O (2; 4,4’-bpy=4,4’-bipyri- dine), with a similar frustrated kagom [Co3(imda)2] layer con- structed from corner-sharing [Co3(imda)] triangles. Although there have been extensive studies on 2D magnetic systems,[8] systemic investigations on the influence of interlayer magnetic interactions on 2D frustrated layers in this fascinating family are rare. Herein, we attempt to further replace the pillars by longer N,N-pillars of 1,4-dpb (1,4-dpb=1,4-di(pyridin-4-yl)ben- zene) and 4,4’-dpbp (4,4’-dpbp=4,4’-di(pyridin-4-yl)-1,1’-bi- phenyl; Scheme 1), and successfully synthesize two analogous pillared, layered frameworks, [Co3(imda)2(1,4-dpb)3]·(1,4- dpb)·13H2O (3) and [Co3(imda)2(4,4’-dpbp)3]·(4,4’-dpbp)·14H2O (4). Depending on the choice of pillar ligands, the interlayer spacing for the four structures differs from 7.092(3) to 19.165(4) . A detailed comparison of the structural and mag- [a] L.-F.

In addition, the combination of spin frustration and DM interactions that come from the wrin- kled layers results in a variety of magnetic ground states, namely, metamagnetism for 1 and 2 with different critical fields, the coexistence of spin glass and spin canting for 3, and the absence of ordering above 1.8 K for 4. Results and Discussion Structural characterization Single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed that complex 1 crystallized in the hexagonal space group P6/mmm, whereas complexes 2–4 crystallized in the triclinic space group P1¯ (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). All of them are built on neutral kagom [Co3(imda)2] layers (Figure 1c) and pillar ligands, but with notable differences. Because the structures of 1 and 2 have been previously described in detail,[7] herein we focus the discussion of complexes 3 and 4. The asymmetric unit of 3 contains 1.5 1,4-dpb linkers, 1 imda3 ion, and 3 CoII ions in distorted octahedral coordination geometry. Although the space groups of 2–4 are centrosymmetric, no inversion centers lie between the independent CoII ions, which makes asymmet- ric coupling possible. As shown in Figure 2a, there are two kinds of coordination spheres for the three CoII ions. Both Co1 and Co2 are chelated by two NO bidentate sites of imda3 at the equatorial posi- tions and two pyridyl N atoms at the axial positions; this leads to a [CoO2N4] environment (CoNimda=2.071(4)–2.076(3), Co N1,4-dpb=2.162(4)–2.191(4), CoO=2.103(4)–2.109(4) ). For Co3, two OO bidentate sites of imda3 occupy its equatorial positions to form a different [CoO4N2] environment (CoN= 2.161(5), CoO=2.042(3)–2.092(3) ]. The imda3 ion acts as a multidentate ligand, chelating 3 CoII ions with a Co···Co sepa- ration of 5.7809(4)–6.3190(4) , to form a triangular [CoII 3(imda)] unit and further extend to a 2D layer on the ab plane with magnetic kagom topology (Figure 1). The kagom layers are pillared by 1,4-dpb organic linkers along the c axis with a crisscross connecting model, resulting in a 3D pillar-layered framework (Figure 3c). The interlayer dis- tance in 3 is 14.780(5) , which is larger than 10.921(6)  in 2 and 7.092(3)  in 1. For 4, the asymmetric unit is isostructural with 3, except for the pillar ligands and different bond lengths and angles. The longest pillar ligand in this family, 4,4’-dpbp, results in an increase in the CoCo interlayer distance to 19.165(4) , which is rare among most pillar-layered frame- works without penetration. Analysis with the PLATON[10] pro- gram suggested that the open channels in the frameworks oc- cupied 41.5 and 43.8% of the crystal volumes for 3 and 4, re- spectively; these channels are filled with guest ligands and water molecules. To better understand the connectivity of the two structures, we performed topological analysis with the software TOPOS 4.0[9] and found the same connectivity for 3 Scheme 1. Structures of the organic ligands used as pillars herein; lengths and corresponding abbreviations are also indicated. Figure 1.

Two marked structural differences are observed among the four complexes. First, the interlayer distances in the four struc- tures are successfully controlled from 7.1  in 1 to 19.2  in 4, which is the direct effect of the increasing lengths of the pillar ligands. Second, the longer pillars also enable structural varia- tion of the kagom layers. In complex 1, the short and rigid li- gands are perfectly perpendicular to the flat kagom layers on the ab plane. When the layers are pillared by the extended li- gands in 2–4, the p–p interactions, along with the allowable bend of the pillars, result in the unparalleled linking mode and also in the wave-like [Co3(imda)2] layer for complexes 2–4 (Figure 5 and Table 1). However, they still belong to the frus- trated 2D kagom lattice owing to the corner-sharing triangu- lar connection, while the pillar ligands are responsible for the interlayer interactions as the perturbation of frustration and determine the final magnetic behavior. Direct (dc) and alternating current (ac) magnetic measure- ments The magnetic behavior of 1–4 was investigated by using a Quantum Design MPMS XL-7 SQUID magnetometer. In addi- tion to the preliminary magnetic measurements for complexes 1 and 2 in our previous report, herein we performed compre- hensive magnetic measurements for all four complexes to in- vestigate and compare their frustrated behavior. As shown in Figure 6a, the cMT value of 1 is 8.33 cm3mol1K at 300 K per Co3 unit, which is significantly higher than the spin-only value (5.63 cm3mol1K) expected for three uncou- pled octahedral CoII ions because of the orbit contribution. With a decrease in temperature, the cMT value decreases grad- ually and reaches a minimum of 0.28 cm3mol1K at 1.8 K. The decrease in the cMT plot upon cooling at high temperature is attributed to spin-orbit coupling effects and possible antiferro- magnetic interactions. A Curie–Weiss fitting (Figure S1a in the Supporting Information) of cM versus T data in the range of 50–300 K gives C=9.77 cm3mol1K and q=53.99 K. The sig- nificantly negative Weiss constant indicates dominant antifer- romagnetic interactions and spin-orbit coupling in the system.

KGaA, Weinheim 2562 Full Paper ponents (Figure 6c) not only indicate the onset of long-range magnetic ordering, but also exhibit the occurrence of a net moment in 1. Furthermore, the M–H plot (Figure 6d) at 2 K has a weak jump when the field is above 40 kOe; this indicates metamagnetic behavior, which is likely to be due to strong in- terlayer interactions in 1. For 2, the decrease in the cMT plot (Figure 7a) in the high- temperature region is similar to that of 1. The Curie–Weiss fit- ting of the 1/cMT data between 50 and 300 K gives C= 9.69 cm3mol1K and q=46.24 K (Figure S1b in the Support- ing Information). Owing to the long distance between the layers, the negative Weiss constant mainly represents the intra- layer CoCo antiferromagnetic interactions in addition to the spin-orbit coupling of octahedral CoII ions. The magnetic sus- ceptibility of 2 increased upon cooling from room temperature and a clear cusp was observed at approximately 4.4 K, which indicated long-range antiferromagnetic ordering. When the temperature was further decreased, the cM value tended to be constant below 3.7 K. The ZFC–FC curve (Figure 7b) was mea- sured at 10 Oe. The FC susceptibility follows the ZFC curve from the high-temperature region to form a distinct peak, which suggests a Nel temperature of 4.5 K; this is further con- firmed by the AC susceptibility with the frequency-independ- ent peaks of the real part of the susceptibility (c’) at around 4.4 K and the absence of the imaginary part (c’’) (Figure 7c). In- terestingly, the field-induced spin flip can be clearly observed below TN, as demonstrated by the FC curves involving larger fields (Figure 7d). In addition, the M–H curves for 2 exhibit a sudden increase during magnetization (Figure 7e), which in- dicate that 2 is a field-induced metamagnet below TN and the critical field is calculated from the dM/dH curves to be approxi- mately 5 kOe (Figure 7 f). The cMT versus T curve of complex 3 is shown in Figure 8a. Different from 1 and 2, upon cooling, the cMT value of 3 grad- ually decreases to a minimum around 5.2 K and then abruptly increases to a maximum at 2.4 K. Simultaneously, the cM value of 3 increases gradually with decreasing temperature from 300 K, but rises abruptly below 3.5 K and reaches 25.72 cm3mol1 at T=1.8 K without dropping; this suggests the weak ferromagnetic behavior of 3. Above 50 K, the mag- netic behavior can be fitted by the Curie–Weiss law (Figure S1c in the Supporting Information) to give C=8.33 cm3mol1K and q=59.64 K. Considering the negative Weiss constant and weak ferromagnetic behavior of 3, the canted antiferromagnet- ic behavior may be ascribed to 3; this is further confirmed by the cM versus T measurements at various fields (Figure 8c). The M–H curves (Figure 8d) at various temperatures are also in ac- cordance with the canted behavior and a narrow hysteresis loop is observed at 2 K with a small coercive field of 25 Oe, which indicates soft magnetic behavior. To determine the phase transition temperature, the temperature dependence of the FC and ZFC curves (Figure 8b) were measured under a dc field of 50 Oe to give Tc=2.6 K. However, the subsequent ac susceptibility measurement (Figure 8e) is beyond our expecta- tions. Under a zero dc field and a 5 Oe oscillating field in the frequency range of 1–1488 Hz, both the real and imaginary parts of ac susceptibility reveal a peak at about 2.3 K, which is slightly frequency dependent. This frequency dependence can be quantitatively studied by the equation f=(DTp/Tp)/Dlogw, in which Tp is the peak temperature and w is the frequency. The estimated value of f is 0.016, which is of the same magni- Figure 6.

Between 1.8 and 300 K, the cMT value (Figure 9a) of complex 4 gradually decreases to a minimum at 2.6 K and then a tiny increase is observed, such behavior is similar to that of 3. The 1/cM versus T curve fitted by the Curie–Weiss law between 50 and 300 K gave the following parameters: C=9.87 cm3mol1K and q=58.20 K (Figure S1d in the Supporting Information). ZFC–FC measurement (Figure 9b) under 50 Oe did not show any furcation of the two curves down to 1.8 K, which indicates the absence of a magnetic phase transition. Further ac sus- ceptibility of 4 (Figure 9c) was measured at a zero dc field and a 5 Oe oscillating field at a fre- quency of 1 and 1488 Hz. The real part increases gradually and the imaginary part has no signal, which proves the absence of magnetic ordering in 4 between 1.8 and 300 K. Discussion of the magnetic behavior Among the four complexes, the intralayer antiferromagnetic in- teractions will undoubtedly lead to spin frustration on the ab plane because of the characterized kagom lattice. On the other hand, the critical temperature (Tc) for complexes 1–4 shifts monotonically to lower temperatures as the interlayer distance increases with the employment of longer N,N-pillars (Table 2). Such an observation is consistent with a reduction in interlayer magnetic coupling owing to extension of the p-con- jugated aromatic bridges[12] between the cobalt–imda layers, leading to more separated 2D kagom layers. To estimate the degree of frustration for each complex, a widely used empirical parameter, f, provided by Ramirez[1a] is calculated by using Equation (1): f ¼ jqj=Tc ð1Þ Figure 9.

KGaA, Weinheim 2564 Full Paper in which q is the Weiss constant, which reflects not only the magnitude of the magnetic interactions, but also the anisotro- py of the high-spin six-coordinate CoII ions that will vary in the series presented herein; Tc is the critical temperature for order- ing in the system; the strength of frustration is in direct pro- portion to the value of f and a value of f>10 signifies strongly frustrated behavior.[1a,b] Herein, in our family of complexes, the f values show a drastic increase from 1 to 4 (Table 2), which suggests strengthening of frustration owing to weakening of the interlayer coupling. For 4, such strongly frustrated behav- ior, f>32.3, is rare in most CoII-frustrated materials with a kagom lattice (Table 2). In addition to strengthening of the magnetic frustration from complexes 1–4, further magnetic measurements revealed a change in the magnetic ground states for these four com- plexes. For complex 1, the layers are linked by the shortest pillar, pyz, which can be used as a magnetically active ligand[15] because of the relatively short length and conjugated aromatic structure. Therefore, the relatively strong interlayer superex- change coupling, compared with the other three compounds, through pyz hinders frustration and results in the metamag- netic behavior of 1 with a large critical field with Hc=40 kOe. When pillar pyz was replaced with a longer ligand to con- struct the other three compounds, there were two clear changes for complexes 2–4 that would remarkably influence the magnetic behavior of each compound. First, extending the distance between the neighboring frustrated layer weakens the superexchange coupling and the dominant interlayer inter- actions will be dipolar interactions.[14] Second, the kagom layer of the other three compounds has a clear wrinkling com- pared with the flat structure of 1 (Figure 5). Such a structural change results in the absence of a symmetric center between the neighboring octahedral CoII ions; this is in agreement with the lower space group of these three compounds compared with that of 1. Therefore, DM[16] interactions will be induced because of the asymmetric coupling[17] and lead to a net moment between antiferromagnetically coupled spins. For complex 2, although the antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling leads to long-range ordering at TN=4.4 K, DM inter- actions may cause the spins to rotate out of the layer and pro- duce a net magnetic moment for each layer. When the applied field exceeds the critical field, the ferromagnetic arrangement of the net magnetic moments should be observed. Such be- havior has been commonly found in some layered cobalt com- pounds,[18] but for a frustrated magnet with a 2D kagom lat- tice, as far as we know, there is only one family of inorganic FeIII–jarosite materials that displays similar magnetic behavior to that of complex 2.[5] In addition, the smaller critical field (5 kOe) for 2 compared with 1 (40 kOe) is reasonable because of weaker interlayer interactions. The kagom layer of complex 3 is similar to that of complex 2; thus DM interactions also exist; however, the coexistence of spin-glass and spin canting in 3 is quite exotic, and can be re- garded as a median state called “order with disorder”.[19] In theory, the coexistence of magnetic order and disorder can occur when one or more sublattices are ordered below the critical temperature, Tc, whereas at least one sublattice remains disordered at all temperatures. For complex 3, the kagom layer is more separated (14.780(5) ); thus the interlayer cou- pling for 3 is too weak to completely suppress frustration. However, the presence of DM interactions within layers partial- ly relieves frustration and prefers the canted long-range mag- netic order. As a result, when the competition between long- range order and quantum spin fluctuations caused by strong spin frustration cannot be suppressed by each other, such exotic magnetic behavior as that shown by complex 3 will be observed. There are some materials[20] that show similar mag- netic behavior to that of 3; however, a theoretical investigation is difficult because of the complicated frustrated structure and competitive interactions; therefore, complex 3 offers a simpler model for investigating the mechanism of the coexisting be- havior in frustrated systems. For complex 4, DM interactions still exist because of the same wrinkled layer as those in 2 and 3. However, the weakest interlayer interaction caused by the longest pillar, 4,4’-dpbp, leads to the strongest spin frustration, which is in agreement with the critical temperature below 1.8 K. The magnetic ground state of 4 in the lower temperature region would be interesting because a perfect 2D kagom layer would maintain frustration without ordering until 0 K, as predicted by Anderson.[2] Conclusion We reported a family of pillar-layered 3D cobalt(II) coordination polymers with analogous kagom [Co3(imda)2] layers. Their structures and magnetic properties could be tuned through the choice of different N,N-pillars. In general, increasing the in- terlayer distance leads to weakening of the interlayer magnetic coupling and the strengthening of the degree of frustration, whereas the introduction of DM interactions from wrinkled layers partially relieved frustration to generate competition. For complexes 1 and 2, the interlayer interaction was non-neg- ligible and resulted in long-range magnetic ordering with met- amagnetic behavior; however, the critical field for both com- pounds had a significant difference, Hc=40 and 5 kOe for 1 and 2, respectively, which indicated weakening of interlayer interactions from 1 to 2. By choosing longer pillar, 1,4-dpb, in 3, competition of the interlayer magnetic interactions with spin frustration was evident, which led to exotic magnetic be- havior. Finally, the degree of frustration in 4 was strengthened by the longest pillar, 4,4’-dpbp, which eliminated any magnetic ordering above 1.8 K, and thus, complex 4 might be more at- tributed to the real 2D magnet because of the long interlayer distance. The pillar-layered structure is a feasible way to inves- tigate the perturbations of frustrated 2D systems trapped in 3D frameworks, in which the pillar ligands can be systematical- ly replaced and diverse magnetic behaviors can be obtained and fine-tuned.

Synthesis of 4 A mixture of CoCl2·6H2O (0.019 g, 0.008 mmol), H3imda (0.006 g, 0.004 mmol), and 4,4’-dpbp (0.025 g, 0.008 mmol) was added to a solution of H2O/glycol (14:1; 15 mL) and stirred for 10 min. The resulting solution was heated in a 25 mL stainless-steel reactor with a Teflon liner at 1808C for 6 days. After a period of approxi- mately 20 h of cooling to room temperature, orange prismatic crystals of 4 were obtained, isolated by filtration, and washed with water. Yield: 64%; elemental analysis (%) calcd for C98H94N12O22Co3: C 59.79, H 4.81, N 8.54; found: C 59.53, H 4.63, N 8.62. X-ray crystallography Diffraction data for complex 3 were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS SPIDER IP diffractometer by using MoKa radiation (l=0.71073 ) at 150 K. Diffraction data for complex 4 were recorded on an Oxford Diffraction Gemini R CCD diffractometer with CuKa, l=1.54056 , at 150 K. The structures of 3 and 4 were solved by direct methods, and all non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically by least- squares methods on F2 by using the SHELXTL program.[19] Hydro- gen atoms on organic ligands were generated by the riding mode. Some of the severely disordered water molecules for both 3 and 4 were removed by SQUEEZE in the structural refinement and their amounts were determined by elemental analysis and TG analysis (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). For 3: C74H76N12O21Co3, M=1646.25, triclinic, space group P1¯, a=11.5618(8) , b= 11.8493(8) , c=15.7206(12) , a=76.325(2)8, b=71.246(2)8, g= 65.330(2)8, V=1840.1(2) 3, Z=1, 1=1.372 gcm3; m(MoKa)= 0.752 mm1, 12772 reflections measured, 7023 independent reflec- tions (Rint=0.0615), R1=0.0812 (I>2s(I)), wR2=0.2612 (all data), final GooF=1.038. For 4: C98H94N12O22Co3, M=1968.64, triclinic, space group P1¯, a=11.4712(6) , b=11.6147(7) , c= 19.8781(10) , a=81.156(5)8, b=74.921(5)8, g=65.987(10)8, V= 2332.5(2) 3, Z=1, 1=1.222 gcm3; m(CuKa)=4.795 mm1, 11367 reflections measured, 6834 independent reflections (Rint=0.0345), R1=0.0984 (I>2s(I)), wR2=0.2908 (all data), final GooF=1.145. Crystal data as well as details of data collection and refinements for 3 and 4 are summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Informa- tion. CCDC 1019076 (3) and 1019077 (4) contain the supplementa- ry crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. Magnetic measurements The magnetic measurements were performed on polycrystalline samples by using a Quantum Design MPMS XL-7 SQUID magneto- meter with experimental diamagnetic correction. The samples were mixed with Vaseline to prevent orientation in magnetic fields. The ZFC and FC magnetic susceptibilities were measured with the ultra-low field option to provide a remnant field <0.1 Oe.
