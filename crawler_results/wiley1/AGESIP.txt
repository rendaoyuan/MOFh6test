Abstract. Herein we report synthesis of a new brucite type copper hydroxide squarate, Cu3(OH)2(C4O4)2·4H2O [P21/c, a  5.6437(4) A˚ , b  12.8357(9) A˚ , c  9.1507(6) A˚ , β  95.892(1)° and Z  2] by hydrothermal method, and its characterization by single crystal diffraction analysis as well as by IR spectroscopy. The rather wide spread of CuO bond lengths, can be primarily Introduction The rational synthesis of coordination polymers has been of great research interest because of their versatile structural topologies and potential applications such as magnetism, electric conductivity, molecular adsorption, and hetero- geneous catalysis [17]. Among the various topologies of metal coordination polymers one dimensional metal hy- droxide chains interconnected by organic linkers are of spe- cial interest as they are often source of interesting magnetic and conducting properties owing to closely held metal atoms [812]. The interaction between individual metal hydroxide chains is often dictated by the size, shape and nature of linker anion [1319]. In this context, herein we report the synthesis and crystal structure of Cu3(OH)2(C4O4)2·4H2O. The solid contains one dimen- sional copper hydroxide strands representing sections of the brucite structure which are held together by squarate anions thereby forming a three dimensional framework with water molecules occupying empty channels created by that link- ing [17]. Experimental Section Syntheses Copper nitrate pentahydrate, squaric acid and 1,3-phenylenediam- ine were obtained from Aldrich and used without further purifi- cation. All the reactions were carried out in teflon lined stainless steel containers under autogeneous pressure.

Keywords: Metal organic framework; Hydrothermal synthesis; Copper; Squaric acid 0.375 mmol of Cu(NO3)2·5H2O, 0.375 mmol of m-phenylenediam- ine, 0.750 mmol of squaric acid and 339 mmol of distilled water in the molar ratio Cu(NO3)2·5H2O : amine : squaric acid : H2O  1 : 1 : 2 : 1037 were taken together. The reactants were sealed into a 10 mL Teflon lined bomb and heated to 180 °C and kept for 96 h and then cooled slowly to room temperature. The brown color crys- tals were washed with water, acetone and allowed to dry in air. X-ray investigations The structure was determined using X-ray single crystal diffraction. The single crystal diffraction data were collected on a Bruker AXS Smart-CCD diffractometer (Mo Kα radiation, graphite mono- chromator) at 100 K temperature [20]. Data were integrated using the Siemens SAINT program with the intensities corrected for Lorentz factor, polarization, air absorption, and absorption due to variation in the path length through the detector faceplate [20]. Semi-empirical absorption correction was applied using SADABS program [21]. Crystal structure was solved by direct methods and refined on F2 by full-matrix least squares using SHELXL-97 [22]. The copper atoms were located first, and then remaining atoms were deduced from subsequent difference Fourier syntheses. All the atoms except H were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms of water molecules were placed in idealized positions with isotropic thermal parameters fixed 1.2 or 1.5 times the value of the attached atom. Hydrogen atom for hydroxide group was located by differ- ence fourier synthesis and included in structure factor calculations. Crystallographic and refinement data is provided in Table 1 and atomic coordinates are given in Table 2. The program Diamond was used for crystal structure visualization and BVS calculations were carried out to calculate the oxidation state of copper [23, 24]. Spectroscopy FTIR spectra were recorded on KBr pellets using Bruker IFS 113v spectrophotometer with CsI as dispersal medium. Results and Discussion The solid was synthesized from a one step hydrothermal reaction of Cu(NO3)2·5H2O with squaric acid in alkaline S. Sharma, M.

On the basis of structural analysis the compo- sitional formula was found to be Cu3(OH)2(C4O4)2·4H2O. Two symmetry related oxygen octahedra centered by Cu(1) are linked together by sharing on edge, the resulting pairs of octahedral are sharing edges with Cu(2) oxygen oc- tahedra on both sides (Fig. 1a/1b).

Locally, the CuO bonds fall into two subsets of four shorter equatorial and two longer axial bonds. This bonding pattern is modulated by the structural function of the oxygen atom, thus among the shorter bonds those to O(7), bridging three copper atoms, are the longest. Owing to the structural similarity these me- tal hydroxide chains are considered as the brucite type me- [Cu3(OH)2(C4O4)]·4H2O tal hydroxide chains [1416]. The squarate anion has a nearly regular geometry as indicated by almost right angle between the adjoining carbon atoms and a very small tor- sion angle 1.78(1)°. All four oxygen atoms of each squarate dianion are taking part in the bonding: O(1), O(3) are act- ing as the doubly bridged atoms whereas O(2) and O(4) are triply bridged. Carbon carbon distances are in range of 1.451(3) A˚ to 1.480(3) A˚ and carbon oxygen distances range from 1.245(3) A˚ to 1.273(3) A˚ (Table 3). All the bond dis- tances and bond angles were found in good agreement with the standard values reported earlier [1519]. The BVS cal- culations of solid indicate the presence of Cu2 oxidation state which fits well with the compositional formula (Table 4). Metal coordination solids frequently exhibit inclusion of water molecules into the crystal structure with presence of weak interaction between metal oxygen and water mol- ecules. The solid discussed in this report also hosts water molecules in the channel as viewed down the a axis. The water molecules found in the channels are held together by weak to moderate hydrogen bonding interaction and poses as tetrameric “clusters” which are further involved in hydro- gen bonding with the hydrogen atoms attached to the hy- droxyl and with the squarate oxygen (Table 5). The organic amine was employed with an aim to function as structure directing agent as well as to maintain the pH of the reaction medium. However, the solid we obtained did not incorpor- ate any amine in final and it seems it merely provides the favorable reaction condition for the formation of copper hydroxide precursors. Fig. 2 Coordination environment of the squarate dianion. The FTIR spectrum of solids indicated characteristic bands due to squarate anion and water along with metal oxygen bonds. A broad band in the region of 32003600 cm1 can be attributed to the presence of water molecules and free framework OH. The presence of fre- quencies around 1500, 1759 and 1093 cm1 can be assigned to the mixture of CO and CC stretching in squarate anion. The different kinds of CuO bonds are observed in the fingerprint region. Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2008, 19111914 © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
