Manuscript Counterion Effect on the Spin-Transition Properties of the Cation ACHTUNGTRENUNG[FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]2+ ACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx=m-Xylylenebis(tetrazole)) Manuel Quesada,[a] Ferry Prins,[a] Eckhard Bill,[b] Huub Kooijman,[c] Patrick Gamez,*[a] Olivier Roubeau,[d] Anthony L.

J. 2008, 14, 8486 – 8499 8486 DOI: 10.1002/chem.200800990 Introduction The rational design of highly efficient and specific functional materials is now a main area of research, as the so-called top-down approach is reaching its limits of miniaturisation.[1] The bottom-up approach represents an exciting alternative, based on the idea that the miniaturisation limit of an elec- tronic function is the molecule. Spin-crossover (SCO) sys- tems fall in this category, and could work as molecular switches or memory storage devices.[2,3] These materials, mostly coordination complexes of d4 to d7 transition metal ions and especially FeII, are able to undergo a low spin (LS) to high spin (HS) transition by means of an external stimu- lus.[4] This entropy driven phenomenon[5] is sometimes ac- companied by a thermochromic effect, which makes these systems valuable for optical-storage devices. The spin-transition phenomenon is strictly molecular, but its characteristics are dependent on the overall crystal lat- tice. The narrow range of ligand field strength for which a spin transition may be observed makes these systems sensi- tive, not only to the first coordination sphere, but also to the second coordination sphere. Entities such as counterions or lattice-solvent molecules may have a drastic effect on the spin-transition properties of the material.[4] Bis(tetrazole)- based coordination polymers of FeII belong to this family of compounds showing spin-transition properties.[6] Gradual to steep temperature-dependent magnetic responses have been reported with bis(tetrazole) compounds.[7] The variation of the size of the spacer linking the two tetrazole rings has re- sulted in compounds with different dimensionality.[8–10] The size, conformation and flexibility of the spacer all seem to have an important effect on the magnetic behaviour of the resulting materials.[11] Weinberger and co-workers recently published a study on the relationship between the size of the alkyl spacer and the T1/2 (temperature at which half of the metal centres are in LS states, the other half being in the HS state) and the optical properties of the complexes.[12] An effect of the length of the spacer on the thermomagnetic and magneto-optical properties is expected, but a correla- tion with the parity (number of carbons) of the spacer has also been established. Further systematic studies are neces- sary to better understand the role played by each chemical piece constituting the metal–organic network. In this respect, no study has yet been undertaken to try to understand the influence of the counterion on the spin-tran- sition behaviour within a family of bis(tetrazole) ligands. This lack is mainly due to synthetic problems that arise when preparing coordination compounds from these ligands with different FeII salts. The role of the counterion is to tem- plate the crystallisation process. Most importantly, the size of the counterion has an effect on the quality of the crystal- lisation.[12] In addition, the exchange of counterions very often results in an annihilation of the SCO properties, re- sulting from slight structural variations able to modify the ligand-field strength or form a complete different structure. Consequently, its influence on the spin transition is very dif- ficult to investigate. So far, the only report mentioning the preparation of FeII spin-transition compounds with two dif- ferent counterions involves the ligand btzb (btzb=1,4-bis- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(tetrazole-1-yl)butane).[8,13] [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzb)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[PF6]2 shows a two- step steep transition, while the perchlorate derivative shows a steep, incomplete transition,[13] or a gradual one-step tran- sition,[12] suggesting two different phases. Abstract: The influence of the counter- anion on the structure and the spin- transition properties of original 1D bis(tetrazole) FeII systems, namely [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]X2 (X=PF6  (1), CF3SO3  (2) and ClO4  (3); btzx=m-xylylene- bis(tetrazole)) is studied. The X-ray crystal structures of compounds 1 and 2 are described in detail. These struc- tures present a solvent molecule encap- sulated within pockets formed by btzx ACHTUNGTRENUNGligands along the 1D coordination chains. Compound 2 is shown to be the first structurally characterised alternat- ing HS–LS 1D spin-transition system (HS=high spin, LS=low spin). The magnetic susceptibility measurements of all three compounds are compared. The degree of completion and the tran- sition temperature are both drastically influenced by the counterion used, while surprisingly, the cooperative nature of the transition is not affected by the choice of counterion. Com- pounds 1 and 2 are further studied by Mçssbauer spectroscopy and their dis- tinct LIESST properties are compared. Keywords: anions · bis(tetrazole) · iron · polymers · spin crossover [a] Dr. M.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 8487 FULL PAPER The compounds herein described are based on the btzx ligand, which bears two tetrazoles rings bridged by a spacer, namely m-xylene. So far such a rigid spacer has not been used, as all previously reported bis(tetrazole) ligands are based on aliphatic-chain linkers. The synthesis, characterisa- tion and magnetic properties of a new series of compounds containing the cation [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]2+ (btzx=m-xylylenebis- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(tetrazole)) and various anions, that is, PF6  (1), CF3SO3  (2), and ClO4  (3) are reported below. The crystal structures of PF6  and CF3SO3  derivatives are described in detail. We show that the use of a rigid linker maintains the overall structure when changing counterion, while it allows detailed discussion of the influence of the counterion on the structur- al, magnetic and photomagnetic properties. Results Crystal structure descriptions [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[PF6]2·MeOH (1): The space group for compound 1 at 200 and 100 K is P63/m (Table 1). Its structure is formed of coordination chains separated by PF6  ions that are not disordered, while a methanol molecule is crystallo- graphically disordered between two positions (Figure 1), within cages along the chains. This disorder of the solvent molecule is observed at both temperatures. The FeII metal ion is surrounded by six crystallographically related tetra- zole rings that coordinate through the ND atom, forming an almost perfect octahedral environment (see Table 2). [ND stands for nitrogen “donor atom”, and represents the atom coordinated to the metal ion.] At 200 K, all FeND distances amount to 2.160(4) P, in the expected range for an FeII HS centre (Table 2).[4] This bond length is close to those ob- served in previously reported bis(tetrazole)-based com- pounds,[8,14,15] and slightly shorter than FeND bonds found for mononuclear tetrazole-based compounds.[16] At 100 K, the FeND distance is 2.001(3) P, which corresponds to a 7% decrease of the bond length upon the transition. The co- ordination sphere for the HS centres is characterised by a slightly distorted octahedron (set of angles N4-Fe1-N4; 90.48 and 89.528), while the LS iron(II) centres exhibit a nearly regular octahedral geometry (set of angles N4-Fe1- N4; 90.13 and 89.878). The distortion parameter, S, for com- pound 1 is one of the smallest octahedral distortions in both, the HS and the LS states, for any previously reported bis(tetrazole) Fe-based spin- transition (ST) compounds.[17] [S symbolises the sum of the deviations from 908 of the 12 cis N-Fe-N angles.] The bent conformation of the ligands results in the formation of a 1D polymer, extending along the c axis. The FeII cen- tres are bridged by three li- gands that adopt the same con- formation, forming cages in which the disordered methanol molecules (no interactions) are trapped (Figure 1). The Fe···Fe separation along the polymer chains at 200 K is 11.397 P, and is 11.205 P at 100 K, while the interpolymeric Fe···Fe distance is 10.679 and 10.543 P at these respective temperatures. The most important structur- al changes caused by the spin transition are found along the c axis (see Table 1). Surprisingly, there is no significant modification of the structural arrangement of the ligand. As for other bis(tetrazole)-based 1D polymers,[10,18] the particular packing of the chains generates hollow spaces in which the counterions are located (see Figure 2). Each poly- mer chain is separated from its six neighbours by six PF6  ions (see Figure 2). Each PF6  ion is shared by three poly- mers, resulting in the expected Fe/PF6  ratio of 1:2. The dis- tance separating the counterions from the metal centres is 5.166 P for the HS state, and decreases by 0.068 P upon switching to the LS state (see Table 4, below). All the Table 1.

Haasnoot, P. Gamez et al. anions are lying in the plane formed by the FeII centres, and each of them interacts through anion–p contacts with three different chains (Figure 2). No solvent molecules are present between the polymeric chains in the crystal lattice. Howev- er, solvent molecules are trapped inside the cages formed by three ditopic ligands (see Figure 1). No intermolecular inter- actions between the polymer chains are observed. The solid- state structure is most likely imposed by the coordination of the ligands to the metal ions. [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[CF3SO3]2·CH3CN (2): At 320 K compound 2 crystallises in the same space group as the hexafluoridophos- phate derivative 1, namely the P63/m hexagonal space group. The structure is very similar to that of compound 1. The FeND distance is 2.163 P (Table 3), which suggests an FeII high-spin centre at this temperature. The coordination sphere is close to octahedral (S=0.68) with N-Fe-N angles of 90.058 and 89.958 (see Table S1 in the Supporting Infor- mation). The triflate anions are not disordered, while the only solvent molecules present in the crystal lattice have two different spatial orientations inside the benzene cages (Figure 2). The solvent-to-metal distance is 4.095 P, which is around 0.5 P shorter than the corresponding length ob- served for compound 1. This short distance is most likely due to the longer length of the acetonitrile molecule (com- pare to methanol), which is confined inside the host cavity, therefore forcing closer interactions with the metal ion. The bent conformation of the ligand creates the same 1D poly- meric structure extended along the c axis. The Fe···Fe intra- polymeric distance is 11.613 P, thus 0.216 P longer than the one observed for compound 1. The interpolymeric distance is 10.954 P, which is also somewhat longer than the one in compound 1. In both cases, the planes of the benzene rings form an angle of 608 and the distance of the solvent mole- cules to these planes is comparable. The distance that sepa- rates the anion from the metal centre is 5.287 P (see Table 4), slightly longer than the corresponding one in com- pound 1. To define the spatial arrangement of the anion in the crystal structure, the angle of the CS axis with respect to the c axis (axis along which the polymer extends) is used. In the present case, the CS axis is parallel to the c axis. As the temperature is lowered, the compound undergoes a structural phase transition to the less symmetric P3¯ space group. At 170 K, at which the transition of [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[CF3SO3]2·CH3CN (2) is finished, the compound now exhib- Table 2.

Nevertheless, a comparable overall picture is maintained; the compound is still consti- tuted of 1D polymeric chains that extend along the c axis. The crystal turned out to be a merohedral twin, with a two- fold rotation axis parallel to the c axis as the twin operation. The compound crystallises in the P3¯ space group and, pos- sesses two unique chains: 1) chain1 lies at a crystallographic 3 axis (symmetry C3) and contains the Fe1 and Fe2 centres (Figure 3); 2) chain2 lies on a crystallographic 3 axis (sym- metry S6) and contains the ions labelled as Fe3 and Fe4 (Figure 3). The twofold axis of the twin operation is parallel to the 3 and 3 axes. Chain1—Fe1 and Fe2 centres: Chain1 is formed by two independent iron centres, namely Fe1 and Fe2, which are both coordinated by six tetrazole rings and are alternatingly connected by btzx ligands. At 170 K, the FeN bond lengths for Fe1 are 2.208(4) (Fe1N18) and 2.178(4) P (Fe1N1), and those for Fe2 are 2.192(4) (Fe2N8) and 2.196(4) P (Fe2N11). These values are all in the range expected for HS FeII centres (see Table S1 in the Supporting Informa- tion).[4] At 100 K, the FeN distances for Fe2 amount to 2.061(3) (Fe2N8) and 2.059 (3) P (Fe2N11), correspond- ing to a decrease of 6%. These distances are in the range for LS FeII centres;[4] therefore, their shortening reflects the HS!LS transition occurring in Fe2 (see below). In contrast, Fe1 shows practically no variation of the FeN coordination bond lengths at 100 K, indicating that this metal centre re- mains HS throughout the entire temperature range. The dis- tortion of the octahedral geometry can be estimated with the parameter S. Both the Fe1 and the Fe2 ions are closer to the ideal octahedron (S=08) at 100 K than at 170 K (see Table 4). At 170 K, the octahedral coordination sphere is significantly more distorted for Fe2, as compared to Fe1. At lower temperatures, the distortion in both centres is compa- rable. These S values contrast with those of the previous re- lated 1D polymeric compound, that is, [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[PF6]2·CH3OH (1), which shows S values closer to 0 (reflect- ing a less important distortion) both in the HS and in the LS states (see Table 4). The metal centres are enclosed by six triflate counterions, each shared by two other metal centres, thus resulting in the expected triflate/Fe ratio of 2:1. The spatial arrangement of these counterions differs depending on the metal centre. As seen in Figure 3, two different types of arrangements for the counterions around Fe1 are observed. Both types have their CF3 group close to the metal ion, with FeF distances of 4.384 P (F21···Fe1) and 5.135 P (F23···Fe1). The torsion angle formed by the CS axis and the c axis is 22.908 and 142.078, which at low temperatures become 27.348 and 138.648 respectively. These torsion angles are far from 08, the value observed for the structure determined at 320 K. These counterions are alternating around the metal centre (see Figure 3). The counterions surrounding the Fe2 ions are organised in a different way. As for Fe1, there are two different spatial dispositions for the counterions around Fe2, which are alter- natingly distributed. In this case, the two distinct types of tri- flate ions are clearly differentiated, because one of them has its CF3 group closer to the metal centre Fe2, while for the other one, the SO3 function is adjacent to Fe2. The corre- sponding distances are 4.905 P for Fe2···O11SO3, and 4.896 P for Fe2···F13CF3 (Table 4). The torsion angles of their CS axis with respect to the polymeric axis are of 130.24 and 55.838, respectively. The former undergoes a negligible change of orientation in the LS state, while the latter experi- ences a change of about 28. When the temperature decreas- Table 4.

Gamez et al. es, only the Fe1 centre experiences a significant variation of the metal···counterion distances, with a shortening of the F21···Fe1 and F23···Fe1 distances by more than 0.5 P. The peculiar crystal packing of 1D bis(tetrazole)-based polymers is responsible for this proximity of the counterion to the metal centre.[17] These close contacts give rise to strong anion–tetrazole interactions (Figure 4), observed for the anions closest to Fe1 and Fe2 (Table 4). The deviation of the anion–tetrazole (centroid) distance between the structure measured at 170 K, and the one measured at 100 K is only significant for the anion closest to Fe1. The solvent molecules trapped in the cages formed by three bridging btzx ligands present some differences with re- spect to the structure solved at 320 K. Each cavity contains one solvent molecule, and all these acetonitrile molecules are orientated in the same direction (head-to-tail, namely with the nitrogen atom alternatingly pointing to Fe1 and Fe2 (see Figure 3). These acetonitrile molecules do show weak solvent–p interactions with the coordinated tetrazole rings, and are therefore not disordered in the cage, in con- trast to the methanol molecules in 1. TGA analyses for both compounds show that these solvent molecules are tightly trapped in the cages, as they cannot be released before the decomposition of the material. Chain2—Fe3 and Fe4 centres: The chain2 is also consti- tuted of two independent FeII centres, that is, Fe3 and Fe4, which are alternately connected by three btzx ligands (Figure 3). Similarly to chain1, the coordination sphere for both Fe3 and Fe4 is formed by six tetrazoles rings, but all tetrazoles are here crystallographically related. As a result, chain2 has a higher symmetry than chain1. The metal-to- ligand bond lengths for Fe3 (Fe3N21) and Fe4 (Fe4N28) at 170 K are 2.178 (4) and 2.185(4) P, respectively (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). These bonds are slightly shorter than those observed for chain1, but they are still within the range for HS FeII systems.[4] At 100 K, the metal- to-ligand bond lengths decrease (the values observed are 6.7% lower) for Fe4, indicating a HS!LS transition (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).[4] As for the Fe1 ions found in chain1, the metal-to-ligand bond lengths re- mains practically unchanged for Fe3 (FeNtz=2.182 P), il- lustrative of a HS centre. At 170 K, the octahedral distortion for Fe4 is comparable to that observed for Fe1 and Fe2. Fe3 instead shows an almost perfect regular octahedral geometry (see Table 4), close to that observed for both compounds 2 at 320 K and 1. Surprisingly, the low-temperature structure (LS state) reveals slightly more distorted coordination spheres for both Fe3 and Fe4, while more symmetric, or less distorted coordination spheres are expected for LS com- pared to the HS centres. In chain2, six counterions “surround” each FeII centre, and each anion is shared by two adjacent metal ions. The counterions are regularly arranged around Fe3 and Fe4, in contrast to the two different spatial arrangements observed for Fe1 and Fe2 (see Figure 3). The torsion angles between the CS axis and the c axis for Fe3 are 64.66 and 115.358 and vary by 1.888 in the LS state. For Fe4 the torsion angles are 156.09 and 23.918 in the HS state and are modified by 1.48 at 100 K. The Fe3···F11CF3 distance is 4.852 P and the Fe4···O23SO3 distance is 5.369 P. F11 also “interacts” with Fe2, while the O23 atom also interacts with Fe1; according- ly, the iron pairs Fe1/Fe4 and Fe2/Fe3 share the same coun- terions (Figure 4). The distances do not vary significantly with the temperature for both metal centres forming chain2. This observation suggests that the variation noted for Fe1 (chain1) is due to a rearrangement of the spatial orientation of the counterion (see torsion angles), and not to a displace- ment. Anion–tetrazole interactions are only observed for Fe3, with an anion···tetrazole (centroid) distance of 3.005 P (Figure 4). Remarkably, Fe4 does not show this type of in- teractions, which may be related to the solvent disposition in the host cavities (see below). As for chain1, chain2 also contains acetonitrile molecules in its cages formed by the three bridging btzx ligands. How- ever, the acetonitrile molecules are arranged here in a head- to-head manner (see Figure 5). Consequently, they are always pointing with their N41 atoms towards the Fe4 ions, interacting with the coordinated tetrazoles by means of sol- vent–p interactions. The N41-centroid distance is 3.275 P, Figure 4. Top: Anion-p interactions occurring in chain1 and chain2 in compound 2.

Fe4 possesses two acetonitrile molecules very close to the first coordination sphere. The resulting increased electron densi- ty at the metal centre may explain the lack of anion-p inter- actions for Fe4. Crystal packing: The crystal packing of [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[CF3SO3]2·CH3CN (2) is similar to that previously observed for other bis(tetrazole)-based 1D polymers.[17] In Figure 4 (bottom), a chain1/chain2 ratio of 2:1 is clearly evidenced. Chain2 is surrounded by six chain1 units, and each chain1 is shared by three chain2 units. The asymmetry of the chains and the spatial position of the counterions lead to a less symmetrical crystal packing, by comparison with the one of compound 1. The different tilting of the tetrazole rings, and the disparate spatial arrangements of the counter- ions are clearly visible in Figure 4 (bottom). The alignment of the polymeric chains generates planes with the iron(II) ions and the triflate counterions, which are separated by the cages formed by the btzx ligands. The solid-state structure of compound 2 at 100 K presents an unusual crystal packing (Figure 5). As mentioned above, only one of the two crystallographically independent FeII centres of each chain undergoes the spin transition. This par- ticular situation results in the first example of a 1D chain ex- hibiting the unusual HS–LS pattern, typically observed for dinuclear entities.[19] Polymeric spin-crossover materials, such as the known [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btrz)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ClO4]2 (btrz=bisACHTUNGTRENUNG(triazole)) or {FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(pmd)[Ag(CN)2]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Ag2(CN)3]}, do present the same type of pattern.[20,21] In the present case, the ···HS–LS–HS··· alter- nation observed in the chains does not produce full HS or LS planes. In fact, the spin-transition (ST) centres of chain1 share the same plane (plane2) with the non-ST centres of chain2, and vice versa (plane1). This arrangement in fact produces the peculiar packing depicted in Figure 5. Thus in plane1, each ST (Fe4) centre is surrounded by six non-ST (Fe1) centres, whereas in plane2, the non-ST (Fe3) ion is surrounded by six ST (Fe2) centres. [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ClO4]2·CH3CN (3): The reaction conditions de- scribed above were used to prepare [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ClO4]2·CH3CN (3). In contrast to the compounds 2 and 1, suitable single crystals of compound 3 could not be ob- tained, and thus the solid-state structure is not available. The IR and Elemental analyses suggest that compound 3 is structurally related to the previous two compounds. Consid- ering that all the structural asymmetry observed for com- pound 2 is due to the triflate anions, the structure of com- pound 3 is expected to be comparable to that of compound 1. Unfortunately, no accurate structural information could be obtained from X-ray powder diffraction analysis, due to the poor crystallinity of the material. Nevertheless, the main structural features observed for the previous compounds most likely are also present in 3. Therefore, it is assumed this compound is composed of 1D polymeric chains, which presumably pack in a similar manner to compound 1. Bulk magnetic properties and the LIESST effect: Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on samples of 1–3, in the temperature range 6–300 K, under an applied magnetic field of 1000 G (see Figure 6). Complex 1 shows a gradual spin transition centred at T1/2=160 K. At room tem- perature, the cmT value is 3.5 cm3molK1. This value re- mains constant until 210 K, at which the transition gradually sets in, extending over more than 100 K. The cmT value then remains constant at 0.5 cm3molK1 and finally decreases at very low temperatures, due to the zero-field splitting of re- maining HS FeII centres. The residual high-spin fraction at low temperatures would correspond to 14% (see Mçssbauer section below) of the total amount of FeII atoms. Complex 2 shows a comparable behaviour. The transition is centred at T1/2=110 K, with a lower completion compared to com- pound 1. The cmT value at room temperature is about 3.5 cm3molK1. At 146 K, cmT starts to gradually decrease Figure 5. View of the HS–LS pattern observed for compound 2 at 100 K (LS=dark grey, HS=light grey). Figure 6. Plots of cmT versus T for compounds 1 (PF6, full circles), 2 (CF3SO3, empty circles) and 3 (ClO4, filled squares). www.chemeurj.org  2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2008, 14, 8486 – 8499 8492 J. G. Haasnoot, P. Gamez et al. until 80 K, at which a cmT value of 2.2 cm3molK1 is reached. In this case, the transition corresponds to 40% of the iron(II) centres, thus indicating a 60% residual high- spin fraction at low temperatures. For compound 3, the tran- sition is centred at T1/2=90 K, involving only 20% of the iron centres. At very low temperatures, cmT decreases as a result of the zero-field splitting of the remaining HS FeII ions. The completeness of the transitions for compound 3 is dependent on both the cooling rate and the quality of the sample (see Supporting Information). Indeed, the low tem- perature at which it occurs gives a dominant role to kinetics, which are slowed down, and to ZFS effects. The magnetic behaviour of compounds 1 and 2 is in agreement with their structural features. For compound 1, the remnant HS fraction at low temperatures can be as- signed to structural defects, like the extremities of the poly- mers. In triazole-based compounds, the remnant HS fraction at low temperatures is used to estimate the length of the polymeric 1D chains.[22,23] For instance, in compound 1, the FeII centres at the end of the polymeric chains are most likely coordinated by solvent molecules or non-bridging btzx ligands. As these “end-centres” remain HS, and taking into account that coordinated btzx ligands would create a fa- vourable crystal field to produce ST FeII centres (like the “in-chain” ST centres), it is therefore expected that metha- nol molecules are completing the coordination spheres of the terminal FeII ions (see Mçssbauer section below). For compound 2, the incompleteness of the transition is also in agreement with its structural features. As mentioned above, in phase-II (P3¯ phase, typically below 290 K) only two out of four crystallographically independent FeII centres present undergo the spin transition, while the other two remain HS. The transition temperature is 40 K lower than the one ob- served for 1, but the slope of the curve remains practically identical. Hence, the cooperativity seems not to be affected by the change of counterion. Compound 3 exhibits a very incomplete transition, ham- pered by its low temperature of occurrence resulting in ki- netics and ZFS to have dominant effects on the bulk mag- netic properties. As mentioned earlier, this completeness is to a certain extent dependent on the cooling rate[24] and on the sample preparation (see Supporting Information).[25] Samples which have been obtained by rapid precipitation usually exhibit lower percentages of transition centres, while more crystalline samples show slightly higher values (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The cooling rate also influences this value, although its effect is smaller, com- pared to the sample preparation (amorphous vs. crystalline). Accordingly, if the temperature is kept at 120 K for about 22 h, only a negligible decrease of the cmT value is detected. Hence, most of the incompleteness observed for compound 3 is independent of the sample preparation and/or the cool- ing rate. The incompleteness is apparently caused by an in- herent structural impossibility for the compound to achieve a regular network in which all metallic centres are ST. A structural change occurring during the transition may also justify this incompleteness as seen for compound 2. LIESST (light induced excited spin state trapping)[26] measurements have been performed on compounds 1 and 2. Compound 1 is not excited to the metastable HS state upon irradiation at 530 nm at 10 K. In contrast, compound 2 can be trapped at low temperatures in its HS metastable state.[26] As shown in Figure 7, compound 2 not only shows LIESST, but also exhibits LITH (light induced thermal hystere- sis)[27,28] behaviour (see Figure S3 in Supporting Informa- tion). This unambiguous behaviour suggests the presence of cooperative interactions between the metal centres (see the Discussion). Mçssbauer spectroscopy: The Mçssbauer spectrum at 80 K for compound 1 reveals a predominant single line with isomer shift d=0.56 mms1, typical for a LS FeII centre and a smaller quadrupole doublet characteristic of HS FeII cen- tres (d=1.21 mms1, DEQ=3.46 mms1, 10% relative inten- sity, see Table 5 and Figure 8). The spectrum at 110 K is practically identical with minor variations on the intensities of the two signals (Figure 8). An additional doublet, charac- teristic of HS FeII centres, appears at 175 K (isomer shift d= 1.14 mms1; quadrupole splitting DEQ=0.90 mms1, 31% relative intensity) with a proportional decrease in intensity of the main LS signal. This new signal can thus be assigned to the transition of the iron centres from the LS to the HS state. At this temperature, also a very asymmetric doublet is observed, which is typical of FeIII centres, probably due to the partial oxidation of the sample (d=0.34 mms1, DEQ= 0.47 mms1, 6%). The asymmetry of the lines is caused by intermediate spin relaxation, which is typical of half-integer systems (S=5/2). At room temperature, the LS signal has completely disappeared and the HS doublet is the main signal observed, which accounts for 74% of the iron centres in the compound. The signal assigned to the FeIII impurity increases in relative intensity, probably due to a more fa- vourable Debye–Waller factor at higher temperatures. The Figure 7. Plot of experimental cmT versus T (squares) and temperature dependence of the product cmT after LIESST (circles), in the 6–300 K range for compound 2.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 8493 FULL PAPER Spin Crossover HS signal observed at all previous temperatures is still pres- ent at room temperature. From these spectra, several con- clusions can be made. First, the spin transition is observed and its temperature agrees with that determined by magnet- ic susceptibility measurements. Second, the sample contains ferric impurities, most likely resulting from the partial oxida- tion of the FeII ions. Third, the presence of a second HS doublet could be related to the end of the polymeric chains, as proposed above. Based on this last assumption, the re- maining HS fraction at low temperatures corresponds to about 9% (considering that the FeIII is still present), thus suggesting a chain length of approximately 30 metal centres. Compound 2 is a more intricate system than 1. The Mçss- bauer spectra were recorded at 297, 170, 110 and 80 K (Figure 9). The spectrum recorded at 297 K reflects the structural phase transition in compound 2 (see above), as two different phases are clearly visible at this temperature. Indeed, the two main signals correspond to the HS FeII cen- tres of the two different phases, while the smaller peaks can be assigned to the corresponding end-chains (as above for compound 1). From this spectrum it appears that the differ- ent FeII centres of the trigonal phase (phase-II) are not dis- tinguishable by Mçssbauer spectroscopy. At 175 K, the spec- trum presents only one main HS signal, as indicated by its quadrupole splitting and isomer shift values (see Table 5). This observation confirms that the two previous signals (spectrum recorded at 297 K) were due to the structural phase transition, which is com- pleted at 170 K (see above). A very small peak is noticed, which indicates the beginning of the HS!LS transition for some of the FeII centres (see Table 5 for the corresponding IS and QS values). The second doublet signal (d=1.14 mms1, DEQ=0.36 mms1, 2% relative intensity, see Table 5 and Figure 8) has an isomer shift, which characterises a HS centre, while its quadrupole splitting is ascribed to a LS centre. This signal can only be assigned to an impurity of a highly symmetrical FeII HS spe- cies. When the temperature of measurement is decreased to 110 K, the intensity of the LS signal increases at the expense of the main HS doublet. As ex- pected, the other two peaks remain constant. Finally, the spectrum at 80 K illustrates the HS/LS ratio in compound 2 once the spin transition is com- pleted. Only 40% of the iron centres experience the HS!LS, the remaining 60% exhibiting a high spin state. Discussion Pinpoint on the structural characteristics of [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[CF3SO3]2·CH3CN: The intricate crystal structure of com- pound 2 observed at 170 K (phase-II) is a result of a struc- tural phase transition occurring at room temperature. Above room temperature, this compound presents a more symmetrical structural phase, the features of which are com- parable to those of compound 1. Indeed, both compounds 1 and 2 in phase-I crystallise in the trigonal space group P63/ m, have similar cell dimensions and even the same physical crystal appearance (see Table 1). The cone angle, the octa- hedral distortion and the anion-to-metal distances are almost identical (see Table 4). However, compound 1 shows an almost complete spin transition when the temperature is decreased, while for compound 2 only 50% of the iron(II) centres change to the LS state. This different behaviour sug- gests that the non-occurrence of the transition for half of the iron(II) centres is due to structural changes caused by the phase transition observed for compound 2. The resultant four crystallographically independent iron(II) centres of compound 2 in phase-II possess very similar coordination environments, but disparate magnetic behaviours. Therefore, subtle differences in the coordination spheres of the metallic Table 5. Mçssbauer data for compounds 1 and 2.

The alternate distribution of the LS and HS centres re- sults in the first 1D polymeric chain showing the typical HS–LS pattern observed for dinuclear species.[29,30] A re- markable difference between the phases-I and -II of com- pound 2 and all bis(tetrazole)-based 1D ST polymers (in- cluding compound 1) is the comparatively lower symmetry of its solid-state structure. The asymmetric nature of the CF3SO3  ions (in contrast to BF4  or PF6 ), associated with their spatial disposition in the crystal lattice (see crystal structure descriptions), is responsible for the overall asym- metry of the network. Indeed, many particular structural features of 2 can be related to its counterion. The existence of two distinct planes (plane1 containing the Fe1 and Fe4 ions, and plane2 the Fe2 and Fe3 centres) is evidently caused by the different disposition adopted by the counter- ions in each of these planes (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The position of the triflates in the lattice also influences their association with the tetrazole moieties through anion–p interactions, and vice versa. As a result of these triflate···tetrazole contacts, the coordination angle of the tetrazole rings (cone angle) is affected. The proximity of the counterion to the metal centre sterically and electroni- cally influences the ligand-field strength of the btzx ligands, and thus the magnetic properties of the corresponding iron ions (see cone angles). Furthermore, the orientation of the solvent molecules in the cavities is most likely determined by the interactions of the counterions with the tetrazole Figure 8. Mçssbauer spectra for compound 1. From top to bottom: 297, 175, 110 and 80 K. Parameters are given in Table 5. Figure 9. Mçssbauer spectra for compound 2. From top to bottom: 297, 175, 110 and 80 K. Parameters are given in Table 5.

All these structural characteristics, induced by the triflate anions, apparently lead to a unique magnetic behaviour. Dinuclear FeII complexes are known to be the most common molecular systems that exhibit the HS–LS pattern, which is observed in the present polynuclear compound.[29–31] The occurrence of a two-step transition for these materials is due to the stabilisation of the intermediate HS–LS domain.[32,33] Interestingly, the first two-step spin-transition phenomenon was observed in a mononuclear entity, that is, [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(pic)3]Cl2·EtOH (pic=2-picolylamine).[34] Subsequent studies have proven that the solid-state structure of this complex is formed by 1D supramolecular chains through in- termolecular interactions that stabilise the HS–LS pattern.[35] Similarly, in phase-II of compound 2, a HS–LS domain is observed; however, in this case, the metallic centres are part of a polymer generated by means of coordination bonds. Much effort has been devoted to the study and compre- hension of the HS–LS domain formation. For dinuclear complexes where the two FeII centres are identical, it has been proposed that, in order to observe this supramolecular phenomenon, the enthalpic energy of the HS–LS pairs should be lower than half the sum of the enthalpic energies of the HS and LS states.[32,33] In addition, intermolecular in- teractions are required to stabilise the HS–LS domain for- mation.[32] In the case of compound 2 phase-II, HS–LS pairs are likely to be even more stabilised than in [Fe- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(pic)3]Cl2·EtOH as a result of the stronger coordinative in- teractions, and therefore only the plateau is observed, with- out a second step. On the other hand, the presence of differ- ent crystallographic iron(II) centres is probably the main reason for their different magnetic behaviour. Structural fea- tures (intra- and/or intermolecular supramolecular interac- tions) may directly affect the spin-transition properties. 57Fe Mçssbauer measurements show no distinction between the different iron(II) centres when they have the same electron- ic state (LS or HS), suggesting a structural/sterical origin for the difference in magnetic behaviour (and not an electronic one).[36] As mentioned above, the spatial arrangement of the triflate anions in the lattice is the main factor influencing most of the other structural characteristics. From the struc- tural data of other 1D spin-transition bis(tetrazole)-based compounds,[17] it is well established that this family of ST materials usually experience a tilting of the coordinated tet- razole rings upon the transition (this tilting is defined by the (tetrazole-centroid)-ND-Fe angles). In the present case, this change of angle is hampered by the disposition of the anions for Fe1 and Fe3 (see below). Consequently, the anion signif- icantly affects the characteristics of the spin-transition curves of the [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]2+ ions. The effect of the counterion on the spin-transition proper- ties: As mentioned above, the effect of the counterion on the magnetic properties of bis(tetrazole)-based spin-transi- tion materials has not yet been investigated thoroughly. Indeed, the only ST cation reported[8,13] with two different anions, namely ClO4  and PF6 , is [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzb)3]2+. It is known that the crystallinity of bis(tetrazole)-based compounds is dependent on the anion used.[12] The role of the anion in this type of materials is to act as a template for the genera- tion of the cationic polymeric network. Thus, the size of the anion is crucial to obtain suitable single crystals of the mate- rial, as observed for [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzb)3]2+. Surprisingly, crystalline compounds of [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]2+ with three different counterions have been obtained that all exhibit spin-transition proper- ties. An evident effect of the counterion on the spin-transition properties concerns the remaining fraction of HS species at low temperatures, which is 10, 50 and 80% for 1–3, respec- tively. For [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzb)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ClO4]2, the high fraction of HS iron centres at low temperatures has been assigned to a phase transition.[13] In the case of compound 2, the structural phase transition and the spin crossover occur at different tempera- tures, suggesting that these two events are independent. This structural change may be responsible for the absence of HS!LS transition for some of the iron(II) centres. The var- iation of the anion-to-metal distance seems to affect the electronic properties of the iron(II) centres (see below). It has to be considered as well that the structural changes asso- ciated with the spin transition may restrict the number of FeII ions undergoing the transition, as proposed for [FeII- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzpol)1.8(btzpol-OBF3)1.2]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[BF4]0.8 (btzpol=1,3-bis(tetrazol- 1-yl)-2-propanol).[11] The nature of the counterion has also an effect on the temperature of the spin transition (T1/2). Triazole-based ma- terials have been intensively studied, and the influence of the different chemical “pieces” constituting the compound on the spin-transition properties has been thoroughly inves- tigated.[37–42] In the case of spherical counterions, the small- est ion leads to the highest transition temperature.[23] The greater electrostatic pressure generated on the cation by the smaller anions, stabilises the LS state over the HS state.[23] In the present case, the smaller perchlorate anion (com- pared to PF6 ) leads to a shift of the T1/2 value towards lower values. In contrast to previous examples, the smaller anion stabilises the HS state. Such behaviour has been ob- served in a few cases, reported by Long et al. and Tuchagues et al..[43,44] This was explained by steric interactions close to the metal centre that stabilise the HS state (shifting of T1/2 towards lower temperatures). Bis(tetrazole)-based 1D poly- mers usually exhibit comparable crystal packings, in which the counterions are situated around the FeII centres. The size and shape of the counterion will determine the anion- to-metal distance. Thus, the use of smaller anions will result in shorter anion-to-metal distances, and will sterically limit the “tilting freedom” of the tetrazole rings. As a result, steri- cally hindered tetrazole rings give rise to low transition tem- peratures. Ultimately, these steric effects may annihilate the spin transition.[43,45] This is observed for compound 2, in which the non-ST centres Fe1 and Fe3 exhibit shorter anion-to-metal distances, compared to the ST centres Fe2 and Fe4. An approximation to estimate the steric constraint around the metallic sphere consists in calculating the S values. High S values are associated with weaker crystal www.chemeurj.org  2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2008, 14, 8486 – 8499 8496 J. G. Haasnoot, P. Gamez et al. fields and therefore with the stabilisation of the HS state.[46] As the ligand is monodentate, the only possible source of distortion is the anion. Based on the structural data avail- able in the literature on bis(tetrazole) spin-transition com- pounds, a correlation between the anion-to-metal distance and the transition temperature is suggested (Figure 10 and Table 6). Long anion-to-metal distances are associated with small changes in the distortion of the octahedron during the spin transition (Figure 10). Interestingly, the cooperative nature of the spin transition has not been altered by the change of counterion. Indeed, both the triflate and the hexafluoridophosphate derivatives show similar slopes. The slightly less steep transition for the perchlorate compound is probably caused by the lower crys- tallinity of the material, which is known to affect the proper- ties of the transition.[4,25] This insignificant effect of the anions suggests that the cooperative nature of this cationic network arises from the intramolecular communication along the polymeric chains. Based on solid-state dilution studies that proved that the cooperativity is influenced by the number of ST centres in the material,[47] the alternating distribution of the ST centres along the chains most likely affects the cooperativity within the system. Therefore, a more cooperative behaviour is expected for compound 1 (for which all FeII centres are ST) than for 2 (which displays an alternating distribution of HS and ST centres). This is evidently not the case, as revealed by the similar transition curves obtained from magnetic susceptibility measurements for the two compounds. LITH experiments performed on compound 2 unambiguously indicate the presence of cooper- ative effects during the transition (Supporting Information). Thus, a plausible explanation for the gradual nature of the transition in this type of materials can be the involvement of internal constraints (short-range intramolecular interactions) that counterbalances the long-range cooperative interac- tions.[36] Compounds 1 and 2 do differ in their LIESST properties. For compound 2 only the irradiation leads to the trapping of the high-spin metastable state. The cmT value for the LIESST-generated HS metastable state of [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[CF3SO3]2 corresponds to the excitation of two iron(II) cen- tres, namely Fe2 and Fe4. This metastable state relaxes back to the LS states with a TACHTUNGTRENUNG(LIESST) of 54 K. The stability of this metastable state depends on the cooperativity, as well as on the transition temperature.[4,48] High T1/2 are associated with lower energy barriers and faster relaxation to the LS state. For compound 1, the T1/2 value is low enough and thus can not explain the absence of a HS metastable state. Re- cently, the distortion of the coordination sphere, Dq, has been related to the TACHTUNGTRENUNG(LIESST) temperature.[49] [q corre- sponds to the sum of the deviations from 608 of the 24 possi- ble q angles.] High Dq values result in higher TACHTUNGTRENUNG(LIESST) temperatures. The DS values corresponding to complexes 1 and 2 allow to compare the respective octahedral distor- tions.[50] In this case, the octahedral distortion for compound 1 is much smaller than that observed for the atoms Fe2 and Fe4 of compound 2. These distinct geometric distortions may be responsible for the different photomagnetic behav- iour. Conclusion The series of compounds [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[PF6]2·CH3OH (1), [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[CF3SO3]2·CH3CN (2) and [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ClO4]2·CH3CN (3) has clearly shown the template role of Figure 10.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 8497 FULL PAPER Spin Crossover the counterions, which determines the spin-transition prop- erties, and allowed the first structural characterisation of an HS–LS alternating coordination chain. Short anion-to-metal distances lead to significant distortions of the octahedral co- ordination environment of the iron(II) centres, resulting in lower temperatures for the spin transition. For the [Fe- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]2+ ion several structural features, that is, DS, the cone angle and the (tetrazole-centroid)-ND-Fe angle, reflect the steric hindrance around the FeII centre. These features are all associated with the size and shape of the counterions, as well as their position in the lattice. The HS fraction re- maining at low temperatures is also linked to the distortion of the octahedron. Apparently, for a certain degree of dis- tortion, the FeII ion remains in HS state through the whole temperature range. This is observed for the triflate deriva- tive, the two HS centres of which show the highest distor- tions of the octahedron. The cooperative nature of the cat- ionic species barely depends on the nature of the anion used, suggesting that the nature of the cooperativity is intra- polymeric. This observation is in contradiction with the fact that the alternating distribution of the ST centres in the 1D chains (···HS–LS–HS···) of the triflate derivative does not affect the cooperative nature of the [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]2+-based ma- terial. Compounds 1 and 2 also differ in their LIESST prop- erties. Only the HS metastable state of the compound 2 can be trapped under light irradiation. The origin of this dispari- ty is not fully understood, but the greater distortion of the octahedral environment around the FeII centres of com- pound 2 appears to be critical. Further structural analysis, including optical and pressure dependent studies, are neces- sary for a better understanding of this cationic system. Experimental Section Elemental analysis: Elemental analyses (C, H, N, S) were performed on a Perkin–Elmer 2400 series II at the Gorlaeus Laboratories. UV/Vis spectroscopy: UV/Vis spectra were obtained on a Perkin–Elmer Lambda 900 spectrophotometer by using the diffuse reflectance tech- nique, with MgO as a reference. A sample holder mounted on a Dewar and in thermal contact with the refrigerant through a copper rod was used to perform measurements at temperatures around 100 K. The spec- tral range used was 200–1200 nm. All samples, crystalline or powder, were crushed when placed in the sample holder. Magnetic susceptibility measurements: Magnetic susceptibility measure- ments were carried out on a Quantum Design MPMS-5S SQUID magne- tometer. The SQUID probes the total magnetisation of the sample by measuring the induced currents in a Josephson junction when moving the sample in between coils. The accessible field is up to 5 T, and the temper- ature ranges from 1.8 to 400 K. The data were measured at 1000 G from 4 to 300 K. Data were corrected for magnetisation of the sample holder and for the diamagnetic contributions, which were estimated from the PascalWs tables.[51] Samples made out of single crystals were gently crushed prior to measurement. Mçssbauer spectroscopy: Mçssbauer data were recorded on a spectrome- ter with alternating constant acceleration. The minimum experimental line width was 0.24 mms1 (full width at half-height). The sample temper- ature was maintained in an Oxford Instrument Variox cryostat and the 57Co/Rh source (1.8 GBq) was at room temperature. Isomer shifts are quoted relative to iron metal at 300 K. X-ray data for [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[PF6]2·MeOH (1): X-ray data were collected at 200 K and 100 K, respectively, on a Nonius KappaCCD diffractometer on rotating anode with graphite-monochromated MoKa radiation (l= 0.71073 P). The structures were solved with direct methods using SHELXS86[52] and refined on F2 with SHELXL-97.[53] The hydrogen atoms were included in the refinement at calculated positions and refined riding on the atoms to which they are attached with standard SHELXL- 97 geometry and isotropic displacement parameter constraints.[53] The methanol inclusion solvent molecule was included with a disorder model. Both the carbon and the oxygen atoms of the methanol molecule were disordered in two positions with an occupational factor of 0.5. X-ray data for [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[CF3SO3]2·CH3CN (2): X-ray data were collect- ed at 170 K and 100 K respectively on a Nonius KappaCCD diffractome- ter on rotating anode with graphite-monochromated MoKa radiation (l= 0.71073 P). The structures were solved with direct methods using SHELXS86[52] and refined on F2 with SHELXL-97.[53] The hydrogen atoms were included in the refinement at calculated positions and refined riding on the atoms to which they are attached with standard SHELXL- 97 geometry and isotropic displacement parameter constraints.[53] The crystals are merohedrally twinned (matrix: [100/010/001]) with twin fraction 50:50. Merohedral twinning is a special case of crystallographic twinning where the lattices of twin (different) domains (in a single crys- tal) overlap in three dimensions. For instance, two domains in which one of them is rotated 1808 with respect to the other. Synthesis of m-xylyleneACHTUNGTRENUNG(bis)tetrazole (btzx): m-Xylylenediamine(5 g, 0.037 mol), triethylorthoformate (54 g, 0.363 mol) and sodium azide (4.79 g, 0.074 mol) were dissolved in acetic acid (90 mL) and heated at 908C for 2 d. After cooling down to room temperature, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The remaining yellow solid was washed with methanol and water yielding the ligand as a white powder. Yield=64%; 1H NMR (300 MHz, [D6]DMSO): d=5.7 (s, 4H; ttz-CH2- ph), 7.4 (m, 4H; ph), 9.5 ppm (s, 2H; ttz); IR: n˜ =3116.5 cm1 (nCttz-H); el- emental analysis calcd (%) for C10H10N8: C 49.58, H, 4.16, N 46.26; found: C 49.09, H 4.13, N 45.59.

Synthesis of [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[CF3SO3]2·CH3CN (2): Three equivalents of btzx (50 mg, 0.21 mmol) dissolved in acetonitrile (5 mL) were added to one equivalent of FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(CF3SO3)2·6H2O (32.3 mg, 0.07 mmol) dissolved in aceto- nitrile (5 mL) containing ascorbic acid (ca. 20 mg). The solution was heated for an hour at 508C. The solution was then placed in a tube and diethyl ether was added until a light white precipitate had formed. Next, the tube was capped and left unperturbed for 2–3 h. Transparent single crystals appeared on the walls of the tube. The crystals were then washed with acetonitrile.

Synthesis of [FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(btzx)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ClO4]2·CH3CN (3): Three equivalents of btzx (100 mg, 0.41 mmol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (15 mL). A solution of one equivalent of FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(ClO4)2 (35 mg, 0.14 mmol) in acetonitrile (15 mL) was added to the ligand solution. The resulting transparent solution was heated for 2 h and filtered. The filtrate was left unperturbed to allow the slow evaporation of the solvent. A white crystalline powder appeared after a few days. This solid material was filtered and washed with acetoni- trile.

Top: plane1 where six sulfur atoms adopt a chair-like conformation, while the carbon atoms are almost all in the plane; bottom: plane2 where the six sulfur atoms are all in-plane, and the six carbon atoms are in a chair-like disposition. Plane1 incorporates the Fe1 and the Fe4 atoms, while plane2 contains the Fe2 and the Fe3 atoms. These two planes present some differences, especially in the position of the counterion. In plane1, six sulfur atoms adopt a chair-like conformation, while the carbon atoms are almost all in the plane. In contrast, in plane2, the six sulfur atoms are all in-plane, and the six carbon atoms are in a chair-like disposition. The atoms-to-plane distances are much longer for the sulfur atoms in plane1 than for the carbon atoms in plane2, suggesting that plane2 is more compact than plane1. This difference is reflected by the cone-angle1 between the metal centres forming the different planes. For Fe1 and Fe4, these angles are closer to the ideal value of 90º than for Fe2 and Fe3, indicating that the tetrazole-coordination angles are clearly influenced by the anions disposition in the plane. Interestingly, these different dispositions of the counterions are not reflected in the distances between the metal centres of the two planes (see Table 4). 1 The cone angle is the angle formed by the centroids of two tetrazoles of the same side of the plane formed by the iron(II) atoms.
