Manuscript Synthesis, X-ray Crystal Structures, and Gas Sorption Properties of Pillared Square Grid Nets Based on Paddle-Wheel Motifs: Implications for Hydrogen Storage in Porous Materials Hyungphil Chun, Danil N. Dybtsev, Hyunuk Kim, and Kimoon Kim*[a] Introduction One of the most important developments in chemical re- search in this decade will involve studies on coordination polymers with a crystal lattice. According to a survey report- ed in a recent review,[1a] more than one thousand reports are projected to appear on the topic within this year. Metal-or- ganic open frameworks, coordination polymers with a void space accessible to various guest molecules, are gaining im- portance accordingly. Although it has been only a few years since the first reports of such materials with a permanent porosity,[2] many review articles have been dedicated to the structural and functional aspects of metal-organic open frameworks.[1] The strong interests in this field are partly due to intrinsic advantages over conventional porous materi- als, such as activated carbons and zeolites. They include facile syntheses based on the self-assembly of molecular components and the highly crystalline nature of products, which not only allows single-crystal X-ray diffraction analy- sis, but also guarantees the reproducibility and consistency of physical properties. Besides, the well-defined geometry of molecular components significantly improves the predicta- bility of the crystalline phase of products. Of special inter- ests among the advantageous properties pertinent to the present work is the ability to modify pore environments while maintaining the topology of the host framework.[3] As the automobile and fuel cell industry looks for an effi- cient method to store and transport hydrogen,[4] metal-or- ganic porous materials have been closely examined for their gas sorption properties. The results from recent papers on hydrogen sorption in metal-organic porous materials,[5] how- ever, do not converge to a singular conclusion that might be Abstract: A systematic modulation of organic ligands connecting dinuclear paddle-wheel motifs leads to a series of isomorphous metal-organic porous ma- terials that have a three-dimensional connectivity and interconnected pores. Aromatic dicarboxylates such as 1,4- benzenedicarboxylate (1,4-bdc), tetra- methylterephthalate (tmbdc), 1,4-naph- thalenedicarboxylate (1,4-ndc), tetra- fluoroterephthalate (tfbdc), or 2,6- naphthalenedicarboxylate (2,6-ndc) are linear linkers that form two-dimension- al layers, and diamine ligands, 4- diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (dabco) or 4,4’-dipyridyl (bpy), coordinate at both sides of Zn2 paddle-wheel units to bridge the layers vertically. The result- ing open frameworks [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2- (dabco)] (1), [Zn2(1,4-bdc)(tmbdc)- (dabco)] (2), [Zn2(tmbdc)2(dabco)] (3), [Zn2(1,4-ndc)2(dabco)] (4), [Zn2- (tfbdc)2(dabco)] (5), and [Zn2(tmbdc)2- (bpy)] (8) possess varying size of pores and free apertures originating from the side groups of the 1,4-bdc derivatives. [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(bpy)] (6) and [Zn2(2,6- ndc)2(bpy)] (7) have two- and threefold interpenetrating structures, respective- ly. The non-interpenetrating frame- works (1–5 and 8) possess surface areas in the range of 1450–2090 m2g1 and hydrogen sorption capacities of 1.7– 2.1 wt% at 78 K and 1 atm. A detailed analysis of the sorption data in con- junction with structural similarities and differences concludes that porous ma- terials with straight channels and large openings do not perform better than those with wavy channels and small openings in terms of hydrogen storage through physisorption.

For example, it is not clear whether a porous material with a higher sur- face area always uptakes more hydrogen than others, wheth- er hydrogen adsorbs better on a certain surface than others, or whether it is possible to influence hydrogen sorption in porous materials with chemical functionalities. This study is an effort to gain an insight into these ques- tions, and here we present single-crystal X-ray structures and gas sorption properties of metal-organic frameworks that are systematically modulated from a prototype that we have reported recently.[5a] The original framework [Zn2(1,4- bdc)2(dabco)] (1) displays relatively high H2 sorption capaci- ty, namely 2.0 wt% at 78 K and 1 atm. Therefore, we set out to vary the ligands, 1,4-bdc (1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and dabco (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), without altering the overall connectivity of the nets and to monitor the differen- ces in H2 gas sorption behavior under the same conditions. The dicarboxylate and diamine ligands used to construct the sister nets are shown in Scheme 1. First, a dicarboxylate linker with aliphatic (tetramethylterephthalate, tmbdc), aro- matic (1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate, 1,4-ndc), or halogenic (tetrafluoroterephthalate, tfbdc) side groups on the phenyl ring was used instead of 1,4-bdc in 1, which resulted in a series of isomorphous frameworks 2–5. Then, the linker and diamine pillar in 1 were replaced with longer ones, such as, 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (2,6-ndc) and 4,4’-dipyridyl (bpy), respectively, and frameworks 6–8 were obtained. Structural features arising from the substitutions and results of gas sorption experiments will be discussed in detail in order to draw a conclusion which may be useful in designing a new metal-organic porous material for gas-storage applica- tions. Results and Discussion Synthesis and structural characterization: The so-called “pil- laring” strategy[6] in designing metal-organic open frame- works involves using appropriate pillars to connect well-de- fined two-dimensional (2D) layers either in a one-pot reac- tion[7] or in two separate steps.[8] Throughout a series of pre- liminary experiments, we noticed that solvothermal reac- tions of Zn2+ and aromatic dicarboxylic acid in DMF predominantly produce 2D layered structures based on “paddle-wheel” units.[9] With solvent molecules occupying both ends of the dinuclear center this type of charge-neutral 2D layers would be ideal candidates to pillar, and therefore, we set out to construct 3D open frameworks by using linear connectors along with Zn2+ and dicarboxylic acid. Unsuc- cessful attempts include the use of pyrazine or 1,4-dicyano- benzene which, in the presence of DMF as the solvent, does not bridge between two Zn2+ ions. When dabco was used as the pillaring agent, however, we obtained a 3D framework with expected connectivity, and the porous and dynamic nature of the framework [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco)] (1) has re- cently been reported.[5a] Following this lead, we examined a series of isomorphous frameworks by a systematic modula- tion of 1, and open frameworks 2–8 were obtained. The synthesis involves heating a solution of the reactants, typically in DMF or in a MeOH/DMF mixture, to 90–1208C in a closed vessel. The reactions are reproducible, and can be readily scaled up to produce a gram quantity of crystal- line products. The structures were deduced by X-ray crystal- lographic analysis on single crystals, and powder diffraction patterns of bulk samples were compared to their simulations based on single-crystal structures to confirm the phase purity (see Supporting Information). No secondary phase was observed in any of the reaction products described above for 2–8. Frameworks 2 and 3 are derived by a partial or complete, respectively, replacement of 1,4-bdc in 1 with tmbdc (Fig- ure 1a and b). The methyl groups of tmbdc reduce the size of windows, which are already smaller than those in 1 due to a non-zero dihedral angle between phenyl and carboxylate planes (75.0(1)8 for 2 and 73.9(1)8 for 3). Therefore, the pore structure of 3 is characterized by cavities measuring 6– 8  interconnected through 3.5  windows. The free volume in 3, estimated from the crystal structure (30%), is far underestimated due to the two- fold conformational disorder in tmbdc linkers. Considering that 1 has a solvent-accessible free volume of approximately 62%, the void volume in the crystals of 2 and 3 is expected to be in the range of 45–55%. It is noted that the formation of 3 contradicts a previous belief[10] that tmbdc does not allow a square-grid net based on paddle-wheel units for steric reasons. We assume that alter- nating orientations of phenyl Scheme 1. Linkers (L) and pillars (P) in paddle-wheel-based nets 1–8.  2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org Chem. Eur. J. 2005, 11, 3521 – 3529 3522 rings around a square of four paddle-wheels renders enough space to accommodate the methyl groups. As a conse- quence, the tmbdc linkers are conformationally disordered over two positions in the crystal structures of 2 and 3, and in the case of 2, 1,4-bdc and tmbdc statistically occupy the same positions (see Supporting Information). The refined site occupancy factors of 1,4-bdc and tmbdc in the X-ray structure converged to a value close to equal contributions from each component. More directly, the 1:1 stoichiometry of 1,4-bdc and tmbdc in 2 has been established by a 1H NMR measurement of the product dissolved in NaOH/ D2O solution, in which three singlets are observed with ex- pected chemical shifts in a ratio of 1:3:3 for the protons of 1,4-bdc, dabco, and tmbdc, respectively. Aromatic substituents on the phenyl ring of 1,4-bdc may play a different role from that of alkyl substituents in gas sorption, and therefore, 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate (1,4- ndc) was used in place of 1,4-bdc to obtain an isomorphous framework 4 (Figure 1c). Although the naphthalene moiety of 1,4-ndc is disordered in a way similar to tmbdc in 3 (see Supporting Information), the overall connectivity and the underlying topology of 4 are unambiguously defined to be the same as those of 1–3. Again, without alternating orienta- tions of the naphathalene moieties in a square of four paddle-wheel units the steric hindrance would have not al- lowed the formation of 4. The dihedral angle between carbox- ylate and aromatic planes (69.2(1)8) is somewhat smaller than that for tmbdc in 2 and 3. Structural characteristics, such as pore size, channel shape, and free volume of 4 are as expect- ed not much different from those of 3 except for the nature of the chemical functionality. For instance, frameworks 3 and 4 have an equal number of extra carbon atoms in the back- bone compared to 1, whereas they are one half in 2. There- fore, if the side groups of the 1,4-bdc derivatives are inactive towards gas sorption, then the decrease in the surface area in 3 and 4 from 1 should be simi- lar and significantly larger than in 2. Of particular curiosity for us during this systematic modula- tion process was whether an electronic factor plays a role in the physisorption of gas al- though this was counterintui- tive. Therefore, we decided to use a tetrahalo-substituted linker, and a simple geometric consideration was enough to realize that tetrabromo- or tet- rachloro-substituted 1,4-bdc are sterically too demanding for a paddle-wheel-based square grid net since the dihedral angle between the phenyl ring and carboxylate plane should be nearly 908. Consequently, we focused our efforts on the synthesis of an isomorphous framework with tetrafluoroter- ephthalic acid (H2tfbdc). The product thus obtained was for- mulated as [Zn2(tfbdc)2(dabco)] (5) based on X-ray crystal- lographic analysis on a single crystal which was completely evacuated prior to the diffraction measurements.[11] The dif- ference Fourier map after final refinements of the frame- work atoms is virtually flat,[12] and the solvent-accessible voids in the crystal are estimated to account for 55% of the crystal volume, with the simultaneous occupation of all dis- ordered sites of dabco ligands. Unlike 2–4, the dicarboxylate linker in the crystal structure of 5 (Figure 1d) is conforma- tionally ordered, and the dihedral angle between the phenyl ring and carboxylate plane is 44.4(3)8. The fully ordered, al- ternating orientations of tetrafluorophenyl moieties around a square in 5 verify the simple geometric requirement to ac- commodate the side groups of the 1,4-bdc derivatives in 2–4 discussed above. A CuII analogue of 5 and its structure based on X-ray powder diffraction analysis was published at the time of writing this paper.[8a] The structure of the CuII framework in the report is similar to that of 5 except for the Figure 1.

KGaA, Weinheim 3523 FULL PAPER Pillared Square Grid Nets fact that the structure was de- fined in space group P4/mmm where the tfbdc linker should have been conformationally dis- ordered. The crystal structure of 5 is best described in space group P4/nbm with a unit cell volume twice that of P4/mmm. Note that setting the space group for 2–4 to P4/nbm with a doubled unit cell volume does not make the dicarboxylate linkers ordered: they are inher- ently disordered. Each of the cavity-like pores in 5 is equivalent to others; four tfbdc units point inward and four outward. The channels along the c axis have a free passage of 6 , and the cavity surrounded by eight paddle-wheel units measures 7.511 2 considering the van der Waals surface of the framework atoms. The volume of the cavity-like pore (633 3) is equivalent to ap- proximately 15 hydrogen-bonded water molecules. For com- parison, 1 has straight channels with a 7.5- opening and an internal diameter of 10–11 . The free volume per cavity of 1 of 708 3 is also somewhat larger than that of 5. Figure 2 compares the solvent-accessible surface of derivatized frameworks 3 and 5 to their parent net 1, and clearly shows the changes in pore environments caused by the extra func- tional groups. From the gas-sorption point of view, 5 has a disadvantage compared to 1 not because of the slightly re- duced pore size, but because of its higher framework density originating from the fluorine atoms. The densities for 5 and 1 based on crystallographic analysis are 1.034 and 0.826 gcm3, respectively. In an effort to obtain an isomorphous net with a frame- work density lower and surface area higher than 1, we tried to replace 1,4-bdc and dabco ligands in 1 with 2,6-ndc and bpy, respectively. This natural expansion of the series led to the successful isolation of [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(bpy)] (6) and [Zn2- (2,6-ndc)2(bpy)] (7) where the network topology is exactly as expected (Figure 3a and c). The pores of the expanded nets, however, are found to be too large for a dinuclear paddle-wheel node, and not surprisingly, two- and threefold interpenetrations by the same net are observed in 6 and 7, respectively (Figure 3b and d). A CuII analogue of 6, and its characterization by X-ray powder diffraction and gas sorp- tion studies have previously been reported.[13] Meanwhile, the threefold interpenetration in 7 eliminates most of the void space in the structure, and therefore it was not studied further for gas sorption. We thought that by using a derivative of 1,4-bdc the inter- penetration observed in 6 could be avoided by reducing the size of pores and free apertures along the c direction. There- fore, H2tmbdc was used along with bpy in the same synthetic protocol. This resulted in a non-interpenetrating 3D frame- work [Zn2(tmbdc)2(bpy)] (8). Again, the overall connectivity and underlying topology of 8 are the same as the rest of the frameworks, as shown in Figure 3e. Compared to the parent net 1, in which the largest opening is along the c axis, the open structure of 8, which has large pores measuring 8 10 2, allows a maximum free-passage of 7.5  in the a or b direction, whereas the window in the c direction (3.5 ) is partially blocked by tetramethylphenyl moieties as in the case of 3. In terms of the cavity size, 3 and 8 share the same dimensions except for the length of the pillar, and the dis- Figure 2.

Kim et al. tance between two nearest zinc ions separated by the pillar- ing ligand is 6.7 and 11.1  in 3 and 8, respectively. The structural relationship between 8 and 3, and between 3 and other frameworks will be important in analyzing gas sorp- tion properties. Both the tmbdc linker and the bpy pillar in 8 are rotationally disordered, and the solvent-accessible voids in the structure calculated after allowing simultaneous occupations of all disordered sites account for 48% of the crystal volume. Framework 8 has a crystallographic density (0.731 gcm3) lower than that of 1, while they share the same connectivity and topology, and therefore it would be interesting to see whether the lower framework density leads to a higher surface area. Results of the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for frameworks 2–5 and 8 measured under a N2 atmosphere are shown in Figure 4. The observed weight losses for 3 (25.7%) and 4 (25.5%) are reasonably close to calculated values based on elemental analysis (27.2% for 3 and 27.6% for 4). For others, such a comparison is not made since the exact amount of guests in as-synthesized samples is unknown due to severe disorder in X-ray structures and inconsistent ele- mental analysis. In principle, TGA measurements alone cannot be used to determine the stability of an open struc- ture since it may collapse without a notable change in the weight. However, the data in Figure 4 suggest that the porous nets in this study have a stability range 200–3208C under an inert atmosphere. X-ray powder diffraction analy- ses carried out for the evacuated solids confirm the stability of the open structures in the absence of guest molecules (Figure 5). For 3, X-ray diffraction patterns were measured at different temperatures to unambiguously establish the stability of its bulk phase. The fully evacuated open struc- tures have been found to be stable at least up to 2008C in air (Figure 6). Note that there is an unusual line broadening Figure 4.

A collapse of the framework can be ruled out since the peaks reversibly sharpen as the sample gets re-sol- vated. Instead, we suspect that an unknown dynamic proper- ty exists in the evacuated structure owing to the increased length of the pillar that supports the porous network with- out interpenetration. Nevertheless, 8 displays permanent po- rosity and a high surface area, as we will show below with gas sorption data. Notably, from Figure 5 and 6, none of the frameworks show the dynamic behavior observed in 1[5a] upon the inclusion and removal of guest molecules in the pores. Gas sorption properties: The porosity and specific surface areas of framework materials 2–5 and 8 were estimated by measuring nitrogen gas sorption isotherms at 78 K. The sorption of hydrogen gas has also been studied under the same conditions. The isotherms are shown in Figure 7, and the results of the analysis are summarized in Table 1. In all cases the sorption of nitrogen reaches near-satura- tion at low relative pressures (P/P0 < 0.05) and thereafter increases very slowly up to 1 atm. These are type I isotherms typical for a microporous material. There is no significant hysteresis between sorption and desorption traces (see the Supporting Information). The total pore volume (Table 1), which is the volume adsorbed at STP when P/P0 approaches 1, ranges from 0.45 (8) to 0.59 cm3cm3 (5). Although smaller than that of 1 (0.62 cm3cm3), the numbers compare favorably with those of most zeolites ( 0.50 cm3cm3).[14] With an ap- proximation based on a mono- layer condensation of adsorbed N2 molecules on a uniform sur- face, the sorption isotherms were fitted to a Langmuir equa- tion and gave surface areas for the derivatized frameworks from 1400 (8) to 1740 m2g1 (2). The same calculations for unmodified framework 1 gave a Langmuir surface area of 2090 m2g1. Introduction of substituents on the phenyl ring of 1,4-bdc results in a significant decrease in the surface area of 2–5 with respect to that of 1, which may be easily understood and expected from the crystal structures. The increase in the surface area as well as in the number of adsorbed N2 mole- cules per formula unit of 8 compared to that of 3 is viewed in the same context. However, the chemical nature of the side groups of the 1,4-bdc derivatives (aliphatic (3), aromat- ic (4), or halogenic (5)) appears to be irrelevant with regard to the trends observed. The shape of the H2 sorption isotherms shown in Figure 7 is typical for their kind,[5] and is attributed to the fact that the temperature (1968C) is well above the boiling point of hydrogen (2538C at 1 atm). The sorption and desorption curves almost overlap for 1–3; however, a marked hysteresis is observed for 4 and to a lesser degree for 5 and 8 (see the Supporting Information). We cannot correlate the observed hysteresis with pore structures of corresponding frameworks (Figure 2) at the moment; however, such behavior may be Figure 7. N2 (left) and H2 (right) gas sorption isotherms of 2–5 and 8 measured at 78 K. Data for 1 are shown for comparison. The N2 isotherms are rever- sible without a significant hysteresis between sorption and desorption curves, whereas H2 isotherms of 4 display some hysteresis (see Supporting Informa- tion). Solid lines in H2 isotherms are visual aids. Table 1. Summary of N2 and H2 gas sorption data.

Kim et al. of interest since it allows H2 to be stored at a pressure lower than when it is charged.[15] A characteristic feature that is clearly apparent from the H2 sorption isotherms shown in Figure 7 is the different slopes of the curves in the low pressure ranges (P<0.4 atm). For example, 3, in which 1,4-bdc is completely replaced by tmbdc, shows the fastest rise in H2 uptake, whereas the ini- tial slope of 1 is the flattest in the series. It may not be a co- incidence that free apertures in the structures of 3 and 1 are the smallest and largest, respectively, among the isomor- phous frameworks. The free channels in 1 along the c axis are uniform and straight with the diameter of 7.5 , whereas those of 3 have several indentations with the narrowest part being barely over 3 . In general, the lower pressure range (P/P00.3) in BET isotherms is considered as the region where gas molecules cover the surface almost exclusively as a monolayer. Therefore, it may be said that the affinity of H2 molecules towards the frameworks in this study is the highest for 3, intermediate for 2, 4, and 8, and lowest for 1 and 5. We believe that the shape and size of channels, rather than the chemical nature of organic linkers, are responsible for this trend. Further support for this argument is available from the similar values of sorbed H2 at 1 atm, 187– 230 cm3g1 or 1.7–2.1 wt%,[16] which become more uniform when translated into molecular terms, such as the number of sorbed H2 molecules per paddle-wheel unit (from 5.7 H2 for 1 and 4 to 6.5 H2 in 2). The lack of differences consequently leads to a relative surface coverage by H2 [17] which is in an approximately reverse order to that of the surface area de- termined by N2 sorption experiments. Thus, similar to our analysis on the surface affinity, 3 and 1 have the most and least effective surface coverage with 50 and 37%, respec- tively. The fraction of pore volume occupied by adsorbed H2 may be an alternative representation of the relative surface coverage by H2, and the values for frameworks 1–5 and 8 are in good agreement (the last column of Table 1). Taken together with studies on other metal-organic open frameworks,[5] it appears that some metal-organic frame- works possess higher affinity towards H2 than other frame- works, and we believe that they are the ones with wavy channels and limited size of free passage rather than those with straight channels and large openings. This conjecture, which is derived from the analysis of experimental data, is consistent with a theoretical study on methane sorption[18] that considers the heat of adsorption, which is higher in smaller pores, as an index of energetic interaction between sorbate and sorbent. Another theoretical study on a metal- organic framework[19] having two kinds of pores also sug- gests that the preferred adsorption site for argon is smaller pores. The ultimate capacity for H2 storage, on the other hand, should also be related to available surface area, since a “pore-filling” effect will become significant under high pressure conditions. This is also evident from the H2 sorp- tion isotherm of 3, which has the highest initial slope but al- ready begins to saturate in the given pressure range. There- fore, an ideal porous material intended for storing hydrogen gas through physisorption would have to possess a large sur- face area, high void fraction, sinuous channels with a curva- ture and free windows of limited size. Based on our data and those in literature, we propose that a porous material with the surface area of 2000 m2g1 or above, a void fraction of 60% or more, and free windows of 6  or less may show an unprecedented H2 storage capacity. We believe that it is not impossible to meet the first and the last requirements within the same material, and our current effort is focused on new metal-organic frameworks to realize this goal. Conclusion We have successfully synthesized and fully characterized a series of 3D metal-organic frameworks in which dinuclear paddle-wheel units are connected by linear linkers and di- amine pillars. The metal–dicarboxylate–diamine system allows a systematic modulation of either or both the linkers and pillars without changing the a-Po topology, that is, the change can be made anisotropically. Gas sorption studies reveal that the closely related materials possess a permanent porosity in terms of reversible gas sorption and high surface area. The aromatic (1,4-ndc in 4) or electron-withdrawing groups of the dicarboxylate linker (tfbdc in 5) have not been found to exert a favorable influence on the physisorption of N2 or H2 gas molecules. The amounts of nitrogen sorption and the surface areas determined from it do not depart greatly from expectations based on the crystal structures. In the case of hydrogen, however, framework 3, which has the most crowded pore environment, shows the highest affinity towards the gas at low pressures, and the sorption capacities of related materials measured at 1 atm do not directly mirror the available surface areas judging from the similar numbers of sorbed H2 molecules per formula unit. There- fore, as a hydrogen-storage material we suggest preference should be given to a system in which small windows and sin- uous channels lead to a high surface area. This conclusion helps to better understand the physisorption of gases in metal-organic frameworks and should help to design new porous materials with an efficient hydrogen-storage capaci- ty. Experimental Section General considerations: All the ligands and transition metal salts were obtained commercially and used as received. TGA data were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA instrument with a heating rate of 108Cmin1 under a N2 atmosphere. The X-ray powder diffraction pat- terns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Avance system equipped with a Cu sealed tube (l=1.54178 ) at a scan rate of 10 sdeg1. BET gas sorption isotherms were measured with a custom-made vacuum manifold follow- ing a standard volumetric technique at 78 K. The hydrogen gas used was purchased from BOC Gases Korea and was of high purity (99.999%). Typically, a sample of as-synthesized material (150–200 mg) was loaded and, prior to the measurements, evacuated by heating to 1208C under a high vacuum (105 torr) overnight. For 5 and 8, the evacuation was car- ried out at room temperature after exchanging the guests with CHCl3. Chem. Eur. J. 2005, 11, 3521 – 3529 www.chemeurj.org  2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

After the white precipitate had been filtered off by gravity, the so- lution was heated to 1208C in a sealed glass tube for two days to produce colorless, brick-shaped crystals (27 mg). The product was washed with DMF and dried at 1058C under vacuum overnight to obtain an evacuated framework (20 mg, 63%). A portion of the desolvated solid was added to NaOH in D2O and subjected to 1H NMR measurements. 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O, 258C, TMS): d=7.80 (4H; bdc), 2.65 (12.2H; dabco), 2.06 ppm (11.8H; tmbdc). Elemental analysis was carried out for evacu- ated samples because of inconsistent results from as-synthesized materi- als. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for [Zn2(1,4-bdc)(tmbdc)(dabco)]·3H2O (681.32): C 45.84, H 5.03, N 4.11; found: C 45.54, H 4.59, N 4.41. Synthesis of [Zn2(tmbdc)2(dabco)] (3): H2tmbdc (140 mg, 0.63 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (189 mg, 0.63 mmol) and dabco (35 mg, 0.31 mmol) were mixed in DMF (15 mL) and homogenized by stirring for 2 h. The slurry was heated to 1208C in a Teflon-lined stainless still bomb reactor for 32 h to obtain a white microcrystalline precipitate (275 mg, 93%). Single crys- tals for structural study were obtained by following the same procedure described above for 2. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for as-synthesized material [Zn2(tmbdc)2(dabco)]·3DMF·2H2O (938.70): C 49.90, H 6.55, N 7.46; found C 49.39, H 6.70, N 7.82. Synthesis of [Zn2(1,4-ndc)2(dabco)] (4): The standard protocol described above for 2 was employed, and brick-shaped crystals with greenish yellow color were obtained in 76% yield. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for as-synthesized material [Zn2(1,4-ndc)2(dabco)]·3DMF·2H2O (926.60): C 50.55, H 5.33, N 7.56; found: C 50.62, H 5.32, N 7.86. Synthesis of [Zn2(tfbdc)2(dabco)] (5): Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (119 mg, 0.40 mmol) and H2tfbdc (96 mg, 0.40 mmol) were dissolved in methanol (5 mL). After dabco (22 mg, 0.20 mmol) and DMF (1.2 mL) were added to the mixture, it was stirred for 1 h at room temperature, and then a white precipitate was filtered off. The resulting solution, upon heating to 958C for 7 h, produced colorless, brick-shaped crystals. The product (105 mg) was washed with DMF and methanol and heated to 958C under vacuum overnight to give evacuated framework (79 mg, 55%). C,H,N analysis was carried out for evacuated samples. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for [Zn2(tfbdc)2(dabco)]·2H2O (751.12): C 35.18, H 2.15, N 3.73; found: C 35.62, H 2.69, N 4.07. Synthesis of [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(bpy)] (6): Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (89 mg, 0.30 mmol) and H2bdc (50 mg, 0.30 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of MeOH and DMF (1:1, 6 mL). Addi- tion of bpy (23 mg, 0.15 mmol) to the mixture led to formation a white slurry. The heterogeneous mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and heated to 1208C in a closed vessel for two days. A microcrystalline pre- cipitate was isolated, thoroughly washed with DMF, and dried in vacuo (85 mg, 92%). Single crystals for struc- tural study were obtained from the same reaction in a DMF/xylene mixed solvent. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for evacuated solid [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2- (bpy)] (615.15): C 50.76, H 2.62, N 4.55; found C 50.43, H 2.75, N 4.89. Synthesis of [Zn2(2,6-ndc)2(bpy)] (7): The same procedure as that for 6 was used for this compound except for the use of H2(2,6-ndc) instead of H2bdc. The yield was nearly quantitative. Ele- mental analysis calcd (%) for [Zn2(2,6- ndc)2(bpy)]·0.5DMF·H2O (769.86): C 55.39, H 3.34, N 4.55; found: C 55.16, H 3.04, N 4.58. Synthesis of [Zn2(tmbdc)2(bpy)] (8): This compound was obtained as col- orless block-shaped crystals by following the same procedure as that for 2. The as-synthesized product was guest-exchanged with CHCl3 and evac- uated under vacuum at room temperature. The yield was nearly quantita- tive. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for [Zn2(tmbdc)2(bpy)]·2H2O (763.43): C 53.49, H 4.75, N 3.67; found: C 53.60, H 4.85, N 4.32. Crystal structure determination: Single crystals were picked up with para- ton oil on the tip of a glass fiber and mounted on a Siemens SMART CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromated MoKa (l=0.71073 ) radiation source in a cold nitrogen stream. For 2, 4, and 5 diffraction data were collected for both as-synthesized and evacuated crystals, and only the latter are reported here. For 3 and 8, contributions from disordered solvent molecules were removed by the SQUEEZE rou- tine (PLATON),[20] and the outputs from the SQUEEZE calculations are attached to each CIF file. All crystallographic data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects (SAINT), and semiempirical absorption corrections based on equivalent reflections were applied (SADABS). The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method on F2 with appropriate software implemented in the SHELXTL program package. All the non-hydrogen atoms except for those of disordered solvent molecules in 6 were refined anisotropically with least-squares restraints, when necessary. Hydrogen atoms were added at their geometrically ideal positions. Conformationally disordered ligands were treated with split-atom models. Crystal data and results of the structure refinements are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3. CCDC 255610–CCDC-255616 (2–8) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.
