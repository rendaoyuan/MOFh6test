These observations, supported by DFT calculations, influence our understanding of the reactivity of lithiated di- azomethanes towards aryl isothiocyanates, suggesting as they do that previously observed product selectivity in these reactions is critically dependent on temperature control exer- cised during the process. (Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2003) 1-Li has found ready use in the preparation of substituted triazoles[7] and tetrazoles,[8] the syntheses of aldehydes from ketones,[9] Colvin rearrangements[10] and the formation of synthetically useful[11] silyl ketenes.[12] These last species re- act with phosphorus ylides and so afford a simple route to silyl allenes.[13] In this context, central to the synthesis[13] of the disubstituted silyl ketene 3, is the formation, by the sequential treatment of 1-H with n-butyllithium and carbon monoxide, of a lithium ynolate 2. This latter species is con- sidered to result from the insertion[14] of CO into the pro- posed CLi bond in 1-Li, whereupon N2 is eliminated (Scheme 1), the addition of triethylsilyl trifluoromethanes- ulfonate (Et3SiOTf) and subsequent work-up affording 3.

Possible isomers of 1-H[15] (and their relative energies)[17] and 1-Li (and their relative energies, 1 kcal  4.184 kJ) The chemistry of metallated (mono-substituted) diazo- methane has been previously investigated[15] (Figure 1) with results indicating that deprotonation/reprotonation of di- azomethane 4a affords the less stable CH2N2 N-isocy- anoamine isomer 4c, which undergoes base-induced rever- sion to 4a. The other possible non-cyclic CH2N2 isomer (nitrile imine 4b) has not been detected experimentally. The structures and energies of the CH2N2 isomers 4ac, as well as those of their lithiated derivatives, 5ad, have recently been modelled theoretically.[16,17] From these calculations it was suggested that while N-protonation of 5d would give 4c, C-protonation of 5a would yield 4a. Further, consistent with experiment, theory pointed to the most stable 1-H iso- mer (4a) being obtainable, in the presence of base, from energetically less favourable 4c (Scheme 2). This is in spite of the suggestion, based on calculation, that 5a (precursor to 4a) is less stable than 5d; in other words that the reaction is thermodynamically controlled by the stability of the final protonated product. In contrast to the parent diazomethane structures discussed above, calculations[17] have shown that for the lithiated mono-substituted (trimethylsilyl)diazome- thanes 1-Li and 6 (Figure 2), the N-metallated nitrile imine isomer was slightly more stable than the C-lithiate. How- ever, previous attempts to isolate and crystallographically characterise 6 have resulted only in the isolation and struc- tural elucidation of {hexakis[lithio(trimethylsilyl)- diazomethane]·bis[lithio{4,5-bis(trimethylsilyl)triazole}]· heptakis(diethyl ether)} [(7)2·OEt2; Figure 3].[17] This spec- ies is composed both of 6 and lithiotriazole 8, this last com- ponent evidently being formed by the reaction of 6 with 1-H. Suggestions[12,18] that the reactivity of lithiated 1-H is sol- vent dependent have been borne of the observation that whereas it reacts with RNCS (R  alkyl, aryl) in OEt2 to afford 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole (13), in THF thio-1,2,3- triazoles 1012 result (Scheme 3).[18b] However, such dif- Scheme 2.

C- and N-lithiated isomers of 1-Li and their relative ener- gies[17] Figure 3. The molecular structure of (7)2 fering behaviour has not hitherto been explained in detail and this has led us to attempt the isolation and structural characterisation of pure lithiated (trimethylsilyl)diazome- thane (cf. 7) in order to clarify which of the proposed model structures, C- or N-lithiated, better describes the true struc- ture of lithiated 1-H. In this context, we report here on the observation of both kinetic [giving Me3SiCNNLi·TMEDA, 9] and thermodynamic [giving 1-Li·3/2THF] metallation. The latter observation has led to the isolation and structural characterisation of an intermediate in the synthesis of dis- ubstituted silyl ketene 3 (Scheme 1). Finally, we report here on the reactions of lithiodiazomethanes with different iso- thiocyanates with a view to understanding the relationship between the site of lithiation in the substrate and the struc- ture of the final cyclised product. Results and Discussion Solid-State and Theoretical Studies on 1-Li·3/2THF and 9 The reaction of 1-H with nBuLi in THF yielded large yellow crystals of pure lithiated (trimethylsilyl)diazome- thane 1/2[{Me3SiC(Li)N2}2·3THF] (1-Li·3/2THF), the solid- state structure of which we have previously reported.[19] X- Kinetic and Thermodynamic Lithiated Derivatives of a Simple Diazomethane FULL PAPER Scheme 3. Proposed pathways for the reaction of different 1-Li isomers with RNCS (R  Ph, Bz)[12,18] ray crystallography has shown 1-Li·3/2THF to be a polymer based on a repeating tetramer unit (Figure 4), consisting of two (mono-THF) complexed lithiodiazomethane molecules and two (bis-THF) complexed ones i.e. {[Me3SiC(Li·THF)N2]·[Me3SiC(Li·2THF)N2]}2. This revel- ation of two types of lithiodiazomethane molecule in the solid-state structure of 1-Li·3/2THF is consistent with the observation of two sets of CNN stretching modes by IR spectroscopy (νsym  2149, 2116 cm1 and νasym  2092, 2052 cm1) which collapse to a single set upon hy- drolysis to 1-H. The ambiguity surrounding the preferred site of lithiation in 1-H that results from the contrasting structures noted for 1-Li·3/2THF and 7 made it desirable to theoretically probe the relative stabilities and geometries of both N- and C-lithiates. DFT calculations[20] based on a variety of models were undertaken (B3LYP[21]/6-311G** [22]). Energetic results for XCN2Li·nL (X  H3Si, Me3Si; n  0, 1, 2; L  OEt2, THF) are summarised in Table 1 with selected calculated geometrical parameters in Table E1 (see Electronic Supporting Information; see footnote on the first page of this article). Figure 4. The molecular structure of polymeric 1-Li·3/2THF Overall, calculations reported here on lithiodiazome- thanes and their complexes suggest that, while N-metal- lation is thermodynamically preferred, C-metallation be- comes increasingly favourable in the presence of strongly coordinating media. For unsolvated diazomethanes XCN2Li (X  H3Si, Me3Si) C-lithiation is 2.5 kcal·mol1 (I; 1 kcal  4.184 kJ) more energetic than N-lithiation (II) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 33633375 www.eurjic.org 2003 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 3365 for X  H3Si (Table 1 and Figure 5) while for X  Me3Si the computed preference for N- (IV) over C-metallation (III) is 4.0 kcal·mol1, illustrating the electron-donating na- ture of the methyl groups over hydrogen atoms yet still sug- gesting a fine energetic balance between the differently met- allated, unsolvated monomers. Calculated molecular geo- metries show little dependence upon X. Whereas C-lithiates I and III both show relatively long CN (1.283 and 1.282 A˚ , respectively) and short NN (1.141 and 1.144 A˚ , respec- tively) bonds, the opposite is true of N-lithiates II and IV (CN  1.195 A˚ in both, NN  1.201 and 1.205 A˚ , respectively). The structural feature most significantly de- pendent on X is the SiC bond length. This increases sig- nificantly from a mean of 1.798 A˚ to one of 1.817 A˚ on replacing H atoms with Me groupspresumably reflecting both the increased steric requirements of the trimethylsilyl group and its aforementioned inductive effect. The metalloorganic bonds show no significant variation with X. Hence, while the CLi bonds are 1.906 A˚ in both I and III, the NLi ones in II and IV are 1.697 and 1.692 A˚ , respectively. The extension of calculations to the simple mono-sol- vated, monomeric lithiates Me3SiCN2Li·L (L  OEt2, THF) shows that, irrespective of the choice of L, the C- lithiates (V, VII) are higher in energy than the N-lithiates (VI, VIII; Table 1 and Figure 5). All of the resultant struc- ture types are significantly more stable than either III or IV by virtue of Lewis base coordination [∆EComplexation (∆EC)  21.5 (V), 22.9 (VII), 21.5 (VI), 22.7 (VIII) kcal·mol1]. Of note (see below) for both types of L, C- lithiated models show more negative ∆EC values than their N-lithiated counterparts. Moreover, for both C- and N-lithi- ates, both the magnitude of and differences between ∆EC values are enhanced for coordination of the stronger Lewis base (THF). Thus, ∆EC(V)  ∆EC(VI) and ∆EC(VII)  ∆EC(VIII), ∆EC(VII)  ∆EC(V) and ∆EC(VIII)  ∆EC(VI) and, whereas for mono-OEt2 solvation VI is preferred to V by 4.0 kcal·mol1, for mono-THF solvation VII is 3.8 kcal·mol1 more stable than VIII. This implies that N-metallation is less strongly favoured over C-metal- A. E. H. Wheatley et al. FULL PAPER Table 1.

Theoretically modelled structures of the simple C- (I, III) and N-lithiated (II, IV) diazomethanes XCN2Li (X  H3Si, Me3Si) and III·L and IV·L complexes (VVIII; L  OEt2, THF) lation as external solvation increases; an important infer- ence given the previously reported reactivities of lithiated (trimethylsilyl)diazomethanes in different Lewis base me- dia.[12,18] Differences in the calculated energies of the vari- ously coordinated mono-solvates do not, however, translate into significant differences in bonding parameters. Slight changes are noticeable relative to unsolvated III and IV on the inclusion of Lewis base and this is most apparent in increments to CLi lengths (to, 1.959 and 1.956 A˚ for V and VII, respectively, cf. 1.906 A˚ in III) and NLi distances (to, 1.735 and 1.732 A˚ for VI and VIII, respectively, cf. 1.692 A˚ in IV). Calculations on Me3SiCN2Li·2 L (L  OEt2, THF; Table 1 and Figure 6) reinforce the view that, irrespective of the choice of L, the preference for N- over C-lithiation is diminished as external solvation of the metal is introduced. The resultant structure types (IXXII) are all significantly more stable than models VVIII [∆EC  33.7 (IX), 40.1 (XI), 32.6 (X), 38.7 (XII) kcal·mol1]. As for VVIII, ∆EC is most negative for solvation by THF while 2003 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 33633375 3366 the predilection for N-metallation is minimised in this me- dium [Me3SiC(Li·2THF)N2 (XI) is only 2.6 kcal·mol1 less stable than Me3SiCN2Li·2THF (XII)]. The addition of a second Lewis base molecule causes the further extension of CLi (to, 2.055 and 2.038 A˚ for IX and XI, respectively) and NLi bonds (to 1.801 A˚ for both of X and XII). Figure 6. Modelled structures of monomeric III·2L and IV·2L complexes IXXII; L  OEt2, THF) and III·L and IV·L (L  TMEDA) While the gas phase calculations do not account for the aggregation behaviour either of 1-Li·3/2THF or of 7 it is nonetheless apparent that some useful correlations exist be- tween theory and experiment. Table E1 (Supp. Inf.) indi- cates close carbonnitrogen and the nitrogennitrogen bond length agreement both between 1-Li·3/2THF and I (Figure 5) and between 7 and II. Clearly, in 1-Li·3/2THF the carbonnitrogen bond (mean 1.326 A˚ ) is longer than a double one and the nitrogennitrogen bond (1.182 A˚ ) is shorter than a double one.[23] Furthermore in 7, the Kinetic and Thermodynamic Lithiated Derivatives of a Simple Diazomethane FULL PAPER carbonnitrogen bond (mean 1.202 A˚ ) is longer than a triple one and the nitrogennitrogen bond (1.208 A˚ ) is slightly longer than a double one. Previously reported calculations on H3SiCN2Li [6- 31G(d)/MP2] have suggested (in the light of structurally characterising 7) an energetic preference of 1.4 kcal·mol1 for the N- over the C-lithiate.[17] However, calculations pre- sented here clearly suggest that any such preference is eroded by the introduction of external solvation. This leads us to the view that in the presence of excess donor (either solvent or, by aggregation, other molecules of lithi- ated 1-H) the C-metallated product represents the thermo- dynamic product of lithiation whereas the N-metallate re- veals kinetic control. Consistent with this is the fact that, whereas 1-Li·3/2THF is afforded after having heated the re- action mixture to reflux (approx. 65 °C), 7 results from a process in which the temperature never exceeds 25 °C. In order to further probe the question of thermodynamic versus kinetic control in the metallation of 1-H and also in an attempt to obtain pure lithiated derivatives based on oligo- rather than complex polymeric structures, we have effected the crystallisation of lithiated (trimethylsilyl)diazo- methanes from polydentate Lewis bases. The best results have been obtained by the reaction of 1-H with nBuLi in TMEDA ( N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine) at low temperature ( 25 °C). This process achieves yellow crys- tals of a single isolable product and these analyse as Me3SiCN2Li·TMEDA (9). Not only does 1H NMR spec- troscopy support the 1:1 TMEDA/lithiate ratio but it also, by displaying just a single trimethylsilyl resonance, suggests the adoption of a single aggregation state, symmetrical species in solution. In line with the kinetic control exercised during the reaction, the solid-state structure of 9 reveals a tetramer (Table 2 and Figures 7 and 8) consisting of N-lithi- ated (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane molecules arranged as an ‘‘open’’ pseudo-cubane. Unusually, stabilisation of the me- tal centres by TMEDA takes two distinct forms with both mono- and bidentate coordination modes being observed. Notably, such a structure is incompatible with the sym- metry suggested by NMR spectroscopy, suggesting that the structure is either rapidly fluxional and/or significantly de- aggregated in solution (see below). While Li(1), Li(2), and Li(4) are each coordinated by three diazomethane terminal N-centres, Li(3) is coordinated by just two; there being no interaction with N(1) [Li(3)···N(1)  2.839(9) A˚ ]. Bis-coordination by the two TMEDA molecules that exhibit bidentate behaviour ren- ders Li(3) and Li(4) four and five coordinate, respectively. The remaining two Li ions are tetra-coordinate, each be- ing mono complexed by one N-centre of a monodentate TMEDA molecule. Thus the aggregate can be viewed as a dimer of dimeric pairs [each one based on a (NLi)2 ring, i.e. Li(3)N(5)Li(4)N(7) and Li(1)N(1)Li(2)N(3)] whereby each one is defined by the characteristic behaviour of its TMEDA components (Figure 8). Nevertheless, the combi- nation of pseudo-cubane opening and differences in the co- ordinative modes adopted by TMEDA incurs significant variations in core LiN interactions (Table 2). Perhaps Eur.

Solid-state structure of tetrameric 9; hydrogen atoms and minor disorder omitted for clarity most significantly, and presumably symptomatic of the pre- dilection of lithium for forming four bonds,[24] pentacoordi- nate Li(4) forms long[25] interactions both with bidentate TMEDA [mean Li(4)N  2.264 A˚ ] and with three depro- tonated diazomethane monomers [mean Li(4)N  2.204 A. E. H. Wheatley et al. FULL PAPER A˚ ]. The remaining TMEDA-chelated metal shows similar, though less pronounced, lengthening of LiN(TMEDA) bonds [Li(3)N(13) and Li(3)N(14)  2.208(9) and 2.146(8) A˚ , respectively] but rather stronger bonds to the cluster core [mean Li(3)N  2.035 A˚ ]. It may be the case that the discrepancy between these two LiN(TMEDA) in- teractions has its origins in the orientation of the Lewis base since the shorter of the two interactions is associated with N(14), which can presumably closely approach Li(3) by virtue of diminished steric interactions with the N(1)- containing diazomethane unita result of the extended Li(3)···N(1) distance. A further consequence of bond-cleav- age in the aggregate core is that N(1) becomes unique among the terminal diazomethane N-centres in that it stabilises just two metal ions [mean LiN(1)  2.001 A˚ ]. Finally, shorter than the LiN(TMEDA) bonds previously noted for the bis-coordinating Lewis base molecules are those in which the TMEDA acts only as a monodentate donor [mean LiN  2.079 A˚ ]. A comparison of the solid- state structural parameters observed for 9 with those noted in 7 reveals that both CN (mean 1.206 and 1.202 A˚ respectively for 9 and 7) and NN (mean 1.214 and 1.208 A˚ ) bond lengths correlate well but differ significantly from those in C-lithiated 1-Li·3/2THF.[19] Coincidentally, the only other known example of an ‘‘op- en’’ (LiN)4 pseudo-cubane in which a single core bond is absent is 7. However, bond cleavage in 7 derives from the mixed-anion nature of the cluster, with one vertex of the [otherwise lithio(trimethylsilyl)diazomethane-based] cube being defined by the deprotonated N-centre in the triazole ring, the neighbouring ring-nitrogen inserting into a cubane edge. The only other discrete, related ‘‘open’’ pseudo-cub- anes reported are the (LiO)4-based structures (PhOLi·THF)4·PhOH (wherein a single core interaction is absent),[26] [2-MeOC6H4C(H)(OLi)NMe(CH2)2NMe2]4[27] and [PhC(O)N(Ph)Li·THF]·[PhC(O)N(Ph)Zn(tBu)2- Li·THF][28] (in each of which two eclipsed core bonds are absent). This latter mode of separation is also noted in poly- meric (BrLi·THF).[29] The remaining rare feature of (9)4 in the solid state is highlighted by Cl6Li6·2TMEDA· 4/2TMEDA.[30] Here variations in the mode of external solvation by TMEDA allow four of the six Lewis base molecules associated with each hexamer to bridge between aggregates affording a three-dimensional network. Con- trastingly, in (9)4, Li(1) and Li(2) are each stabilised by just one TMEDA N-centre [N(9), N(11)]; these donors being strictly monodentate with neither N(10) nor N(12) bridging to adjacent aggregates. Complex 9 (like 7) results from the employment of kinetic control during the reaction and this, perhaps, overshadows the true aim of employing TMEDA here. Nevertheless, the solid-state structure of 9 affords us the first glance of a dis- crete molecular lithiodiazomethane [cf. (1-Li·3/2THF)] which incorporates no other by-products (cf. 7) and a theor- etical probe has been undertaken [B3LYP/6-311G**;[21,22] Figure 6 and Table 1 and Table E2 (Supp. Inf.)].[2022] The stabilities of Me3SiC(Li·TMEDA)N2 (XIII) and Me3SiCN2Li·TMEDA (XIV) are significantly enhanced by 2003 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In line with earlier calculations reported here (see above) ∆EC(XIII)  ∆EC(XIV), pointing again to the chances of C-metallation being enhanced by external solvation. Whilst C-lithiate XIII is still less stable than N-lithiated ana- logue XIV the introduction of TMEDA has almost com- pletely negated the energy difference (1.7 kcal·mol1). The structural parameters in diazomethane anions in 9 correlate well with those of computed XIV. Notably, in 9 (as in 7) the carbonnitrogen and the nitrogennitrogen bond lengths are very similar (in contrast to those in C-lithiated 1-Li·3/2THF, wherein the carbonnitrogen distance was sig- nificantly greater than the nitrogennitrogen one). Solution Studies on 1-Li·3/2THF and 9 The observation of 1-Li·3/2THF and 9 demonstrates the viability of both C- and N-lithiated derivatives of 1-H in the solid state. However, the details of their syntheses sug- gest that the regiospecificity of metallation is critically de- pendant on reaction conditions. This observation made it desirable to elucidate the structures of species obtained on dissolution of both 1-Li·3/2THF and 9 and to probe the possible interconversion between N- and C-lithiates. Cryo- scopic relative molecular mass (CRMM) measurements[31] on 1-Li·3/2THF in benzene show both that the complex de- aggregates significantly in non-donor solution and that the molecular mass (Mr) and aggregation state (n) remain es- sentially constant at 177  10 and n  0.77  0.04, respec- tively [assuming n  1 for Me3SiC(Li)N2·3/2THF, Mr  228] over a wide concentration range (4.55·103 to 3.20·102 mol·dm3, Table E3, Supp. Inf.). This may signify the polymer (Mr  912) breaking down (the chain-linking LiN bonds cleaving) such that [Me3SiC(Li·THF)N2]2 di- mers (Mr  384) and Me3SiC(Li·2THF)N2 monomers (Mr  264) result. Dimerisation of these monomers, con- comitant with the evolution of THF molecules yields fun- damental mono-THF solvated dimers in solution (Mr  228). Deaggregation of — and/or loss of THF from — these species can then explain the observed Mr. For 9, CRMM measurements suggest significant deaggregation of the tetramer. Over the concentration range 4.80·102 to 2.60·101 mol·dm3 (Table E4, Supp. Inf.) Mr increases from 425  5 (n  1.80  2 assuming n  1 for Me3SiCN2Li·TMEDA) to 494  3 (n  2.14  2). This points to substantial dislocation of the tetramer (Mr  945) to give (Me3SiCN2Li·TMEDA)2 (Mr  473), with limited dissociation of dimers and/or de-coordination of TMEDA occurring at lower concentrations. Data indicates some tetramer retention at higher concentrations. Variable-temperature 1H NMR spectra of 9 in [D8]PhMe (Figure 9) reveal broadening of the TMEDA peaks and downfield movement of the Me3Si signal as the temperature is reduced. By 25 °C new sets of Me3Si and (both) TMEDA resonances develop, suggesting the evolution of a second species and, as the temperature is further reduced, these new signals become dominant. Such behaviour is con- sistent with the aggregation of (Me3SiCN2Li·TMEDA)2 Kinetic and Thermodynamic Lithiated Derivatives of a Simple Diazomethane FULL PAPER (see above) to give tetramers at low temperature and, as such, these spectral changes are thermally reversible. If, in- stead, this sample is heated above room temperature the Me3Si singlet (δ  0.28 ppm at 35 °C) is replaced by a second one (δ  0.34 ppm at 52 °C; both signals are present in the range 4551 °C) suggesting a significant change in the lithiodiazomethane molecule whereby kinetically fav- oured N-lithiate 9 rearranges to the (thermodynamic) C- lithiate in situ. This view is supported by the observation that subsequent cooling of the sample to room temperature fails to incur any further significant changes in the appear- ance of the spectrum, suggesting that this thermal re- arrangement is irreversible. Figure 9. 1H NMR spectroscopic data for the Me3Si group in 9 in [D8]PhMe over the range 60 °C to 50 °C The room temperature 13C NMR spectrum of 9 in [D8]PhMe (Figure 10) shows a dominant Me3Si signal at δ  2.2 and a significantly smaller one at δ  0.8. (This latter signal may represent a small amount of the sample converting slowly to the thermodynamic isomer at room temperature.) Cooling the sample to 30 °C (below the temperature at which 1H NMR spectroscopy showed the effects of aggregation, see above) causes both the main Me3Si and the TMEDA CH2-peak to split into two. (The trace signal tentatively attributed to Me3Si in the C-lithiate at room temperature is not observed at this lower tempera- ture. However, at 30 °C all peaks are noticeably broader Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 33633375 www.eurjic.org 2003 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 3369 and it seems reasonable that this already weak resonance becomes difficult to detect.) If the same sample is heated to 95 °C it is found that the Me3Si resonance (dominant at room temperature) is completely replaced by one at high field (δ  0.7 ppm, cf. the weak δ  0.8 ppm signal at room temperature). In the same way as for 1H NMR spectroscopic data, this encourages the view that whereas the dominant species both at and below room temperature is the N-lithiate, it is converted into the C-metallated isomer at higher temperature. While the signal for the CN carbon centre does not move in a manner that might be expected for such a rearrangement, it should be noted that the 13C NMR spectra of both (C-lithiated) 1-Li·3/2THF and (N-li- thiated) 9 (in [D6]DMSO at room temperature) show ex- tremely similar chemical shifts for this carbon nucleus. Figure 10. 13C NMR spectroscopic data for 9 in [D8]PhMe over the range 95 °C to 30 °C Variable-temperature 7Li NMR spectra (Figure 11) re- inforce the information gained from 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The single resonance observed at δ  1.59 ppm at room temperature broadens as the tempera- ture is lowered until at 20 °C it splits into two separate signals, consistent with the dimer-tetramer system impli- cated by cryoscopy. If the temperature is reduced still further this new peak becomes the dominant one. As the sample is heated to above room temperature a significant alteration in the position of the sole lithium signal can be seen. Consistent with the 1H NMR spectra, this latter ther- mal change is irreversible. The observation of both 1-Li·3/2THF and 9 suggests a complicated chemistry for lithiated diazoalkanes and (in tandem with calculations) challenges previous assertions that 1-H is necessarily preferentially N- rather than C-lithi- ated. Rather, calculations now suggest metallation of the carbon centre in the presence of excess donor. Indeed, further synthetic work, culminating in the isolation and structural characterisation of N-lithiated 9 suggests that the A. E. H. Wheatley et al. FULL PAPER Figure 11. 7Li NMR spectroscopic data for 9 in [D8]PhMe over the range 60 °C to 50 °C regiospecificity of metallation is temperature dependant. Clearly, such variability in the behaviour of 1-H towards organolithium species has consequences for our under- standing of the reactions undergone by the subsequently formed lithiate, and this has led us to probe the details of representative processes. Reactions of Lithio(trimethylsilyl)diazomethane with Aryl Isothiocyanates i) Treatment of 1-H with nBuLi and RNCS in THF: Syntheses of 10 (R  Ph) and 11 (R  PhCH2  Bz) Reaction of lithio(trimethylsilyl)diazomethane with phe- nyl isothiocyanate (PhNCS)[18] in THF affords a product that analyses as PhNNNC(Me3Si)C(SLi·3/2THF) 10 (Scheme 3). This shows a 1:1 Ph/Me3Si ratio by 1H NMR spectroscopy  consistent with expectation for the intended cyclised product. That ring-formation has occurred is also suggested by 13C NMR spectroscopy, which reveals peaks for the sp2 ring-carbons. However, the failure of 10 to afford 2003 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 33633375 3370 crystals suitable for an unambiguous structure determi- nation led to the replacement of phenyl isothiocyanate with its benzylic analogue (BzNCS). Employment of BzNCS in the above reaction sequence yields a crystalline material that analyses as S-lithio-1- benzyl 4-trimethylsilyl-5-thio-1,2,3-triazole [BzNNNC- (Me3Si)C(SLi·2THF)], 11. X-ray crystallography affords the first full characterisation of a lithiated thio-1,2,3-tria- zole (Figure 12 and Table 3; the asymmetric unit incorpor- ates two crystallographically independent but structurally similar molecules of 11 of which a representative one is dis- cussed). The species is rendered polymeric in the solid state through the coordination of lithium by, for example, N(3) [LiN  2.050(9) A˚ ] in the almost planar (internal angles sum to 540.1°), aromatic triazole ring. The anion is for- mally metallated at sulfur and, at 2.460(8) A˚ , Li(1)S(1) is consistent with metal-sulfur distances reported for lithium- containing thiolates,[32] thioimidates,[32j,33] and thioureas.[34] The only other solid-state structures to incorporate an alk- ali metallated 1,2,3-triazole ring are those of lithiated[35] and potassiated[36] benzotriazole (the triazole ring being pre-formed in both cases). In 7 a triazole ring is incorpor- ated as a neutral adduct.[17a] The observation of a triazole ring in 11 has ramifications for our interpretation of the cyclisation process by which lithiodiazomethanes and RNCS combine to give 1-substituted 5-alkylthio-1,2,3-tria- zoles suggesting, as it does, the action of C-lithio(trimethyl- silyl)diazomethane in THF solution (Scheme 4). ii) Treatment of 1-H with nBuLi and RNCS in OEt2: Syntheses of 12 (R  Bz) and 13 (R  Ph) According to previous reports, the sequential combi- nation of 1-H with nBuLi and BzNCS in OEt2 affords, via a postulated lithio-2-benzylamino-5-trimethylsilyl-1,3,4-thia- diazole intermediate, 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazoles with re- direction of the reaction being attributed to an ambiguous Figure 12.

In the solid state 12 is dimeric (Fig- ure 13) and consists of two (mono-TMEDA) complexed metallo-1-benzyl-5-thio-4-trimethylsilyl-1,2,3-triazole mol- ecules. Akin to 11, 12 is an S-lithiate [LiS  2.422(6) A˚ ], with metal centre stabilisation [Li(1)N(3)  2.053(6) A˚ ] incurring dimerisation. The two planar triazole systems show aromatic character (Table 4) and, as such, are essen- tially similar to those in 11 notwithstanding that the NN distances in the triazole component of 12 are consistent with greater localisation of electron density [viz. C(4)N(1), N(1)N(2), N(2)N(3) in 11 and C(1)N(1), N(1)N(3), N(2)N(3) in 12]. Dimerisation of 12 results in these triazole systems being linked by (and participating in) a hitherto unknown type of 10-membered (NNCSLi)2 heterocycle. Of mechanistic importance is the observation that 12 is not the expected lithio-2-benzylamino-5-trimethylsilyl- 1,3,4-thiadiazole,[1] but rather a lithio-1-benzyl 4-trimethyl- silyl-5-thio-1,2,3-triazole. This is, of course, inconsistent with the reaction of N-lithio(trimethylsilyl)diazomethane (cf. 9) with BzNCS but rather suggests that the reactive species in solution is the C-lithiate (cf. 1-Li) instead (Scheme 4). This observation suggests several things. That Scheme 4. Proposed mechanism for the formation of 11 from a C-lithiated diazomethane precursor[18] Eur. J. Inorg.

Furthermore, the reaction of BzNCS with 1-Li is apparently not facile. Hence, treatment of the lithiated diazomethane in (relatively poorly donating) OEt2 with BzNCS at low temperature pre- sumably gives only a slow reaction via the N-lithiate. How- ever, heating of the reaction mixture immediately after in- troducing BzNCS (but before the application of TMEDA) affords the lithio-1-benzyl-5-thio-4-trimethylsilyl-1,2,3-tria- zole, strongly suggesting that the N-isomer has been con- verted into its C-congener prior to significant reaction hav- A. E. H. Wheatley et al. FULL PAPER ing occurred. Notably the synthesis of 12 can be reproduced in THF/TMEDA (with reflux prior to introduction of the bidentate donor) whereas if the literature preparation (no reflux) is closely adhered to then 1-H, nBuLi and PhNCS can be sequentially combined in OEt2 at 0 °C and worked up to give PhNHCSCHNN 13 in high yield (its formation requiring a lithio-2-phenylamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole precur- sor). While it has been noted that four types of cyclic system could reasonably result from the reaction of lithiodiazome- thanes with aryl isothiocyanates,[37] only two such classes have been reported.[1] Reaction of the C-lithiate has been considered (Scheme 4) to require the initial formation of a CC bond between the diazomethane carbanionic centre and the isothiocyanate carbon atom. However, 2-amino-5- trimethylsilyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole production necessitates that the N-lithio(trimethylsilyl)diazomethane molecule forms a NC bond prior to ring closure by CS bond formation (Scheme 5). Scheme 5. Proposed mechanism for the production of lithio-2-am- ino-5-trimethylsilyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole from an N-lithiated diazo- methane precursor Conclusions This work clearly demonstrates for the first time the vi- ability of both the C- and N-lithiated isomers of a simple diazomethane both in the solid state (as, 1-Li·3/2THF and 9, respectively) and in solution. X-ray crystallographic characterisations of these two species point to bonding in the two types of molecule being quite different (Figure 14). New calculations corroborate these bonding patterns and also suggest that while the C-lithiated isomer of 1-Li is less stable than its N-metallated analogue, the energetic differ- ence between the two decreases with the extent of solvation by progressively stronger donors. Reaction conditions em- ployed in the syntheses of these compounds point to the regiospecificity of metallation being significantly tempera- Figure 14. A review of bonding in C- and N-lithiated isomers of (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane 2003 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 33633375 3372 ture dependent. Thus, C- and N-metallation result from the exercise of thermodynamic and kinetic control, respectively. Consistent with this is the observation, by variable tempera- ture NMR spectroscopy, of the irreversible conversion of N- to C-lithiate at high temperature, a result that has signifi- cant consequences for our view of the reactivity of this lithi- odiazomethane with aryl isothiocyanates. The solid-state structures of both 1-Li·3/2THF and 9 indi- cate why it is that organic syntheses which involve the elim- ination of N2 from diazomethanes require formation of the C-lithiate with its weak CN and strong NN bond. Fi- nally, such reactivity has been probed and has resulted in the crystallographic characterisation of lithiothiotriazoles 11 and 12. Details of their syntheses and structures bear out the view that product selectivity in these reactions, rather than being directly solvent dependent, is in fact influ- enced by temperature.

X-ray Crystallography: Data to check the unit cell of (7)2·OEt2 (C68H160Li8N18O7Si10, monoclinic, space group C2/m, a  23.05, b  15.77, c  15.05 A˚ , β  101.9°) were collected on a Rigaku R-Axis II imaging plate diffractometer[39] at 200(2)K using graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ  0.71069 A˚ ). This compared with the previously published[17a] unit cell and so the full data were not collected. Data for 9 were collected on a Rigaku R-Axis II imaging plate diffractometer using 45 frames, each frame covering a 4° oscillation with an exposure time of 30 minutes per frame, in each of four orientations. Data for 11 were collected by the ω/2θ method on a Rigaku AFC-7R four circle diffractometer[39] and data for 12 were collected on a StoeSiemens four circle dif- fractometer. All structures were solved by direct methods[40] and subsequent Fourier difference syntheses and refined by full-matrix least-squares[41] on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for Li, N, Si, and most C atoms. A riding model with idealised geometry was employed for H-atom refinement. For 9, one terminal methyl group of a TMEDA molecule and three of the SiMe3 groups showed positional disorder with respect to the position of the C atoms and were refined isotropically over two different sites with partial occupancies. Crystallographic data for 9, 11 and 12 are given in Table 5. CCDC-207850 (9), -207849 (11), and -207848 (12) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

Computational Methods: Preliminary geometry optimisation calcu- lations[20] based on XCN2Li·nL (X  H3Si, Me3Si; n  0, 1, 2; L  OEt2, THF) were done using the 6-31G* basis set[22] at the HF level. A frequency analysis was performed on the most stable con- formation of each structure and the geometry was refined using A. E. H. Wheatley et al. FULL PAPER Table 5.
