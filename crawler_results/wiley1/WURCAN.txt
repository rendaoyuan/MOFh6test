Manuscript A Remarkable 14-Nuclear ReV 8AgI 6 Coordination Oligomer Derived from a 2D (ReV 2AgI 2)n Coordination Polymer with d-Penicillaminate Takumi Konno,* Yuichi Shimazaki, Tadashi Yamaguchi, Tasuku Ito, and Masakazu Hirotsu There has been considerable interest in the design and creation of metallo-supramolecular systems that exhibit unique structural and chemical properties.[1] In many cases, metallo-supramolecular structures have been constructed from organic multidentate ligands and metal ions through self-assembly processes. Our synthetic strategy involves the use of octahedral metal complexes containing relatively simple thiolate ligands, such as 2-aminoethanethiolate (aet), l-cysteinate (l-cys), and d-penicillaminate (d-pen; d-H2pen ¼ d-penicillamine), as building blocks that are aggregated by forming S-bridged structures with metal ions.[2±5] This method allows the construction of well-organized heterometallic aggregates which have several chiral centers by a systematic variation and combination of metal ions with different coordination geometries. For example, a number of chiral S- bridged aggregates, which include CoIII 4PdII 2MI 2 octanuclear metallacycles [MI 2{PdII[CoIII(aet)3]2}2]6þ (M ¼ Ag, Au),[2e] have been prepared just from [CoIII(aet)3] and appropriate metal ions.[2] While it has been established that thiolato groups coordi- nated to an MII or MIII metal center have the ability to bind to a second metal ion to form S-bridged structures,[2±6] the coordinating ability of thiolato groups bound to a metal center with a higher oxidation state has not been widely investigat- ed.[7] In fact, S-bridged heterometallic aggregates based on COMMUNICATIONS Angew.

Hirotsu Department of Chemistry Faculty of Engineering Gunma University Kiryu, Gunma 376-8515 (Japan) thiolato metal complexes with an oxidation state higher than þ 5 have never been reported. The higher oxidation state of the metal center may cause the reduction of electron density on the thiolato donor atoms, which prevents the formation of stable S-bridged heterometallic structures with other metal ions. Thus, as part of our recent study on oxorhenium(v) complexes with aminothiolate ligands,[8c] we investigated the ability of thiolato groups coordinated to a [ReVO]3þ core to ligate to other metal ions, with the aim of expanding the range of chiral supramolecular architectures based on octahedral metal complexes with thiolate ligands. We found that [ReVO(d-pen-N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)] ions which have two coordinated thiolato groups and one free carbox- ylate group can aggregate with the use of AgI centers as the bridging metal ions, which leads to the creation of a novel 2D (ReV 2AgI 2)n polymeric structure 1. Furthermore, the (ReV 2- AgI 2)n structure can be converted into an unprecedented 14- nuclear ReV 8AgI 6 oligomeric structure 2 that exhibits a fascinating metallo-supramolecular stereochemistry (Scheme 1). Treatment of a purple aqueous solution of [ReVO(d-Hpen- N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)][8a] with AgNO3 in a ratio approximately 1:1 gave a dark purple solution, from which dark purple plate crystals of 1 were isolated. The FT-IR spectrum of 1 shows relatively sharp n˜(C ¼ O) bands at 1675 and 1626 cm1, which are distinct from a broad n˜(C ¼ O) band at 1669 cm1 with a shoulder at approximately 1695 cm1 for [ReVO(d-Hpen- N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)]. This spectral behavior suggests the absence of COOH groups in 1.[9] Moreover, the plasma emission spectral and elemental analyses of 1 are in agree- ment with the formula for the 1:1 adduct of [ReVO(d-pen)2] and Agþ ions. Single-crystal X-ray analysis of 1 revealed the presence of an asymmetric unit consisting of one [ReVO(d-pen-N,S)- (d-pen-N,O,S)] ion and one AgI atom, and lattice water molecules.[10] The overall structure of the [ReVO(d-pen- N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)] unit in 1 is very similar to that of the starting mononuclear [ReVO(d-Hpen-N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)],[8b] and have a distorted octahedral geometry with a cis(N)¥cis- (S)¥trans(O) configuration. As shown in Figure 1, the two ReV octahedra are linked by two AgI atoms through sulfur bridges to form a ReV 2AgI 2 tetranuclear structure [Ag2{ReVO(d-pen- N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)}2] (average ReS 2.324(3) ä, AgS 2.477(3) ä). This S-bridged tetranuclear structure is to be expected, however, the S-Ag-S angle (109.29(9)8) deviates significantly from linearity. An inspection of the extended structure of 1 (Figure 2) reveals that each AgI atom in the ReV 2AgI 2 tetranuclear unit is bound by a d-pen-N,S COO group from a neighboring tetranuclear unit (Ag-O4’ 2.351(10) ä), so as to adopt a trigonal- planar geometry. Thus, in 1 the S- bridged ReV 2AgI 2 tetranuclear units are connected with one another through AgO bonds, which com- pletes a 2D sheetlike structure made up by the cyclic ReV 4AgI 4 network unit. Compound 1 is sparingly soluble in water, consistent with its polymeric structure. However, treatment of an aqueous suspension of 1 with H2SiF6 gave a clear purple solution (pH < 1), from which a brown-purple com- pound 2 was isolated. It was antici- pated that a discrete ReV 2AgI 2 tetra- nuclear complex, [Ag2{ReVO- (d-Hpen-N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)}2]2þ, was produced by the protonation at d-pen-N,S COO groups, which re- sults in the cleavage of AgO bonds in 1. Indeed, the IR spectrum of 2 exhibits a n˜(C¼O) band at 1722 cm1 indicative of the presence of a COOH COMMUNICATIONS 4712 ¹ 2002 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the plasma emission spectral anal- ysis indicates a 3:4 ratio of Ag:Re atoms in 2, and the elemental analysis agrees with the 3:4 stoichiometry [Ag3{ReO(d-Hpen)(d-pen)}3- {ReO (d-pen)2}](SiF6)¥nH2O, rather than the expected 2:2 stoichiometry. The molecular structure of 2 was establish- ed by a single-crystal X-ray analysis.[10] The complex cation of 2 is an unprecedented 14- nuclear coordination oligomer consisting of eight cis(N)¥cis(S)¥trans(O) configuration ReV octahedral units and six AgI atoms. The presence of two SiF6 2 ions implies that the entire complex cation of 2 has an overall charge of 4 þ . Six of the eight ReV units adopt a protonated form [ReO(d-Hpen-N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)], while the remaining two units have a deprotonated form [ReO(d-pen-N,S)(d-pen- N,O,S)]. In the complex cation of 2, the eight ReV units are zigzag linked by three types of AgI atoms with different coordination geometries (Figure 3): a) AgI atoms coordinated by two S atoms from two ReV units (Ag1 and Ag6; average AgS 2.473(4) ä), b) a trigonal-planar environment for AgI atoms coordinated by three S atoms from three ReV units (Ag2 and Ag5; average AgS 2.513(4) ä), and c) AgI atoms in a tetrahedral geometry coordinated by one S and two O atoms from three ReV units, as well as a water O atom (O41) located at the center of the 14-nuclear structure (Ag3 and Ag4; average AgS 2.500(4) ä, AgO 2.438(12) ä). Although the entire complex cation has no crystallographi- cally imposed symmetry, a quasi C2 axis passes through the central water oxygen atom. Interestingly, three types of thiolato S atoms are found in the complex cation of 2: a) non-bridging S atoms (S2, S4, S6, S12, S14, and S16; average ReS 2.282(4) ä), b) m2-S atoms bridging AgI and ReV centers (S1, S5, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, and S15; average ReS 2.331(4) ä, AgS 2.489(4) ä), and c) m3-S atoms bridg- ing two AgI and a ReV centers (S3 and S13; average ReS 2.373(4) ä, AgS 2.514(4) ä). In addition, there exist four types of ReV units with different coordination modes: a) a monodentate S coordination with a m2-S bridge (Re1 and Re8), b) a monodentate S coordination with a m3-S bridge (Re2 and Re7), c) a bidenate O,S coordination with m2-O and m2-S bridges (Re3 and Re6), and d) a tridenate O,S,S coordination with a terminal O atom and two m2-S bridges (Re4 and Re5). Thus, the 14-nuclear ReV 8AgI 6 oligomeric structure in 2 is constructed by the ingenious organization of three types of coordination geometries around the AgI atoms and four types of coordination modes of ReV octahedral units, as well as three types of bridging modes of thiolato S atoms (Scheme 2). This situation is in contrast with the 2D extended structure of 1 (compare Figure 2 with Figure 4), in which the AgI atoms have only one kind of coordination environment and the ReV units have only one type of coordination mode. It is noteworthy that each ReV 8AgI 6 molecule of 2 is bound to four neighboring ReV 8AgI 6 molecules through COOH¥¥¥OOC COMMUNICATIONS Angew. Chem. Int.

The existence of two deprotonated [ReO(d-pen-N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)] units,[11] together with the protonated [ReO(d-Hpen-N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)] units, is essen- tial for this hydrogen bonding, which would in turn contribute significantly to the stabilization of the 14-nuclear oligomeric structure of 2. Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis showed that the structure of 2 collapses above approximately 2108C, while the collapsing temperature for 1 was approximately 2408C. These results show that 2 is thermally less stable than 1, partly because the COOH¥¥¥OOC hydrogen bonds in 2 are expected to be weaker than the AgO coordination bonds in 1.[12] When an aqueous solution of 2 was treated with aqueous ammonia to adjust the pH to approximately 5, purple micro- crystals of 1 were formed. This result implies that 2 reverts back to the polymeric structure of 1 on changing the pH of the solution, despite the different stoichiometries found in 1 (Ag:Re ¼ 1:1) and 2 (Ag:Re ¼ 3:4; Scheme 1). The electronic absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectra of 1 and 2 in water, which were only qualitatively measured because of the poor solubility of the compounds, are essentially the same as the spectra of the starting material [ReVO(d-Hpen-N,S)- (d-pen-N,O,S)],[8] which shows a characteristic near-UV absorption band at approximately 340 nm with a shoulder at the shorter wavelength side and a major positive CD band also in this region. Furthermore, in the 1H NMR spectrum in D2O, 1 and 2 give only a single set of resonance signals arising from four methyl and two methine groups at nearly the same positions as the resonance signals observed for [ReVO- (d-Hpen-N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)]. Thus, the rapid exchange of the ReV octahedral units occurs in solution with retention of the cis(N)¥cis(S)¥trans(O) geometry, which is responsible for the pH dependent interconversion between 1 and 2.[13] In summary, the chiral mononuclear compound [ReVO- (d-Hpen-N,S)(d-pen-N,O,S)] readily reacts with Agþ ions to afford the 2D sheetlike coordination polymer 1. This result shows that thiolato groups coordinated to a [ReVO]3þ core have an ability to bind with metal ions to form an S-bridged heterometallic polynuclear structure. In addition, the poly- meric structure in 1 was successfully converted into 2 by treatment with aqueous H2SiF6 while retaining the coordina- tion environment around the ReV center. To our surprise, 2 was found to be a remarkable coordination oligomer com- posed of eight ReV octahedra and six AgI ions. Although a large number of coordination polymers have been prepared from organic ligands and AgI ions, coordination oligomers containing AgI ions are quite rare.[14] Furthermore, 2 is the first example of a highly organized chiral molecular architec- ture involving three different coordination geometries of AgI, four different coordination modes of ReV units, and three different bridging modes of thiolato donors, all existing in one quasi C2 symmetrical molecule. Note that 2 constructs a 2D sheetlike structure, which results from the self-assembly of the 14-nuclear ReV 8AgI 6 molecules through COOH¥¥¥OOC hydro- gen bonds, while the structure of 1 is the result of the self- assembly of tetranuclear ReV 2AgI 2 molecules through AgO coordination bonds. Accordingly, the present results should provide an insight into the design and construction of second- generation metallo-supramolecular systems,[14b] which are generated by self-assembly processes of discrete metallo- supramolecules consisting of metal polyhedra, and should also contribute to the development of thiolatooxorhenium(v) chemistry which is currently drawing much attention for potential therapeutic applications in nuclear medicine.

[13] As indicated by the referees, the solid-state structures of 1 and 2 would not be retained in solution. The electrospray-ionization (ESI) mass spectrum of 2 in water mainly showed four clusters of peaks centered at m/z 605.1 (relative intensity: 100%), 623.2 (19%), 1103.1 (83%), and 1209.0 (21%). The calculated molecular mass and the isotopic distribution of these clusters of peaks match very well with those for [Ag{ReO(d-Hpen)(d-pen)}]þ, [Ag{ReO(d-Hpen)(d-pen)}(H2O)]þ, [Ag{ReO(d-Hpen)(d-pen)}2]þ, and [Ag2{ReO(d-Hpen)(d-pen)}- {ReO(d-pen)2}]þ ions, respectively. This result suggests that in water the ReV 8AgI 6 14-nuclear structure in 2 breaks down to ReV 2AgI trinuclear and ReV 2AgI 2 tetranuclear species, followed by the disso- ciation of ReV 2AgI 2 tetranuclear species into ReVAgI dinuclear species. Attempts to measure the ESI mass spectrum of 1 were unsuccessful, because of its extremely poor solubility in water. [14] a) S.-P. Yang, X.-M. Chen, L.-N. Ji, J. Chem. Soc.
