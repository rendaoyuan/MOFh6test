Although several approaches have been made to increase the pore size by enlarging the organic moi- eties, they often lead to instability or interpenetration of the frameworks.[2] Therefore, rational design and synthesis of open metal-organic frameworks are based on a significant motivation to avoid the above-mentioned defects. Recently, a breakthrough has been made in the creation of exception- ally stable and highly porous metal-organic frameworks by the use of secondary building units (SBU).

China) Abstract: Five polymorphous frame- works of cobalt(ii) imidazolates (1±5) have been prepared by solvatothermal syntheses. Of these, compound 3 has al- ready been synthesized in a gas-phase reaction by Seel et al. in 1969 and structurally characterized by Sturm et al. in 1975. The new synthetic strat- egy affords four polymorphous frame- works of cobalt(ii) imidazolates (1, 2, 4, 5) of crystalline substances, of which the compound 4 (a = b = 23.450(3), c = 12.460(3) ä, tetragonal, I41cd, Z = 16) is an isomorphous compound of [Zn(im)2]¥, which was also synthesized in a gas-phase reaction in 1980. The frameworks of compounds 1 and 2 are porous and isostructural; they have the same framework topology that repre- sents a novel uninodal (6,4)-net: 1: a = 18.513(4), b = 24.368(5), c = 9.2940(19) ä, orthorhombic, Fdd2, Z = 16; 2: a = 17.635(4), b = 27.706(6), c = 9.0810(18) ä, orthorhombic, Fdd2, Z = 16. The framework of compound 5 exhibits a topology of zeolitic struc- ture with the unit-cell parameters: a = 24.3406(8), b = 9.4526(3), c = 24.8470(8) ä, b = 91.977(1)8, mono- clinic, P21/n, Z = 4. All polymorphous frameworks of cobalt(ii) imidazolates reflect the structural features of silica (SiO2) and also exhibit different mag- netic behaviors, although the imidazo- lates transmit the antiferromagnetic coupling between the cobalt(ii) ions in all cases. However, the uncompensated antiferromagnetic couplings arise from spin-canting are sensitive to the struc- tures: compound 1 is an antiferromag- net with TN = 13.11 K; compounds 2±4 are weak ferromagnets (canted antifer- romagnets): 2 shows a very weak ferro- magnetism below 15 K, 3 exhibits a rel- atively strong ferromagnetism below 11.5 K and a coercive field (HC) of 1800 Oe at 1.8 K, and 4 displays the strongest ferromagnetism of the three cobalt imidazolates and demonstrates a TC of 15.5 K with a coercive field, HC, of 7300 Oe at 1.8 K. However, com- pound 5 seems to be a hidden canted antiferromagnet with a magnetic order- ing temperature of 10.6 K.

KGaA, Weinheim 5673 FULL PAPER been regarded as a key to imparting stability and rigidity into the resulting network and providing a means of pre- venting the formation of interpenetrated nets.[3] The strategy we used to a create stable and rigid metal-organic frame- work with large pores is based on expanding the zeolitic topologies by construction of metal-organic tetrahedral building blocks.[7] For the tetrahedral atoms (T) of zeolite we chose four-coordinate transition metals and for the link- ers or vertices (X) of the T atoms we chose imidazolates. We expected that the resulting metal-organic polymer could have an open framework with zeolite or zeolite-like topolo- gy. The use of imidazolate as linker is not a random choice, but a deliberate selection since the two coordinating nitro- gen atoms of imidazolate orientate with respect to each other at an angle of 1448 which closely resembles the 1458 angle of oxygen coordination in zeolites. Furthermore, the deprotonated imidazole is negatively charged so that the formed TX2 compound would bear a strong resemblance to the structures of silica or zeolites: 1) If we chose transition metals MII as T atoms, the electronic neutral frameworks of silica-like structures would be produced. 2) If some of the T atoms of MII were replaced by the T atoms of MIII, the re- sulting framework would be similar to the aluminosilicate; however, here the frameworks were not charged negatively, but positively. 3) If some of the T atoms were replaced by O atoms (octahedrally coordinated metals) of MII or MIII, the resulting frameworks would be analogous to those of the zeolite-like metallophosphates. And, if extended polymor- phism occurred, we would make the metal imidazolates sim- ilar to silica, aluminosilicates, or metallophosphates. In addi- tion, as infinite metal-organic frameworks constructed from transition metals and p-conjugated ligands, they could be potential candidates for electronic, optical, or magnetic ma- terials. Therefore, the polymorphism of metal imidazolate frameworks would be not only an important motif for a new generation of porous materials, but also a significant topic for investigating the relationship between the framework structures and the physical properties of substances. Very re- cently, a structural and spectroscopic study on the polymor- phism of copper(ii) imidazolate polymers was reported.[4] Although the copper(ii) imidazolates have already been in- vestigated, the structural studies were limited to X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) because of the lack of suitable single crystals. In addition, the XRPD method is only availa- ble if the complexity of the species is not too great and for monophasic crystalline powders.[5] Moreover, according to the XRPD results, the copper(ii) imidazolate polymers did not display the open frameworks we expected; thus, we be- lieve that a rational structural design of such porous com- pounds requires a logical synthetic strategy. Imidazolates incorporating other polydentate ligands can form polynuclear complexes that are commonly used as bio- inorganic model compounds. Therefore, these imidazolic complexes were prepared for the purpose of bioinorganic motifs.[6] Prior to our report on a porous framework of co- balt(ii) imidazolate,[7] there had been only three different frameworks of metal imidazolates ([Cu(im)2]¥,[8] [Co(im)2]¥,[9] and [Zn(im)2]¥ [10]) that had been characterized by X-ray single-crystal studies. However, these crystalline compounds also did not display open frameworks. To create the metal imidazolate in a suitable crystalline size and with an open framework, we adopted the synthetic strategy ap- plied for zeolites. After a series of experiments, we found that cobalt(ii) is an ideal metal for the T atoms, and some of the alkyl alcohols are ideal solvents for the solvatothermal syntheses. Also, we applied various organic bases as struc- ture-directing agents. To date, we have used our synthetic strategy to prepare at least five polymorphous frameworks of cobalt(ii) imidazolates: three of them are open frame- works, of which one exhibits a zeolite-like topology.[7] Inter- estingly, the five polymorphous structures also display differ- ent magnetic behavior. In the past 20 years, there have been a number of re- ports on magnetic studies of the imidazolate-bridged homo- bimetallic (or heterobimetallic) and oligometallic complexe- s,[6a±g] which reveal that the imidazolate linkage provides an efficient pathway for antiferromagnetic exchanges. Complex [Cu(im)(imH)2Cl]x, a 1D metal-organic polymer bridged by a single imidazolate, was reported to exhibit strong antifer- romagnetic exchange.[11] In 1997, the structure and magnetic study of the 3D polymer [Fe3(im)6(imH)2]x [12] revealed that the imidazolates transmit antiferromagnetic coupling be- tween the iron(ii) ions, but with canted spin, leading to weak ferromagnetism at low temperatures. In the homopolymeric system of metal imidazolates [M(im)2]¥, although the differ- ent polymorphs of [Cu(im)2]¥ [13] were magnetically studied and indicated the existence of antiferromagnetic interaction between the copper(ii) ions through imidazolate linkages, the results were based nevertheless on the magnetic deter- mination above 80 K. There has been no relevant magnetic study reported of the homopolymer [Co(im)2]¥ [9] reported by Sturm et al. Herein, we report the synthesis, X-ray single- crystal study, and magnetic properties of the five compounds with different polymorphous frameworks [Co(im)2]¥, which display silica-like metal-organic structures. To facilitate the discussions in this paper, the five compounds are denoted 1 ([Co(im)2¥0.5Py]¥, Py = pyridine), 2 ([Co(im)2¥0.5Ch]¥, Ch = cyclohexanol), 3 ([Co(im)2]¥, space group I41), 4 ([Co(im)2]¥, space group I41cd), and 5 ([Co5(im)10¥2MB]¥, MB = 3-methyl-1-butanol). Results Synthesis of the cobalt(ii) imidazolates with polymorphous frameworks: The compounds of cobalt imidazolates 1±5 were generally prepared by a solvatothermal method below 130±1408C; however, the synthesis of each compound de- pends on the structure-directing agents and solvents (tem- plates) used (Table 1). Crystal structures of the five compounds: All cobalt(ii) imi- dazolates reported here are crystalline materials (Table 2). Similar to inorganic silica, the compounds are generally for- mulated as [Co(im)2¥xG] (x = 0, 0.4 or 0.5; G = guest mol- ecule) and are infinite 3D polymers with neutral frame- works in which the cobalt(ii) ions are tetrahedrally coordi- nated and bridged by imidazolate ligands (Figure 1). ¹ 2003 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org Chem. Eur. J. 2003, 9, 5673 ± 5685 5674 FULL PAPER Compounds 1 and 2: These two compounds are isostructural or can be regarded as supramolecular isomers (Figure 2).[14] They are constructed from the same metal ions and the same ligands, and crystallize in the same framework topolo- gy (Figure 1) with the same space group. However, they rep- resent two different crystalline phases that can be distin- guished from each other by their different unit cell parame- ters, framework openings, channel inclusions, and frame- work stabilities as well as their magnetic properties. The framework of 1 or 2 contains only a crystallographically unique cobalt(ii) ion and two independent imidazolate link- ages (1: Co¥¥¥Co 5.855±5.945 ä, N-Co-N angle 102.7±112.88; 2: Co¥¥¥Co 5.860±6.007 ä, N-Co-N angle 105.5±113.28). Within the framework, the cobalt ions are linked into boat- and chairlike 6-rings, which form an enclosed 66 cage unit (four chairlike rings around and two boatlike rings front and back along the c axis; Scheme 1). These 66 cage units (each accommodates a pyridine molecule in 1 and a cyclohexanol molecule in 2) are linked to form an infinite 3D net with 1D channels of openings 5.3î10.4 ä in 1 and 6.6î8.4 ä in 2 along the b axis. This is an interesting net because of its close relationship to the cristobalite (diamond net with 64 cage unit) and tridymite structures (lonsdaleite net with 65 cage unit)[15a] (Scheme 1) that was first announced by O×Keeffe et al. in 1992[15b] and is demonstrated here in real crystal structures for the first time.

In this frame- work, the SBUs are the 4-ring cobalt(ii) rings which are doubly connected to wavelike or double crankshaft-like chains[16] (Figure 3a). These chains run along the a axis and intersect with those running along the b axis by means of the common 4-rings at the wave peaks to form an open 3D framework with a 12-ring opening (Figure 4a). Three such frameworks are interwoven and linked by the imidazolates at the cobalt(ii) ions. As result, the 3D framework is again not the desired open framework. Nevertheless, the helical channels of 3.5î3.5 ä running along the c axis remain (the 8-rings in Figure 4b are such helical channels seen in projection), which, in principle, can host water molecules. Although there are no water molecules found in 3, water molecules are found in [Zn(im)2]¥ (3’),[17b] the isomorphous compound of 3. Crystal structure of compound 4: Compound 4 is isomor- phous with [Zn(im)2]¥,[10] which was reported by Lehnert and co-workers 20 years ago. Similar to compound 3, com- pound 4 also has a noncentrosymmetric 3D framework, but in this case the space group is I41cd and it contains two crys- tallographically unique cobalt(ii) ions (Co¥¥¥Co 5.905± 6.003 ä, N-Co-N angles 103.9±117.88). This framework also Figure 2. Ball-and-stick diagrams of the topological structure of 1 and 2.

Eur. J. 2003, 9, 5673 ± 5685 5676 FULL PAPER S. Gao, X.-Z. You et al. contains 4-rings which are connected to the Narsarsukite chain units[16] (Figure 3b). These chains run along the c axis parallel to each other within the C4 symmetry and are linked to each other by the imidazolate ligands in a and b directions to give a 3D framework (Figure 5) by completing the 4-connections of the cobalt ions. This framework, ac- cording to reference [4], exhibits the network topology of banalsite with a pore opening of 4.0î4.0 ä. Crystal structure of compound 5: This compound exhibits a centrosymmetric open framework with zeolitic topology. In this framework, there are five crystallographically unique cobalt(ii) ions, from which 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8-rings are gen- erated. The Co¥¥¥Co distance in framework 5 varies from 5.797 to 6.030 ä, and the N-Co-N angle varies from 104.0 to 118.88. The structural subunits in the framework of 5 (Figure 6) are zeolite-like chain units A and B (Figure 3c, Figure 3d). Detailed descriptions of this structure can be found in reference [7]. FTIR spectra: The IR spectra of all five compounds of cobalt imidazolate are distinguishable from each other, al- though the bands from their frameworks are almost com- pletely coincident owing to the same IR signatures of the m- imidazolate ligands (Table 3). Nevertheless, the IR spectra of the cobalt imidazolate frameworks can be classified into A and B types: type A has a single g(C±H) band appearing in the range 751±758cm1, while type B shows double g(C± H) bands near 772 and 753 cm1. The IR spectra of 1, 2, 3, and 5 fall under type A, which can be further distinguished from each other through the distinctive signatures of the guest molecules. In contrast, compound 4 appears to be the only polymorphous framework with type B IR signals, like all polymorphs of the reported copper(ii) imidazolates.[4]. Thermal stability of the cobalt(ii) imidazolate compounds: The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of compound 1 shows complete desorption of the compound at about 2308C. There is no further weight loss until 3308C, and de- composition of the compound occurs at about 3508C. Com- pound 2 loses its guest molecules completely at about 2208C. There is no further weight loss until 4308C, and de- composition of the compound is observed above 4508C. The XRPD pattern of the pyridine-free matrix 1, obtained by desolvation at 1608C and 5î105 Torr vacuum for 3 h, shows that the lattice of the crystal has collapsed. However, the XRPD pattern of the cyclohexanol-free matrix 2, ob- tained under the same conditions, shows that the crystalline periodicity remains unchanged so that another cyclohexa- nol-free motif 2’ can be obtained directly under solvatother- mal conditions for which an X-ray single-crystal study has been undertaken.[17a] Compound 5 also has a stable porous framework structure. Details of the relevant studies have been reported in reference [7]. With relatively larger frame- work densities (Table 1), compounds 3 and 4 demonstrate almost the same TGA result: there is no weight loss until about 5008C, above which the dramatic weight loss indicates decomposition of the compounds.

The tempera- ture dependence of the magnetic susceptibility in the high- temperature range (T>30 K), cM, can be fit to the Curie± Weiss expression, cM = C/(Tq), (C = 0.125 g2S(S+1)), with g = 2.34, q = 26.4 K for 1; g = 2.36, q = 26.2 K for 2; g = 2.32, q = 31.2 K for 3; g = 2.34, q = 32.4 K for 4; and g = 2.31, q = 29.4 K for 5. These g values are all as expected for tetrahedral CoII ions.[18a,d] At 300 K, the effective moments, meff(8cT)1/2, are 4.4 (1), 4.3 (2), 4.1(3), 4.3 (4), and 4.3(5) mB, which are as expected for one high- spin tetrahedral CoII ion with spin-orbit coupling.[18a,d] Ac- cording to the obtained Weiss constants and the reciprocal molar magnetic susceptibilities from 300 to 2 K (Figure 7), a dominant weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the cobalt(ii) ions in 1±5 can be suggested. However, in the low- temperature regions, the magnetic behaviors of the five compounds are quite different from each other (inset of Figure 7). Compound 1: Figure 8a presents cM data versus T from 2 to 300 K and d(cMT)/dT data versus T obtained below 100 K. The results show that the magnetic susceptibilities increase from 0.01 cm3mol1 at 300 K to a maximum value of 0.062 cm3mol1 at 14.5 K, then, after a sharp downturn, they approach a value of 0.041 cm3mol1 by extrapolating the temperature to zero.

The d(cMT)/dT versus T curve shows a maximum value at 13.11 K for the Neel tem- perature (TN).[19] According to these results, antiferromag- netic coupling between the cobalt(ii) ions with an antiferro- magnetic ordering below 13.11 K is suggested. This is also supported by the magnetization values below TN which vary linearly with the applied fields up to the maximum field strength studied (70 kOe); no net magnetization was ob- served at an applied field of zero. Further evidence for 1 to be an antiferromagnet comes from the reversible lines through the center observed upon cycling the field between +10 and 10 kOe at 1.82 K (Figure 8b). Compound 2: Susceptibility cM versus T from 2 to 300 K and d(cMT)/dT versus T below 100 K plots are shown in Fig- ure 9a. Similar to compound 1, the susceptibility increases from 0.01 cm3mol1 at 300 K to a maximum value of 0.063 cm3mol1 near 15 K, then, decreases sharply to a value of 0.045 cm3mol1, the extrapolated value at zero tempera- ture. However, this value cannot be fitted to the 2/3 rela- tionship with the maximum susceptibility as is the case for compound 1. From the temperature dependence of d(cMT)/ dT, the maximum value of d(cMT)/dT was acquired and the antiferromagnetic ordering below 13.5 K (TN) was indicated. However, the low-field field-cooled (FC) temperature de- pendence of magnetization acquired while cooling from 20 K in an applied field of 200 Oe (Figure 9b) reveals a fer- romagnetic phase transition related to spin canting below 15 K (TC). Hysteretic behavior (with a visible loop) was ob- served at 1.82 K and the magnetization at this temperature in the applied field to the maximum strength of 70 kOe in- creases, as in compound 1, almost linearly and slowly with the applied field; however, very small net magnetization is observed at zero field (Figure 9d). All of this is evidence of a very weak ferromagnetism caused by small, uncompensat- ed antiferromagnetic spin-canting. With regards to 2 being a ferromagnet, further evidence comes from the AC suscepti- bility (Figure 9c): in different applied AC field frequencies, the cAC responses are frequency independent and they appear in both the in-phase c’ and out-of-phase c’’ reflec- tions at about 15 K. Compound 3: Magnetic susceptibility cM and cMT versus temperature plots are shown in Figure 10a. As the tempera- ture is lowed from 300 K, the value of cMT decreases.

KGaA, Weinheim 5679 Cobalt(ii) Imidazolate Three-Dimensional Frameworks 5673 ± 5685 minimum value of cMT occurs before a small abrupt increase at 11.5 K, after which the value of cMT decreases linearly to 2 K. The magnetic transition at 11.5 K is indicative of the onset of a ferromagnetic ordering resulting from spin-canted antiferromagnetic coupling. Support for such a ferromagnet- ic ordering comes from the low-field field-cooled (FC) mag- netization (Figure 10b). The plot of M versus T at an ap- plied field 200 Oe in the temperature range 2±20 K shows that an abrupt increase of the M value occurs at 11.5 K, which indicates a ferromagnetic phase transition. Further support comes from cycling the applied field between +5 and 5 kOe at 1.8, 5, and 10 K, which have generated hyste- resis loops (Figure 10d). From these loops, the coercive fields of 1800, 1000, and 10 Oe are observed and remnant magnetizations of 0.016, 0.023, and 0.017 NmBmol1 are ob- tained at 1.8, 5, and 10 K, respectively. Magnetization versus applied field at 1.8 K demonstrates in Figure 10d that it varies linearly from 7 up to 50 kOe, and reaches a magneti- zation value of 0.5 Nbmol1 at 50 kOe, significantly below the theoretical saturation value of 3 Nb [for g = 2, high- spin tetrahedral coordinated CoII (s = 3/2)] suggesting a long-range ferromagnetic ordering resulting from the spin- canted antiferromagnetic coupling. To confirm the magnetic ordering, the temperature de- pendencies of the in-phase, c’(T), and out-of-phase, c’’(T) components of the AC susceptibility were measured (Fig- ure 10c). In different applied AC field frequencies, the cAC responses are frequency independent and an out-of-phase reflection c’’ appears at 11.5 K, which is further evidence of long-range ferromagnetic ordering. Compound 4: Magnetic susceptibility cM and cMT versus temperature data are shown in Figure 11a. As the tempera- ture decreases from 300 K, the cMT value decreases grad- ually. At 15.5 K, the cMT value increases abruptly, reach- ing a maximum at 15 K before decreasing rapidly on fur- ther cooling to 2 K. This behavior suggests antiferromagnet- ic coupling between cobalt(ii) centers and a ferromagnetic magnetic ordering below the 15 K (TC). Support for the fer- romagnetic ordering comes from the low-field FC magneti- zation (Figure 11b) showing the onset below 15.5 K. Further evidence that confirms the magnetic ordering below 15.5 K is provided by the temperature dependencies of c’(T) and c’’(T) (Figure 11c), both of which have strong responses in- dependent of the AC field frequency. The critical tempera- ture (TC) of 15.5 K indicative of the bulk magnetic ordering is determined according to the peak position of c’ at 111 Hz.

The magnetic hysteresis (Figure 11d) at 2 and 5 K between 20 kOe shows a coercive field of 7300 and 1700 Oe with small remnant magnetization of 0.07 and 0.09 Nbmol1, re- spectively. At 1 K, the magnetization (Figure 11d) above 15 kOe varies almost linearly as the applied field increases and reaches 0.7 Nbmol1 at 70 kOe, which is also significant- ly below the predicted saturation value of 3 Nbmol1. Compound 5: Magnetic behavior of 5 at high temperatures is almost as same as that of the other four compounds ac- cording to the plot of cMT versus temperature (Figure 12a). However, in the low-temperature range, the magnetic be- havior is quite different: in the low-field FC magnetization M versus T at applied field 200 Oe in the temperature range 2±20 K (Figure 12b), although the magnetic phase transition arising from spin-canting is observed at 10.3 K and, further- more, the hysteresis loops at 1.8 and 5.0 K (Figure 12d) are also presented. However, the result of the AC susceptibility reveals that compound 5 can be regarded as a hidden spin- canted antiferromagnet because the obvious in-phase c’(T) cusps appear at 10.6 K and they are frequency independent while the corresponding c’’(T) components are not ob- served.[20] Discussion The extended polymorphism of cobalt(ii) imidazolate (or copper(ii) imidazolate) 3D frameworks is a rare phenomen- on in polymeric coordination compounds, although polymor- phism is more general than expected in some polymeric sys- tems.[14,21] However, for the polymeric coordination com- pounds that maintain an identical framework composition and coordinate style, to give at least five different topologi- cal framework structures, this phenomenon must arise from some inherent structural features of the compounds and we attribute this, in the case of cobalt(ii) imidazolates (or copper imidazolates) to the special conformational flexibili- ty of zeolite-like structures that results from the special co- ordinate orientations of the imidazolate ligand. The rotation of imidazolate about the CoN bonds affords a wider range of Co-Co-Co (T-T-T) angles than those of the corresponding linear ligand, such as 4,4’-bipyridine,[22] in which the T-T-T angles are not greatly different from the N-T-N angles. This makes the cobalt(ii) imidazolate more facilitate the forma- tion of the smaller or larger T-atom rings and benefits gener- ating the structures of zeolitic topology. For example, there are 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8-rings in the framework of 5, in which the Co-Co-Co angles vary from 74.8 to 163.28, while the N- Figure 11. a) Plots of temperature dependence of cM (left) and cMT (right) for 4 measured at 10 kOe field. b) Plot of field-cooled (FCM) measured at 200 Oe field for 4. c) Plots of temperature dependence of AC susceptibility c’(top) and c’’(bottom) obtained at 20 Oe field for 4. d) Magnetization versus applied magnetic field at 1.8 K and hysteresis loops in the 20 kOe range at 1.8 and 5.0 K for 4.

These rings that have gener- ated more than a hundred different structures of zeolites or zeolite-like molecular sieves. Therefore, it is reasonable to compare the cobalt(ii) imidazolates to the silicalite or zeolite together and we predict that there are even more polymor- phous frameworks of cobalt imidazolate to be explored. Nevertheless, the compounds of cobalt(ii) imidazolate re- ported herein are only obtained with the silica-like metal± organic frameworks, of which the polymorphs 3 and 4 are related to the dense phases of silica with formula [M(im)2] (corresponding to the dense silica SiO2) and the polymor- phous frameworks of 1, 2, and 5 are related to the porous phases of silica with the formula [M(im)2¥xG] (correspond- ing to the porous silica, the silicalite [SiO2¥xG] (G = guest molecule)). Although we have managed to form hybrids be- tween the cobalt imidazolate and MIII T atoms or O atoms, the reasons for the lack of success may lie the synthetic strategy. We assume that if a rationale synthetic strategy could be developed, the zeolite-like or AlPO4-like structures of metal imidazolate might be realizable and the polymor- phism of cobalt imidazolate or metal imidazolate frame- works could then be greatly extended.

Like in the synthesis of zeolite, there are also many vari- ables (the structure-directing agents, template agents, sol- vents, and temperature as well as the amount of the used solvent) that can be adjusted in the syntheses of cobalt imi- dazolates. Changing these variables may lead to the genera- tion of different polymorphous frameworks of cobalt(ii) imi- dazolate (Table 1). First, the porous frameworks of cobalt imidazolate like those of silicalites are kinetically controlled, while the dense frameworks are controlled thermodynami- cally. To create such materials with even larger pores, a new synthetic strategy at low temperature is required and our ef- forts in this regard are ongoing. Second, although the mech- anism for solvatothermal synthesis of cobalt(ii) imidazolate is not yet clear, we are certain that the mechanism here is different from that in a zeolite synthesis. The structure-di- recting agents play an important role in generating the porous species of cobalt imidazolate (Table 1); these agents may have served not only as the bases to deprotonate the imidazole, but also as coordinate ligands to form the inter- mediary coordination compounds, which are then translated into the final crystalline products under solvatothermal con- ditions. The experiments also revealed that the trialkyla- mines commonly used in zeolite synthesis are not as capable of directing the cobalt(ii) imidazolate to a crystalline sub- stance since they cannot serve as ligands. It also seems that piperazine is an effective structure-directing agent, although the mechanism is not yet clear. Up to now, only a limited number of structure-directing agents and solvents (template agents) have been tested. Therefore, the elucidation of the structure-directing effects and the optimization of the condi- tions will require much futher study. With regard to the magnetic properties, the imidazolate linkages of compounds 1±5 transmit the antiferromagnetic interactions between the cobalt(ii) ions, and the magnetic behavior of the compounds resembles the common charac- ters of tetrahedrally coordinated cobalt: 1) Compared to compounds of tetrahedral cobalt(ii) with magnetic ordering temperatures below 1 K[18b] which are associated with weak magnetic exchange between the cobalt ions, compounds 1±5 exhibit higher magnetic or- dering temperatures that may be attributed to relatively strong magnetic interactions between the cobalt ions that are transmitted by the imidazolate bridges rather than to the single ion anisotropy of CoII.[23] According to the q values of compounds 1±5 and the conventional mean-field expression for a Heisenberg antiferromag- net,[24] J/kb = 3q/[2zS(S + 1)], where z = 4 is the number of nearest neighbors, the values of J/kb are esti- mated to be 2.6 K for 1 and 2, 3.1 K for 3, 3.2 K for 4, and 2.9 K for 5, respectively. They are thus approxi- mately two times greater than that in b-CoII[N(CN)2]2.[25] 2) According to the g values of compounds 1±5 in the range 2.2±2.4, which were obtained by fitting the Curie± Weiss expression, cM = 1/(Tq), the small anisotropic g values are characterized as typical tetrahedral cobalt ions ordered in s = 3/2 spin with small zero-field split- ting. 3) The weak magnetism in 2±5 arises from the spin canting of the antiferromagnetically interacted CoII ions. The origin of the spin canting should be mainly due to the antisymmetric interaction between the neighboring CoII ions, in combination with possible local anisotropy of CoII ions. For all five compounds reported here, single- bridging imidazolate linkages between CoII ions produce low-symmetry CoII-L-CoII exchange pathways, which should be responsible for the antisymmetric interactions, even though the space group of 5 is centrosymmetric. On the other hand, the weak ferromagnetism from cant- ing may be hidden when many sublattices are present, such as in the case of 5.[18c,20] Why compounds 1 and 2 have such different magnetic behaviors, is still an open question. Conclusion The work reported here focuses on the synthesis of open metal±organic frameworks with zeolitic topologies. Consid- ering the structural motif of zeolites, we devised the metal- organic building block [Co(im)4]2, from which the silica- like structures of extended polymorphous frameworks of co- balt(ii) imidazolate have been realized by a modification of a strategy to synthesize zeolites. Superior to gas-phase syn- thesis,[9b,10] the solvatothermal method favors not only the generation of crystalline products that are suitable for X-ray single-crystal analysis, but also of porous structures if the proper structure-directing agents and templates (or space- filling agent) are employed. More interestingly, the polymor- phous frameworks contain structural features reminiscent of those in silica. Although up to now the polymorphous frameworks of cobalt(ii) imidazolate with cristobalite-, tridy- mite-, or quartz-like structures have not yet been obtained, we believe that they exist because we recently obtained a cadmium imidazolate [Cd(im)2]¥ [26] with a twofold inter- penetrated cristobalite-like structure. Moreover, the differ- ent structures of cobalt(ii) imidazolates have indeed afford- ed various magnetic behaviors that are theoretically signifi- cant for the understanding of the relationship between struc- tures and magnetic properties and further for a rational design of molecular magnetic materials. Experimental Section General procedure: All chemicals and solvents used in the syntheses were from commercial sources and used without further purification except for the piperazine hexahydrate (PZ) which was treated at 1408C under 10 mmHg vacuum for 2 h and was used arbitrarily as piperazine di- hydrate in the syntheses. Physical measurements: Elemental analysis for C, H, and N were carried out at the Materials Analysis Center of Nanjing University with a Perkin-Elmer240 analyzer. Fourier-transform IR (FT-IR) Spectra were recorded in KBr pellets on a Nicolet FT-IR17SX. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out with a TA-SDT2960 and a heating rate of 58Cmin1 from 20±6008C under a flux of nitrogen. Magnetic measurements: The magnetic measurements for 1±5 were car- ried out on crystalline samples with a MagLab System2000 magnetome- ter in a magnetic field up to 70 KOe. Diamagnetic corrections were esti- mated from Pascal×s constants. Chem. Eur. J. 2003, 9, 5673 ± 5685 www.chemeurj.org ¹ 2003 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Absorption correc- tion was applied by means of y scan data.
