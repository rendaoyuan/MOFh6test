Manuscript DOI: 10.1002/chem.200902729 Cadmium Imidazolate Frameworks with Polymorphism, High Thermal Stability, and a Large Surface Area Yun-Qi Tian,*[a] Shi-Yan Yao,[a] Dong Gu,[b] Ke-Hui Cui,[a] Dong-Wei Guo,[a] Gao Zhang,[a] Zhen-Xia Chen,[b] and Dong-Yuan Zhao*[b] Since the initial inspiration for realizing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with zeolitic structures,[1] considerable effort has been made towards novel approaches to construct zeolitic metal–organic frameworks (ZMOFs) by using tetra- hedral metal imidazolates.[2–6] To date, numerous ZMOFs have been synthesized with the motifs of which only those with desired porosity and thermal stability are potentially applicable for gas storage, separation, catalysts, encapsula- tion of target molecules, etc. For rational synthesis of porous and thermostable ZMOFs with the imidazole ligands, the in- troduction of smaller substituent groups onto imidazole ring has been found to be a vital strategy,[3,4] because the groups play not only the role of structure-directing agent (tem- plate), but also the sites for functionalizing.[4d] Moreover, as an inseparable supporting template, the substituent group can stabilize the imidazolate ZMOFs, however, it also pres- ents an encumbrance that inevitably blocks pores—leading to a reduction of the pore size and surface area. Furthermore, any 2-substituent at the imidazole ring may restrict the flexibility of the MN bond rotation and render the imidazolates either barely to be generated or lacking in framework diversity. For example, the MOFs of metal 2-sub- stituent imidazolates [{MACHTUNGTRENUNG(R-im)2}]1 (M=ZnII and CoII, R- im=2-substituent imidazolates)[3,4a] have been only prepared for those with R-group to be methyl, ethyl, nitro and car- boxaldehyde and each of them has been observed with no more than one MOF structure that exhibits the MN bond 2.05  (and M···M distance 6.0 ). On the supposition that the MN bond (and M···M distance) could be expanded (Scheme 1), the lack of framework diversity from a 2-sub- stituent imidazolate might be improved because the elongat- ed MN bond (and M···M distance) can weaken the self- template effect of the 2-substituent group and then, the M N bond is rewarded with a modified flexibility of rotation. Apparently, the synthesis of cadmium 2-substituent imidazo- lates (CdIFs) of [{CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(R-im)2}]1 (R=methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, phenyl and nitro) shall display the role of a R- group and the effect of MN bond elongation since the al- ready reported cadmium imidazolate framework[7] was ob- served with a elongated MN bond 2.20  (and M···M dis- tance 6.40 ). In this paper, we report the synthesis, struc- ture and gas adsorption properties of the polymorphous CdIFs. CdIFs of 2-substituent imidazolates were synthesized by solvothermal (or room-temperature) reaction of [Cd- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH3COO)2]·2H2O and 2-substituent imidazoles [R-im-H, R=methyl (mimH), ethyl (eimH), n-propyl (pimH), n-butyl (buimH), phenyl (phimH) and nitro (nimH)] in alkyl-alco- hols (or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylace- tamide (DMA) and 1-methyl-2-pyrollidone (NMP)). Four MOF structures were produced from [{CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(mim)2}]1, CdIF- 1, -2, -3, and -5; two MOF structures were formed from [{CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(eim)2}]1, CdIF-4 and -6; three MOF structures were formed from [{CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(nim)2}]1, CdIF-7, -8, -9; and one MOF structure each for the remaining other cadmium 2-alkylimi- [a] Prof. Dr. Y.-Q.

X-ray single-crystal analyses reveal that CdIF-1–12[8] are all three-dimensional (3D) frameworks (Figure 1), in which each CdII ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by four imidazo- late nitrogen atoms and each imidazolate bridges two CdII ions (CdN 2.15 to 2.40 , N-Cd-N 109.5 to 120.68 and Cd···Cd distance 6.4 ) that are all similar to those of zinc (or cobalt) imidazolate frame- works except the MN bonds (and M···M) being about 0.2  (and M···M about 0.4 ) elongated. It is just this small elongation of the MN bond that has led to the cadmi- um 2-methyl-, 2-ethyl- and 2- nitro-imidazolates being poly- morphous: CdIF-1 to -3 and -5 exhibit the net topology of sod, mer, yqt1[9] and ict;[10] CdIF-4 and -6 display the net topology of rho and ana while CdIF-7, -8 and -9 show that of dia, sod and rho, respectively. However, for the other cadmium imidazo- lates with the relative large R-substituent groups, the in- creased size of R-group again dismisses the flexibility of M N bond rotation resulted from MN bond elongation, lead- ing to the cadmium imidazolates again with no more than one MOF: both of CdIF-10 and CdIF-11 demonstrate the net topology of ana, while CdIF-12 shows the topology of dia. Besides the polymorphous phenomenon, the elongated MN bonds (and M···M distance) also make increased pore Table 1. The ZCIFs of [{CdACHTUNGTRENUNG(R-im)2}]1 and their structural characteristics.

With T/V in the range of 1.63 to 3.87 nm3, CdIFs are generally regarded as more open than those of their zinc (and cobalt) imidazolate counterparts (T/V in the range of 2.0 to 4.6 nm3).[4a] However, in respect that the inclusion of heavier metal Cd ions reduces any gain in gravimetric ca- pacity, it should be more amenable to evaluate their porosi- ty with apparent surface area. Gas adsorption studies were carried out for CdIF-1 (SOD), CdIF-4 (RHO), CdIF-9 (RHO) and CdIF-10 (ANA) as the prototypes because not only they are thermo- stable up to 4008C (TGA analyses and XRD studies for the CdIFs, see the Supporting Information), but also they with pure phases can be readily prepared on a gram-scale and they have the zinc counterparts for the surface area compar- ison. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms show type I curves, which reveal the microporous nature (Figure 2a).The Lang- muir surface areas of CdIF-1, -4, -9, -10 are 2420, 2420, 3010 and 1060 m2g1, respectively, and are based on data collect- ed from the adsorption branch in the range of P/P0=0.01– 0.10. Whereas the micropore volumes are calculated based on a single data point at P/P0=0.10 and are 0.860, 0.764, 0.994 and 0.372 cm3g1for CdIF-1, -4, -9 and -10, respective- ly. As compared with ZIF-8 (SOD) (Langmuir surface area of 1810 m2g1),[4c] BIF-9-Li (RHO) (Langmuir surface area of 1820 m2g1)[5d] and [ZnACHTUNGTRENUNG(pim)2]1 (ANA)[11] (Langmuir sur- face area of 579 m2g1, see Figure S16 in the Supporting In- formation), the four prototypical CdIFs prepared here by the approach of elongating MN bond do not appear to have reduced surface areas, as a result of the inclusion of heavier metal Cd atoms, actually it seems that an increase in surface area resulted from the MN bond expansion. Their porosities characterized with N2 adsorptions are agreeable to that of the total potential solvent accessible volume calcu- lated by PLATON program. Three cycles of H2 sorption-desorption for CdIF-1 and -4 at 77 K were performed under applied pressure up to 10 bar, which showed reversible and stable hydrogen adsorp- tion behavior. The H2-uptakes at 10 bar are 2.68 wt% (or 297 cm3g1) and 1.91 wt% (or 212 cm3g1) for CdIF-1 and CdIF-4, respectively (Figure 3). In the comparison to ZIF-8 with 1.29 wt% uptake of H2 at 1 bar,[4c] a lower 0.93 wt% H2-uptake for CdIF-1 at 1 bar is resulted from the pore ex- pansion[12] and the replacement of Zn with heavier Cd in the CdIFs. CO2 adsorption isotherms at 273 K and 1 bar for CdIF-1, -4, and -9 samples (Figure 4) show the volumetric uptakes of 48 cm3g1(2.2 mmolg1), 30 cm3g1(1.34 mmolg1) and 21 cm3g1(0.94 mmolg1), respectively. The high CO2 ad- sorption amount for CdIF-9 is not just a result of its relative large surface area, but also to the -NO2 groups that can in- teract with CO2 molecules.[13] In summary, we have successfully synthesized a family of cadmium 2-substituent imidazolates (CdIF-1 to -12) with highly thermostable and polymorphous MOFs by the ap- Figure 2.

So far, we have ob- tained more than twelve CdIFs that exhibit not only the ex- pected polymorphism, high thermal stability (up to 4008C), but also surprisingly large porosity: CdIF-9 (rho) has a sur- face area of 3010 m3g1, representing the highest value among the so far discovered metal imidazolate frameworks; CdIF-1 and -4 exhibit to be the most applicable porous MOFs because of their low costs of precursors and the mas- sive producible synthesis, as well as their relatively high sur- face area of 2420 m3g1and thermal stability up to 4008C. Experimental Section Typical synthesis for CdIFs: The solvothermal method: Cadmium acetate dihydrate (0.267 g, 1.0 mmol) and 2-alkylimidazole (5.0 mmol) dissolved in 15 mL of alkyl- alcohols were placed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The reactant mixture was heated at 100–1408C for 24–72 h and then cooled to room temperature. The obtained products were filtered and washed with etha- nol (310 mL), colorless (or pale yellow) crystals were collected, yield 40–70%; The organic-base diffusion method: A mixture of cadmium nitrate tetra- hydrate (0.1543 g, 0.5 mmol) and 2-alkylimidazole (1.0 mmol) in a select- ed solvent (5 mL) was placed in a 10 mL vial that was stirred until all stating materials dissolved. This vial was inserted in a larger vial contain- ing another 10 mL vial filled with triethylamine (0.2 mL) and the selected solvent (5 mL). The larger vial was sealed and left undisturbed for about two weeks to crystallize. The colorless crystals were selected for single crystal analysis. Crystal structure analysis for CdIFs: The single-crystal data for CdIF-1– 12 were collected by using a Bruker SMART-APEX-II CCD diffractome- ter with MoKa radiation (l=0.71073 ). The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-square techniques on F2 using the SHELXL program package. All non-hydrogen atoms except those disordered ones were refined anisotropically and the hydrogen atoms were generated and included in the structure calculations with as- signed isotropic thermal parameters but not refined. Powder X-ray dif- fraction patterns were determined by using a Bruker D8 Advance dif- fractometer at room temperature with CuKa radiation.

Synthesis of CdIF-1 to -12: CdIF-1(sod): A mixture of cadmium acetate dihydrate (0.267 g, 1.0 mmol) and 2-methylimidazole (0.410 g, 5.0 mmol) dissolved in 15 mL n-butanol was placed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The reactant mixture was heated at 120°C for 24 hours and then cooled to room temperature. After separation by filtering, colorless (or pale yellow) crystals were washed with ethanol (3 ×10 mL) and evacuated in vacuum at room temperature (yield 55%); Elemental analysis Calcd.(%) for C8H10N4Cd = CdIF-1 (M = 274.61): C, 34.99; H, 3.67; N, 20.40; Found(%): C, 35.01; H, 3.71; N, 20.03 CdIF-2(mer): a) synthesis of the single crystal for X-ray diffraction. a mixture of cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (0.154 g, 0.5 mmol) and 2-methylimidazole (0.0821 g, 1.0 mmol) in N-methyl-pyrrolidione (NMP) (5 mL) was placed in a 10 mL trial that was stirred until all starting materials dissolved. This vial was inserted in a larger vial containing another 10 mL vial filled with triethylamine (0.2 mL) and the NMP (5 mL). The larger vial was sealed and left undisturbed for about two weeks to crystallize. The colorless crystal was selected for single crystal analysis; b) synthesis of bulk sample of CdIF-2: to A mixture of cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (1.109 g, 3.6 mmol) and 2-methylimidazole (0.591 g, 7.2 mmol) in N-methyl-pyrrolidione (NMP) (30 mL), 10 mL NMP containing 1.0 mL triethylamine was added under stirring at room temperature in ca. 2 hours. Then, the reactant mixture was left stirring at room temperature for anther 46 hours. The white participate was filtered and left to air-dry, yielding ca. 0.45 g white powder that was confirmed to be CdIF-2 for its XRD similar to that simulated from the corresponding single crystal date. However, as a large amount of NMP was evacuated from the framework of CdIF-2, its structural integrity had been lost and finally became to amorphous solid. CdIF-3 (yqt1): A mixture of cadmium acetate dihydrate (0.267 g, 1.0 mmol) and 2-methylimidazole (0.410 g, 5.0 mmol) dissolved in 15 mL methanol were placed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The reactant mixture was heated at 90°C for 24 hours and then cooled to room temperature. After separation by filtering, colorless crystals were washed with ethanol (3 ×10 mL) and evacuated in vacuum at room temperature (yield 50%); Elementary analysis for C12H15N6Cd1.5 = CdIF-3 (yqt1) (M = 411.90) Calcd.(%): C, 34.99; H, 3.67; N, 20.40. Found (%): C, 35.01; H, 3.73; N, 20.34. CdIF-4 (rho): A mixture of cadmium acetate dihydrate (0.534 g, 2.0 mmol) and 2-ethylimidazole (0.961 g, 10.0 mmol) dissolved in 20 mL methanol was placed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The reactant mixture was heated at 120°C for 12 hours and then cooled to room temperature. After separation by filtering, colorless (or pale yellow) crystals were washed with methanol (3 ×10 mL) and evacuated in vacuum at room temperature (yield 60 %); Elementary analysis Calcd (%) for C10H14N4Cd = CdIF-4 (M = 302.66): C, 39.68; H, 4.66; N, 18.51; Found (%): C, 39.921; H, 4.31; N, 18.20 CdIF-5(ict): The synthesis is similar to that of the solvothermal preparation of CdIF-1 by using benzenemethanol as solvent. (The yield is very low (merely a few of single crystals was obtained). CdIF-6 (ana): A mixture of Cd(CH3COO)2⋅2H2O (0.267g, 1 mmol)， Heim (0.192 g, 2 mmol), anhydrous piperazine (0.084 g, 1 mmol) were added to ethanol (20 mL), and after being stirred for 12 hours, this heterogeneous mixture was placed into a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Then, the autoclave was sealed and heated at 120℃ for 60 hours. After being cooled to ambient room temperature, the autoclave was opened and colorless crystals of CdIF-4 (rho) mixed with CdIF-6 (ana) were separated by filtration, washed with methanol (10 mL ×3) and dried in air. CdIF-7α (dia): A mixture of Cd(NO3)2⋅4H2O (0.0154g, 0.05 mmol)， Hnim (0.0226 g, 0.2 mmol) and DMF/benzenemethanol (3 mL / 3 mL) was placed into a 15 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Then, the autoclave was sealed and heated at 100℃ for 20 hours. After being cooled to ambient room temperature, the autoclave was opened and colorless crystals of CdIF-7α (rho) mixed with CdIF-9 (rho) were separated by filtration, washed with methanol (10 mL ×3) and dried in air. CdIF-7β (dia): A mixture of Cd(ClO4)2⋅6H2O (0.0209g, 0.05 mmol)， Hnim (0.0113 g, 0.1 mmol) and DMF (8 mL) was placed into a 15 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Then, the autoclave was sealed and heated at 120 ℃ for 72 hours. After being cooled to ambient room temperature, the autoclave was opened and colorless crystals of CdIF-7β (dia) (C12H8N12O8Cd2⋅0.25DMF) mixed with CdIF-9 (rho) were separated by filtration, washed with methanol (10 mL ×3) and dried in air. CdIF-8 (sod): A mixture of Cd(NO3)2⋅4H2O (0.192g, 0.625 mmol)， Hnim (0.1425 g, 1.25 mmol) and DMF (15 mL) was placed into a 15 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Then, the autoclave was sealed and heated at 120 ℃ for 12 hours. After being cooled to ambient room temperature, the autoclave was opened and colorless crystals of CdIF-8 were separated by filtration. X-ray single crystal analysis reveals a zeolitic sodalite-like structure and XRD spectrum for the bulk sample is agreeable to that simulated from the X-ray single crystal data. However, as CdIF-8 was washed with methanol (10 mL ×3) and evacuated in vacuum, its zeolitic sodalite structure was destroyed. CdIF-9 (rho): A mixture of Cd(NO3)2⋅4H2O (0.192g, 0.625 mmol)， Hnim (0.1425 g, 1.25 mmol) and DMA (15 mL) was placed into a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Then, the autoclave was sealed and heated at 100 ℃ for 12 hours. After being cooled to ambient room temperature, the autoclave was opened and colorless crystals of CdIF-9 were separated by filtration, washed with methanol (10 mL ×3) and dried in air.

Single crystal structure analysis for CdIFs: The data for CdIFs were collected on a Bruker SMART-APEX-II CCD diffractometer with MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-square techniques on F2 using the SHELX program package. All non-hydrogen atoms except those disordered ones were refined anisotropically and the hydrogen atoms were generated and included in the structure calculations with assigned isotropic thermal parameters but not refined, however, the hydrogen atoms are not added for some disordered atoms in the frameworks (including the crystal solvents). In order to reaching an ideal reliability factor for CdIF-2 refinement, 97 bad reflections were omitted. Figure S1. Ball- and-stick diagram of 3D structure for CdIF-1 Table S1.
