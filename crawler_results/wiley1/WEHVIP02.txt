KGaA, Weinheim Synthesis, Crystal Structure and Thermal Stability Study of [Cu2(bpe)X2]n (bpe＝1,2-trans-bi(4-pyridyl)ethene, X＝Cl, Br, I) CHEN, San-Ping(陈三平) FAN, Guang(范广) GAO, Sheng-Li*(高胜利) Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Physico-inorganic Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710069, China A series of copper(I) halide complexes bridged by bpe (bpe＝1,2-trans-bi(4-pyridyl)ethene), [Cu2(bpe)Cl2]n (1), [Cu2(bpe)Br2]n (2) and [Cu2(bpe)I2]n (3) were successfully synthesized and complex 1 has been structurally charac- terized by a single crystal X-ray diffraction method. Crystal data for 1 are monoclinic, space group P2(1)/c, a＝ 0.3788(8) nm, b＝1.5059(3) nm, c＝1.0875(2) nm, β＝96.262(4)°, V＝0.6165(2) nm3, Z＝2, S＝1.002, final R in- dices [I＞2σ(I)] R1＝0.0288, wR2＝0.0579, R index (all data) R1＝0.0509, wR2＝0.0615. Elemental analyses and IR spectra reveal that the complexes are of isomorphic compounds. In addition, thermogravimetric analyses were also applied to research of the thermal stability of the title complexes. Keywords copper(I) halide, crystal structure, single X-ray diffraction, thermal stability Introduction The great interest currently in copper(I) coordination chemistry is due to not only the participation of this cation in certain biochemical redox reactions and its ability to adopt various coordination modes,1,2 but also potential application in research fields such as lumines- cence, catalysis, etc.3-6 Yaghi,7,8 Alexander,9 Battern10 and Li11 synthesized and characterized lots of various copper(I) halide complexes bridged by N-heterocyclic linear organic ligands such as 1,2-trans-bi(4-pyridyl)- ethane (bpe), 4,4'-bipyridyl (bpy) and pyrazine. As an analog, we synthesized a series of copper(I) halide complexes bridged by bpe with the formula of [Cu2(bpe)X2]n (X＝Cl, Br, I), characterized the crystal structure of [Cu2(bpe)Cl2]n through a single crystal X-ray diffraction method, and investergated their ther- mal stabilities. Experimental Materials and measurements 1,2-trans-Bi(4-pyridyl)ethene was purchased from Acros. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade without further purification. Elemental analyses of C, H, N were performed on a Vario EL III analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on an Equinox 55 instrument with KBr pellets within the range of 4000—400 cm －1. All TG-DTG tests were performed with a Netzsch STA 449C thermogravimetric instrument. Synthesis of [Cu2(bpe)Cl2]n (1) An orange-red needle-like complex [Cu2(bpe)Cl2]n (1) was obtained from the mixture of 1,2-trans-bi(4- pyridyl)ethene (0.091 g, 0.5 mmol), CuCl2 (0.078 g, 0.5 mmol), 0.2 mL of H3PO3 and H2O (20 mL), which were placed in a sealed 30 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel reactor and heated to 100 ℃ for 72 h, then cooled at 5 ℃ per hour to room temperature. Yield 46%; IR (KBr) ν: 1600 (s), 1541 (w), 1492 (w), 1421 (s), 1010 (w), 973 (s), 823 (s), 543 (s) cm －1. Anal. calcd for C12H10Cl2- Cu2N2: C 37.91, H 2.65, N 7.37; found C 37.95, H 2.62, N 7.33. Synthesis of [Cu2(bpe)Br2]n (2) All the procedures were common to those of 1, ex- cept that CuBr2 was used instead of CuCl2, which af- forded a light orange needle-like single crystal. Yield 53%; IR (KBr) ν: 1600 (s), 1541 (w), 1492 (w), 1420 (s), 1011 (w), 971 (s), 823 (s), 544 (s) cm －1. Anal. calcd for C12H10Br2Cu2N2: C 30.72, H 2.15, N 5.97; found C 30.68, H 2.12, N 5.95. Synthesis of [Cu2(bpe)I2]n (3) This complex was prepared according to the litera- ture,9 which was further characterized by a single crys- tal X-ray diffraction analysis. IR (KBr) ν: 1600 (s), 1556 (w), 1495 (w), 1422 (s), 1011 (ms), 967 (s), 824 (s), 545 (s) cm －1. Anal. calcd for C12H10I2Cu2N2: C 25.59, H 1.79, N 4.97; found C 25.52, H 1.78, N 4.95.

KGaA, Weinheim matized Mo Kα radiation (λ＝0.071073 nm) using ω and φ scan modes for structural measurement at room temperature. Corrections for polarized factor, Lorentz factor and absorption were carried out. The structures were all resolved by a direct method and refined with full-matrix least-squares refinements based on F2 using the SHELXTL program package.12-14 Anisotropic ther- mal parameters were applied to all non-hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically and allowed to ride on their mother atoms. Crystal data, data collection parameters and refinement statistics for 1 are listed in Table 1. Selected bond distances and bond an- gles are given in Table 2.

The or- ange color of them indicates that the valence of cop- per(II) has been changed to copper(I) during the reac- tion process, which is consistent with the results of sin- gle crystal X-ray diffraction and element analyses. Ac- cording to Chambers,15 H3PO3 is a reducing reagent and the reduction ability becomes more powerful with in- creasing temperature. So, Cu(II) ions can be reduced to Cu(I) by H3PO3 under hydrothermal conditions, which we have successfully applied to synthesis of mixed- valence copper coordination polymer.16 Structural characterization revealed that complex 1 is isomorphic with complex 3, incorporats the [CuCl]n staircase motif, which is constructed from one- dimensional staircase-like [CuCl]n motif connected by the linear bridging ligands to give planar two- dimensional sheets, crystallizes in monoclinic, space group P2(1)/c. As can be seen from Figure 1, every Cl atom adopts a μ3 bridging mode and each copper(I) center is coordinated to three adjacent halide ions,11 leaving a single vacant coordination site. This remaining fourth site is occupied by a nitrogen donor from the bridging ligand to give rise to a tetrahedron configura- tion for copper (I) center atom, which bridges adjacent [CuCl]n stair-polymer resulting in the formation of pla- nar two-dimensional sheets. In the complexes 1 and 3, the average bond distances of Cu—N and Cu—X gradually rise with the increasing atom radii of Cl and I, which are 0.1991(2) and 0.2421 nm for 1 and 0.2055 and 0.2650 nm for 3,9 respectively. In the first instance, we would like to obtain diverse structures affected by different halide anions, but the result of experimentation proved that different halide anions had no obvious in- fluence on the structures. By comparison, their struc- tures are almost similar with that of [Cu2(bpy)X2]n, while have distinct difference with the structure of [Cu(bpy)X]n (X＝Cl, Br, I).8-11 Figure 1 Illustration for two-dimensional sheet of [Cu2(bpe)Cl2]n.

KGaA, Weinheim In complexes 1 and 3, there are ligand unsupported Cu(I)—Cu(I) bonding interactions with the distances of 0.2968(10) nm for 1 and 0.2818(2) nm for 3,9 which are close to those in complex Cu2(obpy)2 (Hobpy＝6-hy- droxyl-2,2'-bipyridyl; Cu—Cu, 0.2986 and 0.2993 nm),17 and are shorter than those in complexes [Cu3(pzc)2- (CN)2(H2O)2•2H2O]n (pzc ＝pyrazinecarboxylic acid; Cu—Cu, 0.3051 nm) and Cu2(ophen)2 (Hophen＝2-hy- droxyl-1,10-phenanthroline; Cu—Cu, 0.3375 nm).18,19 It can be concluded that complex 2 is isomorphic with complexes 1 and 3 because the IR spectra for these three complexes are complete homology and the ele- mental anlyses indicate that they have uniform formulas. Compared with the spectrum of free bpe ligand, strong peaks appearing at 1600 and 1422 cm －1 in the com- plexes can be attributed to asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of C＝N, which is evidence of bpe ligand binding to copper atom. Three strong peaks located at 973, 823, 543 cm －1 were assigned to stretching and out-of-plane deformations of H atoms of bpe skeleton. Thermalgravimetric analysis Thermalgravimetric analyses (TG-DTG) for the three complexes were performed from 25 to 1000 ℃ at a heating rate of 10 ℃•min －1 under air atmosphere. As can be seen from Figure 2, the decomposition process of complex 1 started at about 300 to 849 ℃ with a marked mass loss of 58.31%, corresponding to the loss of the bpe ligand and the oxidation of copper(I) cation to CuO, with the calculated weight loss of 58.16%. Figure 2 TG-DTG curves for complex 1. For complex 2, the decomposition process is similar to that of the complex 1 with one marked weight loss of 66.00% which occurred in about 320—781 ℃ with the residue CuO, as shown in Figure 3. The value is consis- tent with the calculated mass loss of 66.10%. As shown in Figure 4, the TGA curves for complex 3 can be divided into two obvious stages. In the first stage, the skeleton of the complex collapses in 320— 542 ℃, corresponding to the removal of bpe ligand and the formation of CuI, accompanying a loss of 33.08 % (calculated loss: 32.36%). In the second stage from 542 to 800℃, CuI is transformed to CuO with a residue amount of 28.75% (calculated value: 28.25%). Figure 3 TG-DTG curves for complex 2. Figure 4 TG-DTG curves for complex 3. In the TGA curves, the thermodecomposition proc- ess of the complexes 1 and 2 exhibit the slight differ- ence with that of the complex 3, which may be attrib- uted to the stability of the intermediate product CuI.
