Two novel d10 metal coordination polymers [Cd2(Hmna)4]n (1), [Zn2(ddca)2 (dpe)]n·nH2O (2) (H2mna = 6-mercaptonicotinic acid, H2ddca = 6,6’-dithiodinicotinic acid, dpe = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethyl- ene), were hydrothermally synthesized and characterized by single- crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 1 is a cyclic double chain struc- ture containing 16-number and 32-number circles with (Hmna)– li- gands as bridges, in which the starting H2ddca reagent was unprece- dentedly converted into H2mna ligands via in situ cleavage of S–S Introduction The fine-tuning design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has achieved considerable progress over the past decade, because controlling the molecular organization in the solid state can lead to materials with novel structure and promising properties.[1] According to previous literature, the construction of MOFs mainly depends on the nature of the organic ligands (spacers) and metal ions (nodes).[2] Especially organic ligands play crucial roles for the designed synthesis of some interesting coordination networks, such as the donating type, the flexibility, and the geometry of the organic ligands.[3] Among various organic ligands, many rigid polycarboxylate ligands have been extensively used as multifunctional tectons, due to their extension ability both in covalent bonding and in supramolecular interactions (H-bonding and aromatic stack- ing).[4] However, in contrast to rigid carboxylates, the use of flexible carboxylate ligands has been reported infrequently.[5] Because the flexible ligands can have different conformations when they react with metal salts, and thus can form metal com- plexes with great structural diversity. As a building block to construct coordination polymers, 6,6’-dithiodinicotinic acid (H2ddca) is a quite versatile ligand for construction of novel metal-organic frameworks, which has not only has hard-only (carboxylate-O) but also has soft-only (pyridine-N) donor sets presenting versatile coordination * Prof. Dr. X.-L.

In compound 2, two five-coordinate zinc centers are connected with carboxylate groups of H2ddca ligands to give a binuclear [Zn2(CO2)4] unit, which are linked by dpe ligands to form a 2D network structure. It is worth noting that compound 2 displays a twofold 2D+2D parallel interpen- etration framework containing a polyrotaxane-like motif. In addition, the thermal stablities and photoluminescence properties of compounds 1 and 2 were also studied. modes to connect metal ions into variable structures with dif- ferent topologies and dimensions constructer. Moreover, the flexible disulfide derivatives bearing S–S spacers can afford more rich structure information compared with rigid ligands.[6] Another noteworthy point for this ligand is not only do such disulfide derivatives act as the organic bridging “spacer” to create interesting structures when combined with metal ions, but also the facile cleavage of the central S–S bond can result in diversiform in situ ligand reactions under different reaction conditions.[6a] And the bridging sulfu atom has coordination ability, which may lead to a unique network structure because of its bonding ability to soft metal ions.[6b] Therefore, it is considered that various metal complexes can be obtained by reactions of H2ddca with varied metal salts. However, the co- ordination chemistry and structural properties of metal poly- mers based on H2ddca ligand have been documented rarely to date.[7] With the aim of understanding the coordination chem- istry of this versatile ligand and preparing new materials with interesting structural topologies and excellent physical proper- ties, we have recently engaged in the research of this kind of complexes. Now two novel metal coordination polymers were hydrothermal synthesized successfully, namely, [Cd2(Hmna)4]n (1), [Zn2(ddca)2(dpe)]n·nH2O (2). Herein are described the syntheses, structures, thermal and luminescent properties of two novel metal–organic coordination polymers.

Complex 1 was successfully obtained from the hydrothermal reaction of H2ddca and cadmium ion at 160 °C where the starting H2ddca ligand can be converted into a functional (Hmna)– ligand characteristic of mixed nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur donors. The successful isolation of 1 with a sulfur bridging mode prompted us to extend our study to other complexes based on (Hmna)– ligands. Thus, we changed Cd(NO3)2 in 1 to Zn(CH3COO)2, Zn(NO3)2 in an attempt to assembly the new structure. Unexpectedly, uncharacterized precipitates were obtained under the same hydrothermal reac- tion conditions. A phase equilibrium of a multicomponent sys- tem is formed at certain temperature and pressure. Many meta- stable phases exist at hydrothermal conditions and some meta- stable components may be crystallized. Complex 2 was synthe- sizes using the same metal/ligand/ ratios and pH value as 1 under different hydrothermal synthesis temperature. But the cleavage of the central S–S bond of H2ddca ligand was not happened in 2. In order to investigated the reason of the S–S bond cleavage in the H2ddca ligand, the direct reactions of metal (CdII) salts with H2ddca ligand and metal(CdII) salts, H2ddca ligand with second ligands, such as 4,4-bpy and dpe ligands under the same hydrothermal condition were carried out, respectively. But the identical products to complex 1 were obtained. The results indicates that the main reason of the S–S bond cleavage in the H2ddca ligand is the high tempera- ture, pressure and long-time reactions may facilitate the in situ synthesis of H2mna in 1.[7b] In addition, the different metal ions may be correlated to the formation of final products. The IR spectra of compounds 1 and 2 show the characteristic bands of the (Hmna)– or (ddca)2– ligands at 1574–1605 cm–1 for the asymmetric vibration and at 1392–1431 cm–1 for the sym- metric vibration and the broad bands of water at 3433 cm–1. The absence of the absorption bands at 1730–1690 cm–1 in 1 and 2 indicates the ligand adopts the complete deprotonated (Hmna)– and (ddca)2– form, which is consistent with the X-ray structural analysis. Structural Analysis of [Cd2(Hmna)4]n (1) X-ray crystallography reveals that complex 1 crystallizes in triclinic, space group P1¯ and the asymmetric unit consists of one CdII atom, two (Hmna)– ligands as shown in Figure 1. The (Hmna)– ligand come from in situ H2ddca molecule during the hydrothermal synthesis reaction. Each CdII atom is six coordi- nated by two sulfur atoms from two (Hmna)– ligands [Cd1– S1A = 2.582(3), Cd1–S2A = 2.537(2) Å] and four oxygen atoms from two chelating carboxylate groups of two (Hmna)– ligands. The Cd–O distances fall in the range of 2.213(6)– 2.615(7) Å similar to those found in the other cadmium carb- oxylate coordination polymers.[8] The Cd1 is located in dis- torted [CdO4S2] octahedral coordination environments. Four carboxylate oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3) and a terminal sulfur atom (S2A) of (Hmna)– ligands constitute the basal plane of the octahedrons, while the two polar sites are completed by two atoms (O4, S1A). www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2013, 403–408 404 Figure 1. Coordination environment around the CdII ion in 1, all hy- drogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Interestingly, the (Hmna)– ligand assume bridging mono- dentate/chelating bidentate fashion (Scheme 1a). Based on the connection mode, each pair of CdII atoms are bridged by two (Hmna)– ions to form a {Cd2O2C8N2S2} 16-numbered circle with the Cd···Cd distance of 9.229 Å. The adjacent dimeric Cd2 units are linked by two sulfur atoms and two carboxylate groups of two (Hmna)– ligands generating a 1D cyclic double chain running along the a axis (Figure 2), thus forming a novel {Cd4O4C16N4S4} 32-membered ring containing a type of pore with size of ca. 9.956 Å  15.888 Å based on the distances of Cd1···Cd1. The neighboring cyclic double chain recognize each other to generate a 2D bilayer supramolecular network via hydrogen bonding interactions [N1–H1···O2, 2.732(5) Å, 160.6°; N2–H2···O4, 2.799(5) Å, 158.8°; C5–H5···O3, 2.435(5) Å, 174.28°; C3–H3···S1 = 2.795 Å, 164.03°; C9– H9···S2 = 2.857 Å, 162.72°] along the b axis (Figure 3). Then 2D bilayer supramolecular network are found to pack on top of each other, displaying a slipped geometry stabilized through C–H···S hydrogen bonds interactions [C8–H8···S2 = 2.936 Å, 155.97°], which is further extended into a 3D supramolecular structure (Figure 4).

It is worth to noting that although H2ddca ligand was used as the original organic reagent in the preparation of the title Two Zn/Cd Coordination Polymers with Flexible Disulfide Carboxylate Derivatives Figure 3.

View of the 3D supramolecular architecture constructed by hydrogen bonding interactions. complex, H2ddca ligand was not unexpectedly found in the final product, which indicates (Hmna)– ligand in 1 came from the in situ the facile cleavage of the central S–S bond of H2ddca ligand under different reaction temperature. Although several cases of hydro(solvo)thermal cleavage of the central S–S bond of a single carboxyl group from carboxylic acids have been reported in reactions involving CuI and CuII, but which is very rare in CdII complexes.[7b] Especially, the (Hmna)– ligand assume bridging monodentate/chelating biden- tate fashion (Scheme 1a), which have never been described be- fore in the metal complexes with the (Hmna)– ligand. Structural Analysis of [Zn2(ddca)2(dpe)]n·nH2O (2) Complex 2 displays a twofold 2D+2D parallel interpen- etration network containing a polyrotaxane-like motif. The asymmetric unit of 2 is made up of one unique ZnII atom, one ddca ligand and a half bpe ligand as well as half lattice water molecules. In 2, the ZnII atom adopts a five-coordinate mode with a distorted square pyramidal arrangement (Figure 5). Each ZnII atom is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four monodentate carboxylate groups of four (ddca)2– ligands in the equatorial plane and one nitrogen atom [Zn1–N1 = 2.025(2) Å] from one dpe ligand occupying the axial position. The Zn–O distances fall in the range of 2.028(2)–2.112(2) Å, which is in good agreement with previous studies.[9] Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2013, 403–408 © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 405 Figure 5. The coordination environment of the ZnII ion in 2, all hydro- gen atoms are omitted for clarity. In 2, the H2ddca molecules are completely deprotonated and are largely bent at the C–S–S bond site. The torsion angle of the ddca molecule (C–S–S–C) is 84.31°, and the dihedral angle of two pyridine rings is 84.21°. Two ZnII atoms are bridged by four carboxylates in a bis(bridging-bidentate) fashion (Scheme 1b) to give a paddle-wheel shaped unit with the Zn···Zn distance of 2.953(2) Å. The bimetallic ZnII units are linked by the (ddca)2– ligands to form a 1D ring chain, in which (ddca)2– ligands first connect ZnII atoms to form a [Zn4(ddca)2] metallocyclic motif (Figure 6). Further, these ring chain are connected through the coordination of nitrogen atoms of bpe ligands, forming a 2D layer, in which four Zn1 centers are joined by two dpe ligands and two (ddca)2– ligands to form a 52-membered [Zn4N8O4S4C32] ring (Figure 7). More re- markably, due to the flexible conformation of H2ddca, the dpe ligands of a 2D network pass through [Zn4(ddca)2] units ring from different networks and penetrated by each other to result in a unique polyrotaxane-like pattern (Figure 8). The 2D inter- penetrate framework are found displaying a slipped geometry to stabilize the 2D layer structure. Figure 6. Perspective view of the 1D ring chain along the a-axis. Thermal Properties and XRPD Measurements of Complexes 1 and 2 To identify the thermal stabilities of these complexes, the TGA measurements were carried out (Figure S1). The TGA result indicates that 1 does not decompose up to 240 °C. The total weight loss of 66.2% occurs between 240 °C and 445 °C, is consistent with the weight loss of (Hmna)– ligands. The re- maining weight of 34.1% is cadmium oxide that is in agree- ment with the calculated value of 33.8%. 2 first lost its lattice water molecule below 165 °C, the weight loss found of 1.8% was in agreement with the calculated one (1.9%).

The TGA results show that 2 have good thermal stability at high temperature because of its com- plex structure. In order to confirm the phase purity of the bulk materials, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) experiments were carried out on complexes 1 and 2. The XRPD experimental and com- puter-simulated patterns of all of them are shown in Figure S2. Although minor differences can be seen in the positions, intensities, and widths of some peaks, it can also be considered that the as synthesized materials are homogeneous. Luminescent Properties of Complexes 1 and 2 Taking into account the excellent luminescent properties of d10 metal complexes, the luminescence of 1 and 2 and free ligand were investigated (Figure 9). The ligand exhibits two emission bands at 393 nm and 451 nm upon excitation at 320 nm. It was found that strong emissions occur at around 571 nm and 568 nm upon excitation under λex = 433 nm (for 1) and 498 nm (for 2), as shown in Figure 9. The emission bands for 1–2 may be due to σ-donation from the carboxylate ligands to the CdII or ZnII atoms and are tentatively attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT).[10] By comparing the emission spectra of 1 and 2 and ligand, we can conclude that the enhancement of luminescence in 1 and 2 may be attributed to the ligation of ligand to the metal center, which effectively increases the rigidity and reduces the loss of energy by radia- tionless decay.[11] The luminescence properties of these metal organic compounds indicate that they may be excellent candi- dates for potential photoluminescent materials. www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Conclusions In summary, the coordination chemistry of 6,6’-dithiodinic- otinic acid (H2ddca) with transition metal salt (Cd and Zn) was investigated. 1 is a 1D a cyclic double chain structure contain- ing 16-number and 32-number circles with (Hmna)– ligands as bridges. It is noteworthy that (Hmna)– ligand in 1 comes from the in situ the facile cleavage of the central S–S bond of H2ddca ligand under different reaction temperature. While 2 displays a twofold parallel interpenetration framework contain- ing a polyrotaxane-like motif.
