Höller,[a] Philipp Matthes,[a] Jens Beckmann,[b] and Klaus Müller-Buschbaum*[a] Dedicated to Professor Hans-Jörg Deiseroth on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday Keywords: Lanthanum; Metal-organic frameworks; Ln–N-MOFs; Reversibility; 4,4'-Bipyridine Abstract. Construction of the framework structure 3 ∞[La2Cl6(bipy)5]· 4bipy (1), bipy = 4,4'-bipyridine, C10H8N2, is achieved by reaction of the anhydrous halide LaCl3 with molten 4,4'-bipyridine. Five equiva- lents of bipyridine are used for the framework construction linking LaCl3 units to give an extended, three-dimensional MOF. Furthermore, four additional equivalents of bipyridine per LaCl3 unit are incorpo- rated within the crystalline MOF, which is thereby completely filled with bipy molecules. This compound formation results in the extraordi- Introduction Usually, the construction of MOFs is described as an in- tended one way reaction of metal salts and complexes with a suitable linker to give a multi-dimensional framework structure [1–6]. The way back and thereby decomposition of the MOF structures is fairly unwanted. This includes the N ligand con- taining Ln–N-MOFs we have elaborated from ligand melts [7]. Nonetheless decomposition is a prominent feature of all sol- vent containing MOFs that enforce a thermal activation in or- der to gain porous materials by evaporation of incorporated solvate ligands [8–10]. As collapse of the referring frameworks is likely for highly solvent containing MOFs it is also limiting the interest in such materials. We discovered for the series of two-dimensional 4,4'-bipyridine containing Ln–N-MOFs of the formula 2 ∞[Ln2Cl6(bipy)3]·2bipy, with Ln = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, bipy = 4,4'-bipyridine (C10H8N2, see Scheme 1) [11] that their formation is thermally reversible.

Further heating of the MOFs results in a stepwise release of all nine equivalents of bipyridine and reformation of the anhydrous chloride at 425 °C. Formation and disassembly can be run in cycles and are re- versible. Thus two interesting yet opposing aspects are the reversible construction and disassembly of the MOF framework. MOFs and disassembly into the reagents can be directed de- pending on the temperature. We now found that the number of equivalents that are reversibly incorporated in LnX3 can be fur- ther increased for lanthanum up to nine equivalents per for- mula unit including the reversible character of the reactions. Accordingly, formation and disassembly reactions of MOFs can be equally interesting for such a high and reversible ligand uptake in anhydrous halides of the rare earth elements. Scheme 1. The amine ligand 4,4'-bipyridine. Experimental Section All manipulations were carried out under inert atmospheric conditions using glove box, ampoule as well as vacuum line techniques. Heating furnaces were equipped with Al2O3 tubes and EUROTHERM 2416 control elements. For 3 ∞[La2Cl6(bipy)5]·4bipy (1), the trichloride LaCl3, was prepared according to the known ammonium halide route [12] using the oxide La2O3 (ChemPur, 99.9 %), HCl solution (10 mol·l–1, reagent grade) and ammonium chloride (Fluka, 99.5 %), and purified by decomposition of the trivalent ammonium chlorides under vacuum and subsequent sublimation of the products. 4,4'-bipyridine (ACROS, 98 %) was used as purchased. All products are air and moisture sensi- tive. The IR spectra were recorded using a BRUKER FTIR-IS66V-S spectrometer. KBr pellets for Mid IR investigation and PE pellets for Far IR were used under vacuum. Only the crystalline product was C. J. Höller, P. Matthes, J. Beckmann, K. Müller-Buschbaum ARTICLE used for micro analyses on a Vario Microcube (Elementar) elemental analyzer. The yield of the reaction was calculated according to the amount of ligand used for the synthesis. For thermal analysis the bulk product of 3 ∞[La2Cl6(4,4'-bipy)5]·4(4,4'-bipy) was studied using simulta- neous DTA/TG (TG-DTA92 Setaram). 17,5 mg of 3 ∞[La2Cl6(4,4'- bipy)5]·4(4,4'-bipy) were heated from 25 °C to 700 °C in a constant helium flow of 50ml·min–1 with a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1. Synthesis of 3 ∞[La2Cl6(bipy)5]·4bipy LaCl3 (0.25 mmol, 62 mg) and 4,4'-bipyridine (bipy, 1.25 mmol, 195 mg) were sealed in an evacuated DURANTM glass ampoule and heated to 90 °C in 7 h and then to 120 °C within 30 h. The temperature was held for 48 h and afterwards cooled to 95 °C in 250 h and finally to room temperature in further 14 h. The reaction resulted in high reflecting colorless crystals of the product and an amount of unreacted LaCl3 in the bulk. Yield: 199 mg = 84 %. Anal. calcd.

Studies concerning the reversibility of formation and disassembly of the framework compound were performed with the same amounts of the reagents but shortened in annealing and reaction times for each step. Only one tenth annealing (24 h) and the half reaction time (24 h) were applied. Therefore, no complete reaction occurred and the crystal- linity degrades. These conditions were chosen in order to keep a rea- sonable timeframe for multiple repetitions. Therefore an amount of 25 % of unreacted halide LaCl3 remains. Table 1.

Chem. 2010, 395–399 Crystal Structure Determination The best suitable single crystal of the compound 3 ∞[La2Cl6(4,4'- bipy)5]·4(4,4'-bipy) (1) was selected for single-crystal X-ray investiga- tion under glovebox conditions and sealed in a glass capillary. Data collection was carried out on a STOE IPDS-II diffractometer (Mo-Kα radiation λ = 0.7107 Å) at 170 K. The structure was determined using direct methods [13]. All non hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropi- cally by least-squares techniques [14]. All hydrogen positions were calculated into pre-set positions adjusting their thermal parameters to 1.2 of the referring carbon atoms. The compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1¯. Because of the free rotation of the pyridine rings in 4,4'-bipyridine one incorporated bipy molecule is disordered (see Supporting Information). Integrity of symmetry and extinction were checked and no higher symmetry could be found [15]. A numeri- cal absorption correction was applied [16]. For crystallographic data see Table 1.

Results and Discussion Reversible Formation and High Ligand Uptake We elaborated that the use of melts of organic ligands like N-heterocyclic amines is a suitable alternative to solvent treat- ments if co-coordination of the solvent is to be avoided [17]. Depending on the ligands used and the reaction conditions a large structural variety ranging from small molecular com- plexes [17a, 18] to coordination polymers and MOFs [19] can be obtained. The ligand melt can be directly used for oxidizing reactive metals like the lanthanides acting as weak N–H acids using various activation methods for the metals [17a, 20]. The method can also be used for other ligands like phenols [21] or thioles [22] to yield amides, phenolates and thiolates of the rare earth elements together with hydrogen gas. It can be fur- ther expanded to ligands that cannot be utilized in a redox reaction. Instead of metals, we successfully used anhydrous halides of the rare earth elements to yield nitriles [23] of the lanthanides including the first dinitrile Ln–N-MOFs of the re- ferring elements [24, 25]. Accordingly, the 4,4'-bipyridine li- gand that has been used for MOF constructions of transition metals already [26–28] was most promising for our synthesis strategy together with lanthanide halides. 4,4'-bipyridine acts as chemical scissors and cuts down the halide structure. It also controls the formation of coordination polymers by interlink- ing LnCl3 units. For numerous lanthanides this can lead to 2D- nets of the formula 2 ∞[Ln2Cl6(bipy)3]·2bipy, with Ln = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, [11]. In addition to three interlinking ligands per two LnCl3 units, two equivalents of bipy are incorporated in cavities within and in between the sheets. For the larger trivalent ion La3+ we now found that an extraordinary increase in the 4,4'-bipyridine uptake is observed according to the reac- tion [Equation (1)]: 2 LaCl3 + 9 C10H8N2 C10H8N2 melt 120 °C → 3 ∞[La2Cl6(C10H8N2)5]·4(C10H8N2) (1) At temperatures starting from 155 °C the MOF begins to release the incorporated bipyridine equivalents in three steps. MOF Formation vs. Reversible High Ligand Uptake in Anhydrous Halides Removal of the template bipyridine is in principle possible by evaporation, as thermal investigations reveal. But as this does not lead to suitable crystals, it has yet not been possible to refine the structure of this new template free high temperature compound. At temperatures between 330–425 °C also the link- ing bipyridine equivalents are released in two steps under re- formation of LaCl3 [Equation (2)], as observed by simultane- ous DTA/TG (see Figure 1): Figure 1. Simultaneous DTA/TG of 3 ∞[La2Cl6(bipy)5]·4bipy (1) reveals a five step release of 4,4'-bipyridine from the framework. The first three signals correspond to intercalated bipy equivalents; the forth and fifth signal above 350 °C indicate the framework disassembly and ref- ormation of the reagents. 3 ∞[La2Cl6(C10H8N2)5]·4(C10H8N2)155–425 °C→2 LaCl3 + 9 C10H8N2 ↑(2) If the bipy equivalents released from the MOF are recovered, the formation reaction can be started over. Thus formation and disassembly of the framework are reversible. Formation and disassembly can be run in cycles as powder diffraction indi- cates, (see Figure 2) [29]. Some unreacted LaCl3 in the product pattern originates from incomplete reaction because of shorter reaction and annealing times, which had to be chosen in order to allow multiple reversible processes in a reasonable time- frame. Reversibility is further supported by IR spectroscopy. Mid IR spectra of the product contain bands that can be identi- fied with the ν(C–N) stretching modes. They are shifted to smaller wave numbers compared to the free ligand because of binding to the metal ions and thus weakening of the C–N bonds at 1011 cm–1. The ν(C=N) ring vibrations of the uncoor- dinated 4,4'-bipyridine are observed at 1591 cm–1. Further- more, the Far IR spectra of framework 1 contain bands that indicate ν(Ln–N) stretching modes between 236–214 cm–1 [30]. Only the Ln–Cl stretching and deformation bands at 571 and 474 cm–1 [31] are found after disassembly. That leads us to describing the compound presented here with two equally interesting features: As the first feature a MOF structure is formed that is able to incorporate a large number of additional bipy equivalents as well as these incorpo- rated molecules can all be thermally released. Moreover, as the linking bipyridine equivalents can also be released reversibly, another interesting point can be raised as the second feature: Z. Anorg. Allg.

Both reactions can be run in cycles as the repetitions of patterns indicate (Mo-Kα1 radiation, λ = 0.7107 Å). Anhydrous halides LnX3 can show an extraordinary high up- take of the organic ligand 4,4'-bipyridine with formation of N- donor complexes as thermal intermediates and re-formation of the halides at suitable temperatures. Crystal Structure The crystal structure of 3 ∞[La2Cl6(bipy)5]·4bipy (1), bipy = 4,4'-bipyridine, C10H8N2, constitutes to a three-dimensional framework. It is built up by trivalent lanthanum ions linked by 4,4'-bipyridine ligands and chloride ions. 3 ∞[La2Cl6(bipy)5]· 4bipy exhibit a CN of eight consisting of three halide atoms each as well as two additional nitrogen atoms, resulting in a Figure 3.

Müller-Buschbaum ARTICLE double nitrogen capped trigonal prism around lanthanum. Three bipyridine ligands coordinate rather symmetrically μ-η1:η 1 to two different lanthanide cations with each nitrogen atom of the pyridine rings. The double capping nitrogen atoms exhibit an N–La–N angle of 135.7(2)° (ideal 120°). A fourth bipyridine molecule coordinates end-on η1 to only one lantha- nide ion. Four chloride ions complete the coordination sphere of every lanthanide atom (see Figure 3, for selected intera- tomic distances and angles see Table 2). Edge sharing of the double capped trigonal prisms leads to the formation of a three-dimensional framework. The CN of lanthanum in 1 is higher than for the series of lanthanides of the formula 2 ∞[Ln2Cl6(bipy)3]·2bipy, with Ln = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb [11], which exhibit pentagonal-bipyramidal coordination. This cor- roborates the fact that La3+ is the largest of the Ln3+ ions [32]. Double capped trigonal prisms around lanthanum atoms can also be found in La3OCl[AsO3]2 as well as in [La2(aib)4(H2O)8](ClO4)6 (aib = α-aminoisobutyric acid) [33, 34], although the most numerous coordination polyhedron for La3+ with CN eight is the square antiprism, especially regard- ing nitrogen coordination [35]. The La–N distances in 1 range from 274.9(4) to 281.8(4) pm. Because of the large La3+-ion and the high coordination number of eight, the La–N distances are about 20 pm larger than the ones e.g. found for 2 ∞[Sm2Cl6(bipy)3]·2bipy of 258–263 pm [11]. In 3 ∞[La2Cl6(bipy)5]·4bipy two of the chloride ions also link be- tween different lanthanide ions forming a “double bridge” [36]. The La–Cl distances range from 276.0(2) to 296.4(2) pm and match with the trichloride [37]. Figure 4 depicts the crystal structure of 1. Table 2.

As the linkage leads to a complicated crystal structure, it is reasonable to reduce it to a topological description. 3 ∞[La2Cl6(bipy)5]·4bipy can be identified with two perpendicu- lar 2D-nets that each have a 6,3 topology. Viz., three sixfold bridged rings form a 2D-layer. This gives an overall 3D (6,4) topology (see Figure 5). This topology is e.g. also found for MOFs like Co(Im)2 (Im– = N2C3H3, imidazolate) or [Eu(pdc)1,5(dmf)]·dmf·(H2O)0.5 (pdc2– = pyridine-3,5-dicarbox- ylate, dmf = dimethylformamid) [38, 39]. The topology de- scription however is based on counting the chloride “double- bridges” as one bridge only. Otherwise the connectivity would be five. 398 www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2010, 395–399 Figure 4.
