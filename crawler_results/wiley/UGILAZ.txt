This paper reports the first systemic investigation on the bimetallic ring coordination polymers based on two structure-related flexible bis(imidazole) ligands, bimb as well as bix [bimb = 1,4-bis(im- idazol-1-yl)-butane, bix = 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl-methylene)-benzene)]. As expected, six new cobalt complexes were generated, namely, [Co2(SCN)4(bimb)2] (1), [Co2(L1)2(bimb)2Cl2] (2), [Co2(L2)4(bix)2] (3), [Co(SCN)2(bimb)2] (4), {Co[N(CN)2]2(bimb)2} (5), and [Co(L3) (bix)] (6) (HL1 = 4-aminobenzoic acid, HL2 = 4-nitrobenzoic acid, and H2L3 = succinic acid). The structures of 1–3 are three discrete dinu- clear ring motifs. Especially, 1 is the first example of 1D pseudo- Introduction During the past decades, much attention has been focused on the formation of bimetallic ring, because there are many promising organometallic fragments available for the construc- tion of novel supramolecular materials.[1] For the design of such compounds, the most common approach is the rational combination of organic ligands bearing coordination sites and metal cations. Up to now, many bismonodentate ligands, such as bis(pyridine), bis(triazole), or bis(benzimidazole) intercon- nected by rigid or flexible spacers, have been shown to form a variety of bimetallic ring structures.[2] However, when using structurally flexible bis(imidazole) ligands, such as bimb [1,4- bis(imidazol-1-yl)-butane] and bix [1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl- methylene)-benzene], relying on the conformation of the con- necting spacer, either discrete macrocyclic or infinite poly- meric structures may be expected to form.[3,4] Careful inspec- tion of the reported cases, we found that these ligands concep- tually have two configurations: trans and cis as shown in Scheme 1.[3a] When two imidazole rings rotate in the opposite sides compared to the plane of benzene ring or methylene skel- eton, a trans conformation presents. On the contrary, when two imidazole rings rotate on the same sides, a cis conformation displays. Apparently, the trans configuration prefers to form * Dr. Y. Wang E-Mail: wangyue@qdu.edu.cn * Dr. Y.

In 6, the discrete dinuclear ring motifs, traversed by μ2-η3-chelating L3 anions, are interconnected by another μ2-η1-bridging L3 anions to form 2D (4,4) network. The for- mation of these compounds should be undoubtedly attributed to the preference for cis-bis(imidazole) ligands crystallization resulting in various ring architectures. In addition, compound 6 exhibits antiferro- magnetic behavior. metal-organic polymers, while the cis one prefers metallacyclic frameworks when it reacts with metal ions.[5] Consequently, it is still a challenge to construct metallacyclic coordination architectures via flexible bis(imidazole) ligands. These facts stimulated us to sequentially observe the cis configuration with the desire to achieve a bimetallic ring structure in experiment. Scheme 1. In this paper, we first systemically make an investigation on the bimetallic ring coordination tectonics via linking cobalt(II) cations with flexible bis(imidazole) ligands. As expected, six new compounds were successfully isolated via hydrothermal reaction of different cobalt salts and bis(imidazole) ligands: [Co2(SCN)4(bimb)2] (1), [Co2(L1)2(bimb)2Cl2] (2), [Co2(L2)4- (bix)2] (3), [Co(SCN)2(bimb)2] (4), {Co[N(CN)2]2(bimb)2} (5), and [Co(L3)(bix)] (6) [bimb = 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl)-bu- tane, bix = 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl-methylene)-benzene, HL1 = 4-aminobenzoic acid, HL2 = 4-nitrobenzoic acid and H2L3 = succinic acid], which exhibit diverse oligomeric or polymeric networks consisting of discrete dimer, one- or two-dimensional structures. The common salient feature of these compounds is that the bis(imidazole) ligands adopt cis conformation. All Y. Wang, Y. Qi ARTICLE compounds are characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectra, and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of these com- pounds and the systematic investigation of the effect of the conformation of bis(imidazole) spacer as well as the ratio of cobalt ions and ligands on the ultimate frameworks, are be represented and discussed. Moreover, the magnetic properties for 6 are discussed in detail. Results and Discussion Synthesis Because the mixing of cobalt salt and bimb or bix solution usually leads to a precipitation, making it difficult to grow crystals of complexes, the crystals of all complexes were ob- tained under hydrothermal conditions. With a 1:2:1 molar ratio of CoCl2·6H2O:NH4SCN:bimb, crystals of 1 were isolated. When the molar ratio was replaced by 1:2:2, crystals of 4 were obtained as expected. This indicates that the ratio of metal ions and organic ligands sometimes play an important role on the final products. A 1:2 product with discrete dinuclear ring structure would be expected with 1:2 molar ratio of CoCl2·6H2O:HL1, however, in the isolated crystals of 2 only one Cl– anion was replaced by L1 anion. This may be due to the solubility of such complex is facile to crystallize from the solution. However, other compounds are not sensitive to the ligand-to-metal reactant ratio. In addition, the synthesis of compounds 2, 3, and 6 depends on the pH value of the solu- tion. We performed parallel experiments at pH = 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. At pH  7, no crystals were observed, while at pH  6, a little mount of crystals with poor quality were obtained. Thus, the pH value of 6.0 seems to be appropriate to synthesize such compounds. This suggests that the crystallization and growth are sensitive to acidity/basicity of the reaction system. Descriptions of the Structures [Co2(SCN)4(bimb)2] (1) X-ray crystallographic analysis provides direct evidence of Co2(bimb)2 bimetallic ring structure of complex 1, as shown in Figure 1a. Each CoII atom exhibits a tetrahedral (CoN4) co- ordination environment with four nitrogen atoms from two bimb ligands and two NCS– groups, respectively. The Co–N bond lengths vary from 1.939(3) to 1.992(3) Å, comparing to corresponding bond lengths found in the literature.[6] It should be noted that bimb ligands exhibit cis configuration, with a pair of imidazole groups inclined by 54.96°. Two bimb ligands connect two CoII atoms to achieve a 22-numbered Co2- (bimb)2 ring and the NCS– groups occupy terminal positions. The Co···Co separation across bimb ligands is 9.937 Å. A re- markable feature of the complex 1 is that there are strong S···S interactions involved in the stabilization of crystal lattice. The S···S distance of 3.253 Å between two adjacent Co2(bimb)2 ring along the b axis is much shorter than that observed in many other complexes for which S···S interactions are un- disputed.[7] This indicates strong S···S contact. Thus, the www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2014, 2609–2615 2610 Co2(bimb)2 rings are joined together by such S···S interactions to lead to the formation of an infinite 1D chain. Strikingly, two of these 1D chains interpenetrate each other, with each ring section of one chain penetrated by a S···S “bond” of each chain, to form a 1D pseudo-polyrotaxane as illustrated in Fig- ure 1b. To the best of our knowledge, 1 is the first example of 1D pseudo-polyrotaxane formed by S···S interactions based on bis(imidazole) ligands. Figure 1. (a) Cobalt coordination environment with major atom num- bering scheme in 1 showing 22-numbered Co2(bimb)2 unit. (b) 1D pseudo-polyrotaxane formed by S···S interactions indicated by light dashed lines. [Co2(L1)2(bimb)2Cl2] (2) The discrete Co2(bimb)2 ring structure of compound 2, emphasizing the coordination environment around the central cobalt atom, is shown in Figure 2a. The central CoII1 and CoII2 atoms have identical distorted tetrahedral (CoN2OCl) coordination environments, both coordinated by one carb- oxylic oxygen atom from L1 ligand [Co–O = 1.963(2) Å and 1.9564(19) Å], one Cl– anion [Co–Cl = 2.2720(11) Å and 2.2734(12) Å] and two nitrogen atoms from two bimb ligands [Co–N = 2.005(2) Å to 2.017(2) Å]. In contrast of those in 1, two independent sets of bimb spacers (in which the C5/C5, C/C6, C15/C15, and C16/C16 atoms are disordered into two positions with a site occupation factor of 0.6717 and 0.3283, respectively) with different configurations are observed. One adopts cis conformation with a pair of imidazole groups in- clined by 78.73°, whereas the other adopts trans conformation with the dihedral angles of a pair of imidazole rings being 16.68°. They bridge two adjacent cobalt atoms to form a Co2(bimb)2 ring structure. The Co···Co separation across bimb ligands is longer than that in 1 (Co···Co = 10.673 Å), probably due to the trans conformation. In the crystal, the metallacycles exhibit two arrangements (A and B), which are interconnected by N–H···O hydrogen bonds (Table S2, Supporting Infor- mation) to form 3D supramolecular structures with tubular ar- rays (Figure 2b).

(b) A view of 3D supramolecular structure with tubular arrays by N–H···O indi- cated by light dashed lines. [Co2(L2)2(bix)2] (3) Compound 3 is also a bimetallic dimer although another flexible bis(imidazole) ligand, bix, was introduced instead of bimb, as shown in Figure 3. The CoII atoms exhibit (CoN2O2) tetrahedral environment with two nitrogen atoms from two bix ligands [Co–N = 2.008(4) and 2.012(4) Å] and two carboxylic oxygen atom from two L2 ligands [Co–O = 1.956(4) and 1.983(3) Å]. The bix ligands assume cis conformation and bridge two adjacent Co atoms with the distance of 10.784 Å. In fact, such bimetallic ring is often highly stable arrangement as a part of high-dimensional framework.[4] [Co(SCN)2(bimb)2] (4) and {Co[N(CN)2]2(bimb)2} (5) The X-ray crystallographic analyses show that the 4 and 5 are basically similar, although the space group of 4 is P21/c (which is isomorphous with [Ni(NCS)2(C10H14N4)2]),[8] whereas the space group of 5 is P1¯. Thus, all figures are based on compound 5. As shown in Figure 4a, each CoII atom is six- coordinate with four nitrogen atoms from four bimb ligands in the equatorial positions, and two nitrogen atoms from two SCN– anions for 4 and from two [N(CN)2]– anions for 5, respectively, at the axial positions. The Co–N bond lengths vary from 2.1288(12) Å to 2.1682(15) Å. Comparing to those Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2014, 2609–2615 © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 2611 Figure 3. Cobalt coordination environment with major atom number- ing scheme in 3 showing 26-numbered Co2(bix)2 unit. in 1, all bimb ligands exhibit cis configuration with a pair of imidazole groups inclined by 77.76° for 4 and 75.51° for 5, respectively, and link two adjacent Co atoms to form a 22- numbered Co2(bimb)2 ring with Co···Co distances 8.897 Å for 4 and 10.146 Å for 5. Due to the difference in the ratio of cobalt cations and bimb ligand from that in compound 1, the bimetallic rings of 4 and 5 are repeated to generate 1D double meso-helical chains. That is, the Co atoms and the bimb spa- cers on the each side of the Co···Co···Co chain form a single meso-helical chain along the a axis for 4 and along the b axis for 5. Figure 4.

(b) 1D single meso-helical chain in 5. Y. Wang, Y. Qi ARTICLE Figure 4b shows a separated meso-helical chain for 5. This kind of meso-helix may be originated from the cis conforma- tion of bimb spacers. The opposite double meso-helices are equally separated by the Co···Co···Co chain along the 1D struc- ture. Compared with those in the literatures, there are two re- markable traits in such double helix: (1) Double-strands chain structure constructed by bis(imidazole) ligands and metal salts is very common, while the double helical structure is rare.[9] (2) Most reported double or triple helices are composed of left- and right-handed helical chain, while in this paper two meso- helical chain are entangled with each other to generate a double-helical structure.[10] [Co(L3)(bix)] (6) Inspired by all mentioned above, such neutral Co2(bix)2 bi- metallic rings are good potential building blocks for formation of high-dimensional framework, if a suitable organic auxiliary ligands are introduced. Therefore, the dicarboxylate ligand, succinic acid (H2L3), was chosen. As expected, compound 6 is obtained. Each CoII atom exhibits a distorted octahedral (CoN2O4) coordination environment with four carboxylic oxy- gen atoms from three L3 anions in the equatorial sphere and two nitrogen atoms from two bix ligands at the apical positions (Figure 5a). The distances of Co–O range from 2.0384(12) Å to 2.2521(12) Å, and the distances of Co–N are 2.1389(14) Å and 2.1587(14) Å, respectively. Similar to those in 3, each bi- metallic ring is derived from two CoII and two bix units with the Co···Co separation of 8.861 Å, where the bix coordinates with a convergent cis conformation. The two unique L3 anions display two kinds of coordination modes, namely, μ2-η3-che- lating and μ2-η1-bridging modes.[11] It is noteworthy that the cavity of the macrocycle in 6 is traversed by one L3 anion in μ2-η3-chelating mode. Each bimetallic ring is further linked by another L3 anion in μ2-η1-bridging mode, aggregating the discrete macrocyclic units into 2D (4, 4) networks if we define the dinuclear unit Co2 as a node (Figure 5b). In such dinuclear unit, the Co···Co distance is 4.472 Å. This typical bimetallic ring has been observed in one polymeric complex with a re- lated organic dicarboxylic acid (fumaric acid),[11] [Cu2(fum)2- (L2)2(H2O)2]n, in which another fumaric anions bridge the metallacyles into 1D chain rather than 2D framework mainly due to the various modes of coordination of the carboxylato ligands. Magnetic Properties Taking into account the structure of these compounds, we can assume that the long bimb and bix bridging ligands do not couple the CoII cations or in a quasi-negligible strength. Thus, only the temperature-dependent molar magnetic susceptibility of compound 6 was investigated in a magnetic field of 500 Oe. The χM–1and χMT vs. T plots (2–300 K) of 6 are shown in Figure 6. At room temperature, the values of χMT are equal to 2.49 cm3·K·mol–1, which is greater than that expected for the spin-only one for a high-spin cobalt ion (1.88 cm3·K·mol–1 with g = 2.0). This is due to the occurrence of an unquenched www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2014, 2609–2615 2612 Figure 5.

The overall magnetic susceptibility data (2 K to 300 K) obey the Curie-Weiss law with a Weiss constant of –14.87 K and a Curie constant of 2.58 cm3· K·mol–1. The negative Weiss constant indicates the presence of antiferromagnetic interaction between the CoII ions. Conclusions Six new coordination polymers based on flexible bis(imida- zole) ligands were successfully isolated and structurally char- acterized. Our work further confirms that the resulting struc- tures were closely tied to the orientation of the nitrogen atoms of the flexible bis(imidazole) ligands and cis configuration pro- vides tendency to form [2+2] bimetallic ring, when coordi- nated to suitable metal cations. Moreover, the ligand-to-metal reactant ratio also plays an important role on the ultimate prod- ucts in this paper. Strikingly, such dinuclear metallic rings will be good candidates for building block to further form elegant high-dimensional MOFs in the presence of suitable auxiliary organic ligands. This endows us with a promising strategy for the synthesis of high-dimensional MOFs and the subject is cur- rently under investigation. Furthermore, this work will greatly advance our understanding of secondary noncovalent interac- tions (S···S week interactions and hydrogen bonding).
