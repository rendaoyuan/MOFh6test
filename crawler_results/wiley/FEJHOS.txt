Manuscript SHORT COMMUNICATION Two Novel Inorganic-Organic Hybrid Frameworks Based on InIII-BTC and InIII-BTEC Zheng-Zhong Lin,[a] Fei-Long Jiang,[a] Lian Chen,[a] Da-Qiang Yuan,[a] You-Fu Zhou,[a] and Mao-Chun Hong*[a] Keywords: Indium(iii) / Benzenemulticarboxylate Hydrothermal reactions of InCl3 with 1,3,5-benzenetri- carboxylic acid (H3BTC) or pyromellitic dianhydride pro- duced [In2(BTC)2(H2O)2]n·2nH2O (1) and [In2(H2BTEC)2- (OH)2]n·2nH2O (2), respectively (H4BTEC = 1,2,4,5-ben- zenetetracarboxylic acid). The structure of 1 is a 2D double- layer network, while that of 2 is a 3D framework constructed Introduction The development of organic-inorganic hybrid com- pounds constructed by the deliberate selection of metals and multifunctional exodentate ligands represents one of the most active research area in chemistry. The fascinating structures of these complexes together with their functional properties makes them highly prospective as a new class of materials.[14] 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid (H4BTEC) are two pro- mising ligands which provide high symmetry, diverse charge and a multi-connecting ability which has been applied in the design of hybrid complexes exploiting both the diversity of metal coordination geometries and weak intermolecular forces such as ππ interactions and hydrogen bonding. The rigid conformation and strong coordinating ability of the carboxylate groups bestows excellent thermal properties on the resultant hybrid complexes. The use of H3BTC and di- valent metal ions has led to the generation of products con- sisting 1D chains,[5,6] 2D layers[711] and 3D structural frameworks.[1216] H4BTEC is a building block that has been commonly adopted in the design of hybrids in connec- tion with transition[1721] and rare earth metal elements.[2224] In the search for a further class of hybrid materials we have introduced a trivalent metal, namely in- dium(iii), in order to investigate the influence of a change in the metal centre on the coordination architecture during the course of the assembly of the metal centres with H3BTC or H4BTEC. It was postulated that the incorporation of [a] State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fujian, Fuzhou, 350002, China Fax: (internat.) 86-591-3714946 E-mail: hmc@ms.fjirsm.ac.cn, zzlin@ms.fjirsm.ac.cn Eur.

Intense greenish- blue emissions at 494 nm (λex = 325 nm) for 1 and 489 nm (λex = 337 nm) for 2 were observed in the solid state. (© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2005) trivalent metal ions might create diverse structures different from those containing divalent metal ions because of the increased valence charge. Furthermore, compared with the systematic and extensive studies on MII-BTC complexes, re- ports of MIII-BTC complexes are rare.[25,26] Although some literature reports concerning MIII-BTEC complexes have re- cently appeared, the metal centres incorporated were mostly confined to the rare earth metal elements,[23,24] FeIII [27] or VIII.[28] There is a deficiency of the selection of the IIIA group elements as inorganic linkers. We addressed this situation by choosing InIII as the metal and a series of 3D InIII-BTC and 3D InIII-BTEC complexes with protonated pyridine or pyridine derivatives as templates and counter anions have been synthesised. Herein we describe a 2D double-layered InIII-BTC compound [In2(BTC)2- (H2O)2]n·2nH2O (1) and a 3D InIII-BTEC compound [In2(H2BTEC)2(OH)2]n·2nH2O (2) showing characteristic InIIIO4(OH)2 octahedral chains. Results and Discussion The formation of compounds 1 and 2 was found to be extremely sensitive to the pH value of the reaction mixture. Synthetic studies were carried out using pyridine as a basic reagent to adjust the pH value in the reaction system. In both systems, a pH value between 2 and 3 is an essential condition for the formation of 1 and 2. For the preparation of InIII-BTC, a pH value ranging from 3 to 4 produces a mixture of 1 and a 3D porous coordination polymeric com- pound.[29] Likewise, two phases (compound 2 and a 3D po- rous InIII-BTEC framework[30]) also crystallise concurrently from the reaction system of 2 when a pH value of 34 is maintained. In both reaction systems, more basic pH values led to predominant formation of the 3D porous by-prod- Z.-Z. Lin, F.-L. Jiang, L. Chen, D.-Q. Yuan, Y.-F. Zhou, M.-C. Hong SHORT COMMUNICATION ucts. Furthermore, when the reactions were carried out without pyridine as a basic reagent, the yields of 1 and 2 were very low. Thus, to ensure a high yield of 1 and 2, an appropriate amount of pyridine is needed to adjust the pH value around 3. Compound 1 exhibits a double-layer sheet configuration (Figure 1) generated from the interconnection of two single- layers which are produced from the extension of honey- comb-like grids along the (100) plane. Three InIII centres and three BTC trianions form such a 6-membered grid with dimensions of about 7.4 A˚  9.2 A˚ . Inside the grids, each indium atom binds to six carboxylate oxygen atoms from four BTC groups and one water oxygen atom (O7) to form a slightly distorted pentagonal bipyramidal motif. The di- hedral angle between the benzene plane of the BTC group and the plane defined by In, InA, and InB is about 12.6°. Consequently, the sheet adopts a slightly wavy configura- tion. A bidentate carboxylate arm (C9O5O6) lies out of the BTC benzene ring plane with a dihedral angle as high as 26° such that the carboxylate arms act as the bridges linking two single-layers into a double-layer. The other two carboxylate arms bond in a chelating bidentate mode and participate in the propagation of the grids. The two single- layers are related to each other through the twofold screw symmetry operation and the distance between them is about 3.8 A˚ . Because of the translation operation of the screw axis, the available sizes of honeycomb-like grids are signifi- cantly reduced. This explains the fact that 1 absorbs little nitrogen gas even after dehydration.[31] To balance the charge, O7 can be considered to be a coordinated water oxygen atom. This assumption is confirmed by bond val- ence calculations for O7 which give a result of 0.5.[32] The Figure 1.

KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2005, 7781 78 InO7 vectors are perpendicular to the double-layer plane and point towards the extra double-layer region. Further- more, the double-layers are stacked in parallel separated by about 4 A˚ . This is sufficiently close such that the InO7 vectors on the double-layers are interdigitated. Coordinated water oxygen atoms form strong hydrogen bonds with car- boxylate oxygen atoms from adjacent double-layers [O7···O2A, 2.775(4) A˚ , (A):1  x, 0.5  y, 0.5  z]. The free water molecules included in the honeycomb-like grids also form hydrogen bonds with the above coordinated water pendants of the double-layers [O8···O7, 2.679(7) A˚ ]. Al- though some honeycomb structures have been found,[7,14,33] compound 1 is, to the best of our knowledge, unpre- cedented because of the double-layer conformation. Compound 2 exhibits a 3D hybrid framework con- structed from chains of corner-linked octahedra connected by carboxylate linkers (Figure 2). Each indium atom binds to four carboxylate oxygen atoms from four H2BTEC groups and two other bridging oxygen atoms (O17 and O18) to form an octahedron. Bond valence calculations for O17 and O18 give a value of 1.3. Thus, the oxygen atoms (O17 and O18) can be considered to be µ-OH functions thereby balancing the negative charge in 2. The octahedra are linked into infinite chains running along the [010] direc- tion via µ-OH functions. Furthermore, two adjacent oc- tahedra in one chain are bridged by two carboxylate arms from two different organic linkers. The octahedra are sever- ely tilted and this is reflected by angles of 122.1(5)° (In1O17In1) and 122.2(5)° (In2O18In2), both being very far from the value 180° which would be expected if the chains of octahedra were perfectly linear. Each H2BTEC group binds to four indium atoms, in a bidentate mode, situated in two different chains through the 1,5-carboxylate arms. The other two carboxylate arms are uncoordinated and protonated. Geometrically, the latter two carboxylate arms are coplanar with the phenyl ring whereas the other two are perpendicular to the phenyl rings. All phenyl rings are perpendicular to the directions of the chains. The chains are interweaved by organic linkers in such a way that the Figure 2. View of the interconnection between polyhedral chains and H2BTEC groups in 2; free water oxygen atoms are omitted for clarity Novel Inorganic-Organic Hybrid Frameworks SHORT COMMUNICATION adjacent indium atoms in any chain are situated at approxi- mately y  0 and y  1/2 while the phenyl rings located between two indium atoms are at approximately y  1/4 on one side of the chain and y  3/4 on the other side of the same chain (Figure 3). Such arrangement of metal and organic moieties is similar to that of the compound MIL- 61.[28] These types of connections between the organic and inorganic moieties result in 1D polygonal tunnels. However, the uncoordinated carboxylic functions point towards these tunnels and reduce the effective sizes of the cavities. This helps understand why 2 absorbs little nitrogen gas even after dehydration.[31] Water molecules reside in the tunnels and give rise to hydrogen bonds with uncoordinated car- boxylic functions [O19···O14 2.65(2) A˚ , O20···O5 2.629(8) A˚ , O19···O8A 2.859(4) A˚ , O20···O12B 2.915(3) A˚ .

The powder patterns obtained experimentally for 1 (b) and 2 (e) are in agreement with the calculated patterns for 1 (a) and 2 (d), respectively. The exceptions are the lines at 2θ  16.5 and 20.5° in 2 which are too intense in the experimental pattern. This phenomenon is a result of the preferred orientation of the crystallites. The infrared absorption bands of 1 and 2 are listed in Table 1. In 1, the absence of the characteristic bands at 17301690 cm1 due to the protonated carboxylate groups indicates that complete deprotonation of H3BTC occurs upon reaction with indium ions.[34] A strong absorption at 1731 cm1 in 2 confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid function. Both results are in agreement with the crystallo- graphic data. Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses were carried out under air. The TG diagram (Figure 5) of 1 shows that the first weight loss of 10.1% occurring from about 50 °C to 167 °C Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2005, 7781 www.eurjic.org © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TG curves for 1 and 2 corresponds to the complete loss of free and coordinated water molecules (calculated: 10.1%), accompanied by the transformation of the framework of 1 indicated by the XRD pattern (see c in Figure 4). The second weight loss, occurring from about 424 °C to 554 °C, is the stage at which 1 dramatically loses its organic component. The light yellow Z.-Z. Lin, F.-L. Jiang, L. Chen, D.-Q. Yuan, Y.-F. Zhou, M.-C. Hong SHORT COMMUNICATION residue is In2O3 with a residual weight fraction of 38.4% (calculated: 38.8%). This was confirmed by XRD analysis. Compound 2 also undergoes a two-step weight loss (Fig- ure 5). The first weight loss of 4.53% from about 50 °C to 182 °C can be attributed to the loss of free water molecules (calculated: 4.48%). In contrast to compound 1, XRD stud- ies show that the framework of 2 remains intact after the loss of water molecules (see f in Figure 4). The second weight loss occurs in the temperature range of 380 to 570 °C, in which 2 dramatically loses weight and begins decom- posing due to the loss of organic matter. The residue at 570 °C weighing 33.6% of the total is In2O3 (calculated: 34.53%). This was confirmed by XRD analysis. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit intense greenish-blue emis- sions in the solid state at 494 nm (λex  325 nm) for 1 and 489 nm (λex  337 nm) for 2. Compared with the fluor- escent analysis of other metal-BTC compounds,[33] we can assign the 494 and 489 nm emission bands to ligand-to- metal charge-transfer (LMCT) processes.
