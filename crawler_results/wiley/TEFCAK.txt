Manuscript ARTICLE DOI: 10.1002/zaac.201100291 Metal(II) Complexes Based on Imidazo[4,5-f]-1,10-phenanthroline and Bridging Dicarboxylato Ligands: Synthesis, Characterization and Photoluminescence Yun Gong,*[a] Tao Wu,[a] Jinghua Li,[a] Jianbo Qin,[a] Xiaoxia Wu,[a] and Rong Cao[b] Keywords: Imidazo[4,5-f]-1,10-phenanthroline; Dicarboxylato ligands; Zinc; Cadmium; Copper; Luminescence Abstract. Eight metal(II) complexes based on imidazo[4,5-f]-1,10- phenanthroline (HIMP) and bridging dicarboxylato ligands such as 4,4-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC), thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (H2TDC), and 2,6- naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (H2NDC) were hydrothermally synthe- sized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Complexes 1, 3, 6, and 7 are molecular dinuclear metal complexes. Complexes 2, 4, and 5 exhibit chain-like structures. Compound 8 shows a novel 3D architecture, in which ZnII dimers are connected by four NDC2– anions. In the metal(II) complexes, HIMP exhibits a sim- ilar chelating coordination mode. Different π···π stacking interactions Introduction Increasing interest has been arising in the syntheses, struc- tures, and properties of coordination compounds because of their potential applications in catalysis, molecular adsorption, magnetism, optics, and molecular sensing.[1] In the rational de- sign and synthesis of organic-inorganic hybrid materials, rigid ligands have attracted great research interest because the re- sulting structure could be predicted more easily.[2] Imid- azo[4,5-f]-1,10-phenanthroline (HIMP) (Scheme 1) is a rigid fused heterocycle with four intra-cyclic nitrogen atoms in the planar conjugated system.[3] It attracted our interest due to the delocalized π electron in the aromatic ring. In the fused hetero- cycle, the five-membered imidazole ring is π electron rich due to the pyrrole nitrogen atom in the structure, whereas the phen- anthroline part has a π electron deficiency due to the nitrogen atom of pyridine.[4] Different electron densities of the atoms within the fused ring enable an easy flow of the delocalized π electrons. As a result, HIMP shows an apparent C2 symmetric structure due to a fast proton exchange between the two nitro- * Prof. Dr. Y.

The emission of HIMP is completely quenched in complexes 1–4 due to the strong π···π stacking interac- tions in the structures. Complexes 5–8 exhibit different photolumines- cence properties. Firstly, we quantitatively investigated the effect of the strong HIMP–HIMP stacking interactions on the emission quench- ing of HIMP in the metal complexes. It was found that a higher extent of π···π stacking interactions in the complexes resulted in a higher extent of the emission quenching of HIMP. The introduction of aro- matic conjugated carboxylate groups into metal(II)-HIMP complexes changed the extent of the strong π···π stacking interactions in the struc- tures and thus the photoluminescence properties of the complexes. gen atoms of the imidazole ring (Scheme 1).[4] It is obvious that the compound exhibits good photoluminescence proper- ties. Scheme 1. Structure of HIMP. The interactions of metal ions with organic ligands usually change the fluorescence properties of the organic ligands. HIMP coordinates easily to metal ions due to the nitrogen atoms of phenanthroline and imidazole units in the structure. Metal-HIMP complexes were usually used as DNA probes due to the varying fluorescence properties of HIMP in applica- tions.[5] The HIMP ligand in metal complexes would show dif- ferent photoluminescence properties before and after binding with DNA.[5] However, the effect of the structures of metal- HIMP complexes on the photoluminescence properties of HIMP is rarely reported. In an attempt to investigate the photoluminescence proper- ties of the ligand HIMP in different metal(II)-HIMP com- plexes, we introduced different aromatic dicarboxylate ligands into metal(II)-HIMP complexes. HIMP can act as a chelating bidentate ligand due to its phenanthroline unit (Scheme 1).[5] Y. Gong, T. Wu, J. Li, J. Qin, X. Wu, R. Cao ARTICLE In order to diminish the effect of coordination modes on photo- luminescence properties of HIMP, it is necessary to hinder the nitrogen atoms of imidazole to be coordinated. Usually, imid- azole is deprotonated in organic solvents.[6] In the presented work, water was used as solvent and eight metal(II)-HIMP complexes were hydrothermally synthesized. In all complexes the HIMP ligand exhibits a chelating coordination mode with uncoordinated imidazole nitrogen atoms. As we know, d10 metal ions have a filled d subshell and their complexes have been attracting intensive research interest because of their optical properties.[7] In the presented work, d10 metal ions such as ZnII and CdII were utilized in the synthe- ses of complexes 2–8. The photoluminescence properties of the complexes and the free HIMP ligand were investigated un- der similar conditions. Results and Discussion Synthesis In the presented work, we choose water as solvent, but HIMP is almost insoluble in water at room temperature. To solve this problem, we chose the well-established hydrother- mal method. Under such condition, the different solubilities of the organic and inorganic starting materials are alleviated. The hydrothermal temperature (below 200 °C) avoids of decompo- sition of organic components and promotes “self-assembly” of crystalline metastable phases from simple molecular precur- sors. In the presented work, the preparations of complexes 1–8 were not susceptible to the reaction temperature and reaction time. In general, solutions of reactants were treated hydrother- mally for 2 to 4 days at temperatures of 120–160 °C to produce crystalline products in moderate yields (50% to 85%). The molar ratio of dicarboxylic acid/HIMP was also not very im- portant, when the ratio was increased to 2:1, the HIMP-in- cluded complexes were still obtained, which indicated that HIMP has superior coordination ability. The amount of NaOH played an important role in the syn- theses of complexes 1–8. On one hand, under basic conditions, dicarboxylic acid and the imidazole nitrogen atom of HIMP, N4 (Scheme 1), were deprotonated and coordinated to the metal ions. On the other hand, metal hydroxides M(OH)2 pre- cipitated. In order to avoid deprotonation of the imidazole ni- trogen atom of HIMP to ensure a similar coordination mode of HIMP in all complexes, the amount of NaOH should be moderate. The parallel experiments showed that variations in the amount of the base resulted in microcrystalline or amorph- ous materials. The optimized amount of NaOH was 0.15– 0.2 mmol. Complexes 6 and 8 were synthesized under similar condi- tions by using different zinc salts. They were obtained upon the addition of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and ZnSO4·7H2O, respec- tively. It was obvious that the reactions were dependent on the species of counter anions. www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg.

The asymmetric unit of complex 1 contains one CuII atom, one HIMP, and one deprotonated IMP molecule, one half BDPC2– molecule, and two and a half uncoordinated water molecules. Cu1 exhibits a distorted trigonal bipyramidal environment supplied by one oxygen atom from BDPC2– and four nitrogen atoms from one HIMP and one IMP ligand (Figure 1 and Table S1, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 1, the BDPC2– anion exhib- its a bis-monodentate coordination mode to link two CuII atoms. The HIMP and IMP ligands both adopt a chelating co- ordination mode by the phenanthroline moiety, leaving the imidazole group uncoordinated. Figure 1.

As shown in Figure 1, planes I and II(A) are a HIMP and a IMP molecule, respectively (the atom with additional label A refers to the symmetry operations: 1/3+x–y, –1/3+x, 5/3–z). The centroid–centroid and perpendicular distances between the two planes are 3.669 and 3.472 Å, respectively (Table 1), which indicate a strong π···π stacking interactions between pla- nes I and II(A). In complex 1, the wR2 value of 0.2527 is slightly larger than 0.25, because of the incompletely defined lattice water molecules in the structure. But it is not important for the host framework and the π···π stacking interactions in the complex. Crystal Structure of Zn(HIMP)2(BPDC)·H2O (2) Complex 2 contains one independent ZnII atom, two HIMP molecules, two half BDPC2– anions, and one uncoordinated water molecule in the asymmetric unit. N5 and N5 are disor- dered over two locations and their occupancy factors are 85% and 15%, respectively. Zn1 exhibits a distorted octahedral co- ordination arrangement, defined by two oxygen atoms from two BDPC2– anions and four nitrogen atoms from two HIMP ligands (Figure 2a and Table S1).

However, in complex 2, the adjacent ZnII atoms are bridged by BDPC2– linkers into an infinite zigzag chain (Zn···Zn distance: 15.520 and 15.788 Å) (Figure 2b). As shown in Figure 2a, fused rings I and II represent the π systems of two HIMP molecules. In complex 2, the two phenyl rings of the BDPC2– are coplanar, and planes III and IV repre- sent the π systems of two BDPC2–, the centroid–centroid and perpendicular distances between two π systems are listed in Table 1. The strong π···π stacking interactions, are observed not only between different HIMP molecules [planes I–II(B)], but also between HIMP and BDPC2– [planes II(C)–III, II(D)– III] (atoms with additional labels B, C, D refer to the sym- metry operations: B, –1/2+x, 1/2–y, 1/2+z; C, 3/2–x, 1/2+y, 1/2–z; D, 1/2+x, 1/2–y, 1/2+z). Crystal Structure of Cd2(HIMP)4(BDC)(H2O)2·3H2O·(BDC) (3) Similar to complex 1, complex 3 is a dinuclear CdII complex (Cd···Cd distance: 11.372 Å), in which two CdII atoms are linked by one BDC2– anion (Figure 3). The asymmetric unit of complex 3 contains one CdII ion, two HIMP molecules, one half coordinated BDC2– anion, one coordinated water mole- cule, one half uncoordinated BDC2– anion, one and a half lat- Z.

Differently from Cu1 in complex 1, Cd1 exhibits a distorted octahedral arrangement, being coordinated by four nitrogen atoms from two HIMP ligands, one oxygen atom from BDC2– and one oxygen atom from a water ligand (Figure 3 and Table S1). The ligands BDC2– and HIMP exhibit similar bis-monodentate and chelating coordination modes, respectively. Figure 3.

As shown in Figure 3, planes I and II represent the π sys- tems of two HIMP molecules. The data in Table 1 indicate strong π···π stacking interactions between HIMP planes are ob- served [planes I–I(E), II–II(F), II–II(G)] (atoms with ad- ditional labels E, F, G refer to the symmetry operations: E, 1–x, 2–y, –z; F, –x, 1–y, 1–z; G, 1–x, 1–y, 1–z). Crystal Structure of Zn(HIMP)(BDC)(H2O)·H2O (4) In complex 4, the asymmetric unit contains one ZnII atom, one HIMP ligand molecule, two half BDC2– anions, one coor- dinated, and one uncoordinated water molecule. Zn1 exhibits a distorted trigonal bipyramidal environment supplied by two nitrogen atoms from one chelating HIMP ligand, two oxygen atoms from two BDC2– anions and one oxygen atom from a water ligand. The two crystallographically unique BDC2– anions exhibit a similar bis-monodentate coordination mode [Zn1–O1: 2.074(3) Å, Zn1–O2: 2.538(3) Å; Zn1–O3: 2.038(2) Å, Zn1–O4: 3.233 Å] to link different ZnII atoms into a zigzag chain (Figure 4 and Table S1). As shown in Figure 4, plane I represents the π system of a HIMP molecule, planes II and III represent two BDC2– anions. HIMP molecule I and BDC2– molecule II are almost on the same plane. Not only strong HIMP–HIMP [planes I– I(H)] but also phenyl–HIMP [planes II–I(I), II–I(J)] π···π stacking interactions are observed (atoms with additional lab- www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Crystal Structure of Zn(HIMP)(TDC)(H2O)2 (5) Complex 5 crystallizes in space group P21/c, its asymmetric unit contains one ZnII atom, one HIMP ligand molecule, one TDC2– anion, and two coordinated water molecules. Zn1, Zn1 and Zn1 are disordered over three locations and their occu- pancy factors are 40%, 40% and 25%, respectively. Zn1 exhi- bits a distorted octahedral coordination arrangement, being co- ordinated by two nitrogen atoms from one chelating HIMP ligand, two oxygen atoms from water ligands and two oxygen atoms from two carboxylate groups of TDC2– (Figure 5a). The TDC2– groups serve as bis-monodentate ligands to bridge dif- ferent ZnII atoms into infinite chains (Zn···Zn distance: 8.586 Å). As shown in Figure 5a, the HIMP planes are parallel to each other and are on the same side of the chain. The TDC2– planes are also parallel to each other and are on opposite sides of the chain. The TDC2– plane deviates from the HIMP plane (the dihedral angle: 29.5°). Complex 5 is constructed by the alternating left and right-handed chains, which results in a non- chiral of the whole compound. By viewing down the c axis, it is found that strong π···π stacking interactions exist between the left and right-handed chains (Figure 5b). The data in Table 1 indicate that the strong π···π stacking interactions are between HIMP molecules [planes I–I(K), I–I(L)] (atoms with additional labels K, L refer to the symmetry operations: K, 2–x, 1–y, 1–z; L, 2–x, 1–y, –z) (Figure 5a). Crystal Structure of Zn2(HIMP)4(NDC)(H2O)2·4H2O·(NDC) (6) Similar to complex 3, complex 6 is a dinuclear ZnII com- pound. Complex 6 contains one ZnII atom, two HIMP ligand molecules, one coordinated water molecule, one half coordi- nated NDC2– anion, one half uncoordinated NDC2– anion, and two lattice water molecules in the asymmetrical unit. Zn1 exhi- bits a distorted octahedral coordination arrangement, being co- ordinated by four nitrogen atoms from two chelating HIMP ligands, one oxygen atom from a bis-monodentate bridging NDC2– anion and one oxygen atom from a water ligand (Fig- ure 6). As shown in Figure 6, fused rings I and II are two HIMP molecules, fused ring III is a naphthalene plane. The data in Table 1 indicate that not only strong HIMP-HIMP [planes II– II(N)] but also HIMP-naphthalene [planes I–III(M), I–III(N)] π···π stacking interactions are observed (atoms with additional labels M, N refer to the symmetry operations: M, x+1, y–1, z–1; N, 1–x, 1–y, 1–z). Crystal Structure of Cd2(HIMP)4(NDC) (H2O)2·4H2O·(NDC) (7) Complex 7 and complex 6 are isostructural. They are dinu- clear ZnII and CdII clusters, respectively.

View down the c axis, strong π···π stacking interactions exist between alternating left and right-handed chains (b) (hydrogen atoms omitted for clarity). Due to the different ionic radius, the bond lengths of Cd–O (2.265–2.295 Å) and Cd–N (2.353–2.395 Å) are significantly longer than those of Zn–O (2.065–2.095 Å) and Zn–N (2.172– 2.220 Å). As shown in Table 1, similarly, strong π···π stacking interactions are observed not only between HIMP planes, but also between the HIMP molecule and the naphthalene plane.

Zn1 exhibits a distorted octahedral en- vironment supplied by four nitrogen atoms from two chelating HIMP ligands and two oxygen atoms from two NDC2– (Fig- ure 7a). Zn2 shows a distorted tetrahedral arrangement, de- fined by four oxygen atoms from four NDC2– ligands (Fig- ure 7a). In complex 8, NDC2– anions show three kinds of coor- dination modes: bis-monodentate, tridentate, and bis-bidentate, as shown in Figure 7b. Zn1 and Zn2 are connected by one tridentate and one bridging bis-bidentate NDC2– ligands to form a dinuclear secondary building unit (SBU) (Zn···Zn dis- tance: 4.267 Å). In the dinuclear SBU, two HIMP molecules occupy the four coordination sites of Zn1 and block the exten- sion of the framework. On the contrary, Zn2 is four coordi- nated by two tridentate, one bridging bis-bidentate, and one bis-momodentate NDC2– ligands (Figure 7b). If we take the ZnII dimer as a single node, the ZnII SBU becomes a four- connected node (Figure 7b). Each node is connected by four NDC2– linkers and complex 8 thus exhibits a 3D diamondoid structure. As shown in Figure 7a, fused rings II and IV are two HIMP molecules, fused rings I, III, and V are naphthalene planes. Only strong HIMP–naphthalene π···π stacking interactions are observed [planes I–II, III–IV, I–II(P), the atom with ad- Y. Gong, T. Wu, J. Li, J. Qin, X. Wu, R. Cao ARTICLE Figure 7.

Photoluminescence Properties The XRD powder patterns of complexes 1–8 are shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. All peaks could be indexed to their respective simulated XRD powder patterns, which indicate phase purity of all complexes. The emission spectra of the free ligand HIMP and complexes 1–8 in the solid state (λex = 250 nm, slit width = 3 nm) were measured at room temperature. As the shown in Figure 8a, HIMP displays two intense emission peaks at 731, 486 nm and one shoulder peak at 824 nm, which are attributable to different intra-ligand electron transitions of HIMP, such as ππ*, π*n, nn*, πn transitions.[8] As shown in Figure 8e, the emission spectrum of complex 8 is similar to that of free HIMP, though the emission peaks are slightly shifted (733, 485, and 825 nm), indicating those peaks are still caused by intra-ligand transitions of HIMP.[8] However, it was found that the intensities of the three peaks in the emission spectrum of complex 8 were slightly lower than those of free HIMP (Figure 8e), which infers that the in- tra-ligand electron transitions of HIMP were weakened a little. www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2012, 473–481 478 Figure 8. Solid-state emission spectra at room temperature of the free HIMP (a), complex 5 (b), complex 6 (c), complex 7 (d) and complex 8 (e). As shown in Figure 8b, complex 5 also exhibits three emis- sion peaks at 712, 482, and 825 nm, which are similar to those of free HIMP. However, the emission intensities of complex 5 are much lower than those of free HIMP, which indicate that the emission of HIMP was quenched to a great extent in com- plex 5. Complex 6 exhibits one intense emission peak at 730 nm and one shoulder peak at 824 nm, as shown in Figure 8c. As for the spectrum of complex 7, the peaks are shifted to 711 and 825 nm, respectively, as shown in Figure 8d. The emission intensities of complex 6 are higher than those of complex 7. Complexes 6 and 7 are isomorphous; their structures are al- most similar except the metal ions. It was indicated the zinc complex 6 shows better photoluminescence property than the cadmium complex 7.[9] Similar to the spectrum of complex 5, the emission intensities of complexes 6 and 7 are all lower than those of free HIMP, which indicate that the intra-ligand electron transitions of HIMP were also weakened to some ex- tents in the two complexes. In parallel experiments it was found that complexes 1–4 are non-emissive, which indicates the emission of HIMP was quenched completely in these complexes. Complex 1 is a cop- per complex and CuII is known to be an emission quencher.[10] But complexes 2–4 are with zinc or cadmium metal atoms, for what reason is the emission of HIMP quenched here? As it is known, HIMP can be widely used as DNA probes because HIMP binding with DNA through intercalation usu- ally results in hypochromism, which is due to the intercalative mode involving a strong stacking interaction between an aro- matic chromophore and the base pairs of DNA. The extent of hypochromism commonly parallels the intercalative binding strength.[5] Similarly, the fluorescence properties of com- pounds are also related with the interactions and interaction strength in the structures.[11,12] As for organic compounds, emission quenching often ap- peared when the organic molecules are in the state of aggrega- tion due to π···π stacking interactions.[11] In 2005, Ajayaghosh proposed that the fluorescence self-quenching in the self-as- Metal(II) Complexes with Imidazo[4,5-f]-1,10-phenanthroline sembly of oligo(para-phenylenevinylene)s could be controlled by using π···π stacking interactions.[11a] In 2009, Asha synthe- sized and characterized a series of naphthalene diimide-con- taining copolyurethanes with different ratios of naphthalene di- imide. It was found that fluorescence quenching happened with higher naphthalene incorporation, which indicated the presence of aggregates in the structure due to extensive π···π stacking of the aromatic core.[11b] A similar fluorescence quenching mechanism was also reported in metal-organic com- pounds.[12a–12c] In 2008, Takashima reported the fluorescence of zinc-porphyrin was almost quenched due to strong π···π stacking interactions between the discrete ions.[12a] A novel water-soluble poly(para-phenylene) derivative (PBTS) with pendant thymine and sulfonate units was reported. PBTS ex- hibited a reversible and selective fluorescence quenching be- havior toward Hg2+ ions, which resulted from the interpoly- meric π stacking aggregation.[12b,12c] As described above, the fluorescence quenching mechanism can account for the phenomena reported in this paper. In com- plexes 1–7, strong HIMP-HIMP π···π stacking interactions were observed (Table 1), which caused fluorescence quenching of HIMP in the complexes to large extents. In the structure of complex 8, only strong HIMP-naphthalene π···π stacking interactions exist due to the 3D diamondoid network (Table 1), no strong π···π stacking interactions exist directly between HIMP planes, thus the extent of emission quenching of HIMP in complex 8 is the least in all the complexes.[11,12] As shown in Table 1, in complex 3, three kinds of HIMP– HIMP π···π stacking interactions were involved, which indi- cated that the extent of the HIMP–HIMP stacking interactions was the strongest, thus the emission of HIMP in complex 3 was quenched completely. In complexes 2 and 4, not only strong HIMP–HIMP but also HIMP–biphenyl (or phenyl) stacking interactions existed, the complicated π stacking inter- actions also caused the emission of HIMP to be quenched com- pletely.[11,12] As shown in Figure 5b and Table 1, in complex 5, all strong HIMP–HIMP π···π stacking interactions are along one direc- tion (c axis), which is different from the multi-directional π···π stacking interactions in the other complexes. The emission of HIMP can be kept in complex 5 to some extent, which is prob- ably due to the ordered π-stacking interactions.[11,12] Complexes 6, 7, and 3 are all zero-dimensional (0D) dinu- clear metal(II) clusters. Their structures include one coordi- nated and one uncoordinated dicarboxylate anion. In complex 3, the dicarboxylate anion is BDC2–. However, in complexes 6 and 7 NDC2– is the dicarboxylate anion. The NDC2– ligand has the greater planar area and a more extended π system than the BDC2– ligand, which enables NDC2– to form more strong HIMP-naphthalene stacking interactions than HIMP-phenyl stacking interactions, to avoid of the strong HIMP-HIMP stacking interactions, as shown in Table 1. So the emission of HIMP can be retained in complexes 6 and 7 to some extents, whereas complex 3 is non-emissive.[11,12] Conclusions Eight metal(II) complexes based on HIMP and bridging di- carboxylato ligands were synthesized hydrothermally under Z.

Complexes 1, 3, 6, and 7 are molecular dinuclear metal(II) clusters. Complexes 2, 4, and 5 exhibit chain-like structures, in which different metal(II) an- odes are linked by aromatic conjugated carboxylate groups into a 1D framework. Complex 8 shows a novel 3D architecture. Scheme 2. Reaction scheme for the syntheses of complexes 1–8. The solid-state emission spectra of the free HIMP and the eight complexes were measured. According to the crystal structures of the complexes, the effect of the strong HIMP– HIMP π···π stacking interactions on the emission quenching of HIMP in the metal complexes was quantitatively investigated for the first time. The investigations showed that a higher ex- tent of π···π stacking interactions resulted in a higher extent of the emission quenching of HIMP in complexes. The introduc- tion of the aromatic conjugated carboxylate groups into met- al(II)-HIMP complexes changed the extent or direction of the strong π···π stacking interactions in the structures and thus the photoluminescence properties of the complexes. Complexes 6 and 7 were isomorphous but showed different photolumines- cence properties, which indicated that the intra-ligand transi- tions of HIMP are related to the species of metal ions in the complexes. Experimental Section Material and Instrumentation: All chemicals purchased were of rea- gent grade and used without further purification. C, H, N elemental analyses were performed with a Perkin–Elmer 240c elemental ana- lyzer. Infrared spectra were recorded as KBr pellets with a Nicolet 170SXFT/IR spectrometer. Excitation and emission spectra were ob- tained with a Spex FL-2T2 spectrofluorometer equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. All measurements were per- formed at room temperature.
