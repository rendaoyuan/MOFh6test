The hydrothermal reactions of com- pound 2 with MnCl2·4H2O or Co(NO3)2·6H2O produce, respectively, the isostructural layered materials M(H2O)- (PO3C6H4CO2H) (3, M = Mn; 4, M = Co) characterized by the presence of the free carboxylic acid groups in the interlayer space (space group P21/n). The reaction of Zn(CH3COO)2· 2H2O with 2 produces two different materials depending on the pH of the reaction media. At low pH (pH  4.1), the iso- Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) or coordination net- works,[1] synthesized from the reaction involving organic molecules and metallic salts, have attracted much interest in recent years owing to their potential applications in dif- ferent areas including gas storage,[2] catalysis,[3] chiral sepa- ration,[4] nonlinear optical materials[5] or drug storage.[6] The rigidity of the organic precursor has a great influence on the shape of the hybrid materials. For this reason, many rigid dicarboxylates[7] have been employed as organic build- ing blocks. As an illustration, bis(carboxylate) (e.g. terephthalate) was selected to design porous materials when engaged with either Zn4O[8] or Cr3O clusters.[9] The isoretic- ular principle states that a variation of the length of the rigid precursor can be exploited to tune the size of the pores,[10] whereas the introduction of some flexibility in the organic building block can prevent the formation of iso- typic materials.[11] Many MOFs have been synthesized from [a] Laboratoire CRISMAT, CNRS UMR 6508, ENSICAEN, 6 Blvd. Maréchal Juin, 14050 Caen Cedex, France Fax: +33-2-31-95-16-00 E-mail: jean-michel.rueff@ensicaen.fr [b] Laboratoire de Chimie Moléculaire et Thio-organique, EN- SICAEN, Université de Caen Basse-Normandie, CNRS; 6 Blvd. Maréchal Juin, 14050 Caen, France [c] Laboratoire CEMCA, CNRS UMR 6521, Université de Bret- agne Occidentale, 6 Avenue Le Gorgeu, 29238 Brest, France Fax: +33-2-98-01-70-01 E-mail: pjaffres@univ-brest.fr Supporting information for this article is available on the WWW under http://www.eurjic.org or from the author.

At higher pH, generated by the addition of urea in the hydrothermal reaction, Zn3(H2O)2)(PO3C6H4CO2)2 (6) is formed (ortho- rhombic; space group Pcan). In material 6, the phosphonic acid and the carboxylic acid groups are linked to the inor- ganic network. One of the two ZnII centres is tetrahedrally coordinated and the other is surrounded by a trigonal bipyra- mid. (© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2008) rigid poly(carboxylic acid) precursors; thus, the use of rigid phosphonic acid group represents also a great potential for the construction of hybrid materials. 1,4-Benzenediphos- phonic acid or 4.4-biphenyldiphosphonic acid[12] were the first rigid diphosphonic acids employed for the synthesis of hybrid materials. More recently, 3D hybrid materials were formed starting from the rigid 3,5-diphosphonophen- ylphosphonic acid,[13] BINOL–diphosphonic acid,[14] or a rigid dentritic tetraphosphonic acid.[15]In the last two cases, microporous materials were formed. Finally, the use of rigid heterobifunctional organic building blocks has been em- ployed few times to form new hybrids. In these recent works the metallic partner was calcium[16] or zinc[17] and the or- ganic precursor was para-phosphonobenzoic acid or 5- phosphonobenzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid. In this paper, we report the use of a heterobifunctional organic precursor [3-phosphonobenzoic acid (2)] possessing a rigid structure to synthesize hybrid materials involving three different types of metallic precursors (Mn, Co and Zn salts). We have investigated different conditions of synthesis (e.g., variation of the pH), which control the number of functional groups of the organic component linked to the inorganic networks. Results and Discussion Organic precursor 2 (Scheme 1) is readily synthesized in multigram quantities starting from commercial 3-bromo- benzoic acid. First, the methyl ester was synthesized follow- ing the classical method of esterification. Then, methyl 3- J.-M. Rueff, P.-A. Jaffrès et al. FULL PAPER (diethoxyphosphoryl)benzoate (1) was obtained by a modi- fied Tav’s method for the phosphonation of a halogenoaro- matic substrate. This reaction takes place at a temperature higher than 180 °C by treating 3-bromobenzoate with tri- ethylphosphite in the presence of a catalytic amount of nickel bromide. It must be noted that this reaction must be carried out with care. Indeed, the addition rate of triethyl- phosphite must be slow, especially at the beginning, because an induction period is observed, which is followed by an exothermic reaction. After purification by distillation, com- pound 1 was isolated in a yield ranging from 70 to 85%. In the last step, the ester functional groups were hydrolyzed by heating compound 1 at reflux in the presence of concen- trated HCl. Compound 2 was isolated without further puri- fication in a quasiquantitative yield. Scheme 1. Synthetic pathway for compound 2. Single crystals of compound 2 were isolated and charac- terized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Table 3 and Sup- porting Information). The peculiar arrangement of the functional -COOH and -H2PO3 groups in the meta position of the benzene ring can be clearly identified. In the crystal structure, H2PO3C6H4CO2H molecules form slices, shifted by 1/2 along the c axis and stacked along the b axis (see Figure 1b). As shown in Figure 1a, within these slices, molecules are linked together two by two through their functional -COOH groups. Molecules are packed to have the -COOH functionalities in a face-to-face position form- ing hydrogen bonds (intermolecular O–H distances close to 1.6 Å; encircled in Figure 1b). The juxtaposition of these supramolecular dimeric units leads to the formation of rib- bons along the c direction. A more complex hydrogen- bonding scheme can be evidenced between the -H2PO3 groups, which ensures the cohesion of the global structure linking both the ribbons and slices together. Let us call –, 0 and + the ribbon as a function of their position along a (Figure 1b). The 0 ribbon of one slice is linked to the + and – ribbons of the adjacent slices through strong hydro- gen bonds acting between the -H2PO3 groups (intermo- lecular O–H distances close to 1.6 Å); these O–H bonds are schematized and encircled in Figure 1a. This strong en- twined supramolecular boundary results in the 3D charac- ter observed for the material. Rigid bifunctional organic precursor 2 was used as a rea- gent in a hydrothermal synthesis in association with three different metallic salts. Because the pH of the reaction me- dium can have a great influence on the nature of the species present in solution and therefore an influence on the struc- ture of the hybrid materials formed, the pH of the solutions were measured before the closure of the autoclaves and at their opening as reported in Table 1.

According to these conditions of synthesis, three crystal structures (compounds 3, 4, 6) were resolved from single-crystal dif- fraction studies and one structure (compound 5) from pow- der diffraction. Of note, the powder X-ray diffraction analy- ses of the solid recovered after the hydrothermal treatment point out that the products were phase pure. Table 1.

These compounds consist of inorganic layers inter- leaved regularly with organic layers (Figure 2). The organic part is characterized by the presence of supramolecular di- meric units involving two carboxylic acid groups bearing by two molecules covalently bonded to two distinct inorganic layers. In materials 3 and 4, the Mn2+ or Co2+ ions are bonded to the oxygen atoms of the phosphonate groups. The polyhedra of coordination around the transition ele- ments are completed with water molecules in order to form an octahedron of oxygen atoms around each transition metal. This octahedron is distorted and the deformation varies according to the nature of the divalent ion; for Co2+ there are five bonds shorter than 2 Å and a long one of 2.408 Å, for Mn2+ three short bonds around 2.12 Å, two medium bonds around 2.21 Å and one very long bond of 2.505 Å are observed. Figure 2. Projection of the structure of M(H2O)(PO3C6H4CO2H) along the a axis (3, M = Mn; 4, M = Co; 5, M = Zn). The structure of material 5 (M = Zn) was obtained from powder X-ray diffraction study (Figure 3). In material 5, which is isostructural with materials 3 and 4, the coordina- tion of Zn2+ is similar to the cobalt ones with five short distances and one very long one. The phosphorus atoms are surrounded by three oxygen atoms and one carbon atom that form a tetrahedron around it. In the structures of 3, 4 and 5, the octahedra share corners leading to a pseudoper- ovskite layer (Figure 4a). The PO3C tetrahedra share one edge with the MO6 octahedra leading to MPO7C and one corner with another octahedron (Figure 4b). This arrange- ment is similar to the VPO8 units seen in the Li2VO2PO4 frameworks or within the layers of MII(RPO3)·H2O series reported in the literature.[18] This latter bonding distorts the perovskite layer by a drastic tilt of the octahedra versus the plane containing the metals.

Along to the c axis, the organic molecules are bonded together through supramolecular links. Regarding the stability and the role of these supramolecular links to explain the pack- ing of materials 3, 4 and 5, we conclude that the hydrogen bonds have a crucial role in describing the global dimen- sionality of these materials (Table 2). The organic molecules are bonded together (supramolecular link) along the b di- rection, which is orthogonal to those involved describing the inorganic networks. Therefore, the organic part is 1D. Materials 3, 4 and 5 can therefore be classified in the cat- egory I2O1, which corresponds to 3D materials. It should be noted that compound 5 can also be obtained without hydrothermal treatment by stirring an aqueous solution of 2 with ZnII acetate salt at room temperature. Following this procedure, a microcrystalline powder is obtained. Syntheses performed in aqueous solution at room temperature with MnII and CoII acetate salts and compound 2 do not result in materials 3 and 4. However, when the mother solution is 10990682c, 2008, 26, Downloaded from https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejic.200800483 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

All our trials to obtain material 4 by this way were unfruit- ful. Increasing the pH during the synthesis of 6 by the ad- dition of urea in the course of the hydrothermal treatment (Table 1, Entry 7) leads to a framework very different from the three previous compounds owing to the ability of the Zn2+ ion to adopt other coordination than octahedral. All the oxygen atoms belonging to the phosphonate organic molecule are bonded to zinc atoms and three independent zinc ions are observed. The first one (Zn1) is tetrahedrally coordinated to oxygen atoms, which are also bonded to the phosphorus atoms of the phosphonates. The others (Zn2 and Zn3) are surrounded by five oxygen atoms forming a trigonal bipyramid: two oxygen atoms of the phosphonate group, two from the carboxylate group and one water mole- cule. The framework is made of inorganic columns sur- rounded by organic columns and vice versa (Figure 5). Figure 5. Projection along the a axis of the structure of Zn3- (H2O)2(PO3C6H4CO2)2 (6). The inorganic columns running along the a axis are made of ZnO5 bipyramids and ZnO4 and PO3C tetrahedral sharing corners (Figure 6a,b). www.eurjic.org © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The organic columns, also running along the a axis, are made of isolated phosphonate groups. In this structure, each molecule 2 is bonded to six zinc atoms (Figure 7). Re- garding the dimensionality of compound 6, the contri- bution of the inorganic network is one (I1), as the inorganic part is composed of chains running along the a axis. These inorganic chains are bonded together with the organic molecules along the b direction, but also along the c axis. Therefore, the contribution of the organic part to the di- Figure 7.

Hence, compound 6 can be classified in the category I1O2 forming a 3D struc- ture. The contribution of organic part to the dimensionality of material 6 is increased compared to that of material 3 or 4. Such organization can be explained by the linkage be- tween the two functional groups present on organic precur- sor 2 and the inorganic part. Moreover, this 3D organiza- tion arises from the rigidity of the organic precursor, which is locked into a bent shape owing to the presence of the functional groups in the meta position on the aromatic ring. From these structural studies we noticed that when ZnII salts are engaged with organic molecule 2, the pH of the reaction media has a remarkable effect on the structural organization of the hybrids formed. At low pH, compound 5 is formed exclusively, as only the phosphonic acid is linked to the inorganic network, whereas the carboxylic ac- ids are engaged into a dimeric unit through hydrogen bond- ing. This observation can be justified by the fact that the phosphonic acid is first ionized in water due to its lower pKa. Therefore, the phosphonate salt must have a greater reactivity with the metallic precursor in comparison to the carboxylic acid group. In contrast, when the pH of the reac- tion media increases during the hydrothermal synthesis by the transformation of urea into ammonia, the carboxylic acid is also deprotonated leading in that case to the forma- tion of compound 6, which is characterized by the implica- tion of the two groups (phosphonic and carboxylic) in the inorganic network. Therefore, a pH dependent chemioselec- tivity is observed leading to the formation of materials 5 or 6, which can be synthesized selectively. It is worth noting that the influence of the condition of reactions, including the addition of basic compounds, can modify the structure of the resulting materials.[19] If the pH plays an important role in the case of the synthesis of material 5 and 6, it ap- pears to have no influence when cobalt or manganese salts are used as inorganic precursors. Indeed, even in presence of urea (Table 1, Entries 1, 2, 4 and 5), layered materials 3 or 4 are exclusively formed. The pH of the final solution can reach a value of 6.2 (Table 1, Entry 5) without any evi- dence for the formation of a phase in which the two func- tional groups would be linked to the inorganic network. The influence of the composition of the inorganic salt has also been studied, as the counter anion can have an influ- ence on the pH of the reaction media. For instance, when Co(NO3)·6H2O (Table 1, Entry 4) or Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (Table 1, Entry 5) are used the initial pH, respectively 1.7 and 4.4, were noticeably different, whereas the final pH was identical (6.2). In both cases, the same layered material 4 is formed. Similar behaviour is observed when manganese salts are used (Table 1, Entries 1 and 2). Therefore, the chemioselectivity when Mn or Co salts are used is not pH dependent in the range of pH of 4 to 6.2. The SEM characterizations (see Supporting Information) are consistent with the single X-ray structures of com- pounds 3, 4, 5 and 6. Indeed, platelets of average size 50 µm 50 µm for 3, 100 µm 100 µm for 4 and 2 µm 2 µm for 5 are observed by SEM. These characteristics are in good agreement with the existence of a layered structure for these Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2008, 4117–4125 © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 4121 compounds. In contrast, compound 6 forms needles with an average size of 200 µm 50 µm. This observation is con- sistent with the absence of a layered organization in this compound. The thermogravimetric curves (see Supporting Infor- mation) of compounds 3, 4, 5 and 6 exhibit an initial mass loss between room temperature and 330 °C, which is in good agreement with the departure of the coordinated water molecules present in the structure: 5.8% for one H2O in C7H7MnO6P (theoretical loss: 6.6%), 7% for one H2O in C7H7CoO6P (theoretical loss: 6.5%), 4.9% for two H2O in C14H12Zn3O12P2 (theoretical loss: 5.7%) and 6.4% for one H2O in C7H7ZnO6P (theoretical loss: 6.3%). After this dehydration process, a series of several more mass losses are observed, which are attributed to the decomposition of the compound and the formation of Mn2P2O7 for C7H7MnO6P, Co2P2O7 for C7H7CoO6P, Zn3(PO4)2 for C14H12Zn3O12P2 and Zn2P2O7 for C7H7ZnO6P. These final materials were identified by X-ray diffraction and their formation is in good agreement with the total weight of loss: 44% for C7H7MnO6P, 43% for C7H7CoO6P, 40% for C14H12Zn3O12P2 and 45% for C7H7ZnO6P. The IR spectra of materials 3, 4, 5 and 6 are depicted in Figure 8. The resemblance between the IR spectra of com- pounds 3, 4 and 5 was expected in view of their structural similarities. The broad signal between 2500 and 3600 cm–1 and the strong peak around 1700 cm–1 are characteristic of the presence of the hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic acid groups, resulting from the dimeric carboxylic acid unit into the interlayer space. As expected, these signals are dra- matically reduced in the IR spectra of material 6 owing to the absence of hydrogen bonds. Figure 8. Infrared spectra of Mn(H2O)(PO3C6H4COOH) (3), Co(H2O)(PO3C6H4COOH) (4), Zn(H2O)(PO3C6H4COOH) (5) and Zn3(H2O)2(PO3C6H4COO)2 (6). Magnetic measurements were performed with a SQUID magnetometer on an assembly of Mn(H2O)(PO3C6H4- COOH) and Co(H2O)(PO3C6H4COOH) unoriented small crystals. In Figure 9, the magnetization is shown for both compounds. A fitting by the Curie law gives that the Mn compound presents a moment of 5.97 µB/Mn and an extrapo- lation temperature θ = –72 K for a Neel temperature of TN = 22.5 K. The ratio θ/TN ≈3 corresponds to 3 first Mn neighbours in the structure, which does not correspond to any physical neighbours.

The corresponding fit- ting parameters are given in the text. an interchain coupling provides a smaller moment 5.40 µB/ Mn and an extrapolation temperature θ = –45 K for a Neel temperature of TN = 22.5 K. The ratio θ/TN corresponds to 2 first Mn neighbours within the chain, which seems rea- sonable. The smaller value of the moment can be due to the inappropriate extrapolation of this model. The values of about 5.97 µB/Mn corresponds exactly to what is ex- pected for 5/2 moments of Mn2+ with no quench of L. The values of TN, θ and µB are in good agreement with the values found in the literature for similar layered Mn2+ phos- phonates (alkyl or phenyl).[21,22] The isotypic cobalt com- pound presents a moment of 3.53 µB and TN = 6.5 K, θ = –13 K. The ratio θ/TN = 2 confirms the isotypic character of the structures. The value of 3.53 µB corresponds to fully quenched value of the L moment, which is classical for Co2+. Slightly smaller than the value of µB described in the literature for Co2+ phenyl phosphonate, the difference can be easily explained by the temperature range used for the fitting model.[20] Conclusions The use of rigid heterobifunctional compound 2 to de- sign hybrid materials produces either I2O1 or I1O2 3D struc- tures depending on the type of inorganic precursors in- volved and, in the case of ZnII salt as inorganic source, the pH of the reaction media. When Mn or Co salts are em- ployed (materials 3 and 4), the single phosphonic acid group of compound 2 is engaged in the inorganic network, demonstrating the chemioselectivity of the hybrid construc- tion. This construction is not pH dependent in the pH range studied. When ZnII salt is used as inorganic source, www.eurjic.org © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2008, 4117–4125 4122 a pH dependent chemioselectivity is observed. At low pH, material 5, isostructural with materials 3 and 4, is formed. At higher pH, material 6 is formed in which both functional groups (phosphonic acid and carboxylic acid) are engaged in the inorganic network leading to a I1O2 3D network. The structure of this material is governed by the rigidity of organic building block 2. This study illustrates that the use of a heterobifunctional organic precursor can produce ma- terials in which carboxylic acid groups are not engaged with the inorganic networks, resulting in the obtained functional materials. Further studies are presently engaged to achieve postchemical transformations based on the reactivity of the carboxylic acid groups present in these materials. For in- stance, the introduction of amines in the interlayer space of compound 5 is presently studied. In contrast, with certain metallic precursors (Zn) and at controlled pH, rigid bifunc- tional organic precursor 2 can produce original hybrid structures. Experimental Section General: All compounds were fully characterized by 1H, 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy (Bruker AC 300 spectrometer). The follow- ing abbreviations were used: s singlet, d doublet, t triplet, q quadru- plet, qt quintuplet, m multiplet. Mass spectra were recorded with a QTOF Micro (Waters), ionization electrospray positive (ESI), lockspray PEG, infusion introduction (5 µL/min), source tempera- ture 80 °C, desolvatation temperature 120 °C. Elemental analyses were recorded with an automatic apparatus CHNS-O Thermo- Quest. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were recorded at the rate of 2 °C/min from room temperature to 700 °C in air or under an atmosphere of nitrogen by using a SETARAM TGA 92 appara- tus. Methyl 3-(Diethoxyphosphoryl)benzoate (1): NiBr2 (1.87 g; 8.55 mmol), methyl-3-bromobenzoate (23.00 g, 106.9 mmol) and mesitylene (16 mL) were placed under a nitrogen atmosphere in a two-necked, round-bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser and an additional funnel. The suspension was heated at 180 °C and triethylphosphite (26.63 g, 160 mmol) was carefully added dropwise over 45 min. At the end of the addition, the solution was heated at 180 °C for 2 h. After cooling at room temperature, the volatiles, including the solvent, were removed in vacuo. Water (150 mL) was added to the residue, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl ether (275 mL). The organic phase was then washed with brine (340 mL), dried with MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to produce an orange viscous oil. Purification by distillation under high vacuum (10 mTorr) was achieved in a Kugelrohr oven (180 °C), which produced a colourless viscous oil (23.27 g; 80% yield). 1H NMR (300.13 MHz,CDCl3): δ = 1.26 (t, 3J = 7.1 Hz, 6 H, CH3CH2O), 3.87 (s, O-CH3), 3.95–4.18 (m, 4 H, CH2-O-P), 7.49 (td, 3J = 7.6 Hz, 4JHP = 4.0 Hz, CH5), 7.94 (ddt, 3JHP = 12.9 Hz, 3J = 7.6 Hz, 4J = 1.3 Hz, CH4), 8.15 (dq, 3J = 7.8 Hz, 4JHH = 5JHP = 1.3 Hz, CH6), 8.40 (dt, 3JHP = 13.7 Hz, 4J = 1.3 Hz, CH2) ppm. 31P NMR (121.49 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 18.10 ppm. 13C NMR (75.47 MHz,CDCl3): δ = 16.22 (d, J = 6.4 Hz), 52.26 (s), 62.28 (d, J = 5.5 Hz), 128.63 (d, J = 6.4 Hz), 129.00 (d, J = 165.1 Hz), 130.63 (d, J = 9.5 Hz), 132.71 (d, J = 10.9 Hz), 133.21 (d, J = 3.0 Hz), 135.88 (d, J = 10.0 Hz), 166.00 (d, J = 2.0 Hz) ppm.

XRD Investigations: XRD investigation was performed by using Mo-Kα radiations on a Kappa CCD (Bruker Nonius) diffractometer equipped with a CCD (charge coupled device) detector. Large Ω- and Φ-scans were used to both control the crystalline quality of different samples and determine the unit cell parameters. Single crystals of suitable size were then selected. Considering the cell pa- rameters and the spot size (i.e. mosaicity) suitable data collection strategies have been defined. A scanning angle of 0.8° and a Dx (detector–sample distance) value of 34 mm were chosen; Φ- and Ω- scans were used. To collect a great number of weak reflections, but avoiding any detector saturation by reflections of strong intensity, different exposure times were used to collect the data. The dif- fracted intensities were collected up to θ = 40°. Following the sym- metry of the crystal, one independent monoclinic or orthorhombic space was scanned. Plots of reciprocal lattice planes assembled from these series of experimental frames are sufficiently accurate to obtain an overall view of the reciprocal space. The conditions limiting the possible reflections were then observed and the possible space groups identified. The EvalCCD software[23] was used to ex- tract reflections from the collected frames and reflections were merged and rescaled as a function of the exposure time. Data were corrected from absorption by using the Sadabs program[24] devel- oped for scaling and correction of area detector data. Structural models were built up from Patterson map analysis (heavy atoms method) for 3, 4 and 6 and with superflip[25] by using charge-flip- ping methods for phase 2. The model was subsequently introduced in the refinement program Jana2006,[26] and all the atomic posi- tions were refined and anisotropic atomic displacement parameters (ADP) were considered for all the atoms. At this step of the refine- ment, the hydrogen atoms can be located. The decreasing law of the diffusion factor as a function of sinθ/λ implies that the main contribution of the hydrogen atoms to the diffracted intensity is condensed in the beginning of the diffraction patterns.

The atomic position of the hydrogen atoms were refined but their ADP were considered as isotropic and fixed to 0.038 Å2. The FullProf program[27] was used to refine the structure of compound 5. The sample was loaded in a thin capillary (Ø = 0.3 mm) to avoid preferential orientation, and the data were registered with a Bruker D8 diffractometer up to 90° (2θ) by using the Cu-Kα1 wavelength. Bond length constraints were applied on the organic moiety during the refinement. The final reliability fac- tors were: RWP = 5.34%, REXP = 2.64% (χ2 = 4.04) and RBragg = 8.05%.
