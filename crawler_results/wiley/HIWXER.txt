SHORT COMMUNICATION DOI: 10.1002/ejic.200701083 Two Photoluminescent Metal–Organic Frameworks Constructed from Cd3(µ3- OH) Cluster or 1D Zn5(µ3-OH)2(µ-OH)2 Chain Units and In Situ Formed Bis(tetrazole)amine Ligands Ling-Ling Zheng,[a] Hao-Xiang Li,[a] Ji-Dong Leng,[a] Jing Wang,[a] and Ming-Liang Tong*[a] Keywords: Cadmium / Zinc / Amines / Cluster compounds / MOFs / Photoluminescence Hydrothermal reactions of CdCl2·2.5H2O or ZnCl2, sodium dicyanamide, and sodium azide yield two interesting photo- luminescent coordination polymers, namely, [Cd{Cd3- (µ3-OH)(dcadtzH)3(H2O)6}2] (1) and [Zn5(µ3-OH)2(µ-OH)2- (dcadtz)2]·2H2O (2) [dcadtzH3 = bis(5-tetrazolyl)amine], in which triangular [Cd3(µ3-OH)]5+ cluster subunits in 1 and 1D Introduction Inorganic–organic hybrid polymers have attracted con- siderable attention in recent years because of their interest- ing molecular topologies and crystal packing motifs, along- side their potential applications in many areas including gas storage, separation, catalysis, magnetism, optics, as well as electrical conductivity.[1] Neutral as well ionic azides un- dergo cycloaddition with cyano groups to yield a huge vari- ety of different tetrazole derivatives. The tetrazoles have found a wide range of applications in areas as diverse as coordination chemistry, medical chemistry, and materials science as high-density energy materials.[2] More recently, Sharpless et al. reported the preparation of a variety of 5- substituted 1H-tetrazoles in water and investigated the mechanism by which zinc(II) catalyzes the union of an az- ide ion with organic nitriles to form tetrazoles by means of density functional theory.[3] Although the role of ZnII in the reaction is unclear, it allows us to explore the coordination chemistry of tetrazoles more extensively than in the past. We are interested in the construction of novel supramolec- ular motifs through in situ ligand reactions.[4] In our earlier work, we found interesting in situ nucleophilic addition re- actions of sodium dicyanamide {Na[N(CN)2]}[5] with some small molecules under mild conditions (Scheme 1), such as CH3OH, pyrazole.

(© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2008) est in such systems, we chose NaN3 as the nucleophile. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two photoluminescent coordination polymers, [Cd{Cd3(µ3- OH)(dcadtzH)3(H2O)6}2] (1) and [Zn5(µ3-OH)2(µ-OH)2- (dcadtz)2]·2H2O (2) [dcadtzH3 = bis(5-tetrazolyl)amine]. Scheme 1. The known nucleophilic addition reactions of Na[N(CN)2] with some small molecules under mild conditions. Results and Discussion Compounds 1 and 2 were prepared by hydrothermal re- actions of CdCl2·2.5H2O or ZnCl2, Na[N(CN)2], and NaN3 at 110 and 175 °C, respectively. The dcadtz3– ligand was generated in situ from the dicyanamide and azide ions in the presence of Zn2+ or Cd2+ ions (Scheme 2). The in situ formation of tetrazoles by a [2+3] cycloaddition reaction of azide and nitriles has been well established for the synthesis of different coordination complexes.[2,6] However, up to now, the use of dicyanamide as a source of CN was rarely L.-L. Zheng, H.-X. Li, J.-D. Leng, J. Wang, M.-L. Tong SHORT COMMUNICATION documented.[7] Moreover, 2 cannot be obtained under the same hydrothermal reaction temperature as that used for the preparation of 1. Scheme 2. The in situ synthesis of [dcadtzH]2– and [dcadtz]3–. Single-crystal X-ray analysis showed that the structure of 1 is a 2D coordination polymer composed of [CdII3(µ3- OH)]5+ cluster units, dcadtzH2– ligands, and CdII ions (Fig- ure 1). Each Cd1 ion displays a pseudooctahedral [CdN3O3] coordination geometry, and it is ligated to three nitrogen atoms from two dcadtzH2– ligands [Cd1–N 2.304(1)– 2.338(1) Å], two trans related aqua ligands [Cd1–O 2.316(1) and 2.353(1) Å], and one OH– group [Cd1–O1 2.291(1) Å]. The hydroxy group lies on a threefold axis, and it acts as a µ3 bridge linking three Cd1 ions, which leads to the forma- tion of an equilateral triangle with Cd···Cd distances equal to 3.873(2) Å. The Cd–O1–Cd angle is 115.34(2)° and the OH– group is out of the Cd3 plane, which results in the formation of a noncoplanar [Cd3(µ3-OH)]5+ cluster unit. The [Cd3(µ3-OH)]5+ unit is surrounded by three dcadtzH2– ligands, each of which acts in the µ3:η1:η1:η1:η1 chelating- bridging mode to link a pair of Cd1 atoms and one Cd2 atom. Each Cd2 lies on a crystallographic –3 position and adopts octahedral geometry with six symmetry-related N6 atoms from six dcadtzH2– ligands [Cd2–N 2.363(1) Å]. The dcadtzH2– ligand also links a Cd2 ion through the N6 atom, and hence, the tetrazolate group acts as a bridge be- tween the [Cd3(µ3-OH)]5+ clusters and the Cd2 centers; the shortest Cd···Cd distance is 6.700(3) Å. Each Cd2 ion links six [Cd3(µ3-OH)]5+ cluster units, and each cluster connects three Cd2 ions, which results in a 2D layer parallel to the ab plane (Figure 1c). The network topology can be simplified by considering only the 3-connected [Cd3(µ3-OH)]5+ cluster units and the 6-connected Cd2 centers as nodes; the dcadtzH2– ligands can be represented simply as links between the two types of nodes. The resulting net is shown in Figure 1d, which is a rare (3,6)-connected net.[8] The long topological vertex sym- bol is 4.4.4 for the [Cd3(µ3-OH)]5+ cluster node and 4.4.4.4.4.4.6.6.6.6.6.6.*.*.* for the Cd2 node, which gives the short vertex symbol (43)2(46.66.83). It should be noted that an artistic 3D metal–organic framework, [Ag3(ctc)- (bsd)3]·1.5bsd·3.5H2O (H3ctc = 1,3,5-cyclohexanetricarbox- ylic acid, bsd = 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole),[9] constructed with ideal Ag3(ctc) honeycomb layers and the µ-bridging bsd ligands is a 3D (3,6)-connected topological net. It has the short vertex symbol (43)2(46.66.83)3, which is quite dif- ferent from that in 1 mainly due to the octahedral geometry of the Cd2 ions; this results in a doubly decked layer struc- ture that is similar to that in recently reported [Mn{Mn3(µ3- F)(dcadtz)3(H2O)6}2].[7b] The coordinated water molecules play an important role as hydrogen donors for intra- and interlayer hydrogen www.eurjic.org © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Within the layer, the hydrogen atom of the O1w water molecule forms a O–H···N [O1w···N3 2.757(1) Å] hydrogen bond with the N3 atom from the dcadtzH2– ligand. For the interlayer hydrogen bonding in- teractions, each O2w forms two interlayer O–H···N hydro- gen bonds with two nitrogen atoms (N4 and N7) of the tetrazolate group [O2w···N4 2.780(1) Å, O2w···N7 2.767(1) Å]. These hydrogen bonds extend the 2D coordina- tion layers into a 3D supramolecular network (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The nearest interlayer Cd···Cd dis- tances are 5.688(3) and 7.793(4) Å. 10990682c, 2008, 2, Downloaded from https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejic.200701083 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

In 2, the fully-deprotonated dcadtz3– ligand acts as a µ6 bridge, which is different from that found in 1. The Zn2+ ions adopt three different coordination geo- metries. The Zn1 atom is in square-pyramid geometry [cis N/Obasal–Zn1–O/Nbasal 78.74(8)–96.69(7)°, trans N/Obasal– Zn1–O/Nbasal 145.42(8) and 165.30(8)°, Napical–Zn1–O/ Nbasal 93.89(8)–109.31(8)°] surrounded by two chelated ni- trogen atoms [Zn1–N 2.046(2) and 2.175(2) Å] from a dcadtz3– ligand, two hydroxide groups [Zn1–O 1.9835(19) 2.0960(17) Å] in the basal positions, and one nitrogen atom [Zn1–N1a 2.097(2) Å] from another dcadtz3– ligand at the apical position. The Zn2 atom is coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral geometry to two nitrogen atoms [Zn2–N 2.016(2) and 2.018(2) Å] from two dcadtz3– ligands and two hydroxide groups [Zn2–O 1.9152(18) and 2.0556(18) Å]. The O/N–Zn2–O/N bond angles range from 95.87(8) to 126.93(9)°. The Zn3 atom is in an octahedral geometry lig- ated by four nitrogen atoms [Zn3–N 2.156(2)–2.190(2) Å, cis N–Zn3–N 85.13(8)–96.36(11)°, trans N–Zn3–N = 176.17(8)°] from four dcadtz3– ligands and two trans related hydroxide groups [Zn3–O 2.0654(17) and 2.0654(17) Å, O– Zn3–O 179.68(10), O–Zn3–N 86.61(7)–93.61(7)°]. There are two types of hydroxide groups adopting µ2 and µ3 bridging modes, respectively. Each µ3 bridging hydroxide group (O1– H) connects three Zn ions (Zn1, Zn2, and Zn3), and the Zn···Zn distances are 3.614, 3.379, and 3.394 Å and the Zn– O1–Zn angles are 109.29(8)–121.04(8)°. A pair of [Zn3(µ3- OH)]5+ units are further bridged by two µ2 hydroxide groups [Zn1–O2–Zn2b 108.45(9)°] into an eight-membered Zn4(OH)4 circle. The circles are extended into 1D inorganic [Zn5(µ3-OH)2(µ-OH)2]n6n+ chains (Figure 2c) by Zn3–O1 coordination. Interestingly, the 1D inorganic chains are bridged by the µ6 dcadpz3– ligands into a 3D microporous metal–organic framework (Figure 2d). Analysis by using PLATON[10] suggested that the total void volume of 2 with- out water guests, Vvoid, occupy 17.3% of the crystal volume. The water guests are located at these channels and contact the MOF host through plentiful hydrogen-bonding interactions. To examine the thermal stabilities of the networks of 1 and 2, we carried out thermal gravimetric (TG) analyses and measured the XPRD patterns to confirm the purity of the two complexes (Figure 3). Samples of the complexes were heated to 650 °C in air. The TGA curve (Figure 4a) of 1 shows the first weight loss from 20 to 230 °C, and this is in accordance with the loss of all the coordinated water molecules; the dcadtzH2– components were lost above 230 °C. Comparatively, the stability of 2 is higher than that of 1 for its 3D network connection. The TGA curve of 2 (Figure 4b) indicates the loss of lattice water molecules (calcd. 4.9%; found 4.7%) at about 230 °C, and the MOF began to decompose above 400 °C. The complex is finally decomposed to give the ZnO residue (calcd. 57.3%; found 55.7%) above 550 °C. The fluorescent properties of the as-synthesized com- pounds were studied in the solid state at 66 K (Figure 5a, Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2008, 213–217 © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Both compounds exhibit weak fluorescence and therefore fluorescent spectra at lower temperature were recorded. Solid 1 displays blue emission with a maximum at ca. 390 nm (τ = 6.11 µs; Supporting Information, Fig- ure S2).

Thermogravimetric curves for 1 (a) and 2 (b). (Figure 5b, λex = 291 nm). The emission may be ascribed to the cooperative effects of intraligand emission and ligand- to-metal charge transfer (LMCT).[11] Moreover, the lifetime of 2 (τ = 28.48 ns) is also longer than that of 1, which may be due to the stronger interactions of deprotonated dcadtz3– ligands with zinc atoms in 2 (Figure 2b).

Conclusion Hydrothermal reactions of CdCl2·2.5H2O or ZnCl2, so- dium dicyanamide, and sodium azide were performed at 110 or 175 °C and yielded an interesting 2D coordination net of [Cd{Cd3(µ3-OH)(dcadtzH)3(H2O)6}2] (1) or a 3D microporous metal–organic framework of [Zn5(µ3-OH)2(µ- OH)2(dcadtz)2]·2H2O (2). The deprotonated forms of the bis(5-tetrazolyl)amine ligand, dcadtzH2– and dcadtz3–, were generated in situ. We are expanding this reactivity to other transition-metal systems. Experimental Section Synthesis of 1 and 2: The single crystals of 1 and 2 were prepared by hydrothermal reaction of To a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel was added CdCl2·2.5H2O (0.114 g, 0.5 mmol) [or ZnCl2 (0.068 g, 0.5 mmol)], Na[N(CN)2] (0.045 g, 0.5 mmol), and NaN3 (0.065 g, 1.0 mmol) in H2O (5 mL). The vessel was sealed and heated for 4 d at 110 °C for 1 [or for 4 d at 175 °C for 2]. After the mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature, colorless block crystals of 1 [or 2] were obtained. Yield: 60% based on Cd for 1 [85% based on Zn for 2]. 1: C12H32Cd7N54O14 (1943.72): calcd.

X-ray Crystallographic Study: Diffraction intensities of 1 and 2 were collected with a Bruker Apex CCD area-detector dif- fractometer (Mo-Kα, λ = 0.71073 Å). The intensities were inte- grated with SAINT+, which also applied corrections for Lorentz and polarization effects. Absorption corrections were applied by using multiscan program SADABS.[13] The structures were solved with direct methods and refined with a full-matrix least-squares technique with the SHELXTL program package.[14] Compound 1: C12H32Cd7N54O14, M = 1943.72, trigonal, space group P3¯c1 (No. 165), a = 14.6088(6) Å, c = 13.5875(11) Å, V = 2511.3(3) Å3, Z = 2, T = 293(2) K, F(000) = 1860, Dcalcd. = 2.570 g cm–3, µ(Mo-Kα) = 3.021 mm–1; R1 = 0.0310, wR2 = 0.0784 and GOF = 1.119 for 154 parameters, 1572 reflections with |Fo|4σ(Fo).
