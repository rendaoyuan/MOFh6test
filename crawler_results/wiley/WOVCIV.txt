The selection of neutral ligands is extremely important because changing configurations can control and ad- just the topologies of coordination frameworks.[7] In order to investigate the effect of the organic and neutral ligands on the structures of the complex, two structurally dif- ferent semi-rigid bicarboxylate anions, (3-carboxyl-phenyl)-(4- (2-carboxyl-phenyl)-benzyl)ether (H2L1) and 3-carboxy-1- * Dr. J.-F.

Compounds 1–6 have similar 1D chain structures, which are further linked by π–π interactions to generate supramolecular double chains for 1 and 2, and supramolecular layers for 3–6. Com- pound 7 displays a 3D 6-connected framework with (44·611) topology. Compound 8 features a monomolecular structure, which is further linked by hydrogen bonds between the lattice water molecules and carboxylate oxygen atoms of L2 anions to form a 2D supramolecular layer. The monomolecular structures of 9 and 10 are connected by hydrogen bonds and π–π interactions simultaneously to generate sup- ramolecular layers. Compounds 11 and 12 show layer structures. (4-carboxybenzyl)-2-oxidopyridinium (H2L2) and five N-do- nor ligands were selected as the reactants (Scheme 1). Each anion contains two carboxylate groups, where the carboxylate units can rotate freely and adjust themselves sterically around the –(CH2)– or central O moieties when coordinating to the metal ions. Scheme 1. The ligands used in this work. In this work, twelve coordination compounds based on H2L1 and H2L2 were synthesized, namely, [Co(L1)(mpy)] (1), [Ni(L1)(mpy)] (2), [Co(L1)(tbpy)]·2H2O (3), [Ni2(L1)2(tbpy)2]· 5H2O (4), [Mn2(L1)2(tbpy)2]·3H2O (5), [Mn(L1)(biim-3)] (6), Y.-Y.

These compounds are fur- ther characterized by infrared spectroscopy, elemental analy- ses, TGA and X-ray powder diffraction. In addition, the photo- luminescent properties for compounds 1, 3 and 9 are discussed. Results and Discussion Structure Descriptions Structures of [Co(L1)(mpy)] (1) and [Ni(L1)(mpy)] (2) Compounds 1 and 2 (Figure S1; Supporting Information) are isomorphous, therefore 1 is employed as a representative structure to be described in detail. Single-crystal X-ray diffrac- tion reveals that compound 1 has a chainlike structure. Each CoII ion is six-coordinated by three nitrogen atoms from one tridentate chelating mpy ligand and three carboxylate oxygen atoms from two distinct L1 anions, showing a distorted octahe- dral arrangement (Figure 1a). The carboxylate groups of the L anion adopt monodentate and bidentate chelating coordination modes, respectively. In this way, L1 anions connect CoII ions to yield an infinite wavelike chain (Figure 1b). Mpy acts as terminal ligand and attaches on one side of the chain in a tri- dentate chelating coordination mode. In addition, there are intermolecular face-to-face π–π interactions among mpy mol- ecules (with face-to-face and centroid-to-centroid distances of 3.520 and 3.799 Å, respectively, Figure 1c), which link the structure into a supramolecular double chain. Structures of [Co(L1)(tbpy)]·2H2O (3), [Ni2(L1)2(tbpy)2]· 5H2O (4), and [Mn2(L1)2(tbpy)2]·3H2O (5) Compounds 3, 4, and 5 (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting In- formation) are isomorphous, therefore 3 is employed as a rep- resentative structure to be described. Compound 3 shows a similar chain to 1, but tbpy ligands are attached on both sides of the chains in tridentate chelating coordination modes (Fig- ure 2a and b). In addition, π–π interactions exist between the neighboring chains (with face-to-face and centroid-to-centroid distances of 3.323 and 3.622 Å, respectively), which join the chains to yield a 2D supramolecular layer (Figure 2c).

In this way, adjacent MnII atoms are linked by L1 anions to form a 1D double metal ribbon. The dangling biim-3 act as terminal ligands and locate on both rims of the ribbon (Fig- ure 3b). The ribbons are further extended into a 2D supra- molecular layer through π–π interactions between phenyl rings of the phen ligands from neighboring ribbons with a face-to- face distance of 3.459 Å and centroid-to-centroid distance of 3.932 Å (Figure 3c). Structure of Ni2(L1)2(btb)2(H2O)]·2H2O (7) As illustrated in Figure 4a, the asymmetric unit of 7 contains one crystallographically independent NiII ion, one L1 anion, two half btb ligands, half a coordinated and one free water molecule. Each NiII atom is six-coordinated by three carboxyl- ate oxygen atoms from three L1 anions, two nitrogen atoms from two btb ligands, and one water molecule, exhibiting a distorted octahedral arrangement. Each L1 anion links three NiII ions with its two carboxylate groups displaying mono- dentate and bidentate coordination modes.

The ribbons are further linked by the btb ligands to furnish an intricate 3D framework. Topologically, if NiII dimers can be regarded as 6-connected nodes, L1 anions and btb ligands are simplified as linkers, the whole structure of 7 can be simplified as a 3D 6-connected framework with the Schläfli symbol of (44·611) (Figure 4c). Structure of [Cu(L2)(mpy)]·7H2O (8) As illustrated in Figure 5a, each CuII atom displays a square pyramidal arrangement and is five-coordinated by one phenox- ide oxygen atom, one carboxylate group of L2 anion, and three nitrogen atoms from one tridentate chelating mpy ligand. The structural index τ is 0.241 for CuII atom. Seven lattice water molecules, the uncoordinated carboxylate group of L2 anion are involved in the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interac- tions. The mononuclear molecules and the lattice water mol- ecules are linked by these hydrogen bonds to form a 2D supra- molecular layer as shown in Figure 5b. Z. Anorg. Allg.

Structures of [Co(L2)(tbpy)(H2O)] (9) and [Ni(L2)(tbpy)(H2O)]·H2O (10) Compounds 9 and 10 (Figure S4, Supporting Information) are isomorphous, herein 9 is employed as a representative structure to be described. The structure of compound 9 is sim- ilar with 8, but the coordination numbers of their central metal atoms are different. As depicted in Figure 6a, the asymmetric unit of 9 contains one CoII ion, one L2 anion, one tbpy ligand, and one coordinated water molecule. The CoII atom is located in a distorted [N3O3] octahedral arrangement, defined by one L2 anion, one water molecule, and one tbpy ligand as O- and N-donors. There are two intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms of L2 anion act as hydrogen acceptors, whereas the coordinated water molecule act as hydrogen donors (O1W···O5#1 and O1W···O4#2; #1: –x+2, –y, –z+1; #2: x–1, y, z). Such hydrogen-bonding interac- tions link the mononuclear molecules to generate a supra- molecular double chain (Figure 6b). These double chains are further extended into a 2D supramolecular layer through π–π interactions between phenyl rings of the tbpy ligands (with face-to-face distance of 3.325 Å and centroid-to-centroid dis- tance of 3.727 Å, Figure 6b). Structures of [Cu(L2)(bib)]·2H2O (11) and [Cu(L2)(btb)]·2H2O (12) Compounds 11 and 12 (Figure S5, Supporting Information) are isomorphous, therefore 11 is employed as a representative structure to be described.

The L2 anion adopts bidentate a coordination mode to connect with two central CuII atoms to form a [Cu2(L2)2] dimer. The bib ligand bridges neighboring [Cu2(L2)2] dimers to form a layer (Figure 7b). The packing structure of 11 displays a 3D supramolecular framework as shown in Figure 7c. Discussion Effect of Neutral Ligands Compounds 1–12 are all constructed from MII ions, semi- rigid bicarboxylate anions, and neutral ligands. The structure distinctions show the effect of the neutral ligands. For 1–5 and 8–10, the use of rigid terminal chelating ligand mpy or tbpy confines the propagation of MII–carboxylate anions linkages, which leads to mononuclear or 1D chain structures of these compounds. Compared to the rigid mpy and tbpy ligands the introduction of bridging ligands (biim-3, biim-4, btb and bib) leads to the formation of 2D or 3D frameworks. For example, compounds [Co(L1)(mpy)] (1) and [Co(L1)(tbpy)]·2H2O (3) www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2014, 2217–2225 2220 Figure 5.

Compound [Cu(L2)(mpy)]·7H2O (8) features a monomolecular structure, whereas compounds [Cu(L2)(bib)]·2H2O (11) and [Cu(L2)(btb)]·2H2O (12) adopt layer structures. For CoII-con- taining compound, [Co(L2)(tbpy)(H2O)] (9) is a monomolecu- lar structure, whereas [Co(L2)(biim-4)0.5(H2O)]·H2O (14)[7b] exhibits a 2D 3-connected 63 network. Effect of Anions The structures of compounds [Co(L1)(tbpy)]·2H2O (3) and [Co(L2)(tbpy)(H2O)] (9) show the influences of organic anions. In 3, each L1 anion coordinates with two CoII ions, and the structure displays a chain. In 9, the L2 anion coordinates with only one central CoII atom. Compound 9 shows a mono- molecular structure. This fact may be caused by the different lengths of the spacers between the carboxylate groups in L1 and L2 anions. This discrepancy can also be found in NiII-containing compounds [Ni2(L1)2(tbpy)2]·5H2O (4) and [Ni(L2)(tbpy)(H2O)]·H2O (10). Coordination Polymers with Semi-Rigid Bicarboxylic Acid Ligands Figure 6.

PXRD Patterns The diffraction peaks of both simulated and experimental patterns match well in relevant positions, indicating that the phase purities of compounds 1–12 are good (Figure S6, Sup- porting Information). Photoluminescent Properties The solid state photoluminescent properties of compounds 1, 3, and 9 were measured in the solid state at room tempera- ture (Figure 8). The main emission peaks of free H2L1,[7a] H2L2,[7b] mpy,[10] and tbpy[10] are at 448 nm (λex = 358 nm), 403 nm (λex = 289 nm), 399 nm (λex = 359 nm) and 401 nm (λex = 308 nm), respectively, which can be attributable to π*  n or π*  π transitions.[7,11] The fluorescent emissions are observed at 396 nm (λex = 301 nm) for 1 and 415 nm (λex = 310 nm) for 9. Due to their similar peaks, the emissions can be probably assigned to the intraligand charge transitions of mpy and tbpy, respectively.[12] Compared to the free ligands, compound 3 shows a weaker emission band at 442 nm (λex = 298 nm), which is mainly based on the luminescence of H2L1 ligand.[13] Thermal Analysis The thermal behaviors of compounds 1, 3, 6–9, and 11 were examined by TGA (Figure S7, Supporting Information).

For 9, the removal of water mole- cule occurred from 129 to 150 °C (obsd. 3.3%, calcd. 2.52%). Compound 11 released its free water molecules from room temperature to 95 °C (obsd. 4.6%, calcd. 5.91%). The remain- ing weight corresponds to the formation of CuO (obsd. 13.9%, calcd. 13.06%). Conclusions Twelve coordination compounds based on the semi-rigid bi- carboxylic acids H2L1 and H2L2 and neutral ligands were pre- pared and characterized. The investigations in this paper not only illustrate that the structural and compositional diversity of coordination compounds could be achieved by changing the central metals, neutral ligands, and carboxylate anions but also provide a series of examples of semi-rigid bicarboxylates for the design of novel frameworks. Experimental Section General Procedures: All reagents and solvents for syntheses were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. The ligands H2L1 and H2L2 were synthesized by the procedure described pre- viously.[7] The elemental analysis was conducted with a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. The FT-IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the range 4000–400 cm–1 on a Mattson Alpha-Centauri spec- trometer. The phase purities of the bulk samples were identied by X- ray powder diffraction with a Siemens D5005 diffractometer. The so- lid-state emission/excitation spectra were recorded with a FLSP920 Edinburgh Fluorescence Spectrometer at room temperature. TGA was performed with a Perkin-Elmer TG-7 analyzer heated from 25 to 600 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1.

KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 2223 Crystal Structural Determination: Crystallographic diffraction data for compounds 1–12 were recorded with a Oxford Diffraction Gemini R CCD with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K. Absorption corrections were applied using multi- scan technique. All the structures were solved by Direct Method of SHELXS-97 and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques using the SHELXL-97 program.[8] Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic temperature parameters. The disordered atoms in com- pounds 3 (O2W and O3W), 4 (O2W), 5 (O2W), and 12 (O3W) were refined using O atoms split over two sites, with a total occupancy of 1 or 0.5. Some aqua hydrogen atoms of compounds 3–5, 7, and 10– 12 could not positioned with difference Fourier maps. The hydrogen atoms attached to carbons were generated geometrically. Other hydrogen atoms of amine and water molecules were located from dif- ference Fourier maps and refined with isotropic displacement param- eters. For compound 6, the maximum residual electron density is 1.070 e·Å–3, which can be interpreted as Fourier truncation errors. Crystal data and structure refinement parameters for 1–12 are summa- rized in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3. Selected bond lengths and angles and hydrogen bonds for compounds are given in Tables S1 and S2 (Supporting Information).
