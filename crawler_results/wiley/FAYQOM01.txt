Deivaraj,[a] Wim T. Klooster,*[b] Garry J. McIntyre,*[c] and Jagadese J. Vittal*[a] Introduction Research in crystal engineering and the construction of co- ordination polymers with specific topologies has progressed in recent years by virtue of the possible design of materials with specific electronic, optic, magnetic, and catalytic prop- erties.[1] In spite of a few cases wherein the molecules are as- sembled in a predetermined fashion, prediction of the crys- tal structure is largely considered to be serendipitous.[2] This could be attributed to the poor understanding of the role played by various factors employed for the growth of the particular crystal, and other subtle attractive or repulsive forces that prevail in the crystal lattice.[3] Coordination poly- mers of various structural motifs such as one- (1D; e.g. linear chain, zigzag chain, helix, open ladder structures), two- (2D; e.g. square grid, brick wall, honeycomb,) and three-dimensional (3D; e.g. adamantanoid) are known to exist.[4] Of these, 1D coordination polymers are thought to be structurally the least interesting, but nevertheless have been found to have properties such as molecular ferromag- netism, synthetic metallic conductivity, and nonlinear optical response.[5] Moreover, noncovalent interactions between such 1D infinite chains can lead to the formation of interest- ing architectures.[6–8] For example, subtle differences in the noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds or Ag···Ag interactions in the compounds [Ag(3-amp)ClO4] and [Ag(4- amp)ClO4] (amp=aminomethylpyridine) lead to the forma- tion of a triple-helical coordination polymer or helical ladder, respectively.[5] On the other hand, rotaxanes and cat- enanes are, in all likelihood, considered as molecular ma- chines.[9,10] Many examples of coordination polyrotaxane networks have been reported;[11–14] however, to the best of our knowledge, hydrogen-bonded structures with polyrotax- ane-like interactions are rare.[15] The molecular Chinese blinds described by Sharma and Rogers can also be classi- [a] M.

Abstract: The reaction of 4,4’-bipyri- dylethane (bpe) and 4,4’-dipyridyl di- sulfide (dpds) with Zn(OAc)2·2H2O has led to the formation of two coordi- nation polymers, [Zn(OAc)2(m- bpe)]·2H2O (1) and [Zn(OAc)2(m- dpds)] (2). Both the compounds have zigzag coordination polymeric struc- tures as revealed by X-ray crystallogra- phy. However, the presence of two lat- tice water molecules in 1 results in an interesting difference between the crys- tal structures. In 1, the carboxylate car- bonyl oxygen atoms of the Zn(OAc)2 groups from two different adjacent zigzag polymers and four lattice water molecules form 24-membered hydro- gen-bonded rings (graph set notation, R6 6(24)). One of the two bpe ligands associated with each ZnII center passes through the center of this ring to form a two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded coordination polymeric structure. In the solid state, the adjacent 24-mem- bered hydrogen-bonded rings further fuse together through OH···O hydro- gen bonds among four waters to form cyclic (H2O)4. This results in a one-di- mensional hydrogen-bonded ribbon- like polymer comprising fused alternat- ing 24- and eight-membered OH···O hydrogen-bonded rings. One of the bpe ligands passes through the center of the larger ring to produce an unexpect- ed single self-penetrating three-dimen- sional hydrogen-bonded network with polyrotaxane-like association. A neu- tron diffraction study provides a de- tailed description of the hydrogen bonds involved.

KGaA, Weinheim 5853 FULL PAPER fied under this category,[16] and a new type of hydrogen- bonded polyrotaxane architecture was reported by Pudde- phatt and co-workers.[17] The structures of hydrogen-bonded water clusters and channels continue to attract interest since they play a crucial role in contributing to the stability and function of biological assemblies. Several theoretical calculations and experimen- tal evidence confirm the presence of water oligomers such as trimer, tetramer, pentamer, hexamer, octamer, and deca- mer.[18] Furthermore, many of these water oligomers and polymers have been stabilized by organic and inorganic hosts.[19] Herein we report the synthesis and structural characteri- zation of two 1D coordination polymers and their subse- quent formation of interesting but contrasting supramolec- ular architectures of general formula [Zn(OAc)2(m- bpe)]·2H2O (1) and [Zn(OAc)2(m-dpds)] (2) (bpe=4,4’-di- pyridylethane; dpds=4,4’-dipyridyl disulfide). Of these, one of the bpe ligands in the zigzag coordination polymer is en- cased by 24-membered hydrogen-bonded rings to furnish an unexpected polyrotaxane-like structure. These 24-membered rings are further fused with eight-membered tetrameric water clusters, (H2O)4, alternatively to form a 1D hydrogen- bonded ribbon-like polymeric structure of alternating 24- and eight-membered rings. These two structures also illus- trate the fact that the structurally similar spacer ligands can lead to interesting differences in the crystal structures of the compounds depending on the presence of solvent molecules and other noncovalent interactions. Interpenetrating network structures with polyrotaxane- like connectivities are not very common among hydrogen- bonded coordination polymers[20] and are only found abun- dantly in coordination polymeric network structures.[21] We have therefore decided to investigate the solid-state struc- ture of 1 in more detail by using neutron diffraction. Results and Discussion Compounds 1 and 2 were produced by reacting bpe and dpds with zinc acetate in the ratio of 1:1 in suitable solvents, and diffraction-quality single crystals were obtained by slow evaporation. The stoichiometry of these compounds was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Furthermore, thermogravimetry was used to confirm the number of water molecules in 1, and IR spectra were em- ployed to characterize the bonding mode of the acetate anion. The same 1:1 reaction mixture of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and bpe in a MeOH/acetonitrile solvent mixture gave a mix- ture of [Zn2(OAc)4(bpe)] and [Zn7(m4-O)2(OAc)10(bpe)].[22] Structure of [Zn(OAc)2(m-bpe)]·2H2O (1): The structure solved by X-ray crystallography is discussed here. A portion of the polymeric segment showing the coordination environ- ment around the ZnII center is shown in Figure 1. Each ZnII atom adopts a four-coordinate tetrahedral geometry, being coordinated to the nitrogen atoms of two crystallographical- ly different pyridyl groups and the oxygen atoms of the two acetate ligands. Two lattice water molecules are found in the asymmetric unit of 1, which are hydrogen-bonded to the other oxygen atoms of the two acetate anions as shown in Figure 1. In 1 the ZnII atom is bonded to two bridging bpe spacer ligands (Figure 2). Selected geometric parameters for 1 are given in Table 1. The two ZnO bond lengths are unequal at 1.922(3) and 1.949(3) M. Similarly, the ZnN distances are also not equal (2.044(3) and 2.010(3) M), and are slightly shorter than those reported for [(TPP)Zn]2(m-bpe)(C6H5- NO3)] (2.179(6) M)[23] and [Zn(m-bpe)(bpe)2(H2O)2]- (ClO4)2·bpe·H2O (2.151(3)–2.185(4) M).[24] The tetrahedral ZnII center is highly distorted as inferred from the bond angles, which range between 96.35(1) and 129.72(1)8. A crys- tallographic inversion center is present in the middle of each bpe spacer ligand. The interplanar angle between the pyridyl rings in bpe is 08 and the two pyridyl rings in bpe have an anti conformation with a C-CH2-CH2-C torsion angle of 1808. All the polymeric chains are aligned parallel to each other in the ab plane and propagate along the b direction.

J. 2004, 10, 5853 – 5859 5854 FULL PAPER chains are OH···O hydrogen-bonded to four lattice water molecules to form a 24-membered ring (with graphic set no- tation, R6 6(24)[25]; Figure 3). This ring has the shape of a dis- torted square in which the O(5)···O(5a) distance is 9.84 M and the O(6)···O(6a) distance is 7.73 M. Adjacent polymeric chains below the hydrogen-bonded rings are slip-stacked along the c direction such that one of the two bpe ligands goes through the center of the larger hydrogen-bonded ring (Figure 4). The side view of this penetration of the coordina- tion polymeric chain into the hydrogen-bonded ring is shown in Figure 5. It is clear that only the bpe ligand con- taining the N(2) atom goes through the center of the hydro- gen-bonded ring. The center of the two methylene groups of bpe coincides with the crystallographic inversion center present at the center of the hydrogen-bonded ring. Howev- er, the bond parameter found in this bpe ligand is very simi- lar to that with the atom N(1). The hydrogen-bonded poly- rotaxane-like structure in 1 (Scheme 1) forms a sheetlike structure approximately in the ab plane. These hydrogen- bonded rings are further fused with two eight-membered rings formed by four water molecules through OH···O hy- drogen bonds to generate a 1D hydrogen-bonded polymer that propagates approximately along the c direction (Figure 6). According to Infantes and co-workers, this hy- drogen-bonded tape can be described as T4(2)18(2).[26] In the poly-fused hydrogen-bonded polymer, the acceptors are the carboxylate carbonyl oxygen atoms of the Zn(OAc)2 and the hydrogen-donor group is the water tetramer, (H2O)4 (graph set notation, R4 4(8)).[25] In other words, the 2D hy- drogen-bonded structures are further linked through a cyclic quasi-planar water tetramer to provide a single self-pene- trating 3D hydrogen-bonded coordination polymeric struc- ture. Although hydrogen-bonded cyclic oligomers and poly- mers in various hosts have been described in the litera- Figure 3. Diagram showing the 24-membered hydrogen-bonded ring in 1.

On the other hand, the metal-containing hydrogen-bonded ring ob- served for 1 is a feature commonly observed in metal coor- dination polymeric structures.[20] The closest interplanar distances between the pyridyl groups of two adjacent bpe spacer ligands are in the range of 4.702(2)–4.844(2) M, indicating the absence of any p···p interactions between adjacent polymeric chains. The O H···O hydrogen bonds present in the crystal lattice for 1 are quite strong, to judge from the hydrogen-bond distances (Table 2), together with the results of the neutron study (see below). Recently Infantes and co-workers analyzed various extended motifs of water and chemical functional groups in organic molecular crystals by using the Cambridge Structur- al Database.[26] In their paper, an interesting tape-like struc- ture (with the notation T4(2)10(2))[28] formed between (H2O2)4 and two trifluoroacetate groups generates a 16- membered ring. In 1 this ring size has been increased to 24 owing to Zn(OAc)2 instead of the trifluroacetate groups. The size of the ring is large enough in 1 for a bpe ligand to pass through. On the other hand, in the structure of [H31O14] [CdCu2(CN)7], reported by Nishikiori and Iwamoto, each Cu2(CN)7 moiety is encircled by 12 hydrogen-bonded water molecules to form a 22-membered ring.[15] Neutron diffraction studies on 1: The distances and angles involving non-hydrogen atoms were more accurately ob- tained by the X-ray data, but none of the neutron values are significantly different, and the trends observed from the X- ray results are also obtained from the neutron data. Where neutron diffraction can make its contribution is when look- ing at the hydrogen atoms. Looking at the data recorded at 20 K, all hydrogen-bond distances are in the range 1.06(1)– 1.11(1) M for the main structure, and in the range 0.93(2)– 1.00(2) M for the water molecules. These are normal values. The angles involving H(1) through H(10) are in the range 115.8(8)–122.3(8)8, those involving H(11) through H(16) are in the range 107(1)–113(1)8, and those within the water mol- ecules are 102(1)8 and 108(1)8, all as to be expected. The latter are comparable to the angles of 105(4)8 and 103(4)8 obtained from the X-ray data. Of more interest is the hydrogen bonding. The O···O dis- tances are very similar to those obtained by X-ray diffrac- tion, and those involving the water molecules are in a narrow range: 2.73(1)–2.80(1) M and the H···O distances are in the range 1.77(1)–1.87(1) M (Table 2). These are fairly strong hydrogen bonds. The two hydrogen bonds that are almost linear (172(1)8 and 175(2)8) are those to the carboxy- late oxygen atoms, and the other angles are not far from being linear (157(1)8 and 168(1)8), so this configuration is close to optimal. The standard deviations from the neutron data involving distances of hydrogen atoms are only slightly better than those obtained from the X-ray data. But the positions them- selves should be more accurate, since the X-ray locations are biased by the non-spherical electron densities in the X H bonds, which results in a shortening of the XH bond of about 0.1 M, in this structure 0.12–0.19 M (Table 2), and cor- respondingly longer H···A distances. The standard deviations obtained from the neutron data for the angles are about a factor of 4 better than those obtained from the X-ray data. The quality of the crystal was not the best, as is not uncom- mon when growing (relatively) large crystals suitable for neutron diffraction. Also, as noted, the quality degraded fur- ther upon cooling, resulting in a refinement that was not op- timal. All this resulted in relatively high standard deviations. There are no other strong hydrogen bonds in the struc- ture. Some of the weaker interactions are: O(2)···H(4) (2.43(2) M) and O(2)···H(6) (2.45(1) M), and O(4)···H(7) (2.47(1) M). The only other potential hydrogen-bond accept- ors are O(1) and O(3), each of which has a weak intramo- lecular interaction with one of the methyl hydrogen atoms (O(1)···H(14B) 2.56(2) and O(3)···H(16C) 2.50(2) M). Structure of [Zn(OAc)2(m-dpds)]n (2): When the bpe ligand is replaced by dpds, the compound does not contain any water molecule and the structure as determined by X-ray crystallography was found to adopt the expected zigzag co- ordination polymer. A segment of the polymeric structure of 2 is shown in Figure 7. The ZnII center has the same ge- ometry and coordination environment as in 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for 2 are given in Table 3. The ZnO and ZnN bond lengths, and angles at the ZnII center are very similar to those found in 1. The C- S-S-C torsion angle in the dpds spacer ligand is 90.4(2)8 and the SS bond length is 2.0301(7) M. The C-S-S-C torsion angles in aromatic disulfide groups are known to be within about 208 of 908.[29,30] Thus, the disulfide moiety in the spacer ligand seems to maintain its characteristic shape even after bonding to the ZnII center. The two carbonyl oxygen atoms are involved in intramolecular CH···O bonding to Table 2. Hydrogen-bond parameters from X-ray and neutron diffraction data for 1.

The H···O distances vary from 2.374 to 2.563 M, which are considered to indicate very strong hydro- gen bonds.[31] In the crystal lattice, the 1D coordination polymeric strands propagate in the c direction and are stacked in such a way that the disulfide and the Zn(OAc)2 groups are below one another along the b direction (Figure 8). The bond lengths between the sulfur atom and the hydrogen atoms of methyl group between the adjacent polymer strands (3.545(2)–3.548(2) M) indicate that there is no CH···S hy- drogen bond interaction between the polymer strands. That the pyridine rings in each of the polymer strands are parallel to each other and the perpendicular distances between the rings are in the range of 4.823(2)–4.877(2) M appears to sug- gest that no p···p interaction is present between the adjacent polymer strands. It is interesting to observe that these linear polymers are aligned in parallel as found in 1. Conclusion Both bpe and dpds ligands form 1D polymeric structures with Zn(OAc)2 in the ratio 1:1. Although the two conformationally flexible dinitrogen spacer ligands are expected to give structurally similar poly- mers, the py-C-C-py fragment in 1 has an anti conformation with the torsion angle 1808, whereas the C-S-S-C group in 2 has syn geometry with a S-C-C-S torsion angle of 90.4(2)8, and an interplanar angle between the pyridine rings of 89.6(1)8. Owing to the turn at the -S-S- group, all the Zn(OAc)2 groups are on one side of the chain and the disul- fide groups are on the opposite side in 2. It is not clear from this study if the backbone of the spacer group dictates the incorporation of the lattice water molecules that is responsi- ble for the hydrogen-bonded ring pattern in 1 (Scheme 2). In the recently published crystal structure of [Zn(OAc)2- (bpy)], which contains yet another linear spacer ligand, namely 4,4’-bipyridyl (bpy), the 1D coordination polymer was found to adopt ladder (or rail road) geometry[32] with no solvent incorporated in the crystal structure. The unique feature of the hydrogen-bonded polyrotaxane-like structure is the role of a water tetramer, (H2O)4 to act as a hydrogen- bond donor which bonds to four different oxygen atoms of the Zn(OAc)2 groups to generate a 1D polymer containing alternate 24- and eight-membered fused hydrogen-bonded rings. The size of the R6 6(24) hydrogen-bonded ring is large enough to encapsulate one of the bpe ligands in a rotaxane- like fashion. The neutron diffraction study of 1 is the first report of its kind on a 3D hydrogen-bonded network with polyrotaxane-like structures. Experimental Section General remarks: All starting materials were purchased from Aldrich and were used without further purification. Elemental analyses were car- ried out at the Microanalysis Laboratory of the National University of Singapore and the yields are reported with respect to the metal salts. In- frared data were collected on a Bio-Rad FTIR spectrophotometer using the KBr pellet method. Thermogravimetric analysis of 1 was performed (under N2 atmosphere) using a SDT 2980 TGA Thermal Analyzer instru- ment with a sample size of about 10 mg.

X-ray crystallographic study: The diffraction experiments were carried out on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer with a MoKa sealed tube at 238C. The program SMART[33] was used for collecting frames of data, indexing reflections, and determination of lattice parameters, the pro- gram SAINT[33] was used for integration of the intensity of reflections and scaling. SADABS[34] was used for absorption correction, and SHELXTL[35] for determining the space group and the structure and least-squares refinements on F2. The positional and isotropic thermal pa- rameters of hydrogen atoms associated with lattice water molecules in 1 were varied in the least-squares refinements. Relevant crystallographic data are listed in Table 4. Neutron diffraction experiments: Neutron diffraction data were collected on VIVALDI, at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL), Grenoble, France. VIVALDI uses the Laue diffraction technique on an unmonochromated thermal-neutron beam and with a large solid-angle (8 sterad) cylindrical image-plate detector, to increase the detected diffracted intensity by one- to-two orders of magnitude compared with a conventional monochromat- ic experiment.[36] A colorless crystal of 1, with well-developed faces and maximum dimensions 1.7P0.9P0.6 mm3, volume ~0.5 mm3, was selected, wrapped in aluminum foil with some silicon grease, and mounted on a vanadium pin. Seven Laue diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature, at 308 intervals around the vertical axis perpendicular to the incident neutron beam, each exposure lasting 4.5 h. Another seven pat- terns were collected with a different vertical orientation of the crystal. At a later date the crystal was cooled to 20 K, and 18 patterns were collected at 108 intervals around the vertical axis with an average exposure of 2.2 h. The diffraction patterns were indexed by using the program LAUE- GEN[37,38] and the reflections were integrated by using a 2D version of the s(I)/I algorithm described by Wilkinson et al.[39] and Prince et al.[40] No absorption correction was deemed necessary because of the small size of the crystal. The reflections were normalized to the same incident wavelength, using a curve derived by comparing equivalent reflections and multiple observations, by usingf the program LAUENORM.[41] Only reflections with wavelengths between 0.9 and 2.8 M were accepted in the normalization procedure, as reflections outside this range were too weak or had too few equivalents to be able to determine the normalization curve with confidence. The total number of observed reflections accepted at 295 K was 7992, which were averaged to give 2192 unique reflections (Rint=0.0264), of which 1622 have F2>1.5s(F2) There were 13062 ob- served reflections accepted at 20 K, which were averaged to give 3100 unique reflections (Rint=0.265), 1906 with F2>1.5s(F2). The resulting in- tensities were used in full-matrix least-squares refinement using UPALS.[42] Preliminary refinements indicated negligible extinction, and this correction was thenceforth omitted. In the final refinement at 295 K, the scale factor, the positional and anisotropic parameters for all atoms were refined, 424 variables in all. The diffraction patterns taken at 20 K indicated that the quality had degraded slightly after cooling, with a lot of spots quite elongated. Nevertheless, the refinement at 20 K resulted in an excellent structure using isotropic displacement parameters, 189 varia- bles in all. The R values obtained from the refinements are fairly large, but this reflects the small crystal volume and the large proportion of weak data finally accepted. The values of the goodness-of-fit are however close to 1.0, which indicates that lower R factors cannot be expected. The structural conclusions drawn from the data at 295 K and 20 K are identi- cal, and only the results from the more extensive 20 K data are quoted in Table 2. A summary of the crystal, data collection, and refinement pa- rameters is given in Table 4. The absolute scale of the unit-cell lengths cannot be determined in the white-beam Laue method; a was fixed to the value determined by X-ray diffraction at 223 K at both 295 K and 20 K. In view of the typical thermal expansion of organic materials the neutron hydrogen-bond lengths quoted in Table 2 are overestimated by less than 1.5%, itself similar to the observed estimated standard devia- tions in the bond lengths.[43] CCDC 240080–240083 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for 1 and 2 discussed in this paper.
