Nine CuII coordination compounds based on 4,4'-bi-1,2,4- triazole (btr), [Cu2(N-btr)2(OAc)4]·4H2O (1), [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)2- (H2O)2][CdBr4(H2O)]·3H2O (2), [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)2(H2O)2]S2O6·4H2O (3), [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)2(H2O)2](NO3)2·2H2O (4), [Cu2(N1,N1'-btr)2(μ3- btr)2(NO3)2](NO3)2·2H2O (5), [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)2(DMF)2](NO3)2· 2C2H5OH (6), [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)3](CF3CO2)2 (7), [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)2(N- btr)2](CCl3CO2)2·5H2O (8), [Cu3(μ2-OH)2(μ4-btr)(μ3-btr)2(N1,N1'- btr)(H2O)(CF3CO2)](CF3CO2)3·4H2O (9), were synthesized by reac- tion of btr with the corresponding CuII salts in aqueous or DMF/etha- Introduction For recent years, the coordination chemistry of bi-1,2,4-tria- zole ligands was intensively explored in the context of design and synthesis of novel coordination polymers with unique functionalities such as magnetic properties [1–5], spin-cross- over [6], optic [7], sorption [3] etc. This interest is stipulated by various coordination modes of bitriazoles that could bridge the corresponding metal centers in different motifs, including polynuclear clusters. The simplest ligand of this subclass is 4,4'-bi-1,2,4-triazole (btr), which normally adopts twisted con- formation (the torsion angle between triazole fragments can vary in the range of 60–90 °) and so allows five different pos- sibilities for the realization of metal-ligand interactions, such as mono- [2, 5, 8, 9], two bi- (N1,N1'- [2, 5–7, 9–15] and N1,N2- [10, 16]), tri- [5, 17, 18] and tetradentate [18] coordi- nation modes providing a rich family of metal-organic frame- works (Table 1). The resultant structural topology of MOFs is defined by means of crucial relationships between several fac- tors involving electron-donor abilities of btr, anions and sol- vent molecules on the one hand, and the nature of the metal * Dr. A.

The coordination behavior of btr, which changes from sim- ple monodentate, to N1,N1'-bi-, tri- and tetradentate binding modes, and the influence of the counteranions lead to a structural variety of the coordination compounds, ranging from molecular “Chinese lan- terns” of type 1, through 2D square grids (2–4, 6, 8) and 3D octahedral networks (7), to 3D eight-connected frameworks (5, 9) that based on the dinuclear [Cu2(trz)2]4+ and linear trinuclear [Cu3(μ2-OH)2(H2O)2]4+ units as nodes. atom on the other hand. However, only a few articles were focused on such influences and interactions [5, 17, 18]. The inherent lability of CuII compounds stipulating the various top- ological behaviors of CuII/btr systems is also interesting and important because of their magnetism [5]. By analyzing the results shown in Table 1, we could assume the existence of an anion-dependent assembly of coordination polymers with btr. Thus, the use of uncoordinated counteranions (e.g., BF4 –) re- sulted in formation of 2D square grids or 3D octahedral net- works, whereas the involvement of more strongly coordinating anions like Cl– or OH– lead to polymeric rods or the most intriguing 3D motifs based on multinuclear secondary building blocks as nodes, e.g., [Cu3(μ3-OH)]5+. In general, we tried to expand the concept of anion-directed assembly of CuII-btr coordination polymers; herein we report the synthesis of new coordination compounds. Their crystal structures show the anion-dependent character and could be “tuned” by changing the nature of the anion (charge, molecular size, symmetry, basicity and donating ability) (Scheme 1). Results and Discussion Btr predominantly acts as a N1,N1’ bidentate (~9 Å) bridg- ing ligand, whereas the possibility of short connection (~3.5 Å), realized through the N1,N2-coordination mode, is exceptional and was so far unknown. Non-planar disposition of two triazole heterocycles together with four accessible nitro- gen-donor atoms allows the realization of high-dimensional motifs based on polynuclear units.

Additional axial joining of monodentate btr molecules [Cu(1)–N(1) 2.1464(16) Å] com- pletes a tetragonal-pyramidal environment of the copper atoms and contributes to their displacement of ~0.193 Å out of the plane of four acetate oxygen atoms. A similar situation was observed in the structure of [Cu2(μ2-CH3COO)4(admtrz)2] (admtrz = 4-amino-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,4-triazole) [19]. Thus, the electron-donating properties of the 1,2,4-triazole ligands ap- pear to be significantly less pronounced in comparison to ace- tate, however this is not the case for some series of copper(II) pivalate/1,2,4-triazole complexes that tend to demonstrate polynuclear behavior [20].

In crystal structures 2–4 and 6, the N1,N1’-bidentate btr mol- ecules link copper atoms along two directions [Cu–N 1.992(4)–2.0393(16) Å] separating the neighboring metal at- oms within the layer at the distances of ~8.92–9.22 Å, whereas two trans axial positions are occupied by terminal solvent mol- ecules, e.g. water [Cu–O 2.3069(16)–2.415(4) Å; 2–4] or DMF [Cu–O 2.3480(14) Å; 6]. The interaction of Сu(NO3)2 and btr in aqueous solution could be assumed as a two step process with crystallization A. B. Lysenko et al. ARTICLE Figure 3.

Compound 5, [Cu2(btr)4(NO3)2](NO3)2·2H2O, has a 3D eight-connected framework with CsCl topology based on dinuclear cluster mo- tifs (see Supporting Information) [5]. Orthogonal conformation of both triazole fragments in btr [21] results in a specific deviation of the N–Cu bonding vec- tors from the straight line generating two kinds of (4,4)-nets in 3 and 6; one with corrugated square pores (Figure 3A), the second consists of flattened layers with rectangular pores hav- 212 www.zaac.wiley-vch.de © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The interlayer distances are regulated by means of the anion size: from NO3 – through S2O6 2– to [CdBr4(H2O)]2–. ing curved walls (Figure 3B). The corresponding net confor- mation depends on multiple weak interactions. Thus, in dithi- onate complex 3, the equal set of weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, С(3)–H(3)···O(4) 2.335(2) Å, ÐC(3)–H(3)···O(4)b) 141.39(14)°, b): 0.5–x, 0.5–y, 2–z, [22]; and anion-π contacts, O(2)···N(3)(trz) = 2.82 Å, O(2)···centroid of trz = 2.99 Å and Anion Tuning of Cu(II)/4,4'-Bi-1,2,4-Triazole Coordination Polymers ÐO(2)–(centroid)–(trz plain) ~70.6° [23–26]) influences each ligand on different sides that stipulate straight form of edges and approximately equal distances between their centers (9.37 and 9.70 Å, Figure 3A). In compound 6, each btr molecule is involved in three weak contacts, which act approximately along one direction: π-ani- onic [distance O(2)···N(6)(trz) = 2.985 Å, O(2)···centroid of trz = 2.99 Å and ÐO(3)–(centroid)–(trz plane) ~78.5°] as well as two hydrogen bonds [С(4)c)–H(4)c)···O(3) 2.503(3) Å and С(2)–H(2)···O(2) 2.449(2) Å, ÐC(2)–H(2)···O(3) 175.96(12)°], leading to corrugation of the square planar nets with signifi- cantly different distances between two opposite centers of the edges (6.51 and 11.73 Å, Figure 3B). A similar configuration is observed for the topologically identical nitrate complex 4. Obviously, the crystal packing of 2D nets in compounds 2– 4 and 6 depends on the size of the counteranions as well as on the nature of the axially-coordinated molecules. Small anions, such as dithionate (3) and nitrate (4), settle into the square or rectangular voids of the nets leading to relatively short distan- ces between the neighboring layers, 6.43 and 5.91 Å, respec- tively (Figure 4A, B). In the crystal structure of 2, the larger [CdBr4(H2O)]2– anion is localized between the sheets, which imposes a more intensive corrugation with a larger interlayer separation of ~7.64 Å (Figure 4C). An additional factor regulating the interlayer distances in- volves the size of the axially coordinated solvent molecules; the substitution of water molecules by DMF increases the in- terplanar spacing from 5.91 (4) to 9.44 Å (6). Unlike the previous cases, the coordination compound [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)3](CF3COO)2 (7) contains two independent copper atoms with CuN6 btr pseudo-octahedral environment [Cu–N 2.0099(19)–2.423(2) Å]. Copper atoms of the same type are linked by means of btr ligands into 2D nets (Cu(1)···Cu(1) = Cu(2)···Cu(2), ~8.745 Å), parallel to the bc Figure 5. Two independent pseudo-octahedral Cu1 and Cu2 centers are linked by N1,N1'-bidentate btr molecules into 3D coordination framework in the crystal structure of 7. Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2010, 209–217 © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 213 plane (Figure 5). Furthermore, the planes formed by Cu(1) or Cu(2) atoms are alternately connected by btr molecules into a 3D framework with α-polonium-like topology (the adjacent Cu(1)···Cu(2) distance is equal to ~8.623 Å). The intercon- nected orthogonal channels are filled by uncoordinated CF3COO– anions. As far as the calculated crystal volume for CF3COO– (86.3 Å3) is almost equal to that of the ClO4 – anion (~82 Å3) [27], the corresponding complexes [Cu(N1,N1'- btr)3](CF3COO)2 (7) and [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)3](ClO4)2 [5] have similar structures. Thus, the volume of the anions seems to be the main factor that defines the octahedral framework in these cases. Taking into account the crystal volume of the counterions, it was interesting to find dramatical changes in the crystal struc- ture of [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)2(btr)2](CCl3CO2)2·5H2O (8), contain- ing significantly larger counteranions, CCl3CO2 –, with a vol- ume of ~128 Å3 (Figure 6). In this case, the pseudo octahedral CuN6 btr environment is completed by means of two terminal [Cu–N 2.047(2) Å] and two N1,N1'-bridging btr (Figure 6) that dictates the formation of 2D layered networks. The closest layers, separated at the distance of ~11.43 Å, are shifted, lead- ing to an interdigitation of the successive nets and to the exis- tence of π-stacking interactions between uncoordinated tria- zolyl species.

Recently, we demonstrated that such secondary building blocks form be- cause of a synergic effect of dual coordination with short ani- ons and η2-trz [17, 18]. However, the coordination polymers with linear tricopper motifs could be realized not only in the A. B. Lysenko et al. ARTICLE presence of chloride-bridges, but also in the case of hydroxide- anions. Thus, interaction of Cu(CF3CO2)2 with btr in water under hydrolytic conditions led to a 3D coordination polymer (9) containing the integrated linear hydroxo-trimers [Cu3(μ2- OH)2(η2-trz)4] (Figure 7, Table 3).

The peripheral metal atoms [Cu(1) and Cu(3)] possess cis-N4O2 configuration. The equatorial sites of the Cu(3) atom are filled by a hydroxide bridge [Cu–O 1.8965(18) Å] and three nitrogen atoms [btr, Cu–N 2.000(3)– 2.065(2) Å], whereas one water molecule [Cu(3)–O(5) 2.483(4) Å] and one nitrogen atom of btr [Cu(3)–N(11) 2.443(3) Å] are in axial positions. The environment of Cu(1) differs from Cu(3) only by coordination of the CF3CO2 – anion [Cu(1)–O(3) 2.461(3) Å]. The presence of the short OH– bridges decreases the distance between neighboring copper at- oms within the [Cu3(μ2-OH)2] cluster (Cu···Cu ~3.28 Å) in comparison to that of the [Cu3(μ2-Cl)2] motifs [17]. Similar contraction was observed for linear [Cu3(μ2-OH)2] SBU sup- ported by p-phenylene-bi(1,2,4,-triazole) [28]. Coordination compound 9 is the first example, in which the bitriazole mole- cules are involved in three coordination modes within the same structure: N1,N1'-bi-, tri- and tetradentate in the ratio of 1:2:1. The last two modes support the linear tricopper fragments, whereas bi- and tridentate ligands propagate the SBUs into 2D nets with (3,6) topology (Figure 7B) and the μ4-btr molecules pillar the trigonal nets (Figure 7C), connecting them into a 3D coordination framework. Conclusions We demonstrated the anion dependent assembly of CuII-btr coordination compounds, in which the uncoordinated anions {[CdBr4(H2O)]2–, S2O6 2– and CCl3COO–} afford formation of 2D square grids and 3D octahedral networks with mono- and N1,N1’-bidentate btr, whereas short nucleophilic anions (e.g., OH–) show significant impact on the donating behavior of btr resulting in linear trinuclear clusters tightly integrated in the polymeric motifs by means of μ3- and μ4- btr functionalities. These approaches could be utilized in the context of rational design of the coordination networks with the desired topolo- gies and properties. Experimental Section Bitriazole (btr) was prepared by reaction of 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole and dimethylformamide azine [29]. Syntheses [Cu(N-btr)2(OAc)4]·4H2O (1): Btr (68 mg, 0.50 mmol) and Сu(OAc)2·H2O (100 mg, 0.50 mmol) were dissolved in water (3.5 mL). The solution was concentrated at ~90 °C to a volume of about 0.5 mL. The resultant dark-green solution was kept in the refrig- erator at ~ –15 °C for a few days, after which the product was obtained as green rhombic crystals (Yield 44 %). [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)2(H2O)2]S2O6·4H2O (3): Solutions of CuS2O6·6H2O (31.4 mg, 0.095 mmol) and btr (13.6 mg, 0.10 mmol) in water were mixed. A precipitate formed immediately.

(Yield 65 %). [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)2(H2O)2](NO3)2·2H2O (4): The ligand btr (13.6 mg, 0.10 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (23.2 mg, 0.10 mmol) were solved in H2O (2 mL). Well-shaped blue crystals of 4 formed upon standing within a few hours. (Yield ~30 %). The product quantitatively trans- forms into dark-blue crystals of [Cu2(N1,N1'-btr)2(μ3- btr)2(NO3)2](NO3)2·2H2O (5) during a day. Analogously, blue-green crystals of [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)2(H2O)2] [CdBr4(H2O)] 3H2O (2) were ob- tained, using equivalent amounts of btr, CdBr2 and CuBr2.

The light-blue prisms of the product formed upon standing for a week (Yield 55%). [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)3](CF3COO)2 (7): Slow evaporation of a solution of btr (13.6 mg, 0.10 mmol) and Cu(CF3COO)2·6H2O (29.0 mg, 0.10 mmol) in water (2 mL) yielded blue needles of 7 within a week (Yield 50%). [Cu3(μ2-OH)2(μ4-btr)(μ3-btr)2(N1,N1'-btr)(H2O)(CF3CO2)]- (CF3CO2)3·4H2O (9): Cu(CF3COO)2·6H2O (29 mg, 0.10 mmol) and btr (13.6 mg, 0.10 mmol) were solved in water and the resulting mix- ture was heated to 90–100 °C. The color of the solution changed from blue into green. Green crystals of the product precipitated within a week. (Yield 60 %). Analogously, [Cu(N1,N1'-btr)2(N-btr)2]- (CCl3CO2)2·5H2O (8) was synthesized using Cu(CCl3COO)2·6H2O in- stead of Cu(CF3CO2)2·6H2O. (Yield 80 %).

The refined partial occu- pancy factors were 0.88 and 0.12. Only atoms of the major component were refined anisotropically. In structure 6, the ethanol solvate mole- cule is equally disordered over two positions. The atoms were refined anisotropically and the hydrogen atoms were not added to this disor- dered molecule. In structure 7, both unique CF3CO2 – anions are disor- dered over two overlapping positions. The disorder was resolved with partial contributions 0.60/0.40 and 0.50/0.50 and a set of soft restraints for arrangement and anisotropic thermal parameters. In structure 9, the CF3CO2 – anions and solvate water molecules are badly disordered in- side the crystal cages. Only one weakly coordinated anion and one water molecule were located and refined isotropically considering also rotational disorder of the trifluoromethyl group. The remaining elec- tron density in the structure was successfully modeled using a Squeeze routine as it implemented in PLATON [31]. In all structures, CH hy- drogen atoms were placed in calculated positions with isotropic U val- ues at 1.2 times (1.5 for methyl groups) of equivalent isotropic U value of the corresponding carbon atom. In structures 1–4 and 8, hydrogen atoms of all water molecules were located and then fixed with Uiso = 1.5Ueq (O), whereas for 5 all the hydrogen atoms were located and refined isotropically.
