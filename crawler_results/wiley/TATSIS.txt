Pradip Pachfule,[a] Yifei Chen,[b] Jianwen Jiang,[b] and Rahul Banerjee*[a] Introduction In recent years researchers have made attempts to replace traditional fossil-fuel-based energy sources due to increasing global warming and the greenhouse effect. One of the po- tential “green” energy sources, the fuel cell,[1] is dependent on hydrogen as a fuel. In this regard, metal–organic frame- works[2] (MOFs) have shown excellent performance over other porous materials, such as carbon nanotubes, zeolites, activated carbon, and metal hydrides,[3] in storing hydrogen at low, as well as high, pressure. MOFs also possess a wide array of applications like CO2 capture and gas separation,[4] catalysis,[5] multiferroics,[6] and drug delivery.[7] Researchers have introduced several modifications, for example the in- troduction of open metal sites, framework catenation, doping with alkali metals, and ligand functionalization, to improve the H2 and CO2 uptake in MOFs.[8] Functionalized links having uncoordinated functional groups, such as F, NH2, OH, and COOH, on the organic spacer can also en- hance the H2 and CO2 gas adsorption properties by increas- ing ligand-to-gas molecule interactions and adsorption en- thalpy (Qst) in MOFs.[9] Usage of fluorinated links to im- prove the Qst value in MOFs has caught researchers atten- tion in recent years.[10,11] Previous attempts by Yang et al.[10a,b] and Cheetham and co-workers[10d,e] showed that fluorinated MOFs (F-MOFs) can take up large amounts of H2 due to a higher Qst value. On the other hand, the report by Kim et al.[11a] contradicts the aforementioned statement as they showed that fluorination in MOFs does not always result in increased gas uptake, due to a decrease in pore size in the resulting MOFs. Recently, we have shown that en- hancement of H2 adsorption due to fluorination in MOFs is not a universal phenomenon, but is rather system-specific and can differ from system to system.[11b] So, as it stands at this moment, it is very difficult to analyze the effect of fluo- rination on the H2 and CO2 uptake capacity of MOFs, as there are hardly any data on gas adsorption in isostructural fluorinated and nonfluorinated MOFs.[10i,11a] Herein, for the first time using a set of isostructural fluorinated and non- fluorinated MOFs, we report the effect of fluorine insertion on H2 and CO2 adsorption. This type of isostructural isomer- ism, in which isomers retain their structural similarity before and after functionalization, is very rare in the literature and has not been reported in F-MOFs so far. The solvothermal reaction of CoACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·6H2O with iso- ACHTUNGTRENUNGnicotinic acid (INA) resulted in the formation of Co-INA-1 ([Co3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(INA)4(O)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(C2H5OH)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[NO3]·C2H5OH·3H2O), when the solvent is ethanol, and Co-INA-2 ([CoACHTUNGTRENUNG(INA)2]·DMF) when the solvent is DMF (Scheme 1). To make a valid com- parison between fluorinated and nonfluorinated MOFs, we synthesized fluorinated analogues of Co-INA-1 and Co- INA-2 with fluorinated ligand 3-fluoroisonicotinic acid (FINA) and CoACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·6H2O. The resulting MOFs, Co- FINA-1 ([Co3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(FINA)4(O)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(C2H5OH)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)]) and Co-FINA- 2 ([CoACHTUNGTRENUNG(FINA)2]·H2O), could be obtained respectively from ethanol and DMF (see Section S1 in the Supporting Infor- Abstract: The synthesis, structure, and gas adsorption properties of three new metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) de- signed from isonicotinic acid (INA) and its fluorinated analogue 3-fluoro- ACHTUNGTRENUNGisonicotinic acid (FINA) along with CoII as the metal center have been re- ported. Co-INA-1 ([Co3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(INA)4(O)- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(C2H5ACHTUNGTRENUNGOH)3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG[NO3]·C2H5OH·3H2O; INA=isonicotinic acid) and Co-INA-2 ([CoACHTUNGTRENUNG(INA)2]·DMF) are structural iso- mers as are Co-FINA-1 ([Co3- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(FINA)4(O)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(C2H5OH)2]·H2O; FINA= 3-fluoroisonicotinic acid) and Co- FINA-2 ([CoACHTUNGTRENUNG(FINA)2]·H2O), but the most important thing to note here is that Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1 are iso- structural as are Co-INA-2 and Co- FINA-2. The effect of partial introduc- tion of fluorine atoms into the frame- work on the gas uptake properties of MOFs having similar structures has been analyzed experimentally and computationally in isostructural MOFs.

Co-INA-1 and -2 are structural isomers as are Co- FINA-1 and -2, but the most important thing to note here is that Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1 are isostructural as are Co- INA-2 and Co-FINA-2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of isostructural isomerism in a set of non- fluorinated and fluorinated MOFs. Results and Discussion The isostructural Co-INA-1[12] and Co-FINA-1 crystallize in the Pnma space group with 8-connected, hydroxy [Co3(OH)] and oxo-centered [Co3(O)] type secondary bind- ing unit (SBU),[13] respectively, in which open metal sites could be perceived. The structural details of Co-INA-1 have been reported elsewhere, so we will focus on the structural details of the isostructural Co-FINA-1 only. Each [Co3(O)] metal cluster of Co-FINA-1 is connected to eight FINA li- gands through four bridging m2-COO groups, four pyridyl nitrogen atoms, two coordinated ethanol molecules, and one coordinated water molecule (Figure 1 and Section S5 in the Supporting Information). Each trimetal cluster is connected to the eight similar trimetal SBUs resulting in a highly con- nected 3D framework. In Co-FINA-1, two types of pores are available: through the a axis one-dimensional channels with an aperture of 4.2  propagate (Figure 1b), whereas through the c axis square-shaped channels of 3.22.8  di- mensions extend through the crystal structure (Figure 1c). The metal sites are coordinated to the EtOH and water mol- ecules pointing towards the pores, which in turn can create open metal sites. In each trimetal oxo center [Co3(O)], two metal centers possess an identical coordination sphere (t= o),[14] in which each CoII connects to three m2-carboxyl oxygen atoms, one nitrogen atom from the FNIA ligand, one ethanol molecule, and one central m3-oxygen atom. The remaining (third) CoII metal center is connected to two m2- carboxyl oxygen atoms, two FNIA pyridyl nitrogen atoms, one coordinating water molecule, and one central m3-oxygen atom. In the crystal structure of Co-INA-1, due to the pres- ence of the [Co3(OH)] metal cluster, an additional positive charge on the central tetracoordinated oxygen atom is bal- anced by the NO3  ions present in the pores. However, in the case of Co-FINA-1, the metal cluster itself is neutral [Co3(O)], which diminishes the possibility of the presence of NO3  ions in the pores. The crystal structure of Co-INA-1 has a higher porosity (5.0 ) and solvent-accessible void (39.0%)[15] than Co-FINA-1 (4.2  and 34.5%) calculated by using PLATON,[16] due to the smaller atomic size of hy- drogen atoms than fluorine atoms (Section S5 in the Sup- porting Information). The crystal structure of Co-INA-2 and Co-FINA-2 con- sists of doubly bridged infinite CoII carboxylate chains (Fig- ure 2a and Section S5 in the Supporting Information). The pyridine functionalities of the INA and FINA ligands point outwards from the chains (Figure 2b). The resulting strands cross-link by N–Co coordination to generate the 3D frame- work. In Co-INA-2, each CoII metal center connects to the four INA ligands through one of their m2-carboxyl oxygen atoms and two INA ligands through their pyridyl nitrogen atoms (Figure 2c). Each SBU connects to the next through INA ligands to generate the 3D structure. Co-INA-2 has 2.43.1  square-shaped pores with 8.9% solvent-accessible void,[15] where uncoordinated water molecules are sitting inside the pores. Like isostructural Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA- 1, the structures of Co-INA-2 and Co-FINA-2 are also iso- structural. Comparison between the cell dimensions for the Co-INA-2 (a=9.819, b=12.649, c=11.073 ) and Co- FINA-2 (a=4.962, b=12.359, c=11.816 ) reveals that al- though the b and c axes are similar in dimensions, the a axis of the Co-INA-2 unit cell is approximately double that of Co-FINA-2 (doubling of the a axis is expected from the ran- domization/disorder of the pyridine ring orientations in the Co-INA-2 structure).[17] The unit cell volume of the Co- FINA-2 crystal structure (698.9 A3) is 51% that of Co-INA- Scheme 1.

Co-FINA-2 has bigger pore dimensions (2.4 4.1 ) compared to Co-INA-2 (2.43.1 ), although in the former case fluorine atoms are pointing into pores. Also, Co-FINA-2 (14.5%) has a higher solvent-accessible void than Co-INA-2 (8.9%),[15] although the latter has a higher cell volume and cell dimensions (Section S5 in the Support- ing Information). We performed powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) to con- firm the phase purity of the bulk samples. All major peaks of experimental PXRD patterns matched well with simulat- ed PXRD patterns, thus indicating their reasonable crystal- line phase purity (Figures S1–S4 in the Supporting Informa- tion). The experimental PXRD patterns of Co-FINA-1 and -2 have few diffraction lines that are unindexed and some that are slightly broadened in comparison to the simulated pattern. This is probably because of the loss of DMF mole- cules from the lattice due to grinding at the time of sample preparation. Also, for the purpose of checking the frame- work architecture and thermal stability of Co-FINA-1, Co- FINA-2, and Co-INA-2, we performed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of these samples. From TGA it was revealed that these compounds have high thermal stability. The TGA traces of as-synthesized Co-INA-2, Co-FINA-1, and Co- FINA-2 showed a gradual weight-loss step of 11.5% (20– 2008C), 19.5% (20–1408C), and 8.75% (20–1608C), respec- tively, corresponding to the escape of DMF, EtOH, and H2O guest and coordinated solvent molecules from the pores (Figures S11–S13 in the Supporting Information). The framework of Co-FINA-1 is stable up to 4008C although co- ordinated and guest solvent molecules leave the framework at 1408C. Above 4008C the Co-FINA-1 framework decom- poses with sharp weight loss. The framework of Co-FINA-2 has more stability than that of Co-INA-2. Co-FINA-2 is stable up to 3008C, whereas Co-INA-2 is stable up to 2508C. This is followed by a sharp weight loss, probably due to the decomposition of the frameworks. Analysis of the crystal structure of Co-FINA-1, Co-FINA- 2, and Co-INA-2 reveals that these MOFs are porous with moderate solvent-accessible voids, despite the presence of protruding fluorine atoms in the pores of Co-FINA-1 and -2. Unlike Co-FINA-1 and Co-INA-1, Co-FINA-2 possesses a larger pore size and solvent-accessible void than nonfluori- nated Co-INA-2. These results motivated us to study the N2, H2, and CO2 adsorption of these MOFs. Prior to gas sorp- tion experiments, guest and possibly coordinated solvent molecules were removed by solvent exchange and thermal activation at an optimized temperature of 1508C, under ul- trahigh vacuum. The permanent porosity of Co-FINA-1, Co- FINA-2, and Co-INA-2 was confirmed by N2 adsorption iso- therms, as these MOFs have a pore size comparable to the kinetic diameter of N2 (3.6 ). All these MOFs show rever- sible type-I N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K (Figure 3a). Co-FINA-1 has BET and Langmuir surface areas of 547.3 and 841.6 m2g1, respectively, which are higher than those of its nonfluorinated isostructural analogue Co-INA-1[12] (Langmuir surface area=544 m2g1). Although, Co-FINA-1 has smaller pores than Co-INA-1, it shows higher surface area possibly due to the high stability of the framework. It has been mentioned in the literature that Co-INA-1, due to the slight shrinkage and/or partial collapse of the coordina- tion framework after removing all coordinated and lattice solvents, shows a smaller Langmuir surface area.[12] In con- trast, the Co-FINA-1 framework remains intact even after Figure 2.

Banerjee et al. solvent removal, due to the presence of fluorine atoms.[10b,i] Also, possibly due to presence of NO3  ions in the pores of Co-FINA-1, the pores get blocked and less accessible for ni- trogen adsorption. Co-INA-2 shows 92.6 and 157.0 m2g1 of BET and Langmuir surface area, respectively, whereas its fluorinated isostructural analogue Co-FINA-2 has higher BET (152.8 m2g1) and Langmuir surface areas (238.3 m2g1), as shown in Figure 3a. The higher surface area of Co-FINA-2 than Co-INA-2 is justified as the former has the larger pores with higher solvent-accessible void. It is noteworthy that for Co-FINA-1 and -2, fluorine insertion has increased the surface area relative to the nonfluorinated analogues. Further, as we confirmed the permanent porosity of Co- INA-2, Co-FINA-1, and Co-FINA-2, we collected the H2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms for these MOFs. All these MOFs showed reversible type-I isotherms at 77 K (H2) and 298 K (CO2) and 1.01 bar pressure. In addition, the absence of adsorption–desorption hysteresis indicates that H2 and CO2 are reversibly adsorbed by all the MOFs reported here. At 77 K, Co-FINA-1 adsorbs the highest amount of H2 in this series (1.97 wt%; see Table 1) as the pressure ap- proaches 1.01 bar (Figure 3b). At 77 K, Co-INA-1 adsorbs an similar amount of H2, showing 1.90 wt% uptake as the pressure approaches 1.01 bar (as reported in the litera- ture).[12] Similarly, Co-FINA-2 shows 0.82 wt% H2 uptake at 77 K and 1.01 bar pressure, whereas Co-INA-2, which is iso- structural with Co-FINA-2, adsorbs the lowest amount of H2 (0.52 wt%) in this series, as shown in Figure 3b. Although Co-FINA-1 has smaller pores than Co-INA-1, it shows a higher surface area, as well as higher H2 adsorption. A pos- sible reason could be the aforementioned logic of pore shrinkage due to loss of coordinated solvent molecules, with evacuation and pore blocking due to free NO3  ions present in Co-INA-1. At higher pressure, Co-FINA-1 could possibly show a higher H2 uptake due to its higher surface area, as it has a more rigid framework than Co-INA-1. The simulation results of H2 adsorption in Co-FINA-1 agree fairly well with the experimental data. In Co-INA-1, however, the calculat- ed results underestimate the experimental data at low pres- sures, but overestimate them at high pressures. Comparing the simulation results in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1, Co- INA-1 has a higher H2 adsorption over the entire pressure range. H2 uptake in Co-FINA-2 and Co-INA-2 is well justi- fied as Co-FINA-2 has much larger pores (2.44.1 vs. 2.4 3.1 ) with higher solvent-accessible void (14.4 vs. 8.9%) compared to the Co-INA-2, which is well supported by the BET and Langmuir surface area analyses. Furthermore, the CO2 adsorption properties of Co-FINA-1, Co-FINA-2, and Co-INA-2 show the same trends in adsorption capacities as seen in the case of H2 uptake (Figure 3c). Co-FINA-1 ad- sorbs 3.09 mmolg1 of CO2 at 298 K, which is the highest uptake in this series. Co-FINA-2 adsorbs 2.30 mmolg1, whereas Co-INA-2 adsorbs 1.78 mmolg1 of CO2 at 298 K and as the pressure approaches 1 bar. These CO2 uptake properties are well justified with respect to the BET and Langmuir surface areas of these MOFs. The H2 and CO2 uptake capacities shown by Co-FINA-1, Co-FINA-2, and Co-INA-2 are comparable with those of previously reported well-known MOFs. The H2 (77 K) and CO2 (298 K) uptakes shown by Co-FINA-1 at 1 bar pressure are the highest reported for the fully or partially fluorinated MOFs reported in the literature. Co-FINA-1 outperforms the F-MOFs [Ag2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(Ag4-Tz6)] (Tz=3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)- 1,2,4-triazolate)[10a,b] and [Zn2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(tfbdc)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dabco)] (tfbdc=tetra- fluoroterephthalate, dabco=1,4-diazobicycloACHTUNGTRENUNG[2.2.2]ACHTUNGTRENUNGoct- ACHTUNGTRENUNGane),[11a] which have a H2 uptake capacity of 1.0 and 1.78 wt%, respectively, at 1.01 bar pressure. The H2 uptake shown by Co-FINA-1 at 77 K and 1.01 bar is comparable to those of MOFs such as Mg/DOBDC (DOBDC4=1,4-di- ACHTUNGTRENUNGoxido-2,5-benzenedicarboxylate)[8f] and [Zn2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdc)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dabco)] (bdc=1,4-benzenedicarboxylate),[11a] and outperforms well- known MOFs like PCN-6,[18a] PCN-68,[18b] PCN-66,[18b] NOTT-116,[18c] Co/DOBDC,[8f] Zn/DOBDC,[8f] IRMOF-3,[9g] CUK-1,[18d] Bio-MOF-11,[4c] MOF-177,[18e] MOF-5,[18e] and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) like ZIF-11[4a] and ZIF-8[4a] reported in the literature (Table S5 in the Support- ing Information). Also, CO2 uptake at 298 K and 1.01 bar shown by Co-FINA-1 outperforms MOFs like CPM-6,[18f] TMA@Bio-MOF-11,[4d] UMCM-150,[18g] [Zn2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(bdc)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dabco)], CPM-5,[18f] IRMOF-3, [(In3O)(OH)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ADC)2(IN)2]·4.67H2O (ADC=azobenzene-4,4’-dicarboxylate, IN=isonicotin- ACHTUNGTRENUNGate),[9c] MOF-177, MOF-5, and ZIFs like ZIF-78,[2d] ZIF- 96,[4g] and ZIF-69[2d] (Table S6 in the Supporting Informa- tion). The simultaneous H2 and CO2 uptake shown by Co- FINA-1 stands better over those of some literature-reported MOFs having higher surface area (Table S7 in the Support- ing Information). The gas uptake shown by Co-FINA-2 is lower than that of Co-FINA-1, but still it is comparable with those of previously reported fluorinated and nonfluorinated MOFs.[7–11] As shown in Figure 3d, we obtained the adsorption iso- therms of H2 in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1 at 77 K experi- mentally, as well as by use of simulations (Section S6 in the Supporting Information; see ref. [12] for the hydrogen ad- sorption isotherm of Co-INA-1). The simulation results of H2 adsorption in Co-FINA-1 agree fairly well with the ex- perimental data. In Co-INA-1, however, the calculated re- sults underestimate the experimental data at low pressures, but overestimate them at high pressures. The deviations be- tween simulation and experimental results in Co-INA-1 Table 1.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 691 FULL PAPER Fluorinated Metal–Organic Frameworks for H2 and CO2 Adsorption might be attributed to the structural change. The simulation used the crystal structure prior to the removal of solvents, though solvents were not included in the simulation. Never- theless, the crystal structure of Co-INA-1 was found to slightly shrink and/or partially collapse after removing all coordinated and lattice solvents. Therefore, the crystal struc- ture in experimental measurements was different from the one in the simulation. It should be noted that the crystal structure of Co-FINA-1 remains intact even after solvent re- moval due to the presence of fluorine atoms. Comparing the simulation results in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1, Co-INA-1 has a higher H2 adsorption over the entire pressure range. The density contours calculated to identify the favorable binding sites for H2 in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1 are shown in Figure 4 (Figure S19 in the Supporting Information). These density contours are shown on the XY plane for H2 adsorption at 0.4 bar. It is observed that H2 molecules are primarily located in the 1D channels and the binding sites are mostly located in the channel centers. The density in Co-FINA-1 is lower than that in Co-INA-1, particularly in the regions near the fluorine atoms due to steric hindrance. Conclusion We have synthesized two pairs of isostructural fluorinated and nonfluorinated MOFs by using INA and its fluorinated analogue FINA. For the first time, we achieved isostructural isomerism in fluorinated and nonfluorinated MOFs by using fluorinated and nonfluorinated ligands. Comparison of the H2 and CO2 adsorption in these isostructural fluorinated and nonfluorinated MOFs reinforces our previous conclu- sion that high H2 uptake in F-MOFs is not a universal phe- nomenon, but is rather system-specific and differs from system to system.[11b] In the isostructural Co-INA-1 and Co- FINA-1, fluorination resulted in a similar H2 uptake, where- as in Co-INA-2 and Co-FINA-2, fluorination resulted in an overall increase in H2 uptake. Also, the H2 uptake shown by Co-FINA-1 is the highest reported in the literature for F- MOFs, although the pore size is decreased due to fluorine atoms pointing into the pores. From these results, it is clear that as fluorine atoms in F-MOFs are weakly interacting with gas molecules, other factors, such as pore size, curva- ture, and open metal sites, can also play crucial roles in the high gas uptakes in these F-MOFs. Experimental Section General procedures: All reagents and solvents for synthesis and analysis were commercially available and used as received. Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Optics ALPHA-E spectrom- eter with a universal Zn–Se ATR accessory in the 4000–600 cm1 region. PXRD patterns were recorded on a Phillips PANalytical diffractometer for CuKa radiation (l=1.5406 ), with a scan speed of 28min1 and a step size of 0.028 in 2q. TGA experiments were carried out in the temper- ature range of 20–8008C on an SDT Q600 TG-DTA analyzer under a N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 108Cmin1. All low-pressure gas adsorp- tion experiments (up to 1.01 bar) were performed on a Quantachrome Quadrasorb automatic volumetric instrument. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction: All single-crystal data were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX three circle diffractometer equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) area detector (Bruker Systems Inc., 1999a)[19] and operated at 1500 W power (50 kV, 30 mA) to generate MoKa radiation (l=0.71073 ). The incident X-ray beam was focused and monochromated with Bruker Excalibur Gobel mirror optics. Crystals of the MOFs reported herein were mounted on nylon CryoLoops (Hampton Research) with Paraton-N (Hampton Research). Data were integrated by using Bruker SAINT software.[20] Data were subsequently corrected for absorption by the program SADABS.[21] The space group determinations and tests for merohedral twinning were carried out with XPREP.[22] In all cases, the highest possible space group was chosen. All structures were solved by direct methods and refined by using the SHELXTL 97 software suite.[23] Atoms were located from iterative ex- amination of difference F-maps following least-squares refinements of the earlier models. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and included as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters 1.2– 1.5 times Ueq of the attached C atoms. Data were collected at 298(2) K for Co-FINA-1, Co-FINA-2, and Co-INA-2. All structures were exam- ined by using the ADDSYM subroutine of PLATON[16] to assure that no additional symmetry could be applied to the models. All ellipsoids in ORTEP diagrams are displayed at the 50% probability level unless noted otherwise. CCDC-835979 (Co-FINA-1), CCDC-835980 (Co–FINA- 2), and CCDC-835981 (Co-INA-2) contain the supplementary crystallo- graphic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam. ac.uk/data_request/cif. Gas adsorption measurements: Low-pressure volumetric gas adsorption measurements were performed at 77 K for H2 and N2, maintained by a liquid-nitrogen bath, with pressures ranging from 0 to 1.01 bar on a Quantachrome Quadrasorb automatic volumetric instrument. CO2 ad- sorption measurements were performed at room temperature (298 K) with same pressure range. In all the adsorption measurements, ultrahigh- purity H2 was obtained by using calcium aluminosilicate adsorbents to remove trace amounts of water and other impurities before introduction into the system. The blue colored microcrystals of each MOF were soaked in dry dichloromethane/methanol (1:1) for 12 h. Fresh dry di- chloromethane/methanol (1:1) was subsequently added and the crystals were allowed to stand for an additional 48 h to remove coordinated and free solvates (DMF, EtOH, and H2O) present in the framework. The sample was dried under a dynamic vacuum (1.33106 bar) at room tem- perature overnight. The coordinated solvents, DMF and EtOH, on the SBUs remained in the framework at this stage. To remove coordinated solvents, samples were heated at 608C for 12 h and 1208C for 12 h under a dynamic vacuum. Simulation model and method: To unravel the effect of fluorine atoms on adsorption and identify the adsorption sites in gas-loaded structures, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were carried out for H2 adsorption at 77 K in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1. The experimentally determined desolvated crystal structures were used in the simulations. The H2 molecule was modeled as a two-site rigid molecule with HH bond length of 0.74 . The Lennard–Jones (LJ) interaction parameters of HH interaction were s=2.59  and e=12.5 K.[24] The dispersion in- teractions of the framework atoms in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1 were represented by the Universal Force Field (UFF).[25] The frameworks and Figure 4. Density contours in the XY plane for H2 adsorption in Co-INA- 1 and Co-FINA-1 at 0.4 bar. www.chemeurj.org  2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2012, 18, 688 – 694 692 R. Banerjee et al. H2 molecules were treated as rigid. The Lorentz–Berthelot combining rules were used to calculate the cross LJ interaction parameters. The LJ interactions were evaluated by using a spherical cutoff of 18  with the long-range corrections added. The number of trial moves in the GCMC simulation was 2107. The first 107 moves were used for equilibration and the subsequent 107 moves for production. Four types of trial moves were conducted for H2 molecules: displacement, rotation, regrowth at a new position, and swap with the reservoir.

Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction Data Collection, Structure Solution and Refinement Procedures: General Data Collection and Refinement Procedures: Single crystal data were collected on Bruker SMART APEX three circle diffractometer equipped with a CCD area detector and operated at 1500 W power (50 kV, 30 mA) to generate Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073 Å). The incident X-ray beam was focused and monochromated using Bruker Excalibur Gobel mirror optics. Crystals of all MOFs reported in the paper was mounted on nylon CryoLoop (Hampton Research) with Paraton-N (Hampton Research). Initial scans of each specimen were performed to obtain preliminary unit cell parameters and to assess the mosaicity (breadth of spots between frames) of the crystal to select the required frame width for data collection. In every case frame widths of 0.5° were judged to be appropriate and full hemispheres of data were collected using the Bruker SMART1 software suite. Following data collection, reflections were sampled from all regions of the Ewald sphere to redetermine unit cell parameters for data integration and to check for rotational twinning using CELL_NOW2. In no data collection was evidence for crystal decay encountered. Following exhaustive review of the collected frames the resolution of the dataset was judged. Data were integrated using Bruker SAINT3 software with a narrow frame algorithm and a 0.400 fractional lower limit of average intensity. Data were subsequently corrected for absorption by the program SADABS4. The space group determinations and tests for merohedral twinning were carried out using XPREP3. In these cases, the highest possible space group was chosen. Structures were solved by direct methods and refined using the SHELXTL 975 software suite. Atoms were located from iterative examination of difference F-maps following least squares refinements of the earlier models. Final model was refined anisotropically (if the number 11 of data permitted) until full convergence was achieved. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions (C-H = 0.93 Å) and included as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters 1.2-1.5 times Ueq of the attached C atoms. In some cases modeling of electron density within the voids of the frameworks did not lead to identification of recognizable solvent molecules in these structures, probably due to the highly disordered contents of the large pores in the frameworks. Highly porous crystals that contain solvent-filled pores often yield raw data where observed strong (high intensity) scattering becomes limited to ~1.0 Å at best, with higher resolution data present at low intensity. A common strategy for improving X-ray data, increasing the exposure time of the crystal to X-rays, did not improve the quality of the high angle data in these cases, as the intensity from low angle data saturated the detector and minimal improvement in the high angle data was achieved. Additionally, diffuse scattering from the highly disordered solvent within the void spaces of the framework and from the capillary to mount the crystal contributes to the background and the ‘washing out’ of the weaker data. The only optimal crystals suitable for analysis were generally small and weakly diffracting. Unfortunately, larger crystals, which would usually improve the quality of the data, presented a lowered degree of crystallinity and attempts to optimize the crystal growing conditions for large high-quality specimens have not yet been fruitful. Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction data for Co-FINA-1, -2 and Co-INA-2 was collected at 298(2) K. Electron density within void spaces has not been assigned to any guest entity but has been modeled as isolated oxygen and/or carbon atoms. The foremost errors in all the models are thought to lie in the assignment of guest electron density. Structures were examined using the ADDSYM subroutine of PLATON7 to assure that no additional symmetry could be applied to the models. All ellipsoids in ORTEP diagrams are displayed at the 50% probability level unless noted otherwise. For these structures we noted that 12 elevated R-values are commonly encountered in MOF crystallography for the reasons expressed above by different research groups.8-17 Table S1, S2 and S3 contains crystallographic data for the all MOFs. 1.

The loop was mounted on a SMART APEX three circle diffractometer equipped with a CCD area detector (Bruker Systems Inc., 1999a)19 and operated at 1500 W power (50 kV, 30 mA) to generate Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073 Å). The incident X-ray beam was focused and monochromated using Bruker Excalibur Gobel mirror optics. A total of 5039 reflections were collected of which 5039 were unique and 2493 of these were greater than 2σ (I). The range of θ was from 2.65 to 29.14º. Analysis of the data showed negligible decay during collection. The structure was solved in the monoclinic P 21 space group, with Z = 2, using direct methods. The atoms C1, C2, C7, C8, C14, C25, N1B, O5 and O1B atoms were found to be disordered and were refined isotropically. All other atoms were refined anisotropically with hydrogen atoms generated as spheres riding the coordinates of their parent atoms. Modeling of electron density within the voids of the frameworks did not lead to identification of coordinated solvent molecules in all structures due to the lowered resolution of the data. The attempts made to model the coordinated solvent molecules did not lead to identification it in all structures due to the limited periodicity of the solvent molecules in the crystals. Since the solvent is bonded to the framework this can be expected for the MOF structures. Many atomic coordinates that have been attributed to solvent molecules lie on a special position. However, very high displacement parameters, high esd’s and partial occupancy due to the disorder make it impossible to determine accurate positions for these solvent molecules. Thus, electron density within void spaces which could not be assigned to any definite guest entity was modeled as isolated carbon and oxygen atoms, and the foremost 15 errors in all the models lies with assignment of guest electron density. The unit cell of Co-INA-2 contains 2 units of INA and 1 unit of disordered DMF per cobalt. Final full matrix least-squares refinement on F2 converged to to R1 = 0.0535, (F >2σF)) and wR2 = 0.1384 (all data) with GOF = 1.031. It should be noted that other supporting characterization data (vide infra Section S1) are consistent with the crystal structure. 16 Table S1.

The incident X-ray beam was focused and monochromated using Bruker Excalibur Gobel mirror optics. A total of 5810 reflections were collected of which 5810 were unique and 4243 of these were greater than 2σ (I). The range of θ was from 1.96 to 28.38º. Analysis of the data showed negligible decay during collection. The structure was solved in the tetragonal Pnma space group, with Z = 4, using direct methods. The atoms F1, F2, C6, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15 and C16 were found to be disordered and were refined isotropically. All other carbon, oxygen, fluorine and nitrogen atoms were refined isotropically with hydrogen atoms generated as spheres riding the coordinates of their parent atoms. All Co atoms were refined anisotropically.

Computational Studies for Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1 MOFs: Simulation Model and Method Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were carried out for H2 adsorption at 77 K in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1. The experimentally determined desolvated crystal structures were used in the simulations. H2 was modeled as a two-site rigid molecule with HH bond length of 0.74 Å. The Lennard-Jones interaction parameters of H-H interaction were σ = 2.59 Å and ε = 12.5 K.1 The dispersion interactions of the framework atoms were represented by the Universal Force Field (UFF).2 The Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules were used to calculate the cross LJ interaction parameters. The frameworks and H2 molecules were treated as rigid. The LJ interactions were evaluated using a spherical cutoff of 18 Å with the long-range corrections added. The number of trial moves in the GCMC simulation was 2× 107. The first 107 moves were used for equilibration and the subsequent 107 moves for production. Four types of trial moves were conducted for H2 molecules, namely, displacement, rotation, regrowth at a new position, and swap with the reservoir. 44 Figure S18. Simulated and experimental adsorption isotherms of H2 in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA- 1 at 77 K. See ref 12 in paper for the hydrogen adsorption isotherms of Co-INA-1. Figure S18 shows the adsorption isotherms of H2 in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1 at 77 K. The simulation results of H2 adsorption in Co-FINA-1 agree fairly with the experimental data. In Co- INA-1, however, the calculated results underestimate the experimental data at low pressures, but overestimate at high pressures. The deviations between simulation and experimental results in Co-INA-1 might be attributed to the structural change. The simulation used the crystal structure prior to the removal of solvents, though solvents were not included in the simulation. Nevertheless, the crystal structure of Co-INA-1 was found to slightly shrink and/or partially 45 collapse after removing all coordinated and lattice solvents. Therefore, the crystal structure in experimental measurement was different from the one in the simulation. It should be noted that the crystal structure of Co-FINA-1 remains intact even after solvent removal due to the presence of fluorine atoms. Comparing the simulation results in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1, Co-INA-1 has a higher H2 adsorption over the entire pressure range. Figure S19. Density contours on the XY plane for H2 adsorption in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1 at 40 kPa. To identify the favorable binding sites for H2 in Co-INA-1 and Co-FINA-1, Figure S19 shows the density contours on the XY plane for H2 adsorption at 40 kPa. It is observed that H2 molecules are primarily located in the 1-D channels and the binding sites are mostly located in the channel centers. The density in Co-FINA-1 is lower than in Co-INA-1, particularly in the regions near the fluorine atoms due to steric hindrance. References: (1) Cracknell, R. F. Phys. Chem. Chem.
