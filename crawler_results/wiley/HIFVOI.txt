Since the discovery of high-silica molecular sieves, such as ZSM-5 and silicalites, a high proportion of alumina had not been thought to be a key component in the formation of the diverse porous architectures of zeolites.[7] In fact, that should depend on the inherent structural features of the zeolitic primary building unit (PBU), namely the corner- sharing tetrahedral TO4 (T=Si or Al, O-T-O=109.58, T-O-T=1458 in which the TO bonds could freely rotate). It is this type of PBU that endows the zeolites with the flexi- bility of T-T-T angles and also make possible the various sec- ondary building units (SBUs) and coplanar T-atom rings with 4- to 10-members.[8] Thus, the creation of MOFs with augmented zeolitic structures is not due to the augmentation of a specialized zeolitic structure, but rather to the augmen- tation of the PBU of the zeolites. Cobalt(II) and zinc(II) imidazolate polymers were chosen as the ideal metal–organ- ic analogues of inorganic silicates as their PBU, [M(im)4] Abstract: Attempts to create metal–or- ganic frameworks (MOFs) with zeolitic topologies, metal (zinc(II) and cobalt- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(II)) imidazolates have repeatedly been used as the metal–organic motifs of in- organic silicate analogues. By modulat- ing the synthetic strategy based on the solvothermal and liquid diffusion method, seven further MOFs (includ- ing at least three zeolitic MOFs) of zinc(II) imidazolates, [Zn(im)2·xG] (G=guest molecule, x=0.2–1) 1a–7a, have been successfully synthesized. Of these, 1a–3a are isostructural with the previously reported cobalt analogues 1b–3b, respectively, while 4a–7a are new members of the metal imidazolate MOF family. Complex 4a exhibits a structure related to silicate CaAl2Si2O8 of CrB4 topology, but with a higher network symmetry; complex 5a has a structure with zeolitic DFT topology that was discovered in zeolite-related materials of DAF-2, UCSB-3, and UCSB-3GaGe; complex 6a demon- strates an unprecedented zeolite-like topology with one dimensional chan- nels with 10-rings; and 7a displays a structure of natural zeolite GIS (gis- mondine) topology. All of these poly- morphous MOFs were created only by using certain solvents as structure-di- recting agents (SDAs). Further exten- sive metal–organic frameworks with zeolitic topologies can be envisaged if other solvents were to be used.

Even though the extend- ed frameworks of cobalt(II) imidazolates[9] (as well as some of copper(II) imidazolates or metal–diazolates[10]) are struc- turally reminiscent of the zeolitic features, we are aiming at creating extended ZMOFs (ZMOF=zeolitic MOF). We have always firmly believed that most of the zeolitic topolo- gies can be fabricated with metal imidazolates if effective synthetic strategies are employed.[9b,c] For example, Chen and co-workers[11] successfully acquired three MOFs of zinc(II) 2-alkylimidazolates with zeolite SOD, ANA, and RHO topologies by the introduction of different small sub- stituents that play the roles of the templates and structure- directing agents (SDAs) to the imidazolate ligands. At almost the same time, Eddaoudi and co-workers[12] also real- ized the SOD- and RHO-topological MOFs with another metal imidazolate derivate, the indium 4,5-imidazoledicar- boxylate. Based on our earlier research, we decided to use the cobalt and zinc imidazolates as an analogy of inorganic silica. By employing a proper buffering agent (BA) that ena- bles the crystallization of metal imidazolates at room-tem- perature, a strategy for the nonsolvothermal synthesis has been established. With recourse to proper solvents as the templates or the SDAs, further extended MOFs including the ZMOFs of metal(II) imidazolates have been achieved. Thus, extended ZMOFs have been intentionally realized by the more or less deliberate crystal engineering. The isomeric and isocrystalline MOFs of the zinc(II) and cobalt(II) imida- zolates reported in this paper have the general formula [M(im)2·xG]; see Table 1 for specific details.[9] Results and Discussion Crystal structures of the zinc(II) imidazolate polymers: The MOFs of zinc(II) imidazolates [Zn(im)2·xG] were deter- mined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Table 2). Of them, compounds 4a–7a are new members of the metal imidazo- late family, while 1a–3a are isostructural with their cobalt analogues 1b–3b (M=Co), respectively, which we have pre- viously reported.[9] The structures of the above-mentioned zinc(II) imidazolates exhibit the polymorphous MOFs of four-connected networks: each zinc in the MOFs is coordi- nated with four imidazolate nitrogen atoms and each imida- zolate ligand links two zinc ions (Zn-im-Zn) into three-di- mensional frameworks (Table 3) that show the structural features of zeolitic (4,2)-net[14,15] just like the MOFs of co- balt(II) imidazolates solvothermally synthesized.[9a,c] Complex 4a (Figure 1) crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure and its framework relates to that of CaAl2Si2O8 with CrB4 topology, which appears also in 2a. However, with the space group Pbca, it has a symmetry higher than P21/n of 2a. The framework density of 4a is lower than that of 2a and therefore accommodates more guest molecules than 2a: in addition to the DMF molecules encapsulated in each of the 4264-cage units, DMF molecules are also accom- modated in the 8-ring channels, which are 12.7L12.7 M in di- ameter (if the imidazolate ligands and Van der Waal radii are taken into account, the effective opening is 7.3L7.3 M). Complex 4a reveals a framework density of 0.921 gcm3 and the accessible space to guests of 47.4%. The relation- ship between 4a and 2a is very similar to that between b- quartz and a-quartz, which have the same framework topol- ogy but different framework symmetries and densities. Complex 5a (Figure 2) crystallizes in a tetragonal form with a space group P42/mnm and its framework demon- strates the zeolitic DFT topology, which has been found so far only in the zeolite-related materials such as DAF-2 (a cobalt phosphate),[16] UCSB-3 (a zinc arsenate)[17] and UCSB-3GaGe (a gallium germanate).[18] The SBU of 5a is a 4-ring of Zn4 linked by imidazolates, from which the subu- nits of Narsarsukite chains (or bifurcated hexagon plus square (bhs) chains) are constructed. These chains run in Scheme 1.

The channels in the [110] and [11¯ 0] directions do not intersect each other; however, they do intersect with those running in the [001] direction. The solvent molecules of DMF, DMA or NMP are too small to be captured firmly in these large intersected three-dimensional channels of 5a; therefore, apart from a few disordered oxygen atoms from the moisture, the highly mobile guest molecules could not be detected in the crystal determination although they do exist in the MOFs according to the IR spectra, and elemen- tal and thermogravimetric (TG) analyses. Complex 5a re- veals the framework density of 0.841 gcm3 and space acces- sible to guests about 52.0%. Complex 6a crystallizes in a monoclinic structure with space group C2/c (Figure 3). The SBUs of 6a are 4- and 6- rings of zinc(II) imidazolate: from the 4-rings the subunit of a double-crankshaft chain (cc) is built up and from the 4- and 6-rings a chain that had never been observed in zeolites and zeolite-related materials is constructed. We name this chain “double-twisted-hexagon chain (thth)” (following the name of twisted square chain in zeolites[19]). The thth chains running in the [001] direction intersect with the cc chains running in the [010] direction by sharing the 4-rings on the peaks of cc chains, giving rise to an unprecedented three-di- mensional zeolite-like network. Complex 6a has one-dimen- sional 10-ring channels with 20.6L12.6 M openings (effective opening of 16.4L9.8 M) running in the [001] direction. There ought to be guest molecules accommodated in these channels according to the results of TG and elemental anal- yses, but they evaded X-ray determination due to their high level of disorder. Only those located in the 4264-cages were detected by single-crystal X-ray determination. So far, the 10-ring is the largest channel-opening found in MOFs of zinc(II) and cobalt(II) imidazolates, but certainly, this will not be the largest. Complex 6a has a framework density of 0.982 gcm3 and a space accessible to guests approximately 44.5%. Complex 7a (Figure 4) crystallizes in a tetragonal form with a space group I41/a. The SBU of this framework is the 4-ring, from which the cc chain is constructed. These cc chains, which propagate in the [100] direction, intersect with those running in the [010] direction by using the common 4-rings on the peaks to form a three-dimensional network. The 7a can also be described as 4- and 8-ring SBUs, from which the subunits of (4.8.8)-sheets[19] are formed. These sheets of three-connected nodes parallel to (100) {or (010)} plane are linked with each other up and Figure 3. a) and b) Polyhedral diagram of 6a along the [001] and [010] directions, respectively; c) and d) Ball-and-stick diagram of 6a along the [001] and [010] directions, respectively, in which e is the SBU of double crankshaft chain (cc), f the SBU of double-twisted-hexagon chain (thth) and g indicates the channel formed by a tubular building unit with 10- ring opening.

Tian et al. down in the [100] {or [010]} direction, giving rise to a three-dimensional network by completing the four-connec- tion of the nodes. This is exactly the network related to zeo- lite GIS (gismondine) topology.[20–22] With the topology of natural zeolite GIS, 7a consists of identical channels of 8- ring openings in the [100] and [010] directions. These chan- nels intersect each other form a three-dimensional channel with inner passage gates of 17.5L12.9 M (effective opening of 10.4L8.7 M) in which no guest molecule could be detect- ed by the single crystal X-ray determination. However, it may be similar to the case of 5a and 6a with highly disor- dered guest molecules, which also evaded X-ray detection. This ZMOF has a framework density of 0.819 gcm3 and a space accessible to guests about 53.4%. The nonsolvothermal synthesis of metal imidazolates: The piperazine-buffered solvothermal method[9,13] has proved to be a successful synthetic strategy for generating extended silica-like frameworks of cobalt(II) (and zinc(II)) imidazo- lates. However, according to the solvothermal mechanism we previously demonstrated,[13] the solvothermal tempera- ture should not be lower than 1008C, otherwise, the pipera- zine molecules cannot release the metals for generating the metal imidazolates. Moreover, at such a temperature, mole- cules with a low boiling point involved in the reactions (such as water) may generate high pressure in autoclaves that does not benefit generation of the MOFs with low framework density, the potential ZMOFs. It was noted that 1b, the only ZMOF of metal imidazolates prepared solvo- thermally,[9a] has a framework density of 1.105 gcm3. There- by, to realize the intended metal imidazolates with the most expected ZMOFs of low framework-density, a strategy has to be developed of seeking new organic bases which could buffer the metal imidazolate formation at room or even lower temperature so that the nonsolvothermal synthesis (liquid-diffusion and liquid-mixing at room-temperature) could be then available. Fortunately, primary organic amines or aqueous ammonia are the candidates as BAs for the non- solvothermal synthesis, of them the propylamine is the best one (using aqueous ammonia often makes organic solvents lose their structure-directing effect due to the volume of water introduced into the reactant mixtures that may further lead to generation of even more dense MOFs, such as the one with a network topology of banalsite[9b]). If that hap- pens, a nonsolvothermal mecha- nism such as that in Scheme 2 can be proposed. Thus, with re- course to the correct solvents as templates or SDAs, various MOFs and ZMOFs of zinc(II) imidazolate polymers can be produced, for which the single crystals are formed by liquid diffusion and the bulk micro- crystals by liquid mixing. Here, it is worth noting that we have failed to produce the MOFs of cobalt(II) imidazolate by using the new synthetic strategy, since an amorphous solid is always produced. The template or structure-directing effect of some organic solvents: In the hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites, the syn- thetic variables are templates (organic amines), tempera- ture, Si/Al ratio and their concentrations in the reactant mixture. Of these variables, the organic amines play very important roles in 1) structure-direction or templation, 2) gel modification, and 3) gel-PH alteration or buffering. Cor- respondingly in the solvothermal or nonsolvothermal syn- thesis of metal imidazolates, the organic amines play only the roles of 1) the bases for deprotonation of imidazole and 2) the buffering ligands for ready release of metal ions. So far, no amine has been discovered that has a template effect in the synthesis of metal imidazolates, but those organic sol- vents with strong solvating effect, such as dimethylforma- mide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), diethylformamide (DEF) and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) have played the template or structure-directing agent (SDA) roles. They have led to generation of extended MOFs and ZMOFs of zinc(II) imidazolates (Table 3). By using DMF as a solvent, crystals of three MOFs of 3a, 4a, and 5a were produced by the liquid-diffusion method. Of them only pure 3a could be acquired, while 4a and 5a were often generated near the start of the liquid-diffusion process and then they transformed into 3a. Therefore, the single crystals of 4a and 5a suitable for X-ray diffractions could only be isolated as we decreased the reaction temper- ature below 158C. Otherwise, these crystals would transform into the MOF of 3a before they grew to a size suitable for the single-crystal determination. Thereupon, we name 3a the thermodynamically controlled MOF, while the others are the dynamically controlled ones of the DMF-directed products. By using DMA as solvent in the liquid-diffusion process, single crystals of 2a and 5a were produced. Similar to the case above, 5a is a dynamically controlled MOF, while 2a a thermodynamically controlled MOF of the DMA-directed structures. When we used DEF as solvent in the liquid-diffusion pro- cess, single crystals of at least five structures could be ob- tained. Of these only the structures of 1a, 6a and 7a were crystallographically solved and refined, while the other two still cannot be fully solved due to the poor quality X-ray dif- fraction data. In the MOFs of DEF-directed products, 1a was the thermodynamically controlled MOF. Complex 6a should be a thermodynamically controlled quasi-stable MOF, because, similar to 2a and 3a, it can be always ob- tained as single phase by the liquid mixing. However, as the concentration of the reactants was increased and the reac- tion time was prolonged, 1a was the final product. These re- sults tally with the result of the corresponding solvothemal synthesis when DEF is used as the solvent. It is interesting that the pure phase of 5a can be obtained by both liquid diffusion and liquid mixing when NMP is used as a solvent. It seems that NMP is the best-matching Scheme 2.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 4151 FULL PAPER Zeolitic Metal–Organic Frameworks template for generation of 5a; however, the NMP molecules are presumably highly disordered and thus evade the X-ray detection, since the results of IR spectra, and elemental and TG analyses evidenced that they do exist in the MOFs. Evi- dently, there are no matching cages or holes for the NMP molecules in 5a; therefore, it is reasonable to regard NMP as an SDA rather than a template. Thus, 5a should be a thermodynamically controlled quasi-stable MOF of the NMP-directed structures. This was then confirmed by the solvothermal synthesis using NMP as a solvent that pro- duced 2a, which should be the thermodynamically control- led MOF of NMP-directed structures. The effect of MN bond rotation flexibility: To establish the flexibility of MN bond rotation as another key for gen- erating extended MOFs of metal imidazolates, we intro- duced the small methyl group into the imidazolate ring to see whether the extended MOFs could also be generated by employing different solvents as SDAs. The experiments re- vealed that only the MOF reported by Chen et al. with soda- lite (SOD) structure[11] can be produced no matter which SDA in combination with propylamine (or aqueous ammo- nia) are employed. Evidently, the substituent methyl group plays the template and SDA role in the synthesis. However, it restricts the flexibility of the ZnN bond rotation and thus leads to the metal 2-methylimidazolate suffering from a lack of framework diversity. Nevertheless, the methyl groups as the inseparable supporting templates can enhance soda- lite MOF with high thermal stability: that is why the MOF free from guests can be produced even under the solvother- mal condition. Thermal stabilities of the MOFs of zinc imidazolate: To study the thermal stability of the zinc(II) imidazolates, ther- mogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out for the MOFs of zinc(II) imidazolates (see Supporting Information) except for 4a and 7a. Even though the TGA results show that none of the MOFs experiences weight-loss from about 250 up to 4508C after total liberation from guest molecules, the results of their XRD measurements indicate that only 1a retains its structure after losing the guest molecules, while the others lose their crystalline integrity and become dense structural or amorphous solids, especially if a trace amount of propylamine is present. To try and realize the evacuated zinc(II) imidazolates retaining their original crys- talline integrity, we attempted to evacuate the as-synthe- sized samples below 1008C in vacuum; however, the crystal- line integrity was again not retained after losing the guest molecules. Conclusions To create MOFs with zeolitic topologies, we decided to use metal imidazolates as the metal–organic analogues of inor- ganic silica. For generation of these ZMOFs, the strategy of nonsolvothermal synthesis has been developed by employ- ing a room-temperature buffering method. By recourse to a number of solvents, such as DMF, DMA, DEF, and NMP, as structure-directing agents, several extended MOFs, including some ZMOFs, have been successfully realized. Unlike the inorganic zeolite synthesis, the SDAs in the zinc(II) imidazo- late synthesis are polar solvents rather than the organic amines, but like the inorganic zeolite synthesis, more than two different structures of zinc(II) imidazolate can be pro- duced by using one SDA. Of them, only the thermodynami- cally controlled stable or quasi-stable MOFs can be pro- duced in bulk. Fortunately, a dynamically controlled MOF directed by a SDA may be the thermodynamically control- led stable or quasi-stable MOF directed by another SDA. Thus, exploring for new SDAs has to be the key to creating new ZMOFs and bulk product of zinc(II) imidazolates. Also, introduction of substituents into the imidazolate li- gands is another powerful strategy that may lead to genera- tion of ZMOFs with high thermal stability. However, the substituents introduced may hinder the free rotation of ZnN bonds, leading to a lack of framework diversities in the proposed zinc imidazolate derivates. Elimination of this conflict will be the next object of our studies, leading to the creation of ZMOFs with high thermal stability. So far, the MOFs of metal(II) imidazolates and imidazo- late derivates have been discovered with more than 20 dif- ferent mineral topologies, of which several are the zeolitic topologies that account for most of the ZMOFs explored to date. This result has strongly supported our initial motiva- tion in using metal (cobalt(II) and zinc(II)) imidazolate as the metal–organic analogues of inorganic silica. However, in contrast to more than 160 of zeolites and zeolite-related substances,[6] the ZMOFs obtained from metal imidazolate so far represent only a small number. Consequently, further extensive ZMOFs of metal(II) imidazolates and imidazole derivates can certainly be expected: they should be ZMOFs with the topologies of natural and synthetic zeolites or even the unprecedented zeolitic topologies. With respect to the ZMOFs constructed from other coordination polymers, the possibility also exists provided a metal (or a ligand) func- tions as the tetrahedral vertex, an exo-bidentate ligand (or metal) serves as the linker angled with about 1458 and the coordination bonds possess the flexibility of rotation. Experimental Section General synthetic procedure: All chemicals and solvents used in the syn- theses were from commercial sources and used without further purifica- tion, but the solvents and organic amines were dried over 4–5M molecu- lar sieves before use. The elemental analyses were carried out on a Perkin–Elmer 2400 elemental analyzer. The IR spectra were recorded (400–4000 cm1 region) on a FT-IR spectrometer TENSOR 27. XRD analyses were carried out on a Bruker D8 Advance and TGA (thermal gravimetric analyses) was performed under air with a heating rate of 58Cmin1 by using a Perkin–Elmer Diamond Thermogravimetric Ana- lyzer. The syntheses of zinc imidazolates were carried out at room tem- perature: corresponding to the solvothermal synthesis of metal imidazo- lates, we name the room temperature synthesis as the nonsolvothermal synthesis which consists of 1) liquid diffusion for producing single crystals www.chemeurj.org  2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Chem. Eur. J. 2007, 13, 4146 – 4154 4152 Y.-Q. Tian et al. used in X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis and 2) liquid mixing for bulk microcrystals used for the XRD, elemental, and TG anaylses. The typical nonsolvothermal syntheses can be described as follows: Liquid diffusion: Imidazole (0.068 g, 1.0 mmol) dissolved in the chosen SDA (3.0 mL) was placed in the bottom of a 5.0 mL test tube. Then, a so- lution of zinc(II) acetate dihydrate (0.11 g, 0.5 mmol) dissolved in propyl- amine (2.0 mL) was carefully layered over the SDA solution. Several days or even more than a week later, single crystals of zinc(II) imidazo- lates had grown to a size suitable for X-ray single-crystal determination. Liquid mixing: In a 25 mL vessel, a solution of zinc(II) acetate dihydrate (0.22 g, 1.0 mmol) dissolved in propylamine (3.0 mL) was added dropwise into a solution of imidazole (0.136 g, 2.0 mmol) dissolved in the chosen SDA (6.0 mL). After about 40 min or even several days stirring at room temperature, the MOF of zinc(II) imidazolates formed were filtered and dried in a vacuum. The structural types of the microcrystalline MOFs of zinc imidazolates obtained were identified by comparing their XRD pat- terns with those simulated on the single-crystal data (see Supporting In- formation). Complex 1a: Single crystals (pure phase) of 1a were prepared under sol- vothermal conditions by using DEF as SDA and piperazine as BA. The bulk microcrystals (pure phase) of 1a were prepared by the liquid-mixing method in DEF for 5 days, for which zinc(II) acetate dihydrate (0.88 g, 4.0 mmol) and imidazole (0.544 g, 8.0 mmol) were used, but the amount of DEF and propylamine was as same as that described in the general procedure (yield ca. 65% based on zinc).

Complex 2a: The single crystals and the bulk microcrystals (pure phase) were prepared in DMA by liquid diffusion and liquid mixing, respectively (yield: ca.81% based on zinc).

Complex 3a: The single crystals and the bulk microcrystals (pure phase) were prepared in DMF by liquid diffusion and liquid mixing, respectively (yield: ca. 78% based on zinc). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C15H19N9OZn2 (472.13): C 38.16, H 4.06, N 26.71; found: C 38.58, H 3.71, N 26.34; IR (KBr pellet): n˜ =3434 (w), 3118 (w), 3100 (w), 2940 (w), 1681 (s), 1498 (s), 1480 (s), 1387 (w), 1321 (w), 1243 (w), 1171 (w), 1089 (vs), 955 (s), 836 (w), 757 (m), 670 cm1 (s). Complex 4a: The single crystals were obtained by the liquid diffusion in DMF at a room temperature below 158C. No bulk microcrystals (pure phase) were obtained at this point. Complex 5a: The single crystals can be prepared by liquid diffusion in DMA, DMF, and NMP. It should be noted that the liquid diffusion for gaining crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction must be conducted at a temperature below 158C if DMA or DMF are used as SDAs. However, if NMP is used as SDA, the single crystals (pure phase) suitable for X-ray diffraction can be obtained at ambient room temperature. The bulk mi- crocrystals (pure phase) were prepared by liquid mixing in NMP for about one hour.

Complex 7a: The single crystals were obtained by liquid diffusion in DEF at a room temperature below 158C. However, if tetramethylammo- nium bromide (ca. 2 mmol) was added in the reactant mixture, single crystals of 7a were more likely to be obtained. The bulk product (pure phase) of this structure was not obtained at this point. Single-crystal X-ray structure determination: Crystallographic measure- ments were carried out on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated MoKa radiation (l=0.71073 M) at 293 K. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least- squares techniques on F2.[23] Non-hydrogen atoms of the MOFs of all metal(II) imidazolates were refined anisotropically except for disordered atoms. Hydrogen atoms on carbon atoms were generated geometrically and refined isotropically. Crystallographic data and information are pre- sented in Table 2.
