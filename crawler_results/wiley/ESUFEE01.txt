Polynu- clear and polymeric species, particularly those that contain FeII (d6), have been the subject of much recent research[2] due to the possibility of synthesising multifunctional mate- [a] School of Chemistry, Building 23, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia Fax: +61-3-99054597 E-mail: keith.murray@monash.edu [b] X-ray Science Division, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA [c] CNRS, Université de Bordeaux, ICMCB, 87 avenue du Dr. A.

All the complexes crystallised as solvates, and the influence of the latter on the magnetism and spin transitions was explored. A wide range of physical methods was em- ployed, as a function of temperature, viz. crystallography, PXRD (synchrotron), susceptibilities, LIESST and Mössbauer effect, in order to probe magnetostructural correlations in these 1D families. New examples of half-crossovers, with or- dered –LS–HS–LS–HS– intrachain states existing below T1/2, have been observed and comparisons made to related one- or two-step systems. All the observed transitions are gradual and non-hysteretic, and brief comments are made in relation to recent theoretical models for cooperativity, developed elsewhere. rials,[3] and the belief that covalent bridge-bonding between metal centres will enhance cooperativity.[4] Furthermore, second coordination sphere entities such as lattice solvent and non-coordinating anions, or intermolecular interac- tions such as hydrogen bonding,[5] may have a strong influ- ence on the magnetic character and cooperativity of a par- ticular compound by mediating interactions between SCO centres or affecting crystal packing (hence influencing “chemical pressure” within the crystal lattice), or by having an electronic influence on ligands.[6,7] Recent theoretical work by Robert et al. aimed at understanding thermal hys- teresis in bistable, highly cooperative [Fe(NCX)2(bi- dentate)2] monomers has provided new insights into how quantifiable electrostatic contributions control the hystere- sis loop and how these change as the crystal structure changes along with the spin transition.[8,9] From a chemical perspective, particular recent interest has focused on host– guest capabilities in SCO materials, where further control over the magnetic character is possible.[10] One ultimate goal in spin switching chemistry is to achieve industrial ap- plications,[11] and for instance, photomagnetic (LIESST; Light Induced Excited Spin State Trapping) studies are conducted on SCO materials in the pursuit of room-tem- perature optical switches.[12] T. M. Ross, K. S. Murray et al. FULL PAPER We recently reported the structure and magnetic proper- ties of families of [4,6-bis(dipyridylamino)-3,4,5-triazine]- bridged and other 1D polymeric materials.[13,14] In the case, for example, of the compound trans-[FeII(NCS)2(cddt)]· 2CH3OH (polymorph 1c)[13] [cddt = 2-chloro-4,6-bis(di- pyrid-2-ylamino)-1,3,5-triazine] it displayed an incomplete two-step spin transition with a rare, ordered –HS–LS–HS– LS– chain structure at low temperatures. In contrast, an- other polymorph (1b) remained HS over all temperatures. Gamez and Reedijk et al.[15] have also reported dipyr- idylamino-substituted s-triazine bridged polynuclear FeII crossover compounds, whereas Reedijk et al. discovered an intermediate phase, with ordered [HS–LS–HS] states, in a mononuclear trans-[FeII(L)2(NCS)2] two-step SCO com- plex formed with a dipyridylamine/2,2-bipyridine-type tetradentate ligand L.[16] In the present study we expand our library of 1D coval- ently bridged SCO materials containing [4,6-bis(dipyridyl- amine)-1,3,5-triazine]-type bridging ligands using the new ligands DPPyT {1-[4,6-bis(dipyridin-2-ylamino)-1,3,5-triazin- 2-yl]pyridin-4(1H)-one}, DPT (6-phenoxy-N2,N2,N4,N4- tetra-2-pyridinyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine) and DQT {4- [4,6-bis(dipyridin-2-ylamino)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yloxy]phenol}, as seen in Figure 1. There were a number of key aims in this study, all of a qualitative/phenomenological nature, and these were investigated by a comprehensive array of struc- tural and magnetic methods. The first aim was to explore the intrachain effects of varying the ligand field around each FeII atom generated by two NCX– ligands and two 2,2-dipyridylamino (dpa) moieties of the adjacent, above- mentioned bridging ligands L in complexes of type trans- [FeII(NCX)2(L)], where X = S and Se. As well as the anticipated changes in T1/2 arising, par- ticularly from the NCX– variations (the ligand fields from the L ligands are expected to be similar), the variations in substituents in the 2-position of the triazine rings, shown in Figure 1, viz. a pyridone group (DPPyT), a phenoxy group Figure 1.

Chem. 2011, 1395–1417 1396 (DPT) and a quinol-type group (DQT) were aimed at influ- encing crystal packing as well as providing possible H- bonding or π–π stacking between 1D chains that can often influence cooperativity.[5] Exploration of the influence on cooperativity and T1/2 of these intermolecular interactions, along with other crystal-packing effects, such as FeII first coordination sphere geometry, was of particular interest in the current study. Another question of importance was how common would be the earlier observation, in related ligand systems, of two-step spin transitions accompanied, or not, by ordered –LS–HS–LS–HS– states existing at the interme- diate plateau temperature.[2,13,14] As the synthetic work pro- ceeded, it became clear that crystals of the FeII compounds were invariably solvated and thus, by synthesising and studying a range of such solvates, we sought to gain a better understanding of the manner in which second coordination sphere entities affect the magnetic character of these trans- [FeII(NCX)2(L)]·Solvent systems by a comparative struc- tural study over a range of temperatures spanning the spin transition. Since the solvate molecules were often easily lost, great care was taken to ensure the samples measured were of the phase shown by crystallography and that desolvation had not occurred or, at least, was minimal. As indicated earlier, we are certainly not the first, or only group, to rec- ognise solvate dependency in FeII spin transitions, though there are relatively few such reports for 1D SCO materials. Some recent examples, by no means exhaustive, include sin- gle-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations induced by guest sorption/desorption, noted in mononuclear FeII com- pounds by Oshio et al.[17] and Zheng et al.[18] and, in coor- dination-polymer SCO systems by Real et al.,[19] Kepert et al.[20] and Ohba and Kitagawa et al.[21] In a 1D [FeII(Schiff base)(μ-4,4-bipyridine)]n crystal, Weber et al. have ob- served solvent dependency of the spin transition concomi- tant with grinding of the crystals, whereas a precipitated powder sample of the same complex showed further differ- ences.[22] 1D FeII Chain Compounds Results and Discussion Synthesis and Characterisation The ligands DPPyT, DPT and DQT were synthesised by the reaction of cddt[23] with 4-hydroxypyridine, phenol or hydroquinone, respectively, in hot DMSO with N,N-diiso- propylethylamine present as base. The yield for DQT was lower than those for the other two new ligands presented here. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra for these ligands are available in the Supporting Information, Figures S1–S6. Syntheses of the FeII 1D chain materials 1 {trans-[FeII- (NCS)2(DPPyT)]·2.5CH2Cl2}, 2 {trans-[FeII(NCS)2(DPPyT)]· 2CHCl3·0.5CH3OH}, 3 {trans-[FeII(NCSe)2(DPPyT)]· CH2Cl2}, 4 {trans-[FeII(NCSe)2(DPPyT)]·2CHCl3·0.5CH3- OH}, 5 {trans-[FeII(NCS)2(DPT)]·2CH3OH·H2O}, 6 {trans-[FeII(NCS)2(DQT)]·2CH2Cl2},7{trans-[FeII(NCSe)2- (DQT)]·CH2Cl2·CH2ClCH2Cl} and 8 {trans-[FeII(NCSe)2- (DQT)]·1.5CH2Cl2·0.5CH3OH} were achieved by slow dif- fusion of the reagents Fe(NCX)2 and L together in a reac- tion medium comprised usually of two solvents, but in some cases three solvents were used (see Experimental Section). In this manner, crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray dif- fraction studies were grown for each of 1, 2, and 4–8. Sin- gle-crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed that each of these complexes is polymeric and consists of linear, 1D chains in which FeII sites are chelated by the terminal pyr- idyl groups of the L ligands, the latter bridging between metal centres. The pyridyl moieties of L are chelated in equatorial positions around FeII sites, and the N6 coordina- tion sphere at each FeII site is completed by trans-axial NCX– ligands (for a more detailed discussion of the struc- tural features, see the Structural Analysis section). A similar 1D structure is expected for 3, although X-ray quality crys- tals were not produced. Apart from compounds 9 and 10, described below, the formation of FeII coordination polymers was consistent here for all syntheses attempted. However, prediction of the constitution of the lattice solvent was not generally possible. The relative proportions of solvents present in the crystal lattices of 1–8 does not always reflect the relative pro- portions of these solvents present in the reaction media. To ensure accuracy of microanalytical and magnetic data, ev- ery effort was made to keep each product stored under the solvent that was found in its crystal lattice for as long as possible, prior to analysis, in order to minimise lattice sol- vent loss. Whereas it is acknowledged that, in some cases, some lattice solvent was lost quite quickly when products were removed from solvent, microanalytical data are, gen- erally, in good agreement with calculated values. In the magnetism results we describe four samples of 1, viz. 1, 1α (desolvated in air for 1 week), 1β (desolvated during trans- port to Bordeaux for photomagnetism), and 1γ (partial de- solvation of a pristine sample that had been coated in grease prior to photomagnetic studies). Thus, these labels signify different degrees of solvation. Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain any structural details for these partly or fully desolvated forms of 1 or of other desolvated com- Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 1395–1417 © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 1397 plexes described here since they did not yield diffraction patterns. Microanalytical data were obtained on fully desol- vated samples in some cases, such as 5α, and agreed with calculated values. The “parent” solvates 1–6 were each syn- thesised by using the described methods, reproducibly on more than one occasion, as judged by single-crystal X-ray studies. The parent solvate 7 was accessible by using two different concentrations of reactants (see Experimental Sec- tion and Supporting Information), whereas the parent solv- ate 8 was synthesised more than once by using the method described in the Experimental Section, as judged by single- crystal X-ray studies and microanalysis. The compounds 9 and 10, synthesised by methods described in the Experi- mental Section, were each synthesised once only for the present study. An interesting observation was that even though 1:1 ra- tios of Fe(NCX)2/L were used in all cases involving the li- gand DPT, mononuclear 1:2 products 9 {trans-[FeII(NCS)2 (DPT)2]·2CH3OH} and 10 {trans-[FeII(NCSe)2(DPT)2]· 2CH3OH} were crystallized when methanol was used both as diffusing solvent in the H-tubes employed for crystal growth, as well as the reaction medium for rapid precipi- tation of microcrystalline powder for bulk analysis. Magnetic Susceptibility and LIESST Studies The magnetic and photomagnetic results for all com- pounds are given here, prior to their structural data, and discussions of magnetostructural and cooperativity corre- lations, relating to ligand and solvent variations, are given in the Discussion and Conclusion sections. trans-[FeII(NCX)2(DPPyT)]·Solvent Series Complexes 1–4 all display gradual spin transitions with no thermal hysteresis noted when heating and cooling (see Figure 2). For 1, the χMT value (per FeII at 270 K in the high-spin (HS) plateau region) of 3.125 cm3mol–1K de- creases gradually below 240 K, with T1/2 ≈175 K. In the LS region, below ca. 120 K, the χMT values decrease slightly from ca. 0.5 cm3mol–1K to reach a minimum of 0.08 cm3mol–1K at 2 K. Such non-zero values of χMT be- low the spin transition are commonly observed[24] and are due to a combination of second-order Zeeman TIP (tem- perature-independent paramagnetic susceptibility) effects from the t2g6 FeII centres and, perhaps, some remnant HS contribution. Figure 2(a) shows that the gradual spin tran- sition for the desolvated (see above) sample 1α, has a slightly higher T1/2 value of ca. 190 K, with a more conven- tional shape than that of 1 and with a higher low-spin (LS) plateau (χMT ≈0.8 cm3mol–1K) than in the parent, indica- tive of a larger HS state contribution. Mössbauer spectra were measured on selected examples of the present 1D families to confirm HS and LS states and complement the magnetic data. Complex 1 was measured at both room temperature (ca. 290 K) and 78 K (see Sup- porting Information, Figure S7). At room temperature the quadrupole splitting and isomer shift of 2.64(1) mms–1 and 1.05(1) mms–1, respectively, are typical of HS-state FeII. T. M. Ross, K. S. Murray et al. FULL PAPER Figure 2. χMT plots for (a) 1 (filled squares), the desolvated sample 1α (filled circles) and 2 (crosses), and (b) 3 (filled circles) and 4 (filled triangles). The 78 K spectrum, corresponding to a predominantly LS state, shows a small residual HS doublet (ca. 8%), with a quadrupole splitting and isomer shift of 0.40 mms–1 and 0.51 mms–1 for the LS doublet, and 2.74(1) mms–1 and 1.46(1) mms–1 for the minor HS doublet. The fitting of the doublet due to the LS contribution (the main, narrow doublet) could not be carried out by using a simple one- Voigtian fit, which suggests that there are similar contri- butions from more than one species to this doublet. We suggest that the residual HS fraction and the possibility of more than one contributor to the LS doublet, may be due to a non-uniform, partial drying out of the sample despite efforts to retain full solvation. In Figure 2(a) it can be seen that complex 2 shows a com- plete HS-to-LS transition, with T1/2 ≈200 K, and an LS plateau value of χMT = 0.21 cm3mol–1K. The plot of χMT for 3, shows that the HS state has not been fully populated at 300 K, where χMT ≈3.1 cm3mol–1K [Figure 2(b)]. A full, gradual HS-to-LS transition is observed, with T1/2 ≈250 K. The LS region, below ca. 200 K, shows χMT slowly decreas- ing, from ca. 0.5 cm3mol–1K at 200 K to ca. 0.2 cm3mol–1K at 4 K, likely indicative of some HS-state trapping at these low temperatures. The analogous chloro- form/methanol solvate 4 likewise shows an incomplete crossover at 270 K [Figure 2(b)], with T1/2 of ca. 260 K and with no hysteresis. The LS plateau has χMT ≈ 0.2 cm3mol–1K. Thus, for both the NCS– and NCSe– ana- logues, with the higher T1/2 being noted for NCSe– as ex- pected, a higher value of T1/2 was observed for the chloro- form/methanol solvate compared to the dichloromethane solvate. www.eurjic.org © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 1395–1417 1398 Photomagnetic LIESST (Light Induced Excited Spin State Trapping) studies were carried out on a desolvated sample of 1β [see Figure 3(a)]. The thermal susceptibility plot for 1β shows a full HS-to-LS transition that occurs in two slightly different stages. A T1/2 of ca. 200 K is noted for 1β, which is higher than that observed for 1 and 1α, and the shape of the spin transition is slightly different to that of 1α possibly because of the different drying regimes used. The sample 1β was irradiated with green light (532 nm) at 10 K until photosaturation was achieved, resulting in ca. 40% trapping of a metastable HS state. The irradiation was then turned off and the sample heated, resulting in a rapid relax- ation of the metastable HS state to the LS state by 70 K. The characteristic T(LIESST) value for this material is 30 K,[12] calculated by the minimum of δχMT/δT, which re- lates to a location on the graph of T(LIESST) vs. T1/2 ap- proximately along the T0 = 100 K line.[12] This low value of T(LIESST) is in agreement with predictions that members of the [FeII(L)n(NCS)2] family can be expected to have T(LIESST) values  125 K.[25] The metastable HS state upon heating appears to be quite unstable, and this is prob- Figure 3. χMT plots and LIESST activity for (a) 1β and (b) 1γ. 1D FeII Chain Compounds ably the reason for the incomplete HS trapping being ob- served here. Kinetics measurements were carried out on 1β at 10, 25, 32, 35, 38 and 40 K and show rapid relaxation of the trapped HS state even at 10 K by a stretched ex- ponential behaviour (see Supporting Information, Fig- ure S9). Fitting of the data yielded the parameters EA = 82 cm–1, kinf = 2.5103 s–1, σ = 28 cm–1, with a very low activation energy indicative of little communication occur- ring in the lattice for the LIESST effect. Attempts were also made to measure LIESST on a “fully solvated” sample of 1 (1γ; see above regarding the label) by carefully handling and purging at 200 K for a minimal time. However, on each occasion partial or full desolvation oc- curred. The T1/2 value for 1γ of ca. 190 K [Figure 3(b)] does not match the T1/2 value of ca. 175 K noted for the parent, fully solvated compound 1, and it is suggested that the grease used to prevent desolvation was not sufficient to re- tain the dichloromethane molecules located in the crystal lattice. The grease-covered sample 1γ was cooled to 10 K, and then irradiated with green light (532 nm), and the sam- ple warmed at a rate of 0.3 Kmin–1. The magnetic suscep- tibility measurements on 1γ display a more conventional, continuous transition curve shape than both those of 1β and 1. Unlike 1α, sample 1γ reaches a more complete transition from HS to LS at low temperatures. As 1, 1α, 1β, and 1γ all contain varying degrees of solvation, and display noticeably different temperature-dependent magnetic behaviour, this underscores the sensitivity of the magnetic character of these compounds towards the nature of the lattice sol- vation. The structural effects of loss or partial loss of lattice solvent could not be investigated here due to a simultaneous loss of crystallinity. Noticeable in Figure 3(b) is the low photo-excitation efficiency of 1γ, as compared to 1β. Due to the gradual nature of the LS-to-HS relaxation curve, no T(LIESST) could be determined. In addition to this, relax- ation kinetics recorded at 10 K [insert, Figure 3(b)] suggest that 1γ is a fast-relaxing species with a lower activation- energy distribution than 1β. The faster relaxation rate of 1γ may also be due to self-acceleration caused by a higher chemical pressure in 1γ that is not present in desolvated 1β. trans-[FeII(NCX)2(L)]·Solvent Series where L = DPT and DQT The fully solvated parent complex 5 displays a con- tinuous, incomplete SCO with T1/2 ≈190 K. As can be seen in Figure 4(a), for 5 the χMT value per FeII of ca. 3.4 cm3mol–1K at 250 K drops slightly until 210 K, where it has reached ca. 3.2 cm3mol–1K. Between 210 K and 160 K χMT falls smoothly to ca. 1.6 cm3mol–1K, indicating that a “half” SCO occurs. A portion of 5 was dried under high vacuum at 80 °C to remove lattice solvent, and mag- netic susceptibility measurements were taken on the desol- vated phase, labelled 5α. As seen in Figure 4(a), removal of solvent has caused not only a lowering of T1/2 to ca. 165 K, but has resulted in a spin transition with a subtle two-step nature, the origin of which is not known. Between 300 K and 240 K, 5α has a χMT value of ca. 3.4–3.3 cm3mol–1K, which drops slowly between 240 K and 175 K to reach ca. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 1395–1417 © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 1399 2.8 cm3mol–1K. Below 175 K, the values drop off more rapidly until 140 K, at which point they tail off, reaching a low of χMT ≈1.5 cm3mol–1K at ca. 80 K. The small in- crease in magnetic moment at low temperatures is due to some thermal trapping of HS states (this is a common phe- Figure 4. χMT plots for (a) 5 (open circles) and 5α (open squares), (b) 6, (c) 7 (open circles) and 8 (open squares), and (d) 9 and 10.

FULL PAPER nomenon when magnetic susceptibility measurements have been performed beginning at low temperatures, where the sample is quench-cooled to the lowest temperature, and magnetic susceptibility measurements taken as the tempera- ture is raised. It was confirmed by cooling slowly while me- asuring). The incomplete SCO displayed by complex 6 con- tains several subtle steps and is significantly more gradual in nature than that of 5. As seen in Figure 4(b), the χMT value for 6 is slightly smaller than ca. 3.0 cm3mol–1K at 290 K, indicating that at this temperature 6 is not fully HS and values drop slowly to reach ca. 2.7 cm3mol–1K at 260 K, whereupon a gentle step is observed. Below 260 K, the values drop more quickly until ca. 225 K, below which χMT decreases slowly to reach ca. 1.5 cm3mol–1K at 100 K. Below 100 K, there appears to be two subtle steps ac- companying a slight decrease in χMT to ca. 1.1 cm3mol–1K. The T1/2 value of 6 is ca. 260 K. Mössbauer effect measurements have been taken on 6 at room temperature (see Supporting Information) and at 78 K (Figure 5). The room-temperature spectrum (at ca. 298 K) shows a widely split doublet, fitted to a Lorentzian peak shape and attributed to HS FeII. The isomer shift and quadrupole splitting for this doublet are 1.04(1) mms–1 and 2.48(1) mms–1, respectively. The HS doublet accounts for ca. 95% of the recorded signal; however a small, narrow doublet with an isomer shift of 0.19(3) mms–1 and a quad- rupole splitting of 0.50(6) mms–1 is noted to account for ca. 5% of the signal. This agrees with magnetic susceptibility measurements, which show that at 290 K 6 is not com- pletely HS. The 78 K Mössbauer spectrum shows a contri- bution from HS FeII, and a narrow doublet due to a contri- bution from LS FeII. The HS and LS FeII contributions each account for approximately 50% of the signal, and both the HS and LS doublets have been fitted by using a Voig- tian peak shape as the lines showed a small deviation from the Lorentzian shape. For the HS doublet the isomer shift and quadrupole splitting are 1.17(1) mms–1 and Figure 5. Mössbauer spectra (% transmission vs. velocity) taken on 6 at 78 K.

LIESST measurements were made on a fully solvated sample of 6. As seen in Figure 6(a), only a low photocon- version was achieved. The characteristic T(LIESST) value,[12,25] as determined from the graph of δχMT/δT vs. T, is 52 K. This is higher than was observed for the desolvated sample of trans-[FeII(NCS)2(DPPyT)]·2.5CH2Cl2 (1β) for which T(LIESST) was determined to be 30 K (vide supra). The T(LIESST) of 52 K, observed for 6, relates closely to a location on the graph made by Létard et al. of T(LIESST) vs. T1/2 along the T0 = 120 K line.[12,25] As judged from the rapid decay of the metastable HS state with heating this state is quite unstable, and this is probably the reason for the incomplete HS trapping being observed for 6. LIESST susceptibility measurements were also made on a sample of 5. Figure 6. LIESST measurements made on (a) 6 and (b) 5β. Although great efforts were made to preserve the lattice methanol and water molecules in 5, during the quick trans- fer of a sample of 5 into grease, some solvent loss seems to 1D FeII Chain Compounds have occurred. From the magnetic susceptibility curve shown in Figure 6(b), it is obvious that the relatively abrupt nature of the spin transition of the fully solvated complex 5 does not occur. It may also be noted that the magnetic susceptibility curve shown in Figure 6(b) does not match that of 5α, which was dried at 80 °C under high vacuum [see Figure 4(a)]. Thus, it would appear that a partially desol- vated phase of 5, denoted 5β, has been used in the measure- ment of the LIESST effect. It is notable that 5β displays a significantly more gradual spin transition than 5α, the fully desolvated phase, and also shows a much lowered T1/2 value (here, T1/2 ≈125 K for 5β). Sample 5β, protected in grease, was cooled to 10 K, and then irradiated with green light (532 nm), and the sample warmed at a rate of 0.3 K min–1. Figure 6(b) shows that ca. 80% photoconversion was achieved, much more than that seen for 6, or for the com- plex trans-[FeII(NCS)2(DPPyT)]·2.5CH2Cl2 (1), which showed ca. 40% photoconversion. The plot of δχMT/δT vs. T indicates that 5β has a characteristic T(LIESST) of 58 K [see inset, Figure 6(b)]. Relaxation kinetics were measured for 5β, and the relaxation rates were extracted by using a stretched exponential model. From this it was determined for 5β that Ea = 585 cm–1, σ ≈60 cm–1, and k = 2.6103 s–1 (for details, see Supporting Information, Fig- ure S10). The magnetic data for the complexes 7 and 8 are plotted in Figure 4(c). Both fully solvated complexes have a T1/2 value of ca. 175 K, and each shows a gradual, incomplete spin transition with a conventional shape and no stepwise nature. At 280 K, both 7 and 8 have a χMT value of ca. 3.5 cm3mol–1K; this value for 7 begins to decrease grad- ually at ca. 250 K, and reaches a low of ca. 0.2 cm3mol–1K at 80 K. For 8, the values begin to decrease at roughly the same temperature as for 7 (ca. 250 K); however, the spin transition is notably more abrupt for 8 than for 7, where for 8 a low of ca. 0.2 cm3mol–1K is reached at ca. 125 K. Surprisingly, these NCSe-bonded DQT compounds have a smaller T1/2 value than does the NCS complex 6. The monomeric complexes 9 and 10 both show a grad- ual, incomplete spin transition. As seen in Figure 4(d), 9 has a T1/2 value of ca. 150 K, whereas 10 has a T1/2 value of ca. 210 K, as is expected due to the stronger ligand field generated by NCSe– (10) in comparison to that of NCS– (9). Between 300 K and 190 K, the χMT value of 9 is ca. 3.2 cm3mol–1K; above this temperature values fall slightly, possibly indicative of lattice methanol loss. Below 190 K the χMT of 9 decreases until ca. 90 K, at which point the lowest value of χMT ≈1.1 cm3mol–1K is reached, indicative of an incomplete SCO. The small increase below 90 K is due to HS thermal trapping. The magnetic susceptibility plot for 10 follows a more conventional shape for a gradual spin transition than does the 1D complex 6. For 10, a χMT value of ca. 3.5 cm3mol–1K is noted at 280 K, and it decreases gradually from this point until 125 K, where a low of ca. 0.5 cm3mol–1K is observed. It is suggested that incomplete relaxation to the LS state from HS thermal trapping may be the cause of the incomplete nature of the spin transition measured for 10. Eur. J. Inorg.

The structures of 1, 2 and 4 are isotructural apart from the nature of the solvent. Their asymmetric units comprise one DPPyT ligand, two crystal- lographically distinct FeII centres (Fe1 and Fe2, each on centres of inversion), each of which is chelated by a dpa moiety of DPPyT. There are also two crystallographically distinct NCX– ligands in the asymmetric units of 1, 2 and 4, each associated with one of the FeII centres; NCX1 is coordinated to Fe1, and NCX2 is coordinated to Fe2. For 1, the asymmetric unit also contains two and a half disor- dered dichloromethane molecules, whereas 2 and 4 contain two molecules of chloroform and one half-occupancy meth- anol molecule. A labelled representative example, with asso- ciated solvent omitted, appears in Figure 7. Complete asymmetric units for 1, 2 and 4 may be viewed in the Sup- porting Information, Figures S11–S23. Figure 7. Asymmetric unit for 2 with solvent omitted, labelled with insignia relevant to the crystallographic discussion and tables in the Supporting Information. Regarding the extended structures of 1, 2 and 4, the N6 coordination environment of each FeII centre is completed by two symmetry-equivalent axial trans-NCX– ligands and the chelating pyridyl groups of two symmetry-equivalent dpa moieties from two different DPPyT ligands, coordi- nated in equatorial fashion. In this manner, the structures T. M. Ross, K. S. Murray et al. FULL PAPER of 1, 2 and 4 extend into linear 1D chains [Figure 8(a), see Tables 1, 2 and 3 for Fe···Fe distances], wherein each FeII centre is linked to the next by a common DPPyT ligand, and each adjacent DPPyT ligand is rotated by 180°. The Fe1 and Fe2 centres alternate along these closely packed 1D chains [see Figure 8(b)]. The NCX– ligands extend into the spaces between the 1D chains, and S1···S2 or Se1···Se2 contacts between diagonally opposed 1D chains are present [1a: S···S 3.800(3) Å; 2a: S···S 3.796(1) Å; 4a: Se···Se 3.5885(6) Å; see Table S1 for these contacts in higher-tem- perature structures]. S···S contacts of lengths similar to those noted for 1 and 2 here have been previously reported for SCO materials.[26,27] Figure 8.

Mid-range temperature structural data show that whereas the Fe1 and Fe2 centres in 1b have Fe–Npy and Fe–NNCS distances that are not significantly different to each other (both showing admixed HS/LS char- acter), in 2b, 4b and 4c Fe1 has significantly more HS char- acter than does Fe2. This suggests that for 1 both unique FeII centres undergo a simultaneous spin transition, whereas in 2 and 4 the spin transition for Fe1 and Fe2 is slightly staggered (i.e. Fe1 and Fe2 have slightly different T1/2 values). A transposition of the asymmetric units of 2a and 2c is shown in Figure 9, where small movements of the pyridyl moieties of DPPyT resulting from Fe–N bond length contractions are seen. Figure 9. Transposition of the asymmetric units of 2a (grey wire) and 2c (black wire) with view along the b-axis. Hydrogen atoms and solvent molecules have been omitted for clarity. Changes in the unit-cell parameters are observed over the spin transition (Tables 7, 8 and 9). With decreasing tem- perature, 1 displays an overall contraction of the magnitude of a and c and the angle β, accompanied by an overall in- crease of that in b. For 2 and 4 a comparatively small, over- Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 1395–1417 © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 1403 all contraction is noted for a and c and the angle β, and b decreases as the temperature decreases. Other differences between the solvates include the magnitudes of the Σ° and Φ° parameters (see Tables 1, 2 and 3). The crystal structures of compounds 5 and 6 are gen- erally similar and are described together. Crystal data were collected at a range of temperatures (100 K for 5a and 6a, 190 K for 5b and 250 K for 6b) such that the structure of each compound in an LS state, in a mid-range or a pre- dominantly HS state was determined. For both 5 and 6, the asymmetric unit consists of one DPT or DQT ligand, respectively, coordinated equatorially to two unique FeII centres (Fe1 and Fe2, both on centres of inversion) by the terminal, chelating dpa substituents of the relevant bridging ligand. Each FeII centre is coordinated, in an axial position, by one unique NCS– ligand, viz. NCS1– and NCS2– for Fe1 and Fe2, respectively. For 5, two molecules of methanol and one molecule of water occur per asymmetric unit, and for 6 two molecules of dichloromethane occur per asymmetric unit. The asymmetric units of 5a and 5b are identical, as are the asymmetric units of 6a and 6b. Figure 10(a) displays the asymmetric unit for 6, with lat- tice solvent omitted, and labelled with Greek symbols, Ω1– 5, relevant to discussion given later here, and tables in the Supporting Information. The symbols shown in Fig- ure 10(a) are also applicable to 5, as DPT and DQT ligands have been labelled identically in each crystal structure, with the exception of the hydroxy group located on the quinol moiety of DQT, which does not appear in DPT, henceforth referred to as Oquinol. Figures of complete asymmetric units for all structures are located in the Supporting Information (Figures S24–S34). The extended structures of 5 and 6 consist of parallel- packed, infinite, linear 1D chains, wherein each FeII centre has an [FeII(NCS)2(py)4] coordination environment. Fig- ure 10(b) and (c) show the manner in which Fe1 and Fe2 centres alternate along an individual 1D chain. S···S inter- actions between NCS2– ligands within adjacent 1D chains, as well as facial π-stacking interactions between Ω5 moie- ties in adjacent 1D chains, are shown in Figure 10(c) (these are discussed further below). The disparity between the unique FeII centres in both 5 and 6, Fe1 and Fe2, is evident in the Fe–N bond lengths (Table 4). At all temperatures, for both 5 and 6, the Fe2–N distances are in good agreement with expected values for HS FeII, whereas Fe1–N distances are consistent with LS FeII in 5a and 6a, and increase with increasing temperature.[28] This suggests that while a spin transition is occurring at Fe1 sites in both 5 and 6, Fe2 sites remain HS over all temperatures. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on 5 and 6, described above, indicate a “half” SCO in each case, in agreement with these observa- tions of Fe–N bond lengths. The crystal structures of the complexes 7 and 8 were both determined at 100 K (7a and 8a) and 250 K (7b and 8b), and are generally similar. For neither 7 nor 8 was a crystal- lographic phase change noted to accompany the spin transi- tion. In each case the asymmetric unit consists of two unique FeII centres, each on a centre of inversion and each T. M. Ross, K. S. Murray et al. FULL PAPER Figure 10.

Bound to each unique FeII centre in the asymmetric units of 7 and 8 is a unique NCSe– ligand (NCSe1– for Fe1 and NCSe2– for Fe2), coordinated in axial position, similar to that seen for 5 and 6. The structures of 7 and 8 consist of zig-zag 1D chains, in which each Fe2 centre in a particular 1D chain constitutes a turning point in the direction of propagation (see Figure 11). In each zig- zag 1D chain, Fe1 and Fe2 centres alternate, and, notably, within each chain the NCSe1– and NCSe2– ligands are ori- ented in quite different directions. www.eurjic.org © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Figure 11. Packing diagram of 7a with view along the a-axis. Sol- vent and hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity. Fe1 atoms are shown as white spheres, and Fe2 atoms are shown as black spheres. Within the extended structures of 7 and 8 all zig-zag 1D chains run parallel, and are closely packed (see Figure 11). In both 7 and 8 lattice solvent molecules sit between the chains in very similar locations. In 7b and 8b (at 250 K) Fe– Npy and Fe–NNCS distances indicate that Fe2 is in the HS state, whereas for Fe1 the Fe–NNCS distances are slightly shorter than those observed for Fe2 and indicate a small LS contribution (Table 5). There is no difference between the Fe–N bond lengths in 7b and those in 8b. At 100 K, Fe–N distances in 8a indicate that both Fe1 and Fe2 are LS; however, whereas in 7a Fe1 appears to be in an LS 1D FeII Chain Compounds state, the Fe2–Npy bond lengths indicate that Fe2 has some residual HS character. It must be noted that the difference between the Fe2–Npy bond lengths in 7a and 8a is very small. The disparity in spin states between Fe1 and Fe2 sites in both 7a and 7b clearly indicates slightly different T1/2 values for Fe1 and Fe2, as has been seen previously in other SCO materials.[18] The disparity in the Fe–NNCS bond lengths between Fe1 and Fe2 in 8b, as discussed above, sug- gests that Fe1 and Fe2 in 8 also have slightly different T1/2 values, although the spin transitions of both Fe1 and Fe2 are complete at 100 K.

This was done to provide a comple- mentary method to susceptibilities for probing the gradual spin transitions observed. Care was taken to ensure that no loss of solvent occurred while microcrystalline samples were loaded into capillaries. Details of why samples 2 and 6 were measured, and not others, are given in the Supporting In- formation, the chief reason being the relative stability of the solvated forms, with attempts to measure other examples proving unsuccessful.

No crystallographic phase change was noted for 2 or 6 over the temperature range investi- gated. Such VTPXRD studies have previously been reported for a number of SCO compounds, including trans-[FeII(NCS)2- (cddt)]·2CH3OH (polymorph 1c), allowing insight into the dynamic behaviour of these materials on a molecular level as the spin transition occurs.[13,30] Anisotropy is expected in the temperature-dependent behaviour of the unit-cell pa- rameters,[28] and changes in any one parameter are generally non-linear. The curve described by the unit-cell volume of 2 as temperature decreases strongly resembles the magnetic susceptibility plot (see Supporting Information, Fig- ure S36). A total contraction of ca. 5.5% of the HS volume (taken as the volume at 250 K) is observed over the tem- perature range 250–100 K. Previous studies have shown that a total unit-cell volume contraction of ca. 2% may be attributed to the spin transition, where the remainder of the unit-cell contraction is due to isotropic thermal effects.[31] For 2, the temperature-dependent behaviour of c is sim- ilar to that observed for the unit-cell volume, where a smooth, gradual contraction of ca. 4% is noted to occur over the course of the spin transition. Figure 12(a) shows the temperature-dependent behaviour of a and b and the angle β for 2, each given as a proportion of its value at 250 K. The curve describing the evolution of b shows two subtle points of inflection (one at ca. 225 K and one at ca. 200 K), whereas a and the angle β each show a rapid con- traction within the region of 250–200 K; below 200 K each parameter continues to contract, but at a decreased rate. The fluctuations in the length of b are suggestive of com- plex dynamic phenomena in the solid-state arrangement of 2 as it undergoes the spin transition. That the majority of the change in a and the angle β, along with the two inflec- tion points in the length of b, are all localised within the region of 250–200 K, suggests that the behaviour of these lattice parameters may be interrelated. To probe the nature of this relationship, and hence the nature of the internal phenomena occurring within 2 during the spin transition, full structural data collected on single crystals of 2 were examined. By comparing the structure of 2c to that of 2b (Table 2) changes occurring as the temperature decreases from 250 to 200 K may be identified. As mentioned previously, these include a change in Fe–N bond lengths for both Fe1 and Fe2, where a greater contraction is noted at the Fe2 site, and also differences in Σ° and Φ° at both metal centres. Fe···Fe distances also decrease between 2b and 2c. In order to further probe the influence of structural rearrangements on the temperature-dependent behaviour of b, full struc- tural data have been obtained at 260 K (2d), 250 K (2e), 230 K (2f) and 220 K (2g) (see Supporting Information for full crystallographic and structural details). It was antici- pated that marked structural differences would be noted be- tween 2g at 220 K (the first point of inflection at which the length of b begins to increase with decreasing temperature) and 2b at 200 K (the second point of inflection at which b begins once more to decrease with decreas- T.

In general, it is noted that investigated parameters in 2f and 2g are intermediate to values deter- mined for 2c and 2b, with only small differences observed in several parameters between 2g and 2b, including Fe2– Npy and Fe2–NNCX, but not Fe1–Npy or Fe1–NNCX (see Tables 1, 2 and 3 and Figures S14–S20 in the Supporting Information). It is proposed that structural rearrangements occurring within the region 220–200 K, likely to involve pri- marily movement around the Fe2 site, may result in a rate of expansion in the direction of the b-axis larger than the rate of contraction due to the Fe–N bond shortening or thermal effects. No crystallographic phase changes were noted for 6 over the temperature range investigated. Full details and pictures of all unit cell parameters are provided in the Supporting Information, Table S9 and Figures S37–S39. The shape of the curve described by the temperature-dependent behav- iour of the unit-cell volume is very similar to that obtained during magnetic susceptibility measurements on 6, which is a common feature in these types of studies.[13,32] A total volume change of ca. 4.7% is observed for 6, which is con- siderably larger than that noted for trans-[FeII(NCS)2(cddt)]· www.eurjic.org © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 1395–1417 1406 2CH3OH (polymorph 1c),[13] that showed a volume change of ca. 3.5% for this “half”-SCO compound. In contrast, for 2, which displays a more complete SCO than 6, a total vol- ume change of ca. 5.5% was observed. Figure 12(b) shows the changes in the a, b and c unit-cell parameters with changing temperature for 6, which crystallises in the tri- clinic space group P1¯. Pronounced non-linearity was also observed in the angles α, β and γ (see Supporting Infor- mation, Figure S39). From Figure 12(b) it can be seen that in the temperature region 270–240 K a and b show an increased rate of change. A corresponding increased rate of change in each of the angles α, β and γ is noted within the same temperature re- gion, suggesting that the behaviour of these parameters are related i.e. due to the same phenomenon occurring on a molecular level. It has long been known that intermolecular interactions can modulate the temperature-dependent be- haviour of the unit-cell parameters.[33] As seen in Fig- ure 12(b), a decreases by a larger proportion of its HS (280 K) length than do b or c. It is suspected that the close S···S interactions occurring parallel to the b-axis direction, and the face-to-face π-stacking occurring between Ω5 moie- ties on adjacent 1D chains related by symmetry by one unit- cell length translation in the direction of the c-axis [see Fig- ure 10(c)] may restrict the amount by which b and c may contract. Structural Analysis of Mononuclear Compound 10 {trans- [FeII(NCS)2(DPT)2]·2CH3OH} The crystal structure of 10 has been determined at 100 K (10a), 200 K (10b) and 250 K (10c). No crystallographic phase transitions are observed for 10. The structure of 10 consists of monomeric units in which an FeII centre is coor- dinated by two axial NCS– ligands, and the Ω1 and Ω2 moieties of two DPT ligands. The Ω3 and Ω4 moieties of each DPT ligand remain uncoordinated, but participate in aryl interactions (see Table S6). Crystallographic refinement details are located in Table 12, and complete, labeled asym- metric units for each of 10a, 10b and 10c are in Fig- ures S28–S30. The Fe–NNCS and Fe–Npy bond lengths in 10a are consistent with expected values for LS FeII species Table 6.

This is in agreement with magnetic susceptibility measurements. A number of aryl interactions are noted to occur between monomeric units (see Table S6). The gradual nature of the spin transition observed for 10 indicates that these aromatic interactions result in little coo- perativity. Discussion All of the new 1D complexes described here display grad- ual spin transitions, as measured by susceptibilities and VTPXRD, and without any thermal hysteresis. Though some of the transitions are more abrupt than others, this behavior is generally indicative of weak cooperativity occur- ring. The various factors that affect the magnetism are now discussed. Structure–Magnetism Relations (i) Intrachain and FeII Coordination Sphere Features Each of 1, 2 and 4 displays a gradual spin transition (Fig- ure 2) in agreement with previous findings suggesting that flexible linkers between FeII centres, such as those afforded by DPPyT, are ineffective in communicating changes due to the spin transition.[34] Between the NCS– analogues, 1 dis- plays a slightly more gradual transition than 2, despite pos- sible lag effects resulting from the differing transition tem- peratures of Fe1 and Fe2 in 2. The distortion of the FeN6 octahedron has been linked to both T1/2 and the abruptness of a spin transition; for instance larger values of Φ° at HS have been linked to more abrupt transitions, whereas a larger ΔΦ° value between HS and LS for a particular metal centre has been linked to a lower value of T1/2.[25] Here, a generally smaller value of ΔΦ° is noted for 2, and this com- pound does display a higher T1/2 value than 1; however, 1 has generally larger values of Φ° at HS than 2, but displays a less abrupt spin transition. It is suggested that differences in the abruptness of the spin transition between 1 and 2 are likely contributed to by all of the subtle disparities between the solvates, as discussed further below. The linear 1D chain complexes 5 and 6 provide new ex- amples, within this dpa-substituted s-triazine bridged series, of half-crossovers with ordered –LS–HS–LS–HS– states, being observed by crystallography at temperatures below the spin transition. Other examples have been reviewed, both of the half crossover type, such as trans-[FeII(NCS)2- (cddt)]·2CH3OH (polymorph 1c),[13] and of the two-step SCO type, the latter showing ordered spin states at the in- termediate plateau.[2] It is difficult to unambiguously ident- ify both within the present DPT and DQT examples and by comparison to others studied,[13,14] why this ordering (trapping) of states occurs. One common feature is that most of these 1D compounds show two structurally dif- Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 1395–1417 © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 1407 ferent FeII sites, albeit slightly. In 5 and 6, a spin transition is occurring at the Fe1 sites (vide supra), whereas Fe2 sites remain HS over all temperatures. We did not observe diffuse scattering in the diffraction patterns of any of the present 1D complexes, as was the case in trans-[Fe(NCSe)2(bdpp)], where bdpp = 4,6-bis(2,2-dipyridylamino)pyrimidine,[14] that had an averaged LS/HS character at the intermediate plateau between the two steps of the spin transition. In that compound, 1D ordering of alternating LS/HS FeII centres occurred along the 1D chains but not between chains, and onset of the ordering was probably electronically driven. In the zig-zag chain complexes 7 and 8, the structurally distinct FeII sites again occur. Looking in some detail at these compounds, both 7 and 8 undergo a continuous, full- spin transition with T1/2 ≈175 K, where the spin transition for 7 is more gradual than that observed for 8 (Figure 4). The gradual nature of the spin transitions noted for both 7 and 8 is attributed to poor communication between in- equivalent FeII centres. It has already been established that incorporating flexible organic linkers into polymeric SCO systems is unlikely to improve cooperativity, and although cooperative interactions are possible by Se···Se interactions, discussed below, these occur only between equivalent FeII centres within 7 and 8. Thus, although cooperative interac- tions are possible between equivalent FeII centres, differ- ences in T1/2 between Fe1 and Fe2 likely contribute to the gradual nature of the spin transition observed on the bulk. The crystal structures of 7 and 8 are remarkably similar, and there are few notable differences. In the comparison of 7a to 8a differences in structural parameters cannot be identified as either inherent or due to the inequivalence of spin states. Thus, between 7b and 8b, where 7 and 8 are in equivalent stages of the spin transition, as judged by the Fe–N bond lengths, differences in the various parameters listed in Tables 5, 11 and S7 are limited to: Φ° at both FeII centres, ΣFe2°, Se1···centroidtriazine and Se2···centroidtriazine, and the length of the unit-cell parameter b. It has been noted in discussing the DPPyT examples that distortions of the FeN6 octahedron can affect both the T1/2 value and the abruptness of a spin transition, and that larger values of Φ° in the HS state correlate to a more abrupt spin transi- tion.[25,28] Differences in the FeN6 octahedron distortions between 7 and 8 are, however, quite small. It is suggested that the subtle packing differences between these solvates, in combination with the influence on ligand electronics of the different solvation modes, culminate in a larger differ- ence in T1/2 between Fe1 and Fe2 in 7 than in 8, causing a larger “lag” effect observed in bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements. (ii) Intermolecular and Inter-Chain Effects, Including Solvent H-Bonding Interactions We begin by discussing interactions involving the non- bonded sulfur atoms of the NCS– ligands in the DPT-and DQT-bridged species 5 and 6. Table 4 contains a number of bond lengths, angles and close contacts relevant to the NCS1– and NCS2– ligands. It is notable that for both 5 and 6, NCS1– and NCS2– participate in S···π interactions T. M. Ross, K. S. Murray et al. FULL PAPER between the electron-rich S atom of the NCS– ligands and the electron-deficient s-triazine ring of DPT or DQT.[35] As can be seen in Figure 10(c), the NCS2– ligands are posi- tioned such that they participate in S···S interactions be- tween adjacent chains related by one unit-cell length trans- lation in the b-axis direction (see Table 4). Such close S···S contacts between NCS– ligands have been noted previously in SCO compounds.[26] Although packing diagrams are for 5a, the situation is analogous for the structures 5b, 6a and 6b. An S···O interaction is noted in 6 between NCS1– and Oquinol on adjacent chains generated by symmetry by one unit-cell length translation in the direction of the a-axis [6a: S1···Oquinol 3.275(4) Å]. It is also noted that Ω5 substituents of both DPT and DQT in 5 and 6, respectively, engage in an apparent slipped face-to-face π-stacking interaction be- tween adjacent 1D chains related by symmetry by one unit- cell length translation in the direction of the c-axis [in 5a the closest C···C distance is 3.285(7) Å, with a centroid– centroid separation of 5.30 Å, and in 6a the closest C···C distance is 3.18(1) Å, with a centroid–centroid separation of 5.06 Å]. These slipped π-stacking interactions form a sol- vent-free “pocket”, isolating NCS2– ligands from areas where lattice solvent is located [Figure 10 (c)] for 5. Whereas the NCS2– ligands are largely isolated from lat- tice solvent in solvent-free pockets, NCS1– ligands point di- rectly into solvent-filled pockets between 1D chains. Fig- ure 13(a) shows a packing diagram for 5, with solvent mole- cules included. As illustrated in Figure 13(b) the solvent in 5 forms a localised hydrogen-bonding network. The net- work consists of a central six-membered (H2O)2(CH3OH)4 ring, and the water molecules of this ring also hydrogen- bond to the S atoms of NCS1– ligands on adjoining chains. Thus, adjacent chains are connected through the interca- lated hydrogen-bonding solvent. The S···O and O···O dis- tances relevant to this H-bonding network for 5a are S1···O4 3.214(4), O4···O2 2.847(5), O4···O3 2.734(6), O2···O3 2.755(5) Å. The analogous pocket in 6 also con- tains solvent molecules, in this case four dichloromethane molecules. Superficially, the arrangement of the solvent molecules looks similar to that of 5, as shown in Figure 13(c); how- ever, there are only four solvent molecules present, not six, and the closest contacts between the solvent molecules and the NCS– anions are more consistent with van der Waals contacts than with the significant hydrogen bonding seen in 5. The contact distances shown in Figure 13(c) for 6a are S1···Cl1 3.494(2), Cl4···H32B 2.883, S1···H33B 2.835 Å. Whereas the contact distances within the (H2O)2(CH3- OH)4 localised hydrogen-bonding network in 5 do not change between 5a to 5b, the contact distances in the van der Waals contacts between the lattice dichloromethane molecules and NCS– ligands in 6 become larger between 6a and 6b (see Table S5 in the Supporting Information). It is suggested that the localised (H2O)2(CH3OH)4 hydro- gen-bonding network in 5 provides the imperative for the small Fe1–N–CNCX° change noted to occur between 5a and 5b, where no such change in Fe1–N–CNCX° is observed for 6. It is thought that the (H2O)2(CH3OH)4 hydrogen-bond- www.eurjic.org © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 1395–1417 1408 Figure 13. (a) Packing diagram for 5a, showing a view along the b- axis, with the localised (H2O)2(CH3OH)4 hydrogen-bonding net- work (hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity); (b) localised (H2O)2(CH3OH)4 hydrogen-bonding network in 5; (c) analogous solvent pocket in 6 incorporating lattice dichloromethane mole- cules, as described in the text (here, dashed lines represent closest contacts, not hydrogen bonds). Fe1 atoms are shown as white spheres, and Fe2 atoms are shown as black spheres. ing network in 5 is more effective for communication of changes due to the spin transition than the van der Waals contacts involving dichloromethane molecules in 6, and this contributes to the more abrupt nature of the spin transition observed for 5 in comparison to that seen for 6. Other sub- tle differences between 5 and 6, as explored above, may also contribute to differences between the spin transitions ob- served for these compounds. Turning now to NCSe– effects in 7 and 8, within their extended structures, close Se···Se contacts are noted be- tween Fe1 centres on adjacent chains (see Table 5), and also 1D FeII Chain Compounds between Fe2 centres on adjacent chains, such that Se1···Se1 and Se2···Se2 interactions form an extended intermolecular network between 1D chains. Other interchain contacts in- clude a face-to-face π-stacking interaction occurring be- tween Ω5 moieties of diagonally adjacent 1D chains (see Table S7). Se···O interactions are noted between both NCSe1– ligands and Oquinol on adjacent chains; in 7a the length of this contact is 3.329(6) Å and for 8a it is 3.34(1) Å (Table S7). Finally, we note that interchain S···S and Se···Se interac- tions of the kind just discussed likewise occur in the DPPyT-bridged complexes 1, 2 and 4, respectively, with contact distances given in the Results section above. Furthermore, in relation to the NCX– groups, and as found for the other 1D compounds described here, X···centroidtriazine distances (Tables 1, 2 and 3) are indica- tive of S···π interactions between the electron-rich S or Se atoms of the NCX– ligands and the electron-deficient s-tri- azine ring of the DPPyT ligand.[26] Such interactions were also noted in the related monomeric compound trans-[FeII- (dpyatriz)2(NCS)2][26] [where dpyatriz = N2,N2,N4,N4,N6,N6- hexa(pyridin-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine] and the 1D chain series trans-[FeII(cddt)(NCX)2]·Solvent.[13] Although the ligand DPPyT was designed to include a number of aromatic moieties in order to promote intermolecular inter- actions of the π–π type between 1D chains, such interac- tions do not occur extensively here. An edge-to-face C– H···π interaction is noted between the Ω3 and Ω4 pyridyl rings on diagonally adjacent chains, and here the closest C···C contact in 1a is 3.69(1) Å, in 2a is 3.799(6) Å and in 4a is 3.782(6) Å. (iii)Solvent Effects In the DPPyT derivatives, solvent molecules are located in similar positions in the lattice for 1, 2 and 4, and X···O interactions are present between NCX1– ligands and lattice methanol molecules for 2 and 4 (see Table S1), in a related manner to that discussed in (ii) for 5. The effects, upon the magnetic and photomagnetic data, of partial or full desol- vation of the 2.5CH2Cl2 molecules in 1 {trans-[FeII(NCS)2- (DPPyT)]·2.5CH2Cl2}, viz. 1α, 1β and 1γ, have been de- scribed earlier. Unfortunately, in comparison to recent work on dinuclear FeII SCO complexes that employed related li- gands to those used here,[36] where we were able to structur- ally characterise some of the partial CH2Cl2 solvates, we do not have crystal structure data here on any of the desolvated forms due to loss of crystallinity. The solvent-dependent observations on 1 therefore remain descriptive. In the com- plex 5 {trans-[FeII(NCS)2(DPT)]·2CH3OH·H2O} the T1/2 value moved 25 K to a lower temperature upon full desol- vation (5α) whereas the spin transition remained “half”. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the Fe1 and Fe2 sites retain their parental symmetry and the –LS–HS–LS–HS– states remain ordered below T1/2 in the fully desolvated form, the change in T1/2 being largely due to the loss of the interchain H-bonded solvent network present in 5. In contrast, the partially desolvated form 5β, coated in grease Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 1395–1417 © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 1409 and used in LIESST studies, showed a more gradual, half- spin transition, probably due to disruption of the connect- ing MeOH·H2O network. Conclusions We have described the synthesis and characterisation of three new s-triazinebis(dpa) ligands, DPPyT, DPT and DQT, containing different substituents on the s-triazine ring, and several SCO FeII coordination complexes of type trans-[FeII(NCX)2(L)n] incorporating L as a bridging (n = 1) or terminal (n = 2) chelator, in 1D and 0D complexes, respectively. It is noted that generally solvation and dimen- sionality of the obtained products is unpredictable and gov- erned by subtle factors. The ligand DPPyT has afforded a less diverse range of products in comparison to DPT and DQT, giving only linear 1D chains in spite of solvent or NCX– ligands used in trans-[FeII(NCX)2(DPPyT)]·Solvent systems, whereas the (perhaps) more flexible ligands DPT and DQT have given a range of linear and zig-zag 1D chains, as well as two monomeric compounds. Compounds 5 and 6 show a “half” SCO in magnetic susceptibility studies, whereas X-ray crystal structures, solved at low temperatures, reveal ordered HS and LS FeII centres that alternate along linear 1D chains. In contrast, the 1D complexes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8, the latter two dis- playing zig-zag chains, and the monomers 9 and 10, show full HS-to-LS spin transitions. Magnetic susceptibility and LIESST susceptibility measurements, in conjunction with VTPXRD studies (on 2 and 6) have found that all the 1D materials undergo continuous and gradual spin transitions, and it is suggested that low cooperativity is inherent in these types of materials. LIESST measurements taken on the par- ent solvate 1, and samples of 1 desolvated under different regimes, revealed marked differences in magnetic character. The metastable, light-induced HS state is more stable for a sample of 1 that contains less lattice dichloromethane (1β), as determined by LIESST experiments. LIESST measure- ments on 6 and a partially desolvated sample of 5 (viz. 5β) give characteristic T(LIESST) temperatures of 52 K and 58 K, respectively, and 5β shows a greater photoconversion efficiency at low temperatures than 6. These compare to the T(LIESST) for 1β of 30 K. Finally, whereas the present work is descriptive and phenomenological, a few brief comments are warranted on how SCO compounds of the present type fit in, or relate to, the recent quantitative ab initio calculations of Robert et al.[8,9] that point to cooperativity/hysteresis in bistable, crystalline SCO FeII monomers essentially arising from the Madelung fields produced by the electrostatic effect, upon the FeII molecules, of the surrounding crystal environment. The model was capable of deducing the cooperativity fac- tors calculated for hysteresis loops by Slichter and Drick- amer who used regular solution theory.[37] It also comple- ments the Spiering model for elastic driven (intermolecular energy) cooperativity.[38] Much of the emphasis in this pa- per on using covalent bridges, in coordination polymers, T. M. Ross, K. S. Murray et al. FULL PAPER and intermolecularly related communication networks, such as weak van der Waal forces, to enhance cooperativity, has not worked out in practice. Supramolecular interactions of the kind described here, such as aromatic forces, π–π stack- ing, H-bonding and solvent effects, are known to affect coo- perativity, often leading to hysteretic behaviour,[5,39] but that is not the case here. Indeed, many such interactions are re- garded by Robert and co-workers as being primarily to sta- bilise the 3D crystal lattice structure, the latter then provid- ing the electrostatic forces that drive cooperativity. The monomeric complex 10 shows a χMT vs. T behaviour that is non-hysteretic and similar to that found by Létard et al.[39] for the monomeric complex cis-[Fe(pm-aza)- (NCS)2] {where pm-aza = N-(2-pyridylmethylene)-4-(phen- ylazo)aniline} for which related compounds showed stronger cooperativity and large hysteresis loops. The inter- molecular cooperativity factor, Γ, for cis-[Fe(pm-aza)- (NCS)2], deduced by Robert et al. was ca. 0 K, whereas the analogue with ΔT = 40 K had Γ = 444 K. The Γ value for 10 will be likewise negligible and remains to be tested by using the structural data provided here. Coordination polymeric SCO materials of the present 1D kind, 1–8, or of the iconic and highly hysteretic [Fe(4R- 1,2,4-triazole)3](anion)2 kind,[6] do not fit into Robert’s present calculations, as far as we can judge, and this re- mains a calculational challenge for the future. As well as Madelung potentials induced on the 1D chains, and on the constituent FeII chromophores in their LS and HS forms, by the lattice, the effects of covalently bridged nearest neighbours needs to be considered. The ordered –LS–HS– LS–HS– forms observed here, for some of the complexes, present an intriguing challenge for such calculations. Can they be rationalised or even predicted beforehand? Mean- while, Kepert is using the mean field model[37] to success- fully simulate hysteresis loops in a variety of polynuclear SCO materials, including two-step transitions, in which the covalent bridging ligands are simply regarded as springs.[40] From an experimental perspective, high-resolution crystal- lography and photocrystallography would be useful on polynuclear FeII crossover systems of the present 1D type to obtain electron densities of the kind recently observed for monomers,[41,42] and thus identify intermolecular inter- actions and provide back-up information for calculations of cooperativity.

Care was taken to allow long thermal equilibration times at each tem- perature point, and warming and cooling modes were employed to detect HS thermal trapping. Photomagnetic characterisation for samples of 1 and 5 was carried out at CNRS, Université de Bordeaux, ICMCB, with a Spectrum Physics Series 2025 Kr+ laser coupled through an optical fibre into the cavity of the MPMS-55 Quantum design SQUID magnetome- ter operating at 2 T. Samples were prepared as a thin layer (ca. 0.1 mg) to promote full penetration of the irradiated light. The sample weight was obtained by comparing its thermal spin transi- tion behaviour with a heavier and accurately weighed sample.[12] The sample was first slowly cooled to 10 K by ensuring that poten- tial trapping of HS species at low temperatures did not occur. Irra- diation to photosaturation was carried out a number of times at different wavelengths (i.e. 337/356.4, 406.7/415.4, 532, 647.1/676.4, 752.5/799.3 nm) to determine which source was most efficient at a power intensity of 5 mWcm–2 (to prevent warming of the sample). Samples were then cooled to 10 K and irradiated with green light (λ = 532 nm at 5 mWcm–2 was found to be the most efficient) until photosaturation was reached. Then, in the absence of irradiation, the temperature was increased at a rate of 0.3 K min–1. The extreme of the δχMT/δT vs. T plot gave the T(LIESST) values for 1β and 5β, defined as the temperature for which the light-induced HS infor- mation is erased.[12] At 10 K, the samples 1β and 5β were again irradiated to photosaturation, and in the absence of irradiation the relaxation kinetics at 10, 25, 32, 35, 38 and 40 K were measured for 1β; for sample 1γ relaxation kinetics were measured in this man- ner only at 10 K. The relaxation kinetics were measured at 10, 20, 45, 50, 54, 56, 60, 65, 70 and 75 K for 5β. See Supporting Infor- mation for further details. Mössbauer Effect Measurements: These were carried out by using a conventional constant acceleration drive with a symmetric saw- tooth waveform at 77 and 295 K in the School of Physics, Monash University. Fitting of spectra used both Voigtian and Lorentzian lineshape functions from the Recoil analysis software (Intelligent Scientific Applications, Inc.). The instrument was calibrated with α-iron. Isomer shifts are referenced to α-iron at room temperature. Crystallographic Data Collection and Refinement: Crystallographic data and parameters for 1a–c, 2a–c and 4a–c are summarised in Tables 7, 8 and 9. Single-crystal diffraction data for these structures were collected with a Bruker APEX X8 diffractometer by using Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation and equipped with an Oxford Instruments nitrogen gas cryostream. Crystals were mounted on glass fibres in a small amount of oil. For 1a, a single crystal was quench-cooled to 250(2) K, with subsequent slow cooling to 160(2) K for 1b and 100(2) K for 1c. For 2a, a single crystal was quench-cooled to 123(2) K, and subsequently a single crystal was cooled to 200(2) K for 2b and then slowly heated to 250(2) K for 2c. For 4a, a single crystal was quench-cooled to 100(2) K, and subsequently a single crystal was quench-cooled to 240(2) K for 4b, 1D FeII Chain Compounds followed by slow heating to 260(2) K for 4c. Initial diffraction-data analysis was performed by using the APEX2 software package.[43] The structures were solved by using SHELXS and refined by using SHELXL-97 within the graphical interface X-Seed.[44] All non-hy- drogen atoms in the structures were refined anisotropically (unless specified), and hydrogen atoms were generated by using the riding model. Special refinement details are located in the Supporting In- formation. Data for 2d, 2e, 2f, 2g and 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 were col- lected at the Australian Synchrotron by using the MX1 beamline Table 7.

For 2d–g the beamline was operating at λ = 0.77487 Å, and for 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 the beamline was operating at λ = 0.77506 Å. The collection temperature was maintained at specified temperatures by using an open-flow N2 cryostream. A sample of 2 was mounted at 260 K whereupon data for 2d was collected, and was then cooled slowly from this temperature, at each collection point allowing long thermal equilibration times.

Diffraction data were collected at the Powder Diffraction T. M. Ross, K. S. Murray et al. FULL PAPER Beamline (10-BM-1) at the Australian Synchrotron. The glass capil- lary was mounted and aligned concentrically to the rotation of the three-axis diffractometer, and data were collected by using a MYTHEN strip detector. The wavelength was determined to be 1.00049 Å by using NIST standard 660a, LaB6. The sample tem- perature was controlled by using an open-flow N2 cryostream, and data were collected at 180 s exposure times at five degree intervals from 250 K to 100 K. Le Bail analyses of the variable-temperature diffraction data were performed within RIETICA.[29] Details of the refinements are included in the Supporting Information, Table S8. A pulverised sample of trans-[FeII(NCS)2(DQT)]·2CH2Cl2 (6) was loaded in a polyimide capillary of 0.8 mm diameter and kept in an inert helium atmosphere for the duration of the experiments.[47] The X-rays (λ = 0.61832 Å) available at the 1-BM beamline at the Ad- vanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory were used in combination with an MAR-345 imaging plate (IP) detector to record diffraction patterns. The sample temperature was controlled by using an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream Plus, and data were collected in 6 s exposures upon a quench-cooled sample with con- tinuous warming from ca. 103 K to ca. 283 K at 100 Kh–1. This corresponds to the collection of diffraction images at 3 K intervals. The raw images were processed by using Fit-2D.[48,49] The sample- to-detector distance and tilt of the IP relative to the beam were refined by using an LaB6 standard. Le Bail analyses of the variable- temperature diffraction data were performed within GSAS.[50] De- tails of the refinements are included in Table S9.

The resultant dark brown solution was allowed to cool, diluted with distilled water (30 mL), and then extracted with chloroform (350 mL). The volume of the organic phase was reduced in vacuo to leave a dark brown oil, which was purified by column chromatography (SiO2; tetrahydrofuran/dichloromethane, 1:1; Rf = 0.65) to yield an off-white powder. The white powder was isolated by filtration and then dissolved in a minimum of hot acetone (5 mL); distilled water (80 mL) was added until a white precipitate began to form.

The values used to calculated the Arrhenius plot are as follows: T = 50 K σ = 75 cm-1 k = 1.3 x 10-4 s-1; T = 54 K σ = 60 cm-1 k = 4.0 x 10-4 s-1; T = 56 K σ = 61 cm-1 k = 7.8 x 10-4 s-1; T = 60 K σ = 48 cm-1 k = 2.1 x 10-3 s-1; T = 65 K σ = 27 cm-1 k = 6.4 x 10-3 s-1; T = 70 K σ = 0.3 cm-1 k = 1.5 x 10-2 s-1. From this plot, is has been determined that Ea = 585 cm-1, σ = ~60 cm-1, and k∞= 2.6 x 103 s-1. Synthetic Details for compounds 5-10 The 1D chain complex 5 contains two molecules of methanol and one molecule of water in its crystal lattice (per [FeII(NCS)2(DPT)] unit), and was formed serendipitously due to trace amounts of water in the methanol and/or dichloromethane used as a reaction medium during initial syntheses. Subsequent attempts at deliberate synthesis of 5 proved successful, with 5 forming upon the introduction of larger amounts of water to the methanol/dichloromethane reaction medium. As a point of interest, attention is drawn to the robust synthetic route to the dichloromethane solvate 6. This reproducible synthesis of 6 was conducted under conditions similar to those which resulted in the original, unexpected formation of 1, without inclusion of either water or methanol into the crystal lattice. Despite the use of 1:1 molar quantities of Fe(NCX)2:DPT, which should have been suitable for the formation of 1D polymeric chains, monomers were surprisingly formed, in all cases, when a single solvent (methanol) was used as the reaction medium. As seen for 9 and 10, monomeric species were the sole products formed when DPT was reacted with Fe(NCX)2. This was independent of the NCX- ligand introduced, or of the concentration 12 of the reactants employed. Indeed, 10 could be formed via different synthetic approaches, with crystals suitable for single crystal diffraction studies obtained by use of slow diffusion of reactants in an H-shaped tube, whereas bulk studies were performed on a microcrystalline sample of 10 that was precipitated, immediately, from a solution containing much higher concentrations of reactants. During repeated attempts to synthesise 1D polymeric materials from methanol with Fe(NCSe)2, the monomeric compound 10 was consistently formed. Crystals of 9 were formed as heavily intergrown yellow plates and could not be separated adequately for single crystal diffraction studies, however, microanalytical data are consistent with a monomeric species. Attempts were made to determine whether or not a similar phenomenon could be observed when employing the ligand DQT. However, crystals suitable for single-crystal diffraction studies could not be obtained, and powdered samples analysed by thermogravimetric analysis and microanalysis suggested a mixture of products. Details of these results are not included herein. The 1D chain complex 7 could be formed via low- and high-concentration reaction conditions (Method 1 and 2 respectively) where reagents were diffused slowly together in a three-component solvent system (methanol, dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane). Characterisation of 7 has proven challenging. Crystals suitable for single-crystal X-Ray diffraction studies were obtained under low-concentration reaction conditions (Method 1). The crystals formed under high-concentration reactions conditions were of too poor a quality for use in diffraction studies. The lattice solvent composition determined by single crystal data on 7 consists of one half of a 1,2-dichloroethane molecule and one half of a dichloromethane molecule, along with some residual electron density that cannot be easily assigned, but indicating the presence of highly disordered lattice solvent molecules. Thermogravimetric analysis on products formed via both Method 1 and Method 2 shows a loss of ~18% weight by approximately 150oC, which is consistent with a loss of one 1,2-dichloroethane molecule and one dichloromethane molecule (Fig. S5). It is clear from thermogravimetric analysis that some lattice solvent is easily lost upon removal of the product from a blanketing layer of solvent. This phenomenon is reflected in microanalytical results, where for the sample of 7 made via Method 1 microanalytical data suggest the loss of the equivalent of one half of a molecule of dichloromethane and one half of a molecule of 1,2-dichloroethane per [FeII(NCSe)2(DQT)] unit. However, for the sample of 7 made via Method 2 microanalytical data fit well for one molecule of dichloromethane and one molecule of 1,2-dichloroethane per [FeII(NCSe)2(DQT)] unit. This suggests that sample treatment during microanalytical measurements was different for sample made via Method 1 and Method 2. A lattice solvation of one 1,2-dichloromethane and one dichloromethane molecule is therefore assigned as the lattice solvation of 7. Magnetic moment measurements were performed on the sample made via Method 2. The compound 8 similarly has a [FeII(NCSe)2(DQT)]•Solvate constitution, for which microanalytical data suggest a lattice solvation of one half molecule of methanol and one and a half molecules of dichloromethane per [FeII(NCSe)2DQT] unit. Sufficient sample of 8 was not available for thermogravimetric studies, but single crystal X-ray data supports this assignment of lattice solvation. trans-[FeII(NCSe)2(DQT)]•CH2Cl2•CH2ClCH2Cl (7) Method 1 by which crystals suitable for single crystal X-Ray diffraction were obtained. Fe(ClO4)2•xH2O (9.6 mg, 0.038 mmol) and KNCSe (10.8 mg, 0.076 mmol) were dissolved in methanol (2 ml) along with 10.8 mg (0.076 mmol) of KNCSe, and the mixture was stirred for five minutes and then allowed to 13 stand for three hours at 0oC to precipitate KClO4. After this time, DQT (20 mg, 0.038 mmol) was dissolved in 1:1 1,2-dichloroethane:dichloromethane (3 ml), and a mixture of 6:1:1 methanol:dichloromethane:1,2- dichloroethane (8 ml) was layered carefully on top of the DQT solution. The methanolic solution of Fe(NCSe)2 was layered on top of this, and the reaction vial was stoppered. The solutions were allowed to slowly diffuse together, and over the course of one week small orange block crystals formed, which were collected immediately and washed with 1:1 1,2-dichloroethane: dichloromethane (3 x 5 ml) (25.5 mg, 76.5%).

Method 2 In methanol (5 ml), Fe(ClO4)2•xH2O (48 mg, 0.189 mmol) and KNCSe (55 mg, 0.379 mmol) were dissolved, and the mixture was stirred for five minutes and then allowed to stand for three hours at 0oC to precipitate KClO4. After this time, DQT (100 mg, 0.189 mmol) was dissolved in 1:1 1,2-dichloroethane:dichloromethane (5 ml), and a mixture of 6:1:1 methanol:dichloromethane:1,2-dichloroethane (8 ml) was layered carefully on top of the DQT solution. The methanolic solution of Fe(NCSe)2 was layered on top of this, and the reaction vial was stoppered. The solutions were allowed to slowly diffuse together, and over the course of one week small orange block crystals formed, which were collected immediately and washed with 1:1 1,2- dichloroethane:dichloromethane (3 x 5 ml) (127 mg, 68.8%).

Special Refinement Details for 1 to 4 Single crystal diffraction data for structures 1a - 1c, 2a -2c and 4a - 4c were collected on a Bruker APEX X8 diffractometer using Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation and equipped with an Oxford Instruments nitrogen gas cryostream. Crystals were mounted on glass fibre in a small amount of oil. For 1a, a single crystal was quench- cooled to 250(2) K, with subsequent slow cooling to 160(2) K for 1b and 100(2) K for 1c. For 2a, a single crystal was quench-cooled to 123(2) K, and subsequently a single crystal was cooled to 200(2) K for 2b and then slowly heated to 250(2) K for 2c. For 4a, a single crystal was quench-cooled to 100(2) K, and subsequent a single crystal was quench cooled to 240(2) K for 4b and subsequently heated to 260(2) K for 4c. Diffraction data analysis was performed using SAINT+ within the APEX2 software package.[1] Empirical absorption corrections were applied to all data using SADABS.[2] The structures were solved using SHELXS and refined using SHELXL-97 within the graphical interface X-Seed.[3] All non–hydrogen atoms in the structures were refined anisotropically (unless specified) and hydrogen atoms were generated using the riding model. Data for 2d, 2e, 2f and 2g were collected at the Australian Synchrotron using the MX1 beam-line operating at ~1.6 KeV (λ = 0.77487 Å). The collection temperature was maintained at specified temperatures using an open- flow N2 cryostream. A sample of 2 was mounted at 260 K whereupon data for 2d was collected, and was then cooled slowly from this temperature, at each collection point allowing long thermal equilibration times. Data 14 were collected using the Blue Ice software.[4] Initial data processing was carried out using the XDS package.[5] All structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97.3 Least-squares refinements against F2 were carried out using SHELXL-97, using the program X-Seed as a graphical interface.3 All hydrogen atoms were placed in idealised positions and refined using a riding model. Data was collected using the shortest wavelength available and the shortest crystal-detector distance with a phi-stage. Collection to high 2θ values was not possible using this set-up resulting in low data completeness (approx. 95 %). In all instances, however, the data- to-parameter ratios remain very good. 1a (1 at 100 K) The structure of 1a contained a number of highly disordered dichloromethane molecules. Within the dichloromethane molecules all carbon to chlorine distances were restrained to be 1.70(1) Å. The distance between Cl5 and Cl6A, and Cl5 and Cl6B was restrained to be 2.90(1) Å. ISOR restraints were applied to C33, Cl6A, Cl6B, Cl2B and Cl3B. Hydrogen atoms were not assigned to C31 and C33. A 2θ = 50 limit was employed during data refinement due to weak diffraction. 1b (1 at 160K) The structure of 1b contained a number of highly disordered dichloromethane molecules. Within dichloromethane molecules all carbon to chlorine distances were restrained to be 1.70(1) Å. The distance between Cl5 and Cl6A, and Cl5 and Cl6B were restrained to be 2.90(1) Å. Similarly, the distance between Cl3B and Cl4B was restrained to be 2.90(1) Å. ISOR restraints were applied to C33, Cl3B, Cl6B, and C31. Hydrogen atoms were not assigned to C31 and C33. The atoms Cl5 and Cl2B were refined isotropically. A 2θ = 50 limit was employed during data refinement due to weak diffraction. 1c (1 at 250 K) The structure of 1c contained a number of highly disordered dichloromethane molecules. Although the crystal on which these data were collected was also used for 1a and 1b, dichloromethane molecules were more highly disordered in the higher temperature structure 1c, and therfore not all molecules could be accurately modelled leaving significant peaks in the difference map. As this high temperature structure was collected prior to the structures 1a (at 100K) and 1b (at 160K), which were collected upon cooling of the same crystal, it is not suspected that solvent present and refined in these lower temperature structures has been lost. Although dichloromethane molecules were not found in exactly the same positions in 1c as they are in 1a and 1b (chlorine atom labels in 1c do not relate to those found in 1a and 1b), electron density due to dichloromethane molecules is located in the same general area of the crystal structure. All carbon to chlorine distances within dichloromethane molecules were restrained to be 1.70(1) Å. The distance between Cl1 and Cl2A, and Cl1 and Cl2B, was restrained to be 2.90(1) Å.

ISOR restraints were used on C31, Cl6A, Cl4B and Cl4A. 2f (2 at 230 K) The structure of 2f contained a large amount of very disordered solvent. Carbon to chlorine bond lengths were restrained to be 1.70(1) Å for both the full occupancy chloroform molecule and both parts of the disordered chloroform molecule. Hydrogen atoms were not assigned to the half occupancy methanol molecule. Distances between chlorine atoms in the chloroform molecules were restrained to be 2.75(1) Å.

Special Crystallographic Refinement Details for 5 to 10 This research was undertaken on the MX1 beamline at the Australian Synchrotron, Victoria, Australia. Crystallographic data and parameters for all materials are summarised in Table 3. Single crystal data were collected at the Australian Synchrotron using the MX1 beam-line operating at ~1.60 KeV (λ = 0.77506 Å). The collection temperature was maintained at specified temperatures using an open-flow N2 cryostream. Samples of 5 and 6 were quench cooled to 100(2) K, and then warmed to higher temperatures for subsequent data collections. Samples of 10, 7 and 8 were quench cooled to 250(2) K and then cooled further for subsequent data collections. Data collection was carried out using Blue Ice.[4] Initial data processing was carried out using the XDS package.[5] All structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97.[3] Least-squares refinements against F2 were carried out using SHELXL-97, using the program X-Seed as a graphical interface.[3] All hydrogen atoms were placed in idealised positions and refined using a riding model, except for 1 where hydrogen atoms on the water molecule were located in the difference map. Data was collected using the shortest wavelength available and the shortest crystal-detector distance with a phi- stage. Collection to high 2θ values was not possible using this set-up resulting in low data completeness (approx. 90 %), however, in all instances the data-to-parameter ratios remain very good. 5a (1 at 100 K) The structure of 5a contained one water molecule for which hydrogen peaks were located in the difference map (labelled H4A and H4B). Both H4A and H4B were refined isotropically, and both the distances O4 to H4A, and O4 to H4B, were restrained to be 0.86(1) Å. The Uiso of H4B was constrained to be 0.08. 17 5b (5 at 190 K) The structure of 5b contained one water molecule for which hydrogen peaks were located in the difference map. Both H4A and H4B were refined isotropically, and both the distances O4 to H4A, and O4 to H4B, were restrained to be 0.86(1) Å. The Uiso of H4B was constrained to be 0.08. 7a (7 at 100 K) Within the structure of 7a only one half molecule of dichloromethane and one half molecule of 1,2-dichloroethane could be confidently assigned from the difference map. Large residual peaks in the difference map in the vicinity of the solvent are due to another half molecule equivalent of dichloromethane and another half molecule equivalent of 1,2-dichloroethane that could not be accurately modelled. Although experiments on the bulk material (TGA and microanalysis) determined that 7 consisted of one molecule of dichloromethane and one molecule of 1,2-dichloroethane per asymmetric unit, as only half of a dichloromethane molecule and half of a 1,2-dichloroethane molecule could be located in the difference map, the molecular formula used for 7a reflects this. Within the dichloromethane molecule, carbon to chlorine distances were restrained to be 1.7(1) Å. Within the 1,2-dichloroethane molecule, carbon to chlorine distances were restrained to be 1.7(1) Å, and the distance C33 to C34 was restrained to be 1.5(1) Å. ISOR restraints were applied to Cl1, Cl2, Cl3, C32, C33, C34. 7b (7 at 100 K) Within the structure of 7b only one half molecule of dichloromethane and one half molecule of 1,2-dichloroethane could be confidently assigned from the difference map. Large residual peaks in the difference map in the vicinity of the solvent are due to another half molecule equivalent of dichloromethane and another half molecule equivalent of 1,2-dichloroethane that could not be accurately modelled. Although experiments on the bulk material (TGA, Fig S40, and microanalysis) determined that 7 consisted of one molecule of dichloromethane and one molecule of 1,2-dichloroethane per asymmetric unit, as only half of a dichloromethane molecule and half of a 1,2-dichloroethane molecule could be located in the difference map, the molecular formula used for 7b reflects this. Within the dichloromethane molecule, carbon to chlorine distances were restrained to be 1.7(1) Å. Within the 1,2-dichloroethane molecule, carbon to chlorine distances were restrained to be 1.7(1) Å, and the distance C33 to C34 was restrained to be 1.5(1) Å. ISOR restraints were applied to Cl1, Cl2, Cl3, Cl4, C32, C33, C34. 8a (8 at 100 K) The structure of 6a contains one molecule of dichloromethane, disordered over two places, and one half molecule of methanol. Large residual peaks in the difference map in the vicinity of this solvent are due to further disorder of the solvent that could not be accurately modelled. Although experiments on the bulk material (microanalysis) determined that 8 consisted of one and a half molecules of dichloromethane and one half molecule of methanol per asymmetric unit, as only one dichloromethane molecule and half of a methanol molecule could be located in the difference map, the molecular formula used for 8a reflects this. Carbon to chlorine distances within the dichloromethane molecules were restained to be 1.7(1) Å, and the distance between Cl1 to Cl2 was restrained to be 2.9(1) Å. The oxygen to carbon distance within the methanol molecule was restrained to be 1.4(1) Å. Hydrogen atoms were not assigned to C33, C34 or O3. ISOR restraints have been applied to Cl1, Cl2, Cl3, C32, C34, N8, Fe2, N5, N7, N8, C3, C14, C20, C27 and N9. Hydrogen atoms have not been assigned to the half occupancy methanol molecule, nor have they been assigned to the half occupancy dichloromethane molecule comprising Cl3, Cl4 and C33. 18 8b (8 at 250 K) The structure of 8b contains one molecule of dichloromethane, disordered over two places, and one half molecule of methanol. Large residual peaks in the difference map in the vicinity of this solvent are due to further disorder of the solvent that could not be accurately modelled. Although experiments on the bulk material (microanalysis) determined that 8 consisted of one and a half molecules of dichloromethane and one half molecule of methanol per asymmetric unit, as only one dichloromethane molecule and half of a methanol molecule could be located in the difference map, the molecular formula used for 8b reflects this. Carbon to chlorine distances within the dichloromethane molecules were restained to be 1.7(1) Å. The oxygen to carbon distance within the methanol molecule was restrained to be 1.4(1) Å. ISOR restraints were applied to C32, Cl2 and Cl4. The following atoms were refined isotropically: C33, C34, O3, Cl3 and Cl4. Hydrogen atoms have not been assigned to the half occupancy methanol molecule, nor have they been assigned to the half occupancy dichloromethane molecule comprising Cl3, Cl4 and C33. 10a (10 at 100 K) The structure of 10a contained highly disordered methanol, where 0.8 of a methanol molecule was located in the difference map, disordered over three positions. Although experiments on the bulk material determined that 10 consisted of one methanol molecule per asymmetric unit, as only 0.8 of a methanol molecule could be located in the difference map, the molecular formula used for 10a reflects this. O2, O3, O4, C31, C32 and C33 were refined isotropically. Hydrogen atoms were not included on any parts of the disordered methanol, but were included in the molecular formula. The distances between C31 and O2, C32 and O3, and C33 and O4 were restrained to be 1.4(1) Å. 10b (10 at 200 K) Due to the higher temperature of collection of 10b, in comparison to 10a, only the half occupancy portion of the disordered methanol molecule could be located in the difference map. Although experiments on the bulk material determined that 4 consisted of one methanol molecule per asymmetric unit, as only 0.5 of a methanol molecule could be located in the difference map, the molecular formula used for 4b reflects this. Residual electron density in the vicinity of the half occupancy methanol molecule is due to disorder of the methanol molecule that could not be accurately modelled. A hydrogen atom was not included for O2. The distance between C31 and O2 was restrained to be 1.4(1) Å. ISOR restraints were applied to C31 and O2. 10c (10 at 250 K) Due to the higher temperature of collection of 10c, in comparison to 10a, only the half occupancy portion of the disordered methanol molecule could be located in the difference map. Although experiments on the bulk material determined that 10 consisted of one methanol molecule per asymmetric unit, as only 0.5 of a methanol molecule could be located in the difference map, the molecular formula used for 10c reflects this. Residual electron density in the vicinity of the half occupancy methanol molecule is due to disorder of the methanol molecule that could not be accurately modelled. A hydrogen atom was not included for O2. The distance between C31 and O2 was restrained to be 1.4(1) Å. ISOR restraints were applied to C31 and O2. 19 Figure S11 (a) The asymmetric unit of 1a, with solvent and hydrogen atoms omitted for clarity, and all non- carbon atoms labelled; and (b) the assymetric unit of 1a including solvent, with hydrogen atoms omitted for clarity.

The samples had lost solvent due to the LIESST preparation technique. The tiny bit of sample that was used for LIESST had lost traces of solvent, and would have changed further prior to doing TGA/PXRD (even assuming there would be sufficient of the exact sample to use). Thus we have described how the samples were handled before they were tested, emphasizing that they are very sensitive to both solvation and sample treatment. The exact nature/degree of the solvation could not be ascertained. Retaining solvation in the pristine, as- crystallised compounds was extremely difficult despite the great care and effort employed. When TGA experiments were made on the fully solvated sample (e.g the water/methanol solvates), lattice solvent(s) were lost very quickly upon exposure to air at room temperature to such an extent that obtaining concordant TGA results was not possible here.  Solvated species: The solvent combination of methanol and chloroform was less volatile than the dichloromethane in which complex 1 needed to be retained, and physically loading the sample into the sample holder, and maintaining uniform solvation throughout the sample was possible only for 2. For 1, non-uniform solvent loss, and consequent partial loss of crystallinity, was found to occur upon several attempts to prepare a glass capillary for VTPXRD experiments. It is felt that 2 and 4, which are very similar in structure and magnetic properties, would show similar temperature-dependent behaviour of the unit cell parameters, and 2 was chosen because of its more appropriate and useable temperature range. Powder data were collected on 1, but it was of low quality, probably because of CH2Cl2 being lost and then freezing and thus a substantial background ‘hump’ was noted. The above comments apply to measurements at the Australian synchrotron. In the case of complex 6, a CH2Cl2 solvate, great care was exercised at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, and PXRD data were successfully obtained. 41 Figure S35.

Thermogram of 7 synthesised via Method 1(blue) and 7 synthesised via Method 2 (red). Samples were prepared for analysis by pipetting the analyte from a blanketing layer of 1:1 dichloromethane:1,2-dichloroethane onto a folded filter paper. After surface solvent was judged to have evaporated, analysis was quickly started. Despite efforts to treat each sample in the same manner during subsequent runs, excellent precision in results was not acheived. This is due to ease of loss of lattice solvent, a phenomenon that is reflected in the microanalytical data for 7. Two representative data series are depicted above, which each show an approximate mass loss of ~18% by 150 oC (loss of one dichloromethane molecule and one 1,2- dichloroethane molecule from the lattice of 7 equates to a mass loss of 18.8%).
