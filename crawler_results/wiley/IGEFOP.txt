Bis(2-pyridylthio)methane [bpytm, (pyS)2CH2] and com- plexes of this ligand with ZnII, HgII, CuI, and AgI have been prepa- red and characterised by elemental analysis, by IR, Raman and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and by X-ray diffractometry. The li- gand is N,N-didentate in the ZnII complexes; N-monodentate in one HgII complex and N,N-bis(monodentate) in the other; N- mono-N,S-didentate in the CuI complex; and N,S-bis(mono)- Komplexchemie des vielseitigen Liganden Bis(2-pyridylthio)methan Inhaltsübersicht.

Of the many classes of ligand that have been used to synthesize supramolecular networks of structural and/or practical in- terest, S,N-donor ligands are particularly attractive because they can be used as constituents of protein models [3]. A number of authors [311] have synthesized S,N-li- gands of type B-Z-S-Y-S-Z-B, where B is a nitrogenated aromatic ring system such as pyridine [310] or benzimida- zole [11] (normally, though not always, with the N atom α to the carbon bearing the B-Z bond) and the spacers Y and * Dr. E.

The spacers Z facilitate coordina- tion by both S and the neighbouring N atom, and hence the formation of stable chelate rings of five or more atoms [1216]. The formation of -M-S-C-N- rings is more diffi- cult, and when it does occur, as in complexes of deproto- nated pyridine-2-thiol (pyS) with HgII, TlIII, and SnIV [17,18], the strengths of the M-N and M-S bonds vary in- versely to each other as the metal M changes. Bearing in mind the above, the rotational possibilities of the M-S-C-N fragment [19] and the flexibility of the S- CH2-S fragment [20], we hoped that the ligand bis(2-pyri- dylthio)methane (bpytm, Scheme 1) would have a rich coor- dination chemistry. In the work described herein we did indeed find that its complexes with ZnII, HgII CuI, and AgI (Scheme 1) exhibit a variety of different coordination mo- des (Scheme 2). The structural parameters of these comple- xes were compared with those of free bpytm and the triio- dide salt of monoprotonated bpytm. Results and Discussion Synthesis and crystal structures of free and protonated ligand (1) and (2) The ligand bpytm was prepared by adding dichloromethane diluted in absolute ethanol to a basic ethanolic solution of E.

It is readily soluble in chlorinated solvents, acetone, ethyl acetate, dimethylsulfoxide and ace- tonitrile, but is less soluble in methanol and ethanol and insoluble in water. The molecular structure of bpytm is shown in Figure 1; the bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 1. The mole- cule consists of two pyS- units bridged by a methylene group. The pyS- units are chemically equivalent but are not related by a symmetry operation; equivalent bond lengths and angles in the two units are very similar, and their means are similar to values found in related compounds [2123]. Both C(CH2)-S and C(py)-S are closer to the average value for a single C-S bond (1.82 A˚ ) than to that of double CS Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2002, 628, 939950 940 bonds (1.62 A˚ ), although the lengths of the S-py bonds C(2)-S(1) and C(12)-S(11), 1.766(3) and 1.767(3) A˚ , respec- tively, are suggestive [22, 23] of a slightly greater bond order than those of the S-methylene bonds C(1)-S(1) and C(1)- S(11) [respectively 1.796(3) and 1.797(3) A˚ ]. The two pyridyl rings are essentially planar, with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.004 A˚ from the least-squares planes; the dihe- dral angle between them is 67.67(0.09)°; and they adopt a transoid configuration that minimizes unfavourable elec- tronic interactions between the lone pairs of S(1), N(1), S(11) and N(11) and allows the formation of weak intramo- lecular C-H···N hydrogen bonds [24,25] [C(1)- H(1B)···N(1)  0.97, 2.51, 2.835(4) A˚ , 99.5°; C(1)- H(1A)···N(11)  0.97, 2.49, 2.833(4) A˚ , 100.3°]. The orien- tation of the two py rings places the two N atoms 5.239(4) A˚ apart. The S-S distance is 3.048(1) A˚ . The mole- cules of bpytm are packed in the crystal with the closest rings of nearest neighbours in the b direction only 4.293 A˚ apart, which is close enough for a very weak π-π interaction [26, 27]. The IR and Raman spectra show pyridine ring bands that proved useful as markers of the N-coordination of the complexes (vide infra) [28, 29]. The 1H and 13C NMR spec- tra in dmso-d6 were interpreted by means of 1H-13C HMQC and HMBC experiments and compared with those of pyri- dine-2-thione in dmso-d6 [18]. The change to the thiol-like pyridine of bpytm was accompanied by upfield shifts of the C(2) and C(3) signals (by 20.7 and 10.7 ppm, respectively) and downfield shifts of the C(5) and C(6) signals (by 7.5 and 11.9 ppm, respectively); only the C(4) signal remained virtually unchanged, shifting downfield by just 0.4 ppm. In the 1H spectrum, all the ring proton signals are shifted downfield from their positions in the spectrum of the thione, in which they appear at 6.72 (m, H-5), 7.26 (dd, H- 3), 7.39 (td, H-4) and 7.62 (dd, H-6) ppm. The triiodide salt of protonated bpytm was obtained when we tried to synthesize [SnI4(bpytm)] by reaction of bpytm with tin(IV) iodide, the true identity of the needles obtained being shown by the results of X-ray studies (Fig. 2). The formation of (Hbpytm)I3 is tentatively attributed to the tin(IV) iodide undergoing hydrolytic and redox proces- ses. Protonation of bpytm leads to certain changes in bond lengths and angles as a consequence of electronic redistri- bution (Table 1). In the py ring the N-C bonds [N(1)-C(2), N(1)-C(6), N(11)-C(12) and N(11)-C(16)] are lengthened, as are C(2)-C(3) and C(12)-C(13), while C(4)-C(5) and C(14)- C(15) are shortened; and the angles C(2)-N(1)-C(6) and C(12)-N(11)-C(16) are widened about 3°, while N(1)-C(2)- C(3) and N(11)-C(12)-C(13) are narrowed to the same ex- tent. In the bridging unit C(2)-S(1)-C(1)-S(11)-C(12) all the bonds are slightly shortened except S(11)-C(1), which is si- gnificantly lengthened; however, the major changes concern the angles, because the configuration adopted by the proto- nated ligand is very different from that of bpytm. In parti- cular, the torsion angles C(2)-S(1)-C(1)-S(11) and C(12)- S(11)-C(1)-S(1), which are practically equal in bpytm 15213749, 2002, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3749(200206)628:5<939::AID-ZAAC939>3.0.CO;2-0 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

These rotations, and the widening of C(2)- S(1)-C(1), N(1)-C(2)-S(1), C(12)-S(11)-C(1) and N(11)- C(12)-S(11), make the angle between the two py rings 36.57(0.19)° and place the nitrogen atoms in positions allo- wing the formation of a strong N(11)-H···N(1) hydrogen bond [N(11)-H(11)···N(1)  1.31(7), 1.39(7), 2.693(6) A˚ and 171(6)°]. Thus the two N atoms are now only 2.693(6) A˚ apart, as against 5.239(4) A˚ in the free ligand.

The IR spectrum of (Hbpytm)I3 shows bands due to the stretching and bending modes of the N-H group, and in both the IR and Raman spectra the pyridine bands are shifted from their positions in the spectra of the free ligand. The main changes affect the 987 and 620 cm1 py ring vi- brations, which like most other bands shift to higher wave- numbers; only the ring stretching band at 1465 cm1 and the γ(C-H) vibration at 740 cm1 undergo shifts to lower wavenumbers. The slightly asymmetric triiodide ion gives rise to a very strong νsym(I-I) Raman band at 116 cm1, close to the 114 cm1 at which it appears in the spectrum of 2-(diphenylphosphinhydroxo)phenyl-2-(diphenylpho- sphinoxo)phenyl-phenylphosphinoxide triiodide [31], in which the structural parameters of the I3 ion are also close to those found in this case [d(I-I)  2.969(3), 2.871(2) A˚ ]. The 13C{1H} NMR spectrum of (Hbpytm)I3 in dmso- d6 shows six signals. With respect to their positions in the spectrum of bpytm, four have shifted downfield, to 30.7 [C(1)], 120.9 [C(5)], 122.9 [C(3)] and 138.1 [C(4)] ppm, and the other two have shifted upfield to 149.0 [C(6)] and 156.5 [C(2)], suggesting the persistence of the N-H···N interaction Figure 3 ZORTEP plot of [ZnCl2(bpytm)]•H2O, 3, showing the in- termolecular hydrogen bonds.

The bpytm moieties of 3 and 4 are nevertheless essentially similar, acting as N,N-bidentate chelating ligands. Each py- ridine ring is planar, with no atom deviating more than 0.01 A˚ from the six-atom least-squares plane. The pyridine bond length most affected by coordination is N(1)-C(2), which is lengthened (more in the chloro than in the bromo derivative). The angle C(2)-N(1)-C(6) is slightly widened, although less than by N-protonation. The bond lengths in the C(2)-S(1)-C(1)-S(11)-C(12) bridge are similar to those of the free ligand, but the angles C(2)-S(1)-C(1), C(12)- S(11)-C(1), N(1)-C(2)-S(1) and N(11)-C(12)-S(11) are slightly narrowed. The major changes with respect to the free ligand are the rotations allowing N,N chelation: rota- tion about the S-C(1) bonds is reflected by the torsion an- gles C(2)-S(1)-C(1)-S(11) and C(12)-S(11)-C(1)-S(1), and rotation about the S(1)-C(2) and S(11)-C(12) bonds by C(1)-S(1)-C(2)-N(1) and C(1)-S(11)-C(12)-N(11). The latter changes in particular result in each py ring lying practically perpendicular to the C(1)-S-C plane in which its C-S bond lies, whereas it almost coincides with this plane in the free ligand. The two py rings thus make dihedral angles of 63.14(0.07)° in the chloride and 56.53(0.14)° in the bromide, with the two N atoms 3.643(3) A˚ apart in the former and 3.596(5) A˚ in the latter. In both complexes the Zn atom is tetracoordinated to the two nitrogen atoms of the bpytm ligand and the two X atoms, which define a distorted tetrahedral environment with M-N bond lengths of 2.0504(19) A˚ in [ZnCl2(bpytm)]·H2O and 2.040(3) and 2.053(3) A˚ in [ZnBr2(bpytm)]. These distances are similar to those found [4245] in other complexes of ZnCl2 and ZnBr2 with N,N- donor ligands, in which the Zn-X bonds are nevertheless in general slightly shorter than in the new complexes. The N-M-N bite angles, 125.23(11)° in [ZnCl2(bpytm)]·H2O and 122.91(14)° in [ZnBr2(bpytm)], are considerably wider than the ideal tetrahedral angle, 109°28, presumably as a consequence of the steric require- ments of the eight-membered chelate ring, which adopts a distorted irregular boat-chair conformation. Both these an- gles are significantly wider than the 111.3(1)° found in [ZnCl2(sbi)] [36] [sbi  1,3-bis(5-methyl-4-imidazolyl)-2- thiapropane] or the 107.76(9)° found in [ZnCl2(L)]·CH3OH [11] [L  1-(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolyl)-3-benzimidazolyl- 2-thiapropane], in both of which the ligand is N,N-diden- tate and there is an eight-membered ZnN2C2C2S ring. The thioether S atoms of the central bridge of the ligand lie 3.2176(7) A˚ from the metal in 3 and 3.2739(13) and 3.3339(12) A˚ away in 4, which rules out significant S-M in- teraction, the sum of the van der Waals radii being 3.20 A˚ [37]. The molecule of water present in 3 is bound to Cl and C atoms by hydrogen bonds [O-H(1w)···Cl(1)  0.972(2), 2.64, 3.321(3) A˚ , 127.59(15)°; C(4)-H(4)···O#2  0.93, 2.52, 3.350(3) A˚ , 148.4° (#2  x0.5, y0.5, z1)], so lin- king the [ZnCl2(bpytm)] units in chains. Weak hydrogen bonds are also present in 4 [C(1)-H(1B)···Br(1)#1  0.97, Z. Anorg. Allg.

The main changes in the IR and Raman spectra of the bpytm ligand upon coordination are qualitatively the same as those caused by N-protonation and discussed above (see the experimental part). The two ν(Zn-X) bands expected in view of the local C2v symmetry of the ZnN2X2 kernel are found close to the positions they have in the spectra of simi- lar complexes [33]. However, it was only possible to identify one ν(Zn-N) band, and that only tentatively. The 13C{1H} NMR spectra of both compounds in dmso- d6 show six signals lying very close to their positions in the spectrum of the free ligand, which indicates the dissociation of these adducts in dmso solution. In the 1H NMR spectra the positions of the signals are practically identical to those found in that of the free ligand. In particular, the pyridyl C(6)H and C(16)H signals do not show the downfield shift that is normally observed in the spectra of complexes con- taining co-ordinated pyridyl groups [38,39], which confirms the dissociation of the complexes in dmso. Complexes with monodentate or bis-monodentate bpytm, (6) and (5) Refluxing the white suspensions formed by mixing HgCl2 and bpytm in 1:1 or 2:1 mole ratio always led to [Hg2Cl4(bpytm)] (5). When HgBr2 was used instead of HgCl2, [HgBr2(bpytm)] (6) was formed. However, when HgBr2 was reacted with bpytm in 2:1 mole ratio without reflux, [Hg2Br4(bpytm)] (7) was obtained, although the pre- sence of both 7 and 6 in the reaction vessel was suggested by the mother liquor affording crystals of the latter, which were identified by comparison of their Raman spectrum with that of the polycrystalline 6 obtained using reflux in the synthesis. In 5, bpytm is bis-monodentate, each of its N atoms bin- ding one Hg atom (Fig. 5). As in the ZnII chelates discussed above, coordination hardly affects the bond lengths and an- gles in the py rings: the only changes of any significance 15213749, 2002, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3749(200206)628:5<939::AID-ZAAC939>3.0.CO;2-0 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

For [HgBr2(bpytm)]: #1  x, y1.5, z0.5; #2  x, y1.5, z0.5 concern N(1)-C(2), which is slightly longer than in the free ligand; C(2)-N(1)-C(6), which is about 1.5° wider; and N(1)-C(2)-C(3), which is about 2.5° narrower. Both rings are essentially planar, the maximum deviation from the le- ast-squares planes being 0.0069 A˚ . The greatest change as- sociated with coordination is that the dihedral angle bet- ween the planes of the py rings becomes only 7.8(3)°, lar- gely as the result of rotation about the S-Cpy bonds, which widens the C(1)-S-C-N torsion angle from about 1° to 126.0(7)°; together with slight rotations about the C(1)-S bonds and the narrowing of S-C(1)-S by about 2°, these changes in the geometry of the C-S-C-S-C bridge place the two N atoms 5.263(14) A˚ apart. Each Hg atom is coordinated to one N-atom, one termi- nal Cl atom, and two Cl atoms bridging to one of the Hg atoms of a neighbouring molecule (Fig. 5). The bridging Hg-Cl bonds have lengths of 2.599(2) A˚ [Hg-Cl(2)] and 2.737(2) A˚ [Hg-Cl(2)#1], and the terminal Hg-Cl(1) bond a length of 2.355(2) A˚ . These values are similar to those found in the CCDC [40] for tetrahedrally coordinated Hg species with bridging or terminal chloride ligands. The Hg- N(1) distance, 2.202(6) A˚ , is similar to those reported for [HgX2(py)2] (X  Cl, Br and I) [41] and [Hg2Cl2(Mecyt)2] (Mecyt  1-methylcytosine) [42]. Besides these strong bonds, there are also two weak intramolecular interactions: one with the nearest sulfur atom [Hg···S(1)  3.299(2) A˚ ; sum of the van der Waals radii 3.80 A˚ ] [37, 43] and the other with the terminal chlorine on the other Hg atom [Hg···Cl(1)#2  3.131(3) A˚ ; sum of the van der Waals radii 3.703.90 A˚ ] [37,43]. Cl(1) thus forms a very asymmetric intramolecular bridge. If one takes into account all these interactions (which are also present in other HgII comple- xes) [44], the Hg atom has a very distorted 2  2  2 octa- hedral environment. Z. Anorg. Allg.

The primary supramolecular structure of 5 consists of chains along the c axis in which Hg atoms are alternately bridged by bpytm ligands [Hg···Hg#2  3.6360(8) A˚ ] and Cl atoms [Hg···Hg#1  3.7041(8) A˚ ] (Fig. 5). In these chains the slightly zig-zag succession of Hg atoms is cupped by two columns of bpytm molecules, alternate bpytms belonging to opposite columns (Fig. 6 shows a view along the c direc- tion). The distance between the nearest py planes of adja- cent bpytms is approximately 3.7 A˚ . The Hg2Cl2 rings lin- king the bpytms are strictly planar, with a dihedral angle of 76.49(0.06)° between successive rings. These chains are held 15213749, 2002, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3749(200206)628:5<939::AID-ZAAC939>3.0.CO;2-0 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

In 6 the ligand is N-monodentate (Fig. 7). The py ring bound to the mercury atom is coplanar with the S(1)-C(1)- S(11) fragment (rms  0.0367), and the other py ring is practically perpendicular to this plane, the dihedral angle between the two rings being 86.0(5)°. This arrangement is probably favoured by the weak intramolecular hydrogen bond between the -CH2- group and N(11) [C(1)- H(1B)···N(11)  0.97, 2.44, 2.85(2) A˚ , 105.2°], which is si- milar to those found in the free ligand. The main differences between the coordinated and non-coordinated py rings af- fect the N-C bonds, which are both slightly longer in the coordinated ring, and the C-N-C angle, which is wider. The mercury atom is coordinated to N(1) and to three bromine atoms in an environment which, weak interactions apart, is similar to that of the metal atoms of 5, in spite of the differences in stoichiometry and coordination mode. The Hg-N(1) and Hg-Br bond lengths are quite normal [3537] (the former in particular is similar to that found in 5). The Br(2) atom forms a slightly asymmetric bridge bet- ween two mercury atoms, so creating -Hg-Br-Hg-Br- chains [Hg-Hg  4.3179(9) A˚ ] that run along the c axis and from which the bpytm molecules branch out perpendicularly. An additional weak intramolecular Hg···S bond [Hg- S(1)  3.193(4) A˚ ] is shorter than its counterpart in the chlorine derivative. If this interaction is taken into conside- ration, the coordination polyhedron around Hg is a di- storted trigonal bipyramid with a vacant equatorial posi- tion. In [HgBr2(pySSpy)] [34], in which the ligand 2,2-dipyri- dyldisulfide differs from bpytm only in the absence of the methylene bridge between the S atoms, polymeric chains are formed by Hg atoms bridged between by N,N-bis(mono- dentate) pySSpy ligands, not by Br atoms as in 6. This diffe- rence, and the great difference between the relative orienta- tions of the two py rings of each molecule in [HgBr2(pyS- Spy)] and 6, illustrate the extent to which the introduction of the methylene bridge modifies the coordination beha- viour of the ligand. The vibrational spectra of 5, 6 and 7 show the typical indications of N-coordination found in the other comple- xes. The non-coordination of one py ring in 6 is most evi- dent in the Raman spectrum (see experimental part), which shows bands close to their positions in the spectrum of the free ligand. The HgCl2 compound has its ν(Hg-Cl(1)) vibra- tion at wavenumbers that are close to those found for other compounds in which terminal and bridging Hg-Cl bonds coexist [48,49] and are in keeping with the length of the Hg- Cl(1) bond [50]. The 1H spectra of 5, 6 and 7 in dmso-d6 at room tempera- ture, like those of 3 and 4, shows no significant shifts with respect to the ligand spectrum. Similarly, the 13C{1H} spec- tra all show six resonances close to their positions in that of the free ligand. These findings show that, like 3 and 4, compounds 5, 6 and 7 dissociate in dmso solution.

N-mono-N,S-didentate bridging bpytm: compound 8 Reaction of bpytm with CuBr2 initially gave an orange so- lid, the characterization of which, together with a detailed study of the reaction, is still in progress. The monocrystal obtained from the mother liquor proved to be [Cu4Br4(b- pytm)2] (8), in which the bpytm ligand chelates one copper atom [Cu(1)] via S(1) and N(11) and also coordinates to another [Cu(2)] via N(1), thus bridging between the two (Fig. 8). The main geometrical changes in the free ligand that faci- litate the above coordination scheme are rotations of about 50° and 150° around S(11)-C(12) and S(1)-C(2), respec- tively. The rotations around S(1)-C(1) and S(11)-C(1) are much smaller, about 20° and 10° respectively. The angle N(1)-C(2)-S(1) narrows by about 5°, but other parameters of the C-S-C-S-C bridge are unaffected. In the pyridine rings, N-coordination lengthens N(1)-C(2) and (less mar- kedly) N(11)-C(12), but the C-N-C angles are practically unchanged. In the complexed ligand, the two S atoms lie 3.065 A˚ apart (cf. 3.048 A˚ in the free ligand), and the two N atoms are 5.186(6) A˚ apart (cf. 5.239(4) A˚ in the free li- gand). The Cu atoms of 8 are clustered in Cu4Br4 structures, each of which essentially consists of a crooked, centrosym- metric ladder of three CuBrCuBr diamonds, each diamond sharing one edge with the next. The two bromine atoms in the central diamond thus bridge among three copper atoms, and the other two between two. This kind of core is similar to those found in other halide complexes of CuI [51,52]. In 8, only the central diamond is flat, and the bridge formed by each of the µ-Br atoms is slightly asymmetric [Cu(1)- 15213749, 2002, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3749(200206)628:5<939::AID-ZAAC939>3.0.CO;2-0 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

Since each bpytm ligand bridges between the two Cu atoms on one side of one Cu4Br4 structure, the copper atoms are therefore tetra- coordinated, Cu(1) by S(1), N(11), Br(1) and Br(2), and Cu(2) by N(1), Br(1), Br(1)#1 and Br(2)#1; both metal atoms have a distorted tetrahedral coordination environ- ment, with central angles ranging from 100.43(13)° to 117.62(5)° for Cu(1) and from 103.11(4)° to 118.29(13)° for Cu(2).

This structure requires the geometry of the free ligand to undergo slight changes in the N(1)-C, N(11)- C and all the C-S distances; a narrowing of N(11)-C(12)- S(11); a widening of the C-N-C, C(12)-S(11)-C(1) and S(1)- C(1)-S(11) angles (this is the only complex in which this angle is widened, possibly because it is the only one in which both sulphur atoms are coordinated); and substantial changes in torsion angles (Table 2). The planes of the high- numbered rings of the two bpytm ligands are almost paral- lel, and corresponding atoms are separated by distances of 4.415-4.521 A˚ . Both the bpytm ligands chelate the same Ag atom, Ag(1), through their N(1) and S(11) atoms. Neither the Ag-S [53, 54] nor the Ag-N [55, 56] distances are remarkable, and the angles at the centre of this distorted tetrahedron range from 99.73(9)° to 135.43(5)°. Although the other two silver atoms lie only 3.1128(4) A˚ away, which is less than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.40 A˚ ) [37], it is not clear whether this indicates an Ag-Ag bond [5659] or simply close packing due to the conformation of the bpytm bridges [the two S(1) atoms, 3.4315(9) A˚ away, are also closer than the sum of the van der Waals radii, 3.50 A˚ ] [37]. The other two silver atoms, Ag(2) and Ag(2)#1 (#1  x0.5, y0.5, z), are both coordinated to the S(1) atom of one bpytm and the N(11) atom of the other (neither the Ag-S nor the Ag-N distances are remarkable), and also to 15213749, 2002, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3749(200206)628:5<939::AID-ZAAC939>3.0.CO;2-0 by Central South University, Wiley Online Library on [07/03/2025].

As noted above, it is not clear whether Ag(1) is coordinated to the Ag(2) atoms; and the Ag(2)- O(33) distance, 3.182(4) A˚ , rules out any strong interaction between these atoms, the sum of their van der Waals radii being 3.20 A˚ [37]. The possibility of slight Ag(2)-O(33) interaction apart, each of the two coordinated nitrato ligands thus coordina- tes to one Ag3(bpytm)23 structure through two oxygens and to a neighbouring Ag3(bpytm)3 2 through the third. One of these nitratos is also involved in an intramolecular C-H···O hydrogen bond [C(16)-H(16)···O(31)#1  0.93, 2.42, 3.180(6) A˚ , 139.2°]. The third NO3 group, which ex- hibits orientational disorder with all its oxygen atoms ha- ving occupation factors of 0.5 for each position, is not coor- dinated, but linked to bpytm ligands through three C-H···O hydrogen bonds involving two of its oxygen atoms: C(1)- H(1B)···O(41)  0.97, 2.36, 3.242(10) A˚ , 151.4°; C(15)- H(15)···O(41)#3  0.93, 2.56, 3.436(9) A˚ , 157.2° (#3  x, y0.5, z0.5; and C(3)-H(3)···O(43)#4  0.93, 2.58, 3.142(11) ¯ , 119.1( (#4  x0.5, y0.5, z1). The vibrational spectra of 9 show evidence of N-coordi- nation, but we were unable to identify, among the vibra- tions of the bpytm ligand, specific markers of the coordina- tion mode observed in this compound. The bands due to the coordinated nitrato ligands are masked by bpytm bands, but the uncoordinated nitrate ion shows up in the IR spec- trum as the very broad, strong band around 1380 cm1 that is typical of ionic nitrate. Unlike those of the other complexes, the 1H and 13C{1H} spectra of 9 suggest that this complex does not dissociate in dmso-d6. All the 13C{1H} signals except that of C(2) (at 156.9 ppm) lie downfield of their positions in the spectrum of the free ligand [C(1) at 31.8, C(5) at 121.1, C(3) at 123.0, Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2002, 628, 939950 947 C(4) at 137.8, C(6) at 150.2 ppm]; and the 1H signals are also all shifted downfield except that of H(6). Experimental Materials and measurements 2-mercaptopyridine (99 % pure), zinc(II) chloride (98 %), mercu- ry(II) chloride (99.5 %), mercury(II) bromide (98 %) and silver(I) nitrate (99 %) from Aldrich; zinc(II) bromide (98 %) from Riedel de Hae¨n; copper(II) bromide (99 %) from Fluka; acetone, dichloro- methane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, ethyl acetate, absolute ethanol and tetrahydrofuran, from Panreac; and sodium hydroxide (98 %) and acetonitrile from Scharlau; were all used as supplied. Tin(IV) iodide was prepared as previously described in the litera- ture [61]. Analytical data were obtained with a Fisons Instruments EA-1108 CHN-O apparatus. Melting points were determined with a Gallen- kamp MBF-595 apparatus. Mass spectra were recorded on an Au- tospec-Micromass apparatus under FAB conditions using 3-nitro- benzyl alcohol as matrix. The IR spectra of samples in KBr pellets (4000400 cm1) or Nujol mulls between polyethylene sheets (500100 cm1), and the Raman spectra of polycrystalline sam- ples, were recorded on a Bruker model IFS-66V apparatus with an FRA 106 Raman accessory and a Ramascope microscope. The 1H (300.13 MHz) and 13C (75.47 MHz) NMR spectra of 0.1 M solu- tions in dmso-d6 were recorded on a Bruker AMX 300 spectrome- ter; chemical shifts are reported relative to TMS. Synthesis Bis(2-pyridylthio)methane (bpytm, 1). 2-Mercaptopyridine (4.250 g, 38.2 mmol) was added to a solution of NaOH (2.000 g, 50 mmol) in 40 mL of absolute ethanol. After 1 days stirring, 10 mL of CH2Cl2 diluted with 10 mL of absolute ethanol was added drop- wise to the sodium salt so obtained, and this mixture was stirred for 3 days and then refluxed for 6 hours. The suspension was filte- red while hot and the filtrate was concentrated, affording yellow needles that were recrystallized in ethanol.

[Cu4Br4(bpytm)2] (8). A solution of CuBr2 (0.200 g, 0.896 mmol) in 10 mL of ethanol was added dropwise to a solution of bpytm (0.420 g, 1.79 mmol) in 15 mL of the same solvent. The suspension so obtained was refluxed for 24 hours. After stirring for 3 days, the orange solid formed was filtered out and dried in vacuo. A crystal suitable for X-ray diffraction was grown from the mother liquor. [Ag3(bpytm)2(NO3)2]NO3 (9). A solution of bpytm (0.200 g, 0.85 mmol) in 1:1.5 acetone/ethanol (8 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of AgNO3 (0.145 g, 0.85 mmol) in 25 mL of water. After stirring for 1 week, and then refluxing for 1 h (protected from light), white needles suitable for X-ray diffraction were filtered out of the reaction mixture. Yield 50 %. mp 150 °C (dec.).

X-ray crystallography The X-ray diffraction patterns of 25 and 79 were recorded at 293(2) K on a Bruker CCD Smart apparatus using graphite-mono- chromated Mo-K radiation (λ  0.71073 A˚ ) [62], and those of 1 on an Enraf Nonius CAD4 MACH3 apparatus using Cu-K radi- ation (λ  1.54184 A˚ ) [63]. The Smart data were corrected with SADABS [64] and the MACH3 data with φ-scan [65]. Table 6 lists crystal data, experimental details, refinement results and details of structure determination. The crystal structures of 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8 were solved by direct methods, and those of 2, 7 and 9 by the Patterson method [66].The positions of all the non-hydrogen atoms were found and were refined on F2 by a full-matrix least-squares procedure using anisotropic displacement parameters [66]. Hydro- gen atoms were assigned calculated positions that were refined using a riding model except that in 2 H111 was located and refined isotropically, and the hydrogen atoms of the water molecule in 3 were located and included in the model with a fixed isotropic tem- perature factor but were not refined. Atomic scattering factors were taken from the International Tables for X-ray Crystallography [67], and graphics were produced using the programs ORTEPIII [68a] and ZORTEP [68b]. PLATON [69] was used to search for potential hydrogen bonds using, as the criterion for D-H···A interactions, d(D···A)  R(D)  R(A)  0.50 A˚ , d(H···A)  R(H)  R(A)- 0.12 A˚ and D-H···A  100°, where R(D), R(H) and R(A) are the corresponding van der Waals radii (obtained from Bondi [70] or calculated as the covalent radius  0.80 A˚ ). Crystallographic data for the structures have been deposited with Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, CCDC 169762  169769. Copies of the data can be obtained free of charge on appli- cation to The Director, CCDC, 12 Union Roas, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK (Fax: int.code(1223)336-033; e-mail for inquiry: file- serv@ccdc.cam.ac.uk; e-mail for deposition: deposit@ccdc.cam.a- c.uk).
