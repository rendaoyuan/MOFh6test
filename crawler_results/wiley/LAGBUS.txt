J. 2010, 16, 12328 – 12341 12328 DOI: 10.1002/chem.201001256 Introduction Open metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)[1,2] are considered as promising materials for many potential applications, such as gas storage, molecular sensing, separation, ion exchange, catalysis, optics, magnetism and others,[2] and great attention is currently focused on their design. A useful approach to the rational synthesis of such network species involves the use of molecular building blocks, usually metal-containing species called metalloligands,[3–6] that have suitably oriented peripheral exo donor groups and are therefore able to direct the formation of the polymeric array. The metalloligands are used in place of organic ligands to join different metal centres, thus possibly affording heterobimetallic architec- tures (including many 3d–4f systems)[4] with additional prop- erties. In contrast to the secondary building units (SBUs) that can be envisaged as fundamental constituent units of the networks assembled by the reticular chemistry ap- proach,[1b,c,7] the metalloligands are distinct entities in their own right. This stepwise approach implies the initial careful selection of the polyfunctional ligands to be employed in the preparation of the discrete metal–organic building blocks with the desired geometry. Chelating ligands are the most frequently used, which generate bis- or tris-chelated com- plexes and contain additional outward directed donor groups (typically carboxylate, nitrile or pyridyl). For in- stance, tris(dipyrrinato) metal complexes[5] have been shown to be a versatile class of metalloligands for the preparation of a variety of interesting MOF structures. A few functional- ised b-diketonate ligands have also been employed as suita- ble chelating agents for the preparation of metalloligands; the known examples include tris-chelated complexes with 3- substituted acetylacetonates (having pyridyl or CN substitu- ent groups)[6a,b] and the bis-chelated species [CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(pyac)2] (pyac=3-(4-pyridyl)pentane-2,4-dionato).[6c,d] We report here an approach for the modular engineering of heterometallic MOFs based on the use of a functionalised b-diketone, namely 1,3-bis(4’-cyanophenyl)-1,3-propane- dione (HL). The corresponding b-diketonate ligand (L; Scheme 1), besides acting as a chelating agent towards a metal centre, can coordinate other metals through the two CN groups, and can potentially also interact with metals through its cen- tral carbon atom. We have employed this ligand to prepare novel neutral tris-chelate complexes of metal trications [ML3] (M=CoIII, FeIII) and anionic tris-chelate complexes of metal dications [ML3] (M=MnII, CoII, ZnII, CdII). These discrete metal–organic building blocks have been used in the construction of heterometallic MOFs by reaction with a Abstract: The modular engineering of heterometallic nanoporous metal–or- ganic frameworks (MOFs) based on novel tris-chelate metalloligands, pre- pared using the functionalised b-dike- tone 1,3-bis(4’-cyanophenyl)-1,3-pro- panedione (HL), is described. The complexes [MIIIL3] (M=Fe3+, Co3+) and [MIIL3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NEt4) (M=Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Cd2+) have been synthesised and characterised, all of which exhibit a dis- torted octahedral chiral structure. The presence of six exo-oriented cyano donor groups on each complex makes it a suitable building block for net- working through interactions with ex- ternal metal ions. We have prepared two families of MOFs by reacting the metalloligands [MIIIL3] and [MIIL3] with many silver salts AgX (X=NO3 , BF4 , PF6 , AsF6 , SbF6 , CF3SO3 , to- sylate), specifically the [MIIIL3Ag3]- ACHTUNGTRENUNGX3·Solv and [MIIL3Ag3]X2·Solv network species. Very interestingly, all of these network species exhibit the same type of 3D structure and crystallise in the same trigonal space group with similar cell parameters, in spite of the different metal ions, ionic charges and X coun- teranions of the silver salts. We have also succeeded in synthesising trimetal- lic species such as [ZnxFeyL3Ag3]- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ClO4)(2x+3y)·Solv and [ZnxCdyL3Ag3]- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ClO4)2·Solv (with x+y=1). All of the frameworks can be described as sixfold interpenetrated pcu nets, considering the Ag+ ions as simple digonal spacers. Each individual net is homochiral, con- taining only D or L nodes; the whole array contains three nets of type D and three nets of type L. Otherwise, taking into account the presence of weak Ag C s bonds involving the central carbon atoms of the b-diketonate ligands of adjacent nets, the six interpenetrating pcu networks are joined into a unique non-interpenetrated six-connected frame with the rare acs topology. The networks contain large parallel chan- nels of approximate hexagonal-shaped sections that represent 37–48% of the cell volume and include the anions and many guest solvent molecules. The guest solvent molecules can be reversi- bly removed by thermal activation with retention of the framework structure, which proved to be stable up to about 2708C, as confirmed by TGA and powder XRD monitoring. The anions could be easily exchanged in single- crystal to single-crystal processes, thereby allowing the insertion of select- ed anions into the framework channels.

We have thereby obtained nu- merous representatives of a family of three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous networks in crystalline form with the com- positions [MIIIL3Ag3]X3·Solv and [MIIL3Ag3]X2·Solv, and these have been structurally characterised. Surprisingly, all of these networks exhibit a very similar structure, thus indi- cating a great efficiency of the metalloligands together with the Ag+ spacers in orienting the relevant polymeric archi- tecture. The results of our investigations on the network po- rosity and on the anion-exchange ability of these materials, which contain large 1D parallel channels that allow the in- sertion of interesting anionic species, are also reported. Results and Discussion Stepwise modular synthesis: We started with the aim of syn- thesising a new tris-chelate metalloACHTUNGTRENUNGliACHTUNGTRENUNGgand, containing six exo-oriented donor groups, as a building block for hetero- metallic networks. For this purpose, we selected as ligand a symmetrically disubstituted b-diketonate anion, considering the successful use of such species in the preparation of met- alloligands.[6] We synthesised the 1,3-bis(4’-cyanophenyl)-1,3- propanedione (HL) molecule, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not hitherto been employed in the context of metal coordination polymers (but has been used in the preparation of some palladium complexes with liquid-crystal properties).[8] It was prepared according to a literature method,[9] using a base-catalyzed condensation between 4- acetylbenzonitrile and methyl 4-cyanobenzoate. Single crys- tals of HL were obtained and investigated by X-ray diffrac- tion. The crystal structure is comprised of flat molecules in the enol form, with intramolecular H-bonding (see Figure S1 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The corresponding b-diketonate ligand (L) can serve both as a chelating agent towards a metal centre and as a donor towards other external metals through the two exo-di- rected cyano groups; moreover, at the same time, it can also potentially interact outwards with other metal atoms through the central carbon atom of the b-diketonate, as al- ready observed in many dinuclear and oligonuclear complex species.[10] The L anion was subsequently reacted with metal ions to afford the tris-chelate metalloligands. The metalloligands: Deprotonation of HL with NEt4OH in ethanol or water afforded solutions of the salt (NEt4)L, which could then be reacted with metal ions M3+ or M2+. Bulk polycrystalline products were obtained for the tris-che- late complexes of both trications [MIIIL3] (M=Fe3+ (1a), Co3+ (1b)) and dications [MIIL3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NEt4) (M=Mn2+ (2a), Co2+ (2b), Zn2+ (2c), Cd2+ (2d)). The metalloligands were characterised by IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy, powder XRD, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and selected mag- netic measurements. Attempts to obtain the Fe2+ species failed, most probably due to partial oxidation of the metal ions under the reaction conditions. To fully characterise these species, we attempted to grow single crystals from the crude materials using slow-diffusion methods. For the neutral species [MIIIL3], this was a difficult task since crystallisation is highly dependent on the solvent system, producing only polycrystalline samples that exhibit a variety of powder XRD patterns. In the case of [FeL3], how- ever, a crystalline product was obtained in methanol that corresponded to the dinuclear FeIII species [FeL2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m-OMe)]2 (as evidenced by single-crystal X-ray analysis; see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). We serendipitously isolated single crystals of the acetone-solvated species [CoL3] (1b), the crystal structure of which is reported herein. On the other hand, we have been able to obtain good yields of single crystals of all of the [MIIL3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NEt4) metalloligands (2a–d), which exhibit very similar triclinic unit cells (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information) in spite of the pres- ence of different guest solvent molecules. The crystal structure of 1b·3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(acetone) is built-up by the packing of discrete neutral [CoL3] molecules, as illustrated in Figure 1 (top). It can be compared with the structure of the THF-solvated metalloACHTUNGTRENUNGliACHTUNGTRENUNGgand 2b, [CoL3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NEt4)·THF, taken as representative of the anionic tris-chelate species (Figure 1, bottom). All of these metalloligands exhibit a distorted octahedral chiral structure (of ideal D3 symmetry; see the selected bond parameters in Table S2 in the Supporting Information) and are packed in centrosymmetric space groups, thus re- sulting in a balance of the D and L enantiomeric forms. On comparing the MO6 coordination geometries, we observe that the MO bond lengths show the expected trends, that is, longer bonds on going from the first to the second transi- tion row (e.g., Zn2+ vs. Cd2+ 2.054(2)–2.118(2)  vs. 2.242(2)–2.278(2) ) and shorter bonds with increased metal charge (e.g., Co2+ vs. Co3+ 2.047(3)–2.088(3)  vs. 1.884(3)– 1.893(3) ). The orientations of the six cyano donor groups in each metalloACHTUNGTRENUNGliACHTUNGTRENUNGgand are approximately those required for a six- connected octahedral node in the networking process (for instance, the M···N distances and N···M···N angles for 1b are in the ranges 9.316(5)–9.374(6)  and 86.04(4)–98.18(4)8 (cisoid angles) and 173.43(4)–173.85(4)8 (transoid angles); on the other hand, for 2b, the corresponding interactions span the intervals 9.424(7)–9.550(5)  and 67.50(6)– 127.21(6)8 (cisoid angles) and 163.94(6)–172.14(5)8 (transoid angles), with much larger deviations from the ideal angular values). We have also prepared and structurally characterised crys- tals of a Cd2+ metalloACHTUNGTRENUNGliACHTUNGTRENUNGgand with a quite different counter- cation, specifically the salt [CdL3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(PPN) (PPN=bis(triphe- Scheme 1. 1,3-Bis(4’-cyanophenyl)-1,3-propanedionato (L). www.chemeurj.org  2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Carlucci et al. nylphosphine)iminium) (2d’) (see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information) to ascertain a possible templating role of the cation in the subsequent step of the self-assembly of the 3D heterometallic network (see below). The heterometallic MOFs: Reactions of the metalloligands, both the MIII- and the MII-containing complexes, with many different AgX salts in appropriate solvents afforded crystal- line products of [MIIIL3Ag3]X3·Solv (3) and [MIIL3Ag3]X2·Solv (4) network species, respectively. Most of these products proved suitable for single-crystal X-ray anal- ysis, though in some cases the crystallographic data were of poor quality due to significant disorder of the guest solvent molecules and of the counteranions X that populate the large network channels (see below). Within the family [MIIIL3Ag3]X3·Solv (3), we have investi- gated crystals of the species 3a (M=Fe3+; X=CF3SO3 ), 3b (M=Fe3+; X=PF6 ), 3c (M=Fe3+; X=BF4 ), 3d (M=Fe3+; X=ClO4 ), 3e (M=Co3+; X=SbF6 ), 3 f (M=Co3+; X=CF3SO3 ) and 3g (M=Co3+; X=BF4 ), but only the structures of 3a and 3b are reported here in full detail. The structure of 3a was selected as being repre- sentative of this family of networks. A more extensive series of members of the family [MIIL3Ag3]X2·Solv (4) was isolated as single crystals, specifi- cally: 4a (M=Mn2+; X=BF4 ), 4b (M=Zn2+; X=BF4 ), 4c (M=Zn2+; X=ClO4 ), 4d (M=Zn2+; X=CF3SO3 ), 4e (M=Zn2+; X=PF6 ), 4 f (M=Zn2+; X=AsF6 ), 4g (M=Zn2+; X=SbF6 ), 4h (M=Zn2+; X=NO3 ), 4i (M= Zn2+; X=tosylate), 4j (M=Cd2+; X=ClO4 ) and 4k (M=Cd2+; X=BF4 ). The structures of 4b, 4c, 4e, 4i, 4j and 4k have been fully refined, while for the remainder we determined only the cell parameters. The structure of 4c was selected as being representative of family 4. Attempts to react the Co2+ metalloACHTUNGTRENUNGliACHTUNGTRENUNGgand (2b) with differ- ent silver salts did not produce crystals of the corresponding network species because of cobalt oxidation accompanied by Ag+ reduction to the metal under the reaction conditions employed, as evidenced by the formation of a silver mirror on the walls of the reaction vessel. All of the crystals of the families 3 and 4 belong to the trigonal system, space group P3¯ (no. 147), with similar unit- cell parameters (see Table 1 and Tables S3 and S5 in the Supporting Information), and their structures contain a very similar complex 3D network, based on the ML3 metallo- ACHTUNGTRENUNGligands as six-connected nodes, since they use all of their six exo-oriented cyano functionalities to bind six Ag+ ions. The nearly octahedral geometry and the bond parameters of the free metalloligands are essentially retained in the nodes of the networks with only some minor changes (see Table S4 in the Supporting Information), with values in ac- cordance with the trends outlined above. The metal ions lie on threefold crystallographic axes and the MO bond lengths are in the ranges 1.980(4)–1.998(4)  for FeIII, 2.037(3)–2.084(3)  for ZnII and 2.225(8)–2.268(4)  for CdII. The silver ions can be considered as digonal spacers that link the metal complexes to generate a 3D network, which exhibits the pcu (point symbol 412.63) topology (as exempli- fied in the case of compound 4c in Figure 2). The “cubic” cages are strongly distorted towards rhombohedral shape because of a stretching along one of the body diagonals, that is, that aligned in the direction of the crystallographic c-axis, which is of length 3c (long body diagonal 49.45  vs. short diagonals 35.03  in 4c). The edges of the cages in families 3 and 4 have lengths in the range 22.46–22.97  and the cage M···M···M acute angles span the interval 68.64–74.088 (see Table 1). Figure 1.

The whole array con- tains a group of three nets of type D and an enantiomeric group of three nets of type L; within each group the three nets are related by pure translation (translational vector [100] and its symmetry equivalents), while the two groups have a centrosymmetric relationship (3D+3L), as shown in Figure 4. This type of interpenetration is classified as be- longing to Class IIIa [Z=6ACHTUNGTRENUNG(3*2)], whereby both translation- al and non-translational symmetry operations correlate the six nets.[11] These networks represent the first example of sixfold in- terpenetration for pcu topology and as such are unprece- dented for this topology. Previous examples of highly inter- penetrating pcu nets have comprised only two cases of four- fold[12] and two cases of fivefold interpenetration.[13] A more rigorous analysis of the differences within the network structures of families 3 and 4 reveals a very inter- esting feature. In all of the networks formed by the anionic metalloligands, [MIIL3Ag3]X2·Solv (4), the silver spacers sig- nificantly interact with the central carbon atoms of the b-di- Table 1.

All of the silver atoms and all of the b-diketonate ligands are involved in these weak AgC s bonds (in the range 2.451(11)–2.531(7) ; see Figure 5 and Table 1). Similar rel- atively weak bonds between Ag and methine C atoms have previously been observed in many b-diketonate oligomeric complexes,[14] which, however, exhibit shorter AgC con- tacts, as short as 2.24  in the anion [Pd2AgACHTUNGTRENUNG(acac)2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(C6F5)4].[14b] On the other hand, in the networks derived from the neutral metalloligands, [MIIIL3Ag3]X3·Solv (3), these Ag···C interactions are either markedly weaker (e.g., 2.827(7)  in 3a) or become non-existent (e.g., a shortest Ag···CACHTUNGTRENUNG(methine) contact of 3.831(7)  in 3b), probably due to the lack of a negative charge on the metal complex. The coordination of the Ag atoms (AgN bonds in the range 2.114(7)–2.217(7) ) generally shows marked devia- tions from linearity (with N-Ag-N angles in the range 140.8(2)–154.3(3)8). The bending is most probably due to the weak Ag···C and/or Ag···anion interactions and this can introduce a certain flexibility of the frameworks. Each chiral node (D or L) interacts with three silver atoms belonging to three adjacent pcu nets of opposite chi- ACHTUNGTRENUNGrality. Taking into account these additional interactions, the six interpenetrating pcu nets are bundled into a unique non- interpenetrated six-connected network with the rare acs top- ology.[11b,15] The [ML3Ag3] moiety can be considered as a novel six-connected SBU (see Figure 5) that generates the whole 3D network (schematically illustrated in Figure 6), which exhibits trigonal prismatic nodes, whereby all of the edges are double-stranded edges (see Figure 7) and the M···M contacts are about half the length of the edges in the pcu networks. The [ML3Ag3] SBU uses all six cyano donor groups and the three Ag atoms (each accepting two external CN) to form the single network. These twelve interactions of the SBU (six as donor and six as acceptor) give rise to the double-edged single acs net. It may also be noted that the chirality of each node of the net is opposite to that of the six nodes connected to it. Within the double edges (illustrated in Figure 7), weak p- p interactions are observed involving the phenyl rings of dif- ferent diketonate ligands. Geometrical data for the prismatic nodes are reported in Table 1. The acs topology (point symbol (49.66)) applies to a net- work formed by linking trigonal prisms, as observed in tung- sten carbide, WC.[15] It is a uninodal edge-transitive net (one kind of node and one kind of edge). Some examples of acs networks in coordination polymers have been previously characterised.[15b,16] Figure 4.

This target topology is strictly determined by the rigid geometry of the molecular building blocks. Thus, it can be anticipated that other members of the families 3 and 4 might be obtained by changing the MIII or MII metals. To confirm this exceptional network preference, we car- ried out further experiments. We investigated the possible role of the countercation of the anionic metalloligands in driving the formation of the MOFs. After the preparation and the single-crystal X-ray characterisation of the species [CdL3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(PPN) (PPN=bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium) (2d’, see Table S1 in the Supporting Information), containing a bulky cation, we reacted it with AgClO4 under the same conditions as previously used for networking, and obtained the species [CdL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ClO4)2·Solv (4j’), which proved to be isostructural with 4j. Again, we observed that the change of a factor that might have had a drastic effect on the resulting framework had no effect within these species. It therefore seemed reasonable to expect that analogous MOFs containing mixed network nodes might be obtained by subjecting different metalloligands to the same reaction. We succeeded in synthesising the trimetallic species [ZnxFeyL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ClO4)(2x+3y)·Solv (5a) and [ZnxCdyL3Ag3]- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ClO4)2·Solv (5b) (both with x+y=1). By means of SEM equipped for elemental analysis, we confirmed in both cases the presence of the three metals in approximately the cor- rect ratios. The two compounds were found to display crys- tal cell parameters similar to those found for families 3 and 4 belonging to the same space group. The structure of 5b was successfully refined with a statistical distribution of Zn and Cd atoms at the network nodes (i.e., x=y=0.5; see Table S3 in the Supporting Information). The MO bond lengths (2.111(4)–2.160(4) ) were found to be intermediate between the ZnO (2.037(3)–2.084(4) ) and CdO (2.225(8)–2.268(4) ) bond lengths observed in the ZnII and CdII networks of family 4. Channel structure and nanoporous behaviour: In contrast to the well-established structural features of the networks, the content of the large intra-framework void spaces is much less easily understood due to marked disorder of the includ- ed species, as is often the case in nanoporous network poly- mers. Indeed, these void regions represent a large part of the cell volume and are mainly localised in large parallel channels of an almost hexagonal-shaped section, all running along the c-axis direction (see Figure 8). They contain the anions (often disordered and in some cases weakly interact- ing with the Ag+ ions), as well as the clathrate solvent mole- cules (mixtures of solvents), which are generally disordered. Though the data collections were performed at T=150 K, these molecules could not be located from the X-ray crystal- lographic data. A single channel of 4c is illustrated in Figure 9. The dimensions of the channels are determined by the mutual positions of the SBUs: as in the prototypical struc- ture of WC, with the acs topology, the channels are columns of stacked trigonal antiprismatic cages (as shown schemati- cally in Figure 10). The lengths of the M···M edges are reported in Table 1, specifically those of the d1, d2 and d3 edges (shown in Figure 10). Comparison shows that the networks are rather flexible (breathing nets have recently been defined as “soft Figure 7.

The three upper edges are longer (Zn···Zn 13.916 ) than the three lower ones (Zn···Zn 10.646 ). A dotted line shows one of the p–p inter- actions involving the phenyl rings (for 4c: 08/3.57 /1.66 /angle/dis- tance/offset between phenyl rings). Figure 8.

Carlucci et al. porous networks”),[17] especially because of the flexible link- age produced by the Ag+ ions; the geometrical variations reflect in part the nature of the nodes (of moderately in- creasing dimensions on going from FeIII to ZnII to CdII), but mainly the different contents of the channels. The cell vol- umes show significant differences, with values ranging from 3155.4(4) 3 (3b) to 3622(1) 3 (4k), accompanied by a de- crease of the c/a ratio from 1.17 to 1.03 (see Table 1 and Table S5 in the Supporting Information).[18] This trend im- plies a reduction of the stretching along the c-direction of the channels, with an enlargement of their section (parallel to the ab plane). Indeed, the d3 edges (see above) increase from 14.620  to 15.939  and the free voids from 37.5% to 47.8%. The walls of the channels are formed by the double edges described above (see Figure 7), with the bridging Ag atoms somewhat protruding towards the interior of the channels. Thus, the walls are covered by phenyl aromatic groups of the ligands, cyano groups and Ag atoms. The Ag atoms define the inner section of the channels and, as can be seen from the side view (Figure 9, bottom), they are disposed at the vertices of equilateral triangles with edges of about 9.53  in 4c. The diameter of the largest sphere that can be contained in these channels is about 5.4  (as computed with the program Cavity, implemented in Platon).[19] The channels can be easily accessed and de- pleted, so that the guest solvent mixtures are readily lost (at least in part) upon exposure to the air; the overall composi- tion is therefore not constant and to some extent can change with time. Notably, the presence of low-coordinated Ag atoms on the walls of the channels, which can be considered as coordi- natively unsaturated metal centres (UMCs)[3b,20] since they can adopt diverse coordination environments,[21] is of poten- tial interest because they can significantly interact with guest molecules. Indeed, most of the cases in which anions have been better localised have shown the existence of weak Ag···anion interactions inside the channels. Due to the fact that the guest species are severely disor- dered and cannot be located in the X-ray structures, the exact stoichiometries of these species are not easily deter- mined. Also, elemental analyses are not very meaningful be- cause the amounts of guest solvent are quite variable. To confirm the anionic content in family 4, we also pre- pared a polymeric network containing the perrhenate anion, specifically [CdL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ReO4)2 (4l), and performed an induc- tively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis on crystals of this spe- cies to establish the correct stoichiometric ratio among the three metals. The results showed the Re/Cd ratio (observed value 2.2) to be essentially correct, whereas the Ag/Cd ratio (observed value 4.3) was too high. This may be attributed to the fact that metallic silver inevitably settles on the surface of the crystals, as also shown by powder XRD patterns ac- quired from ground crystals.[22] Attempts to establish the nature and amount of the clath- rate solvent molecules were performed by 1H NMR spec- troscopy of mixtures obtained by suspending weighed crystal samples of the network species in CDCl3 for the time neces- sary to achieve equilibration. Dichloromethane, ethanol and water molecules in a variable ratio were found to fill the channels. For example, we determined for 4c (with penta- fluorotoluene as an added standard): [ZnL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ClO4)2- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2Cl2)0.10–2.47ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)0.46–1.07ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2.20–4.62. These experiments also showed the insolubility of the crystals under these conditions. No signals of the metallo- ACHTUNGTRENUNGligands or free ligands were detected in CDCl3 solution, Figure 9.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemeurj.org 12335 FULL PAPER Heterometallic Metal–Organic Frameworks and their Anion Exchange which implies that the amount of dissolved building blocks in the mother liquor was too low to be detected by NMR spectroscopy. The amounts of clathrate solvent molecules were not con- stant and depended on many experimental variables (such as the ambient temperature, the time needed to isolate the crystals, and so on), evidencing that they can be very easily removed from the frameworks. TG traces showed that the guests were completely lost in the temperature range 30–508C (about 10% w/w), while the networks proved to be stable up to about 2708C (see Fig- ure S3 in the Supporting Information). The process is rever- sible in that the desolvated samples left at RT adsorbed water from the ambient atmosphere very quickly (about 6% w/w) (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information for com- pound 4c). Moreover, during these processes the structure was retained, as evidenced by powder XRD analyses (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The results showed the desolvation to be a reversible single-crystal to single-crystal process.[23a] This behaviour could be essentially ascribed to a second-generation nanoporous material with a permanent porosity, assisted by a certain network flexibility (though the possibility that the distinct interpenetrating pcu nets can, at least in part, moderately change their relative positions during the depletion would seem to be a feature of third-generation materials).[24] Work is in progress to evalu- ate the adsorption properties and selectivity of the desolvat- ed species towards vapours and gases. Anion exchange: The most promising property of these net- works relies on their ability to exchange the anions present in their channels, taking into account the insolubility of the crystals in common solvents. Exchange experiments were performed to evaluate the preferred interactions of the frameworks with different anions. We selected as host net- works the [ZnL3Ag3]X2·Solv species, specifically 4b (X= BF4 ), 4c (X=ClO4 ), 4d (X=CF3SO3 ) and 4e (X=PF6 ). The exchanges were monitored by FTIR spectroscopy, opti- cal microscopy, powder XRD spectra (see Figure 11) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction on selected compounds. Sali- ent data are reported in Table 2. The conclusions that could be drawn from these results were that anions can be easily exchanged in single-crystal to single-crystal processes,[23b] and some preferences could also be extracted, for example: a) nitrate and perchlorate very readily displace BF4 , PF6  and triflate anions; b) triflate is very mobile and can be substituted by the other anions; c) using PF6 , we can easily substitute triflate, whereas the substitution of perchlorate is only partial. As described above, the channel walls are covered by low-coordinated silver ions (UMCs) and these exposed centres can interact with anions. The preferences observed in these exchanges are thus most likely related to the greater anion coordina- tion ability. The channel dimensions, on the other hand, are suitable for all of the exchanged anions, but the largest ones are only partially exchanged (see below). More quantitative competitive experiments are planned for future studies. Anyway, these materials seem good candidates for anion-ex- change processes. Our findings that the 1D channels are easily accessible and the satisfactory results of the exchange processes with inorganic anions prompted us to try to insert some different selected anionic species. In this way, we introduced into the network different anions, including organometallic motifs, organic molecules and coordination compounds, monitoring the exchange processes by FTIR spectroscopy and the struc- tural integrity of the crystals by powder XRD analysis. On the basis of previous exchange experiments, we selected as the starting polymer [ZnL3Ag3](X)2 with X=tetrafluorobo- rate (4b), because of the good mobility of these anions. The exchange experiments were performed by suspending 4b in solutions of different salts with selected anions. Perrhenate can easily displace the BF4  anion, and the pro- cess can be considered complete after about 1 h, as clearly Figure 11.

Carlucci et al. shown by IR spectroscopy monitoring (see Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). In this way, different metal-con- taining anions can be inserted into the network, generating new heterometallic host–guest systems. Other exchange experiments were carried out using or- ganometallic complex anions. The anionic dinuclear organo- metallic complex [Re2(CO)6ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m-OH)3] could be introduced into the 1D channels by exchange. In this case, the exchange was slower and after 1 d it was still only partial. However, IR spectroscopy clearly indicated the presence of the car- bonyl complex within the framework (see Figure S11 in the Supporting Information). Considering the large dimensions of this anion, it may be the case that it cannot diffuse into the interior of the crystal, but only into the peripheral re- gions. This last result opens the way to use our framework as a heterogeneous support for the immobilisation of organoACHTUNGTRENUNGmetallic compounds employed in homogeneous catal- ysis. We attempted to insert the anion [HFe(CO)4] using a fourfold excess of its NEt4 + salt in MeOH, but the exchange was quite modest and was accompanied by some destruction of the network. On the other hand, exchange with [Ni(CN)4]2 was almost complete within 3 h, but it proceed- ed with some structural modification, as evidenced by powder XRD. In this way, it seems that it may be possible to devise strategies for the elimination of cyano-metal com- plexes from solutions. Partial exchanges were observed using sodium acetate and sodium prolinate. Finally, when the exchanges involved anions that strongly interacted with the silver atoms of the network (such as halides and pseudo-halides or BH4 ), dras- tic structural changes or even framework decomposition were evident from the powder XRD spectra. Conclusion The well-established synthetic strategy involving the use of rigid metalloligands for the construction of a target struc- ture, in this case heterometallic metal–organic frameworks, seemed to work well. We employed the b-diketone 1,3- bis(4’-cyanophenyl)-1,3-propanedione (HL) to build novel tris-chelate metalloligands [ML3] (M=CoIII, FeIII) and [ML3] (M=MnII, CoII, ZnII, CdII). These are chiral octahe- dral building blocks with six exo-oriented cyano donor groups suitable for the construction of nanoporous MOFs by reaction with a number of AgX silver salts. We obtained more than twenty heterometallic networks [MIIIL3Ag3]X3·Solv and [MIIL3Ag3]X2·Solv, with the peculiar feature that all exhibit the same type of network structure, in spite of the different metal nodes, ionic charges and X counteranions. In addition, these networks represent the first example of sixfold interpenetration for the pcu topolo- gy, belonging to Class IIIa. The nanoporous behaviour and anion-exchange ability have been investigated and we suc- ceeded in replacing, at least partially, the original anions in the channels with selected anionic species, such as coordina- tion complexes and organometallic anions. The walls of the channels are covered by Ag+ ions that can interact with the guest species. These results are of interest both from a structural and from a functional point of view. Due to the easy reproduci- bility of construction of the 3D network structures, many new species based on other MII and MIII metal ions (ob- tained through the synthesis of their corresponding metallo- ligands) can be anticipated. Mixed metalloACHTUNGTRENUNGliACHTUNGTRENUNGgand frame- works can also be constructed, as we have demonstrated (with compounds 5a and 5b). Heteropolymetallic systems can thus, in principle, be assembled, taking further advant- age of the possibility of inserting metal complexes within the array by anion-exchange processes, as we have accom- plished here with the insertion of ReO4 , [Re2(CO)6(OH)3] and [Ni(CN)4]2. Potential applications to be considered in the future in- clude storage and elimination from solutions of anionic metal complexes or specific organic anions and immobilisa- tion of catalytic fragments. Experimental Section Reagents and general procedures: All commercial reagents and solvents employed (Sigma–Aldrich) were of high-grade purity and were used as supplied without further purification. NEt4ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Re2(CO)6(OH)3], K- ACHTUNGTRENUNG[HFe(CO)4] and K2[Ni(CN)4] were synthesised according to literature methods.[25–27] All manipulations were performed under aerobic condi- tions unless standard Schlenk techniques were required. Anhydrous tet- rahydrofuran was freshly distilled under nitrogen from sodium/benzophe- none. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AC300 or AC400 instru- ments; d values are given in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane. Infrared spectra were collected on a Perkin–Elmer PARAGON 1000 FTIR spec- trometer equipped with an i-series FTIR microscope. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin–Elmer TGA7 instrument under dynamic nitrogen (total flow rate 20 cm3min1). A ramp rate of 108Cmin1 in the range 30–6508C was used. Powder patterns were re- corded on a Philips PW1820 diffractometer (CuKa radiation, l= 1.5405 ) in the 5–358 2q range (0.028 and 2.5 s per step). Magnetic sus- ceptibilities (cM) were determined at room temperature using an MSB- AUTO (Sherwood Scientific) magnetic balance. Three measurements were performed for every sample (50–100 mg). Diamagnetic corrections were estimated from Pascals constants. Elemental analyses were carried out at the Microanalytical Laboratory of the University of Milan. Semi- quantitative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were per- formed with a JEOL JSM-5500LV instrument equipped with an EDS spectrometer IXRF EDS2000. The Zn/Re/Ag ratio was determined by ICP-MS (Perkin-Elmer ELAN5500) after microwave digestion of the sample in concentrated HNO3. 1,3-Bis(4’-cyanophenyl)-1,3-propanedione (HL): Anhydrous THF (32 mL) was added under nitrogen to a dispersion of 60% NaH in miner- al oil (1.3833 g, 34.58 mmol). The mixture was cooled to 08C, whereupon 4-acetylbenzonitrile (1.6523 g, 11.38 mmol) was added. A solution of methyl 4-cyanobenzoate (2.0131 g, 12.49 mmol) in anhydrous THF (8 mL) was then added dropwise over a period of 15 min. The pale- yellow mixture was refluxed for 16 h under nitrogen and then quenched with ice. Upon addition of 0.1m HCl, the ligand HL was precipitated as a yellow solid and was recovered by filtration and washed with distilled H2O. The filtrate was extracted with AcOEt (3100 mL) and the collect- ed organic phases were washed with a saturated aqueous solution of NaCl and dried over MgSO4. Evaporation of the solvent under vacuum gave further HL. Both batches of solid were washed with hot EtOH (40 mL) to afford pure HL as a pale-yellow solid. Yield: 70%; 1H NMR Chem. Eur.

Synthesis of {[ZnIIL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(BF4)2}.Solv (4b): A typical synthesis of a member of family 4 of MOFs is described here: compound 2c (502.0 mg, 0.494 mmol) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (215 mL) (solution A) and AgBF4 (288.9 mg, 1.484 mmol) was dissolved in EtOH (215 mL) (solution B). Portions of solution B (20 mL) were slowly added to solution A (20 mL) in ten crystallising dishes (50 mL). Yellow microcrystalline powders were formed in about 5 days upon slow concentration of the respective solu- tions left exposed to the air. The solid was collected on a Buchner funnel, washed with CH2Cl2 and dried in air to obtain 4b.

Crystals of 4a–k suitable for X-ray analyses were obtained by the slow diffusion method using solutions of the anionic monomers in CH2Cl2 and solutions of the appropriate silver salts in EtOH. Synthesis of [CdIIL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ReO4)2·Solv (4l): Crystals of 4l suitable for X- ray analysis were obtained by layering solutions of (NBu4)ReO4 (4 equiv) and silver tetrafluoroborate (3 equiv) in EtOH onto a solution of the mo- nomer 2d (1 equiv) in CH2Cl2. Relative Cd/Re/Ag ratio determined by ICP analysis: 4.4:1:2.2 (calcd. 3:1:2). The high value for silver can be as- cribed to the deposition of metallic silver on the crystal surface, as evi- denced by powder XRD analysis. Synthesis of {[ZnxMyL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ClO4)z} (M=CdII, z=2 (5a); M=FeIII, z= 2x+3y ACHTUNGTRENUNG(5b)): Crystals of 5a and 5b suitable for X-ray analyses were ob- tained by slow diffusion of an ethanolic solution of silver perchlorate into dichloromethane solutions containing equimolar amounts of monomers 2c/2d and 2c/1a, respectively. Anion-exchange procedures (with NaBF4, NaClO4, NaNO3 and KPF6): Compounds 4b–e (100 mg) were suspended in saturated solutions of NaClO4, NaNO3, KPF6 or NaBF4 in methanol (30 mL). The exchange processes were monitored by IR spectroscopy at regular intervals of 15 min or 1 h. Before each measurement, the sample was collected by fil- tration, washed with methanol and dried in air. To verify that the struc- ture of the networks was retained during the exchange process, powder XRD spectra were recorded. Exchange with (NBu4)ReO4: A sample of 4b (51.1 mg) was added to a 0.050m solution of (NBu4)ReO4 in methanol (4 mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature. The solid was then recovered by filtration, washed with methanol and dried in air. The exchange process was con- firmed by the appearance of an absorption band at about 915 cm1 in the IR spectrum due to the ReO4  anion and the disappearance of the broad band due to the BF4  anion at 1054 cm1. After 1 h, the process could be considered complete. Powder XRD analysis confirmed the integrity of the exchanged network. Exchange with (NEt4)ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Re2(CO)6(OH)3]: A sample of 4b (50.0 mg) was added to a 0.034m solution of (NEt4)ACHTUNGTRENUNG[Re2(CO)6(OH)3] in methanol (10 mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 d. The solid was then recovered by filtration, washed with methanol and dried in air. The IR spectrum of the exchanged solid showed the presence of carbonyl bands at 1998 and 1882 cm1. The IR band due to the BF4  anion decreased in intensity and moved from 1054 to 1084 cm1. The per- sistence of the bands due to the BF4  anion evidenced only a partial ex- change process. The n(CN) band shifted from 2252 to 2230 cm1. Powder XRD analysis confirmed the integrity of the exchanged network. Exchange with K2[Ni(CN)4]: A sample of 4b (81.2 mg) was added to a 0.013m solution of K2[Ni(CN)4] in MeOH/H2O (2:1; 30 mL) and the mix- ture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. A colour change from yellow-brown to green was observed within a few minutes. The solid was then recovered by filtration, washed with water and dried in air. The IR spectrum showed the presence of n(CN) bands at 2238 and 2230 cm1 (at- tributed to the network) and at 2168 cm1 due to exchanged [Ni(CN)4]2. An additional less intense n(CN) band was observed at 2130 cm1, which as yet remains unassigned, although we note that the n(CN) band of free [Ni(CN)4]2 is at 2130 cm1. The absorption bands due to the BF4  anion disappeared, evidencing a complete exchange process. Powder XRD analysis of the exchanged solid showed some structural modifications. To exclude a possible role of water in producing the structural modifica- tion during the exchange process, a sample of compound 4b was left in a methanol/water mixture (2:1) for the same duration as that required for the exchange experiment; the same type of pattern as for the original 4b was detected by powder XRD. Exchange with KSCN: A sample of 4b (12.6 mg) was added to a saturat- ed solution of KSCN in methanol (4 mL) and immediately the mixture changed colour from brown to yellow. The solid was then recovered by filtration, washed with methanol and dried in air. The IR spectrum of the exchanged solid showed a band due to the presence of SCN at 2088 cm1 and a lowering in the intensity of the bands due to the BF4  anion. Powder XRD analysis showed a complete transformation of the network. Exchange with NaBH4: A sample of 4b (66.8 mg) was added to a 0.484m solution of NaBH4 in methanol (30 mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature. Immediately, the colour changed from brown to green. After 5 min, the solid was recovered by filtration, washed with methanol and dried in air. Powder XRD analysis showed a degradation of the network with the formation of metallic silver. Exchange with sodium prolinate: A sample of 4b (106.0 mg) was added to a 0.010m solution of sodium prolinate in methanol (30 mL) (pH 8) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The solid was then recovered by filtration, washed with methanol and dried in air. The IR spectrum of the exchanged solid, recovered after 1 h, showed a change in the absorption region corresponding to BF4 . No further changes were detected in the IR spectrum. Powder XRD analysis confirmed the integ- rity of the exchanged network, but some new peaks appeared. These data did not give clear evidence on the extent of the exchange process. Exchange with sodium acetate: A sample of 4b (106.0 mg) was added to a 0.020m solution of sodium acetate in methanol (30 mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The solid was then recovered by filtration, washed with methanol and dried in air. The IR spectrum of the exchanged solid showed a lowering of the intensity of the absorption bands due to the BF4  anion. However, the presence in the network of acetate was difficult to confirm because its bands were coincident with those of the network. The n(CN) band shifted from 2252 to 2229 cm1. Powder XRD analysis confirmed the preservation of the network. Analysis by 1H NMR of guest solvents: Aliquots of 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoro- toluene (2 mL) were added to portions of CDCl3 (0.75 mL) in NMR tubes and the 1H NMR spectrum of such a solution was acquired. Crys- tals (5–10 mg) of compounds 4b–4e and 4h were removed from their mother liquors, dried on filter paper, weighed and quickly transferred to the NMR tubes. 1H NMR spectra were acquired after about 3 h. No changes in the relative ratios between the signals were detected after this period. The signal at d=2.26 ppm due to the CH3 group of 2,3,4,5,6-pen- tafluorotoluene was used as an internal standard to compute the amounts of clathrate solvents. Three experiments were performed for each sample. The formulae deduced were as follows: ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ZnL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(BF4)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2Cl2)0.36–1.00ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)0.87–1.20ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)1.93–4.52 (4b); ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ZnL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ClO4)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2Cl2) 0.10–2.47ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)0.46–1.07ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)2.20–4.62 (4c); ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ZnL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CF3SO3)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2Cl2)0.76ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)1.12–1.15ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)1.95–2.79 (4d); ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ZnL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(PF6)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2Cl2)0.18–0.20ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)0.47–1.70ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)0.61–1.55 (4e); ACHTUNGTRENUNG[ZnL3Ag3]ACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2Cl2)0.49–0.82ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)1.25–1.85ACHTUNGTRENUNG(H2O)3.11–3.41 (4h). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA): TGA of compounds 4b–4e and 4h was performed in the range 30–6508C. They each showed a weight loss of about 10% in the range 30–508C due to the desolvation process and a second weight loss of about 50% due to network decomposition that started at different temperatures for the different polymers (range 220– 2908C) (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). For polymer 4c, the desolvation process was further monitored by heating two different samples to 1008C and then cooling one of them to room temperature in air and the other under nitrogen. TG analyses of these samples heated up to 1008C showed a weight loss of about 6% for the sample cooled in air and no weight loss for the sample cooled under nitrogen (see Fig- ure S4 in the Supporting Information). Crystallography: Crystal data for 1,3-bis(4’-cyanophenyl)-1,3-propane- dione (HL) and for the metalloligands 1b, 2b–2d and 2d’ are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information), whereas those for the MOFs 3a,b, 4b,c, 4e, 4i–4l and 5b are listed in Table S3 (Supporting Information). Selected bond distances and angles are given in Tables S2 and S4 (Sup- porting Information). Data were collected on a Bruker APXII-CCD dif- fractometer using MoKa radiation (l=0.71073 ). Empirical absorption corrections (SADABS)[28] were applied to all data. The structures were solved by direct methods (SIR97)[29] and refined by full-matrix least- squares on F2 (SHELX-97)[30] using the WINGX interface.[31] All hydro- gen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions and subse- quently refined using a riding model with Uiso(H)=1.2 Ueq(C), except in the case of the ligand HL, for which the hydrogen atoms were located Chem.

Anisotropic thermal parameters were assigned to all non-hy- drogen atoms, except in certain cases. Specifically, in compound 2b iso- tropic thermal parameters were assigned to the clathrate THF molecules and to the tetraethylammonium cation, whereas in compounds 3a and 4l they were assigned to all atoms of the anions other than the heavier ones (S and Re). The accessible free voids were calculated by PLATON.[19] Further details of the refinements of the disordered groups observed can be found in the cif file (under refine special details keyword). Crystals of 1b and 3b proved to be unstable, showing high decays of 24% and 12%, respectively, hence resulting in high R values. Except for the ligand HL, crystals of all monomers and polymers were unstable in air and so had to be kept under mineral oil. All tested crystals of 1b, 2b, 3a,b, 4b, 4c, 4i–4l also showed weak diffraction, hence resulting in high R values. All structures of polymers and [FeL2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(m-OMe)]2 were found to contain disordered anions and solvents (such as dichloromethane, ethanol, meth- anol and water). When it was difficult to refine a consistent model for the solvents or the anions, their contribution was subtracted from the ob- served structure factors according to the BYPASS procedure,[32] as imple- mented in PLATON with the command SQUEEZE. In 4c, 4k,l and 5b, the anions were refined with total occupancies of 2/3 for electroneutrali- ty. In 4e, only one hexafluorophosphate anion (disordered over three po- sitions) was located. In 4j, the perchlorate anions were refined with a constraint of a total occupancy of four perchlorate anions per unit cell (instead of eight for the two Wyckoff positions 6d and 2g) for electro- neutrality. In 3b, 4b and 4i, the anions were found to be strongly disor- dered and could not be located, so their contribution was subtracted with SQUEEZE; nonetheless, we report the anions in the formula since they are indeed present in the solid. The diagrams were produced using the ORTEP,[33] TOPOS,[34] and Mercury[35] programs. CCDC-776202–776218 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

[18] We have characterised by single-crystal X-ray diffraction eight MOFs with Zn (Table 1 and Table S5 in the Supporting Informa- tion) having the same network structure, in which the anions popu- late the channels (free or only weakly coordinated to Ag+ ions), that exhibit c/a values from 1.11 to 1.04 and volumes from 3239 to 3550 3 in response to the total channel content (not only due to the anion dimensions). We have observed variations of the channels, shrinkage of which, corresponding to reduction of the free voids, im- plies an increase of the c/a ratio. This would seem to be a possible deformation path and needs to be fully confirmed for this compound in future research. [19] A. L. Spek, J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003, 36, 7–13. [20] S. Kitagawa, S. Noro, T. Nakamura, Chem. Commun. 2006, 701– 707. [21] J.-P. Zhang, S. Horike, S. Kitagawa, Angew. Chem. 2007, 119, 907– 910; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2007, 46, 889–892. [22] Due to the very poor solubility of these compounds in common sol- vents, it was not possible to establish the anion contents by direct so- lution NMR analyses. We have tried to quantify the amount of BF4  anions contained in the channels of the corresponding polymers by 19F NMR spectroscopy of solutions obtained after exchange of ClO4  by BF4  (see text below), using trifluorotoluene as a standard. The experimental amounts of anions corresponded to almost the correct ratio. Elemental analyses of the crystals attempted by means of SEM showed only that the content of the channels is highly varia- ble and can change from one crystal to another, as well as within the same crystal from one region to another. Hence, we can con- clude that the composition of the channels is very changeable. [23] a) To confirm the nature of the desolvation/resolvation process, a few single crystals of compound 4b were desolvated in an oven at 1008C for 30 min (see TGA in Figure S3 in the Supporting Informa- tion) and then left in air at room temperature. After these processes, the single crystallinity was maintained and the single-crystal X-ray diffraction pattern at room temperature yielded cell parameters of a=b=15.72(5); c=16.19(5) ; V=3476(12) 3. b) A few single crystals of compound 4b were suspended in a saturated methanolic solution of NaClO4 and the mixture was left under moderate shak- ing for 3 h. Observation of the crystals under an optical microscope revealed that they had retained their shape (see Figure S13 in the Supporting Information) and the IR spectrum obtained from a por- tion of this sample showed that BF4  had been exchanged by ClO4 . Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of a few selected crystals at room temperature revealed that the single crystallinity had been preserved and that the cell parameters were very similar to the orig- inal ones for 4a, for example, a=b=15.53(6); c=16.28(6) ; V= 3400(12) 3. The same result was obtained after leaving the crystals in a saturated methanolic solution of NaClO4 for 24 h. [24] a) S. Kitagawa, M. Kondo, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1998, 71, 1739– 1753; b) K.

Figure S2. Molecular structure of the centrosymmetric dinuclear species [FeL2(μ-OMe)]2. Crystal data: C70H42Fe2N8O10, Fw= 1266.82, Monoclinic, space group P21/c (No. 14), a = 9.511(2) Å, b = 28.803(5) Å, c = 14.351(2) Å, β = 107.060(2)°, V = 3759(1) Å3, Z = 2, Dcalcd = 1.119 g cm-3, T = 150(2) K. The crystal is unstable in air; it was collected under mineral oil. The structure contains disordered solvents. Because it was not possible to refine a consistent disordered model, their contribution was subtracted from the observed structure factors according to the BYPASS procedure, as implemented in PLATON (A.L. Spek, J. Appl. Cryst., 2003, 36, 7). Least-squares refinement on F2 based on 5038 reflections with I > 4σ(I) and 406 parameters using 0 restraints led to final R1 = 0.0582 and wR2 = 0.1503. The R before squeeze was R1 = 0.1882 for 5038 Fo > 4σ(Fo). The two Fe(III) atoms, placed at a distance of 3.085 Å, show distorted octahedral coordination geometry, the FeO6 chromophore presenting similar Fe-O bond distances in the range 1.967(2)- 2.003(2) Å and O-Fe-O cisoid and transoid angles in the ranges 76.96(8)-103.56(8)° and 165.96(8)-168.12(8)°, respectively. 2 Figure S3.
