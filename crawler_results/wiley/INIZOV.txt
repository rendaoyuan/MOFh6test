Manuscript ARTICLE DOI: 10.1002/zaac.201000256 Effect of the Length of Fatty Acid Ligands on Lead(II) Complexes Based on a 1,10-Phenanthroline Derivative Xiu-Li Wang,*[a] Qiang Gao,[a] Yong-Qiang Chen,[a] Guo-Cheng Liu,[a] Ai-Xiang Tian,[a] and Zhen-Hui Kang[b] Keywords: Coordination polymers; Lead; Fatty acids; Hydrothermal syntheses; Crystal structure Abstract. Two new PbII metal-organic coordination polymers [Pb(3- pdip)(glu)]·H2O (1) and [Pb(3-pdip)2(odc)]·2H2O (2) [3-pdip = 2-(3- pyridine)imidazo[4,5-f]1,10- phenanthroline, H2glu = glutaric acid, H2odc = octanedioic acid], were synthesized by hydrothermal reactions of varying fatty acid ligands, and structurally characterized by single- crystal X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 exhibits a one dimensional (1D) chain structure, in which 3-pdip ligands are attached to one side of the 1D chain. Complex 2 exhibits also a 1D chain structure, in which some Introduction Coordination polymers have attracted extensive attention due to their fascinating structure topologies and potential applica- tion as functional solid materials in catalysis, molecular recog- nition, magnetism, photochemistry, etc. [1–6]. The rational de- sign and synthesis of these complexes have received intense interest. Considerable progress has been made on the theoreti- cal prediction [7, 8]. However, it is well-known that predicting the exact structures and assembling compositions of polymeric complexes are still great challenges. Several elements includ- ing some weak interactions may affect the network structure of compound, such as π–π stacking [9], hydrogen-bonding in- teractions [10], etc. Rational selection of ligands and metal ions with specific coordination environment is an effective and important way to construct these coordination polymers [11– 13]. Lead(II) is a heavy p-block metal ion, which has a large radius and exhibits variable coordination modes, so it is able to construct interesting topologic networks [14–16]. Further- more, it has notable photochemical and photophysical proper- ties [17–20]. Plater et al. reported the synthesis and application of some PbII coordination polymers constructed from fatty acid ligands [6, 21, 22]. As an extension of our previous work [23], * Prof. Dr. X.-L.

Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2011, 637, 142–147 paired 3-pdip ligands are affiliated on both sides of the 1D chain. In the title complexes, the π–π stacking and hydrogen-bonding interac- tions extend the 1D chain into a 3D supramolecular framework, respec- tively. The structural differences between the title complexes indicate the importance of fatty acid length for the creation of molecular archi- tectures. Moreover, the thermal and fluorescence properties of title complexes are also reported. we selected two kinds of fatty acids with different lengths act- ing as secondary ligands to investigate their effect on the struc- tures of lead complexes based on 2-(3-pyridine) imidazo[4,5- f]1,10-phenanthroline (3-pdip). In this paper, we report two new coordination polymers, namely, [Pb(3-pdip)(glu)]·H2O (1) and [Pb(3-pdip)2(odc)]· 2H2O (2) (H2glu = glutaric acid, H2odc = octanedioic acid). Both have one-dimensional (1D) chain structures, which are extended into 3D supramolecular structures by π–π stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions. However, obvious differen- ces are observed in the coordination modes of these complexes. The thermal and fluorescence properties of the title complexes were also investigated. Results and Discussion Description of Crystal Structures Structural Analysis of [Pb(3-pdip)(glu)]·H2O (1) As shown in Figure 1a, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analy- sis revealed that complex 1 consists of one 3-pdip ligand, one glu anion and one PbII ion. Each PbII ion is hexacoordinated by four oxygen atoms from two carboxyl groups of glu ligands [Pb–O distances range from 2.39(7) to 2.65(1) Å] and two ni- trogen atoms belonging to one 3-pdip ligand with the bond lengths of 2.63(4) Å [Pb(1)–N(1)] and 2.61(1) Å [Pb(1)–N(2)], showing a distorted pentagonal pyramid arrangement. All above bond lengths are within the normal range [24]. All glu ligands adopt a bridging bis-bidentate coordination mode to connect adjacent PbII ion into a 1D chain, in which 3-pdip li- gands are attached to one side of this chain (Figure 1b). In addition, there exists one lattice water molecule in the molecu- lar architecture. Lead(II) Complexes Based on a 1,10-Phenanthroline Derivative Figure 1.

KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 143 The 3-pdip ligand has a large conjugated system that forms two types of π–π interactions with different strength (ca. 3.689 and 3.827 Å; see Figure S1 in Supporting Information) in com- plex 1. Figure 2a shows the structure of 1D double chain formed by the weaker π–π stacking interactions between the 3- pdip ligands. Another π–π stacking interaction exists between two adjacent 1D double chains (Figure 2b), which leads to the formation of 2D supramolecular layers in the ab plane (Fig- ure 2c). Moreover, there are two kinds of hydrogen-bonding interactions: N(4)–H(4A)···O(4) [2.853(5) Å] and C(10)– H(10A)···O(1) [3.148(7) Å] in 1. Two loops [R2 2(16), R2 2(10)] with different sizes are formed by these hydrogen-bonding in- teractions (see Figure 3). Weak intermolecular interactions ex- pand the molecular architecture of complex 1 into a 3D supra- molecular network, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 3. Hydrogen-bonding interactions in complex 1.

Structural Analysis of [Pb(3-pdip)2(odc)]·2H2O (2) To further investigate the influence of the spacer lengths of fatty acid ligands on the molecular architecture, we selected H2odc to react with Pb(NO3)2 in presence of 3-pdip and ob- tained complex 2. As shown in Figure 5, the structure of com- plex 2 is quite different from that of complex 1. Each PbII ion is octacoordinated by four oxygen atoms from two carboxyl groups of odc ligands and four nitrogen atoms of two 3-pdip ligands. Along with the increase in length of the fatty acid, the X.-L. Wang et al. ARTICLE Figure 5. (a) Coordination environment of the PbII ion in complex 2 (at 30 % probability level).

Chem. 2011, 142–147 Pb–Pb distance (11.92 Å) bridged by the dicarboxylate function is further enlarged. Two 3-pdip ligands seem to act as “wings”, whereas the PbII acts as “trunk”. Thus, they compose a butter- fly-like structure. It is uncommon that two 3-pdip ligands with big steric hindrance are attached to the same metal ion. The 1D chain, which is formed by odc and PbII and modified by 3-pdip ligands, assumes spiral configuration, as shown in Figure S2. π–π stacking interactions and hydrogen-bonding interactions play important roles in the assembly process of the supramolec- ular architecture in 2. The interplanar distance (3.551 Å) be- tween two neighboring 3-pdip ligands of adjacent chains (Fig- ure S3) clearly shows the presence of π–π interactions, which expand the molecular architecture into a beautiful sinusoidal ruffling layer structure (Figure 6a). Furthermore, N(4)– H(4A)···O(2) [2.760(5) Å], the only hydrogen-bonding interac- tion in 2, extends the sinusoidal ruffling layers into a 3D supra- molecular structure (Figure 6b, Figure S4). Additionally, there exist two lattice water molecules in the molecular architecture. In complexes 1 and 2, two fatty acid ligands H2glu and H2odc were utilized, respectively, in order to investigate the influence of the spacer lengths of fatty acid ligands on the molecular Figure 7. (a) Coordination mode of H2glu and the coordination sphere of the PbII ion in complex 1. (b) Coordination mode of H2odc and coordination sphere of the PbII ion in complex 2. Lead(II) Complexes Based on a 1,10-Phenanthroline Derivative architecture. The coordination modes of these ligands are shown in Figure 7. It can be seen that H2odc is more flexible than H2glu because of the different number of –(CH2)n– spacers between the two carboxylate groups of the ligands. This leads to the obvious difference of spacer size that can be utilized around PbII ion. In complex 1, the coordination sphere of the PbII ion is hemi- directed, whereas it is holodirected in 2. Complex 1 exhibits a 1D chain structure, in which 3-pdip ligands are attached to one side of this chain. Complex 2 has also a 1D chain structure, in which some paired 3-pdip ligands are affiliated on both sides of the 1D chain. These structural differences of the title complexes indicate the importance of fatty acid length for the creation of molecular architectures. Fluorescence Property of Complexes 1 and 2 The fluorescence property of the title complexes was exam- ined in the solid state at room temperature. Complex 1 shows a main emission peak at 545 nm (exciting at 320 nm) with a shoulder at about 468 nm and complex 2 shows an emission peak at 470 nm (exciting at 300 nm) (Figure 8). As is known, the emission peak of the ligand 3-pdip is at 422 nm (exciting at 260 nm) [25], therefore, the main peaks of the title com- Figure 8. Fluorescence spectra for (a) complex 1; (b) complex 2 in the solid state at room temperature. Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2011, 142–147 © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.zaac.wiley-vch.de 145 plexes can be taken as the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) according to the literature [26, 27]. The shoulder peak of complex 1 is probably due to an intra-ligand energy transi- tion [28]. As can be seen from Figure 8, the title complexes show distinct emission position and intensity of the main peak in the fluorescence spectra, which can be attributed to the dif- ferent coordination environments around the metal ions [29, 30]. Thermal Property of Complexes 1 and 2 To examine the thermal stability of the title complexes, their decomposition behaviors were examined by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) with a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1 in the tem- perature range of 25–700 °C, as shown in Figure S5 (Support- ing Information). There are two weight loss steps in every com- plex. The lattice water molecule is lost from 180–198 °C in complex 1, which corresponds to the weight loss of 2.26 % (calcd. 2.76 %). The second sharp weight loss is observed in the range 236–420 °C, corresponding to the decomposition of organic ligands (63.54 %, calcd. 63.04 %). The remaining weight is in agreement with PbO (34.29 %, calcd. 34.20 %). Similar to 1, in complex 2 the first step starts at 110 °C and is completed at 150 °C, which corresponds to the release of lattice water molecules (4.53 %, calcd. 3.56 %). The organic ligands are burned in the temperature range 273–586 °C, corre- sponding to a weight loss of 73.15 % (calcd. 74.34 %). The remaining weight (22.36 %) is in agreement with PbO (calcd. 22.10 %). Conclusion Two new PbII coordination polymers [Pb(3-pdip)(glu)]·H2O (1), and [Pb(3-pdip)2(odc)]·2H2O (2) with fatty acid ligands (H2glu, H2odc) and 3-pdip ligands were prepared under hydro- thermal conditions. Structure analyses show that the title com- plexes have 1D polymeric chain structures, which are extended into 3D supramolecular structures by weak interactions. It is noteworthy that there are significant differences in the coordi- nation modes of complexes 1 and 2. These results indicate that secondary ligands play an important role in the molecular archi- tecture control, which suggests a way to tune the structures of coordination polymers using fatty acid ligands with different lengths. Experimental Section Materials and Measurements All reagents were of analytical grade; they were purchased and used without further purification. The ligand 3-pdip was synthesized by fol- lowing the procedures described in literature [31]. FT-IR spectra (KBr pellets) were conducted with a Magna FT-IR 560 spectrometer. Elemen- tal analyses (C, H, and N) were performed with a Perkin–Elmer 240C element analyzer. A Pyris Diamond thermal analyzer was used to col- lect the thermogravimetric data of complexes 1 and 2. Their fluores- cence spectra were measured with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence/phos- phorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature. X.-L. Wang et al.

X-ray Crystallography Crystallographic data of title compounds were collected with a Bruker Apex CCD diffractometer (Mo-Kα radiation, graphite monochromator, λ = 0.71073 Å) at room temperature. The structures of the compounds were solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97 and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method on F2 with SHELXL-97 [32, 33] crys- tallographic software package. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, the hydrogen atoms from nitrogen atom of imidazole ring in ligand 3-pdip were located in different Fourier synthesis maps, whereas the hydrogen atoms of the fatty acid were generated theoreti- cally onto the specific atoms and refined isotropically with fixed ther- mal factors.
