Manuscript COMMUNICATIONS Two-Dimensional Sheets of Tetragonal Copper(i1) Lattices: X-Ray Crystal Structure and Magnetic Properties Satoshi Kawata, Susumu Kitagawa," Mitsuru Kondo, Isamu Furuchi, and Megumu Munakata of ICu(C,O,CI2)(C,H*N2)1, Transition metal coordination polymers have been the subject of intensive research in the last few decades, and major advances have been made in both their theoretical description and their applications as new materials.['] The most remarkable develop- ments are perhaps the preparation and characterization of molec- ular-based magnets and oxide superconductors.[21 Some of these compounds are considered as two-dimensional (2D) systems having interesting cooperative effects. We were thus interested in novel 2D compounds based on transition metal complexes. Transition metal complexes can form various kinds of assem- blies. Two-dimensional coordination polymers having coupled localized metal d electrons and delocalized ligand n electrons are of substantial interest owing to their anticipated cooperative magnetic behavior and conductive properties. In particular, 2D copper polymers are the preferred systems for the realization of a new conductive and magnetic phase as an extreme case of the Hubbard model, in which a single electron spin is arranged on each corner of a square lattice.[31 Many inorganic metal halides, calcogenides, and hydroxides have layered structures.[2c1 But molecular-based layer compounds, in which spins on metals are coupled over a sheet, are still rare, on account of the lack of methods for linking monomer units. Fortunately, there are many 1 D coordination polymers.[*'% 41 and cooperative phe- nomena have been observed in several I D polymers containing bridging organic ligands such as oxalate,['] squarate,I6] and 3.6-substituted 2,5-dihydroxy-p-benzoquinones (H,(R,- DHBQ)) .I7] A useful approach to 2D coordination polymers is to fabricate "woven" 2D coordination polymers from 1 D poly- mers as the warp and additional ligands as the woof, which bridge the linear chains. A key point here is the choice of bridg- ing ligands, which should link the I D polymers without break- ing the chain structures. Chloranilic acid (H,CA, which corresponds to H,(R,- DHBQ) with R = CI) forms ID chains with Ca", Sr". and YII1 ions, which are interlinked by CA* ~ or another bridging ligands such as water rnolecule~.[~~~ i1 These results encouraged us to utilize CA chains of transition metals as the warp in a 2D poly- mer. We have succeeded in synthesizing and characterizing a 2D polymer 1 (pz = pyrazine), where pz is used as the woof in the woven coordination polymer. The structure and magnetic prop- erties of the corresponding ID polymer. [CufCA)],. were first reported in 1962.[7h,g1 Although the X-ray structure has not been published, EXAFS studies and the magnetic properties imply one-dimensional ribbon structures for [Cu(CA)], and [*] Prof. Dr. S .

All copper atoms of 1 are linked by coordi- nation bonds giving a 2D structure essential to a 2D band struc- ture. The sheets are well separated from each other: the shortest interlayer metal-metal distance is 9.785(2) A, while within the layer the distances between the nearest neighbors Cu-CA-Cu and Cu-pz-Cu are 7.993(1) and 6.977(2) A. respectively. In con- trast, zigzag chains are found in ([Y,(CA),(H,O),] ' 6.6H,0},[7'1 and {Na,[M(H,-DHBQ),] . (HZ0)24)n (M = Mn", Cd11),[9"1 and additional H,-DHBQ2- ions link these chains to afford large cavities available for building zeolite- or clathrate- like structure~.[~l Fig. 1.

Cu-N-C(4), 121.7(2). The geometry around the copper atom is a distorted elongat- ed octahedron. All of the CA2- ligands and the copper atoms sit on the crystallographic mirror plane, and the line connecting the copper and nitrogen atoms of the pz ligands coincides with the crystallographic twofold axis perpendicular to the mirror plane, which indicates that the Cu -N bonds are perpendicular to the CAZ- plane. The Cu-N distance (2.091(2) A) is slightly longer than those for usual bridging pz ligands in Cu" complex- es.[lo1 The pz ligand is also planar, and the Cu-pz-Cu distance falls within the range reported for pz-bridged complexes.['01 The twist angle (0 = 14.7") of the pz ring out of the plane CuN,O, is small compared with that in other pz-bridged polymers. Inter- estingly, the Cu-0 distances are not identical: one (1.955(2) A) is similar to that found in the corresponding linear chains (EXAFS whereas the other (2.290(2) A) is longer than the C-0 separations reported for typical Cu" com- plexes.["] The effect of the asymmetrical coordination is also found in the different C-0 distances in the CAZ- ion. 1.233(3) and 1.281(3) A. One of the distances is shorter than those reported for the free chloranilate ion (1.243(7), 1.253(7) A)-["] and the other is longer, which indicates that the ligand has a p-quinone l3l like that in [C~,(terpy),(CA)]~+ COMMUNICATIONS (terpy = 2,2' : 6',2"-terpyridine) ,I' 3i'1 but is dissimilar to the ligands in [[Y,(CA),(H,O),] . 6.6 H20),r[7i1 and [[Pr2(CA),(C,H,0H),] . 2C,H,0H,\,,1yh1 in which CA'- has a delocalized electron system. Therefore the environment of the Cu" ion consists of four short in-plane bonds and two longer out-of-plane bonds, giving rise to a distorted tetragonal "4 + 2" configuration. The ESR spectrum consists of three signals (g values 2.304, 2.082, and 2.068) indicating that magnetic orbital is formed mainly by the d,, orbital. No hyperfine structure was ob- served; however, the linewidth appeared to be extremely nar- row. which suggests significant exchange coupling. The magnetic susceptibilities xlr, were measured over temperatures of 2-300 K. x,,T decreases at lower temperatures, indicative of weak aniiferromagnetic exchange coupling leading to a singlet ground state. The data were analyzed by using the Heisenberg linear chain theory with a mean field approxi~nation['~' to give J = - 2.86 c1n-l. 9' = - 1.05 cm- '. g = 2.09. and p = 7.12%.1'41 The absolute values of the exchange coupling con- stants are smaller than that for [Cu(CA)],. which has a planar ribbon structure (- 24.5 cm- I ) , and are comparable to that for [CU(CA)L,].[~~] which suggests that the magnetic orbital d,, of 1 is no longer simply parallel to chloranilate plane but a plane formed by Cu-N(pz) and Cu-O(CA) vectors. The absolute values of J and ZJ' are also smaller than those for pz-bridged coordination These differences in the exchange parameters are attributed to the interaction of the magnetic orbital and pyrazine n: orbital. which i s greatly associated with the twist angle 0 of the pz ring. The 0 angles for [C~(pz)~(C10,)~],~ and [Cu(pz),(CH,SO,),I, are 66.1 ( J = - 5.3 cm-'), and 28.5' ( J = - 3.82 cm-I), respectively,[tOe.'l while in 1 the pz ring is tilted by 14.7,. Thus the smaller twist angle of 1 makes antiferromagnetic interaction smaller. The hydrogen-bond donor CH,OH also served as the woof in the synthesis of a woven polymer.[71~"'~ ''I Single crystals of 2 also afford the 2D layers in which the straight 1D [Cu(CA)(CH,OH),] chains are linked by two hydrogen bonds (0. . .O distance: 2.845(3) A) between the apically coordinated CH,OH ligdnd and the oxygen atom of CA2- in the nearest neighbor chain (Fig. 2).["] A similar hydrogen bond is also found between oxygen atoms of aqua ligands and Et2DHBQ2- in {[Ca(Et2DHBQ),] . 3 H,O),, where the corrugated chains are linked by hydrogen bonds (3.094(7) A) longer than those in 2.[711 The repeating unit of Cu(CA)(CH,OH), develops along the ac plane. The geometry around the copper atom is a distorted elongated octahedron. The four chloranilate oxygen and the copper atoms form a basal plane. because the C u - 0 distances are shorter than the two apical Cu-O(CH,OH) distances, which results in the Cu-CA-Cu distance (7.672(1) A) being shorter than that of 1 by about 0.3 A. Therefore the magnetic orbital in 2 lies on the basal plane. in contrast to 1. The inter- chain hydrogen bonds lead to short nearest neighbor Cu-Cu distances (5.108(1) A). and the geometry of the 2D sheet can be regarded as a rectangular array of copper atoms. Complexes 1 and 2 are good examples of lattice structures formed by coordination andjor hydrogen bonds. The fabrica- tion of 2D polymers from warp and woof components has been shown to be quite useful in the construction of tetragonal cop- per lattices. This concept can also be applied to a wide variety of compounds having square lattices. U Fig. 2. Crystal structure of 2: vicw onto the (I( plane.

Dendritic Macromolecules Incorporating Tetrathiafulvalene Units"" Martin R. Bryce," Wayne Devonport, and Adrian J. Moore A burgeoning topic at the interface of supramolecular and polymer chemistry is the synthesis and characterization of den- dritic macromolecules (also termed "starburst polymers" or "cascade molecules").1' - 21 These macromolecules comprise a polyfunctional core surrounded by covalently linked layers of monomers, with a branch occurring at each monomer unit. This structure gives rise to a hyperbranched polymer possessing a high level of three-dimensional order; control over molecular weight, topology, interior cavity size. and surface functionality can be achieved. Current interest in these materials stems from the fundamental synthetic challenges they pose and the range of properties they may display. such as, self-assembly, molecular recognition, and catalysis, and their potential applications in molecular electronic devices. The incorporation of redox-active molecular units into a dendrimer structure is essentially unex- plored. In this context, organometallic systems with arene- iron" '1 and ruthenium - terpyridine monomers[' ' I elaborated into dendrimer structures have recently been reported, and den- dritic polyradicals have been prepared.["] We now describe the first examples of dendritic macro- molecules that contain redox-active tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) units. The incorporation of TTF into hyperbranched structures presents a fxcinating prospect for the following reasons:"31 1) oxidation of TTF to the cation radical and dication species occurs sequentially and reversibly at relatively low potentials (for unsubstituted TTF, = + 0.34 and + 0.74 V. vs. Agi AgCl): 2) the oxidation potentials can be finely tuned by the attachment of appropriate substituents; 3) the TTF cation rad- ical is thermodynamically very stable; and 4) oxidized TTF units are key components of molecular conductors. because of their propensity to form highly-ordered stacks. The starting TTF monomer unit for the present synthesis is 4-(hydroxymethyl)tetrathiafulvalene ( I ) By a convergent synthetic strategy based on a repetitive coupling/deprotection sequence, we have assembled the symmetrical dendrimer 12 which contains 12 TTF units at the periphery of the macro- molecule. The key functionalized reagent for the esterification reactions that build up successive generations is 5-(lert- butyldimethylsiloxy)isophthaloyl chloride (4) .I' 51 In an initial model experiment we established that TTF derivative 1 could be readily esterified by reaction with 1.3,5-benzenetricarbonyl chloride (2) to yield the tris(TTF) derivative 3 in 83 YO yield. The analogous reaction of 1 with the silyl-protected diacid dichloride 4 gave compound 5 (92 YO yield), deprotection of which gave the dendrimer arm 6 (85% yield) (Scheme 1). Reaction of compound 6 with triacid trichloride 2 in the pres- ence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as base gave the hexa- kis(TTF) dendrimer 7 (75 YO yield). No reaction occurred when triethylamine was used instead of DMAP. Following the same procedure, reaction of 6 with reagent 4 yielded compound 8 (85 % yield), which was desilylated to give the phenol derivative 9 (95 YO yield).
