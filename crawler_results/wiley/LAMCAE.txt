Manuscript FULL PAPER One-Dimensional Chains Formed by First-Row Transition Metal(II) Nitrates and Pyrimidine – Influence of Water Coordination on Structural Reliability Sarah A. Barnett,[a] Neil R. Champness,*[a] and Claire Wilson[a] Keywords: Coordination frameworks / Coordination polymer / Crystal structure / Metal nitrates / Pyrimidine An isostructural family of one-dimensional coordination poly- mers, [M(NO3)2(pym)(H2O)2] [M = Mn (1), Co (2), Ni (3), Zn (4); pym = pyrimidine], has been prepared and their phase purity assessed. It is shown that in contrast to other M(NO3)2–pyrimidine coordination polymers, 1–4 show a sur- prising preference for the structure reported herein rather the wide variety of other possible product architectures. It is also shown that a related complex [Ni(NO3)2(pym)(MeCN)2] Introduction The construction of coordination frameworks is an ex- tremely topical area of inorganic and materials chemistry.[1] The strong interest in this area arises because the synthetic procedure used to construct these materials allows, in prin- ciple, a high degree of design. New materials with tuneable properties have been developed from coordination frame- works over recent years and as synthetic procedures become more advanced so the properties of these materials become more highly evolved.[1] The targeted synthesis of coordina- tion polymers requires an appreciation of not only the vari- ety of possible coordination framework materials that can be prepared, but also an appreciation of which structures are more favourable. An assessment of phase purity of coor- dination polymers is both valuable from the point of view of material properties, but also gives insight into the struc- tural reliability[2] of a given set of starting building-blocks. We,[3,4] amongst others,[5] have been interested in the use of M(NO3)2 species as building blocks in coordination poly- mer construction due to their structural diversity that gives rise to a variety of fascinating coordination framework architectures. We have previously commented on the lack of structural reliability of M(NO3)2 as a coordination polymer node, and in general they can be viewed as structurally un- reliable due to the large number of metal nodes that are generated from such species, but also because of the variety of coordination frameworks that can be generated even when the same M(NO3)2 node configuration is adopted.[2,3] [a] School of Chemistry, The University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham NG7 2RD, U.

However, 5 is highly hygroscopic and readily converts to 3 in the presence of at- mospheric water. The implication of the uniformity of struc- ture is discussed in relation to the serendipitous coordination of water molecules to the metal centres. (© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2005) Herein, we report a family of isostructural one-dimen- sional coordination polymers, [M(NO3)2(pym)(H2O)2] [M = Mn (1), Co (2), Ni (3), Zn (4)], which interestingly form a single phase under the conditions of synthesis used. The serendipitous coordination of water molecules to the metal centres leads to the formation of a hydrogen-bonded array that may contribute to the favourable formation of the ob- served product. Results and Discussion Reaction of M(NO3)2·xH2O salts [M = Mn (1), Co (2), Ni (3), Zn (4)] dissolved in either MeCN or iPrOH with a solution of pyrimidine (pym) in CH2Cl2 leads to the forma- tion of insoluble precipitates which are found to have the stoichiometry [M(NO3)2(pym)(H2O)2] by elemental analy- sis. In the case of Ni(NO3)2 with pym in CH2Cl2/MeCN an alternative product [Ni(NO3)2(pym)(MeCN)2] (5) can also be isolated but readily undergoes conversion to 3 in the presence of atmospheric moisture. Single crystals were grown by slow diffusion of the layered solutions of the me- tal salt and pyrimidine in their respective solvents. Structural characterisation of 1–4 by single-crystal X-ray diffraction showed the formation of one-dimensional coordi- nation polymers with the formula [M(NO3)2(pym)(H2O)2]. All four compounds are isostructural and crystallize in the space groups I2/a [non-standard setting of C2/c (no. 15)]. Each MII centre is pseudo-octahedral and coordinated by two pyrimidine ligands, two η1-nitrate anions and two water molecules (Figure 1; Table 1). The bridging nature of the pyr- imidine ligand results in the formation of a one-dimensional zigzag chain, which is achiral, and runs parallel to the c axis (Figure 2).

Two crystallographically distinct types of OH···O(NO3) hydrogen bonds are ob- served (Table 2); one type links [M(NO3)2(pym)(H2O)2] chains parallel to the a axis and the second links chains in the direction of the b axis. Thus, the hydrogen-bonding interactions form an undulating two-dimensional hydrogen- bonded sheet parallel to the ab plane. Each metal node is connected to six adjacent nodes within the sheet using a total of eight hydrogen bonds, utilising all four water hydro- gen atoms (two for each H2O), and both coordinated NO3– anions participating in two hydrogen bonds each. These hy- drogen-bonded sheets are then crosslinked by the pyrimi- dine ligands into a three-dimensional network of 36.418.53.6 topology (Figure 4). Figure 3.

A single-crystal diffraction study of 5 revealed a highly related structure to that observed in 1–4. Thus, each NiII centre is pseudo-octahedral and coordinated by two pyrimi- dine ligands, two η1-nitrate anions and two MeCN mole- cules replacing the water ligands present in 1–4 (Figure 5; Table 1).

Mn cross hatch; N dotted; O left hatch. hydrogen bonds are observed and therefore the extended structure observed in 1–4 is not present in 5. In order that phase purity of these products could be assessed, bulk samples of 1–4 were prepared. This is par- ticularly important in the case of metal(ii) nitrate bridging N-donor coordination polymers due to the wide variations previously observed in the products of such compounds.[3] Powders were prepared initially by L/M starting ratios of 1:1 in either an MeCN/CH2Cl2 (1, 2, 4) or an iPrOH/ CH2Cl2 (3) solvent mixture. On comparing the results of X- ray powder diffraction with the calculated powder diffrac- tion patterns using the single-crystal X-ray data, all the samples were confirmed to be pure single phases of the re- spective complexes (see Figure 6 for example). The reaction of Ni(NO3)2 with pym in MeCN/CH2Cl2 affords crystals of both 3 and 5. Indeed isolation of samples that contain 5 is difficult as this species proves to be highly hygroscopic, rapidly taking up atmospheric moisture and converting to 3.

One-Dimensional Chains Formed by First-Row Transition Metal(ii) Nitrates and Pyrimidine FULL PAPER products were unsuccessful with only identification of pure samples of 3. The structure of 1–4 observed here has been previously observed in the products of the reactions of other transition metal salts with pyrimidine. Indeed, compounds iso- structural with 1–4 have previously been observed for [Cu(NO3)2(pym)(H2O)2][6] and [Cd(NO3)2(pym)(H2O)2].[7] However, it is worth noting that in the case of Cu(NO3)2 and Cd(NO3)2 other products with pyrimidine[8,9] are also observed indicating that these metal centres are perhaps less predictable in their behaviour than the transition metal salts reported here. The lack of structural predictability is not particular surprising for either Cu(NO3)2 or Cd(NO3)2 con- sidering the Jahn–Teller distortion expected for CuII and the highly malleable coordination sphere of CdII.[2,3] In- deed, it is perhaps more surprising that such a uniform, isostructural family of compounds are observed for the sys- tem reported here. The uniformity of product clearly re- flects the greater stability of this product in comparison to other hypothetical competing structures, but also may be attributed, in part, to the coordination of water molecules to the metal centres in 1–4, which arises due to the use of hydrated M(NO3)2 starting reagents. The coordination of water molecules to the metal centres has two major effects on the resultant coordination polymer structure. Firstly, by occupying two of the coordination sites of the metal centre the number of pyrimidine ligands that can be coordinated and subsequently bridge metal centres is restricted leading to the formation of the one-dimensional chains that are ob- served. Secondly, the ability of water to act as a hydrogen- bond donor allows the formation of hydrogen-bonding in- teractions between adjacent chains undoubtedly strengthen- ing the formation of the observed structure. The relative stability of the structure observed in 1–4 is further indicated by the rapid conversion of 5 to 3 by replacement of the MeCN ligands in 5 by water molecules. In summary, a family of one-dimensional coordination polymers has been prepared and their phase purity as- sessed. The implications of the uniformity of structure ob- served have been discussed, and it can be concluded that Table 3.

Experimental Section General: Infrared spectra were measured as KBr disks with a Nicolet Avatar 380 FT-IR spectrometer over the range 400– 4000 cm–1. Microanalyses were performed by the University of Nottingham Chemistry Department microanalytical service with a Perkin–Elmer 240B analyser. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXD) data were collected with a Philips XPERT θ-2θ dif- fractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. Samples were mounted on flat glass plate sample holders. Ca. 50-min scans were run for each sample to assess phase purity. Short scans were run over the range 5°  2θ  80° with step size 2θ = 0.02° and times per step of 0.65 s. The simulated powder pattern was generated using the PC software packages APD, part of the Philips software package and POWDERCELL,[10] taking the single-crystal struc- tural data for the compound as a model. For details see Support- ing information (see footnote on the first page of this article). All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals and used without further purification. All single-crystal X-ray experiments were performed with either a Bruker AXS SMART1000 CCD detector diffractometer (1–5) equipped with an Oxford Cryosys- tems open flow cryostat[11] [graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα ra- diation (λ = 0.71073 Å); ω scans] or with an Enraf–Nonius FAST TV Detector diffractometer [graphite-monochromated Mo- Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å)] (3). Absorption corrections were applied by a semi-empirical approach (1, 2, 4, 5). Other details of crystal data, data collection and processing are given in Table 3. CCDC-258503 (1), -258504 (2), -258505 (3), -258506 (4), -258507 (5) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. All of the single-crystal structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97[12] and all non-hydrogen atoms were located using subsequent differ- ence-Fourier methods.[13] In all cases, hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and thereafter allowed to ride on their parent atoms, except for water hydrogen atoms which were located from the difference Fourier map. The water hydrogen atoms were refined, with suitable O–H and H···H distance re- S. A. Barnett, N. R. Champness, C. Wilson FULL PAPER straints. During the refinement of the structure of 5 a region of poorly defined solvent was accounted for using SQUEEZE,[14] which calculated 87 electrons per unit cell, approximating to 4 molecules of MeCN (88 electrons) which were included in the formula. One oxygen atom and the nitrogen atom of the nitrate anion showed disorder and were modelled isotropically over two sites with occupancies 0.6 and 0.4. A large peak of residual electron density remained in a chemically nonsensical position. This may be due to some form of twinning, however, the original data all indexed cleanly using the assigned cell and application of various twin laws did not result in any improvement.
