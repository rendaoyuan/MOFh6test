Manuscript Topological Magnetic Isomers DOI: 10.1002/anie.201203309 Crystal-to-Crystal Transformation of Magnets Based on Heptacyanomolybdate(III) Involving Dramatic Changes in Coordination Mode and Ordering Temperature** Qing-Lun Wang, Heather Southerland, Jian-Rong Li, Andrey V. Prosvirin, Hanhua Zhao, and Kim R. Dunbar* Crystal-to-crystal transformation is an interesting phenom- enon with potential applications in molecular devices such as switches and sensors.[1] The structural changes typically involve minor movements of atoms in the crystal prompted by changes in metal coordination number, condensation reactions, rearrangement of bonds, or the removal or exchange of solvents.[1] It is challenging, however, to obtain high-quality crystals after solid-state transformations, espe- cially those involving the breaking and formation of chemical bonds.[2–5] Some rare examples are single-crystal transforma- tions of coordination polymers that change their dimension- ality, such as 1D to 2D, 1D to 3D, and 2D to 3D.[3] as well as 0D compounds to 1D and 2D coordination polymers.[4] Although various crystal-to-crystal transformations have been reported in recent years, very few examples involve drastic changes in the magnetic properties.[4a,5] In the course of our research into the properties of the heptacyanomolybdate(III) anion we isolated the 3D material {[Mn(dpop)]3[Mn(dpop)(H2O)][Mo(CN)7]2·13.5H2O}n (1; dpop = 2,13-dimethyl-3,6,9,12,18-pentaazabicyclo[12.3.1]- octadeca-1(18),2,12,14,16-pentaene), which undergoes a re- markable single-crystal to single-crystal transformation to afford {[Mn(dpop)]2[Mo(CN)7]·2H2O}n (2) by partial loss of solvent molecules with concomitant rearrangement of the binding mode of the heptacyanomolybdate linker. The alterations in the structure results in dramatic changes in the coercive field and ordering temperature of the magnet. Compound 1 was prepared by slow diffusion of solutions of K4[MoIII(CN)7] and [MnII(dpop)]Cl2 in the dark under a nitrogen atmosphere; the related phase, 2, was prepared by subjecting crystals of 1 to a dynamic vacuum at 1258C for 8 h and further pumping using the “outgas” function of a gas adsorption analyzer for 5 h at 1508C. Crystals of 1 belong to the rhombohedral space group R3. The crystallographically independent unit consists of a {[MnIII- (dpop)]3[MnII(dpop)(H2O)][Mo(CN)7]2} fragment (Fig- ure 1a) and interstitial water molecules. It can be seen from the asymmetric unit that both the MoIII and MnII ions are heptacoordinate with slightly distorted pentagonal bipyrami- dal geometries. There are two types of MnII ions in the structure: the Mn1 center is surrounded by five nitrogen atoms of the macrocyclic dpop ligand in the equatorial positions as well as one bridging CN ion from the [Mo(CN)7]4 ion and one H2O molecule in the axial positions. This unit acts as a terminal capping group. In contrast, the Mn2, Mn3, and Mn4 centers are all bridged by two CN groups in the axial positions and function as m-CN bridging units. The MnN bond distances range from 2.21 to 2.35 , which are very close to the literature values for other Figure 1. a) The basic structural unit {[Mn(dpop)]3[Mn(dpop)(H2O)] [Mo(CN)7]2} in 1 (H atoms are omitted for clarity). b) The 3D architecture of 1 viewed along the c direction. c) The basic structural unit {[Mn(dpop)]2[Mo(CN)7]} in 2 (H atoms are omitted for clarity). d) The 3D architecture of 2 viewed along the c direction. e) Crystal-to- crystal transformation from 1 to 2.

KGaA, Weinheim [Mn(dpop)]2+ species.[6] Among the [Mo(CN)7]4 units, Mo1 is connected to four [Mn(dpop)]2+ moieties, with two bridging CN ligands located in equatorial positions (N1, N4) and the other two in the axial sites (N2, N6). The Mo2 centers are connected to three [Mn(dpop)]2+ units, with two bridging CN groups in the equatorial positions (N8, N12) and one in an axial postion (N10). The MoC bond lengths range from 2.07 to 2.19  and the MoCN bond angles are close to 1808 (174–1788). From a topological point of view, both Mo1 and Mo2 can be regarded as 3-connecting nodes and the [Mn(dpop)]2+ moiety as a bridge, with a [Mn(dpop)(H2O)]2+ unit acting as a terminal fragment. The result is a non-uniform net with the vertex symbol 6,102 and a Schlfli symbol 6.102.102 (depicted schematically in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information; the topological analysis was performed with the TOPOS program package).[7] Thus, complex 1 has a highly ordered 3D frame- work architecture with 1D tubular channels of approximately 15  diameter (Figure 1b). The channels are directed along the c axis and are filled with H2O guest molecules. The crystallographically independent unit of compound 2 is composed of a {[Mn(dpop)]2[Mo(CN)7]2} fragment and two water molecules. As shown in Figure 1c, there is only one type of MnII ion in the asymmetric unit; although they are crystallographically independent, the Mn1 and Mn2 centers from the [Mn(dpop)]2+ units both act as m-CN bridging units and, in contrast to compound 1, there is no terminal [Mn- (dpop)(H2O)]2+ group. The Mo1 center is connected to four [Mn(dpop)]2+ entities, with two bridging CN ligands located in equatorial positions (N3 and N7) and two in the axial positions (N1, N5). From a topological point of view, Mo1 is a 4-connecting node, with the [Mn(dpop)]2+ moiety acting as a bridge, thereby resulting in a non-uniform topological net with the vertex symbol 64,82 and Schlfli symbol 62.62.62.62.82.82 (shown schematically in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).[7] The result is a highly ordered 3D framework structure with 1D tubular channels of approx- imately 10  diameter (Figure 1d). The channels are directed along the c axis and are filled with H2O guest molecules which are hydrogen bonded to the nitrogen atom of the [Mo(CN)7]4 unit (O1···N4A 2.945 ; O2···N2B 2.887 ). The major difference between 1 and 2 in regard to the network structure is that 1 contains a water-capped {Mn- (dpop)} unit (Mn1) which is dehydrated and bridged by a cyanide group from the adjacent [Mo(CN)7]4 moiety (Mo2; Figure 1e). As a result, the number of pathways of exchange interactions increases, which dramatically alters the magnetic properties (see below). Magnetic data for the two new compounds were collected over the temperature range 2–300 K. Plots of cM 1 and cMT versus t for 1 are shown in Figure 2, where cM is the molar magnetic susceptibility per Mo2 IIIMn4 II unit. The value of cMT at 300 K is 18.15 cm3Kmol1, which is very close to the spin- only value of 18.25 cm3Kmol1 for four uncoupled high-spin MnII (S = 5/2) ions and two MoIII (S = 1/2) ions if one assumes g = 2.0. When the temperature is lowered, the cMT value decreases smoothly from room temperature to 95 K and reaches a minimum value of 17.8 cm3Kmol1. Below 95 K, the cMT value rapidly increases to reach a maximum value of 48.9 cm3Kmol1 at 5.0 K, then decreases rapidly to a value of 40.2 cm3Kmol1 at 2 K. A fitting of the data above 95 K to the Curie–Weiss law gives q = 2.5 K, but, because of the complicated structure of complex 1, it is not possible to evaluate the coupling constant between the MnII and MoIII ions. The negative q value and the decrease in the cMT value below 95 K both suggest that an antiferromagnetic coupling is operative between the MnII and MoIII spin centers, a conclu- sion that is consistent with results of neutron diffraction studies on Mn2+[Mo(CN)7]4 compounds.[8] The antiferro- magnetic interaction is also reflected by the magnetization data, which saturate at 2.0 K (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) to a value of 18.20 mB at 70 kOe. This value is in good agreement with the expected value of S = 18/2 per Mo2 IIIMn4 II unit (18.00 mB). Figure 3 depicts a plot of the zero-field-cooled magnet- ization and field-cooled magnetization data at a field of 10 Oe. This plot shows a bifurcation of the data below 2.6 K, thus indicating the occurrence of long-range ordering below this temperature.[9] The field-cooled magnetization exhibits a plateau below this temperature, which is typical of a complete freezing process. Isothermal magnetization experiments performed at 1.8 K exhibit a hysteresis with a small coercive field of 90 Oe and a remnant magnetization of 0.26 NmB, typical of soft magnet behavior. Long-range ordering was also confirmed by ac suscepti- bility data measured at different frequencies in the range 1– 1339 Hz in a zero applied dc field (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The in-phase cM’ and out-of-phase components cM’’ both display maxima, clearly indicating the Figure 2.

A very small frequency dependence of the AC data was observed, with shifts in cM’ from 2.8 to 3.3 K at frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 1339 Hz. The shift parameter g = (DTp/Tp)/D(logf) (f = ac frequency) is approximately 0.052, which is close to a typical value for a spin-glass behavior. A more appropriate term for magnetically concentrated molecule-based magnets is a glassy magnet, which is a metastable state of frozen spins that does not undergo a true three-dimensional ordering. Nevertheless, these materials undergo a spontaneous magnetization and exhibit coercivity which classify them as magnets. Similar behavior has been observed in other magnetically ordered systems.[10] Compound 2 exhibits a cMT value at 300 K of 9.02 cm3Kmol1, which is slightly lower than the spin-only value of 9.13 cm3Kmol1 for two uncoupled high-spin MnII (S = 5/2) ions and one MoIII (S = 1/2) ion (cM here is the molar magnetic susceptibility per MoIIIMnII 2 unit). When the temperature is lowered, the cMT value decreases slightly from room temperature to 130 K and reaches a minimum value of 8.48 cm3Kmol1. Below 130 K, the cMT value first increases steadily to 25 K and then increases abruptly to reach 204.3 cm3Kmol1 at 16 K before finally decreasing rapidly to a value of 46.1 cm3Kmol1 at 2 K. A fitting of the data above 130 K to the Curie–Weiss law gives q = 16.0 K, which is an indication of strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the MnII and MoIII ions. The antiferromagnetic coupling was further confirmed by the magnetization data at 2 K (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information), which show a steady increase to a near saturation value of 8.35 mB at 70 kOe, close to the expected value of S = 9/2 per MoIIIMnII 2 unit (9.0 mB). As shown in Figure 4, the zero-field-cooled magnetization and field-cooled magnetization data at a 10 Oe indicate long- range ordering occurs for 2 with a critical temperature (TC) of 24 K.[9] Magnetization data at 1.8 K exhibit hysteresis with a much larger coercive field of 305 Oe than that observed for 1, as well as a remnant magnetization of 3.6 NmB, typical of a harder magnet. The magnetic ordering was confirmed by the ac data measured at different frequencies in a zero applied dc field. The in-phase and out-of-phase components exhibit maxima typical of 3D ordering (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information), albeit with a small frequency dependence of the peaks Tp in the cM’ and cM’’ data (the shifts in cM’ from 20 to 22 K are from 1 Hz to 1339 Hz and the parameter g = (DTp/Tp)/D(logf) is approximately 0.30), which means that complex 2 is similar to 1 in terms of glassy magnet behavior. In summary, two nearly identical compositions of 3D crystalline materials based on [Mo(CN)7]4 and [Mn(dpop)]2+ have been prepared, with one phase, compound 2, being generated from crystals of 1 by a dehydration process that involves a surprising crystal-to-crystal transformation with major rearrangements of the connectivity of the two building blocks in the structure. Magnetic measurements indicate that 1 is a typical soft magnet, whereas 2 displays a large coercive field and remnant magnetization. To our knowledge, such a drastic change in architecture and magnetic properties Figure 3.

KGaA, Weinheim www.angewandte.org triggered only by loss of water molecules and without compromising the integrity of the single crystals is without precedent. Such a discovery provides a rare opportunity for probing subtle structural factors that affect magnetic proper- ties in related solids and is specifically important for testing models of binding modes and anisotropy in compounds based on the pentagonal bipyramidal heptacyanomolybdate(III) anion, a topic of high interest in magnetism research on cyanide compounds. Experimental Section All experiments were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Dark red needlelike crystals of 1 were obtained after a week by diffusion of solutions of [Mn(dpop)]Cl2·4H2O[6a] (125 mg in 3 mL CH3OH on the top), a CH3OH/H2O (1:1) mixture (16 mL, as a buffer in the middle), and K4[Mo(CN)7]·2H2O[11] (60 mg in 3 mL H2O at the bottom). Compound 2 was prepared by pumping on single-crystal samples of 1 under a dynamic vacuum at 1258C for 8 h followed by further pumping for 5 h at 1508C using the “outgas” function of a gas adsorption analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis was used to estimate the number of crystallized water molecules in 1 (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information; 10.72% weight loss, which is ca. 13.5H2O molecules per Mo2 IIIMn4 II unit).
