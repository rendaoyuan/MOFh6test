In general, this class of complexes contains two central components, inorganic units (single metal atoms or metal clusters), and organic ligands. The versatility of organic ligands and the diversity of inorganic units have led to a wide array of functions of coordination polymers. One of the common phenomena related to the entanglement is the presence of a number of individual nets participating in interpenetration with each other, which evi- dently differs from the self-penetration networks (molecule knots) in a strict sense [3]. Recently, a series of systematic studies on this subject have demonstrated that an interpen- etrated array cannot prevent porosity, but enhances the po- rous functionalities of the supramolecular frameworks [4]. More importantly, the research upsurge in the interpen- etration structure was promoted by the fact that interpen- etrated nets have been considered as potential super-hard materials [5] and possess peculiar magnetic and electrical properties [6]. The recent introduction of polynuclear clus- ters into the coordination polymers has increased the range of their possible applications as functional materials. Many transition-metal clusters with very high ground-state spins, such as manganese, iron, cobalt, and nickel clusters can be * Prof. Dr. Guang-Xiang Liu Provincial Key Laboratory of Functional Coordination Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Anqing Normal University Anqing 246003 / P.

The magnetic be- havior for 1 was studied in the temperature range of 1.8-300 K. Keywords: Carboxylate ligand; Heterometallic complex; α-Po; Magnetic Property used as magnetic building units to construct multi-func- tional coordination polymers combining magnetism with porosity [7]. Such materials will have enormous interest in the near future as their use as magnetic sensor, catalysis and biological system. Herein, we present the synthesis, struc- ture and magnetic properties of a new heterometallic coor- dination polymers, ZnCo(OH)(pheno)(p-BDC)1.5·H2O (1). Experimental Section Materials and Measurements All commercially available chemicals are of reagent grade and used as received without further purification. Solvents were purified by standard methods prior to use. Elemental analysis of C, H and N were carried on a Perkin-Elmer 240C Elemental Analyzer at the Analysis Center of Nanjing University. A Bruker FS66V FT IR Spectrophotometer was used, and the measurements were made by the KBr disc method. Magnetic susceptibility data on polycrystal- line sample were collected over the temperature range of 1.8300 K using a MPMS7 magnetometer (Quantum Design) in an external field of 2000 Oe, the diamagnetism was corrected by Pascal constants [8]. Preparation of complex ZnCo(OH)(pheno)(p-BDC)1.5·H2O (1) A mixture containing Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.10 mmol), Co(NO3)2· 6H2O (0.10 mmol), H2BDC (0.20 mmol), pheno (0.10 mmol) and NaOH (0.20 mmol) in water (10 ml) was sealed in a 18 ml Teflon lined stainless steel container and heated at 150 °C for 72 h. Purple block crystals of 1 were washed by deionized water several times and collected by filtration with a field of 73 %. Anal. Calcd. for C24H15N2O10CoZn: C, 46.82; H, 2.46; N, 4.55 %.

Xu, X.-M. Ren Crystallographic measurements The crystallographic data collections for complex 1 were carried out on a Bruker Smart Apex II CCD with graphite-monochrom- ated Mo-Kα radiation (λ  0.71073 A˚ ) at 293(2) K using the ω- scan technique. The data were integrated by using the SAINT pro- gram [9], which also did the intensities corrected for Lorentz and polarization effect. An empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program [10]. The structures were solved by direct methods using the program SHELXS-97 and all non-hydro- gen atoms were refined anisotropically on F2 by the full-matrix le- ast-squares technique using the SHELXL-97 crystallographic software package [11, 12]. The hydrogen atoms were generated geo- metrically. All calculations were performed on a personal computer with the SHELXL-97 crystallographic software package [12].

Results and Discussion Crystal Structure Description The X-ray diffraction study for 1 reveals that it crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbca and features a 2-fold parallel interpenetrated 3D3D network motif. The asymmetric unit contains one CoII atom, one ZnII atom (the Co:Zn ratio of 1:1 based on ICP analysis), one hydroxyl, one pheno ligand, one and half of p-BDC mol- ecule and one solvent water molecule. Selected bond lengths Figure 1 ORTEP representation of complex 1 (the H atoms have been omitted for the sake of clarity). The thermal ellipsoids are drawn at 30 % probability. for 1 are listed in Table 2. As shown in Figure 1, two nitro- gen atoms (N1 and N2) belonging to pheno, one p-BDC oxygen atom (O3A) and one hydroxyl oxygen atom (O9A)are ligated to the Co atom in the equatorial plane, with another oxygen atom (O9) arising from the second hy- droxyl group and one oxygen atom (O5) arising from the second p-BDC molecule situated in the axial position. Each CoII atom approximately lies in the equatorial position with a maximum deviation (0.056 A˚ ) from the basal plane. In the structure, Co-O and Co-N bond distances are in the range of 2.0540(17)2.1089(16) and 2.148(2)2.171(2) A˚ , respectively. Each Zn ion in the center of a tetrahedral ge- ometry is surrounded by three carboxylic oxygen atoms (Zn-O  1.9159(17)1.9734(16) A˚ ) from three p-BDC li- gands and one μ3-OH oxygen atom (O9) with the Zn-O distance of 1.9536(16) A˚ .

Zn tetrahedron; Co octahedron. Figure 3 Polyhedral presentation of one set of the 3D network along a-axis (a) and b-axis (b). There exist two types of p-BDC found in 1 (see Scheme 1), namely, monobidentate bridging (μ3) and bi-bi- dentate bridging (μ4) coordination modes. The bidentate bridging p-BDC connect mixed metals (the smallest Co···Zn  3.160 A˚ ) to complete a heterodinuclear cluster, which is further linked by μ3-OH into a six-connected- heterotetranuclear cluster that is jointly coordinated by six p-BDC molecules (Figure 2). The two Co atom is bound by two μ3-OH with the distance of 3.208 A˚ . The clusters are further extended by p-BDC into a single 3D framework (Figure 3). For clarity, we use the topological method to analyze this 3D framework: the six-connected SBU is viewed to be six-connected node; furthermore, based on the consideration of geometry of this node, this 3D frame is classified to be an α-Po net with 41263 topology (Figure 4). Of particular interest, the most striking feature of complex 1 is that a pair of identical 3D single nets is interlocked with each other, thus directly leading to the formation of a 2-fold interpenetrated 3D  3D structure (Figure 4) and the two pcu (α-Po) frameworks are related by screw axis 21 [13]. Recently, a complete analysis of the 3D coordination Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 2008, 927930 © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In addition, several noninterpenetration motifs with α-Po topology have been reported to date [16]. Magnetic properties of complex 1 The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility χM for the powder sample of 1 was investigated in the 1.8-300 K range in a 2000 Oe field (Figure 5). Above 50 K, the magnetic susceptibility follows Curie-Weiss law with C  4.35 emu mol1 K and θ  20.8 K. The Curie constant is signifi- cantly higher than the expected spin-only value of two iso- lated high-spin CoII ions (3.75 emu mol1 K), in accord- ance with the well-documented orbital contribution of octa- hedral CoII ions. The negative Weiss constant and the de- crease of χMT indicate an overall strong antiferromagnetic interaction and/or spin-orbital coupling between the CoII ions. The more remarkable decrease from 1.25 emu mol1 K at 10 K to 0.86 emu mol1 K at 5 K may be caused by the zerofield splitting of the ground state of the cluster, which is typically large for complexes containing high-spin six coordinate CoII ions [8, 17]. Because the tetra- Figure 5 Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility in the forms of χM-T and χMT-T for 1. G.-X. Liu, H. Xu, X.-M. Ren nuclear clusters are quite well isolated by large p-BDC and pheno ligands, the magnetic behavior is interpreted as being due to antiferromagnetic coupling within the binuclear co- balt(II) clusters.
