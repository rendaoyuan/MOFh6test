The first is the synthesis of a second-order NLO chromophore possessing a large hyperpolarizability (β) and the second involves the assembly of these molecular building blocks into a noncentrosymmetric bulk structure with a suitable orientation of the β tensor components. Whereas the first level of molecular synthesis has been widely explored, both theoretically and experimentally,[3] the organization of these chromophores into optimal lattice structures with the desired molecular orientations is still a difficult problem. It is well known that metal phosphonates are useful for organizing molecules into lamellar structures in which the metal ions are bridged by the phosphonate moieties to form an inorganic layer; the remaining organic group of the phosphonate generally dangles in the interlayer region.[4] Based on this prominent characteristic, metal phosphonates [a] College of Chemistry and Life Science, Gannan Normal Uni- versity, Ganzhou, 341000, P.

The acentric stacking of such layers results in their crystallization in the noncentro- symmetric Cc space group, and both compounds show sec- ond harmonic generation responses comparable to that of KDP (KH2PO4). (especially zirconium phosphonates) have been widely used for the assembly of second-order NLO chromophores into noncentrosymmetric multilayer films.[5] Inspired by this “layer-by-layer” approach, we deem that a similar strategy is also realizable through the crystal engineering technique, i.e., the growing of noncentrosymmetric layered metal phos- phonates with second-harmonic-generation-(SHG)-active chromophores oriented in the interlayer region, as depicted in Scheme 1. Although a few SHG-active metal phos- phonate crystals have been isolated,[6,7] to date the orienta- tion of the SHG-active chromophores attached on layered metal phosphonate crystals has not been reported. Scheme 1. Orientation of SHG active chromophores on layered metal phosphonate. In this context, we use a ligand in which a phosphonate moiety is directly combined with a SHG-active phenylsulfo- nyl chromophore, i.e., Ph–SO2–CH2–PO3H2 (H2L), as a building block to address the above issue. Our research ef- forts yielded two such layered lead(II) phosphonates with the formula [Pb3(L)2X2(H2O)] [X = Cl (1) and Br (2)]. Herein, we report their syntheses, X-ray structures, and sec- ond-order NLO properties. Z.-Y. Du, Y.-H. Sun, X. Xu, G.-H. Xu, Y.-R. Xie FULL PAPER Results and Discussion Synthesis The preparation of compounds 1 and 2 relies on the well- established hydrothermal method using diethyl phos- phonate as starting material. During the course of the hy- drothermal treatment, the high temperature and high pres- sure aid the hydrolysis of the phosphonic ester to produce phosphonic acid in situ (Scheme 2). It is believed that the slow, in situ formation of phosphonic acid facilitates the growth of single crystals.[8] It was also observed that the addition of a small amount of acid to the aqueous solution helped improve the crystalline quality of the two com- pounds. Scheme 2. The in situ hydrolysis of the diethylphosphonate ester. Crystal Structure Description Compounds 1 and 2 are isostructural, hence only the structure of 1 will be discussed in detail. Compound 1 crys- tallizes in the monoclinic Cc space group and features a novel 2D-layered structure. The asymmetric unit contains three unique Pb2+ ions with coordination numbers ranging from four to six (Figure 1), all of which featured a hemidi- rected geometry, using the terminology of Glusker et al.[9] The Pb1 ion is six-coordinate with four phosphonate O atoms from three L2– anions and two chloride anions, the Pb2 ion is five-coordinate with three phosphonate O atoms and one sulfone O atom from three L2– anions as well as one chloride anion, whereas the Pb3 ion is four-coordinate with two phosphonate O atoms from two L2– anions and one chloride anion as well as an aqua ligand. Their coordi- nation geometry can be described as a distorted ψ-PbO4Cl2 pentagonal bipyramid, a severely distorted ψ-PbO4Cl octa- hedron, and a severely distorted ψ-PbO3Cl trigonal bipyra- mid, respectively. Each ion has one site occupied by a lone electron pair. The Pb–O [2.286(8)–2.757(8) Å] and Pb–Cl [2.633(4)–3.080(4) Å] distances are comparable to those re- ported for other lead(II) phosphonates.[10] There are two unique L2– anions, two unique Cl– anions, and one unique H2O molecule serving as ligands in com- pound 1. As shown in Figure 1, the two L2– ligands in 1 adopt two types of coordination modes and can be written as [4.2121314130] (for the ligand containing the P1 and S1 atoms, denoated LA) and [4.2122131400] (for the ligand con- taining the P2 and S2 atoms, denoted LB) according to the Harris notation.[11] Both ligands have pentadentate coordi- nation and bridge three Pb2+ ions and chelate a fourth. There is, however, one bidentate and two monodentate phosphonate O atoms and one monodentate sulfone O www.eurjic.org © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Inorg.

The two chelating atoms in LA contain one monodentate phosphonate O atom and one monodentate sulfone O atom, whereas those in LB contain two bidentate phosphonate O atoms. The in- terconnection of the Pb2+ ions by the above two types of L2– ligands leads to the formation of a complicated 2D- layered structure; the spare coordination sites of the Pb2+ ions are filled by bidentate Cl– ligands and monodentate aqua ligands (Figure 2). Figure 2. View of the layered structure of 1 down the a axis. The CP1O3 and CP2O3 tetrahedra are shaded in light and medium grey, respectively. Phenyl groups of the L2– ligands have been omitted for clarity. The layered structure of 1 features a distinctive 1D {[Pb3(LB)Cl2(H2O)]2+}n cationic chain along the c axis, which contains a cyclic Pb4 unit with neighboring Pb4 units linked together in a corner-shared fashion. The intercon- Orientation of SHG-Active Phenylsulfonyl Chromophores nection of these 1D {[Pb3(LB)Cl2(H2O)]2+}n chains through the LA ligands constitutes the extended 2D-layered architec- ture along the bc-plane. Specifically, the phenylsulfonyl chromophores attached on the phosphonate ligands orient unilaterally on the 2D layer, and as such noncentrosym- metric 2D layers stack along the a axis by van der Waals forces with adjacent layers related only by translational symmetry along the b axis (Figure 3). Consequently, com- pound 1 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric Cc space group. Figure 3. View of the structure of 1 down the c axis. Compound 2 has a similar structure to 1. The main dif- ference being the Cl– ligands in 1 are replaced by Br– li- gands in 2. As a result, the unit cell volume of 2 [2610.19(8) Å3 is slightly larger than that of 1 [2532.62 (13) Å3], owing to the longer Pb–Br distances [2.7772(19)– 3.245(2) Å] in 2 compared with the Pb–Cl distances [2.633(4)–3.080(4) Å] in 1. Nonlinear Optical Properties In view of the fact that both compounds crystallize in a noncentrosymmetric space group (Cc), we investigated the SHG measurements[12] on sieved powdered samples of 1 and 2. The preliminary experimental results indicated that both 1 and 2 are NLO-active and exhibit SHG efficiencies of ≈1 and 2 times that of KDP, respectively. Furthermore, both compounds were found to be phase-matchable (Fig- ures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). The SHG efficiency can be mainly attributed to the orderly arrange- ment of the SHG-active phenylsulfonyl chromophores. In addition, the SHG efficiency of 2 is somewhat larger than that of 1, presumably because the electron-withdrawing ability of the chloride anion is stronger than that of the bromide.[13] Thermogravametric Analysis The Thermogravametric analysis (TGA) curve of 1 exhi- bits two main weight loss steps (Figure S3 in the Supporting Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2010, 4865–4869 © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjic.org 4867 Information). The first step, completed at 172 °C, corre- sponds to the release of one water molecule. The observed weight loss of 1.5% is equal to the calculated value. The second step started at 365 °C and ended at 440 °C and cor- responds to the decomposition of the ligands. The total weight loss at 750 °C is 30.3%; the final residues were not characterized. The TGA curve of 2 shows three main weight loss steps. The first step, as for 1, corresponds to the loss of water; the dehydrated material was then stable up to 365 °C. The second and the third steps, however, are over- lapping and weight loss continues until 750 °C, correspond- ing to the decomposition of the ligands. The total weight loss at 750 °C is 36.8%; the final residues were not charac- terized. Conclusion In summary, by the hydrothermal reaction of PbCl2 or PbBr2 with diethyl [(phenylsulfonyl)methyl]phosphonate, two lead(II) phosphonates [Pb3(Ph–SO2–CH2–PO3)2X2- (H2O)] [X = Cl (1) and Br (2)] were obtained. The two com- pounds are isostructural and exhibit a lamellar structure in which the phenylsulfonyl chromophores orient unilaterally on the inorganic layer of [Pb3(PO3)2X2(H2O)]. The present work serves as a nice example in which second-order NLO materials can be rationally designed based on layered metal phosphonates. Further research will be extended to investi- gate other second-order NLO materials based on layered metal phosphonates. Experimental Section Materials and Instrumentation: Diethyl [(phenylsulfonyl)methyl]- phosphonate (Ph–SO2–CH2–PO(OEt)2) was synthesized using a published procedure.[14] All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Elemen- tal analyses were performed on a German Elementary Vario EL III instrument. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 5700 spectrometer using KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400 cm–1. X- ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns (Cu-Kα) were collected on a Bruker Advance D8 θ–2θ diffractometer. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out on a Diamond TG/DTA 6000 unit at a heating rate of 15 °C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mea- surements of the powder frequency-doubling effects were carried out by the method of Kurtz and Perry.[12] Radiation of 1064 nm was generated by a Q-switched Nd: YAG solid-state laser was used as the fundamental frequency light. The crystal sample was ground and sieved into several distinct particle sizes (25–45, 45–53, 53–75, 75–105, 105–150, 150–210 µm for 1; 45–53, 53–75, 75–105, 105– 150, 150–210, 210–300 µm for 2). The samples of known particle sizes were packed into round glass boxes with a uniform diameter of 8.0 mm and then exposed to laser radiation. The second har- monic radiation generated by the randomly oriented microcrystals was detected by a photomultiplier tube and displayed on an oscillo- scope. Samples of KDP were prepared as reference materials in identical fashion to assume the SHG effect.

Single-Crystal Structure Determination: Data collection for com- pounds 1 and 2 was performed on a Smart ApexII CCD dif- fractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα ra- diation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Intensity data for both compounds were collected using φ and ω scans at 296 K. The data sets were cor- rected for Lorentz and polarization factors, as well as for absorp- tion by using the SADABS program.[15] Both structures were solved by the direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares fitting on F2 by SHELX-97.[16] All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. All hydrogen atoms were gener- ated geometrically and refined isotropically. The hydrogen atoms for the water molecules are not included in the refinements. It is worth noting that both compounds were analysed as a racemic crystal structure in the polar space group Cc, although the analysed crystals of both were found to be twinned by inversion, with the Flack parameter being 0.667(19) and 0.51(2), respectively.
