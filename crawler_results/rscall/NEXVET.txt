Manuscript Lattice-imposed geometry in metal–organic frameworks: lacunary Zn4O clusters in MOF-5 serve as tripodal chelating ligands for Ni2+† Carl K. Brozek and Mircea Dinca* Received 11th March 2012, Accepted 4th April 2012 DOI: 10.1039/c2sc20306e The inorganic clusters in metal–organic frameworks can be used to trap metal ions in coordination geometries that are difﬁcult to achieve in molecular chemistry. We illustrate this concept by using the well-known basic carboxylate clusters in Zn4O(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)3 (MOF-5) as tripodal chelating ligands that enforce an unusual pseudo-tetrahedral oxygen ligand ﬁeld around Ni2+. The new Ni-based MOF-5 analogue is characterized by porosity measurements and a suite of electronic structure spectroscopies. Classical ligand ﬁeld analysis of the Ni2+ ion isolated in MOF-5 classiﬁes the Zn3O(carboxylate)6 ‘‘tripodal ligand’’ as an unusual, stronger ﬁeld ligand than halides and other oxygen donor ligands. These results may inspire the widespread usage of MOFs as chelating ligands for stabilizing site-isolated metal ions in future reactivity and electronic structure studies. The ability to tune the electronic properties of a metal ion by changing its coordination environment is the cornerstone of transition-metal chemistry. The design of ligands that enforce desired geometries around metals is the typical approach towards this goal and has been the purview of a molecular science; such tunability in the solid state is rare. With an eye towards the latter, we sought to use the inorganic clusters in metal–organic frame- works (MOFs), a class of porous crystalline materials made from simple building blocks, as chelating ligands. Although coor- dinatively unsaturated metal ions with unusual geometries have been isolated in MOFs in the context of gas storage and sepa- ration or catalysis,1 the deliberate use of MOF nodes in coordi- nation chemistry remains virtually unexplored. As a proof-of- principle, we reconceived the secondary building unit (SBU) of the iconic Zn4O(BDC)3 (MOF-5, BDC ¼ 1,4-benzenedicarbox- ylate)2 as a tripodal ligand for metals that are typically incom- patible with tetrahedral oxygen ligand ﬁelds, such as Ni2+ (see Fig. 1). Normally, Ni2+ (d8) prefers octahedral coordination in oxygen ligand ﬁelds and assumes tetrahedral geometry only when trapped in condensed lattices such as ZnO,3 or when sur- rounded by bulky supporting ligands.4 By demonstrating that the Zn4O(carboxylate)6 SBU can be used as a designer chelating ligand we hope to inspire the use of these popular materials as platforms for unusual coordination chemistry. Our ﬁrst attempts to install Ni2+ ions inside MOF-5 were inspired by isolated reports of post-synthetic ion metathesis at MOF nodes.5 Complete metathesis of structural units is a powerful method to access rationally designed analogues of existing MOFs, as has recently also been demonstrated by organic ligand exchange.6 Accordingly, colourless crystals of MOF-5 were soaked in a saturated solution of Ni(NO3)2$6H2O and, to our satisfaction, turned yellow within a few days. To ensure maximal Ni2+ incorporation, soaking was continued for one year. The ensuing yellow crystals were washed repeatedly with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and CH2Cl2 without loss of colour until the solvents no longer showed UV-Vis absorption proﬁles characteristic of free Ni2+ ions. X-Ray diffraction and elemental analysis of these yellow crystals revealed a cubic lattice (a ¼ 25.838(2) A) nearly identical to that of MOF-5 and a Ni : Zn ratio of 1 : 3. Shorter soaking times engendered lower levels of Ni2+ substitution, and Ni : Zn ratios of 1 : 10 could be isolated after two weeks. Albeit slow, these results indicated that Fig. 1 Illustration of the Zn3O(carboxylate)6 SBU of MOF-5 as a tripodal support that enforces a tetrahedral oxygen ligand ﬁeld, akin to standard chelating ligands such as the tetra-amine on the right.

Indeed, heating mixtures of Zn(NO3)2$6H2O, Ni(NO3)2$6H2O and H2BDC in DMF afforded cubic yellow crystals whose diffraction pattern matched that of MOF-5. As expected for a kinetically controlled process, the Ni : Zn ratio in these samples depended on the relative concentrations of Ni(NO3)2$6H2O and Zn(NO3)2$6H2O, yet never exceeded 1 : 3 (Fig. S2, ESI†). In fact, increasing the Ni : Zn ratio in the reactant mixture above 6 : 1 led to selective formation of a yet unidentiﬁed crystalline green powder that did not match the X-ray diffraction pattern of any known Ni2+-BDC or Zn2+-BDC phases.7 The upper limit of the Ni2+ content was similar to what had previously been reported as a curiosity in Co2+-substituted MOF-5 materials.8 We herein provide a hypothesis for this surprising observation: the yellow colour of as-synthesized Ni2+-substituted MOF-5 is indicative of octahedral Ni2+. We surmise that accommodation of octahedral Ni2+ must distort the original Zn4O core and the MOF-5 lattice. Additional Ni2+ substitution into the ensuing NiZn3O cluster is prevented by a large kinetic barrier as it would exert debilitating strain on the lattice. The presence and identity of the two additional ligands that complete the coordination sphere of octahedral Ni2+ was conﬁrmed by thermogravimetric analysis, which showed that two DMF molecules per Ni centre are lost by heating the yellow crystals between 70 and 150 C (Fig. S3, ESI†). Zn4O(carboxylate)6 SBUs wherein one Zn2+ is hexa-coordinate and binds two DMF molecules have been reported,9 offering precedent for the formulation of Ni- substituted MOF-5 as (DMF)2xNixZn4xO(BDC)3 (0 < x < 1), ((DMF)2Ni-MOF-5).10 Remarkably, heating (DMF)2Ni-MOF-5 under vacuum afforded deep blue–purple crystals of NixZn4xO(BDC)3 (Ni- Fig. 2 Part of the crystal structure of NixZn4xO(BDC)3 (x ¼ 1).

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the asym- metric unit of Ni-MOF-5 contains a single metal site, indicating that Ni2+ substitutes Zn2+ inside the SBU of a structure otherwise identical to MOF-5. Functional similarity to MOF-5 was also established by porosity measurements: blue Ni-MOF-5 adsorbed 825 cm3 of N2/g at 1 atm and 77 K and exhibited a BET surface area of 3300(100) m2 g1, analogous to original MOF-5 (Fig. S9, ESI†).12 FT-IR analysis of Ni-MOF-5 conﬁrmed the absence of a C]O stretch at 1660 cm1 that would be expected if DMF were still coordinated to Ni2+ (Fig. S4, ESI†). In contrast to Be2+ and Co2+ analogues of MOF-5,13 Ni-MOF-5 is built from SBUs that do not have molecular analogues, highlighting the importance of the lattice in stabilizing otherwise inaccessible molecular species. Soaking basic zinc acetate crystals, Zn4O(O2C–CH3)6,14 in an anhydrous DMF solution of Ni(NO3)2$6H2O for up to three weeks led to the decomposition of the metal cluster, not the incorporation of Ni2+. Therefore, NiZn3O(carboxylate)6 clusters can only be stabilized in the MOF lattice. The pseudo-tetrahedral geometry around the Ni2+ and the homogeneity of Ni-MOF-5 was quantiﬁed by diffuse-reﬂectance UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy (blue trace in Fig. 3), and magnetic measurements (vide infra). Despite the slight deviation from tetrahedral geometry around Ni2+, Ni-MOF-5 exhibited a spec- trum that resembled solution-phase spectra of strictly tetrahedral Ni2+ complexes.15 Thus, a peak at 1020 nm (9803 cm1) can be assigned to the 3T1(F)–3A2 transition of a d8 tetrahedral ion (n2), while the doublet of peaks at 540 (18 500) and 608 nm (16 400 cm1) can be assigned to the 3T1(F)–3T1(P) transition (n3), where 3P is split by spin–orbit coupling into 3P0 (A1), 3P1 (T1), 3P2 (E + T2), respectively.3a A ligand-ﬁeld analysis of this spectrum using a system of equations originally derived by Ballhausen15g (see ESI†) revealed Racah and Dq parameters of 1045 cm1 and 753 cm1. As shown in Table 1, these are notably higher than those common for tetrahedral Ni2+ and suggest that spin–spin repulsion is almost as large as in unperturbed Ni2+ ions, thereby preserving a large spin–orbit coupling interaction. The presence of signiﬁcant spin–orbit coupling was also evi- denced by magnetic measurements. A cmT vs. T plot of Ni-MOF- 5, shown in Fig. 4, revealed the presence of magnetically dilute Ni2+ ions and a room-temperature magnetic moment of 4.21 mB per Ni2+ ion. This value is higher than the spin-only value expected for Ni2+, but is expected for tetrahedral d8 ions subject to unquenched orbital angular momentum.16 The value of meff is further elevated by a temperature independent paramagnetism value of 0.2  106 cm3 mol1 as determined by a ﬁt of the susceptibility data using julX.17 Hints at the reactivity of Ni2+ centers within Ni-MOF-5 came from an in situ UV-Vis-NIR study of the striking colour change that occurs when heating (DMF)2Ni-MOF-5. These experiments, plotted in Fig. 3, evidenced an isosbestic point around 700 nm, which suggested that DMF loss occurred in two kinetically independent processes via a well-deﬁned ﬁve-coordinate Ni2+ species. The identity of this species was probed by treating Ni- MOF-5 with various nucleophiles. Although the reaction of Ni- MOF-5 with small ligands such as PMe3, THF and MeCN rapidly produced octahedral Ni2+, indicated by a colour reversal to yellow, sterically-demanding MesCNO afforded an orange adduct, whose spectrum matched that of the putative penta- coordinate (DMF)Ni-MOF-5 adduct (Fig. S5, ESI†). Thus, Fig. 3 shows a straightforward six- (Oh) to ﬁve- (C4v) to four- (pseudo-Td) coordinate conversion of Ni in a +2 formal oxidation state. These transformations, illustrated in Scheme 1, are supported by computational modeling of (DMF)yNiZn3O- (benzoate)6 (y ¼ 0, 1, 2) clusters containing six-, ﬁve- and four- coordinate Ni2+ ions with two, one or no bound DMF molecules. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), time-dependent DFT calculations using optimized geometries of these clusters predicted electronic absorption spectra that agreed well with the assigned yellow, red, and blue traces in Fig. 3. Conclusions The use of the inorganic nodes in MOF-5 as unusual chelating ligands illustrates a potentially rich area of exploration in coor- dination chemistry. Extending this concept to other metals and MOF systems will enable synthetic inorganic chemists to pursue a variety of important goals, including the isolation of ‘‘hot’’ intermediates from industrial and biological catalytic processes.

Oven-dried sample tubes equipped with TranSeals™ (Micrometrics) were evacuated and tared. Samples were transferred to the sample tubes, heated to the appropriate temperatures (as determined by TGA analysis), and held at those temperatures until the outgas rate was less than 2 mtorr/minute. The evacuated sample tubes were weighed again and the sample mass was determined by subtracting the mass of the previously tared tube. N2 isotherms were measured using liquid nitrogen baths (77 K). UHP grade (99.999% purity) N2 and He, oil-free valves and gas regulators were used for all free space corrections and measurements. Magnetic data were collected using a Quantum Design MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer. A gelatin capsule was filled with evacuated crystals of Ni0.36Zn3.64O(BDC)3 to obtain susceptibility data. DC susceptibility measurements were obtained under a DC field of 100 Oe between 5 K – 300 K. All data was corrected for diamagnetic contributions from the capsule and the sample using Pascal’s constants.4 Nickel and zinc analyses were conducted at the MIT Center for Materials Science and Engineering Shared Experimental Facility (CMSE-SEF) using a HORIBA Jobin ACTIVA inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). Standards were prepared from solutions purchased from ULTRA Scientific©, designated suitable for ICP analysis. The samples consisted of 5% HNO3 solutions containing Ni-MOF-5 at concentrations in the range of 5 mg (metal) / L. To prepare these solutions, Ni-MOF-5 samples were added to the appropriate volume (~ 500 µL) of 70% HNO3, heated at 100 °C until complete dissolution, and diluted with deionized water to obtain a 5% HNO3 solution. Calculations. All time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations and geometry optimizations were performed at the spin-unrestricted level using the Becke-Perdew (BP) functional5,6 with the ORCA 2.8.0 software package.7 For each TD-DFT calculation, 10 excited states were included using one electron transitions. All geometry optimizations began from crystallographically-determined structures, where all atomic positions were optimized. The all-electron Gaussian basis sets developed by the Ahlrichs group were employed in all calculations.8,9 The standard basis sets TZV(p) (for H), TZV(2d) (for C, N, and O), and TZV(2pf) (for Zn and Ni) were employed. The resolution of the identity (RI) approach was taken Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Science This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 S4 for geometry optimizations, though not for TD-DFT calculations. The zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA)10,11,12, 13 method was implemented for all calculations involving Ni. Preparation of Ni-MOF-5. Method A. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (446 mg, 1.50 mmol), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (327 mg, 1.13 mmol), and terephthalic acid (H2BDC, 83 mg, 0.50 mmol) were combined in a 100 mL jar with a Teflon-lined lid. The contents were dissolved in 49 mL of anhydrous DMF and 1 mL of deionized H2O. The solution was heated for 7 h at 100 °C to afford yellow cubic crystals. The reaction container was allowed to cool to room temperature, then transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove bag, with oven-dried glassware and dry solvents. The crystals were collected by gravity filtration and washed with anhydrous DMF (6 × 20 mL), soaking for 8 h each time. The DMF was decanted and the resulting solid was washed with CH2Cl2 (6 × 20 mL), again soaking for 8 h after each wash. A UV-Vis spectrum was taken of the final DMF wash to verify the removal of free metal ions. After the final CH2Cl2 wash, the solvent was decanted and the crystals were heated under vacuum for 12 h (4 mtorr, 200 °C) to yield blue-purple crystals.

A sample of NixZn4-xO(BDC)3 (x = 1) was obtained by soaking colorless MOF-5 crystals prepared in a manner described by Kaye et al.14 in a 20 mL solution of anhydrous DMF and 5.00 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O for ~ 1 year. Yellow cubic crystals were collected by decanting the solution. These were washed with DMF and CH2Cl2 in a manner identical to Method A. Ni- MOF-5 was obtained alternatively by soaking MOF-5 crystals for 2 weeks, but the Ni:Zn content never reached 1:3. Preparation of (MesCNO)0.23Ni0.23Zn3.77O(BDC)3 and other Ni-MOF-5 adducts. A 15 mL toluene solution of MesCNO (11.4 mg, 70.5 µmol) was added dropwise to a suspension of activated single crystals of Ni-MOF-5 (Ni0.23Zn3.77O13C24H12) (150 mg, 0.196 mmol) in 5 mL of toluene under stirring at 35 °C. After combining, the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature, whereupon the blue-purple crystals turned orange. Toluene was removed under Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Science This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 S5 reduced pressure.
