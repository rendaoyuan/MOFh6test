In recent years, porous coordination polymers (PCPs), also known as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), have attracted much attention from the standpoints of both fundamental and applied chemistry.1 Applications of PCPs in the fields of separa- tion,2 storage,3 and catalysis4 have been intensively studied. The greatest advantage of PCPs compared to other porous materials is their chemical versatility, which is due to their chemical composition of metal cations and organic linkers.4b Combining appropriate metal cations and organic linkers leads to the formation of open metal sites (OMSs), which can act as Lewis acid (LA) sites. Although the functionalization of these active sites has been widely explored to produce polymers,5 fine chemicals,6 and industrial chemicals,7 the strong acidity of PCPs based on OMSs has been unexplored. If a strong acid can be produced in PCP frameworks together with their wide range of pore sizes, shapes, and dimensionality, they are very useful as solid acid catalysts showing high activity and/or high selectivity. To produce strong acid sites in PCPs, the construction of the rigid frameworks is of great importance because some PCPs are known to change their coordination modes during the activa- tion step, i.e., the removal of the coordinated solvent is accom- panied with the formation of new coordination bonds between the metal and the organic linker resulting in weak acidity.8 In this context, we designed and synthesized a new thiophene-based tritopic organic linker BTTc (benzene-1,3,5-tris(2-thiophene-5- carboxylate)) (Scheme S1, ESI†). Switching the peripheral benzene rings in the widely used BTB (benzene-1,3,5-tris(4-benzoate))8b,9 to thiophene rings would aﬀord the rigid frameworks due to the more favoured p-stacking, caused by the higher planarity of the linker,10–12 and the nonbonded SS interaction.13 Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of a new PCP, La-BTTc, constructed from the combination of a LaIII cation and a thiophene-based linker BTTc (Scheme 1). La-BTTc was found to have densely aligned one-dimensional (1-D) OMSs, which were shown to act as strong LA sites after the removal of the solvent. A new organic linker, H3BTTc, was synthesized by Suzuki– Miyaura coupling (Scheme S1, ESI†). La-BTTc was synthesized by the solvothermal reaction of La(NO3)36H2O with H3BTTc in DMF (Scheme 1). Single crystals suitable for X-ray structural analysis were obtained. The structure of La-BTTc is shown in Fig. 1 (for details, see ESI†).14 The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of La-BTTc was in good agreement with that simulated from its single crystal structure (Fig. S3, ESI†). Ce-, Pr-, and Nd-BTTc were also synthesized by the same procedure and found to be isostructural to La-BTTc (Fig. S3, ESI†). In the crystal structure of La-BTTc, formulated as [La(BTTc)- (DMF)2(DMF)]N, the organic linker BTTc is stacked in an alternate fashion (Fig. 1a), and the coordination bonds toward the La cation form 1-D hexagonal pores (Fig. 1b), similar to Scheme 1 Synthesis of La-BTTc*solv. a Advanced Materials Research Laboratory, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., 6 Kitahara, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 300-3294, Japan.

This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 those in the corresponding BTB analogue, MIL-103.8b,9c The hexagon is, however, somewhat flattened, whereas MIL-103 forms a regular hexagon (Fig. S6, ESI†). This is due to the tilt of the BTTc linker (ca. 301) from the ab plane (Fig. 1c), which is plausibly caused by its strong tendency to p-stacking. The three thiophene rings of the BTTc linker have an average dihedral angle of 171 with the central benzene ring (Fig. S5, ESI†). This value is, as expected, much smaller than that between the central and peripheral benzene rings in MIL-103 (ca. 351).8b,9c In La-BTTc, all three carboxylates in the linker adopt a m-carboxylato-1k2O:2kO fashion (Fig. 1a and Fig. S7, ESI†), and the La cation is ten-coordinated (SAPRS-10)15 by nine oxygen atoms from carboxylates and one from a DMF molecule (Fig. 1d). On the other hand, the BTB linker in MIL-103 has two m-carboxylato-1k2O:2kO and one m-carboxylato-1kO:2kO0 coor- dination modes (Fig. S7, ESI†), and the metal center is nine- coordinated (TPRS-9)15 by eight oxygen atoms from carboxylates and one from a water molecule.8b,9c The most characteristic structural feature of La-BTTc is that metal cations are aligned in a 1-D, slightly zigzag chain, where the La–La distance is 4.1 Å, and that they are coordinated by DMF from the same direction (Fig. 1c and Fig. S8, ESI†). This means that densely aligned 1-D OMSs can be formed after the removal of DMF. Although there are several examples of PCPs consisting of 1-D inorganic chains,16 they usually form a threefold (e.g. MOF-7416,17 and MIL-1038b,9c) or fourfold (e.g. MOF-7616,18) screw axis. There- fore, the distances between 1-D OMSs in these PCPs are much longer than that in La-BTTc (Fig. S8, ESI†). In the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of La-BTTc, a two- step mass loss, which can be characterized as the release of water (up to 80 1C) and DMF (up to 250 1C), respectively, was observed (Fig. S4, ESI†). To check the porosity of La-BTTc, all solvent molecules were removed by soaking in ethanol and then heating at 200 1C in vacuo (see ESI†). The XRPD pattern did not change during the activation step (Fig. S10, ESI†), indicating that the framework structure was maintained. Nitrogen gas sorption measurements of an activated sample at 77 K revealed the presence of permanent porosity (Fig. S11, ESI†). The calculated Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was 731 m2 g–1. Assuming that the high temperature of the desorption of DMF in La-BTTc is attributed to its strong coordination, La-BTTc is expected to act as a strong Lewis acid after the removal of DMF. Therefore, the acidity of La-BTTc was evalu- ated by several methods. First, we applied a spectroscopic method using acetone as a probe molecule.19,20 When acetone interacts with acidic sites, the CQO bond is elongated (Scheme S2, ESI†). This leads to a low-frequency shift of n(CQO) in the IR spectrum.19d The results are summarized in Table 1 (for details, see ESI†). As expected, ZIF-821 with no acidic sites, did not aﬀect the n(CQO) of an adsorbed acetone molecule compared with acetone itself. In contrast, PCPs with LA sites, such as MIL-103(La)8b,9c and MIL-101(Cr),22 resulted in the shift of n(CQO) of acetone to lower frequency. Among the PCPs tested, La-BTTc showed the largest low-frequency shift of ca. 30 cm–1, indicating the strong interaction between the LaIII in the PCP and the carbonyl oxygen atom. It is noteworthy that two peaks were observed in the case of La-BTTc (for the proposed mechanisms, see ESI†). Next, we employed the temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), which is commonly used to determine the acidity of zeolites.23 To the best of our knowledge, to date there is only one report on the application of NH3-TPD to PCPs.24,25 The serious problem is that many PCPs are not stable toward NH3. To check the stability of La-BTTc toward NH3, the activated sample was exposed to NH3 and the XRPD pattern of the resultant material was compared with the original one (for details, see ESI†). The framework structure of La-BTTc was maintained even at 350 1C (Fig. S17, ESI†). Thus, La-BTTc was found to have suﬃcient stability to be characterized by NH3-TPD. As shown in Fig. 2, La-BTTc showed a large desorption peak in the high temperature region (for details, see ESI†). The peak temperatures are much higher than that reported for MIL-101(Cr)24 and that observed for a Fig. 1 The molecular structure of La-BTTc: (a) stacking of the organic linker; (b) view along c; (c) view along b; (d) coordination geometry around the metal.

The observed acid density of La-BTTc (1.39 mmol g–1) was in agreement with the value calculated from its molecular formula (1.69 mmol g–1 for [La(BTTc)]N) (Table S2, ESI†). Thus, the OMSs in La-BTTc were found to act as very strong LA sites.TheoriginofthestrongacidityofLa-BTTcisprobablytheunique coordination modes of the BTTc linker (see ESI†). Finally, the reaction using La-BTTc as a Lewis acid catalyst was conducted. We employed the cyanosilylation reaction, which is widely used to test the Lewis acid catalysis of PCPs.26 The reaction products, cyanohydrin derivatives, are useful building blocks in the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharma- ceuticals.27 As shown in Scheme 2, benzaldehyde was eﬃciently converted to the corresponding cyanohydrin trimethylsilyl ether by the reaction with trimethylsilyl cyanide in the presence of La-BTTc. The heterogeneity of the reaction was confirmed by the filtration test (for details, see ESI†). The observed catalytic activity is comparable to the best prior results for PCPs (Table S4, ESI†),26 reflecting the strong acidity of La-BTTc. Furthermore, we also examined the reaction of 1-hexene with La-BTTc at a high temperature to evaluate the acidity. A clear propensity in the formation of hydrocarbons other than C6 isomers was observed at 400 1C in the presence of La-BTTc. (for details, see ESI†). This result can be related to the cracking reaction of hydrocarbons in which zeolites play an important role.28 In summary, we have successfully synthesized a new lantha- noid PCP La-BTTc having densely aligned 1-D OMSs. The OMSs in La-BTTc showed strong Lewis acidity. The application of La-BTTc as a solid acid catalyst is currently under investigation.

Under an N2 atmosphere, the mixture of tribromobenzene (2.36 g, 7.51 mmol), 5-carboxythiophene-2-boronic acid (12.9 g, 75.0 mmol), K2CO3 (15.6 g, 113 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (870 mg, 0.752 mmol), and 3:1 (v:v) DMF/H2O (300 mL) was heated at 100 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, insoluble materials were removed by filtration. To the filtrate were added H2O and CHCl3, and the aqueous layer was extracted with water. To the resultant aqueous solution was added HClaq to give white precipitates. Filtration and washing successively with H2O, EtOH, and CHCl3 afforded the desired tricarboxylic acid H3BTTc (3.10 g, 6.79 mmol, 90%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): δ 7.76 (d, 3JHH = 4.0 Hz, 3H), 7.83 (d, 3JHH = 4.0 Hz, 3H), 7.97 (s, 3H), 13.0 (br s, 3H). 13C NMR (DMSO-d6): δ 123.16 (d), 126.29 (d), 134.28 (d), 134.35 (s), 134.88 (s), 147.92 (s), 162.76 (s).

After cooling to room temperature, the resultant white precipitate was recovered by filtration, washed with DMF, and dried at room temperature in vacuo to afford La-BTTc including solvents in the pores (814 mg, 97% yield). Ce-, Pr-, and Nd-BTTc were also obtained by the same procedure from the corresponding MIII(NO3)3·6H2O instead of La(NO3)3·6H2O. The XRPD patterns of La-, Ce-, Pr-, and Nd-BTTc are shown in Fig. S3 together with the simulated pattern of La-BTTc. The TGA trace of La-BTTc is shown in Fig. S4, from which the formula of the material is calculated as [La(BTTc)(DMF)·(DMF)·4H2O]∞. (2) Single crystal synthesis. In a 4 mL glass vial was placed the mixture of H3BTTc (20 µmol) and DMF solution (20 mM) of La(NO3)3·6H2O (1.0 mL, 20 µmol). The vial was sealed and the mixture was placed in an oven at 120 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, a suitable crystal was mounted on a loop and analyzed to reveal its formula as [La(BTTc)(DMF)·2(DMF)]∞. Ce-BTTc was also obtained by the same procedure from Ce(NO3)3·6H2O instead of La(NO3)3·6H2O. The difference in the formula of the material between powder and crystal synthesis is probably due to the workup process. In powder synthesis, some DMF molecules would have been substituted by water molecules from the atmospheric moisture during the filtration and washing procedure. X-ray Crystallographic Analysis. The intensity data were collected on a Rigaku Saturn 724+ CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71070 Å). The structures were solved by a direct method (SHELXS-97)S4 and refined by full-matrix least-squares procedures on F2 for all reflections (SHELXL-97).S4 The non-hydrogen atoms of the framework and the coordinated solvent ([Ln(BTTc)(DMF)·2(DMF)]∞) were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters, while those of the free solvent ([Ln(BTTc)(DMF)·2(DMF)]∞) were refined with isotropic thermal parameters. All hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions. Details of the crystal data and a summary of the intensity data collection parameters for La-BTTc and Ce-BTTc are listed in Table S1. ORTEP drawings of these complexes are illustrated in Fig. S5, together with dihedral angles between the central benzene ring and the peripheral thiophene rings.

Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 11 Activation of La-BTTc. To a 100 mL glass vial was added La-BTTc (810 mg) and EtOH (55 mL). The vial was capped and the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 72 h, during which time the solvent was exchanged twice by the removal of the supernatant and the addition of fresh EtOH. Filtration and washing with EtOH afforded the EtOH-exchanged La-BTTc (692 mg). The TGA trace is shown in Fig. S9. The EtOH-exchanged samples were heated at 200 °C for 6 h in vacuo to give the activated La-BTTc. The XRPD patterns of La-BTTc during the activation steps are shown in Fig. S10. Nitrogen isotherm of the activated La-BTTc is shown in Fig. S11.

Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 14 IR Spectra of Acetone-adsorbed PCPs. Acetone-adsorbed PCPs were prepared by the following procedure. Small amounts (5–10 mg each) of activated samples of PCPs were weighed in 8 mm ø microtubes as quickly as possible to prevent adsorption of water from air. The microtubes were placed in a Schlenk flask, and the flask was heated with an oil bath at 100 °C under dynamic vacuum for 2 h. After the flask was cooled to room temperature, dry acetone (0.5 mL) was added via syringe to the bottom of the flask under static vacuum. The flask was allowed to stand at room temperature under static vacuum for 1 h, during which time acetone was vaporized and adsorbed inside the micropores of PCPs. The samples of acetone-adsorbed PCPs in the microtubes were taken out of the flask, and the IR spectra were recorded using the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) method. The IR spectra are shown in Fig. S12–S15. Scheme S2 Interaction of acetone with acidic sites. Fig. S12 IR spectra of activated (red) and acetone-adsorbed (blue) La-BTTc.

Discussion on the IR Spectra. As seen in Fig. S12, two bands were observed in the region of the carbonyl stretching vibration for acetone-adsorbed La-BTTc. This phenomenon indicates that there are two kinds of acetone molecules interacting with acidic sites. One possible explanation is that due to the steric hindrance, acetone cannot coordinate strongly to the La cation after the next OMS is occupied with another acetone molecule (Fig. S16a). This is in agreement with the short distance of the neighboring OMSs in La-BTTc (4.1 Å) and the kinetic diameter of acetone (4.6 Å).S7 Another possibility is that some of LA sites in La-BTTc are blocked by the residual water molecules and acetone is interacted with both LA sites of La cation and BA sites of coordinated water (Fig. S16b). Similar Brønsted acidity has been reported in the LA sites of MIL-100(Cr).S8 When the sample was allowed to stand under humid air for 1 h before adsorption of acetone, it showed only one peak at 1690.8 cm−1, different from both two of the activated sample (Table 1 in the main text). Because this new peak seems to result from the induced BA sites of the adsorbed water molecules, the observation of two peaks for the activated sample is plausibly due to the mechanism (a). Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 17 Fig. S16 Possible mechanisms for the observation of two carbonyl stretching vibrations: (a) steric repulsion between the neighboring acetone molecules; (b) interaction with LA sites of La cation and induced BA sites of the residual water molecules. Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 18 Stability of La-BTTc toward NH3. Stability test was conducted by the following procedure. Small amounts (10–15 mg each) of degassed samples of PCPs were weighed in 8 mm ø microtubes as quickly as possible to prevent adsorption of water from air. The microtubes were placed in a Schlenk flask, and the flask was heated with a mantle heater at 100 °C under dynamic vacuum for 2 h. After the flask was cooled to room temperature, ammonia was introduced into the flask until the pressure in the flask became 1 atm. Ammonia was kept flowing at a slow rate while the flask was heated with a mantle heater to a desired temperature, held at the temperature for 2 h, cooled to room temperature. Then the samples were purged at room temperature for 2 h in flowing nitrogen. The samples of PCPs in the microtubes were taken out of the flask, and their framework structures were investigated with XRPD. Stability of the samples was evaluated by comparing the XRPD patterns with those of degassed samples. Fig. S17 The XRPD patterns of La-BTTc: (a) before exposure to NH3; after exposure to NH3 (b) at room temperature, (c) at 200 °C, (d) at 300 °C, and (e) at 350 °C. Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 19 Discussion on the NH3-TPD. The TPD data were collected using a heating rate of 5 K min−1 under He (30 mL min−1) with Q-mass (m/z = 16) as a detector. In Table S2 are summarized the peak temperature and the observed and calculated acid density. In La-BTTc, the largest desorption peak was observed at a very high temperature of 480 °C, followed by a shoulder at 500 °C and a small additional peak at 550 °C (Table S2). It should be noted that these values are above the decomposition temperature of La-BTTc estimated from the TGA (ca. 430 °C, Figs. S4 and S9). Therefore, the exact acid strength of La-BTTc cannot be evaluated. The proper peak value is assumed to be greater than or equal to 430 °C. This value is still much higher than that reported for MIL-101(Cr)S9 and that observed for H-ZSM-5 (Table S2). From the NH3-TPD measurement, the order of the acid strength is La-BTTc > H-ZSM-5 > MIL-101(Cr). The stronger acidity of La-BTTc compared to MIL-101(Cr) is also observed in the IR spectroscopy using acetone as a probe (see the main text).

Discussion on the Origin of the Strong Acidity of La-BTTc. In the case of MIL-103 (Ln-BTB), the removal of the coordinated solvent is accompanied with the change in coordination mode of one µ-carboxylato-1κO:2κOʹ′ carboxylate group to µ-carboxylato-1κ2O:2κO mode, which maintains the coordination geometry around the metal center (TPRS-9, Fig. S18a).S2b By contrast, the removal of DMF cannot result in any changes in coordination mode of the linker in La-BTTc because all carboxylate groups adopt µ-carboxylato-1κthe 2O:2κO fashion in the as-synthesized state. Thus, the activation of La-BTTc would lead to a highly distorted nine-coordinated metal center and would show strong acidity (Fig. S18b).

The activated La-BTTc was weighed in a glass vial as quickly as possible to prevent adsorption of water from air. The vial was heated at 200 °C under dynamic vacuum for 2 h. After the vial was cooled to room temperature, benzaldehyde (PhCHO) and trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) were added under N2. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for several hours (t1). After filtration, the aliquot of the liquid was dissolved in CDCl3 and the 1H NMR spectrum was recorded to evaluate the progress of the reaction. To confirm the heterogeneity of the reaction, the liquid after the filtration was further stirred at room temperature for additional hours (t2) and analyzed again. The results are summarized in Table S3.

Discussion on the Catalytic Activity. To compare the catalytic activity of La-BTTc with those of known PCPs, the reported results are summarized in Table S4. Because the reaction conditions are different in each literature, the comparison of the yields is not appropriate. Therefore, we have calculated the TON and TOF values for the comparison. The large TON and TOF values calculated for La-BTTc strongly indicate the high activity of this material. It should be noted that our reaction conditions are milder than those reported in the literatures (smaller amounts of TMSCN and lower temperature).

The reaction of 1-hexene was conducted by utilizing the apparatus shown in Fig. S19. The sample was loaded in a glass insert [b] and activated at 200 °C for 30 min under a flow of He. After heating to the reaction temperature shown in Table S5, the stop valves [e] were closed and 1-hexene was added via INJ-1. 1-Hexene was allowed to react in the closed reaction system for 7 min. Then the six port valve [a] was switched to the dashed lines. The reaction mixture was analyzed by the GC using capillary [c] and packed columns [d] with FID as a detector. The product distribution is summarized in Table S5. In Fig. S20 are shown the XRPD patterns of La-BTTc after the reaction, which is almost unchanged compared with the sample before the reaction.
