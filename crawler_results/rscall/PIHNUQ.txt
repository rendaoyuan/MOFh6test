[Co(cpoa)2(H2O)2]?2H2O (4), [Ni(cpoa)(4,49-bpy)(H2O)2] (5), [Ni(cpoa)(bpe)1.5(H2O)]?H2O (6), [Zn2(cpoa)2(bpe)(H2O)] (7), [Zn(cpoa)(bpe)0.5]?0.5(i-C3H7OH) (8) and [Zn(cpoa)(bpe)0.5]? 0.5(n-C3H7OH) (9) (H2cpoa = 4-carboxyphenoxy acetic acid, bpe = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane, 4,49-bpy = 4,49-bipyridine) were synthesized under hydro/solvothermal conditions. X-ray single- crystal structural analyses reveal that they have metal–organic frameworks ranging from 0D (1), 1D (3, 4), 2D (5, 7, 8) to 3D structure (2, 6, 9). The reaction of the CoCl2/H2cpoa/bpe (1 : 1 : 1) system results in the formation of complex 1 at the starting pH of ca. 8, and complex 2 at 12. The reaction of CoCl2/H2cpoa/4,49-bpy (1 : 1 : 1) forms complex 3 with a 1D chain structure, while a molar ratio of 1 : 1 : 0.5 leads to the formation of complex 4 with two 1D metal–organic frameworks of rarely reported homometal complex ion pairs. By changing the added organic solvent, the 2D layer framework of complex 8 and the microporous 3D framework of complex 9 were obtained under the same reaction conditions. The guest n-C3H7OH molecules occupy 1D channels in 9. Thermogravimetric and powder X-ray diffraction analyses show that the microporous 3D framework of 9 is maintained after the removal of the guest molecule. And a reversible dealcoholization/ realcoholization process can be observed. The magnetic measurements show antiferromagnetic interactions between the metal ions in 2, 4 and 5, and antiferromagnetic interaction in the range of 300–18 K and ferromagnetic interaction between Ni(II) ions below 18 K in 6. Introduction The design and synthesis of porous metal–organic frameworks based on the selection of ligands and metal ions has become a very attractive research field.1 The motive comes not only from the intriguing structural diversity,2 but also from the demand for applications of functional materials in the field of cata- lysis,3 porosity,4 magnetism,5 luminescence,6 conductivity,7 sensing,8 nonlinear optics9 and chirality.10 It is well known that symmetric aromatic polycarboxylate ligands are a dominant family of organic ligands in the preparation of porous metal–organic frameworks.11 Large number of metal– organic frameworks (MOFs) have been successfully obtained by using terephthalate,12 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate,13 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate14 ligands. In comparison with MOFs mentioned above, the metal–organic frameworks assembled from asymmetric carboxylate ligands have been less reported.15 This may be attributed to the deprotonation process of an asymmetric carboxylate ligand, which is more difficult to control. Thanks to the intricate deprotonation, the asymmetric carboxylate ligands possess rich coordination modes, and have the ability to construct novel and fantastic structures.16 4-Carboxyphenoxy acetic acid (H2cpoa) possesses two asymmetric carboxylate groups: one formate and one oxyacetate. The two carboxylate groups are very sensitive to the acidity/basicity of the reaction system, which can be partially or fully deprotonated under different pH values, and further construct different structures when coordinated to metal ions. Moreover, H2cpoa can function not only as a hydrogen-bond donor, but also a hydrogen-bond acceptor, making it a good candidate for the construction of supra- molecular structures.17 Differing from the rigid carboxylate ligands, H2cpoa also has a flexible OCH2COOH group, which makes H2cpoa have flexible configuration and better adapt- ability, and thus provides various recognition and construction of MOFs. A search of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) reveals that the reported complexes containing a H2cpoa ligand mostly focus on the structural characteriza- tion18 and the coordination chemistry of H2cpoa is relatively less explored. Based on the aforementioned point, we report the syntheses, structures and magnetism of new metal com- plexes with H2cpoa, [Co(Hcpoa)2(bpe)2(H2O)2] (1), [Co(cpoa) (bpe)1.5(H2O)]?H2O (2), [Co(Hcpoa)2(4,49-bpy)2] (3), [Co(4,49-bpy)(H2O)4]?[Co(cpoa)2(H2O)2]?2H2O (4), [Ni(cpoa) (4,49-bpy)(H2O)2] (5), [Ni(cpoa)(bpe)1.5(H2O)]?H2O (6), [Zn2(cpoa)2(bpe)(H2O)] (7), [Zn(cpoa)(bpe)0.5]?0.5(i-C3H7OH) (8) and [Zn(cpoa)(bpe)0.5]?0.5(n-C3H7OH) (9). aSchool of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, P.

Results and discussion Description of the structures [Co(Hcpoa)2(bpe)2(H2O)2] (1). Single crystal X-ray diffrac- tion analysis reveals that complex 1 has a mononuclear structure, as shown in Fig. 1. The Co(II) ion is six-coordinated by two oxygen atoms from two Hcpoa2 anions, two nitrogen atoms from two bpe ligands and two oxygen atoms from two water molecules. In 1, the H2cpoa ligand only loses one proton, and coordinates to the Co(II) ion in a monodentate mode via the oxyacetate oxygen atom (Scheme 1a). The bpe molecule adopts an anti-configuration (Scheme 2a) and acts as a monodentate ligand in complex 1, leaving one nitrogen atom free. The O–H…N hydrogen bonds between the protonated carboxylate groups of Hcpoa2 anions and the free nitrogen atoms of bpe ligands make the mononuclear molecules link up. Furthermore, there are O–H…O and C–H…O hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atoms on the Hcpoa2 anions, coordinated water molecules and the ethylene carbon atoms, which extend discrete molecules of 1 into a 3D supramolecular array.

As shown in Fig. 2, the Co(II) ion is six-coordinated by two cpoa22 anions, three bpe molecules and one water molecule. Differing from 1, the H2cpoa ligand is completely deprotonated in 2, which can be explained by the higher pH of the reaction system. Both carboxylate groups of cpoa22 anion adopt a monodentate mode (see Scheme 1b), so the cpoa22 anion acts as a bis(monodentate) bridging ligand. Because of the different coordination mode of the H2cpoa ligand in 2 from that in 1, the Co(II) ions are bridged by cpoa22 anions to form a chain structure (see Fig. 3a), in which the Co…Co distance is 13.905 A˚ for 2, and the Ni…Ni distance is 13.852 A˚ for 6. Interestingly, the bpe ligands in 2 display two distinct configurations, anti- and gauche modes (Scheme 2). They both act as bidentate ligand and bridge the Co(II) ions to form a 2D brick-wall-like structure (see Fig. 3b), in which the Co…Co distances are 13.687 and 7.507 A˚ for 2, and Ni…Ni distances are 13.577 and 7.473 A˚ for 6. The chain structure mentioned above and the 2D brick-wall-like structure cross at the Co(II) ions, leading to a complicated 3D metal–organic framework.

As shown in Fig. 4, the Co(II) ion is six-coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from four Hcpoa2 anions and two nitrogen atoms from two 4,49-bpy ligands. Similar to 1, in complex 3, only one of two carboxylate groups of the H2cpoa ligand is deprotonated. However, the Hcpoa2 anion adopts a completely different coordination mode from 1, bridging-bidentate (Scheme 1c), to connect the Co(II) ions into the 1D chain which is different from the mononuclear structure of complex 1. The protonated formate groups of Hcpoa2 ligands form O–H…N hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen atoms of 4,49-bpy ligands from the adjacent chains, leading to a 2D layer supramolecular structure. Additionally, the C–H…O hydrogen bonds between the carbon atoms on phenyl/pyridyl rings and the carboxylate oxygen atoms lead to the formation of a 3D supramolecular structure.

They act as bridging ligand, connecting Co(II) ions to form 1D [Co(cpoa)(H2O)2]22 double-chain (see Fig. 6B). Two types of 1D chains (A) and (B) are of opposite charges. Observed along the a-axis, the linear (A)-chains are arrayed in parallel, and (B)-chains are arrayed in parallel as well. When seen along the (110) direction, (A)-chains and (B)-chains arrange alternately. Each (A)-chain interlinks with four adjacent (B)-chains by means of hydrogen bonds between the coordinated water molecules and carboxylate oxygen atoms (see Fig. 6). Additionally, the lattice water molecules are involved in the formation of hydrogen bond with the coordinated water molecules from an (A)- and (B)-chain, respectively. Finally, the 3D supramolecular structure of 4 is formed by means of the extensive hydrogen bonding interactions, owing to the coordinated and free water molecules in the crystal.

As illustrated in Fig. 8, a 2D grid is constructed with windows of ca. 11.2 6 13.5 A˚ 2 (based on the distance between metal ions). Due to the large windows, each 2D grid is interpenetrated with two adjacent grids. These grids array in three different orientations, and they are labeled as set (A), -(B) and -(C) (Fig. 9a). The dihedral angles between two adjacent sets of grids are 60u, resulting in the construction of a triple interpenetration network.22 We can see from Fig. 9a that each grid is surrounded by four other grids to shape triangular interspaces. In triangular interspaces, the coordinated water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms and these hydrogen bonded oxygen atoms compose a helical chain, running in a right-hand fashion (Fig. 9b). Furthermore, the 3D triple interpenetration network is stabilized via the hydrogen bonding interactions. [Zn2(cpoa)2(bpe)(H2O)] (7). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that there are two crystallographically independent Zn(II) ions in complex 7, as shown in Fig. 10a. The coordination environments of the two Zn(II) ions are very different. Zn1 is four-coordinated by three oxygen atoms (O1, O4A, O6) from three cpoa22 anions and one nitrogen atom (N1) from one bpe ligand. While Zn2 is five-coordinated to three oxygen atoms (O9, O10, O5B) from two cpoa22 anions, one nitrogen atom (N2C) from one bpe ligand and one oxygen atom (O11) from one water molecule. The cpoa22 anions adopt two coordination modes in 7, bridging-bidentate and monodentate mode (Scheme 1d), and chelating-bidentate and monodentate mode (Scheme 1e). As illustrated in Fig. 10b, they connect Zn(II) ions to form two kinds of macrocyclic loops, labeled as A and B, respectively. The smaller loop A is a twenty-two-member ring, consisting of two bridging bidentate- and monodentate cpoa22 anions and two Zn(II) ions. The larger loop-B is a thirty-member ring, which is formed by the Fig. 8 The 2D gird of 5 along the a-axis, formed by cpoa22 and 4,49-bpy ligands connecting the Ni(II) ions.

[Zn(cpoa)(bpe)0.5]?0.5(i-C3H7OH) (8). Complex 8 crystallizes in a C2/c space group, and has only one crystallographically independent Zn(II) ion. As illustrated in Fig. 11a, the Zn(II) ion is five-coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four cpoa22 anions and one nitrogen atom from one bpe ligand. The cpoa22 anion affords a bis(bridging-bidentate) coordination mode (Scheme 1f), linking four Zn(II) ions. Two Zn(II) ions are joined by four different carboxylate groups to form a dimer unit (Fig. 11b), with a Zn…Zn distance of 3.002(1) A˚ . Adjacent dimer units are bridged by cpoa22 anions to generate a double-chain structure (Fig. 12a). At the same time, the dimer units are linked by bpe ligands to build up a 2D layer framework (Fig. 12b) with windows of ca. 9.8 6 13.3 A˚ 2 (based on the distance between metal ions). As shown in Fig. 13a, these 2D layers are parallel and stacked in …ABAB… fashion along the (201) direction, resulting in space between the layers.

Pairs of Zn(II) ions compose of dimer units with the Zn…Zn distance of 2.979(2) A˚ (Fig. 14b). Although the components and the coordination environments of the complexes 8 and 9 are similar, their Zn-organic frameworks are different. Differing from complex 8, the cpoa22 anions with coordination mode (Scheme 1f) in the dimer unit outstretch to form a windmill- like structure. And the dimer units are further linked to four equivalent neighbors through four windmill-like cpoa22 anions to form a 2D wavy layer structure (Fig. 15a), which is very different from the double-chain structure in complex 8. Meanwhile, the 2D layers are connected by bpe ligands which act as pillars, forming a 3D framework (Fig. 15b). Fascinatingly, the bpe ligands connect the dimer units of adjacent layers in a criss-cross fashion, resulting in the formation of 1D channels along the c-axis (see Fig. 15b). Another diverting result is the size of the channels is approxi- mately 11.4 A˚ 6 5.6 A˚ (based on the nearest distance of the carbon atoms around the channel), and the channels are filled with disordered n-propanol molecules. Differing from complex 8, there are hydrogen bonding interactions between the guest and the framework. As shown in Fig. 15c, the n-propanol molecules form hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the 3D framework (O6…O1 = 2.991 A˚ ). Effect of the reaction system on structural diversity (1) pH of the reaction system. The formation of complexes containing asymmetric carboxylic acid ligands is very sensitive to pH of the reaction system, so different structures can be constructed via changing only the pH values while using the same reagents.23 It was observed that complexes 1 and 2 were synthesized at pH 8 and 11–13, respectively. This result indicates that lower pH favors the formation of Hcpoa2 anions and may prevent further deprotonation of Hcpoa2 anions while higher pH favors the formation of cpoa22 anions, resulting in different components of 1 and 2, and thus different structures of complexes 1 and 2. (2) Metal-to-ligand molar ratio. Analyses of the synthetic conditions and structures of complexes 3 and 4 show that the metal-to-ligand molar ratio has very important influence on the formation and structure of the complexes. Complexes 3 and 4 were synthesized under similar conditions except for the different metal-to-ligand molar ratio. The CoCl2/H2cpoa/ 4,49-bpy molar ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 results in the 1D chain structure of 3, but the molar ratio of 1 : 1 : 0.5 forms a novel complex 4 with homometal complex ion pairs.

From the structural descriptions considered earlier in this paper, we can see that the water molecules coordinated to the metal ions when water was used as the sole solvent in 7. When alcohol and water were used as a mixed solvent, the water molecules do not participate in coordination in 8 and 9. And complexes 8 and 9 have unexpectedly different structures. Complex 8 consists of 2D layer frameworks which stack parallel along the c-axis, while a microporous 3D framework for 9 is constructed. The presence of different alcohol molecules may be the important factor to the construction of structures of 8 and 9. A possible explanation of the above results can be ascribed to the distinct configurations of two alcohols, T-shaped isopropanol in 8 and linear-shaped n-propanol in 9. As a result, the T-shaped isopropanol molecules exactly locate at the spaces of interlayers in 8. However, the n-propanol molecules occupy the 1D channels in 9. TG and PXRD observations Thermogravimetric analyses of the complexes 7–9 were carried out to examine their thermal stabilities (Fig. 16). The observed TG curve reveals that complex 7 lost its coordinated water molecules at the first weight loss of 2.17% (calcd. 2.50%) from 116 to 141 uC. The TG curve exhibits a plateau from 141 to 350 uC. For complex 8, the TG curve shows that the uncoordinated isopropanol molecules were lost at the first weight loss, 7.16% (calcd 7.86%) from 51 to 244 uC. Further decomposition started when the isopropanol molecules were removed, revealing that the host framework collapses when the guest was absent. For complex 9, the first weight loss of 7.54% from 50 to 148 uC corresponds to the loss of uncoordinated n-propanol molecules (calcd 7.86%), leaving a framework of [Zn(cpoa)(bpe)0.5]. This framework remains stable below 300 uC, and it begins to decompose subsequently above 300 uC. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns for complex 9 at 150 uC and 300 uC are the same (Fig. 17b, c), indicating that the structural integrity of the framework is maintained. The further decomposition ends at 930 uC, and the final residue of 21.50% is close to the calculated 21.32% based on ZnO. The PXRD pattern at 930 uC is in good agreement with ZnO (01- 076-0704), confirming the component of residue (see Fig. 17e).

View Article Online To study the microporous property of complex 9, desolva- tion and resolvation were performed and checked by PXRD. Complex 9 was heated to remove the n-propanol molecules at 150 uC for 8 h. The desolvated phase has the same PXRD pattern as the curve of Fig. 17b (see Fig. 18a), but different from Fig. 17a, indicating that the porous framework probably expands after removal of n-propanol, because the PXRD pattern of the desolvated phase shows lower 2h values for the diffraction peaks. This may be explained by the breakdown of the hydrogen bonds between the n-propanol molecules and the host framework, so that the framework expands slightly. The desolvated phase was then immersed to n-propanol at room temperature for one day, and dried in air. Interestingly, the sample exhibits an identical PXRD pattern (Fig. 18b) to that of the original sample of 9 at 25 uC (Fig. 17a), revealing the recovery of the original framework after resolvation. These results illustrate that the main framework of 9 is retained upon removal of the n-propanol molecules and the desolvation/ resolvation process of 9 is reversible. Magnetic properties The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities of com- plexes 2, 4–6 were measured from 2–300 K under a magnetic field of 2kOe. For complexes 2 and 4, the meff values (per Co(II) ion) at 300 K are 5.13 mB and 5.00 mB, respectively, which are larger than the calculated values for the spin-only case (meff = 3.87 mB, S = 3/2, g = 2.0), indicating the unquenched orbital contribution.

These results suggest weak antiferromagnetic interactions in com- plexes 2 and 4. It should be noted that the distortion of octahedral geometry of Co(II) in 2 is stronger than that of Co(II) in 4 leading to larger anisotropy of Co(II) and a larger negative h value in 2. The magnetic behavior of complex 5 is shown in Fig. 20 in the form of xM and meff versus T. The meff of 3.16 mB per Ni(II) ion at room temperature is slightly larger than the calculated one for the spin-only value of 2.83mB for an uncoupled Ni(II) ion (S = 1, g = 2.0). The meff value for complex 5 decreases very slowly from 3.16 mB at 300 K to 3.08 mB at 10 K, then it decreases rapidly to 2.26 mB at 2 K, which should be mainly attributed to the zero-field splitting of Ni(II) ions. The experimental susceptibility data were fitted by using the equation (1)24 when considered S = 1 ions in the presence of a single ion anisotropy and possible weak magnetic coupling between nickel(II) ions. xM~ 2Ng2b2 3k T{h ð Þ 2x{1{2exp {x ð Þx{1zexp {x ð Þ 1z2exp {x ð Þ (1) where x = D/kT.

The small negative h shows that there is a very weak antiferro- magnetic coupling between the Ni(II) ions. The plot of meff vs. T (2–300 K) of complex 6 is shown in Fig. 21. Similar to complex 5, meff of 3.13 mB per Ni(II) ion at room temperature is slightly larger than the calculated for the spin-only Ni(II) ion (meff = 2.83) assuming g = 2. However, the curve of meff –T is very different from that of complex 5. The meff value increases only a little over the range of 300–50 K (from 3.13 to 3.19 mB) and then increases rapidly to reach Fig. 19 Plots of xM 21 (%) and meff (#) vs. T and the theoretical fits (solid lines) for complexes 2 (up) and 4 (bottom). 664 | CrystEngComm, 2007, 9, 653–667 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2007 Published on 15 May 2007.

Complex 6 can be regarded as 1D chains built from cpoa22 and Ni(II) ions, and the magnetic coupling transmitted by bpe should be very weak. Therefore the magnetic data of 6 have been fitted (18–300 K) by means of a 1-D (S = 1) ferromagnetic chain model.25 The expression of magnetic susceptibility is given in eqn (2). xM~ 2Ng2b2 3kT AX 3zBX 2zCXz1 DX 2zEXz1 (2) With X = J/kT and for a = 1, A = 0.14709, B = 20.788967, C = 0.866426, D = 0.096573 and E = 20.624929. The best fit for the magnetic data leads to g = 2.21, J = 1.18 cm21, R = 3.54 6 1024. The fitting results indicate a weak ferromagnetic interaction between nickel(II) ions transferred by cpoa22 anions. The abrupt decrease of meff below 18 K may result from a possible zero-field splitting of nickel(II) ions and weak antiferromagnetic interaction mediated by bpe. Conclusions Nine new complexes have been prepared from an asymmetric H2cpoa ligand and the transition metal ions. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction results display that changing the deprotona- tion modes of H2cpoa, the metal-to-ligand molar ratio and the solvent of the reaction system leads to the diverse structures from mononuclear, 1D chain, 2D layer to 3D metal–organic framework. Structural analyses of these complexes also show that the flexible configuration of H2cpoa ligand enables the complexes to possess interesting structures. Comparing the complexes 2 (3D), 4 (1D) and 5 (2D), we found that they had completely different frameworks derived from the same bis(monodentate) coordination mode for cpoa22. Furthermore, complexes 8 (2D) and 9 (3D) had the same bis(bridging-bidentate) coordination mode. These results can be explained by the flexible OCH2COOH group of H2cpoa, which offers adaptability in order to meet the steric effect for assembly of MOFs. Interestingly, a reversible desolvation/ resolvation process has been observed in complex 9, which shows that the asymmetric ligand is promising for the design and synthesis of dynamic porous metal–organic framework. In summary, for less studied asymmetric ligands such as 4-carboxyphenoxy acetic acid (H2cpoa), the diversity of the M-cpoa frameworks can be obtained by using the usual methods. However, the structural information described above shows that controlled synthesis is a challenge, and promising at least for the preparation of functional materials in the fields of porosity and magnetism.
