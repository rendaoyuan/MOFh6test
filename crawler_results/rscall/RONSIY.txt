They show CdSO4 (65.8) net and have obvious 1-D channel that spread 22 along the crystallographic c axis. More importantly, 1 shows high selectivity for H2 over 23 N2 and CO2 at low pressure, which could be confirmed via computational calculations 24 using Connolly algorithm to reveals the size and shape of accessible voids. The 25 incorporation of the drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) into the desolvated 1 was around 27.5 26 wt% per gram of dehydrated 1. 5-FU is released in a highly controlled and progressive 27 fashion with 61 % of the drug released after 95 hours. In addition, we have applied 28 molecular docking calculations to investigate the preferred conformation of 5-FU 29 molecules upon binding to MOF 1. These calculations provide a structural basis to 30 explain the 5-FU release from MOF 1. 31 ________________________________________________________________________ 32 Introduction 33 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have drawn considerable attention in recent years 34 Page 1 of 22 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 September 2014.

View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C4DT01890G and have been evaluated for their promising applications in delivery and gas 1 technology.1-2 Particularly, MOFs as drug-delivery vehicles are highly desirable in view 2 of their large loadings of drugs, and biodegradability.3 Férey and his co-workers reported 3 an example of non-toxic porous iron(III)-based MOFs, which shows nano-carriers for 4 controlled delivery of several anti-tumoural and retroviral drugs.3d Recently, ZIF-8 has 5 been demonstrated to be an outstanding metal imidazolate framework showing high 6 porosity and exceptional stability and also exhibiting interesting properties for a carrier.4 7 Some a few of MOFs allow high amounts of drugs to be loaded, with a complete delivery 8 time ranging from 6 to 30 days.5-10 9 Recently, flexible dicarboxylate derivatives have been developed to assemble MOFs, 10 which shows intrinsic charming topologies and excellent gas absorption capacity using 11 the advantage of their active metal centers and large permanent prosity.11 We have been 12 interested in the syntheses and characterization of MOFs containing the series of organic 13 linkers of 4,4'-oxybis(benzoic acid) (H2oba), 1,2-bis(4-carboxy-phenoxy)ethane(H2bce) 14 and 1,3-bis(4-carboxy-phenoxy)propane (H2bcp). Among the three types of flexible 15 dicarboxylate ligands, the segment of –O-X-O- chains are different with respect with the 16 relative orientation of CH2 groups.12 However, the control of product architectures still 17 remains a major challenge in this field due to some uncertain factors.13 Herein, we chose 18 a new flexible ligand L to construct nonporous MOFs. Fortunately, two isoreticular 19 metal–organic frameworks of [Cu(L)(4,4’-bipy)(H2O)]n·1.5nCH3CN (1) and 20 [Cu(L)(4,4’-bipy)(H2O)]n·4nH2O (2) have been prepared. Their drug load and release 21 capacity using an anticancer drug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), as a model was evaluated. In 22 addition, we have investigated the preferred conformation of 5-FU upon binding to MOF 23 1 when another 5-FU molecule is already bound in the pore. 1 shows high selectivity for 24 H2 over N2 and CO2 at low pressure, which is also corroborated by molecular surface 25 calculations based on Connolly algorithm14. 26 Materials and Method 27 All reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. IR spectra 28 were recorded with a Perkin–Elmer Spectrum One spectrometer in the region 29 4000–400cm–1 using KBr pellets. TGA were carried out with a Metter–Toledo TA 50 30 under dry dinitrogen flux (60mL.min–1) at a heating rate of 5°C min–1. X-ray powder 31 Page 2 of 22 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 September 2014. Downloaded by Heriot Watt University on 11/10/2014 05:11:36. View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C4DT01890G diffraction (XRPD) data were recorded on a Rigaku RU200 diffractometer at 60KV, 1 300mA for Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), with a scan speed of 2 °C/min and a step size 2 of 0.02° in 2θ. Magnetic susceptibility data of powdered samples restrained in parafilm 3 were measured on Oxford Maglab 2000 magnetic measurement system in the temperature 4 range 300–1.8 K and at field of 1KOe. All the gas sorption isotherms were measured by 5 using a ASAP 2020M adsorption equipment. 6 X-ray Crystallography 7 Single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses of the two compounds were carried out on a 8 Bruker SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromated 9 MoΚα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) by using φ/ω scan technique at room temperature. The 10 intensities were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects as well as for empirical 11 absorption based on multi-scan techniques; all structures were solved by direct methods 12 and refined by full-matrix least-squares fitting on F2 by SHELX-97.15 Absorption 13 corrections were applied by using multi-scan program SADABS.16 Non-hydrogen atoms 14 were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms of organic ligands were placed in 15 calculated positions and refined using a riding on attached atoms with isotropic thermal 16 parameters 1.2 times those of their carrier atoms. The water hydrogen atoms were located 17 from difference maps and refined with isotropic thermal parameters 1.5 times those of 18 their carrier atoms. The guest solvent molecules in the crystal and they are impossible to 19 refine using conventional discrete atom models, the SQUEEZE subroutine of the 20 PLATON software suite was applied to remove the scattering from the highly disordered 21 solvent molecules, and sets of solvent-free diffraction intensities were generated. Three 22 acetonitrile (a C2H3N has 24 electrons) molecules are presumed to reside in each of the 23 twi 301Å3 voids in 1. Eight water molecules are presumed to reside in each of the two 24 319 Å3 voids in 2. The formula units of 1-2 were arrived at through a combination of 25 elemental analyses, infrared and thermogravimetric characterization. The more detail 26 information are listed in the cif files. The Cu(II) and O1w atoms have been refined as two 27 equal positions (the copper atom and water molecule were allowed to refine off the 28 center-of-inversion) in 2. Selected bond distances and bond angles are listed in Table 2. 29 CCDC: 1001340-1001341. 30 Synthesis of the complexes 31 Page 3 of 22 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 September 2014.

Each sampled conformation was evaluated and ranked according to an 21 molecular mechanics empirical energy function.18 Grid maps with 126 X 126 X 126 22 points of dimension were calculated using AutoGrid4.19 Coarse (grid-point spacing of 23 0.30 Å) and fine (grid-point spacing of 0.14 Å) sets of grid maps were used during the 24 docking simulations in order to sample the entire MOF 1 structure and to improve the 25 accuracy of energy estimates for host-guest interactions. Atomic charges for MOF 1 and 26 5-FU tautomers were assigned according to Amber86 force field,20 ensuring that all 27 residues have integer charges. The Amber86 atom types were assigned to all atoms. The 28 LGA parameters used during the conformational search were: an initial population of 50 29 random individuals, a maximum number of 1.5 x 106 energy evaluations, a maximum 30 number of 27000 generations, and mutation and crossover rates of 0.02 and 0.08, 31 Page 4 of 22 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 September 2014.

A maximum of 300 1 iterations per local search was allowed. The lowest energy docked conformations were 2 sorted in order of increasing energy and the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of 3 each conformation was calculated and compared in order to cluster together 4 conformations with a RMSD smaller than 2.0 Å. A detailed description of the LGA 5 parameters and procedures employed here can be found elsewhere21. Previous 6 applications of the molecular docking methodology to predict the binding conformation 7 of drug-MOF complexes have also been reported22. 8 Results and Discussion 9 Syntheses of the MOFs 10 Two isoreticular metal–organic frameworks 1 and 2 were obtained via the solvothermal 11 reaction of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O with L in CH3CN under the same reaction conditions 12 described, except for the reaction temperature of the reactant used. While 1 was obtained 13 under 120 °C, 2 was prepared via the same solvothermal reaction, but at a lower reaction 14 temperature, 105°C. The reaction used of the same reactant process employed for the 15 synthesis of 2 under 120 °C, which led to the formation of powder. Cheetham and his 16 co-worker found less water for complexes formed at higher temperatures is likely driven 17 by the increased entropic contribution associated with releasing water from a confined 18 state in these solids to a liquid state13f-g. The pH values of the reaction solutions does not 19 play a role key in determining the final products, although we have tried to adjust the pH 20 (such as 6 and 7.5) at different degrees. 21 [Cu(L)(4,4’-bipy)(H2O)]n·1.5nCH3CN (1) 22 The asymmetric unit of 1 has one Cu(II) center, one doubly deprotonated L ligand, one 23 4,4’-bipy molecule, one coordinated water molecule and 1.5 CH3CN free molecules. The 24 Cu(II) atom shows a square base pyramidal [CuN2O3] coordination geometry (Fig. 1a), 25 where the N atoms belong to two different 4,4’-bipy linkers and the two O atoms (O1and 26 O3) from different L ligands. The vertex position is occupied by the coordinated water 27 molecule (O1W). Adjacent Cu(II) atoms bind to each L anion through carboxylate 28 oxygen atoms on the same side of the orientation, so that neutral zigzag 1-D [Cu(L)]n 29 chains with a Cu–Cu distance of 13.88 Å are formed (Fig. S1). Mutually orthogonal sets 30 the [Cu(4,4’-bipy)]n chains run parallel to the a and c crystal directions(Fig. S2). The two 31 Page 5 of 22 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 September 2014. Downloaded by Heriot Watt University on 11/10/2014 05:11:36. View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C4DT01890G types of chains in 1 are in turn strutted each other, resulting in a 3D 4-connected CdSO4 1 (circuit symbol (65.8) or Schläflinotation (6.6.6.6.62.∞)) topology framework (Fig.2, Fig. 2 3 and see ESI for the detailed topological information) 23,24. This MOF is a microporous 3 framework, and the pore openings as viewed along the c-axis are rhombic in shape and 4 have dimensions of about 10.7×13.8 Å2 (excluding the van der Waals radii of the atoms). 5 Moreover, such arrangement makes 1 become a 3D continuous intersecting channel 6 system (Fig. 2b) with highly solvent accessible voids of 23.6%. 7 [Cu(L)(4,4’-bipy)(H2O)]n·4nH2O (2) 8 The asymmetric unit of 2 has one Cu(II) center, one doubly deprotonated L ligand, one 9 4,4’-bipy molecule, one coordinated water molecule and 4 free water molecules. The 10 Cu(II) exhibits square-pyramidal geometry with vertex position is occupied by one water 11 molecule(Fig.1b). The coordinated mode and arrangement of L and 4,4’-bipy are very 12 similar with that of 1 (Fig.S3 and S4). So, a [Cu(L)(H2O)]n chain is also constructed 13 parallel the ac-plane (Fig.S3). Thus, the compounds 1 and 2 are isoreticular 14 metal–organic frameworks. The volume of the solvent channels comprises 23% of the 15 total unit cell volume. 16 From the above discussion, the two coordination networks are fairly rigid - the 17 4,4'-bipyridines link the metal centers to form a layer. Then, the V-shaped carboxylates 18 link the layers into a 3D network. Although the organic linkers containing L and 19 4,4’-bipy have the same coordinated modes, the Cu...Cu distances are different (13.8 Å 20 for 1 and 5.5 Å for 2) due to the different bridging modes of water molecule. But they 21 have the similar frameworks because of the same linkage of 4,4’-bipy layer. Moreover, 22 from the calculation values of the solvent channels, 1 and 2 also have the same void, 23 which can be proved by latter molecular docking calculations. 24 Thermogravimetric Analyses and XRPD 25 To study the stabilities of the polymers, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of 26 complexes 1-2 were performed (Fig. S5). The compound 1 shows two weight loss steps. 27 The first weight loss begins at 80°C and is completed at 180°C. The observed weight loss 28 of 12.3% is corresponding to the loss of 1.5 CH3CN and coordinated water molecule 29 (calcd 11.5%). The second weight loss occurs latterly, and can be attributed to the 30 elimination of bipy and L ligands (obsd: 72.2%; calcd 71.7%). The compound 2 also has 31 Page 6 of 22 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 September 2014. Downloaded by Heriot Watt University on 11/10/2014 05:11:36. View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C4DT01890G two observed weight loss. First weight loss of 16.1% is corresponding to the loss of the 1 crystallization water and coordinated water molecules (calcd 16.0%). A gradual weight 2 loss from 280 °C indicates that the complex decomposes continuously when the 3 temperature is rising up. 4 Additionally, to confirm the phase purity of compounds, the original samples were 5 characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) at room temperature. The patterns 6 that were simulated from the single-crystal X-ray data of compounds were in agreement 7 with those that were observed (Fig. S6). The powder XRD pattern of MOFs samples 8 shows small shifts in the peak positions and some peaks are also missing. This suggests 9 minor rearrangements of atoms upon replacement of guest molecules. 10 The χm T value was 0.68 cm3 K mol−1 at 300 K in 1 (Fig. 4a), and this is larger than the 11 spin only value (0.38 cm3 K mol−1) for the S = 1/2 state. A similar phenomenon is 12 documented in the case of [CuL](Cl2)·2H2O (L = 6,13-bis(dodecylaminomethylidene)- 13 1,4,8,11-tetrazacyclotetradeca- 4,7,11,14-tetraene) complex, the χm T value of 0.75 cm3 K 14 mol−1 for one Cu(II) atom is observed at a room temperature.25m When decreasing the 15 temperature, the χm T decreases monotonously (0.40 cm3 K mol−1 at ~20 K), and drops to 16 a minimum (0.27 cm3 K mol−1 at 2 K). If the data was analyzed based on the Lines’ 17 simple-cubic-lattice equation,25a the parameters were obtained as follows: J = −0.42 cm−1, 18 g = 2.07 cm−1, and TIP = 1.005 × 10-6 cm3 mol−1, where TIP represents 19 temperature-independent paramagnetism caused by a coupling with the excited states. 20 The temperature-independent paramagnetism (TIP) is typically of order 10−6 for Cu(II) 21 complexes.25j Temperature Independent Paramagnetism is of importance in the study of 22 metal complexes from two points of view. First, because it may need to be corrected for 23 when calculating µeff values, and secondly because it can be used in complexes to obtain 24 an estimate of the ligand field parameter for dn systems. Thus, the TIP value is related to 25 the framework in some degree. TIP is much larger than the mononuclear copper(II) 26 complex, but it may due to the 3D structure. The decrease in χm T from 300 K to ~20 K is 27 mainly due to the TIP, and the drop below 20 K is due to the antiferromagnetic 28 interactions. In conclusion, the antiferromagnetic interaction is no doubt very small.25a 29 The χm T value was 0.225 cm3 K mol−1 at 300 K in 2 (Fig. 4b), and this is smaller than 30 the spin only value (0.38 cm3 K mol−1) for the S = 1/2 state, suggesting an 31 Page 7 of 22 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 September 2014. Downloaded by Heriot Watt University on 11/10/2014 05:11:36. View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C4DT01890G antiferromagnetic interaction. A similar value of χm T at room temperature are 0.68 cm3 K 1 mol−1 was observed at a complex of (Bu4N)2[Cu(dmso)2{Cu(dnopba)(dmso)}2], which is 2 well below the expected one for three magnetically isolated spin doublets (χm T = 1.24 3 cm3 K mol−1).25k When decreasing the temperature, the χm T decreases gradually till at 4 around 80 K (0.055 cm3 K mol−1 at ~80 K), and slightly decreases to the minimum (0.036 5 cm3 K mol−1 at 2 K). In the χm versus T plot, χm shows a maximum at around 200 K, but it 6 increases below 70 K. The observed data could not be well simulated based on models, 7 including cubic lattice model, quadratic layer model, linear chain model; however, the 8 decrease in χm T from 300 K to ~80 K must be due to an antiferromagenetic interaction, 9 and this seems to be consistent with the maximum in χm at ~200 K. The data could be 10 fitted with the parameters, J = −250 cm−1, zJ’ = −250 cm−1, g = 2.04 cm−1. 11 Although compounds reported in this paper (1-2) show similar antiferromagnetic 12 behavior, the observed χm T values are different. In compound 1, each Cu(II) ion is linked 13 to four neighboring Cu(II) ions, by two 4,4’-bipy bridges with a Cu…Cu distance of 14 13.88 Å and two L bridges with Cu…Cu distance of 11.17 Å. Since these bridges should 15 pass weak antiferromagnetic interactions with similar amplitudes.25 It has already been 16 established that the coupling in Cu(II) centers bridged by only long organic linkers is 17 generally very weak.25i The obtained value J is smaller than values reported in the related 18 literature.25 This behavior could be rationalized on the basis of the existence of only two 19 bridging ligands per copper pair and larger separations in 1 as was discussed in detail 20 above (description of the structure). In compounds 2, the H2O fixes the copper atoms in a 21 related flexible molecular frame and makes a binuclear subunit. Considering 22 magneto-structural correlations,25 magnetic behavior of Cu(II) complexes with 23 hydroxo/alkoxo bridged oxygen atoms is highly dependent on the Cu-O-Cu bridge angles 24 and usually display antiferromagnetic character when the Cu-O-Cu angles exceed the 25 value of 98°,25g this coordination polymer of 2 presents the Cu-O-Cu bridge angle of 26 174.8(2)°. Furthermore, the obtained J value of -250 cm−1 is consistent with the typical 27 values in the range of -140 to -270 cm−1 for similar binuclear compounds.25i 28 To examine porosity, 1 was activated at 100 °C for 10 h under vacuum (Fig.S6). The 29 N2 and CO2 sorption isotherms were performed at 77 and 195 K; the maximum N2 and 30 CO2 uptakes are 44.0 and 86.5 cm3 g−1, respectively (Fig. 5). The hysteresis character 31 Page 8 of 22 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 September 2014. Downloaded by Heriot Watt University on 11/10/2014 05:11:36. View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C4DT01890G may come from the hindered escape of adsorbed gases in the pores during the desorption 1 process for the kinetic diameters of N2 (3.64 Å) and CO2 (3.30 Å) which are close to the 2 pore sizes of 1; therefore, it shows a more obvious hysteresis feature for N2 desorption 3 due to its larger kinetic diameter. This is also the reason for the higher uptakes of CO2 4 than N2 usually observed in a microporous MOF. More interestingly, at 77 K and ambient 5 pressure, 1 exhibits much higher sorption selectivity for H2 than CO2 and N2. As shown 6 in Fig. 5, 1 adsorbs 93.3 cm3.g−1 H2 at 1 atm, which is moderately high and comparable to 7 values in recently reported porous MOFs.26 The observed hysteresis loop between the 8 adsorption and desorption processes indicates the global cooperative movement of the 9 frameworks in the entire crystal of 1. Similar adsorption isotherms of H2, N2 and CO2 10 were observed for others MOFs, which indicates that the intrinsic interframework 11 interaction rather than the specific host-guest interaction fairly contributes to the 12 gate-opening behavior26. High selectivity and good sorption capacity are crucial 13 parameters for a MOF as a gas separation material. 14 The computational method, based on Connolly's algorithm has already been described 15 and successfully used elsewhere14,27. Thanks to this method, porosity profile can be 16 calculated on the basis of the crystal structure. The compound exhibits quite sizeable 17 potential porosity. The channels that spread along the c axis can host guest molecules that 18 present a kinetic radius as large as 2.1Å (Figure S7). Smaller channels spread along the a 19 axis. The potential porosity has been calculated for several probe sphere radii that 20 correspond to different guest molecules kinetic radii (see Table S1).27e Difference 21 between experimental and simulated values can be attributed to an incomplete 22 de-solvation and/or a partial collapse of the crystal structure upon the de-solvation 23 process. 24 Before its use as a drug delivery carrier, polymer 1 was activated. Then, adsorption of 25 anticancer 5-FU was carried out by impregnating 1 under stirring in 5-FU containing 26 ethanol solutions. As evidenced by PXRD, 5-FU containing sample maintains its 27 crystallinity (Fig.S6). Incorporation of the drug molecule during adsorption process has 28 been confirmed by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Figure S8). The 29 characteristic peaks of 5-FU observed at 1724, and 1248 cm−1 can be attributed to the 30 stretching vibration of C=O, and C–N groups, respectively. The absorption bands of C–F 31 Page 9 of 22 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 September 2014. Downloaded by Heriot Watt University on 11/10/2014 05:11:36.

Furthermore, the shift of the 2 ν(C=O) band of the carboxylic group of 5-FU from 1677 to 1699 cm-1 correlated to those 3 of the vibrational band ν(O-H) of the polymer 1 from 3448 to 3415 cm-1, indicates the 4 formation of a hydrogen bond between the carboxylic group of 5-FU and the hydroxyl 5 group of water molecule of 1.3d,28 6 HPLC has been used to determine the effective 1 storage capacity. To reach a maximal 7 drug loading, 5-FU to porous solid, relative ratio and contact time were tested (Table S2). 8 It was observed that adsorbed amount of 5-FU increased with initial 5-FU/material ratio 9 expressed in weight and optimal value (2:1) corresponding to maximum solubility of 10 5-FU in ethanol. The contact time was also important. The maximum adsorption was 11 obtained after 5 days. Chemical analysis indicates that desolvated 1 adsorbs 0.275 g of 12 5-FU g−1 per gram of desolvated 1, which is little lower than the 5-FU loading in the 13 Cu(pi)-PEG5k reported by Zhou and co-workers.6 14 Drug-release experiments were carried out by dialyzing the drug-loaded 1 against 15 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer solution (pH 7.4) at room temperature and 16 measured by HPLC. A progressive release was observed with no “burst effect” (the burst 17 effect is normally taken as the high release rates that can be reached in the initial stages 18 after activation and is often regarded as a negative consequence of creating long-term 19 controlled release devices)29. The delivery of 5-FU occurred within 95hs and 61% of the 20 loaded drug was released (Fig. 6). Three stages related to the drug release could be 21 distinguished. Around 21% of the loaded drug was released in the first stage (11 h) and 22 51% was released in the later two stages. As mentioned in the structural analysis, one size 23 of nanoscale cage exists in 1 and the window is larger (10.5 Å x 10.7 Å) than the size of 24 the drug molecule (5.3 Å × 5.0 Å). For those drug molecules approaching the pore walls, 25 the interaction between Lewis acid sites in 1 and base sites in 5-FU may lead to this 26 relatively slow release. XRPD performed before and after 5-FU release shows that the 27 crystal structures are similar with each other (Fig.S6). 28 Molecular docking calculations22 were performed for the diketo and dienol forms of 29 5-FU into frameworks 1 and 2, and for the four tautomeric forms of 5-FU into framework 30 1 (Figure 7). 5-FU fits compactly into the framework pores where it interacts mostly with 31 Page 10 of 22 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 September 2014.

In framework 1, ligand 1 atoms (oxygen and nitrogen) and the metal Cu(II) surround the structural water molecules. 2 The clustering of highly charged atoms around these water molecules hinders interactions 3 between the latter and 5-FU. Indeed, the molecular docking calculations show that 5-FU 4 binds analogously to both frameworks regardless of the presence of structural water 5 molecules. This is consistent with the fact that the dimensions and chemical environment 6 of the pore nearly identical for 1 and 2 (Figure S9). The predominant conformations for 7 the four tautomeric forms of 5-FU exhibit hydrogen bonds between the protonated 8 heterocyclic nitrogen and/or hydroxyl groups in 5-FU and the carboxylate group in the 9 ligand (Figure 8b). In addition, we have investigated the preferred conformation of 5-FU 10 (diketo form) upon binding to MOF 1 when another 5-FU molecule is already bound in 11 the pore. The small size of the pore does not allow the π stacking of two 5-FU molecules. 12 Instead, two 5-FU molecules interact with each other in a linear fashion along the pore 13 channel via hydrogen bonds (Figure 9). In this conformation, two 5-FU molecules occupy 14 a surface of ca. 240 Å2 within the MOF pore. The predominant conformations for single 15 or multiple docked molecules favor hydrogen bond or electrostatic interactions with the 16 charged regions surrounding the Cu(II) (Figure 9). 17 Conclusion 18 Two isoreticular metal–organic frameworks showing CdSO4 (65.8) topology have been 19 rational designed using two different linkages. 1 shows high selectivity for H2 over N2 20 and CO2 at low pressure. Moreover, 1 has been evaluated as potential carrier for the 21 adsorption and delivery of anticancer 5-FU. Our results show that 1 adsorbs 0.275 g of 22 5-FU g − 1 per gram of desolvated 1, with a progressive release of the drug without any 23 “burst effect”. The kinetics of 5-FU follows well-defined pattern: 21% of the loaded drug 24 is released in the first 11 h, and 51% is released in two slower stages. Molecular docking 25 calculations suggest that 5-FU molecules fit snugly into the pores of 1, therefore 26 providing an explanation for the slow release of 5-FU from 1. It is suggested interactions 27 between Lewis acid sites in 1 and base sites in 5-FU may lead to the slow release of 28 5-FU. 29 Acknowledgments 30 This work was partially supported by the Grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of 31 Page 11 of 22 Dalton Transactions Dalton Transactions Accepted Manuscript Published on 01 September 2014.

Soaresd*, Ren-Feie* Carole Daiguebonnef, Olivier Guillouf*, Ng, Seik Wengg The present work reports on two isoreticular metal–organic frameworks. The drug load and release capacity of these MOFs were evaluated using the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as a model. We have also investigated the binding mode of 5-FU to these frameworks, which provides an atom-level view of host-guest interactions.

Drug Loading To load 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) into the pores of 1, dehydrated 1 (10 mg) was dispersed in a 5-FU (20 mg) containing ethanol solution (5 mL) and stirred for 5 days yielding homogenous light solution, followed by centrifugation and washing extensively with DMSO to obtain the drug-loaded 1. The adsorbed amount of 5-Fu into the porous solids was estimated by HPLC, and FTIR. Determination of the 5-Fluorouracil Content Optimisation of 5-Fu adsorption Table S2.

The as-prepared 5-FU- loaded 1 was dispersed in 500 mL PBS (pH 7.4). The release mediums was placed into pretreated semi permeable dialysis bags and then immersed into 5 mL PBS at 37 °C with gentle shaking. At certain time intervals, 5-FU concentration moved out of semi-premeable dialysis dag into water was measured by HPLC.
