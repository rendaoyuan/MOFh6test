Their structures contain two kinds of four-connected uniform nets: dia and mdf nets. The mdf net is a new chiral 86 net with the long vertex symbol (81.83.84.84.84.84). In recent years, the design and synthesis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been of great interest due to not only their potential applications but also their intriguing versatile architectures and new topologies.1,2 The network topological approach deﬁned by Wells is an important and essential aspect of the analysis, comparison and design of MOFs by reducing multidimensional structures to simple node-and-connection reference nets.3 To date, a large numbers of topologies have been reported in MOFs.4 Among these networks, there is a particularly fundamental class called uniform nets. In these networks, the shortest circuits are all of the same size, such as 103-srs, 103-ths, 66-dia.5 Many examples with uniform nets have been reported, however, the four-connected 86 uniform net is very infrequent and only three examples have been made so far.6 Here, we describe an 86 mdf uniform net which is diﬀerent from the reported ones. Interpenetration is an interesting phenomenon in topology.7 Although a large number of frameworks with various structure motifs have been reported, the architectures formed by two diﬀerent motifs are still less well investigated.8 Some mixed-motif interpenetrating networks such as 1-/2-D inclined interpenetration, 1-/3-D interpenetration, 2-/3-D parallel interpenetration, 2-/2-D inclined interpenetration of (4,4) and (6,3) sheets, 3-/3-D interpenetration of two diamond nets and one NbO net have been described in two comprehensive reviews by Batten and Robson.1a,9 However, the 3-/3-D inter- penetration of diﬀerent uniform nets has never been reported. In this paper, we report two novel 3-D heterometallic MOFs, [LnCuL4][Ln0.25Cu0.25L] (Ln = Dy 1, Er 2; HL = 4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoic acid). Both of them are three-fold interpenetrated frameworks of one 66 dia uniform net and two 86 mdf uniform nets. The mdf net is a new four-connected 86 net. Orange crystals of 1 and red crystals of 2 were hydro- thermally synthesized by mixing Ln2O3, CuCl22H2O and HL in water.z Single crystal X-ray diﬀraction studyy shows they are isomorphous, therefore, only the structure 1 is discussed in detail. 1 crystallizes in tetragonal space group I4. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of two distinct polymeric motifs (Fig. 1). One motif (motif I) contains one Dy1, one Cu1 and four L ligands; the other motif (motif II) contains one Dy2, one Cu2 and one L ligand. Both Dy2 and Cu2 are located in four-fold axis. Dy1 and Dy2 are eight-coordinated and have bicapped trigonal prismatic geometries built by eight carboxylate oxygen atoms (OCOO) of four L ligands (Dy–O 2.338(4)–2.425(4) A˚ ). Cu1 and Cu2 are four-coordinated by four N atoms of four L ligands, resulting in distorted tetrahedral geometries (Cu–N 1.995(4)–2.182(4) A˚ ). All L act as m2-bridging ligands which link one Dy3+ ion via two OCOO atoms in a bidentate mode and one Cu+ ion by an N atom in a monodentate mode. The Dy3+ and Cu+ ions in two motifs are bridged by L ligands in this simple mode to produce two kinds of 3-D networks and then these networks are interpenetrated together to form a intricate and intriguing entangled architecture. In motif I, the most striking features are the connections between Dy3+ and Cu+ ions by L ligands to form a unprecedented 3-D network with chiral channels and two types of helical tubes constructed from interweaving triple- helical chains and double-helical chains, respectively (Fig. 2a). In left- and right-handed [DyLCu]n helical chains, the distance between Dy3+ and Cu+ range from 13.20 to 13.43 A˚ which is less than the length of the ligand. As shown in Fig. 2b, three left-handed helical chains enlace together to form a helical tube with small square channel along the c-axis. The diagonal length of the square channel is 8.37 A˚ . Furthermore, the Fig. 1 View of the two motifs in the asymmetric unit of 1. a State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002, China.

Commun., 2010, 46, 8216–8218 8217 parallel helical tubes are linked by L ligands along the a and b axes. Followed this process, another type of helical tubes are formed, i.e. two right-handed helical chains interweaved to produce a helical tube with a rectangular channel, in which the diagonal lengths are 17.58 and 14.21 A˚ (Fig. 2c). In addition a left-handed large square channel is surrounded by four of each kind of the helical tubes, with diagonal length of about 17.54 A˚ (Fig. 2d). Owing to the large voids in this motif, double equivalent networks interpenetrate to maintain the stability of the whole structure. Since each Dy3+ ion links to four adjacent Cu+ ions through four L ligands, and vice versa, the topological analysis approach can be employed to understand the intricate structure better. Thus, each Dy3+ and Cu+ act as a four-connected node (Fig. S1, ESIw) and further link to four nearest neighbors with distances of 13.20–13.43 A˚ through four L ligands, and the overall 3-D framework can be rationalized as a four- connected 86 uniform mdf net with the long vertex symbol 81.83.84.84.84.84 (Fig. 3a). So far, only three 86 nets have been reported (with long vertex symbols 82.82.85.85.85.85 6a,b and 86.86.87.87.87.87 6c). When considering either the structural characteristics of the helical tubes or the interpenetration mode the mdf net here completely diﬀers from those reported previously (Fig. 3b). In motif II, the connection between the center ions and the ligands is the same as for motif I. However, all the Dy  Cu lengths are 13.35 A˚ . This porous structure based on single [DyLCu]n helical chains is more straightforward than that of motif I. The neighbouring helical channels display opposite chirality, so motif II is achiral (Fig. 4). Similarly, every Dy3+ and Cu+ ions can be considered as a four-connected node, and further link each other to form a common 66 dia net with the long vertex symbol 62.62.62.62.62.62 10 (Fig. 5), which is also a uniform net with the unique nodes and the shortest circuits. Two mdf nets and one dia net intertwine jointly to give the integral architecture of compound 1 (Fig. 6a). The characteristic structural feature of 1 is self-penetration which is intricate and multiple (Fig. 6b). As shown in Fig. 7, the helical tubes of the mdf nets are bundled by the single helical chains of the dia net, leading to a unprecedented three-fold interpenetrated framework. The luminescent properties of 1, 2 and the HL ligand have been explored at room temperature in the solid state (Fig. 2). 1 and 2 show broad ﬂuorescent emission spectra from 500 to 700 nm. The intense emission occurring around 600 and 650 nm for 1 and 2, diﬀerent from the emission of the ligand, which may be attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer. There are no emission bands from the Dy3+ and Er3+ ions indicating that HL is not a good sensitizer to the Dy3+ and Er3+ emission, i.e., the HL does not sensitize the luminescence of Dy3+ and Er3+ ions. In summary, we have successfully synthesized and characterized the ﬁrst three-fold interpenetrated framework with two kinds of four-connected uniform nets: dia net and mdf net. The mdf net is a new chiral 86 net with the long vertex symbol 81.83.84.84.84.84. It is a 3-D network with achiral channels and two types of helical tubes constructed from interweaving triple-helical chains and double-helical chains, respectively. One dia net and two mdf nets interpenetrate to lead to the overall unprecedented architecture of 1 and 2. Fig. 2 (a) View of the 3-D framework of motif I with square channels.
