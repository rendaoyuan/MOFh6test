By regulating the different auxiliary ligands, central metal ions, and some other synthetic conditions, 4,4′- H2dbpt revised various coordination modes. Consequently, 1 revise a 2D (3, 6)-topology, with (43)3(46.66.83)2 Schläfli symbol. 2 show a 3D 8- connected topology with (36.418.53.6) Schläfli symbol. 3 and 4 which are isostructural, both have a 2D 4- connected topology, with (44.62) Schläfli symbol. 5 have a complex 3D porous architecture with a 1D solvent-filled channel. 6 reveal a 1D helical chain extended along a quad screw axis. These results indicate that 4,4′- H2dbpt is an excellent multi- connection linker to construct MOFs with interesting structures and properties.

View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C5RA06273J molecular chemistry and crystal engineering, not only owing to their appealing structural and topological novelty but also because of their tremendous potential applications in gas storage and separation,[1] electrical conduction,[2] luminescence materials,[3] molecular magnets, [4] and heterogeneous catalysis.[5] Thus, a series of studies in this field have mainly focused on the design and preparation, as well as the structure–property relationships.[6] The structures of coordination polymers are determined by several factors, including the coordination geometry of the central metal ions, solvents,[7] ligand structure, metal-ligand ratio,[8] counterions,[9] pH,[10] temperature,[11] and so on. Among the reported studies, much effort has been focused on the rational design and controlled synthesis of coordination polymers using multidentate ligands such as polycarboxylate and N- heterocyclic ligands. The N-heterocyclic ligands are good molecular building blocks and co- ligands for constructing MOFs with interesting structures and properties, which have been widely reported by Yaghi,[12] Snurr,[13] Chen,[14] Du,[15] Tong,[16] Zhang,[17] etc. Our groups have systematically explored the coordination assemblies on the basis of some polycarboxylate ligands cooperate with some angular N-heterocyclic-like ligands: 1H-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (4,4′-bpt), 1H-3-(3-pyridyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (3,4′-bpt), 1H-3,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (3,3′-bpt), 4- amino-3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (4,4′-abpt), 1,4-bis(5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)benzene (bptb), etc. [18] In most of the cases, the angular N-heterocyclic-like ligands act as 2- connected linkers with different distortion angles and directions. Relying on the versatile coordination modes of the polycarboxylate ligands, a variety of structures were obtained. Recently, various compounds with complex topology based on some ditriazole- pyridine ligand, have been reported by Hou,[19] Li,[20] Sha,[21] and Zhou,[22] etc. And these ligands revised various conformations, highlighting they are another excellent multi- connection linkers in addition to polycarboxylate ligands.[23] Thus, these considerations inspired us to explore new coordination frameworks with this kind of ligands.

View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C5RA06273J In this paper, we introduce a new ditriazole- pyridine ligand: 5,5'-di(pyridin-4-yl)-3,3'-bi(1,2,4-triazole) (4,4′- H2dbpt). Different with our previous N-heterocyclic-like ligands, chelate effect between the adjacent triazole rings was introduced. Thus, it could adopt various conformations, which may lead to unpredictable and interesting structures, by regulating the rotation angles of the four aromatic rings with respect to each other, the deprotonation effert (4,4′- H2dpbt, 4,4′- Hdpbt-, 4,4′- dpbt2-) and the flexing angles. However, to the best of our knowledge, MOFs based on 5,5'-di(pyridin-4-yl)-3,3'-bi(1,2,4-triazole) (4,4′- H2dbpt) have never been documented to date. A series of coordination polymers based on 4,4′- H2dbpt, namely, {[Co5(4,4′-dbpt)2Cl8]• 2(C2H5)3NH}n (1), {[Co3(p-BDC)2(4,4′-dbpt)• 0.5CH3OH]}n (2), {[Co(4,4′-Hdbpt)2]• H2O}n (3), {[Ni(4,4′-Hdbpt)2]• H2O}n (4), {[Cu2(4,4′-dbpt)]• H2O}n (5), {[Mn(4,4′-dbpt)(H2O)2]• 2H2O}n (6) were constructed successfully. By regulating the different auxiliary ligands, central metal ions, etc, 4,4′- H2dbpt revised five different coordination modes (scheme 1) based on the alteration of the rotation angles, valence state and the flexing angles. As a result, 1- 6 revised five different (3 and 4 are isostructural) architectures with diversiform connectivity from one to three dimensional. Scheme 1 Experimental Section Materials and Physical Measurements With the exception of the ligand of 4,4′- H2dbpt which was prepared according to the literature procedure,[24] all reagents and solvents for synthesis and analysis were commercially available and used as received. IR spectra were taken on a Perkin-Elmer spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer in the 4000-400 cm-1 region with KBr pellets. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were carried out on a Model 2400 II, Perkin-Elmer elemental analyzer.

View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C5RA06273J X-ray Crystallographic Determination All reflection data were collected on an Agilent Supernova diffractometer (Mo, λ = 0.71073Å) at room temperature. A semiempirical absorption correction by using the SADABS program was applied, and the raw data frame integration was performed with SAINT[25]. The crystal structures were solved by the direct method using the program SHELXS-97[26] and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method on F2 for all non-hydrogen atoms using SHELXL-97[27] with anisotropic thermal parameters. All hydrogen atoms were located in calculated positions and refined isotropically, except the hydrogen atoms of water molecules were fixed in a difference Fourier map and refined isotropically. The details of the crystal data were summarized in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and angles for compounds 1−6 are listed in Table S1. The crystallographic data of 1– 6 in CIF format has been deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC reference number: 1033515-1033520). XRPD Results To confirm whether the crystal structures are truly representative of the bulk materials, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) experiments have also been carried out for 1- 6. The XRPD experimental and computer- simulated patterns of the corresponding complexes are shown in ESI, Figure S2. Although the experimental patterns have a few unindexed diffraction lines and some are slightly broadened in comparison with those simulated from the single crystal models, it can still be considered favorably that the bulk synthesized materials and the as-grown crystals are homogeneous for 1- 6.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the asymmetric unit of 1 contains three crystallographically independent Co atoms, one 4,4′- dbpt2- anionic, four Cl- anionic, and one lattice protonated triethylamine ion. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, Co1 is coordinated by two N atoms (N6, N3A, symmetry codes: A: x, y, z+1) from two 4,4′- dbpt ligands, and two Cl atoms (Cl1, Cl2), to yield distorted tetrahedron geometry. Co3 also adopts a distorted tetrahedron geometry coordinated by two N atoms (N1C, N8D, C: −x+1, −y+1, −z+1; D: x, y, z−1) from two 4,4′- dbpt ligands, one µ2-Cl (Cl3) atom and one terminal Cl atom (Cl4). While Co2 lying on a symmetry center adopts a distorted octahedron geometry coordinated by four N atoms (N4, N5, N4A, N5A) from two 4,4′- dbpt ligands in the equatorial plane, and two µ2-Cl atoms (Cl3, Cl3A) in the axial position. The middle Co2 ion is linked to terminal Co1 and Co3 ions with two triazoles from two 4,4′- dbpt ligands (Co1… Co2= 3.788 (2) Å) and one µ2-Cl- (Co2… Co3= 4.493 (2) Å) respectively to form a Co5 unit (Fig. 1b). The adjacent Co5 units share vertices (Co3) and connect each other, to form a 2D ladder structure (Fig. 1c). The lattice protonated triethylamine ions fill in the gaps of the neighbor 2D layers which arrange parallelly each other (Fig. 1d). A topological analysis reveals that the Co5 unit and the shared vertices Co3 serve as a 6- connected node and 3- connected node respectively to link each other. According to Wells' topology definition,[28] an interesting topology with the short Schläfli symbol of (43)3(46.66.83)2 is formed (Fig. 1e). Fig. 1 {[Co3(p-BDC)2(4,4′-dbpt)• 0.5CH3OH]}n (2). The asymmetric unit of 2 contains two crystallographically independent Co atoms, half a 4,4′- dbpt2-, one p-BDC anionic, and a quarter lattice methanol molecule. As illustrated in Fig. 2, 2 reveals a novel 3D coordination polymer with a linear trinuclear Co(II) unit.

View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C5RA06273J middle Co1 ions lying on a symmetry center exhibit a distorted octahedron geometry coordinated by four O atoms (O1, O3, O1A, O3A, A: −x+1, −y+1, −z+1) from four p-BDC ligands in the equatorial plane, and two N atoms (N3B, N3C, B: −x, −y+1, −z+1; C: x+1, y, z) from two dbpt ligands in the axial position. The terminal Co2 ions exhibit a distorted trigonal- dipyramidal geometry, which is provided by surround by two N atoms (N2C, N4D, D: −x, −y, −z+1) from two 4,4′- dbpt ligands in the axial position, two O atoms (O2A, O4A) from two p-BDC ligands and one N atom (N4D, D: −x, −y, −z+1) from 4,4′- dbpt ligand in the equatorial plane. The middle Co1 ion is linked to terminal Co2 ions with two syn– syn carboxylate from two p-BDC ligands and a triazole from 4,4′- dbpt [Co… Co= 4.008 (5) Å] to form the Co3 unit. The adjacent Co3 units are connected by 4,4′- dbpt2- with mode 2 (Scheme 1) to form a 2D layer (Fig. 2b). The layer is further connected by p-BDC pillars to generate a 3D open framework with a 1D solvent-filled channel which diameter is about 9 Å (Fig. 2d). Better insight into this framework can be achieved by topology analysis. The Co3 unit serves as an 8- connected node, p-BDC and 4,4′- dbpt both serves as linker. In this way, this framework can be simplified to be an 8 -connected 3D architecture with the short Schläfli symbol of (36.418.53.6) is formed (Fig. 2e). Fig. 2 {[M(4,4′-dbpt)2]• 2H2O}n (M= Co for 3, Ni for 4). Compounds 3 and 4 are isostructural with an identical space group and similar cell dimensions. As shown in Fig. 3a, there is only one independent M atom in the asymmetric unit. All the M ions lying on a symmetry center exhibit a distorted octahedron geometry coordinated by four triazole N atoms (N4, N5, N4B, N5B, B: x+1/2, −y−1/2, z−1/2) from two 4,4′- Hdbpt- ions in the equatorial plane, and two pyridine N atoms (N8A, N8C, A: −x+1, −y, −z+2; C: −x+1/2, y+1/2, −z+5/2) from two 4,4′- Hdbpt- ions in the axial position. The adjacent M ions are connected by 4,4′- Hdbpt- with mode 3 (Scheme 1) with the separation of 10.56 (1) Å for 3 and 10.54 (1) Å for 4, to form a 2D layer (Fig. 2b). And the neighbor 2D layers arrange parallelly each other (Fig. 3c). The distance of the Page 9 of 27 RSC Advances RSC Advances Accepted Manuscript Published on 18 May 2015.

The M ion serves as a 4- connected node, and 4,4′- Hdbpt- serves as a linker. As a result, this framework can be simplified to be a 4 -connected 2D architecture with the short Schläfli symbol of (44.62) is formed (Fig. 3d). Fig. 3 {[Cu2(4,4′-dbpt)]• H2O}n (5). The asymmetric unit of 5 contains three crystallographically independent Cu atoms, one 4,4′- dbpt2-, and a lattice water molecule. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, Cu1 is coordinated by four N atoms (N1, N1A, N7B, N6C, Symmetry codes: A: −x, y, −z+1/2; B: −x+1/2, y−1/2, z; C: x−1/2, y−1/2, −z+1/2) from four 4,4′- dbpt ligands, to yield distorted tetrahedron geometry. Cu2 lying on a symmetry site is two- coordinated, which is provided by two triazole N donors (N4, N4D, D: −x+1, y, −z+3/2; (v) x, −y+1, z+1/2) from two 4,4′- dbpt ligands. The distance of Cu2- N5 is 2.913 (2) Å, indicating a weak coordination interaction between them. Cu3 adopt plane triangle configuration which is coordinated by three N atoms (N3, N6E, N8F, E: x, −y+1, z+1/2; F: x−1/2, y−1/2, −z+3/2) from three 4,4′- dbpt ligands. The 4,4′- dbpt ligand adopt mode 4 (Scheme 1) connect Cu(I) atoms to fotm a 3D reticular structure with a 1D solvent-filled channel which diameter is about 7 Å (Fig. 4b, c).

All the Mn atoms exhibit a distorted octahedron geometry coordinated by four triazole N atoms (N1, N1A, N3B, N3C, Symmetry codes: A: −x+1/2, y, −z; B: −y+1/4, −x+1/4, −z+1/4; C: y+1/4, −x+1/4, z−1/4) from two 4,4′- dbpt ligands, and two water molecules (O1, O1A). The adjacent Mn atoms are connected by 4,4′- dbpt2- with mode 5 (Scheme 1) with the separation of 5.9493 (9) Å to form a quadruple helical chain extended along the c axis (Fig. 5b).

Among them, 1, 3, 4 form 2D layer architectures, 2 and 5 form 3D network architectures, and 6 forms 1D chain architecture with diversiform connectivity. Clearly, the phenomenon of structural diversification in 1− 6 may arise from the three sources as follow. First of all, the 4,4′- H2dbpt ligand plays a dominating effect on constructing the polymer structures. Owing to the different rotation angles of the four aromatic rings with respect to each other, deprotonation effert (4,4′- H2dpbt, 4,4′- Hdpbt-, 4,4′- dpbt2-) and the flexing angles, it could adopt various conformations, which may lead to unpredictable and interesting structures. In this paper, the 4,4′- H2dbpt ligand adopts five different conformations (Scheme 1) according to the geometric requirements of metal ions and/or the introduction of auxiliary ligand. Secondly, the introduction of auxiliary ligands may play significant roles in the formation of different topological structures. Compound 3 without auxiliary ligand, revealed a 2D 4- connected topology, with (44.62) Schläfli symbol. For 1, Cl- is involved in coordination. As a result, a more complex 2D ladder structure based on a Co5 unit with the short Schläfli symbol of (43)3(46.66.83)2 is formed. For 2, with the employment of H2p-BDC, an 8- connected 3D pillared layered architecture with the short Schläfli symbol of (36.418.53.6) is formed. Thirdly, different metal ions may have different charges, electron configurations, and ionic radii, hence exhibiting different Page 11 of 27 RSC Advances RSC Advances Accepted Manuscript Published on 18 May 2015.

So the connectivity of polymeric frameworks is also strongly related to the metal centers. In 5, Cu(I) exhibit the coexistence of two, three and four – coordinated patterns which is different from others. And hence, a complex 3D architecture is formed. Magnetic Properties Magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out on polycrystalline samples of 1- 4 and 6 in the temperature range 2.0−300.0 K at 1000 Oe. (Fig 6a and 7) For 1, the data above 50 K follow the Curie–Weiss law with C = 10.81 cm3Kmol-1 and θ = -22.35 K. The χMT value at 300 K is 10.12 cm3·K·mol-1, which is larger than the spin-only value 9.38 emu·K·mol-1 for five magnetically active Co(II) ions (S = 3/2, g = 2.0), as expected for Co(II) systems with a significant contribution from the effects of spin-orbital coupling. As the temperature is lowered, the χMT values decrease continuously and reaches a local minimum of 5.98 cm3·K·mol-1 at about 12 K, indicative of a strong single-ion behavior admixture with a weak antiferromagnetic interaction [29]. And then increases slightly to reach a maximum at ca. 8.0 K, and then rapidly decreases to a minimum of 2.29 cm3·K·mol-1 at 2 K. The observed increase in χMT below this temperature is no longer coming from the single- ion behaviour but rather from a ferromagnetic or canted antiferromagnetic Co(II)– Co(II) exchange interaction, and the finally decreases in χMT below 10 K, indicating a magnetic phase transition. The dependence of χMT vs. T curves of 1 at different fields is pronounced at low-temperature, the larger increase of χMT values at a small field (Figure 6b). This is an important feature of spin- canting behavior.[30] The zero-field ac susceptibility data of 1 shows obvious peaks and slight frequency-dependence (Fig. 6d, inset) below 8 K, which confirms the magnetic phase transition. And the shift of peak temperature (Tp) of χM" for 1 was measured by a parameter ø= ∆Tp/ [Tp ∆(log f)]≈ 0.06, being in the range of spin glass systems.[31] And the relaxation time τ0 was obtained from the Arrhenius law; the best set of parameters is τ0= 2.53× 10–18 s and ∆E/kB= 201.55 K (Fig 6d), where ∆E is the energy Page 12 of 27 RSC Advances RSC Advances Accepted Manuscript Published on 18 May 2015.

Fig. 6 For 2, the data above 2 K follow the Curie–Weiss law with C = 7.48 cm3·K·mol-1 and θ = -18.35 K. The χMT value at 300 K is 7.05 cm3·K·mol-1, which is larger than the spin-only value 5.63 cm3·K·mol-1 for three magnetically active Co(II) ions (S = 3/2, g = 2.0), as expected for Co(II) systems with a significant contribution from the effects of spin-orbital coupling. As the temperature is lowered, the χMT values decrease continuously and reaches a local minimum of 1.01 cm3·K·mol-1 at about 2 K, indicative of a strong single-ion behavior admixture with a weak antiferromagnetic interaction. For 3, the data above 2 K follow the Curie– Weiss law with C = 3.01 cm3·K·mol-1 and θ = -12.47 K. The χMT value at 300 K is 2.89 cm3·K·mol-1, which is much larger than the spin-only value 1.88 cm3·K·mol-1 for a magnetically active Co(II) ion (S = 3/2, g = 2.0), as expected for Co(II) systems with a significant contribution from the effects of spin-orbital coupling. As the temperature is lowered, the χMT values decrease continuously and reaches a local minimum of 0.61 cm3·K·mol-1 at about 2 K, indicative of a strong single-ion behavior. The distance of the nearest Co atoms in 3 is 9.25 (1) Å, indicating that the weak interactions between them could be ignored. The in- and out of- phase ac susceptibilities have no dependence on frequency between 2 and 10 K for 3 indicating that there is no single-ion magnet (SIM) behavior in 3. (Fig S3) For 4, the data above 2 K follow the Curie–Weiss law with C = 1.33 cm3·K·mol-1 and θ = -1.94 K. The χMT value at 300 K is 1.32 cm3·K·mol-1, which is slightly larger than the spin-only value 1.21 cm3·K·mol-1 for a magnetically active Ni(II) ion (S = 1, g = 2.2), and is relatively constant down to approximately 40 K. Below this temperature, it collapses, indicating significant ZFS in the S = 1 ground state. [32] Page 13 of 27 RSC Advances RSC Advances Accepted Manuscript Published on 18 May 2015.

(Fig S3) For 6, the data above 2 K follow the Curie–Weiss law with C = 4.73 cm3·K·mol-1 and θ = -4.70 K. The χMT value at 300 K is 4.65 cm3·K·mol-1, which is slightly larger than the spin-only value 4.38 cm3·K·mol-1 for a magnetically active Mn(II) ion (S = 5/2, g = 2.2), and is relatively constant down to approximately 30 K.

Conclusions In this paper, we have presented the synthesis and crystal structures of six new MOFs from one to three dimensions, based on the 4,4′- H2dbpt ligand. The structural diversities indicate that the 4,4′- H2dbpt ligand could adopt different conformations according to the geometric requirements of metal ions and/or the introduction of auxiliary ligand owing to the different rotation angles of the four aromatic rings with respect to each other, deprotonation effert (4,4′- H2dpbt, 4,4′- Hdpbt-, 4,4′- dpbt2-) and the flexing angles. As a result, five diverse and interesting architectures was obtained: 1 have a 2D (3, 6)-topology, with (43)3(46.66.83)2 Schläfli symbol. 2 have a 3D 8- connected topology with (36.418.53.6) Schläfli symbol. 3 and 4 which are isostructural, both have a 2D 4- connected topology, with (44.62) Schläfli symbol. 5 have a complex 3D porous architecture with a 1D solvent-filled channel. 6 reveal a 1D helical chain extended along a quad screw axis. Accordingly, our present findings will further Page 15 of 27 RSC Advances RSC Advances Accepted Manuscript Published on 18 May 2015. Downloaded by Dalhousie University on 18/05/2015 13:19:07.
