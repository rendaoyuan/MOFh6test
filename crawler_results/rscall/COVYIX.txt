The former three entities are three- dimensional (3D) robust frameworks with a (44·62)(411·65)2(413·610·85) topological net containing centro- symmetric CuII 7 clusters, square-planar CuII 1 cores and tetratopic btec4−linkers for 1, a pillared-layered structure consisting of CuII 5 + CuII 1-based coplanar layers and ditopic tp2−pillars for 2 as well as a micro- porous architecture derived from CuII 5 clusters and directional ip2−connectors for 3. In contrast, complex 4 exhibits an undulated two-dimensional (2D) layer with alternating CuII 4 + CuII 1 chains interconnected by anionic pa2−connectors. Crystallographically, the increment of the local nuclearity from CuII 4 up to CuII 7 in 1–4 beneﬁts greatly from the synergistic co-coordination of the hydroxyl group and the coplanar ta− ligand towards the metal ion, and the interlayer/interchain compactness is signiﬁcantly tuned by the posi- tion isomerism of the dicarboxylate moieties. Due to the antiferromagnetic coupling in the local clusters and the asymmetric superexchange by μ3-ta−mediator, these complexes exhibit diﬀerent spin ground states (paramagnetic S = 1 and 1/2, ferrimagnetic S = 1/2 as well as spin canting) at low temperatures, which are informative for polynuclear-based magnetic materials. Introduction Polynuclear metal cluster-based coordination polymers (CPs) have always attracted great interest due to their intriguing structures,1 higher connectivity and stability2–5 as well as tai- lorable chemical and physical properties in adsorption,6,7 magnetism8 and catalysis.9,10 Synthetically speaking, two feas- ible and eﬀective approaches have been extensively applied for the successful construction of targeted CPs. One is the design and synthesis of novel bifunctional ligands with compartmen- tal coordination sites and appropriately programmed co- ordination information responsible simultaneously for core aggregation and backbone extension,11–13 which requires subtle modifications, skillful techniques and synthetic chemists with abundant experience. The other one is a mixed- ligand strategy of combining two or more commercially avail- able chemicals with dense multiple metal binding sites for nuclearity increase and separate functional groups for intercore connectivity, which is simple and comparatively restricted.14–18 Acting as a popular ligand containing three sequent N donors in a coplanar five-membered heterocyclic ring, 1H-1,2,3-triazole (Hta) has gradually become one of the ideal candidates †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Selected bond lengths and angles, additional figures, PXRD patterns, TG curves, magnetic results and X-ray crystallographic files in CIF format for 1–4.

View Article Online View Journal | View Issue for the generation of pentanuclear metal clusters.19–23 Var- iously recurrent metal ion-centered MZn4 tetrahedron subunits (M = Zn, Ru, Cd, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu)21,22,24 and hourglass-like MII 5 clusters (M = Zn, Cu and Co) composed of two corner-sharing triangles25–29 have been previously obtained in the triazolate-based assembly systems by varying the central metal ions and reaction conditions. In particular, the conformation-flexible CuII 5 clusters can act as predesigned secondary building blocks to take part in the ongoing reaction processes in a ternary CuII-triazolate-sulfoisophthalate system, resulting in unexpected two-fold interpenetrating, pillared-layers and (4,8)-connected architectures by a slight expansion of the cluster and variable intercluster connec- tivity.19 Undoubtedly, the three consecutive N donors and the sterically unencumbered coplanar skeleton of the ta−anion become the key structural factors for the formation of diverse clusters. Acting as a polytopic connector, on the other hand, aro- matic polycarboxylate is capable of connecting the structural motifs locally into an extended network with intriguing and unexpected linkages. The number and position of the carboxy- late group attached on the phenyl ring can essentially deter- mine the dimensionality and topological structure of the resulting complexes.30,31 However, the orienting and isomeric eﬀects from the functional polycarboxylate groups have been scarcely investigated so far. Herein, due to our continued inter- est in the magnetostructural relationships of Hta-based poly- metallic cluster-derived CPs, self-assembly reactions of inorganic CuII sources and Hta in the presence of carboxylate- functionalized coligands with diﬀerent numbers and positions were performed under controllable hydrothermal conditions. As a result, four interesting centrosymmetric CuII n cluster (n = 4, 5, and 7)-based CPs including three 3D frameworks and one 2D layer were successfully obtained and characterized struc- turally and magnetically. Complex 1 is a complicated 4, 6, 8-tri- nodal topological net constructed from a centrosymmetric CuII 7 cluster, a square-planar CuII 1 node and tetratopic btec4− linkers, 2 has a pillared-layered architecture consisting of alter- nating CuII 5 + CuII 1 cores and anionic tp2−connectors and 3 exhibits a microporous structure constructed from two unique CuII 5 cluster-based coplanar layers and directional ip2−pillars. In contrast, complex 4 features an undulated 2D layer with a CuII 4 + CuII 1 chain interconnected by bidirectional pa2−con- nectors. Structurally, the increase of the core-number from four to seven and variations in the core-topology are significant results of the synergistic co-coordination of the hydroxyl group and 1,2,3-triazolate towards the metal ion, and the interchain/ interlayer compactness is significantly tuned by the position isomerism of the dicarboxylate moieties. More inter- estingly, dominant antiferromagnetic couplings in the centro- symmetric CuII n clusters lead to diﬀerent spin ground states (paramagnetic S = 1 and 1/2 for 1 and 4, ferrimagnetic S = 1/2 for 3 as well as spin canting for 2) at low temperatures. These significant results are helpful and informative for the design and preparation of polynuclear metal cluster-based CPs. Experimental Materials and instruments All initial chemicals were commercially purchased (Hta, 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid (H4btec), terephthalic acid (H2tp), isophthalic acid (H2ip) and phthalic acid (H2pa) were from Acros and other analytical-grade reagents were from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Factory) and used as received without further purification. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were carried out with a CE-440 (Leeman-Labs) analyzer. Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra (KBr pellets) were recorded using an Avatar-370 (Nicolet) spectrometer in the range 4000–400 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiment was performed using a Shimadzu simultaneous DTG-60A com- positional analysis instrument from room temperature to 800 °C under an N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diﬀractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA for Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), with a scan speed of 0.1 s per step and a step size of 0.01° in 2θ. The simulated PXRD pattern was calculated using single-crystal X-ray diﬀrac- tion data and processed using the free Mercury v1.4 program provided by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center. Magnetic susceptibilities were acquired using a Quantum Design (SQUID) magnetometer MPMS-XL-7 with crystalline samples, in which the phase purity of the samples was deter- mined by PXRD experiments. Diamagnetic corrections were esti- mated from Pascal’s constants for all constituent atoms, and an experimental correction for the sample holder was also applied.

X-Ray data collection and structure determination Diﬀraction intensities for 1–4 were collected using a Bruker APEX-II QUAZAR diﬀractometer equipped with graphite-mono- chromated Mo Kα radiation with a radiation wavelength of 0.71073 Å by using the φ–ω scan technique at 173 (for 1 and 4) and 296 K (for 2 and 3), respectively. There was no evidence of crystal decay during data collection. Semiempirical multiscan absorption corrections were applied using SADABS32 and the program SAINT33 was used for integration of the diﬀraction profiles. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined with the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 programs.34 Anisotropic thermal parameters were assigned to all non-H atoms. Organic hydro- gen atoms were geometrically generated. H atoms attached to water molecules were located from diﬀerence maps and refined with isotropic temperature factors. The position of the highest peak in 1 is at (0.3498, 0.1150, 0.7408), 0.90 Å from Cu2, and the position of the deepest hole is at (0.4406, 0.9759, 0.2994), 0.87 Å from Cu2. The position of the highest peak in 2 is at (0.0733, 0.7099, 0.9627), 0.40 Å from N7, and the position of the deepest hole is at (0.0800, 0.4075, 0.5158), 1.03 Å from Cu4. The high residual density of 2 is due to the disorder of the ta−ligand. The position of the highest peak in 3 is at (0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000), 1.86 Å from O6, and the position of the deepest hole is at (0.5594, 0.6774, 0.2596), 0.97 Å from Cu6. The possible reason for the high residual density of 3 is due to the crystal defect. Centrosymmetric tp2−and one ta− ligands in 2 were positionally disordered and varied between two symmetry-related positions with the site occupancy refined to 0.496 and 0.504, as well as 0.737 and 0.263, respecti- vely. One free water molecule (O5) in 2 was also positionally disordered with the site occupancy refined to 0.25. Three O atoms of lattice water molecules (O4 in 2, as well as O11 and O12 in 3) were varied between two positions with the site occu- pancies of 0.51 for O4, 0.53 for O11, 0.46 for O12, as well as 0.49 for O4′, 0.47 for O11′, 0.54 for O12′. No hydrogen atom was located for the disordered water molecule. Crystallo- graphic data and structural refinement are given in Table 1. Results and discussion Syntheses and FT-IR spectra Complexes 1–4 were hydrothermally obtained, in which the anions of inorganic metal salt (Cl−for 1, NO3 −for 2 and OAc− for both 3 and 4) and the pH value (pH = 6) of the mixed medium were found to be more essential for the growth of the targeted crystalline samples. Other anions and higher or lower pH value only led to amorphous powder or micro-crystals that were structurally diﬀerent from the target complexes. In the IR spectra (Fig. S1†), broad bands centered around 3400 cm−1 in 1–4 correspond to the characteristic vibrations of O–H, confirming the existence of a hydroxyl group and/or a water molecule. Compared with the isolated organic acid, the absence of a band at ca. 1686–1730 cm−1 suggests the full deprotonation of polycarboxylic acids in 1–4. The characterized multiple bands corresponding to the asymmetric (νas) and symmetric (νs) stretching vibrations for COO−are observed between 1600 and 1400 cm−1, and their diﬀerent separations (Δν = νas −νs) suggest the rich coordination modes of the carboxylate groups. Thus, the IR results of 1–4 are in good agreement with the single crystal X-ray diﬀraction data. Crystal structures of 1–4 [Cu4(μ-OH)(μ3-OH)(ta)2(btec)]n (1). Complex 1 is an intri- guing 3D framework constructed from coplanar CuII 7 clusters, 4-connected CuII 1 nodes and 6-connected btec4−connectors, exhibiting a (44·62)(411·65)2(413·610·85) topological network. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains five CuII ions with Cu4 and Cu5 lying at diﬀerent inversion centers, two bridging bidentate and tridentate hydroxyl groups, two deprotonated μ3-N1,N2,N3-ta− ligands to consolidate the local CuII 7 cluster and one fully Paper Dalton Transactions 5828 | Dalton Trans., 2015, 44, 5826–5836 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015 Published on 10 February 2015.

As shown in Fig. 1a, both Cu1 and Cu2 are five-coordinated in distorted square-pyramidal coordi- nation geometries with the Addison parameter τ = 0.05 and 0.39, respectively. The τ value is defined as an index of trigon- ality (τ = 1) and square-pyramid (τ = 0).35 The apical positions of both the metal ions are occupied by carboxylate O atoms from the btec4−ligand, and the basal planes are slightly diﬀerent (O3N for Cu1 and N2O2 for Cu2). The remaining three CuII ions are in a square-planar coordination geometry with Cu4 and Cu5 in the diﬀerent inversion centers and with the Cu3 ion in a general position. Both Cu3 and Cu4 sites are in an N2O2 donor set surrounded by pairs of μ3-ta−and bridging hydroxyl groups, while the Cu5 ion is embraced by four carboxy- late O atoms from four symmetry-related btec4−ligands. The bond lengths of Cu–O and Cu–N are between 1.898(4) and 2.352(4) Å (Table S1†), comparable with those of CuII-contain- ing complexes with mixed carboxylate and tri- or tetrazolyl ligands.36 The full deprotonated btec4−ligand in 1 is crystallo- graphically asymmetric and presents four crystallographically independent carboxylate groups to bind seven CuII ions in a μ7–κ7 O1:O2:O3:O4:O5:O7:O7 mode (Fig. 2). The central Cu4 ion aggregates two pairs of centrosym- metric CuII ions (Cu2 and Cu2A as well as Cu3 and Cu3A) by two asymmetric μ3-OH−groups and two μ3-N1,N2,N3-ta− ligands (Fig. 1b), generating an hourglass-shaped {Cu5(μ3- OH)2(ta)2}6+ precursor. Two additionally centrosymmetric Cu1 and Cu1A ions continue to incorporate into the CuII 5 precursor by two bridging μ-OH−groups and another pair of crystallo- graphically independent μ3-N1,N2,N3-ta−ligand. As a result, a centrosymmetric CuII 7 cluster, {Cu7(μ3-OH)2(μ-OH)2(ta)4}4+, is generated with the intermetallic distances of 3.3935(5), 3.4231(5), 3.3599(5) and 3.2215(6) Å for Cu1⋯Cu3, Cu2⋯Cu3, Cu2⋯Cu4 and Cu3⋯Cu4, respectively (Fig. 1b). Notably, all the seven CuII ions with the CuII 7 cluster are strictly coplanar, suggesting that the co-coordination of the hydroxyl group and ta−is favorable for the CuII 7 cluster. The CuII 7 cluster, the square-planar Cu5 ion and fully deprotonated btec4−anion can act as secondary building blocks to generate the 3D framework of 1. As illustrated in Fig. 1c, each CuII 7 cluster in 1 is surrounded by eight btec4− ligands, and can be topologically treated as an eight-connected node. The fully deprotonated btec4−anion in 1 links four CuII 7 clusters and two square-planar Cu5 ions, becoming a six- connected node (Fig. 1c). Instead, the planar-square Cu5 ion is surrounded by four btec4−ligands, serving as a four-connected node. The 8-, 6- and 4-connected nodes in 1 are periodically interconnected together to result in a complicated 3D frame- work of 1 (Fig. S2†), which can be simplified into a 4, 6, 8- trinodal network with a topological symbol of (44·62) (411·65)2(413·610·85) obtained by TOPOS (Fig. 1d).37 It should be noted that within the 3D framework, an alternating CuII 7 + CuII 1 chain is extended by the syn, anti-COO−moiety of the btec4−ligand (Fig. 1e), which should be responsible for the magnetic interactions of 1. {[Cu6(μ3-OH)2(ta)8(tp)]·2.5H2O}n (2). Replacing the btec4− connector with a tp2−coligand which has less carboxylate groups in the ternary system generated a pillared-layered framework of 2, which is built from alternating CuII 5 + CuII 1- based coplanar layers and bi-directional tp2−pillars.

The unique Cu1 and Cu2 ions within the CuII 5 cluster are five- coordinated in a distorted square-pyramidal geometry with τ = 0.36 and 0.09, respectively (Fig. 3a). The basal planes of both CuII atoms are well defined by one μ3-OH−and three individual N atoms from three diﬀerent ta−ligands, and the apical site is occupied by a carboxylate O (for Cu1) or a triazolyl N (for Cu2) donor. The apical Cu–O or Cu–N bond length is longer by ca. 0.2 Å than those in the basal planes (Table S2†).

Notably, all the metal ions in the CuII 5 cluster are coplanar and the inter-metallic distances are 3.3923(2), 3.3053(3) and 3.2664(3) Å for Cu1⋯Cu2, Cu1⋯Cu3 and Cu2⋯Cu3, respectively. Thus, the local CuII 5 cluster of 2 is analogous to the precursor in 1, and also benefits greatly from the co-coordination of the μ3-ta−and μ3-OH−group towards the CuII ions. Each CuII 5 cluster of 2 is connected together by pairs of the exterior μ3-ta−linkers, generating a one-dimensional (1D) chain running along crystallographic a-direction with a nearest intercluster CuII⋯CuII distance of 3.5898(3) Å. The neighbor- ing 1D chains join the octahedral CuII 1 cores through two pairs of ta−ligands in μ-N1,N2- and μ-N1,N2, N3-manners, aﬀording an infinite two-dimensional (2D) layer (Fig. 3b) with an interchain distance of 3.8077 Å separated by the CuII 1 core. Behaving as ditopic pillars, the centrosymmetric tp2−ligands extend the adjacent layers in a bis-bidentate bridging mode (μ4–κ4 O1:O2:O3:O4-tp2−, Fig. 2), resulting in a pillared-layered framework of 2 (Fig. 3c) with the shortest interlayer distance being ca. 10.9804(8) Å. {[Cu5(μ3-OH)2(ta)4(ip)2]·2H2O}n (3).

The central Cu5 ion in the CuII 5 core of 3 adopts a square-planar coordination geometry completed by an N2O2 donor set arising from pairs of μ3-ta−and μ3-OH− groups, which is dramatically diﬀerent from the N4O2 coordi- nation environment of the central Cu3 octahedron of 2. In addition, the NO4 coordination surroundings for the Cu2 ion of 2 are changed to the N3O2 donor sets of Cu2 and Cu6 in the CuII 5 cores of 3, which means that two carboxylate O atoms instead of two triazolyl N donors bind with the metal ion (Fig. 4a and Table S3†). As shown in Fig. 4c, two unique CuII 5 cores in 3 are alter- nately extended into 1D chains by a couple of μ3-ta−ligands with the nearest intercluster CuII⋯CuII separation being 3.4367(2) Å. Moreover, the adjacent CuII 5 clusters are perpen- dicular to each other, which greatly reduces the spatial hindrance of the targeted complex. The CuII 5 cluster-based 1D chains of 3 are then connected together by pairs of μ3-ip2−con- nectors in a μ3–κ3 O1:O1:O3-binding mode (Fig. 2), resulting in a 2D layer of 3 (Fig. 4c). Notably, the μ3-ip2−connector in 3 acts as a tritopic node to hold three CuII 5 clusters together (Fig. S3†). The adjacent layers of 3 are further supported by μ4- ip2−connector in a bis-bidentate bridging mode (μ4–κ4 O1:O2: O3:O4-ip2−, Fig. 2) to generate an overall microporous frame- work of 3 with a total potential solvent accessible void volume of 1679.7 Å3 calculated using PLATON program.38 The μ4-ip2− ligand in 3 also serves as a three-connected node despite its tetradentate binding mode, because it also aggregates three individual CuII 5 clusters together. Notably, the interchain sep- arations across the two unique ip2−connectors are 5.6646(4) and 5.7471(5) Å, considerably shorter than the interlayer dis- tance of 2 separated by the para-isomeric coligand.

Located at general positions, both Cu1 and Cu2 ions in 4 are in the NO4 donor sets (Fig. 5a), displaying a slightly distorted square-pyramid with τ = 0.01 and 0.16. The basal planes of the Cu1 site are well-defined by two hydroxyl groups, one carboxylate O and one triazolyl N donors, and the apical site is fulfilled by one carboxylate O atom from one pa2− anion. Instead, the basal sites of the Cu2 ion are generated by one μ3-OH−group, two separate carboxylate O donors from two diﬀerent pa2−anions and one N atom from the ta−ligand, and the apical position is fulfilled by one μ3-OH−group. The apical Cu–O distances are longer by 0.7 and 0.3 Å than those of the equatorial Cu–O and Cu–N bonds (Table S4†). Located at an inversion center, the unique Cu3 ion in 4 is in a square- planar coordination geometry completed by two N and two O donors from a pair of symmetry-related μ3-ta−ligands and two μ-OH−groups. Acting as asymmetric tridentate bridges, a pair of μ3-OH− groups aggregate four centrosymmetric CuII ions from two adjacent asymmetric units, generating a butterfly-shaped {Cu4(μ3-OH)2}6+ core with an intermetallic distance of 3.1186(2), 3.3879(2) and 3.1919(2) Å for Cu1⋯Cu2, Cu1⋯Cu2A and Cu2⋯Cu2A, respectively. The ∠CuOhydroxylCu are 122.884(3)°, 95.832(3)° and 98.186(3)° for ∠Cu1O6Cu2A, ∠Cu1O6Cu2 and ∠Cu2O6Cu2A, which are important parameters for the mag- netic couplings of 4. The butterfly-shaped CuII 4 clusters in 4 are alternatingly connected with the square-planar Cu3 ions through pairs of μ-OH−and μ3-N1,N2,N3-ta−ligands, aﬀording an infinite 1D wavy chain running along the [1 1 0] direction (Fig. 5b). The shortest distance between CuII 4 and CuII 1 from the μ-OH−group is 3.3364(2) Å. The alternating CuII 4 + CuII 1 chain can be previously observed in the 1,2,4-triazolate-based framework.36 Furthermore, each CuII 4 + CuII 1 chain of 4 is interconnected together through μ4-pa2−ligands in a bidentate bridging and single-atom bridging mode (μ4–κ4 O1:O2:O3:O3- pa2−, Fig. 2) to lead to an infinite 2D layer of 4 (Fig. 5b). The shortest interchain distance of the μ4-pa2−connector is ca. 5.2587(4) Å, considerably shorter than those of 2 and 3 con- structed from the para- and meta-isomers. In addition, the adjacent layers of 4 can be further stacked into a non-covalent 3D network by interlayer π⋯π stacking interactions between the adjacent phenyl rings with a center-to-center distance of 3.5912(2) Å (Fig. S4†). The above structural analyses of 1–4 clearly indicate that the increase of the nuclearity from centrosymmetric CuII 4 to CuII 7 greatly benefits from the cooperative co-coordination of the hydroxyl group and 1,2,3-triazolate ligand to the metal ion under hydrothermal conditions. In addition to the well matched intermetallic distance for μ3-/μ-OH−and μ3-/μ-ta−, the stabilized five-membered chelate ring of Cu2N2O is also an important factor in the formation of the clusters. In contrast, the extension of the dimensionality from 2D layer to 3D frame- work depends significantly on the carboxylate moieties, in which the isomerism of the two carboxylate groups towards the phenyl spacer controls the interchain/interlayer compact- ness. Thus, the ortho-, meta- and para-isomers of the dicarbox- ylate coligands yield interchain or interlayer distances of 5.26, 5.71 and 10.98 Å. Therefore, core-expansion and skeleton com- pactness are successfully achieved by subtle manipulations of the hydrothermal self-assembly process of the 1,2,3-triazolate and CuII salts in the presence of polycarboxylate coligands. TG and PXRD results TGA experiments (Fig. S5†) indicated that 1 without any lattice molecules can be thermally stable up to 304 °C, which was fol- lowed by an obvious weight-loss stage till 345 °C leading to the collapse of the complicated 3D framework. Notably, the back- bone collapse of 1 was not completely finished at the highest temperature measured. In contrast, samples 2–4 exhibited two separate weight-loss processes. The first one observed between 50 and 140 °C (for 2 and 3) and between 25 and 90 °C (for 4) was due to the removal of lattice water molecules (obsd 3.8%, calcd 3.9% for 2, obsd 3.8%, calcd 3.6% for 3 and obsd 4.1%, calcd 4.9% for 4). Once the temperature was higher than 290 °C, the weight of 2 decreased abruptly because of the explosion. Diﬀerently, an apparent weight-loss stage of 3 for the broken part of the framework was clearly detected between 290 and 410 °C, which was not totally finished similar to 1. The second weight-loss stage of 4 started at 292 °C and ended at 370 °C, corresponding to the decomposition of the mixed ligands and the broken part of the framework.

The PXRD pattern was used to check the phase purity and structural consistency of the bulky samples. As a result, the measured PXRD patterns of 1–4 matched well with the simulated ones generated from the results of single-crystal diﬀraction data (Fig. S6†). Magnetic properties Variable-temperature (2–300 K) magnetic susceptibilities of 1–4 were measured on the crystalline samples under an applied direct-current (dc) field of 1.0 kOe. The χMT product per CuII 7 + CuII 1 subunit of 1 is 2.48 cm3 K mol−1 at 300 K (Fig. 6a), which is moderately lower than the theoretical value (3.00 cm3 K mol−1) expected for eight magnetically isolated CuII ions with S = 1/2 and g = 2.0. The χMT value decreases rapidly with decreasing temperature and reaches a local minimum of 1.05 cm3 K mol−1 at 30.0 K due to the strong anti- ferromagnetic couplings between the adjacent spin carriers. Then, the χMT value increases abruptly and reaches a value of 2.03 cm3 K mol−1 at 2.0 K, suggesting possible intercluster ferromagnetic interactions. To quantitatively evaluate the coupling strength between the adjacent spin carriers, an approximate heptanuclear model with spin Hamiltonian H = −J1(SCu1SCu3 + SCu3ASCu1A + SCu3SCu4 + SCu4SCu3A + SCu2ASCu3 + SCu3ASCu2 + SCu2SCu4 + SCu2ASCu4) −J2(SCu1SCu2A + SCu1ASCu2 + SCu2SCu3 + SCu2ASCu3A) + SCu5 is used to fit the experimental magnetic susceptibilities of 1, in which J1 and J2 roughly describe the intracluster magnetic couplings (Table S5† and Fig. 6a inset) and the contribution from the individual Cu5 ion is considered to be an isolate Curie-like paramagnetic centre. The least-squares fitting of the magnetic data of 1 above 30.0 K using MAGPACK suite39 leads to g = 2.12, J1 = −127.1 cm−1, J2 = −21.4 cm−1 and R = 8.2 × 10−4, where R is the agreement factor defined as ∑[(χMT)obsd −(χMT)calcd]2/ ∑[(χMT)obsd]. Obviously, the strong antiferromagnetic inter- action for J1 should be assigned to the superexchange path- ways of the basal and/or equatorial hydroxyl and –NN– of µ3-tz−heterobridges. Moreover, the bigger bond angles of ∠CuNN and ∠CuOCu (Table S5†) can further increase the overlap of the magnetic orbits from the CuII ions and hydroxyl group/µ3-tz−mediators to enhance the antiferromagnetic inter- action. In contrast, the small J2 is associated with relatively long intermetallic distances separated by the –NCN– moiety of the µ3-tz−ligand. The isothermal magnetization of 1 measured at 2.0 K (Fig. 6b) increases with the enhanced magnetic field and slowly reaches a saturation value of 2.03Nβ at 70 kOe. More- over, the experimental M–H curve is above the theoretical Brillouin function for S = 1 and g = 2.0, suggesting weak intercluster ferromagnetic interactions. The saturated magneti- zation for each CuII 7 + CuII 1 subunit of 1 at 70 kOe is in good agreement with the susceptibility data (2.00Nβ) for two CuII ions with S = 1/2 and g = 2.0, confirming that S = 1 spin ground-state of 1 generated at low temperatures. Obviously, the spin ground-state of 1 comes from the weak ferromagnetic coupling of CuII 1 and the net magnetization produced in the antiferromagnetic coupled CuII 7 cluster, which is mediated by the syn, anti-COO−bridge. Diﬀerent from the paramagnetic behavior of 1, the hour- glass-shaped CuII 5 cluster-based 2 and 3 exhibit spin-canted antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism, respectively. The room-temperature χMT value for each CuII 5 + CuII 1 subunit of 2 (1.83 cm3 K mol−1) is only slightly smaller than that (2.00 cm3 K mol−1) for per CuII 5 subunit of 3, implying a stronger inter-/ intra-cluster antiferromagnetic coupling of 2 than 3 even at ambient temperatures. The stronger antiferromagnetic inter- action of 2 than 3 can also be concluded by comparisons of the Weiss constants (−267 vs. −166 K) of the Curie–Weiss fitting above 110.0 K (Fig. S7†). Upon cooling, both χMT values decrease continuously and reach minimums at 18.0 (for 2) and 16.0 K (for 3). Then, χMT shows an abrupt rise upon further cooling, suggesting the onset of magnetic ordering with a spontaneous magnetization. The final drop in the χMT of 2 may be due to the inter-layer antiferromagnetic interactions. Both the χM–T curves of 2 and 3 are field-dependent at low temperatures (Fig. S8†). The isothermal magnetization of 2 measured at 2.0 K (Fig. 6b) shows an initial abrupt increase with fields below Fig. 6 (a) Temperature dependence of χMT for 1–4 (solid line represents the best least-squares ﬁt indicated in the text).

Then, it increases linearly with an increasing field and reaches 0.18Nβ at 70 kOe, which is less than the expected value (1.0Nβ) for one CuII ion, implying that 2 serves as a canted antiferromagnet arising from the asymmetric magnetic pathway mediated by the –NNN– moiety of the μ3-ta−anion in the isotropic CuII 5 + CuII 1-based 2D sublayer. In contrast, the magnetization for per CuII 5 subunit of 3 increases quickly with an increasing field and is obviously far from the Brillouin law for S = 1/2 and g = 2.0. The magnetization per CuII 5 unit of 3 is 1.01Nβ at 70 kOe, confirming the ferrimagnetic behavior of 3 leads to an S = 1/2 spin ground-state at low temperature. The ferrimagnetism of 3 arises from the ordering arrangement of the net magnetization of the antiferromagnetically coupled CuII 5 clusters in the local 2D layer of 3 by the carboxylate of the ip2−ligand. Alternating-current (ac) susceptibilities were measured to investigate the magnetic dynamic of 2 and 3. Both the in- phase (χ′) and out-of-phase (χ″) components slowly rise with decreasing temperature and reach a maximum at 2.0 K without an obvious peak (Fig. 7), suggesting that the Néel temperature (TN) of 2 and 3 is lower than 2.0 K. The lowered TN of the two samples can also be evidenced by the identical zero-field-cool (ZFC) and field-cool (FC) plots down to 2.0 K, which may be due to the spin frustration caused by the hourglass-like arrangement of the spin carriers in local CuII 5 clusters.40 In addition, the ac susceptibilities are frequency- independent, precluding the possibility of a spin-glass behavior.41 The room temperature χMT value for each CuII 4 + CuII 1 subunit of 4 is 1.38 cm3 K mol−1 (Fig. 6a), lower than the value for five CuII ions with S = 1/2 and g = 2.0. Upon cooling, the χMT quickly drops to 0.39 cm3 K mol−1 at 2.0 K, which results from the strong antiferromagnetic couplings between the adja- cent CuII spins. The χMT product of 4 at low temperatures is very close to 0.375 cm3 K mol−1 corresponding to the S = 1/2 spin ground-state, indicating that there is one unpaired d elec- tron within the CuII 4 + CuII 1 chain. Obviously, the CuII 1 core is the origin for the spin ground state because the antiferromag- netically coupled CuII 4 cluster leads to a zero magnetization. The magnetization of 4 performed at 2.0 K roughly follows a Brillouin function with S = 1/2 and g = 2.0, and the saturation value (1.03Nβ) corresponding to one unpaired d electron is reached at 70 kOe. Thus, the layered sample 4 with a CuII 4 + CuII 1 motif exhibits a paramagnetic S = 1/2 spin ground-state at low temperatures. Conclusion Hydrothermal reactions of the CuII source, 1,2,3-triazole and carboxylate-modified coligands provide centrosymmetric CuII 7, CuII 5, CuII 4 and CuII 1 motifs with diﬀerent core topologies, which are further extended into three 3D frameworks and a 2D layer with tunable interchain/interlayer compactness. The expansion of the nuclearities from four to seven crystallo- graphically results from the co-coordination of the 1,2,3-triazo- late and hydroxyl group towards the metal ion, and the substitution isomerism of the dicarboxylate groups from the coligand essentially triggers a noticeable interchain and inter- layer compactness. Due to the antiferromagnetic couplings in the local clusters and the asymmetric magnetic exchange by 1,2,3-triazolate, these complexes exhibit paramagnetic S = 1 and 1/2, ferrimagnetic S = 1/2 as well as canted antiferro- magnetic behaviors at low temperatures.
