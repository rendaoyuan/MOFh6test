Manuscript Topological diversity in zinc coordination polymers with 5-substituted isophthalate and bis(4-pyridylmethyl)piperazine ligands† Amy L. Pochodylo and Robert L. LaDuca* Received 11th October 2010, Accepted 2nd December 2010 DOI: 10.1039/c0ce00715c The structures of luminescent divalent zinc coordination polymers containing a 5-substituted isophthalate ligand and the long-spanning hydrogen-bonding capable tethering ligand bis(4-pyridylmethyl)piperazine (bpmp) show a wide variety of two- and three-dimensional topologies. {[Zn(NO2ip)(Hbpmp)][ZnCl(H2O)(NO2ip)]}n (1, NO2ip ¼ 5-nitroisophthalate) possesses parallel two- fold interpenetrated cationic (4,4) coordination polymer grids along with embedded anionic one- dimensional (1-D) chain motifs. The chloride-free derivative {[Zn5(NO2ip)6(Hbpmp)2(bpmp)]$2H2O}n (2) manifests trinuclear units linked into a complex doubly interpenetrated 4,8-connected binodal 3-D lattice with (456)2(414614) topology. {[Zn(OHip)(bpmp)]$H2O}n (3, OHip ¼ 5-hydroxyisophthalate) has a ﬁve-fold interpenetrated diamondoid topology, while [Zn2(tBuip)2(bpmp)]n (4, tBuip ¼ 5-tert- butylisophthalate) shows a two-fold interpenetrated primitive cubic net based on dimeric units. {[Zn(OMeip)(bpmp)]$8H2O}n (5, OMeip ¼ 5-methoxyisophthalate) adopts an undulating (4,4) single- grid 2-D topology. {[Zn(sip)(Hbpmp)]$4H2O}n (6, sip ¼ 5-sulfoisophthalate) displays a novel three- fold interpenetrated 3,5-connected binodal lattice with (426)(426583) topology. Introduction The design and characterization of extended coordination polymeric crystalline solids remains a popular basic research interest because of the utility of these materials in industrially important applications such as gas storage,1 shape-selective absorption and separation,2 ion exchange,3 catalysis,4 lumines- cence,5 and second harmonic generation.6 One of the most frequent ligand choices is an aromatic dianionic dicarboxylate ligand such as terephthalate7 or isophthalate,8 which can bridge metal cations while providing the structural integrity and the required charge balance for formation of a stable neutral crys- talline framework. Diverse structural topologies are observed in these systems, depending on the coordination environment preferences at the metal ions, the geometric orientation of the carboxylate groups on the aromatic ring, and the inclusion of any dipodal nitrogen-base tethering ligands.9 To expand the structural scope of these materials, some researchers have begun to employ isophthalate ligands bearing non-ligating substituents at their 5-positions, discovering some intriguing molecular separation properties and structural topol- ogies.10–14 For instance, the 3-D network material [Zn(tBuip)]n (tBuip ¼ 5-tert-butylisophthalate) prepared by Li et al. possesses 1-D guest-free channels that provide capability for the separation of methanol from water.10 Kitagawa et al. have recently reported that the 2-D grid coordination polymer {[Zn(NO2ip)(4,40- bpy)](0.5DMF$0.5MeOH)}n (NO2ip ¼ 5-nitroisophthalate) and its isostructural analogue {[Zn(MeOip)(4,40- bpy)](0.5DMF$0.5MeOH)}n (MeOip ¼ 5-methoxyisophthalate) form crystalline solid solutions that can be tailored for varying the gate-opening pressure for adsorption of water.11 Addition- ally, CO2 can be adsorbed selectively from a CH4/CO2 gaseous mixture, enhanced by tuning the level of MeOip ligands in the solid solution.11 Batten et al. reported a novel pseudo-rotaxane 2-D 4-connected binodal (4.64.8)2(42.64) topology in [Co2(mip)2(bpp)2(H2O)]n (mip ¼ 5-methylisophthalate, bpp ¼ 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane).12a Less common have been studies systematically probing the size-dependent steric effects on the substituted isophthalate dual-ligand coordination polymer topology.15 Yang and co-workers have prepared the series [Zn4(H2O)(ip)4(py)6]n (ip ¼ isophthalate, py ¼ pyridine), {[Zn2(OHip)2(py)4]2$(py)}n (OHip ¼ 5-hydroxyisophthalate), and [Zn(tBuip)(py)2]n, in which increasing the steric bulk resulted in a decrease in the coordination polymer dimensionality from a 2-D (4,4)-grid to one-dimensional (1-D) double-stranded and single-stranded chains. Recently we have reported a series of divalent metal iso- phthalate coordination polymers based on tethering bis(4-pyr- idylmethyl)piperazine (bpmp) ligands, where the zinc derivative {[Zn(ip)(bpmp)]$H2O}n displays an achiral ﬁve-fold inter- penetrated diamondoid lattice.16 We have thus sought to inves- tigate the effect of isophthalate 5-position substituents on the Lyman Briggs College and Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University, E-30 Holmes Hall, East Lansing, MI, 48825, USA.

Six new materials were isolated in the course of this study: {[Zn(NO2ip)(Hbpmp)][ZnCl(H2O)(NO2ip)]}n (1), {[Zn5(NO2ip)6(Hbpmp)2(bpmp)] $2H2O}n (2), {[Zn- (OHip)(bpmp)]$H2O}n (3), [Zn2(tBuip)2(bpmp)]n (4), {[Zn- (OMeip)(bpmp)]$8H2O}n (5); {[Zn(sip)(Hbpmp)]$4H2O}n (6). Their structural and topological chemistry and luminescent properties are discussed herein, along with contrasts and comparisons with related zinc derivatives with different pyridyl ligands. Results and discussion Synthesis and infrared spectra Hydrothermal reaction of zinc salts with the requisite substituted isophthalic acid and bpmp generated crystalline samples of 1–6. Hydrothermal conditions are often beneﬁcial for the production of crystalline coordination polymers, as potential differential solubility between inorganic and organic precursors can be avoided without decomposition of the organic components. Additionally, the lower viscosity of liquid water at higher temperature can facilitate nucleation processes crucial for self- assembly.17 Their infrared spectra were consistent with structural components determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Intense, slightly broadened asymmetric and symmetric C–O stretching bands were observed at 1524 and 1340 cm1 in 1, 1574 and 1344 cm1 in 2, 1580 and 1332 cm1 in 3, 1553 and 1345 cm1 in 4, 1614 and 1351 cm1 in 5, and 1616 and 1328 cm1 in 6. The asymmetric and symmetric N–O stretching bands of the nitro groups in 1 and 2 largely overlap with the C–O stretching bands, although shoulders at 1560 and 1319 cm1 are observed in the spectra of 2. Sharp and medium intensity bands in the range of 1600 cm1 to 1300 cm1 were attributed to stretching modes of the pyridyl rings of the 4-bpmp moieties and the phenyl rings of the substituted isophthalate ligands.18 Features corresponding to C–H bending and arene puckering within the pyridyl, phenyl, and piperazinyl rings exist in the region between 900 and 650 cm1. Broad, weak spectral bands in the vicinity of 3200 to 3000 cm1 indicate the presence of bound and unbound water molecules in 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, the hydroxyl substituent in 3, and the N–H groups on the protonated piperazinyl rings in 1 and 2. The strong features at 1259 cm1 and 1004 cm1 in the spectrum of 5 correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric C–O stretches within the ether functional group. The sulfonate groups in 6 are represented in the infrared spectrum by sharp bands at 1155 cm1 and 1038 cm1. Structural description of {[Zn(NO2ip)(Hbpmp)][ZnCl(H2O)(NO2ip)]}n (1) The asymmetric unit of compound 1 contains two crystallo- graphically distinct divalent zinc atoms (Zn1, Zn2), one bpmp ligand (bound to Zn1) that is protonated at one of its piperazinyl nitrogen atoms, two fully deprotonated NO2ip ligands (one bound to Zn1, one bound to Zn2), a chloro ligand bound to Zn2, and an aqua ligand bound to Zn2 (Fig. 1). Both zinc atoms display distorted tetrahedral coordination. Zn1 possesses a {ZnO2N2} coordination environment, with two pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from two Hbpmp+ ligands and two oxygen donor atoms from monodentate carboxylate groups belonging to two different NO2ip ligands. Zn2 has a {ZnO3Cl} coordination sphere, with a chloro ligand, an aqua ligand, and two oxygen donor atoms from NO2ip monodentate carboxylate groups. Bond lengths and angles about the zinc atoms are consistent with distorted tetrahedral geometries (Table 1), with greater variances from ideal geometry at Zn1. Scheme 1 Ligands used in this study.

The two carboxylate groups and the nitro substituent of the NO2ip ligands are almost coplanar with the phenyl rings to which they are attached, varying by 4.34, 3.60, and 11.4 relative to the aromatic planes respectively. Adjacent [Zn1(NO2ip)]n chains are connected to rufﬂed cationic [Zn(NO2ip)(Hbpmp)]n n+ (4,4) grid coordination polymer layers through tethering Hbpmp+ ligands, which span a Zn1/Zn1 distance of 16.288 A˚ . The angle subtended by the pyridyl nitrogen atoms and the centroid of the piperazinyl ring of the Hbpmp+ ligand is 168.2. The through-space rectangular aper- tures within a single [Zn(NO2ip)(Hbpmp)]n n+ grid measure 17.962  19.882 A˚ , which accommodates parallel 2d + 2d / 2D interpenetration of an identical polymer grid. Side-on and face- on perspectives of the doubly interpenetrated [Zn(NO2ip)(Hbpmp)]n n+ cationic (4,4) grids are shown in Fig. 2. Necessary charge balance within 1 is provided by [ZnCl(H2O)(NO2ip)]n n polymeric chains, which are formed by the linkage of Zn2 atoms through bis(monodentate) bridging NO2ip ligands (Scheme 2). The Zn2/Zn2 distance along this chain motif is 9.677 A˚ , identical to the NO2ip-bridged Zn1/Zn1 cationic [Zn(NO2ip)(Hbpmp)]n n+ (4,4) grid distance. However, within the chains, the two carboxylate and nitro groups on the NO2ip ligands vary more greatly from planarity with respect to the aromatic ring, with torsions of 24.3, 8.6, and 3.7, respec- tively. The [ZnCl(H2O)(NO2ip)]n n polymeric chains are aggre- gated into pairs (Fig. 3) through offset p–p stacking of the phenyl rings of NO2ip ligands in adjacent chains (centroid-to- centroid distance ¼ 3.916 A˚ ). These pairs are located between the interpenetrated [Zn(NO2ip)(Hbpmp)]n n+ cationic layers, within pockets bracketed by the NO2ip ligands projecting above and below neighboring layer motifs. As determined by PLATON,19 the [ZnCl(H2O)(NO2ip)]n n chain pairs occupy 19.5% of the unit cell volume of 1. Hydrogen-bonding (Table 2) anchors the cationic and anionic components into the overall 3-D crystal structure of 1 (Fig. 4). One important hydrogen-bonding pattern connects protonated piperazinyl nitrogen atoms of the Hbpmp+ ligands within the interpenetrated [Zn(NO2ip)(Hbpmp)]n n+ layers and unligated NO2ip carboxylate oxygen atoms within [ZnCl(H2O)(NO2ip)]n n chains; the other connects the aqua ligands in the anionic chain motifs with unligated NO2ip carboxylate oxygen atoms within the cationic coordination polymer layers.

As a result the 1-D [ZnCl(H2O)(NO2ip)]n n chains are required for the charge balance in 1. Structural description of {[Zn5(NO2ip)6(Hbpmp)2(bpmp)]$2H2O}n (2) The large asymmetric unit of compound 2 (Fig. 5) contains three divalent zinc atoms, one of which (Zn1) is located on a crystal- lographic inversion center, three crystallographically distinct NO2ip ligands (NO2ip–A, NO2ip–B, NO2ip–C), one bpmp molecule protonated at one of its piperazinyl nitrogen atoms, one-half of a bpmp ligand situated across another inversion center, and one water molecule of crystallization. Zn1 possesses a {ZnO6} octahedral coordination environment, wherein four NO2ip–A ligands and two NO2ip–B ligands each provide one oxygen donor atom. Zn2 is tetrahedrally coordinated in a {ZnO3N} environment with one pyridyl nitrogen donor atom from a protonated Hbpmp+ ligand, one oxygen donor atom from a NO2ip–B ligand, and oxygen donor atoms from two different NO2ip–C ligands. Zn3 is coordinated in a distorted square pyramidal {ZnO3N2} geometry, with cis basal plane positions occupied by pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from Hbpmp+ and bpmp ligands. The remaining cis coordination sites in the basal plane of the square pyramid are ﬁlled by oxygen donor atoms from NO2ip–A and NO2ip–B ligands; the apical position is taken up by an oxygen donor atom belonging to another NO2ip–A Table 2 Hydrogen bonding distance (A˚ ) and angle () data for 1–3 and 6 D–H/A d(H/A) :DHA d(D/A) Symmetry transformation for A 1 N4–H4N/O7 1.819(17) 172(3) 2.689(3) x + 2,y, –z + 2 O11–H11A/O3 1.816(18) 172(3) 2.686(3) x, y, z + 1 O11–H11B/O4 2.12(2) 156(3) 2.940(3) x + 1, y + 1/2, z + 1/2 2 N6–H6N/O8 1.87(2) 157(2) 2.666(2) x  1, y  1, z O1W–H1WA/O6 1.884(18) 166(3) 2.736(2) –x + 1, y, z + 1/2 O1W–H1WB/O9 2.229(17) 172(3) 3.073(2) x, y, z + 1/2 3 O1W–H1WA/N4 2.28(2) 162(4) 3.108(4) x  1/2, y + 1/2, z  1/2 O1W–H1WB/O3 2.120(19) 169(4) 2.966(3) O5–H5A/O4 1.998(19) 171(3) 2.834(3) x + 1, y, z + 1/2 6 N3–H3N/O1W 1.98(4) 173(4) 2.82(2) x, y + 1, z N3–H3N/O1WA 1.79(4) 174(4) 2.64(2) x, y + 1, z Fig. 4 View down c of the overall structure of 1.

Bond lengths and angles within the various zinc coordi- nation spheres in 2 are given in Table 3. All zinc atoms within 2 are connected by the carboxylate groups of the three crystallographically distinct types of NO2ip ligands to create complicated anionic [Zn5(NO2ip)6]n 2n 1-D ribbon motifs (Fig. 6), which are arranged parallel to the a crystal direction. Zn1 atoms within the ribbon are connected to two Zn3 atoms and one other Zn1 atom by exotetradentate NO2ip–A ligands (Scheme 2), which are shown in green in Fig. 6. One carboxylate terminus of a NO2ip–A ligand bridges one Zn1 and one Zn3 atom, while a single oxygen from the other carboxylate group directly bridges one Zn1 atom and one Zn3 atom. {Zn3(O)Zn1(O)Zn3} zigzag trinuclear units, with Zn3/Zn1 distances of 3.505 A˚ , therefore form the central units within a single [Zn5(NO2ip)6]n ribbon. Each pair of Zn1 and Zn3 atoms is also bracketed by a bridging carboxylate group from an exo- tridentate NO2ip–B ligand (orange in Fig. 6) (Scheme 2). The other carboxylate group of each NO2ip–B ligand binds in a monodentate fashion to the tetrahedrally coordinated Zn2 atoms located on the periphery of the [Zn5(NO2ip)6]n ribbon. The Zn1/Zn2 and Zn3/Zn2 distances from the center to the exte- rior of the ribbons measure 10.328 and 8.445 A˚ , respectively. Along the edges of the ribbon motif, tetrahedrally coordinated Zn2 atoms are bridged by bis(monodentate) bridged NO2ip–C ligands (blue in Fig. 6) (Scheme 2), providing a Zn2/Zn2 distance of 9.491 A˚ . Each [Zn5(NO2ip)6]n 2n anionic ribbon is subsequently con- nected to four other ribbons by tethering Hbpmp+ and bpmp ligands to construct the 3-D [Zn5(NO2ip)6(Hbpmp)2(bpmp)]n coordination polymer network of 2. The protonated Hbpmp+ ligands provide the charge balance and connect Zn3 atoms on the interior of a single ribbon to Zn2 atoms on the periphery of two other [Zn5(NO2ip)6]n 2n ribbon motifs with a Zn2/Zn3 distance of 16.476 A˚ . Likewise, the peripheral Zn2 atoms within a single ribbon are connected by Hbpmp+ ligands to interior Zn3 atoms in the same two neighboring [Zn5(NO2ip)6]n 2n ribbons. Addi- tionally, Zn3 atoms within one ribbon are connected to Zn3 atoms within two other [Zn5(NO2ip)6]n 2n ribbons by bpmp tethers, giving a Zn3/Zn3 distance of 16.647 A˚ . The respective angles between the pyridyl nitrogen atoms and the piperazinyl ring centroids within the Hbpmp+ and bpmp ligands are 168.7 and 180, enforcing the slightly different Zn/Zn contact distances. Extra-framework void space within a single [Zn5(NO2ip)6(Hbpmp)2(bpmp)]n coordination polymer network allows interpenetration of an identical network (Fig. 7, top). Hydrogen-bonding between the protonated piperazinyl nitrogen atoms of the Hbpmp+ ligands and unligated NO2ip–C carboxy- late oxygen atoms (Table 2) serves to anchor the two inter- penetrated networks together. Unligated water molecules occupy the small extra-framework space in the doubly interpenetrated 3-D network, which represents 3.5% of the unit cell volume. These are anchored to the coordination polymer backbone of 2 by hydrogen-bonding donation to unligated carboxylate and nitro group oxygen atoms of the NO2ip–C ligands. The topology of the 3-D coordination polymer network of 2 was examined by treating the tetrahedrally coordinated Zn2 atoms as four-connected nodes, and the octahedrally coordi- nated central Zn1 atoms of the {Zn3(O)Zn1(O)Zn3} zigzag tri- nuclear units as eight-connected nodes. From this perspective, each Zn2 atom connects to two other Zn2 atoms within a single [Zn5(NO2ip)6]n 2n ribbon by NO2ip–C ligands, one Zn1 atom within the same ribbon by a NO2ip–B ligand, and a trinuclear unit in another [Zn5(NO2ip)6]n 2n ribbon via a Hbpmp+ tether. Each Zn1 atom connects to two other Zn1 atoms via two pairs of NO2ip–A ligands, and to two Zn2 atoms only via NO2ip–B ligands, all within the same [Zn5(NO2ip)6]n 2n ribbon.

Topological analysis with TOPOS23 revealed an unprecedented doubly interpenetrated 4,8-connected binodal lattice with {(456)2(414614)} topology (Fig. 7, bottom), based only on four- and six-membered circuits. To date only two other zinc 5-nitroisophthalate 3-D coordi- nation polymer networks have been reported. {[Zn(bime)- (NO2ip)]$H2O}n (bime ¼ 1,2-bis(imidazol-10-yl)ethane) has a rare 4-connected 658 dmp topology, a hybrid of well-known diamondoid and CdS nets.24 [Zn4(trz)4(HNO2ip)2(NO2ip)]n (trz ¼ 1,2,4-triazole) consists of cationic [Zn4(trz)4]n 4n+ 4.82 layers connected by NO2ip pillars to generate a 3D network.25 Structural description of {[Zn(OHip)(bpmp)]$H2O}n (3) Compound 3 contains an asymmetric unit consisting of one zinc atom, two halves of two crystallographically distinct bpmp molecules (bpmp-A, N1–N2; bpmp-B, N3–N4) and a single OHip ligand (Fig. 8), along with one unligated water molecule. The zinc atom possesses a very distorted {ZnN2O2} tetrahedral coordination sphere, bound by one pyridyl nitrogen donor from a bpmp-A ligand, another from a bpmp-B, as well as carboxylate oxygen atoms from two OHip ligands. The largest bond angle within the coordination sphere, 132.62(8), exists between the two carboxylate oxygen donor atoms. Bond lengths and angles around the metal center are consistent with the distorted tetra- hedral geometry and are given in Table 4. Bis(monodentate) OHip ligands (Scheme 2) connect adjacent zinc atoms into neutral [Zn(OHip)]n zigzag chain motifs, which are linked in turn into a diamonoid 3-D lattice (66 topology) by both bpmp-A and bpmp-B ligands (Fig. 9). The Zn/Zn contact distances through the OHip ligands are 10.125 A˚ , while the Zn/ Zn distances through bpmp-A and bpmp-B are 16.133 and 15.564 A˚ , respectively. The angle between the pyridyl nitrogen atoms and the centroid of the piperazinyl ring of bpmp-A is a symmetry enforced 180, while the related angle in bpmp-B is 138.4. These data indicate that bpmp-B adopts a curled conformation, which causes the shorter Zn/Zn span. Apertures within a single [Zn(OHip)(bpmp)]n diamondoid net, with closest through-space Zn/Zn distances of 23.88 A˚ , allow interpene- tration of four other identical nets to form a ﬁve-fold inter- penetrated network (Fig. 10). A small incipient void space of 4.6% of the unit cell volume is occupied by water molecules of crystallization, which are anchored to the coordination polymer networks by hydrogen bonding involving the piperazinyl nitrogen atoms of the bpmp ligands and unligated OHip carboxylate oxygen atoms (Table 2). Interpenetrated [Zn(OHip)(bpmp)]n diamondoid nets are anchored to each other by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxy substituents on the OHip ligands in one net and ligated carboxylate oxygen atoms (O4) in another. From this perspec- tive, the isophthalate ligands themselves can be treated as 3- connected nodes linking to two zinc atoms in one diamondoid net (via covalent bonding) and one zinc atom in another net (through the supramolecular interaction); the zinc atoms can be treated as 5-connected nodes linking to two other zinc atoms (through bpmp ligands) and three isophthalate nodes (two in one diamondoid net, one in another).

Among the roster of 5-substituted isophthalate ligands, 5-hydroxyisophthalate has been the most frequently used in the construction of divalent zinc coordination polymers. The capping ligand 2,20-bpy has afforded the 1-D ribbon phase {[Zn(OHip)(2,20-bpy)] $H2O}n,26 while the rigid rod tether 4,40- bpy resulted in a stair-stepped layered topology in {Zn2(OHip)2(bipy)(H2O)2$H2O}n.27 The long, ﬂexible tether 2,20-bis(1H-imidazolyl)ether (bie) generated [Zn(OHip)(bie)]n layers with a common (4,4) grid topology, but whose marked undulations produce an uncommon 2-D / 3-D parallel inter- penetration scheme.28 Zinc OHip phases with conformationally ﬂexible dipyridyl ligands such as 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane (dpp) and 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethane (dpe) display interpenetrated dia- mondoid lattices,29 with the latter manifesting the same 5-fold interpenetration as seen in 3. A twisted conformation of the dpp ligands in {[Zn(OHip)(dpp)]$H2O}n shortens the Zn/Zn distance and reduces the level of interpenetration to 4-fold. It appears that more restricted ﬂexibility of the bpmp ligands promotes a higher level of interpenetration in 3. Structural description of [Zn2(tBuip)2(bpmp)]n (4) The asymmetric unit of compound 4 contains a divalent zinc atom, one fully deprotonated tBuip ligand, and one half of a bpmp ligand whose central piperazinyl ring is situated over a crystallographic inversion center. The {ZnO3N} distorted tetrahedral coordination environments are ﬁlled by one pyridyl nitrogen donor atom from a bpmp ligand and oxygen donor atoms from three different tBuip ligands (Fig. 12). Bond distances and angles within the coordination sphere are listed in Table 5.

Pairs of zinc atoms are linked into {Zn2(OCO)2} dinuclear units (with through-space Zn/Zn distances of 3.702 A˚ ) via tBuip anti–syn bridging carboxylates; the full spans of the tBuip ligands connect these dinuclear kernels into 2-D [Zn(tBuip)]n layers oriented parallel to the bc crystal planes (Fig. 13). If each {Zn2(OCO)2} dinuclear unit is treated as a connecting node, this layer motif can be rendered as a simple (4,4) rhomboid grid. Projecting above and below the [Zn(tBuip)]n layers are the tert- butyl substituents and bpmp ligands, which establish a [Zn2(tBuip)2(bpmp)]n 3-D coordination polymer lattice. The Zn/Zn distances through the bpmp ligands measure 16.202 A˚ . The rectangular box-shaped apertures within a single [Zn2(tBuip)2(bpmp)]n 3-D network allow interpenetration of a second identical net (Fig. 14). Treating the {Zn2(OCO)2} dimers as 6-connected nodes in this fashion results in a two-fold interpenetrated primitive cubic net (pcu) as the underlying topology. The interpenetrated nets afford no solvent accessible volume within the structure of 4. The 2-fold interpenetrated pcu topology of 4 contrasts with [Zn5(tBuip)4(OH)2(4,40-bpy)]n, which possesses a (3,6) triangular grid 2-D net with pentanuclear clusters as connecting nodes.30 Structural description of {[Zn(OMeip)(bpmp)]$8H2O}n (5) The asymmetric unit of compound 5 contains a divalent zinc atom and an OMeip ligand situated on a crystallographic mirror plane, one-half of a bpmp ligand whose central piperazine ring surrounds a crystallographic inversion center, and four total disordered water molecules of crystallization. The {ZnN2O2} distorted tetrahedral coordination environment (Fig. 15) is formed by two pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms from bpmp ligands and two carboxylate oxygen donor atoms from OMeip ligands. Bond lengths and angles at the zinc centers are listed in Table 6. Bis(monodentate) OMeip ligands (Scheme 2) bridge zinc atoms into 1-D [Zn(OMeip)]n chain motifs that are oriented along the a crystal direction. The [Zn(OMeip)]n chains are linked by bpmp struts into (4,4) grid wave-like [Zn(OMeip)(bpmp)]n coordination polymer layers (Fig. 16), similar to that seen in {[Zn(OMeip)(dpee)]$H2O}n (dpee ¼ 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene)31 and {[Zn(MeOip)(4,40-bpy)](0.5DMF$0.5MeOH)}n.11 The perimeters of the grid spaces in 5 are deﬁned by the Zn/Zn distances across the OMeip ligands (9.627 A˚ ) and the bpmp ligands (16.285 A˚ ). The former distance deﬁnes the a lattice parameter, while the b lattice parameter (18.467 A˚ ) marks the wavelength of the layer undulations. With Zn/Zn/Zn contact angles of 75.1 and 104.9, the grid apertures are noticeably canted parallelograms.

The water-ﬁlled 1-D channels formed by the stacked grid aper- tures occupy 19.2% of the unit cell volume of 5. Structural description of {[Zn(sip)(Hbpmp)]$4H2O}n (6) The asymmetric unit of compound 6 contains a divalent zinc ion, a fully deprotonated sip trianion, a bpmp ligand protonated at one of its piperazinyl nitrogen atoms, and four total water molecules of crystallization. The {ZnN2O3} coordination sphere is a very distorted trigonal bipyramid (s ¼ 0.745)32 with the axial positions occupied by a pyridyl nitrogen donor atom from a Hbpmp+ ligand and a sulfonate oxygen atom from a sip ligand (Fig. 17). In the equatorial plane of the trigonal bipyramidal coordination environment are a pyridyl nitrogen donor atom from a second Hbpmp+ ligand and oxygen donor atoms from carboxylate groups belonging to two different sip ligands. Pertinent bond lengths and angles for 6 are given in Table 7. Exotridentate sip ligands connect to three different zinc atoms via two monodentate carboxylate groups and one monodentate sulfonate group (Scheme 2) to generate anionic [Zn(sip)]n n ribbon motifs that are oriented parallel to the [1 0 0] crystal direction (Fig. 18). These ribbons can also be construed as being formed by the junction of two parallel, offset zinc dicarboxylate chains through sulfonate groups. The carboxylate groups are slightly twisted relative to the aromatic ring plane of the sip ligands by 9.4 and 14.7, providing a through-ligand Zn/Zn contact distance of 9.856 A˚ (deﬁning the a lattice parameter). Each zinc atom connects to zinc atoms in two neighboring [Zn(sip)]n n ribbons through cis-disposed tethering Hbpmp+ ligands. As zinc atoms are situated on both sides of the ribbon motifs, each [Zn(sip)]n n ribbon thus connects to four other parallel ribbon motifs. A neutral [Zn(sip)(Hbpmp+)]n 3-D coor- dination polymer lattice is thereby constructed (Fig. 19a). Large Fig. 16 Face-on view of an undulating [Zn(OMeip)(bpmp)]n coordina- tion polymer layer in 5.

Short four- molecule discrete water chains (D4 classiﬁcation33) occupy the residual inter-framework space (15.5% of the unit cell volume), held to the coordination polymer framework by hydrogen- bonding acceptance from protonated piperazinyl nitrogen atoms of the Hbpmp+ ligands (Table 2). The network topology of 6 can be derived by considering each exotridentate sip ligand as a 3-connected node and each zinc atom as a 5-connected node. The resulting three-fold interpenetrated 3,5-connected binodal lattice has a simple but previously unreported (426)(426583) topology (Fig. 20), with an extended point symbol of (4.4.63)(4.4.6.6.6.6.88.88.810). The new binodal topology of 6 contrasts greatly with those of previously reported zinc 5-sulfoisophthalate coordination poly- mers that incorporate multitopic neutral nitrogen-base ligands. {[Zn(sip)(H4,40-bipy)(H2O)]$2H2O}n possesses a 1-D double chain structure featuring anti–syn bridged {Zn2(OCO)2} dimeric units; unlike in 6, its sulfonate groups do not engage in ligation to zinc.34 The related phase {[Zn4(m3-OH)2(H2O)2(sip)2(4,40- bpy)2]$3H2O}n has a simple (4,4) grid topology with tetranuclear cluster nodes.35 Ditopic nitrogen-base ligands with a greater degree of conformational ﬂexibility appear to promote more complicated topologies in this system. [Zn2(m2-OH)(sip)(bpp)]n has a rare chiral (10,3)-d utp net and performs well in second harmonic generation,36 while {[Zn2(sip)(bix)3(OH)]$2H2O]}n (4) (bix ¼ 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-benzene) exhibits a 4-fold interpenetrated 42638 SrAl2 lattice.37 Luminescence spectra Excitation of polycrystalline samples of 1, 3, 4, and 6 with ultraviolet light (lex values: 1, 245 nm; 3, 315 nm; 4, 345 nm; 6, 315 nm) resulted in blue-violet visible light emission in all cases (Fig. 21). The respective emission maxima were 392, 480, 443, and 419 nm, for 1, 3, 4, and 6. The emissive behavior is attributed to ligand-centered p–p* or p–n electronic transitions within the pyridyl rings of the bpmp or Hbpmp+ tethers and/or the phenyl rings of the substituted isophthalate ligands, similar to that observed in other d10-metal coordination polymers constructed from aromatic ligands.5 Differences in the emission proﬁles may be rationalized by variances in the electron-donating abilities of the various 5-position substituents and carboxylate binding modes. Conclusions A series of six divalent zinc coordination polymers containing tethering bis(4-pyridylmethyl)piperazine and 5-substituted iso- phthalate ligands has been structurally characterized. The dicarboxylate ligand with the sterically least demanding substituent, 5-hydroxyisophthalate, perhaps not unexpectedly resulted in the same 5-fold interpenetrated 3-D diamondoid lattice seen in its unsubstituted isophthalate analog.16 However, all other substituents produced different structural topologies. The bulkier substituents of the 5-methoxyisophthalate ligands appeared to promote a reduction in the dimensionality to a simple polymeric grid, seen in two other related phases. Steri- cally demanding tert-butylisophthalate resulted in the formation of dinuclear units and a 2-fold interpenetrated primitive cubic network. Materials containing the 5-nitroisophthalate ligand exhibited the most complex topologies within the series, and show a signiﬁcant anion dependence on the structure. It is plausible that the presence of the electron withdrawing nitro groups encouraged greater Lewis acidity of zinc centers in 1 along with chloride ion binding, which in turn required the necessity of piperazinyl nitrogen protonation for charge balance. Enhanced Lewis acidity could potentially have promoted higher coordination numbers at zinc in 2, providing impetus for the intriguing zinc/dicarboxylate ribbon underpinning the complex highly connected interpenetrated network topology. The ligating ability of the sulfonate groups in 6 instilled greater covalent interactions between structural components and fostered a new 3-D binodal topology, different from those seen in previously reported zinc 5-sulfoisophthalate coordination polymers. In all cases, cooperative effects between coordination geometry, dicarboxylate binding mode, and the covalent and supramolec- ular interactions provided by the bpmp ligands are responsible for structure direction in this system.

Hydrogen atoms bound to carbon atoms were placed in calculated positions and reﬁned isotropically with a riding model. The hydrogen atoms bound to the piperazinyl nitrogen atom of the Hbpmp+ ligands in 1 and 2, and water molecules where possible, were found via Fourier difference maps, then restrained at ﬁxed positions and reﬁned isotropically. The carboxylate oxygen atom O3 within the OMeip ligands in 5 was disordered over two symmetry related positions across the crystallographic mirror plane.
