Poly-dentate organic linkers with rigid backbone and diverging carboxylic and pyridyl functions have been widely utilized in the construction of polymeric frameworks with a variety of metal ion connectors. Metal-organic architectures with flexible ligands deserved lesser attention, possibly because of the increased difficulty to predict the structures of the resulting complexes during the self-assembly process.8,9 Nevertheless, there are successful examples in the literature that MOFs characterized by flexible and tunable pores can also reveal very attractive features of sorption and selectivity.10,11 Another advantageous factor is that, the architecture of flexible MOFs can be changed upon interaction with (sorption of) potential guest molecules, adjusting their topology to the shape or size of the incoming guest by structural rearrangement. The selectivity and flexibility of such MOFs can be readily modulated by modifications of the organic bridging ligands.12 Following our earlier insights into the formulation of metal-organic frameworks with rigid as well as flexible linkers,13,14 we evaluate in this report the supramolecular coordination features of a newly synthesized flexible ligand 5-(3,5-dicarboxybenzyloxy)-3-pyridine carboxylic acid (H3L; Scheme 1). While, in the preceding papers of this series we focused on coordination polymers of flexible tetracarboxylic acid ligands, H3L contains only three diverging carboxylic acid residues, the fourth one being replaced by a pyridyl functionality known of its remarkable coordination capacity to transition metal ions. H3L is closely related to the 5-(3,5)- (dicarboxybenzyloxy)isophthalic acid (H4L') analogue, the framework solids of which have been studied earlier,14a and preserves the polydentate metal-coordination capacity in diverging Page 3 of 22 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 22 February 2013 Published on 01 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE27023H View Article Online 4 directions. Thus, we report herein the synthesis, structural characterization, and magnetic properties of five novel three-dimensional (3D) coordination polymers of this flexible tetra- dentate organic linker with cadmium(II) [Cd3(L)2(H2O)2(DMA)2(H2O)]n·S (S=intra-lattice solvent; either DMA, or a mixture of DMA and water) (1), copper(II) [Cu3(L)2(H2O)2]n·S (2), cobalt(II) [Co3(L)2(H2O)6]n·S (3), manganese(II) [Mn3(L)2(H2O)5(DMF)]n·S (4), and nickel (II) [Ni3(L)2(H2O)6]n·S (5), that yielded products in crystalline form suitable for detailed crystallographic analysis. Scheme 1. Molecular structure of 5-(3,5)-(dicarboxybenzyloxy)-3-pyridine carboxylic acid (H3L). In the corresponding tetra-acid analogue of similar backbone (H4L') the pyridine N-site is replaced by the C-COOH fragment.14a Experimental All chemicals for the syntheses were commercially available reagents of analytical grade and were used without further purification. The FT-IR spectra were recorded from KBr pellets in the 4000–400 cm-1 range on a Nicolet 5DX spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were taken on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris l (30–600°C, 5°C min-1, flowing N2(g)). Nitrogen sorption isotherm was measured using the Quantachrome Nova 1001 volumetric adsorption equipment. The magnetic data were collected on a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID-XL-5 magnetometer using crushed single-crystal samples. Magnetic data were corrected for the diamagnetic contribution calculated from Pascal constants15 and a background of the sample holder. Preparation of H3L: Methyl 5-hydroxy 3-pyridinecarboxylate (155 mg 1.01 mmol) was dissolved in 20 ml acetonitrile, and then anhydrous K2CO3 was added. The mixture was heated to reflux. After that Diethyl 5-bromomethyl isophalate (352 mg, 1 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was refluxed further for 6 hr. Then, the solvent was removed and water was Page 4 of 22 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 22 February 2013 Published on 01 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE27023H View Article Online 5 added to yield brown solid. (Yield 295 mg, 75%). The second step is, to dissolve the isolated ester (1.935 g, 5 mmol) and NaOH (0.6 g, 15 mmol) in 20 mL of ethanol:water (4 : 1). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 4 h at 80°C, after which the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, 10 mL of water was added into it, and the solution was acidified (pH=2) with dilute HCl solution. The obtained white solid product H3L was filtered and washed with water until free from acid. Yield: 62%.

The mixture was heated for 24 h in a bath-reactor at temperature of 120°C, and after cooling to room temperature green crystals were obtained, separated by filtration, washed with water and DMA, and then dried in air. The yield was approximately 41% based on metal salt.

Crystal structure determinations: The X-ray measurements [Bruker-ApexDuo (1, 2, 4, 5) and Nonius-KappaCCD (3) diffractometers, MoKα radiation) were carried out at ca. 110(2)K on crystals coated with a thin layer of amorphous oil to minimize crystal deterioration, possible structural disorder and related thermal motion effects, and to optimise the precision of the structural results. These structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares (SIR-97 and SHELXL-97).16,17 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were located in idealized/calculated positions and were refined using a riding model; some of those involved in hydrogen bonds were located directly in difference-Fourier maps but were not refined. All compounds were found to contain disordered crystallization solvent (DMA, DMF or a mixture of DMA and water) within the intra-lattice voids. In 1 and 4 another molecule of DMA and DMF (respectively) was found to coordinate in a disordered manner to the Cd/Mn ions. The non-coordinated solvent species could be clearly recognized in difference electron-density maps. In 3 and 5 their disordered structure could be resolved and included in the least-squares refinement. In 1, 2, and 4 the interstitial solvent could not be reliably modeled by discrete atoms due to severe disorder, and the contribution of the disordered solvent moieties was subtracted from the diffraction pattern by the SQUEEZE procedure and PLATON software.18 However, the crystallographic refinements of the metal- Page 6 of 22 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 22 February 2013 Published on 01 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE27023H View Article Online 7 organic frameworks converged at acceptable R-values, providing a reliable description of the coordination schemes. The crystallographic and experimental data for 1-5 are given in Table 1. The uniform identity of the formed crystal lattices in a given reaction were confirmed in each case by spectroscopic data as well as by uniform morphology of crystals in the bulk and repeated measurements of the unit-cell dimensions from different single crystallites. FT-IR Spectra: The FTIR spectra of compounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are displayed in the Supporting Information (Figure S1 to S5). The spectra of compounds 1-5 show broad absorption at 3200-3500 cm-1 which indicates the presence of coordinated water molecules. The strong band at 1360-1650 cm-1 of all compounds is characteristic of the carbonyl groups. The absorption at 1275 cm-1 is attributed for the C-O-C stretching vibration of CPh-O-C groups. In the 490–420 cm- 1 range there are some medium and weak bands that could be assigned to the γ(M–O) stretching vibrations. Results and discussion H3L belongs to a family of simple flexible organic scaffolds with two functionalized aryl groups inter-connected via an aliphatic -C-O- spacer. Lateral positioning on their periphery of carboxylic acid and pyridyl sites of high coordination propensity to transition metal ions oriented in diverging directions makes these ligands excellent building blocks for the construction of polymeric metal-organic frameworks. This has been demonstrated already in the preceding paper focusing on the metal-organic networks of the tetra-acid H4L' moiety with various divalent metal ions and a 2:1 metal:L' ratio. In direct continuation, we focus in the present work on the metal- coordination features of the similar H3L scaffold which bears three carboxylic acid and one pyridyl binding sites (instead of four carboxylic substituents) The supramolecular reactions between H3L and salts of divalent metal ions (Cd, Cu, Co, Mn and Ni) yielded in this case framework solids with three-dimensional connectivity schemes and 3:2 metal-ligand stoichiometry. The latter accounts for charge balance, being associated with full de-protonation of the tri-carboxylic acid ligand. Correspondingly, the asymmetric unit in the analyzed structures contains one metal ion located on special position (crystallographic inversion in 2-5 or axis of twofold rotation in 1), the second metal and the organic linker L occupying general positions in the unit-cell. In all five structures L is characterized by a twisted conformation, with the pyridyl Page 7 of 22 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 22 February 2013 Published on 01 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE27023H View Article Online 8 and phenyl rings being oriented roughly or nearly perpendicular to each other, and the four ligating sites pointing at pseudo-tetrahedral directions. The observed dihedral angles between the mean planes of the two aryls are 65.44(9), 77.63(8), 88.28(7), 89.33(11) and 88.45(10)° in 1-5, respectively. In spite of the flexible nature of the organic backbone of H3L, the flat conformer14a of this ligand with low dihedral angles between the planes of the aromatic rings have not been expressed thus far in the available crystals. The intermolecular coordination scheme in 1 is illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. The complex metal-ligand coordination scheme in 1. The two crystallographically independent metal ions (yellow spheres) are denoted by Cd1 and Cd2, the former being located on twofold rotation axis (indicated by a vertical arrow). The DMA ligands (only their O-sites are shown as red spheres) supplement the coordination environment of Cd1. The extended framework is tessellated by three-nuclear Cd2···Cd1···Cd2 connectors arranged about axes of twofold rotation and surrounded by ligating sites of eight organic moieties (two pyridyls and six carboxylates). Each of the metal ions in the cluster connects to four different ligands: the central Cd1 located on the twofold axis binds in to four carboxylates of the neighboring ligands (as well as to two DMA moieties, while the Cd2 center coordinates to three carboxylate groups and one pyridyl site of four different ligands. Cd1 and Cd2 on each side Page 8 of 22 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 22 February 2013 Published on 01 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE27023H View Article Online 9 of the cluster connector are bridged by two carboxylates in a µ2-η1-η1-bridging mode, while two other carboxylates connect between all three metal centers in µ3-η2-η1-bridging manner. Cd2 reveals also chelating bi-dentate link to another carboxylate and a mono-dentate bond to the pyridyl function. The two distinct cadmium ions (Cd1···Cd2 = 3.623 Å) are thus six-coordinate. Every L-linker binds in turn to four different three-metal-ion clusters, yielding an open three- dimensional coordination framework (Fig. 2). All the Cd-O/N coordination distances are within the 2.245-2.391(2) Å range. Fig. 2. The crystal structure of 1. The Cd-coordinated DMA species and the interstitial solvent are omitted.

Node-and-linker-type views of the framework connectivity in 1, (using TOPOS19), approximately down: (a) the a-axis and (b) the b-axis. The organic linker is depicted in blue, while the Cd-centers are purple. The topologies of the framework solids obtained in this work have been analyzed with the TOPOS (v. 4.0) software, reducing the complex structure to a simpler node-and-linker net.19 In 1 the coordination polymers can be best described as a (4,5,7)-connected 3-nodal net with Schlafli symbol {411.610}2{45.6}{47.63}2 (Fig. 3). The intra-lattice solvent-accessible voids in 1 account for about 29% of the crystal volume, accommodating non-coordinated DMA molecules. In 2 the polymeric framework is tessellated by metal ion connectors of two different types. The mono-nuclear node Cu1 (located on crystallographic inversion) doubly coordinates between two different inversion-related ligand moieties via N-Cu1-N and -OOC-Cu1-COO- bonds at Cu-N = 2.012(2) and Cu-O = 1.937(2) Å (Fig. 4). The remaining carboxylate groups on bothe sides of each ligand associate with two different di-nuclear paddle-wheel connecting nodes Cu2(COO-)4(H2O)2 also clustered around an inversion center. The inner Cu2···Cu2 distance within the di-nuclear cluster is 2.6704(6) Å. Each such Cu2 pair is coordinated to four carboxylate functions of four different bent ligands at Cu-Ocarboxylate within 1.952-1.969(2) Å, as well as to two molecules of water at 2.139(2) Å. The binding mode of the carboxylate groups is mono-dentate to Cu1 (with second O-site of the carboxylate group, perching at the Cu1 center at 2.632 Å) and chelating bi-dentate to the (Cu2)2 site (Fig. 4). Every linker moiety is thus associated with two paddle-wheel connectors and one mono-nuclear node Cu1. Fig. 4. Crystal packing of structure 2 projected down the a-axis. Note the alternating arrangement of the mono- nuclear and di-nuclear Cu-connectors (orange spheres) tessellating the structure into a single-framework coordination polymer. Note the different binding modes at Cu1 and Cu2. The Cu2-bound water moieties are denoted by red spheres. The non-coordinating DMA molecules located within the channel voids are omitted, to emphasize the open architecture of this net.

It is perforated by intra-lattice channel voids that propagate along the a-axis of the crystal. These voids account for about 56% of the crystal volume, accommodating one partly ordered and one severely disordered molecules of the DMA crystallization solvent per asymmetric unit. The topology of the open framework is shown in Fig. 5 by the node-and-linker representation.19 It is best described as a 4,5,6-connected 3-nodal net with Schlafli symbol {32.4.68.84}2{34.46}2{42.6.82.10}. (a) (b) Fig. 5. Node-and-linker-type views of the framework connectivity in 2, (using TOPOS19 and excluding the Cu2-coordinated water species), approximately down: (a) the b-axis and (b) the a- axis. The organic linker is depicted in blue, while the Cu-centers are purple. Compounds 3 (with Co nodes) and 5 (with Ni nodes) are isomorphous. The same applies to compound 4 (with Mn nodes), except for one metal ligated water moiety being replaced by a disordered DMF ligand. Otherwise, the framework connectivity features are the same in the three compounds, as represented by the structure of compound 3 discussed below. In structures 3-5 the organic linker is L-shaped, the torsion angle between the two aromatic residues being nearly 90°. Every ligand is coordinated to four different mono-nuclear metal-ion connectors, as opposed to three-nuclear and di-nuclear nodes in the previous examples. In 3, on the bi-carboxylic side of L one carboxylate coordinates to Co1 and the other to Co2 (Fig. 6). On the pyridyl side of L the Npyridyl group connects to Co1 and the remaining carboxylate to Co2. Each of the metal connectors is six-coordinate an include molecules of water in their octahedral coordination Page 11 of 22 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 22 February 2013 Published on 01 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE27023H View Article Online 12 sphere with the following composition: Co1(Npyridyl)2(COO-)2(H2O)2 and Co2(COO-)2(H2O)4. All the Co-carboxylate bonds are mono-dentate. This three-dimensional architecture can be classified as a 4,4-connected 2-nodal net with Schlafli symbol {4.64.8}2{42.62.82}.19 Fig. 6. The metal-ligand coordination scheme in 3. All the Co-N/O bond distances are within 2.081-2.156(2) Å. Fig. 7. Node-and-linker-type view of the framework interpenetration in 3, (using TOPOS19 and excluding the Co-coordinated water species) downs the c-axis. The two interweaved nets are depicted in blue and purple colors. In general, crystallization of open coordination frameworks requires filling the empty voids by incorporation of the crystallization solvent in the crystal lattice, or by interweaving of two or more frameworks during the crystallization process, or both. The crystal structure of 3 consists of two interpenetrated nets as shown in Fig. 7. The resulting interweaved lattice is still perforated by wide channel voids that propagate both along the as well c-axes of the crystal. In the crystalline material these are filled by additional molecules of the DMA and water (in a 1:2 Page 12 of 22 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 22 February 2013 Published on 01 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE27023H View Article Online 13 ratio) solvent. As indicated above the Ni-structure 5 is isomorphous with 3. It contains the Ni1(Npyridyl)2(COO-)2(H2O)2 and Ni2(COO-)2(H2O)4 coordination synthons with Ni-N/O bond lengths within 2.027-2.100(3) Å. Compound 4 is slightly different in one of the metallic connectors Mn1(Npyridyl)2(COO-)2(H2O)2 and Mn2(COO-)2(H2O)3(DMF), but it is characterized by a very similar framework architecture. In 3-5, the metal-bound water moieties are involved in a vast array of hydrogen bonds (as detailed in the corresponding CIFs) that further link between the individual nets of the interweaved assembly. Thermal analysis: TGA and DTA analysis of the complexes (see Figures S6-S10 for compounds 1-5 in Supporting Information) was performed under N2 atmosphere varying the temperature to about 600°C at heating rate of 5°C min-1. 1 exhibits weight loss of 3.1% near 76°C due to release of the uncoordinated water and DMA molecules. Further weight loss of 15.7%, at the 100-320°C range, accounts for the removal of the coordinated DMA molecules (calculated: 16.06%). Decomposition of this material occurs above 380°C. TGA curve of compound 2 also exhibits of weight loss of 4.9% around 55°C, corresponding to escape of the uncoordinated water and DMA molecules. At the temperature range of 180-200°C, further 6.02% weight loss corresponds to desorption of the coordinated water species (calcd.: 6.8%). Decomposition of 2 occurs above 346oC. TGA curve of compound 4 exhibits a weight loss of 5.9% around 72°C, corresponding to release of the uncoordinated water and DMF molecule. At the temperature range of 100-150°C, further 16.6% weight loss corresponds to desorption of the coordinated water and DMF molecules (calcd.: 16.4%). Decomposition of this material occurs above 472°C. TGA curves of compounds 3 and 5 shows a weight loss at 50-60 oC corresponding to escape of uncoordinated water and DMA molecules. At the temperature range 100-150oC show weight loss of 8.4% and 7.9%, respectively, which corresponds to the release of coordinated water molecules (the corresponding calculated values are 8.8% and 8.7%). Decomposition of these interweaved frameworks was observed only above 425°C. Magnetic Measurements: The complexes 3, 4 and 5 are isomorphous and show one common structural motif. Two different types of metal coordination sites are observed in the reported complexes (Fig. 6). The magnetic susceptibilities of all complexes were measured in the temperature range of 5–300 K under the field of 500 Oe. The variation of XM and XMT with temperature of complex 3 is shown in Fig. 8. The XMT value at 300 K is 6.24 Cm3 K mol−1, which is higher than the calculated value of 5.625 Cm3 K mol−1 for three uncoupled Co(II) ions, Page 13 of 22 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 22 February 2013 Published on 01 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE27023H View Article Online 14 with spin value 3/2 and Landé g value of 2. This result is consistent with the well-documented orbital angular momentum contribution of the octahedral Co(II) ion with a 4T1g ground state at high temperature.20,21 With decreasing temperature, the XMT value decreases smoothly to a value of 5.62 Cm3 K mol−1 at 100 K, then reaches a minimum of 1.99 Cm3 K mol−1 at 5 K. The XM -1 vs. T plot gives a straight line which indicates the paramagnetic behavior of the complex (see supporting information Figure S11). Fitting of data obey the Curie−Weiss law which gives the Curie constant C = 2.13 Cm3 K mol−1 and Weiss constant θ = −18.5 K. The negative Weiss constant value indicates the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling between the Co(II) ions, although the spin−orbit coupling and anisotropy can also contribute to this value. However the antiferromagnetic interaction are small (small Weiss constant value) because there is no direct caboxylate bridge or oxo bridge present in the molecule.22,23 The Co···Co distances in 3 are very large (7.612 and 7.494 Å) and there is no ferromagnetic interactions observed between these metal centers. Fig. 8: Plots of the temperature dependence of XMT and XM for compound 3. The plots of XMT and XM -1 vs. temperature of compound 4 are shown in Fig. 9. The experimental XMT value at 300 K is about 12.89 Cm3 K mol−1, is very close to calculated value 13.12 Cm3 K mol−1 for three uncoupled Mn(II) ions with spin value 5/2 and Landé g value of 2.20,21 The XMT vs T plot decreases slowly as temperature goes down, at temperatures below 50 K Page 14 of 22 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 22 February 2013 Published on 01 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE27023H View Article Online 15 the decrease in the XMT product is more pronounced. Upon cooling down at 5K the value is 2.90 Cm3 K mol−1. The inverse susceptibility plot as a function of temperature is linear above 50 K, following the Curie–Weiss law with a Weiss constant, θ = -16.4 K. The negative Weiss constant suggests that there exists antiferromagnetic interaction between two Mn centers.24 The decreasing XMT value upon cooling and the negative intercept for the reciprocal susceptibility seems to indicate the presence of slight antiferromagnetic interactions between the metal centers. It has been well known in the literature that, oxo and carboxylate bridge metal complexes generally show strong antiferromagnetic interaction which is characterized by more negative Weiss constant value.24 The large Mn….Mn distances (7.696 and 7.501 Å) and the absence any oxo/carboxy bridging elements reduces the antiferromagnetic interaction. Fig. 9. Plots of the temperature dependence of XMT and XM -1 for compound 4. The plots of XM -1 and XM versus temperature of complex 5 are shown in Fig. 10. At 300 K, XMT is 3.79 cm3 K mol-1 which is very close to the calculated value for three uncoupled Ni(II) ions with spin value 1 and Landé g value of 2. This results are also good agreement with the reported value for Ni(II) complexes in a distorted octahedral coordination geometry.25 Upon cooling the XMT value decreases and reaches a minima of 1.89 cm3 K mol-1 at 5K. The XM -1 versus T plot above 50 K obeys the Curie-Weiss law, XM =C/(T-θ), with a Weiss constant θ = - 11.46 K and a Curie constant C = 1.12 cm3 K mol-1. The decreasing XMT value upon cooling and Page 15 of 22 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 22 February 2013 Published on 01 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE27023H View Article Online 16 the negative intercept for the reciprocal susceptibility seems to indicate the presence of slight antiferromagnetic interactions between the local spin triplet states of the octahedral Ni(II).25 Fig. 10. Plots of the temperature dependence of XM and XM -1 for compounds 5. Gas absorption study. The potential porosity of guest-free (activated) Cu-complex 2 (the compound with the largest solvent accessible voids) was studied by sample gas adsorption measurements. Based on TGA analyses (vide supra), the crystal sample of 2 was dried under a high vacuum at 150°C for 24 h to remove the lattice-included solvent. The dehydrated sample of 2 was placed in a quartz tube to measure nitrogen adsorption and its adsorption/desorption behavior is presented in Fig. 11. The type-II sigmoid isotherm (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry classification) observed for N2 adsorption at 77 K of complex 2, which shows a hysteresis loop, is characteristic to non-porous solids. The calculated BET surface area of 2 for nitrogen sorption is very small, 0.09 m2/g, and only about 2 mL of N2 was adsorbed per 1.0 g of de-solvated sample at 1 atm. Compounds 1 and 3 also showed limited porosity and negligible sorption features towards di-nitrogen, and were not analyzed any further.

Concluding remarks H3L is yet another attractive organic ligand with high propensity to form extended coordination networks with transition metal-ion linkers. It has a flexible conformation-tunable backbone, bearing three carboxylate (after de-protonation) and one pyridyl potential ligating sites to transition metal ions oriented in diverging directions. Not surprisingly, therefore, successful construction of framework solids with three-dimensional connectivity features has been confirmed above by reacting this organic linker with a series of bi-valent metals. The optimized (i.e. involving all potentially ligating sites) metal-ligand stochiometry of the framework architectures is dictated the requirement for charge balance. Correspondingly, it is 3:2 in this study with the H3L tri-acid linker, but 2:1 with the H4L' tetra-carboxylic acid analog used in the previous work.14a The observed structures 1-5 differ in the nuclearity of the metal connectors, from three-nuclear Cd3 clusters in 1, mono-nuclear (Cu) and di-nuclear (Cu2) clusters in 2, to mono-nuclear Co/Mn/Ni nodes in 3-5. The flexible nature of H3L allows the ligand to conformationally adjust to the different interaction types. The inability to control the metal- ligand binding modes as well as the issue of network interpenetration, present a major weakness in this type of crystal engineering investigations. In all the resulting materials, which did not show any practical di-nitrogen sorption, solvent molecules from the reaction mixture (water, DMA, DMF) were found to supplement (in an unpredictable manner) the coordination Page 17 of 22 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by University of Illinois at Chicago on 22 February 2013 Published on 01 February 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE27023H View Article Online 18 requirements of the given metal ion connectors. In summary, the take-home message from this and the preceding study is that it is relatively easy to design multi-dentate organic linkers with diverging molecular recognition groups for the construction of framework-polymeric solids. It is much more difficult to control the topology and the porosity of the supramolecular architectures that form.
