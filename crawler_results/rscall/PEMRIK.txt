Over the last decade, MOFs1 have been developed into a promising class of functional porous materials by judiciously custom-designing organic linkers and carefully selecting metal ions or clusters as nodes.2 Via self-assembly of the custom-designed organic ligands and the metal-containing secondary building blocks (SBUs), the modular construction of MOFs has been well established, and the structural topology of MOFs could also be predicted. Owing to high porosity, tuneable pore sizes, and pore walls that can be functionalized,3 MOFs have exhibited potential for a wide range of applications such as gas storage,4 separation,5 heterocatalysis,6 sensors7 and other areas.8 Of particular interest among these applications for MOFs is CO2 capture, which has attracted escalating attention due to global warming mainly triggered by the emission of CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels.9 An important context of CO2 capture by MOFs lies in developing various strategies to enhance the CO2 adsorption capacity at ambient temperatures.10 One of the well-studied strategies to enhance CO2 capacity is to expose coordinatively unsaturated open metal sites typically via thermal liberation of coordinated labile ligands,11 and this has aﬀorded exceptionally high CO2 uptake capacities in some MOFs, e.g. MOF-74 series.12 However, the open metal sites can rapidly re-adsorb water molecules thus inevitably leading to a remarkable drop in CO2 uptake capacity upon exposure to moisture.13 Another widely explored strategy is to introduce chemical bonding with CO2 molecules by grafting functional amine groups into MOFs via the route of post-synthetic modiﬁcation.8e,14 Although amine- grafted MOFs have demonstrated signiﬁcant enhancement of CO2 uptake15 or even exhibited record isosteric heats of adsorption of 90–100 kJ mol1,16 a substantial amount of energy is required to break the CO2–amine chemical bonding during the regeneration process. In this contribution, we report a diﬀerent strategy by incorporating 1,2,3-triazolate moieties that feature exposed N atoms as relative moderate Lewis base centers compared to amine groups to enhance the CO2 uptake in MOFs. The incorporation of 1,2,3-triazolate moieties into a pillared MOF has led to remarkable enhancement of CO2 uptake capacity as well as signiﬁcant boost of heats of adsorption for CO2. Pillared MOFs have recently been widely explored as a type of platform for gas storage/separation, and they consist of two-dimensional (2D) layers that have ligating sites for linkage with ditopic pillars usually of dipyridine derivatives into three- dimensional (3D) architectures.17 The structures and properties of pillared MOFs are readily tuned by functionalizing either the linkers within the 2D layers or the ditopic pillared ligands. One of the prototypal pillared MOF structures is MOF-508 (Fig. 1a),18 in which the 2D layers based upon 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (bdc) and the dizinc paddle-wheel cluster are pillared by 4,40-bypyridine (bpy) to aﬀord a 3D two-fold interpenetrating a-Po network (Scheme 1). To decorate MOF-508 with 1,2,3- triazolate moieties, we designed a new dipyridine derivative ligand, 4,40-(2H-1,2,3-triazole-2,4-diyl)dipyridine (tadp). As expected, the self-assembly of tadp with bdc and dizinc paddle-wheel cluster generated in situ gave rise to MTAF-3 (Metal–TriAzolate Framework, MTAF) (Scheme 1),19 which is isostructural with MOF-508 but exhibits much higher CO2 uptake capacity than the parent MOF-508. Yellow block crystals of MTAF-3 were obtained via solvo- thermal reaction of bdc, tadp and Zn(NO3)26H2O in N,N- diethylformamide (DEF) at 85 1C for 48 hours. Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic studies reveal that MTAF-3z crystallizes in the space group C2/c with a formula [Zn4(bdc)4(tadp)2]- (DEF)2(H2O) as estimated from crystallographic data, elemental analysis, and TGA studies. As predicted, MTAF-3 is isostructural with MOF-508, and is composed of paddle-wheel dinuclear zinc carboxylate units [Zn2(COO)4] that are bridged by the bdc ligands to form distorted 2D square grids, which are further pillared by tadp ligands instead of bpy via coordinating the axial sites of the [Zn2(COO)4] paddle wheels to result in a 3D framework a Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, 4202 East Flower Avenue, Tampa, Florida 33620, USA.

Commun., 2012, 48, 8898–8900 8899 with a-Po topology (Fig. 1b). It’s worth noting that the nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 3 positions of the 1,2,3-triazole moieties are oriented to the channels and are accessible for guest molecules to interact with. Similar to MOF-508, MTAF-3 also possesses two-fold interpenetration, which reduces its pore size to B4.6 A˚ (Fig. 1b and c). However, MTAF-3 is still porous and has a solvent accessible volume of 39.4% calculated using PLATON, which is higher than that of MOF-508 (12.1%).20 The phase purity of the bulk sample MTAF-3 was conﬁrmed by powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) studies (Fig. S1, ESIw). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the fresh MTAF-3 sample revealed a weight loss of about B32% from 30 to B200 1C corresponding to the loss of guest solvent molecules of DEF and H2O trapped in the channels; it is followed by a steady plateau from B200 to 400 1C before complete decomposition of the framework (Fig. S2, ESIw). TGA studies on the solvent-free MTAF-3 sample (Fig. S2, ESIw) further conﬁrmed its thermal stability up to B400 1C, and also highlighted the robustness of the two-fold interpenetrating pillared framework of MTAF-3 (Fig. 1d). To assess the permanent porosity of MTAF-3, gas adsorption studies were conducted on the activated sample. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the N2 isotherm at 77 K reveals that MTAF-3 exhibits an uptake capacity of B300 cm3 g1 at the saturation pressure with typical type-I adsorption behaviour, as expected for microporous materials. Derived from the N2 isotherm at 77 K, MTAF-3 possesses a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 1175 m2 g1 (P/P0 = 0.01–0.1) corresponding to a Langmuir surface area of 1307 m2 g1 (P/P0 = 0.9). The BET surface area of MOF-508 is 743 m2 g1 (Langmuir surface area: B900 m2 g1), which is comparable to that reported in the literature.18 Therefore, the decoration of MOF-508 with 1,2,3-triazole moieties has resulted in an increase of B60% in BET surface area. The orientation of two open nitrogen atoms in each 1,2,3-triazole moiety toward the channels may facilitate the interactions with CO2 molecules, and this prompted us to evaluate the CO2 uptake performances of MTAF-3. As shown in Fig. 2(b), MTAF-3 can adsorb a substantial amount of CO2 with an uptake capacity of 10.0 wt% at 273 K under 1 atm of pressure, meaning an enhancement by a factor of 2.7 compared to MOF-508 under the same conditions. It has been well documented that the enlargement of pore sizes will lead to decrease of low pressure CO2 uptake of MOFs at ambient temperatures despite the increase in surface area.10a Therefore, we speculate that the remarkable enhancement of CO2 uptake observed for MTAF-3 could be mainly attributed to the stronger CO2–framework interactions exerted by the Lewis base nitrogen Fig. 1 (a) Building unit of MOF-508; (b) building unit of MTAF-3; (c) space-ﬁlling picture of interpenetrating MTAF-3 viewed from the b direction; (d) space-ﬁlling picture of interpenetrating MTAF-3 viewed from the c direction.

Commun., 2012, 48, 8898–8900 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 atoms of 1,2,3-triazole moieties. This could be inferred from the shapes of the CO2 adsorption isotherms for MTAF-3 and MOF-508, and the steeper slope is the stronger interactions between the framework and CO2 gas molecules.21 We calculated the heats of adsorption (Qst) of CO2 for MTAF-3 and MOF-508 based upon the CO2 adsorption isotherms at 273 K and 298 K using the virial method.22 As shown in Fig. 2(c), MTAF-3 exhibits a constant Qst of B29 kJ mol1, which is B3 kJ mol1 higher than that of MOF-508 (Qst of B26 kJ mol1). These results further validate the contribution of 1,2,3-triazole moieties to the enhancement of CO2 uptake in MTAF-3. In summary, the incorporation of 1,2,3-triazole moieties into the prototypal pillared MOF, MOF-508, using the custom- designed pillar ligand, 4,40-(2H-1,2,3-triazole-2,4-diyl)dipyridine, aﬀorded a porous metal–triazolate framework, MTAF-3, which demonstrates remarkable enhancement of CO2 uptake capacity by a factor of B3 and a signiﬁcant increase in Qst of CO2 by an average of B3 kJ mol1 compared to the parent MOF-508. The strategy of incorporating 1,2,3-triazole functional groups that provide moderate Lewis base centers into MOFs represents a promising way to construct new types of porous MOFs with enhanced CO2 uptake performances. Ongoing work in our laboratories includes the custom-design of new variants of 1,2,3-triazole-based ligands for the construction of functional MTAFs and exploring them for application in CO2 capture, sensors and catalysis.

Indexing was performed using APEX2 (Difference Vectors method).3 Data integration and reduction were performed using SaintPlus 6.01.4 Absorption correction was performed by multi-scan method implemented in SADABS.5 Space groups were determined using XPREP implemented in APEX2.3 MTAF-3 was solved using SHELXS-97 (direct methods) and refined using SHELXL-97 (full-matrix least-squares on F2) contained in APEX2 [2] and WinGX.6,7,8,9 All non-H atoms were found in the difference Fourier map and refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions and included in the refinement process using riding model with isotropic thermal parameters: Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(-CH), Uiso(H) = 1.5Ueq(-CH3). The occupancy of O10 water molecule has been established through the refinement to be ~ 0.5. The contribution of disordered DEF molecules was treated as diffuse using Squeeze procedure implemented in Platon program.10,11 Crystal data and refinement conditions are shown in Table S1.
