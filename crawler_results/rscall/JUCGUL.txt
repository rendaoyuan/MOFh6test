Currently, the sensitive and selective detection of nitro explosives has been attracted an immense attention due to their broad range of applications in security operations, environmental protection, forensic investigations and mine-field analysis.1 Among the common nitro explosives such as 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP or Picric acid (PA)) and nitrobenzene (NB), PA is extremely hazardous and strong explosive. However, little attention has been paid for the sensitive and selective detection of PA.2 Besides, PA is also commonly used in leather and pharmaceutical industries, dyes, fireworks and can be easily contaminated into ground water and soil once it released to the environment.3 Furthermore, contamination of PA in ground water and soil can creates severe health problems like anemia, male infertility, respiratory organs damage etc.4 Thus the selective, rapid and convenient detection of PA is on high demand for preventing environmental pollution and tracing buried explosives. On the other hand, as a rare transition metal, Palladium (Pd2+) has wide spectrum of applications in materials, electronics and heterogeneous catalysis.5 However, the presence of palladium even in extreme low concentration can create very serious health complexity such as cytotoxic effects, skin and eye allergies.6 Apart from this, Pd2+ ions can bind to biomolecules such as amino acids, DNA and RNA, proteins and regulate a variety of cellular processes.7 In order to restrict such hazards, environmental agencies proposed that, the maximum dietary intake of Palladium is <1.5-15 µg day-1 per person and its threshold in drugs is 5-10 ppm.8 Therefore, the highly selective and sensitive detection of trace amounts of Pd2+ is also very important in environmental as well as human health concerns. Although various spectroscopic and analytical techniques are known for the detection of nitroaromatics and hazardous metals but many of them are expensive, less sensitive and have portability issues during in- field use.9 Recently, Fluorescence-based chemosensors for the detection of nitroaromatics or metal ions have attracted great attention because of their high sensitivity, portability, rapid response time and convenient visual detection.10 Among the several fluorescence based sensors, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a new generation sensors for explosives and metal ions due to their designable architectures and tunable chemical and physical properties.1, 11 MOFs have already been proved as an intriguing class of materials owing to their tremendous potential for diverse applications.12 In particular, luminescent MOFs provide several advantages over conventional fluorophores.1 It has been reported that, introduction of electron rich π- conjugated ligands for the construction of MOFs could give an efficient luminescent sensory material for the detection of nitroaromatic explosives.1 In this work, we have chosen a highly conjugated, rigid bpeb linker (bpeb = 1,4-bis [2-(4-pyridyl)ethenyl] benzene) in combination with π- electron-rich tetra-topic carboxylate ligand (H4tcpb = 1,2,4,5,- Tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene) and synthesized a new luminescent MOF ({[Zn(C34H18O8)0.5(C20N2H16)0.5]∙0.5(C20N2H16).2H2O]}n (1) with Zn(NO3)2·6H2O. Although several Luminescent MOFs have been reported for the sensing of nitroaromatics and metal ions, but there is only one report available in the literature on specific sensing of Palladium by MOF material13 and there is no report on the dual sensing property of any MOFs for the selective detection of PA and Pd2+. The present compound shows the sensitive and selective detection of trace amounts of PA or Pd2+ even in presence of other competing analogues and works as an efficient dual sensor. SC-XRD analysis revealed that compound 1 crystallizes in triclinic system with P-1 space group and the asymmetric unit contains a Zn(II) cation, half of a tcpb ligand and one bpeb linker (Fig. S3). Each Zn(II) center adopts a square pyramidal geometry with four oxygen atoms from four different tcpb ligands and one nitrogen atom from bpeb linker (Fig. S4). The structure of compound 1 consists a paddle wheel type SBU ([Zn2(1,2,3,4-tcpb)4(bpeb)2]) with two Zn(II) centers, four tcpb ligands and two bpeb linkers (Fig. 1a). Each tcpb ligand holds four Page 1 of 5 ChemComm ChemComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 04 March 2015. Downloaded by Université Laval on 04/03/2015 16:56:03.

These layers are further pillared by bpeb linkers resluting a 3D interpenetrated framework with one dimensional channels along the b-direction (Fig. 1c). It is interesting to notice that, compound 1 contains two types of bpeb linkers, one is co-ordinated to two Zn(II) centers in bi-dentate fashion and the other one remains uncoordinated and resides in the channels (Fig. 1c). The free bpeb ligands are stabilized by noncovalent interactions (such as localized and semilocalized C-H···π [C56- H56···C6 = 2.835(4) Å], [C52-H52···C3/C4 = 2.614 Å], C-H···N [C39-H39···N3 = 2.689(4) Å] respectively) (Fig. S6). It is noteworthy to mention that, the 1D channels in the framework are occupied by bpeb ligands with coplanar π-conjugated arrangement and the walls are lined with π-electron-rich benzene moieties of tcpb making overall framework electron rich in nature. Fig. 1. a) SBU of compound 1, b) illustration of 2D layer along the a-axis, c) 3D view of compound 1. Color code: Zinc (green), Oxygen (red), Nitrogen (blue), Carbon (grey). The ligand arrangement as well as the π-electron rich environment in the entire framework stimulated us to investigate the sensing behavior of compound 1 towards nitroaromatic explosives. The photoluminescence spectrum of compound 1 dispersed in DMF exhibits a strong fluorescence band at 415 nm with a small shoulder at 393 nm upon excitation at 340 nm (Fig. S9). The shoulder is due to the inter- ligand charge transitions (LLCT) between free bpeb and co-ordinated bpeb ligands.14 To check the sensing ability of compound 1 towards different nitro aromatics, the fluorescence titration experiments have been carried out with the dispersed compound 1 by gradual addition of 1 mM stock solutions of various nitroaromatics such as NB, 1,2-DNB (1,2-dinitrobenzene), 1,3-DNB (1,3-dinitrobenzene), 1,4-DNB (1,4- dinitrobenzene), 4-NT (4-nitro toluene), 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT and PA. As shown in Fig. S10-S16 incremental addition of NB, 2,6-DNT, 2,4-DNT had minor effect on fluorescence intensity of compound 1 whereas 4- NT, 1,2-DNB, 1,3-DNB, 1,4-DNB shown negligible effect. Interestingly, compound 1 shows very good sensing behavior towards PA by quenching the initial fluorescence intensity by 94% (calculations in ESI) after adding 15.2 ppm of PA (Fig. 2a, c). The major fluorescence quenching of 26% can be clearly observed even at very low concentration of PA (1.5 ppm). The quenching efficiency of compound 1 is amongst the highest values reported for MOFs.1, 2a, 4a In addition to this, upon gradual addition of PA to the solution of compound 1, an immediate color change from colorless to pale yellow was observed which signifies a naked eye detection. However, in presence of other analytes no considerable color change in the solution of 1 was noticed (Fig. 2b). To verify the fluorescence response of 1 towards other aromatic substituents we have also performed the sensing experiments with Dimethyl benzene (DMB), Bromobenzene (BB) and 1,2-diamino benzene (1,2-DAB) but negligible quenching was observed (Fig. S17-S19). This indicates that, there is a strong interaction between PA and compound 1 which helps to show the high selective sensing behavior towards PA.

To investigate reason behind the selective sensing of PA as well as the quenching mechanism, we analyzed the quenching efficiencies of all the analytes by using Stern-Volmer equation15 (Details in ESI). The plot with PA shows a linear increase at low concentrations which upon deviates from linearity and turns to upward direction with increasing concentrations whereas the other nitro analytes showed only linear trend in S-V plots (Fig. 2d). From the linear fitting of the plot, the quenching constant for PA was found to be 8.1 x 104 M-1 which indicates the super quenching ability of compound 1 towards PA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest quenching constant value among the reported MOFs for selective sensing of PA to date.1 The nonlinear trend in the S-V plot is indicative of the energy transfer between PA and the framework or due to the combination of static and dynamic quenching mechanisms.15 These two mechanisms can be differentiated by measuring the life time of sensor in the presence and absence of the quencher. In the static mechanism the life time of the sensor will remain unchanged due to the formation of non-emissive ground state complex through the bonding between fluorophore and quencher. In dynamic quenching mechanism, the life time will be reduced due to the electron transfer between the excited state sensor and quencher through diffusion controlled collisions.15 To explore the quenching mechanism, we measured the fluorescence life time of compound 1 before and after the addition of PA. The average life time Page 2 of 5 ChemComm ChemComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 04 March 2015. Downloaded by Université Laval on 04/03/2015 16:56:03.

Name., 2012, 00, 1-3 | 3 remain unchanged even after the addition of PA suggesting that the quenching process follows static mechanism (Fig. S20). To get deeper insight, we have recorded the UV-vis spectrum of compound 1 in presence of PA (Fig. S21) and found that, upon gradual addition, a new band at 423 nm was appeared which confirms the formation of non- emissive ground state complex and also supporting the static mechanism.2a In case of other nitroanalytes no considerable change was observed in the spectral pattern (Fig. S22). From the above spectroscopic results it is very clear that there is a strong interaction between PA and compound 1 in the ground state. As PA contains two types of functional groups, to verify whether the hydroxyl group plays any role in sensing, we have done some experiments with hydroxyl substituted aromatic molecules but without nitro groups like catechol, 4-iodo phenol, 4-methoxy phenol, phloroglucinol. As shown in Fig S23-S26, no considerable quenching was observed in the emission spectrum with incremental addition of analytes which confirms that the whole PA molecule is playing the role in sensing.

To get more perception in to the selective sensing behavior of 1 towards PA in presence of other interfering nitro analytes, we performed some competition experiments by sequential addition of different nitroaromatics followed by PA into compound 1 and the corresponding emission spectra were recorded. As shown in Fig. S27-S33, the initial addition of different analytes show negligible intensity quenching but an effective quenching was observed after addition of PA solution. The similar trend was observed for almost all the nitroanalytes even in high concentrations which demonstrates the exceptional selectivity of compound 1 for PA. From the crystal structure, it can be seen that the pores are almost occupied by the free bpeb linkers and there is no chance for encapsulation of the nitroanalytes in to the pores. The adsorption isotherm of 1 with N2 further suggests that the fluorescence quenching due to the encapsulation of analytes is ruled out here (Fig. S34). The mechanism behind the fluorescence quenching might be due to the photo induced electron transfer between the electron rich framework and electron deficient analyte adsorbed on the surface4a as compound 1 has plenty electron rich components such as highly conjugated carboxylic acid ligands and two different types of long delocalized neutral spacers in the pores (Fig. 1C, Fig. S6). To get more insight into this mechanism, we have calculated the HOMO-LUMO energies of the employed nitroanalytes by DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G* level as shown in the Fig. S35 and from the results it can be anticipated that the observed maximum fluorescence intensity quenching is due to easy electron transfer from framework to the lowest LUMO energy level of PA compared to the other nitroanalytes (Table S3).1a, 9, 10a However, the order of observed quenching efficiency is not in full agreement with the corresponding LUMO energies of other nitroanalytes which indicates that, electron transfer is not the sole mechanism for intensity quenching.9,3b, 10a To investigate this, we have recorded the UV-vis spectrum for all the nitroaromatics (Fig. S36). Among all, only PA shows the maximum spectral overlap with the emission spectrum of compound 1 whereas for other nitroanalytes it is negligible. From the non-linearity in the S-V plot and the spectral overlap of PA with 1 it is quite clear that the resonance energy transfer mechanism along with the electron transfer mechanism is responsible for selective fluorescence quenching with PA whereas for other nitroanalytes the fluorescence quenching is happening only through electron transfer mechanism.1, 10a As we mentioned earlier, the crystal structure of compound 1 possess two different types of bpeb linkers in the pores as well as on the walls and thus it is expected that the alkene (-CH=CH-) moieties in the bpeb linkers could facilitate the selective sensing behavior towards Pd2+ ions. In the typical experiment, the fluorescence spectra of 1 were recorded upon incremental addition of Pd(NO3)2∙xH2O solution in DMF (1 mM). As expected, the gradual addition of Pd2+ solution into 1 resulted in fast and high fluorescence quenching (90%) with the significant spectroscopic variation (Fig. 3a). Compound 1 also displays selective chromogenic behavior towards Pd2+ with a color change from colorless to grey, which was observed by naked eye (Fig. 3b). Specifically, compound 1 could detect Pd2+ even in the concentrations of as low as 0.03 ppm. It is worth mentioning that, the calculated detection limit of 0.03 ppm is much below the permissible limit of 5-10 ppm set by the World Health Organization (WHO) for Pd2+ in drug chemicals and this value fall in the range of reported fluorescence probes for selective Pd2+ sensing via fluorescence quenching mechanism.5,8 Moreover, the stability of framework has been confirmed by the comparative PXRD patterns of 1, before and after soaking in the solution of Pd2+ for 24 h (Fig.S37). The Stern-Volmer plot (Stern-Volmer constant, KSV = 3.6 x 104 M-1) (Details in ESI) obtained from the fluorescence quenching of compound 1 with increasing Pd2+ concentration showed a good linear response in the low concentrations (Fig. 3c). As the concentration increased, the plot deviates from linearity, demonstrating the simultaneous presence of both static and dynamic mechanisms. Once again the fluorescence life time measurement proved that, in the case of Pd2+ also the fluorescence quenching follows static mechanism (Fig. S38). To check selective sensing behavior of 1 towards Pd2+, we performed the fluorescence experiments with other metal ions such as Cr2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Ag2+, Pt2+, Pb2+ and Eu3+ (Fig. S39-47). All these metal ions had no significant effect on the fluorescence intensity under identical experimental conditions which suggests the selective sensing behavior of 1 towards Pd2+ (Fig 3d). To examine the selectivity of Pd2+ Page 3 of 5 ChemComm ChemComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 04 March 2015. Downloaded by Université Laval on 04/03/2015 16:56:03.

Name., 2012, 00, 1-3 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 in the presence of other metal ions we have also performed some competition experiments. When we added different metal ions to compound 1, the fluorescence intensities were not affected much even in high concentrations but an impressive quenching was observed after adding Pd2+ solution which confirms the remarkable selectivity (Fig. S48-S56). The mechanism behind the Pd2+ selectivity was analyzed by emission and absorption spectra. In the emission spectrum of 1 with Pd2+, In addition to the intensity quenching, a slight red shift was observed in the band (~5 nm) upon adding an appropriate quantity of Pd2+ solution that suggests the presence of significant interactions between the framework and Pd2+ (Fig. 3a).16 From the selective chromogenic behavior towards Pd2+ and the significant variation in fluorescence spectrum, we anticipated that, the observed selective sensing behavior of compound 1 for Pd2+ over other metal ions is due to the interaction between the unsaturated alkene moieties (-CH=CH-) of bpeb linkers and Pd2+ as it is a well-known fact that the π-philic metal ions like Pd2+ could co-ordinate with alkenes through the ( →) transitions.17 To get more insight into the interactions between Pd2+ and compound 1, we recorded the UV-vis spectrum by progressively adding Pd2+ solution into a solution 1 (Fig. S57). The addition of Pd2+ solution caused an enhancement in the absorbance of excitation band with a red shift from 340 nm to 362 nm, meanwhile a new peak was appeared at 270 nm confirming the interaction between Pd2+ and alkene moieties of bpeb in compound 1 and also suggesting the possibility of Pd2+ and alkene complex formation.17 In the presence of other metal ions no such change was observed in UV-vis spectral pattern (Fig. S58). For better understanding, the stoichiometry between Pd2+ and compound 1 was verified by Job's method (Fig. S59).7a,8b,5c The plot shows 1:2 stoichiometric complex formation between compound 1 and Pd2+ solution. These spectroscopic results proved that the selective sensing behavior of compound 1 is due to the Palladium-alkene complex formation. In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized a new luminescent MOF that shows highly selective and sensitive detection of PA and Pd2+ even in the concurrent presence of other competing nitroanalytes and metal ions. The mutual existence of energy and electron transfer mechanisms amplified the selectivity towards PA and the presence of unsaturated alkene moieties (-CH=CH-) of bpeb linkers in the framework helped for the selective detection of Pd2+. The Stern-Volmer plot of compound 1 gives the highest quenching constant value among the reported MOFs for selective PA sensing as well as it could detect Pd2+ below the permissible limits set by WHO. The present work demonstrates the potential of a dual sensing fluorescent MOF for practical detection of nitroaromatic explosives as well as hazardous metal ions for environmental and security concerns.

This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015 Fluorescence experiments: In typical experimental setup, 1mg of compound 1 was dispersed in 1 ml of DMF. In a 1 cm quartz cuvette, 3 mL solution of compound 1 in DMF was placed and the fluorescence response upon excitation at 340 nm was measured in-situ after incremental addition of freshly prepared analyte solutions in the range of 350-600 nm, while keeping 2 nm slit width for both source and detector. To maintain homogeneity, solution was stirred at constant rate during experiment. Formula for calculating the percentage of Picric acid fluorescence intensity quenching: (Io-I)/Io x 100% Where, Io = initial fluorescence intensity, I = intensity of 1 containing PA solution.

Stern-Volmer equation: I0/I = KSV[A] + 1 Where, I0 = fluorescent intensity of 1 before the addition of the analyte I = fluorescent intensity after the addition of the respective analyte KSV = Stern-Volmer constant [A] = molar concentration of the analyte (M-1). For Pd2+: Figure S1: Fluorescence quenching of compound 1 by various concentration of Pd2+, in which I0 and I denote the intensity of the fluorescence signal of the sensing material in the absence and presence of the analyte respectively. I0/I = KSV [Pd2+] + 1 (Correlation coefficient, R2 = 0.98587). Calculations for detection limit: Figure S2: Fluorescence intensity as a function of Pd2+ ions concentration (Left), The change in fluorescence intensity of compound 1 upon incremental addition of Pd2+ (1mM) solution in DMF (Right). The detection limit was calculated based on the fluorescence titration. The emission spectrum of compound 1 was recorded by adding aliquots of Pd2+ solution in minimum concentrations and the fluorescence intensity as a function of Pd2+ ions added was then plotted. So the detection limit was calculated with the following equation: (Reference: (a) M. Kumar, N. Kumar and V. Bhalla, RSC Adv., 2013, 3, 1097; (b) G. L. Long and J. D. Winefordner., Anal. Chem., 1983, 55, 712A, (c) B. Gole, A. K. Bar and P. S. Mukherjee., Chem. Eur. J. 2014, 20, 2276; (d) B. Gole, A. K. Bar and P. S. Mukherjee., Chem. Eur. J. 2014, 20, 13321). Detection limit (DL) = Concentration of compound x Equiv. of Titrant at which change observed Thus, DL = 0.0015 x 2.2 x 10-4 = 3.3 x 10-7 mol = 0.03 ppm Note: Although there is one more equation to determine the detection limit (i.e. Limit of Detection (LOD) = 3Sigma/slope), but generally it has been used in the case of “enhancement in fluorescence intensity”( References: (a) Chem. Commun., 2013, 49, 822. (b) RSC Adv., 2014, 4, 16104. (c) Chem. Commun., 2011, 47, 8656). In this case above given equation was used to calculate detection limit as the sensing occurs via fluoresce intensity quenching. X-ray Single-Crystal structure Determination: Single crystal data for compound 1 was collected on a Bruker APEX II diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator and Mo-Kα (λ= 0.71073 Å, 296 K) radiation. Data collection was performed using φ and ω scan. The structure was solved using direct method followed by full matrix least square refinements against F2 (all data HKLF 4 format) using SHELXTL. Subsequent difference Fourier synthesis and least-square refinement revealed the positions of the remaining nonhydrogen atoms. Determinations of the crystal system, orientation matrix, and cell dimensions were performed according to the established procedures. Lorentz polarization and multi-scan absorption correction were applied. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with independent anisotropic displacement parameters and hydrogen atoms were placed geometrically and refined using the riding model. All calculations were carried out using SHELXL 97,2 PLATON 99,3 and WinGXsystemVer-1.64.4 During the final stages of refinement, some Q peaks having high electron densities were found in compound 1 which probably correspond to highly disordered solvent water molecules and are removed by SQUEEZE 4 program. From the TG analysis, we have calculated that in compound 1 two guest water molecules are present and hence those are included in the molecular formula.
