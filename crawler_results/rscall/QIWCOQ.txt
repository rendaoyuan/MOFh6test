Coghlan, Christopher J. Sumby* and Christian J. Doonan* Here we show that connecting two equivalents of a bis-pyrazolymethane ‘hinged’ link by a carbon–carbon bond characteristically ‘extends’ the 2D layered metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) typically formed with such compounds into 3D MOF materials. 1,1,2,2-Tetrakis[4-(4-carboxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]ethane (L) was prepared in three steps and upon reaction with late transition metals, namely copper(II), cadmium(II) and zinc(II), gave 3D MOFs [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF and [M2L]·xDMF (M = Zn, x = 1; M = Cd, x = 1.75). The 3D MOFs display gating behaviour in their adsorption isotherms, consistent with 3rd generation flexible structures. Furthermore, the 3D MOFs showed appreciable affinity for CO2 at 293 K however, due to the larger pore sizes, molecular sieving of CO2/N2 was not observed. Reaction of L with cobalt(II) gave a 3D hydrogen- bonded network incorporating 1D coordination polymer chains that is topologically equivalent to the Zn and Cd MOFs. The strategy outlined here demonstrates a novel route for designing more chemically and thermally robust 3D MOFs from 2D layered materials. Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are solid-state materials in which organic links of differing structure metrics and metal clusters are organized into extended networks with perma- nent porosity.1–3 Structural flexibility in some MOFs – 3rd generation behaviour – provides additional properties arising from their dynamic structures that are not accessible to rigid materials.3–7 The ability to systematically vary the structural design of these materials has led to applications for MOFs that extend to gas storage and separation,8–10 drug delivery,11 heterogeneous catalysis,12 and microelectronics.13 Introducing structural flexibility into a MOF can be achieved by utilising non-rigid organic linkers,14,15 through judicious choice of metal nodes7,16 or by the exploitation of non-covalent interactions in 2D layered and interpenetrated frameworks.17–19 Recently, we introduced a strategy to reliably form flexible MOFs by designing a family of flexible organic links that possess a central chelating site.20–22 Coordination of this central site modulates the flexibility of the organic link and gives rise to materials that routinely show 3rd generation behaviour. For example, a flexible silver(I) 3D material was formed using di-2-pyrazinylmethane (dpzm) as the organic building block; the material underwent solvent-induced expan- sion and contraction (breathing) upon exposure to different solvents.20 Related ligands have also been studied by Du et al. as analogues of 4,4′-bipyridine.23,24 Extension of our work to an anionic link (Fig. 1a, bcppm) gave a more chemically and thermally stable Cu(II) MOF, [Cu(bcppm)(H2O)] with out- standing CO2/N2 separation properties.22 Of particular note was that this MOF underwent a structural transformation from a 2D flexible material to a 3D framework upon activation, with the 3D material having a rigid structure with pores capable of molecular sieving type separations. 2D layered MOFs (Fig. 1c) often show phenomena such as layer–layer sliding and structure collapse on desolvation which has somewhat limited their use as porous materials.3,4,25 To overcome such issues, a second organic building unit or ‘pillaring link’ is commonly used to construct 3D perma- nently porous materials3,4,26 (Fig. 1d). We speculated that close inspection of 2D layered structures could provide insight into how such pillars could, in selected cases, be incorporated into the molecular architecture of the organic links. This approach can provide an efficient (one organic building unit) route to topologically related 3D materials. Motivated by the desirable properties of [Cu(bcppm)(H2O)],22 here we demonstrate a strategy to covalently connect 2D MOFs by ligand design; i.e. synthetically installing a carbon–carbon connection between the ‘hinges’ of two equivalents of our 6364 | CrystEngComm, 2014, 16, 6364–6371 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 Centre for Advanced Nanomaterials, School of Chemistry & Physics, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.

This required us to design a new ‘hinged’ link (Fig. 1b, L) that would facilitate covalent connection of 2D materials. Here, we report a series of 3D MOFs constructed from the new ‘hinged’ link, 1,1,2,2-tetrakis[4-(4-carboxyphenyl)-1H- pyrazol-1-yl]ethane (L). Reactions of L with cadmium(II), copper(II) and zinc(II) gave materials topologically related to [Cu(bcppm)(H2O)] but where a 3D framework was formed by the linking of 2D layers through C–C covalent bonding. In addi- tion, reaction of L with cobalt(II) resulted in the formation of a topologically equivalent 3D hydrogen-bonded network. Herein, the structures, data on the chemical and thermal stability, and gas adsorption properties of all materials are reported. Experimental Materials and methods All reagents, starting materials and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Boron Molecular and were used as received. 1,1,2,2-Tetrakis(4-iodo-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethane was prepared according to literature methods.27 The Campbell microanalytical laboratory at the University of Otago, Dunedin performed all elemental analyses, Samples were activated before submission with adventitious water being observed in the analyses. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini 600 spectrometer at 23 °C using a 5 mm probe. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer on a zinc–selenide crystal. Pore size calculations where done using Zeo++.28 The analysis was conducted with the solvent removed and 2 × 2 × 2 super-cells of the crystal structures were used.

X-ray crystallography Single crystals were mounted in paratone-N oil on a plastic loop. X-ray diffraction data were collected at low temperature with MoKα radiation (λ = 0.7107 Å) using an Oxford Diffraction X-calibur single-crystal X-ray diffractometer ([Cu2(L)(H2O)2]·1.4DMF, [Cd2(L)]·1.75DMF and [Co2(L)(H2O)6]·DMF) or on the MX1 beamline of the Australian Synchrotron (λ = 0.7107 Å, [Zn2(L)]·DMF). Data sets were corrected for absorption using multi-scan methods, and structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-9729 and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 by SHELXL-97,30 interfaced through the program X-Seed.31 In general, all non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically and hydrogen atoms were included as invariants at geometri- cally estimated positions, unless specified otherwise in addi- tional details below.

Results and discussion Ligand and MOF synthesis The organic linker 1,1,2,2-tetrakis[4-(4-carboxyphenyl)-1H- pyrazol-1-yl]ethane (L) was readily synthesised from 1,1,2,2- tetrakis(4-iodo-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethane27 and 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid via a Suzuki coupling in 79% yield. Compound L main- tains the design features present in bcppm,22 namely flexi- bility derived from the methylene hinge, anionic O-donors and a bidentate chelating site. In contrast, L contains a C–C bond between the two dipyrazole moieties (see ESI,† Chart S1, for an illustration of the coordination modes encountered in this work). Using the 2D layered structure of [Cu(bcppm)(H2O)] as a blueprint, we posited that this substitution of the solvent ‘pillar’ with a C–C bond would afford a topologically related robust 3D network. Solvothermal reactions of L with Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and CdCl2·2.5H2O in mix- tures of DMF/H2O and AcOH (or HNO3) to improve crystal growth gave X-ray quality crystals of [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF, [Zn2(L)]·DMF, [Co2(L)(H2O)6]·DMF and [Cd2(L)]·1.75DMF after 24 hours (Table 1).7 IR spectroscopy revealed that the band for the CO stretch of the ligand was shifted from 1686 cm−1 for the free ligand to shorter wavenumbers (1665–1670 cm−1) in the MOFs and 1630 cm−1 in the hydrogen-bonded network [Co2(L)(H2O)6] providing an excellent handle on the nature of bonding in the four materials. Crystal structures As anticipated, incorporating a C–C bond to link together two bis-pyrazolymethane ‘hinged’ moieties led to the forma- tion of a 3D MOF material, [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF. Like [Cu(bcppm)(H2O)],22 [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF has a square pyramidal Cu(II) centre which is coordinated by a dipyrazole chelating unit from a molecule of L (Cu–N bond length of 1.987(6) Å), two symmetry-related monodentate carboxylate oxygen donors from two further molecules of L (Cu–O bond length of 1.970(5) Å) and a single water ligand with a bond length of 2.312(12) Å (Fig. 2a). Without the C–C connection from the ligand the material has a 2D 4-connected structure (akin to [Cu(bcppm)(H2O)] when one treats each [Cu(bcppm)] moiety as a 4-connecting centre). However, the presence of a C–C bond in L has several important structural ramifications, including the obvious extension of the material to a 3D struc- ture (Fig. 2b and c) as proposed (Fig. 1e). Unlike the previously reported material (Fig. 1c), the carbonyl oxygen atoms are not hydrogen bonded to the water molecule on an adjacent metal atom; instead they form weaker C–H⋯O bonds with the CH of the ethane link in L. [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF possesses diamond-shaped channels aligned coincident with the a-axis of the unit cell (Fig. 2b). These measure ~13.9 by 20.2 Å between Cu centres, with a Fig. 2 (a) The coordination environment around the Cu centre in [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF.

The ‘layer’ separations are dictated by the C–C bonds of L resulting in a Cu–Cu separation of either ~6.0 or 6.6 Å (the former between Cu centres where the water ligands of both Cu centres are hydrogen bonded and the latter between Cu centres bridged by a molecule of L, Fig. 2d). These moieties alternate at the apices of each diamond-shaped channel in the a-axis direction. In a more formal topological treatment, viewing the Cu centres as 3-connecting nodes and the ligand as a 6-connecting node (it coordinates two Cu centres with the dipyrazole donors and four Cu centres with monodentate carboxylate donors) gives a binodal 3,6-connected net with a commonly encountered rutile-type topology. However, the MOF is perhaps better considered as a partially linked 2D layered material.35 The Zn analogue forms a closely related 3D MOF, with the major distinction between the [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF and [Zn2(L)]·DMF structures being the replacement of the apical water ligand by a carboxylate oxygen from an adjacent layer. This zinc(II) dimer secondary building unit (SBU), which pro- vides another layer–layer connection, dramatically distorts the 2D ‘layers’ and provides a closer metal–metal distance (~3.8 Å) for the bridged zinc(II) centres (vs. 6.0 Å in [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF). The zinc(II) centre adopts a distorted square pyra- midal geometry and is coordinated by a dipyrazole unit from a molecule of L, a monodentate carboxylate and two bridging carboxylate oxygen donors (Fig. 3a). To provide this bridging motif one of the carboxylate ligands is twisted away from the type of C–H⋯O hydrogen bonding interaction present in [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF. In terms of the pore structure, a very similar packing to that present in [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF gives rise to diamond-shaped channels directed along the b-axis with a pore diameter of ~6.6 Å (Zn–Zn separations of 13.5 and 18.9 Å, Fig. 3c; side view 3d). Topologically however the presence of an additional layer-to-layer contact in the form of the zinc SBU means that, along with the C–C bond of L, the MOF contains two topologically equivalent 6-connecting nodes and hence a binodal 6-connected net (Fig. 3e). This additional layer–layer connection provides a 3D MOF with a structure more akin to the pillared 3D MOFs (Fig. 1d) rather than the simple, covalently linked structure (Fig. 1e). [Cd2(L)]·1.75DMF is also a 3D MOF and is isomorphous but not strictly isostructural with [Zn2(L)]·DMF. In a similar manner to [Zn2(L)]·DMF, the cadmium(II) centres form a dimer which are bridged by two μ2-carboxylate oxygen atoms from the carboxylic acid moieties of L. However, the cadmium(II) centres are 7-coordinate and are coordinated by two pyrazole nitrogen atoms, two chelating carboxylic acids and a monodentate carboxylate (that chelates a second Cd centre, Fig. 3b). A very similar packing to that present in [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF and [Zn2(L)]·DMF gives rise to diamond-shaped channels directed along the b-axis with a pore diameter of ~6.4 Å (Cd–Cd separations of 13.7 and 19.4 Å about the channel). [Zn2(L)]·DMF and [Cd2(L)]·1.75DMF are topologically identical (Fig. 3e). [Co2(L)(H2O)6]·DMF has a very similar overall 3D structure in terms of topology to both the zinc(II) and cadmium(II) materials but, due to additional coordination of the Co(II) centres by water ligands, only possesses a 1D coordination Fig. 3 The coordination environments around (a) the Zn(II) dimers and (b) the Cd(II) dimers in the 3D MOFs (hydrogen atoms omitted).

The cobalt centre (Fig. 4a) is coordinated by a dipyrazole unit from a molecule of L (Co–N 2.126(3) Å) and four water ligands; two in the axial positions (Co–O 2.063(4) and 2.077(4) Å) and two μ2-aquo ligands that bridge to a second Co centre (Co–O 2.125(2) Å). The dimeric Co(II) moiety is coordi- nated by two different molecules of L which give rise to a 1D coordination polymer that extends along the a-axis of the unit cell (Fig. 4b). Each of the carboxylates that radiate out from these 1D chains form two strong hydrogen bonds (O–H⋯O; D = 2.50, 2.64 Å, d = 1.63, 1.78 Å, angle = 156.2, 164.5°) with the water ligands of an adjacent 1D coordination polymer to form a 3D hydrogen bonded network. The hydrogen bonded network of [Co2(L)(H2O)6]·DMF possesses diamond-shaped channels, much like the Cu, Zn and Cd MOFs, aligned coincident with the a-axis of the unit cell (Fig. 4c). Due to the hydrogen bonding these are larger than the equivalent channels in the 3D MOFs and measure ~15.2 by 22.7 Å between Co centres and the largest maximum pore diameter for this series of materials of 8.5 Å. Despite possessing quite different 3D connectivity (hydro- gen bonding vs. covalent bonds), all of the structures showed good thermal stability of over 400 °C (275 °C for [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF) as shown by their respective thermogravimetric analy- sis traces (see ESI,† Fig. S1). PXRD (see ESI,† Fig. S2–5) indi- cated that the four materials remained crystalline following activation although, as is known for 3rd generation materials, the materials underwent structural changes that occur upon guest removal, likely to be a trellis-like expansion/contraction process akin to that seen in related materials.22 This observa- tion is supported by pore size distributions and gating in the 77 K N2 and 195 K CO2 adsorption isotherms discussed below. Given that the carbon–carbon connection from the ligand in these 3D MOF materials was expected to yield more chemically robust frameworks, we sought to investigate their stability towards moisture. Previously activated samples of the Zn(II) MOF were stirred in H2O at room temperature, 50 °C and 85 °C for 24 hours. PXRD of the samples reactivated from MeOH showed minimal loss of crystallinity (Fig. 5). Gas absorption and structural flexibility All four activated materials ([Cu2(L)(H2O)2], [Zn2(L)], [Co2(L)(H2O)6] and [Cd2(L)]) were shown to be porous to both N2 and CO2 at several temperatures. From the 77 K N2 isotherms BET surface areas and pore size distributions were calculated (Table 2). Despite having similar structures, subtle differ- ences in the layer–layer separations and chemistry around the metal centres may account for the differences observed.

[Co2(L)(H2O)6] lacks the larger pore size observed for the three 3D MOFs which presumably arises from more pronounced contraction (flattening) of the diamond-shaped windows due to greater flexibility within the hydrogen-bonded 3D structure. Fig. 6 shows that gating behaviour is present in the 195 K CO2 isotherms for the three MOFs, [Cu2(L)(H2O)2], [Zn2(L)] and [Cd2(L)]. This reveals that the materials retain structural flexibility upon activation and do not form a rigid structure as observed for [Cu(bcppm)(H2O)] upon heating,22 i.e. the materials retain 3rd generation behavior.3–5 Based on previ- ous studies,20–22 it is likely that the gating originates from a trellis-like structural change, i.e. expansion in one axis across the diamond-shaped pores and contraction across the other. In contrast, the cobalt(II) material remains in a ‘locked’ form and does not display the features of gating in its 77 K N2 isotherm. Previously we showed exceptional CO2/N2 separation for a closely related MOF material, [Cu(bcppm)(H2O)]. This material had diamond-shaped channels with pore dimensions of ca. 3.6 Å in the activated form that remain locked upon gas adsorption.22 To put this result into context, we investigated the CO2 and N2 adsorption of the four materials reported here at room temperature (see ESI† Fig. S6). The three 3D MOFs showed appreciable CO2 uptake at low pressure with [Zn2(L)] showing the highest uptake amongst the MOF materials (57.5 cm3 g−1). [Co2(L)(H2O)6] displayed little affinity for CO2, but had the highest overall uptake of CO2 (57.5 cm3 g−1). The considerably larger pore dimensions (Table 2) of the materials reported here compared with [Cu(bcppm)(H2O)] results in a greater absorption capacity but a lower selectivity for CO2 over N2 due to the unrestricted pore dimensions of these materials.22,36,37 However, due to the considerably larger experimental surface areas and pore sizes, all mate- rials absorb considerably more CO2 than [Cu(bcppm)(H2O)]. Conclusions Herein, we have reported four new materials which extends our previous work utilising ‘hinged’ organic building blocks to synthesise flexible MOFs. A new organic building block, 1,1,2,2-tetrakis[4-(4-carboxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]ethane, was synthesised in high yield with the intention of covalently linking the types of 2-D layers present in the predecessor MOF, [Cu(bcppm)(H2O)], while still maintaining a degree of structural flexibility. All the four materials showed high thermal stability and the three MOFs retained structural flexibility upon activation validating our aim of covalently linking layers to achieve more robust 3D MOFs. Reaction of L with cobalt(II) gave [Co2(L)(H2O)6]·DMF, a 1-D polymer linked together into a 3-D network through hydrogen bonding. This particular material did not show any gating behaviour in its adsorption isotherms or any particular affinity for CO2 at 293 K despite possessing the highest overall uptake. Copper(II), zinc(II) and cadmium(II) salts all formed flexible 3D MOFs, [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF, [Zn2(L)]·DMF and [Cd2(L)]·1.75DMF, which displayed gating in their 77 K N2 and 195 K CO2 isotherms consistent with 3rd generation structures. Furthermore, all 3D MOFs displayed a larger pore dimension consistent with the diamond-shaped channels which are a characteristic of this family of materials. At 293 K these MOFs showed good low pressure affinity for CO2 and a reasonable overall uptake.
