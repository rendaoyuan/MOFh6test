Commun., 2013, 49, 2338 Anion-induced changes of structure interpenetration and magnetic properties in 3D Dy–Cu metal–organic frameworks† Peng-Fei Shi, Gang Xiong, Bin Zhao,* Zhan-Yun Zhang and Peng Cheng* Two novel Dy–Cu MOFs were structurally and magnetically characterized. The results reveal that it is the first example of anion-induced change of structure interpenetration and magnetic properties in 3d–4f MOFs. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with interpenetration structures have become more and more attractive because of their fascinating structures and special applications,1 and many spectacular inter- penetrating topologies were observed.2 The explorations revealed that the structure interpenetrations can be tuned by changing synthetic factors, including the volume of the solvent,3 temperature or concentration,4 organic ligands or by introducing the second ligands,5 liquid-phase epitaxy,6 and anions in salts.7 It should be noted that, for lanthanide-based MOFs, the anion-induced structural transformations from interpenetration to non-interpenetration have never been reported hitherto, although a similar phenomenon occurred in several transition metal-based MOFs.7 On the other hand, single molecule magnets (SMMs) are of great interest due to their potential benefits of high-density data storage, classical and quantum computation,8 and countless fruits associated with SMMs have been seen in compounds based on Dy(III) or Dy–M (M = Fe, Mn, Cu, Co) clusters on account of the large magnetic anisotropy of Dy3+.9,10 More recently, 1D chains or 2D/3D MOFs containing Dy(III) associated with SMMs have also been developed.11 As is well known, the energy barriers of lantha- nide based SMMs mainly depend on the symmetry and strength of the ligand field around lanthanide ions, because the shielded inner 4f electrons only give rise to very weak magnetic coupling between adjacent metal ions.9b,12 High symmetric coordination environments usually provide positive contribution to the energy barriers, such as C4 in the square antiprism9a and C3 in the trigonal prism.13 Thus, design and modulation of coordination geometries of lanthanide ions are crucial to directly tune the energy barriers of the corresponding SMMs. Up to now, some strategies were adopted in tuning energy barriers by changing solvent molecules14 and functional groups of organic ligands.15 Nevertheless, the investigations of the anion-induced change of energy barriers in lanthanide-based SMMs are extremely rare.8b In this contribution, two 3D Dy–Cu MOFs {[DyCu(BPDC)2- (H2O)2Cl]1.75H2O} (1) and {[Dy2Cu(BPDC)3(H2O)4](NO3)212H2O} (2) (BPDC = 4,40-dicarboxylate-2, 20-dipyridine anion) were obtained under identical synthetic conditions except for diﬀerent anions (ESI†). The structures are from two-fold interpenetration in compound 1 to non-interpenetration in compound 2 (Fig. 1). Magnetic studies demonstrate that the energy barrier is 42.4 K for 1 and 95.3 K for 2, which is the first example of anion- induced structural and magnetic changes in 3d–4f MOFs. Single crystal X-ray diﬀraction analyses revealed that compounds 1 and 2 are 3D frameworks. Compound 1 is a two-fold inter- penetration framework, crystallizing in the monoclinic system with space group C2/c. Each asymmetric unit contains one Dy3+, one Cu2+, two BPDC anions, one coordinated Cl, two coordi- nated water molecules and one and three quarters free water Fig. 1 The synthetic strategy of 1 and 2, two-fold interpenetration topology of 1, and NaCl-like topology of 2.

Commun., 2013, 49, 2338--2340 2339 molecules (Fig. S1, ESI†). Dy3+ is eight-coordinated with a distorted dicapped trigonal prism geometry (Fig. S2a, ESI†), consisting of four bidentate-chelating carboxylic oxygen atoms, two monodentate-bridging carboxylic oxygen atoms and two water molecules. Each Dy3+ is isolated and the distance between the nearest two Dy3+ is 6.0907(6) Å. The five-coordinated environ- ment of Cu2+ is completed by four nitrogen atoms from two BPDC anions and one Cl, which displays a square pyramid geometry (Fig. S2b, ESI†). The closest distance of Dy3+  Cu2+ and Cu2+  Cu2+ is 7.0785(11) Å and 7.2059(11) Å. BPDC anions connect the Dy3+ and Cu2+ into a 3D framework with a 1D channel along the b direction (Fig. S3a, ESI†). Presumably, the large porosity may not be stable, and two sets of independent 3D structures interpenetrate each other, as shown in Fig. S3b (ESI†). Dy3+ and [Cu(BPDC)2Cl]3 are considered as nodes, respectively, and the framework can be simplified as a 4,4-connected neb type topology (Fig. 1). Indeed, interpenetrating MOF is not uncommon in the records, but occurrence in 3d–4f MOFs is very scarce.16 Compound 2 is a cationic framework, which also crystallizes in the monoclinic system with space group C2/c. Dy3+ is nine-coordinated with a distorted tricapped trigonal prism geometry (Fig. S4 and S5a, ESI†), which is completed by seven carboxylic oxygen atoms and two water molecules. Two adjacent Dy3+ are bridged into a binuclear [Dy2] unit by both carboxylic oxygen atoms and carboxyl groups. The distance of Dy  Dy is 4.0681(12) Å in a [Dy2] unit. The six-coordinated environment of Cu2+ is completed by six nitrogen atoms from three BPDC anions (Fig. S5b, ESI†), forming a [Cu(BPDC)3] unit, which connects [Dy2] units into a 3D cationic framework. Noteworthily, a Cu atom lies on a two-fold axis and one of the BPDC ligands lies about the same two-fold axis. The nearest distance of Dy3+Cu2+ and Cu2+Cu2+ is 8.3601(30) Å and 10.2347(25) Å, respectively. IR and element analysis (EA) indicate that the counter anion is NO3  (Fig. S6, ESI†). [Dy2] and [Cu(BPDC)3] units are considered as nodes, respectively, and the cationic framework can be simplified to a 6,6-connected NaCl-like topological structure (Fig. 1). Powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) measurements support the stability in air and the purity of samples 1 and 2 (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of 1 and 2 display excellent thermal stability of the two compounds (Fig. S9, ESI†). Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements of 1 and 2 present the value of wMT to be 14.40 cm3 K mol1 and 28.50 cm3 K mol1 at room temperature, respectively, which is close to the theoretical value of 14.54 cm3 K mol1 and 28.71 cm3 K mol1 for one isolated Dy3+ (6H15/2, g = 4/3) and one isolated Cu2+ in 1 and two isolated Dy3+ and one isolated Cu2+ in 2. For 1, the wMT value decrease slowly from 300 to 130 K and then decrease sharply to 2 K with a minimum value of 6.22 cm3 K mol1, as shown in Fig. 2. This magnetic behavior of 1 may be ascribed to thermal depopulation of Dy3+ excited Stark sub-levels and/or weak antiferromagnetic interaction.9b For 2, the wMT value is almost constant in the range of 300–100 K (Fig. 2), which maybe the result of the competition balance between weak ferromagnetic interaction and thermal depopulation of the Dy3+ excited Stark sub-levels. Below 100 K, the depopulation of Dy3+ excited Stark sub-levels dominates, causing the wMT value to sharply decrease to a minimum value of 24.22 cm3 K mol1 at 4 K. Further cooling temperature, the wMT value increases to 24.90 cm3 K mol1 at 2 K, implying that the ferromagnetic interaction between adjacent Dy ions in [Dy2] units dominates. Dy3+ in a very low-temperature region can be approximately considered as an ion with an eﬀective spin S = 1/2 and a large anisotropic g tensor, and thus the magnetic data of compounds 1 and 2 can be tentatively fitted using the equation: wMT = (Ng2b2/3k)/[1 + exp(J/2kT)] (ref. 17) (ESI,† Fig. S10). The results yield J = 0.25 cm1, g = 20.02 for 1 and J = 0.58 cm1, g = 19.98 for 2. The smaller exchange energy (J) in 1 than that in 2 may originate from the long distance (6.0907(6) Å) between adjacent Dy3+ in 1. The diﬀerent symmetry of coordination geometry around Dy3+ and the distance between adjacent Dy3+ in 1 and 2 should be responsible for their diﬀerent magnetic behavior at low temperature. The plots of M versus H/T for 1 and 2 did not superimpose at diﬀerent temperatures and without any sign of saturation, suggesting the existence of magnetic anisotropy and/or low-lying excited states.9b For exploring the dynamics of the magnetisation, the tempera- ture and frequency dependences of the ac-susceptibility were obtained under a zero-dc field. Both of the out-of-phase signals ðw00 MÞ of 1 and 2 in alternating current (AC) susceptibility measure- ments display strong frequency dependence (Fig. S11–S16, ESI†), but the peaks for them were not observed, which mainly originates from the quantum tunneling eﬀect (QTE).18 Theoretically, a given direct-current field can eﬀectively restrain the QTE, therefore, a 2000 Oe dc field was employed for 1 and 2 in temperature dependence AC measurement. The peaks can be observed obviously both in w0 M and w00 M curves for 1 (Fig. 3 and Fig. S17, ESI†), but no clear peaks appeared in the w00 M curve of 2 (Fig. S18, ESI†), which demonstrates the stronger quantum tunnel in 2 than in 1. Therefore, a large dc field of 5000 Oe was adopted in 2, resulting in clear peaks in w0 M and w00 M curves (Fig. 4 and Fig. S19, ESI†). To obtain the relaxation energy barrier and pre-exponential factor, the peak temperature Tp can be obtained by the Lor- entzian peak function fitting from the plot of w00 M  T, and the best fitting based on the Arrhenius law 1/Tp = kB/DE[ln(2pf) + ln(t0)] (f is the frequency) yields the energy barrier DE/kB = 42.4 K and the pre-exponential factor t0 = 3.43  109 s for 1, and DE/kB = 95.3 K and t0 = 0.94  1012 s for 2, which fall into the normal range of the reported Dy compounds.8b,19 The Tp- shift of the w00 is measured by the parameter j = (DTp/Tp)/ D(log f) = 0.22 for 1 and 0.15 for 2, which is consistent with that of a superparamagnet, suggesting that the magnetic behavior of 1 and 2 could not originate from the spin glass.20 Fig. 2 The wMT vs. T plots of compounds 1 (left) and 2 (right) under 1000 Oe; inset: M vs. H plots at various temperatures.

Commun., 2013, 49, 2338--2340 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 The Cole–Cole plots of compounds 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. S20 and S21 (ESI†). For 1, it shows an asymmetric shape, and the best fits of the out-of-phase vs. in-phase susceptibility in the range of 2–3 K were obtained with a = 0.22–0.23 using the generalized Debye model (a = 0 corresponding to an infinitely narrow distribution of relaxation times).21 However for 2, it cannot be fitted using the Debye model due to the significant deviation from a semi-circle Cole–Cole plot. The diﬀerent anions employed in preparing 1 and 2 should be responsible for the large divergences of both structure and magnetic properties between them since other synthetic conditions are identical. In 1, Cl coordinates to the Cu center, and only two BPDC anions coordinate to one Cu2+, which indirectly aﬀects the coordinated environment of Dy3+ with a low symmetric dicapped trigonal prism geometry. Similarly, in 2, no NO3  coordinates with Cu2+, and three BPCD anions coordinate to one Cu2+, which causes nine-coordinated Dy3+ with a high symmetry of the C3 axis. The higher symmetry in compound 2 than in 1 provides positive contribution to the energy barrier, giving rise to the energy barrier change from 42.4 to 95.3 K. The diﬀerent coordination abilities and sizes of Cl and NO3  also well tuned the structure of 1 and 2 from interpenetration to non-interpenetration. In summary, the anions played crucial roles in tuning the structure and magnetic properties of 1 and 2, and anion- induced changes of both structure interpenetration and the magnetic properties in 3d–4f heterometallic MOFs has been reported for the first time.

Fax: (+86)-22-23502458 E-mail: zhaobin@nankai.edu.cn Materials and General Characterizations All of the chemicals are analytically grade and purchased without further purification. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were obtained at the Institute of Elemental Organic Chemistry, Nankai University. The FT-IR spectrum was measured with a Bruker Tensor 27 Spectrophoto meter on KBr disks. TGA experiments were performed on a NETZSCH TG 209 instrument with a heating rate of 10 ℃ min-1. Powder X-ray Diffraction measurements were recorded on a D/Max-2500 X-ray Diffractometer using Cu-K radiation. The magnetic properties were measured on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 and a PPMS-9 ACMS magnetometer. Diamagnetic correction was made with Pascal’s constants for all the constituent atoms. Synthesis of 1 and 2 Compound 1: A mixture of H2BPDC (0.0488 g, 0.15 mmol), CuCl2·6H2O (0.0123 g, 0.05 mmol), DyCl3·6H2O (0.0377 g, 0.1 mmol), 4 mL distilled water and 4 mL anhydrous alcohol were sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless vessel (25 mL) and heated at 145℃ for 72 h under autogenous pressure. The vessel was then cooled slowly down to room temperature at 1.2 ℃/ h. Blue block crystals were obtained. The yield was 62% (based on DyCl3 .6H2O). Elemental Anal.

Crystallographic Studies Crystallographic data of 1 and 2 were collected on a SuperNova single crystal diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromatic MoK radiation ( = 0.71073 Å). The data integration and empirical absorption corrections were carried out by SAINT programs. The structures were solved by direct methods. All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically on F2 by full-matrix least-squares techniques. All hydrogen atoms except for those of the uncoordinated water molecules in these coordination polymers were generated geometrically and refined isotropically using the riding model. Additionally, due to low residual electron density, the positions of NO3 - and H2O in compound 2 cannot be determined accurately by single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques, and therefore the SQUEEZE routine in the PLATON software package was applied. This method was widely applied in the previous articles (For example: Science 2010, 329, 1053). For compound 2, the squeezed electron number is 739 for four units, which is consistent with two NO3 - and twelve free H2O [4*(2*32+12*10) = 736]. Simultaneously, the elemental analyses of C, H, and N are close to that of calculated according to the molecular formula mentioned above.

To study the thermal stability of the two compounds and further affirm the molecular formula of the compound 2, thermogravimetric analyses of 1 and 2 were detected in the range of 25-800 ℃, as shown in Fig. S7. The TGA curve of 1 exhibits three regions of weight loss. The first weight loss between 25 and 125℃ is 3.54%, and it corresponds to the loss of one and three quarters water molecules, being identical with the calculated 3.87%. The second weight loss between 125 and 310 ℃ is 4.78%, and it corresponds to the loss of two coordinated water molecules, being identical with the calculated 4.42%. The third weight loss above 310 ℃ stems from the decomposition of the 3D framework in 1. For compound 2, the first weight loss from the room temperature to 300 ℃ is 18.36%, and it corresponds to four coordinated and twelve free water molecules, which is well consistent with the calculated value 18.88%. Upon increasing the temperature, the framework commences to collapse. Fig. S7 PXRD patterns of compound 1 and the simulated one of 1.

Fig. S9 TGA cures of compounds 1 and 2. For most of lanthanide ions, due to the large orbital-angular momentum, strong spin-orbital coupling, and very weak magnetic interaction between adjacent lanthanide ions originated from the nature of inner 4f electrons, it is rather difficult to fit the magnetic data of the compounds containing Ln3+ based on accurate theoretical equation. However, for Dy2 dimer system, Dy3+ in a very low-temperature region can be approximately considered as an ion with an effective spin S = 1/2 and large anisotropic g tensor, and thus the χMT vs T plots can be fitted by the mathematical equation: (Ng2β2/3k) [1+exp(-J/2kT)]-1 (Chem. Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 7 Eur. J. 2011, 17, 10397-10404). For compound 2, the χMT vs T plots were fitted by the dimer Ising model χMT = (Ng2β2/3k) [1+exp(-J/2kT)]-1+ 0.375 (0.375 = (Ng2β2/3k)*S(S+1), which is the contribution of one isolated Cu2+) in the temperature range between 4 and 11 K with the results of J = −0.58 cm−1 and g = 19.98 (Fig. S10), but the data between 2 and 4 K can not be fitted. Compared with compound 2, compound 1 possesses a longer distance of Dy3+…Dy3+ with 6.0907(6) Å. Thus, the magnetic data was dealt with by magnetic unit including two Dy3+ and two Cu2+, and the χMT vs T plots were also tried to be fitted by the dimer Ising model above χMT = (Ng2β2/3k) [1+exp(-J/2kT)]-1+ 0.75 (0.75 is the contribution of two isolated Cu2+) in the low temperature range between 2 and 8 K, yielding J = −0.25 cm−1 and g = 20.02 (Fig. S10). The g value in 1 and 2 falls into a normal range, and the smaller exchange energy (J) in 1 than that in 2 may originate from the long distance (6.09 Å) between adjacent Dy3+ in 1. Fig. S10 Temperature dependence of χMT in the range of 2−10 K for compound 1 (▲) and 2 (), and the best fit using the dimer Ising model: 2−8 K for compound 1 (red line), 4-10 K for compound 2 (green line).
