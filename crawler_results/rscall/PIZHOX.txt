Mobin,a Luísa M. D. R. S. Martins,*b,c Armando J. L. Pombeiro,*c Alexander M. Kirillovc and Suman Mukhopadhyay*a Two new metal–organic compounds {[Cu3(µ3-4-ptz)4(µ2-N3)2(DMF)2](DMF)2}n (1) and {[Cu(4- ptz)2(H2O)2]}n (2) {4-ptz = 5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazolate} with 3D and 2D coordination networks, respectively, have been synthesized while studying the eﬀect of reaction conditions on the coordination modes of 4-pytz by employing the [2 + 3] cycloaddition as a tool for generating in situ the 5-substituted tetrazole ligands from 4-pyridinecarbonitrile and NaN3 in the presence of a copper(II) salt. The obtained com- pounds have been structurally characterized and the topological analysis of 1 discloses a topologically unique trinodal 3,5,6-connected 3D network which, upon further simpliﬁcation, results in a uninodal 8-connected underlying net with the bcu (body centred cubic) topology driven by the [Cu3(µ2-N3)2] cluster nodes and µ3-4-ptz linkers. In contrast, the 2D metal–organic network in 2 has been classiﬁed as a uninodal 4-connected underlying net with the sql [Shubnikov tetragonal plane net] topology assembled from the Cu nodes and µ2-4-ptz linkers. The catalytic investigations disclosed that 1 and 2 act as active catalyst precursors towards the microwave-assisted homogeneous oxidation of secondary alcohols (1-phenylethanol, cyclohexanol, 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol, 2-octanol and 3-octanol) with tert-butylhydro- peroxide, leading to the yields of the corresponding ketones up to 86% (TOF = 430 h−1) and 58% (TOF = 290 h−1) in the oxidation of 1-phenylethanol and cyclohexanol, respectively, after 1 h under low power (10 W) microwave irradiation, and in the absence of any added solvent or additive. Introduction Tetrazole ligands have been extensively used to generate metal–organic and H-bonded frameworks of diﬀerent topolo- gies in the last few years.1 The versatility of the tetrazole build- ing blocks provides the required template to create a hoard of new materials with interesting properties and diverse applica- tions.1g,h Among the various tetrazole ligands, 5-(4-pyridyl)- tetrazole (4-ptz) has been one of the widely employed building blocks towards the design of metal–organic networks.2 In par- ticular, a combination of 4-ptz with a copper ion has produced a handful of MOFs obtained either in the presence or absence of co-ligands.3 However, in most of the reported cases, 4-ptz has been generated under solvothermal conditions by cyclo- addition of 4-cyanopyridine and an azide ion in the presence of diﬀerent transition metals. In contrast, the synthesis of MOFs driven by the 4-ptz blocks in a more controlled manner (i.e., at lower temperatures and pressures via a similar cyclo- addition path) has not been reported so far though there are reports of formation of tetrazoles under milder conditions in the presence of metal ions or other catalysts.4 From the other side, the synthesis of new MOFs and their application in oxidative catalysis represent an interesting research direction.5,6 In the present study, we have selected the oxidation of secondary alcohols as a model reaction,7 aiming at probing catalytic potential of the compounds 1 and 2. Clas- sical methods for the liquid-phase oxidation of alcohols to ketones are unfeasible on an industrial-scale and undesirable from the environmental viewpoint due to the common use of chlorinated solvents, toxic8a–c or moisture-sensitive oxidants,8d †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

The improvement of these synthetic methodologies, according to green chemistry principles,8q,r is a challenge to be tackled, focusing on the use of alternative green solvent systems for more eﬃcient and clean syntheses.8s Herein we report the synthesis and structural features of two copper metal–organic frameworks which have been gen- erated by the cycloaddition reaction between sodium azide and 4-cyanopyridine in the presence of a copper(II) salt. Further- more, the present work discloses the catalytic properties of these two compounds toward the oxidation of secondary alco- hols under rather mild and green conditions. Experimental section Materials and instrumentation Reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. Microwave irradiation exper- iments for the synthesis of 2 and for the catalytic tests under MW irradiation were performed in a focused microwave CEM discover reactor (300 W for the synthesis or 10 W for the cataly- sis), using a 10 mL capacity reaction tube with a 13 mm internal diameter, fitted with a rotational system and an IR temperature detector. Infrared spectra (4000–500 cm−1) were recorded with a Bio-Rad FTS 3000MX instrument in KBr pellets. Elemental analyses were carried out with a Thermo- Flash 2000 elemental analyser. Powder X-ray diﬀraction pat- terns for complexes 1 and 2 were recorded on a Rigaku Smart Lab X-ray diﬀractometer. The X-rays were produced using a sealed tube and the wavelength of the X-ray was 0.154 nm (CuK-alpha). The X-rays were detected using a linear counting detector (Scintillator NaI photomultiplier detector). Spectro- photometric measurements were performed on a Varian UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Model: Cary 100) using a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Gas chromatographic (GC) measurements were carried out using a FISONS Instruments GC 8000 series gas chromatograph with an FID detector and a capillary column (DB-WAX, column length: 30 m; internal dia- meter: 0.32 mm) and the Jasco-Borwin v.1.50 software. The temperature of injection was 240 °C. The initial temperature was maintained at 120 °C for 1 min, then raised at 10 °C min−1 to 200 °C and held at this temperature for 1 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas. Caution! Azide and tetrazolate compounds are potentially explosive. Only a small amount of material should be prepared and handled with care. Synthesis of {[Cu3(µ3-4-ptz)4(µ2-N3)2(DMF)2](DMF)2}n (1). An excess of solid 4-cyanopyridine (249 mg, 2.4 mmol) was added to the brown coloured mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (102 mg, 0.6 mmol) and NaN3 (78 mg, 1.2 mmol) in water (1 mL) and DMF (6 mL). The obtained brown solution was stirred at 85 °C for 3 h, and then a green coloured compound started to pre- cipitate. The stirring was continued for another hour. The mixture was then filtered and the resulting filtrate was left to slowly evaporate in air. Green coloured rod shaped X-ray dif- fraction quality crystals started to form after 1 d. They were fil- tered and washed with DMF and diethyl ether. Yield = 112 mg (16.2%), anal. calc. for C42H58Cu3N16O6, C, 46.98, H, 5.45, N, 20.87, found: C, 47.01, H, 5.47, N, 20.90. IR (KBr): 2081(s) 1670(s), 1624(s), 1434(m), 1383(w), 1296(w), 1219(w), 1093(m), 1015(m). The purity of the bulk sample of 1 was confirmed by the PXRD patterns of the sample (Fig. S1†). Synthesis of {[Cu(4-ptz)2(H2O)2]}n (2). A greenish brown mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (51 mg, 0.3 mmol), NaN3 (39 mg, 0.6 mmol) and 4-cyanopyridine (125 mg, 1.2 mmol) in a H2O and DMF (1 mL : 6 mL) mixture was placed into a reaction tube and that was irradiated with microwave radiation for 30 min at 85 °C. The resulting green coloured precipitate was filtered oﬀ from brown solution and discarded. The filtrate was left to slowly evaporate in air resulting in the formation of blue cubic shaped crystals in 3 d. These were isolated and washed with DMF and diethyl ether. Yield = 55 mg (19.1%), anal. calc. for C12H12CuN10O2: C, 36.78, H, 3.09, N, 35.75, found: C, 37.00, H, 3.11, N, 35.78. IR (KBr): 3486(m), 1659(s), 1494(w), 1438(m), 1389(m), 1253(m), 1102(m). The purity of the bulk sample of 2 was confirmed using the PXRD patterns of the sample (Fig. S2†). X-ray crystallography Single crystal X-ray structural studies of compounds 1 and 2 were performed on a CCD Agilent Technologies (Oxford Diﬀr- action) SUPER NOVA diﬀractometer. Data were collected at 150(2) K using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λα = 0.71073 Å). The strategy for the data collection was evaluated using the CrysAlisPro CCD software. The data were collected by the standard phi–omega scan techniques and were scaled and reduced using the CrysAlisPro RED software. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 and refined by full matrix least-squares with SHELXL-97, refining on F 2.9 The positions of all the atoms were obtained by direct methods. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The remaining hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically constrained positions and refined with isotropic temperature factors, generally 1.2Ueq of their parent atoms. The crystal and refinement data are summarized in Table 1. It is worth notingthat randomly dispersed solvent molecules (DMF–H2O used for crystallization) were found in the framework of 2 and attempts were made to refine the structure using con- ventional discrete-atom models remained unsuccessful. This issue was solved by deducting the contribution of the solvent electron density using the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON.10 Typical procedures for the catalytic oxidation of alcohols and product analysis Oxidation reactions were carried out in sealed cylindrical Pyrex tubes under focused microwave irradiation as follows: the alcohol substrate (5 mmol), the catalyst precursor 1 or 2 (10 μmol, 0.2 mol% vs. substrate) and a 70% aqueous solution Dalton Transactions Paper This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 Dalton Trans., 2014, 43, 9944–9954 | 9945 Published on 01 May 2014.

This was then placed in the microwave reactor and the system was stirred and irradiated (10 W) for 0.25–3 h at 80 °C. After the reaction, the mixture was allowed to cool down to room temp- erature. 300 μL of benzaldehyde (internal standard) and 5 mL of NCMe (to extract the substrate and the organic products from the reaction mixture) were added. The obtained mixture was stirred for 10 min and then a sample (1 μL) was taken from the organic phase and analysed by GC using the internal standard method. Results and discussion Compound 1 has been prepared by reacting a solution of copper(II) chloride with two equivalents of sodium azide along with an excess of 4-cyanopyridine (4 equivalents) in a 1 : 6 (v : v) mixture of water and DMF at 85 °C for 4 h (Scheme 1). A green coloured solid 1 was precipitated and its further crop was obtained upon filtration and subsequent evaporation of the mother liquor, producing green crystals suitable for single- crystal X-ray diﬀraction. A diﬀerent procedure involved a microwave irradiation, at 85 °C for 30 min, of a mixture containing copper(II) chloride, sodium azide and 4-cyanopyridine in a 1 : 2 : 4 molar ratio using a water–DMF mixture (1 : 6, v : v). The obtained mixture was filtered and the filtrate was left in air for 3 d, resulting in blue coloured cubic crystals of 2, suitable for single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis. The obtained compounds were characterized by IR spec- troscopy, elemental analysis and single-crystal X-ray crystallo- graphy. The IR spectrum of 1 shows a strong band at 2081 cm−1 typical for µ-azide ions in a 1,1-bridging mode.11 An additional band due to the presence of tetrazole ions is observed in the 1655–1670 cm−1 range.12 In 2, the stretching band at 1659 cm−1 indicates the presence of tetrazolate ions,12 while the characteristic broad band of water molecules at 3486 cm−1 arises from the O–H stretching.11 Powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded for samples 1 and 2 showing a very good match with the respective simulated pat- terns acquired from the single crystal X-ray data, thus demon- strating the phase purity of the bulk samples. Crystal structure of {[Cu3(µ3-4-ptz)4(µ2-N3)2(DMF)2](DMF)2}n (1) The 3D polymeric structure of compound 1 bearing a tri- nuclear Cu(II) core was revealed by single crystal X-ray diﬀrac- tion data. There are two types of copper centres observed in the trinuclear secondary building unit (SBU) (Fig. 1a). The “central” six-coordinate Cu1 atom possesses a distorted octa- hedral geometry filled by four bridging 4-ptz ligands in the equatorial sites, whereas the axial positions are taken by the azide moieties that bridge in a μ1,1-mode linking the copper centres into a Cu3 SBU. The copper azide bond distances are relatively large (2.326 Å) because of the Jahn–Teller eﬀect. The bond length and bond angle data are summarized in Table 2.

View Article Online Apart from azide linkers, the “outer” six-coordinate Cu2 atoms are connected with the “central” Cu1 ion by means of two tetrazolate moieties which are bridging in a N2/N3 mode. The other coordination positions of the Cu2 atoms are occupied by two pyridyl groups of the bridging 4-ptz ligands and one term- inal DMF molecule. Each of these trinuclear SBUs is inter- linked with eight adjacent Cu3 units via the 4-ptz moieties, resulting in an intricate 3D metal–organic framework with the box type open-end voids having the 1.3 × 1.5 nm dimensions (Fig. 1b). The solvent of crystallization (DMF molecules) occupies the voids and further stabilizes the obtained frame- work via H-bonding interactions (Table 3). To better understand the intricate structure of the 3D metal–organic framework 1, we have carried out its topological analysis13 using the concept of the simplified underlying net.14,15 Hence, after omitting the terminal DMF ligands and reducing the µ2-N3 and µ3-4-ptz moieties to their centroids, the resulting network (Fig. 2a) can be described as an underlying net constructed from the 6-connected Cu1 and 5-connected Cu2 nodes, 3-connected µ3-4-ptz nodes and 2-connected µ2-N3 linkers. The topological analysis of this net reveals a complex tri- nodal 3,5,6-connected network with a unique topology depicted by the point symbol of (3·82)4(32·4·83·93·10)2(34·42·96·103), wherein the (3·82), (32·4·83·93·10) and (34·42·96·103) indices corre- spond to the µ3-4-ptz, Cu2 and Cu1 nodes, respectively. The obtained network can be simplified further, namely by treating the tricopper [Cu3(µ2-N3)2] units as the 8-connected cluster nodes and the µ3-4-ptz blocks as the 2-connected linkers, result- ing in a uninodal 8-connected net (Fig. 2b) with the bcu (body centred cubic) topology and the point symbol of (424·64).14,16,17 Fig. 1 Structural fragments of 1.

View Article Online Crystal structure of {[Cu(µ2-4-ptz)2(H2O)2]}n (2) Single crystal X-ray diﬀraction data revealed that the structure of 2 features a 2D coordination framework assembled from the Cu(II) centres and µ2-4-ptz linkers. The geometry around the six-coordinate Cu1 atom is also distorted octahedral, being filled by a pair of N atoms from the pyridyl group and another pair of tetrazolato N atoms from the 4-ptz moieties in the mutually trans-fashion to complete the square base, whereas the remaining axial positions are occupied by oxygen atoms of two terminal water ligands (Fig. 3a). The coordinated water molecules are arranged comparatively far from the basal plane moieties (Table 2). Hence, each 4-ptz acts as a µ2-linker sewing the Cu centres into a grid-like 2D network. The adjacent 2D layers are stacked and zipped through hydrogen bonding inter- actions [C(5)–H(5)⋯O(1)], to generate a 3D supramolecular network (Table 3). The inter-layer distance between two adja- cent layers is 13.072 Å (Fig. 3b). A 3D supramolecular network features porosity due to the presence of open-ended rhombic shaped voids along the c axis, with the dimensions of 1.6 × 1.1 nm (Fig. 3c). In addition, the above voids were loaded with disordered solvent molecules (probably water and DMF used during crystallization), which could not be refined by discrete- atom models and thus were subtracted from the diﬀraction pattern by the “SQUEEZE” method. The 2D metal–organic network of 2 has also been simpli- fied for the sake of topological analysis, namely by omitting the terminal H2O moieties and contracting the µ2-4-ptz ligands to their centroids. The obtained underlying layer is thus assembled from the 4-connected Cu1 nodes and 2-con- nected µ2-4-ptz linkers (Fig. 4). From the topological viewpoint, this 2D network can be classified as a uninodal 4-connected net with the sql [Shubnikov tetragonal plane net] topology described by the point symbol of (44·62).14,16 A number of 4-ptz derivatives with the sql topology have been reported.3g,18 Added solvent-free microwave-assisted oxidation of second- ary alcohols. Complexes 1 and 2 have been tested as catalyst precursors for the homogeneous oxidation of secondary alco- hols (1-phenylethanol, cyclohexanol, 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol, 2-octanol and 3-octanol) to the corresponding ketones using tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) or hydrogen peroxide as an oxi- dizing agent, under typical conditions of 80 °C, and low power (10 W) microwave irradiation (MW), 1 h reaction time and in the absence of any added solvent or additive (Scheme 2). Selected results are summarized in Table 4, whereas the com- plete set of results is presented in Table S1.† Under typical conditions ketone yields up to 86% (TOF = 430 h−1) are obtained for the oxidation of 1-phenylethanol (entry 18, Table 4) by 2. As expected, the aliphatic alcohols are less reactive than the benzylic derivative, 1-phenylethanol, leading under the same reaction conditions to moderate yields in the 38–67% range (Table 4), as reported in other cases.7 Higher yields of cyclohexanone were previously obtained with a related TBHP/MW system in the presence of the tetranuclear Cu(II) complex derived from 2-(2-(dicyanomethylene)hydrazi- nyl)benzoic acid,19a although requiring a 4 times longer reac- tion time. An almost quantitative formation of acetophenone after 4 or 2 h reaction was achieved by oxidation of 1-phenyl- ethanol with TBHP catalysed by [(PhSiO1.5)10(CuO)2- (NaO0.5)2·4EtOH]19b or [(PhSiO1.5)12(CuO)4(NaO0.5)4],19c respect- ively. However, the oxidation of 1-phenylethanol by the 1 or 2/ TBHP/MW systems aﬀords acetophenone in much higher yields (86% (2) or 79% (1), Table 4) than in the presence of various mononuclear Cu(II) complexes bearing N2S2 macro- cycles20 or dinuclear Mn(II) compounds.7h,i Table 2 Bond lengths (Å) and bond angles (°) within and around the trinuclear copper core of 1 and the mononuclear copper centre of 2a Distance Angle Angle Complex 1 Cu(1)–N(8) 2.022(3) N(1)–Cu(1)–N(5) 82.27(10) N(12)#3–Cu(2)–N(2) 94.18(11) Cu(1)–N(1) 2.024(3) N(8)–Cu(1)–N(1) 89.57(10) N(5)–Cu(2)–N(13)#2 87.78(11) Cu(1)–N(5) 2.326(3) N(8)–Cu(1)–N(5) 92.56(10) N(5)–Cu(2)–N(12)#3 172.90(11) Cu(2)–N(2) 2.024(3) N(8)–Cu(1)–N(8)#1 180.0 N(5)–Cu(2)–O(1) 95.42(10) Cu(2)–N(5) 1.996(3) N(1)–Cu(1)–N(1)#1 180.0 N(13)#2–Cu(2)–N(12)#3 90.44(11) Cu(2)–N(13)#2 2.013(3) N(5)–Cu(1)–N(5)#1 180.00(14) N(13)#2–Cu(2)–O(1) 91.10(10) Cu(2)–N(12)#3 2.018(3) N(5)–Cu(2)–N(2) 87.96(10) N(12)#3–Cu(2)–O(1) 91.48(10) Cu(2)–O(1) 2.381(3) N(2)–Cu(2)–O(1) 86.00(10) N(2)–Cu(2)–N(13) 174.58 Complex 2 Cu(1)–N(2) 2.012(5) N(2)–Cu(1)–N(1) 92.4(2) N(2)#1–Cu(1)–N(2) 180.0(2) Cu(1)–N(1) 2.066(5) N(2)–Cu(1)–O(101) 87.88(19) N(1)–Cu(1)–N(1)#1 180.0(1) Cu(1)–O(101) 2.387(5) N(1)–Cu(1)–O(101) 90.6(2) O(101)–Cu(1)–O(101)#1 180.0 a Symmetry codes: #1 −x, −y, −z + 1, #2 x −1/2, −y + 1/2, z −1/2, #3 x + 1/2, −y + 1/2, z −1/2.

View Article Online Moreover, it appears that the eﬃciency of oxidation of linear aliphatic alcohols (C6 or C8) is not aﬀected by the position of the OH group in the aliphatic chain of the substrate, as attested by similar yields of 2- and 3-hexanones or 2- and 3-octanones (compare e.g., entries 27 and 29 or 31 and 33, Table 4). However, alcohols with a shorter aliphatic chain typically lead to higher product yields (Table 4, entries 10, 12 vs. 14, 16). The relevance of the 4-ptz ligands to the catalytic activity of the obtained compounds is shown by the catalytic perform- ances of CuCl2 in the oxidation of the used substrates (yields in the 2–7% range, entries 69 and 72–76, Table S1†) compared with those of 1 and 2 under the same reaction conditions.

View Article Online Addition of a TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) radical, an eﬃcient mediator for the aerobic oxidation of alco- hols7d,j,21 although scarcely used for the peroxidative oxida- tion7h,i,m,22 of those substrates, provided the quantitative formation of acetophenone (entry 22, Table 4) and a signifi- cant increase in all other ketone yields (see e.g., entries 1, 4, 10, 12, 14 or 16 vs. 2, 8, 11, 13, 15 or 17, Table 4). It should be noted that in contrast to TBHP, hydrogen per- oxide (30% aqueous solution) is a less eﬃcient reagent for the oxidation of the tested alcohols, as attested by the marked ketone yield lowering (see Fig. 5 and Table S1†), in accord with the known decomposition of H2O2 under the used reaction conditions (80 °C). Moreover, the use of a higher amount of oxidant (see entries 5, 19 or 2, 45 of Tables 4 and S1,† respect- ively) or longer reaction time (see e.g., entries 3, 9, 23 and 26, Table 4) does not lead to a better conversion. Attempts to perform the oxidation of secondary alcohols in the presence of 1 or 2 at room temperature failed, whereas the reaction conducted at 50 °C resulted in a marked ketone yield drop relative to that at 80 °C (e.g., for 1, from 79, 58, 63, or 38% at 80 °C to 22, 15, 23 or 17% at 50 °C, respectively, Table S1† and Fig. 6). Moreover, the ketone yield does not increase significantly above 80 °C (see Fig. 6 and entries 1, 10, Scheme 2 Added solvent-free oxidation of 1-phenylethanol and cyclo- hexanol to acetophenone and cyclohexanone, respectively, by the 1 or 2/TBHP/MW system.

Microwave irradiation (MW) can provide a more eﬃcient synthetic method than conventional heating, thus allowing the attainment of similar yields in shorter times or improved yields and/or selectivities.7c,h–m,22 A favourable eﬀect of MW is also observed in this study, even with the low power of 10 W. Hence, for example, 86% yield of acetophenone was obtained after 1 h reaction under microwave irradiation, while a similar reaction under conventional heating (oil bath) gives only 7% yield. A noteworthy feature of our MW-assisted oxi- dations is the application of a very weak MW irradiation (10 W). This contrasts with most of the MW-assisted organic reactions reported,23 which require a much higher power of MW irradiation (typically above 200 or even 500 W). Furthermore, important features of 1 and 2 concern their relatively low loading (0.2 mol% vs. substrate) necessary to reach high yields of ketone (e.g., up to 99% of acetophenone when in the presence of TEMPO), also undergoing under solvent- and additive-free conditions. This is advantageous in comparison with the common use of organic solvents or costly ionic liquids in various state-of-the-art methods for the oxi- dation of alcohols.23b,24 The peroxidative oxidation of the tested secondary alcohols is believed to proceed mainly via a radical mechanism which involves both carbon- and oxygen-centred radicals. In fact, the addition to the reaction mixture of Ph2NH or CBrCl3, well known oxygen- and carbon-radical traps, respectively,25 led to a large yield drop of over 90% (Table S1,† entries 4, 38 vs. 5, 39 for 1-phenylethanol or 13, 47 vs. 14, 48 for cyclohexanol, respectively), compared to the reaction carried out under the same conditions but in the absence of a radical trap (Table S1,† entries 1, 10, 35 or 44, respectively). This result suggests the generation of oxygen and carbon radicals in the reaction, which are trapped by those radical scavengers. A possible mechanism21i,k,26 for this system may involve coordination of the alcohol e.g., PhCH(OH)Me (with deproto- nation to form an alkoxide ligand) and a TEMPO radical, fol- lowed by H transfer from the former to the latter with formation of the O-ligated radical PhC•(O)Me−and TEMPOH. Intramolecular electron-transfer from the PhC•(O)Me−co- ordinated to CuII leads to the formation of the ketone PhC(O)- Me and CuI which is reoxidised to CuII by O2/TBHP. The TEMPO radical is also regenerated upon oxidation of TEMPOH. In order to get further insight into the catalytic cycle, the model reaction with 5 mmol of cyclohexanol, 10 mmol of aqueous solution of TBHP and 5 mol% TEMPO was moni- tored, under a dinitrogen atmosphere in the presence of cata- lyst precursors 1 and 2, by spectrophotometry. Upon addition of the catalyst precursor into the reaction mixture [cyclohexa- nol and TBHP (70 wt% in water)] a strong MLCT band was instantaneously observed at 442 nm (Fig. S3†), being character- istic of a copper(I) species.27 After addition of TEMPO the solu- tion color changes from colorless to orange and this color upon exposure to dioxygen gradually changed to brown with time, indicating the initial reduction of copper(II) (green) to copper(I) (orange) in the presence of alcohol and TEMPO. These results also confirm the radical mechanism where reduction of copper(II) leads to the oxidation of alcohol, fol- lowed by the subsequent oxidation of copper(I) by O2/TBHP. The solids obtained after the oxidation reactions with the catalyst precursors 1 and 2 have been analyzed by IR spec- troscopy, PXRD and elemental analyses. From the IR spectrum of a solid derived from 1 after the catalytic reaction, it has been found that the band at 2081 cm−1 has vanished, clearly indicating the absence of azide in the system, whereas the observed hump at 1656 cm−1 might suggest the presence of tetrazole in the residue. The elemental analysis result with a high percentage of nitrogen also indicates the probable pres- ence of tetrazole in the residual compound derived from 1. The PXRD pattern confirms that 1 lost its crystalline nature and has a structure well distinct from that of the parent com- pound 1 (Fig. S4†). In the case of 2, although the IR spectrum of the corresponding residual compound after the catalytic reaction is almost similar to that of 2 and elemental analysis data suggest the presence of tetrazole moieties, the PXRD pattern also indicates the deformation of the framework (Fig. S5†). These observations indicate that both compounds 1 and 2 are not intact during the course of catalytic tests and thus behave as precursors of homogeneous catalytically active species. We believe that further research aimed at the incor- poration of the present types of tetrazole based copper–organic frameworks on solid matrices or supports would allow the generation of more stable and potentially recyclable catalytic systems. This research direction as well as the detailed investi- gation of the mechanism will be explored in our future studies. Conclusions Two diﬀerent metal–organic frameworks 1 and 2 have been synthesized by means of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between 4-cyanopyridine and azide in the presence of copper(II) chlor- ide by varying the reaction conditions only. A notable feature of an underlying 3,5,6-connected 3D net of 1 concerns its novel topology described by the point symbol of (3·82)4(32·4·83·93·10)2(34·42·96·103), which can be further simpli- fied to a body centred cubic (bcu) network bearing a trinuclear Cu3-secondary building unit. In contrast, the 2D network of 2 reveals an underlying Shubnikov tetragonal plane net (sql). Thus, the present work also contributes to the identification of novel topological types observed within the metal–organic framework materials. Furthermore, both compounds show a high activity as catalyst precursors towards the microwave- assisted homogeneous oxidation of secondary alcohols leading to ketone yields up to 99% (2) under added solvent-free con- ditions. Hence, this study also widens the scope of MW- assisted transformations applied to the oxidative functionali- zation of organic substrates and extends the range of eﬃcient catalytic systems applicable to such reactions.
