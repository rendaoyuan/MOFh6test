Manuscript Dalton Transactions PAPER Cite this: Dalton Trans., 2013, 42, 1603 Received 28th August 2012, Accepted 18th October 2012 DOI: 10.1039/c2dt31965a www.rsc.org/dalton Novel metal(II) coordination polymers based on N,N’-bis-(4-pyridyl)phthalamide as supercapacitor electrode materials in an aqueous electrolyte† Yun Gong, Jian Li, Peng-Gang Jiang, Qing-Fang Li and Jian-Hua Lin* Based on the redox-active L (N,N’-bis-(4-pyridyl)phthalamide) ligand, two porous MOFs formulated as Zn6(BPC)6(L)3·9DMF (H2BPC = 4,4’-biphenyldicarboxylic acid) (1) and Cd2(TDC)2(L)2·4H2O (H2TDC = 2,5- thiophenedicarboxylic acid) (2) were synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diﬀractions. Complex 1 features a uninodal 5-connected 3-fold interpenetrated 3D framework with {46.64}-bnn hexagonal BN topology. Complex 2 displays a uninodal 6-connected 2-fold interpenetrated 3D framework with {412.63}-pcu topology. When complexes 1 and 2 are used as supercapacitor electrode materials, they can provide a large voltage window as high as 2.6 V in an aqueous electrolyte, and their speciﬁc capacitances are much more than the value for the bare carbon glassy electrode. It is observed that the more the current density, the less the speciﬁc capacitance for the two kinds of supercapacitor electrode materials. The two complexes show diﬀerent thermal stabilities, UV absorption and photolumi- nescence properties. Introduction The design, synthesis and application of new materials with novel structure are challenging and meaningful subjects for chemists and materials scientists. Recently, intensive research has been focused on constructing a new class of crystalline porous materials that are commonly referred to as porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), in which metal ions and clusters are linked by organic units.1,2 The successful prep- aration of porous MOFs with high surface areas, high stab- ilities, large pore volumes, and organic functionality has led to their potential applications in ion exchange, sorption, cataly- sis, etc.1,2 Electrochemical capacitors (also known as “supercapaci- tors”, “ultracapacitors” or “power capacitors”) are charge- storage devices with high power density and long cycle life, which is an active area of research seeking to develop the next generation of cost-eﬀective, energy-eﬃcient and environmen- tally-friendly power sources for a variety of applications.3 There are two types of supercapacitors: (a) “electrochemical double layer capacitors” (EDLC) and (b) “pseudocapacitors”. The operation mechanism of the former involves the non-Faradaic separation of charges at the “double-layer” (i.e., the electrode/ electrolyte interface) while the latter involves the fast Faradaic, redox reaction of electroactive materials at the interface.4 As supercapacitors utilize adsorbing/desorbing charged ions from an electrolyte onto the surface of electrodes for harvesting energy, reasonably high surface area and optimum pore size of the electrode materials for an appropriate electrolyte solution play an important role in ensuring the excellent performance of a supercapacitor in terms of power density and energy storage capability.5 Thus a lot of eﬀort has been made to increase the surface area and accelerate ion transport within porous channels of electrode materials. Porous MOFs possess high surface areas and adjustable pore sizes,6 however, to the best of our knowledge, up to now no research has been reported on the utilization of MOFs as supercapacitors. Recently, we synthesized a hemi-rigid ditopic ligand, N,N′- bis-(4-pyridyl)phthalamide (L). Due to the rotation of the flexible C–N single bonds in the structure, L possesses cis- and trans-conformations (Scheme 1). The ligand was proved to be a good candidate for the construction of porous MOFs.7 Herein, as a continuation of our work, in an attempt to investigate the supercapacitive behaviour of porous MOFs, based on L and two carboxylic coligands, 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (H2BPC) and 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid (H2TDC), two novel metal complexes formulated as Zn6(BPC)6(L)3·9DMF (1) and Cd2(TDC)2(L)2·2H2O (2) are obtained via the hydro(solvo) †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

Their cyclic voltammo- grams (CVs), electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EISs), galvanostatic charge–discharge activities, UV absorption spectra, photoluminescence properties and thermal stabilities have been investigated. Experimental General considerations All chemicals purchased were of reagent grade and used without further purification. C, H, N elemental analyses were performed on an Elementar Vario MICRO E III analyzer. IR spectra were recorded as KBr pellets on a PerkinElmer spectro- meter. The powder XRD (PXRD) data were collected on a RIGAKU DMAX2500PC diﬀractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and simultaneous diﬀeren- tial scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed on a NETZSCH5 STA 449C thermogravimetric analyzer in flowing Ar with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV spectra were measured on a HITACHI U-4100 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Solid- state photoluminescence spectra of all the compounds were measured at room temperature with an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer. The instrument was equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp as the exciting light source. Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements were done in a three- electrode test cell. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a platinum foil were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. The working electrode was prepared as follows. An ethanol dispersion of 4 mg samples (1 mL) and 0.05 mL of nafion solution were deposited on a glassy carbon electrode and the solvent was dried by an IR lamp. The electroactive area of the glassy carbon electrode was 0.2 cm2. All the measure- ments were recorded in 20 mL of N2 degassed solution at 25 °C. Cyclic voltammograms were tested in the electrolyte of 1.0 M Li2SO4 aqueous solution using a Shiruisi RST5200 electrochemical workstation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed with Autolab Frequency Response Analyser (FRA) software between 1 MHz and 1 Hz. The galvanostatic charge–discharge measure- ments were done in a two-electrode experimental set-up using a Neware BTS-5V5mA battery analyzer. The above working elec- trode was used as the cathode and anode. Synthesis SYNTHESIS OF ZN6(BPC)6(L)3·9DMF (1).

X-ray crystallography Single-crystal X-ray data for the three complexes were collected on a Bruker-APEX CCD area detector-equipped diﬀractometer using graphite monochromated Cu Kα (λ = 1.54184 Å) for complex 1 and Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation for complex 2 at room temperature. Empirical absorption correction was applied. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 using the SHELXTL-97 software.8 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All of the hydrogen atoms were placed in the calculated positions. Even using graphite monochro- mated Cu Kα (λ = 1.54184 Å) radiation for complex 1, due to the room temperature data collection, the structure of complex 1 displays very high equivalent isotropic displacement para- meter values (Ueq = >0.15) for almost all atoms, indicating that these atoms are probably involved in some form of disorder. The crystal data and structure refinements for complexes 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles for complexes 1 and 2 are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† The CCDC reference numbers are the following: 890923 for complex 1 and 890924 for complex 2.

View Article Online Results and discussion Crystal structure of Zn6(BPC)6(L)3·9DMF (1) Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis reveals that complex 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1ˉ (Table 1). In complex 1, the asymmetric unit contains six Zn(II), five and two half BPC2−, three L and nine uncoordinated DMF molecules. The crystallographically independent Zn(1), Zn(3), Zn(5), Zn(6) exhibit a similar slightly distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry, defined by three O atoms from two bidentate brid- ging carboxylate groups and one monodentate carboxylate group of three BPC2−and one N atom from L. Both Zn(2) and Zn(4) are five coordinated by four O atoms from two bidentate bridging carboxylate groups and one chelating carboxylate group of three BPCA2−and one N atom from L to furnish a slightly distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination environ- ment [Zn–O 1.912(7)–2.439(7) Å, Zn–N 1.976(8)–2.075(8) Å] (Table S1†). In complex 1, one benzene ring and one pyridine ring of one L ligand are disordered over two locations with each site of them half-occupied, and the L ligand exhibits a trans-conformation. The other two crystallographically in- dependent L ligands display cis- and trans-conformations, respectively (Scheme 1). The dihedral angles between the phenyl ring and two pyridine rings of the cis-L are 60.6 and 31.1°, respectively. As for the trans-L, the dihedral angles are 35.4 and 21.0°, respectively. In complex 1, the BPC2−ligands display three coordination modes: one links four Zn(II) with two bidentate bridging carboxylate groups; another shows a bis-monodentate bridging coordination mode and the third acts as a μ2-bridge with one monodentate carboxylate group and one chelating carboxylate group (Scheme 2a–c). The two phenyl rings of the BPC2−ligands are almost coplanar. The dihedral angles of them are shown in Table S2.† Two Zn(II) ions are linked by two bidentate bridging carboxy- late groups into a Zn2 unit with the Zn⋯Zn separation in the range of 3.344–3.498 Å, which is further connected to five neighbouring Zn2 units through two L, two bis-bidentate brid- ging BPC2−and a pair of monodentate/chelating bridging BPC2−(Fig. 1a). If the Zn2 unit is defined as a 5-connected node, all the L and BPC2−ligands act as μ2-bridges and can be not counted as nodes topologically,9 complex 1 exhibits a uninodal 5-connected 3-fold interpenetrated three dimen- sional (3D) framework with {46.64}-bnn hexagonal BN topology (Fig. 1b).10 The solvent-accessible volume of the unit cell of complex 1 is 7481.8 Å3, which is approximately 59.5% of the unit-cell volume (12 582.8 Å3).11 The cross-section of the cavity is ca. 9.0 × 8.7 Å2, which is occupied by the uncoordinated DMF molecules (Fig. S1†). THE ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTY OF COMPLEX 1. The phase purities of complexes 1 and 2 were supported by the powder X-ray diﬀr- action (PXRD) patterns of the bulk samples, which are consist- ent with the calculated patterns (Fig. S2†). Fig. 2 is the cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the 1-modified electrode (1-GCE) in 1 M Li2SO4 aqueous solution in the range from −1.5 to 1.5 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) at 50 mV s−1. For comparison, the electrochemical behaviours at the bare carbon glassy electrode (GCE), the L-modified electrode (L-GCE) and the H2BPC-modified electrode (H2BPC-GCE) were also studied. Two irreversible peaks at −0.4 and 0.8 V vs. SCE were observed at the bare GCE (Fig. 2), which coincides with the evolution of bubbles, corresponding to the generation of H2 and O2 from water, respectively. In the range of −0.4–0.8 V vs. SCE, the CV of the bare GCE shows a typical rectangular Table 1 Crystal data and structure reﬁnements for complexes 1 and 2 Complex 1 2 Empirical formula C165H153N21O39Zn6 C48H36Cd2N8O14S2 M 3446.43 1237.81 Crystal system Triclinic Monoclinic Space group P1ˉ P21/c a/Å 22.6778(8) 20.3874(19) b/Å 24.1597(15) 19.5406(17) c/Å 25.3477(16) 14.9256(13) α/° 66.5806(10) 90 β/° 81.0540(10) 94.3790(10) γ/° 88.0370(12) 90 V/Å3 12 582.8(12) 5928.7(9) Z 2 4 Dcalcd/g cm−3 0.736 1.361 μ/mm−1 0.976 0.848 No. of unique reflcns 15 188 10 437 F(0 0 0) 2844 2430 Goodness-of-fit on F2 1.060 0.986 Final R indices [I > 2σ(I)] R1 = 0.0874, wR2 = 0.2299 R1 = 0.0490, wR2 = 0.1262 R1 = Σ||F0| −|Fc||/Σ|F0|; wR2 = Σ[w(F0 2 −Fc 2)2]/Σ[w(F0 2)2]1/2.

As for H2BPC-GCE, similar potentials for the evolution of H2 and O2 accompanying the lowered currents are observed in the CV (Fig. 2), indicative of the increased electrode resist- ance and the lower conductivity of H2BPC. When 1-GCE is uti- lized, a reversible redox couple is observed with 0.12 V of anodic (Epa) and 0.40 V of cathodic peak potentials (Epc) vs. SCE, respectively (Fig. 2). In the presence of L-GCE, similar reversible redox peaks appear at Epa = 0.10 and Epc = 0.48 V vs. SCE, respectively, indicating they are assigned to the redox of the CvO bond in the ligand. Thus complex 1 shows pseudo- capacitive behaviour, which arises from the redox-active L ligand in the structure. Furthermore, the potentials for the generation of H2 and O2 at 1-GCE are shifted to more negative (−1.5 V) and positive potentials (1.3 V vs. SCE), respectively (Fig. 2 and 3), suggesting the retardance of the electrolysis of water in the presence of complex 1. As shown in Fig. 3, the almost rectangular curves in the potential window from −1.4 to 1.2 V vs. SCE suggest the good capacitive behaviour of complex 1. Thus the potential range of −1.4–1.2 V vs. SCE for complex 1 is unprecedentedly large for a supercapacitor in an aqueous electrolyte. As we know, in an aqueous electrolyte, the maximum operating voltage is theoretically limited by the elec- trolysis of water to 1.229 V (at 25 °C). When using an organic electrolyte such as propylene carbonate solvent, the operating voltage is limited to roughly 2.7 V.12 The present example indi- cates that 1-GCE can provide a voltage window as high as 2.6 V in an aqueous electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 2, the area for the rectangular CV curve of 1-GCE is larger than those of the other electrodes, suggesting Fig. 1 3D architecture of complex 1 (H atoms omitted for clarity) (a); schematic illustrating the 3-fold interpenetrated 3D framework with {46.64}-bnn hexagonal BN topology in complex 1 (b).

View Article Online that complex 1 exhibits a larger capacitance compared to the bare electrode and the ligand-modified electrodes (Fig. 2). The good capacitive behaviour of complex 1 implies the existence of favourable diﬀusion channels in the complex that allowed cations and anions to transport, which is in good agreement with the crystal structure of the complex. The current at 1-GCE is proportional to the scan rate (Fig. 3), and the ratio of anodic and cathodic peak current is almost unchanged at diﬀerent scan rates, indicating that the redox process is diﬀusion- controlled (Fig. 3).13 It is well documented that galvanostatic discharge is the most reliable and accurate method for evaluating the super- capacitance of electrodes.14 Fig. 4 shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge curve for complex 1 measured at a current density of 18.75 mA g−1 and the electrode was charged– discharged from 0 to 2.6 V. As can be seen, a clear deviation from the ideal triangular shape is observed at 1-GCE. Such characteristics represent typical eﬀects of pseudocapacitive contributions. When the current density is decreased to 6.25 and 2.5 mA g−1, the potential can only be charged up to 2.0 and 1.2 V, respectively (Fig. S4 and S5†). The less the current density, the more the discharge time. When the current density is increased to 25 mA g−1, the supercapacitor is easily overcharged. The specific capacitance (SC), specific power density (SP) and specific energy (SE) based on the active material were cal- culated from the discharge process and the results are pre- sented in Table S3.† The values of the SC at 2.5, 6.25 and 18.75 mA g−1 were approximately 23, 5.2 and 1.4 F g−1 for complex 1, respectively, indicating that the more the current density, the less the SC, which is probably due to the micro- porous structure of the complex. It is expected that enough time is available for the transport of cations and anions through the channel at the lower current density. For comparative study, the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves for the bare GCE are also measured. Based on the CVs at the bare GCE (Fig. 2 and S3†), the charge–discharge window is limited in the range of 0–1.2 V to avoid the electrolysis of water (Fig. 4 and S4†). At a current density of 2.5 mA g−1, the potential of the bare GCE can only be charged up to 0.6 V (Fig. S5†). The discharging time for the bare GCE is much lower than that for 1-GCE at each current density (Fig. 4, S4 and S5†). The values of the SC at 18.75, 6.25 and 2.5 mA g−1 were approximately 0.3, 0.5 and 0.6 F g−1 for the bare GCE, respectively, which are much less than the corresponding values for complex 1, indicating that 1-GCE exhibits a larger capacitance than the bare electrode. The result further proves the capacitance is related to the porous structure of the elec- trode material. The stability of complex 1 was tested by continuous cycling at a current density of 18.75 mA g−1. A typical repetitive charge–discharge cycling for 500 cycles is shown in Fig. 4. The figure clearly shows that the electrode is able to charge and discharge continuously without significant loss in capacitance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measure- ments were carried out with a sinusoidal signal of 10 mV amplitude over the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The Nyquist plot of 1-GCE shows a semicircular loop in the high frequency range, which presents the charge transfer resistance of the electro-active material (Fig. 5).15 The diameter of the semicircle provides the magnitude of the charge transfer resist- ance. In the present case, the value of the resistance is ca. 20 Ω. A straight line in the low frequency region represents the capacitive behaviour of the electrode. The ideal capacitor exhibits a vertical line, while in normal cases, the plot shows a line with the inclined angle between 45° and 90° against the x axis, corresponding to the ion diﬀusion mechanism between Warburg diﬀusion and ideal capacitive ion diﬀusion (pseudo- capacitance).16 CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF CD2(TDC)2(L)2·2H2O (2).

Both Cd(1) and Cd(2) exhibit a distorted octahedral coordination geometry supplied by four O atoms from two bidentate bridging carboxylate groups and one chelating carboxylate group of three TDC2− [Cd–O 2.319(4)–2.434(4) Å], and two N atoms from two L ligands [Cd–N 2.288(4)–2.331(4) Å] (Fig. 6a and Table S1†). Two crystallographically independent L ligands in complex 2 both show a trans-conformation (Scheme 1a and Fig. 6a). The di- hedral angles between the phenyl ring and two pyridine rings of one L are 17.1 and 23.0°, respectively. As for another L, the dihedral angles are 20.1 and 22.9°, respectively. Two crystallo- graphically independent TDC2−ligands in complex 2 adopt a similar coordination mode with one bidentate bridging carboxylate group and one chelating carboxylate group (Scheme 2d). Two Cd(II) ions are linked by two bidentate brid- ging carboxylate groups into a Cd2 unit with a Cd⋯Cd separation of 3.900 Å. Each Cd2 unit is connected to six neigh- boring units through four TDC2−and two pairs of L ligands resulting in a 3D architecture. If the Cd2 unit is regarded as a 6-connected node, all the L and TDC2−ligands act as a 2-con- nected linker, complex 2 displays a uninodal 6-connected 2-fold interpenetrated 3D framework with {412.63}-pcu topology (Fig. 6b).10 Due to the interpenetration, the solvent-accessible volume of the unit cell of complex 2 is reduced to be 1746.4 Å3, which is approximately 29.5% of the unit-cell volume (5928.7 Å3).11 The cross-section of the void is ca. 13.9 × 4.6 Å2, and the uncoordinated water molecules are located in the voids (Fig. S6†). THE ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTY OF COMPLEX 2. The CV of the 2-modified electrode (2-GCE) in 1 M Li2SO4 aqueous solution is shown in Fig. S7.† Similar reversible redox peaks at Epa = 0.09 and Epc = 0.51 V vs. SCE are assigned to the redox of the CvO bond in the structure of L. Diﬀerent from the CV of 1-GCE, a set of reversible anodic and cathodic peaks at Epa = −0.89 and Epc = −0.72 V vs. SCE are probably related to the thiophene functional group in the structure of TDC2− (Fig. S7†). Similarly, the potentials for the generation of H2 and O2 at 2-GCE are shifted to −1.5 and 1.3 V vs. SCE, respecti- vely (Fig. S7†), suggesting that the electrolysis of water is also retarded by complex 2. As shown in Fig. 7, the CVs of complex 2 show almost rec- tangular curves in the range of −1.4–1.2 V vs. SCE for diﬀerent scan rates, suggesting the good capacitive behaviour of the complex. The existence of a channel for the transport of cations and anions in the structure of complex 2 is implied, as evidenced by the crystal structure of the complex. The example demonstrates that 2-GCE also can provide a voltage window as high as 2.6 V in an aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 7). The galvanostatic charge–discharge curve for complex 2 measured at a current density of 18.75 mA g−1 in the range of 0–2.6 V is shown in Fig. 4. When the current densities are 6.25 and 2.5 mA g−1, the potential can only be charged up to 1.7 Fig. 6 3D architecture of complex 2 (H atoms omitted for clarity) (a); schematic illustrating the 6-connected 2-fold interpenetrated 3D framework with {412.63}- pcu topology in complex 2 (b).

The charge–discharge curve at 2-GCE shows a clear deviation from the ideal triangular shape, which is due to the pseudocapacitive contribution (Fig. 4 and S8†). Similar to 1-GCE, the charge–discharge curve at 2-GCE indicates that the less the current density, the more the discharge time. And when the current density is increased to 25 mA g−1, the supercapacitor is easily overcharged. As shown in Table S3,† the values of the SC at 18.75, 6.25 and 2.5 mA g−1 were approximately 1.3, 8.6 and 22 F g−1 for complex 2, respectively, indicating that the less the current density, the more the SC. It is expected that the transport of cations and anions is more eﬀective through the microporous channel in complex 2 at the less current density. The stability of complex 2 was proved by continuous cycling at a current density of 18.75 mA g−1 (Fig. 4). The electrode is able to charge and discharge for 500 cycles without a signifi- cant loss in capacitance. The Nyquist plot of 2-GCE also exhibits two distinct parts including a semicircle in the high frequency region and a sloped line in the low frequency region. The diameter of the semicircular loop is ca. 12 Ω (Fig. 5), indicating that the charge transfer resistance for complex 2 is a bit lower than that for complex 1, which is due to the diﬀerent functional groups in the structures of the two complexes. For comparison, the Nyquist plot of the bare GCE is also measured (Fig. 5), in which a sloped line is observed. The slope of the impedance curve in the low frequency region for the bare GCE is lower than those for complexes 1 and 2, imply- ing that the resistances of the ionic diﬀusion for complexes 1 and 2 are higher than those for the bare electrode (Fig. 5).17 The extra resistances come from the ionic diﬀusion through the microporous channels in complexes 1 and 2. THERMAL STABILITY. In order to examine the thermal stability of complexes 1 and 2, TGA and simultaneous DSC were carried out. The samples were heated up to 900 °C in Ar. It is found that the cavity of complex 1 is occupied by nine DMF mole- cules per unit, as estimated by SQUEEZE and TGA.18 The TGA curve of complex 1 shows one step of weight loss in the range of 70–310 °C with a loss of 19.2 wt% (calc. 19.1 wt%), corre- sponding to the loss of uncoordinated DMF (Fig. 8a). In the same range, the DSC plot of complex 1 shows a broad endotherm with a peak at 198 °C. The organic ligands began to be decomposed when the temperature is higher than 310 °C, and the calorimetric curve of complex 1 shows a con- tinuous endotherm with a peak at 417 °C (Fig. 8a). As for complex 2, its cavity is occupied by two water mol- ecules per unit, as estimated by SQUEEZE and TGA.18 It releases its two uncoordinated water molecules in the range of 30–150 °C (calcd: 2.9%; observed: 2.7%) (Fig. 8b). The DSC curve of complex 2 shows an endothermal peak at 75 °C, fol- lowed by an exothermal peak at 212 °C. The pyrolysis of organic ligands exhibits a complex calorimetric curve with endothermal peaks at 354, 446 and 701 °C and exothermal peaks at 372, 417, 502 and 766 °C (Fig. 8b). In an attempt to remove the solvent molecules from the cavity of complex 1, complex 1 was immersed in CH2Cl2 for three days, then evacuated at 150 °C in vacuum for 6 h. The PXRD pattern of the evacuated sample is similar to the calcu- lated pattern using the single-crystal data, indicating that the host framework of complex 1 is kept (Fig. S2a†). However, the evacuated 1 basically exhibits no N2 sorption at 77 K (Fig. S9†). When the sample was further evacuated at 220 °C in vacuum for 4 h, it still shows no sorption for N2 at 77 K. The PXRD pat- terns of the samples before and after evacuation at 220 °C in vacuum are diﬀerent (Fig. S2a†), indicating that the evacuation at 220 °C probably leads to the removal of guest molecules from the structure and gives rise to the collapse of the host fra- mework of complex 1. The phenomenon is in good agreement with the TG and DSC curves of complex 1, in which complex 1 shows continu- ous weight losses and endotherms with the increase of temp- erature, indicating the bad thermal stability of the complex. However, complex 1 shows good cycling stability during the continuous galvanostatic charge–discharge experiment, indi- cating that solvent displacement and ion diﬀusion may be achieved in the channel of porous MOFs under electric field.

View Article Online solid state at room temperature are shown in Fig. S10.† As shown in Fig. S10,† L exhibits absorption with a maximum at 301 nm in the range of 240–420 nm, which probably corre- sponds to the n–π* or π–π* transition of the aromatic ring.19 H2BPC displays strong absorption in the range of 240–450 nm, in which two maxima at 299 and 325 nm are present. The absorption peaks of H2TDC appear at 297 nm in the range of 240–400 nm. As for complexes 1 and 2, they display absorption in the same range with maxima at 315 and 267 nm, respecti- vely, which are diﬀerent from those of free ligands, implying that the absorption of complexes 1 and 2 may originate from the intraligand transition (ILCT), the ligand-to-ligand change transfer transition (LLCT), and the metal-to-ligand charge- transfer transition (MLCT).19 PHOTOLUMINESCENCE PROPERTY. The emission spectra of the free organic ligands and complexes 1–2 are depicted in Fig. S11.† A very strong photoluminescence emission band at 462 nm (λex = 350 nm) in the range of 375–650 nm is observed for complex 1. Strong emission bands at 400 and 458 nm (λex = 330 nm) are observed in the same range for complex 2. As for the free ligands L, H2BPC and H2TDC, the emission bands are very weak in comparison with complexes 1 and 2, the emissions of the organic ligands almost can be neglected. As for the d10 valence electron configuration of the Zn(II) or Cd(II) ion, the emission band of the Zn(II) or Cd(II) complexes may be assigned to the LLCT, admixing with MLCT and ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition (LMCT) as previously reported.20 The results are in agreement with the absorption spectra of the complexes. The enhancement of luminescence in complexes 1–2 may be attributed to the ligation of the ligand to the metal center, which enhances the rigidity of the ligand and reduces the loss of energy through a radiationless pathway.21 As described above, the emission spectra of com- plexes 1 and 2 are diﬀerent from each other, which is due to the diﬀerent coordination modes of organic ligands and their diﬀerent structures. Complex 1 shows much stronger photoluminescence than complex 2, which is probably due to the double walls of the coplanar BPC2−in the structure. Conclusion In conclusion, we have demonstrated the syntheses, structures and electrochemical properties of two MOFs based on the redox-active L ligand. Complexes 1 and 2 are porous, when they are used as supercapacitor electrode materials, they can retard the electrolysis of water and provide a large operating voltage in an aqueous electrolyte. Both of them exhibit much larger capacitances than the bare carbon glassy electrode. The present work for the first time shows that ion diﬀusion may be achieved in the channel of porous MOFs under electric field and porous MOFs have the potential to be used in the field of supercapacitors. Work on the detailed diﬀusion mechanism is under way. Acknowledgements Financial support from the Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing (No. CSTC 2011jjA50017) is gratefully acknowledged.
