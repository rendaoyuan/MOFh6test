Kinetic hysteresis in gas adsorption behavior for a rigid MOF arising from zig-zag channel structures† Qiang Wei,a Dali Yang,b Toti Eric Larson,b Tiffany L. Kinnibrugh,c Ruqiang Zou,b Neil J.

Mattes*a Received 14th November 2011, Accepted 8th February 2012 DOI: 10.1039/c2jm15860d A new porous MOF, Zn(TBC)2${guest}, is synthesized and studied by the single crystallography, N2 isothermal adsorption and GC separation of CO2 from air. This MOF shows large hysteresis on N2 adsorption at 77 K up to a P/Po of 0.9, which arises from the unique zig-zag channel structures of the framework. The MOF shows promising separation ability for CO2 from air. The rational design, synthesis, and characterization of novel metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are important branches of materials science and inorganic chemistry. Many studies are focused on the utilization of MOFs for commercial applications such as gas storage and gas separations.1 The unique variations of metal–ligand coordination bonds found in MOFs make these molecules strategically advantageous when preparing size selec- tive pore structures, highly ordered channels for mass transport, and for creating the desired physical properties of these organic– inorganic molecular sieves. One distinct structural characteristic found in many MOFs is the structural phenomenon of ‘‘crystal ﬂexibility’’. MOFs with crystalline ﬂexibility can show direct solid-to-solid framework transfers of guest compounds, induced by varying applied physical stimuli, without causing the whole framework to decompose. First and second-generation mesoporous (pore size ranging from 2 to 50 nm) compounds like activated carbon and zeolites are presently being used in large scale industrial processes, e.g., pressure swing adsorption (PSA), for bulk gas separations and for gas puriﬁcation;2 however, MOFs have been called the ‘the third generation of porous frameworks’.3 Recently, hysteretic H2 adsorption was observed in several nanoporous metal–organic frameworks. MOFs have shown interesting hysteretic adsorp- tion-desorption isotherm behaviors, which are associated with their structural ﬂexibility in the solid state. This type of hysteretic sorption indicates that the change in the accessible surface area of the MOFs during the process of the solid-to-solid structural transferring is distinguished from the capillary condensation observed in mesoporous materials.4 To the best of our knowledge, most of the reported hysteretic effects in MOFs are associated with crystal structure ﬂexibility.5–11 There is an advantage of hysteretic adsorption–desorption in gas storage and separation applications because it makes possible external control for varying the sorption characteristics due to asym- metric adsorption-desorption behavior upon gas molecules.7 In this paper we report the synthesis, characterization, and gas adsorption-desorption properties of a new MOF structure, Zn(TBC)2.{guest}, wherein TBC is 4-tetrazolyl benzene carboxylate, and the guests, that are either MeOH or H2O molecules in the as synthesized material’s composition (or O2, N2, N2O, or CO2 after thermal activation above 50 C temperatures). This compound is simply referred to as Framework 1 herein, and it demonstrates a kinetic dependence and hysteresis for N2 sorption during pressure swings at a constant temperature. This sorption behavior is potentially useful for gas separations in pressure swing adsorption applications. This hysteretic property arises from Framework 1’s unique zig-zag pore structure, instead of crystalline ﬂexibility, as reported for the majority of other MOF compounds. Framework 1 shows a 3-dimensional rigid pore structure with a measured surface area up to 270.8m2 g1 (Table 1) after thermal activation at 250 C.

Two carboxylate groups from the TBC ligands bridge the two zinc atoms and they are interconnected through the tetrazolyl groups to form a 3-dimensional frame- work (Fig. 1b). There are two visible channels in the solvated framework structure, which are named as channels A and B respectively (Fig. 2). Channel A, along the a-axis, has a larger cross-section windows of 4  3 A than does channel B along the b-axis (<2.5 A) (van der Waals radii of the H and N atoms is consid- ered). Disordered H2O guest molecules, in the as synthesized Framework 1 structure, are located in the A channels. When the van der Waals ratio of the hydrogen and nitrogen atoms is considered, the size of channel B is too small for guest molecules to occupy. There are more H2O molecules, in the as synthesized Framework 1, that are located just between these two channels, which separate the channels A and B, making only A-channels accessible to any guest molecule (Fig. 2). There appears to be no binding energy difference between the guest H2O molecules inside the A channels and the guest H2O molecules lying between channels A and B. The thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) showed a weight loss of just 7.6 wt% before 100 C (Fig. S2†), and no further weight loss up to 380 C. However, from the surrounding geometry of the two guest H2O molecules, one can assume that the H2O molecules in the A channels are more easily thermally transported than are the H2O molecules located between the channels. The micro-porosity of Framework 1 was analyzed and deter- mined by the nitrogen physio-sorption technique developed by Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET). The surface area and volume per gram of sample are listed in Table 1 as a function of variable thermal activation. It is clear that water and/or meth- anol de-intercalates at temperatures greater than 50 C. It is apparent that the surface area of Framework 1 increases, as does the volume, with temperature increase because of the loss of H2O and or MeOH. The maximum BET surface area at 250 C is 270.8 m2 g1. The nitrogen sorption isotherm showed a large range of hysteresis from 0–0.9 P/Po with a maximum hysteretic difference between adsorption and desorption branch occurring below pressure swings of P/Po< 0.05 (Fig. 3a). The isotherms of these samples are the combination of Type I, Type II and Type IV isotherms, and suggest that the samples have a wide distribution of pore sizes from micro to macro-pores. The characteristics of Type I isotherm is reﬂected at low P/Po (<0.05). For the activated samples (>50 C), the relatively high uptake at low P/Po (<0.05) indicates the ﬁlling of micro-pores, because the narrow pore width results in the high adsorption potential. As the activation temperature increases, the uptake at this low P/Po further increases, which suggests more micro-pores are opened up and become accessible for N2 molecules. Simultaneously, the range of the hysteresis loop increases, which suggests that the amount of mesopores in the activated samples also increased. Therefore, the N2 adsorption depends on both the ﬂuid-wall attraction and the N2 and N2 interaction, which lead to the occurrence of multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation. Therefore, the Type IV isotherm is observed in the range P/Po<0.95. However, the isotherms, instead of reaching a plateau, gives another takeoff at the P/Po>0.95 for all of the samples. This takeoff at the high partial pressure range is the characteristics of Type II isotherm, and suggests that the samples also contain the macro-pores (>50 nm). The sharpness of this last step suggests the homogeneity of these macro-pores. When the N2 partial pressure reaches this point (>0.95), the liquid condensation in these pores occurs rapidly, which results in the large change on the slope of the isotherms. However, the isothermal curves of desorption branch for both 200 C and 250 C are rather unusual. Instead of monotonically decreasing in the pore volume as the P/P0 reduce, this value jumps up slightly at a certain P/Po and then monotonically decreases with P/Po. This jumping point shifts toward to higher P/Po as the activation temperature increases. The phenomenon is reproducible. Therefore, this abnormal behavior is not due to the experimental error, rather due to the porous structures of the samples. Our explanation is following: from the above discus- sion, we know that these samples contain pores in different scales. As the activation energy increases to 200 or even 250 C, much more micro-pores are activated, which are conﬁned inside Fig. 1 a) The coordinated bond structure of Zn and TBC ligands (left), Green ¼ Zn, Grey ¼C, Red ¼ O, and Blue ¼ N); b) the channel structures along the a-axis (right).

The more accessible micro-pores are responsible for the largely increased initial value of the pore volume at the P/Po<0.01.Since all of these pores are interconnected in such way that when the adsorption starts, the liquid N2 ﬁlls in the smallest pore ﬁrst, and then the larger pores. On the desorption process, when liquid N2 leaves the sample, it starts from the macro-pores ﬁrst, then the mesopores, and then ﬁnally the micro-pores. If some bottle-neck stages prevent the liquid N2 from vaporization and desorption, the meta-state may be formed, which allow the N2 to remain at the liquid state even the P/P2 below the equilibrium vapor pressure. The molecular structures in Fig. 1 illustrate that the tetrazolyl-rings surround the Channels A and B. The nitrogen in these rings will have some weak interaction with liquid N2 molecules as well, which explains the unusually large hysteresis loop in their isotherms. We spec- ulate that this weak interaction together with the unique porous structure may cause the N2 molecules condensing at an even lower vapor pressure than the pressure of the ordinary capillary condensation condition, which creates a suitable condition to form a metastable stage for the N2 vapor and liquid equilibrium. However, once the P/Po is much lower than the equilibrium vapor pressure, the abnormal amount of liquid N2 in all of the pores are vaporized at once. As a result, the pore volume largely increases at this P/Po to give a jump in their isotherms. Since the more micro-pores are formed and may be better connected with other pores, this jump in the 250 C sample shifts toward the higher P/Po than that in 200 C samples. The Horvath–Kawazoe (HK) method12 is often used for micropore analysis, and the calculated pore size distribution results from desorption branch are illustrated in Fig. 3b. It is found that for samples activated at 50 C, the main pore size of micro-pores (seeFig. 3b) is  6 A, which is apparently repre- senting the size of the open A channels. However, when the activation temperature increases from 100 to 150 C, peaks at6 A, 9 A and 13 A appear and those pore size distributions began to overlap with one other; moreover, further thermal activation of the samples at 200 C cause the 6 A pores to disappear, and only 9 A and 13 A pores are found in the main distribution. When sample are treated at 250 C, all of the pore structures seem to be orderly inter-connected, and posses a broad pore size distribution with a center at 12 A. Correspondingly, with the increase of the activation temperature, the sample’s surface area steadily increases, and more interestingly, the hysteresis loop between adsorption and desorption becomes larger (see Fig. 3a). The sample thermally activated at 250 C shows an almost full range of P/Po from 0–0.9. All of the surface areas, H-K pore size distributions, and hysteretic sorption behaviors indicate there are structural changes occurring during the thermal activations. From the H2O guest molecules intercalated in the as synthesized crystal structure (Fig. 1), we know that the interconnection between ligands and Zn ions in the framework are very rigid, with the exception of phenyl ring rotations, therefore there is no possibility for crystal ﬂexibility, i.e., ‘‘breathing’’, that can occur in the solid state. To understand and explain the N2 isothermal sorption results, we suggest that the water and/or methanol, de-intercalated Frame- work 1 structures that are obtained after thermal activation temperatures > 50 C, still retain the same rigid ligand-metal framework found in the as synthesized crystal structure that contains either or both compounds as guests. When only disor- dered H2O (or MeOH) de-intercalate from the A channels, they open up, which gives the main 6 A peak produced at 50 C for these thermally activated samples. When most of the H2O (or MeOH) molecules are lost due to increasing activation temper- atures, both the A and B channels become interconnected, which produces inter-connected chambers with a maximum cross- section size of 11 A (Fig. 4a). In addition to that, new C channels form, which are located along the 111-direction, with a window cross-section size of 7 A  4 A (Fig. 4b and 4c). During the activation process, mesopores and macro-pores may generate along the C channels. With increases in the thermally activated transport of the coordinated H2O (or MeOH) guests out of the Framework 1 crystal, the more open the C-channels become, and thus, the greater is the propensity for interconnected networks to form between channels A, B and C. Water (or methanol) molecules normally present in the as synthesized crystal can be removed by heat and evacuation to leave behind a framework containing cages and apertures (windows) of molecular dimensions.

Mater. Chem., 2012, 22, 10166–10171 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Downloaded by University of Memphis on 10 October 2012 Published on 16 March 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C2JM15860D structure (see Fig. 4) is quite reasonable and it explains how the net pore structure changes during the thermal activation process. Based on this proposed structure, the accessible channel volume of Framework 1 is further considered in Fig. 5. Accessible volumes along the A channel have conduits approaching the B channel; however, the B channels are still inaccessible to gas molecules. The maximum accessible section of Framework 1 is located at the apertures of the C channel, where the H2O (or MeOH) molecules were initially located. Therefore, for the partially thermally activated sample at 50 C, the A channels more like to be the main location for N2 adsorption. However, some open C channel positions may also exist at this activation temperature. We propose a two-step gas sorption mechanism that happen when the A and C channels become ﬁlled. When most of the C channel apertures are opened up after heating at 100 or150 C, both channels A and most of C channels are accessible to N2 gas. New chambers develop between the A and B channels as shown in Fig. 5a, and those chambers make channels A and C form into zig-zag shapes. The geometry of chambers formed along the merging channels make it easy for N2 molecules to enter Framework 1, but much harder to come out of the framework; hence, a kinetically driven hysteretic sorption–de- sorption loop occurs as the pressure is increased, then decreased, at a given constant temperature. The calculated ﬁrst adsorption sites are located exactly at the sites of the chambers as shown in Fig.5b (the brown spheres represent N2 gas). When C channels are fully opened, all of the chambers are accessible to the gas, and the C channels become the main transport passageway for N2 gas molecules entering and exiting the framework during the pres- sure cycles. This is supported by the H-K pore size distribution analysis, which showed a broad peak centered at 12 A. No hysteresis is observed for the H2 adsorption at liquid N2 or Ar temperatures, which may be due to smaller kinetic diameter and the weaker interactions of the H2 molecule with the pore structures of Framework 1 as compared to N2 (Fig. 6). However, H2 adsorption by Framework 1 did show a high (1.08wt%) uptake of H2 at low pressure up to 600 mm Hg at 77 K, and the heat of adsorption for H2 based on the uptake at 77 K and 84 K data gives a maximum value of 9.2 kJ mol1, where the hydrogen uptake is close to 0 (Fig. 6, inset). Based on the above observations, we performed some simple GC-MS pulse separation tests to examine the gas separation capacity of this material. In those tests, a customized stainless steel column (2.4  152mm) is assembled in front of a J&W DB-WAXetr (30m  0.25mm ID, 1.0 mm ﬁlm thickness) column into the Agilent 6890GC system, and a 100ul air sample is manually injected into the GC system. The outlet samples are analyzed by an Agilent 5975 insert source Mass Spectrometer Detector (MSD). The customized column is packed with 0.2g framework 1 degassed at 200 C. Without any of the columns, no separations between N2/O2 and CO2 are observed. When only the DB-WAXetr column is used, there is a 0.3 min retention time delay of CO2 observed when applying mixture of N2/O2 peak as internal reference. After adding the MOF column in front of the DB-WAXetr column, the CO2 retention time increased from 0.3 min to 1.3 min, but still there is no separation between the N2 and O2 is observed. When the DB-WAXetr column is removed and only MOF column is applied, a retention time of CO2 vs. internal N2/O2 of 0.77 min is observed as shown in the Fig. 7. Therefore, it is clear that when 1 act as stationary phase in the GC column, the increase of the CO2 retention time (using N2 as internal reference) represent the stronger interaction of the MOFs with CO2 vs. N2 or O2. The MOF1 represented a new hysteresis phenomenal in MOFs which has been ignored and not been fully studied. The channel structures become critical in design MOFs for separation studies. The 15cm-long MOF packed column has already had greater peak separation capacity upon CO2 from N2 and O2 than the 30 meters-long coated commercial column in the CO2’s Fig. 4 a) The chamber structure formed between channels A and B in thermally activated samples of Framework 1 at temperatures > 50 C, with the shape of the guest intercalation chamber presented with a blue color (left); b) Channel C viewed along 111 direction.

We can expect the more beneﬁt will come out from the MOF’s GC column studies. Future works of integrations of such MOFs materials as active separation materials within membrane are carrying out in our company. Experimental Materials and general methods All the solvents and reagents for synthesis were commercially available and used as received. H2TBC was synthesized by the reaction of 4-cyanobezacarboxy acid with sodium azide in water or methanol solvents under solvothermal condition at 150 C.FT-IR test showed the absence of the cyano groups (2100 cm1). New peaks at 1400 cm1 suggests the formation of tetrazolate groups13 and strong peaks at 1590–1600 cm1 are consistent with the presence of the carboxylate group. The infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer operating at a spectral resolution of 2 cm1 accumulating 32 scans. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a DuPont Instruments 951 (Ther- mogravimetric Analyzer DTG-50) from room temperature to 600 C with a ramp rate of 10 C min1 in a ﬂowing nitrogen atmosphere. Powder X-ray diffractions (PXRD) were recorded on a Siemens D-500 X-ray diffractometer operating at 45 kV and 35 mA and using Cu-Ka radiation. Gas chromatography (GC) was carried out using an Agilent 6890GC system coupled with an Agilent 5975 insert source Mass Spectrometer Detector (MSD), helium gas with ﬂow rate at 1.2 ml min1. is used as carrier. Injection is chosen in split mode at split ration of 50 : 1. 100ul dry air sample is manually injected into the GC system. The columns are placed in the oven with constant temperature hold at 50 C. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 system. The weight of the samples ranged from 20 to 120 mg. Samples were degassed under vacuum at temperature before measurement. Hydrogen adsorption equilibrium on MOF samples were measured in a Micromeritics ASAP2020 system at liquid nitrogen tempera- ture and liquid Argon temperature adsorption isotherm was measured at 77 K or 84 K and hydrogen pressure ranging from 0 to 600 mmHg. Ultra-high purity hydrogen (99.999%) was introduced into a separate gas inlet of the adsorption unit for the hydrogen adsorption measurements. The adsorption of hydrogen on MOF 1 at different pressures was determined by a volumetric method. The hydrogen heat adsorption is calculated by the program on ASAP2020 system. Crystal structure determinations Data were collected on a Bruker APEX-II CCD diffractometer using the SAINT+ ver. 6.2 software14 with graphite-mono- chromated Mo-K radiation using phi/omega scans. A crystal was mounted on to the diffractometer at low temperature under dinitrogen at ca. 110 K. Crystal stabilities were monitored via recollection of the ﬁrst set of frames. There were no signiﬁcant variations (<  1%). The structures were solved using direct methods and reﬁned with the SHELXTL program package15 and the non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic thermal parameters. Hydrogen atoms were added at idealized positions except for the water molecules in crystal 1, and a riding model was used for subsequent reﬁnement.
