Complex 1 is a 1D → 2D polycatenane derived from the helical channels, whereas both complexes 2 and 3 show 2D layers with the (42.68.8.104)(4)2-2,6L1 topology, which are further entangled to form a 2-fold 2D → 2D interpenetration network and a 2D → 3D inclined polycatenation network, respectively, and complex 4 shows a 3-fold 3D → 3D interpenetration network with the (412⋅63)-pcu topology. The unusual topological features of 5 and 6 consist of 2- and 3-fold interpenetrated layers with the (44⋅62)-sql topology, which are further catenated to the two adjacent such sheets in parallel and uniform fashions to give 2D → 3D polycatenated networks. Complexes 1, 5 and 6 represent a unique example that the angular dicarboxylate ligands show significant effect on the degree of interpenetration of polycatenation coordination networks with interpenetrating modes. The CO2 capture is preferable to N2 and H2 in the gas sorption for the desolvated product of 4. Page 2 of 30 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 25 November 2014.

Many coordination networks reported in the literature are quite fascinating because of the formation of independent motifs entangled in different ways involving interpenetration and polycatenation.2 The formation of the interpenetrated network can be ascribed to the occupation of the voids associated with one framework by one or more independent frameworks and they can be disentangled only by breaking all the internal connections.2a In contrast, the polycatenated network which shows parallel and inclined modes generally contains three discrete rings entangled in a way that they cannot be separated without breaking one of the rings.2b The structural types of coordination networks containing flexible bis-pyridyl-bis-amide ligands are less predictable due to the possible occurrence of supramolecular isomerism involving the adoption of different ligand conformations.3 However, such type of ligands favor the formation of versatile entangled structures for their propensity to form large voids.3 We have shown that for complexes with the N,N′-di(4-pyridyl)adipoamide ligands, those with the auxiliary linear dicarboxylate ligands form the 3D interpenetrated coordination networks, whereas those with the angular dicarboxylate ligands form coordination networks with less dimensionality, involving 1D → 2D polycatenane and 2-fold 2D → 2D parallel interpenetration network containing a rotaxane-like motif.3c,e To explore the influence of increasing the length of the flexible bis-pyridyl-bis-amide ligands on the entanglement of the Page 3 of 30 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 25 November 2014.

Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) measurements were carried on SII Nano Technology Inc. TG/DTA 6200 over the temperature range of 30 to 900 oC at a heating rate of 10 oC min-1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Gas adsorption measurements. The gas adsorption measurements were determined with a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 sorptometer using ultra high purity (UHP) grade gas sources. A sample of 60 - 100 mg was used for sorption measurement. Before analysis, the sample was heated to 423 K with a heating rate of 2 K min-1 and evacuated under a pressure of 10-3 torr for 24 h. The nitrogen isotherms at 77 K were measured in a liquid nitrogen bath over the pressures range from 0 to ca. 730 mmHg, whereas the hydrogen isotherms at 77 K were measured in a liquid nitrogen bath over the pressures range from 0 to ca. 760 mmHg and those of carbon dioxide at 273 or 298 K were measured in a water bath with UHP grade gas source. X-ray crystallography. The diffraction data for complexes 1 – 6 were collected on a Bruker AXS SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer at 22 oC, which was equipped with a graphite-monochromated Mo Kα (λα = 0.71073 Å) radiation.4 Data reduction was carried by standard methods with use of well-established computational procedures.5 The structure factors were obtained after Lorentz and polarization. The positions of some of the heavier atoms, including the cobalt atoms, were located by the direct method. The remaining atoms were found in a series of alternating difference Fourier maps and least-square refinements, while Page 7 of 30 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 25 November 2014.

The high R values for 1 can be ascribed to the weak diffraction intensities of the crystal. Due to serious disorder problems of the co-crystallized solvents of 3, which are presumably DMF and H2O molecules, the SQUEEZE/PLATON technique6 was applied to remove the solvent contribution in the reflection data. The relevant CIF data without the solvent contribution is given as the supplementary materials. Basic information pertaining to crystal parameters and structure refinement is summarized in Table 1. Selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table S1 – Table S6. Results and Discussions Structure of 1 Crystals of 1 conforms to the monoclinic space group P21/c with one Co(II) ion, one L ligand, one MBA2- ligand and two cocrystallized water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Fig. 1(a) shows the coordination environment about Co(II) metal center, which is six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two L ligands [Co-N = 2.071(8)-2.079(8) Å] and four oxygen atoms from two MBA2- ligands [Co-O = 2.026(7) - 2.332(7) Å]. The MBA2- ligand adopts a µ2-κ2,κ2 coordination mode. The Co(II) ions are interlinked by two L and two MBA2- ligands to give 1D infinite helical channels propagating along the b axis, Fig. 1(b), with Co---Co distances of 17.55 (through L) and 14.11 Å (through MBA2-). Moreover, each helical channel is catenated by two others, giving a 1D → 2D polycatenated network with density of catenation (Doc) = 2 and index of separation (Is) = 1, Fig. 1(c).

View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C4CE02101K 9 Crystals of 2 conform to the monoclinic space group P21/c and the asymmetric unit consists of two Co(II) ions, one L ligand, two MBA2- ligands and two lattice methanol molecules. Fig. 2(a) shows the coodination environment about the dinuclear Co(II) metal centers with Co---Co distance of 2.754(6) Å. The Co(II) ions are five-coordinated by four oxygen atoms [Co-O = 2.007(2) - 2.074(2) Å] from four MBA2- ligands and one nitrogen atom [Co-N = 2.054(2)Å] from the L ligand, resulting in square-pyramidal geometries. The MBA2- ligand adopts a µ4-κ1,κ1,κ1,κ1 coordination mode. If the central carbon atoms of the MBA2- ligands are defined as 2-connected nodes and the dinuclear Co(II) unit as 6-connected nodes, the structure of complex 2 can be regarded as a 2,6-connected 2D net with the (42⋅⋅⋅⋅68⋅⋅⋅⋅8⋅⋅⋅⋅104)(4)2-2,6L1 topology, Fig. 2(b), determined using TOPOS.7 The size of the rhombic grid is 8.349 ÅѸ8.390 Å and the length of L linker that connect the looped chains is 25.86 Å, which allows the penetration of another 2D net to form a 2-fold parallelly interpenetrating network, Fig. 2(c). Structure of 3 Crystals of 3 conform to the monoclinic space group C2/c and the asymmetric unit consists of two Co(II) ions, one L ligand and two MBA2- ligands. Fig. 3(a) shows the coodination environment about the dinuclear Co(II) metal centers with Co---Co distance of 2.819(7) Å. Both Co(1) and Co(2) ions are five-coordinated by four oxygen atoms [Co-O = 2.001(2) - 2.189(2) Å] from four MBA2- ligands and one nitrogen atom [Co-N = 2.059(2) Å] from the L ligand, resulting in square-pyramidal geometries. The MBA2- ligand adopts a µ4-κ1,κ1,κ1,κ1 coordination mode. If the central carbon atoms of the MBA2- ligands are defined as 2-connected nodes and the dinuclear Co(II) unit as 6-connected nodes, the structure of complex 3 can be regarded as a 2,6-connected 2D net with the Page 9 of 30 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 25 November 2014.

In marked contrast to the 2-fold parallelly interpenetrating structure of 2, the 2D layers of 3 are interlocked in an inclined fashion, resulting in a 2D → 3D inclined polycatenation network, Fig. 3(c). Structure of 4 Crystals of 4 conform to the monoclinic space group P21/c and the asymmetric unit consists of two Co(II) ions, one L ligand, two OBA2- ligands and seven lattice methanol molecules. Fig. 4(a) shows the coodination environment about the dinuclear Co(II) metal centers with Co---Co distance of 3.156(9) Å. While the Co(1) ion is coordinated by three oxygen atoms from three OBA2- ligands and one nitrogen atom from L ligand, the Co(2) is coordinated by five oxygen atoms from four OBA2- ligands (one chelated and three bridged) and one nitrogen atom from L ligand [Co-O = 1.936(2) - 2.288(2) Å; Co-N = 2.023(2) - 2.116(2) Å], resulting in a distorted tetrahedral geometry and a distorted octahedral geometry, respectively. There are two type coordination modes of OBA2-, µ3-κ1, κ1, κ2 and µ4-κ1, κ1, κ1, κ1. Considering the dinuclear Co2 unit as a 6-connected node, topological analysis reveals that the structure of complex 4 can be regarded as a 3-fold parallelly interpenetrated 3D net with the (412⋅63)-pcu topology, Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c). Structure of 5 Crystals of 5 conform to the monoclinic space group C2/c. The asymmetric unit consists of one Co(II) ion, one L ligand, one hfipbb2- ligand and two lattice water molecules. Fig. 5(a) shows the coordination environment about the Co(II) metal center, which is six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms [Co-N = 2.084(5) - 2.089(5) Å] from two L ligands and four oxygen atoms [Co-O = 2.134(4) - 2.168(4) Å] from two hfipbb2- Page 10 of 30 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 25 November 2014.

View Article Online DOI: 10.1039/C4CE02101K 11 ligands with µ2-κ2,κ2 bonding mode, resulting in a distorted octahedral geometry. The Co(II) ions are interlinked by L and hfipbb2- ligands to give highly undulated 2D nets with the {44·62}-sql topology, Fig. 5(b). Topological analysis reveals that complex 5 form a 2-fold parallely interpenetrated layers, Fig. 5(c), with the size of 14.17Ѹ19.13 Å2 for each grid of the layer. In addition, layers of the 2-fold 2D parallel interpenetration sheets polycatenate with other sql layers in parallel and uniform fashions to form a final 2D → 3D entanglement, Fig. 5(d), with density of catenation (Doc) = 3 and index of separation (Is) = 2. In the resulting array, each single layer is catenated with three others, with one on the same average plane and the other two being above and below the middle one, that is, (1 + 1 + 1) polycatenation. It is noted that similar (1 + 1 + 1) polycatenation of sql layers has been reported for [Ni5(pda)5(bpp)5]⋅12H2O [pda = phenylenediacrylate dianion; bpp = 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane];8 however, layers of the 2-fold interpenetrated sheets of this Ni(II) complex polycatenated with other parallel but offset sql layers, that is, the average planes of the 2-fold interpenetrated layers are in an ABAB fashion, which is in marked to those of 5 that stack parallely and uniformly. Polycatenation of offest 2-fold inerpenetrated sql layers has also been found in [Zn(MFDA)(bpp)] (H2MFDA = 9,9-dimethylfluorene-2,7-dicarboxylic acid)9 and [Cd(bdc)(bipm)] [bipm = bis(4-imidazolphenoxy)methane; H2bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid],10 in which each individual sheet is interpenetrating with five others (1 + 2 + 2). The 2-fold interpenetrated hcb layers of [Ag(L1)(CF3SO3)]⋅0.5H2O [L1 = 1,3,5-tris(4-cyano-phenoxymethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene]11 show (1 + 1 + 1) polycatenation, in which the sets of 2-fold interpenetrated layers Page 11 of 30 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 25 November 2014.

Structure of 6 Crystals of 6 conform to the monoclinic space group P21/n. The asymmetric unit consists of one Co(II) ion, one L ligand, one SDA2- ligand and one lattice water molecule. Fig. 6(a) shows the coordination environment about the Co metal center, which is four-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two L ligands [Co-N = 2.023(4) - 2.045(4) Å] and two oxygen atoms from two SDA2- ligands [Co-O = 1.960(3) Å] with µ2-κ1,κ1 coordination mode, resulting in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The Co(II) cations are interlinked by two L ligands and two SDA2- ligands to give highly undulated 2D layers with the {44·62}-sql topology, Fig. 6(b). Topological analysis reveals that complex 6 form 3-fold parallely interpenetrated layers, with the size of 13.18Ѹ22.53 Å2 for each grid of the layer, Fig. 6(c). Furthermore, the 3-fold interpenetrated layers polycatenate with each other in a parallel fashion to form a 2D → 3D network, Fig. 6(d), with density of catenation (Doc) = 4 (2 + 1 + 1) and index of separation (Is) = 3. In the resulting array, each net is catenated with fours others, with two coplanar and the other two being above and below the middle net. The parallelly and uniformly polycatenated coordination network of 6 that shows (2 + 1 + 1) polycatenation is in marked contrast to those exhibiting 3-fold interpenetration and polycatenation modes that have been reported.

The A and G conformations are given when the C-C-C-C torsion angles are greater and less than 90o, respectively, and based on the relative orientation of the C=O (or N-H) groups, each conformation can adopt cis or trans arrangement.8 These ligand conformations may also differ in the dihedral angle between the two pyridyl rings, i.e. the two rings are coplanar or twisted about the C-N bonds. The various ligand conformations and dihedral angles indicate that the L ligand is sufficiently flexible to adjust to the stereochemical requirements for the formation of the complexes 1 - 6, which adopt the conformation that maximize their intra- and intermolecular forces. Complexes 1 – 3 contain the same metal centers and ligands but show different structures, which can be ascribed the the ratio of Co : L : H2MBA (1 : 1 : 1 for 1 and 2 : 1 : 2 for 2 and 3) and solvent used for the reactions. Complexes 2 and 3 form a pair of pseudo-supramolecular isomers and both show basic units of 2D layers with the Page 13 of 30 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 25 November 2014.

Complexes 1, 5 and 6 represent a unique example that the angular dicarboxylate ligands show significant effect on the degree of interpenetration of polycatenation coordination networks with interpenetrating modes, resulting in polycatenation from single net to 2- and 3-fold interpenetrated nets, respectively. The different degree of interpenetration can be ascribed to the different Co---Co distances that are separated by the L ligands, which are 17.55, 19.13 and 22.53 Å, for complexes 1, 5 and 6, respectively. The different Co---Co distances are due to the different C-X-C angles and different dihedral angles between the two phenyl rings of the dicarboxylate ligands, resulting from the different bridging atom/group of the angular dicarboxylate ligands. The highly undulating nature of the sql layers is also responsible for the different degree of interpenetration. Thermal properties In order to estimate the stability of the frameworks, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out for complexes 1 – 4 and 6. The TGA results, Fig. S1, show that the weight losses that are due to the removal of cocrystallized solvent molecules occurred in 30 – 200 oC, and the organic ligands decomposed at temperatures above 290 oC. The different structural types of these complexes do not affect the decomposition of the organic ligands significantly. The PXRD patterns of complexes 1 – 6 heated at 150 oC for 3 hours, Fig. S2 – Fig. S7, reveal that the frameworks Page 14 of 30 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 25 November 2014.

Gas Sorption Properties of 4 The solvent-accessible volumes of complexes 1 - 6 calculated by PLATON12 are 443.2, 296.3, 1460.2, 1840.5, 368.3 and 0 Å3, which are 12.4, 12.3, 26.2, 33.0, 5.2 and 0 % of each of the unit cell volumes, respectively. From these results, we may conclude that combination of both interpenetration and polycatenation modes (complexes 5 and 6) in a coordination network largely decreases the solvent-accessible volume. Since complex 4 shows the largest solvent-accessible volume, the gas sorption experiments of its desolvated product, 4’, were thus carried out to investigate its pore structure and gas storage capability, Fig. S8(a). The nitrogen isotherms shows the H3 type hysteresis loop that is characteristic of aggregates of plate like particles giving rise to slit-shapes pores,14 and gives a Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface area of 8.19 m2/g and a Langmuir surface area of 17.10 m2/g. The maximum CO2 adsorptions are 1.087 and 0.723 mmol/g at 273 and 298 K, respectively, at 760 mmHg and the H2 isotherms of adsorption shows a 0.12 % hydrogen uptake at 760 mmHg. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation implemented in the software of the Micrometrics ASAP 2020 sorptometer was employed to calculate the isosteric heats (Qst) of CO2 adsorption at 273 and 298 K. The Qst against loading amount is illustrated in Fig. S8(b), which exhibits a highest value of 32.17 kJ/mol near zero CO2 coverage and decreases drastically with increasing the CO2 loading amounts. Although further studies are needed to clarify the differences in adsorption among H2, N2 and CO2, the present results suggest that CO2 sorption is more accessible than N2 and H2 sorptions for 4’ that contains the L ligands with amide groups.15 Page 15 of 30 CrystEngComm CrystEngComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 25 November 2014.

The different structures in 1 – 3 indicate that the ratio of the reagents and the nature of the solvents play important roles in determining the structural diversity, resulting in a 1D → 2D polycatenane derived from the helical channels, 2-fold interpenetrated 2D layers and a 2D → 3D inclined polycatenation framework, respectively, in which complexes 2 and 3 can be regarded as a pair pseudo-supramolecular isomers. Complexes 1, 5 and 6 represent a unique example that the angular dicarboxylate ligands show significant effect on the degree of interpenetration of polycatenation coordination networks with interpenetrating modes. The desolvated product of 4 shows preferable CO2 capture to N2 and H2 is in the gas sorption, indicating that entangled coordination networks containing flexible bis-pyridyl-bis-amide ligands may show potential application in the selective CO2 capture.
