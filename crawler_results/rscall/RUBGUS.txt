These compounds show a variety of guest inclu- sion properties and interesting self-induced chirality. Compound 1 adopts 1D zigzag chains with mononu- clear units that are mutually paired into a 1D ladder-like structure. Compound 2 consists of trinuclear clus- ters, and displays a 2D protuberant sheet with a (4,4)-sql topology. Compound 3 takes the form of a 1D double-stranded chain with rectangular loops comprised of trinuclear clusters, in which the Hdtdn−ligands dangle on both sides. Compound 4 adopts the form of a 2D network and exhibits a slightly undulating (44) topology that consists of trinuclear clusters, which are further hydrogen bonded into a 3D framework. Compound 5 features a 3D network consisting of 1D infinite metal oxide wires containing the ĳMn2Ĳdtdn)2- ĲH2O)2] unit. Magnetic studies of compounds 2, 3, and 5 show that they have antiferromagnetic properties. Introduction Coordination polymers (CPs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years, not only for the aesthetics of their crystal architectures,1 but also due to their potential applica- tions, ranging from magnetism and luminescence to nonlinear optics and gas storage.2–4 Crystal engineering still confronts great challenges in the preparation of CPs containing multi-nuclear clusters with different shapes and topologies, because the assembly of such CPs might be trig- gered by more than one factor.5 Currently, considerable efforts are being expended toward taking advantage of the enhanced structural diversity imparted by carboxylate- containing ligands in combination with N-donor species, which act as effective auxiliary ligands and/or exhibit structure-directing effects, in order to construct new metal– organic compounds with polynuclear metal clusters.6–8 It is well known that disulfide-based compounds bearing a flexible –S–S– motif can display one of the most intriguing post- translational modifications and play a critical role in the fold- ing structures of proteins.9,10 In general, the disulfide group is susceptible to scission via in situ cleavage of both S–S and S–C bonds,11 and in situ exchange, which is a source of reduced or oxidized disulfide bond moieties and represents an important process in biological systems and in situ metal- mediated reactions.12 In addition, disulfide-based ligands show axial chirality with M and P enantiomeric forms (Chart 1), which provides an opportunity to produce some interesting metal complexes.13 Therefore, the preparation of metal–organic materials with variable disulfide ensembles for CrystEngComm, 2015, 17, 2847–2856 | 2847 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015 a Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei 106, Taiwan.

This work is noteworthy for several reasons: (i) the disulfide ensembles in the Mn-based CPs show versatile coordination modes that exhibit structurally biomimetic characteristics; (ii) a suitable impetus from the ancillary N-donor coligands directs the formation of the target coordination polymers comprised of mononuclear or trinuclear clusters and metal oxide wires; (iii) the sub-perturbations trigger an intrinsic axial chirality of the disulfide motifs in these intriguing CPs; and (iv) the magnetic behaviors of 2, 3, and 5 were examined and correlated with their distinct multinuclear nodes. The focus of this work was on combining the freely twisted disul- fide derivatives and different N-donor coligands to assemble the target CPs with diverse structures.16 To the best of our knowledge, such self-assembled CPs containing disulfide derivatives with carboxylate moieties are currently rare.16,17 Experimental section General remarks All reagents were purchased commercially and were used as received without further purification.

Crystal structure determination Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected using a Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer, equipped with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The structures were solved using direct methods. The hydrogen atoms of the ligands were placed in calculated positions with isotropic thermal parame- ters and were included in the structure factor calculations in the final stage of full-matrix least-squares refinement. All cal- culations were performed using the SHELX-97 program pack- ages.18 The hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms were assigned by geometrical calculation and refined as a riding model. The hydrogen atoms attached to oxygen atoms were located from the difference Fourier maps. Because the crystal structure of compound 4 contains many disordered guest molecules that cannot be modelled or refined well, the “SQUEEZE” tool was used to take the scattering of disordered solvent into account.19 Crystal data and structure refinement data for compounds 1–5 are summarized in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. Results and discussion Structure of {[Mn2Ĳdtdn)2Ĳ4,4′-dmbpy)2ĲH2O)2]ĴDMF}n (1) A single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that com- pound 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcn and has a 1D chain structure. The MnĲII) ion is coordinated to one chelated 4,4′-dmbpy, two carboxylates of two distinct dtdn2−ligands, and one coordinated water molecule in a distorted octahedral fashion (Fig. 1a). Two MnĲII) centers are bridged by a dtdn2−ligand employing an η2-carboxylate (O2, O1) and an η1-carboxylate (O4) group (Fig. S1 in ESI†). It is interesting that, owing to the intrinsic pseudo chirality of the dtdn2−ligand, it can exhibit either the P- or M-conformation, resulting in the formation of a zig-zag polymeric chain (Fig. S2 in ESI†). Furthermore, two zigzag chains, bearing P- and M-conformations, are paired together via hydrogen bonding interactions, leading to the formation of a 1D ladder-like structure (Fig. 1b and Fig. S3 in ESI†). The Mn–O bond dis- tances fall in the range of 2.32–2.12 Å. One chelated 4,4′- dmbpy (N3, N4) is coordinated to the MnĲII) center (the aver- age Mn–N bond distances are 2.24 Å). The dtdn2−ligand dis- plays the type b coordination mode (Chart 2 and Fig. S4 in ESI†). The ladder-like structures were mutually connected via π–π stacking interactions from the pyridyl rings and stacked into a 2D sheet (Fig. 1c and Fig. S5 in ESI†). This 2D network features unique rectangular spaces with a window size of 7.52 × 12.29 Å2, occupied by one guest DMF molecule which is disordered about a twofold axis. Structure of {[Mn6Ĳdtdn)6Ĳ5,5′-dmbpy)4]Ĵ5DMFĴ2H2O}n (2) The asymmetric unit of compound 2 contains three MnĲII) ions, three dtdn2−ligands, two 5,5′-dmbpy ligands, and one guest DMF molecule (Fig. 2a and Fig. S6 in ESI†). As shown in Fig. S6,† the Mn1 atom is coordinated by three dtdn2− ligands (O3, O8, O1, O2) and two N atoms from a 5,5′-dmbpy ligand in a MnO4N2 form. The Mn2 atom is surrounded by six different carboxylate groups, and the coordination envi- ronment of the Mn3 atom is almost the same as that of the Mn1 atom. Three MnĲII) ions are bridged by six dtdn2− ligands to form a trinuclear cluster unit that is formed via two μ2,η2-carboxylates (O2) and four μ2,η1-carboxylates (O3, O4, O7, O8). The separation distances between Mn ions are 3.55 and 3.57 Å (Fig. S7 in ESI†). It is noteworthy that four dtdn2−ligands have flexible characteristics and can exhibit either the P- or the M-form; as a result, they are paired to link the adjacent clusters. However, the other two dtdn2−ligands are present only in the M-form, leading to the formation of a 2D protuberant chiral sheet (Fig. 2b). The dtdn2−ligand dis- plays coordination modes of types f and i (Chart 2 and Fig. S9 in ESI†). Finally, these adjacent 2D layers are regularly packed into a 3D framework (Fig. S10 in ESI†) via π–π stack- ing interactions (two pyridyl groups of two dtdn2−ligands are separated by 3.58 and 3.65 Å). Furthermore, the trinuclear unit can be regarded as a 4-connected node; thus it is further propagated into a 2D protuberant chiral sheet with a (4,4)-sql topology (Fig. S11 in ESI†). In the 3D structure, there are 1D CrystEngComm Paper Published on 03 March 2015. Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA on 10/04/2015 08:54:01.

Structure of {[Mn3Ĳdtdn)2ĲHdtdn)2Ĳphen)2]ĴH2O}n (3) Compound 3 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1¯ and is comprised of a trinuclear ĳMn3Ĳdtdn)2ĲHdtdn)2Ĳphen)2] cluster unit. There are two crystallographically independent Mn atoms (Fig. 3a and Fig. S12 in ESI†). The Mn1 atom is located at both sides of the trinuclear cluster and is coordi- nated by one η2-carboxylate (O1, O2), two μ2,η2-carboxylate groups (O3, O5), and one phen ligand (N5, N6) in a distorted octahedral geometry. The central Mn2 atom is on an inver- sion center and is coordinated in a MnO6 manner by six dtdn2−ligands (O2, O4, and O6). The three MnĲII) atoms are bridged by four μ2,η1-carboxylate groups and two μ2,η2-car- boxylate groups, and the Mn1⋯Mn2 separation distance is 3.42(1) Å (Fig. S13 in ESI†). When four bridging dtdn2− ligands are employed to link two adjacent trinuclear clusters, a 1D double-stranded rod comprised of rectangular loops is formed. In addition, there are two terminal carboxylate motifs from two Hdtdn−ligands in the trinuclear cluster that do not participate in coordination (highlighted in pale blue in Fig. 3a); thus, they dangle on both sides of the 1D rod-like structure (Fig. 3b). The dtdn2− ligand exhibits the P-conformation and its coordination mode is type f, whereas the Hdtdn−ligand shows the P-conformation and the type a coordination mode (Fig. S15 in ESI†). In addition, these rods are stacked in an AAA manner (Fig. S16 in ESI†), leading to the formation of a 2D sheet via π–π interactions. The distance between pyridyl rings is 3.73(1) Å and the distance between phen rings is 3.75(1) Å (Fig. S16 and S17 in ESI†). The win- dow size of each loop is 14.68(1) × 12.58(1) Å2, in which one guest water molecule is incorporated (Fig. S18 in ESI†). It is noteworthy that the phen coligand is located on both sides of the trinuclear cluster. When the extension of the network is blocked, only a 1D double-stranded rod is formed. Structure of {[Mn6Ĳdtdn)6ĲH2O)4ĲDMF)4]Ĵ10DMFĴ10H2O}n (4) Compound 4 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1¯ and has a 2D framework (Fig. 4). The asymmetric unit contains two similar trinuclear clusters with ĳMn3Ĳdtdn)3ĲH2O)2- ĲDMF)2] units (Mn1–Mn2–Mn1, Mn3–Mn4–Mn3) and three DMF molecules. The Mn2 and Mn4 atoms lie on inversion centres and the Mn1⋯Mn2 and Mn3⋯Mn4 separation dis- tances are 3.65(1) and 3.60(1) Å, respectively (Fig. S20 in ESI†). In addition, the coordinated DMF and water molecules (O13, O14, O23, O16) are located on both sides of the trinuclear clusters (Mn1 and Mn3). The intrinsic steric hin- drance from the coordinated DMF molecules, which are located on both terminal coordination sides of each cluster, affects the conformations of the dtdn2−ligands, resulting in the formation of a 1D horizontal zig-zag chain with an M-form (Fig. S21 in ESI†). Two neighbouring chains are linked via vertical dtdn2−ligands and adopt P- and M-forms that are paired together, leading to the formation of an undu- lating 2D network (Fig. 4b). The dtdn2−ligands display coor- dination types i and f, and the torsion angles of the former are 104.6° and 104.9°, whereas those of the latter are 103.2° and 105.8° (Fig. S22 in ESI†). The π–π stacking interactions between adjacent pyridyl units of the dtdn2−ligands are Table 1 Summary of crystal data and structure refinements for compounds 1–5 Compound 1 2 3 4 5 Empirical formula C51H47Mn2N9O11S4 C150H162Mn6N30O38S12 C72H44Mn3N12O17S8 C114H162Mn6N26O52S12 C28H34Mn2N4O15S4 Formula weight 1200.10 3707.46 1770.49 3443.06 904.71 Crystal system Orthorhombic Monoclinic Triclinic Triclinic Monoclinic Space group Pbcn P21 P1¯ P1¯ C2/c a (Å) 17.9446(5) 11.8071(2) 12.1946(7) 13.498(14) 22.739(5) b (Å) 11.1704(3) 29.765(4) 12.5819(9) 15.220(16) 16.038(3) c (Å) 27.2280(8) 13.1818(2) 14.6838(9) 20.51(2) 9.7046(19) α (deg.) 90 90 72.430(4) 90.775(13) 90 β (deg.) 90 110.456(2) 69.157(4) 97.172(18) 94.00(3) γ (deg.) 90 90 62.887(4) 111.158Ĳ13) 90 V (Å3) 5457.8(3) 4340.4(9) 1847.5(2) 3891(7) 3530.5(12) Z 4 1 1 1 4 T (K) 200(2) 200(2) 200(2) 200(2) 153(2) λ (Å) 0.71073 0.71073 0.71073 0.71073 0.71073 Dcalc (g cm−3) 1.461 1.418 1.591 1.469 1.702 μ (mm−1) 0.683 0.649 0.810 0.723 1.028 F000 2472 1918 899 1786 1856 GOF 1.057 1.064 1.026 0.912 1.030 R1 a (I > 2σ (I)) 0.0272 0.0576 0.0563 0.0880 0.0401 wR2 b (I > 2σ (I)) 0.0646 0.1490 0.1435 0.1794 0.0930 R1 a (all data) 0.0331 0.0848 0.1123 0.2078 0.0503 wR2 b (all data) 0.0682 0.1760 0.1966 0.1978 0.0990 Flack parameter 0.50(2) a R1ĲF) = P‖Fo| −|Fc‖/P|Fo|. b wR2ĲF2) = ĳPwĲFo 2 −Fc 2)2/PwĲFo 2)2]1/2.

Structure of {[Mn2Ĳdtdn)2ĲH2O)2]Ĵ4MeOHĴH2O}n (5) Compound 5 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c and has a 3D framework structure. The asymmetric unit con- sists of two MnII centers, two bridging dtdn2−ligands, two coordinated water molecules, four disordered guest methanol molecules and two guest water molecules (Fig. 5a and Fig. S25 in ESI†). The Mn1 atom is on an inversion centre and is bound to six carboxylate oxygen atoms from distinct bridging dtdn2−ligands. The Mn2 atom lies on a twofold axis and is bound to four carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2, O3) from four dtdn2−ligands and two coordinated water molecules (O5). The two non-equivalent Mn atoms adopt a distorted MnO6 octahedral geometry. The Mn atoms are bridged by three car- boxylate motifs from dtdn2−ligands in the μ2,η1- and μ2,η2- manners, leading to the formation of a 1D polymeric MnĲII)- oxide chain, in which the Mn1⋯Mn2 separation distance is 3.64(1) Å (Fig. S26 in ESI†). All of the Mn–O distances are in the range between 2.11 and 2.25 Å. It should be noted that each dtdn2−ligand bridges five MnĲII) centers, displaying the type j connecting mode (Fig. S28 in ESI†). The guest metha- nol and water molecules are encapsulated within the voids (Fig. S30 in ESI†). In addition, compound 5 has a large void volume of 28.9% (1123.6 Å3/3891.0 Å3). Effective strategy for the syntheses of 1–5 As shown in Scheme 1, compounds 1–5 were synthesized by reacting MnĲNO3)2Ĵ6H2O with the H2dtdn ligand at 50 °C. Comparing the five complexes, the flexible dtdn2−ligand exhibits multiple coordination modes, which facilitates the formation of the prospective secondary building units (SBUs). Thus, these SBUs could be sequentially assembled into the target structures containing multiple-connected chiral net- works linked via bridging dtdn2−ligands.16 In addition, the Table 2 Selected bond lengths (Å) and angles (°) for 1–5a 1 SĲ1)–SĲ2) 2.0296(7) MnĲ1)–NĲ3) 2.245(2) MnĲ1)–NĲ4) 2.229(2) OĲ4)#2–MnĲ1)–OĲ5) 87.88(5) MnĲ1)–OĲ1) 2.320(2) MnĲ1)–OĲ5) 2.148(1) OĲ5)–MnĲ1)–OĲ1) 88.27(5) OĲ2)–MnĲ1)–NĲ4) 95.66(5) MnĲ1)–OĲ2) 2.253(1) OĲ4)#2–MnĲ1)–NĲ4) 90.78(5) OĲ5)–MnĲ1)–NĲ4) 118.87(5) OĲ4)#2–MnĲ1)–NĲ3) 159.86(5) OĲ5)–MnĲ1)–NĲ3) 89.13(5) NĲ4)–MnĲ1)–NĲ3) 73.31(5) OĲ4)#2–MnĲ1)–OĲ2) 96.11(5) OĲ5)–MnĲ1)–OĲ2) 145.25(5) NĲ4)–MnĲ1)–OĲ2) 95.66(5) NĲ3)–MnĲ1)–OĲ2) 97.66(5) NĲ4)–MnĲ1)–OĲ1) 148.87(5) NĲ3)–MnĲ1)–OĲ2) 97.66(5) 2 SĲ1)–SĲ2) 2.019(3) MnĲ2)–OĲ9) 2.192(4) MnĲ3)–OĲ6A) 2.062(6) OĲ7A)#3–MnĲ2)–OĲ11)#1 88.7(6) MnĲ1)–OĲ1) 2.243(5) MnĲ2)–OĲ4)#1 2.175(4) MnĲ3)–OĲ12)#1 2.095(5) OĲ11)#1–MnĲ2)–OĲ2) 86.5(2) MnĲ1)–OĲ2) 2.307(4) MnĲ2)–OĲ5A) 2.20(1) MnĲ3)–OĲ10) 2.250(5) OĲ6A)–MnĲ3)–OĲ10) 155.5(6) MnĲ1)–NĲ7) 2.258(6) MnĲ2)–OĲ7A)#3 2.17(2) MnĲ3)–NĲ9) 2.216(6) OĲ4)#3–MnĲ2)–OĲ9) 87.2(2) MnĲ1)#1–OĲ3) 2.100(5) MnĲ2)–OĲ11)#1 2.175(4) MnĲ3)–NĲ10) 2.248(6) OĲ6A)–MnĲ3)–NĲ9) 101.8(3) MnĲ1)–NĲ8) 2.200(6) NĲ8)–MnĲ1)–NĲ7) 72.9(2) NĲ8)–MnĲ1)–OĲ2) 147.8(2) NĲ9)–MnĲ3)–NĲ10) 73.7(2) 3 SĲ1)–SĲ2) 2.032(2) MnĲ2)–OĲ6) 2.133(4) NĲ6)–MnĲ1)–NĲ5) 74.4(2) OĲ3)#3–MnĲ1)–NĲ5) 172.6 (2) MnĲ1)–NĲ5) 2.256(4) MnĲ2)–OĲ2) 2.184(4) OĲ5)–MnĲ1)–NĲ5) 87.7(2) OĲ5)–MnĲ1)–NĲ6) 97.0(2) MnĲ1)–OĲ2) 2.215(4) MnĲ2)–OĲ4)#1 2.168(4) NĲ5)–MnĲ1)–OĲ1) 89.1(2) OĲ6)–MnĲ2)–OĲ4)#3 87.1(2) MnĲ1)–NĲ6) 2.228(5) OĲ5)–MnĲ1)–OĲ2) 117.4(2) OĲ2)–MnĲ1)–NĲ6) 172.6(2) OĲ6)–MnĲ2)–OĲ2)#2 97.3(2) MnĲ1)–OĲ1) 2.447(4) OĲ2)–MnĲ1)–NĲ6) 140.0(2) OĲ3)#1–MnĲ1)–NĲ5) 95.5(2) OĲ6)#2–MnĲ2)–OĲ2)#2 82.7(2) MnĲ1)–OĲ3)#1 2.081(4) NĲ6)–MnĲ1)–OĲ1) 88.2(2) OĲ2)–MnĲ1)–OĲ1) 56.2(1) OĲ4)#1–MnĲ2)–OĲ2)#2 89.4(2) 4 SĲ1)–SĲ2) 2.035(4) MnĲ2)–OĲ6) 2.219(8) MnĲ4)–OĲ10) 2.131(7) OĲ1)–MnĲ2)–OĲ6) 84.7(3) SĲ3)–SĲ4) 2.064(5) MnĲ2)–OĲ1) 2.137(7) MnĲ4)–OĲ11)#1 2.141(7) OĲ9)–MnĲ3)–OĲ12)#1 96.0(3) SĲ5)–SĲ6) 2.040(4) MnĲ3)–OĲ3) 2.283(6) OĲ6)–MnĲ1)–OĲ16) 86.9(4) OĲ9)–MnĲ3)–OĲ14) 86.4(3) MnĲ1)–OĲ2) 2.147(7) MnĲ3)–OĲ9) 2.107(6) OĲ2)–MnĲ1)–OĲ5) 162.4(3) OĲ9)–MnĲ3)–OĲ15) 106.2(3) MnĲ1)–OĲ5) 2.385(8) MnĲ3)–OĲ4) 2.325(7) OĲ7)#1–MnĲ1)–OĲ5) 88.1(3) OĲ15)–MnĲ3)–OĲ14) 89.7(4) MnĲ1)–OĲ13) 2.160(6) MnĲ3)–OĲ15) 2.168(8) OĲ2)–MnĲ1)–OĲ6) 106.1(3) OĲ10)–MnĲ4)–OĲ3) 87.9(3) MnĲ1)–OĲ7)#1 2.136(7) MnĲ4)–OĲ3) 2.235(7) OĲ13)–MnĲ1)–OĲ6) 150.0(3) OĲ11)#1–MnĲ4)–OĲ3) 92.9(2) 5 SĲ3)–SĲ4) 2.023(1) MnĲ2)–OĲ5) 2.202(2) OĲ1)#1–MnĲ1)–OĲ3)#4 93.61(7) OĲ2)#6–MnĲ2)–OĲ2) 159.8(1) MnĲ1)–OĲ1) 2.107(2) MnĲ2)–OĲ3)#3 2.193(2) OĲ1)–MnĲ1)–OĲ4)#2 91.47(7) OĲ2)#6–MnĲ2)–OĲ3)#5 93.83(8) MnĲ1)–OĲ4)#2 2.199(2) MnĲ2)–OĲ2) 2.125(2) OĲ2)–MnĲ2)–OĲ3)#2 93.83(9) OĲ2)–MnĲ2)–OĲ5)#6 79.08(9) MnĲ1)–OĲ3)#4 2.245(2) OĲ1)#1–MnĲ1)–OĲ4)#2 88.53(7) OĲ2)–MnĲ2)–OĲ5) 87.8(1) OĲ3)#2–MnĲ2)–OĲ5)#6 88.86(9) a Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms, for 1: #2 x, −y + 1, z −1/2; for 2: #1 x −1, y, z −1; #3 −x + 1, y + 1/2, −z + 1; for 3: #1 x + 1, y −1; #2 −x + 2, −y, −z; #3 −x + 1, −y + 1, −z; for 4: #1 x −1, y, z; for 5: #2 −x + 3/2, −y + 1/2, −z + 2; #3 x + 1/2, y −1/2, z; #4 −x + 3/2, y −1/2, −z + 3/2; #5 x + 1/2, −y + 1/2, z + 1/2; #6 −x + 2, y, −z + 5/2.

Furthermore, compounds 4 and 5 were prepared in the presence of an azpy species, a pyridyl derivative that could function as an organic base and/or tem- plate. It should be noted that compounds 4 and 5 were syn- thesized under similar conditions, except that different sol- vent systems (DMF/MeOH and MeOH/H2O) were used, and the solvents played a vital role in the assembly of the coordi- nation polymers. In particular, we examined several alterna- tive routes in the absence of azpy, but none were successful in the construction of structures 4 and 5. The approach based on a combination of the disulfide derivative, H2dtdn, and related rigid N-donor ligands has enabled the assembly of CPs with diverse structures containing mononuclear or trinuclear clusters and infinite metal oxide wires. To the best of our knowledge, the use of the disulfide-based ligand, H2dtdn, and the accompanying related coligands with differ- ent steric hindrance, which react under mild conditions, to tune the target structures has never been documented to date.16 It is noteworthy that the 1D ladder-like structure of 1 con- sists of several zigzag chains, and the dtdn2−ligands adopt P- and M-conformations. Among the six dtdn2−ligands in the trinuclear clusters in 2, four dtdn2−ligands exhibit P- and M-forms that are paired to link the adjacent clusters, whereas the other two dtdn2−ligands are present only in the M-form, Fig. 1 Structure of 1: (a) coordination environments of the MnĲII) centers; (b) a pair of zigzag chains packed into a 1D ladder-like struc- ture viewed along the b axis; (c) the ladders stacked into a 2D network in space-filling mode; (d) DMF molecules filling the cavities.

Compound 3 takes the form of a 1D double-stranded rod with dangling Hdtdn−ligands, and employs four bridging dtdn2−ligands in the P-form to link adjacent trinuclear clusters. The Hdtdn− ligands also exhibit the P-form. The 2D undulated network of 4 consists of a 1D horizontal zig-zag chain in the M-form, while the vertical dtdn2−ligands adopt P- and M-forms that are paired together. Thus, these SBUs could sequentially assemble into the target structures containing multiple- connected chiral networks linked via bridging dtdn2− ligands.15 Furthermore, the structures of compounds 1–5 are a good example of the intrinsic twisted characteristics of such disulfide ensembles, and resemble the unique folded struc- tures in cysteine peptides and protein substrates. Thermogravimetric analyses and PXRD measurements The results of thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of 1–5 are shown in Fig. 6. For compound 1, a weight loss of 13.2% (cal- culated as 14.3%) in the range of 80–200 °C was observed, which can be attributed to the loss of one coordinated water molecule and one guest DMF molecule. The TGA profiles of complexes 2 and 3 indicate that the guest DMF and water molecules are removed at temperatures below 150 °C, and no further significant weight losses occur until the temperature reaches 332 and 313.5 °C, respectively, indicating their high thermal stability. The results for 4 indicate that the coordi- nated and guest water and DMF molecules are easily lost and that the complex gradually decomposes on increasing the temperature. Whereas for 5, the weight loss of 14.2% Fig. 3 (a) Coordination environments of MnĲII) centers in 3.

Powder X-ray dif- fraction (PXRD) patterns were used to check the purity of compounds 1–5 (Fig. S36–S40 in ESI†). The results show that all of the peaks in the patterns for the as-synthesized com- pounds at room temperature are completely consistent with the simulated patterns. Magnetic studies of compounds 2, 3, and 5 Magnetic susceptibility data for powder samples of 2, 3, and 5 were collected in the temperature range of 2–300 K (Fig. 7). For compounds 2 and 3, the corresponding χMT values are 13.244 and 15.984 cm3 K mol−1 at 300 K, respectively. These values are higher than the spin-only value of 13.125 cm3 K mol−1. The magnetic susceptibility data of 2 were fitted to give the Curie constant C = 14.41 cm3 K mol−1 and the Weiss constant θ = −27.6 K (Fig. S41 in ESI†). The Hamiltonian for a linear trimer is described as follows: H = −2J1ĴĲS1 × S2 + S1 × S3) −2J2ĴĲS2 × S3); J1 and J2 are the magnetic exchange inte- grals between the neighbouring and outer MnĲII) centers, respectively. Since the shortest distance between the Mn3 units is more than 12 Å, and π–π stacking interactions are present between the pyridyl rings of these chains (3.8 Å), the interchain interactions (zJ′) are included in the expression: χM ic = χM/(1 −zJ′χM/Ng2μB 2). The results from the best fit give the following values: g = 2.04, 2J1 = −3.4 cm−1, 2J2 = 0.25 cm−1, zJ′ = −0.02 cm−1, and R = 3.8 × 10−6, where the agree- ment factor (R) is defined as PĲχM calcd −χM obs)2/PĲχM obs)2. The data for 3 were fitted according to the Curie–Weiss Law, giving the Curie constant C = 17.34 cm3 K mol−1 and θ = −32.8 K (Fig. S42, ESI†). In addition, using the same equation as that used for 2 resulted in the following data for 3: g = 2.12, 2J1 = −2.8 cm−1, 2J2 = 1.3 cm−1, zJ′ = −0.06 cm−1, and R = 9.1 × 10−5. Despite the fact that 2 and 3 have different infinite structures, both consist of Mn3 cores furnished with dtdn2− ligands, which are assembled into a 2D network in 2 and a 1D double-stranded rod in 3. The observed magnetic behav- ior is due to a combination of Mn⋯Mn couplings within the Mn3 units and weak interchain interactions. The magnetic data for 5 were fitted to the Curie–Weiss Law and the Hamiltonian (H = −2J1 PSi × Sj) with consider- ation of Weiss constant to account for interlayer interactions for a 1D chain to give C = 5.10 cm3 K mol−1, θ = −33.19 K (Fig. S43 in ESI†), and g = 2.07, 2J1 = −2.6 cm−1, θ = 1.0 K, R = 5.1 × 10−4, respectively. In contrast to 2 and 3, no saturation at 7 Tesla is observed for 5. The 1.8 K value of 1.01 Nβ at 7 Tesla indicates residual magnetic moments within the Mn chain. The results suggest that the spins are arranged in an anti-parallel fashion, resulting in a singlet spin ground state (Fig. S44 in ESI†). Fig. 6 The TGA profiles of compounds 1–5.

The suitable impetus from the ancillary N-donor coligands, possessing subtle chelating effects and/or steric hindrance, can be utilized to tune the target structures to form mononuclear or trinuclear clusters and infinite metal oxide wires. Employing such a synthesis strategy under mild reaction conditions designed to retain the disulfide ensem- bles offers an effective route to the construction of new metal–organic frameworks with self-triggered chirality and multiple metal clusters. These variable disulfide ensembles in CPs are astonishing and may provide unusual insight for exploring their biomimetic behavior.
