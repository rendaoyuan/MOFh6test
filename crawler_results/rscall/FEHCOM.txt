High-quality MAF-X8 thin films were grown on stainless steel fibers for solid-phase microextraction (SPME), which showed high sensitivity and selectivity to non-polar volatile organic compounds. 10 Introduction Porous coordination polymers (PCPs) or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated prominent properties in gas storage, separation, heterogeneous catalysis,1 and other applications,2 mainly in the bulk form. In order to utilize their 15 special properties more efficiently, devices based on PCP thin films have attracted intense attention recently.3 Inspiringly, a few PCPs have been found to be useful in analytical technologies such as solid-phase microextraction (SPME).4 As a highly effective sample pretreatment and enrichment technology,5 20 SPME has been widely used in environment, biology, clinical medicine, food industry, etc.6 Nevertheless, due to the lack of mature adsorption materials, so far commercial and custom-made SPME fibers still face problems of low sensitivity and selectivity, poor stability, and/or poor anti-interference ability. For example, 25 conventional adsorbent materials can hardly show high non- polar/polar selectivity for size-similar molecules (e.g., non-polar and polar benzene derivatives), because polar molecules can interact stronger with adsorbents. The first PCP coated SPME device has been fabricated by Yan 30 et al. using microporous Cu(II) trimesate (HKUST-1), which showed large enrichment and low limits of detection for benzene homologues. However, owing to the poor water stability of HKUST-1, the extraction efficiency of this device is very low while working at environment with relative humidity over 30%.4 35 It has been demonstrated that metal azolate frameworks (MAFs) constructed by imidazolate or pyrazolate derivatives can usually show very high thermal and chemical stability.7 Recently, SPME MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinorganic and Synthetic Chemistry, State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, P.

See DOI: 10.1039/b000000x/ devices based on highly water-stable Zn(II) 2-methylimidazolate (MAF-4)8 and benzimidazolate (MAF-3)9 were reported by Yan 40 et al.10 Due to the very small aperture size, MAF-4 (3.4 Å) show superior selectivity for n-alkanes over branched alkanes, but requires relatively long extraction time (ca. 20 min). With even smaller aperture size, MAF-3 (2.9 Å) can adsorb neither n-alkane nor branched alkane. At the same extraction conditions, benzene 45 homologues can be only adsorbed on the outer surfaces of both MAF-4 and MAF-3.10 These examples highlight the importance of both ligand functionality and pore size of PCPs for SPME applications. Considering that generally carboxylate ligands can facilitate pore size modulation while azolate ligands can enhance 50 framework stability, rational combination of these coordination groups may be a simple strategy for constructing new PCPs suitable for SPME applications. Here, we report the synthesis, structure, film fabrication, and SPME application of a highly porous and stable Zn(II) pyrazolate-carboxylate framework 55 showing excellent sensitivity and selectivity for non-polar benzene homologues. Results and discussion Synthesis and structure 60 Solvothermal reaction of 4-(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (H2mpba) and Zn(NO3)2 yielded crystals of a porous metal azolate framework [Zn(mpba)]·guest (MAF-X8). Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis (Table S1 and Fig. S1) showed that MAF-X8 is a three-dimensional (3D), quasi-tetragonal, pillared- 65 column, porous framework (void = 50%) constructed by tetrahedral Zn2+ and exo-tetradentate mpba2– (Fig. 1a). There are large 1D channels with widest and narrowest cross section area of 8.8×8.8 Å2 and 6.7×6.7 Å2, respectively, running along the crystallographic a-axis (Fig. 1b). The methyl groups of the ligand 70 play an important role in the pore structure of MAF-X8, which not only reduce the channel size and make the ligand noncoplanar to change the channel shape, but also almost entirely block the Page 1 of 7 Chemical Science Chemical Science Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by Duke University on 01 October 2012 Published on 27 September 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C2SC21181E View Online 2 | Journal Name, [year], [vol], 00–00 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry [year] Zn2+ ions and partially block the carboxylate O atoms to increase the pore-surface hydrophobicity (Fig. 1c). It is worth pointing out that the non-stoichiometrically adsorbed mesitylene guest molecules are quite ordered in the crystal structure, indicating very good size matching between the channels of MAF-X8 and 5 aromatic molecules (Fig. S2). Similar coordination and framework structures have been reported for Zn(II) and Co(II) 1,4-benzenedipyrazolates, which display straight, square channels with uniform cross section area of 10×10 Å2,11 because the ligand is longer and planar. 10 Fig. 1 (a) 3D quasi-tetragonal pillared-column framework structure of MAF-X8 viewed along the a-axis (Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity). (b) Perspective view of pore surface of MAF-X8. (c) Side view of the Zn-carboxylate chain in space- 15 filling mode (methyl groups are highlighted in orange). Framework stability and sorptive properties Thermogravimetric analysis and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies of MAF-X8 showed that guest molecules can be 20 removed below 220 oC and the host framework was stable up to 450 oC (Fig. S3 and S4). The single-crystal structure of guest-free MAF-X8 was measured to confirm that the framework is rigid and not distorted after complete removal of guests. The N2 sorption isotherm of MAF-X8 measured at 77 K shows the type-I 25 characteristic with saturation uptake of 306 cm3/g (Fig. S5), corresponding to a pore volume of 0.47 cm3/g, which is slightly lower than the theoretical value of 0.52 cm3/g as calculated from the crystal structure of MAF-X8. Fitting the isotherm gave a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1161 m2/g and a 30 Langmuir surface area of 1306 m2/g. As monitored by PXRD patterns, guest-free MAF-X8 can be stable for 5 hours in saturated water vapor. Prolonged exposure caused some slight changes in peak position and decrease of peak intensity, but the original highly crystalline phase could be 35 recovered by direct heating the sample to 250 oC or exposure to methanol vapor at room temperature (Fig. S6). This behavior suggests that water molecules do not destroy the chemical bonds but just induce some reversible changes in the lattice conformation of the host framework. 40 Fabrication of SPME fibers To investigate the potential SPME applications, we fabricated MAF-X8 thin films on the surface of stainless steel fibers by an in-situ hydrothermal growth method (see experimental section in 45 ESI). Scanning electron micrographs showed that the stainless steel fibers were coated by dense and quite regular MAF-X8 crystals (Fig. 2). The coating thickness was approximately 30 μm, being suitable for SPME. PXRD pattern of the thin film confirmed that the crystals mostly grow along the a-axis with 50 highly exposed (100) facets (Fig. 3), which will favor the adsorption and desorption of the guests. It should be noted that, highly oriented crystalline thin films have attracted intense attention,12 while the crystallites (HKUST-1, MAF-3, and MAF-4) were randomly oriented in known PCP-coated SPME fibers.4, 10 55 Fig. 2 Scanning electron micrographs of MAF-X8 crystals grown on stainless steel fibers. 5 10 15 20 25 30 (006) (060) (040) (004) (202) (220) (112) (022) (002) (020) (110) Intesity 2θ [o] (101) simulated bulk film Fig. 3 Comparison of the PXRD patterns of thin film and bulk 60 microcrystals of MAF-X8.

Similarly, 2- chlorophenol, p-cresol, 2-nitrophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol are also severely controlled air or water pollutants.15 These phenol derivatives are used as standard polar 5 analytes (referred to as Phenols). In practical applications, BTEX and Phenols generally coexist, which can bring competitive adsorption on the SPME fibers, then reduce the sensitivity of the analysis. Moreover, the molecular sizes of these BTEX and Phenols are very similar, which make these compounds difficult 10 to be separated. In our research, the analytes were extracted from the headspace of the sample matrix, which is generally believed to be able to reduce the interference from the hardly volatile substances.16 A saturated water solution of NaCl (relative 15 humidity 75%) was used as the solvent. The extraction time needed for SPME fibers is a crucial parameter for quantitative analysis.4,5 The extraction time should be equal to or longer than the shortest time required for reaching the sorption equilibrium. The adsorption kinetics of the MAF-X8 coated SPME fibers were 20 tested by 200 ng/mL BTEX, in which the chromatographic peak area was plotted against the trial extraction time. The result showed that the four analytes rapidly reached adsorption equilibrium in ca. 7 min (Fig. S7). The extraction time of reported fibers, coated by such as organic modified silica,17 carbon 25 nanotube,18 PCP4 and polymer19 are mostly longer than 15 min. The faster adsorption kinetics of MAF-X8 may due to the highly regular and large channel of the structure as well as the ordered and suitable crystal directions in the SPME thin films. To obtain both high efficiency and good reproducibility, we chose 8.0 min 30 as the operating extraction time. Similary, the required desorption time is also a crucial parameter of SPME fibers. If the desorption is not complete, it will affect the correctness and sensitivity of analysis. On the other hand, long desorption time not only reduces efficiency but also lead to short life of the fiber (high 35 temperature thermal desorption). In the conventional gas chromatography conditions, complete desorption of BTEX from MAF-X8 film was very fast within 0.5 min. But to avoid the carryover effect, we chose 2.0 min as desorption time for further experiments. 40 To investigate the analytical figures of merit for our new SPME devices, the linear range, limits of detection (LODs), repeatability and the reproducibility were determined under the optimized conditions for BTEX analysis (Table S2). First of all, the MAF-X8 fiber exhibited wide linearity with 3 orders of 45 magnitude for BTEX with good correlation coefficients (R2 > 0.9976). And it also has very low LODs, i.e. 0.006-0.060 μg/L for the BTEX compounds. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of repeatability for six replicated extractions of standard solutions was lower than 4.1%, and the RSD for fiber-to-fiber 50 reproducibility obtained with three ﬁbers fabricated under the same conditions was below 8.0%. Furthermore, no decrease of extraction performance can be observed even after more than 120 replicated extractions, indicating the high stability of MAF-X8 and its thin films. Coexistence of such high thermal stability, 55 short extraction time and very low LODs has been rarely observed for reported coating materials (Table S3 and Fig. S8). 0 20 40 60 80 100 o-xylene ethylbenzene toluene Normalized Extraction Efficiency [%] MAF-X8 PDMS/DVB PDMS benzene Fig. 4 Comparison of the normalized extraction efficiencies of MAF-X8 coated fiber and commercial SPME fibers for BTEX. 60 The error bar shows the standard deviation of the mean. We compared the extraction efficiency of the MAF-X8 coated fiber with commercial PDMS/DVB (65 μm) and PDMS (100 μm) fibers (PDMS = polydimethylsiloxane, DVB = divinylbenzene), 65 which have been proven to be the most efficient for enrichment of middle-polar and non/less-polar compounds, respectively. Generally, the PDMS/DVB fiber with porous structure shows better performance than the PDMS fiber. In view of the different thickness of the coatings, we compared the performances of 70 MAF-X8 and commercial fibers by calculating the normalized adsorptive capacity per unit coating volume (normalized to the maximum chromatographic peak area), which is refer as “normalized extraction efficiency” hereafter. As presented in Fig. 4, MAF-X8 showed an excellent enrichment for the single BTEX 75 compounds. The relative extraction efficiency of MAF-X8 fiber is 18 to 157 times higher than the PDMS fiber, or 2 to 8 times that of PDMS/DVB fiber. Such excellent performance of MAF- X8 fiber may result from the large specific surface area and the relatively hydrophobic pore surface of the material. 80 It is universally acknowledged that selectivity of sorbent is another vital factor for SPME, because the real sample matrix may contain numerous kinds of pollutants, sometimes even the impurities are much more than the target analytes. To further investigate the selectivity and the anti-interference ability of the 85 MAF-X8 fiber, mixed BTEX/Phenols standards were used as analytes, which are more similar to the real samples. Interestingly, even when the BTEX/Phenols ratio was increased to 1:5, the extraction efficiencies for BTEX compounds were not reduced, despite there was a slightly increase in the adsorbed amount of 90 Phenols (Fig. 5), which indicated good anti-interference ability of the MAF-X8 fiber. To be contrast, the commercial PDMS/DVB fiber showed gradually increased adsorption for Phenols and obvious decrease in the extracted amounts of BTEX compounds when the concentration of Phenols was increased. As expected, 95 the PDMS fiber has a poorer selectivity at the same conditions with a rapidly increased adsorption of Phenols. Doubtlessly, the BTEX enrichment of MAF-X8 relative to the commercial fibers will be higher than that showed in Fig. 4 when a large proportion of Phenols exist (Fig. S9). 100 Page 3 of 7 Chemical Science Chemical Science Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by Duke University on 01 October 2012 Published on 27 September 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C2SC21181E View Online 4 | Journal Name, [year], [vol], 00–00 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry [year] 0 20 40 60 80 100 2,4,6-trichlorophenol 2-nitrophenol 2,4-dichlorophenol p-cresol 2-chlorophenol o-xylene ethylbenzene toluene Normalized Extraction Efficiency [%] c(BTEX):c(Phenols)=1:0 c(BTEX):c(Phenols)=1:1 c(BTEX):c(Phenols)=1:5 benzene MAF-X8 (a) 0 20 40 60 80 100 (b) Normalized Extraction Efficiency [%] c(BTEX):c(Phenols)=1:0 c(BTEX):c(Phenols)=1:1 c(BTEX):c(Phenols)=1:5 PDMS/DVB 2,4,6-trichlorophenol 2-nitrophenol 2,4-dichlorophenol p-cresol 2-chlorophenol o-xylene ethylbenzene toluene benzene 0 20 40 60 80 100 (c) PDMS Normalized Extraction Efficiency [%] c(BTEX):c(Phenols)=1:0 c(BTEX):c(Phenols)=1:1 c(BTEX):c(Phenols)=1:5 2,4,6-trichlorophenol 2-nitrophenol 2,4-dichlorophenol p-cresol 2-chlorophenol o-xylene ethylbenzene toluene benzene Fig. 5 Normalized Extraction efficiencies for single BTEX and BTEX/Phenols mixtures at different mixed ratios.

Mechanism of selectivity 10 Because the molecular sizes of BTEX and Phenols are both smaller than the pore size of MAF-X8, the high selectivity of BETX over Phenols is not likely based on the size exclusive effect commonly observed for molecular sieves. To elucidate the mechanism of selective extraction, we used thermogravimetric 15 analysis to examine the sorption property of MAF-X8 powder sample toward saturated vapors of representative nonpolar (toluene) and polar (2-chlorophenol) compounds. After long-time exposure, both toluene and 2-chlorophenol can be adsorbed in large amounts (Fig. S10). For rigid adsorbents, the theoretical 20 saturation/maximum guest uptakes can be empirically calculated from the crystallographic pore volume of adsorbent and density of adsorbate. Generally, the observed saturation/maximum uptakes are slightly lower than the theoretical ones due to the size/shape incompatibility between the pore and the guest 25 molecule, especially when their sizes are similar (such as for MAF-X8 and BTEX/Phenols). More accurate theoretical saturation/maximum adsorption amounts can be obtained by molecular simulation methods (see ESI). As shown in Table S5, the observed toluene and mesitylene uptakes are consistent well 30 with the molecular simulation results and slightly lower than the empirical results. The observed maxium uptake of 2-chlorophenol is larger than both the molecular simulation and empirical values, revealing that 2-chlorophenol not only can readily enter and occupy the 1D channels, but also significantly adsorbed on the 35 outer crystal surface of MAF-X8. 10 100 1000 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Uptake [wt%] Time [min] toluene 2-chlorophenol Fig. 6 Adsorption kinetics of saturated toluene and 2- chlorophenol vapors on microcrystalline MAF-X8 (molecular simulation suggested saturation uptakes 33.0% and 46.0% for 40 toluene and 2-chlorophenol, respectively). While thermodynamic difference cannot account for the mechanism of selectivity, we further studied the adsorption kinetics of toluene and 2-chlorophenol. The adsorption of toluene 45 can rapidly reach saturation/equilibrium within 8 min, which was consistent with the extraction time of the SPME fiber. On the contrary, the adsorption of 2-chlorophenol can not reach saturation even after 4000 min, and the adsorption amounts can be almost neglected in the first 15 minutes, being consistent with 50 the excellent selectivity of MAF-X8 (Fig. 6 and Fig. S10). Considering that the vapor pressure of 2-chlorophenol in headspace SPME experiment was much lower than the saturation vapor pressure, the adsorption of 2-chlorophenol might be slower and even virtually absent in the headspace SPME experiments. 55 Page 4 of 7 Chemical Science Chemical Science Accepted Manuscript Downloaded by Duke University on 01 October 2012 Published on 27 September 2012 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C2SC21181E View Online This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry [year] Journal Name, [year], [vol], 00–00 | 5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 -40 -36 -32 -28 -24 -20 14.63 kcal/mol E [kcal/mol] Fractional coordinate toluene 2-chlorophenol 4.03 kcal/mol (a) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 -26 -24 -22 -20 -18 E [kcal/mol] Fractional coordinate toluene 2-chlorophenol 5.36 kcal/mol 1.49 kcal/mol (b) Fig. 7 Potential profiles and diffusion barriers of guest molecules passing through the 1D channels of (a) MAF-X8 and (b) Zn(II) 1,4-benzenedipyrazolate. 5 To further explain the different adsorption kinetics, the host- guest interactions were investigated by computer modelling (see ESI). The molecular mechanics simulated diffusion barrier of 2- chlorophenol in the channel is much higher than that of toluene, 10 probably due to the relatively small channel size of MAF-X8 and the dipole-dipole interaction between 2-chlorophenol and the partially exposed carboxylate O atoms. For comparison, we also performed the same simulation for the isostructural Zn(II) 1,4- benzenedipyrazolate,11a which showed very small diffusion 15 barriers for both 2-chlorophenol and toluene due to its large pore size and inert pore surface (without carboxylate oxygen atoms) (Fig. 7). Moreover, the periodic density functional theory results showed that 2-chlorophenol forms a strong O−H···O hydrogen bond (O···O 2.68 Å, O−H···O 165o, binding energy -15.88 20 kcal/mol) with the uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen on the crystal surface, which blocks the entrance of the 1D channel. In contrast, toluene prefers entering channel (binding energy -6.14 kcal/mol) rather than staying at the channel entrance (Fig. 8). The different binding behaviors of guest molecules on the outer 25 crystal surface of MAF-X8 are also consistent with the normal toluene uptake and underestimated 2-chlorophenol uptake (Fig. 6). Fig. 8 Perspective view of the optimized (periodic density functional theory) structures of 2-chlorophenol and toluene on the 30 outer crystal surface of MAF-X8 (two structures are projected along the channel direction and superpositioned for comparison). Conclusions In summary, a highly stable PCP has been synthesized using a 35 bifunctional pyrazolate-carboxylate ligand, which can be facilely fabricated as high-performance SPME devices showing rather short extraction and desorption time, high enrichment factors and low detection limits for non-polar, toxic, environment-unfriendly benzene homologues even in the presence of large proportion of 40 polar interferents with similar molecular sizes. This work demonstrated that PCPs might be rationally designed to serve as promising adsorbent materials for specific SPME applications.

All commercially available reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification. The SPME manual holder and commercial fibers (100 μm PDMS and 65 μm PDMS/DVB) were obtained from Supelco. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were obtained by a Vario EL elemental analyzer. All the Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data was recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray powder diffractometer (Cu Kα). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a TGA Q50 instrument. Each sample was heated from room temperature to 700 oC at a rate of 5.0 °C/min under N2 atmosphere. Measurements of N2 sorption isotherms were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020M instrument. Before gas sorption experiments, the as-synthesized samples were placed in a quartz tube and dried under high vacuum at 180 oC for 10 h to remove the remnant solvent molecules. Syntheses of MAF-X8 Single crystals: A mixture of H2mpba (0.022 g, 0.1 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.030 g, 0.1 mmol), DMA (0.1 mL), EtOH (2.5 mL), H2O (2.5 mL), and mesitylene (1.0 mL) was sealed in a 10-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container and kept at 120 °C for 3 days, followed by being cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 oC·h-1. Colorless prismatic crystals [Zn(mpba)]·0.76C9H12 were obtained (ca. 0.027 g, 54% yield based on Zn). EA calcd (%) for Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Science This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 S5 [Zn(mpba)]·0.76C9H12 (C18.87H19.16N2O2Zn): C 61.03, H 5.20, N 7.54. Found: C 61.23, H 5.302, N 7.26. Bulk microcrystalline powder: A mixture of H2mpba (0.5 mmol, 0.108 g), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol, 0.150 g), DMA (3.0 mL), and MeOH (9.0 mL) was sealed in a 15-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container and kept at 120 °C for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, washed by DMA and MeOH for several times, white powders were obtained (0.157 g, 62% yield based on Zn). Guest-free samples were obtained by heating the bulk sample at 200 oC for 30 min at N2 atmosphere. EA calcd (%) for [Zn(mpba)] (C12H10N2O2Zn): C 51.55, H 3.60, N 10.02. Found: C 51.26, H 3.58, N 9.97. SPME fibers: Firstly, the stainless steel wires (d = 0.120 mm, l = 5 cm) were washed by acetone to remove the exterior organic impurity. Then, one end of the stainless steel wire (about 3 cm length) was immersed in aqua regia for 15 min in order to generate a fresh, rough surface. Afterwards, the etched stainless steel wire was washed by ultrapure water until pH = 7 and dried in desiccator at room temperature. A 1:1 mixture of H2mpba (0.1 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 mmol) in DMA (1.5 mL) and MeOH (4.5 mL) was sealed in a 10-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container and kept at 120 °C for 1 days. After cooling to room temperature, the MAF-X8 coated fiber was washed gently with methanol, and heated at 250 °C in the GC injection port for 20 min to remove guests from the films. The thickness of the MAF-X8 films was measured by SEM. SPME procedures All SPME fibers were pretreated in the GC injection port at 250 oC under nitrogen flow for 15 min before use. All the appropriate standard solutions were prepared by diluting the BTEX or Phenols stock solution (1 mg/mL) with saturated sodium chloride solution. A glass vial (40 mL), the sample container, with a magnetic bar inside was placed on a stirring platform with a stirring rate of 1500 rpm. Then the needle of the SPME fiber was penetrated the septum of the vial and the coated fiber was exposed to the standard sample vapor for a Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Science This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 S6 period of time at room temperature. After extraction, the fiber was subsequently inserted into the GC injector for desorption and analysis. GC-MS analysis GC-MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett–Packard 6890N gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) equipped with a MSD 5975 mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) and a split/splitless injector. Chromatographic separation was carried out with a HP-5MS 5% phenyl-/95% methylsiloxane capillary (30 m×250 μm, 0.25 μm). In all measurements, the constant flow rate of helium carrier gas was kept at 1.2 mL/min and the injector temperature was 250 oC with splitless. The initial oven temperature was 70 oC, and then increased to 140 oC at a rate of 10 oC/min. The total run time was 12 min. X-ray single-crystal structure analyses. Diffraction data were collected using a Bruker Apex CCD area-detector diffractometer (Mo-Kα). Absorption corrections were applied by using the multi-scan program SADABS.S2 The structures were solved by direct methods and refined with the full-matrix least-squares method on F2 by the SHELXTL crystallographic software package.S3 The structures are all pseudo merohedral twin crystals. Hydrogen atoms were placed geometrically. All non-hydrogen atoms of the host frameworks were refined anisotropically. The guest mesitylene molecules were slightly disordered, and their occupancies were obtained from refinement. Crystal data and details of data collection and refinements of the compounds were listed in table S1. CCDC 892987 and 892988 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Science This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 S7 Computational details All calculations were performed in the MS modeling 5.0 package.S4 The saturation/maximum uptakes of mesitylene, toluene and 2-chlorophenol were simulated at 298 K using the GCMC (Grand Canonical Monte Carlo) method. The fixed pressure task and Metropolis method in Sorption program and the universal forcefield (UFF) were adopted. The simulation box representing MAF-X8 contains 8 (2 × 2 × 2) unit cells while the framework and all the guest molecules were considered to be rigid. Partial charges were produced the same as MM modeling mentioned above. The cutoff radius was chosen as 12.8 Å for the LJ interactions, and the long-range electrostatic interactions were handled using the Ewald & Group summation method. For each state point, 5.0 × 106 equilibration steps were used, followed by 5.0 × 106 production steps for computing the ensemble averages. To further explain the different adsorption kinetics, we calculated the diffusion barriers of guest molecules passing through the 1D channels. Corresponding with the TGA (Fig. S10), 2-chlorophenol and toluene were used as probe molecules in the modeling. Firstly, we used the Sorption module, Locate task and Metropolis method to identify the relatively favored sorption location of the probe molecules, then taken it as a starting point and let the probe molecules pass through the framework channel along the channel direction step by step. For every step, geometry optimization was taken by the Forcite module to obtain the total energy and then calculated the interaction energy between probe molecule and framework by the following equation: Einteraction = Etotal – Eframewok – Eprobe (eq-1) Where Etotal is the total energy of the framework and probe molecule, while Eframewok and Eprobe denote the energies of the framework and probe molecule respectively. So, we can draw an energy curve and the difference between the maximum and minimum energy referred to as the diffusion barrier (Fig. 8). Partial charges for atoms of the framework and the probe molecules were derived from QEq method and QEq neutral 1.0 parameter. All parameters for atoms of MAF-X8 and probe molecules were modeled with the universal force field (UFF) embedded in the MS modeling 5.0. The optimization step was performed Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Science This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 S8 with a cutoff radius of 18.5 Å, and a smart algorithm was applied. For the sake of making a comparison, we performed a similar modeling for the reported structure Zn(BDP) (BDP = 1,4-benzenedipyrazolates). In order to simulate the host-guest interaction on the crystal surface, we cleaved a (100) surface of MAF-X8 with a 10 Å vacuum slab placed upon it and a probe molecule was placed on the surface. This structural model was then energy-minimized maintaining fixed the atomic coordinates of the surface. As the molecular mechanics (MM) is hard to accurately simulate the hydrogen bond, the interactions between probe molecules and the crystal surface were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) through the Dmol3 module. The widely used generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and the double numerical plus polarization (DNP) basis set as well as the effective core potential (ECP) were used. The binding energy was calculated similar to equation eq-1.
