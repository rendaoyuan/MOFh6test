MOF 1 shows an interesting three-dimensional (3D) (3,4,4,4)-connected KAVGAQ framework with a Schla¨fli symbol of {63}2{64?102}{64?82}2, which can be extended by 2D layers and bpy pillars. MOFs 2 and 3 also display 3D framework structures, corresponding to a 6-connected {44?611} net and a (6,12)-connected {312?430?520?64}{36?48?5} net, respectively. Moreover, a novel coordination mode of H3TDA is observed in 3. The luminescence properties of 1–3 are investigated. Introduction The self-assembly of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) based on multidentate organic ligands and metal ions is of great interest for material chemists in recent years, due to not only their enormous variety of impressive structural topologies,1 but also their significant potential applications as functional materials in the areas of gas storage and separation,2 magnetic materials,3 luminescence and/or chemical sensors4 and so on. Although studies on the design and synthesis of MOFs have been very prosperous, many attempts have been made to prepare functionalized crystalline materials with highly-con- nected nodes with the aid of crystal engineering. On the other hand, the selection of appropriate multi- functional ligands in the design and synthesis of MOFs is a key step. 1H-1,2,3-triazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (H3TDA), with one triazolate group and two carboxylate groups, is a versatile multi-chelating ligand, which can provide abundant coordina- tion modes and generate various interesting structures and functional properties.5,6 For instance, we have reported a 2D stair-like transition-metal coordination polymer {[Mn3(TDA)2(H2O)6]?6H2O}n,5a which displays antiferromag- netic behavior. The group lead by Chen has also reported two MnII coordination polymers {[Mn3(TDA)2(H2O)2(NH3)2]}n and {[Mn3(TDA)2(H2O)4]}n,6b which exhibit spin-competing behavior as well as unusual multi-step magnetization jumps. There are also many examples of coordination polymers based on 1H-1,2,3-triazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid, however, most of these MOFs are MnII-based crystalline materials with various magnetic properties.6a–d The investigations on ZnII and CdII MOFs assembled by 1H-1,2,3-triazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid as luminescent materials are still limited.6e,f Herein, in this contribution, three new 3D d10-metal-ion- based MOFs, formulated as {[Zn3(TDA)2(bpy)3]?(bpy)?10.5H2O}n (1), {[Zn3(TDA)2(azopy)2.5(H2O)]?4H2O}n (2) and {[Cd2K3(TDA) (HTDA)2(H2O)4]}n (3), have been successfully prepared from the KH2TDA ligand in the presence of three different length- controllable auxiliary ligands, respectively. MOFs 1–3 are characterized by infrared spectra, elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In 1, ZnII ions are connected by TDA32 to generate 2D layers, which are further bridged by bpy pillars to build a 3D KAVGAQ framework. In 2, three ZnII ions are connected by TDA32 to generate [Zn3(TDA)2] SBUs, which can be extended to a 1D wave-like infinite chain. Such 1D wave-like chains are further bridged by azopy to build a 3D framework. In 3, two CdII ions and three KI ions are bridged by two TDA32 and four HTDA22 to form pentanuclear [Cd2K3(TDA)2(HTDA)4] aDepartment of Chemistry, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, P. R. China.

X-ray crystallography Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements of 1–3 were recorded on an Oxford Supernova diffractometer with graphite monochromatic Mo–Ka radiation (l = 0.71073 Å). The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full- matrix least-squares techniques on F2 using the SHELXS-97 and SHELXS-97 programs.8 Anisotropic thermal parameters were assigned to all non-hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms were placed in idealized positions and located in the difference Fourier map. The disordered water molecules in 1 and 2 were subjected to geometric restraints during the refinements. The formulas were identified by combining the single-crystal structure, the element analysis and the thermo- gravimetric analysis (Fig. S1, ESI3). The crystallographic data of 1–3 have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC 909598–909600). The crystallographic data for 1–3 are listed in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table S1, ESI.3 Results and discussion Syntheses of 1–3 Solvothermal reactions of ZnII with KH2TDA and bpy/azopy in water lead to the formation of 1 and 2, respectively, while the reaction of CdII with KH2TDA and HTZ in a 1 : 1 mixture of water and ethanol, in the presence of one drop of NH3?H2O, affords the framework of 3. ICP measurement of 3 reveals the coexistence of CdII ions and KI ions with a ratio of ca. 2 : 3, in agreement with the ratio calculated from the single crystal structure. In 3, HTZ coordinates neither CdII ions nor KI ions. The pH before the reaction is ca. 6, while after the reaction, the pH is ca. 7 and the crystals of 3 could not be obtained in the absence of HTZ, indicating that HTZ might serve as a structure-directing agent and/or weak base to slightly adjust the pH value. The guest molecules and phase purities of MOFs 1–3 are confirmed by TGA (Fig. S1, ESI3) and XRPD (Fig. S2–S4, ESI3). Description of the crystal structures of 1–3 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 crystal- lizes in the triclinic space group P1¯ (Table 1). The structural unit consists of three crystallographically independent ZnII ions, two TDA32, three bpy ligands, one uncoordinated bpy and ten and a half lattice water molecules (Fig. 1a). Zn1 adopts a slightly distorted octahedral {ZnO4N2} coordination geome- try with four oxygen atoms (O1, O3, O1A and O3A) from two individual TDA32 ligands and two nitrogen atoms (N6 and N6A) from two bpy ligands. The bond lengths of Zn1–O are in the range of 2.090(3)–2.112(3) Å and those of Zn1–N are 2.149(3) Å. Zn2 and Zn3 display similar coordination environ- ments and adopt a distorted octahedral {ZnO2N4} coordination geometry with two oxygen atoms (O2 and O2A for Zn2, O4 and O4A for Zn3) and two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N1A for Zn2, N3 and N3A for Zn3) from two TDA32 ligands and two nitrogen This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 CrystEngComm, 2013, 15, 2682–2687 | 2683 CrystEngComm Paper Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on 16/04/2013 03:57:25.

The bond lengths of Zn2–N are in the range of 2.058(4)–2.219(4) Å and those of Zn2–O are 2.136(3) Å, while the bond lengths of Zn3–N are in the range of 2.081(4)– 2.178(4) Å and those of Zn3–O are 2.129(3) Å. Each TDA32 connects three ZnII ions (Scheme 1A) to generate a 2D layer (Fig. 1b), which consists of 24-membered hexagonal rings (Fig. 1c). The 2D layers are further bridged by bpy pillars to build a 3D framework (Fig. 1d and S6a–S6d, ESI3). The 3D framework shows 1D hexagonal channels along the [100] direction with dimensions of ca. 11.9 Å 6 12.5 Å (defined as the distance between Zn1 and Zn1, Zn2 and Zn2), which are occupied by water and bpy molecules. PLATON9 analysis reveals that the framework of 1 is composed of voids of 542 Å3, which represents 40% per unit cell volume with the removal of water and bpy molecules. To get a better insight into the 3D simplified topological framework of 1, the topological struc- ture of 1 can be achieved by the application of topology analysis via the freely available computer program TOPOS.10 If the TDA32 ligands are viewed as 3-connected nodes and the ZnII ions can be viewed as 4-connected nodes with bpy ligands as bridging spacers, the structure can be described as a (3,4,4,4)-connected net with a Schla¨fli symbol of {63}2{64?102}{64?82}2 (Fig. 1e), which corresponds to KAVGAQ topology that is unique for 3D MOFs.11 Such KAVGAQ topology can also be observed in coordination polymers based on imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate ligands.11,12 It can be viewed as the central points of the edges of hcb layers (Fig. S6e, ESI3) connected by pillars. Therefore, 1 represents the first example of KAVGAQ topology assembled by potassium 1H-1,2,3- triazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid.

Zn1 adopts a slightly distorted octahedral {ZnO3N3} coordination geometry with two oxygen atoms (O4 and O5) and two nitrogen atoms (N3 and N4) from two TDA32 ligands, one nitrogen atom (N7) from one bpy ligand and one oxygen atom (O9) from one water. The bond lengths of Zn1–O and Zn1–N are in the range of 2.107(5)– 2.130(5) Å and 2.107(6)–2.172(6) Å, respectively. Zn2 is coordinated by three oxygen atoms (O1, O2A and O3A) and one nitrogen atom (N1) from two TDA32 ligands and two nitrogen atoms (N12A and N16A) from two azopy ligands to form an octahedral {ZnO3N3} coordination geometry. The bond lengths of Zn2–O and Zn2–N are in the range of 2.052(5)– 2.126(5) Å and 2.138(6)–2.207(7) Å, respectively. The coordina- tion environment of Zn3 is similar to that of Zn2, with three oxygen atoms (O6A, O7A and O8) and one nitrogen atom (N6) from two TDA32 ligands and two nitrogen atoms (N9 and N13) from two azopy ligands to form an octahedral {ZnO3N3} coordination geometry. The bond lengths of Zn3–O and Zn3–N are in the range of 2.048(5)–2.110(5) Å and 2.155(6)–2.213(6) Å, respectively. Each TDA32 connects three ZnII ions (Scheme 1A) to generate a [Zn3(TDA)2] SBU. Such [Zn3(TDA)2] SBUs are alternatively arranged and connected to each other to form one-dimensional wave-like chains (Fig. 2b). The 1D wave-like chains are further bridged by azopy to build a 3D framework (Fig. 2c and S7, ESI3). The 3D framework shows two different sized-channels along the [001] direction, which are occupied by water molecules. PLATON analysis reveals that the frame- work of 2 is composed of voids of 1409 Å3, which represents 17% per unit cell volume with the removal of water molecules. Topologically, if the [Zn3(TDA)2] SBUs are viewed as 6-con- nected nodes then the structure can be described as an uninodal net with a Schla¨fli symbol of {44?611} (Fig. 2d). Though some 6-connected uninodal nets have been widely described,1,13 and among these 6-connected uninodal nets, the most symmetrical and important examples are a-Po, acs, NiAs and {44?610?8}. This 6-connected uninodal net displayed by 2 has not been discovered as far as we know. 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2/n, which consists of two CdII ions, three KI ions, one TDA32, two HTDA22 ligands and four coordinated water molecules (Fig. 3a). Each Cd1 ion is coordinated by one oxygen atom (O1) and two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2A) from two HTDA22, one oxygen atom (O5) and one nitrogen atom (N4) from one TDA32 and one oxygen atom (O7) from one water molecule to form an octahedral {CdO3N3} geometry. The bond lengths of Cd1–O and Cd1–N are in the range of 2.243(5)–2.498(4) Å and 2.260(4)–2.314(5) Å, respectively. K1 adopts a {KN2O5} coordi- nation geometry with two oxygen atoms (O6 and O6A) and one nitrogen atom (N5A) from two TDA32, one oxygen atom (O4A) and one nitrogen atom (N3A) from one HTDA22 and two oxygen atoms (O8 and O9) from two water molecules, whereas the coordination geometry around K2 is a six-coordinated octahedral geometry with two oxygen atoms (O3A and O3B) from two HTDA22, two oxygen atoms (O5 and O5A) from two TDA32 and two oxygen atoms (O7A and O7B) from the water molecules. The bond lengths of K–O and K–N are in the range of 2.754(5)–2.989(6) Å and 3.102(5)–3.106(5) Å, respectively. Interestingly, the TDA32 and HTDA22 adopt different coordi- nation modes. Each TDA32 ligand coordinates two CdII ions and six KI ions through the nitrogen atoms of the triazolate group and the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate groups (Scheme 1B). The coordination mode of TDA32 in 3 has not been observed in other coordination polymers based on 1H-1,2,3-triazole-4,5-dicarboxylate,5,6 where each HTDA22 ligand coordinates two CdII ions and two KI ions (Scheme 1C). Therefore, a pentanuclear [Cd2K3(TDA)2(HTDA)4] SBU forms (Fig. 3b). In addition, the adjacent TDA32 and HTDA22 ligands are interconnected by octahedral {CdO3N3} units, leading to an infinite 1D zigzag chain (Fig. 3c), which can be linked by KI cations resulting in a 3D framework (Fig. 3d and S8, ESI3). Topologically, if the tetranuclear [Cd2K12(TDA)2(HTDA)4] SBUs are viewed as 12- connected nodes and the K2 ion center has six tetranuclear [Cd2K12(TDA)2(HTDA)4] units as the nearest metal center, they Fig. 2 (a) The coordination environments of ZnII in 2 (thermal ellipsoids are drawn at a 30% probability level); (b) the 1D wave-like chain in 2; (c) the 3D framework of 2; (d) a schematic representation of the topology of 2.

Therefore, the structure can be described as a (6,12)-connected net with a Schla¨fli symbol of {312?430?520?64}{36?48?5} (Fig. 3e). Such binodal highly-connected MOFs are still very rare for MOF materials. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two (6,12)- connected 3D network topologies (alb and mgc) documented in the literature.14 3 thus represents another example of binodal highly-connected MOFs with the (6,12)-connected network. XRPD patterns and thermal stability analyses XRPD experiments have been carried out on 1–3 in order to establish their crystalline phase purity. The XRPD patterns of bulk samples of 1–3 are consistent with the simulated patterns in terms of the single crystal data, suggesting the presence of mainly one crystalline phase in the corresponding samples 1–3 (Fig. S2–S4, ESI3). To identify the thermal stability of 1–3, TGA of 1–3 have been also studied under a N2 atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI3). In 1, the result shows a weight loss of 6.57% during the first major step before 100 uC, corresponding to the removal of five and a half uncoordinated water molecules (calcd. 8.12%). After the loss of all the uncoordinated water molecules, the framework is stable up to 220 uC and then begins to decompose upon further heating. The TGA curve of 2 shows a weight loss of 6.91% during the first major step before 110 uC, ascribed to the release of four free water molecules (calcd. 6.88%). After the loss of all the free water molecules, the framework is stable up to 250 uC until decomposition. For 3?5H2O, the first weight loss is approximately 9.65% before 150 uC, attributed to the release of five water molecules (calcd. 9.29%) and the framework begins to decompose with a continuous weight loss up to 300 uC. Luminescent properties It is well known that coordination polymers with d10 metal centers have excellent luminescent properties and potential applications as luminescent sensing materials.4,15 Therefore, the luminescent properties of 1–3 as well as the KH2TDA ligand have been investigated in the solid state at room temperature (Fig. 4). Upon excitation at 306 nm, two intense emission peaks at 379 nm and 386 nm are observed for the KH2TDA ligand, which are ascribed to p* A p and/or p* A n electronic transitions.15 Excitations at 280 nm for 1 and 2 and 285 nm for 3 lead to two maximum emission peaks at 362 nm, 383 nm for 1, 364 nm, 389 nm for 2 and 362 nm, 387 nm for 3, respectively. On comparison with the free KH2TDA ligand, the emission bands for 1 are similar to those of the free KH2TDA ligand and show blue shifts of 17 nm at the 362 nm band and 3 nm at the 383 nm band. The emission bands for 2 are also similar to those of the free KH2TDA ligand and show a blue shift of 15 nm at the 364 nm band and a slight red shift of 3 nm at the 389 nm band compared with the free KH2TDA ligand. The emission bands for 3 are similar to those of the free KH2TDA ligand as well and show a blue shift of 17 nm at the 362 nm band and a slight red shift of 1 nm at the 387 nm band compared with the free KH2TDA ligand. The emission bands for 1–3 are neither ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) nor metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) in nature because the ZnII ions and CdII ions are difficult to oxidize or reduce due to their d10 configuration.15,16 Therefore, 1–3 may be assigned to the intraligand p* A p or p* A n transition of Fig. 4 The solid-state luminescent spectra of 1–3 and KH2TDA at room temperature.

Published on 29 January 2013 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C3CE26854C View Article Online the KH2TDA ligand that is modified by the ZnII or CdII ions. In the documented literature, such two similar emission bands can be also observed in the coordination polymer {[K2Cd(HTDA)2]}n, which displays a strong blue-violet emission maxima at ca. 378 nm with a shoulder at ca. 392 nm.6f It is apparent that the emission bands for 1–3 are blue shifted compared with that of {[K2Cd(HTDA)2]}n. Conclusions Three d10-metal-ion-based MOFs were successfully constructed from the KH2TDA ligand in the presence of three different length-controllable auxiliary ligands. MOF 1 shows an inter- esting KAVGAQ topology, which can be extended by 2D layers and bpy pillars. MOFs 2 and 3 can be considered as a 6-connected {44?611} net and a (6,12)-connected {312?430?520?64}{36?48?5} net, respectively. On comparing MOFs 1–3, it is notable that the introduction of auxiliary ligands has a significant influence on the final products. This reveals that the auxiliary ligands play an important role in constructing the structural diversities of metal–organic frame- works and provide a greater possibility for the construction of unusual topological structures.
