Their structures and properties were determined by single-crystal and powder X-ray diﬀraction analyses, IR spectra, elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Complex 1 displays unusual 2D + 2D→2D parallel entangled networks consisting of (3,4)-connected 3,4L83 sheets. Complex 2 exhibits an interesting 2-fold interpenetrated framework with a trinodal (4,4,6)-connected (3·4·5·62·7)2(3·6·74)2(32·42·52·62·76·9) topology. The host network of complex 3 is a 2D 4-connected (44·62)-sql sheet. Complex 4 aﬀords unprecedented 3D (4,6,6)-coordinated framework with point symbol of (45·6)(48·67)(49·63·83)2, in which the 1D helix water chains occupy the void channels. Complex 5 can be regarded as a novel self-penetrating (4,4,4,5)-coordinated framework with point symbol of (4·54·6)2(4·65·7·83)2(5·6·7·83)2(52·83·92), which contains two interpenetrated (3,4,4,5)- coordinated (4·54·6)2(4·65·7·83)2(5·6·7)2(52·83·92) subnets linked by μ2-H2O. Complex 6 shows a 1D ladder chain, which are further assembled into a 3D supramolecular structure via O–H⋯O and π⋯π interactions. Moreover, magnetic studies indicate that both complex 2 and 4 show antiferromagnetic properties. Introduction Functional coordination polymers (CPs), a class of novel solid materials, have attracted thousands of coordination chemists and engineers for their interesting structures as well as poten- tial applications in gas separation and storage, catalysis, mag- netism, optical properties, and microelectronics sensing.1–4 The architectures and functions of these materials can be tai- lored by altering factors such as the metal cations, solvent media, templating agent, pH, counteranion, and the chemical structure of organic ligands.5–7 Strategically designed or select featured organic ligands according to their length, rigidity, coordination modes, and functional groups or substituents were proved to be an eﬃcient route for achieving the expected CPs.8 Quite recently, semirigid multicarboxylate ligands with two or more aromatic rings separated by the nonmetallic atoms (C, N, O, Si, S atom) were employed to build interesting coordi- nation frameworks, especially some flexible networks with breathing framework.9 The flexibility of the organic semirigid multicarboxylate ligands endowed the constructed functional CPs tunable structures, which further have influence on the pro- perties.10 Owing to the valence electron configuration of those nonmetallic atoms, the semi-rigid linkers have a trend to co- ordinate inorganic nodes with characteristic shapes. Moreover, when the ancillary ligands are introduced to build the net- works, the final packing architectures have greater tunability.11 A recent study showed that ancillary bridging imidazole linkers holding diﬀerent lengths and flexibilities have great †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Additional figures, IR spectrum, powder XRD patterns and X-ray crystallographic data.

Therefore, preparing novel func- tional metal–organic hybrid complexes using such kinds of semirigid multicarboxylate and ancillary bridging imidazole linkers should be attempted. The aforementioned points inspired us to assemble novel coordination frameworks with semirigid 3,5-bi(4-carboxyphe- noxy)benzoic acid (H3BCP) and three ancillary bridging imida- zole linkers (1,4-bib, 1,4-bidb, and 4,4′-bibp, Scheme 1). Herein, six novel CPs, with structures ranging from a 1D ladder chain (6), 2D sheet (3), 2D→2D parallel entangled network (1), 3D intriguing (4,6,6)-connected framework (4), 3D self-penetrating framework (5), to 3D→3D parallel entangled framework (2) (Scheme 2), were obtained through a mix ligand strategy under similar solvothermal reactions. Moreover, mag- netic studies indicated that both complexes 2 and 4 show anti- ferromagnetic properties. Experimental section Materials and methods All chemical reagents were purchased from Jinan Henghua Sci. & Tec. Co. Ltd. without further purification. The IR spectra were measured on a NEXUS 670 FTIR spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out on a CE instruments EA 1110 elemental analyzer. X-ray powder diﬀraction patterns were obtained on a Panalytical X-Pert pro diﬀractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in air on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 thermogravimetric analyzer. The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on a Quantum Design SQUID MPMS XL-7 instrument. The XPS measurements were performed using a VG 220i XL system with 12.5 eV as the pass energy and mono- chromatic AlKα X-ray excitation. General synthesis and characterization Complexes 1–6 were synthesised under similar conditions with a mixture of H3BCP, ancillary imidazole linkers (1,4-bib, 1,4-bidb, or 4,4′-bibp), and transitional metal salts added in H2O or mixed solvents. NaOH was added to eliminate the protons of H3BCP. After 170 °C heated for 3 days, suitable crys- tals were obtained. Moreover, the formate anion in complex 4 is believed to be derived from the decarboxylation of H3BCP under high temperature and high pressure conditions.13 To check the phase purity of 1–6, PXRD was introduced, and the comparisons of the measured and simulated PXRD pat- terns shows the main peaks are aligned with each other, which indicates the high purity of the complex (Fig. S1 and S2, see ESI†). For 1–6, the IR absorption bands in the range of 3400–3500 cm−1 can be attributed to the characteristic peaks of O–H vibrations. The vibrations at ca. 1530 and 1620 cm−1 correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxyl groups, respectively (Fig. S3†). Synthesis of [Co(HBCP)(1,4-bib)0.5]n (1).

The asymmetric unit consists of one CoII ion, one HBCP2−ligand, and a half of 1,4- bib ligand (Fig. 1a). Each CoII center is tetra-coordinated by three oxygen atoms from three diﬀerent HBCP2−linkers [Co(1)– O(1) = 1.969(5), Co(1)–O(5) = 1.983(7), and Co(1)–O(7) = 1.983(0) Å], and one nitrogen atom from 1,4-bib ligand [Co(1)– N(1) = 1.992(4) Å]. The H3BCP ligand is partially deprotonated and twisted with the dihedral angle between three phenyl rings are 71.7(5)°, 87.4(0)°, and 42.4(7)°, respectively. The three carboxyl groups coordinated with three CoII ions with μ1–η1:η0 coordination modes (Mode I, Scheme 3), leaving a 1D [Co- (HBCP)]n ladder chain with a Co⋯Co distance of 10.696(7) Å (Fig. 1b). The 1,4-bib ligand linked the 1D ladder chains, forming an interesting 2D sheet with a 60-membered large macrocycle (13.454(5) × 18.659(5) Å2) (Fig. 1c). Each sheet can be defined as a (3,4)-connected (42·63·8)- (42·6)-3,4L83 layer with the CoII ion and HBCP2−ligand regarded as four and three nodes, respectively. The large macrocycle within each sheet and the 1D [Co(HBCP)]n ladder chain makes the neighbouring layers possible to interpene- trate with each other. Finally, each sheet simultaneously pene- trated with two another adjacent ones formed a rarely reported 3-fold 2D→2D parallel entangled network (Fig. 1d).

X-ray analysis revealed complex 2 crystallized in monoclinic system P21/n. As depicted in Fig. 2a, complex 2 consists of one and a half crystallographically independent MnII ions, one BCP3−ligand, three coordinated water mole- cules, and half of 1,4-bib ligands. Mn(1) is hexa-coordinated by one N atom from 1,4-bib ligand, five O atoms from two diﬀerent BCP3−ligands, two mono-coordinated water mole- cules, and one bridging μ2-H2O, forming octahedral coordi- nation geometry with slight distortion.

It should be noted that three MnII ions are linking into one trinuclear [Mn3(COO)6] cluster by sharing six μ2–η2:η1 carboxyl groups, with the Mn⋯Mn distance is 3.830(9) Å. The trinuclear SBUs are further expanded to a 2D [Mn3(BCP)2]n sheet (Fig. 2b). The 1,4-bib bridging linker acts as a pillar to support the 2D sheets, resulting in a 3D network (Fig. 2c). It is noteworthy that the guest molecules (1,4-bib, H2O) occupied the channels via hydrogen bonds, which may be one impor- tant factor to stabilize the whole framework. Topology analysis shows that the whole network of complex 2 can be rationalized to a 2-fold 3D→3D interpenetrated (4,4,6)-connected networks with the point symbol of the (3·4·5·62·7)2(3·6·74)2(32·42·52·62·76·9) topology by denoting both Mn ions as 4-connected nodes, the BCP3−ligand as 6-con- nected nodes, respectively (Fig. 2d). Structural description of {[Mn0.5(1,4-bib)(H2O)]·(H2BCP)}n (3) Similar reaction environment to 2 was used except for the H2O being replaced with the H2O–EtOH system. The 3D→3D paral- lel entangled network degrades to a 2D sql sheet. Complex 3 crystallizes in triclinic space group P1ˉ. The asymmetric unit contains a half of crystallographically independent MnII ions, one 1,4-bib ligand, one protonated H2BCP−ion, and one lattice water (Fig. 3a). Crystal structure analysis shows that the MnII center is located in a slightly distorted hexa-coordinated octahedron, surrounded by four nitrogen atoms from four 1,4- bib ligands and two Owater. The Mn–N distances are 2.133(3)/ 2.211(7) Å, and the Mn–O bond length is 2.088(9) Å. The H3BCP ligands in complex 3 are partly deprotonated and act as anions, instead of participating in coordination to metal ions. MnII ions are connected by 1,4-bib ligands result- ing in a 4-connected 2D [Mn(1,4-bib)2]n 2n+ layer with an opening area of about 13.554(1) × 14.099(0) Å2, exhibiting a (44·62)-sql topology (Fig. 3b and 3c). Furthermore, with the help of O–H⋯O [O1–H1⋯O8i = 2.472(1) Å, O9ii–H2wii⋯O7 = 2.780(6) Å O9iii–H1wiii⋯O8 = 2.740(4) Å, symmetry codes: i: x, y, −1 + z; ii: x, y, −1 + z; iii: x, y, −1 + z.], finally given a stable 3D supramolecular architecture (Fig. 3d).

View Article Online pleted by five oxygen atoms from three diﬀerent BCP3−ligands and two HCOO−anions, and one nitrogen atoms from the 4,4′- bibp ligand, leaving distorted octahedral coordination geome- try. The bond lengths of Fe–O are in the range of 2.052(2)– 2.290(2) Å, and the Fe–N bond distance is 2.180(3) Å. In complex 4, each carboxyl group of the BCP3−ligand exhi- bits bridging μ2–η1:η1 coordination mode (Mode III). The HCOO−anion adopts μ4–η2:η2 bridging coordination mode. FeII cations are bridged by μ2–η1:η1 carboxyl groups and μ4–η2:η2–HCOO−anions to generate a 2D layer, including 1D [Fe4(COO)6(HCOO)2]n chains with the Fe⋯Fe distances being 3.399(8) Å, 4.089(5) Å, and 5.921(2) Å (Fig. 4b). The adjacent 2D layers are then bridged by 4,4′-bibp linkers to form a 3D framework (Fig. 4c). It is noteworthy that the solvent water molecules interacts with each other through O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds (d(D⋯A) = 3.163(3) Å, ∠(D–H⋯A) = 128.9(8)°), forming an interesting 1D helix water chain. From the viewpoint of structural topology, the final packing structure exhibits a (4,6,6)-connected framework with a point Schläfli symbol of (45·6)(48·67)(49·63·83)2 by denoting FeII cations and BCP3−ligands as 6-connected nodes, and HCOO− anion as 4-connected nodes (Fig. 4d). Structure descriptions of [Ni2.5(HBCP)(BCP)- (4,4′-bibp)2(μ2-H2O)(H2O)2]n (5) Structure analysis reveals that complex 5 is an unprecedented self-penetrating net, which has never been reported before. Complex 5 contains two and half of NiII ions, one completely deprotonated BCP3−ligand, one partly deprotonated HBCP2− ligand, two 4,4′-bibp bridging linkers, one μ2-H2O, and two mono-coordinated water molecules. As shown in Fig. 6a, Ni(1) is hexa-coordinated by two N atom from two 4,4′-bibp bridging linkers and four oxygen atoms from two BCP3−ligands and one HBCP2−ligand, resulting in a distorted octahedral coordi- nation geometry. The coordination environment of Ni(2) is a centrosymmetric NiO4N2 octahedral geometry, which is com- pleted by two O atoms from BCP3−ligands and two water molecules, and two N atoms from two 4,4′-bibp ligands. Ni(3) exhibits similar coordination geometry, as it is hexa- coordinated by two N atoms from the imidazole of 4,4′-bibp linkers, and four O atoms from two BCP3−ligand and two water molecules. The Ni–N and Ni–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.058(5)–2.070(6) Å and 2.012(5)–2.112(8) Å, respectively. The ligand of BCP3−acts as one μ4 node to coordinate with four NiII ions, in which three carboxyl groups adopt μ1–η1:η0, μ1–η1:η1, and μ2–η1:η1 coordination mode, respectively (Mode IV, Scheme 3), with the dihedral angles among the three phenyl rings being 86.5(6)°, 85.6(3)°, and 18.1(8)°, respectively. While the partly deprotonated HBCP2−acts as a bridging linker to link with two NiII, the two deprotonated carboxyl groups adopt μ1–η1:η0 and μ1–η1:η1 coordination mode, respectively (Mode V, Scheme 3), and the dihedral angles in HBCP2−are 71.0(9)°, 76.7(2)°, and 11.3(7)°, respectively. NiII ions are linked by BCP3−and HBCP2−ligands, and successfully constructed a 2D layer, which was further expanded by μ2-H2O to give a 3D [Ni2.5(HBCP)(BCP)(μ2-H2O)]n network (Fig. 5b).

View Article Online Interestingly, the linear 4,4′-bibp linkers, which act as a pillar to coordinate NiII ions of the layers, as well as the monoden- tate 4,4′-bibp ligands, both contribute to the stable final struc- ture (Fig. 5c). From the viewpoint of topology, the final obtained 3D struc- ture exhibits as an interestingly tetranodal (4,4,4,5)-connected 3D framework with the point Schläfli symbol of (4·54·6)2(4·65·7·83)2(5·6·7·83)2(52·83·92) in which Ni(1), Ni(2), Ni(3), BCP3−are denoted as 5-connected, 4-connected, 4-con- nected, and 4-connected nodes, respectively (Fig. 5d). It is worth noting that the whole structure can be seen as a self- penetrating nets, because the final structure can be easily simplified to a 2-fold interpenetrated (3,4,4,5)-connected (4·54·6)2(4·65·7·83)2(5·6·7)2(52·83·92) subnets by omitting μ2-H2O–Ni bonds. To the best of our knowledge, the topologies of both the subnets and frameworks have never been docu- mented up to now. Structural description of [Ni(HBCP)(1,4-bidb)1.5(H2O)2]n (6) When the long 4,4′-bibp ancillary bridging linker was replaced with shorter ligand of 1,4-bidb, the steric eﬀects and support- ing requirements of neighbouring ions show another trend. Structure analysis revealed complex 6 to be a 1D ladder chain, rather than 2D layers or 3D nets. Complex 6 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system, P21/c. As can be seen in Fig. 6a, the asymmetric unit contained one crystallographically independent NiII ion, one partly deprotonated HBCP2− ligand, one and half of 1,4-bidb, and two coordinated water molecules. Each NiII canter is located in a distorted [NiN3O3] octahedral geometry, completed by three O atoms from one HBCP2−ligand and two coordinated water molecules, as well as three nitrogen atoms from diﬀerent 1,4-bidb bridging ligands. The NiII ions are bridged by 1,4-bidb ligands to generate an infinite 1D [Ni(1,4-bidb)]n ladder structure (Fig. 6b) with a 1,4- bidb separated Ni⋯Ni distance of 2.778(3) Å. With the help of O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds (O5⋯H5A–O3 = 2.438(3) Å, O1w⋯H1w–O6 = 2.686(3) Å, and O2w⋯H3w–O2 = 2.778(3) Å) and π⋯π interactions ((D⋯A) = 3.833(7) Å) between the adja- cent chains, the final 3D supramolecular structure was formed (Fig. 6c). Structural comparisons As shown in Scheme 3 and Table 2, the semirigid H3BCP ligand adopted six diﬀerent coordination modes and the final obtained complexes displayed diverse structures. In complex 1, the H3BCP is partly deprotonated but coordinated three CoII ions with three η1:η0 mode carboxyl groups (Mode I), obtained 1D ladder chains, which are expanded by the bridged 1,4-bib ligands to a 3-fold 2D→2D interpenetrated (3,4)-connected net- works. For complex 2, the H3BCP is completely deprotonated and adopts (κ1–κ1)-(κ1–κ0)-(κ1–κ0)-μ4 mode (Mode II) bridged metal centres to form 2D sheets, which are further extended by the 1,4-bib ligands to generate 2-fold 3D→3D interpenetrated (4,4,6)-connected porous networks. At the same time, the other 1,4-bib ligands act as guest molecules to fulfil the voids and make the whole structure more stable through weak inter- actions. In complex 3, the H2BCP−anions act as guest molecules and link the 2D [Ni(1,4-bib)]n nets through hydrogen bonds, finally resulting in a 3D supramolecular. It is noteworthy that in complex 4, the BCP3−adopted (κ1–κ1)-(κ1–κ1)-(κ1–κ1)-μ6 mode (Mode III) to connect with six 1D [Fe4(COO)6(HCOO)2]n chains to successfully obtain a 2D [Fe(BCP)(HCOO)]n sheet. The bridg- ing 4,4′-bibp then further expanded to a 3D network. There are two kinds coordination modes in the assembly of complex 5, one BCP3−linked four NiII ions in a (κ1–κ1)-(κ1–κ0)-(κ1–κ1)-μ3 Fig. 6 (a) The asymmetric unit of 6 (Symmetry codes: A: 1 −x, y, 1.5 −z; B: x, 1 −y, 0.5 + z; C: 1 −x, 1 −y, 1 −z).

View Article Online mode (Mode IV), and the other linked two NiII ions using η1:η0-monodentate and η1:η1-cheating carboxyl groups (Mode V). In those coordination modes, 3D self-penetrating (4,4,4,5)- coordinated frameworks were constructed under the bridging 4,4′-bibp and μ2-H2O help. In complex 6, the partly deproto- nated HBCP2−, which serves as charge balance as well as the terminal ligand using its η1:η0-monodentate carboxyl group (Mode VI), constructed 1D ladder chains with the help of brid- ging 1,4-bidb ligands. Structural investigation of complexes 1–6 reveals that the H3BCP based coordination polymers varied from 1D ladder chain (6), 2D sheet (3), 2D→2D parallel entangled network (1), 3D intriguing (4,6,6)-connected framework (4), 3D self- penetrating framework (5), to 3D→3D parallel entangled framework (2). Systematic comparisons between 2 and 3 revealed that the pH of reaction system plays an important role in the deprotonation of aromatic carboxylic acids and the for- mation of final architectures. In addition, structures 2 and 3 are also controlled by the reaction solvent systems. Although complexes 5 and 6 were synthesized under similar conditions, the diﬀerent ancillary imidazole linkers (4,4′-bibp in 5 and 1,4- bidb in 6) resulted in diﬀerent structures: one 3D self-penetrat- ing (4,4,4,5)-coordinated (4·54·6)2(4·65·7·83)2(5·6·7·83)2(52·83·92) framework for 5 and 1D ladder chains based supramolecular architecture for 6. Last but not least, diﬀerent transition metal centres in assembling the coordination polymers also have pre- ferences when coordinated with imidazole linkers, which can be proved by the structural comparisons of 1/2 and 4/5. Thus, the obtained final structures are the result of multiple factors. Thermal analyses Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was performed on samples of 1–6, shown in Fig. S4.† For complex 1, the whole structure began to collapse at about 300 °C with a result of thermal decomposition (obsd 16.1%, calcd 14.9%). For complex 2, the first loss at about 100 °C is consistent with the removal of co- ordinated water molecules (obsd 7.0%, calcd 7.3%). The second weight loss in the range of 170–220 °C can be attribu- ted to the loss of 1,4-bib guest molecules (obsd 13.7%, calcd 14.2%). Then, the frameworks begin to collapse at about 410 °C. For complex 3, the weight loss below 105 °C can be attributed to the release of coordinated water (obsd: 3.3%; calcd: 2.8%). With increasing temperature, the H2BCP−guest molecules were lost. The host network then begins to collapse. For 4, the weight loss of water molecules is observed at about 115 °C (obsd: 8.9% and calcd: 8.3%). The decomposition of the organic ligands began from 350 °C as a result of thermal decomposition (obsd 19.1%, calcd 18.4%). For complex 5, the release of coordinated water molecules (obsd: 3.9%; calcd: 3.5%) in the temperature range of 85–135 °C took place. The framework can be stable until about 380 °C, finally giving a thermally stable unknown solid powder. For complex 6, the weight loss from 90 to 135 °C was attributed to the release of water molecules (obsd: 7.9%; calcd: 8.3%). Above 260 °C, it began to lose its ligands, finally resulting in thermal decompo- sition (obsd 9.6%, calcd 8.8%). XPS analysis In order to prove the oxidation state of Mn, Co and Fe ions in related complexes, the XPS measurements were performed using a VG 220i XL system with a 12.5 eV pass energy and monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray excitation. As shown in Fig. S5,† the measured binding energy of 781.62 eV for 1 is consistent with the oxidation state of CoII. For two Mn complexes, the XPS of 2 (Mn2p3: binding energy (BE) = 641.46 eV, Mn2p1: BE = 652.07 eV) and 3 (Mn2p3: binding energy (BE) = 640.37 eV, Mn2p1: BE = 651.02 eV) is close to the +2 oxidation state of Mn ions. For complex 4, the measured Fe2p3 and Fe2p1 binding energy are 708.92 eV, and 723.19 eV, indicated the oxidation state of Fe ions is +2. It is noteworthy that the Fe(II) based CPs under solvothermal reac- tions are rarely reported.16 All the metal ions being energy are in close with the ones in NIST X-ray Photoelectron Spec- troscopy Database.17 Magnetic properties The variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility of 2 and 4 were measured because the [Mn3(COO)6] SBUs in complex 2 and the [Fe4(COO)6(HCOO)2]n chain in complex 4 may have good magnetic properties. The above-mentioned complexes were tested in the temperature range of 2–300 K under a field of 1000 Oe. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the χMT value of 2 at 300 K is 9.87 cm3 K mol−1, lower than the theoretical value of the spin- only value (13.12 cm3 K mol−1) of three magnetically isolated MnII ions. With decreasing temperature, the χMT value decreases continuously to 9.22 cm3 K mol−1 at 40 K. The χMT value then increases rapidly up to a maximum value of Table 2 The detailed comparisons of complexes 1–6 Complex Coord. modes Ancillary linkers/role Dihedral angles (°) Structure and topology 1 Mode I 1,4-bib/bridging 87.4(0)/42.4(7)/71.7(5) 2D→2D (3,4)-connected parallel entangled (42·63·8)(42·6)-3,4L83 net 2 Mode II 1,4-bib/bridging + guest 54.7(7)/80.7(8)/58.4(9) 3D→3D (4,4,6)-connected (3·4·5·62·7)2(3·6·74)2(32·42·52·62·76·9) net 3 N/A 1,4-bib/bridging 73.8(5)/68.8(0)/23.0(8) 2D 4-connected (44·62)-sql sheet 4 Mode III 4,4′-bibp/bridging 88.7(5)/88.7(5)/9.9(4) 3D (4,6,6)-coordinated (45·6)(48·67)(49·63·83)2 net 5 Mode IV 4,4′-bibp/bridging 86.5(6)/85.6(3)/18.1(8) 3D self-penetrating 4-nodal (4·54·6)2(4·65·7·83)2(5·6·7·83)2(52·83·92) net 5 Mode V 4,4′-bibp/bridging 71.0(9)/76.7(2)/11.3(7) 3D self-penetrating 4-nodal (4·54·6)2(4·65·7·83)2(5·6·7·83)2(52·83·92) net 6 Mode VI 1,4-bidb/bridging 66.8(7)/82.6(1)/78.9(2) 1D ladder chain Dalton Transactions Paper This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 Dalton Trans., 2014, 43, 15979–15989 | 15987 Published on 28 August 2014.

With further increase in tempera- ture, the χMT value drops rapidly to 3.03 cm3 K mol−1 at 2 K. The temperature dependence χM followed the Curie–Weiss law χM = C/(T −θ) with C = 9.97 cm3 K mol−1, θ = −4.11 K (Fig. S6†). The negative value of θ indicates the presence of an antiferromagnetic interaction between MnII ions. The above characteristics clearly suggest overall antiferromagnetic inter- actions between MnII ions in compound 2.18 For compound 4, the χMT value is 11.02 cm3 K mol−1 at 300 K, as shown in Fig. 8. The susceptibility curve (χMT) decreases monotonically when cooling and reaches the lowest value of 1.82 cm3 K mol−1 at 2 K with the molar susceptibility χM showing a maximum. The temperature dependence χM −1–T is nonlinear, the χM −1 value at 300 K is 27.54 mol cm−3, and with decreasing temperature, the χMT value decreases continu- ously to 2.32 mol cm−3 at 0.2 K. The temperature dependence χM also clearly indicated very strong antiferromagnetic coup- ling between FeII ions in compound 4 (Fig. S7†).19 Conclusions In summary, we successfully designed and synthesized six coordination polymers based on 3,5-bi(4-carboxyphenoxy) benzoic acid and three rigid ancillary bridging imidazole linkers. Complexes 1–6 displayed appealing structural features varying from 1D ladder chain (6), 2D sheet (3), 2D→2D parallel entangled network (1), 3D intriguing (4,6,6)-connected frame- work (4), 3D self-penetrating framework (5), to 3D→3D parallel entangled framework (2). Magnetic studies indicated that com- plexes 2 and 4 both show antiferromagnetic properties. Conﬂict of interest The authors declare no competing financial interest.
