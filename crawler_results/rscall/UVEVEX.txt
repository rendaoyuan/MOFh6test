Commun., 2011, 47, 7674–7676 Template induced structural isomerism and enhancement of porosity in manganese(II) based metal–organic frameworks (Mn-MOFs)w Tamas Panda, Pradip Pachfule and Rahul Banerjee* Received 19th April 2011, Accepted 20th May 2011 DOI: 10.1039/c1cc12278a Three new metal–organic framework isomers have been synthe- sized by using the organic linker 5-triazole isophthalic acid and Mn(NO3)2xH2O. Structural conversions from non-porous to porous MOFs due to the template eﬀect have been observed. The cross-sectional pore apertures of the resulting Mn-MOFs are comparable to the molecular dimensions of the template (pyrazine and 4,40-bipyridine). The periodic increased porosity in Mn-MOFs depending on the size of the template used has been further conﬁrmed by the CO2 adsorption isotherms. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new class of network solids that have great potential in speciﬁc applications like gas separation, storage, heterogeneous catalysis and controlled drug delivery.1 A number of structural features such as surface area, pore size and shape and pore functionalization have been found to play an important role in designing MOFs for such applications.2 Thus, synthetic strategies that allow the control of the pore size and pore geometry are particularly important.3 Although porous MOFs can be synthesized using multi-dentate ligands, however, the ﬁnal structural topology is highly inﬂuenced by several factors including metal–ligand ratio, pH, solvent of crystallization, temperature and often by oxidation state of the metal.4 As a result, predicting the ﬁnal MOF topology by using ﬂexible ligands is even more diﬃcult due to the possibility of existence of several structural isomers.5 Therefore the design and synthesis of a particular structural isomer are still challenging aspects of crystal engineering,6 as these are governed by diverse perturbation factors, such as the conformational ﬂexibility of ligands, inﬂuence of guest/solvent molecules and reaction conditions. Among these factors, the eﬀect of solvent and conformational ﬂexibility has been demonstrated by several researchers, in which diﬀerent MOFs could be selectively synthesized from the same components using diﬀerent solvents.7 Herein, we demonstrate a rare example of template induced structural isomerism and controlled enhancement of porosity in a series of Mn-based metal–organic frameworks. These structurally isomeric Mn-MOFs, Mn–5TIA-1 (C26H24Mn2N8O10), Mn–5TIA-2 (C43.7H10Mn2N6O8) and Mn–5TIA-3 (C10H5MnN3O4), were synthesized from the organic linker 5-triazole isophthalic acid (5-TIA), Mn(NO3)2xH2O and N,N0 dimethyl formamide (DMF) as a solvent. We have used pyrazine and 4,40-bipyridine as templates to synthesise Mn–5TIA-2 and -3 (Fig. 1), respectively. We could systematically enhance the porosity and prepared nonporous to microporous MOFs from the same reactants by increasing the size of the template. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst report where the porosity of the structural isomers is enhanced periodically due to a size dependent template eﬀect. In the typical synthesis of these Mn-MOFs, we used the ﬂexible organic linker 5-TIA which was obtained via a three step process (Section S1 in ESIw).8 Single crystals of Mn–5TIA-1 were successfully obtained by heating a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 M solution of 5-TIA and Mn(NO3)2xH2O at 85 1C for 72 h. Similarly two additional isomers, Mn–5TIA-2 and -3, were obtained by adding 0.5 ml of 0.2 M solution of pyrazine and 4,40-bipyridine, respectively, during the synthesis. In the crystal structure of Mn–5TIA-1z (space group P21/c) only one type of SBU9 is present with two Mn(II) metal centres (Mn1 and Mn2). Among these two Mn(II) metal centers, Mn1 adopts an octahedral geometry, while Mn2 is in trigonal bipyramidal coordination state. It is noteworthy that octahedral Mn1 is coordinated to four oxygens from m2-CO2  functionalities Fig. 1 Synthesis of Mn-MOFs showing enhancement of porosity depending on the size of templates used during synthesis.

Commun., 2011, 47, 7674–7676 7675 of 5-TIA and two DMF oxygen atoms, while trigonal bipyramidal Mn2 is coordinated to two m2-CO2 , one m1-CO2  oxygen atoms and one m1-N atom (from triazolate functionality) of the 5-TIA ligand. In the structure of Mn–5TIA-1, octahedral Mn1 bridges to the next trigonal bipyramidal Mn2 through the m2-CO2  carboxyl functionalities and the m1-triazole group of the 5-TIA (Fig. S18, ESIw). These two Mn(II) centers extend in three dimensions through the coordination of m2-CO2 , m1-CO2  oxygens and m1-triazole nitrogen functionality of the 5-TIA ligand (Fig. S19, ESIw). Mn–5TIA-2, on the other hand, crystallizes in the Pbcn space group. Both Mn(II) centers in the dimanganese paddlewheel SBU have almost the same coordination environ- ments with a nearly ideal octahedral sphere (t E 0)10 enclosed by six 5-TIA ligands. Four such 5-TIA ligands are coordinated to this paddlewheel unit via one of their carboxylate groups and the other two are coordinated via the triazolyl nitrogen functionality (Fig. S20, ESIw). Each paddlewheel SBU extends further in three dimensions through two bridging m2-CO2  carboxyl groups and one nitrogen from the m1-triazolyl group of each 5-TIA ligand. The structure extends extensively through the b axis via coordination of the m2-CO2  carboxyl group. Whereas through a and c axes, it extends through the coordination of the m2-CO2  carboxyl group as well as the m1-triazolyl nitrogen functionality of the 5-TIA ligand (Fig. S21, ESIw). In Mn–5TIA-2 the coordination of the m1-triazolyl nitrogen functionality to the Mn(II) metal is convergent on both sides of the dimanganese paddlewheel SBU (Fig. 2 and Fig. S24, ESIw). In the crystal structure of Mn–5TIA-3 (space group P21/c) exactly similar dimanganese paddlewheel SBU like Mn–5TIA-2 [with octahedral Mn(II) metal centers] has been observed. Like Mn–5TIA-2, the structure of Mn–5TIA-3 extends in three dimensions through the two bridging m2-CO2  carboxyl groups and m1-triazolyl nitrogen from each 5-TIA ligand (Fig. S22, ESIw). However, unlike Mn–5TIA-2, the coordination of m1-triazolyl nitrogen functionalities to the Mn(II) metal is convergent on one side and divergent on the other side of the dimanganese paddlewheel SBU (Fig. 2). In the case of Mn–5TIA-3, twist of the triazole ring from the plane of the benzene ring of the 5-TIA ligand (42.51) is lower compared to the Mn–5TIA-2 (50.91). Structural analysis of Mn–5TIA-1 indicates that it is non- porous in nature. Exactly similar reaction conditions yielded Mn–5TIA-2, when we used pyrazine as a co-ligand. It is note- worthy that pyrazine molecules are not coordinated to the Mn(II) metal and neither trapped as guest inside the pores11 of Mn–5TIA-2. However, solvent accessible voids in Mn–5TIA-2 are higher (51.6%) compared to the solvent accessible voids of Mn–5TIA-1 (0%). Analysis of the pore aperture of Mn–5TIA-2 indicates that it has 2.56 A˚ pore aperture which is comparable to the length of the pyrazine molecule (2.81 A˚ from one nitrogen to another nitrogen of pyrazine) as shown in Fig. 2. We thought that increase in the pore aperture, which has similar dimensionality to the pyrazine molecule, could be an indication of pyrazine molecules acting as a template for creating higher porosity in Mn–5TIA-2. To prove this hypothesis, we replaced pyrazine with 4,40-bipyridine and attempted a similar synthetic procedure which yielded Mn–5TIA-3. Mn–5TIA-3 has higher solvent accessible void (52.5%) than Mn–5TIA-2 (51.6%). Close analysis of the crystal structure indicates the increase in the pore aperture from 2.57 A˚ (in Mn–5TIA-2) to 7.26 A˚ (in Mn–5TIA-3). It is note- worthy that the pore aperture of Mn–5TIA-3 is comparable to the molecular dimension of the 4,40-bipyridine molecule (7.21 A˚ from one nitrogen to another nitrogen of 4,40-bipyridine). Like Mn–5TIA-2, 4,40-bipyridine molecules are not coordinated to the metal and neither trapped as guest inside the pores of Mn–5TIA-3. The formation of Mn–5TIA-2 and -3 and subsequent systematic increase of their porosity and pore aperture indicate the template eﬀect of pyrazine and 4,40-bipyridine during the MOF formation. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) performed on as-synthesized Mn–5TIA-1, -2 and -3 revealed that these compounds have high thermal stability (see Section S3 in ESIw). The TGA trace for as synthesized Mn–5TIA-1, -2 and -3 showed a gradual weight-loss step of 2.13% (20–200 1C), 5.28% (20–200 1C) and 7.55% (20–200 1C), respectively, corresponding to escape of guest DMF solvent molecules from the pores (Fig. S13, ESIw). This is followed by a sharp weight loss (290–450 1C) probably due to the decomposition of the framework. In order to conﬁrm the phase purity of the bulk materials, powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) experiments were carried out on all complexes. All major peaks of experimental PXRDs of Mn–5TIA-1, -2 and -3 match well with simulated PXRDs, indicating their reasonable crystalline phase purity (Fig. S7 to S9, ESIw). Template (pyrazine and 4,40-bipyridine) induced enhancement of porosity has been observed in the Mn-MOFs reported in this communication. From the structural analysis using PLATON12 it was clear that Mn–5TIA-2 and -3 are having 51.6% and 52.5% solvent accessible void with 2.57 A˚ and 7.22 A˚ pore aperture respectively. High solvent accessible void and pore sizes comparable to the kinetic diameter of N2 (3.65 A˚ ) and CO2 (3.40 A˚ ) prompted us to analyze the N2 and CO2 adsorption properties of these two MOFs. Prior to gas sorption experiments, guest DMF solvent molecules are removed by solvent exchange (1:1 mixture of DCM:MeOH) followed by thermal activation at an optimized temperature of 110 1C, for 48 h. We could not get the N2 adsorption in Mn–5TIA-2 and Mn–5TIA-3, as the kinetic diameter of N2 (3.6 A˚ ) is higher than the cross-sectional pore Fig. 2 Structural diﬀerences between Mn–5TIA-2 and -3. In Mn–5TIA-2 the N2 nitrogen of the triazole ring is connected with Mn(II) but in Mn–5TIA-3 the N3 nitrogen of the triazole ring is connected with Mn(II) resulting in the increase in the MZC angle (Mn–centroid of the benzene ring in 5-TIA–carboxylate carbon of 5-TIA) for Mn–5TIA-3 (1291) than Mn–5TIA-2 (1091).

Commun., 2011, 47, 7674–7676 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 aperture of all these Mn-MOFs (Mn–5TIA-2, 2.57  2.57 A˚ and Mn–5TIA-3, 2.8  7.22 A˚ ). But the CO2 adsorption isotherms for these MOFs analyzed at 298 K are completely reversible. A possible reason for the selective CO2 adsorption over N2 could be due to the quadrupole interactions of N2 with the electrostatic ﬁeld gradients near the pore surface, which subsequently block other molecules from entering the pores. Whereas at 298 K such type of quadrupole interactions are overcome by the thermal energy in the case of CO2 adsorption. The CO2 adsorption isotherm in Mn–5TIA-1 shows 2 cc gm1 CO2 adsorption, as it is non-porous in nature. Mn–5TIA-2 shows 9.85 cc gm1 CO2 adsorption at the same conditions (Fig. 3). Whereas CO2 adsorption of Mn–5TIA-3 increases to 37.45 cc gm1 as pressure reaches to 1 bar (Fig. 3). The reason for higher CO2 adsorption in Mn–5TIA-3 (compared to Mn–5TIA-1 and -2) is the high solvent accessible void (52.5%) along with a larger pore aperture (7.216 A˚ ). In conclusion, we have synthesized three new Mn-MOFs using the predesigned 5-TIA ligand with transition metal Mn(II). For the ﬁrst time, we have discovered that in structural isomers porosity can be controlled by controlling the size of template. Mn–5TIA-1 is nonporous as no template has been used during its synthesis. Mn–5TIA-2 has 2.56 A˚ pore aperture which is comparable to the length of the pyrazine molecule. Similarly, the pore aperture of Mn–5TIA-3 is comparable to the molecular dimension of the 4, 40-bipyridine molecule. This increment in porosity in these Mn-MOFs depending on the size of the template used has been further validated by the CO2 adsorption isotherms. Non-porous Mn–5TIA-1 showed 2 cc gm1 CO2 uptake, whereas Mn–5TIA-2 and porous Mn–5TIA-3 show 9.85 cc gm1 and 37.45 cc gm1 CO2 adsorption, respectively.

Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 13 Section S2. Single crystal X-ray diffraction data collection, structure solution and refinement procedures. General Data Collection and Refinement Procedures: All single crystal data were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX three circle diffractometer equipped with a CCD area detector and operated at 1500 W power (50 kV, 30 mA) to generate Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073 Å). The incident X-ray beam was focused and monochromated using Bruker Excalibur Gobel mirror optics. Crystals of the Mn-MOFs reported in the paper were mounted on nylon CryoLoops (Hampton Research) with Paraton-N (Hampton Research). Initial scans of each specimen were performed to obtain preliminary unit cell parameters and to assess the mosaicity (breadth of spots between frames) of the crystal to select the required frame width for data collection. In every case frame widths of 0.5° were judged to be appropriate and full hemispheres of data were collected using the Bruker SMART1 software suite. Following data collection, reflections were sampled from all regions of the Ewald sphere to redetermine unit cell parameters for data integration and to check for rotational twinning using CELL_NOW2. In no data collection was evidence for crystal decay encountered. Following exhaustive review of the collected frames the resolution of the dataset was judged. Data were integrated using Bruker SAINT 3 software with a narrow frame algorithm and a 0.400 fractional lower limit of average intensity. Data were subsequently corrected for absorption by the program Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 14 SADABS4. The space group determinations and tests for merohedral twinning were carried out using XPREP3. In all cases, the highest possible space group was chosen. All structures were solved by direct methods and refined using the SHELXTL 975 software suite. Atoms were located from iterative examination of difference F-maps following least squares refinements of the earlier models. Final models were refined anisotropically (if the number of data permitted) until full convergence was achieved. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions (C-H = 0.93 Å) and included as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters 1.2-1.5 times Ueq of the attached C atoms. Data were collected at 293(2)K for Mn-5TIA-2 MOF and 190(2)K for Mn-5TIA-1 and -2 MOFs presented in this paper. This lower temperature was considered to be optimal for obtaining the best data. Electron density within void spaces has not been assigned to any guest entity but has been modeled as isolated oxygen and/or carbon atoms. The foremost errors in all the models are thought to lie in the assignment of guest electron density. All structures were examined using the Adsym subroutine of PLATON7 to assure that no additional symmetry could be applied to the models. All ellipsoids in ORTEP diagrams are displayed at the 50% probability level unless noted otherwise. For all structures we note that elevated R-values are commonly encountered in MOF crystallography for the reasons expressed above by us and by other research groups.8-17 1. Bruker (2005). APEX2.

The incident X-ray beam was focused and monochromated using Bruker Excalibur Gobel mirror optics. A total of 32862 reflections were collected of which 6794 were unique and 6116 of these were greater than 2σ (I). The range of θ was from 1.85– 28.270.

All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Mn-5TIA-1 contains two 5-amino isophthalic acid molecule in the asymmetric unit. It should be noted that other supporting characterization data (vide infra Section S2) are consistent with the crystal structure.

The incident X-ray beam was focused and monochromated using Bruker Excalibur Gobel mirror optics. A total of 9625 reflections were collected of which 3380 were unique and 2380 of these were greater than 2σ (I). The range of θ was from 2.89– 25.000. Analysis of the data showed negligible decay during collection. The structure was solved in orthorhombic Pbcn space group, with Z = 4, using direct methods. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Mn-5TIA-2 contains one 5-amino isophthalic acid molecule in the asymmetric unit. The attempts made to model the guests (solvent molecules) did not lead to identification of guest entities in these structures due to the limited periodicity of the solvent molecules in the crystals. Since the solvent is neither bonded to the framework nor tightly packed into the voids, solvent disorder can be expected for the MOF structures. Thus, electron density within void spaces which could not be assigned to any definite guest entity was modeled as isolated carbon or oxygen atoms, and the foremost errors in all the models lie with the assignment of guest electron density. To assess the correctness of the atomic positions in the framework, the application of the SQUEEZE routine of A. Spek has been performed. However, atomic co-ordinates for the “non-SQUEEZE” structures are also presented. It should be noted that the precision of this model is low; however, the structure is reported to demonstrate the nature of the framework of Mn-5TIA-2.
