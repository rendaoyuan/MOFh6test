Champness* and Martin Schro¨der* Received (in Cambridge, UK) 8th August 2007, Accepted 19th October 2007 First published as an Advance Article on the web 9th November 2007 DOI: 10.1039/b712201b A biporous three dimensional (3,6)-connected coordination framework is reported which exhibits excellent H2 adsorption at low pressures (¡1 bar) with high H2 adsorption density. Rapid progress has been made in recent years in the design and construction of coordination frameworks with extended architec- tures.1 A significant focus of research has been the development of porous coordination frameworks showing size- and shape-selective adsorption properties with potential applications in catalysis, ion- exchange, gas storage, and separation processes.2 Among the numerous studies devoted to such materials, metal carboxylate units have been found to be especially effective in generating families of porous materials.3,4 We envisaged that the pore walls of coordination frameworks, which typically comprise organic ligands, can be designed to incorporate additional functional groups5 that might protrude into the framework pores, thereby offering the potential to tune the adsorption properties through both size and chemical selectivity.6 One area of intense current interest is the development of coordination frameworks as materials for gas storage7 and in particular for H2 capture.8 In this study we present the use of a newly designed poly- topic ligand, 3,5-dicyano-4-(4-carboxyphenyl)-2,29:6940-terpyridine (Hdccptp), in the synthesis of a three-dimensional (3,6)-connected coordination framework, [Cu(dccptp)(NO3)]?0.5(1,4-dioxane)? 0.5MeOH 1, which contains two distinct channels that adsorb different guest molecules from the mixture of two solvents used in the synthesis. Compound 1 also exhibits strong H2 absorption capacity, particularly in terms of the adsorbed H2 density. Hdccptp was synthesized from b-amino-b-(pyrid-4-yl)acryloni- trile, prepared by a modification of Yamagushi’s method,9 and 4-carboxybenzaldehyde in acetic acid. Green crystals of 1 were harvested from the reaction of Hdccptp with Cu(NO3)2?2.5H2O in a mixture of MeOH and 1,4-dioxane at 100 uC. The composition of 1 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and TGA investigations, and the phase purity of the bulk sample was confirmed by powder XRD. In the IR spectrum, a strong band centred at around 2350 cm21, characteristic of the stretching vibration of non-coordinated cyano groups, confirms the presence of the cyano groups within the dccptp ligands. The single-crystal diffraction analysis of 1 reveals a three- dimensional (3,6)-connected coordination framework constructed from binuclear {Cu2} building-blocks and dccptp2 ligands.{ Significantly, each dccptp2 ligand binds to Cu(II) via one carboxylate and the two outer pyridyl donors, leaving two nitrile groups and the inner pyridyl amine unbound. Within the binuclear {Cu2} units each Cu(II) cation adopts a slightly distorted square- pyramidal coordination geometry, with the basal positions occupied by one NO3 2 oxygen, and by one carboxylate oxygen and two pyridyl nitrogens from three separate dccptp2 ligands, with another carboxylate oxygen from a fourth dccptp2 ligand bound at the axial site. Carboxylate bridging leads to the formation of a binuclear {Cu2} building-block, which is signifi- cantly different to the well-known paddlewheel [M2(O2CR)4]3a–d clusters. In 1, only two carboxylate groups bridge the metal centres rather than the four observed in paddlewheel clusters, and this results in a much longer intra-dimer Cu…Cu distance [4.268(2) A˚ ] than in conventional paddlewheel species (ca. 2.65 A˚ 3c,d,8e). The binuclear {Cu2} unit serves as a six-connected octahedral unit and the bridging dccptp2 ligands acting as three-connected nodes resulting in an infinite 3D (3,6)-connected porous coordination framework (Fig. 1a) of (42?6)2(44?62?87?102) topology (Fig. 1b). The same topology is observed in {[Cd(5-(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole- 2-thiolate)2]?CHCl3}n reported by Xu and co-workers.10 Three- dimensional frameworks with mixed connectivities and unbound donors such as that reported here remain relatively rare8f,11 although (3,6)-connected topologies have been observed in rutile [Schla¨fli symbol (4?62)2(42?610?83)],12a,b,c pyrite (63)2(612?83),12d,e and anatase (42?6)2(44?62?88?10)12f materials. Interestingly, two distinct channels (A and B) exist within the coordination framework of 1 (Fig. 1c). Both the cyano groups from dccptp2 ligands and coordinated NO3 2 anions protrude into the rhombic channel A. Channel B is surrounded both by the aromatic faces of phenyl groups and coordinated pyridyl rings of dccptp2 ligands, with the uncoordinated central pyridyl nitrogen atoms located at the corner of the channel. The approximate dimensions of the channels are 4.7 6 5.4 A˚ (channel A) and 4.6 6 7.8 A˚ (channel B) with the two acting as different hosts; channel A is filled with molecules of MeOH sandwiched between the free cyano groups of dccptp2, and channel B contains only 1,4-dioxane molecules. Thus, 1 acts as a biporous host separating the solvents used in the synthesis. An School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, UK NG7 2RD.

View Article Online / Journal Homepage / Table of Contents for this issue analysis of the host void of 1 reveals that 31.4% of the unit cell volume is occupied by the guest solvent species (Fig. 1a).13 Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments on 1 confirm that the guest MeOH and 1,4-dioxane are both removed (total weight loss, 10.4%, calc. 10.2%) by 160 uC under a flow of N2 at room pressure, significantly above the boiling point of 1,4-dioxane (101 uC).The guest-free frameworkisstable tofurtherheating until two consecutive weight losses occur over the range 260–560 uC leading to decomposition. The desolvated form of 1, hereinafter compound 2,remains crystalline witha PXRD patternvery similar to the diffraction pattern simulated from the single-crystal diffractiondataof1butwithbroadeningofsomediffractionpeaks. The desolvated framework 2 was generated by heating 1 at 125 uC for 20 h under high vacuum (1028 mbar). The N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K (Fig. 2a) reveals a reversible type-I sorption behaviour characteristic of a microporous material. The BET surface area is calculated to be 268 m2 g21, and the given microporous volume is 0.113 cm3 g21, confirming there are accessible micropores in 2. These values are comparable to those for smaller-pore zeolites, but are significantly lower than the values reported for many MOFs with high surface areas.2a,b,8 The pore size determined by applying the Dubinin–Astakhov (DA) equation14 to the sorption data is 5.6 A˚ , with a narrow distribution, in good agreement with values calculated from single-crystal diffraction data for 1. A gravimetric H2 sorption isotherm of 2 was recorded from 0–20 bar at 77 K. It also showed fully reversible type-I sorption behavior (Fig. 2b) indicative of the filling of the micropores only.15 The capacity of 2 to adsorb H2 increases from ca. 1.01 wt% at 0.2 bar to 1.91 wt% at 20 bar (Fig. 2b and Table S1{). It should be noted that there is a significant discrepancy between the measured pore volume (0.113 cm3 g21) from the N2 isotherm and the value calculated from the single-crystal X-ray structure (0.261 cm3 g21) using PLATON.13 This is possibly due to the N2 molecules being unable to effectively enter small pores at 77 K, which can either be caused by some energy barrier or blocking of pores by strongly adsorbed N2 molecules. The lack of biporous sorption behaviour in the N2 isotherms also supports this observation. If either of these accounts for the low N2 adsorption, the smaller dynamic diameter of H2 may then allow more effective adsorption and diffusion into the pores of 2. Therefore, the density of the maximum adsorbed H2 (1.99 wt%, obtained from Langmuir plots of H2 adsorption) was calculated with respect to VP-PLATON (0.261 cm3 g21), giving a value of approximately 0.0762 g cm23, slightly higher than the density of liquid H2 (0.0708 g cm23),16 suggesting that H2 is highly compressed within the pores of 2. In addition, the rapid increase in H2 uptake at low-pressures (Fig. 2b) is consistent with a strong interaction between H2 molecules and the pore walls, possibly due to the presence of cyano groups within the pore walls. Using Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR) analysis,14 the adsorption energy bE0 and the isosteric heat of H2 adsorption qst,W=1/e at the fraction filling of 1/e for 2 were found to be 5.21 and 6.12 kJ mol21, respectively. These are higher than values observed for active carbons2c (bE0, y3 kJ mol21; qst,W=1/e, y4 kJ mol21) and for reported microporous metal–organic frameworks such as [Zn2(L)] (L = 4,49-bipyridine-2,6,29,69-tetracarboxylate) where bE0 = 4.20 kJ mol21, qst,W=1/e, 5.12 kJ mol21.8c These high values indicate that 2 has a relatively high affinity for H2, and the amount of adsorbed H2 can, therefore, rapidly approach its maximum capacity at low pressure (Fig. 2b). Although the maximum uptake of H2 is relatively low in comparison to the highest capacity coordination framework Fig. 1 (a) Schematic representation of the interconnectivity of the 3- and 6-connecting nodes; (b) schematic representation of the (426)2(446287102) topological net of 1 (viewed close to the [010] direction; purple balls representing six-connected {Cu2} nodes, and blue balls ones represent the 3-connected central pyridyl nodes; (c) View of the (3,6)-connected biporous framework of 1 viewed close to [100] direction.

View Article Online materials reported to date (3.44–7.52 wt%),8e,f,17 the performance of 2 at low pressures compares favourably with previous examples. The H2 uptake of 2 at 1 bar (1.34 wt%) is comparable to microporous zeolites and aluminophosphates,18 but lower than that of MOF-505 or [Cu2(bptc)], which show high capacities of H2 weight percentage uptake (y2.5 wt%) under similar conditions (77 K and 1 atm).8e,17,19 Significantly, however, H2 absorption by 2 at pressures ¡0.5 bar are appreciably higher than those of the best MOF materials, e.g. 1.01 wt% at 0.2 bar for 2 vs. 0.58 wt% at 0.2 bar for IRMOF-11, or 0.60 wt% at 0.5 bar for MOF-5.16 At 1 bar, 67.3% of the H2 storage capacity of 2 has been reached, also notably higher than the corresponding values for MOF-5 (24.4%), IRMOF-6 (24.5%) IRMOF-20 (19.4%), MOF-177 (13.2%) and IRMOF-11 (42.9%).17 Moreover, the kinetic data for H2 absorption of 2 indicate that equilibrium is achieved rapidly in less than two minutes for an isotherm pressure step (see ESI{). In addition, 2 shows a high volumetric H2 uptake (23.9 g L21), comparable to some of the best MOFs (26.8–34.2 g L21),17,19 but significantly lower than our recent report of the highest volumetric storage density of 43.6 g L21 for [Cu2(tptc)], a value very close to the 2010 DOE target of 45 g L21.8e In summary, a three-dimensional (3,6)-connected biporous coordination framework has been synthesized using a designed polytopic ligand with nitrile appendages. The H2 adsorption measurement at 77 K reveals that the desolvated framework, 2, can absorb 1.01 wt% H2 at 0.2 bar and reaches a value of 1.91 wt% at 20 bar. Although the maximum uptake of H2 is modest, the H2 adsorption density and the relative H2 absorption at low pressure (¡1 bar) is the highest reported thus far.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis Suitable crystals were glued to glass fibres and mounted on a Bruker SMART1000 CCD diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystems open-flow cryostat and graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073Å). Crystallographic data were collected at 150 K, and an empirical absorption correction by SADABS3 was applied to the intensity data. All calculations were performed with the SHELXTL program. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS97,4a successive Fourier difference synthesis, and refined by full-matrix squares on F2 using SHELXL97,4b with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms on coordination framework. Hydrogen atoms on ligand and dioxane were placed in calculated positions and refined using a riding model, while those on methanol were found from the difference Fourier map and then refined using a riding model. Disorder of the cyano groups was modelled by N CN N CN NH2 N N N CN NC COOH a) b) c) Scheme S1.

The final refined occupancies were: C13/N2 0.647(8) and C13'/N2' 0.353(8); C14/N3 0.545(7) and C14'/N3' 0.455(7). The following distance restraints were applied to the disordered cyano groups: DFIX 1.14 0.01 C13 N2 C13' N2' C14 N3 C14' N3' DFIX 1.45 0.01 C13 C12 C13' C12 C14 C9 c14' C9 DFIX 2.59 0.02 C12 N2 C12 N2' C9 N3 C9 N3' The following distance restraints were applied to the dioxane molecules: DFIX 1.45 0.01 O7 C26 O7 C29 O8 C27 O8 C28 DFIX 1.55 0.01 C26 C27 C28 C29. The assignment of the C and O atoms in the methanol molecule was carried out by competitive refinements. In the model we present, both atoms have similar and reasonable Uiso values of about 0.10 Å2. Reversing the assignment leads to residuals which are only slightly higher but the Uiso values for these two atoms diverge and at convergence differ by a factor of three. The value for the “O” atom is 0.174(7) Å2 while that of the “C” atom is 0.057(3) Å2, strongly suggesting that this assignment is incorrect. Despite the validation problems with our model, we prefer it to the alternative but accept that the true situation in the crystal may be more complex. Crystal data for 1.

A SQUEEZE calculation in PLATON5 was used to confirm the solvent content, returning a total of 270.4 solvent electrons per unit cell, which corresponds to 0.5 MeOH and 0.5 dioxane per formula. This is consistent with the above refinement involving solvent molecules. Although refinement using the .hkp created by PLATON SQUEEZE as the new .hkl leads to lower residuals (R1 = 0.0639, wR2 = 0.154) and a lower Δρmax of 0.72 eÅ-3, we elected to publish the structure incorporating the solvent molecules. Sorption isotherm measurement of complex 1 The out-gassing and isotherm measurements were performed on a Hiden Isochema (Warrington UK.)

For measurements at liquid nitrogen temperature, a standard low-temperature liquid Dewar vessel was used. Before gas absorption measurement, the sample was activated at 125oC under high vacuum (10-8 mbar) for 20 hours. All isotherm data points were fitted by the IGASwin system software v.1.03.143 (Hiden Isochema, 2004) using a linear driving force model when > 98% equilibration had been reached. All changes in sample weight were corrected for buoyancy effects.
