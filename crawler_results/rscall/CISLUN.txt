Crystal structure analysis showed that the complex crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c and has a decorated body centred cubic (bcu) topological net with 8-connected Cu3 cluster as node. Magnetic studies exhibit prominent antiferromagnetic interactions influenced by EO (end on) azide and μ2,η2-tetrazolato bridge among the metal centres. Gas adsorption studies reveal moderate carbon dioxide uptake, which is also reflected in the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) value of −28 kJ mol−1. Introduction The design and synthesis of MOFs containing mineral topolo- gies with designable functionalities have attracted great attention.1,2 In terms of properties, the design of MOFs that combine more than one aspect like porosity with magnetism or luminescence has become one of the major challenges in the pursuit of multifunctional materials.3–5 A degree of con- trol over substrates, structure and ultimately, bulk properties that is not inherently present in naturally occurring com- pounds is potentially offered by MOFs. However literature study shows that only few three dimensional multifunctional frameworks with mineral topologies have been reported till date. Most of these networks are based on the use of three-, four-, or six-connected building blocks. Connectivities of five, seven, eight or higher are rare, possibly because of limita- tions in the symmetry or steric hindrance associated with connected nodes.6 Our strategy to make a framework mate- rial with both magnetic and gas adsorption property required a suitable ligand, 5-(4-pyridyl)-tetrazolate (4-ptz)7 (Scheme 1), which could provide short intermetallic distance for a mole- cule to be magnetically potent, and also maintain good metal to metal distance to incorporate porosity for gas adsorption. Our synthetic effort resulted in a three dimensional porous metal organic framework having molecular formula {[Cu3(N3)2(4-ptz)4(DMF)2]·2DMF}n (1), which shows eight- coordinated bcu-type topology.6a–e Although a similar porous bcu-type framework is reported by Lu et al.,6a the present complex is different in the sense that i) the ligand 4-ptz is formed in situ using 4-cyano pyridine, sodium azide and CuII ions in the reaction, ii) the remainder coordination environment and extra bridge between the CuII ions in {[Cu3(N3)2(4-ptz)4(DMF)2]·2DMF}n are formed by oxygen from DMF and azide respectively, rather than oxygen from water and Cl−ion as in {[Cu3Cl2(4-ptz)4(H2O)2]·3DMF·5H2O}n,6a and more importantly iii) it shows characteristic CO2 adsorption behaviour besides its typical antiferromagnetic property. Results and discussions Reaction of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, 4-cyanopyridine and NaN3 under continuous stirring at open atmosphere yielded com- plex 1. FT-IR spectra (Fig. S1†) shows characteristic peaks of the azide and NN of the tetrazolate group in complex 1 at 2058 cm−1 and 1398 cm−1 respectively. From TGA (Fig. S2†), weight loss of 1 from 145–190 °C is about 14% (calc. 12.6%), corresponding to the loss of two non-coordinated DMF mole- cules and from 200–330 °C is about 12% (calc. 12.6%), corre- sponding to the loss of two coordinated DMF molecules. The phase purity of the sample was ensured with PXRD (Fig. S3†). The PXRD pattern of 1 matches well with the simulated pat- tern obtained from the SC-XRD data of 1. The as-synthesized sample was pre-treated at 160 °C under vacuum.

Structural description Complex 1 is a three dimensional (3D) framework (Fig. S4†) containing azide, with end-on bridging mode and the 4-ptz ligands coordinating through the 2, 3 nitrogen atoms of the tetrazolate and the pyridyl nitrogen atom (Fig. 1a). The asym- metric unit consists of three CuII centres (SBU), two EO bridg- ing azide ions, four 4-ptz ligands and two coordinated DMF molecules. The crystal data and structural refinement details for the complex 1 are summarized in Table 1. Three CuII cen- tres can be grouped into two units, one unit consists of two terminal CuII ions and the central CuII ion forms the other unit with different connectivities but both the centres adopt distorted octahedral geometry. The terminal CuII centres are hexa-coordinated by two N atoms from two different pyridine moieties, two from two tetrazolate ligands, one N atom from μ1,1-azide and the remaining position occupied by O atom from DMF molecule. The central CuII is also six coordinated by four N atoms from four coordinating pyridyl groups and two N atoms from two azides. The 4-ptz ligands adopt a bridging mode with a coordinat- ing pyridyl group and a μ2,η2-tetrazolato bridge. The copper– copper separation, bridged by the azide and tetrazolate moi- ety of the 4-ptz ligands is 3.43(6) Å. All the Cu–N distances are in the range between 1.97(3) to 2.51(3) Å while the Cu–O distance is ~2.56(4) Å (Table 2). Furthermore, each trinuclear Cu SBU (secondary building unit) (Fig. 1b) connects to eight neighbouring ones through the 4-ptz ligands. This leads to a three dimensional (3D) framework with 1D channels that runs along the b-axis (Fig. 2). The dimension of each channel is about 6 × 6 Å2, and the non-coordinated DMF molecules occupy the free void spaces in the channels. Calculation of the void volume for the complex 1 by PLATON analysis8 revealed pore-accessible volume of 39.5% with respect to the whole unit cell volume (1169.1 Å3 out of the 2962.8 Å3 per unit cell volume). From the topological viewpoint, each Cu3 SBU can be reduced into 8-connected node, so that the whole framework can be repre- sented as a typical bcu net (Fig. 1c). In addition, due to the EO azide bridging, the free ends of the azides are pointed Scheme 1 Binding modes of the 4-ptz ligand in complex 1.

This makes the voids potential sites for CO2 adsorption due to affinity of the free N atoms towards guest CO2 molecules. Magnetic property study The variable temperature magnetic susceptibility for 1 was measured from 1.8–300 K at 0.1 T. A room temperature χMT value of 1.174 cm3 mol−1 K (Fig. 3) was observed and that is very close to the expected value for three isolated CuII ions (g = 2) with S = 1/2 (1.125 cm3 mol−1 K). As shown in Fig. 3, the curve displays a gradual decrease of the susceptibility on lowering the temperature with a gentle flattening below 100 K up to about 35 K, beneath which again the value declines sharply to 1.8 K reaching a value of 0.56 cm3 mol−1 K. The ini- tial decrease of the χMT product is the signature of antiferro- magnetic exchange interaction between the central CuII ion and the two terminal ones via the end-on azide bridges, but no coupling is present between the two terminal CuII ions. The gradual flattening of the curve below 100 K is due to the odd number of CuII ions in the trimer resulting in a ground spin state of S = 1/2, while at very low temperature the sharp decline in the χMT value indicates the presence of additional intertrimer interactions. This particular behaviour of the com- plex can be explained by a model (Fig. S5†) using the spin Hamiltonian, H = gβSzH −J1(S1·S2 + S2·S3) −J2(S1·S3) −zJ′ < Sz > Sz where, the first term represents the Zeeman factor,9a,b which considers a single isotropic g tensor for the CuII ions. J1 in the second term and J2 in the third rep- resent the exchange parameters between the neighbouring CuII ions and the terminal CuII ions respectively. The fourth term accounts for the intermolecular interactions, with J′ being the intermolecular exchange interaction and z the number of trimeric neighbours, in this case it is four. The arrangement of the core tricopper cluster is linear and antiferromagnetic interactions between the nearest neigh- bours are dominant, so, J2 can be neglected and taken to be zero. The resulting expression of the molar magnetic susceptibility in the βH/kT ≪1 approximation, is given in the following equation,   M      Ng F T k T zJ F T 2 2 4 ( ) F T x x x x x J kT           1 10 3 2 1 2 3 2 exp exp exp exp ,with . A very satisfactory fit to the curve obtained from the model, with the parameters, J1 = −200(2) cm−1, zJ′ = −10(1) cm−1 and g = 2.07(1), confirms that the assumption of the model is suitable. Further, the isothermal magnetization at 2 K and 7 T as a function of the applied field (Fig. 4) reveals a saturation value of 1.237 NμB, very close to the value corresponding to an isolated S = 1/2 ion. This confirms the antiferromagnetic interaction present in the compound.9c In addition, the large separation between two consecutive Cu atoms (3.43(7) Å), indicates that no direct exchange mechanism is contributing to the magnetic Table 2 Selected bond lengths (Å) and angles (°) for complex 1 Bond lengths (Å) Cu1–N1 2.013(2) Cu3–N7 2.028(5) Cu1–N5 2.010(4) Cu3–N9 1.967(3) Cu1–N9 2.319(4) Cu3–N12 2.014(5) Cu3–O1 2.556(4) Cu3–N13 2.012(3) Cu3–N2 2.505(3) Bond angles (°) N1–Cu1–N1A 180.0(1) O1–Cu3–N13 90.0(1) N1–Cu1–N9 87.4(1) N2–Cu3–N9 84.3(1) N1–Cu1–N9A 92.6(1) N2–Cu3–N12 96.7(1) N5–Cu1–N1 90.5(1) N2–Cu3–N13 93.2(1) N5–Cu1–N1A 89.5(1) N7–Cu3–N2 86.6(1) N5–Cu1–N5A 180.0(1) N7–Cu3–N9 88.1(1) N5–Cu1–N9 81.8(1) N7–Cu3–N12 176.1(1) N5–Cu1–N9A 98.2(1) N7–Cu3–N13 92.8(1) O1–Cu3–N7 84.3(1) N9–Cu3–N12 90.2(1) O1–Cu3–N2 170.5(1) N9–Cu3–N13 177.4(2) O1–Cu3–N9 92.6(1) N12–Cu3–N13 89.1(1) O1–Cu3–N12 92.2(1) Fig. 2 Surface-view representation of complex 1 showing channels along b-axis.

The strong antiferromagnetic interaction in 1 is solely due to superexchange mechanisms within the central- terminal copper pairs. As regards the magneto-structural correlation, in particular for CuII complexes the J parameter depends on the factors like: the Cu–N lengths, the Cu–N–Cu angle, the extent of planarity of the bridging network as well as the nature of the bridging ligand.10 In terms of magnetic coupling in EO azide and tetrazolate bridged CuII complexes, Cu–N distance above 2.05 Å and Cu–N–Cu bond angles > 104° often promote antiferromag- netic coupling between adjacent CuII centres.10 In the title complex 1, the Cu–N–Cu bond angles and Cu–N–N–Cu torsion angles are 105.99° and −7.75° respectively, whereas, Cu(1)–N(9) and Cu(3)–N(2) distances are 2.32(4) and 2.51(3) Å respectively. The above bond parameters justify the overall interaction to be antiferromagnetic in nature. Gas adsorption property To examine the porous property as well as the CO2 uptake ability, due to the presence of the N-containing moieties, gas sorption isotherms were measured for N2 and CO2 gases at different temperatures (Fig. S6† and Fig. 5). N2 adsorption profile at 77 K showed a typical type-III isotherm and the Langmuir surface area calculated from N2 adsorption profile was found to be 110.90 m2 g−1 (BET surface area = 67 m2 g−1). It has been established that the N-containing frameworks are promising materials to achieve significant CO2 adsorp- tion.11 For complex 1, at 298 K and 273 K (760 Torr pressure), CO2 uptakes are 1.2 wt% and 1.5 wt% respectively with hys- teretic isotherms12 and the value increases to 4.5 wt% at 195 K (1 bar) with reversible isotherm. This signifies that the trend of CO2 uptake increases on lowering the temperature. The most probable reason behind this CO2 uptake is that the lone pair electrons localised on the N-atoms of the azides11e as well as the tetrazolates in the framework, form strong electrostatic interaction with the electron deficient carbon of the CO2 molecule. The hysteresis at 298 and 273 K might be due to the fact that, adsorbed CO2 is not immediately released on reducing the pressure and is trapped within the framework at very low pressures. Despite the relatively large pore-accessible volume, the moderate CO2 uptake is consis- tent with the retention of the coordinated DMF molecules in the channels. The moderate interaction of CO2 with pore sur- face of 1 is also reflected in the value of isosteric heat of adsorption, Qst (−28 kJ mol−1), as calculated by the Dubinin– Radushkevich (DR) equation13 (Fig. 6). Although the coordinated DMF molecules are present in the channels, a considerable amount of N2 adsorption was observed. The accessibility of the space inside the structure for N2 is probably due to a dynamic aperture-widening process which occurs by the displacement of aromatic ring out of the way allowing gas molecules to pass.14 Conclusions In conclusion, a 3D porous metal organic framework, involv- ing in situ synthesis of the ligand 4-ptz is reported. Structural investigation reveals bcu topological net with 8-connected Cu3 cluster as node. The 3D framework is composed of 1D channels running along the b-axis.

More work in this direction is currently under progress in our lab. Experimental section General informations All the reagents and solvents were commercially available and were used as supplied without further purification. Sodium azide, Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O and 4-cyanopyridine were obtained from the Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co. Caution! Azide complexes are potentially explosive; and caution should be exercised when dealing with such derivatives. The elemental analyses (C, H and N) were carried out on Elementar Micro vario Cube Elemental Analyzer. FT-IR spec- tra (4000–400 cm−1) were recorded on KBr pellets with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum BX spectrometer. Powder X-ray dif- fraction (PXRD) data were collected on a PANalytical EMPYREAN instrument using Cu-Kα radiation. Synthesis of {[Cu3(N3)2(4-ptz)4 (DMF)2]·2DMF}n (1) To an aqueous solution (6 mL) of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (1.25 mmol, 248 mg), an acetonitrile solution (8 mL) of 4-cyanopyridine (2 mmol, 208 mg) was added and stirred. After about 1 hour an aqueous solution of NaN3 (2 mmol, 130 mg) was added to the above solution under continuous stirring and the solution was heated to 50–60 °C. After stir- ring for 4 more hours, the solution was left to cool down to room temperature which resulted in the separation of a shiny dark green compound. It was filtered and washed with cold acetonitrile. A part of it was dissolved in DMF and the clear solution was left to stand at room temperature which harvested green, rhombohedral shaped crystals after several days. The crystals were separated, washed with cold water and Et2O and air-dried. (Yield 53%). FT-IR (KBr pellet, 4000– 400 cm−1): ν (N3) 2058 cm−1, ν (NN) 1398 cm−1.

X-ray crystallographic analysis Single crystal X-ray data were collected on a Bruker APEXII CCD diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromatized Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 296 K using φ and ω scan. The structures were solved using direct methods followed by full matrix least square refinements against F2 (all data HKLF 4 format) using SHELXTL.15 Anisotropic refinement was used for all non-hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms were placed in appropriate calculated positions. During the final stages of refinement, several Q peaks were found, which probably corre- spond to highly disordered solvent molecules and are removed by SQUEEZE16 programme. From the TG analysis it is con- firmed that two non-coordinated DMF molecules are present and hence these are included in the molecular formula. As the structure contained solvent accessible voids SQUEEZE programme was applied. Quality of crystal was poor which resulted in poor data to parameter ratio. In anisotropic refinement some atoms (N11 and C13) became ADP (Anisotropic Displacement Parameter). Magnetic measurements Magnetic measurements were performed using a Quantum Design VSM SQUID magnetometer. The measured values were corrected for the experimentally measured contribution of the sample holder, while the derived susceptibilities were corrected for the diamagnetism of the samples, estimated from Pascal's tables.9b Gas adsorption measurements N2 and CO2 adsorption studies were performed by using BELSORP MAX (BEL JAPAN) volumetric adsorption analyser. All the gases used were of Ultra-pure research grade (99.9%). Prior to the measurements a known weight of adsorbent pow- der sample (120 mg) was pre-treated for 12 h under 10−2 KPa continuous vacuum using BelPrepvacII and purged with N2 on cooling.
