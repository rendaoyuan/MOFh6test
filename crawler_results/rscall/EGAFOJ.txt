It was found that the structures of the lanthanide MOFs are easyly influenced by the reaction conditions and the metal ion radius. Moreover, the emission spectra revealed that 3 exhibits good luminescence proper- ties. Magnetism measurements showed that 4 has ferromagnetic properties. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations revealed that the coupling parameter between two Gd(III) ions is 0.03 cm−1, suggesting a weak ferromagnetic exchange. Furthermore, under the consideration of strong correlations between localized f electrons, first principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the GGA + U approach showed that the magnetic properties of 4 are originated from the 4f electrons of Gd(III) propa- gating by a super-exchange pathway on two −/+/−spin nets of the carboxylate groups. Introduction Lanthanide metal–organic frameworks (LMOFs) have been attracting enormous interest because of their fascinating structural diversity and unique properties, such as magne- tism and luminescence.1–10 Up to now, a great many LMOFs1–10 with interesting architectures and topologies have been obtained by design or serendipity. However, most LMOFs have been based on ligands of aromatic carboxylic acid, whereas studies on long-chain fatty acid-based LMOFs are relative rare,11–16 owing to the unstability of the fatty acids under hydrothermal conditions. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the effect of the synthetic conditions on the structure of LMOFs with long-chain fatty acids. Moreover, the determination of structure–function rela- tionships is necessary for the application of materials. Currently, said studies in LMOFs have been a challenge. This hiatus is attributable to the fact that the complicated electronic structure of the f section metals is often influenced by the orbital angular momentum and the crystal-field effect,17 rendering the structure–function relationships of LMOFs difficult to understand. In this regard, experimental discussions alone hardly provide a profound understanding. The combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies has become an effective and necessary tool. QMC simu- lations are a high-precision method to identify complex mag- netic coupling behaviors in the quantum regime, such as in high nuclear clusters and multi-dimensional frameworks.18–23 The DFT method has the capability to study the magnetism- generating mechanism of MOFs at the molecular level.24–33 So far, the study of magnetism–structure relationships by the combination of QMC and DFT remains scarce. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of five LMOFs based on (ethylenedithio)acetic acid, {[Ln(EDA)1.5(H2O)2](DMF)} (Ln = La (1), Nd (2), Eu (3) and Gd (4)), {[La(EDA)1.5(H2O)2](H2O)} (5). Luminescence and magne- tism properties have been identified. Furthermore, by com- bining QMC and DFT calculations, we further determined the magnetic coupling parameter and the super-exchange path- way between two adjacent Gd(III) ions.

Crystallographic data, DFT and QMC calculations Suitable single crystals of compounds 1–5 were used for data collection using a CrysAlis CCD diffractometer (Xcalibur, Eos, Gemini ultra) at 298 K equipped with an Enhance (Mo) X-ray source (λ = 0.71073 Å). Integration and cell refinement were performed using CrysAlis RED. The absorption correction was conducted by the multi-scan method using the SCALE3 ABSPACK scaling algorithm. All corrections were made for Lorentz and polarization effects. The molecular structures were solved by direct methods (SHELXL-86/SHELXL-97)34 and the refinement by full-matrix least-squares on F2 (SHELXS-97). Crystal data of 1–5 are shown in Table 1. The bond lengths and angles of 1–5 are given in Table S1.† All DFT calculations were performed using the projector- augmented wave (PAW) method of Blöchl,35 as implemented in the ab initio VASP program.36,37 The PAW method can effectively combine the accuracy of augmented-plane-wave methods with the efficiency of the pseudopotential approach. Exchange-correlation (XC) effects were described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew Burke Ernzerhof (PBE)38 formalism. After several convergence tests, a cutoff energy of 800 eV for 4 was used in the expan- sion of the plane wave basis. For the Brillouin zone integra- tion, a Γ centered 4 × 3 × 2 k-point grid was adopted. One non-local correlation vdW-DF based on the opt86b functional was made to correct the dispersion interactions. In order to obtain the electronic structure with a higher accuracy, the on-site Coulombic interactions of Gd 4f-electrons were con- sidered with the GGA + U scheme,39 where the effective Hub- bard U for Gd was determined by the optimisation of the lattice constant against the different U. The optimization con- vergence in force was set to 2.0 × 10−2 eV Å−1, and the SCF convergence was set to 1.0 × 10−7 eV per atom. Quantum Monte Carlo magnetic simulations were performed with our fitting program (see ESI†), where we embedded the LOOP module of the ALPS project40 under the LOOP algorithm.41 For each site, 2 × 106 Monte Carlo steps and 2 × 105 Monte Carlo sweeps for thermalization were performed. The sample was 200 spins, which is large enough to prevent any finite size effects. Moreover, periodic boundary conditions (PBC) were applied in order to avoid perturbations from the edge of the sample and to speed up convergence toward the infinite lattice limit.

The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one La(III) ion, one and a half EDA2−ligands, two aqua ligands and one DMF molecule. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the La(III) ion exhibits a decoordinated configuration with bicapped square anti-prism geometry, featuring the contributions of eight carboxylate oxygens and two aqua ligands. The obtained La(III)–O bond distance is 2.520–2.912 Å, in agreement with that reported previously.42 Each La(III) ion is bonded to five EDA2−ligands. Likewise, each La(III) ion is connected to adjacent ones by μ2-η1,η2 carboxylic groups generating a one-dimensional {La(COOH)n} chain, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The La⋯La dis- tances are 4.556 and 4.653 Å. Furthermore, the connection of neighboring {La(COOH)n} chains by EDA2−ligands produces a three-dimensional framework, as displayed in Fig. 1(c). Small pores of 3.5 × 3.5 Å2 along the a axis are found in 1. It must be mentioned that two DMF molecules are trapped in the pores of 1 along the a axis, as shown in Fig. 2. Compounds 2–4 are isomorphic with 1. The average bond length of Ln–O (Ln = La, Nd, Eu, Gd) is 2.621, 2.532, 2.476 and 2.465 Å, respectively. The Ln⋯Ln distances are 4.495 and 4.726 Å for 2, 4.432 and 4.813 Å for 3, and 4.417 and 4.833 Å for 4. It was observed that with the increase of the Ln(III) radius, one of the Ln⋯Ln distances decreases, while the other one increases. In general, the shortest Ln⋯Ln ions of compounds 2–4 are separated by two μ2-η1,η2 carboxylic groups. Accordingly, the coordination number of the Ln(III) ions in 2–4 changes from 10 to 9. On the other hand, attempts to synthesize compounds 2–4 by ultrasonic treatment failed. This may be because the increase on the Ln ion radius results in the requirement of more energy for the reaction between H2EDA and the Ln ions. Therefore, in order to find a suitable temperature for the synthesis of the other Ln-based compounds (Ln = Nd, Eu, Table 1 Crystallographic data and details of the data collection and refinement for 1–5 Complex 1 2 3 4 5 Formula C12H23NO9S3La C12H23NO9S3Nd C12H23NO9S3Eu C12H23NO9S3Gd C9H18O9S3La Mr 560.40 565.73 573.45 578.74 505.32 Crystal system Triclinic Triclinic Triclinic Triclinic Triclinic Space group P1¯ P1¯ P1¯ P1¯ P1¯ a/Å 9.1258(3) 9.1400(5) 9.1686(5) 9.1742(5) 8.2735(4) b/Å 11.1380(4) 11.1538(3) 11.1145(7) 11.1153(5) 8.6746(5) c/Å 11.3262(4) 11.2716(6) 11.1899(8) 11.1714(5) 13.5650(7) α/° 77.317(3) 77.261(3) 77.156(6) 77.009(4) 103.465(5) β/° 68.681(4) 68.453(5) 68.195(6) 68.082(5) 95.601(4) γ/° 79.250(3) 78.843(3) 78.350(5) 78.222(4) 117.312(5) V/Å3 1039.05(6) 1034.43(8) 1023.21(11) 1020.66(9) 817.36(7) Z 2 2 2 2 2 Dcalcd/g cm−3 1.791 1.816 1.861 1.883 2.053 μ/mm−1 2.398 2.854 3.413 3.598 3.035 No. of data/parameter 4081/235 4058/235 4017/235 4006/251 3204/218 θ range/° 2.94–26.00 2.94–26.00 2.87–26.00 2.97–26.00 2.85–26.00 Obs reflns 3868 3713 3331 3710 2965 R1 [I > 2σ(I)]a 0.0262 0.0269 0.0410 0.0288 0.0309 wR2 (all data)b 0.0738 0.0728 0.0884 0.0793 0.0706 a R1 = P‖FO| −|FC‖/P|FO|. b wR2 = {P[w(FO 2 −FC 2)2]/P[w(FO 2)2]}1/2.

At 90 °C, the three Ln-based (Ln = Nd, Eu, Gd) compounds were obtained, which are isomorphic with 1. At a temperature higher than 100 °C, the H2EDA ligand decomposed, resulting in the generation of oxalate-based compounds.43 When the temperature is lower than 90 °C, no crystals were obtained. When using heavy Ln ions (such as Ho(III) and Yb(III)), the obtained reaction products at 90 °C were only oxalate-based compounds. Interestingly, when using La(NO3)3·6H2O at 90 °C, a new different compound, namely 5, was obtained. Compound 5, {[La(EDA)1.5(H2O)2](H2O)}, belongs to the P1¯ space group of the triclinic system. The crystal structure anal- ysis shows that the asymmetric unit contains one La(III) ion, one and a half EDA2−ligands, two aqua ligands and one guest water molecule. The coordination environment can be view as a bicapped square antiprism geometry, which is derived from the eight oxygen atoms from four EDA2−ligands and two oxygen atoms from two aqua ligands. Inspection of the coordination environment of compounds 1 and 5 reveals three different aspects: 1) EDA2−ligands in compound 5 exhibit two different coordination modes, but only one in 1, as shown in Fig. S2;† 2) the number of EDA2−ligands around the La(III) ion is five in 1 and six in 5; 3) the obtained La–O bond length of 2.493–2.836 Å in 5 is slightly smaller than that in 1. Each La(III) ion is connected to adjacent ones by two syn–syn carboxylic groups and two μ2-η1,η2 carboxylic groups so as to generate a {La2} unit. Each {La2} unit is bonded to neighboring ones by two μ2-η1,η2 carboxylic groups produc- ing one dimensional {La(COOH)n} chain along the b axis, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Noticeably, this {La(COOH)n} chain is dif- ferent from that of 1, where syn–syn carboxylate bridges are not observed. Furthermore, the {La(COOH)n} chains are connected with adjacent ones by two carboxylic groups of EDA2−ligands along the a and c axes, respectively, forming a three dimensional framework, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). Fluorescence properties The luminescence spectrum of compound 3 was investigated in the solid state at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 4, under excitation at 330 nm, there are five sharp emission lines for compound 3: 578, 591, 615, 649 and 692 nm. The emission peaks can be assigned to the transitions between the first excited non-degenerate 5D0 states and the 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) levels of the fundamental Eu3+ septet. It is observed that the 5D0 →7F1, 5D0 →7F2 and 5D0 →7F4 transitions are the three strongest peaks, respectively, whereas the 5D0 →7F0 and 5D0 →7F3 transitions are rather weak. The transition of 5D0 →7F1 corresponds to a magnetic-dipole character inde- pendent of the Eu3+ crystal site, while the other ones are mainly of electric-dipole nature.44 However, the local-field splitting of 7FJ (J = 1, 2, 4) levels into one, two and two Stark Fig. 2 Three dimensional structure of 1 with DMF guest molecules.

In addition, the luminescence spectra of 2 and 4 were also investigated, however, none of them exhibited good emission properties. Magnetism–structure relationship: experimental, QMC and DFT studies The magnetic properties of 4 were investigated through variable-temperature susceptibility measurements in the tem- perature range of 2.0 to 300 K with an applied magnetic field of 1000 Oe, as shown in Fig. 5. The χMT value at room tem- perature (300 K) is 7.86 cm3 mol−1 K, which is in line with the value of 7.88 cm3 mol−1 K expected for one independent Gd3+ ion (8S7/2, g = 2.0) following the Curie law. As the tem- perature decreases, the value of χMT increases slowly and reaches a value of 7.95 cm3 mol−1 K at 50 K. Upon lowering the temperature further, the value of χMT increases abruptly and reaches 9.07 cm3 mol−1 K at 2.0 K, indicating the ferro- magnetic character of 4. According to the Curie–Weiss law, the data over the temperature range of 100–300 K fit well to a Weiss constant of C = 7.83 cm3 mol−1 K and a Curie tempera- ture of θ = 0.94 K. The positive Curie temperature of 0.94 K further validates that 4 exhibits an overall weak ferromagne- tism. In addition, 2 and 3 exhibit antiferromagnetic proper- ties, see Fig. S4.† For the exploration of the magnetic exchange parameter, QMC fitting of the χMT vs. T plot with the given model was conducted by our fitting program (see ESI†). The one- dimensional chain structure can be seen in Fig. 6(a) and the resulting Hamiltonian operator is given in Fig. 6(b). Although the shortest Gd(III)⋯Gd(III) separations are 4.417 and 4.833 Å (see Fig. 7), respectively, the effect of the distance of two adjacent Gd(III) ions is very small. Therefore, the coupling parameter J represents the magnetic propagation between two adjacent Gd(III) ions by the carboxylate bridges. Mean- while, concerning the susceptibility equation, we also consid- ered the temperature-independent paramagnetism (TIP) parameter due to the effect of large paramagnetic centers. According to the principle of the least reliability factor (R), the obtained best parameters are: J = 0.03 cm−1, g = 2.00, TIP = −0.0001 cm3 mol−1 and R = 1.8 × 10−5. The J value of 0.03 cm−1 reveals that the ferromagnetic interactions between two adjacent Gd(III) ions are very weak, which is in good agree- ment with the hybrid-DFT results reported by G. Rajaraman and Fig. 4 Luminescence spectrum of compound 3. Fig. 5 Experimental plot of χMT vs. T (○) and χM −1 vs. T (□) for 4; QMC fitting line (red) and Curie–Weiss fitting line (blue).

To further study the magnetic mechanism, DFT calcula- tions were performed with the help of the VASP package. In this study, we chose the X-Ray experimental data as the ini- tial geometry. The optimized process has two steps: firstly, under the constraints of no-hydrogen atoms, all of the hydro- gen atoms were optimized; secondly, all the atoms were fully relaxed at the optimized geometry. The correction of the Van der Waals force based on the opt86-exchange functional was taken into account. Moreover, in order to search for one effective U value, a typical optimization of the lattice parame- ters was performed at 1 eV intervals between 0.0 and 10.0 eV U value. Owing to the fact that the {GdCOO}n chains lie on the a axis, the a parameter was determined from the value of U. The obtained a vs. U plot is displayed in Fig. S4.† It was found that the exact U value in 4 is 9.0 eV. At the U of 9.0 eV, the optimized local-stable configuration is in good agreement with that of the X-ray analysis results. According to the exper- imental χMT values (7.86 cm3 mol−1 K) at 2 K, the initial mag- netic moment of each Gd(III) ion is set to 7.00 μB. The total density of states (TDOS) of 4 and partial density of states (PDOS) of Gd(III), C1, C6, O1, O2, O3 and O4 atoms were calculated. When we further increased the value of Ueff, the magnetic moment of Gd increased a little. It is observed that stronger correlations enhance the magnetic coupling. Herein, we present the PDOS for Ueff of 0.0 and 9.0 eV to investigate the effect of strong correlations between the local- ized electrons of Gd 4f. Essentially, magnetic properties are determined by the DOS distribution near the Fermi level. As shown in Fig. 8, the TDOS, 5d and 4f PDOS of Gd, and 2p PDOS of C1, C6, O1, O2, O3 and O4 are clearly split, resulting in an ordered spin distribution by exchange interactions. Inspec- tion of the DOS distribution and spin magnetic moment (see Table 2), it was found that the magnetic moment of 4 is origi- nated from the 4f orbitals of Gd, while the 2p orbitals of C1, O1, O2 and C6, O3, O4 also contribute to the magnetic moment. Therefore, the ferromagnetic coupling interactions of 4 are derived from the 4f electrons of Gd propagating by the super- exchange pathway on the two −/+/−spin nets of O1–C1–O2 and O3–C6–O4. This conclusion is in good agreement with that for the compound [Gd2(mal)3(H2O)6].46 Furthermore, the band structure of 4 at Ueff of 9.0 eV was identified. As shown in Fig. 9, it was found that the highest occupied molecular orbitals overlap with the lowest unoccu- pied molecular orbitals in the spin-up subbands and spin- down subbands. From the DOS of Fig. 8a, spin-up and spin- down TDOS are continuous in the vicinity of the Fermi level, where the cross bands are mainly originated from the 5d and 4f PDOS of Gd(III). With the Ueff value increasing from 0.0 to Fig. 8 DOS of 4 at Hubbard U value of 0.0 (a–b) and 9.0 eV (c–d) in spin-up (black) and spin-down (red) with the Fermi level (blue line).

For exam- ple, one peak of the carboxylate (e.g. C1, O1, O2, C6, O3 and O4) at about 1.9 eV for Ueff 0.0 eV moves to 4.0 eV above the Fermi level. However, the bands are still occupied at the Fermi level. Thus, the band structure analysis also validates the magnetic properties of 4. Conclusions In summary, we have successfully prepared five new lanthanide-based MOFs with the H2EDA ligand. Compounds 1–4 are three-dimensional isomorphic structures with one dimensional {Ln(COOH)n} chains, while compound 5 exhibits a different framework. Compound 3 displays good lumines- cence properties. Magnetic measurements indicate that com- pound 4 has ferromagnetic properties. QMC simulations revealed that the coupling parameter between two Gd(III) ions is 0.03 cm−1, suggesting a weak ferromagnetic exchange. Fur- thermore, DFT calculations showed that the magnetic proper- ties of 4 originate from the 4f electrons of Gd(III) propagating by a super-exchange pathways on two −/+/−spin nets of the carboxylate groups.

Our QMC fitting program Algorithm of our fitting Program: The quantum Monte Carlo calculations were performed by our fitting program, where we call LOOP module of ALPS and utilize four parameters (J, g, zJ and TIP ) to further fit the experimental result by use of exhaustive-iterative method. The corresponding formulas were shown in Eq(1)-Eq(4). The running procedure of our program is presented in the Figure S1. In the beginning, the range of four parameters ( J, g, TIP, zJ ) were respectively set to that: [J1: J2], [g1: g2], [TIP1: TIP2], [zJ1: zJ2], and the step sizes were set to ΔJ, Δg, ΔTIP and ΔzJ. Until the running is over, the best parameters (Rb, Jb, gb, TIPb, zJb) were obtained. Eq(1) where uniform magnetic susceptibility χu is dimensionless. Convert uniform magnetic susceptibility to χT (cm3mol-1) Eq(2) where g is Landég-factor and A is unit constant.
