[FeII HS–L1–LnIII] (1–9) and [CoII–L1–LnIII] (10–17) series are isostructural, and display 3D porous networks with 1D nanosized channels constructed by Fe/Co-OCO-Ln linkages. Furthermore, two types of “water” pipes are observed in 1D channels. [CoII–L2–LnIII] (18–25) series exhibit 2D open frameworks based on double-stranded helical motifs, which are further assembled into 3D porous structures by intermolecular hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups. The variety of the resulting structures is mainly due to the HO-substitution effect. These 3D coordination polymers show considerably high thermal stability, and do not decomposed until 400 ◦C. The high-spin FeII ion in [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] was conﬁrmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, M¨ossbauer spectroscopy and magnetic studies. The luminescent spectra of coordination polymers associated with SmIII, EuIII, TbIII and DyIII were systematically investigated, and indicate that different d-metal ions in d-f systems may result in dissimilar luminescent properties. The magnetic properties of [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] (3, 6, 7, 9, 13), [CoII–L1–LnIII] (15–17) and [CoII–L2–LnIII] (19–24) coordination polymers were also studied, and the cMT values decrease with cooling. For the single ion behavior of CoII and LnIII ions, the magnetic coupling nature between FeII HS/CoII and LnIII ions cannot be clearly depicted as antiferromagnetic coupling. Introduction In the last few decades, with the rapid development of coordination polymers, the selective introduction of d- and f -block metal ions into the same supramolecular entity has led to a wide variety of heteronuclear coordination polymers and has attracted special attention, due to their diversiﬁed and tunable frameworks or elec- tronic structures1 and versatile applications as functional materials in magnetism,2 luminescence,3 adsorption,4 catalysis5 and others.6 Among all the heteronuclear ediﬁces, the majority are associated with Cu–Ln systems,7–9 which contain one-dimensional chains and ladders,7 two-dimensional grids8 and three-dimensional porous networks and interpenetrated modes,9 while a few with Mn– Ln,10 Ni–Ln,11 Cr–Ln,12 Fe–Ln,13,14 Co–Ln,15,16 Zn–Ln16d,17 and some 4d-4f 18 or 5d-4f 19 systems are reported.

FeII is easily oxidized to FeIII under normal conditions, especially in water solution. If FeII need to be incorporated into the framework of a coordination polymer, normally, the reaction should be progressed without oxygen. Furthermore, FeII (d6) displays two different electronic conﬁgurations in pseudo-octahedral surroundings: diamagnetic low-spin state (1A1) and paramagnetic high-spin state (5T2).20 With the competitive reaction between FeII and LnIII with organic linkers, it is extremely arduous to construct heteronuclear coor- dination polymers containing both FeII and LnIII. As far as we know, the literature reporting several discrete dimetallic examples comprising high-spin FeII and LnIII ions, is rare.14b–d CoII (d7) is the neighbor of FeII, and comparatively stable in contrast to FeII. Usually, CoII ion possesses a ﬁrst-order orbital momentum with magnetic anisotropy when it is in pseudo-octahedral surroundings, and it has been researched in complexes for a long time for its unique magnetic property. When combining CoII and LnIII ions into one system, the resultant system may exhibit unique magnetic properties differing from that of the homometallic system, but for This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Dalton Trans., 2011, 40, 805–819 | 805 Downloaded on 18 March 2013 Published on 13 December 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C0DT00516A View Article Online / Journal Homepage / Table of Contents for this issue both their orbital contribution/single ion behaviour, the magnetic interactions are always extremely difﬁcult to interpret. Thus, Co– Ln systems are an interesting but less developed ﬁeld for chemical researchers. As reviewed by Shore and coworkers,21 the [M-linkers-Ln] system is one type of existing d-f coordination polymer. The class of [M–CN–Ln] is the pioneer traced back to 1916,22 and [M–CO– Ln] is another group developed later in the 1970s.23 Subsequently, carboxylic acids, amino acids, bipyridyl, and other multidentate ligands were used to bridge d- and f -metal ions.24 Among them, pyridine carboxylic acids have been found to be good linkers between d- and f -metal ions.25 There are three interesting char- acteristics of this kind of ligands: i) the carboxyl groups provide rich binding coordination modes to connect different metal ions; ii) the rigid pyridine rings can assist in the generation of non- interpenetrated structures; iii) since the carboxyl groups can rotate in a limited way, they may link metal ions in different directions, resulting in various fascinating topologies. For example, Hong and coworkers made some strides toward the d-f coordination polymers based on pyridine carboxylic acids (such as pyridine- 2,5-dicarboxylic acid, pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid),7b,24b,26 and Yang and coworkers construct multinuclear Cu–Ln coordination polymers employing the rigid isonicotinic acid as ligand.27 Our group also made some contributions on the assembly of pyridine dicarboxylic acid, d- and f -metal ions.10d–g,17c Considering the above lines and inspired by our previous work, we chose FeII as d-metal ions to built d-f heterometallic coordi- nation polymers, and excitingly, high-spin FeII was successfully introduced into d-f systems under harsh hydrothermal condi- tions, resulting in nine 3D porous [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] coordination polymers with formula-{[Fe3Ln2(L1)6(H2O)6]·xH2O}n (Ln = Pr- Er; 1–9) (L1 = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate anions). If the high-spin FeII is replaced by CoII, what would happen in the structure? As a result, a series of [CoII–L1–LnIII] coordination polymers -{[Co3Ln2(L1)6(H2O)6]·yH2O}n (Ln = Pr-Dy, Yb; 10–17) were obtained, which is isomorphous to the series of [FeII HS–L1– LnIII]. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether the HO- substituted ligand would affect the structure, and then we chose 4-hydroxyl-pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (H3L2) instead of H2L1 as ligand to synthesize Co–Ln complexes, resulting in a series of 2D coordination polymers-{[Co2Ln(L2)(HL2)2(H2O)7]·zH2O}n (Ln = Eu-Yb; 18–25) based on double-stranded helical motifs. 4–6, 11 and 14 appearing in this paper have already been published elsewhere as communications.28 We now present these coordination polymers as a part of our work to systematically compare and investigate the structures and properties of three series of coordination polymers, and expect to provide some insight into further construction of d-f coordination polymers with novel luminescent and magnetic or other potential properties. Experimental section Materials and physical techniques All reagents and solvents employed were commercially available and used as received without further puriﬁcation. Elemental analyses for C, H and N were carried out by using a Perkin–Elmer analyzer. Thermal analyses (under oxygenated atmosphere, heat- ing rate of 10 ◦C min-1) were carried out in a Labsys NETZSCH TG 209 Setaram apparatus. XPS spectra were recorded using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD multi-technique X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy employing a monochromated Al-Ka X-ray source. The M¨ossbauer spectra were measured by an Oxford MS-500 model constant acceleration M¨ossbauer spectrometer with a 1024 multichannel analyzer. The velocity was calibrated by an a-Fe foil. The radiation source was 57Co/Rh. A xenon (methane) proportional counter was used as a detector. Computer ﬁts were performed to all measured data. The ﬂuorescent spectra of 3, 4, 6 and 7 were measured on a WFY-10 spectrometer and those of 12, 13, 15 and 16 on a Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrophotometer. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibilities were measured on a Quantum Design MPMS- 7 SQUID magnetometer. Diamagnetic corrections were applied with Pascal’s constants for all the constituent atoms.

The [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] Scheme 1 Reaction scheme for the series of [FeII HS–L1–LnIII], [CoII–L1–LnIII] and [CoII–L2–LnIII]. coordination polymers were synthesized in a mixture of CH3CN and H2O, and CH3CN may play an important role in the survival of FeII ions under harsh hydrothermal conditions. In all the reactions, lanthanide oxide/hydroxide or cobalt oxide were used as base to neutralize acidic ligands, and then the deprotonated carboxylate groups were easy to bond to metal ions. The structural determinations of 1–3, 8–10, 12, 13 and 15– 25 were performed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses, and for 7 we did not collect the crystallographic data due to the small crystalline samples. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern displayed that 7 was isostructural to other [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] analogues, and elemental and thermogravimetric analyses can de- termine the lattice water molecules, displaying eight uncoordinated water molecules per [Fe3Dy2] unit (see Supporting Information, ESI†).

Article Online Structural description of [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] and [CoII–L1–LnIII] coordination polymers Well-grown crystals of [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] and [CoII–L1–LnIII] co- ordination polymers suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction study are obtained by using hydrothermal synthesis, and the results show that two series of coordination polymers are isomorphous, which crystallize in the hexagonal system, P6/mcc space group. We chose polymer 1-[FeII HS–L1–PrIII] as a representative to depict this structure brieﬂy, and compare the difference between these isostructural polymers. Fig. 1 shows the coordination environ- ments of FeII HS, PrIII ions and the building units in 1. Each PrIII ion coordinates with three tridentate L1, forming the building block-[Pr(L1)3], and PrIII ion lies on the intersection of three- and two-fold axes. The remaining coordination sites in Pr(L1)3 coordinate to FeII ions and the bridging carboxyl groups adopt syn-anti bidentate mode. The coordination environment of FeII HS ion consists of four carboxylate O atoms and two water molecules, forming another building block-[FeO4(H2O)2], and FeII HS ion lies on the intersection of a two-fold axis and a mirror plane. The over- all framework can be viewed as the self-assembly of two different types of building blocks-[Pr(L1)3] and [FeO4(H2O)2]. Each [Pr(L1)3] is surrounded by six [FeO4(H2O)2] in its vicinity, while each [FeO4(H2O)2] has four [Pr(L1)3] as the nearest neighbors, and the linkers are carboxyl groups. As a result of this connection, [Pr(L1)3] and [FeO4(H2O)2] building blocks are arrayed alternately by carboxyl groups, forming the 3D porous framework similar to those of the reported [MnII–L1–LnIII],10d–g and the 1D channel extends along the c axis (Fig. 2a). The walls of the 1D channel are constructed by FeII HS and PrIII ions with Fe–OCO–Pr connection, and the distance between FeII HS and PrIII ions is 5.898 A˚ , while the diameter of the 1D channel is 17.91 A˚ (deﬁned by the separation between two opposite PrIII ions). Furthermore, the wall of the 1D channel can be viewed as an inﬁnite interweaving left- and right- hand sextuple-stranded helix with the pitch of 46.062 A˚ , as shown in Fig. 2b.

Interestingly, the lattice water molecules are trapped in 1D channels of 1–17 (Fig. 3), and construct two types of “water” Table 4 Summary of “water” pipes in [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] and [CoII–L1– LnIII] series (1–17) (except for 7) [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 Type of “water” pipe (top) I I I II II II I I Type of “water” pipe (bottom) I I I I I II I II [CoII–L1–LnIII] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 pipes: type I, a centered single-wall “water” pipe (Fig. 3a); type II, a hollow single-wall “water” pipe (Fig. 3b), summarized in Table 4. Type I and II “water” pipes have been found in the analogous Mn–Ln polymers.10e,g In [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] and [CoII– L1–LnIII] coordination polymers, 1–3, 8–14 and 16 contain type I “water” pipes, while 4–6, 15 and 17 contain type II ones. The “water” pipe in the 1D channel is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between water molecules in the outer-wall pipe and the coordinated water molecules on FeII HS/CoII ions. Although there are a lot of water polymers encapsulated in the void spaces of coordination polymers reported,30 this phenomenon, presenting two types of “water” pipes in one structural system, is very rare. As shown in Table 5, the bond length of Fe–OW is longer than that of Fe–OC in the corresponding polymer, and then the coordination geometry of FeII HS ion is an elongated octahedron. The Ln–OC and Ln–N distances (except for 8) decrease with the decreasing radii of LnIII ion due to the lanthanide contraction effect, as do the Fe ◊◊◊Fe, Fe ◊◊◊Ln, Ln ◊◊◊Ln nonbonding sepa- rations and the diameters of 1D channels (except for 3 and 5). The similar phenomena is observed in the series of [CoII–L1–LnIII] coordination polymers with some irregularity (Table 6). Structural description of [CoII–L2–LnIII] coordination polymers While we investigated the coordination chemistry of H3L2 with CoII and LnIII, a series of isostructural [CoII–L2–LnIII] coordination polymers (18–25) were obtained. 18–25 crystallize in monoclinic system P21/c space group and display 2D-layer structures based on double-stranded helical motifs. Some of the coordinated water molecules in those polymers show a certain extent of disorder, which may originate from the poor single crystal quality. Here, the 2D-layer structure, represented by 18, is depicted in detail. As shown in Fig. 4, there are two crystallographically independent CoII ions, one EuIII ion, one L2 anion, two HL2 anions and seven coordinated water molecules. Both Co1 and Co2 ions are six-coordinated with O atoms to form distorted octahedral geometries. The coordination environment of Co1 consists of one hydroxyl group, two carboxylic O atoms and three water molecules, while that of Co2 is constructed of two carboxylic O atoms and four water molecules. Eu1 center is nine-coordinated with a tricapped trigonal prismy geometry, and surrounded by one L2 and two HL2 anions in tridentate chelated mode. L2 and HL2 anions show different bonding modes to connect metal ions, L2 adopts tridentate mode, while HL2 with bidentate and tridentate modes (Scheme 2). As a result, each Eu1 center connects ﬁve Co ions (three Co1 and two Co2) through four carboxyl groups and one L2 anions, while Co1 and Co2 have three and two Eu1 ions as the nearest neighbors, respectively. Ignoring the bonding of hydroxyl group, CoII ions are bridged by carboxyl groups to form a right-/left-hand (P/M) double- stranded helix with a pitch of 17.95 A˚ , while EuIII ions act as This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Dalton Trans., 2011, 40, 805–819 | 809 Downloaded on 18 March 2013 Published on 13 December 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C0DT00516A View Article Online Fig. 2 (a) The 3D porous structure showing 1D channel along c direction in 1; (b) the wall of 1D channel consisted of interweaving left- and right-hand sextuple-stranded helixes.

P- and M-helixes are connected alternately by Co1–OH bonds to form a 2D layer (Fig. 5b), which exhibits the achirality of this polymer, conﬁrmed by the result of single-crystal X-ray analysis. Furthermore, the uncoordinated hydroxyl groups provide rich hydrogen bonding donors, while the coordinated hydroxyl oxygen atoms act as acceptors, and then the 2D layer is further assembled into a 3D porous structure with 1D channels along the a direction (Fig. 5c). The separation of O ◊◊◊O is 2.639 A˚ with angle of O–H ◊◊◊O of 177.90◦, and the details of intermolecular hydrogen bonds associated with [CoII–L2–LnIII] coordination polymers are listed in Table 7. The lattice water molecules in 18 construct an inﬁnite “water” tape through hydrogen bonds along the a direction, and the repeated unit is a (H2O)18 cluster involving a (H2O)12 cycle (Fig. 6a). The “water” tape is only well deﬁned in 18, whereas in 19–25 the water content was found to vary and the electron density in the channels was found to be quite diffuse making it difﬁcult to locate water molecules unambiguously so that only the major water sites were included in the models. The O ◊◊◊O distances are in the range of 2.742–3.054 A˚ , comparable to 2.759 A˚ in ice I h and 2.85 A˚ in liquid water.31 Each 1D channel is threaded by a “water” tape, resulting in a host–guest 3D framework (Fig. 6b). Meanwhile, the water molecules in the “water” tapes are further stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with the channel, and the shape of the “water” tape closely follows that of the host channel, indicating a complimentary relationship between the guest and host in 18. The average bond lengths associated with Co and Ln atoms (A˚ ) in the series of [CoII–L2–LnIII] coordination polymers are listed in Table 8. The Co–OC distance is much longer than that of Co– OW or Co–OH, and the bond length of Co–OH is the shortest one in the corresponding polymers. The Ln–OC and Ln–N distances decrease with the decreasing lanthanide ionic radii in the whole series, although with some irregularity. In the previous work of our group, the combination of H3L2 with MnII/ZnII and LnIII resulted in 2D honeycomb-type Mn/Zn–Ln coordination polymers,10g,17c in which, all the hydroxyl groups did not coordinate to metal ions and were directed towards to the center of the cavity, resulting in a honeycomb structure with C3 symmetry. The structure of [CoII–L2–LnIII] coordination polymers is a 2D layer constructed through coordination bonds, while par- tial hydroxyl groups coordinate to CoII ions, which is completely different from those of Mn/Zn–Ln coordination polymers, and the coordinated and uncoordinated hydroxyl groups in [CoII–L2– LnIII] coordination polymers provide rich hydrogen bonds, which link the 2D layers into a 3D porous network. Thermogravimetric and elemental analyses For the series of [FeII HS–L1–LnIII], [CoII–L1–LnIII] and [CoII–L2– LnIII] coordination polymers are isostructural, respectively, 2, 12 and 23 were selected for thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) to examine the thermal stability of the present structures. TGA curves for 2, 12 and 23 are shown in Fig. 7. The results of 2 and 12 are very similar for their isomorphous structures, and show two steps of weight loss below 300 ◦C. The ﬁrst weight loss occurred in the range of 25–140 ◦C, corresponding to the uncoordinated water molecules, which includes the lattice and adsorbed water molecules. Taking account of the large pores in [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] and [CoII–L1–LnIII] series, 2 and 12 possibly adsorb some water molecules at room temperature, which is also conﬁrmed by the elemental analyses (Table 1). Each molecule in the [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] and [CoII–L1–LnIII] series adsorbs some molecules to achieve saturation, the difference between [FeII HS– L1–LnIII] and [CoII–L1–LnIII] series is the number of uncoordinated water molecules at saturation: eight for [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] and nine for [CoII–L1–LnIII]. We chose the [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] series to do the comparable experiments, and the elemental analysis of 2 is performed on the crystalline samples without drying, while others are performed after vacuum drying.

The ﬁrst weight losses are 8.73% for 2 (calculated 8.57% for 2·H2O) and 9.38% for 12 (calculated 9.32% for 12·2H2O), indicative of adsorbing one water molecule per [Fe3Nd2] unit of 2 and two water molecules per [Co3Sm2] unit of 12. Namely, the ﬁrst weight losses for 2 and 12 correspond to uncoordinated and adsorbed water molecules, which are conﬁrmed by the elemental analyses (Table 1).

The frameworks of 2 and 12 collapsed at 400 ◦C. For 23, the weight loss between 25–250 ◦C is 24.28%, which can be ascribed to all water molecules (coordinated and uncoordinated). Above 300 ◦C, 23 was gradually decomposed into oxide. X-ray electronic spectroscopy (XPS) From single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses and charge balance consideration, Fe centers should be divalent in 1–9. X-ray elec- tronic spectroscopy (XPS) has been recorded at room temperature on crystalline sample of 9 to determine the oxidation state of Fe centers (see ESI†). The peak at 708.6 eV corresponds to the Fe(2p) binding energy, which matches well with the literature value of FeII,32 proving that the Fe center in 9 is FeII but not FeIII. M¨ossbauer spectroscopy Although the single-crystal data and XPS show that Fe centers in [FeII–L1–LnIII] coordination polymers are divalent, in order to further determine the oxidation and spin state of Fe centers in these coordination polymers, 2 was chosen as an example to study the M¨ossbauer spectroscopy. The M¨ossbauer spectra of 2 have been recorded at 298 and 82 K (Fig. 8) on crystalline samples, respectively, and both consist of a quadrupole-split doublet. At 298 K, the doublet of isomer shift value d = 1.27 mm s-1 and quadrupole-splitting value DEQ = 1.71 mm s-1 with a fairly narrow linewidth C = 0.14 mm s-1 is typical of high-spin divalent Fe atoms,33 while the observed doublet at 82 K with d = 1.39 mm s-1, DEQ = 2.25 mm s-1 and C = 0.18 mm s-1. Overall, these results indicate an S = 2 high-spin ground state FeII ion of 2 in the temperature range from 82 to 298 K, and the increase of the quadrupole splitting at low temperature may be ascribed to the population of the ﬁrst excited state of FeII ion. Luminescence properties Considering the excellent luminescent properties of SmIII, EuIII, TbIII and DyIII ions, the luminescences of eight polymers in the [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] and [CoII–L1–LnIII] series were studied at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 9 and 10, respectively.

When excited at 312 nm, 3 in DMF exhibits a broad strong peak around 450 nm, which can be ascribed to the intraligand transition of L1, and the typical emission of SmIII ion is present at 562, 598 and 645 nm, corresponding to 4G5/2→6H5/2, 4G5/2→6H7/2 and 4G5/2→6H9/2 transitions, respectively.34 The 4G5/2→6H7/2 transition is broad with a shoulder peak, indicating the transitions from 4G5/2 to Stark sublevels split by 6H7/2. The emission spectrum of 4 in DMF obtained upon irradiation at 304 nm is dominated by the intense hypersensitive EuIII (5D0→7F2) transition at 613 nm, and that of 6 upon 316 nm is dominated by the TbIII (5D4→7F5) transition at 546 nm, which have been reported previously, and it was found that 4 can act as a luminescent probe for Mg2+.28a For 814 | Dalton Trans., 2011, 40, 805–819 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Downloaded on 18 March 2013 Published on 13 December 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C0DT00516A View Article Online Fig. 9 Emission spectra of 3, 4 and 6 in DMF (left) and 7 in solid state (right) at room temperature. Fig. 10 Emission spectra of 12, 13, 15 and 16 in DMF at room temperature. 7, we did not observe the luminescence in DMF, and the emission spectrum in the solid state is depicted in Fig. 9 right. 7 displays the typical DyIII emission at 474, 560 and 662 nm, attributed to the characteristic emission of 4F9/2→6HJ (J = 15/2-11/2) transitions, respectively.35 The L1-base emission is not observed in 4, 6 and 7, and the intense emission indicates the efﬁcient energy transfer from L1 to EuIII, TbIII and DyIII centers. 12 emits the typical SmIII luminescence excited at 270 nm, and exhibits the characteristic transitions of 4G5/2→6HJ (J = 5/2-11/2) at 566, 600, 647 and 710 nm, respectively.34 The same with that of 3, the 4G5/2→6H7/2 transition is split into two peaks, indicative of the transitions from 4G5/2 to Stark sublevels. The emission spectrum of 13 in DMF arises from 5D0→7FJ (J = 1–4) under excited at 280 nm, typical of EuIII ion: 5D0→7F1 (593 nm), 5D0→7F2 (612 nm), 5D0→7F3 (650 nm), 5D0→7F4 (698 nm).36 The most intense emission is the 5D0→7F2 transition, which arises from the electric dipole moment and is hypersensitive to the environment of the EuIII ion. The 5D0→7F1 transition from magnetic dipole is also present, and is less intense than 5D0→7F2, indicating the absence of inversion symmetry at the EuIII center.37 Obviously, all the transitions are broadened with shoulder peaks, and this can be ascribed to the splitting of 7FJ on the effect of crystal-ﬁeld. For 15, when excited at 280 nm, the characteristic TbIII centered transition peaks are observed at 491, 545, 586 and 624 nm ascribed to 5D4→7FJ (J = 6–3), respectively. The dominant emission is 5D4→7F5 transition, which gives an intense green luminescence.38 When 16 in DMF was excited at 280 nm, it gave a typical DyIII emission spectrum. Two dominant emissions at 487 and 577 nm correspond to 4F9/2→6H15/2 and 4F9/2→6H13/2 transitions, respectively, and the weak emission at 663 nm is ascribed to the 4F9/2→6H11/2 transition.35 The absence of the L1-based emission in the spectra of 12, 13, 15 and 16 suggests the effective energy transfer from L1 to LnIII centers. Inspired by the luminescent selectivity of 4 for Mg2+, we wondered whether polymers in the [CoII–L2–LnIII] series would provide potential candidates for luminescent probe of divalent metal ions. Thus, the introduction of metal ions (such as Mg2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Ca2+) into 12, 13, 15 and 16 systems are carried out, which leads to weakening or even quenching of the lanthanide luminescence of corresponding system, and no luminescent probe is found (see ESI). The luminescent properties of isomorphous [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] and [CoII–L1–LnIII] series show differences: i) the emission spec- trum of [FeII HS–L1–SmIII] (3) displays strong intraligand transition, while that of [CoII–L1–SmIII] (12) does not exhibit this transition, indicative of the inefﬁcient energy transferring from L1 to SmIII ion, and then result in the strong intraligand transition of L1; ii) [FeII HS–L1–EuIII] (4) displays luminescent selective detection of Mg2+, and no polymer in [CoII–L1–LnIII] series acts as luminescent probes; iii) for [FeII–L1–DyIII] (16), there is no emission peak observed in DMF, which maybe attribute to the effect of solvent or FeII HS ion to the luminescence of DyIII ion in DMF. Considering the [MnII–L1–LnIII] analogous, the [MnII/FeII HS/CoII–L1–LnIII] systems display signiﬁcant differences in luminescent selectivity for bivalent metal ions (such as Zn2+, Mg2+) (Table 9), in which [MnII–L1–EuIII/TbIII] act as luminescent probe for Zn2+,10f and [MnII–L1–DyIII] for Mg2+,10g [FeII HS–L1–EuIII] shows luminescent selective detection of Mg2+,28a and none of [CoII–L1–LnIII] exhibits this behavior (see ESI). As some reports have depicted that the luminescence arising from the lanthanide ions was directly modulated by the presence of the d-metal ions in solution,39 it is possible that d-metal ions in d-f systems have the same This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Dalton Trans., 2011, 40, 805–819 | 815 Downloaded on 18 March 2013 Published on 13 December 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C0DT00516A View Article Online Table 9 Effect of Zn2+ and Mg2+ on the luminescent intensity of [MnII–L1–LnIII], [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] and [CoII–L1–LnIII] series (‘↑’, increase; ‘↓’, decrease; ‘=‘, equal) Mn–Eu Fe–Eu Co–Eu Mn–Tb Fe–Tb Co–Tb Mn–Dy Co–Dy Zn2+ ↑ ↓ ↓ ↑ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ Mg2+ ↓ ↑ = ↓ = = ↑ ↓ Luminescent selectivity Zn2+ Mg2+ Zn2+ Mg2+ behavior to modulate the luminescence of lanthanide ions. Viewing the structural characteristics, [MnII/FeII HS/CoII–L1–LnIII] systems display similar 3D porous networks with 1D nanotubes, when the lanthanide ions are uniform, and the difference among the networks is d-metal ions. For example, [MnII–L1–EuIII],10f [FeII HS– L1–EuIII] (4) and [CoII–L1–EuIII] (13) polymers contain the same LnIII ions, while the d-metal ions in their networks are MnII, FeII HS and CoII, respectively. The luminescent intensity of [MnII–L1– EuIII] increases signiﬁcantly upon adding Zn2+ and decreases upon adding Mg2+, showing luminescent selectivity for Zn2+, and [FeII HS– L1–EuIII] (4) displays the contrary behavior with luminescent selectivity for Mg2+, while that of [CoII–L1–EuIII] (13) decreases and maintains upon adding Zn2+ and Mg2+, respectively. The results indicated that the d-metal ions (MnII, FeII HS and CoII) in the networks may play an important role in the luminescent selectivity of [MnII/FeII HS/CoII–L1–LnIII] systems for different guest ions. We also investigated the luminescence of [CoII–L2–LnIII] coor- dination polymers (18, 20 and 21), however, the luminescence of lanthanide ions is quenched, either in DMF or in solid state, which maybe ascribe to the HO-substituted effect and/or the modulation of CoII ions to the luminescence of lanthanide ions. Magnetic properties The magnetic properties of heterometallic coordination poly- mers with lanthanide have been rarely investigated, due to the unquenched ﬁrst-order orbital momentum of lanthanide ions (except for GdIII) under ligand-ﬁeld effect. It is noted that the 4f n conﬁguration of LnIII ion is split into 2S+1LJ states by the interelectronic repulsion and spin–orbit coupling. Further splitting into Stark components (2J + 1 if n is even, J + 1/2 if n is odd) is caused by the crystal-ﬁeld perturbation, which depends on the symmetry site of the ion.40 Except for SmIII and EuIII, the 2S+1LJ ground state is well separated from the ﬁrst excited state. At room temperature, all the Stark levels arising from the n-fold degenerate 2S+1LJ ground state of LnIII ion, except GdIII ion with an f 7 electronic conﬁguration, are thermally populated. As the temperature is lowered, a progressive depopulation of these Stark sublevels takes place. When combined with d-metal ions, it is more complicated to interpret the magnetic nature between d- and f -metal ions, especially in multi-dimensional d–f structures, because the single ion behavior of f - and some d-metal (e.g. CoII) ions maybe shield the antiferromagentic or weak ferromagnetic coupling nature between them. Despite these aspects, heteromet- alllic d–f coordination polymers are of high interest in molecular magnetism, and we investigate the magnetic interaction between MnII and LnIII ions in [MnII–L2–HoIII/ErIII] coordination polymers using ZnII-diamagnetic ions substitution.17c Here we study the magnetic properties of these Fe/Co–Ln coordination polymers to make contributions to understand the magnetic interactions in d–f systems. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility data of polycrystalline samples of 3, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15–17 and 19–24 have been recorded at an applied magnetic ﬁeld of 1000 Oe in the temperature range of 2–303/300 K. The predicted and measured cMT values at room temperature and 2 K are detailed in Table 10. The plots of cMT versus T for 3, 6, 7 and 9 in [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] series are shown in Fig. 11, and the magnetic data also conﬁrm the high-spin FeII ions. The proﬁles of plots show the same feature, that is, a decrease in the values of cMT with lowing temperature, indicating similar magnetic behavior. The observed cMT value at room temperature for each polymer is very close to the theoretical value calculated for three isolated high-spin FeII (S = 2) and two LnIII ions in the ground states for 3 (6H5/2), 6 (7F6), 7 (6H15/2) and 9 (4I15/2), respectively (Table 10). When the temperature is lowered, the cMT values decrease slowly, until reaching minima at 2 K. This behavior may be due to the thermal depopulations of the Stark sublevels and/or exchange coupling between FeII HS and LnIII ions, thus, we can not deﬁnitely explain that antiferromagnetic interactions occur between FeII HS and LnIII ions only from the cMT values smoothly decreasing on cooling. Fig. 11 Plots of cMT versus T for 3, 6, 7 and 9 in [FeII HS–L1–LnIII] series. Fig. 12 depicts the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibilities for 13 and 15–17 in the [CoII–L1–LnIII] series. The experimental cMT value for 13 at room temperature (11.41 cm3 K mol-1) is much higher than the theoretical value (5.63 cm3 K mol-1) calculated for three uncoupled CoII ions (S = 3/2) and two EuIII ions in the ground state 7F0, originating from the magnetic contribution of the lower excited state 7FJ of EuIII ions and the orbit angular momentum of high-spin CoII ions in the octahedron.41 The energy of the lower excited state 7FJ is slightly higher than that of 816 | Dalton Trans., 2011, 40, 805–819 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Downloaded on 18 March 2013 Published on 13 December 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C0DT00516A View Article Online Table 10 Magnetic data extracted from the plots of cMT vs. T (under 1000 Oe) and the predicted cMT values for 3, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15–17 and 19–24 Calculated unit cMT (cm3 K mol-1) predicted at RT cMT (cm3 K mol-1) measured at 303 or 300 K cMT (cm3 K mol-1) measured at 2 K 3 [Fe3Sm2] 9.18 9.02 3.13 6 [Fe3Tb2] 32.62 32.06 6.79 7 [Fe3Dy2] 37.36 38.17 13.57 9 [Fe3Er2] 31.94 32.16 10.97 13 [Co3Eu2] 8.64 11.41 4.74 15 [Co3Tb2] 29.24 30.63 7.67 16 [Co3Dy2] 33.96 35.17 19.73 17 [Co3Yb2] 10.78 12.73 5.81 19 [Co2Gd] 11.69 12.98 8.82 20 [Co2Tb] 15.56 16.54 6.17 21 [Co2Dy] 17.93 18.92 14.19 22 [Co2Ho] 17.82 18.64 5.02 23 [Co2Er] 15.22 17.28 11.06 24 [Co2Tm] 10.89 11.68 3.75 Fig. 12 Plots of cMT versus T for 13 and 15–17 in the [CoII–L1–LnIII] series. the ground state 7F0; at room temperature the lower excited state 7FJ are thermally populated, and the contribution of the excited state can not be ignored. Therefore, the theoretical value of EuIII ions should be calculated by the van Vleck equation allowing for population of lower excited state 7FJ and the experiential cMT value of one uncoupled EuIII ion is 1.5 cm3 K mol-1. The experimental cMT values for 15–17 at room temperature are slightly higher than the theoretical values calculated for three uncoupled high-spin CoII ions (S = 3/2) and two LnIII ions in the ground state for 15 (7F6), 16 (6H15/2) and 17 (2F7/2), respectively (Table 10), indicative of the typical contribution of the orbital momentum for the ground state 4T 1g of CoII ions.41 The cMT values gradually decrease with the lowering temperature, reaching minima at 2 K, respectively. The decrease in cMT values with cooling might be attributed to the single ion behavior of high-spin CoII and LnIII ions because of strong spin–orbit coupling and/or the antiferromagnetic intereaction between CoII and LnIII ions. Thus, the nature of magnetic interactions between CoII and LnIII ions are not explicitly determined. Fig. 13 shows the cMT versus T curves for 19–24, and the trend of the magnetization curves are similar. The measured cMT values for 19–24 at room temperature are in good agreement with the expected values calculated for two isolated high-spin CoII ions and Fig. 13 Plots of cMT versus T for 19–24 in [CoII–L2–LnIII] series. one LnIII ion, respectively (Table 10). As often reported in many CoII containing compounds,41 the cMT value at room temperature is usually higher than the expected spin-only one as a result of the orbital contribution of the high-spin CoII to the magnetism. The cMT values for 19–24 decrease slowly with lowering temperature, and reach minima at 2 K, respectively. Despite the decrease of cMT values on cooling, the nature of magnetic interactions between CoII and LnIII ions cannot be interpreted as antiferromagnetic coupling because of the strong spin–orbit coupling of CoII and LnIII ions. The magnetic behaviors of the d–f -metal system are com- plicated, due to the magnetic coupling of the paramagnetic transition-metal centers and strong spin–orbit coupling of the lanthanide ions under ligand-ﬁeld effect, furthermore, all coor- dination polymers in this paper exhibit 2D or even 3D networks. Thus, the magnetic coupling interactions between d- and f -metal ions in the series of [FeII HS–L1–LnIII], [CoII–L1–LnIII] and [CoII– L2–LnIII] coordination polymers are not explicitly characterized. Conclusion In summary, three series of 3d–4f heterometallic coordination polymers have been produced through selecting different d-metal ions or HO-substituted ligand.

When replacing high- spin FeII by CoII, a series of isomorphic 3D [CoII–L1–LnIII] coordination polymers are obtained, and the series of 2D [CoII– L2–LnIII] coordination polymers based on double-stranded helical motifs are fabricated by HO-substituted ligand with CoII and LnIII ions. In addition, the 3D porous coordination polymers contain two kinds of “water” pipes accommodated in 1D channels, showing fantastic ediﬁces. XPS, M¨ossbauer spectroscopy and magnetic data conﬁrm the oxidation and spin-state of Fe centers. The luminescent properties of [MII–L1–LnIII] are studied, and reveal that d-metal ions in the networks play an important role in the luminescent selectivity of [MII–L1–LnIII] for different guest ions. The complexities of d- and f -metal ions make the magnetic coupling nature difﬁcult to interpret, needing more efforts to understand the unfathomable ﬁeld. This work gives some insight into the synthesis of d–f heterometallic coordination polymers with excellent luminescent properties and more effort will be devoted to this ﬁeld for searching for multi-dimensional magnets.

Explanation to the alert level A in CheckCIF CIF files associated with the manuscript were checked by the program of ICUR, and the results exhibited that CIF files appeared some similar alerts level A. The alerts level A about the shorter inter O...O distances is related to the disordered lattice water molecules, and the isolate O atoms are lattice water molecules. 17 possess large 1D channel, therefore, an alert level A is related to this. To explain other alerts level A, taken 1 as an example, the shorter inter X…Y contact was found in the 1- CheckCIF. Actually, after these A-alerts were checked carefully, we will find that so called shorter inter X…Y contact should be wrongly determined by program. In 1, only half a molecule of ligand (L1) is crystallographically independent, as shown in following Figure S1 (left), and a complete L1 molecule is displayed by proper symmetry operation, shown in Figure S1 (right). As a result, the distances among different atoms intra a molecule of L1, displaying in Figure 1(right), especially among six atoms from pyridine ring, were wrongly defined as A-alerts. The shorter inter H…H contact (such as 16) is also related to a complete coordinated water molecule by symmetry operation. ∗ To whom correspondence should be addressed.
