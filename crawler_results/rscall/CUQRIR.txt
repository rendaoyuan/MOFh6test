Introduction Flexible coordination polymers are particularly interesting crystalline materials, especially those showing external stimuli-induced reversible structural changes accompanied by photoluminescence responses.1–6 Their intrinsic structural flexibility makes them more promising in molecular recogni- tion and sensing.7–9 For example, CO2 adsorption can be converted into detectable photoluminescence signals by the incorporation of a fluorescent reporter, distyrylbenzene (DSB), into the flexible structure of Zn2Ĳbdc)2Ĳdabco);10 aromatics can be well decoded by interpenetrated dynamic frameworks because of distinct photoluminescence responses;11 the high efficient sensing of O2 can be directly achieved by a flexible ĳCuĲtez)]n.12 Up to now, several types of structures showing framework flexibility have been studied,13–19 in which most of them are exclusively connected via metal–carboxylate coordination bonds. However, it has been argued that these structures can be easily cleaved by H2O.20 Furthermore, even if these flexible frameworks are strong enough, there is still one challenge, which is the distinguishable photoluminescence response to a phase transformation.21,22 Generally, most of the phase transformations of MOFs are caused by the adjustment of the metal–carboxylate coordination angles.23 This change cannot lead to a sufficient change of the energy state because the coordinated carboxylate groups are separated with organic emitters by σ bonds (Scheme 1a). Polyazoheterocycles, such as pyrazoles, imidazoles, triazoles, and tetrazoles, are promising ligands to construct CrystEngComm This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015 a Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Catalysis and Innovative Materials, Department of Chemistry, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.

This characteristic no doubt makes the energy state of the metal–azolates more sensitive to the external stimuli-induced structural changes (Scheme 1b). Recently, we have reported a series of porous coordination polymers constructed from triazolate and carboxylate ligands.30–32 Encouraged by our previous works and taking the above mentioned issues in to consideration, we propose to construct flexible porous structures in which the structural flexibility originates from metal–azolates. In this paper, by combining a photoluminescent 2D metal–triazolate with photoluminescent stilbenedicarboxylic acid, a flexible and robust structure of {[Zn2Ĳdmtrz)2ĲL1)]·6H2O}n (MAC-11) (Hdmtrz = 3,5-dimethyl-1H,1,2,4-triazole, H2L1 = ĲE)-4,4′- stilbenedicarboxylic acid) has been successfully isolated, which is a self-catenated rob-type net built of 2D ĳZnĲdmtrz)] layers pillared by L1 ligands. It can retain its framework inte- grity in water, and shows a thermo/water-induced reversible phase transformation accompanied by a photoluminescence response from purple to blue. Furthermore, based on the iso- structure of {[Zn2Ĳdmtrz)2ĲL2)]·4H2O}n (MAC-13, H2L2 = ĲE)- azobenzene-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid), a pcu-type framework of {[Zn2Ĳtrz)2ĲL1)]·4H2O}n (MAC-14, Htrz = 1H, 1,2,4-triazole), and a layered structure of ĳZnĲdmtrz)ĲHCOO)] and the H2L1 ligand, the possible mechanism of the photoluminescence response to the reversible phase transformation was pro- posed for MAC-11. Experimental Materials and general characterization All of the chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and were used without further purification, except the Hdmtrz and H2L2 ligands, which were synthesized according to the previous literatures.33,34 FT-IR spectra were recorded using a Nicolet 470 FT-IR spectrometer in the range of 4000– 400 cm−1 with KBr pellets. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were measured using a Bruker D8 powder diffrac- tometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out using a TGA/SDTA 851 in the temperature range of 30–800 °C under a N2 flow with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Elemental analy- ses of C, H, and N were carried out using an Elementar Vario EL III. N2 sorption at 77 K was measured using an ASAP 2020 gas adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics). Before the gas adsorption, the as-made sample (about 100 mg) was activated in methanol solution for 2 h and then degassed at 50 °C for 8 h. Photoluminescence measurements were performed using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a monochromator (resolution: 0.2 nm) and a 150 W Xe lamp. Crystal data collection and refinement Data collection for MAC-11, MAC-13 and MAC-14 was carried out using a Bruker Apex Duo diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293(2) K, respectively. Data reduction was performed with SAINT, and empirical absorption corrections were applied by the SADABS program. Structures were solved by a direct method using the SHELXS program and refined with the SHELXL program.35,36 Heavy atoms and other non-hydrogen atoms were directly obtained from a difference Fourier map. Final refinements were performed by a full-matrix least-squares method with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms on F2. C-bonded H atoms were placed geometrically and refined as riding modes. H atoms of the lattice water were positioned from difference Fourier maps and then refined with a rigid mode.

View Article Online CrystEngComm This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015 Results and discussion The solvothermal reaction of ZnĲNO3)2, Hdmtrz and H2L1 in DMF solution with additional HNO3 and HBF4 leads to the formation of MAC-11. The side product of ĳZn2ĲL1)2H2O]n, which has a similar structure as the previously reported ĳZn2ĲL1)2ĲDMF)]n,37,38 could be obtained without the addition of acid (Fig. S1 and S2†). To isolate the pure crystal phase of MAC-11, several acid conditions have been tried, and a pure crystal phase without ĳZn2ĲL1)2H2O]n was finally obtained in the case of HNO3 (0.2 mL) and HBF4 (0.06 mL). MAC-11 and MAC-13 are isostructures (Table 1), only MAC-11 is described here in detail. Single-crystal diffraction studies revealed that MAC-11 crystallizes in a C2/c space group, being a monoclinic system. Two triazolate ligands coordinate to two Zn ions in a μ1,2- bridge mode, generating a Zn2Ĳdmtrz)2 dimer (Fig. 1, S3 and S4† for MAC-13). Then, the dimer unit propagates itself infi- nitely via ZnĲ1)–NĲ3) coordinative bonds, generating a 2D (4,4)-connected layer. The average Zn–N bond distance is 2.022 Å. The neighboring 2D layers are further connected together by L1 ligands, resulting in a three-dimensional (3D) lamellar structure with 1D channels along the c axis (Fig. 1b). Considering the Zn2Ĳdmtrz)2 dimer as a 6-connected node and the L1 ligand as a linear linker, MAC-11 can be consid- ered as a 6-connected framework with a vertex symbol of Table 1 Crystallographic data MAC-11 MAC-13 MAC-14 Formula C24H34N6O10Zn2 C22H28N8O8Zn2 C20H22N6O8Zn2 F.W./g mol−1 697.31 663.26 605.17 Temperature (K) 293(2) 293(2) 293(2) Wavelength (Å) 0.71073 0.71073 0.71073 Crystal system Monoclinic Monoclinic Monoclinic Space group C2/c C2/c C2/c a/Å 39.356(13) 38.503(5) 38.028(10) b/Å 9.332(3) 9.4511(12) 9.647(3) c/Å 9.842(3) 9.8023(13) 9.871(3) β/° 101.864(4) 100.578(2) 97.490(5) V/Å3 3538(2) 3506.4(8) 3590.3(18) Z 4 4 4 Dc/g cm−3 1.309 1.241 1.120 μ/mm−1 1.409 1.415 1.375 FĲ000) 1440 1328 1232 Total collected 8550 10 436 12 625 Unique data, RĲint) 3168, 0.021 3144, 0.059 4053, 0.042 Observed data [I > 2σĲI)] 2811 2249 3017 GOF on F2 1.10 1.12 1.15 R1,a wR2[I > 2σĲI)]b 0.0554, 0.1747 0.0618, 0.2442 0.0845, 0.2759 Peak and hole/e Å−3 −0.94, 1.13 −0.84, 1.38 −0.76, 1.36 a R1 = P‖Fo| −|Fc‖/P|Fo|. b wR2 = ĳPwĲFo 2 −Fc 2)2/PwĲFo 2)2]1/2.

Similar to that of MAC-11, MAC-14 is also built of two-dimensional Zn–triazolate layers and pillared by L1 ligands (Fig. 1 and S6†). Interestingly, considering the ĳZn2Ĳtrz)2] dimer as a 6-connected node, MAC-14 is a pcu-type net rather than a self-catenated rob net. Furthermore, their porous structures are confirmed by N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K, giving a BET (Langmuir) surface area of 722 (763), 719 (755) and 677 (831) m2 g−1 for MAC-11, MAC-13 and MAC-14, respectively (Fig. S5a†). The pore size is 5.9, 7.8 and 6.8 Å for MAC-11, MAC-13 and MAC-14 by the H–K method.39 Crystal phase transformation The PXRD pattern of MAC-11 matches well with the simu- lated one, confirming the pure crystal phase (Fig. 2). It can retain its framework integrity in different solvents, especially in water for at least two days (Fig. S7†), confirming its struc- tural stability. We ascribe the robust framework to its unique lamellar structure, in which the layer is formed exclusively by strong Zn–N bonds. TGA data (Fig. S8†) shows a 15.1% weight loss from 30 to 150 °C, which could be ascribed to the loss of crystalline water (15.5 wt%). After that it follows a pla- teau and then a huge weight loss is observed around 460 °C. Temperature-dependent PXRD from room temperature to 180 °C reveals a phase transformation occurring in the tempera- ture range of 60–90 °C. The diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.6° shifts to 2θ = 5.9° (MAC-11′). According to the index, the peak at 2θ = 4.6° is the reflection of the (200) plane, which belongs to the reflection of the 2D ĳZnĲdmtrz)] layers. The shortening of the interplanar distance (d) from 19.3 Å for MAC-11 to 15.2 Å for MAC-11′ suggests a thermo-induced compressed layer structure. Interestingly, MAC-11′ can be recovered to its origi- nal phase after being soaked in water, demonstrating a revers- ible phase transformation. Similarly, a thermo-induced phase transformation is also observed for MAC-13 (Fig. S9†). How- ever, there is no obvious phase transformation for MAC-14 (Fig. S10†). The different thermo-induced behaviours may be related to the different connection patterns of the pillar ligands to the 2D layers. In MAC-11 and MAC-13, the pillars connect to the neighbouring layers in an offset face-to-face mode and the carboxylate groups coordinate to Zn ions in a mono- dentate fashion. While in MAC-14, the pillars are perpendicu- lar to the layer and the carboxylates are bonded to the metal centers in a η1,2-mode. Photoluminescence response Upon excitation at λex = 369 nm (Fig. 3 and S11†), MAC-11 gives a broad emission with a maximum peak at λem = 418 nm (two shoulder emissions at 393 and 440 nm). When increasing the temperature to 60 °C, there is no obvious shift but a slight decay in its intensity (Fig. 3b). Further increasing the temperature to 90 °C results in an obvious shift being observed, which has a maximum peak at λem = 453 nm (with two shoulder emissions at 386 and 410 nm). The observable red-shift (35 nm) of the photoluminescence emission indi- cates a response to the structural transformation. Further- more, the fluorescence emission can be recovered to its origi- nal signal after the phase was recovered. As for MAC-13 (Fig. 3c), owing to the strong UV/Vis absorption of azobenzene, no obvious photoluminescence emission was detected. As for MAC-14, it has a maximum peak at 442 nm, with two shoulders at 384 and 407 nm. Different from that of MAC-11, no obvious photoluminescence emission shift has been observed for MAC-14 after heating the sample at 90 °C (Fig. S12d†).

To explore the possible mechanism, the photoluminescence properties of H2L1 and the 2D layer of ĳZnĲdmtrz)ĲHCOO)]n (ref. 40) were studied respectively (Fig. 3d, S12†). The emis- sion spectrum of H2L1 is located in the blue region (440–485 nm) with a maximum peak at 466 nm (a shoulder at 441 nm) upon excitation at 369 nm. This emission could be ascribed to the *π–π transition of the ligand. For the layer structure of ĳZnĲdmtrz)ĲHCOO)]n, the photoluminescence emission is located in the purple region (380–440 nm) with a maximum peak at 416 nm. This emission could be ascribed to the ligand-to-metal charge transition (LMCT). No obvious shift of the photoluminescence emission has been observed for either of them after they were treated at 90 °C for 30 min (Fig. S12a and b†). The mechanical mixture of H2L1 and ĳZnĲdmtrz)ĲHCOO)]n (in a mole ratio of 1 : 2) has also been explored, which gives an emission like H2L1 with a maximum peak at 464 nm (two shoulders at 408 and 443 nm). No obvi- ous shift of the emission has been detected after the mixture was heated at 90 °C for 30 min (Fig. S12c†). Since there is no obvious photoluminescence shift for MAC-14, the photoluminescence response to the phase trans- formation of MAC-11 is structurally related. Two possible approaches are proposed here: (i) the configurational adjust- ment of ligands in MAC-11 since it has two different configu- rations, trans- and cis-forms; (ii) the rearrangement of the 2D layer of ĳZnĲdmtrz)] to a more planar one. For case (i), it is well known that the thermal process can only trigger the transformation of L1 from the cis- to the trans-form rather than the trans- to the cis-form. Besides, the trans-form has a larger π-electron conjugation effect than the cis-one, this kind of transformation can only lead to a blue- rather than a red- shift of the photoluminescence emission. Therefore, case (i) should be excluded. For the case (ii), the 2D ĳZnĲdmtrz)] layer is required to be flexible, and then a thermo-induced phase transformation gives a more planar 2D layer. This rearrangement of the 2D layers could be accompanied by a slight red-shift of photoluminescence emission owing to an enhanced effect of π-electron conjugation. It has been con- firmed that the layered metal–triazolate structure is flexible enough to twist from being markedly corrugated to virtually planar,41 and parameters of ω, ϕ, and d are used to assess the state of the 2D layer (Fig. 4a and b). The smaller the parameter of omega and the larger the parameter of phi, the more planar the 2D layer will be. From Table 2, we can see that the 2D layer ĳZnĲdmtrz)] in MAC-11 has similar state with that of ĳZnĲdmtrz)ĲHCOO)], ĳZnĲdmtrz)Cl] and ĳCdĲdatrz)I]. These compounds have similar emission spectra with peaks around 410 nm.40 These results suggest that the emission spectra of MAC-11 may originate from the 2D layer of ĳZnĲdmtrz)].

View Article Online CrystEngComm This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015 of the pillar L1 ligands could not be excluded because of its slight broadening of the emission spectra. After a thermo- induced phase transformation from MAC-11 to MAC-11′, this photoluminescence emission turned quite similar to that of MAC-14. We assume that a thermo-treatment of MAC-11 leads to a decrease of the parameters, resulting in a more pla- nar 2D layer of ĳZnĲdmtrz)]. Therefore, a slight red-shift of the emission spectrum was observed. On the other hand, the vibration band at 1675 cm−1 disappeared from the FT-IR spectra when the phase turned from MAC-11 to MAC-11′. This disappearance indicates a change of the coordinated carboxylate from a mono-bridge (μ1) to a chelating (η1,2) mode (Fig. S13†), suggesting an enhanced interaction of the L1 ligands to the Zn centres. Therefore, the red-shift emis- sion of the 2D layer might further be overlaid with that of photoluminescence spectra of the stilbenedicarboxylate ligand, giving a maximum emission peak at 453 nm. Taking the structural differences of MAC-11 and MAC-14 in to con- sideration (Fig. 4c and d), the inclination state of the pillared L1 ligands and the flexible 2D layers make it possible for a thermo-induced phase transformation accompanied by a photoluminescence response for MAC-11. Conclusions In this paper, a flexible porous zinc-coordination polymer of MAC-11 showing a self-catenated rob-type net has been suc- cessfully synthesized, and an interesting photoluminescence response to a thermo-induced phase transformation has been observed and studied. The robust feature of MAC-11 can be ascribed to its unique layered structure, in which the layer is formed exclusively by Zn–triazolates. Since the π-conjugated triazolates are directly coordinated to metal ions, the thermo- induced phase transformation of the 2D Zn–triazolate layer to a more planar one could induce to a sufficient change of the energy state, resulting in a red-shift of the emission spec- tra. On the other hand, no obvious crystal phase and photo- luminescence transformation has been observed for the case of the pcu-type MAC-14, although it is built of similar photo- luminescent modules. So, our studies here not only give an example of a flexible coordination polymer showing a thermo/water-induced reversible structural-photoluminescence response, but, in addition, demonstrate that the framework type also plays a crucial role in affecting the structure- photoluminescence properties.
