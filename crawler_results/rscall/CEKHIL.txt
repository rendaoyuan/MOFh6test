Manuscript A 3-dimensional coordination polymer with a rare lonsdaleite topology constructed from a tetrahedral ligand{ Yang Zou,*a Chaoyong Yu,a Yuanyuan Lia and Myoung Soo Lah*b Received 10th July 2012, Accepted 4th September 2012 DOI: 10.1039/c2ce26109j A new 3D coordination polymer was solvothermally synthe- sized. The coordination polymer possesses a lon network built from 4-connecting Co2 clusters and tetracarboxylate ligands, and exhibits selective gas sorption behavior as well as antiferromagnetic interactions. Crystal engineering provides a powerful tool for the construction of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).1,2 Various organic ligands and secondary building units have been specifically designed for the synthesis of MOFs with desirable characteristics (gas storage/ separation,3 photoactive material,4 magnetism,5 catalysis,6 etc.). In particular, MOFs which have novel topologies and special applications attract the most attention. With the fundamental contributions by A. F. Wells, M. O’Keeffe and R. Robson,7 great efforts have been devoted to design and understand the network structure/topology of MOFs. Up to now, a large number of MOFs have been reported, while the large majority of 3-D MOFs with uninodal nets usually possess low connected structural topology and are dominated by the 4-connected nodes6a,7 such as diamond (dia), SrAl2 (sra), quartz (qtz), square (sql), NbO (nbo), CdSO4 (cds), and PtS (pts) net. From both zeolite chemistry and crystal engineering points of view, the frameworks built from 4-connected tetrahedral centers can generate larger cavities and bigger access windows than those based on octahedral centers and might result in 3D porous frameworks with a low framework density. So there has been increasing interest in the use of tetrahedral four- connected centers as basic structural units for the construction of open-framework materials. For tetrahedral nodes, two types of topologies are possible, namely, diamond (dia) and lonsdaleite (lon) nets.8 Although the two structures are composed of fused 6-membered rings, all such rings in diamond have the chair conformation while those in the lonsdaleite assume both chair and boat conformations. As the natural choice for porous material, the topology of dia networks is noticeably classic and widely reported in MOFs, whereas the lon network is still very difficult to realize in MOFs: this remains a great challenge.9 Meanwhile, surface modification is a useful tool for introdu- cing new functionalities for MOFs and received much attention. Recently several MOFs have been constructed with amide decorated multiple carboxylate ligands,10 which are proved to have guest-accessible functional amide sites in the channel and some materials show high CO2 adsorption capacities due to these functional groups.11 Given the above concerns, we prepared a new ligand containing four carboxylate groups as coordination sites and four amide groups as functional sites (bis-(3,5-dicarboxy-pheny1) terephthalamide, H4L Scheme 1). We expected that the amide groups might influence the gas sorption properties. Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of {[Co2(L)(H2O)3]?Sx}n (S is either DMF or water molecule and x is number of solvent molecules in the crystal) with a rare lon topology based on 4-connected Co2 cluster and nano-sized tetracarboxylate ligand. The use of a slight excess of cobalt nitrate combined with the ligand H4L in a solvent mixture of N,N9-dimethylformamide (DMF) and water (9 : 1) at 85 uC yielded blue crystals of {[Co2(L)(H2O)3]?Sx}n 1 (ESI{) after 5 days. 1 crystallizes in monoclinic space group P21, and the asymmetric unit consists of two crystallographically cobalt ions (Co1 and Co2) and one L ligand (Fig. S1, ESI{). The solvent molecules cannot be accurately determined, because of the badly disordered structure of them that are further treated by the Platon Squeeze program.12 Both of the Co ions are six-coordinated in an octahedral geometry, as depicted in Fig. 1b. The Co1 ion is surrounded by six oxygen atoms from aDepartment of Chemistry, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, 310018, China.

The equatorial plane of the Co2 ion is occupied by four oxygen atoms from two different carboxylates and two aqua molecules, the axial position is coordinated by the O atom from one carboxylate and one water molecule with Co–O distance 2.137(3), 2.111(2) A˚ . Each carboxyl group of L is deprotonated and adopts a bidentate bridging coordination mode connecting two six-coordinated Co atoms to generate the Co2(COO)4(H2O)3 SBUs with a Co–Co distance of 3.484(2) A˚ . Each bdc unit of the ligand links two such bimetal units. On the basis of the above connection modes, each ligand connects four adjacent dinuclear Co(II) units and can be simplified as a 4-connected node. Similarly, each dinuclear Co(II) unit connects four ligands and serves as a 4-connected node. Thus the framework has the lon topology (Fig. 1c,d), which has both chair and boat conformations in fused six-membered rings. Although both dia and lon topologies are expected to be energetically very similar, dia topology is overwhelmingly dominant for tetrahedral nodes based on the experimental results, which may be due to the fact that the dia network represents the simplest, highest symmetry structure (it is the only regular tetrahedral structure). So it is necessary to construct the lon structure by deconstructing the dia structure into more elaborate building blocks of chair and boat rings rather than of single tetrahedra.6a,8,13 The amide groups in the ligand increase the arms of the ligand, which could potentially generate a large inner cavity in a MOF, and also increase the flexibility of the ligand, which might help to form both the chair and boat conformations in the lon network. PLATON calculation suggests that the resulting effective free volume, after removal of guest DMF and water molecules, is 70.3% of the crystal volume (2305.2 A˚ 3 out of the 3281.3 A˚ 3 unit cell volume).14 Based on the crystallographic data and the van der Waals radii of atoms, the pore cross sections are calculated to be 11.0 6 5.3 A˚ 2 along the a axis in 1 (Fig. S2, ESI{). The thermal stability of fresh samples of 1 have been investigated and it was found to be stable up to 450 uC (Fig. S3, ESI{). TG analysis of complex 1 shows a first weight loss of 43.6% from 25 uC to 400 uC, corresponding to a loss of 4 DMF and 9 water molecules (calcd 43.2%). The second step from 460 uC to 478 uC is attributed to the decomposition of the L organic ligands. The remaining weight of 14.4% is likely to be that of CoO (calcd 14.2%). The PXRD patterns of 1 (Fig. S4, ESI{) show that the diffraction patterns are almost the same as the simulated ones, indicating the phase purity of the products. The differences in intensity may be due to the preferred orientation of the powder samples.15 The PXRD pattern of the desolvated sample 1a (under vacuum at 100 uC overnight after soaking in DMF for 1 day and then in MeOH for 7 days) exhibits a decrease in intensity, and the position of partial peaks change, suggesting that a crystal of the coordination network was gradually distorted as a result of the crystal transformation after the loss of coordinated solvent molecules.16 The seemingly high thermal stability of the framework of 1 inspires us to study its adsorption properties. Gas sorption experiments towards N2 at 77 K and CO2 at 195 K were carried Fig. 1 The crystal structure of 1 is composed of (a) ligand L42 and (b) binuclear cobalt cluster Co2 (COO)4(H2O)3 as tetranode, which assemble into (c) a network of lon topology.

As seen from Fig. 2, desolvated solid 1a adsorbs N2 gas to show a type I isotherm at low pressure, indicating the permanent microporosity of 1a. The gas sorption shows a little hysteresis between sorption–desorption curves and obvious capillary con- densation at relatively high pressure, suggesting a small amount of mesoporosity present in the desolvated material, which is attributed to nanosized intercrystalline voids or mesopores within the mosaic pseudomorphs that remain after desolvation.17 In total, 1 only adsorbs 110 cm3 g21 (STP) N2 at P/P0 = 0.9. The Langmuir surface area is estimated as 145.7 m2 g21 (BET 106.6 m2 g21) and the pore volume estimated by applying the t-Plot is merely 0.015563 cm3 g21. These results imply that the pores in 1a have been destroyed to a large extent during desolvation, showing obvious degradation of crystallinity and structural changes upon escape of solvent molecules. For CO2 uptake, the sorption increases abruptly at the beginning and reaches 186.8 cm3 g21 (STP) at P/P0 = 0.98. The gas sorption isotherms show distinct hysteresis between the adsorption–desorption curves, indicating strong interactions of CO2 molecules with the host solid 1a and apparent structural changes upon uptake of CO2. Solid-state magnetic susceptibility measurements for 1 were performed in the range of 3–300 K under a field of 100 Oe. The xM at 16–300 K displays a continuous slow increase with decrease of temperature and then sharply increase when lowering the temperature from 16 to 3 K (Fig. 3). At 3 K, the xM value is 0.803 cm3 mol21. The xMT value of 5.04 cm3 K mol21 per Co2 unit at 300 K is much larger than that (3.76 cm3 K mol21) expected for two magnetically isolated high-spin CoII ions with S = 3/2, due to the spin–orbit coupling at high temperature. Upon lowering the temperature, the xMT value first slowly decreases to about 50 K and then rapidly decreases to the value of 2.79 cm3 K mol21 at 3 K. The magnetic susceptibility from 50 K to 300 K obeys the Curie–Weiss law with a Weiss constant h of 216.6 K and a Curie constant C of 5.27 cm3 K mol21 (Fig. S5, ESI{). The decrease of the xMT value or the negative h value can be induced by antiferromagnetic coupling interactions within and between dimeric units as well as strong spin–orbit coupling. In order to estimate the strength of the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, the following simple phenomenological equation can be used, considering the strong spin–orbit coupling in this compound.18 xMT = Aexp(2E1/kT) + Bexp(2E2/kT) In this equation, A + B equals the Curie constant, E1 and E2 represent the activation energies corresponding to the spin–orbit coupling and the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, respectively. This equation is in good agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 3). The best fitting results are: A + B = 5.32 cm3 K mol21, E1/k = 50.6 K and 2E2/k = 20.62 K (R = g[(xMT)obs 2 (xMT)calc]2/g[(xMT)obs]2 = 3.8 6 1023). The obtained value of A + B is very close to that from the Curie–Weiss law equation (5.27 cm3 K mol21). The small E2 value indicates the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interaction.19 In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized a porous coordination polymer {[Co2(L)(H2O)3]?Sx}n, 1, using a amide linked tetracarboxylic ligand under solvothermal conditions. The framework of 1 is constructed from 4-connected tetrahedral L ligands and 4-connected Co2 clusters, forming a lonsdaleite network, one of rare topologies in MOFs. Besides the unusual topology, the desolvated solid 1a exhibits moderate CO2 uptake and the powder sample of 1 shows antiferromagnetic properties.

(C36H62N6O23Co2, fw = 1064.7): C, 40.61; H, 5.87; N, 7.89%. Found: C, 41.3; H, 5.69; N, 8.03%. Crystallographic data collections and refinements of structure A crystal was coated with paratone oil and the diffraction data were measured at 115 K on a Siemens SMART CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromatic Mo Ka (λ= 0.71073 Å). The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects (SAINT), and multi-scan absorption corrections based on equivalent reflections were applied (SADABS). Crystal structure of 1: Light blue block shaped crystal, 0.23 x 0.16 x 0.08 mm3, C48H57N4O36Co4, fw = 1501.70 g·mol–1, monoclinic, space group P21, a = 10.152(3) Å, b = 17.953(6) Å, c = 18.062(6) Å, β = 94.62(1)°,V = 3281.3(18) Å3, Z = 1, µ = 0.544 mm–1, 18179 reflections were collected, 11482 were unique [Rint = 0.065]. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least- squares on F2 (SHELXTL)2. The contributions of the disordered DMF molecules were removed from the diffraction data using the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON software.3 Since the DMF molecules are badly disordered, we can not find all DMF molecules and their exact location and amount, as well as the anisotropic refinement for this badly disordered solvent molecules seems also impossible. Thereby, in ‘1.cif’ file, we only defined partly solvent molecules that is refined by isotropic refinement, resulting in the high R1=0.1020 and ωR2=0.2662 values. Then, we carry out Platon Squeeze program towards these badly disordered solvent molecules, leading to the better R1=0.0547 and ωR2=0.1163 values, which is reported as ‘1squeeze.cif’ file.
