Manuscript Construction of Cu(II) coordination polymers based on semi-rigid tetrahedral pyridine ligands† Weiting Yang,a Fei-Yan Yi,a Xiao-Dong Li,b Lei Wang,a Song Danga and Zhong-Ming Sun*a The assembly of a Cu(II) ion and the semi-rigid tetrahedral pyridine ligand, tetrakis(3-pyridyloxymethylene) methane (L1), yields three coordination polymers (1–3) by synergy between diﬀerent solvent mixtures. Single crystal X-ray diﬀraction analyses reveal that Cu4(L1)(OAc)8 (1) features a two-dimensional sql network, and comprises dimeric ﬁve-coordinated Cu-centered square pyramids as the inorganic building units; Cu2(L1)(C7H5O2)4 (2) is also a layered assembly but with a 3,4-connected 3,4L13 net. In this complex, mononuclear CuO2N2 square planar structures and dinuclear CuO3N2 square pyramids both serve as the inorganic building units. Cu(H2O)2(L1)(OAc)2 (3) is a three-dimensional framework structure based on six-coordinated CuO2N4 square bipyramidal inorganic nodes and tetrahedral semi-rigid pyridine ligands, and dia topology is simpliﬁed for 3. Introduction Coordination polymers (CPs) or metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline hybrid materials constructed from the limitless choice of metal ion connectors and poly- dentate organic bridging ligands. Their high surface area, low framework density and well-dened porosity make them good candidates for capturing energy-related gas, such as H2, CH4 and CO2.1 Alongside the major interest in gas storage, other extensive applications of MOFs have gradually begun to ourish in a wide range of elds, including molecular separa- tion,2 heterogeneous catalysis,3 nonlinear optics,4 drug delivery5 and chemical sensing.6 The development of MOFs for this increasing number of applications is heavily reliant on their fantastic chemical and physical properties which are imparted by the sophisticated and nuanced modulation and functionality of the inorganic vertices and the organic connectors. Among the various organic ligands for construction of CPs, oxygen- and nitrogen-donor bridging species are dominant, such as carboxylic acids,7 pyridine derivatives8 and so on. In addition, most of the organic linkers reported so far are rigid. In contrast, CPs constructed with exible ligands have been less documented partially due to their inability to maintain their structural geometries during the self-assembly process. However, exibility of the ligands is essential to form certain structures with particular properties as the dynamic frame- work in response to external stimuli, such as gate-opening behaviour.9 Our recent eﬀorts in preparing CPs have been devoted to isolating novel frameworks based on semi-rigid tri- , tetra- and hexacarboxylate linkers, and a series of interesting MOFs with various properties including chirality, magnetism, luminescence, and nonlinear optical and sensing properties have been obtained.10 As an ongoing work, a semi-rigid tetrahedral linker, tetrakis(3-pyridyloxymethylene)methane (L1) was selected to construct CPs in this contribution (Scheme 1). Two layered structures, Cu4(L1)(OAc)8 (1) and Cu2(L1)(C7H5O2)4 (2), and one four-connected open frame- work, Cu(H2O)2(L1)(OAc)2 (3), have been obtained. We herein report the syntheses, structures and characterizations of these compounds.

The ligand L1 was synthesized according to the documented procedures.11 X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRD) data were collected on a D8 Focus (Bruker) diﬀractometer at 40 kV and 30 mA with mono- chromated Cu Ka radiation (l ¼ 1.5405 ˚A), a scan speed of 5 degrees per min and a step size of 0.02 in 2 theta. The elemental analyses of C, H, and N were conducted on a Perkin- Elmer Optima 3300DV spectrometer and a Perkin-Elmer 2400 elemental analyzer, respectively. Thermogravimetric and diﬀerential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) data were recorded on a Thermal Analysis Instrument (SDT 2960, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) from room temperature to 800 C with a heating rate of 10 C min1 under an air atmosphere. Syntheses Synthesis of Cu4(L1)(OAc)8 (1): a solution of Cu(OAc)2$H2O (33 mg, 0.18 mmol) in MeOH (4 mL) was placed in a test tube, and a mixture of MeOH and EtOH (6 mL, 1 : 1 v/v) was carefully layered on top. A solution of L1 (40 mg, 0.09 mmol) in EtOH (2 mL) was then added on top of these two layers. Then, the tube was sealed, and the contents were allowed to mix slowly. Aer 24 hours, blue crystals were obtained. Yield: 22 mg (42% based on Cu). Anal. calcd (%) for 1 C41H60Cu4N4O26 (Mr ¼ 1279.09): C, 38.5; H, 4.73; N, 4.38. Found: C, 40.67; H, 4.67; N, 4.43.

X-ray crystallography study Single crystals of 1–3 with suitable dimensions were selected for single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analyses. Data collections were performed on a Rigaku RAXIS-RAPID diﬀractometer equipped with graphite-monochromated Mo Ka radiation (l ¼ 0.71073 ˚A) at a temperature of 293 K. Data reductions and absorption corrections were performed using the SAINT and SADABS so- ware packages, respectively.12 The structures were solved by direct methods and rened on F2 by full-matrix least-squares using SHELXTL-97 crystallographic soware package.13 All of the non-hydrogen atoms were found from the diﬀerence Fourier map and rened anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms associ- ated with the organic ligands were generated geometrically and included in the renement with xed positions and thermal parameters. Element analyses and thermogravimetric analysis implied the existence of extra-framework acetate groups and water molecules which could not be located in the diﬀerence Fourier maps derived from single crystal data and were removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON.14 Eﬀorts to obtain better crystal data have failed. Further details of the structure analyses are listed in Table 1. The selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table S1.† The powder X-ray diﬀractions of these compounds conrm the phase purity (see ESI Fig. S1–S3†). Results and discussion Syntheses Compound 1 was synthesized by slow diﬀusion of Cu(OAc)2 and L1 into a mixture of methanol and ethanol. When water was used instead of ethanol, Cu(H2O)2(L1) with a 3-D framework network was formed, which is isostructural to that reported by Kitagawa et al.8a If a conventional solvothermal method was performed, no crystals of compound 1 were obtained. Compounds 2 and 3 were also synthesized with a L1 ligand, but with diﬀerent solvent mixtures (water and ethanol for 2, water and acetonitrile for 3). It is noted that additional acids are essential for crystallization of the two complexes, in that benzoate groups serve as co-ligands, coordinating to Cu ions in 2, and oxalic acid acts as a mineralizing agent and pH modu- lator in the synthesis of 3. Structure description of 1 The single-crystal diﬀraction analysis of compound 1 reveals that it crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P42/n. The asymmetric unit of 1 consists of one crystallographically independent Cu atom, one quarter of a L1 ligand and two coordinated acetate groups. As depicted in Fig. 1, the Cu atom is ve coordinated by four oxygen atoms from four acetate groups and by one nitrogen atom of L1, resulting in a distorted square pyramidal geometry. Two CuO4N square pyramids are connected to each other via four acetate groups to form a dinuclear Cu2 cluster. Each L1 ligand acts as a tetragonal linker, bridging four Cu2 dimers with a Cu–N distance of 2.1795(17) ˚A (Fig. 2). Such a connection between the dimetallic building units and the L1 ligands produces a 2-dimensional (2- D) layered structure which is further packed though p/p interactions to form the supramolecular network of compound 1 (Fig. 3). The semi-rigid L1 ligand can be considered as a 4- connected node connecting four Cu2 clusters according to topological analysis. Each dimetallic Cu2 building unit is connected to two L1 and transformed into the edge during simplication. Thus, the network of 1 features a uninodal sql plane net with a point symbol of {44.62}(Fig. S4†). 25066 | RSC Adv., 2013, 3, 25065–25070 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 RSC Advances Paper Published on 26 September 2013.

View Article Online Structure description of 2 This compound also possesses a 2-D structure, but crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1. There are two crystallographi- cally independent Cu atoms, one L1 ligand and four benzoate groups in its asymmetric unit (Fig. 4). Cu1 is four coordinated in a distorted square-planar geometry, by two N atoms from two L1, and two carboxylate O atoms from two benzoate groups (Cu– O: 1.939(3) and 1.950(3) ˚A, Cu–N: 2.012(4) and 2.0124(4) ˚A). Cu2 is ve-coordinated and displays a distorted pyramid geometry supplied by two N atoms from two L1 ligands (Cu–N: 2.012(4) and 2.025(4) ˚A) and three carboxylate O atoms from three benzoate groups (Cu2–O5: 1.983(3) ˚A, Cu2–O7: 1.960(4) ˚A, Cu2– O8: 2.316(4) ˚A). Two CuO3N2 square pyramids are connected to each other via two carboxylate groups in two benzoate ligands resulting in a dinuclear Cu2 cluster. The L1 ligand, as a four- connected node, links two Cu1 and two Cu2 atoms. One benzoate adopts a didentate coordination mode (O7, O8) to connect two Cu2 atoms. The other three benzoates are unidentate (O5, O10, O11) and each link one Cu atom. In compound 2, the Cu1-centered planes and the dinuclear Cu2 cluster are linked by L1 ligands to produce the 2-D layered assembly (Fig. 5). Such layers are stabilized by p/p interac- tions between the interlayers to form the whole structure of compound 2 (Fig. 6). Topological analysis reveals a 3,4L13 net with a point symbol of {4.62}2{42.62.82} (Fig. S5†). Structure description of 3 This compound crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4n2.

The Cu(II) ion is octahedrally coordinated by four N atoms of four L1 at equatorial positions (Cu1–N1: 2.024(2) ˚A) and two axial aqua ligands (Cu1–O1w: 2.488(3) ˚A) with Jahn– Teller distortion. Every L1 ligand links four Cu(II) ions to form a 3-D structure (Fig. 8). This structure contains rhombic channels along the [100] and [010] directions (6.5  6.5 ˚A C–C distance). Disordered acetates and free water molecules exist in the void space of this structure. The whole framework features a dia topology according to Topos analysis (Fig. S6†). To evaluate the porosity, potential solvent accessible void volume for compound 3 was calculated using PLATON soware,14 showing 53.5% pore spaces. Structure discussion As we know, Cu(II) usually adopts 4–6 coordination atoms, forming square-planar, square pyramidal and square bipyra- midal geometries. All three coordination modes have been observed in these title complexes. In 1, two Cu-centered square pyramids are condensed into one dimeric building unit, and simplied into a line and thus a uninodal sql plane net is formed. In 2, both the dimeric Cu2 cluster and square-planar CuO2N2 act as the inorganic building units, and the Cu-centered plane can be seen as a line, making the semi-rigid L1 a 3-con- nected node. At last, a 3,4L13 net is simplied. Complex 3, possessing a 3-D framework structure, features a mononuclear Fig. 3 The whole structure of 1 along the [010] direction showing the layer stacking.

In 3, both the tetrahedral linker L1 and the inorganic unit can be simplied by the same 4-connected nodes, and dia topology is obtained. Thermal stability of 1–3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies were performed to characterize the thermal stability of complexes 1–3 (Fig. 9). A continued weight loss of 11.4% was observed from room temperature (RT) to 120 C on the TGA curve of compound 1, this is due to the loss of lattice water molecules. Compound 1 is then stable up to 200 C, aer that it starts decomposing. The TGA curve of compound 2 shows a weight loss of about 8.9% from RT to 200 C, which is ascribed to water molecules being absorbed by the structure. Then, the compound starts degrad- ing. Compound 3 shows a continued weight loss of 14.7% before 100 C and then a 5.4% weight loss between 100 and 200 C is observed, indicating the removal of coordinated water molecules (calc. 5.46%). Aer that, the compound starts to decompose. Conclusions In summary, three new copper coordination polymers con- structed from the assembly of semi-rigid tetrahedral pyridine ligands with diﬀerent Cu-centered inorganic building units have been synthesized and characterized. These compounds represent diﬀerent structural arrangements: 1 is a layered structure with a sql net which comprises dimeric copper clus- ters as the units and acetate groups as the co-ligands and counter ions; 2 is also a 2-D assembly formed by square planar CuO2N4 and square pyramidal CuO3N2 polyhedra as well as L1 and benzoate groups. A 3,4-connected net (3,4L13) is simplied for 2; a 3-D framework structure of 3 contains channels along the [100] and [010] directions with dia topology. These results demonstrate that novel coordination polymer architectures will be achievable via modulation of the ligand, co-ligands and additives, as well as the synthetic conditions.
