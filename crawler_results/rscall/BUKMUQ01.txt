Titi, Ranjan Patra and Israel Goldberg* Nine new coordination polymers of 5-substituted nicotinic acid (with either –Br, HBNA, or –COOH, 3,5-H2PDC) with d-transition (Co, Ni, Zn and Cd) and f-lanthanoid (La, Ce, Sm and Tb) metal ions have been synthesized. The two metal complexes [Co2(BNA)4(H2O)]n·H2O (1a) and [Cd(BNA)2]n (1b) have polymorphic/isomeric structures to those of metal–organic-frameworks (MOFs) with similar structural building units (SBUs) reported earlier. Modified reaction conditions yielded new isomeric metal complexes in the present case. Reactions of the 3,5-H2PDC linker with different metal ions led to the formation of polymeric complexes [Mn3(3,5-PDC)3(DMA)3]n·DMA (2a), [Zn(3,5-PDC)(DMA)]n·DMA (2b) and [Cd2(3,5-PDC)2(DMA)4]n (2c), as well as lanthanoid MOFs [Sm(3,5-PDC)1.5(DMF)]n·DMF (2d, as well as isomorphous products with La (2f) and Ce (2g) ions) and [Tb2(3,5-PDC)3(DMF)2]n·DMF (2e). Networking diversity observed in these coordination polymers with the conformationally rigid 5-substituted nicotinic acid ligand is discussed. The magnetic properties of 2a, 2d and 2e have been studied as well. Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted a huge amount of interest during the last few decades not only because of their structural diversity, but also due to a large number of material applications.1 A large number of MOFs utilizing rigid as well as flexible ligands and exhibiting vari- ous network topologies are reported in the literature. In recent past, our group has been also involved in the study of MOFs with flexible ligands, containing both the pyridyl and carboxylate donor arms.2 As an extension of that project in this work we investigated the formation of coordination polymers with smaller but more rigid organic linkers as 5-bromonicotinic acid (HBNA) and 5-carboxynicotinic acid (3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic; H2PDC). Various polymeric assem- blies involving bromonicotinate (BNA) have been docu- mented in the literature.3 The present choice of this building unit has been made to explore the possibility of the bromine substituent to be involved in extra halogen bonding interac- tions in the formed networks, an issue not discussed in the previously reported structures. The tri-dentate 3,5-H2PDC ligand can readily coordinate to the d-block as well as f-block metal ions due to the presence of two carboxylic donor arms and one pyridyl arm to promote the formation of framework architectures. Despite the commercial availability of H2PDC only a small number of MOF structures of this ligand have been reported in the literature so far.4 Most recently, while our work was already in progress, the luminescent properties of some 3,5-PDC lanthanoid coordination polymeric com- plexes bearing glycolate or acetate as ancillary ligand have been published.5 This article deals with the synthesis, struc- ture, topology and magnetic properties of seven new coordi- nation polymers (1a–2e) with BNA and 3,5-PDC as linkers and various metal ion connectors (Scheme 1). Reactions of 3,5-H2PDC with La and Ce ions yielded MOFs 2f and 2g (respectively) which are isomorphous with that of 2d. They reveal however unique formation of metallogels when reacted with other solvents, the properties of which will be discussed in more detail in a separate publication.6 5244 | CrystEngComm, 2014, 16, 5244–5256 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 School of Chemistry, Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, 69978 Tel-Aviv, Israel.

The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 system spectrophotometer in ATR mode. The magnetic data were collected on a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID-XL-5 magnetometer using crushed single-crystal samples. Magnetic data were corrected for the diamagnetic contribution calculated from Pascal constants7 and a background of the sample holder. Complexes 1a–2e were prepared by solvothermal reactions as described below. All reactions with H2PDC were carried out using uniform 1 : 1 stoichiometry of the metal and ligand.

Though while working with the perchlorate compounds described here we have not met with any inci- dent, care should be taken in handling them as perchlorates are potentially explosive. These should not be prepared and stored in large amounts.

Complexes 1a and 1b show completely different structural behavior with respect to the previously reported MOFs, even though they possess similar structural building units (SBUs).10 In the earlier-reported examples the syntheses were carried out under aqueous conditions at 160 °C, as opposed to DMF solvation at 120 °C in the present case. Cor- respondingly, complexes 1a and 1b can be referred to as supramolecular isomers of the already published structures. Descriptions of the crystal structures can be simplified by using the node-and-linker approach in the TOPOS (v. 4.0) software.11 In the network structures shown below in the vari- ous figures, the metal and linker moieties are marked by blue and red color respectively. Crystal structure of 1a. With respect to the known anhydrous [Co(BNA)2(H2O)] MOF (solved in monoclinic C2/c),10 complex 1a crystallizes in monoclinic P21/n space group with two Co(II) ions, four BNA ligands, one coordinated water and one disordered free solvent water molecule. The two MOFs have exactly the same structural building unit (SBU) (Fig. 1a) with aquadicarboxylate triply-bridged Co(II) dimer connected by bidentate- and tridentate-bridging BNA with coordination mode μ2-κO:κN (Scheme 2a) and μ3-κO:κO:κN (Scheme 2b) respectively. The Co⋯Co distance within the dinuclear cluster is 3.543 Å which is slightly longer than the reported anhydrous MOF (3.512 Å), and Co–Ow–Co angle is 114.13°. The Co(II) ions exhibit distorted CoN2O4 octahedral coordina- tion geometry (angles around the metal ion are within the range 82.37(1)–94.20(1)°) generated by two pyridine N, three carboxylate O and one bridging water molecule. The dinu- clear Co2 unit is surrounded by six Co(II) ions to form a 3D framework structure having channels along the {001} axis, the bromo groups oriented towards the channels are offset to each other with Br⋯O halogen bonding interaction of 3.032 Å (the sum of the corresponding van der Waals radii is 3.35 Å).12 The channels are occupied by disordered solvent water mole- cules (Fig. 1b). The disordered solvent water molecule could not be modeled, hence was removed using SQUEEZE com- mand. Due to the extra water solvent content, MOF 1a can be considered as a supramolecular isomer of the reported Co-MOF. By considering the dinuclear Co2 cluster as a node and BNA ligand as a linker (Fig. 1c) it gives a (2,8) connected 2-nodal net with Schlafli symbol {44·1224}{4}4 (Fig. 1d). Crystal structure of 1b. The complex has the same stoichiometry as that of the reported MOF.10 The crystal structure of 1b reveals the C2/c space-group symmetry. The two structures have similar SBUs and connectivity (Fig. 2a). Fig. 1 (a) View of the SBU of complex 1a with the Co-centers denoted in blue (hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity).

View Article Online CrystEngComm, 2014, 16, 5244–5256 | 5249 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 The central metal Cd(II) has a distorted octahedral coordina- tion environment (bond angles around the metal are within the range 82.41(8)–111.46(7)°), generated by two pyridyl-N atoms and four carboxylate O atoms belonging to two BNAs with coordination mode μ2-κO,O:κN (Scheme 2c). Thus, the central metal atom is surrounded by four Cd(II) metal ions. The SBU of the formerly published structure has two N atoms in trans positions, whereas in complex 1b the two N atoms have cis related geometry, as a result they have different structural arrangements (Fig. 2b). The reported structure rep- resents a 3D framework,10 while complex 1b shows a 2D framework with strong Br⋯O halogen bonding interactions (d = 2.934 Å, which is shorter by about 0.3 Å from the corre- sponding van der Waals distance)12 (Fig. 2c). The topology of the resulting structure can be defined as a (2,4) connected 2-nodal net with the Schlafli symbol {84·122}{8}2 (Fig. 2d). Therefore we can consider these two structures as supramo- lecular isomers, a phenomenon frequently observed for coor- dination polymers,13 as opposed to simple polymorphism.14 Crystal structure of 2a. Complex 2a crystallizes in monoclinic P21/n space group. The asymmetric unit consists of three Mn(II) ions, three 3,5-PDC ligands, three coordinated and one (disordered) free solvent DMA molecules. All three Mn(II) ions are in a distorted octahedral coordination geometry (angles within the range 80.80(1)–101.50(1)°) having a trinuclear hourglass SBU (Fig. 3a) with Mn–O distance ranges from 2.095(4) to 2.341(3) Å; Mn–N of 2.347(4) Å (Mn2–N17) and 2.266(4) Å (Mn3–N16). Mn2 is surrounded by an [NO5] donor set, generated by three carboxylate oxygens (O4, O13 and O14) of three 3,5-PDC units, one nitrogen atom (N17) from one 3,5-PDC moiety and two coordinated DMA solvents (O46 and O51) respectively. The central metal atom Mn1 is surrounded by six carboxylate oxygens (O6, O7, O8, O9, O11 and O12) from three different 3,5-PDC ligands. The terminal Mn3 ion is coordinated to four carboxylate oxygens (O5, O6, O10 and O15) from three different 3,5-PDCs, one nitrogen atom (N16) from one 3,5-PDC and a coordinated solvent DMA (O40). The three 3,5-PDC have different Fig. 3 (a) Trinuclear hourglass SBU of 2a (red spheres represent coordinated DMA molecules; hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity).

The disordered free DMA solvent occupies the channels created by the network structure along the b-axis. Crystal structure of 2b. The complex crystallizes in the orthorhombic P212121 space group. The asymmetric unit consists of one Zn(II) ion, one 3,5-PDC ligand, and one coordinated and one disordered free solvent DMA molecules. The Zn(II) ion has a tetrahedral geometry surrounded by a [NO3] donor set, generated by two carboxylate O atoms of two 3,5-PDC ligands, one O atom from the coordinated solvent DMA and one N atom of 3,5-PDC (Fig. 4a). The Zn–O length varies from 1.936(2) to 1.971(2) Å, and the Zn–N distance is 2.039(2) Å (Zn1–N6). 3,5-PDC acts as tridentate ligand with μ3-κO:κO:κN coordination mode (Scheme 2d). As one of the coordinating sites is blocked by solvent DMA molecules, both the metal Zn(II) and ligand 3,5-PDC act as three-connector nodes, resulting in a 3D chiral srs type network with the Schlafli symbol {103} (Fig. 4b). The tiling pattern of the srs net can be shown (Fig. 4c) with a representation [103], using Systre and 3dt.15 The tiling has a point symmetry no. 32 with 8 nodes and 12 edges for each repeated unit (Fig. 4d). The srs net contains rectangular channels along the {100} axis filled with disordered solvent DMA molecules (Fig. 4e). Due to the solvent inclusion, no interpenetration is possible in this particular framework. Packing fraction and total poten- tial solvent area volume were calculated using PLATON after removing the included DMA solvent. The packing index value of 50.6% and solvent area volume of 646.8 Å3, showed the complex to be potentially porous with wide solvent-accessible channels (Fig. 4f). The TGA experiment of the crystalline material shows continuous loss of the DMA solvent species below 300 °C: 17.5% weigh loss below 230 °C for the uncoor- dinated moiety, and a similar amount within 230–300 °C for the coordinated DMA. It gradually decomposes upon further heating within the range 300–500 °C.

How- ever, irreversible loss of crystallinity to a large extent is detected on heating the sample to 180 °C on expulsion of the channel-accommodated non-coordinated molecules of the solvent (Fig. 5). Crystal structure of 2c. The complex 2c crystallizes in a monoclinic P21 chiral space group with an asymmetric unit consisting of two Cd(II) ions, two 3,5-PDCs and four coordinated solvent DMA molecules. The Cd(II) ions are seven coordinated by four carboxylate O atoms of two 3,5-PDCs, one N atom of one 3,5-PDC and two DMA molecules forming a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry with an [NO6] donor mode (Fig. 6a). The Cd–O distance varies from 2.270(3) to 2.663(3) Å; Cd–N distances are 2.309(4) Å (Cd1–N11) and 2.318(3) Å (Cd2–N12). Both the 3,5-PDCs are tridentate and adopt a μ3-κO,O:κO,O:κN coordination mode (Scheme 2f). Two DMA molecules coordinate to the metal along the trans-related axial positions. As a result 2c forms a 2D framework structure having a 3 connected uninodal net of topological type hcb with Schlafli symbol {63} (Fig. 6b and c). The metal connected infinite 2D grids are stacked parallel to each other along the (101) plane, and the vacant space created by the layers is occupied by dangling solvent DMA molecules as shown in Fig. 6b. Crystal structures of [Ln(III)(3,5-PDC)1.5(DMF)]·xDMF (Ln = Sm (2d), La (2f), Ce (2g)). Framework structures 2d, 2f and 2g crystallize in the orthorhombic Pnma space group and are isomorphous, structure 2d being discussed below. In 2d, the asymmetric unit consists of one symmetry independent Sm(III) ion, one and half molecules of 3,5-PDC, one coordinated and one disordered free solvent (removed using SQUEEZE command) DMF molecules. The nine coordinated Sm(III) ion has a distorted mono-capped square antiprism geometry (angles around Sm are within the range of 70.06(8)–147.46(9)°) (Fig. 7a). The [O9] donor set of Sm(III) ion is generated by eight carboxylate oxygen atoms of six 3,5- PDCs and one coordinated solvent DMF molecule.

The pyridyl-N site of the ligand remains free to interact with the solvent species. The 3,5-PDC ligand adopts two different coordination modes μ4-κO:κO:κO:κO,O (Scheme 2h) and μ4-κO:κO,O:κO:κO,O (Scheme 2i) respectively. The Sm(III) ions are connected to each other through carboxylate O, with Sm–O distances within 2.318(2)–2.740(2) Å forming a 1D polymeric chain (Fig. 6b) with Sm⋯Sm separation distance of 4.249 Å. These polymeric 1D chains are inter-connected by bridging 3,5-PDC, giving rise to a (2,5) connected 2-nodal 3D net char- acterized by Schlafli symbol of {66·8·103}2{6}3 (Fig. 7c), where each metal atom is considered as a node. The resulting network forms wide hexagonal solvent-accessible channels along the {100} axis filled with disordered solvent DMF mole- cules (Fig. 7d). The network structure exhibits tiling of a repeated unit with 20 nodes and 32 edges and can be repre- sented as [66·122].

The three symmetry independent 3,5-PDCs adopt two different coordination modes μ4-κO:κO:κO:κO (Scheme 2g) and μ4-κO:κO,O:κO:κO,O (Scheme 2i). The pyridyl-N is not coordinated. Similar to the other lanthanoid MOFs, 2e also contains oxo-bridged 1D polymeric chains having Tb–O distances in the range of 2.293(8)–2.847(9) Å with alternate Tb⋯Tb separation distance of 4.551 Å and 4.566 Å. By considering the two Tb–O connected clusters as a node and 3,5-PDC as a linker, crystal structure 2e can be best represented as a (2,8) connected 2-nodal net, having a Schlafli symbol of {59·66·7·86·96}{5}3 (Fig. 8b). The resultant network contains hexagonal channels along the {100} axis filled with disordered solvent DMF mole- cules similar to the other lanthanoid MOFs. The framework exhibits only one natural (Fig. 8c) tiling represented as [56·122] with a total of 16 nodes and 28 edges in the repeating unit. The network shows high symmetry dualized natural til- ing (Fig. 8d) with the hex net having two kinds of tiles [32·46] and 3[42]. The basic difference between structures 2e and 2d is the coordination geometry across the metal ion ([O8] in 2e, as opposed to [O9] in 2d) and the topology of the 1D poly- meric chains. The latter is (2,8)-connected in 2e (Fig. 8e) and (2,5)-connected in 2d (Fig. 8f). While the luminescence prop- erties of the Tb complex could not be determined in the pres- ent case, an extensive discussion of such features in a closely related Eu-derivative has been published recently.4f Magnetic properties Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on microcrystalline samples of compounds 2a, 2d and 2e. The magnetic susceptibilities of the com- pounds were measured in the temperature range 2–300 K under a 500 Oe field. The plots of χMT and χM vs. temperature of compound 2a are shown in Fig. 9. The experimental χMT value at 300 K is about 12.19 emu mol−1 K, is very close to the calculated value, 13.12 emu mol−1 K, for three uncoupled Mn(II) ions with spin value 5/2 and Landé g value of 2.20.16 The χMT vs. temperature plot decreases slowly as the temper- ature decreases, at temperatures below 50 K the decrease in the χMT product is more pronounced. Upon cooling down to 2 K the value is 5.32 emu mol−1 K. The inverse susceptibility plot as a function of temperature is linear above 30 K, follow- ing the Curie–Weiss law with a Weiss constant, θ = −15.5 K. The small negative Weiss constant suggests that there exists an antiferromagnetic interaction between two Mn(II) centers. The negative intercept for reciprocal susceptibility and the decreasing χMT value upon cooling indicates a slight antifer- romagnetic interaction between the adjacent metal ions through carboxylate bridges which is also observed in related context.2,17 The magnetic behaviors of 2d and 2e are different from 2a due to the much weaker effects of the magnetic exchange coupling, as the f orbitals are well shielded by the outer s and p orbitals and less extended compared to the d orbitals of the Mn(II) ion. The spin–orbit coupling plays an important role in the magnetism of lanthanoids.16 Due to the influence of the inter-electronic repulsion and spin–orbit coupling, the 4fn configuration of a Ln(III) ion splits into 2S+1LJ spectro- scopic levels. Each of the states is further split into Stark sub- levels by the crystal field. The site symmetry of the Ln(III) ions determines the number of possible Stark sublevels. At ambient temperature, all Stark sublevels of the 2S+1LJ ground state are thermally populated.16 As the temperature decreases, depopulation of these sublevels occurs and there- fore χMT decreases. The variation of χM and inverse χMT with respect to temperature is shown in Fig. 10 for complex 2d. The ground term of the free Sm(III) ion is 6H5/2 and it splits into six states by spin–orbit coupling at room temperature. The ground state 6H5/2 is not completely separated from the excited ones (about 700 cm−1 from the ground state to the first excited state). Hence, both the possible thermal popula- tion and the crystal field effect of the high states should be evaluated for the Sm(III) complex.16,18 From Fig. 10, it can be seen that the χMT value is equal to 0.78 emu mol−1 K at 300 K, which is close to the expected 0.84 emu mol−1 K for two magnetically isolated Sm(III) ions (S = 5/2, L = 5/2, 6H5/2, g = 2/7).16,18 When the temperature was cooled to 2 K, the χMT decreases monotonically and rapidly to a value of 0.14 emu mol−1 K. The thermal variation of χMT is practically linear over the whole temperature range. The linear thermal variation of χMT is reported for Sm(III) complexes in the Fig. 9 Plots of the temperature dependence of χMT and χM for compound 2a.

The magnetic characteristics of complex 2e are different from those of 2d (Fig. 11). The χMT value of 23.48 emu mol−1 K observed at room temperature is close to the value of 23.64 emu mol−1 K expected for two noninteracting Tb(III) ions (7F6, S = 3, L = 3, g = 3/2).16,20 Upon cooling the system, χMT continuously decreases over the whole temperature range and reaches 10.34 emu mol−1 K at 2 K comparable with the results reported previously.20 The plot of inverse χM with temperature shows a straight line and also follows the Curie–Weiss law with a Weiss constant, θ = −25.5 K. However, the negative value of θ and the trends of the χMT values cannot clearly cor- roborate the antiferromagnetic coupling between two neigh- boring Tb(III) ions. Conclusions In summary, we have successfully synthesized nine coordina- tion polymers with BNA and 3,5-PDC ligands and different metal ions. Solvent selection and reaction conditions play an important role in the crystallization process to reveal new structures (1a and 1b) with the BNA ligand, which represent supramolecular isomers of the known ones. They exhibit dis- tinct Br⋯O halogen bonding interactions, which may provide an additional reason for the diversification of the coordina- tion modes with this ligand. The five new coordination com- plexes of 3,5-PDC with d-metal ions (2a, 2b and 2c) and f-metal ions (2d and 2e) are characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The small rigid ligand 3,5-H2PDC is achiral in nature. Nevertheless, it yielded three chiral coordination-polymeric structures (2b, 2c and 2e), which could be attributed to the different nature and asymmetric disposition of the ligating species around the corresponding metal centers. The four lanthanoid MOFs (2d, 2e, 2f and 2g) are essentially isostructural to each other (2d, 2f and 2g being isomorphous). Networking diversity in the analyzed series of coordination complexes is primarily due to the coordination environment of the metal ions. In the case of lanthanoid MOFs (2d–2g) pyridyl-N of 3,5-PDC does not take part in metal coordination. Nevertheless, the larger size and coordi- nation number (as well as the unique optical properties) of the oxophilic lanthanoid reagents (compared to the d-metals) make them more attractive nodes for targeted crystal engi- neering of 3D framework solids. The magnetic study of the complex 2a reveals weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the metal centers through carboxylate bridges. In 2d and 2e there may be some antiferromagnetic interactions between the proxime metal centers but the degree of interaction is dif- ficult to determine. The above discussed materials provide an important expansion of the continuously increasing data- base1,21 of metal–organic coordination networks and the crys- tal engineering tools that contribute to their formation. The 3D MOF materials with Ln-ion connectors are of further interest in the context of guest storage and exchange within the intra-lattice channels and formation of metallogels. Stud- ies along these directions are currently underway. Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 108/12). References 1 (a) R. J. Kuppler, D. J.
