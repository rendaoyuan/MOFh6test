Manuscript Entangled metal–organic frameworks modulated by N-donor ligands of different conformations† Hua-Dong Guo, Dong-Fang Qiu, Xian-Min Guo, Guo-Li Zheng, Xiao Wang, Song Dang and Hong-Jie Zhang* Received 13th March 2009, Accepted 30th June 2009 First published as an Advance Article on the web 27th July 2009 DOI: 10.1039/b905190m Based on the aromatic dicarboxylic acid and N-donor ligands with different conformations, four Zn(II) metal–organic frameworks, namely [Zn(mfda)(L1)] (1), [Zn2(mfda)2(L2)]$DMF$H2O (2), [Zn2(mfda)2(L3)(H2O)]$DMF (3) and [Zn2(mfda)2(L4)] (4) have been synthesized (mfda ¼ 9,9- dimethylﬂuorene-2,7-dicarboxylate anion, L1 ¼ 1,10-phenanthroline, L2 ¼ 4,40-bipyridine, L3 ¼ 2,5- bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-ocadiazole and L4 ¼ 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction has revealed that all compounds exhibit entangled structures. Compound 1 is composed of 1D zigzag chains that are entangled through the p–p stacking interactions to generate a three-fold interpenetrating diamond-like networks. 2 exhibits a two-fold interpenetrating (a-Po) net, which leaves 1D channels with high free volume. In 3, parallel mutual polythreadings of 2D layers are connected by hydrogen bonds into a self-penetrating framework with (44$610$7)(4$5$6)(46$52$616$73$9) topology. For 4, the interpenetrating 2D layers are connected into a self-interpenetrating net with (49$66) topology. The potential of N-donor ligands to produce interesting metal–organic frameworks is investigated. Luminescent studies show that 1–4 exhibit strong blue ﬂuorescent emissions. Introduction Recently, a variety of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with fascinating topological structures and desirable properties have been identiﬁed.1,2 Based on the concept of crystal engineering, structure–function relationships with properties such as magne- tism, luminescence, and permanent porosity have thereby been developed in a systematic manner. However crystallization is a very complicated process, and minor changes of chemical environment, such as the temperature, pH value and solvents can all display an unpredicted impact on the composition of the resulting compounds.3 So, the ‘‘true’’ engineering of MOFs remains a difﬁcult challenge, even though the careful selection of metal coordination geometries and organic ligand structures can still play a decisive role in the construction of MOFs. Aided by the approach of network-based crystal engineering, entangled frameworks, once rarity, are now becoming very common.4 The interpenetration, as the most investigated type of entanglement, has been discussed in two comprehensive reviews by Robson and Batten.5 Accordingly, the interpenetrating structures, that ‘‘can be regarded as inﬁnite, ordered polycatenanes or poly- rotaxanes’’, are characterized by the presence of inﬁnite structurally regular motifs that must contain rings ‘‘through which independent components are inextricably entangled’’. In contrast to the inter- penetration, the self-penetration as another type of entanglement, has been less reported.6 These species are single nets that have the peculiarity of containing rings through which other components of the same network pass. The origin of entanglement can be ascribed to the presence of a large solvent accessible volume in a single network, but the nature abhors a vacuum, so the entanglement occurs. Since the employment of long organic ligands often gener- ates entangled structures, in this paper, we have chosen 9,9-dime- thylﬂuorene-2,7-dicarboxylic acid (H2mfda) to construct MOFs. Meanwhile, to further investigate the inﬂuence of the neutral ligands on the formation of supramolecular architectures, four bidentate N-donor ligands with different conformations were introduced (Chart 1). Successfully we have synthesized four MOFs, namely [Zn(mfda)(L1)] (1), [Zn2(mfda)2(L2)]$DMF$H2O (2), [Zn2(mfda)2(L3)(H2O)]$DMF (3) and [Zn2(mfda)2(L4)] (4). All compounds exhibit entangled structures. Experimental H2mfda was synthesized according to the literature.7 All other starting materials were of analytical grade and used as received Chart 1 The building units used.

Single-crystal XRD data for compounds 1–4 were recorded on a Bruker Apex CCD diffrac- tometer with graphite monochromated Mo Ka radiation (l ¼ 0.71073 A˚ ) at 165(2) K. Absorption corrections were applied using the multiscan technique. All structures were solved by the direct method using SHELXS-978 and reﬁned by the full-matrix least-squares techniques by using the SHELXL-979 program within WINGX.10 Non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned with anisotropic temperature parameters. The hydrogen atoms of the organic ligands were reﬁned as rigid groups. Compound 2 was formulated as [Zn2(mfda)2(L2)]$DMF$H2O by elemental micro- analysis, TGA and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. To compound 3, in order to keep anisotropic thermal parameters of some atoms in two uncoordinated DMF molecules reasonable, we did some restrictions to bond distances and angles and to atomic temperature factors, so the hydrogen atoms of these molecules could not be added. The detailed crystallographic data and structure reﬁnement parameters for 1–4 are summarized in Table 1. Results and discussion Synthesis of the compounds Hydro/solvothermal synthesis is a relatively complex process, and the ﬁnal products are often unpredictable under a given set of conditions. The reaction variables (metal ions, temperature, solvents, reaction time, etc.) may affect the ﬁnal products remarkably. In our system, the solvents play an important role in the formation of new compounds. Under hydrothermal condi- tions, only L1 and L4 can be introduced into the motifs; while for L2 and L3, we just isolate some polycrystals.

Water was found to be crucial in producing good quality crystals in the synthesis of compounds 2 and 3. All compounds 1–4 are stable in air and insoluble in common solvents such as ethanol, acetone, and acetonitrile. Structural description of 1 Compound 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Cc. The asymmetric unit consists of one Zn atom, one mfda2 and one L1 ligand. The one crystallographically unique Zn atom adopts a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry coordinated by three O atoms from two mfda2 ligands (Zn–O 1.929(3)–2.233(3) A˚ ) and two N atoms from one chelating L1 ligand (Zn–N 2.073(4)– 2.107(5) A˚ ). Mfda2 acts as a m2-bridge, linking two Zn(II) centers through one monodentate carboxylate group and one chelating one. In the overall structure of 1, [ZnL1]2+ nodes are connected by mfda2 linkers to generate a 1D zigzag chain with a period of 24.58 A˚ (Fig. 1a). The chains, with the terminal L1 ligands directed outwards, are arranged in such a way that p–p stacking interactions are formed between phenanthroline rings from different chains. The adjacent phenanthroline rings are related by inversion centers, and the centroid–centroid distance (3.60 A˚ ), plane-to-plane distance (3.41 A˚ ) and displacement angle (0.426) indicate a strong p–p stacking interaction.11 These interactions arrange the chains into a 3D supramolecular network (Fig. 1b). If the mfda2 ligands and the p–p stacked phenanthroline pairs are considered as linkers, and metal centers are considered as nodes, the architecture can be regarded as a 3D diamond net (Fig. 1c). The network features 1D nanosized pillar-like channels along the c axis with dimensions of 22.12  24.58 A˚ (corre- sponding to the longest intracage Zn/Zn distances). The Zn/ Zn distance (8.52 A˚ ) separated by the p–p stacked phenan- throline rings is much shorter than those (14.95 A˚ ) by the mfda2 ligands, and three identical nets interpenetrate each other, with the metal coordination spheres of two nets located at the channel centers of the other net (Fig. 1d). Structural description of 2 It crystallizes in monoclinic space group C2/c. The two crystal- lographically unique Zn atoms have almost the same coordina- tion environments, which are bridged by four carboxylate groups bonded in the bridging bis(bidentate) fashion to give a paddle- wheel-like [Zn2(CO2)4] dimer (Zn–O 2.017(4)- 2.049(3) A˚ ). These dimers are connected by the ﬂuorene rings to build 2D square- grid (4,4) layers (Fig. 2a). The axial sites of each paddlewheel dimer are occupied by two L2 ligands (Zn–N 2.034(4)- 2.041(4) A˚ ), which pillar the 2D layers to generate an extended 3D open framework (Fig. 2b) that possesses large cube-like cavities of approximately 13.97  14.91  14.91 A˚ (Fig. 2c). The paddle- wheel dimer can also be topologically viewed as an octahedral node, and the topologies of 2 can be best described as an elon- gated primitive cubic (a-Po) net.12 It should be noted that employing long linkers often generated multiply interpenetrated frameworks. However, in 2, because of the introduction of a steric hindrance of alkyls in mfda2, the overall structures are a pair of identical nets that mutually interpenetrate each other into 2-fold interpenetrated frameworks (Fig. 2d). The long size of mfda2 and L2 still favors the generation of 1D rhombic channels of 11.97  12.89 A˚ by diagonal, and the effective free volume is calculated by PLATON analysis as being 46.1%, which is occu- pied by the uncoordinated solvent molecules. Structural description of 3 Compound 3 crystallizes in monoclinic space group C2/c. There are two Zn atoms, two mfda2, one L3 and one DMF molecule in the asymmetric unit. Every two crystallographically the same Zn atoms are bridged by two pairs of carboxylate groups to generate two distinct paddle-like dimers [Zn(1)2(CO2)4] and [Zn(2)2(CO2)4], Fig. 1 (a) View of the structure of the 1D zigzag chain in 1.

The axial sites of [Zn(1)2(CO2)4] are occupied by two water molecules (Zn(1)–O 1.979(3)–2.034(3) A˚ ), and the axial sites of [Zn(2)2(CO2)4] are occupied by two dangling L3 ligands (Zn(2)–O 2.034(3)–2.063(3) A˚ ; Zn(2)–N 2.030(4) A˚ ). These dimers are connected by ﬂuorene rings to give a 2D square-grid layer with large rhombic windows of 20.81  21.14 A˚ by diagonal (Fig. 3a). The layers exhibit parallel stacking in an ABC sequence with a distance of ca. 5.67 A˚ between the adjacent layers. Each dangling arm has an effectual length of about 11.9 A˚ so that the arm is threaded into the windows of two adjacent layers. Consequently, each rhombic void is threaded by two arms from opposite directions, and the whole structure can be regarded as an interpenetrating poly-threaded motif (2D / 3D) of ﬁve adjacent polymeric layers at a time (Fig. 3b).13 The poly-threading is stabilized by two kinds of strong hydrogen bondings from the coordinated water reacting with the uncoordinated nitrogen atom from the dangling L3 ligand (O10/N4 2.66 A˚ ) and the coordinated oxygen atom from the nearest neighbouring layer (O10/O4 2.84 A˚ ). As a result, all layers are connected into a single framework by the hydrogen bonds. If the water molecules are regarded as three-connected nodes, the two paddle-like dimers can be regarded as six-con- nected nodes and eight-connected nodes, respectively. Based on the simpliﬁcation principle, the resulting structure exhibits an interesting self-interpenetrating net with (44$610$7) (4$5$6)(46$52$616$73$9) topology after being analyzed by OLEX (Fig. 3c). The entanglement still allows the existence of 1D triangular channels occupied by the free DMF molecules. Structural description of 4 Different from compounds 1–3, compound 4 is a self-penetrating framework that crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group Pbcn. The asymmetric unit contains one unique Zn atom, one unique mfda2 and half L4 ligand. [Zn2(CO2)2] dimers are formed in which pairs of Zn atoms are bridged by one of the carboxylate groups from two different mfda2 ligands (each oxygen bonds to a different metal). The other carboxylate groups bond in a monodentate fashion, via one of its oxygen atoms, to Zn atoms of adjoining dimers (Zn–O 1.910(4)- 1.949(4) A˚ ) (Fig. 4a). The [Zn2(CO2)2] dimer lies about an inversion centre. Thus the mfda2 ligands bridge the Zn atoms into 2D undulated (4, 4)- layers containing rhombic cavities with dimensions of ca. 15.47  23.54 A˚ by diagonal. These layers show parallel stacking in Fig. 3 (a) A single 2D (4,4) layer with dangling L3 ligands (yellow) in 3. (b) Schematic view of the mutual polythreading of ﬁve layers.

Downloaded by Brown University on 31/10/2014 12:22:23. View Article Online two directions, respectively, with a stacking distance of ca. 9.94 A˚ . The interpenetrating of these two piles of layers generates a polycatenane framework in a ‘‘diagonal–diagonal’’ fashion (Fig. 4b).14 The angle between the interpenetrated layers is ca. 59.84. Each window of the layer is threaded by one Zn2 dimer. In 4, the L4 ligand lies about a twofold axis, adopts a cis- conformation and bridges two Zn atoms belonging to different Zn2 dimers (Zn–N 1.981(6) A˚ ). Then, each dimer is connected by two L4 ligands with two other dimers that lie at the diagonal position of the equatorial plane. And these two L4 ligands are trans-located at the sites of plane. Consequently, the interpenetrating 2D layers are connected by L4 to generate a 3D self-penetrating single network with (49$66) topology. (Fig. 4c) Although we are unable to propose deﬁnitive reasons as to why each compound adopts a different topology with our present state of knowledge, better insight into these structures can still acquire useful information for constructing coordination polymers. As we know, in the generation of ternary MOFs, N-donor ligands play a dual role of building units and templates. So here we have adopted such four bidentate N-donor ligands viewing their difference of conformation and rigidity. As shown above, the coordination modes of mfda2 ligand are strongly related to the geometry of N-donor ligands. In 1, L1 is essential in chelating metal ions and locking their positions, thus mfda2 adopts a m2-bridging coordination mode with one monodentate and one chelating carboxylate group, which tends to connect metal ions in the formation of 1D zigzag chains. In 2 and 3, mfda2 ligands both adopt the bridging syn–syn bidentate coordination mode to connect metal ions into ‘‘paddlewheel’’ clusters, which favors the generation of 2D square-grid layers. The layers are pillared by the linear ligand L2 to form a 3D framework. However, for V-shaped ligand L3, its strong rigidity makes it to adopt a one-terminal coordination mode and to unfavorably connect the layers. In 4, mfda2 adopts a m3-bridging coordination mode with one monodentate and one syn–syn bidentate carboxylate groups to connect metal ions into double clusters. Therefore, the coordi- nation modes of the carboxylate ligands inﬂuence the metal nuclearity and hence the connectivity of the resulting net. Thermal analysis To characterize the thermal stabilities of compounds 1–4, their thermal behaviour was investigated under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 C min1 by TGA (Fig. 5). Compound 1 remains stable up to ca. 300 C, ﬁnally leading to the formation of the stoichiometric amount of ZnO as a residue (obsd 12.74%, calcd 14.91%). For 2, the weight loss in the range of 50–330 C is attributed to the gradual release of uncoordinated solvent molecules (DMF and H2O) (obsd 9.28%, calcd 9.70%). The removal of organic ligands occurs in the range of 330–515 C. Fig. 4 (a) View of the basic connectivity in 4. (b) View of the poly- catenane framework in a ‘‘diagonal–diagonal’’ fashion.

View Article Online The remaining weight corresponds to the formation of ZnO (obsd 17.90%, calcd 17.26%). For 3, the weight loss in the range of 140–234 C corresponds to the departure of DMF and water (obsd 8.20%, calcd 9.05%). The removal of L3 occurs in the range of 234–372 C (obsd 23.70%, calcd 22.25%). The removal of mfda2 ligands occurs in the range of 372–524 C (obsd 54.42%, calcd 55.64%). The remaining weight corresponds to the formation of ZnO (obsd 14.42%, calcd 16.09%). For 4, the decomposition of the compound occurs at ca. 310 C, with the residue of ZnO (obsd 15.89%, calcd 17.42%). Photoluminescence properties The solid-state photoluminescent spectra of 1–4 are investigated (Fig. S5–S8 in the ESI).† All compounds exhibit strong blue ﬂuorescent emissions. Excitation at 380 nm leads to a single peak at 433 nm for 1. Compound 2 shows a single peak at 470 nm upon excitation at 346 nm. Compound 3 displays a broad band with a single peak at 456 nm upon excitation at 358 nm. Compound 4 shows a main peak at 414 nm with a shoulder at 433 nm upon excitation at 385 nm. The peaks at 414 and 433 nm of compounds 1 and 4 are probably due to p–p* transitions of anion ligands because similar peaks also appear for the free H2mfda. For 2 and 3, since solid L2 and L3 are nearly non-ﬂuorescent in the range 400–500 nm (Fig. S9–S10),† the origin of the emission at 456 and 470 nm might be attributed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). From the above results, we can see that the coordina- tion environment of the central metal shows a signiﬁcant contri- bution to the emission of these four compounds. Conclusions In this study, the simultaneous use of the long aromatic dicar- boxylic acid and bidentate N-donor ligands with different conformation to react with zinc salts affords four new entangled metal–organic frameworks with interesting architectures. The results of this study demonstrate that the rational choice of organic ligands with speciﬁc functional groups and geometry is still a major approach to the construction of MOFs. These four compounds not only ﬁll the aesthetic diversity of coordinative network chemistry, but may also provide a potential way to the selective design of versatile connected MOFs.
