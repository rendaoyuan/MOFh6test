Hexafluorosilicate anions act as bridges between Cd ions yielding further linkage of 4-connected [Cd(Me4bpz)2] subtopologies. Characteristic and specific interaction between SiF6 2- and the metal-organic portion is conditioned by a synergism of 15 coordination and multiple strong NH⋅⋅⋅F bonds, which suggests perfect compatibility of the bipyrazole and SiF6 2- linkers for the construction of 3D structures, either by pillaring of 2D layers or cross-linking of 3D frameworks. Two observed motifs, 1D [M(pyrazole)4{µ-SiF6}]n (in 4 and 5) and discrete [{M{NCS}(pyrazole)4}2{µ-SiF6}] (in 2 and 3) are discussed as special supramolecular synthons for the framework solids. Improved large-scale and cost-effective procedure for the synthesis of the organic 20 ligand Me4bpz is also described. Introduction Hexafluorosilicate offers a number of special possibilities for supramolecular synthesis of framework solids. Unlike charge- diffuse monoanions, SiF6 2- displays significant nucleophilicity 25 and pronounced ability for hydrogen bonding, often being a most crucial factor for the hybrid organic-inorganic crystal lattices.1-6 Its inherent symmetry and functionality perfectly complements demands imposed by octahedral metal ions coordinating set of four equatorial ligands, cf. M(Py)4 2+,2 and therefore such the 30 combination is especially beneficial for the construction of 3D structures by cross-linking coordination layers formed by metal ions and common N-donor bridging ligands, cf. {M(bipy)2 2+}n. In particular, the framework structures of [M(bipy)2{SiF6}] (M = Zn, Cu) were of paramount significance for developing common 35 approaches of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering,3 while receiving new rapidly growing interest as prototypical host lattices for selective sorption of carbon dioxide.4 A series of hexafluorosilicate frameworks prepared utilizing either smaller (pyrazine)5 or extended (incorporating ethylene-, acetylene-, 40 phenylene-, naphthylene-diyl and other spacers)4,6 analogs of bipyridine reveals effective tuning of the micropore size, while preserving characteristic motif in the form of {SiF6 2-}-pillared square grid networks. The highly probable assembly of such characteristic [M(Py)4{SiF6}] entities, which could be viewed as 45 supramolecular synthons, is defined by concerted interaction of the components, via coordination bonding and a set of weak CH⋅⋅⋅F hydrogen bonds. Recently, a special significance of SiF6 2- building blocks for selective sorption stimulated studies for the closely related GeF6 2-, SnF6 2- and TiF6 2- compounds.7 50 Even a more energetically favorable structure of the synthon could be feasible while exploiting synergy of coordination bonds and conventional strong NH⋅⋅⋅F interactions. In this view, a valuable combination of the donor and acceptor functionalities, which is perfectly suited for accommodation of SiF6 2-, could be 55 recognized in the structure of M(pyrazole)4 2+ scaffolds.8 The latters combine axial coordination positions at the metal ion and a set of four sterically accessible NH-donors, predetermining very efficient multi-center interaction with the shape- and charge- complementary SiF6 2- substrate. Therefore, exploitation of SiF6 2- 60 (and the related octahedral hexafluoroanions) as pillaring blocks for the construction of functional 3D frameworks could be most efficient when combined with pyrazole ligands. In the present work we illustrate utility of such approach with the prototypical bitopic ligand 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethyl-4,4’-bipyrazole (Me4bpz) 65 a Inorganic Chemistry Dpt, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Volodymyrska Str. 64/13, Kyiv 01601, Ukraine.

This structurally simple and chemically accessible organic linker found wide and versatile applications for construction of coordination frameworks,9,10 including covalent pyrazolate frameworks,11 and hydrogen-bonded structures.12 Conformational flexibility of the tecton predermines structural 5 diversity and rich supramolecular isomerism of the M2+-Me4bpz coordination systems, which is a particularly important factor for the ease adaptibility of the tecton towards metric and functional demands coming from the inorganic component of the structure. Experimental section 10 Synthesis 3,3’,5,5’-Tetramethyl-4,4’-bipyrazole (Me4bpz) was prepared in yields up to 95% by reaction of 3,4-diacethyl-2,5-hexanedione (tetraacetylethane) with hydrazine hydrate in methanol9d or water and recrystallization of the product from aqueous methanol yields 15 semihydrate Me4bpz·0.5H2O as large colorless prisms.12a Preparation of tetraacetylethane by coupling of sodium acetylacetonate, Na(Acac), in ether suspension (41-59%) is described in Organic Syntheses.13 This method, however, was insufficient for the large-scale syntheses leading to poor yields of 20 the product. Considering possible industrial applications of bipyrazolate frameworks as gas adsorbents,11 we have elaborated an improved procedure for coupling of 1,3-diketones in DMF solution. Present method provides constant and reproducible yields (78-84%, for the 0.5-500 g batch scales of 25 Na(Acac)·2H2O) and very simple isolation of the product. Preparation of 3,4-diacethyl-2,5-hexanedione Solution of 47.0 g (0.185 mol) iodine in 200 mL DMF was added dropwise for 1 h at 5-10oC to an intensively stirred solution of 60.0 g (0.38 mol) of Na(Acac)·2H2O13 in 300 mL DMF. One or 30 two additional 50 mL portions of DMF were added towards the end of the reaction in the case of necessity, to decrease the viscosity of the NaI·2DMF slurry. The resulting brown reaction solution was poured into 2 L of ice water and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. The precipitate was filtered, washed with 35 water and recrystallized from 2-propanol (3.7 g per 100 mL) yielding pure colorless tetraketone (28.4 g, 78%). M.p. 193oC. When the anhydrous Na(Acac) was used as a starting material, the yield was 60%. Preparation of coordination compounds 40 [Cd2(Me4bpz)4{SiF6}{NCS}2]·nSolv (2: Solv = CHCl3, n = 6; 3: Solv = CH2Cl2, n = 1.5).

The CH3OH/CH2Cl2 mixture (1:1 v/v, 6 mL) was indroduced as an intermediate layer. Slow interdiffusion of the solutions for a period of 20 d yields 45 mg (55%) of colorless crystalline product 3. Complex 2 was prepared similarly (yield 70%) using methanol and chloroform solutions. The compounds 50 are unstable in air and readily lose the solvent of crystallization within minutes.

A mixture of 25.3 mg (0.070 mmol) of CdSiF6⋅6H2O, 27.9 mg (0.140 mmol) of Me4bpz·0.5H2O, and 4 mL of water was stirred for 30 min in a 55 Teflon vessel and then it was heated at 140°C for 70 h.

Solution of 27.2 mg (0.075 mmol) of CdSiF6⋅6H2O in 3 mL of methanol was layered over a solution of 29.9 mg (0.150 mmol) of Me4bpz·0.5H2O in 5 mL of 1:2 v/v CH3OH/CH2Cl2 mixture, with the intermediate 10 layer constituted by 5 mL of 2:1 v/v CH3OH/CH2Cl2 mixture. Small colorless prisms of the product grew on the walls of the tube as the solutions interdiffused for the period of 15-20 d. Complex [Cd(Me4bpz)2{NCS}2]·⅔CH2Cl2 (1) was prepared in a similar fashion, starting with Cd(NCS)2 (Yield: 55%). 15 X-ray crystallography Crystallographic measurements were made at 213 K using Siemens SMART CCD diffractometer and a Stoe Imaging Plate Diffraction System (for 4) with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) (Table 1). The structures were refined by full-matrix least-squares 20 in the anisotropic approximation using SHELX-97.14 CH and NH hydrogen atoms were added geometrically. In 2, two of three unique CHCl3 molecules were disordered over two positions. One of them was refined anisotropically with equal contributions of the disorder components, while second one (contributions 0.65 25 and 0.35) was left isotropic. The hydrogen atoms were not added to the disordered molecules. Refinement of the disorder in the region of guest molecules was relevant for all structures 1-5. Crystals of 3 and 4 were twinned. In the first case, low symmetry tetragonal (4/m) cell emulates high symmetry 30 tetragonal lattice (4/mmm) by merohedry. Solution in space group P42/mbc led to badly disordered model and the subsequent refinement eventually led to divergence (R1 > 0.20). Well refinable model was found in space group P42/m, with equal contributions of twin components. For monoclinic crystals of 4, 35 pseudomerohedral twinning (β≈90o) results in emulation of orthorhombic cell. The twinning was indicated by almost total disorder for the tested orthorhombic models, systematically Fo 2 » Fc 2 and suspiciously low│E2-1│at ~0.67. Solution was found in monoclinic space group C2/c and the structure was refined with 40 equal contributions of the twin components. Graphical visualization of the structures was made using the program Diamond 2.1e,15 and the topological analysis was performed using TOPOS 4.0.16 Results and discussion 45 Unlike the symmetrical pyridine-N donors providing identity of Fig. 2 Hexafluorosilicate link between the adjacent [Cd(Me4bpz)2]n layers, as it occurs in 2.

Such partial fragmentation of the catamer decreases the connectedness of the framework, still retaining SiF6 2- links, down to five. This suggests different possiblities for 10 the stepwise cross-linking of the coordination layers (or 3D nets) supported by bifunctional pyrazole Me4bpz, with facile interconversion of four-, five- and six-connected frameworks, influenced by the actual M/SiF6 ratios: [M(Me4bpz)2{NCS}2] → [{M(Me4bpz)2}2{µ-SiF6}{NCS}2] → [M(Me4bpz)2{µ-SiF6}], as it 15 is going to be demonstrated on the example of the compounds 1-5 (Table 2). The first representative of the series, the framework of lower connectivity of four is supported by Me4bpz links only. It occurs in [Cd(Me4bpz)2{NCS}2]·⅔CH2Cl2 (1), which possesses a 3D 20 NbO-like structure and is isotypical with [Fe(Me4bpz)2{NCS}2] ⋅⅔CH3CN, reported by Ganesan and Kepert.9c Two identical nets (related by a single translation vector) are interpenetrated (class Ia interpenetration, Z = 2),17 with the double helical strand generated by a specific NH⋅⋅⋅S (N⋅⋅⋅S = 3.41; 3.58 Å) hydrogen bonding 25 between two present frameworks (Figure 1). Additional topological link for the framewok in [Cd2(Me4bpz)4{SiF6}{NCS}2]·6CHCl3 (2) and [Cd2(Me4bpz)4 {SiF6}{NCS}2]·2CH2Cl2 (3) arises under partial elimination of terminal NCS- groups and their substitution for SiF6 2- groups 30 linking pairs of the adjacent Cd ions. The control over the stabilization of 5-coordinated nodes is offered by extensive NH⋅⋅⋅F bonding (Scheme 1). This complements formation of the coordination bonds and totals in the most efficient trapping of SiF6 2- octahedra between pairs of parallel Cd(Me4bpz)4 2+ 35 fragments. All eight NH-donors are positioned towards SiF6 2- and establish short and directional bonds (Table 3). Mode of such bonding is variable: in 2, the equatorial fluorides uniformly accept two bonds from both Cd(Me4bpz)4 2+ fragments (Figure 2), while 3 exhibits slightly different environment involving double 40 NH⋅⋅⋅F bonding with cis-positioned pyrazoles (Figure 3). Supramolecular isomerism of the hydrogen bonding patterns adopted by pyrazole and anionic co-ligands is known also for simpler molecular species, for example [Ni(Hpz)4{CH3CO2}2] and [Ni(Hpz)4{CH3CO2}2]⋅H2O (Hpz is pyrazole).18 45 Interestingly, the [{Cd(Me4bpz)2}2{µ-SiF6}{NCS}2] synthon strictly dominates a close parallel alignment of the Cd(Me4bpz)4 2+ Table 2 Main features of coordination geometries in 1-5 (Å, o) 1 2 3 4 5 Cd-N(pz) 2.386(2), 2.500(2) 2.333(4)-2.376(4) 2.294(6)-2.422(6) 2.288(3), 2.336(3) 2.3183(18), 2.3204(18) Cd-N(NCS) 2.257(2) 2.223(4) 2.178(8)-2.234(7) - - Cd-F - 2.395(2) 2.420(4)-2.489(3) 2.340(2) 2.3156(12) N(pz)-Cd-N(pz) (cis) 82.28(7), 97.72(7) 87.24(13)-90.09(13) 81.5(2)-102.9(3) 82.68(15)-94.83(16) 84.31(7), 95.69(7) N(pz)-Cd-N(pz) (trans) 180 161.34(13)-163.60(13) 153.15(18)-155.77(19) 173.82(10) 180 N(pz)-Cd-N(NCS) 82.42(7)-97.58(7) 98.05(15)-99.95(15) 97.6(2)-106.9(3) - - N(pz)-Cd-F - 80.15(11)-82.67(11) 76.52(17)-80.70(15) 84.67(9)-94.59(9) 79.41(6)-100.59(6) N(NCS)-Cd-F - 179.27(14) 171.5(3)-176.4(3) - - F-Cd-F - - - 177.84(10) 180 Fig. 3 (a) Hydrogen bonding pattern adopted by SiF6 2- anion in 3, with double NH⋅⋅⋅F bonds to cis-pyrazole groups; (b) Fragment of framework in 3 showing SiF6 2- links embedded into the metal-organic net.

Such SiF6-promoted isomerization could be particularly ease for the Me4bpz 5 structures, since the twisted conformation of the tecton predetermines actually angular orientation of two M-N vectors.9e,12a The latter excludes limitations imposed by octahedral coordination geometry of the metal ions and therefore many pecilar topological archetypes (kgm, lvt, pts) are possible 10 for Me4bpz systems (Table 4), unlike the common rod-like connectors (cf. 4,4’-bipyridine).19 In 2, the metal-organic linkage exists in the form of corrugated square grid layers (44), which are cross-linked by µ-SiF6 (Figure 4) giving rise a rarely encountered uninodal 5-coordinated net 15 with a point Schläfli symbol {44.66} (three-letter notation noz).9f,20 At the same time, four-connected [Cd(Me4bpz)2 2+] linkage in 3 exhibits binodal 3D cooperite topology ({42.84}, three-letter notation pts), which is new for [M(Me4bpz)2 2+]n species further expanding a number of observed supramolecular 20 isomers (Figure 3).

The latters are constituted by the above 2D square grid [Cd(Me4bpz)2]n subtopologies, which are cross-linked in a third direction by SiF6 2- “pillars” (Cd-F 2.32- 5 2.34 Å, Table 2). Such morphology is identical to the [M(bipy)2{SiF6}] (M = Zn, Cu) prototype.3 The 1D inorganic chains of [Cd{SiF6}]n effectively accommodate pyrazole groups by a concerted action of coordination and NH⋅⋅⋅F bonds (Figure 5) and produce a special pattern, which is similar to 1D structures 10 of CuSiF6 complexes with pyrazole8b and 5-phenylpyrazole.8a Thus a doubled functionality of the Me4bpz tecton serves for the extension of this array into the 3D framework. At the same time, NH⋅⋅⋅F bonding with the octahedral SiF6 2- is particularly important for the control over orientation of the adjacent 15 coordinated pyrazole groups and generation of flat 44 subtopologies. This may be compared with a series of S2O6 2- pillared frameworks [M(Me4bpz)2{S2O6}]⋅nH2O (M = Zn, Cd, Co),10 based upon flat Kagomé layers. Facile interconversion of kgm and sql layers is a special feature of [M(Me4bpz)2 2+] systems 20 exhibiting supramolecular isomerism within two dimensions.9g It is worth noting that trans-bridging SiF6 2- groups uniformly accept pairs of NH⋅⋅⋅F bonds from each of the successive layers (Table 3), in effect maximizing the interlayer interactions (Cd⋅⋅⋅Cd = 7.95 Å). However, the mode of such H-bonding is 25 variable, similarly to the above five-connected structures: in 4, four equatorial F atoms are functionally equivalent and each of them accepts a single strong NH⋅⋅⋅F bond (N⋅⋅⋅F = 2.800(4), 2.857(4) Å). Structure of 5 demonstrates only two such Table 5 Topology of new MOFs 1-5 and the role of SiF6 2- for the generation of additional topological links and increase of the structure dimensionality.

Such differentiation results in a progressive elongation of equatorial Si-F bonds depending on a number of H-bonded pyrazoles (Si1-F4 1.647(2), Si1-F2 5 1.6762(13) and Si1-F3 1.693(2) Å). Interestingly, the frameworks of 4 and 5, being topologically equivalent, are different in view of the metrics. In the first case, the solvent accessible area is as large as 31.1%,23 while in 5 the framework is contracted leaving 27.2% space for accommodation of CH2Cl2 guests. Moreover, 10 orientation of the Me4bpz linkers leads to shielding of the [Cd{SiF6}]n inorganic chains (Figure 6). Such effects as well as the variable bonding modes of SiF6 2- blocks suggest the possibility for fine-tuning of their steric environment and generation of accessible underbonded sites, which are relevant to 15 selective host-guest interactions and selective sorption.4,5,7 Conclusions Our study suggests significant potential of pyrazole species and SiF6 2- as co-ligands for the synthesis of framework coordination polymers based upon 1D [M(pzH)4{SiF6}]n and discrete cage-like 20 [{M(pzH)4}2{SiF6}] supramolecular synthons, those can be anticipated for a diversity of octahedral transition metal ions (Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, etc) and polyfunctional pyrazole ligands. The cationic [M(Me4bpz)2 2+]n subtopology and SiF6 2- linkers may be regarded as a perfectly fitted self-complementary system, in view 25 of either charge compensation or generation of multiple specific interactions involving coordination bonds and conventional strong hydrogen bonding. The cage-like local coordination motif of 2 and 3 is interesting also as a prototype for selective multi- center molecular receptor of SiF6 2-. Developing of protocols for 30 selective complexation of fluorosilicates has a significance in view of their wide applications for fluoridation of potable water24 and considering their hazardous properties and potential for health damage.25 Acknowledgements 35 The authors gratefully acknowledge support from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, grant KR 1675/4-3 (HK and KVD) References 1 Examples for structural significance of SiF6 2- hydrogen bonding: (a) D.

At the same time, the guest molecule adopts three orientations, for two of which the carbon atoms reside in special positions. Thus, the partial occupancy factor for the major component of the disorder (Cl1a-C12a-Cl2a) was 0.1667 (half of the occupancy defined by disorder across 3-axis) and the second part was provided by two half-molecules (Cl1b-C12b- Cl1bv and Cl1c-C12c-Cl1civ, symmetry codes: (iv) 1-y, x-y, z; (v) 1-x+y, 1-x, z) (Figure S2).

CH (methyl) and NH hydrogen atoms were added geometrically, with Uiso = 1.5Ueq of the parent C (N) atom. There are three independed solvate chloroform molecules, one of which was refined freely and anisotropically [C22-Cl = 1.709(12)- 1.729(10) Å]. Two other solvent molecules are disordered over two closely separated positions. The molecule referenced by carbon atom C23 adopts two orientations (partial contribution factors 0.5) with the common atom Cl4. Therefore, the occupancy factors were 0.5 for C23, Cl5, C6, C23A, Cl5A, C6A and 1.0 for Cl4. It was possible to refine this molecule anisotropically and without restraints in geometry [C-Cl = 1.63(2)-1.76(3) Å]. At the same time, the molecule referenced by C24 is unequally disordered over two positions with partial contributions 0.65 (C24) and 0.35 (0.35). It was left isotropic [Uiso (Cl) = 0.14-0.27 Å2], two contributions of the disordered carbon atom were assigned with an equal isotropic thermal parameter (EADP) and the restraints for the C-Cl bond lengths [1.73(1) Å] were applied in order to improve the stability of the refinement. In each case, the partial contributions were rifened with PART –n and the hydrogen atoms added with corresponding partial occupancies.

Solution in space group P42/mbc led to badly disordered model and the subsequent refinement eventually led to divergence (R1 > 0.20). Well refinable model was found in space group P42/m, with equal contributions of twin components (twin law {0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 -1}). The refinement for the framework portion was essentially standard. CH (methyl) and NH hydrogen atoms were added geometrically, with Uiso = 1.5Ueq of the parent C (N) atom. Three unique solvent molecules (one molecule in general position and two half-molecules lying across mirror planes) were located. Their atoms possess large parameters for the thermal motion, indicating possible disorder. We were not successful to resolve it. These molecules were included in calculations with fixed geometry [C-Cl = 1.7500.008 and ClCl = 2.8800.008 Å]; they were left isotropic. It was impossible to locate additional solvent molecules, although checkcif routine indicates remaining solvent accessible voids in the structure. Refinement of [Cd(Me4bpz)2{SiF6}]·6H2O (4) The crystals were twinned. They emulate orthorhombic-C lattice by pseudomerohedry (a common case of monoclinic cell with 90o), giving Rint = 0.049 and EE-1= 0.678. Solution in the orthorhombic-C space groups (for example, Cmcm) was possible leading to the poorly refinable models (R1  0.15), which involve disorder of either SiF6 2- or Me4bpz moieties, and systematically Fo 2 » Fc 2. Therefore, the data frames were integrated for the monoclinic cell ( = 90.047(8)o) and the structure successfully solved and refined as twin in monoclinic space group Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for CrystEngComm This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 C2/c. The twin law was {-1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 1} and the refined parameter BASF = 0.49734 was indicative for the equal contributions from the twin domains. Atoms of the framework were freely refined anisotropically and CH (methyl) and NH hydrogen atoms were added geometrically, with Uiso = 1.5Ueq of the parent C (N) atoms. The solvate water molecules are disordred over two positions (separated at 1.0-1.5 Å). In this way, two independed molecules are equally disordered by symmetry (O3 and O4) and were refined with partial contribution factors of 0.5. Two other molecules were unequally disordered and in both cases the partial occupancies of 0.65 and 0.35 were suggested by the refinement of thermal parameters (Uiso = 0.14-0.17 Å2). All disordered water molecules were refined isotropically and the OH hydrogen atoms were not added. Refinement of [Cd(Me4bpz)2{SiF6}]·1.5CH2Cl2 (5) Note: The non-standard monoclinic-I setting was selected accordingly to the latest IUCr recommendations (See A.D. Mighel, Acta Cryst. (2003). B59, 300-302). Atoms of the framework were freely refined anisotropically and CH (methyl) and NH hydrogen atoms were added geometrically, with Uiso = 1.5Ueq of the parent C (N) atoms. Molecule of the solvent is equally disordered across a center of inversion (Figure S5), however, a significant residual electron density in this region was indicative for contribution from a second minor orientation of this molecule. Therefore, the partial occupancies for the major component of the disorder were 0.5 (related by inversion) and 0.25 for C11A, Cl1A, Cl2A (these atoms were left isotropic). The major component was refined anisotropically. A set of geometry restraints was applied to the disordered portion: C-Cl distances were restrained at 1.74(1) Å and intramolecular contacts ClCl at 2.88(1) Å. Figure S5.
