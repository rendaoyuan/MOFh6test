Two coordination polymers [Cu(btb)(1,2-bdc)]n (6) and {[Cu2(btb)(btec) (H2O)3]0.5H2O$CH3OH]n (7) were obtained with btb, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylate (1,2-bdc) and 1,2,4,5- benzenetetracarboxylate (btec). 6 is a 4-connected 65$8-CdS 3D coordination network. 7 is a (3,4,5)- connected pillared-layer 3D porous network where [Cu2(btb)(btec)(H2O)3] 2D layers are interlinked by btb pillars. The thermal stability of 1–7 was investigated. 3 and 6 are paramagnets with a negligible magnetic interaction while antiferromagnetic coupling between Cu(II) ions is observed in 7. Introduction There has been a rapid increase in the study of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) because of their intriguing structures and potential applications as functional materials for gas storage, separation, microelectronics, photoluminescence, nonlinear optics and catalysis.1 The ligands and central metals are the keys to the design and construction of MOFs with fascinating topology and physicochemical properties. Flexible ligands are employed in the construction of MOFs with a variety of archi- tectures and topologies because ﬂexible ligands can adopt different conformations according to the geometric needs of the different metal ions.2 The anions not only balance the charges of a cationic complex but also inﬂuence the structure of a supramolecular system through coordination to the metal.3 Dunbar and coworkers reported that the reaction of 3,6-di(2-pyridyl)- 1,2,4,5-tetrazine with ﬁrst-row transition metals could yield a molecular square and a pentagon with one anion accommo- dated in the cavities of the polygons. In this case, anions function as templates through anion-p interactions.4 Because of the diversity of the coordination modes and high structural stability, polycarboxylate ligands are frequently used for the construction of MOFs. 1,2-Benzenedicarboxylate (1,2-bdc)5,6 and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate (btec)7,8 are rigid, planar molecules and have been used as bridging ligands in the synthesis of novel MOFs. On the other hand, 1- and 4- substituted 1,2,4-triazole deri- vatives have been synthesized and characterized due to their magnetic properties and novel topologies.9–11 The combination of 1- or 4-substituted 1,2,4-triazole derivatives and aromatic polycarboxylate ligands can result in novel topologies, and, magnetic and luminescence properties.12 1,4-Bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butane (btb, Chart 1) is a longer and ﬂexible ligand, which can adopt different conformations Chart 1 Three conformations of btb ligand.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) containing btb ligand exhibit a variety of architectures and topology.13,14 For example, the cadmium MOFs containing different anions [Cd(btb) (H2O)2(NO3)2]n, {[Cd(btb)2(H2O)2](BF4)2}n, {[Cd(btb)3] (ClO4)2}n and {[Cd(btb)3](PF6)2}n comprise a 1D chain, a three- fold interpenetrated diamondoid network and a threefold inter- penetrated a-polonium cubic network, respectively.13b The zinc MOFs, [Zn(btb)(H2O)3(SO4)]n comprise a 1D chain and {[Zn (btb)2(H2O)2](NO3)2$2H2O}n is an undulated 2D (4,4) network while {[Zn(btb)3](BF4)2}n and {[Zn(btb)3](ClO4)2}n exhibit similar threefold interpenetrating a-polonium cubic networks.13c [Mn(btb)2(NCS)2]n and [Co(btb)2(NCS)2]n have different inter- penetrated networks composed of 1D and 2D structures with the same chemical composition.13d,13e A number of interesting MOFs can be constructed from the btb and aromatic polycarboxylate co-ligands.13c,14 In order to extend our work on the ﬂexible bistriazole MOFs and investigate the inﬂuence of the inorganic anions on the structures of copper MOFs and design novel topologies with the aromatic polycarboxylate ligands, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylate (1,2-bdc) and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate (btec) (Chart 2), seven coordination polymers, namely, 1D linear chain [Cu(btb) (HCOO)2(H2O)2]n (1), 2D (4, 4) network [Cu(btb)2Cl2]n (2), 3D cubic network [Cu(btb)(NCS)2]n (3), threefold interpenetrating 3D diamondoid network {[Cu(btb)2(H2O)2](ClO4)2}n (4) and {[Cu(btb)2(H2O)2](NO3)2}n (5), 4-connected 65$8-CdS 3D coor- dination network [Cu(btb)(1,2-bdc)]n (6) and a (3,4,5)-connected pillared-layer 3D porous network {[Cu2(btb)(btec)(H2O)3] 0.5H2O$CH3OH]n (7) were synthesized.

X-ray crystallography Suitable single crystals of 1–7 were carefully selected under an optical microscope and glued to thin glass ﬁbers. Diffraction data were collected using Rigaku Mercury or Saturn CCD diffractometers with graphite monochromated Mo-Ka radia- tion. Intensities were collected by the u scan technique. The structures were solved by direct methods and reﬁned with a full- matrix least-squares technique (SHELXTL-97).16 The positions of hydrogen atoms of btb, 1,2-bdc and btec were determined by theoretical calculation. The parameters of the crystal data collection and reﬁnement of 1–7 are given in Tables 1 and 2. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table S1 in the ESI†. Results and discussion Description of the crystal structures [Cu(btb)(HCOO)2(H2O)2] (1). The structure of 1 is a 1D linear chain. Cu1, O1 and O2 atoms are located at the symmetry plane. Each Cu(II) atom displays a distorted octahedral coordination geometry {CuN2O4}, coordinated by four oxygen atoms from two water molecules and two HCOO anions, and two triazole nitrogen atoms (Fig. 1a). Each btb ligand exhibits the completely anti (anti-anti-anti) conformation. The btb ligands link the Cu(II) atoms to form a 1D linear chain with a Cu/Cu distance of 14.025(3) A (Fig. 1b). There are inter-chain hydrogen bonding interactions between the coordination water molecules and the oxygen atoms of HCOO ions of adjacent chains (Table S2 in ESI†). A 3D hydrogen bonding network is formed via the hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 1c). The 3D hydrogen bonding network is interesting although a number of hydrogen bonding networks are synthesized.17 [Cu(btb)2Cl2]n (2). 2 is a neutral 2D (4,4) network (Fig. 2). The coordination geometry of the Cu(II) atoms is 4 + 2 geometry by four nitrogen atoms from four btb ligands in the equatorial plane and two Cl anions in the axial positions because of the elongated Jahn–Teller distortion (Fig. S1 and Table S1 in ESI†). Each btb ligand exhibits the completely anti (anti-anti-anti) conformation. Each Cu(II) atom is bridged by four btb ligands to form a neutral 2D (4,4) network (Fig. 2) with a Cu/Cu distance of 13.408(2) A. The network contains square grids (44-membered ring), with a Cu(II) atom at each corner and a btb molecule at each edge connecting two Cu(II) atoms. The 2D (4,4) networks parallel stack along the a direction with the inter-sheet distance of the a-axis translation (Fig. S2 in ESI†). [Cu(btb)(NCS)2]n (3). 3 is a 3D cubic network. The coordina- tion geometry of the Cu(II) atom of 3 is a 4 + 2 tetragonally distorted octahedron, coordinated by four nitrogen atoms from two isothiocyanate and two btb ligands in the equatorial plane and two S atoms in the axial positions because of the elongated Jahn–Teller distortion (Fig. S3 in ESI†). Each NCS anion coordinates to two Cu(II) atoms in a m-NCS- N:S mode, and single thiocyanate bridges link the Cu(II) centers into a two-dimensional network, resulting in an ‘hourglass-sha- ped’ 16-membered [Cu4(m-NCS-N:S)4] metallocycle (Fig. 3a). The Cu/Cu distances are 6.3634(9) and 12.8350(21) A through the NCS and btb bridges, respectively. Each btb ligand exhibits the gauche-anti-gauche conformation. Each btb ligand coordi- nates two Cu(II) atoms through its two 4-position triazole N atoms to further extend the [Cu(m-NCS-N:S)2] 2D networks into a novel 3D network (Fig. 3b). {[Cu(btb)2(H2O)2](ClO4)2}n (4) and {[Cu(btb)2(H2O)2](NO3)2}n (5). 4 and 5 exhibit a similar threefold interpenetrated dia- mondoid network as {[Cd(btb)2(H2O)2](BF4)2}n.13b While {[Cd (btb)3](ClO4)2}n, {[Cd(btb)3](PF6)2}n, {[Zn(btb)3](BF4)2}n and {[Zn(btb)3](ClO4)2}n have a similar threefold interpenetrating a-polonium cubic network. [Cd(btb)(H2O)2(NO3)2]n comprises a 1D chain and {[Zn(btb)2(H2O)2](NO3)2$2H2O}n has an undulated 2D (4,4) network.13b,13c The coordination geometry of the Cu(II) atoms in 4 and 5 are 4 + 2 geometry by four nitrogen atoms from four btb ligands in the equatorial plane and two oxygen atoms from two coordi- nation water molecules in the axial positions because of the elongated Jahn–Teller distortion (Fig. S4 and S5 in ESI†). Each btb ligand exhibits the gauche-anti-gauche conformation. The four bridges formed by four btb ligands do not form a plane. Each Cu(II) centre connects four Cu(II) centres through four btb bridges in a tetrahedral mode. Therefore each Cu(II) centre constitutes a tetrahedral second building unit (Fig. 4a, Fig. S6 in ESI†). The extension of the structure into a 3D network is accomplished by connecting four btb ligands to the tetrahedral building block (Fig. S7 in ESI†). The Cu/Cu distances sepa- rated by btb bridges are 12.501(2) and 12.248(2) A for 4 and 5, respectively. The topological analysis of 4 and 5 reveals that they 6092 | CrystEngComm, 2011, 13, 6090–6098 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Downloaded by University of Saskatchewan on 04/04/2013 16:17:16.

Because the single diamondoid network has large spacious voids, it allows two more identical diamondoid networks to interpenetrate giving rise to a threefold interpenetrating network (Fig. 4d), with ClO4  and NO3  anions occupying the gap. There are hydrogen bonding interactions between coordination water molecules and O atoms of ClO4  and NO3  (Table S3 and S4 in ESI†). [Cu(btb)(1,2-bdc)]n (6). 6 is a 4-connected 65$8-CdS 3D coor- dination network. For comparison, the cadmium MOF [Cd2(btb)(1,2-bdc)2(H2O)3](H2O)4.5 has a thick 2D network containing an undulated water chain.13c The asymmetric unit of 6 has half Cu(II) atom, half 1,2-bdc and half btb ligand. Each Cu(II) is four coordinated by two triazole nitrogen atoms from two btb ligands and two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two 1,2-bdc ligands (Cu(II) is 4-connected.) (Fig. S8 in ESI†). Each carboxy- late group of 1,2-bdc ligand is monodentate (Chart 3a). The second oxygen atom of a carboxylate group shows the weak interaction with the Cu1/O2 distance of 2.603(2) A.

The MOFs exhibiting 65$8-CdS coordination network are relatively few.18 {[Cu2(btb)(btec)(H2O)3]0.5H2O$CH3OH}n (7). Compound 7 possesses a novel (3,4,5)-connected 3D network. The asymmetric unit of 7 has two Cu(II) atoms, one btec, two halves btb ligand, three coordination water, half lattice water and one methanol. Cu1 is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from three carboxylate groups of three btec ligands and one water molecule, and one triazole nitrogen atom, in a distorted square-pyramidal geometry (see Fig. S10 in ESI†) (Cu1 is 4-connected). Cu2 is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from two carboxylate groups from two btec ligands and two water molecules, and one triazole nitrogen atom, in a distorted square-pyramidal geometry (Fig. S10 in ESI†) (Cu2 is 3-connected). Three carboxylate groups of a btec ligand show the monodentate coordination mode. One carboxy- late group of a btec ligand exhibits bidentate bridging coordi- nation mode. Each btec ligand acts as a m5–bridge (btec is 5-connected) connecting ﬁve Cu(II) atoms through its four carboxylate groups (Chart 3b), resulting in a 2D [Cu2(btec) (H2O)3]n network (Fig. 7a, Fig. S11 in ESI†) with Cu1/Cu2, Cu1/Cu1E, Cu1/Cu1F and Cu1/Cu2D distances of 5.5268 (9), 9.1374(12), 8.7849(8) and 4.8242(10) A. For comparison, each of two para-carboxylate groups of btec adopts a bidentate bridging coordination mode, while each of the other adopts a monodentate coordination mode, and the whole btec ligand acts as m6-bridge linking six Cu(II) atoms to form a stepped-like 2D network in {[Cu2(btec)(H2O)4]$2H2O}n.8b Each carboxylate group shows a monodentate coordination mode and the btec acts as m4-bridge linking four Cu(II) atoms to form a 2D network in {[Cu2(btec)(H2O)6]$4H2O}n.8a Each btb ligand exhibits the gauche-anti-gauche conformation. The Cu/Cu distances bridging through btb bridges are 12.5460 (16) and 10.1107(42) A. The btb ligands pillar the [Cu2(btec) (H2O)3]n networks generating a novel 3D network (Fig. 7b). There are O–H/O hydrogen bonding interactions which sustain the water and methanol (Table S5 in ESI†). Several interesting MOFs comprised of btb and aromatic polycarboxylate co-ligands were synthesized.11c,12 For example, [Cd2(btec)(btb)3](H2O)10 has a novel 3D network containing an ‘‘opened-cube’’ with an outer edge discrete water decamer.12a {[Zn(btb)(1,4-bdc)]$5H2O}n (1,4-bdc ¼ 1,4-benzenedicarboxy- late) is a 2D (6,3) network with six Zn(II) atoms at six corners and four 1,4-bdc and two double btb at six edges.11c While {[Zn2(btb)2(1,4-bdc)2]$2H2O}n is a threefold interpenetrated diamondoid network and [Zn(btb)0.5(1,4-bdc)] adopts a three- fold interpenetrated a-polonium network.12c [Cd2(btb)(1,4- bdc)2(H2O)2] $7H2O exhibits a distorted 3D cubic topology that Fig. 1 (a) The coordination environment of Cu(II) atom of 1.

For 3, the values of cMT remain a constant of 0.42 cm3 K mol1 upon cooling to a temperature of 10–300 K and then slightly decrease in the low temperature region retaining a value 0.33 cm3 K mol1 at 1.8 K. This indicates that the magnetic coupling interaction between the Cu(II) ions is very weakly antiferromagnetic, which is further conﬁrmed by a negative Weiss constant of q ¼ 0.28 K with a Curie constant of C ¼ 0.43 cm3 K mol1 in the ﬁt of the Curie–Weiss law c1 ¼ (T:q)/C.

Published on 12 August 2011 on http://pubs.rsc.org | doi:10.1039/C1CE05466J View Article Online interaction between Cu(II) ions by the linkage of Cu/SCN-Cu, which is comparable with the reference complex.19 Similar to 3, the value of cMT of 6 is also a constant of 0.42 cm3 K mol1 from 300 K even to 5 K, and then quite slightly increases below 5 K to reach 0.435 cm3 K mol1 at 1.8 K. The data also obey the Curie– Weiss law with the parameters of q ¼ 0.013 K and C ¼ 0.42 cm3 K mol1 in the whole temperature region. The negligibly small Weiss constant implies that complex 6 is almost a paramagnet.20 The positive Weiss constant indicates the ferromagnetic interaction between Cu(II) ions, which may be ascribed to the spin-polarization mechanism of coupling by 1,2-benzenedi- carboxylate,21 so the interaction is very weak. For 7, the values of cMT decrease from 0.912 to 0.193 cm3 K mol1 in the tempera- ture region of 300–1.8 K, indicating the presence of antiferro- magnetic interaction between Cu(II) ions. The Curie Weiss constant is q ¼ 24.3 K. In this complex, the coupling inter- action between Cu(II) ions mediated by the carboxylate bridge is the main contribution, which overcomes the effect of spin- polarization by 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate, so the anferro- magnetic interaction dominates the magnetic properties of 7. Thermal stability All compounds are stable and can retain the crystallinity at room temperature for at least several weeks. TG experiments were carried out to explore their thermal stability (Fig. S12 in ESI†). In the TG curve of compound 1, the coordination water mole- cules were lost from 70 to 130 C. The remaining substance was thermally stable upon heating to 190 C. Then weight loss occured and only stopped at 500 C. No reasonable fragments can be assigned corresponding to the weight loss processes of 1. Compounds 2 and 3 were stable up to 220 and 230 C, respec- tively. Then 2 and 3 exhibited a rapid decomposition at temperatures of 280–320 and 280–380 C, respectively. Compound 4 shows that the coordination water molecules were lost from 100 to 160 C. The remaining substance was thermally stable upon heating to 260 C. But an explosion happened upon heating to 288 C. The coordination water molecules of compound 5 were lost from 78 to 160 C. The remaining substance is thermally stable upon heating to 260 C and then exhibited a rapid decomposition at temperatures of 280–325 C. Compound 6 was stable up to 160 C. Then 6 showed a gradually weight loss from 160–220 C and a rapid weight loss from 200– 300 C and a gradually weight loss from 300–500 C. The water and MeOH molecules of compound 7 were lost from 56 to 170 C. The remaining substance was stable up to 260 C. Then a continuous weight loss occurred, which did not end until 500 C. Conclusion The assembly reaction of 1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butane (btb) with different Cu(II) salts, and aromatic polycarboxylate co- ligands, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylate (1,2-bdc), and 1,2,4,5-benze- netetracarboxylate (btec) yields seven coordination polymers: a 1D linear chain [Cu(btb)(HCOO)2(H2O)2]n (1), a 2D (4, 4) network [Cu(btb)2Cl2]n (2), a 3D cubic network [Cu(btb) (NCS)2]n (3), threefold interpenetrating 3D diamondoid networks {[Cu(btb)2(H2O)2](ClO4)2}n (4) and {[Cu(btb)2(H2O)2] Fig. 7 (a) Viewing a two-dimensional [Cu2(btec)(H2O)3]n network of 7 along the c direction.

The results demonstrate that the nature of the counteranions and/or the aromatic poly- carboxylate co-ligands have a remarkable inﬂuence on the self- assembly of the ﬂexible ligand with metal atoms and construct coordination architectures with different structures. The ligand btb can adjust its conﬁguration comfortably to meet the geometric requirement of the central metal atoms, which results in a variety of fascinating coordination polymers. The btb ligands adopt two conformations, namely, the completely anti (anti-anti-anti) conformation in 1, 2 and 6, and the gauche-anti-gauche conformation in 3, 4, 5 and 7. Further- more, the thermal stability of the polymers was investigated. 3 and 6 are paramagnets with negligible magnetic interaction whilst antiferromagnetic coupling between Cu(II) ions is observed in 7.
