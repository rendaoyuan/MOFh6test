The structures of compounds 1–3 are elucidated by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Topological analysis reveals that the compound 1 is a new (4,8)-connected self-catenated network with point symbol of (32?42?52)(32?49?512?65)2 based on the trinuclear zinc clusters as an eight- connected node. 2 is an eight-connected self-catenated network with ilc topology and 3 is a 6-connected pcu network. Photoluminescent properties and thermogravimetric analyses for 1–3 were also investigated in detail. Introduction The construction of novel MOFs continues to attract great interest due to their potential applications in microelectronics, non-linear optics, porous materials, and magnetic properties, as well as their intriguing variety of architectures and topologies.1 Within this area, an important subject is the investigation of network topology, which not only is a powerful tool for simplifying the structure of complicated frameworks but also plays an instructive role in the rational design of certain functional materials with desirable properties. Up to now, network topologies in coordination polymers have been dis- cussed in several notable reviews2 following a seminal compila- tion by Wells decades ago.3 The analysis of data for existing materials reveals that the nets with high frequency are topologically symmetrical and, in particular, have small numbers of types of nodes and edges,4 such as 3-connected srs, 4-connected dia, and 6-connected pcu nets. Compared to these commonly encountered 3–6-conneted topologies, the develop- ment of higher connectivity nets (.6), with neither high- symmetry nor low-symmetry structures, is still in its early stages, which can be attributed, at least partially, to the limited coordination number of single metal centers and steric hindrance of the most commonly used organic ligands.5 One promising approach to overcome the obstacles to the construction of MOFs with highly connected nets is to use polynuclear metal clusters as nodes; their large surface areas mean that they can more readily accommodate the steric demands of organic linkers.6 However, it is only a tiny part among all of the structure types explored, and it still remains a great challenge for the exploration of MOFs with highly connected nets. On the other hand, entangled systems have attracted considerable attention because of their intriguing topological structures and potential applications.7 However, the majority of the reported entanglements fall into the interpenetrating category, as evidenced by several comprehensive reviews.8 Differing from interpenetration, self-catenated nets are char- acterized by the presence of the smallest topological rings or knots, which can be catenated by other short rings belonging to the same net. Hitherto, although considerable efforts have been directed to the construction of self-catenated nets, only a few cases are known.9 Based on the above approach, we chose 2,29-(naphthalene-1,5- diylbis(oxy))diacetic acid (H2ndd) as the carboxylate-containing ligand because the carboxylate group may induce core aggrega- tion. Meanwhile, to ensure the articulation of the clusters into an extended three-dimensional framework, a few linear linkers, 4,49-bipy, BIMB and DIMB are used concurrently. Herein we report three new metal–organic frameworks based on the mixed organic ligands: [Zn3(4,49-bipy)(ndd)2.5(m3-OH)]?2H2O (1), [Cd(BIMB)(ndd)]n (2) and [Cd(DIMB)(ndd)?2H2O]n (3). Compound 1 is a (4,8)-connected self-catenated network based on a trinuclear zinc cluster. Compound 2 exhibits a rare 8-connected self-catenated net based on binuclear cadmium clusters as an eight-connected node with point symbol of (424 6 5 6 63)-ilc and the structure of 3 shows a 6-connected classic pcu net based on the binuclear cadmium clusters as a six-connected node.

Single- crystal X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrates that compound 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1¯ and the asymmetric unit of 1 is constructed from three ZnII ions, two ndd with half occupancy, one 4,49-bipy, one m3-OH group and two free water molecules. The structure of 1 contains a trinuclear [Zn3(CO2)4(N)2] cluster with non-bonding Zn…Zn distances of 3.103–3.508 A˚ . In the trinuclear clusters, there are three crystallographically independent Zn atoms, Zn1, Zn2, and Zn3, in which each m3-OH interlinks three crystallographically unique Zn atoms. The three independent Zn atoms represented herein, exhibit three different coordination geometries. The Zn1 atom coordinates to one m3-OH moiety (Zn–O 2.202 A˚ ), four carboxylate oxygen atoms (Zn–O 2.055–2.149 A˚ ) from four different ndd ligands and one nitrogen atom (Zn–N 2.079 A˚ ) from a 4,49-bipy ligand giving a distorted octahedral geometry. The Zn2 atom is coordinated by three carboxylate oxygen atoms (Zn–O 1.964–1.986 A˚ ) from three ndd ligands and a m3-OH atom (Zn–O 2.079 A˚ )12 to complete a distorted tetrahedral environment, whereas Zn3 exists in an approximately trigonal bipyramid geometry, being ligated by one nitrogen atom (Zn–N 2.030 A˚ ) from a 4,49-bipy ligand, a m3-OH atom (Zn–O 1.995 A˚ ), and three carboxylate oxygen atoms (Zn–O 1.975– 2.250 A˚ ) from three ndd ligands, as depicted in Fig. S1.{ In 1, Zn1, Zn2 and Zn3 via one m3-OH group, form a unique trinuclear [Zn3(m3-OH)] cluster. Furthermore, the adjacent clusters are linked by the ndd and 4,49-bpy ligands and form a three-dimensional network. In compound 1, each trinuclear metal cluster is surrounded by eight organic ligands—six bridging ndd ligands and two bridging 4,49-bipy ligands with distances of 13.815–15.417 A˚ (center to center) (Fig. 1). From the topological point of view, the 4206 | CrystEngComm, 2012, 14, 4205–4209 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Published on 01 May 2012. Downloaded by Syracuse University on 23/11/2013 13:45:31. View Article Online trinuclear zinc cluster is an 8-connected node, while the ndd ligand is a 4-connected node. Thus, the 3D structure that is formed adopts an unprecedented binodal (4,8)-connected topol- ogy with the point symbol of (32?42?52)(32?49?512?65)2. Notably, the structure of 1 is an interesting self-catenated network, in which the four-membered circuits are interlocked by other four- membered circuits (Fig. S2{). Therefore, the resulting array is a binodal (4,8)-connected self-catenated network (Fig. 2). Structure of [Cd(BIMB)(ndd)]n (2). Single-crystal X-ray structure analysis reveals that compound 2 crystallized in the triclinic space group P1¯ and the fundamental building unit of 2 consists of one CdII ion, one ndd ligand and one BIMB ligand. The cadmium center has a distorted octahedral geometry and is coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from three different ndd ligands (Cd–O 2.303–2.466 A˚ ) and two nitrogen atoms from two BIMB ligands (Cd–N 2.275–2.315 A˚ )13 (Fig. S3{). In addition, two crystallographically equivalent CdII ions are bridged by two carboxylates in a bis(bidentate) fashion to furnish [Cd2(CO2)4N4] unit in which the Cd…Cd distance is 4.384 A˚ . As illustrated in Fig. 3a, each Cd2 unit is linked to the nearest neighbors with distances of 12.899–19.775 A˚ through ten bridging ligands (six ndd and four BIMB). Thus, the structure of 2 could be described as follows: firstly, the adjacent Cd ions are bridged by the carboxylate oxygen to form one-dimensional Cd–O–Cd chains running along the [101] direction. These chains are further linked by bridging bidentate carboxylate to form a 2D layer structure parallel with the [111] direction (Fig. S4{). Finally, the BIMB connects the adjacent layers leading to a 3D network (Fig. S5{). The topological analyses of the structures were performed using TOPOS programe.14 Taking the geometrical centres binuclear cadmium SBUs as network nodes, the structure of 2 can be simplified as an eight-connected network, in which the smallest four-membered circuits are interlocked with one from another network (Fig. 3b). The extension of this structure results in the self-catenated coordination net. Meanwhile, drawing inspiration from Blatov’s statement, ‘Knowing the relations between nets, one can find possible ways of transitions from one net to another’,15 further insight into the nature of this intricate architecture can be obtained by considering the net constructed from two interpenetrating primitive cubic nets (pcu or a-Po), which are cross-linked by two extra connections from each node along the cube diagonals (Fig. 3d).16 In summary, compound 2 exhibits an unusual eight-connected self-catenated coordination network with the point symbol of (424?5?63)-ilc net.17 The maximum symmetry net for this topology (with links equal to 1) is trigonal R3¯m (a = 1.291, c = 1.000) with the vertex at (0,0,0) (Fig. 3c).

View Article Online Structure of [Cd(DIMB)(ndd)?2H2O]n (3). When DIMB, a rigid N-containing ligand, is used instead of flexible ligand BIMB, a new 6-connected 3D network with a pcu topology is obtained. In the crystal structure of 3, there is one CdII ion, one ndd ligand, one DIMB ligand and two isolated water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Fig. S6{ illustrates the coordination environment of the CdII ion and the six connectivity of the bimetallic unit. One CdII ion (Cd1) in the dinuclear motif is coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms of two ndd ligands (Cd–O 2.350–2.382 A˚ ) and two nitrogen atoms of two DIMB ligands (Cd–N1 2.267–2.283 A˚ ),13 furnishing a distorted octahedral geometry. Meanwhile, two crystallographically equivalent CdII ions are bridged by two m2-carboxylate oxygen atoms of two ndd ligands to furnish a [Cd2(CO2)4N4] fragment in which the Cd…Cd distance is 3.831 A˚ . Each binuclear unit is connected to the adjacent six dinuclear cadmium clusters to generate an extended neutral 3D network (Fig. 4a), which can also be considered to be constructed from distorted 2D square-grid (4,4) layers of composition [Cd(ndd)]n pillared by the long ndd ligand (Fig. 4b). The DIMB ligand connects the adjacent layers to extend the 2D layers into a 3D structure (Fig. S7{). Notably, there are eight organic ligands (four ndd and four DIMB) surrounding each Cd2 unit, each binuclear core is linked to six nearest neighbours (six {Cd2} clusters) with distances of 14.017– 16.744 A˚ (centre to centre), because the two DIMB ligands form two ‘‘double-bridges’’. From the topological point of view, the overall topology of the 3D frame is best described as a six- connected net based on binuclear cadmium clusters with a point symbol of (412?63)-pcu topology (Fig. 4c and d). Luminescent properties Taking into account the excellent luminescent properties of ZnII and CdII, the solid-state luminescence spectra of 1–3 have been studied at room temperature. Compounds 1, 2 and 3 show the emission maxima at 507 nm (lex = 365 nm), 425 nm (lex = 342 nm) and 427 nm (lex = 349 nm), respectively. In order to understand the nature of the emission, we analyzed the photoluminescence properties of H2ndd, BIMB and DIMB ligands and found the strongest emission peaks at 474 nm (lex = 363 nm) for H2ndd, 408 nm (lex = 343 nm) for BIMB and 411 nm (lex = 300 nm) for DIMB. The emission of the ligands may be assigned to p*An and p*Ap transitions of the intra-ligands. In comparison with that of the free ligands as shown in Fig. S8– S10,{ the maximum emission wavelengths of complexes 1, 2, and 3 are slightly redshifted, which is probably due to intra-ligand charge transitions.18 In summary, compounds 1–3 show the potential fluorescence properties in the solid state at room temperature. The luminescence decay curves of 1,2 and 3 at room temperature can be well fit to a single-exponential function as I = A + B1 6 exp(2t/t1) + B2 6 exp(2t/t2). The emission decay lifetimes of compounds are t1 = 2.10 ns (17.98%) and t2 = 8.89 ns (82.02%) (x2 = 1.141) for 1, t1 = 2.67 ns (83.39%) and t2 = 7.84 ns (16.61%) (x2 = 1.006) for 2, t1 = 4.83 ns (70.89%) and t2 = 19.79 ns (19.11%) (x2 = 1.005) for 3.The luminescence lifetimes of 1, 2 and 3 are much shorter than ones from a triplet state (.1023 s), so the emissions should arise from a singlet state. The photoluminescence quantum yields of compound 1, 2 and 3 in the solid state are 0.110, 0.104 and 0.097, respectively (Fig. S11– S13{). Thermal properties To study the thermal stability of the complexes, thermogravi- metric analyses (TGA) were performed on polycrystalline samples under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 uC min21. The TG diagram of 1 displays two distinct weight losses, the first one from 25 to 100 uC and corresponds to the loss of the lattice water molecules. The observed weight loss of 3.24% is in agreement with the calculated value of 3.29%. The frameworks collapsed in the temperature range of 349–472 uC. The remaining weight may correspond to the final products of ZnO in 1 (obs 23.51%, calc 22.38%). Compound 3 displays two distinct weight losses. The first is one from 25 to 105 uC and corresponds to the loss of the lattice water molecules. The observed weight loss of 5.46% is in agreement with the calculated value of 5.68%. The frameworks collapsed in the temperature range of 339–491 uC. The remaining weight may correspond to the final products of CdO in 3 (obs 20.70%, calc 20.29%). The TG curve of 2 shows one main weight loss; the frameworks collapsed in the temperature range of 329–482 uC The remaining weight may correspond to the final products of CdO in 2 (obs 21.42%, calc 20.55%) as shown in Fig. S14–S16.{ From a PXRD experiment, we find that compounds 1, 2 and 3 are a stable networked material (Fig. S17{). The simulated and experimental PXRD patterns of 1–3 are shown in Fig. S18–S20.{ The simulated and experimental PXRD patterns are in good agreement, indicating the phase purity of the products. The differences in intensity may be due to the preferred orientation of the powder samples. Conclusions In conclusion, we have synthesized and characterized three novel compounds utilizing 2,29-(naphthalene-1,5-diylbis(oxy))diacetic acid, N-containing ligands and metal salts. Compound 1 displays a new (4,8)-connected self-catenated 3D network with the point symbol of (32?42?52)(32?49?512?65)2.
