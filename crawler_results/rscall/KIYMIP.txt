Complex 1 self-assembles into a 3D framework with unconventional 4-connected network topology, while 2 and 3 exhibit two kinds of unusual (4,8)-connected topological networks. Notably, in 1 and 2, the bpy coligand participates in the construction of their 3D frameworks, and the pH value also plays an important role to tune their space arrangements, while in 3, the bpy coligand is not involved in the ﬁnal crystalline lattice. Furthermore, a detailed investigation on their magnetic and adsorptive properties is carried out. Introduction The design and synthesis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has become an exciting and expanding approach to novel func- tional materials.1–3 Great interest has been focused on not only their ﬁne-tuning structural diversity, but also their extensively potential applications in many areas, such as catalysis, gas storage, optics, electronic conductivity, and magnetism.4–6 It is well acknowledged that the effective strategy to construct such architectures is based on relatively simple subunits, in which the nature of metal ions, coordination geometry, and number of coordination donors provided by organic ligands are all important parameters for directing the self-assembly processes. Multicarboxylate ligands constitute an important family of or- ganic building blocks and have been extensively selected to construct a variety of coordination architectures because of their robust and rich binding tendency.7,8 Furthermore, it is worth noting that their bridging ability favors the formation of cluster- like solids9 suitable for cooperative magnetic interactions or even electrical conduction,10 and their chelating ability may contribute to the thermal stability.11 Recently, we have carried out a se- ries of studies based on 4,4′-(hexaﬂuoroisopropylidene)diphthalic acid (H4hfpdpt), and found that its CdII and ZnII coordination polymers exhibit a unique ﬂuorite topology and high thermal aNational Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Ikeda, Osaka, 563-8577, Japan.

Compared with the ﬂexible ligands, such as 4,4′-(hexaﬂuoroisopropylidene)diphthalate, rigid ligands are preferred to construct MOFs due to the predictability of the resulting network structures, high structural stability, and so on.5a Herein, employing 4,4′-bipyridyl (bpy) as the rigid building block, we have hydrothermally synthesized and structurally de- termined three new 3D MOFs, [Ni2(hfpdpt)(bpy)2(H2O)2](H2O)8 (1), [Ni3(Hhfpdpt)2(bpy)4](H2O)2 (2), and [Mn2(hfpdpt)(H2O)2] (3). Their network structures, thermal stability, magnetism and nitrogen adsorptive properties have been investigated. Experimental Materials and general methods All the solvents and reagents for syntheses were commercially available and used as received. IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS 66v/s apparatus at a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1 accumulating 80 scans. The dry sample powder was mixed by KBr and treated directly in the purpose-made IR cell. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) study was executed on a Rigaku X- ray diffractometer at 40 kV, 100 mA for Cu-Ka radiation (k = 1.5406 A˚ ). Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series II analyzer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out at a ramp rate of 5 ◦C/min in a helium atmosphere using Shimadzu DTG-50 instrument from room temperature to 600 ◦C. The BET surface area was measured using an automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (ASAP2010, Mircomeritics).

Diamagnetic susceptibility of the sample was corrected by the conventional Pascal method. Results and discussion Preparation and characterization 4,4′-(Hexaﬂuoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride is insoluble in water at room temperature. To obtain pure crystals of 1–3, a strong stirring of the mixture is necessary before it is transferred to a sealed vial for hydrothermal reactions. Complexes 1 and 2 are controllably synthesized under different pH values. However, in the presence of bpy ligand, syntheses of MnII, ZnII and CdII coordination compounds with hfpdpt ligand still result in the uniform metal 4,4′-(hexaﬂuoroisopropylidene)diphthalate with the ﬂuorite topology, in which the bpy ligand is not involved in the metal coordination. The compositions of all the new materials were validated by elemental analyses and IR spectra. The phase purities of the bulk samples were identiﬁed by PXRD (Figs. S1–S3, see ESI†). Description of crystal structures [Ni2(hfpdpt)(bpy)2(H2O)2](H2O)8 (1). The molecule of 1 sits on a crystallographic two-fold axis with 2 : 1 : 2 stoichiometric ratio of Ni : hfpdpt : bpy. As shown in Fig. 1(a), each hexa-coordinate NiII atom shows a distorted octahedral geometry. The equatorial ligation is constituted by three carboxylate oxygen atoms [Ni–O 2.068(2), 2.065(3) and 2.056(2) A˚ ] of two hfpdpt ligands as well as one water molecule [Ni–Owater 2.047(3) A˚ ]. The axial sites on each NiII are occupied by N atoms of two pyridyl donors [Ni–N 2.117(3) and 2.103(3) A˚ ]. The hfpdpt ligand in 1 adopts the type-II conﬁguration to coordinate to NiII atoms (Scheme 1). In general, the hfpdpt ligand has three typical conﬁgurations (types I–III, Scheme 1) caused by the rotation of C–C bonds between the C(CF3)2 group and 2348 | Dalton Trans., 2008, 2346–2354 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008 Published on 14 March 2008.

In the case of the reported [Cd2(hfpdpt)(H2O)2] and [Zn2(hfpdpt)],12 the ligands adopt the type-I conﬁguration to coordinate to metal atoms. In complex 1, the hfpdpt ligand is completely deprotonated, in which two independent carboxylate groups adopt the unidentate and syn-anti bridging fashions, respectively. As a result, a seven-membered chelating ring is formed, in which the O(2)–Ni(1)–O(3) bond angle is 92.8(1)◦. Thus, the NiII atoms are bridged by the hfpdpt ligands to generate a 2D coordination layer, as shown in Fig. 1(b). It is interesting to note that homo-helical structures (pink sticks in Fig. 1(b)) are found in the layer, which may be attributed to the ﬂexibility of the hfpdpt ligand. The direction of these 21-helical chains is parallel to the b axis, and thus, the dimension of the helical patch (8.198(2) A˚ ) is equal to the cell period of b. The shortest Ni · · · Ni separation in the helical chain is 5.202(1) A˚ . Furthermore, the adjacent 2D layers are bridged by bpy ligands to form a 3D framework. Fig. 1(c) shows the 3D framework with open spaces for trapping the guest water molecules.15 To analyze and understand the network structure more clearly, we take advantage of the topological approach. Comparably, in the structures of [Cd2(hfpdpt)(H2O)2] and [Zn2(hfpdpt)],12 hfpdpt ligands adopt an unusual 8-connected coordination mode together with the 4-connected metal nodes to form the ﬁrst direct ﬂuorite topology. By comparison, in 1, each NiII atom and hfpdpt ligand are 4-connected nodes, and thus an unusual (66)(64.82)2 topology is formed as illustrated in Fig. 1(d) (the bpy ligands are only 2- connected spacers), which may be attributed to that the steric barrier of coordinated bpy ligands prevents more metal atoms from coordinating to hfpdpt ligands. [Ni3(Hhfpdpt)2(bpy)4](H2O)2 (2). The asymmetric unit of 2 consists of one and a half NiII, one Hhfpdpt, two bpy, and one guest water molecules. The Ni(1) atom adopts a six-coordinate octahedral geometry by coordinating to three carboxylate oxygen atoms [Ni–O 2.102(2), 2.062(1) and 2.095(1) A˚ ] of two Hhfpdpt ligands and three pyridyl nitrogen atoms [Ni–N 2.127(2), 2.089(2), and 2.136(2) A˚ ]. The Ni(2) atom, located in the two-fold axis with half a occupation in an asymmetric unit, adopts a pseudo- tetrahedral geometry to link two bidentate chelating carboxylate [Ni–O 2.056(1) and 2.148(2) A˚ ] and two pyridyl groups [Ni–N 2.044(2) A˚ ]. The hfpdpt ligand in 2 adopts a type-I conﬁguration to coordinate to NiII atoms (Scheme 1). It should be noted that the Hhfpdpt ligand is incompletely deprotonated, in which one carboxyl group is not involved in the coordination to NiII. The other three coordinated carboxylate groups adopt syn-anti biden- tate bridging, monodentate, and bidentate chelating coordination fashion, respectively, to link three NiII atoms, collaborating with bpy ligands to result in a 3D framework (Fig. 2(c)). Interestingly, two NiII atoms [Ni(1) and Ni(1A)] and two car- boxylate groups [O(3)C(8)O(4), and O(3A)C(8)O(4A)] related by an inversion center form an octameric dimetallocycle (Fig. 1(a)). This octameric dimetallocycle linking two Hfpdpt and six bpy ligands can be simpliﬁed as an 8-connected node. On the other hand, the Ni(2) atom adopts a pseudo-tetrahedral coordination conﬁguration to link two Hfpdpt and two bpy ligands as a 4-connected node (Fig. 2(b)). Thus a unique (4,8)-connected topological network is formed (Fig. 2(d)). So far, a variety of uninodal networks have been reported16 and higher-dimensional nets with mixed connectivity are quite rare.17,18 To the best of our knowledge, only three (4,8)-connected metal–organic networks have been reported up to now.12,18 It should be noted that the (4,8)-connected network observed in 2 is a new type, which is different from those reported compounds with ﬂuorite topology. It is also the ﬁrst case of a (4,8)-connected network constructed by mixed ligands. [Mn2(hfpdpt)(H2O)2] (3). Complex 3 represents the isostruc- tural crystalline product of [Cd2(hfpdpt)(H2O)2].12 The asym- metric unit of 3 consists of one MnII, half a hfpdpt, and one water molecule. The Mn(1) atom adopts a ﬁve-coordinate pseudo-tetrahedral geometry by coordinating to four carboxyl oxygen atoms [Mn–Ocarboxylate 2.085(2), 2.098(2), 2.121(2), and 2.180(2) A˚ ] and one water oxygen atom [Mn–Owater 2.199(2) A˚ ] (Fig. 3(a)), while the CdII atom in [Cd2(hfpdpt)(H2O)2] adopts a six-coordinate environment.12 The shortest Mn · · · Mn distance is 3.719(1) A˚ . The hfpdpt ligand in 3 adopts the type-I conﬁguration to coordinate to metal atoms (Scheme 1). Each hfpdpt ligand links eight MnII atoms by four carboxylate groups in a uniform syn- syn bidentate bridging fashion to result in a (4,8)-connected 3D network, in which MnII atom and ligand act as nodes (Fig. 3(b) and (c)). The (4,8)-connected network of 3 is another metal– organic framework replica of ﬂuorite mineral, similarly to those of [Zn2(hfpdpt)] and [Cd2(hfpdpt)(H2O)2].

View Article Online Thermal stabilities of 1–3 There was no evidence of crystal decay during X-ray data collection of complexes 1–3, which are stable at the ambient conditions. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were performed to investigate their thermal stabilities. The TGA curves of 1–3 are shown in Fig. 4. For complex 1, the ﬁrst step of weight loss (12.97%) observed in the range of 40–240 ◦C corresponds to evacuation of four guest water molecules (13.26%). Notably, the host framework of 1 remains intact after losing the guest water molecules, as indicated by the PXRD patterns (Fig. S3, see ESI†). Beyond 240 ◦C, the residue host framework starts to decompose, accompanied with the loss of the coordinated water molecules, and does not end until 600 ◦C. This may be attributed to the release of coordinated water breaking the octahedral coordination environment of NiII, and ﬁnally resulting in the decomposition of the framework. For 2, the TGA curve shows the weight loss of the guest water molecules (calcd: 2.00%; observed: 2.01%) in the temperature range of 70–125 ◦C. The host framework starts to decompose beyond 330 ◦C, and does not end until 600 ◦C. It is worth noting that the thermostability of complex 2 is higher than that of 1, which is probably attributed to the compact stacking nature of the 3D framework in 2. In 3, the weight loss of the coordinated water molecules (calcd: 5.78%; observed: 5.53%) starts from 200 ◦C and ends at 270 ◦C. The host framework starts to decompose beyond 460 ◦C, and does not end until 600 ◦C. Among the three complexes, complex 3 exhibits the highest thermostability. We presume that the unique ﬂuorite topology and the strong metal–carboxylate interactions tighten the backbone of the ligand to enhance the resistance to pyrolysis. Fig. 4 The TG curves of 1–3. Magnetic properties of NiII (S = 1) complexes 1 and 2 Temperature variations of vT and 1/v for complexes 1 and 2 are plotted in Fig. 5 and 6, respectively, where v is the magnetic susceptibility for one mole of NiII (S = 1) ions. The vT value slightly increased and showed a maximum near 10 K for both complexes. This behavior is most likely caused by weak exchange interaction between NiII atoms, the zero-ﬁeld splitting (ZFS) of the metal atoms, or both at the same time. Complex 1 has a homo- helical chain along the b axis in a 2D coordination layer in the Fig. 5 Temperature variations of vT and 1/v for one mol of NiII (S = 1) for complex 1. Solid curve and line are the results of ﬁtting. ab crystal plane and the shortest Ni · · · Ni distance of 5.202(1) A˚ appears in this chain, while the Ni · · · Ni distances between the chains in ab plane and between the 2D coordination layers are 9.038(2) and 11.307(3) A˚ , respectively. Since a formulation of v for a helical chain of NiII atoms with ZFS will be complicated and the magnetic interaction in a chain will be small, we take into account ZFS of the NiII atoms and interactions among NiII atoms in the molecular ﬁeld approximation (H = −2zjSz⟨Sz⟩) for the analysis of vT of complex 1. In this approximation, vT of 1 can be written as eqn (1):19–21 (1) where the susceptibility of monomeric NiII atom with ZFS is written by eqn (2):20,21 (2) D is the ZFS parameter of Ni(II) (S = 1) atom, zj is the mag- netic interaction among monomeric NiII atoms in the molecular ﬁeld approximation, Na is the correction term of temperature independent paramagnetism and the other parameters have their usual meanings. Deﬁnition of plus or minus sign of D is differs in references. We adopted the deﬁnition of Ginsberg’s formulation in this paper.16,19 The best ﬁt to the experimental data of vT is shown by solid curve in Fig. 5. The g value is 2.08, the ZFS parameter is D = −9.1 K and Na = 4.3 × 10−6 emu/(Ni/1 mol). The magnetic interaction estimated by molecular ﬁeld approximation is weakly ferromagnetic (zj = 0.82 K). This result suggests the weak ferromagnetic coupling in a helical chain, since Ni · · · Ni distances between the chains are much longer than the distance in a chain. 1/v is also ﬁtted by the Curie–Weiss equation v = Ng2lB 2S(S + 1)/{3kB(T −h)} between 14 and 300 K. The best-ﬁt parameters are h = 0.44 K and g = 2.08 for S = 1 of NiII atom. Complex 2 includes two crystallographically independent NiII atoms. Ni(1) and Ni(1A) related by an inversion center form a dimer, in which the Ni(1) · · · Ni(1A) distance is 4.803(2) A˚ and two NiII atoms are doubly linked by two carboxylate groups to form an octameric dimetallocycle. The monomeric Ni(2) is apart from Ni(1) and Ni(1A) by 13.787(3) and 13.517(2) A˚ . Inter-dimer distances are more than 16 A˚ .

Here, we employ eqn (3) for the analysis of experimental vT value of complex 2, (3) where the ﬁrst term comes from dimeric unit (Ni(1) and Ni(1A)), the second term is from the monomeric unit (Ni(2)) and Na is the correction term of temperature independent paramagnetism. The ﬁrst term of eqn (1) can be written as follows.22,23 (4) where (5) J is intra-dimer exchange interaction (H = −2JS1·S2), D is the ZFS parameter of NiII atoms of the dimeric unit and the other parameters have their usual meanings. The second term of eqn (3) can be written as:20,21 (6) The value D′ is the ZFS parameter of the NiII atom of the monomeric unit. The same g values were assumed for the dimeric and monomeric unit to minimize the number of adjusting parameters. The best ﬁt to the experimental data of vT between 2 and 250 K is shown by the solid curve in Fig. 6. The exchange interaction in the dimeric unit is weakly ferromagnetic, J = 2.8 K and the g value is 2.19. ZFS parameters are D = −6.2 K and D′ = −8.6 K for the dimeric and monomeric NiII atoms, respectively. A contribution of temperature independent paramagnetism is Na = 40.9 × 10−6emu/(Ni/1 mol). Values of g and |D| of 2 are comparable to that of 1 and those of the NiII dimer of [Ni2(en)2Cl4]Cl2 (g = 2.242, |D| = 6.88 K).24 The ferromagnetic intra-dimer interaction of compound 2 is smaller than that of [Ni2(en)2Cl4]Cl2 (J = 13.9 K), since two NiII atoms of [Ni2(en)2Cl4]Cl2 are linked by two Cl ions to form a four-membered ring. Other NiII dimers, in which two NiII atoms in a dimer are linked by two oxygen atoms to form four-membered ring, showed similar values of J and |D|.25 1/v was also ﬁtted by the Curie– Weiss equation v = Ng2l2 BS(S + 1)/{3kB(T −h)} between 14 and Fig. 6 Temperature variations of vT and 1/v for one mol of NiII (S = 1) for complex 2. Solid curve and line are the results of ﬁtting. 300 K. The best-ﬁt parameters are h = 2.21 K and g = 2.19 for S = 1 of NiII atom. Magnetic property of MnII (S = 5/2) compound 3 Temperature variations of vT and v for two mol of MnII (S = 5/2) of 3 are plotted in Fig. 7. The value of v exhibited a characteristic maximum near 10 K and decrease of vT value as decreasing temperature indicates an antiferromagnetic interaction among Mn atoms. All the Mn atoms are crystallographically equivalent. The shortest Mn · · · Mn distance of 3.719(1) A˚ appears in Mn–O(4)– C(7)–O(3)–Mn linkage, while all other Mn · · · Mn distances are longer than 5.114(1) A˚ . Therefore, we used the MnII–MnII dimer model for the magnetic interaction of 3, where the temperature dependence of vT can be written by eqn (7):20 (7) where x = exp(−J/kT) (8) The value J is the intra-dimer exchange interaction (H = −2JS1·S2) and the other parameters have the usual meanings.

View Article Online The best ﬁt curves to the experimental data of vT (Mn/2 mol) and v(Mn/2 mol) between 2 and 300 K are shown by the solid curves in Fig. 7. The exchange interaction in a dimeric unit is antiferromagnetic, J = −1.2 K, the g value is 1.99 and the reﬁnement parameter is 0.9985. Since the ﬁtting is excellent, a dimeric character is dominant for the magnetism of 3. 1/v was also ﬁtted by the Curie–Weiss equation v = Ng2l2 BS(S + 1)/{3kB(T − h)} between 8 and 300 K. The best-ﬁt parameters are h = −11.5 K and g = 2.02 for S = 5/2 of MnII atom. Nitrogen adsorption capability Complex 1 possesses open spaces including guest water molecules, in which PXRD patterns indicate that the host framework remains intact after loss of guest molecules (Fig. S1, see ESI†). Thus, it is feasible to investigate the porosity and gas adsorption capability of dehydrated 1. The potential void volume and its accessibility in 1 (how easily guest molecules can be put into the structure from the outside) were calculated by the potential solvent volume module of the Platon procedure.26 The total potential void volume of the open space in 1 is estimated to be 20.7% (461.7 A˚ 3) of the volume of the unit cell (2233.6 A˚ 3). The nitrogen adsorption behavior of 1 has been examined at 77 K. A known weight (322 mg) of the as-synthesized sample was placed in the quartz tube, which, prior to measurements, was dried under high vacuum at 200 ◦C for 10 h to remove the guest molecules. Complex 1 possesses a BET surface area of 23 m2/g and Langmuir surface area of 30 m2/g. Approximately 10 mL N2 was adsorbed in the intra-surface per 1.0 g of desolvated sample in the range of 0–0.7 atm (Fig. 8), and from 0.7 to 1.0 atm, 40 mL N2 was adsorbed in the outer-surface of sample (Fig. S4, see ESI†). Complex 1 exhibits low porosity with regard to nitrogen sorption.27,28 Fig. 8 N2 adsorption isotherm of 1 at 77 K (Po = 1 atm). Conclusion and perspective In the present work, two NiII and one MnII metal–organic frameworks have been synthesized, based on 4,4′-(hexaﬂuoroiso- propylidene)diphthalate and 4,4′-bipyridyl coligand, which dis- play various 3D structures and topological networks. Apparently, structural difference between the two NiII complexes largely lies on the effect of pH value, and the MnII as well as the reported ZnII and CdII complexes is insensitive to the presence of bpy coligand. Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit ferromagnetic interactions among the NiII atoms, and complex 3 shows antiferromagnetic interactions among the MnII atoms. In conclusion, this work represents the rational modulation and control of the network structures of MOFs with ﬂexible multicarboxylate ligands. The results encourage us to make further efforts on such studies and promise new insights for the further development and realization of crystal engineering.
