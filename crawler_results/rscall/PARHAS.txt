E-mail: cahill@gwu.edu Received 18th February 2005, Accepted 9th May 2005 First published as an Advance Article on the web 23rd May 2005 Two novel calcium–adipate framework materials have been synthesized hydrothermally. GWMOF-7 ([Ca(C6H8O4)(H2O)2]·(C10H8N2)) and GWMOF-8 ([Ca(C6H8O4)(H2O)2]·(C12H12N2)) both formed three-dimensional structures and were characterized with single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Thermal properties were also studied with thermogravimetric analysis, and show that these structures undergo a solid-state transformation into a denser three-dimensional framework. Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have advanced into a substantial ﬁeld of research over the past several years.1–16 MOFs are porous materials composed of metal centers linked together through directional bonding using one or more distinct organic “linker” molecules. These materials possess similar properties and functionalities as their purely inorganic counter- parts (zeolites, aluminophosphates, etc.), but offer much more versatility in terms of construction and pore topology. The key to unlocking their full potential is the development of a means through which to precisely tailor the pores to a speciﬁc function. One manner of achieving this, considering a metal of a given coordination sphere, is by carefully selecting an appropriate organic component whose size and geometry will induce the desired pore geometry. A novel approach to accomplishing this same purpose is to introduce an organic compound that will not coordinate to the metal center and instead act as a template during crystal growth to direct the formation of the overall topology.17–20 The use of templates in the synthesis of zeolites and similar materials is quite mature,21–27 and as such, we have demonstrated the extension of this approach to MOF syntheses. MOFs with occluded guests (other than residual solvent molecules) are rare, yet examples within transition metal systems have been synthesized. One system has involved a zinc MOF in which 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate and 4,4′-dipyridyl were used in an attempt to synthesize a mixed ligand MOF.18 Instead, the 4,4′-dipyridyl did not coordinate to the zinc, but rather served as a potential templating species. Another system19 included a series of manganese MOFs where templates were explicitly chosen as being distinct from the linker molecules. In this work, several alkylammonium salts were introduced into these syntheses to serve as charge balancing entities. Shifting to the lanthanide series, a cerium–adipate has been reported in which excess adipic acid was found within the channels of the framework along with guest water molecules. The excess adipic acid molecules were uncoordinated and highly ordered. This represented a rare example of a situation where a neutral guest molecule hinted at a role as a structure directing agent rather than simply ﬁlling void space as is usually seen with excess solvent molecules residing in the channels. A similar result was also achieved in our laboratory, but with a praseodymium–adipate instead. This praseodymium–adipate (GWMOF-3, [Pr2(C6H8O4)3(H2O)4]·(C6H8O4)(H2O)4)20 was the springboard from which our current work with templated MOFs stemmed. We have adopted an approach based on hard–soft acid–base considerations28,29 to identify several possible templating agents for use in the GWMOF-3 system. The reasoning here is that lanthanide ions (Ln3+) are more likely to coordinate to carboxylic functional groups as opposed to a somewhat softer functional group such as a pyridyl ring. Using this approach, we have re- cently produced GWMOF-6 ([Ln2(C6H8O4)3(H2O)2]·(C10H8N2) (Ln = Nd, Ce, Sm, and Eu)), a compound that is perhaps an ideal example of a truly templated lanthanide MOF. As an extension of this work, Ca2+ was chosen as a possible substitute to the Ln3+ metal center due to comparable sizes of their ionic radii (126.6 and 126 pm for 8-coordinate Pr3+ and Ca2+, respectively, 131.9 and 132 pm for 9-coordinate Pr3+ and Ca2+, respectively).30 In this contribution, we explore the generality of producing templated MOFs with the synthesis of two novel calcium– adipate frameworks. In one, 4,4′-dipyridyl guest molecules reside within the channels of the framework, and in the other, 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane is found in the channels, re- sulting in two new MOF compounds with structures clearly inﬂuenced by the presence of these templating species. Upon removal of these templates through heating, both structures undergo a solid-state transformation into a three-dimensional calcium–adipate framework (Ca(C6H8O4)).31 As such, we re- port the synthesis, structures, and thermal properties of GWMOF-7 ([Ca(C6H8O4)(H2O)2]·(C10H8N2)) and GWMOF-8 ([Ca(C6H8O4)(H2O)2]·(C12H12N2)). Experimental Synthesis GWMOF-7 and -8 were synthesized via hydrothermal methods in a 23 mL Teﬂon lined Parr bomb under autogenous pressure for three days at 120 ◦C. An aqueous solution of calcium nitrate (CaNO3·4H2O), adipic acid (C6H8O4), template (4,4′-dipyridyl (C10H8N2) or 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane) (C12H12N2)), and water was made in molar ratios of 1 : 2 : 1 : 320. The solution was then adjusted to a pH of 10 with concentrated ammonium hydroxide before placing the bomb in the oven. After cooling to room temperature, clear, colorless cubic crystals (GWMOF- 7) or clear, colorless rhombohedral crystals (GWMOF-8) were isolated from the supernatant liquid, washed with water followed by ethanol, and left to air dry at room temperature.

View Article Online / Journal Homepage / Table of Contents for this issue A major product of the synthesis of GWMOF-7 was a cocrystallization product of the organic components: adipic acid and 4,4′-dipyridyl resulting in (C10H8N2:C6H10O4).32 After several, careful washings with ethanol and using a sonicator, crystals of GWMOF-7 were successfully isolated. Though not completely eliminated from the synthesis, it was found through systematic variation of experimental conditions that a pH of 10 or higher greatly hindered the cocrystallization to a point where it was signiﬁcantly reduced as a product. Elemental analysis conﬁrmed the purity of the GWMOF- 7 sample after rinsing with ethanol several times [obs (calc)]: C, 49.92% (51.05%), H, 5.40% (5.37%); N, 7.44% (7.44%). Elemental analysis likewise conﬁrmed the purity of the as synthesized sample of GWMOF-8 [obs (calc)]: C, 52.84% (53.45%); H, 6.05% (5.99%); N, 6.99% (6.93%). These analyses were performed by Galbraith Laboratories, Knoxville, TN. Further characterization of the samples was DONE by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and IR. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected on a Scintag XDS 2000 diffractometer (Cu Ka, 3–60◦, 0.05◦step, 1.0 s step−1) and manipulated using the JADE software package.33 TGA was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris1 at a temperature range of 30–600 ◦C (10 ◦C min−1) with ﬂowing N2(g). A Perkin-Elmer Spectrum RX I FT-IR was used to gather IR spectra using KBr pellets. Single crystal X-ray diffraction Single crystals of GWMOF-7 and 8 were isolated from the bulk reaction products and mounted on glass ﬁbers for data collection (Table 1). GWMOF-7 was analyzed at room temperature on a Bruker P4 diffractometer utilizing Mo-Ka radiation and an APEX CCD detector. Nearly a hemisphere of data was collected using a combination of φ and x scans and 20 s exposures. Data were integrated using the Bruker program SAINT34 and corrected for absorption using a semi-empirical routine within XPREP.35 The structure of GWMOF-7 solved readily in P21/c using the SIR92 program36 and reﬁned using SHELXL-9737 within the WINGX software suite.38 The calcium, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon atom positions were identiﬁed immediately, whereas hydrogen atom positions were placed in Table 2 Selected bond lengths and angles GWMOF-7 (C32H40Ca2N4O12) Ca(1)–O(1) 2.3485(17) A˚ O(2)–Ca(1)–O(1) 51.30(5)◦ Ca(1)–O(2) 2.4815(17) A˚ O(4)–Ca(1)–O(3) 79.70(6)◦ Ca(1)–O(3) 2.4869(17) A˚ O(5)–Ca(1)–O(6) 100.13(7)◦ Ca(1)–O(4) 2.3607(17) A˚ C(10)–C(9)–C(14) 122.4(2)◦ Ca(1)–O(5) 2.428(2) A˚ Ca(1)–O(6) 2.436(2) A˚ GWMOF-8 (C18H24CaN2O6) Ca(1)–O(1) 2.4494(10) A˚ O(5)–Ca(1)–O(6) 108.84(4)◦ Ca(1)–O(2) 2.3647(9) A˚ O(1)–Ca(1)–O(2) 51.22(3)◦ Ca(1)–O(3) 2.3604(9) A˚ O(4)–Ca(1)–O(3) 51.07(3)◦ Ca(1)–O(4) 2.4668(10) A˚ C(13)–C(14)–C(15) 115.13(12)◦ Ca(1)–O(5) 2.3939(10) A˚ C(9)–C(8)–C(12) 117.01(14)◦ Ca(1)–O(6) 2.4067(10) A˚ calculated positions and allowed to ride on the coordinates of the parent atom.

Structural discussion The structure of GWMOF-7 may be considered as a three- dimensional framework constructed through one-dimensional chains of CaO8 polyhedra propagating in the [001] direction.

View Article Online These chains are linked together through adipate ions in the [100] and [010] directions to create a three-dimensional connectivity (Figs. 1 and 2). The CaO8 polyhedra are edge-shared through a bridging tridentate carboxylic acid functional group containing O1, O2, O3, and O4. There are also two water molecules (O5 and O6) around each calcium center. Within the channels of the framework reside neutral molecules of 4,4′-dipyridyl. The 4,4′-dipyridyl molecules point towards opposite corners of the channels and stack along [001] in a staggered fashion. Each molecule is rotated approximately 57◦with respect to its nearest neighbor (as measured between neighboring nitrogen atoms) as shown in Fig. 1, perhaps as a means to maximize hydrogen bonding (2.890(4) A˚ for O6 · · · N1 and 2.884(4) A˚ for O5 · · · N2) between the aromatic nitrogen and the bound water molecules on the calcium. The 4,4′-dipyridyl molecules are also slightly twisted with a torsion angle of 32.0◦. Though a range of torsion angles is quite common when 4,4′-dipyridyl is present in solid- state structures (both coordinated and uncoordinated),40 this may contribute to their staggered stacking pattern to give way to the sterics induced by this twisted geometry.

The structure of GWMOF-8 (Figs. 3 and 4) is nearly identical to that of GWMOF-7. GWMOF-8 may also be considered as a three-dimensional framework constructed through one- dimensional chains of CaO8 polyhedra propagating in the [001] direction linked together by adipate ions in the [100] and [010] directions to create a three-dimensional framework. The CaO8 polyhedra are edge-shared in a bridging tridentate motif with oxygen atoms O1, O2, O3, and O4. Additionally, there are two bound water molecules (O5 and O6) around each calcium center. Within each channel, as viewed down [001], there are two molecules of 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane residing side by side. These molecules are crystallographically ordered and stack upon one another with the ends of the molecules pointing to opposite corners of the pore.

The channel geometry for both structures is quite similar, yet that of GWMOF-8 is altered slightly to accommodate the size of a larger template molecule (Fig. 5). Channel dimensions (based on Ca–Ca center to center distances for a more consistent comparison) show an increase from 10.8 × 11.4 A˚ in GWMOF- 7 to 10.7 × 12.0 A˚ in GWMOF-8. This increase also causes the bond angles (likewise measured between interlayer Ca atoms) to become slightly more acute in GWMOF-8, deviating from the nearly cubic shape of the GWMOF-7 channels. In addition, 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane is more ﬂexible than 4,4′-dipyridyl and thus twists so that each aromatic end within the molecule is perpendicular to the other. In a similar motif, the aromatic ends of the two molecules residing next to each other in the channel are also orthogonal to each other (Fig. 6). This may allow for additional room in the pore to accommodate two molecules rather than just one as is seen with the more rigid 4,4′-dipyridyl. Fig. 5 Pore dimensions of GWMOF-7 (left) and GWMOF-8 (right). The orientation and distance between the pyridyl rings in both MOFs suggests that p-stacking may be an additional factor to consider when analyzing templating in MOF systems.

Note that each end of an individual molecule is orthogonal to the other. Likewise, the ends of adjacent molecules are also orthogonal to one another, allowing for p–r interactions from aromatic hydrogen atoms (not shown) to the neighboring pyridine ring. PLATON41 is 4.316 A˚ , which is a bit far for p–p interactions, though not unprecedented.42 It is unlikely that GWMOF-7 would demonstrate any p–r interactions between a hydrogen atom on one pyridyl ring and the aromatic ring below it even though they are twisted in a way to permit such an interaction. As such, PLATON did not locate this type of interaction. GWMOF-8 was likewise analyzed and the shortest center of gravity to center of gravity position (also from the center of pyridyl rings) was shown to be 4.815 A˚ . This distance does indeed seem quite far for feasible interaction. Just the same, we do ﬁnd p–r interactions from H15 · · · C(g)2 at 2.79 A˚ , where C(g)2 is in the center of the pyridyl ring containing N2. Similarly, there are p–r interactions between H10 · · · C(g)1, where C(g)1 is the center of the pyridyl ring containing N1. This interaction is not surprising (see Fig. 6) since the pyridyl rings in each template are orthogonal to the pyridyl rings in the template directly next to it. It is thus apparent that p–p or p–r interactions should be examined carefully when analyzing possible templates for future work as well as to help explain the high degree of ordering that these guests display within the channels (as compared to residual space-ﬁlling solvent molecules seen in other systems). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on both materials to explore thermal stability and decomposition (Fig. 7). Both materials give similar TGA proﬁles, with an initial weight loss starting at 150 ◦C of approximately 45.1% for GWMOF-7 and 49.6% for GWMOF-8. In both samples, this is attributed to the loss of the template molecule and one bound water (calculated to be 46.3% and 50.0%, respectively). At this temperature, both materials undergo a solid-state transfor- mation into a previously reported calcium–adipate framework32 (Fig. 8), as conﬁrmed by powder X-ray diffraction of the post- TGA product. The loss of the template molecules and one bound water molecule was also conﬁrmed with IR spectroscopy. These weight losses are slightly lower than calculated and upon close examination of the dehydrated samples, and subsequent analysis with PXRD, a very small percentage of the overall bulk does not Fig. 8 The solid-state transformation of GWMOF-7 and -8 to a calcium-adipate framework.

Further weight loss is seen starting at 400 ◦C with a weight loss of approximately 27.4% for GWMOF-7 and 22.5% for GWMOF-8. In both instances, calcium carbonate (PDF # 47–1743) is formed as evidenced by powder XRD, and resulting in a theoretical residual mass percent of 26.6% (observed: 27.5%) and 24.7% (observed: 27.9%). Discussion and conclusion Templating The results of these syntheses together with previous work performed in our laboratory contribute to our understanding of the conditions through which a neutral molecule may be introduced into a MOF system as a template, as well as the inﬂuences such an inclusion has on overall topology and MOF properties.20 Upon initial inspection of probable template molecules and subsequent syntheses, it becomes clear that orientation of possible hydrogen bonding sites is of particular importance. Several syntheses were attempted with such po- tential template molecules as 2,2′-dipyridyl, 2,4′-dipyridyl, and several ﬁve-membered heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen. These attempts resulted in synthesizing previously reported non-templated structures2,20 or crystalline powders from which structures have yet to be determined. Thus, unhindered sites capable of hydrogen bonding may contribute to the stability of templated MOFs during crystal growth, perhaps serving as anchor points to the bound water molecules around the metal centers, helping to bring the framework together. p-stacking considerations may also be important, as discussed above. The size of the template molecule is obviously another factor to take into consideration. Attempts to include smaller template molecules (e.g., pyrazine) into the Ln/Ca–adipate MOF systems have not been successful, perhaps due to the fact that it is much smaller than the pore into which is would be included. An examination of the ligand length versus template size may be an important consideration in the development of a synthesis Fig. 7 Thermogravimetric analyses of GWMOF-7 (left) and GWMOF-8 (right). The ﬁrst weight loss is attributed to the removal of one bound water molecule and the template molecule. The second weight loss is decomposition of the framework to calcium carbonate. 2 1 1 4 D a l t o n T r a n s . , 2 0 0 5 , 2 1 1 1 – 2 1 1 5 Published on 23 May 2005.

Finally, molecular ﬂexibility has played an important role in our study of template inclusion, as already discussed above. Conclusion In conclusion, two new templated Ca–adipate MOFs are re- ported, demonstrating the generality of using structure directing agents in MOF syntheses. The potential that MOFs offer for extensive topological control through careful selection of the organic linker may be further expanded through consideration of template molecules. Furthermore, the similarity between the structures of GWMOF-7 and -8 lends support to the argument that the guest molecules are indeed true templates, seeing that each guest molecule uniquely inﬂuences pore topology. These results denote the potential to produce a vast magnitude of new materials through MOF synthetic routes. Though these results are promising, additional work is needed in order to fully understand and describe the nature in which templates may be incorporated into MOF syntheses. These considerations will be explored in future endeavors. Other directions will be efforts to “dope” GWMOF-7 and GWMOF- 8 with a lanthanide metal to incorporate electronic properties to these materials. Gas sorption studies are also planned to investigate the effect that a template has on such behavior, considering the possibility of increased sorption sites within the channels.
