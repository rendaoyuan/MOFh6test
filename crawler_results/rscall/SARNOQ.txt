In addition, it also exhibits efﬁcient drug delivery capacity. Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have drawn considerable attention in recent years and are being evaluated for diverse potential applications.1,2 Remarkably, the permanent porosity, tunable pore sizes and shape, as well as exceptional thermal and chemical stability of MOFs permit their potential applications in gas adsorption and selective separation. The well-known zeolite structures are composed of tetrahedral Si(Al)O4 units covalently joined by bridging oxygen atoms to produce varied important porous inorganic materials.3 Zeolitic metal imidazolate frame- works, as the prominent subfamily of zeolite-like MOFs (ZMOFs), have emerged as promising candidates for gas storage and separations.4,5 Among the large family of known ZMOFs, the sodalite (SOD)-type materials are noteworthy for their high porosity and exceptional stability and have potential application prospects in many ﬁelds. The most outstanding example of them is ZIF-8 ([Zn(mim)2], Hmim ¼ 2-methylimidazole).6 Generally, the reported SOD-type ZMOFs have been constructed from imidazolate derivatives and different metal ions. Therefore, it is an important and challenging task to explore the appropriate organic linkers and suitable metal for the preparation of SOD- type ZMOFs. Recently, great efforts have been devoted to developing versatile strategies for the capture and storage of CO2 in an environmentally benign and economical fashion.7 ZMOFs possess potential application in CO2 capture and sorption, and more efforts have been dedicated to improve their capture and sorption ability at ambient temperature. CO2 adsorbance is related to porous functionality, and surface characteristic is another important feature in controlling porous functionalities besides pore size and shape. One promising strategy for enhancing carbon dioxide adsorption is to introduce coor- dinatively unsaturated metal centers on the pore surface of MOFs.8 Another high achievement on the CO2 uptake is asso- ciated with the incorporation of ﬂexible C–O–C bonds or alkylamines in MOFs.9,10 The third approach to increase CO2 adsorbant amount is the presence of amine-functionalized aromatic linkers in MOFs.5b,11,12 In general, the enhancement of CO2 adsorbance for amine-functionalized MOFs results from the presence of a free NH2 group and uncoordinated nitrogen atoms. How is the CO2 uptake of MOFs constructed from a N- rich aromatic ligand without NH2 group? The abundant unco- ordinated nitrogen atoms from the aromatic ligand exist in the MOFs, which means the pores of the MOFs possess a high percentage of open N-donor sites. Does this promote CO2 adsorbance or not? This inspired us to employ a high nitrogen content ligand for the preparation of ZMOF and it might serve as a model system for studying the inﬂuence of uncoordinated nitrogen atoms from an N-rich aromatic ligand on CO2 uptake. With this in mind, we designed and synthesized H3L (H3L ¼ 4,5-di(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-2H-1,2,3-triazole)13 with the precursor of 2H-1,2,3-triazole-4,5-dicarbonitrile as the bridging linker for the fabrication of new zeolite-like framework for high CO2 aInstitute of Functional Material Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, P.

Fortunately, a highly porous ZMOF, [Zn(HL)]$DMA (IFMC-1, IFMC corresponds to Institute of Functional Material Chemistry) was successfully synthesized and structurally char- acterized. It exhibits high CO2 uptake and selective CO2/N2 adsorption capacity. For the ﬁrst time, we investigated the inﬂuence of a large number of uncoordinated nitrogen atoms from aromatic rings for CO2 adsorption in ZMOFs. In addition, it exhibits efﬁcient drug delivery capacity. Results and disscussion Reaction of Zn(NO3)2$6H2O and H3L in DMA yields colorless polyhedral crystals formulated as [Zn(HL)]$DMA. X-ray crys- tallographic analysis‡ reveals that IFMC-1 crystallizes in trigonal space group R3, and the asymmetric unit includes one Zn site, one HL2 ligand and one DMA molecule. Each Zn(II) ion is tetrahe- drally coordinated by four nitrogen atoms from three bridging HL2 ligands (Zn–N, 1.974(3)–2.016(3) A, N–Zn–N, 98.94– 124.04) to complete an inﬁnite 3D framework (Fig. 1a and S1a, ESI†). The four nitrogen atoms saturate the coordination sphere of each zinc atom and lock it into its position through the formation of a rigid seven-membered ring. Evidently, 7/11 N atoms of each ligand molecules do not take part in coordination to Zn(II) centers, that is, there are abundant uncoordinated nitrogen atoms from the N-rich aromatic ligand. Overall, 63.6% of the N- donor sites were left unbonded with metals. The dihedral angles between the triazolate ring and tetrazolate ring are ca. 29.85 and 27.49, respectively, and the dihedral angle of the two tetrazolate rings is 43.69 (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The overall network of IFMC-1 resembles a classical zeolitic SOD topology (Fig. 2a and b), which is featured by truncated octahedral supercages with eight hexag- onal faces and six square faces shared with neighboring cages (Fig. 1b and c).6b Each SOD cage is ﬁlled with six structurally ordered DMA solvent molecules (Fig. S2, ESI†). PLATON calculations14 suggest that the solvent-accessible volume in IFMC-1 is about 3990.3 A3 per unit cell (55.1% of the cell volume), which is larger than the reported value of ZIF-8 (47.0%).6b As a result of the expansion of space between vertices (the Zn/Zn distances spanned by HL2 are 6.05 and 6.10 A, while the Si/Si length spanned by a single oxygen atom is ca. 3.0 A in oxide zeolites), the cavity of the cage in IFMC-1 is much larger than those in the oxide counterparts. A sphere of 12 A in diameter can ﬁt into the cavity without touching the internal van der Waals surface of the cage (Fig. S3, ESI†). An important structural feature of IFMC-1 and ZIF-8 is that they possess a similar pore size (11.6 A in diameter for ZIF-8), but both connect through small apertures (6.4 and 3.4 A for IFMC-1 and ZIF-8, respec- tively) owing to the existence of a side chain or ring on the linkers (Fig. 2c, d and S4, ESI†).6a The purity of the as-synthesized IFMC-1 was conﬁrmed by similarities between simulated and experimental X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns (Fig. S5, ESI†) and thermo-gravi- metric analysis (TGA, Fig. S6a, ESI†). TGA measurement of IFMC-1 under a nitrogen stream shows a continuous weight loss of DMA and organic ligand. The residue corresponds to Zn3N2 (22.05, calc. 21.02%). The activated samples were prepared by exchanging the solvent in the as-synthesized IFMC-1 with CH3OH and then CH2Cl2, followed by evacuation under vacuum. The dichloro- methane-exchanged samples were characterized by TGA measurement to assure full activation (Fig. S6b, ESI†). Samples of IFMC-1a were evacuated under vacuum at room temperature overnight to completely remove the solvent CH2Cl2 molecules and thus to form guest-free phase IFMC-1a. The XRPD pattern (Fig. S5, ESI†) of IFMC-1a shows that the broadened peaks keep the positions, indicating the maintenance of the framework. The retention of thermal stability derived from its zeolitic structure makes it an attractive candidate for gas adsorption applications.

The N2 sorption isotherm at 77 K (Fig. 3a) shows a characteristic type I behavior for microporous materials with a slight hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption, which can be explained by the dynamic feature and cage effect of the framework.15 The adsorption amount of N2 at saturation is about 237.9 cm3 g1, which corresponds to 34.0 N2 per cage. The BET and Langmuir surface areas were 780 and 932 m2 g1, respectively, based on the nitrogen adsorption isotherm, and a micropore volume of 0.37 cm3 g1 was also calculated. Evidently, these surface areas are below the values reported for ZIF-8 (1630 and 1810 m2 g1, respectively).6a Surprisingly, the adsorption isotherm of IFMC-1a at 77 K reveals that the adsorption amount of H2 at saturation is ca. 145.1 cm3 g1 (1.3 wt %) (Fig. 3b), which is as high as the reported value of ZIF- 8,6a and corresponds to 20.7 H2 per cage. This result indicates that the interaction between uncoordinated nitrogen atoms from the N-rich aromatic ligand and H2 molecules may play an important role in increasing the H2 uptake. The establishment of the permanent porosity of IFMC-1a encouraged us to determine its potential application on selective gas separation. As shown in Fig. 4, the CO2 sorption isotherms for IFMC-1a were measured at different temperatures. It exhibits high CO2 uptake capacity at saturation of 166.9 cm3 g1 (7.5 mmol g1, 184.9 L/L) at 195 K, corresponding to 23.8 CO2 per cage. At 273 K and 298 K, IFMC-1a has CO2 uptake at satu- ration of 91.4 cm3 g1 (4.1 mmol g1, 101.3 L/L) and 60.3 cm3 g1 (2.7 mmol g1, 66.8 L/L), which correspond to 13.0 and 8.6 CO2 molecules per cage, respectively. It is noteworthy that even though numerous MOF structures have been reported, few exhibit a CO2 uptake of more than 60 L/L at 298 K.16 The CO2 adsorbance of ZIF-69 (82.6 L/L, 273 K and 1 atm),16a MAF-7 (62.5 cm3 g1, 273 K and 1 atm)16e and ZIF-70 (55.0 cm3 g1, 298 K and 1 atm)16f are higher among the reported ZMOFs mate- rials, which is lower than IFMC-1. To our knowledge, IFMC-1 shows the highest CO2 uptake among classical ZMOFs at 273 K or 298 K (1 atm) (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). Compared with CO2, N2 was hardly adsorbed at 273 K and 298 K. From these data, the calculated CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity is 50.3 : 1 at 273 K and 26.9 : 1 at 298 K. We speculate that IFMC-1 may have potential application in the separation of the CO2/N2 mixture. The results suggest that the favorable interaction between adsorbed CO2 molecules and uncoordinated N atoms from N- rich aromatic rings not only increases CO2 adsorbance, but also is beneﬁcial to gas separation. In order to explain the high CO2 uptake and CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity of IFMC-1, N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms were simulated with grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC)†.5b,17,18 The simulated N2 adsorption isotherm for IFMC-1 at 77 K (Fig. S7a, ESI†) matches reasonably well with the experimental one, suggesting that the samples were well- activated. In addition, simulated CO2 adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K were in agreement with the experimental data with slightly higher values (Fig. S7b, ESI†). CO2 binding sites were also obtained from the simulation (Fig. 5). It is observed that the CO2 molecule locates inside the large cage and forms short contacts with the uncoordinated tetrazolate 2-nitrogen (C/N ¼ 3.07 A). The C/N distance, being slightly smaller than the sum of van der Waals radii of carbon (1.70 A) and nitrogen (1.55 A), Fig. 3 The nitrogen sorption isotherm (a) and hydrogen sorption isotherm (b) at 77 K for IFMC-1a.

In addition, the distinct difference of adsorption capacities between CO2 and N2 prompts us to survey the enthalpy of CO2 adsorption and assess the adsorption selectivity for CO2 over N2. Isosteric adsorption enthalpies as a function of the quantity of CO2 adsorbed were calculated employing a variant of the Clau- sius–Clapeyron equation (Fig. S8, ESI†).19 The CO2 adsorption enthalpy of IFMC-1 is 30.7 kJ mol1 at zero coverage, clearly suggesting that the interaction between the host and CO2 mole- cules is stronger than siliceous zeolite (27 kJ mol1), activated carbons (less than 26 kJ mol1),20 and some MAF materials (MAF-4, 25.1; MAF-7, 17.2; MAF-25, 26.3 and MAF-26, 23.3 kJ mol1; MAF ¼ metal azolate framework).16e,18 Importantly, MOFs as drug-delivery nanocarriers are highly desirable due to their large loading of drugs, biodegradability and versatile functionality.21 Owing to the accessible porosity and the window size (6.4 A) of IFMC-1, it is potentially useful in the encapsulation of small drug molecules.22 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, 3  6 A) is speciﬁcally chosen in the study for its small size, which is widely used as an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug for the treatment of colorectal, breast and head and neck cancers.23 5-FU loading experiment was carried out by impreg- nation of activated IFMC-1a in a methanol solution of 5-FU with stirring (ESI†). IFMC-1a showed remarkable 5-FU adsorption and the loading content was measured to be 30.48% by UV/Vis measurement (Fig. S9a, ESI†), which was in agree- ment with the TGA result (Fig. S6c, ESI†). The kinetic process of 5-FU delivery in simulated body ﬂuid at 37 C is shown in Fig. S9b (ESI†). Around 84.3% of the loaded 5-FU was released during the initial fast release (12 h), and 89.8% within 120 h (Fig. 6). Compared with other MOFs carriers,24 IFMC-1 shows a fast release rate of 5-FU. The XRPD patterns suggested that the framework of IFMC-1 was remained with an appreciable loss of crystallinity after drug release (Fig. S10, ESI†). Experimental section Preparation of IFMC-1: Zn(NO3)2$6H2O (0.15 g, 0.50 mmol) was added to a solution of H3L (0.10 g, 0.50 mmol) in DMA (5 mL) with stirring. The mixture was heated at 95 C for 3 d and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless block crystals were collected and dried in air (yield 85%, based on Zn(NO3)2$6H2O).

Conclusions In conclusion, a novel SOD-type ZMOF has been successfully prepared by employing an N-rich aromatic ligand without NH2 group. The CO2 uptake of IFMC-1 is the highest among the classical ZMOFs and also exhibits selective adsorption behavior for CO2 over N2 due to favorable interactions between abundant uncoordinated N atoms from N-rich aromatic rings and CO2 molecules. For the ﬁrst time, we investigated the inﬂuence of a large number of uncoordinated nitrogen atoms from aromatic rings for CO2 adsorption in ZMOFs. The high percentage of open N-donor sites leads to the high uptake capacity for CO2, even in the absence of any NH2 groups and open metal sites. Additionally, IFMC-1 exhibited efﬁcient delivery of 5-FU, sug- gesting its potential application in drug delivery. Work is in progress to expand this strategy to construct new MOFs, espe- cially ZMOFs, with other N-rich ligands and obtain a series of materials with high CO2 sorption and capture ability in the future.

Materials and Measurements The starting material H3L was synthesized according to modified procedure of the reported literature.1 All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources, and were used without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer; Zn was determined with a Plasma-SPEC(I) ICP atomic emission spectrometer. IR spectrum was performed in the range 4000–400 cm–1 using KBr pellets on an Alpha Centaurt FT/IR spectrophotometer. Powder X-ray diffraction measurement was recorded radiation ranging from 5 to 50º at room temperature on a Siemens D5005 diffractometer with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the samples was performed using a Perkin-Elmer TG-7 analyzer heated from room temperature to 900 ºC under nitrogen at the heating rate of 5 °C·min−1. S2. Gas Sorption Experiments The N2, H2 and CO2 sorption measurements were performed on automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (Belsorp mini II). Before gas adsorption measurements, the sample was immersed in methanol for 24 h, and the extract was decanted. Fresh methanol was subsequently added, and the crystals were allowed to stay for an additional 24 h to remove the nonvolatile solvates (DMA). The sample was collected by decanting and treated with dichloromethane similarly to remove methanol solvates. After the removal of dichloromethane by decanting, the sample was activated by drying under a dynamic vacuum at room temperature overnight. Before the measurement, the sample was dried again by using the ‘outgas’ function of the surface area analyzer for 12 h at 90 ºC. S3. The Isosteric Heats of Adsorption The isosteric heat of adsorption represents the average binding energy of an adsorbing gas molecule at a specific surface coverage, which is calculated by employing the Clausius-Clapeyron equation: Qst = RT2(∂lnP/∂T)q where P is pressure, T is temperature, q is the amount adsorbed, R is the gas constant, and Qst denotes the heat of adsorption. S4. The Selectivity for Gases Adsorption The selectivity (S) for adsorption of CO2 over N2 of IFMC-1 was calculated from the single-component isotherm data. For CO2 capture, this value typically reports the ratio Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Science This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 S3 of the adsorbed amount of CO2 at 0.15 bar to the adsorbed amount of N2 at 0.75 bar; the value is normalized for the pressures chosen, according to equation: S = (qCO2/qN2)/(pCO2/pN2) where q is the amount adsorbed and P is pressure. S5. The computational simulation studies of gases adsorption All the GCMC simulations were performed with the Monte Carlo simulation suite of the MUSIC2 code and included a 5×106 step equilibration period followed by a 5× 106 step production run. The framework and the gas molecules were considered to be rigid. Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions were implored to describe the van der Waals interaction with a cutoff distance of 10.0 Å 12 6 4 ij ij ij ij ij ij б б V r r ε         = −                 where i and j are atoms of gases and the IFMC-1; r is the distance between two atoms; and ε and σ are LJ well depth and diameter, respectively. Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules were used to calculate the ε and σ between different atomic species. For Nitrogen, three different types of Monte Carlo trials were used in the simulations: insertion of a new adsorbate molecule at a random position in the adsorbent, removal of a randomly chosen adsorbed molecule from the adsorbent, and translation of a randomly chosen adsorbate molecule within the adsorbent. For the models of CO2, an additional Monte Carlo trial was needed: rotation of a randomly chosen adsorbate molecule within the adsorbent. Additionally, the Ewald sum method was used to compute the Coulombic interactions for the CO2 adsorption and the partial charges for atoms of the IFMC-1 were derived from QEq method. The partial charges on the carbon and oxygen atoms of CO2 molecules were 0.70e and -0.35e, respectively. The LJ parameters used for IFMC-1 are taken from UFF3 and listed together with the parameters of gases in the following table. ε/kB(kcalmol-1) б(Å) q(e) ZIF C 52.84 3.43 H 22.14 2.57 N 34.72 3.26 Zn 62.40 2.46 CO2 C 27.00 2.80 0.70 O 79.00 3.05 -0.35 N2 N2 95.20 3.75 0.00 Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Science This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 S4 S6. Drug Loading and Release Dissolving 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) (25 mg) and desolvated IFMC-1 (25 mg) in methanol (5 mL) three days yielded heterogeneous light yellow solution. Then the mixture was centrifuged (12000 r/min for 20 min) and then the solid was washed with methanol. The 5-FU content was calculated through UV/Vis results (λ = 266 nm). 15 mg of drug-loaded IFMC-1 was dissolved into 1.5 mL of PBS buffer solution (pH = 7.4), and loaded into a dialysis bag, which was dialyzed against 3 mL of deionized water at 37°C. During each time interval, ca. 1 mL of the solution was pulled out to test, and then decanted back when the test was over. The content of 5-FU in the samples taken out was monitored by fluorometry, in which the detection wavelength was 453 nm (λex = 374 nm). Reference: 1 M. Dincă, A. Dailly, Y. Liu, C. M. Brown, D. A.
