Commun., 2014, 50, 2615 Crystallographic determination of solid-state structural transformations in a dynamic metal–organic framework† Gui-Lian Li,a Guang-Zhen Liu,*a Lu-Fang Ma,a Ling-Yun Xin,a Xiao-Ling Lia and Li-Ya Wang*ab Various solid-state transformations in a metal–organic framework were determined by X-ray crystallography. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with structurally dynamic proper- ties have attracted extreme interest due to their unique potential in switching, sensing, transport, storage, etc.1,2 Implementation of MOFs with single-crystal to single-crystal (SC–SC) structural transformation would enable clear expression of such dynamic features,3 because the single crystal X-ray crystallography paves the way for the accurate determination of the intermediates during the solid-state transforma- tions that are typically involved in a significant rearrangement of structure motifs in the crystals including rotation, bending, swinging, sliding, or even cleavage/formation of chemical bonds.4 Unfortu- nately, there are not many dynamic MOFs with the ability to undergo a SC–SC transformation, as such crystals usually do not survive large degrees of structure deformations.5 Generally, the solid-state trans- formation mechanisms were indirectly investigated through vibra- tional spectroscopy to monitor the topotactic nature, solid-state NMR to probe the conformational details of possible intermediates, and atomic force microscopy AFM techniques to explore the surface properties, etc.6 Herein, we presented a new 3D ‘‘soft’’ MOF, [Zn3(nbdc)2(bpe)2- (OH)2]H2OC2H5OH (1H2OC2H5OH) (H2nbdc = 4-nitrobenzene-1,2- bicarboxylic acid and bpe = 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene), prepared by hydrothermal reaction of Zn(OAc)22H2O, H2nbdc, and bpe in EtOH– H2O. The phase purity of the bulk material was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Fig. S1, ESI†). Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) revealed that 1H2OC2H5OH consists of linear trinuclear [Zn3N4(m2-OH)2(COO)4], dictating the overall framework topology of (658) cds. The framework consists of two types of cage structures identified as A and B, of which two smaller cages A at the channel corners accommodated by one H2O molecule possess a triangular prism-like shape enclosed by four bpe and two nbdc linkers, and the larger cage B at the channel centre filled with one EtOH molecule possesses a sphere-like shape surrounded by four nbdc linkers. Each unit cell contains four cages (2A and 2B) with each cage A accom- modated by one H2O molecule and each cage B filled with one EtOH molecule (Fig. S2–S6, ESI†). The hierarchical pore structures provide a desired platform allowing for detailed exploration of the SC–SC struc- tural transformations including reversible desolvation–resolvation, I2 uptake–release, and photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S7, ESI†) and variable-temperature powder X-ray diﬀraction (VTPXRD) (Fig. S8, ESI†) showed that the air-stable crystals of 1H2OC2H5OH can maintain good crystallinity and framework integrity at least before 240 1C. It is noted that 1H2OC2H5OH can suﬀer from various SC–SC desolvated–resolvated structural transforma- tions (Fig. 1). Wherein the solvent-free phase 1 is hard to be captured because a rapid and dynamic rehydration process (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†) is completed within several minutes in air to give a hydrated phase 1H2O2.5H2O (Table S1, ESI†) with one H2O molecule located in cage A and 2.5H2O molecules accommodated in cage B. Fortunately, we succeeded in capturing an intermediate during the hydration of 1 to give a partly hydrated phase 1H2O (Table S1, ESI†) with one H2O molecule accommodated in cage A leaving cage B still empty. This clearly shows that the water molecules firstly fill the smaller cage A, then occupy the larger cage B, that is, 1H2O is the intermediate from 1 to 1H2O2.5H2O. It is reasonable to propose that water molecules can diﬀuse into cage A from cage B through the side window between them, considering that cage A has no pore opening in the crystal surface to allow for the direct access of guest molecules. The filling of the smaller then the larger adsorption sites is consistent with the theory of micropore filling,7 indicat- ing a two-step pore-filling sequence.8 Such fast water adsorp- tion behavior in air in a SC–SC manner is a rarely observed phenomenon in coordination polymers.9 a College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Luoyang Normal University, Luoyang, Henan 471022, China.

Commun., 2014, 50, 2615--2617 This journal is ©The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 Furthermore, the exposure of crystal 1 to mixed EtOH–H2O vapours makes it restore to 1H2OC2H5OH in a SC–SC manner, implying a stronger EtOH affinity over H2O for cage B; this prompts us to examine iodine-uploaded capacity of the microporous frame- work. A remarkable change in color of crystals from colorless to violet occur after suspending 1H2OC2H5OH in iodine cyclohexane solution for a period of time. Thiosulfate determination of the iodine content in thiosulfate upon the release of I2 into ethanol solution gave 1.07I2 for three zinc atoms. The photographs (Fig. S11, ESI†) showed that the ‘‘static’’ iodine release without disturbing the crystals enables the color of solution to gradually change to violet with increasing time, and the ‘‘kinetic’’ iodine release with constant stirring explored by time-dependent UV/vis spectroscopy displays the absorption maximum lmax at 206, 226, 288 and 360 nm becoming stronger with increasing iodine content in the ethanol (Fig. S12, ESI†). The intensity of the absorption band at 206 nm is proportional to the concentration of the I2 molecule, and the absorption bands at 288 and 360 nm correspond to a polyiodide I3  anion that is generally stabilized by a H+ ion. It is shown that the delivery of iodine increases linearly with increasing time at least in the first 90 min, whereas complete iodine release needs more than two weeks to reach the equilibrium state, implying that the iodine delivery is governed by a strong host–guest interaction, in contrast to conventional iodine adsorbent materials lacking an accessible well-defined host–guest interaction.10 SCXRD (Table S1, ESI†) showed that the EtOH guest in cage B was exchanged by one I2 molecule disordered over two positions, leaving the H2O guest in cage A static (Fig. 2). TGA (Fig. S13, ESI†) showed that a value of x E 0.94 was obtained by taking into account one water molecule guest per molecular formula 1H2OxI2, which is consistent with thiosulfate determination and SCXRD analysis. The I2 aﬃnity of 1H2OC2H5OH may be attributed to the regular p-electron- rich wall of cage B made of four nbdc carboxylate ligands. The separation between the centre of the I–I bond and the centroid of the benzene ring of the nbdc ligand ranges from 4.125 to 4.253 Å, probably forming a CT-complex between I2 and benzene rings (CT = charge transfer),11 which achieves a better controlled uptake and release of I2. The calculated density of 1H2OI2 (1.907 g cm3) increased remarkably (ca. 19.8%) relative to that of 1H2OC2H5OH (1.591 g cm3). A few examples of iodine inclusion into organic/ inorganic porous frameworks12 and into MOFs10,13 have been known, however, the reports on iodine adsorption of MOFs in a SC–SC manner only recently emerged, to the best of our knowledge.14 Probably, the inclusion of I2 requires to break original host–guest H-bonding interactions and to reconstruct new host–guest interac- tions such as the CT-complex and halogen bonds, which creates strain to make the crystal present a certain degree of pulverization. Furthermore, the distance between the centres of the CQC bonds of parallel positioned bpe ligands is 3.738 Å (less than 4.2 Å), satisfying the topophotochemical criteria established by Schmidt.15 It is noted that there are two diﬀerent orientated bpe pairs bridging the trimeric Zn3 units to form two uniform ladder motifs propagating along the [110] and [110] direction, respectively. Such structural features provide an ideal model to study the details of the solid-state photodimerization of CQC bonds. Upon UV irradiation of 1H2OC2H5OH for a period of time, the crystals display a color change from colorless to yellow. The X-ray crystallography showed that 1H2OC2H5OH can also convert to 1H2O2.5H2O resulting from the evacuation of the EtOH guest upon UV irradiation above 6 h and the subsequent rehydration after removing the light. The 1H NMR spectra showed that the signals for olefinic protons (d = 7.54 ppm) gradually weaken, accompanied by the appearance of the signals of the cyclobutane protons (d = 4.67 ppm) with prolonged irradiation time, and the shifted signals of bipyridine protons gradually strengthen (d = 8.35 and 7.24 ppm), coupling with the gradually weakened signals for unreacted bpe ligands (d = 8.60 and 7.62 ppm) (Fig. S14, ESI†). The observed chemical shifts implied that parallel positioned bpe ligands are partly transformed into stereo-specific rctt-tpcb regioisomers (Fig. S15, ESI†)16 and that the prolonged irradiation can improve the percentage of the photo- dimerized product, finally reaching a maximum of 78% [2+2] cycloaddition after irradiation for 63 h. Due to the loss of the single crystalline nature, the solid-state structure of the final photochemical product could not be determined by SCXRD. Fortunately, a 50% photoreactive intermediate, [Zn3(nbdc)2- (rctt-tpcb)0.5(bpe)0.5(OH)2]H2O0.5H2O (2) (Table S1, ESI†), was success- fully captured by irradiating crystals of 1H2OC2H5OH for 13 h (Fig. 3).

Commun., 2014, 50, 2615--2617 | 2617 SCXRD showed that the framework almost remains unchanged (Fig. S16, ESI†) except for the local formation of new C–C bonds across the ethylene bonds between parallel bpe ligands along the [110] direction, whereas parallel bpe ligands along the [110] direction only display a degree of distortion. For unreacted bpe pairs, the CC distance of 1.508 Å within bpe ligands is larger than 1.319 Å of the initial CQC bond and comparable to that of the normal C–C bond, but the CC distance of 2.226 Å between parallel bpe ligands is much less than the separation of 3.738 Å across two initial CQC bonds. It is clear that 1H2OC2H5OH displays extremely anisotropic photoreactivity along the [110] and [110] directions. In the formation of the cyclobutane derivative, the cleavage and formation of chemical bonds are gradual rather than sharp, probably undergoing series of transition. To the best our knowledge, both the anisotropic photoreactivity and the gradual transformation mechanism are firstly observed in MOFs. To date, there have been only two reports on the photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of 3D MOFs,17 in addition to a pillared-layer, [Mn2(HCO2)3(bpe)2(H2O)2]ClO4H2Obpe,18 with a 60% photoreactivity between bridging bpe ligands and lattice bpe molecules, wherein the hydrogen-bonded bpe in the lattice probably provided the flexibility needed for photoreactivity. Usually, the bridging ligands are inter- locked at both terminals such that the movements are restricted upon metal coordination. In such 3D cases, although the ligands have been found in parallel arrangements, the solids may not be photoreactive19 despite satisfying Schmidt’s criteria. Most of the dimerization reac- tions usually occur in various organic compounds, metal complexes as well as low-dimensional coordination polymers (1D and 2D).16,20 The photoreactivity of 1H2OC2H5OH implies that its framework can suﬀer from a relatively high degree of structure deformation. In summary, ‘‘soft’’ MOFs can suﬀer from various solid-state structural transformations with the framework retaining high integrity. The crystalline solids with hierarchical pore structures are inclined to stepwise pore-filling during guest uptake, whereas the transport of I2 is facilitated by unique host–guest interactions such as the CT-complex. Solid-state photochemical [2+2] cycloaddi- tion is extremely anisotropic and related to gradual rather than sharp cleavage and formation of chemical bonds.

Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 S8 Various SC-SC desolvated-resolvated structural transformations When heating sample at 120°C, all solvent H2O and EtOH molecules in both cages can be completely evacuated along the Route a (Fig. 1), however, the solvent-free phase 1 is hard to be captured because a rapid rehydration process is completed within several minutes in air along the Route b. The dynamic H2O uptake of 1 in air was examined by well-designed cyclic TGA (Fig. S9, ESI†) and IR spectra (Fig. S10, ESI†). Firstly, bring the crystal 1·H2O·C2H5OH to 140oC operated on the TGA apparatus in high purity N2 stream, and then slowly reduce the heat to the room temperature. After that, the sample chamber of the TGA apparatus is opened with the crystals exposed to air for a period of time, followed by next cyclic TGA experiment to measure its water content, the time-dependent hydration of 1 is recorded as H2O content plotted against exposed time. It is noted that the crystals can reserve the crystallinity after eight TGA run. The time-dependent hydration of 1 showed that a fast H2O adsorption occurred before ~1 min (1.83 wt%, corresponding to 1.03H2O for three Zn atoms), followed by a relatively slow H2O uptake, finally reaching the saturation within 10 min (5.8 wt%, corresponding to 3.46H2O for three Zn atoms) to give a hydrated phase 1·H2O·2.5H2O (Table S1, ESI†) with one H2O molecule located in cage A and 2.5H2O molecules accommodated in cage B. Fortunately, we succeeded in capturing an intermediate during the hydration of 1 in first ~1min giving a partly hydrated phase [Zn3(nbdc)2(bpe)2(OH)2]·H2O (1·H2O) (Table S1, ESI†). The intermediate of the hydration evolution of 1 is obtained in a more tricky way that a single crystal of 1·H2O·2.5H2O is fixed in a glass capillary and heated at 120oC for 0.5h, followed by exposure to air humidity for ~1 min then continuous aeration of high purity N2 stream, finally sealed at both ends promptly. The SCXRD analysis shows that one H2O molecule occupies cage A leaving cage B still empty in 1·H2O. It clearly shows that the water molecules firstly fill the smaller cage A, then occupy the larger cage B during the hydration along the Route c and d, that is, 1·H2O is the intermediate from 1 to 1·H2O·2.5H2O. It is reasonable to propose that water molecule can diffuse into the cage A from the cage B through the side window between them, considering that the cage A has no pore opening in the crystal surface to allow for the direct access Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 S9 of guest molecule. The filling of the smaller then the larger adsorption sites is consistent with the theory of micropore filling, indicating a two-step pore-filling sequence. Alternatively, the intermediate 1·H2O could not be arrested by performing usual heating on 1·H2O·2.5H2O along the supposed the Route e because all water guests accommodated in both cages nearly lose instantly along the Route f, though it is realistic that 1·H2O can convert to 1 by performing heating along the Route g. Such fast water adsorption behavior in air in a SC-SC manner is a rarely observed phenomenon in coordination polymers. Furthermore, the exposure of crystal 1 to mixed EtOH/H2O vapours makes it restore to 1·H2O·C2H5OH in a SC-SC manner along the Route h. This process is realized by bringing the crystal 1·H2O·C2H5OH to 140oC in high purity N2 stream, and then slowly reduce the heat to the room temperature. After that, the crystals are exposed to the mixed EtOH/H2O vapors for 30min. Thiosulfate determination of the iodine content The iodine-loaded crystals (50 mg) were soaked in a 5 ml of iodine cyclohexane solution (0.1 M/L). After the uptake of iodine, the resulting violet crystals were separated from the iodine solution and thoroughly washed with cyclohexane, and then dried in air. Then these crystals were soaked in ethanol solution (50 mL), and thiosulfate determination of iodine content in the solution. Fig. S1. The experimental and simulated PXRD patterns for 1·H2O·C2H5OH. Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 S10 Crystal structure of 1·H2O·C2H5OH The SCXRD revealed that 1·H2O·C2H5OH consists of a linear trinuclear [Zn3N4(μ2-OH)2(COO)4] cluster that dictates the overall framework topology of (65.8) cds. Each linear trimeric unit [Zn3N4(μ2-OH)2(COO)4] (Fig. S2) consists of two crystallographically unique Zn(II) atoms with octahedral Zn(1) atom locating in the inversed centre symmetrically double-bridged to two terminal tetrahedral Zn(2) atoms through the combination of one µ2-OH bridge and one µ2-η1:η1-COO bridge, respectively. The adjacent trimeric units are further double-bridged by two µ2-nbdc ligands propagating along the c direction to form 1D Zn-carboxylate ribbons (Fig. S3), which are finally cross-linked by parallel positioned bpe pairs with four peripheral ribbons to afford its 3D framework containing 1D open channel with “Chinese-Spindle-like” pore opening (Fig. S4). Noticeably, the –NO2 groups of nbdc anions are penetrated into the inner of the channel making its appearing in three parts. Actually, there exist two types of cage-like structures, identified as A and B, respectively, of which two smaller cages A at the channel corners possess a triangular prism-like shape enclosed mainly by four bpe and two nbdc linkers, and the larger cage B at the channel centre possesses a sphere-like shape surrounded primarily by four nbdc linkers (Fig. S5). The cages B stack along the c direction forming 1D open channel with circular aperture, but the cage A has no visible pore opening in the crystal surface except for communicating with the adjacent cage B through the side window between them along the b direction. Each unit cell contains four cages (2A and 2B) with each cage A occupied by one H2O molecule and each cage B filled with one EtOH molecule disordered over two positions (Fig. S6).

Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 S14 TGA of 1·H2O·C2H5OH TGA (Fig. S7) of 1·H2O·C2H5OH showed that an initial mass loss of 5.9% from solvent water and ethanol incorporated in both cages is evident from the room temperature to 120oC (calcd. 6.0%), followed by a stable plateau after which the decomposition of the organic ligands occurs between 245 and 620oC with a series of thermal events. The observed mass remnant of 22.9% at 900oC represents the deposition of ZnO component, which is well agreement with the calculated value of 22.7%. The air-stable crystals of 1·H2O·C2H5OH can maintain good crystallinity and framework integrity at least before 240°C, which was verified by variable-temperature powder X-ray diffractions (VT-PXRD).

Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 S16 Time-dependent IR spectra IR spectra for 1·H2O·2.5H2O shows obvious adsorption bands of water in the region 3450−3650 cm−1, but their strength extremely weaken upon dehydration and the existence of residual water IR adsorption is attributed to stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups of the framework. Time-dependent IR spectra of 1 upon exposure to air humidity for different durations (Fig. S10) shows that adsorption bands of water are gradually restored to the initial intensity of 1·H2O·2.5H2O within several minutes. Other main adsorption bands remain unchanged, also demonstrating that the host backbone is preserved even if it undergone a guest evacuated-uploaded cycle. Fig. S10.
