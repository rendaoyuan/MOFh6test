Synthesis of [Co2(OABDC)(bpy)(OH)]n 3 (H2O)2.2n (5). Co(NO3)23 6H2O (0.0873 g, 0.3 mmol), 5-oxyacetate isophthalic acid (0.036 g, 0.15 mmol), 4,40-bipyridine (0.0283, 0.15 mmol) and NaOH (0.008, 0.2 mmol) were mixed in 7 mL of H2O/ethanol. Then, the mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (10 mL). The vessel was sealed and heated to 160 _x0001_C for 50 h. Then the reactant mixture was cooled at a rate of 10 _x0001_C h-1, leading to the formation of violet crystals of 3. Yield: (0.072 g, 85% based on Co).
