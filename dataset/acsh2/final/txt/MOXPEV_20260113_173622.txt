Extended PETPE (2)/CuBF4. A solution of extended PETPE (2; 20 mg, 0.027 mmol) in a mixture of CH3CN and CH2Cl2 (7 mL, 6:1 v/v) was placed in a test tube, and CH3CN (15 mL) was carefully layered on top. A solution of Cu(CH3CN)4BF4 (56 mg, 0.18 mmol) in CH3CN (2 mL) was then added on top of the other two layers. The tube was sealed, and the contents were allowed to mix slowly. After 2 weeks, yellow crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained.
