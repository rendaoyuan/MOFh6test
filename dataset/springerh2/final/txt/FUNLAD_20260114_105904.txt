Preparation of [Zn2(SDC)2(An2Py)]∙DMF∙4H2O (1): 9.3 mg (0.025 mmol) of Zn(ClO4)2, 4.8 mg (0.0125 mmol) of An2Py and 6.7 mg (0.025 mmol) of H2SDC were weighed in a 25 ml scintillating vial. 2 ml of DMF and 1ml of water was added to the solids with a drop of HNO3. The bright red solution that formed in the vial was capped and heated in the oven for 2 days at 120°C followed by slow cooling. Bright yellow plate-like crystals were obtained and washed with DMF. Yield: 50%. Preparation of [Zn2(SDC)2(An2Py)](1a): (1) was ground and heated at 100˚C for 2 h under vacuum. The bright yellow powder was used for further characterization. Yield: 99%. Preparation of [Zn2(SDC)2(An2Py)]∙perylene (2): 9.3 mg (0.025 mmol) of Zn(ClO4)2, 4.8mg (0.0125 mmol) of An2Py, 6.7 mg (0.025mmol) of H2SDC and 3.15 mg (0.0125 mmol) of perylene were weighed in a 25 ml scintillating vial. 2ml of dimethyl formamide and 1ml of water was added to the solids with a drop of HNO3. The bright red solution that formed in the vial was capped and heated in the oven for 2 days at 120°C followed by slow cooling. Bright orange plate-like crystals were obtained and washed with DMF. Yield: 53%. Preparation of [Zn2(SDC)2(An2Py)]∙anthracene (3): 9.3 mg (0.025 mmol) of Zn(ClO4)2, 4.8 mg (0.0125 mmol) of An2Py, 6.7 mg (0.025 mmol) of H2SDC and 2.2 mg (0.0125 mmol) of anthracene were weighed in a 25 ml scintillating vial. 2 ml of DMF and 1 ml of water was added to the solids with a drop of HNO3. The bright red solution that formed in the vial was capped and heated in the oven for 2 days at 120°C followed by slow cooling. Bright yellow plate-like crystals were obtained and washed with DMF. Yield: 54%.
