Synthesis of [Cu3(1,3-BDC)4(Dpq)2] (1): Compound 1 was prepared by simple hydrothermal reaction of CuCl2 ·2H2O (0.034g, 0.2mmol), 1,3-H2BDC (0.0332g, 0.2mmol), Dpq (0.023g, 0.1mmol), H2O (12mL) and NaOH (0.016, 0.4mmol), the mixture was stirred for 30min in air, then transferred and sealed in a 25mL Teflon reactor, which was heated at 160°C for 6 days leads to the formation of blue block crystals 1 (29% yield based on Cu).
