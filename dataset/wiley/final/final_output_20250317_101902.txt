Synthesis of 1 Ce(NO3)3.6H2O (20 mg) and H4TCPB (10 mg) were added to EtOH (3 mL) and H2O (3 mL) in 12 mL borosillicate glass vial and the vials sealed. The mixture was sonicated for 10 minutes to form a white suspension, which is then heated at 2°C/min to 120°C for 48 hours and cooled at 0.2°C/min to room temperature (25°C). Large colourless single crystals are separated from the mother liquor by vacuum filtration and washed with EtOH and H2O to yield pure compound with the formula Ce(HTCPB).0.28EtOH.2.75H2O. These single crystals were used for the single crystal diffraction experiments. 1 can also be produced at 3× the scale (3× reagent in 3× solvent in 40 mL glass vial) which produces smaller particles of 1, with a more polydisperse particle size than from method A. Samples produced by both methods were used in the liquid phase sorption experiments and produced identical results. 1 is stable on standing in water. 3 is synthesised by desolvation of 1 at 100°C and 10–3 mbar for 6 hours.

Synthesis of Complexes [C28H30MnN8O10]n (1) and (C13H8N4O3)2Mn2(CH3OH)(H2O)3 (2): Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.10 g, 0.41 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (10 mL) in a round-bottomed flask. H2L5 (0.10 g, 0.34 mmol) was added to methanol (10 mL), and the solution was warmed. The two mixtures were combined to give a cloudy orange solution. H2O was added dropwise, but the precipitate still did not dissolve. The reaction mixture was then stirred and heated gently for 24 h. A cloudy orange solution resulted, which was gravity-filtered to give a clear light yellow filtrate, and an orange precipitate. Attempts to redissolve the precipitate were unsuccessful. The yellow filtrate was left to slowly concentrate at room temperature. Colourless crystals of 1 suitable for X-ray diffraction formed after 2 weeks (yield 45 mg, 16% based on metal salt). On further standing, a small quantity of orange crystals (ca. 15 mg) of 2 was obtained from the mother liquor, which were also suitable for X-ray diffraction.

Preparation of Gd-pDBI nanocrystals As-synthesized Gd-pDBI (50 mg) was ball-milled using a Retsch (MM400) operated at 30 Hz for 30 min to obtain a light yellow powder of mechanically ground Gd-pDBI (MG-Gd-pDBI). Loading of anticancer drug Doxorubicin (DOX) Each Gd-pDBI (Gd-pDBI or MG-Gd-pDBI) was dispersed in Milli-Q water (5 mL) by simple sonication in an ultrasound bath followed by addition of standard DOX solution (2 mg dissolved in 1 mL Milli-Q water). This mixture was further sonicated for 5 min and then kept under vigorous stirring overnight in the dark. Finally, DOX loaded Gd-pDBI was isolated by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 15 min and washed (×2) with copious amount of Milli-Q water to eliminate surface adsorption. Interestingly, the as-synthesized Gd-pDBI exhibited negligible loading, suggesting that the entire payload is inside the pore.

Preparation of Zn(H2O)(PO3C6H4COOH) (5) Hydrothermal Synthesis: In a 50-mL PTFE insert was dissolved 3-phosphonobenzoic acid (0.1 g, 0.49 mmol, 1 equiv.) in distilled water (15 mL). To this solution was added Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.162 g, 1.48 mmol, 1.5 equiv.). The insert was transferred into a Berghof pressure digestion vessel and heated from room temperature to 160 °C over 18 h and then further heated at 160 °C for 40 h and cooled to room temperature over 18 h. After filtration, the resulting compound obtained as a white powder was washed with water, rinsed with absolute ethanol and dried in air (0.095 g, 68% yield).

Synthesis of 3 ∞[La2Cl6(bipy)5]·4bipy LaCl3 (0.25 mmol, 62 mg) and 4,4'-bipyridine (bipy, 1.25 mmol, 195 mg) were sealed in an evacuated DURANTM glass ampoule and heated to 90 °C in 7 h and then to 120 °C within 30 h. The temperature was held for 48 h and afterwards cooled to 95 °C in 250 h and finally to room temperature in further 14 h. The reaction resulted in high reflecting colorless crystals of the product and an amount of unreacted LaCl3 in the bulk. Yield: 199 mg = 84 %.

A methanolic solution (20 mL) of CuACHTUNGTRENUNG(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.30 g, 0.81 mmol) was added slowly to a magnetically stirred methanolic solution (15 mL) of H3L (0.09 g, 0.36 mmol). The mixture was stirred in air for 45 min while NEt3 (0.10 mL, 0.72 mmol) was added, whereby a deep-green solution was formed. An aqueous solution (10 mL) of NaN3 (0.023 g, 0.36 mmol) was added, and the mixture was heated at reflux for 1 h. The solution was then cooled to ambient temperature, filtered, and kept under air. Single crystals of 1 (0.63 g, 75%) for X-ray crystallography were obtained upon slow evaporation of the filtrate at ambient temperature for a few days.

Synthesis of 1a: An aqueous mixture (10 mL) of Er2O3, Cu(NO3)2, ip and bpy in the ratio of 1:2:1:2 was placed in a Teflon reactor (23 mL), and heated at 170 °C for 5 d, and then it was cooled to room temperature at 5 °C h−1. Green crystals were obtained in 70% yield based on Cu. In addition, Er(NO3)3 was used instead of Er2O3 to produce 1a, without obviously change in the yield; on the other hand, CuCl2 or CuSO4 was also selected to replace Cu(NO3)2 to produce polymer 1a, without obviously change in the yield.

Synthesis of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] Gallium (70 mg = 1 mmol) and imidazole (ImH, C3H3NNH; 204 mg = 3 mmol) were sealed in an evacuated DURAN glass ampoule. The reaction mixture was heated in 24 h to 120 °C and held at this temperature for 1850 h. The melt was cooled to room temperature in 1 h. The reaction gave a colourless crystalline product of trapezoidal crystals of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH]. Yield (ImH): 181 mg (69 %). Shorter reaction times decrease the yield of the reaction. Higher reaction temperatures result in a different poorly crystalline product.
