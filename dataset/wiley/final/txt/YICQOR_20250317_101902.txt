[Pb2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ndc)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(tcpp)] (5): PbACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2 (0.5 mmol), H2ndc (0.5 mmol), and tcpp (0.5 mmol) were dissolved in distilled water (10 mL), and triethylamine was added until the pH value of the system was adjusted to about 5.5. The resulting solution was stirred for about 0.5 h at room temperature, sealed in a 23-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 1858C for 10 days under autogenous pressure. Then the reaction system was slowly cooled to room temperature. Pale yellow block crystals of 5 suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis were collected from the final reaction system by filtration, washed several times with distilled water, and dried in air at ambient temperature. Yield: 54% based on PbII.
