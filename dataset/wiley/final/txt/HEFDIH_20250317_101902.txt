Synonyms: N/A
Compound 1 was prepared by slow diffusion of solutions of K4[MoIII(CN)7] and [MnII(dpop)]Cl2 in the dark under a nitrogen atmosphere; the related phase, 2, was prepared by subjecting crystals of 1 to a dynamic vacuum at 1258C for 8 h and further pumping using the “outgas” function of a gas adsorption analyzer for 5 h at 1508C.
