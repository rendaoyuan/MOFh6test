Synthesis of [CuL(L3)]·3H2O (3): A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (0.171 g, 1 mmol), NaOH (0.080 g, 2 mmol), and succinic acid (H2L3; 0.116 g, 1 mmol) in water was stirred for 10 min at 60 °C, then 1,1-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole) (L; 0.190 g, 1 mmol) was added to the mixture. After stirring for 30 min, the blue precipitate was collected and dissolved in a minimum amount of ammonia (14 m). Blue single crystals of 1 were obtained by slow evaporation of the ammoniacal solution at ambient temperature. Yield: 78% (331 mg).
Abbreviation: H2L3
Full Name: succinic acid
