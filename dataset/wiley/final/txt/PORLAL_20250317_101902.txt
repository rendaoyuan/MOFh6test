Synthesis of Gd-pDBI pDBI (0.020 g, 0.05 mmol) dissolved in DMF (1.5 mL) was added to an aqueous solution (2.5 mL) of Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (0.023 g, 0.05 mmol) and was sonicated for 10 min. The turbid solution was kept in a tightly capped 5 mL vial for 72 h at 110°C to afford rod-shaped golden crystals (0.035 g, 70% yield). Preparation of Gd-pDBI nanocrystals As-synthesized Gd-pDBI (50 mg) was ball-milled using a Retsch (MM400) operated at 30 Hz for 30 min to obtain a light yellow powder of mechanically ground Gd-pDBI (MG-Gd-pDBI). Loading of anticancer drug Doxorubicin (DOX) Each Gd-pDBI (Gd-pDBI or MG-Gd-pDBI) was dispersed in Milli-Q water (5 mL) by simple sonication in an ultrasound bath followed by addition of standard DOX solution (2 mg dissolved in 1 mL Milli-Q water). This mixture was further sonicated for 5 min and then kept under vigorous stirring overnight in the dark. Finally, DOX loaded Gd-pDBI was isolated by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 15 min and washed (×2) with copious amount of Milli-Q water to eliminate surface adsorption. Interestingly, the as-synthesized Gd-pDBI exhibited negligible loading, suggesting that the entire payload is inside the pore.
