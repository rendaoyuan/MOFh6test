A solution of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (140 mg, 0.667 mmol) and isoquinoline (0.350 mL, 3.00 mmol) in methanol (20 mL) was heated gently for about 10 min and then carefully layered onto a solution of Zn(NO3)2Â·6H2O (297 mg, 1.00 mmol) in methanol/benzene (3:1, 20 mL). Colorless single crystals formed within 12 h under ambient conditions (217 mg, 59.6% yield).
