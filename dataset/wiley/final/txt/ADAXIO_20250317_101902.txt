A mixture of Co- (NO3)2·6H2O (0.0373 g, 0.128 mmol), H2BDC (0.0244 g, 0.13 mmol), BPNO (0.0226 g, 0.12 mmol), and DMF/MeOH mixture (9 mL) was sealed in a 15-mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 3 d. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, red, stick-shaped crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were generated directly, washed with methanol, and dried in air. Yield: 58% based on the CoII salt.
