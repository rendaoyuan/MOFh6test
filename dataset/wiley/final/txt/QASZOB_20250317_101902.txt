Compound (1)Br2: AgBr (142 mg, 0.755 mmol) was added to a solution of 1 (80 mg, 0.151 mmol) in MeOH (10 mL). The solution was stirred at room temp. for a period of 2 h, during which time the solution quickly turned deep green. Then the solution was filtered and the solvent was partially removed to around 2 mL. A dark, crystalline solid precipitated after the addition of Et2O (restoring the initial 10 mL volume); yield 71 mg (0.103 mmol, 68%).
