Preparation of {[Cu2(bdcppi)(dmf)2]·10DMF·2H2O}n (SNU-50): Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.024 g, 0.103 mmol), H4BDCPPI (0.030 g, 0.051 mmol), and DMF (5 mL) were placed in a glass bottle, and acidified with HNO3 (13 N, 3 drops). The bottle was sealed and heated at 110°C for 12 h. Blue–green prismatic crystals (0.045 g, 60%) formed, which were filtered and washed with DMF.
