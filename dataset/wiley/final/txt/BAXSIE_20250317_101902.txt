For [Mg(HL)(H2O)4] (1): All of the compounds were synthesized by the hydrothermal route. The compounds were obtained as colorless block-shaped crystals after heating in a Teflon-lined Parr acid digestion bomb at 1708C for 3 days followed by slow cooling at a rate of 58Ch_x0002_1 to room temperature. The initial reaction mixture was prepared by mixing magnesium nitrate and pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid in a 2:1 ratio in water. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted by changing the molar proportion of the weak base sodium azide. The pH of the medium was thereby adjusted to 4 to obtain monomer. For [Mg(HL)(H2O)3]2 (2): All of the compounds were synthesized by the hydrothermal route. The compounds were obtained as colorless block-shaped crystals after heating in a Teflon-lined Parr acid digestion bomb at 1708C for 3 days followed by slow cooling at a rate of 58Ch_x0002_1 to room temperature. The initial reaction mixture was prepared by mixing magnesium nitrate and pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid in a 2:1 ratio in water. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted by changing the molar proportion of the weak base sodium azide. The pH of the medium was thereby adjusted to 5 to obtain dimer. For [Mg(HL)(H2O)2]n (3): All of the compounds were synthesized by the hydrothermal route. The compounds were obtained as colorless block-shaped crystals after heating in a Teflon-lined Parr acid digestion bomb at 1708C for 3 days followed by slow cooling at a rate of 58Ch_x0002_1 to room temperature. The initial reaction mixture was prepared by mixing magnesium nitrate and pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid in a 2:1 ratio in water. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted by changing the molar proportion of the weak base sodium azide. The pH of the medium was thereby adjusted to 6 to obtain 1D framework compounds. For {[Mg3(L)2(H2O)2] (H3L)·2(H2O)}n (4): All of the compounds were synthesized by the hydrothermal route. The compounds were obtained as colorless block-shaped crystals after heating in a Teflon-lined Parr acid digestion bomb at 1708C for 3 days followed by slow cooling at a rate of 58Ch_x0002_1 to room temperature. The initial reaction mixture was prepared by mixing magnesium nitrate and pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid in a 2:1 ratio in water. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted by changing the molar proportion of the weak base sodium azide. The pH of the medium was thereby adjusted to 7 to obtain 2D framework compounds. For {[Mg3(L)(OH)3(H2O)2]·H2O}n (5): All of the compounds were synthesized by the hydrothermal route. The compounds were obtained as colorless block-shaped crystals after heating in a Teflon-lined Parr acid digestion bomb at 1708C for 3 days followed by slow cooling at a rate of 58Ch_x0002_1 to room temperature. The initial reaction mixture was prepared by mixing magnesium nitrate and pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid in a 2:1 ratio in water. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted by changing the molar proportion of the weak base sodium azide. The pH of the medium was thereby adjusted to 8 to obtain 3D framework compounds.
