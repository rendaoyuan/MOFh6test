[Cu4L2(N3)8]n (3): A buffer layer of methanol/water (7 mL, 1:1) was carefully layered over an aqueous solution (3 mL) of CuSO4·5H2O (0.1 mmol) and NaN3 (0.2 mmol). Afterwards, a solution of L (0.1 mmol) in methanol (3 mL) was layered on the buffer layer. Black block crystals were collected after three weeks. Yield based on the ligand L: 20%.
