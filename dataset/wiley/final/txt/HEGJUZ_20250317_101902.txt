Synonyms: N/A
[Zn3(bpdc)3bpy]·4DMF·H2O (1) was prepared by mixing 0.08 g of [Zn(bpdc)(H2O)2]·H2O (white powder) and 0.125 g of bpy in 5 mL of DMF. The mixture was transferred to an acid-digestion bomb, sealed, and heated at 150 °C for 3 days. After washing with 3 × 10 mL of DMF and drying in air, colorless columnar crystals of 1 were isolated in high yield (94 %). 10 mg of the ground product of 1 was added to a solution of water and ethanol (in 1:10 ratio) and refluxed for 30 min to yield 1D [Zn(bpdc)(H2O)2]·H2O in high yield (> 90 %). Crystal samples of 1 used in sorption experiments were grown by reactions of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.059 g) with bpdc (0.048 g) and bpy (0.031 g) in 10 mL of DMF in the molar ratio 1:1:1:0.65 at 150 °C for 48 h. Reactants were mixed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated in an oven at a constant temperature. After the reaction, the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature. The solution was filtered, the product was washed with DMF (3 × 10 mL), and the crystals were dried at 80 °C for 3 h.
