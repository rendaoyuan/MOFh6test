Syntheses of [Cd2(bpdc)2(DPNDI)2]·3H2O·NMF (1): A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (15.42 mg, 0.05 mmol), H2bpdc (12.1 mg, 0.05 mmol), DPNDI (20.6 mg, 0.05 mmol), and NMF(3 mL) was added to a 10mL vial. The vial was sealed, held at 90 °C for 48 h, and finally cooled to room temperature. Yellow crystals of 1 were obtained in 60% yield based on Cd (49.89 mg).
