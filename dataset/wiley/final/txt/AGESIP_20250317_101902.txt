0.375 mmol of Cu(NO3)2·5H2O, 0.375 mmol of m-phenylenediamine, 0.750 mmol of squaric acid and 339 mmol of distilled water in the molar ratio Cu(NO3)2·5H2O : amine : squaric acid : H2O 1 : 1 : 2 : 1037 were taken together. The reactants were sealed into a 10 mL Teflon lined bomb and heated to 180 °C and kept for 96 h and then cooled slowly to room temperature. The brown color crystals were washed with water, acetone and allowed to dry in air.
