1[Ho2(Mbim)4(Bbim)] 1: 2-Mercaptobenzimidazole (MBimH, C7H6N2S; 1 mmol, 150 mg, ACROS 98%), the lanthanide metals (ChemPur 99.9%, 0.33 mmol, Ho: 54 mg), and Hg (0.05 mmol, 10 mg) were sealed in a Duran glass ampoule under vacuum and heated to 305 °C in 29 h. After annealing for 336 h it was cooled to 290 °C in 150 h, in another 200 h to 250 °C and in 44 h to room temperature. Colourless/yellow platelet crystals of 1 result. In cooler parts of the ampoules deep red crystals of 4 are observed.
