Preparation of {[Ni(Hmip)2(bpfp)(H2O)2]·2H2mip}n (5): Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (108 mg, 0.38 mmol), bpfp (111 mg, 0.38 mmol), and 5-methylisophthalic acid (68 mg, 0.38 mmol) were mixed with 10 mL of distilled H2O in a 23 mL Teflon-lined acid digestion bomb. Aqueous NaOH solution (1.0 mL, 1.0 m) was added to encourage deprotonation of the acid. The bomb was sealed and heated in an oven at 120 °C for 48 h, and cooled slowly to 25 °C. Green crystals of 5 (23 mg, 22% yield based on Ni) were isolated after washing with distilled water, ethanol, and acetone and drying in air.
