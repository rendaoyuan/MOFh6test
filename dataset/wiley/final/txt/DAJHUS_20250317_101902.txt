Synthesis of [Co2(ndc)2(bipyen)]·C6H6·H2O (2): A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.10 g), H2ndc (0.074 g), bipyen (0.063 g), benzene (1.53 mL; precaution: benzene is a cancer suspect agent and flammable liquid), and H2O (6 mL) in the mole ratio of 1:1:1:50:970 was heated in an autoclave at 1808C for 2 days and then cooled to room temperature. Black crystals were obtained along with orange powdery materials of unknown nature. The crystals lose crystallinity in air due to the loss of benzene and so were kept in the mother liquor.
