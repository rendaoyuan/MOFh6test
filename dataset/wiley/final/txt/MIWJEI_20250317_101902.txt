Preparation of [{Er(NC5H4COOH)(H2O)2}2- (H5O2)(HgCl5)(HgCl4)2(H2O)2]n The title complex was prepared by mixing ErCl3·6H2O (1 mmol, 382 mg), HgCl2 (1 mmol, 272 mg), isonicotinic acid (1 mmol, 123 mg) and 10 mL distilled water in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 3 days. After being slowly cooled to room temperature at 6 °C/h, pink crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained. The yield was 73 % (based on erbium).
