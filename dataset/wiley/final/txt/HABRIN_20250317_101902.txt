Synonyms: catena-[bis(μ4-tetrakis(Imidazol-1-yl)borate-N3,N3',N3'',N3''')-bis(μ2-terephthalato-O,O')-aqua-tri-zinc(ii) dihydrate]
Synthesis of MC-BIF-2H: NaB(im)4 (0.036 g), Zn(AC)2·2H2O (0.043 g), 1,4-Benzenebicarboxlic (1,4-BDC, 0.032 g), imidazole (im, 0.024 g) and water (2.12 g) were placed in a 20 ml vial. The sample was heated at 120 oC for 5 days, and then cooled to room-temperature. After washed by ethanol, the colorless crystals were obtained (MC-BIF-2H (yield: 0.101 g, 64.5% based on B)).
