CdIF-8 (sod): A mixture of Cd(NO3)2⋅4H2O (0.192g, 0.625 mmol), Hnim (0.1425 g, 1.25 mmol) and DMF (15 mL) was placed into a 15 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Then, the autoclave was sealed and heated at 120 ℃ for 12 hours. After being cooled to ambient room temperature, the autoclave was opened and colorless crystals of CdIF-8 were separated by filtration. X-ray single crystal analysis reveals a zeolitic sodalite-like structure and XRD spectrum for the bulk sample is agreeable to that simulated from the X-ray single crystal data. However, as CdIF-8 was washed with methanol (10 mL ×3) and evacuated in vacuum, its zeolitic sodalite structure was destroyed.
