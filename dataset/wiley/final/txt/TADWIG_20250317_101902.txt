Synthesis of [Zn2L(DMF)(H2O)]·4.3DMF·2EtOH·H2O (1): A mixture of ZnI2 (31.9 mg, 0.10 mmol), H4L (41.1 mg, 0.05 mmol), DMF (2 mL), and EtOH (2 mL) was heated in a capped vial at 908C for 3 days. Colorless crystals of 1 were filtered, and briefly dried on filter paper at room temperature. Yield: 46 mg (63%). [Zn2L’(DMF)-(H2O)]·4.3DMF·2EtOH·4H2O (2) was similarly synthesized in 51% yield.
