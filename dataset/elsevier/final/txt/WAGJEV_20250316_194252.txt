{[Zn2(bta)(H2biim)2(H2O)].H2O} n (3) A mixture of H4bta (0.066g, 0.2mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.118g, 0.4mmol), NaOH (0.032g, 0.8mmol), H2biim (0.107g, 0.8mmol) and H2O (10mL) was heated in a 25-mL Teflon-lined vessel at 180°C for 3 days, followed by slow cooling (5°Ch−1) to room temperature. After filtration and washing with H2O, colorless block crystals were collected and dried in air (0.319g, yield ca. 46% based on H4bta).
