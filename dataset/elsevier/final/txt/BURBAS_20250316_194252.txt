Synthesis of [Zn(dte)(phen)] (3) A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (20mg, 0.07mmol), phen (10mg, 0.06mmol) and H2dte (5mg, 0.03mmol) was suspended in the solution of H2O (15ml), and heated in a teflon-lined steel bomb at 140°C for 3days. The yellow block crystals (7mg) formed were collected, washed with water and dried in the air. Yield: 54% (based on H2dte).
