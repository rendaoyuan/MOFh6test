Preparation of the complexes (1) {K2[Cu(μ-pydc)2]·3H2O A quantity of 10mL dimethylformamide solution of pydcH2 (1.00g, 5.98mmol) was treated with KOH and metallic copper (0.38g, 5.98mmol) under stirring at 80°C and stirred until total dissolution of the mixture was observed. The mixture turned to blue about 1h. The clear solution was stirred for 2h at 80°C and then cooled to room temperature. Blue crystals were formed and washed with 10mL of water and then dried in air. The compound is soluble in CH3OH, DMF, water and is indeﬁnitely stable in air. Yield: 68% (based on Cu) for 1.
