Preparation of {[Cd(diphenate)(4-bpfp)]·H2O} n (3) Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (30mg, 0.097mmol), 4-bpfp (28mg, 0.097mmol), diphenic acid (24mg, 0.097mmol), 0.5mL 1.0M NaOH solution, and 7mL deionized water were placed into a 23mL Teflon-lined acid digestion bomb. The bomb was sealed and heated in an oven at 120°C for 72h, and then cooled slowly to 25°C. Colorless blocks of 3 (36mg, 56% yield based on Cd) were isolated after washing with distilled water and acetone, and drying in air.
