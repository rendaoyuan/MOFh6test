Synthesis of [Cu2(BTC)(OH)(Dpq)2]·H2O (2): A mixture of CuCl2 ·2H2O (0.034g, 0.2mmol), H3BTC (0.025g, 0.12mmol), Dpq (0.023g, 0.1mmol), H2O (12mL) and NaOH (0.015g, 0.37mmol) was stirred for 30min in air, then transferred and sealed in a 25mL Teflon reactor, which was heated at 160°C for 6 days leads to the formation of yellow block crystals, and washed by water, ethanol, dried in air. Yield: ∼25% (based on Cu).
