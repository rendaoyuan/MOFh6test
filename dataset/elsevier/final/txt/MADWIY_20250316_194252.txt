[Cu2I2(dtpcp)2]·Me-thf (4) A solution of Me-thf (2-methyltetrahydrofuran) (10 mL) containing 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane (27.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) was introduced into a 7 mm diameter glass tube and layered with MeCN as a buffer zone. Then a dilute solution (10 mL) of CuI (19.0 mg, 0.1 mmol) in MeCN was added gently to avoid possible mixing. After standing at room temperature for 1 week, colorless brick crystals of complex 4 were obtained in the buffer zone.
