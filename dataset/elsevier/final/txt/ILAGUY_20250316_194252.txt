Preparation of {[Cd3(diphenate)4(H23-bpmp)(H3-bpmp)(H2O)2](ClO4)·7H2O} n (2) Cd(ClO4)2·6H2O (75mg, 0.18mmol), 3-bpmp (99mg, 0.37mmol) and diphenic acid (44mg, 0.18mmol) were placed into 5mL distilled H2O in a 15mL screw-cap vial. The vial was sealed and heated in an oil bath at 80°C for 72h, whereupon it was cooled slowly to 25°C. Colorless plates of 2 (84mg, 67% yield based on Cd) were isolated after washing with distilled water and acetone, and drying in air.
