Synthesis of 1. A water solution (5mL) of HgCl2 (27.2mg, 0.1mmol) was added to a solution of L 2 (15.0mg, 0.05mmol) in CH3OH (10mL). After ca. 30min of vigorous mixing, the resulting solution was filtered and left to stand under ambient conditions. Upon slow evaporation of the solvents, colorless block crystals of 1 were obtained after ca. 10days. For 1: 53% yield (15.2mg, based on L 2 ).
