Synthesis of 2: a solution of Ge(tmtaa)Cl2 (48.6mg, 0.1mmol) in methanol and ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v%; 8mL) was carefully layered on a solution of disodium 2,5-dihydroxyl-1,4-benezedicarboxylate (21.0mg, 0.1mmol) in water (5mL). The mixture was kept at room temperature and the orange single crystals and powder of 2 can be synthesized in the similar method as 1 using Ge(tmtaa)Cl2 and disodium 2,5-dihydroxyl-1,4-benezedicarboxylate as the starting reagents. The powder of 2 was acquired in a yield of 83%.
