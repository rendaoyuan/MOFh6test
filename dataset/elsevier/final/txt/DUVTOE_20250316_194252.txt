An aqueous solution (10mL) containing H6abhca (44.6mg, 0.1mmol), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (30.8mg, 0.1mmol) and NaOH (20mg, 0.5mmol) was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25mL) under autogenous pressure, which was heated to 140°C for 3d and subsequently cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5°Ch−1. Colorless block crystalline products were obtained in 48% yield (based on Cd).
