Synthesis of [HgI2(mbbz)] n (3) A solution of mbbz (5.9mg, 0.025mmol) in 5mL dichloromethane was added slowly into a solution of HgI2 (8.0mg, 0.025mmol) in 5mL methanol. The mixture was filtered to give a clear solution and then was left standing at room temperature without disturbration. The yellow block crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction were obtained about one week later (Yield: 8.0mg, 46% based on Hg).
