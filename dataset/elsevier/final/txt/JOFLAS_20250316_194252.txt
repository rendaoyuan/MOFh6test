Preparation of [Cu(tp)(3-bpmp)] (3) Cu(NO3)2 ·6H2O (67mg, 0.277mmol), terephthalic acid (46mg, 0.277mmol), and 3-bpmp (74mg, 0.55mmol) were suspended in 6g (333mmol) distilled H2O (1:1:2mol ratio) into a borosilicate glass tube that had been previously flame sealed at one end. The tube was sealed and heated at 80°C for 216h, whereupon it was cooled slowly in air to 25°C. Purple crystals of 3 (119mg, 49% yield based on Cu) were isolated after washing with distilled water and acetone and drying in air.
