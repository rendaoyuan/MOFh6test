Synthesis of [Tb 4 L 3 (H 2 O) 9 ]·7H 2 O (1): A mixture of 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride (0.075mmol, 0.033g), Tb(NO3)3·5H2O (0.065g, 0.15mmol) and (0.012g, 0.30mmol) NaOH in water (10mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15mL) and heated at 150°C for 72h, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10°C/h. The colorless needle-like crystals of 1 were isolated by washing with ethanol, and dried in vacuo. The yield was 48 mg (82.7%).
