Synthesis of {[Mn2(atz)2(Hbtc)2]·2H2O} n (2) To an ethanol (8.0mL) solution containing atz (0.2mmol, 16.8mg) and H3btc (0.1mmol, 21.0mg) was slowly added an aqueous solution (2.0mL) of Mn(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.1mmol, 36.2mg) with constant stirring. The resulting mixture was filtered after further stirring for an hour. Colorless prism-shaped crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were generated by slow evaporation of the filtrate in five days (Yield: 50%, based on MnII salt).
