Synthesis of {[Cd2(H2bptp)(BTEC)]·H2O} n (3) A suspension of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (9.2mg, 0.03mmol), H2bptp (11.0mg, 0.03mmol), 1,2,4,5-H4BTEC (6.3mg, 0.03mmol), acetonitrile (1.0mL) and H2O (9.0mL) was sealed into a 25mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container and heated at 160°C for 72h. After the reactor cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5°Ch−1, colorless block crystals of 2 suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained with a yield of 60% (based on Cd).
