Compounds 1 was synthesized by reacting Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1455 g) with BPY (0.0781 g) and BPEN (0.1842 g) in the mole ratio of 1:1:2 in 6 ml water. The reactions were carried out in a 23-ml acid digestion bomb at 120°C for 3 days. The products, orange crystals of 1, was washed with water and acetone and dried in air. The yield is 68% for 1.
