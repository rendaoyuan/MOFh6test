[CuCl(dtpcp)]·MeCN (3) A solution of mesitylene (10 mL) containing 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane (27.7 mg, 0.1 mmol) was poured into a 7 mm diameter glass tube and then layered with a CH3CN solution (10 mL) of CuCl (9.9 mg, 0.1 mmol). The glass tube was sealed under argon. After standing at room temperature for 1 week, colorless brick crystals of complex 3 were obtained at the interface between the two solutions.
