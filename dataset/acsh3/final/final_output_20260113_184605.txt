Synthesis of Co(BDP)⋅2DEF⋅H2O. A borosilicate tube (1.2 cm o.d. × 15 cm length) was charged with Co(CF3SO3)2 (120 mg, 0.34 mmol), H2BDP (60 mg, 0.29 mmol), and 2.0 mL of N,N′-diethylformamide (DEF). The reaction mixture was degassed by the freeze-pump-thaw method (5 cycles), and the tube was sealed under reduced pressure. The tube was heated in an oil bath at 130 °C for 6 days to afford a purple microcrystalline solid. Upon cooling to room temperature, the tube was broken open in air and the solid was immediately collected by filtration. The solid was then washed with successive aliquots of DEF (5 × 10 mL) and dried under reduced pressure for 30 min to afford 0.13 g (95%) of product. The compound was stored under an atmosphere of DEF vapor. Single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained from a smaller-scale reaction employing a borosilicate tube (0.7 cm o.d. × 8 cm length) charged with Co(CF3SO3)2 (30 mg, 0.084 mmol), H2BDP (15 mg, 0.071 mmol), and DEF (0.4 mL).

It was then cooled to room temperature at 1 °C/min to give orange cubic crystals of MOF-501, which was formulated as Co2(BPTC)-(H2O)5‚(DMF)3(EtOH)(H2O)4 (37% yield, based on H4BPTC). During the synthesis of MOF-501, a small amount of a second phase was observed as purple plates whose proportion increased when reaction times were extended. Subsequently, a pure sample of the second phase, named MOF-502, was obtained by heating the reaction mixture for 144 h at 75 °C. This was obtained in 56% yield (based on H4BPTC) and formulated as Co2(BPTC)(H2O)(DMF)2‚(DMF)(H2O)1.5. The direct transformation of MOF-501 into MOF-502 was also achieved by submerging isolated MOF-501 crystals in the original mother liquor and heating for 96 h at 75 °C.

Experimental Procedure for NU-601. A single crystal of NU-601 was synthesized via the solvothermal reaction of 2.2 equiv. Zn(NO3)·6H2O (1.026 mmol, 0.305g), 1.0 equiv. 1 (0.466 mmol, 0.181g), and 2.0 equiv. 4,4’- bipyridine (4-4’BIPY) in 36 ml of DMF. The reagents and solvent were added to a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask and sonicated until the solution was homogeneous. This flask was capped with a rubber septum and placed in an oven set to 90 °C. After 2 days light yellow needle crystals were visible. The solvent was replaced with fresh DMF (50 ml), which had been warmed to 90 °C. The flask was then allowed to cool to room temperature. The crystals were isolated by vacuum filtration and exchanged with MeNO2 by suspending the crystals in a fresh MeNO2 solution and exchanging the solution every day for 4 days. After four days of exchanging NMR spectroscopy (500 MHz, D2SO4) was used to confirm all of the DMF had been removed. From Figure S9, one can see there are 3.4 MeNO2 molecules per strut 1, corresponding to 3.4 MeNO2 molecules per unit cell. If a unit cell has one molecule of 1 (minus 4 hydrogen atoms), two 4-4’ BIPY molecules, 2 zinc atoms, and 3.4 MeNO2 molecules (mw unit cell = 384+(166*2)+(65*2)+(61*3.4) = 1053) then the unit cell is 36.46% 1 w/w (384/1053 = 0.3646). Total amount of NU-601 isolated was 280 mg, so with a theoretical mass of 496 mg (0.181g of 1/0.3646), the % yield is 56.5%.

Colorless single crystals for X-ray single-crystal diffraction were prepared by heating a solution of H2bdc (0.025 g, 0.15 mmol), H2bpz (0.029 g, 0.15 mmol), and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.089 g, 0.30 mmol) in 9 mL of DMF in a 12 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel at 120 °C for 80 h, and then the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.1 °C/min. The yield was ∼40 mg (22%).

Syntheses of PCN-57 ZrCl4 (24 mg) and TPDC-4CH3 (56 mg) with benzoic acid (240 mg) were ultrasonically dissolved in DMF (3.0 mL) and charged into 100 ºC oven for 48 h. In the presence of benzoic acid, single crystals in octahedron shape (colorless for PCN-57) were harvested with yield of ~35 mg suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction and further characterizations as well as click reactions. In the absence of benzoic acid, no single crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction but higher-yield fine powders with diffraction profiles identified to be PCN-57 can be obtained.

Synthesis of γ-Mg-formate Mg3(O2CH)6⊃[NH(CH3)2]0.5. As 1,3-benzene-ditetrazole is sparingly soluble in water at moderate temperature, we used the solvent DMF in which it is readily soluble. We used the solvothermal condition (Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 125 to 150 °C) for synthesis which results in the formation of single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction. Before solvothermal reactions, stirring of the heterogeneous solutions for a period 30 min was helpful for the high purity of the product. Solvothermal reaction of Mg(CO2-CH3)2·4H2O (0.214 g, 1 mmol) with 1,3-benzene-ditetrazole (0.214 g, 1 mmol) in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave in 5 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) and 0.2 mL of HNO3 (3.6 M) mixture at 150 °C for 60 h produces colorless crystals of Mg3(O2CH)6⊃[NH(CH3)2]0.5 in 61% yield. Crystals were collected by filtration and dried in air (10 min). [Yield: 61%, 0.130 g depending on Mg(CO2CH3)2·4H2O].

Synthesis of [Cu3(cdm)4] K(cdm) was prepared according to a literature procedure. K(cdm) (240 mg, 1.63 mmol) was almost completely dissolved in methanol (30 mL) with the aid of sonication. To this was added a methanolic solution (3 mL) of anhydrous CuCl2 (216 mg, 1.61 mmol). Upon addition of the green CuCl2 solution, the remaining suspended K(cdm) was dissolved to give a deep orange solution. Dark orange crystals of solvated [Cu3(cdm)4] (173 mg, 0.252 mmol, 62% yield) formed on the walls of the reaction vessel over a period of two days.
