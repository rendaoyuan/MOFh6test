Synonyms: MIL-53
Compound 3, a closely related phase, was synthesized from a mixture of gallium nitrate (1 mmol), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (2 mmol), HF (1.5 mmol), and deionized water (10 mL) in a molar ratio of 1:2:1.5:560. The starting chemicals were mixed in a flexible Teflon bag in air. The bag was then put into a hydrothermal reaction vessel containing 10 mL of deionized water and heated at 220 °C for 3 days. After quenching to room temperature, the product was filtered, washed with dimethylformamide to dissolve unreacted H2BDC followed by deionized water, and then dried at room temperature. The final product was a single-phase-containing colorless single crystals of 3 suitable for single-crystal X-ray measurements.
