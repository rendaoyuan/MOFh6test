Synthesis of [Cd2(btec)(L)2]?H2O (7). A mixture of Cd(OAc)2?3H2O (0.092 g, 0.3 mmol), H4btec (0.051 g, 0.20 mmol), L (0.036 g, 0.1 mmol) and water (10 mL) was stirred for 5 min in air. The mixture was transferred and sealed in a Teflon reactor and heated at 160 uC for 3 days. Colorless crystals were obtained in a 25% yield.
