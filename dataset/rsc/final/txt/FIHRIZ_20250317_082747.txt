Synthesis of 1 A mixture of Ni(NO3)2?6H2O (0.1500 g, 0.5 mmol), H2bdc (0.0730 g, 0.5 mmol), pyrazine (0.040 g, 0.5 mmol), N,N-dimethylacetamide (5 mL) and methanol (2.5 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. It was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and then the mixture was sealed in a Parr autoclave and kept at 120 uC for three days. After the reaction was cooled to room temperature, green block crystals of 1 were formed (yield: 80%, based on Ni).
