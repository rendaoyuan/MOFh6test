6 was synthesized hydrothermally in a 23 mL teﬂon-lined autoclave by heating a mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (1.0 mmol), H2pda (1.0 mmol), bpp (0.5 mmol), NaOH (2.0 mmol), and H2O (18 mL) at 160 ◦C for 4 days. After the reactive mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 ◦C h-1 for 2 days, colorless block crystals of 6 were obtained (yield: 35% (based on Cd)).
