Synthesis of {[Cu4(pbt)2(SO4)2(DMF)2(CH3OH)]·7H2O·DMF}n (1) A MeOH solution of CuSO4·5H2O (9.6 mg in 3 mL) was carefully layered onto a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of H2pbt (6.3 mg in 3 mL). After the solution was allowed to stand for about 7 days, the turquoise rhombus crystals formed were isolated in 73% yield by filtration.
