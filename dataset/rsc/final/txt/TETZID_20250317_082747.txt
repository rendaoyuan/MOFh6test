SYNTHESIS OF CD2(TDC)2(L)2·2H2O (2). A mixture of Cd-(NO3)2·4H2O (0.05 mmol, 0.015 g), H2TDC (0.05 mmol, 0.009 g), L (0.05 mmol, 0.016 g) and water (8 mL) was adjusted to pH = 5.8 by NH3·H2O, and then heated at 120 °C in Teflon-lined autoclaves for 3 days, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The resulting colorless prismatic crystals were filtered oﬀ (yield: ca. 45% based on Cd).
