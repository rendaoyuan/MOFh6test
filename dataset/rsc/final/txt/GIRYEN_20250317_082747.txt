Synthesis of 1·H2O·C2H5OH Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (0.021 g, 0.10 mmol), 4-NO2-bdc (0.021 g, 0.10 mmol), and bpe (0.036 g, 0.20 mmol) were dispersed in mixed solvent H2O/EtOH (1:1; 7 mL), followed by the addition of KOH (0.006g, 0.10 mmol). The mixture was transferred to in a 23 mL Teflon liner stainless steel reactor and heated at 120°C for 4 days under static conditions, and then cooled to room temperature. Colourless block crystals were separated and washed with deionized water and allowed to dry in air (0.036 g, yield 85%).
