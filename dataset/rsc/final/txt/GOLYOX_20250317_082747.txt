Compounds 4 can be synthesized by a general step: a mixture of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (2 mmol), L (2 mmol) and H2sdb (1 mmol) was dissolved in a DMF–H2O–CH3CN mixed solvent. The final mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL) under autogenous pressure and heated at 95 °C for 3 days. The yield is 30%.
