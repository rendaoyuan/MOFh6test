Synthesis of {[Nd2Cu3(ANMA)6](H2O)3}(3): 0.246 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (1.0 mmol) and 0.376 g H2ANMA.HCl.0.25H2O (2.0 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water while stirring for 10 min. Then, to the solution were added 0.294g (0.67 mmol) Nd(NO3)3·6H2O (0.67mmol). The pH value of the mixture was slowly adjusted to about 5.0 to 5.5 with 1.0 mol L-1 sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture was subsequently transferred to 18 mL Teflon-lined Parr, heated to 130 oC for 30 min, then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2 oC·h-1. Block-shaped blue crystals of 1 were obtained in about 37 % yield (based on Nd(NO3)3).
