Synonyms: MMPF-8
Synthesis of MMPF-8: A mixture of tcbpp (0.001g), In(NO3)3·xH2O (0.005g), 1 drop of concentrated hydrochloric acid (con. HCl), 0.1 mL water (H2O), 0.25 mL methanol (MeOH) and 0.5 mL dimethylformamide (DMF) was sealed in a Pyrex tube under vacuum and heated to 85 oC for 48 hours. The resulting dark colored block crystals were obtained (yield: 65% based on the tcbpp). The sample was scaled up into hundreds of milligrams using multiple tubes.
