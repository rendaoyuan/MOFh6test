Preparation of [[Cu(dccptp)(NO3)]⋅0.5MeOH⋅0.5dioxane (1): Single crystals of 1 were grown by solvothermal reaction of equimolar amounts of Cu(NO3)2⋅2.5H2O and Hdccptp in methanol and dioxane at 100oC for 84 h. Green tablets were isolated, washed with MeOH and air-dried to give 1 (76% yield based on Cu(NO3)2⋅2.5H2O).
