[Ag2(H2L)(L)]n (6). A mixture of H2L (20.2 mg, 0.05 mmol), Ag(OAc) (16.8 mg, 0.10 mmol), and water (10 mL) was sealed in a Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel (20 mL), which was heated at 160 _x0002_C for three days and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless needle-like crystals of 6 suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by slow evaporation of the solvent after one week. Yield: 72% (17.9 mg, based on H2L).
