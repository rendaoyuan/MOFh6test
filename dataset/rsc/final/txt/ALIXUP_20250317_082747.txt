Synthesis of [Cu3(MDIP)(l2-OH)2(H2O)4]·6.5H2O (3). A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.0482 g, 0.2 mmol), H4MDIP (0.0344 g, 0.1 mmol), and H2O (15 ml) was placed in a beaker, and several drops of aqueous ammonia was added under stirring until the mixture became clear. The blue solution was filtered and allowed to slowly evaporate at room temperature to isolate a blue rod-like crystalline solid 3 with 52% yield based on H4MDIP.
