Co3(BTP)2·8CH3OH·10H2O (4). Under an N2 atmosphere, H3BTP (100 mg, 0.362 mmol) and Co(CF3SO3)2 (194 mg, 0.543 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of DMF in a two-neck round-bottomed flask equipped with condenser and nitrogen inlet. The resulting purple solution was heated to 60 °C and triethylamine (250 µL) was added while hot. A deposit of dark purple solid immediately appeared. The mixture was then allowed to react for 16 h at reflux. Upon cooling, the solid was collected by filtration under nitrogen, washed with methanol (4 × 10 mL), and dried under vacuum to afford 150 mg (72%) of product as a purple powder.
