[Zn(pda)(bpp)]n (3). 3 was synthesized hydrothermally in a 23 mL teflon-lined autoclave by heating a mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1.0 mmol), H2pda (1.0 mmol), bpp (0.5 mmol), NaOH (2.0 mmol), and H2O (18 mL) at 160 ◦C for 4 days. After the reactive mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 ◦C h-1 for 2 days, colorless block crystals of 3 were obtained (yield: 38% based on Zn).
