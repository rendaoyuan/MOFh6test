Synthesis of [SmAg(Hbidc)2]·3(H2O) (2) A mixture of Sm(NO3)3·6H2O (0.2 mmol), AgNO3 (0.2 mmol), H3bidc (0.2 mmol), and water (10 mL) was sealed in a 23 mL Teﬂon reactor and was kept under autogenous pressure at 170 ◦C for 5 days, then cooled to room temperature over 3 days. Light yellow square-shaped crystals were obtained with a yield of 0.1038 g (72% yield based on Sm(NO3)3).
