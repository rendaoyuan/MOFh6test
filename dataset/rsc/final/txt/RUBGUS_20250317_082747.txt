Synthesis of {[Mn2Ĳdtdn)2ĲH2O)2]Ĵ4MeOHĴH2O}n (5) A mixture of H2dtdn (15.5 mg, 0.0499 mmol), 4,4′-azopyridine (9.3 mg, 0.051 mmol), KOH (5.7 mg, 0.10 mmol), and manganeseĲII) nitrate hexahydrate (28.8 mg, 0.100 mmol) was dissolved in a methanol solution (MeOH : H2O = 5.0 mL : 1.0 mL). The resulting solution was kept at 50 °C for a week. The orange needle-like crystals of 5 were separated by filtration, washed with water and MeOH, and dried in air. Yield: 80.6% (18.3 mg, 0.0201 mmol) based on H2dtdn.
