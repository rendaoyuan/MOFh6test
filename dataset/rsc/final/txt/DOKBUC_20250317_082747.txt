Synthesis of {[Fe(BCP)0.5(HCOO)0.5(4,4′-bibp)0.5]·2H2O}n (4). A mixture of H3BCP (0.20 mmol, 0.079 g), 4,4′-bibp (0.30 mmol, 0.086 g), FeSO4·7H2O (0.20 mmol, 0.056 g), NaOH (0.20 mmol, 0.008 g) and 12 mL H2O was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, heated to 170 °C for 3 days (after reaction, pH = 6.4), followed by slow cooling (a descent rate of 10 °C h−1) to room temperature. Black green block crystals of 4 were obtained. Yield of 43% (based on Fe).
