Complex 1 was prepared as follows: An aqueous reaction mixture was prepared by dissolving H3L (0.044 g, 0.25 mmol), NaHCO3 (0.022 g, 0.25 mmol), and La(NO3)3 (0.108g, 0.25 mmol) in 18 mL of de-ionized water. Its pH was adjusted to 6.4 with 1.0 M NaOH. The resulting mixture was transferred to a 25-mL Teflon-lined vessel (Parr) and heated at 150oC for 1000 min. Cooling of the reaction mixture to room temperature at a rate of 5oC per hour afforded colourless crystalline solids as the product (yield: 0.027g; 27% based on La).
