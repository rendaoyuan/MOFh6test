Solution of 23.5 mg (0.065 mmol) of CdSiF6⋅6H2O and 14.8 mg (0.065 mmol) of Cd(NCS)2 in 3 mL of methanol was layered over a solution of 49.8 mg (0.25 mmol) of Me4bpz·0.5H2O in 1 mL of methanol and 4 mL of dichloromethane. The CH3OH/CH2Cl2 mixture (1:1 v/v, 6 mL) was introduced as an intermediate layer. Slow interdiffusion of the solutions for a period of 20 d yields 45 mg (55%) of colorless crystalline product. Complex 2 was prepared similarly (yield 70%) using methanol and chloroform solutions. The compounds are unstable in air and readily lose the solvent of crystallization within minutes. A mixture of 25.3 mg (0.070 mmol) of CdSiF6⋅6H2O, 27.9 mg (0.140 mmol) of Me4bpz·0.5H2O, and 4 mL of water was stirred for 30 min in a Teflon vessel and then it was heated at 140°C for 70 h. Slow cooling to r.t. over period of 48 h (cooling rate 2.5 °C h−1) affords pure product as colorless prisms (yield: 31.2 mg, 60%). Solution of 27.2 mg (0.075 mmol) of CdSiF6⋅6H2O in 3 mL of methanol was layered over a solution of 29.9 mg (0.150 mmol) of Me4bpz·0.5H2O in 5 mL of 1:2 v/v CH3OH/CH2Cl2 mixture, with the intermediate layer constituted by 5 mL of 2:1 v/v CH3OH/CH2Cl2 mixture. Small colorless prisms of the product grew on the walls of the tube as the solutions interdiffused for the period of 15-20 d. Complex [Cd(Me4bpz)2{NCS}2]·⅔CH2Cl2 was prepared in a similar fashion, starting with Cd(NCS)2 (Yield: 55%).
