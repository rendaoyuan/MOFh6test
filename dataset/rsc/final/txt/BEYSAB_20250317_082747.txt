Chemical_Name: catena-((μ3-adeninato)-(μ2-butyrato)-cobalt(ii) monohydrate)
Number: 914679
Synonyms: bio-MOF-13
Synthesis of bio-MOF-13 Stock solutions of cobalt butyrate (0.05 M) and adenine (0.05 M) in pre-dried DMF were prepared. To a Schlenk tube (40 mL) were added cobalt butyrate solution (9.0 mL; 0.45 mmol), adenine solution (27.0 mL; 1.35 mmol), and nanopure water (120 mL). Aer the solution was frozen in liquid nitrogen and evacuated to 200 mTorr, it was heated in a 130 _x0003_C oven (24 h). Black, octahedral crystals were collected, washed (dry DMF, 3_x0005_), and dried under argon ow. Yield: 90 mg, 71% (based on Co butyrate).
