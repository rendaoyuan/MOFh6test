A mixture of 25.3 mg (0.070 mmol) of CdSiF6⋅6H2O, 27.9 mg (0.140 mmol) of Me4bpz·0.5H2O, and 4 mL of water was stirred for 30 min in a Teflon vessel and then it was heated at 140°C for 70 h. Slow cooling to r.t. over period of 48 h (cooling rate 2.5 °C h−1) affords pure product as colorless prisms (yield: 31.2 mg, 60%). Solution of 27.2 mg (0.075 mmol) of CdSiF6⋅6H2O in 3 mL of methanol was layered over a solution of 29.9 mg (0.150 mmol) of Me4bpz·0.5H2O in 5 mL of 1:2 v/v CH3OH/CH2Cl2 mixture, with the intermediate layer constituted by 5 mL of 2:1 v/v CH3OH/CH2Cl2 mixture. Small colorless prisms of the product grew on the walls of the tube as the solutions interdiffused for the period of 15-20 d. Complex [Cd(Me4bpz)2{NCS}2]·⅔CH2Cl2 was prepared in a similar fashion, starting with Cd(NCS)2 (Yield: 55%).

Preparation of JUC-77•DMF ([In(OH)(OBA)]•DMF): H2OBA (4,4’-Oxybis(benzoic acid) ) (0.043 g, 0.17 mmol) and In(NO3)3 (0.01 g, 0.03 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (7 mL), and then 2-methyl-1-butanol (2 mL) and HNO3 (2M 0.55 mL) were added into the mixture. After stirring a little time, placed in a glass bottle and then heated at 85ºC for 72h，yield yellowy or colorless block crystals, which were filtered, and dried under the vacuum. Yield: 67% based on the In(NO3)3. Preparation of JUC-77 ( [In(OH)(OBA)]): JUC-77·DMF was immersed in dried-methanol for 14h to remove the guest molecular-DMF. To make sure the DMF being exchanged by methanol completely, the compound was treated as above for five times. And then heated at 90oC under vacuum for 12h.

Preparation of IFMC-1: Zn(NO3)2$6H2O (0.15 g, 0.50 mmol) was added to a solution of H3L (0.10 g, 0.50 mmol) in DMA (5 mL) with stirring. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 3 d and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless block crystals were collected and dried in air (yield 85%, based on Zn(NO3)2$6H2O).

Preparation of {[Zn(NO2ip)(Hbpmp)][ZnCl(H2O)(NO2ip)]}n (1) Zinc chloride dihydrate (50 mg, 0.367 mmol), bpmp (99 mg, 0.369 mmol) and 5-nitroisophthalic acid (78 mg, 0.369 mmol) were placed into 10 mL distilled H2O in a 23 mL Teﬂon-lined Parr acid digestion bomb. The bomb was sealed and heated in an oven at 120 _x0004_C for 72 h, whereupon it was cooled slowly to 25 _x0004_C. Colorless blocks of 1 (91 mg, 61% yield based on Zn) were isolated after washing with distilled water and acetone, and drying in air.

Synthesis of {[Zn2(mpm-PBODB)2bpy]·3DMF}n (SNU-110). Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (150 mg, 0.50 mmol) and H2mpm-PBODB (176 mg, 0.50 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (10 mL), and the solution was heated at 90 oC for 12 h. After the solution was cooled to room temperature, 4,4’-bpy (39 mg, 0.25 mmol) was added and then heated again at 90 oC for 48 h. The crystals formed were filtered off, washed with DMF, and dried briefly in air (160 mg, 53%).

Synthesis of [Zn(OBA)(H2MDP)]n (1) To a mixture of Zn(NO3)2$6H2O (0.1 mmol, 0.0297 g), H2MDP (0.1 mmol, 0.0204 g), H2OBA (0.1 mmol, 0.0258 g), 5 ml of distilled water, 5 ml of DMF and 5 ml of methanol were added. Then the mixture was heated to 120 _x0002_C for 72 h in a 25 ml sealed Teﬂon-lined autoclave. Afterward, the autoclave was slowly cooled down to room temperature and cube shaped colourless crystals of 1 were obtained (50% yield (0.0262 g) based on H2MDP).
