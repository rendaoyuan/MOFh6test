Single-Crystal Growth and Characterization of Al(OH)BDC·0.7H2BDC (1). Compound 1 in single-crystal form was synthesized from a mixture of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (1 mmol), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (2 mmol), HF (48%, Merck, 0.06 mL), and deionized water (10 mL) in a molar ratio of 1:2: 1.5:560. Except for water, the starting components were mixed in a flexible Teflon bag in air. The bag was then put into a hydrothermal reaction vessel containing 10 mL of water and heated at 220 °C for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting products were isolated by vacuum filtration, washed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by deionized H2O, and then dried in air. DMSO was used to dissolve unreacted H2BDC. Colorless polyhedra of 1 together with a small amount of an unidentified phase (colorless hexagonal plates) were found in the final products. The final pH was approximately 1-2. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis showed the absence of fluorine in the crystals of 1. Optical microscope images of typical polyhedral crystals of 1 are shown in Figure 1. Systematic synthesis experiments were carried out to optimize the synthesis of 1. Without the addition of HF, a pure phase of 1 could only be obtained in polycrystalline form or as tiny needles. The presence of HF promoted the appearance of large polyhedral single crystals (up to 0.5 mm in largest dimension) but introduced an additional unidentified phase (colorless hexagonal plates). An excess of HF resulted in the formation of AlF3 as the final product. Several other synthetic variations and processes including the adjustment of the pH and aluminum sources were attempted, but the synthesis of a pure phase of 1 in single-crystal form was unsuccessful.
