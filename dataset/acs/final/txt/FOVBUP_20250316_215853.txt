Synthesis of [Pb2(bpdado)Cl2(H2O)2]n (6). A mixture of PbCl2 (0.1 mmol, 27.9 mg), H2bpdado (0.1 mmol, 27.8 mg), H2O (12 mL), methanol (3 mL), and an aqueous solution of KOH (1 mol/L, 0.25 mL) was stirred under air atmosphere for 20 min. The solution was placed in a Teﬂon-lined reactor (25 mL), and then the reactor was sealed, and heated at 135 °C for 72 h. After slow cooling to room temperature, colorless block crystals of the 6 were obtained. Yield: 60% based on Pb.
