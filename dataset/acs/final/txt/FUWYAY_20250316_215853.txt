Synthesis of [Mn8(atz)4(μ3-OH)4(μ4-SO4)4(H2O)4]n 3 nH2O (2). A mixture of MnSO4 3 H2O (0.085 g, 0.5 mmol), Hatz (0.065 g, 1.0 mmol), DCDA (DCDA = dicyandiamide, 0.168 g, 2.0 mmol), and water (5 mL) was stirred for 30 min in air and then sealed in a 23 mL Teflon autoclave and heated to 130 _x0001_C for 3 days (Scheme 1). After the sample was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 _x0001_C/h, colorless needle-shaped crystals were obtained in ca. 45% yield based on Mn(II).
