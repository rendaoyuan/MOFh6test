Experimental Procedure for NU-601. A single crystal of NU-601 was synthesized via the solvothermal reaction of 2.2 equiv. Zn(NO3)·6H2O (1.026 mmol, 0.305g), 1.0 equiv. 1 (0.466 mmol, 0.181g), and 2.0 equiv. 4,4’- bipyridine (4-4’BIPY) in 36 ml of DMF. The reagents and solvent were added to a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask and sonicated until the solution was homogeneous. This flask was capped with a rubber septum and placed in an oven set to 90 °C. After 2 days light yellow needle crystals were visible. The solvent was replaced with fresh DMF (50 ml), which had been warmed to 90 °C. The flask was then allowed to cool to room temperature. The crystals were isolated by vacuum filtration and exchanged with MeNO2 by suspending the crystals in a fresh MeNO2 solution and exchanging the solution every day for 4 days. After four days of exchanging NMR spectroscopy (500 MHz, D2SO4) was used to confirm all of the DMF had been removed. From Figure S9, one can see there are 3.4 MeNO2 molecules per strut 1, corresponding to 3.4 MeNO2 molecules per unit cell. If a unit cell has one molecule of 1 (minus 4 hydrogen atoms), two 4-4’ BIPY molecules, 2 zinc atoms, and 3.4 MeNO2 molecules (mw unit cell = 384+(166*2)+(65*2)+(61*3.4) = 1053) then the unit cell is 36.46% 1 w/w (384/1053 = 0.3646). Total amount of NU-601 isolated was 280 mg, so with a theoretical mass of 496 mg (0.181g of 1/0.3646), the % yield is 56.5%.
