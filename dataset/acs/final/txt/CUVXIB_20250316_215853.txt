Synthesis of [Mn(hfbba)2(dm-phen)]•3(H2O) (F-MOF-11A) : Hydrothermal reaction of Mn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.035, 0.12 mmol) with 2, 9-Dimethyl-1, 10-Phenanthroline (0.025 g, 0.12 mmol) and excess 4,4′-Hexafluoroisopropylidene-bis-benzoic acid (0.196 g, 0.50 mmol) in a 25 ml acid-digestion bomb using de-ionized water (7 mL) at 120 0C for 72 h produced colorless crystals of F-MOF-11A in quantitative yield. Crystals were collected by filtration, washed with Ethanol and dried in air (10 min).
