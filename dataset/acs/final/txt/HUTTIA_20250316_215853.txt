Synthesis of [Zn2(hfipbb)2(bpdab)] 3 2DMF (3). A mixture of Zn(NO3) 3 6H2O (18.0 mg, 0.061 mmol), H2hfipbb (25.3 mg, 0.065 mmol), and 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene (bpdab, 10.5 mg, 0.050 mmol) was suspended in DMF (20 mL), sealed in a 25 mL reaction tube, and heated in an oil bath at 100 _x0001_C for 60 h. This afforded yellow crystals of 3, which were collected by filtration, washed with methanol, and dried in air. Yield 24.5 mg (60.3%).
