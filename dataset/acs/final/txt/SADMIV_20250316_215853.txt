Preparation of MIL-53(Fe)[H2O]. MIL-53(Fe)[H2O] was sol- vothermally synthesized (autogenous pressure) from an equi- molar amount of iron(III) chloride hexahydrate FeCl3 3 6H2O (Aldrich, 97%, 1 mmol), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid HO2C- (C6H4)-CO2H (Alfa, 97%, 1 mmol), hydrofluoric acid HF (Prolabo, 5 M, 1 mmol) in N,N0-dimethylformamide (DMF, Aldrich 99%, 5 mL). Reactants were stirred a few minutes before introducing the resulting suspension in a Teflon-lined steel autoclave. The sealed autoclave was placed in a preheated fan oven with the temperature set at 423 K and after 3 days removed while hot and allowed to cool in air to room temperature over a period of few hours. A light orange MIL-53(Fe)[DMF] powder was recovered by filtration and first washed with MeOH to obtain MIL-53(Fe)[MeOH] after complete exchange of DMF molecules by MeOH. Finally, MIL-53(Fe)[H2O] was obtained after dispersion into water and drying in air. To introduce organic guest molecules into MIL-53(Fe)[H2O], the solid material (∼0.4 g) was stirred in ∼10 cm3 of the organic liquid overnight, and the product recovered by filtration and dried at room temperature in air. The behavior of the non-fluorinated material toward pyridine and 2,6-lutidine is identical: the materials produced have almost the same cell parameters and crystal symmetry.
