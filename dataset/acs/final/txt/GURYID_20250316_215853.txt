Synthesis of [Cu(L)(ClO4)] • DMF • H2O, 3. Copper(II) perchlorate hexahydrate (0.0272 g, 0.0735 mmol) and L (0.0177 g, 0.0735 mmol) were added to separate 4 mL scintillation vials and dissolved in 1 mL of water and 2 mL of DMF, respectively. The vials were heated to 85 °C for 30 min in an aluminum heating block, followed by mixing of the solutions and additional heating. After heating for 24 h, colorless needles formed and were isolated and washed with water and S2 acetone to yield the pure product (12.5 mg, 34.4 % yield). Synthesis of [Cu2(L)2(ClO4)2] • 4DMF • H2O, 4. Copper(II) perchlorate hexahydrate (0.0545 g, 0.147 mmol) and L (0.0177 g, 0.0735 mmol) were added to separate 4 mL scintillation vials and dissolved in 1 and 2 mL of DMF, respectively. The vials were heated to 85 °C for 1 h in an aluminum heating block, followed by mixing of the solutions and additional heating. After heating for 36 h, colorless needles formed and were isolated and washed with DMF and acetone to yield the pure product (34.0 mg, 41.4 % yield). Synthesis of [Cu(L)(ClO4)] • DMA • H2O, 5. Copper(II) perchlorate hexahydrate (0.136 g, 0.368 mmol) and L (0.0177 g, 0.0735 mmol) were added to separate 4 mL scintillation vials and dissolved in 1 mL of water and 2 mL of DMA, respectively. The vials were heated to 85 °C for 1 h in an aluminum heating block, followed by mixing of the solutions and additional heating. After heating for 2 weeks, colorless needles formed that could not be isolated in bulk. Synthesis of [Cu(L)(ClO4)] • NMP • H2O, 6. Copper(II) perchlorate hexahydrate (0.136 g, 0.368 mmol) and L (0.0177 g, 0.0735 mmol) were added to separate 4 mL scintillation vials and dissolved in 1 mL of water and 2 mL of NMP, respectively. The vials were heated to 85 °C for 30 min in an aluminum heating block, followed by mixing of the solutions and additional heating. After heating for 2 weeks, colorless needles formed and were isolated and washed with water and acetone to yield the pure product (26.4 mg, 68.9 % yield). Synthesis of [Cu2(L)2(ClO4)2] • 3NMP, 7. Copper(II) perchlorate hexahydrate (0.0136 g, 0.0367 mmol) and L (0.0177 g, 0.0735 mmol) were added to separate 4 mL scintillation vials and dissolved in 1 and 2 mL of NMP, respectively. The vials were heated to 85 °C for 30 min in an aluminum heating block, followed by mixing of the solutions and additional heating. After heating for 3 d, colorless needles formed and were isolated and washed with NMP and acetone to yield the pure product (8.80 mg, 19.9 % yield).
