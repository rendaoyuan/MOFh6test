Synthesis of [{Gd(Ben)3(4,40-BPNO)(H2O)2} 3 HBen]n (6). To a solution of benzoic acid (1.5 mmol, 0.183 g) in methanol (15 mL) gadolinium(III) acetate hydrate (0.5 mmol, 0.145 g) was added and stirred for 10 min. To this reaction mixture 4,40-bipyridyl-N,N'-dioxide hydrate (0.25 mmol, 0.047 g) was added with constant stirring at room temperature. The resulting precipitate was dissolved with addition of water (5 mL). Three milliliters of DMF was added and the mixture was stirred for another 30 min. The solution was kept standing at room temperature. Diffraction quality crystals were collected after 5 days and dried in air. Yield of the pure crystalline complex was found to be >70% (based on Gd).
