MOF-501 was prepared from reaction of H4BPTC (0.030 g, 0.09 mmol) and Co(NO3)2‚6H2O (0.050 g, 0.17 mmol) in a solution containing DMF (3 mL), C2H5OH (3 mL), and H2O (2 mL). This solution was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel digestion bomb (23 mL) and heated to 75 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min for 48 h. It was then cooled to room temperature at 1 °C/min to give orange cubic crystals of MOF-501, which was formulated as Co2(BPTC)-(H2O)5‚(DMF)3(EtOH)(H2O)4 (37% yield, based on H4BPTC). During the synthesis of MOF-501, a small amount of a second phase was observed as purple plates whose proportion increased when reaction times were extended. Subsequently, a pure sample of the second phase, named MOF-502, was obtained by heating the reaction mixture for 144 h at 75 °C. This was obtained in 56% yield (based on H4BPTC) and formulated as Co2(BPTC)(H2O)(DMF)2‚(DMF)(H2O)1.5. The direct transformation of MOF-501 into MOF-502 was also achieved by submerging isolated MOF-501 crystals in the original mother liquor and heating for 96 h at 75 °C.
