Synthesis of 1. A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.181 g, 0.75 mmol), 4-cyanopyridine (0.104 g, 1 mmol), NaN3 (0.097 g, 1.5 mmol), and DMF (10 mL) was placed in a 15 mL Teﬂon reactor and kept under autogenous pressure at 80 °C for 1 day. Then the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the resulting dark green block crystals were obtained in 65% yield. Solvent Exchange from 1 to 1a. The crystalline samples of 1 were immersed in cyclohexane for 7 days to give 1a. Solvent Exchange from 1 to 1b. The crystalline samples of 1 were immersed in cyclopentane for 7 days to give 1b. Solvent Exchange from 1 to 1c. Compound 1c was obtained by soaking 1 in decahydronaphthalene for 20 days. Solvent Exchange from 1 to 1d. Compound 1d was prepared by soaking 1 in 1,4-dioxane for 4 days. Solvent Exchange from 1d to 1e. The crystalline samples of 1d were kept soaking in 1,4-dioxane for another 3 days, yielding crystalline samples of 1e. Solvent Exchange from 1 to 1f. The crystalline samples of 1 were immersed in tetrahydropyrane for 7 days to give 1f. Solvent Removal from 1a to 1g. The crystalline samples of 1a were heated at 80 °C for 3 h under a dynamic vacuum, which led to crystals of 1g. Structural Transformation from 1a to 1h. Compound 1h was obtained by a method similar to that of 1a except that water was used instead of cyclohexane.
