Synthesis of 2: A mixture of Cu(NO3)2 (0.5 mmol, 0.0996 g), tmdpy (0.5 mmol, 0.1003 g), 2.6-H2pdc (0.5 mmol, 0.0814 g), NaOH (0.5 mmol, 0.0217 g), and DMF (6 mL) was stirred for 30 min in air and then transferred and sealed in a 25 mL vial, which was heated at 120 °C for 2 days; after cooling to room temperature, the crystals of 2 in the green mother liquid were kept at room temperature. After one week, the solution became brown, and crystals of compound 3 were obtained.
