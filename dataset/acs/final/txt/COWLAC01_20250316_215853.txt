Synthesis of {[Cd5(atz)9]Cl}n 3 2nH2O (1). A mixture of CdCl2 (0.0917 g, 0.5 mmol), NaN3 (0.0651 g, 1.0 mmol), DCDA (DCDA= dicyandiamide, 0.0841 g, 1.0 mmol), and water (8 mL) was stirred for 30 min in air, and then was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon autoclave and heated at 130 °C for 3 days. After the sample was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/h, light yellow prism-shaped crystals were obtained in ca. 38% yield based on Cd(II).
