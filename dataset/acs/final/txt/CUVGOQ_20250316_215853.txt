Synthesis of [Mn(DCNQI)(bpe)] 3 2DMF: A solution of Mn-(OAc) 3 4H2O (155 mg, 0.632 mmol) in MeOH (15 mL) was diffused into a solution of DNCQI H2 (100 mg, 0.632 mmol) and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)-ethylene (bpe) (115 mg, 0.632 mmol) in DMF (3 mL). Yellow crystals separated from the solution overnight, which were collected, washed with MeOH, and dried in air.
