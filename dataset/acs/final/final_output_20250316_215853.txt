Experimental Procedure for NU-601. A single crystal of NU-601 was synthesized via the solvothermal reaction of 2.2 equiv. Zn(NO3)·6H2O (1.026 mmol, 0.305g), 1.0 equiv. 1 (0.466 mmol, 0.181g), and 2.0 equiv. 4,4’- bipyridine (4-4’BIPY) in 36 ml of DMF. The reagents and solvent were added to a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask and sonicated until the solution was homogeneous. This flask was capped with a rubber septum and placed in an oven set to 90 °C. After 2 days light yellow needle crystals were visible. The solvent was replaced with fresh DMF (50 ml), which had been warmed to 90 °C. The flask was then allowed to cool to room temperature. The crystals were isolated by vacuum filtration and exchanged with MeNO2 by suspending the crystals in a fresh MeNO2 solution and exchanging the solution every day for 4 days. After four days of exchanging NMR spectroscopy (500 MHz, D2SO4) was used to confirm all of the DMF had been removed. From Figure S9, one can see there are 3.4 MeNO2 molecules per strut 1, corresponding to 3.4 MeNO2 molecules per unit cell. If a unit cell has one molecule of 1 (minus 4 hydrogen atoms), two 4-4’ BIPY molecules, 2 zinc atoms, and 3.4 MeNO2 molecules (mw unit cell = 384+(166*2)+(65*2)+(61*3.4) = 1053) then the unit cell is 36.46% 1 w/w (384/1053 = 0.3646). Total amount of NU-601 isolated was 280 mg, so with a theoretical mass of 496 mg (0.181g of 1/0.3646), the % yield is 56.5%.

Single-Crystal Growth and Characterization of Al(OH)BDC·0.7H2BDC (1). Compound 1 in single-crystal form was synthesized from a mixture of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (1 mmol), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (2 mmol), HF (48%, Merck, 0.06 mL), and deionized water (10 mL) in a molar ratio of 1:2: 1.5:560. Except for water, the starting components were mixed in a flexible Teflon bag in air. The bag was then put into a hydrothermal reaction vessel containing 10 mL of water and heated at 220 °C for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting products were isolated by vacuum filtration, washed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by deionized H2O, and then dried in air. DMSO was used to dissolve unreacted H2BDC. Colorless polyhedra of 1 together with a small amount of an unidentified phase (colorless hexagonal plates) were found in the final products. The final pH was approximately 1-2. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis showed the absence of fluorine in the crystals of 1. Optical microscope images of typical polyhedral crystals of 1 are shown in Figure 1. Systematic synthesis experiments were carried out to optimize the synthesis of 1. Without the addition of HF, a pure phase of 1 could only be obtained in polycrystalline form or as tiny needles. The presence of HF promoted the appearance of large polyhedral single crystals (up to 0.5 mm in largest dimension) but introduced an additional unidentified phase (colorless hexagonal plates). An excess of HF resulted in the formation of AlF3 as the final product. Several other synthetic variations and processes including the adjustment of the pH and aluminum sources were attempted, but the synthesis of a pure phase of 1 in single-crystal form was unsuccessful.

Synthesis of γ-Mg-formate Mg3(O2CH)6⊃[NH(CH3)2]0.5 : As 1,3-benzeneditetrazole is sparingly soluble in water at moderate temperature. So we used the solvent DMF in which it is readily soluble. So we used the solvothermal condition (teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 125 to 150 °C) for synthesis which results into the formation of single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction. Before solvothermal reactions, stirring of the heterogeneous solutions for a period of 30 minutes was helpful for the high purity of the product. Solvothermal reaction of Mg(CO2CH3)2•4H2O (0.214 g, 1 mmol) with 1,3- benzeneditetrazole (0.214 g, 1 mmol) in a 25 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave in 5 ml DMF and 0.2 ml HNO3 (3.6 M) mixture at 150 °C for 60 h produces colorless crystals of Mg3(O2CH)6⊃[NH(CH3)2]0.5 in 61% yield. Crystals were collected by filtration and dried in air (10 min). [Yield: 61%, 0.130 gm depending on Mg(CO2CH3)2•4H2O].

Synthesis of [Cd(bipy)0.5(Himdc)](DMF)]n (1). Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.25 mmol, 0.077 g) was dissolved in 12.5 mL of acetonitrile with constant stirring. 4,5-Imidazoledicarboxylic acid (H3imdc) (0.25 mmol, 0.039 g) and 4,4′-bipyridine (bipy) (0.125 mmol, 0.0195 g) were dissolved in 12.5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and stirred well for 30 min to make a homogeneous solution. Acetonitrile solution (2 mL) of Cd(NO3)2 was slowly and carefully layered on top of the ligand solution of DMF (2 mL) using the 2 mL buffer solution of acetonitrile and DMF (1:1). After two weeks colorless block type single crystals were grown at the junction of the two different solvents. The crystals were separated and washed with acetonitrile, which was subjected to X-ray diffraction. Yield: 80%.

Preparation of MIL-53(Fe)[H2O]. MIL-53(Fe)[H2O] was sol- vothermally synthesized (autogenous pressure) from an equi- molar amount of iron(III) chloride hexahydrate FeCl3 3 6H2O (Aldrich, 97%, 1 mmol), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid HO2C- (C6H4)-CO2H (Alfa, 97%, 1 mmol), hydrofluoric acid HF (Prolabo, 5 M, 1 mmol) in N,N0-dimethylformamide (DMF, Aldrich 99%, 5 mL). Reactants were stirred a few minutes before introducing the resulting suspension in a Teflon-lined steel autoclave. The sealed autoclave was placed in a preheated fan oven with the temperature set at 423 K and after 3 days removed while hot and allowed to cool in air to room temperature over a period of few hours. A light orange MIL-53(Fe)[DMF] powder was recovered by filtration and first washed with MeOH to obtain MIL-53(Fe)[MeOH] after complete exchange of DMF molecules by MeOH. Finally, MIL-53(Fe)[H2O] was obtained after dispersion into water and drying in air. To introduce organic guest molecules into MIL-53(Fe)[H2O], the solid material (∼0.4 g) was stirred in ∼10 cm3 of the organic liquid overnight, and the product recovered by filtration and dried at room temperature in air. The behavior of the non-fluorinated material toward pyridine and 2,6-lutidine is identical: the materials produced have almost the same cell parameters and crystal symmetry.
