In a screw cap vial, Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (6.5 mg, 0.022 mmol) and L (10.0 mg, 0.013 mmol) were combined and dissolved in DMF (1.5 mL) and water (1 mL). Acetic acid (2 drops) was added to the mixture and the mixture sonicated for 2 mins. The mixture heated at 100 °C for 2 days to give blue crystals of [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF, which were washed three times with DMF. Yield 7.0 mg (60%, based on analysis for [Cu2(L)(H2O)2]·4H2O).
