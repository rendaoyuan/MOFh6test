Compounds 1 can be synthesized by a general step: a mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, L and H2nba was dissolved in a DMF–H2O–CH3CN mixed solvent. The final mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL) under autogenous pressure and heated at 95 °C for 3 days. The detailed information of synthesis and the main features are displayed in Table 1.
