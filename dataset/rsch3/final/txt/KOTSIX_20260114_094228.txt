Compounds 3 can be synthesized using a general procedure: a mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 mmol), TPPA (47.6 mg, 0.1 mmol) and betc (0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 15 mL of a solvent mixture (DMA–H2O (2:3)). The final mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL) under autogenous pressure and heated at a certain temperature (85 °C) for 72 hours. Yield: 28%.
