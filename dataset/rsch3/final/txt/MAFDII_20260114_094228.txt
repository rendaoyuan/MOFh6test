Preparation of JUC-77•DMF ([In(OH)(OBA)]•DMF): H2OBA (4,4’-Oxybis(benzoic acid) ) (0.043 g, 0.17 mmol) and In(NO3)3 (0.01 g, 0.03 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (7 mL), and then 2-methyl-1-butanol (2 mL) and HNO3 (2M 0.55 mL) were added into the mixture. After stirring a little time, placed in a glass bottle and then heated at 85ºC for 72h，yield yellowy or colorless block crystals, which were filtered, and dried under the vacuum. Yield: 67% based on the In(NO3)3. Preparation of JUC-77 ( [In(OH)(OBA)]): JUC-77·DMF was immersed in dried-methanol for 14h to remove the guest molecular-DMF. To make sure the DMF being exchanged by methanol completely, the compound was treated as above for five times. And then heated at 90oC under vacuum for 12h. TGA, IR, and powder X-ray diffraction were used to examine that the channel is open and the sample remained the structure.
