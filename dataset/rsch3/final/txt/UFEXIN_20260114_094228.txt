Synthesis of [Ho2Cu(m6–O)1/6(m3–OH)2/3(m3– OH)2(hpzc)2(H2O)2]$2H2O (2) A mixture of Ho2O3 (0.189 g, 0.5 mmol), CuCl2$2H2O (0.034 g, 0.2 mmol), H2pzdc (0.05 g, 0.3 mmol), H2O (10 mL) and HClO4 (0.5 mmol) was stirred in air for 1 h, and then was sealed in a Parr Teﬂon-lined stainless-steel bomb and heated at 160 _x0002_C for 3 d. The resulting dark-blue, rectangular-prism crystals of 2 were collected after washing with water (yield: 27%, based on CuCl2$2H2O).
