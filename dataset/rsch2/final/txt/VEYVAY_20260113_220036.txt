[Co2(H2mel)(tpt)(H2O)6]?(H2O)0.65 (3a). A mixture of CoCl2?6H2O (75 mg, 0.30 mmol), tpt (14 mg, 0.05 mmol), mellitic acid (18 mg, 0.05 mmol), and H2O (6.0 mL) was heated in a stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner at 140 uC for 24 h and then was cooled slowly. Rosy, block crystals of 3a (y43% yield) formed together with some colorless crystals, which were easily removed.
