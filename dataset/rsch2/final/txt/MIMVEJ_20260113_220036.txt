A methanolic solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (149 mg, 0.5 mmol) was carefully layered onto a methanolic solution of nicotinic acid (123 mg, 1 mmol), pyridine (79 mg, 1 mmol) and toluene (3 ml, 28 mmol), or naphthalene, (640 mg, 5 mmol), or nitrobenzene, (3 ml, 29 mmol), under ambient conditions. The solutions were left undisturbed for 48 h and colorless crystals of 2 (112 mg, 60.5%) formed at the interlayer boundary in addition to a white precipitate (60 mg, 33%) that was characterized by XPD to be the square grid 1a synthesized by Lin et al. in 1998. After 1 and 9 months, colorless crystals of 1b (15 mg, 7%) and 1c (119 mg, 43%) were collected from the mother liquor by physical separation.
