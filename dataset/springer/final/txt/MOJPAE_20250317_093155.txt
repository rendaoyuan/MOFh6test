Synthesis of [Ba(2,5-PDC)H2O]n (2) A mixture of BaCl2·2H2O (0.1450 g, 0.50 mmol), 2,5-PDAH2 (0.0835 g, 0.50 mmol) 2 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide, and 8 mL of H2O was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and then the mixture was sealed in a 25 mL Teﬂon-lined autoclave, which was heated at 110 _x0003_C for 4 days. After being slowly cooled to room temperature, colorless block-like crystal of 2 were collected by ﬁltration and washed by water for several times with yield of 35 %.
