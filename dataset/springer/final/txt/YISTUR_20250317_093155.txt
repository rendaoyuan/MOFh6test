Synthesis of 2 The mixtures of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.5 mmol, 0.145 g), H2PDC (0.5 mmol, 0.106 g), L2(0.5 mmol, 0.119 g), NaOH (1 mmol, 0.04 g) in water (12 mL) were placed in a 25 mL Teﬂon reactor which was heated to 160 _x0003_C for 4 days and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless block X-ray quality crystals of 2 in 47 % yield (based on Cd) were obtained.
Abbreviation: L2
Full Name: 1,4-bis(1-imidazol-yl)-2,5-dimethylbenzene
