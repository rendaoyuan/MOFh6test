Synthesis of Complex 1 A mixture containing Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (0.05 mmol), H2BIPA (0.075 mmol), phen (0.05 mmol), NaOH (0.075 mmol) dissolved in 8 ml H2O was sealed in a 16 ml Teflon lined stainless steel container and heated at 160 °C for 5 days. Colorless block crystals of 1 were washed by water and ethanol several times and collected by filtration with a field of 82%.
