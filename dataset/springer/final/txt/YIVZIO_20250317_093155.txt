Synthesis of Pr3(TCPS)2(NO3)(H2O)4(DMA)2·2DMA·C2H5OH·3H2O(JUC-94) was carried out as follows. A mixture of Pr(ClO4)3[0.2 mmol/mL(0.1 mL, 0.02 mmol)] and H4TCPS (25 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in DMA/EtOH/H2O(3:3:2, volume ratio) followed by the addition of 0.1 mL of HNO3 (2 mol/L). The mixture was sealed in a screw-capped vial heated at 100 °C for 3 d. The light green crystals were collected. Yield: 68%(based on Pr).
