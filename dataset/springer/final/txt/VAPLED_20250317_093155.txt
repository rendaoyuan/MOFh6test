Preparation Since the crystals(A) prepared from an aqueous solution of copper(II)acetate and mellitic acid did not give well-defined reflections for the X-ray analysis, the title compound(B) was prepared using copper(II)formate instead of copper(II)acetate by the following method. An aqueous solution of copper(II)formate (1 retool) was added to an aqueous solution of mellitic acid (0o3 mmot) for suspensions to be formed. After about 2 days, keeping the temperature at 60~ dark-blue crystals separated from the suspensions. The crystals(B) were shown to be the same compound as the crystals(A) by elemental analysis, the magnetic behavior and the X-ray powder pattern.
