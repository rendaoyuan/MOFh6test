Preparation of Complex A mixture of Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (0.25 g, 0.5 mmol), 2,20-bipyridyl-4,40-dicarboxylic acid (0.12 g, 0.5 mmol) and H2O (10.0 mL) in a mol ratio of ca. 1:1:1111 was sealed in a 25 mL stainless-steel reactor with Teflon liner and directly heated to 160 °C and kept reacting for 3 days, then cooled to room temperature during 24 h. Light gray prism-like crystals of complex were obtained in 24% yield.
