Synthesis of complex 2 MeOH (2 mL) was carefully added dropwise over a solution of 4-pmntd (40 mg, 0.1 mmol) in CHCl3 (10 mL). A solution of Co(NO3)2_x0002_6H2O (36 mg, 0.125 mmol) in MeOH (3 mL) was been layered over the buffer layer. The solution was left to stand for 3 weeks at room temperature, and red crystals of {[Co(4-pmntd)(H2O)4]_x0002_(NO3)2_x0002_H2O}n, complex 2 were collected in 25 % yield based on ligand.
