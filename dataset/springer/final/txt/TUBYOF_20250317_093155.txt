Synthesis of {[Tb2Cu(pydc)4(H2O)3]·H2O}n (1) A solution of Tb(NO3)3·6H2O (0.01 mmol) and Cu(OAc)2 (0.0190 g, 0.010 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of pydc (0.0167 g, 0.01 mmol) in water (12 mL). The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 5 with 0.1 mL ethylenediamine and 0.1 mL HCl (36–38%). After stirring for 1 h, the mixture was sealed in a bomb and heated at 160 °C for 3 days, then cooled at 10 °C/3 h to 100 °C, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. After filtration, the product was washed with distilled water and then dried at room temperature. Dark blue block crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained in ca. 51% yield based on Tb(III).
