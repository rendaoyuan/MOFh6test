Preparation of {[Ni(H2bna)_(DMF)2_(H2O)2]_DMF}n (3) A solution of Ni(ClO4)2_6H2O (0.0366 g, 0.10 mmol) and H4bna (0.0187 g, 0.05 mmol) in DMF/MeOH/H2O (4:1:1, 6 mL) was stirred for 20 min in air and then placed in a Parr Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL). After addition of 0.1 M NaOH (0.3 mL), the vessel was sealed and heated at 80 °C for 72 h, then cooled to room temperature. Light-green prismatic crystals of 3 were collected by ﬁltration, washed with water, and dried in air (yield 53% based on Ni).
