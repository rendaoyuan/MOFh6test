Preparation and Analysis of [Eu(Hbtca)(H2O)] (2) The mixture of 1, 2, 4, 5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid 25.4 mg (0.1 mmol) and Eu2O3 14.1 mg (0.04 mmol) in 7 mL distilled water was stirred 30 min at room temperature. Then this mixture was sealed in a 25-mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel container, which was heated at 150 _x0003_C for 3 days. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, colorless block crystals were obtained (20.7 mg).
