Synthesis of complex 1 A mixture of Co(OAc)2_x0002_4H2O (0.1 mmol, 25 mg), L1 (0.1 mmol, 36.7 mg), H4btec (0.1 mmol, 25.4 mg), and H2O (12 mL) was stirred for 1 h, and then, the pH was adjusted to 6.5 by the addition of 0.1 mol/dm3 NaOH solution. The resulting mixture was sealed in a 25-mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel, which was heated at 140 _x0003_C for 72 h, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 _x0003_C/h. Purple block-shape crystals of complex 1 suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were obtained in 45 % yield (based on Co(OAc)2_x0002_4H2O).
