Synthesis Di-n-butyl tin oxide (Alfa Aeser; 1.00 g, 4 mmol) and 3,5-dinitro o-toluic acid (1.808 g, 8 mmol), prepared by the literature procedure, were mixed together in dry toluene (100 mL) in a 250 mL round bottom ﬂask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a water condenser and a Dean Stark apparatus, for continuous removal of water formed as side-product. The reaction mixture was reﬂuxed at the boiling temperature of toluene for 5 h and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. It was then ﬁltered, and toluene was removed under reduced pressure. The isolated colorless solid was recrystallized from warm chloroform (3 mL); m. pt. = 125 _x0003_C.
