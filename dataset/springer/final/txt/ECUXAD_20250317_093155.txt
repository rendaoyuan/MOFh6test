To a mixture of H2qda (0.0226 g, 0.1 mmol), bpp (0.0197 g, 0.1 mmol), NaOH (0.008 g, 0.2 mmol) and Cd(NO3)2_x0002_4H2O (0.030 g, 0.1 mmol) was added 4.0 mL deionized water. After thoroughly stirred in air at ambient temperature for about half an hour, the mixture was placed in a 15 mL Teﬂon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated to 120 _x0003_C for 72 h to give rise to colorless block crystals of 2, which were collected by ﬁltration. The colorless crystals were collected by ﬁltration, washed with water and dried in air. Yield: 0.032 g (42 % based on H2qda).
