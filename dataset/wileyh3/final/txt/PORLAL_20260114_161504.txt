Synthesis of Gd-pDBI pDBI (0.020 g, 0.05 mmol) dissolved in DMF (1.5 mL) was added to an aqueous solution (2.5 mL) of Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (0.023 g, 0.05 mmol) and was sonicated for 10 min. The turbid solution was kept in a tightly capped 5 mL vial for 72 h at 1108C to afford rod-shaped golden crystals (0.035 g, 70% yield). Preperation of Gd-pDBI nanocrystals As-synthesized Gd-pDBI (50 mg) was ball-milled using a Retsch (MM400) operated at 30 Hz for 30 min to obtain a light yellow powder of mechanically ground Gd-pDBI (MG-Gd-pDBI). Loading of anticancer drug Doxorubicin (DOX) Each Gd-pDBI (Gd-pDBI or MG-Gd-pDBI) was dispersed in Milli-Q water (5 mL) by simple sonication in an ultrasound bath followed by addition of standard DOX solution (2 mg dissolved in 1 mL Milli-Q water). This mixture was further sonicated for 5 min and then kept under vigorous stirring overnight in the dark. Finally, DOX loaded Gd-pDBI was isolated by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 15 min and washed (_x0003_2) with copious amount of Milli-Q water to eliminate surface adsorption. Interestingly, the as-synthesized Gd-pDBI exhibited negligible loading, suggesting that the entire payload is inside the pore. Cumulative drug release measurement Cumulative drug release from DOX loaded Gd-pDBI was studied at two different pH values: 1) at pH 5, which was comparable to intra-cellular lysomal pH of cancer cells; and 2) at pH 7.4, which corresponds to the extracellular pathophysical pH of normal cells. DOX loaded Gd-pDBI (5 mg) was dispersed in corresponding buffer solution (3 mL) and sealed inside a dialysis bag (molecular cut off 50 kD), which was then subsequently immersed in 100 mL of external buffer medium kept in a bowl. Dialysis was continued at 378C and drug release was monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy at l=481 nm. The zero-order kinetics was corroborated from linear nature of the release profile.
