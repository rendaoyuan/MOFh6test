[Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)2]n·4nEtOH (1): A EtOH (10 mL) solution of H3NTB (0.120 g, 3.2Q10_x0001_4 mol) and a EtOH (2 mL) solution of ZnACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2·6H2O (0.160 g, 5.4Q10_x0001_4 mol) were mixed in a Teflon vessel within the auto- clave. The vessel was heated at 1108C for 24 h and then cooled to room temperature. Brown rod-like crystals formed, which were filtered, and washed briefly with EtOH. Yield: 0.153 g, 78%; [Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2]n (1’): Single crystal 1 was introduced in a glass capillary with an open end and was desolvated at 1508C under 1 Torr for 5 h. After des- olvation, drying pistol was filled with dry air (1.0 atm), and then the ca- pillary was taken out, and sealed for X-ray structure determination. For bulk preparation, crystals of 1 were heated at 1508C under vacuum for 5 h. [Zn3ACHTUNGTRENUNG(ntb)2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(EtOH)2]n·4nEtOH (1’’): After the cell parameters of single crystal 1’ were determined in a sealed capillary, one side of the capillary was broken, and then EtOH vapor was allowed to diffuse into the crystal for 3 h. The opening of the capillary was sealed again for collection of the X-ray diffraction data of 1’’. For bulk preparation, 1’ was exposed to EtOH vapor for 3 h, or immersed in EtOH for 5 min.
