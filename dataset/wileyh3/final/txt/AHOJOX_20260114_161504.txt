1[Ho2(Mbim)4(Bbim)] 1 (Ln = Ho), and 2[Yb2(Mbim)4(Bbim)] 2 (Ln = Yb): 2-Mercaptobenzimidazole (MBimH, C7H6N2S; 1 mmol, 150 mg, ACROS 98%), the lanthanide metals (ChemPur 99.9%, 0.33 mmol, Ho: 54 mg, Yb: 57 mg), and Hg (0.05 mmol, 10 mg) were sealed in a Duran glass ampoule under vacuum and heated to 305 °C in 29 h. After annealing for 336 h it was cooled to 290 °C in 150 h, in another 200 h to 250 °C and in 44 h to room temperature. Colourless/yellow platelet crystals of 1/2 result. In cooler parts of the ampoules deep red crystals of 4 are observed. Formation of Rare Earth Thiolate Amide Coordination Polymers (BimH2)+[La(BbimH)4]– (3) and α-HgS (cinnabar, 4): 2-Mercapto-benzimidazole (MBimH, C7H6N2S; 1.5 mmol, 225 mg, ACROS 98%), La metal (0.5 mmol, 69 mg, ChemPur 99.9%), and Hg (2 mmol, 401 mg, Riedel-de Haën 100%) were sealed in a Duran glass ampoule under vacuum and heated to 305 °C in 29 h. After annealing for 336 h it was cooled to 290 °C in 150 h, in another 200 h to 250 °C and in 26 h to room temperature. Surrounded by dark S- and C-containing decomposition products (by EDX analyses) colourless platelet crystals of 3 are formed. In cooler parts of the ampoules deep red crystals of 4 are observed.
