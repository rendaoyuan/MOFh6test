Synthesis of {[Mn2(4,4-bpy)2(p-tol)4][Mn(4,4-bpy)2(H2O)2(p-tol)2]}_x0002_6H2O 4 MnCO3 (0.1363 g, 1.0 mmol) and p-toluic acid (0.1363 g, 1.0 mmol) were added to H2O (20 mL), and the reaction mixture was reﬂuxed at 80 _x0003_C for 6 h, then ﬁltered. An ethanol solution (10 mL) of 4,4-bipyridine (0.0783 g, 0.5 mmol) was added dropwise to the ﬁltrate, and the sample was stirred for 15 min to produce a yellow precipitate. This was ﬁltered off, and the ﬁltrate was allowed to stand at room temperature. Slow evaporation for 2 weeks afforded a small amount of yellow block-like crystals were grown by evaporation of the ﬁltrate for 2 weeks. Yield: 0.1537 g (27 % based on the initial MnCO3).
