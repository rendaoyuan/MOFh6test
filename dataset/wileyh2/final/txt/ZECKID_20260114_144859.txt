A solution of H2dmcapz (110 mg, 1.0 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) was added to a solution of CuCl2·2H2O (170 mg, 1.0 mmol) in MeOH (10 mL). The mixture was stirred at 90°C for 24 h and a sky blue solid was collected by filtration. The solid was quickly washed with DMF and dried in air. Yield: 66%; [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2OH2]n·0.9nDMF (1a): The partially evacuated 1a sample (sky blue color) has been obtained by degassing 1 at 120°C for 7 h under high vacuum. [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2OH2]n·4.5nH2O (1a’): Solid 1a was suspended in water for 24 h, filtered and dried in air to give the water-exchanged, sky blue 1a’ material. [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2]n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(1b): The completely evacuated 1b material (dark blue color) was obtained by heating 1a’ at 150°C for 7 h under high vacuum. It is not stable in air, because it rapidly converted into 1a’ after accommodation of water in the channels. [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2]n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(1c): The treatment of 1b solid at 77 K under He atmosphere for 5 min afforded the empty and air-stable 1c material (forest green color).
