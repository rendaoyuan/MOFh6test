[Zn5Cl4(BTDD)3] (MFU-4l) Solvothermal method: H2-BTDD (760 mg, 2.77 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (760 mL) under stirring and heating at 1458C for 30 min. Anhydrous zinc chloride (7.78 g, 57.2 mmol) was added to a cooled (ca. 508C) solution of linker and the mixture was stirred until the zinc chloride was completely dissolved. The resulting solution was heated with stirring under reflux at 1458C for 18 h and then cooled down to room temperature. The precipitate was removed by filtration, washed slowly with DMF (3_x0005_50 mL), methanol (3_x0005_50 mL), and dichloromethane (3_x0005_50 mL), and dried for 24 h at 1808C under vacuum (ca. 0.2 mbar). Yield 940 mg (90% based on ligand) of an almost white microcrystalline powder. Microwave irradiation method: H2-BTDD (5 mg, 0.0188 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (5 mL) under stirring and heating at 1458C for 10 min. A 1m solution of anhydrous zinc chloride in DMF (0.4 mL, 0.4 mmol) was added to a cooled (ca. 508C) solution and the mixture was placed in a Pyrex sample tube (10 mL). The tube was sealed and placed in a microwave synthesizer (CEM, Discover S). The resulting mixture was heated to 1558C at 300 W, kept under these conditions for 30 min, and then cooled down to room temperature. The precipitate was removed by filtration, washed slowly with DMF (5 mL), methanol (5 mL), and dichloromethane (3_x0005_10 mL), and dried for 24 h at 1808C under vacuum (ca. 0.2 mbar). Yield 5.2 mg (73%) of an almost white microcrystalline powder. This material exhibited the same analytical results as those obtained by the solvothermal method and is phase-pure according to XRPD measurement.
