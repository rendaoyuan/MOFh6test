Synthesis of [Cu2L2.5(L4)(H2O)]·10H2O (4): A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (0.171 g, 1 mmol), NaOH (0.080 g, 2 mmol), and pyromellitic acid (H4L4; 0.116 g, 1 mmol) in water was stirred for 10 min at 60 °C, then 1,1-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole) (L; 0.190 g, 1 mmol) was added to the mixture. After stirring for 30 min, the blue precipitate was collected and dissolved in a minimum amount of ammonia (14 m). Blue single crystals of 1 were obtained by slow evaporation of the ammoniacal solution at ambient temperature. Yield: 81% (340 mg).
Abbreviation: H4L4
Full Name: pyromellitic acid
