Compound [1(AgBr)2]n: Compound 1 (500 mg, 0.942 mmol) was dissolved in CH3CN (10 mL). Subsequently, AgBr (354 mg, 1.884 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was heated at 90 °C to reflux for a period of 4 h. Then half of the solvent was removed under vacuum from the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was filtered and washed with a small portion of CH3CN. The pale yellow product was dried under vacuum to yield 779 mg (0.860 mmol, 91%) [1(AgBr)2]n. Crystals suitable for an XRD analysis were obtained from concentrated CH3CN solutions. C26H50Ag2Br2N12 (906.30): calcd. C 34.46, H 5.56, N 18.55; found C 34.31, H 5.56, N 18.36. 1H NMR (199.92 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 2.79 (s, 48 H, CH3), 5.38 (s, 2 H, ArH) ppm. 13C NMR (100.55 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 39.94 (CH3), 110.92, 134.94, 162.10 ppm.
