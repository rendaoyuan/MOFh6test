[Co2(tipm)(1,3-BDC)2]·0.5CH3CN (2·0.5CH3CN): A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.030 g, 0.1 mmol), tipm (0.029 g, 0.05 mmol) and 1,3-H2BDC (0.016 g, 0.10 mmol) in CH3CN (0.5 mL) and H2O (2.0 mL) was sealed in a glass tube and then heated at 150 °C for 24 h. The solution was cooled to room temperature at the rate of 5 °C/h to produce blue block crystals of 2, which were collected by filtration, washed with water and EtOH, and dried in air, yield 0.028 g (54% based on tipm).
