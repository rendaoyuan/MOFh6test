Synthesis of {[Gd6Cu3L6(m3-OH)6(m6-O)(m2-O)2]·12H2O}n (Gd-Cu) A mixture of H2L (0.0278 g, 0.2 mmol), Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (0.0902 g, 0.2 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.0242 g, 0.1 mmol), water (4 mL), and MeOH (1 mL) was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave (25 mL) and heated at 160°C for 72 h under autogenous pressure. After cooling to RT at a rate of 28°C/h, prism crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were collected manually, washed with water, and dried in air. Gd-Cu: Yield: 38%.
Abbreviation: H2L
Full Name: 3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxylic acid
