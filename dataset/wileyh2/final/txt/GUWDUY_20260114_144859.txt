Synthesis of 3 ∞[La2Cl6(bipy)5]·4bipy LaCl3 (0.25 mmol, 62 mg) and 4,4'-bipyridine (bipy, 1.25 mmol, 195 mg) were sealed in an evacuated DURANTM glass ampoule and heated to 90 °C in 7 h and then to 120 °C within 30 h. The temperature was held for 48 h and afterwards cooled to 95 °C in 250 h and finally to room temperature in further 14 h. The reaction resulted in high reflecting colorless crystals of the product and an amount of unreacted LaCl3 in the bulk. Yield: 199 mg = 84 %.
