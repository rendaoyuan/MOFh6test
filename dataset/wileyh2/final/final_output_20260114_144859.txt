Synthesis of 1 Ce(NO3)3.6H2O (20 mg) and H4TCPB (10 mg) were added to EtOH (3 mL) and H2O (3 mL) in 12 mL borosillicate glass vial and the vials sealed. The mixture was sonicated for 10 minutes to form a white suspension, which is then heated at 2°C/min to 120°C for 48 hours and cooled at 0.2°C/min to room temperature (25°C). Large colourless single crystals are separated from the mother liquor by vacuum filtration and washed with EtOH and H2O to yield pure compound with the formula Ce(HTCPB).0.28EtOH.2.75H2O. These single crystals were used for the single crystal diffraction experiments. 1 can also be produced at 3× the scale (3× reagent in 3× solvent in 40 mL glass vial) which produces smaller particles of 1, with a more polydisperse particle size than from method A. Samples produced by both methods were used in the liquid phase sorption experiments and produced identical results. 1 is stable on standing in water. 3 is synthesised by desolvation of 1 at 100°C and 10–3 mbar for 6 hours.

Synthesis of Complexes [C28H30MnN8O10]n (1) and (C13H8N4O3)2Mn2(CH3OH)(H2O)3 (2): Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.10 g, 0.41 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (10 mL) in a round-bottomed flask. H2L5 (0.10 g, 0.34 mmol) was added to methanol (10 mL), and the solution was warmed. The two mixtures were combined to give a cloudy orange solution. H2O was added dropwise, but the precipitate still did not dissolve. The reaction mixture was then stirred and heated gently for 24 h. A cloudy orange solution resulted, which was gravity-filtered to give a clear light yellow filtrate, and an orange precipitate. Attempts to redissolve the precipitate were unsuccessful. The yellow filtrate was left to slowly concentrate at room temperature. Colourless crystals of 1 suitable for X-ray diffraction formed after 2 weeks (yield 45 mg, 16% based on metal salt). On further standing, a small quantity of orange crystals (ca. 15 mg) of 2 was obtained from the mother liquor, which were also suitable for X-ray diffraction.

JUC-48: A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.15 g, 0.5 mmol), H2bpdc (0.05 g, 0.25 mmol), and dmf (50.0 mL) was stirred in air for 2 h. Subsequently, triethylamine (0.5 mL) in dmf (15.0 mL) was slowly diffused in at 608C over three days. The resulting colorless rod-shaped crystals of JUC-48 were collected in 80% yield based on cadmium. The complex was insoluble in common organic solvents such as acetone, methanol, ethanol, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, chloroform, and dmf.

Preparation of Zn(H2O)(PO3C6H4COOH) (5) Hydrothermal Synthesis: In a 50-mL PTFE insert was dissolved 3-phosphonobenzoic acid (0.1 g, 0.49 mmol, 1 equiv.) in distilled water (15 mL). To this solution was added Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.162 g, 1.48 mmol, 1.5 equiv.). The insert was transferred into a Berghof pressure digestion vessel and heated from room temperature to 160 °C over 18 h and then further heated at 160 °C for 40 h and cooled to room temperature over 18 h. After filtration, the resulting compound obtained as a white powder was washed with water, rinsed with absolute ethanol and dried in air (0.095 g, 68% yield).

Synthesis of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH] Gallium (70 mg = 1 mmol) and imidazole (ImH, C3H3NNH; 204 mg = 3 mmol) were sealed in an evacuated DURAN glass ampoule. The reaction mixture was heated in 24 h to 120 °C and held at this temperature for 1850 h. The melt was cooled to room temperature in 1 h. The reaction gave a colourless crystalline product of trapezoidal crystals of 3 ∞[Ga2(Im)6ImH]. Yield (ImH): 181 mg (69 %). Shorter reaction times decrease the yield of the reaction. Higher reaction temperatures result in a different poorly crystalline product.

A solution of H2dmcapz (110 mg, 1.0 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) was added to a solution of CuCl2·2H2O (170 mg, 1.0 mmol) in MeOH (10 mL). The mixture was stirred at 90°C for 24 h and a sky blue solid was collected by filtration. The solid was quickly washed with DMF and dried in air. Yield: 66%; [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2OH2]n·0.9nDMF (1a): The partially evacuated 1a sample (sky blue color) has been obtained by degassing 1 at 120°C for 7 h under high vacuum. [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2OH2]n·4.5nH2O (1a’): Solid 1a was suspended in water for 24 h, filtered and dried in air to give the water-exchanged, sky blue 1a’ material. [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2]n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(1b): The completely evacuated 1b material (dark blue color) was obtained by heating 1a’ at 150°C for 7 h under high vacuum. It is not stable in air, because it rapidly converted into 1a’ after accommodation of water in the channels. [Cu2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(dmcapz)2]n ACHTUNGTRENUNG(1c): The treatment of 1b solid at 77 K under He atmosphere for 5 min afforded the empty and air-stable 1c material (forest green color).
